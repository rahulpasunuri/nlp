Delicious and EASY! A quick and impressive dessert that you can whip up pretty effortlessly. Made this last night, a Friday night after work, with friends in my kitchen, as dinner was cooking, and as we were drinking lots of wine! If you can make this cake after several glasses/bottles of wine, it can only mean that this is EASY to make. Did not make glaze - served with whipped cream and bodacious raspberries instead. Decadent, chocolatey, received rave reviews, and also goes well with wine! Life is short - eat good food and drink good wine whenever possible.

This turned out GREAT but for some reason it took a lot more time to cook than the 50 min. indicated. For me it took about 1 1/2 hours! I just kept checking it and when the knife came out with just a few crumbs I took it out of the oven. I followed the recipe exactly. Thanks!!

I made this for a holiday party as mini's and it was a hit. Instead of making a chocolate glaze I made a Raspberry Chambord reduction. I also added dark chocolate chips to the batter. Whats not to love about dark chocolate and raspberries. I will make this again for sure!

I ended up making cupcakes because person can't eat corn syrup. The full recipe made 23 and baked in 20 mins. And, I used whole eggs. The cupcakes still rose and fell, just like they were supposed to.

Thank you to the cook who gave notes on how to make this into cupcakes (1/2 the recipe for about 10). I just tried it and will need to make again to perfect for guests. I noticed the cupcakes fell a bit and I did push cake down to remove excess space. Cake stuck to paper liners. Not sure if it would be better to use foil liners or spray liners in case I want to remove the cupcakes to make mini cakes (cover each cupcake with glaze - try at a later date). For now I just added a large spoonful of glaze to top of each cupcake and it looks ok. Great "adult" cupcake. Looking forward to trying as a regular cake in springform pan, too.

I just made these and they turned out great! I made them as cupcakes though and baked them at 350 for 25 minutes, rotating half way through. I halfed the recipe and it made 10 large cupcakes and rose more than i thought they would. could probably have made 11 to not overflow over the cupcake liners.

dmgard from London - when you took the cake out of the pan, you were supposed to invert it on a cardboard round or a tart pan bottom. That would give it some support and make it easy to move around.

I did not make this recipe, but I did eat it and it was out of this world! My husband has celiac so we had to do something flourless and this will probably be my go-to from now on. It was absolutely delicious. My husband did request chocolate chips in it when I make it and I ahve plans to do it in June. can't wait!

I've made this recipe many times over the last few years. I usually mix some jam into the glaze for a little twist. This last time, I replaced the corn syrup with a homemade coffee syrup. I took 1 cup of sugar and slowly melted it in a skillet over medium heat. I took a small coffee with two extra shots and reduced it about 30%. I added that to the molten sugar, then added another cup of sugar. I substituted this for the corn syrup in the exact quantity. It was killer!

Outrageous. Insanely good. Better 2 days later (and every bit as moist). I used 1/2 semisweet chocolate chips and 1/2 Ghiradelli milk chocolate chips and salted butter (it's all I had but I think the milk chocolate balanced it out). I followed the prep for the "Flourless chocolate cake with coffee liqueur" that calls for beating whole eggs with the sugar til very thick (6 minutes) because I was too lazy to beat the yolks and whites separately and do all the folding. Also, I didn't make the chocolate glaze but made the caramel sauce from another Epicurious flourless chocolate cake recipe which was great, even though it was a tad burnt and also used salted butter. Love this cake for the do-ahead factor and the many ways to dress it up (berries, chocolate sauce, caramel, etc.)

Not a huge dessert fan or a chocolate fanatic, but this cake was absolutely delicious. Agreed, it is not hard but is time consuming. Does it crack & fall? You bet it does and it looked like a train wreck. However, I used Wilton's candy clay recipe and made a bunch of chocolate leaves and a single chocolate rose for the center. Looked fabulous. Also served "espresso whipped cream" in a side dish. It helps to cut the richness a bit. Enjoy, and I will absolutely make this one again!

I did not find this as good as the reviews made it out to be. If I was limited to flourless - I might be inclined to like it more... but I am not, and would just go ahead and make a traditional chocolate cake that I could really love. Plus it was a stinking amount of work. Not hard, just time consuming.

I made just the cake and not the glaze. Delicious! It's more rich and chocolately than a lot of recipes I've made for brownies, which is heavenly. I used an 8"x8" square pan instead of a 9" round (very similar area) and it worked out fine. I cut the square cake in half and made a two-layer cake.

Rating: 0
My new favorite dessert to make and to eat. It's incredibly delicious, even when I cut the sugar down to 8 T total; it didn't compromise the flavor at all. I recommend this recipe to all chocolate lovers, especially those with celiac disease. It's easier to make using two mixers; the KitchenAid with the balloon whip for the egg whites, and the hand mixer for the egg yolk portion. Also, if you don't have parchment, a brown paper bag works just as well (and is probably easier to butter). Enjoy!

This cake is even good when it's a disaster! I have made it at least 20 times, so I don't know what happened this year when, the day before my Passover Seder, it ripped when I tried to remove the pan bottom. And not just a little bit of the surface, but a great big gaping hole. Rather than face defeat and waste all those good ingredients (Callebaut chocolate, butter, my own vanilla extract with pods from Zanzibar. . .)I scraped what was stuck to the pan bottom, pressed the cake back together on the cake stand, coated just the top with a thin semi-sweet chocolate and water glaze (Passover. No corn syrup), surrounded rim of the cake stand with fresh raspberries and placed a few edible pansies on top and around the sides. My guests ate every crumb!

Can anyone tell me whether this cake is supposed to be glazed upside down? It's not that clear in the recipe. Did you keep it on the tart pan bottom? It seems difficult to get it off of that to put it on a platter....

This was excellent! My husband and kids loved it when I made it for my 2 year olds birthday (we are gluten- free). It was fluffy and had the perfect chocolate taste (I used semi- sweet chocolate to make sure my kids liked it) and instead of the glaze, I made the raspberry sauce from here. I didn't have the cherry or raspberry liquor, so I used a sweet nice sipping wine for the glaze that we got from a vineyard in Colorado. I also melted Bakers white chocolate (maybe 5 bars worth) and sprinkled it over the entire cake. The raspberry sauce was only added to the individual slices when I was serving. A major hit. Making it again today for my other son's birthday.

I am probably out of line because I did not make this recipe, but I regularly make one that is amazingly similar. The only difference is that six whole eggs are whisked in a bowl while the chocolate is melting, and then added at once. The resulting texture is a very dense but silky smooth chocolate, and the top is fairly uniform. I top mine with chocolate ganache which covers any imperfections, and this ALWAYS gets rave reviews!

Rating: 4
We used 1/2 bittersweet (60% cacao) and 1/2 semisweet (both Ghirardelli). Made the entire quantity of glaze but applied only the first step - nearly a 1/8" thick coating. I couldn't wait to try it, so I had some after cooling in the fridge for only 2 hours. My first opinion was that it was just ok. My second tasting 18 hours later totally changed my opinion. The cake was much denser and consistently moist - much closer to what we have had in restaurants. I highly recommend removing all of the crusty top and sides - the crunchiness throws off the smooth texture. Add some homemade whipped cream and raspberry sauce and you have an amazing dessert. Definitely worth making again.

To Cook 07/17/09 -- Splenda or any other sugar substitute won't really work in this sense, because the eggs need the chemical structure of sugar to whip properly. If you add Splenda you won't get the volume in the whites/yolks, and then you won't get volume in the cake itself, it'll be super dense and heavy. Hope that helps!

Superb cake - very rich, dark and full of chocolate flavor. I used a combo of extra dark Callebaut and semisweet Ghiradelli. Garnished top with raspberries and mint, and served with a large dollop of Grand Marnier-infused whipped cream. I used an 8-inch springform pan, which worked just fine.

This has become a family favorite for birthdays and holidays and school events. Everyone LOVES this cake. It looks beautiful and impressive with the chocolate glaze poured on top and fresh raspberries. Great as cupcakes too: Use an ice cream scoop for the glaze on the cupcakes. In a hurry, I've made it w/ just confectioner's sugar sprinkled over the top. Kids love it! Adults love it! We don't think it's too rich at all! : )

Made this for a friend at work. Everyone loved the cake. It was quite easy, tasted rich and chocolatey. But I found the texture to be a mix of moist sections and crumbly bits. Any ideas? Only change to the recipe was an addition of 2 teaspoons of instant coffee powder to both the cake and ganche. It brought out the chocolate flavor. We ate the leftovers on the third day and response was that it had gotten better with time.

This cake is quite good. It has a really nice texture and is not quite as dense as other flourless chocolate cakes. But if you're looking for rich, dense chocolate intensity, then I think the recipes for the flourless chocolate espresso cake or the one with caramel sauce are more of that variety! Maybe it's richer with the glaze (I made raspberry sauce and served with vanilla ice cream), but I found it lighter than I'd imagined it would be.

Outstanding. I had a vision of a chocolate cake  dark, rich, moist, overwhelming even  and I found it in this recipe. I made the cake listed here and substituted a simple dark chocolate ganache for the glaze; the cake falls significantly after rising, so I might make two next time and use them as layers with raspberry jam or ganache between them. The taste is always extraordinary; with the proper presentation, this cake can easily rival professional creations.

I have made this cake many times and everyone says how good it is. It is extremely rich. I use one package of semisweet chocolate chips. Instead of the glaze I just use a bit of confectioners sugar as I think the glaze would be a bit too much - as I said the cake is extremely rich as it is. Whipped cream would also be a nice addition. This is also a good recipe for Passover.

This cake is incredible! I followed other reviewer's instructions and used 1/3 bitter and 2/3 semisweet chocolate for the cake, but for the glaze I used all semisweet.

This torte is amazing! I mixed the semi/unsweetened chocolates per other reviewers. I was in a hurry and had to do the glaze super fast by applying to the torte and then freezing the whole thing for about 5 minutes and it worked wonderfully. Decorated with candied flowers from my garden and mint leaves and it was perfect. Won raves from all and has been requested again!

This cake was fantastic and wasn't difficult to make - just used a lot of bowls. I did not make the glaze and I think it would be totally unnecessary and excessive. At most, the only thing I would serve with this is some whipped cream. Very rich and really does serve 10-12 as you only need a small slice.

After reading nearly all 274 reviews this past weekend, I finally got up the courage to try this recipe. I think my first attempt at this was a great one. I would although do a few things differently next time. First of all, I decided to use 1/3 bittersweet and 2/3 semi-sweet chocolate. I personally think this was a wise decision. I cut back the sugar by a few tablespoons so it wouldn't be too sweet. I baked it at 340 degrees for 45 min. It did crack a bit but I expected that. Once I flipped it over you couldn't see the cracks anymore and it looked great. Instead of pushing down the sides like the recipe says I just pealed off the crust and didn't worry about it. Next, I tried to make the glaze (minus the corn syrup) and it turned into mush. I'm not sure why?? So, after dumping out the first glaze I tried it again but this time only used 1/2 semi sweet & 1/2 bittersweet chocolate (over 60% cocoa) It was perfect! Next time I'm going to use a shiny glaze recipe so it looks better. I garnished the cake with a few fresh raspberries in the middle. It looked beautiful...and tasted great. I set out fresh raspberries, cool whip and ice cream for the guests. Everyone loved it. I think using some semi-sweet chocolate was the trick. Good luck!

Half the recipe fits perfectly in a 7" springform, rising to the top and baking in 28 minutes. The top sank very evenly, so did not need to be pushed down. I used 86% bittersweet chocolate, so the corn syrup in the glaze was essential. It still had a bitter overtone, not too sweet. The syrup also gives a high sheen and firm texture to the glaze not found in regular ganache. Nice, but I will use a less bitter chocolate next time.

This recipe is a keeper!! I made it last night for Valentine's Day. As a recent college grad, I don't have a springform pan, so I used a 8x8 square plan instead and had enough batter left over for 5 muffin tins worth. I baked the muffin tins for about 15 mins and the square pan for about 40. So far I have only tried the muffin-sized cakes but they were so delicious that my roommate and I were professing our devotion to this new recipe after the first bite. I used Equal Exchange dark chocolate (71% cacao) and I think that certainly helped with the flavor. I can't wait to try a wedge of from the larger pan tonight!

I made this with 8 oz. bittersweet and 4 oz. semi sweet chocolate. It was still a little bitter to me. Next time I will switch to 8 oz semi sweet and 4 oz bittersweet. The cake turned out moist and very chocolatey. I also skipped the glaze and served it with whipped cream and berries.

Excellent. Made this for my birthday in September and I'm getting ready to make it again for Thanksgiving. I also omitted the corn syrup from the glaze--the glaze is essentially a ganache and is plenty sweet and rich enough without cloyingly sweet syrup added to the mix. Both times I bought Trader Joe's "Pound Plus" bittersweet chocolate from Belgium (18 oz for $2.99!) and thought the quality was great.

Exceptional recipe. Good enough for any restaurant.

It gave the dessert a surprising kick. Served to unwitting guests who enjoyed it immensely.

I've made this cake a dozen times at least and I vary it from time to time depending on my mood. Usually use 85% bittersweet cocoa for the cake and add some fresh orange zest along with the vanilla. Make sure that your eggs are room temperature before separating, it gives the cake more loft. whip the yolks and the sugar til its very thick and pale, really pale works the best. The cake will fall and will crack, but no biggie, since that will be your cake bottom. I've added esspresso and orange zest tot he the glaze this time and I will whip it into a gnache for a change.

OMG - I served this as the finishing touch to our Rosh Hashana holiday meal. All I can say is that even though everyone ate heartily, moaning that there was no room left for dessert, my chocoholic friends managed to pack away a second helping of cake. I'd make this as a Passover dessert, just eliminating the corn syrup in the glaze, making more of a ganache with chocolate and cream. I mixed bittersweet and semisweet chocolates and it is REALLY important not to skimp on quality when it comes to the chocolate. Trader Joe's sells 17 oz bars of bitter and semi sweet, very reasonably priced. If you don't want to splurge on Caillebaut, give Trader's a try.

This was the best chocolate cake I have ever made. Had several people over for my husbands birthday and it was a huge hit- restaurant quality. Made the glaze without the syrup and it was fabulous, but the cake really doesn't need the glaze at all. It was great with a dusting of powdered sugar and fresh raspberries. This recipe will definatly go into my all time best recipes book.

Rating: 3
The texture and flavor of this cake were lovely. I used Valhrona 56% and was very happy with the results. I was not totally happy with the cake cosmetically - the rise and fall on my cake were uneven, and it had a huge grand canyon crack. The glaze was also a mess - too thick to pour evenly and too sticky with all that corn syrup to set up at all. A standard melted ganache thinned with milk makes a better glaze. I'll make this cake again but I'm going to try a water bath next time, and I will not butter the sides of the pan - I think that allowed the cake to release and collapse more easily, so instead of straight sides all around, I had a jagged, concave edge as the cake sunk on itself. And pressing the cake edges down is silly- I trimmed it to even it out and remove the crust before inverting it. Of course no one cared what it looked like, but this cake tastes so incredible that hopefully next time it will look perfect as well.

simple, rich, and lovely! Two hints: use bittersweet chocolate- I used 88% cacao. Semisweet will make the cake a sugar bomb. And DO NOT OVERBEAT the egg whites, or you'll end up with a dry cake. Admittedly, I did modify a bit: my oven is unpredicatable, so I checked the cake at 40 min and took it out then. I didn't make the glaze, but I did tweak the recipe a bit: I shredded a ginger root and added it to the batter, and then served the cake with ginger whipped cream. (Put candied ginger and a generous amount of granulated sugar in the food processor, then beat this into heavy cream for ginger whipped cream.)

Please note that the glaze I used for Passover without corn syrup was as follows: 1/4 c. cream and 6 oz. chocolate. It was perfect. This is an easy, elegant dessert. I made this cake again for a casual dinner party using simple Baker's semi-sweet chocolate chunks, which I melted with the butter over simmering water. Like another reviewer, I beat my egg whites first, eliminating the need to wash the beaters, and since the chocolate was already sweet, I cut the added sugar to 8 Tbl. I didn't glaze it at all, just dusted the top with icing sugar. It wasn't as decadent as the first rendition, but still quite lovely.

Rating: 4
Along with some other desserts, I served this to finish our Passover meal, simply omitting the corn syrup from the glaze. I used a 72% cacao content Belgian chocolate and added vanilla and a splash of cognac. It was moist, rich and wonderful, and would be delicious any time of year, holiday or not. I made a side syrup with the first kumquats of the season (thinly sliced kumquats, orange juice, sugar). The contrast of the kumquat tang and the chocolate bittersweetness was like the Red Sea parting all over again, a miracle for the tastebuds. A sliver was sufficient for the 32 guests and there was still a piece left over for breakfast the next morning!

I just might not go back to traditional chocolate cake after this winner! My hubby, who has no sweettooth to speak of, thoroughly enjoyed this. Since it was just the two of us, I reduced the recipe (and cooking time) to 75% for an 8" round. I used a combination of quality 50% and 72% chocolates and served with whipped cream and fresh strawberries. The cake was rich and chocolaty without being overly sweet; it has just the right amount of density to satisfy yet is not too cloying. Also, I used a non-stick pan, buttered well, since I didn't have any parchment or wax paper and had no problems with the bottom releasing.

I have made this many, many times and think it is one of the best chocolate cakes around. I substitute Splenda for the sugar, and instead of the ganash, I use a top-grade bittersweet chocolate (melted) on top and top that with a small amount of toasted coconut. I sometimes then sprinkle with chopped macadamia nuts. My husband thinks it is the best WOW cake I have ever made.

This cake is moist, rich and wonderful. My guests thought I purchased it at the local Patisserie, they raved about it! I added 1/4 cup of Grand Marnier and used only "bittersweet" (not semisweet) chocolate. Also, I did NOT use the glaze. Instead, I just garnished each piece with fresh made whipped cream and orange zest. Make sure you don't over-bake this (I actually under-baked it by 5 minutes).

I modified it using 16 oz. of chocolate and did not separate the eggs. I warmed the eggs in a bowl over hot water for 5 minutes, then off the heat to beat for 10 more minutes before folding to chocolate/butter mixture.

I made this cake for my mom's 75th birthday - big hit with all age groups. It tastes like something from an upscale restaurant, very moist and rich.

We followed the suggestion to only cook it for 41 minutes, and it came out perfectly. We'd definitely make this one again.

Wow... having never tried flourless cake before, I didn't know what to expect but this was magnificent! I also found that it didn't take as long to bake as suggested (maybe why some people are finding it too dry?) I made it for Valentine's Day in a heart shaped pan. I (attempted) to use white chocolate instead of bittersweet for the glaze but it wouldn't set at all so I scraped most of it off, covered the edges in sifted icing sugar and put a big heart shaped centre of raspberry preserves, (outlined in raspberries of course), then topped with chocolate shavings... wow!! Talk about a feast for the senses.. nice presentation, great texture and AWESOME flavor! Try it - you can't go wrong with this one!

Thanx for the hints below about the timing-- I will heed them this time; did the recommended 50 mins and it was just a tiny bit dry. Will serve tonight with almonds and an orange sauce to complement our Middle Eastern buffet. Forget about the chocolate sauce; for my money a contrasting flavor like fruit sets this off better.

This is better than my old flourless cake recipe! I did not press down the edge (it would have made it too dense, but trimmed off the puffy edge (yum). The cake is inverted for serving anyway. "Ice" the top of the cake with raspberry jam and serve with under sweetened whip cream (with a touch of cognac in the cream).

I have never "seperated" an egg before and this recipe came out wonderful. It is VERY, VERY rich. Don't serve your dieting friends. This is an absolutely wonderful recipe and I would make it again and serve it with ice cream next time.

to get some height, this the trick, got it from Julia Childs I think or that Jacques guy. Take the first slab on your spatula and mix it well with the chocolate mixture. The rest fold in gently, DO NOT overmix! The 1st slab will equalize the consistency so that the folding happens with ease. I also cover the pan with foil to avoid burning of the edges. I use either Valhrona or Green & Blacks Organic and get an AAAA+++++ cake everytime! Email me at maldades04@yahoo.com if you need tips on this recipe, I have made it over a hundred times, maybe a thousand, lol! Enjoy, this is my favorite dessert of all!

Rich, decadent, and truly a chocolate lover's dream. Followed the recipe as written, except baked for only 41 minutes (used an oven thermometer and the toothpick came out clean at 41 minutes). I had no problems with the cake being dry or having uneven sides. Because the cake is sooo rich, I highly recommend serving small slices with vanilla icecream, raspberry coulis and fresh raspberries. Excellent recipe...your family and friends will love you even more for making this. This is a definite keeper.

I've made this recipe many times. When I am more careful about folding in the egg whites (and not breaking them), I have a higher cake - it always settles down to just over an inch though. That's the nature of the cake. Because of the settling, the sides are always uneven, so the glaze it needed to make it look presentable. A huge hit whenever I cook it. Crucial to use good chocolate too, it makes a difference in cooking and taste.

I am a novice baker and this was one of my first cakes. I chose it because my husband absolutely loves flourless chocolate cakes, and with all of the wonderful restaurants and bakeries here in New York City, he certainly has tasted excellent flourless chocolate cakes. This cake tasted delicious, and my husband said it was on par, if not better, than the best flourless chocolate cake he has ever had. The consistency and tase were just perfect. I will definitely make it again for the two of us. However, I had two problems, and maybe someone can help me solve them for next time. First, the cake came out very thin, only about an inch high. Also, the sides of the cake were not smooth, so they looked messy (I did not cover it with any glaze, I just sprinkled the top with confectioner's sugar). I really do not know why these two things happened. But, as I said, I am just a beginner, and this tasted like a pro baked it, so I love this recipe and will make it again.

This cake has a wonderful rich, smooth chocolate flavor. I followed the recipe carefully, but after the recommended baking time of 50 minutes, the toothpick still yielded runny batter so I baked it closer to 65, checking it every 5 mins. In trying to achieve the toothpick test with "moist crumbs" I overbaked it. Glazed and chilled the next day, it had a tendency to crumble. Even still, it tasted wonderful.

I've made this cake twice. Once I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious, and the next time I wanted a little variety so I finely grated the rind of one orange and folded it in just before baking the cake. It had a very rich flavor and everyone loved it. I will definitely do the same thing again.

Made this cake the first time for a birthday. Got raves from everybody! I liked the recipe. It was very detailed and that made it easy to follow. I may never make a chocolate cake with flour again. I laminate my favorite recipes and this was is a going to be saved and shared. The only problem I had was no left over cake for the next day!

cake came out simply scrumptious! even better a few days after. very rich and moist compared to others i made before. i love nuts so i added 1/2 cup of chopped almonds to the batter. important not to underbake it. i didn't use corn syrup since i didnt want a very sweet cake. instead i added a tablespoon of sugar for glaze.

I didn't follow the steps correctly, and ended up with a rather lumpier glaze than I suspect is common, but otherwise there were no problems. I made a mango sauce for this (the birthday girl loves mangoes). She's lived in France, Belgium, and regularly travels the world. She said, "I am not flattering you. This is, without a doubt, the best cake I have ever had." And, no, we're not even dating, so it's not that.

Not only am I not a baker, but I'm married to a chocoholic whose a fantastic baker. But I promised to make her a dessert for her birthday, and this was my attempt. Our guests (and my wife) raved about it, and my wife constantly requests that I make it again. Can't miss recipe, IMHO.

Very tasty. 0. Why chop the chocolate? You can melt big blocks of chocolate easily in a double-boiler setup. Get two pots that fit over each other; boil water in one, then place the second pot on top and throw in the chocolate, stirring frequently. Then add in the butter. 1. Beware of seizing chocolate. Chocolate and water do not mix. 2. Don't underbake. Cracks are OK, really. It's crispy on the bottom and light on the top. 3. The corn syrup in the glaze gives it a slightly different taste from the cake. You want that contrast, or else the glaze will suck!

Rating: 3
works quite well, would suggest underbeating whites to avoid making it too light and dry. best if made several days before. I substituted some callebaut cocoa and extra butter for a percentage of the chocolate to make it extra dark and delicious.

Rating: 2
Be careful not to overbeat the egg whites, or the cake will be dry (as mine was). Might have overcome this mistake had I used the glaze. This improved with age - was best two and three days after it was made, but not the best flourless chocolate cake I've ever tasted.

Rating: 4
Takes a little time, but well worth the effort. Suggest slices be small, as it is quite rich. I drizzled chocolate sauce in a lattice pattern on dessert plate then added a dollop of whipped cream to top off the cake. It's pretty and fills up the plate without being "too much".

Fabulous! My husband said it was the best cake he has ever eaten! I took other reviewers advice and rather than make the glaze, used raspberry coulis, whipped heavy cream, and fresh raspberries. I used Ghiridelli bittersweet chocolate, mmm... Melts in your mouth!

EXCELLENT! Like others who have reviewed this recipe, I did not use the glaze but rather opted for raspberry coulis and whipped cream. I also took the advice of another reviewer who suggested beating the egg whites first. It made the balance of the recipe much easier to coordinate. Outstanding results every time. This one is a keeper. Perfect for my sister and niece who have gluten allergies.

This is such a great recipe. I've made it a half dozen times now and it never ceases to wow everyone. This time I used a pretty stencil on top of the cake and sprinkled powdered sugar on top of the stencil.

I was going for the richest, densest cake recipe that I could find, and while this wasn't quite the densest I've ever eaten, it was certainly rich. People asked for seconds and thirds and the richness knocked them off their feet. If you crave a chocolate high (or a kick in the face, or whatever you want to call it), this is your recipe.

This cake is easy to make and always gets rave reeviews! I use Valrhona bittersweet (71% Cacao), organic butter and organic cane sugar. I sometimes substitute Orange extract for the vanilla and it is very nice. I also often frost it with fresh whipped cream (I add a little Grand Marnier tot he cream), and a raspberry coulis makes this cake a hit everytime! Enjoy!

This cake was easy to make and good, but not with that great taste of chocolate I was looking forward to. It was very dense and rich. No one asked for seconds. If you want a light flourless chocolate cake that your guests can't get enough of try the Traditional French Chocolate Cake in the book called French Cuisine For All. It's so wonderful it doesn't need any glaze or frosting. I simply give it a slight dusting of powered sugar. If you like it light instead of dense, you've got to try it.

Oh MY! Looked great and tasted even better. My husband is bragging to all his workers about it. So rich, moist, easy to make.

This is an extremely rich cake that you need to slice in thin slices because a little goes a long way! I made it exactly per the recipe and it was delicious. It uses a lot of chocolate and I had about 3/4 C of ganache left, so I used some to pipe flowers onto the top. At first I piped them onto wax paper but had a hard time getting them off to transfer them, so then I just did it directly onto the cake - maybe not as fancy as gold-painted leaves, but it looked very pretty =)

Whenever I need to make a quick yet impressive dessert for some occasion this is the recipe I turn to. It is very easy and tastes like you worked harder than you did. It has a nice velvet-like texture, rich, dense, smooth, but too cloying for me if I eat it alone. I've made it several times with the same great results, but I've never made the chocolate glaze, I wonder if I'm missing out. I love it warm with vanilla ice cream.

Rating: 4
My favorite recipe in epicurious... Made it for Passover too and everyone loved it (to the point I was requested to bring it again to the next party). To make the leaves - stuff easier just bought some thin, heart shaped chocolate pieces, placed them atop the cake and painted them with edible gold paint. It was the most spectacular cake... EVER!!!

I've traditionally hated Passover desserts. This cake was wonderful, and was a huge hit at last year's seder. I'm making it again this year. I'll make the glaze/ganache with just chocolate and cream, leaving out the corn syrup. I served it with a fresh raspberry sauce, and it was delicious.

Wow! This cake (if you can call it a cake), was fantastic! My husband said that it was the best fourless cake he has ever had in any restaurant. I saved about a cup of the glaze since it seemed that there was plenty of glaze already covering the cake. The leftover glaze is delicious to re-heat and pour over ice cream for later treats.

After reading many other choc.flourless cake recipes I decided that this seemed the least time consuming (with fewest ingredients). The only alteration I made was with the pan, I used a heart shaped springform pan and was a bit worried as to the volume (no indication as to fill pan 1/2 full etc). Any way, the batter filled 1/2 to 2/3 of the pan, and when fully cooked, just reached to the top. I followed all other directions exactly and it was quite a success.

I live in Holland where great chocolates are the norm. This cake tasted like one great big chocolate bonbon. I was very impressed with the results and stunned my husband with it for his birthday.

A fine recipe. However, it makes at least twice as much glaze as can possibly be applied to the cake. It was a shame to toss the extra, but pouring it on the cake would have made an unappetizing mess.

The cake turned out well and was good but too rich for my taste (I used half extra-dark 72% chocolate, so maybe it was my fault). For a great chocolate cake, I like the molten chocolate cake with mint sauce in Bon Appetit January 2001 (or 2000?).

I have a friend who is a celiac which means she cannot eat anything containing gluten. I made this cake when she came for dinner. It was a huge hit! She loved it as did all my other guests.

I baked this a week ahead of time, planning to freeze it for a dessert buffet. The top fell so much (crumbled, really) that I was convinced it was a disaster, but I stuck it in the freezer anyway. I took it out yesterday, inverted and glazed it, and - surprise! - it looked PERFECT and everyone loved it. This recipe is absolutely foolproof - will make anyone look like a professional pastry chef.

I have made this recipe dozens of times, always to rave reviews. It's great for Passover!! Foolproof and delicious.

The better the quality of the chocolate you use, the better the cake will be.

I too made this cake for Valentine's Day. The cake is very easy to make and most delicious! I took the advice of other reviewers and used high quality chocolate (a combo of Scharfenberger and Hawaiian Vintage Chocolate). I did not make the glaze, instead serving it with whipped cream which helped cut the richness. Four days later, the cake is still moist and holding up well. Highly recommended!

Made this for V-day with Coeur a la Creme with Raspberry Sauce on the side and it was wonderful. Beware, the cake is really rich, but plates beautifully. I used a cake pan lined with parchment paper on the sides and bottom rather than a springform and it came out just fine. It does fall quite a bit, but the cake is moist enough to press down flat. The glaze spreads nicely and creates a lovely finish.

Made 1/2 of this recipe since it is just my husband and I. Made it in a 6" springform pan. Very sorry I did not make the entire recipe! Served it without the ganache and instead 1/2 raspberry coulis and 1/2 hot fudge sauce (also from this site, had it in the fridge) on the plate, with hearts of the opposite in each sauce, then, two tiny wedges of the cake in opposition across the plate. Imagine the beauty! I used ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate and it was great. I might drop by the Italian deli to get some callebut or something for the next one, the chocolate can only get better with the quality of it. Oh, and I overbeat my egg whites (new Kitchen Aid 5 quart mixer) and used the Epicurious hint to add another, unbeaten one to the mixture...perfection! Next time will make the ganache with Grand Marnier or Chambord or even Kaluha!

Oh my goodness!!! My boyfriend made this for me for Valentine's Day. After an amazing dinner of spinach salad and lobster, we were both full and planned on splitting a piece for dessert, but all it took was one bite and we each got our OWN piece, topped with some chocolate mousse and a little raspberry sauce. We skipped the glaze, but the cake was AMAZING - my co-workers agree, and I'm sure his will too. Be warned - take a tiny piece - the cake is REALLY rich, but oh so worth it!!!

I'm no Julia Childs, but this cake turned out beautifully for me! I couldn't believe how easy it was, especially considering the quality of the results.

So what if we gain a pound or two after tonight. It was worth it!

I burned the top a bit, then immediately drove 45 minutes to a friend's house, letting it cool in the car. Had to cut off the outside inch of the top. When I turned it over, I accidentally smushed the heck out of it. Used the friend's kitchen to make the glaze in an ultra-hurry. With all of this weirdness, and the fact that I used Baker's semisweet chocolate, it was still an amazing hit. Everyone loved it. Next time I will try some better chocolate, only for fun's sake, as this was wonderful the way it was. And I might make a tiny bit of white chocolate glaze to dribble over the top -- the little slices looked so lonely in the middle of the desert plate. An awesome recipe that you can even mess up and still delight people with.

One word: sinful! Okay, another word: fabulous! The cake was easy to prepare and moist. I tried making it in individual tartlet pans and that didn't work well (anyone have suggestions on baking times?), but, I would absolutely make this again using the recommended springform pan. My family raved that eating this cake was like getting a dessert from a 4-star restaurant!

This cake has made me famous! I highly recommend using the best imported dark chocolate money can buy. Also, for a decadent touch which this cake worthy of, apply real gold leaf in a free form design around the top edge of the glazed cake. (Gold leaf can be purchased at art supply stores. Make sure it's the purest you can find, typically 23 and 3/4 carats.) Serve with a nice glass of port and enjoy!

I've made this twice for birthday parties and my husband made it for a dinner party. It's very easy to do and looks so impressive! Everybody loved it and wanted the recipe. After chopping chocolate the first time, I used the bags of Nestle's tollhouse chocolate chips instead-much easier! Also my husband's trick to trace around the pan with the parchment paper underneath, made it easier to fit the paper inside the pan--Something I was not figuring out how to do easily!

Oh, yum! This cake was great! I used milk chocolate (my hubbie's favorite) in the cake and semi-sweet for the glaze and it received rave reviews. I did have to adjust the time for an additional 10 minutes, maybe from the milk chocolate. I also used the time saving tip of whipping the egg whites before the egg yolks, one less wash. Definitely a keeper.

This may be the perfect chocolate cake recipe. Everyone who tastes it loves it. One diabetic guest kept having to inject himself with insulin so he could have additional helpings. Tonight I made the cake and glaze, and then lightly drizzled the slices with a raspberry coulis. The slight tartness of the coulis was a nice addition.

Rating: 4
I have been making flourless cakes for the past 20 years and this recipe is near perfect. The only thing I needed to adjust was to add aprx 10 mins on cook time (prob due to my oven). I was a little leary of the glaze however it tasted excellent, slightly thinner than a ganache but easy to work with after letting it cool a bit. If you are a novice at baking you will succeed at this one. Don't let the 2 negative reviews disuade you (they obviously don't have a clue). I made this today for a dear friend's bday and decorated it with fresh baby roses...it was spectacular! Serve it with unsweetened whipped cream or a raspberry sauce and you will be a chocoholics hero.

I made this for my mother for mothers day, it was a big hit. It melts in your mouth!! I used "Baker's" bittersweet chocolate from the grocery store and it tasted wonderful. I used a previous reviewers advice and whipped the egg whites before the yolks so no chance of having dirty/wet mixers.

Wow!!! Heaven!! Worth all the effort. Looks like a magazine picture and tastes just as good. Everyone raved about it. It is too rich for some, but even they have a hard time putting their fork down. This is the cake to impress!

Oh MY GOODNESS! If you know anyone with bad PMS or debilitating chocolate cravings, this one's for you! So rich and chocolately...this recipe doesn't waste anytime on flour! What a way to showcase the beauty and sensuality of chocolate.

Made this for Easter to celebrate my son's birthday. He wanted chocolate, so he got it! I dressed it up a bit, used fresh mint leave stems and dipped them in chocolate, then layed them on the caked, also, fresh mint leaves, small one's worked wonderful! For the flowers I used raspberries! What a wonderful combination, what raspberries were left over I rolled in chocolate and refrigerated, served them on the side with the cake and Mint Chocolate chip ice cream! It's rich, but not sickning, light and full of flavor. My oldest already put an order in for one when his birthday comes around in November!

This is my favorite flourless chocolate cake recipe. I use Lindt 70% chocolate bars and it has a rich chocolate flavor. It goes great with raspberry sauce. My fiance won't order chocolate desserts in restaurants anymore because he says nothing compares with this cake!

Yummy and easy. I made this cake for my mother-in-law's birthday, and everyone wanted second slices. It makes way too much chocolate glaze, more than could be spread on the cake, but the glaze is terrific on ice cream. Cut the glaze to 2/3 or so to avoid having any left. I live in the UK; golden syrup was a good substitute for the corn syrup, and "plain chocolate" with a little less sugar worked instead of semi-sweet or bittersweet.

It was to easy for the quality of cake. I would rate it higher than 4 forks. I added fresh raspberries to decorate and a light dusting of powdered sugar. ENJOY THIS ONE :-)

I made this for my husband and my Valentine's Day dinner--we both work so I grabed ingredients after leaving the office, ran home and started melting chocolate in a mad rush. I am not a confident cook, and also very lazy--yet miraculously this cake was an enormous hit. I didn't use parchment paper, or line the outside of the pan. The biggest mistake I made was over whipping the egg whites. When our neighboors popped over for a glass of wine and dessert at the last minute--all was right with the world. Great, fast and impressive dessert. I'm making it for hub's birthday tonight!

This cake has become a famous dessert in my house.I find that the people whos had problems with it its because they didnt read it CAREFULLY.Use bittersweet chocolate as the recipe directs and the whites have to be beaten with sugar so they dont dry and remain flexible.Be careful with your oven, it may take a little bit more baking.Its so easy and so delicious!!!!

Rating: 4
Ohmygoodness this is a wonderful cake!! I was a little surprised by it, but not at all disappointed. It rose quite high while baking, but turned out that the height was all crust and inside was a heavy layer of dense, moist chocolate (yay!) Instead of pushing the crust down, we just cut it level and ate the crust crumbs... :) I used Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate for both the cake and the glaze and it was perfect! I must say I'm the laziest cook in the world, so I changed the order of a couple things... I beat the egg whites first and then the yolks, so I didn't have to be so careful about the beaters being clean, I added all the sugar before beating instead of half-way through (on the whites) and I didn't do the thirds for folding, just a little to lighten and then dump it back in. I might have had a lighter cake had I followed the instructions, but dense was my goal and I loved it! I didn't find the glaze instructions too bad, either and I was really pretty impressed how well the glaze set up at room temperature (I didn't want to chill it, since the humidity around here tends to leave a bit of water on anything coming out of the fridge). I did use light corn syrup instead of dark (the lid was stuck on the dark!) -- I don't know what kind of difference that would make... Now if only I knew more people who weren't on diets I could arrange to eat this once a week! *sigh*

I carefully followed recipe directions, using Callebaut chocolate, and tested it for doneness after baking it 50 min. as the recipe stated, but it was still liquid in the center (under a crusted top), as it was at 55 minutes. At 1 hour, the cake tester showed very moist crumbs so I removed it from the oven to cool. The cake was anticlimatic, being definitely on the dry side when served. The glaze was delicious, and the cake flavor good, but the texture disappointing. I may try it one more time, baking it only 50 minutes but allowing it to cool partially in the oven, as when baking a cheesecake. This might let it set up sufficiently without drying out, but if the outcome is no better the second time, this recipe will be history. The flavor was excellent, VERY chocolatey, but it needed more moistness to please the non-chocoholics, even served with vanilla ice cream.

This just did not turn out well... The cake tasted like an eggy mush- and the glaze tasted like corn syrup. I thought everything was going well until I tasted it!

I cannot understand why everyone is so crazy about this cake. My entire family are dyed-in-the-wool chocoholics and NO ONE liked this cake. It is way to bitter. I remade it using all semi-sweet chocolate and it was SO much better. And instead of all this changung plates and freezing the glaze, I added 1 cup of powdered sugar to the glaze after the chocolate had melted, beat it well for about 2 minutes and poured it on the top of the cake and pushed it over to the sides to drip down the sides of the cake. After the cake has cooled completely, just turn it over in your left hand and remove the bottom of the cake pan and the wax or parchment paper and put it on a large plate. Slip strips of wax paper under the cake, all around, leaving about 2" of the paper sticking out from under the cake. After the frosting...or glaze firms up, simply remove the strips of paper. The instructions for icing this cake are way more complicated than it should be.

I have made this several times, and my mother has asked for the recipe and made the cake for friends several times. It is the easiest and best cake ever. keep up the good work. I started getting bon appetite magazines from the time if finished high school in the "70's and still cook from them now.

WOW!!! I prepared this recipe as is, using Hershey's Special Dark chocolate as my local shop didn't have Valrhona. Added Grand Marnier to the glaze. Took it to a dinner party and it was devoured in no time - almost before the main course. Only somewhat negative comment was from a 14 year old present who said it was too chocolately - since when is that a problem? This is going to be my mainstay dessert for a while.

It is great to make for those special occasions or just for a sinful treat around the house! I can understand why this received recipe of the year! BRAVO!

A huge hit. Everyone loved it. Very easy to make without a huge effort. Use the best chocolate you can. I put a spiral of melted white chocolate on top and marbelized it for a nice professional looking presentation. I did experiment with making the whole thing with white chocolate, so you don't have too, it was disgusting!

I've made this recipe for many different people. It is a winner every time. Sometimes I vary it a hare & add different coffe flavors to it or cinnamon works great too.

Great recipe and I had to make it twice for our Christmas. We live at approximately 5000 feet altitude and the first verson was half-baked, literally, despite upping the temp up 20 degrees. I cooked version #2 for an additinal 40 minutes. Worth the extra trouble, even better served with ice cream and strawberries. And, if you have a half-baked flop to work with just mix it with some Haagen Daz vanilla.

Hmmm, yummy!!! I made this recipe last Christmas gave two away,& kept one for our celebration. I am not a huge chocolate fan, but this is an exceptional cake. Pretty easy to make, and the friends that recieved the cake were quite impressed.I came back to get the recipe to make three more this year. Indulge and enjoy!!

This cake was absolutely delicious - and easy to make. I used a Ghiradeli (sp?) chocolate - semi-sweet for the cake and bitter-sweet for the ganache and served it with raspberry gelato on the side. I was pressed for time, so I threw it into the freezer for about five minutes before glazing it to speed up the cooling process - it worked great, hardly any ran off the cake! I know I'll be making this again!

My boyfriend said this was better than the delectable flourless chocolate cake we had at a favorite restaurant. I used 8 oz. bitter sweet and 1 oz. of white chocolate for the glaze. Divine!

I love it!! It is easy, excellent, and always memorable. I like to give this cake as a birthday present-- it's so easy to creatively decorate and transport. Advice: do not serve warm. Once, pressed for time, I served this cake without chilling it. It tastes much better and has a better texture after cooling. Totally rich and chocolatey, yet somehow lighter in texture than most flourless cakes. It's perfect, and your guests will worship you for serving it!

I made this recipe Sunday, before Labor Day and served it to my friends who were celebrating their anniversary. It turned out absolutely beautiful - including the chocolate leaves; however, I was unable to find the gold dust in my town. It is the best dessert I ever made. It is a lot of work, and the glazing process was somewhat messy. I covered a large baking sheet with foil and literally poured the glaze on. I would definitely make this again, when I have the time.

This is dense, flourless, insanely rich chocolate cake much like creations called "chocolate decadence," "death by chocolate," "life by chocolate," etc. It is marvelously easy and truly worth the caloric intake.

This cake is like a gift to me! Being a newly diagnosed celiac and not being able to have anything with wheat, rye, barley, or oats (hence, NO FLOUR), what a treat to find this recipe. I made it for our family's Mother's Day celebration May 2000 and, even though everyone was skeptical at first, they RAVED about the cake. The only change I made was to use gluten-free vanilla extract which took nothing away from the flavor or texture. Now, when someone asks me what I can have for dessert, it's easy to answer. THANKS!

I made this for New Year's Eve, along with Bon Appetit's Cranberry Cheesecake with Cranberry-Raspberry Compote. I served the compote with BOTH desserts-- its tartness was a wonderful counterpoint to the richness of this dessert. Also, I made chocolate holly and ivy leaves to decorate the sides and the top of the cake. The final extravagance was sprinkling it with gold leaf-- very expensive, but New Year's Eve 2000 deserved something special!

for the person, that wanted this recipe for Passover. I've done it. It is a great hit! Instead of corn syrup just use the cream and chocolate-it will be a ganache and simply divine. I usually just dust it with confectionary sugar. Since this is so rich, this is enough.

This is the only true chocoholic's cake I've experienced with a very deep, rich chocolate flavor. Can be too sweet, but I reduced the sugar and it was great. If you use a dark metal springform pan, make sure you reduce cooking time or it will be dry.

I read all of these rave reviews about this cake and was so thrilled to make it for my husband's birthday. I've made other flourless choc. cakes before. However, it came out NASTY. It was so dry it needed to be eaten with a spoon. I made the cake according to the recipe. The only place I can imagine I might have erred is that I may have made my whites too stiff. Would that be enough to totally kill this cake? Any ideas?

The glaze makes a very nice professional looking finish. I used semi-sweet jumbo chips in place of the squares (much more economical). I cut the sugar in the egg white back to 4 tbsp and would eliminate entirely next time (or use bittersweet chocolate) for a dessert that was not as sweet. Served with whipped cream and whole toasted almond garnish.

I prepared this cake for my husband's 50th birthday. I slightly changed the glaze recipe by using 3/4 c. whipping cream and 1/4 c. of corn syrup. I couldn't stand the thought of 1/2 c. corn syrup. Additionally, I decorated the top of the glaze with fresh raspberries standing on end and lightly dusted it with pwdr. sugar and grated bittersweet chocolate. It looked absolutely beautiful. I'm going to prepare this at Thanksgiving for my "show stopping" chocolate dessert that is always requested.

A beautiful cake for company, my guests thought it was done by a professional. However, it came out better baked in a 10 inch springform (there was less cracking and collapsing of the top), and I substituted my favorite ganache glaze (1 cup heavy cream, 8 oz. bittersweet chocolate).

If you like chocolate, then this is very worthwhile. I served this for a birthday cake, but I would suggest something on the side to "cut" it a bit - like whipped cream, ice cream, raspberry sauce. It's quick, and pretty easy to make, and was a hit with all 15 party goers...

Love rich chocolate cakes, but this was overly sweet for my liking. This was just like eating a hunk of chocolate! Would have been nice if there had been another flavor introduced, since this was so overly sweet. My family and I are HUGE chocolate fans, but this recipe lacked depth within the chocolate. It was just so sweet it could make you sick to your stomach if you ate too much. Would not recommend to anyone, since I know there are much richer and better recipes that do exist.
