I loved this! I used Trader Joe's Lentils from the produce section - they are already cooked and ready to go in a bag. I added carrots cut into circles with the squash at the beginning. I used extra spinach since it shrinks so much in the soup. Use plenty of salt and pepper and it is excellent...the tomatoes are key...if they are not red and ripe, better to use canned diced tomatoes! I used tomatoes from the garden and they were very flavorful. I went light on the curry and my 5 year old loved it...it's the only time I was able to get her to eat spinach!

A couple of changes addressed the concerns from 2002, instead of plum tomatoes use heirloom type. Also try improvising your own curry powder by mixing coriander, ground cumin, ground ginger, cinnamon, and cloves with whatever else you prefer. Lentils usually do not cook in less than 40 minutes so try cooking them with vegetable bouillon while your doing the chopping or set them to soak in the morning for extra tender lentils at night.

This dish was very aesthetically pleasing with the bright red, yellow, and green. Unfortunately, the taste did not live up to its appearance. It was rather bland and boring, and even though I cooked it longer than indicated, the lentils were still too hard. I will look for a different lentil soup recipe before making this one again.

Very easy and quick to prepare. I used canned lentils which reduced the cooking time by a bit and added quite a bit more spinach. Will definitely make this again.
