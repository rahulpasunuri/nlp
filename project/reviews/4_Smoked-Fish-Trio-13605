By far, one of my all time favorite recipes! Have been serving this for special occasions since it first appeared in Gourmet in 1996. If you want to impress guests, follow recipe exactly as written, no changes necessary! I don't say this about many recipes, this one is worth 5 forks!

when I made this in the summer, I had extras of the smoked trout mousse which I froze. Yesterday I thawed the extra and served it at an open house. The mousse held up fantastically and was a hit again.

Made this on Saturday for a dinner party for 20 - a SMASH hit. The combination of colours, flavours and textures really works. We didn't add the salad because we were having a separate salad course, but did use the chive oil as a garnish - don't omit it, it pulls all the flavours together. I used a mini-muffin tray to create individual mousse' and next time would put the sesame seeds in the bottom of tray to help with turning them out. The anchovy toasts are a keeper.
