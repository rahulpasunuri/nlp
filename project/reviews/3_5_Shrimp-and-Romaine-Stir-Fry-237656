Love making this dish. I do take the shrimp out before the romaine. You can easily add things to this, I like it as is,sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds when serving. Yummy!

I have to admit this was better than I thought it was going to be. I did as other reviewers did and removed the shrimp and added them back in at the end, which worked well. I also waited until the first batch of lettuce was fairly wilted before adding the second round, so the second round was still crunchy when served and I think this added to it with two different textures. The sauce itself is was good and decently spicy, and I could see using that with other stir fries. I'm keeping this one around for a quick and easy lunch/dinner or if I have too much lettuce on hand, but not one I'd make for guests.

Made this last night and was totally surprised at how easy - and GREAT - it was. Substituted water with adobo seasoning for the chicken stock, agave syrup for the sugar, used powdered ginger instead of fresh and added sesame seeds to the shrimp when cooking. I followed cooking/timing instructions to a tee and ended up with crisp, perfectly cooked shrimp in a sweet and sour sauce. I will definitely make this again!

This tasted delicious when fresh and hot but leftovers were non-appealing with the wilted romaine.

Solid stir fry, but I messed with the proportions... kept everything the same but reduced the red pepper flakes (and I like spicy food) and shrimp for 2 ppl. Added green onion because I wanted to use it up. Truly a ten minute meal.

I make this all the time and have used chicken and other vegetables substituted for the shrimp and romaine. The sauce is fabulous and very flexible.

Made this last night and agree that the shrimp should be removed prior to adding the romaine and returned to the pan along with the sauce mixture. Before serving I sprinkled some toasted sesame seeds over the top. We both enjoyed this very much, and my husband said it tasted and looked like a dish in an oriental restaurant.

This was excellent, and very easy to make. I never thought of using romaine lettuce in stir-fry before. I will make this again for sure.

This was quick, easy and good. I used red pepper, celery, carrots, cabbage and snow peas since I didn't have any romaine. Also added some cilantro and cashews. Everyone liked it, including my kids. Will definitely make it again.

What a fabulous and quick meal to make! This is definitely a keeper! The only suggestion I would make is to remove the shrimp after it's done (since it cooks fast) and then add it back to the pan once the romaine is cooked/wilted to your liking. This will keep the shrimp from overcooking. But I will definitely make this again!

The sauce on this is delicious. I modified the other ingredients quite a bit (thought I had romaine at home) substituted bell peppers, broccoli and white mushrooms in the stir fry. Delicious - - just enough kick to keep it interesting - and most of the other sauce ingredients I had on hand. Will definitely use this sauce as a base for stir fry's again in the future.

I never would have thought of romaine, but had it on hand and it was a nice addition. I will definitely make this again and try some of the additions others have mentioned. Fast and easy!

Loved the taste. My husband did not care for the Romaine. Next time I will try Bok Choy and adding other vegetables like carrots, onion, peppers and pineapple.

I halved the recipe very successfully. What a great quick meal. As mentioned, the romaine must be cooked at the very last minute. Sauce is a real mouth warmer - I used ground red pepper flakes rather than whole flakes.

Yum....4 forks for the easy factor. Added shitakes, savory tofu, and cashews to the shrimp/romaine mixture and added sauce before the romaine to maximize crunch factor. Also added a bit of oyster sauce to the sauce mix and left out the chicken broth, using a bit of water instead. I might slightly reduce the soy sauce next time, especially if I use the savory tofu again....a delicious, relatively healthy and extremely easy weeknight meal!

Great recipe! I added Sriracha, sesame oil and shitake mushrooms, and served over Jasmine rice. It was a hit!

Quick and delicious! Added some avacado that we had forgotten the night before. Nice addition even if by accident.

This was way better than I had ever expected! The sauce is great too! Kids asked for second helpings...I'd definitely make again.

Pretty good, both flavor and texture. Be sure to add the romaine only when you know everyone will be at the table in minutes. The slight crunch is wonderful, but it fades quickly if you are trying to keep the dish warm for more than 5 minutes.
