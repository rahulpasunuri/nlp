Make this with Black Raspberries instead of Red Raspberries and it will blow your mind! Last year I had picked black raspberries and wasn't sure what to do with them so I substituted them for red in this recipe and it is so much better. After the first one went so fast I was requested to make another but all that was available were red raspberries. It was good but not as good as the first made with the black. I picked double batches of black raspberries this year and I've made this tart four times now and it is always great.Everyone loves it. Make sure you double the crust recipe as I always ran out when I followed their directions. I use an 11 inch pan and this tart is polished off every time.

Bit of a disappointment. I doubled the recipe and the raspberry totally overwhelmed whatever almond taste there was. I may have used too much raspberry.

Like other reviewers I had some issues with this crust, the raspberry filling was fine though the almond mixture was not as tasty as I had hoped.

Really delicious, with other combinations of berries added. The crust, being very thin, was somewhat difficult to handle, but the end result was delicious.

Great dessert! Added lemon zest to the filling. I've made this a few times alternating painting the bottom of crust with dark chocolate or sometimes drizzling it on top.

This basically came out tasting like a raspberry pop tart. It wasn't horrible; just nothing special. I would not make this again. There are many other better tart recipes on epicurious.

really good. I only have a larger tart pan (11 inches, I think), so I made a recipe-and-a-half, and it turned out great. "Best desert ever", said my wife.

this recipe was fabulous! i found the lattice top a little difficult to work with, so i think next time i will double the dough recipe. i thought the amount of sugar in the filling was perfect- but the raspberries i was using were very sweet on their own. i also added a couple ounces of almond paste to the almond mixture and it turned out great!

Delicious! Preparing the filling in advance and using a store- bought pie crust made quick work of this dessert the night I had company. Used nearly twice the filling called for and the amount of sugar seemed just right given the sweetness of the berries. Skipped the lattice and distributed the almond mixture over the top. Worked out very nicely. Everyone loved it served with a small scoop of chocolate ice cream. Will use pastry dough recommended in recipe next time.

This was awesome. I made it for friends and it was a hit. I wanted to make a fancy lattice crust so I just used my own recipe (2 c flour, 2/3 c butter, 1/2 t salt, 5 T water) and I don't have a tart pan so I used a 9" pie pan. I was afraid there wasn't enough filling but it was fine. Also, I just baked it at 375 for 35 minutes (or less) - no prebaking the pie shell. The almond layer at the bottom is wonderful and really complements the raspberries. It was very easy the way I did it.

The tart is tasty, but nothing special. Although there are many steps to the recipe, each is fairly simple. I make the raspberry filling and pastry dough a day in advance, and then assembled the tart the next evening.

We love this one! Our favorite thing to do with all our raspberries.

This is one of my favorite desserts. I do use a different crust though. The tart looks much more appetizing in real life than it does in this picture. I made mini tarts - everyone loves them.

The taste of fresh raspberries and ground almonds worked very well but a big disappointment in this recipe was the crust. Although it is lighter than others in butter content, it is not impressive in taste or in texture, at least for me. Maybe more experienced bakers have found it more appealling.

This was the first recipe that I made off of epicurious, and I was very impressed. The tart came out looking even better than it did in the picture and it was delicious, to say the least. The subtle almond taste blended very well with the tartness of the raspberry.

made this for father's day at my father-in-law's request for a raspberry dessert. RAVES from everyone at the table, even from those who "don't like this sort of thing." used roll-out pie crust and added more sugar to the berries as recommended by other reviewers. i'll be making it again tomorrow.

Everyone who eats this tart LOVES it! Excellent. I cheated and used a pre-made pie crust rolled very thin, and used the trimming to make the lattice. But it makes the whole process so much easier! I also used 3/4 cup sugar to make the tart sweeter and it turns out great everytime!

An amazing dessert that will impress all! I added a raspberry coulis to paint the plate and served it with vanilla ice cream to tone down the tartness.

Made this for a baby shower and it was a huge hit. The dough was a bit tough to work with (especially in hot weather), but it turned out ok. Be sure to keep it chilled except when rolling it out. Raspberry filling was a bit too tart for my taste so I'd use more sugar or riper berries next time.

More work than I intended, but mostly worth it. Even with a few mishaps, especially with the crust, it came out looking wonderful. I was more than pleased when it tasted just as good as it looked. Definitely worth doing again.

I made this dish yesterday. The raspberry filling was tart and the almond filling added nicely to the flavor. The pastry was flaky and held its form (but seemed to take a long time to make). I substituted a pie dish for the fluted tart pan and it seemed to turn out just as well.
