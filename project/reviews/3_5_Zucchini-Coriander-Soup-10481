Absolutely delicious. I make it all the time and can't believe that such simple ingredients create such a fabulous flavor. I serve it heated up with some homemade croutons.

This soup has no business being this good!! I used zucchini & lemon from the garden but after reading the last review I used store bought organic cilantro because mine is too strongly flavored. I never realized zucchini and cilantro have such an affinity. Husband went crazy for this (the self-professed zucchini abstainer!!) If it's flavorless like some have said it just needs salt throughout the cooking process and a bit more lemon juice.

I don't know if I did something wrong, but this was AWFUL. The coriander was bitter and overwhelming. Wished I had not put it in -- had to throw away the whole batch, which was a shame, because before the coriander went in, it tasted good. Better luck to others

Oh yes, I also added half of a jalapeno pepper, chopped.

This is surprisingly good! I used 1 zucchini, 1 yellow squash, and 2 small patty pans,a whole onion, a nice clove of garlic and about 2 cups of broth, plus the lemon juice and 3T of half and half. A word to the wise: be sure to chop the coriander before putting in the blender, or you will have complications! I didn't, and made a big mess, ending up with use of blender AND food processor. So much for impatience, but the end result was delicious.

Amazing! I added some roasted cumin seeds and the zest of a lemon. I would definitely repeat this again and would add chopped zucchini flowers on the top ,when its available in the summer. I am planning to make more for friends.

This is an excellent recipe for using up surplus zucchini, AND it's delicious! I added a clove of garlic and omitted the water. This will become a summer staple for me.

Very good, very easy soup. I added 2 chopped garlic cloves to the onions, used half chicken and half veggie bouillion (that's what I had on hand) and put in a dollop of yogurt to serve. Next time I'll make a double batch!

This is a keeper! I used less liquid, only enough to cover the zucchini. Result was light, subtle and delicious.

This is a tasty easy recipe, especially when using a stick blender. I did add about 1.25 cups of water as noted in the recipe directions, and didn't find the soup to be too watery. I also added about 2 tbsps of half-and-half to make the soup a little more creamy.

Don't get the hype!!!There was mentioned, in the instructions, to put in 1.25 cup water. Others must have not seem that. I kept wondering about that and referred to others comments and no one mentioned it. It was tasteless and had no consistency. Don't put in the water.

I didn't get the hype about this soup. The 1.5 cups water, mentioned in the bottom portion of the recipe, but not in the top portion of ingredients, seemed to ruin the taste. Was too runny and had little taste. The water had to be a mistake.

Wonderful soup! I happen to love cilantro so this was just so amazing and so simple! I have never had a soup with this herb. It was so different than your regular soups, in a good way. Definitely try it if you are looking for something out of the ordinary. I did make it with 2 tsp. of lemon juice but would prefer it with only one tsp. for the next time. (tasted it with 1 tsp. while cooking and preferred it that way). Thanks for another great recipe!

YUMMY! Can't believe something so healthy can taste so good. And it's easy to make as well. Very pretty green color - I served at Room Temp and added a dollop of low fat sour cream. I'll definately make this again and again!

Very good and healthy soup, and so simple to make.

Wow. Never knew you could make zucchini with such flavor. I followed the recipe exactly except when blending and left some unblended for a bit more texture (personal preference). I made this for a gormet potluck for a friend and doubled the recipe. It was served in clear plastic cups with a small dollop of sour cream and a sprig of corriander on top. Everyone loved it. A real winner!

If I could give this soup a Five Fork rating, I would! I love the ease, the taste, the texture..everything about this soup!! I used a stick blender which worked perfectly and definitely added to the ease, for me. When reading the recipe I thought perhaps the amount of cilantro (coriander) might be overpowering, but it wasn't...it was perfect. This is a keeper, for sure!

Super soup, and elegant enough for a dinner party. Next day, I added some creme fraiche (or could use low-fat cream, etc.) to swirl into each bowl before serving...pretty and added an extra bit of "oomph"! I think it's even better day after when flavours meld and serve slightly chilled. However, although my English neighbors were skeptical of eating it as they tend to be more conservative (and I don't find many English are keen on zucchini or "courgettes" as they are called here), they loved it when they tried it.

Dead easy and will make it again. Really creamy without having to add yoghurt or potatoes or anything. I did not have fresh coriander so used fresh parsley instead ... did not have chicken broth and so used a vegetable cube (don't know what you call them in USA)... look forward to making it with the suggested ingredients which I think would be better.(I was wondering about adding a little grated lemon next time, too for added flavour without overdoing the tartness) Also: an immersion blender saves a lot of time and washing up.

OH, YES!!!! ABSOLUTELY SCRUMMY!!!! THO' A SEASONAL RECIPE - I WILL DEFINITELY BE MAKING SURE I PLANT PLENTY OF CORRIANDER AND ZUCCHINI'S NEXT SUMMER.

Add mine to the glowing reviews of this easy and useful recipe. I went heavy on the cilantro (coriander) and increased the amount of zucchini because I wanted a thicker soup. My husband even heated it, not knowing it was supposed to be served at room temperature and it was still good. Can even get more creative by putting a dollop of sour cream or yogurt on top when served. Am making this again!Carolyn

This is what to do with all that zucchini you grow in the summer.Room Temp is best and the coriander (cilantro) and the lemon make the soup. This is a keeper.

For lovers of coriander, this is an easy and tasty summer treat. The soup was very flavorful and had a surprisingly "rich" texture, even though it did not have a cream base. Had it both cold and at room temperature; think that room temp brought out the flavors best.
