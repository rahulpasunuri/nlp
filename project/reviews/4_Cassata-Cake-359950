I made this cake for my grandmas birthday because she LOVES Cassata cake. We have never had a cake disappear so quickly at a party. I am so excited to make it again this weekend! For the people who say this is labor intensive, I think I am going to reorder the steps the next time I make it. I am going to make the cakes FIRST and then while they bake make the filling. I think the wording of this recipe was what I found the most confusing. I had to double back quite a bit to see what I already did, and where I needed to go next. But, this cake is definately delicious and I think totally worth it.

I would definitely make this cake again for a special occasion , just because it was labor intense. I also could not find the citrus oil, so I substituted lemon extract and it was delish ! A very nice recipe ... Very happy the way it turned out !

This cake is definitely worth the effort. It is most impressive to look at the also (unlike many "pretty" cakes) tastes heavenly. Do not substitute, do not alter directions or take short cuts. This cake does require your full attention. The icing decorations were easily done with a pampered chef decorator, or any other brand.

I have made this cake several times because of the several requests I get! Yes, it does take a very long time and yes there are several steps to this recipe but it's extremely worth it. I definitely suggest freezing the cakes to help you cut and shape them and don't use too much for the filling. If you don't have the correct ingredients, like most recipes, then don't make it. That simple.

This was good, but I'm not sure I would make it again. I found it to be a little labor intensive for something I would only rate 3 stars. There is very little ricotta in the filling, so I didn't really taste it. The cakes were not as light as I would have liked, but I did not have enough superfine sugar and used regular for half of the cake part. I used pastured, very fresh whipping cream and, while it was delicious, it didn't whip as light as regular whipping cream. My guests liked it, though. More of a sentimental recipe. I live in Cleveland; this is definitly the cake this region considers "Cassata". Oh, and couldn't find lemon or orange oil anywhere, so I just ommitted.

I was delighted to see this recipe. Cassata cake is sold in WNY Italian bakeries. It has always been a favorite cake of my family. When I looked at the ingredients I was surprised not to see any of the following ingredients: mascarpone cheese for the filling; real rum for the cake; sliced almonds along the side of the whip cream frosted cake. Perhaps different regions have different versions of this cake.
