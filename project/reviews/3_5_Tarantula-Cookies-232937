Great spooky treat. I used semi- sweet chocolate and added 3 tablespoons of butter to the chololate while melting. I was able to dip the cookies and spread any missed spots with my finger. The cookies alone are not very tasty, but with the chocolate and sprinkles, a great treat. Not too sweet at all. My son is so excited for his party now.

So adorable and tasty! I used a pastry brush and had plenty of sprinkles using a large tub. GREAT!

I didn't think these were difficult or time consuming, and I also thought they were delicious! I made them for work and all of our customers and employees went crazy over them. The mail delivery girl and everyone else wanted the recipe! I added a bit more salt to the cookie dough and used real cocoa, double strong vanilla and 60% chocolate for the coating. The cinnamon dots for the eyes was a perfect touch. I used a knife to spread the chocolate on and jimmies ( 2 small jars did the trick @ $2 each) then removed them immediately to a clean parchment lined cookie sheet and into the fridge. the next morning, I lined large tupperware containers with paper towels and gently placed the cold ones in for transport to the office, and they made it with little trauma. Serve with napkins though when they reach room temperature! BIG HIT.

Oops! My review below was supposed to say "CAN'T" pour the chocolate over, not "can"! Sorry for my typo!

These took FOREVER! After you bake the cookies (which are pretty tasteless) you have to wait for them to completely cool before you pour the melted chocolate on them. And you can really "pour" the chocolate unless your prepapared to go thru tons of melted chips, so I kept my double boiler at a low simmer and used a silicone pastry brush to apply the melted chips, which made it easier anyway, esp. over the pretzles stick legs. The directions don't say this but put on the red candy eyes on next BEFORE the chocolate jimmies or else they slide right off! Then be prepared to go thru LOTS of chocolate jimmies! I went thru 4 large tubs! I found it took a long time for the chocolate to set, so I put the spiders on wax paper on cookie sheets and put them in the frig for a few minutes. Still the chocolate was kind of mushy. I made these for my son's class and when I placed them in a single layer in 3 different boxes many of the pretzles legs broke off before they made it to school! These cookies took lots of time and definitely were NOT worth the effort.

These are very cute cookies. I made them for my 6 year old & 4 year old class party. They are a little time consuming probably 3 hours start to finish. They need to set overnight. I used a teflon pastry brush, it was the fastest and easiest method to get the chocolate on and then I dipped them in the sprinkles.

These cookies are so easy to make and totally adorable. They also taste pretty good as well. The recipe is perfect as is.

I made these cookies with my son's girlfriend for a Halloween party. We baked them on bamboo skewers so they could be displayed in a vase I filled with styrofoam. They looked great, but the taste was a little lacking. Never mind, the visual was stunning! They were a hit. We had the best results when dipping the cooking in chocolate. The skewers really helped out with this! Instead of using red hots or other candies, I used tinted royal icing in a piping bag to make the eyes. By the way, if you are getting spots on the chocolate after it sets, it means the chocolate has separated and the cocoa butter has gone to the spots on the top. The chocolate is still fine to eat. This can be avoided if you temper the chocolate (google or look in the Joy of Cooking for details).

I agree with everything plowax said (and also made them for my 4 year-old's preschool class). I ended up with 27 cookies. One fat bottle of chocolate sprinkles were just fine for us; one bag of chocolate chips barely covered them, so some had just partially covered legs. I used those tiny silver candy balls for the eyes, which gave them a robotic look but went over really well with the kids. Definitely break the pretzel sticks and dip the spiders as everyone else has said.

I got way more than 30 cookies out of the dough. Also, I tried some with milk chocolate chips, and some with semi-sweet chips, and the semi-sweet chocolate worked much better, tasted better, hardened better, looked better, etc. I'd love to know a tip for coating them with sprinkles?

Cute and tasty, if very rich and smeary for a kid's treat. I made these with my 4 year old so I didn't expect them to look like the picture, but they looked impressive enough for us. 1 bottle of chocolate sprinkles only coated 15 and not as thickly as in the picture - I'd get 3 next time to be on the safe side. But the plain chocolate covered ones with eyes look good too. I might substitute red licorice bits for eyes next time - most preschoolers I know don't care for red hots. I took the good advice of other reviewers to dip the tops and also to snap the pretzel sticks in half.

To lornestelmach and anyone else who might want a quick conversion, there are 16 tablespoons in an 8-ounce cup, so 2 tablespoons per ounce. Ten tablespoons is actually 5 ounces, which is a little more than half a cup. I hope that helps. I'm a bit surprised the recipe calls for melting chocolate chips since they are designed to stay intact rather than melt when baked into cookies. I'm about to make these, but I think I'll try melting chocolate in bar form and then piping from a plastic bag with a hole cut off one corner. I'll keep my fingers crossed.

Like other reviewers, this was a lot of work. They are cute though. I thought the butter amount was strange...10 Tbsp. After measuring that out, I had used about half a cup of butter. A bit easier to measure that way.

have not tried these yet, but to respond to the comment posted by LFriesema on 10/30/07, perhaps what you are seeing is chocolate bloom? (little white spots or streaks on the chocolate) your chocolate is not bad, it just means that it was improperly stored and either the cocoa butter has separated somewhat (from getting too warm), or else moisture has gotten into your chocolate, causing sugar crystals to form. Try storing your cookies in a sealed container in a cool spot as soon as they set, instead of leaving them out overnight. hope this helps!

these were terrific tasting and got rave reviews at my daughter's halloween party last year. i took a different approach to the chocolate and used a wilton's squeeze bottle to squeeze the chocolate onto the bodies while on a rack. it worked great and i had a lot of control and wasted very little chocolate. i don't think i cut down on the prep time but it was fun doing it this way. it was still messy but i think using a pastry brush would have been a lot harder. if you use this method, just pop the bottle into the microwave for a quick 10 to 15 second zap if the chocolate starts to cool inside. or maybe a warm water bath to set it in would work too.

these were a blast, took my time making them and used a pastry brush, m&m eyes, sprinkels on body with chocolate gram cracker crumbs on leggs.i also added flavoring to cookie dough. they were the biggest hit at the block party.

This was a time consuming recipe for what amounts to average cookies. I don't think the cute factor was worth the effort.

I made these cookies last week for my son's preschool Halloween party. They came out looking adorable and they were very tasty too! All the parents and teachers wanted the recipe. The spider body was a cinch to make but the chocolate part was a bit time consuming. I took the advice of previous reviewers and brushed the chocolate on with a pastry brush. It worked great and was so much easier. Also, you definitely need more than one cont ainer of sprinkles as others suggested. I was surprised at how soft and good the cookie was too...I will definitely make these cute cookies again. Oh, and to make it a little easier, I broke the pretzel sticks in half and used mini m&m's for the eyes; My spider's legs were a little shorter, but just as cute and a bit easier to prepare and package.

I'm sorry to say this given all the great reviews, but I was very disappointed in the end result. Not only was it extremely time consuming, but they came out looking like a 6 year old made them. I made mine to enter into a company Halloween contest but do not plan on entering them now. They look dumb and very amateurish.

These cookies are really cute and fun to make, but I ran into a problem. Everytime I dip chocolate and use sprinkles and leave it out over night the chocolate goes bad. What am I doing wrong? There are some sort of little spores on the chocolate.

These cookies came out so very cute. Would definately make them again. We only dipped and sprinkled the tops making it a lot easier and a lot less messy.

Clever little cookies - very messy to coat in chocolate however worthwhile if you are having a Halloween themed party. We had to put these cookies in the fridge for a while to set and sadly there were some lost legs in our efforts to get them off the rack.

It does indeed take a while to make these cookies but if you've got some free time, it's definitely worth it. The end result is so cute and everyone will be impressed. The cookie was a little on the bland side but the chocolate coating flavor dominates everything anyway. We used chopsticks to dip the spiders in the chocolate but whatever you do, expect to get a little messy. I also used cinnamon red candies for the eyes which worked well but some people weren't expecting them to be so hard and almost cracked their teeth on them. Maybe next time I'll just use royal icing for the eyes.

I thought this recipe was way more complicated than necessary for a childs cookie, so I simplified it. Instead of making cookies and covering it all in choclate I used marshmallows for the body of the spider. This worked very well and the pretzels were easy to attach, I lost one whole step doing it this way-the baking! The end result was the same, very cute!! I did think adding the oil to the melted chips made it more workable, but also more thin and it really extended the set up time. I had to refrigerate these for a couple of hours to get the chocolate to set. All in all there are couple of kinks to work out but the end result is very cute and I'm sure they will be a hit at my sons Halloween party!!

A++ Yummo! This recipe is fantastic! Not to mention very tasty and creative. They were a huge hit a Halloween party that we attended. They almost are to cute to eat! Time consuming, but worth it. I will def. make them again!

I took these cookies to a Halloween party last night, and they won me a prize in the Most Creative category. However, I probably wouldn't make them again. Way too time-consuming (took 2 hours just to decorate between me, my mom, and a friend), and the final product wasn't all that tasty. The one thing I would change is to switch the milk chocolate to semi-sweet chocolate, as the darker color of the semi-sweet suited these cookies better.

Very tasty, not overly sweet. Fun treat for Halloween, but not quick to make. I added an extra 1/4 cup mint chocolate chips and just drizzled the chocolate over the top and the legs.

I made this for an adult Halloween Party and they were definatley a hit! Delicious cookie - a little messy, but worth it. Use a pastry brush to get the melted chocolate onto the cookie.

A glorious mess, but worth it. They taste pretty good for novelties, and have a good "wow" impact. Have a glass of wine while dipping & sprinkling, though! Mini m&m's look good for the eyes. Also, as others have noted, it does take more chocolate chips and sprinkles than the recipe calls for - you are safe with double, I think. Enjoy!

So cute! They are time consuming, but worth it. I took the other suggestions and used a pastry brush for the chocolate and then coated them in ground chocolate graham crackers instead of the sprinkles. Everyone thinks they are a really fun cookie and a nice change from typical cutouts.

What a blast! My mother and I just made these for my daughter's Halloween carnival and we were amazed at how well they turned out. They are super-cute and taste really good! And we had a lot of fun making them. I held each tarantula by the body over the bowl of chocolate and painted the chocolate on with a pastry brush, then put them onto a wire rack placed over parchment paper. Grandma covered each spider with chocolate sprinkles as it sat on the rack and the parchment paper caught the extras. We used 1.5 bags of chocolate chips and a 6 oz container of chocolate sprinkles. We were generous with the chocolate and used just enough sprinkles to make the tarantulas hairy, not coated. Red hots for the eyes were the final detail. Not as messy to make as we thought they would be - the parchment paper and assembly line approach helped in that department - but time-consuming. Like others, I think they're worth the effort - and now my husband wants me to make some for him to take to his office next week.

I wanted to make this for my daughter's Halloween party at school tomorrow and from the reviews, it seemed worth trying. Unfortunately I disagree that the time and effort in making these cookies are worth it. It was definitely very time consuming (from beginning to end). It was also very messy, even though I did use a pastry brush to brush on the chocolate. Finally the thought of the sprinkles falling onto the classroom floor (not to mention the mess it already makes when you eat it) just isn't worth finishing the cookies up. I would not make these cookies again due to the time it takes to make them plus the taste isn't all that great! Sorry :-(

These cookies are wonderful! Not only do they taste delicious (perfect combo of salty and sweet), they are adorable (almost too cute to eat). They are a bit time consuming and I wouldn't recommend making them with little ones (my 5 year old had fun, but my 2 year old just kept making messes), but definitely well worth it. To coat the spider I just dipped each one into the melted chocolate (I made sure I used a large enough bowl)--that seemed to work just fine. Yum, I'm going to make some more!

This is not a recipe to tackle last minute (as is my usual habit) - allow yourself a lot of time so you don't get frustrated. It takes time but is worth it for the "wow" factor. I needed at least 1 1/2 bags of chocolate chips and a ton of sprinkles. After unsuccessfully trying to dip the spider in the chocolate, and then dip in the sprinkles (way too messy, legs were breaking off, sprinkles got too gooey) I ended up holding the spider over the bowl of chocolate and brushing it on with a pastry brush. I then patted some sprinkles only on the back of the spider, not the legs. Doesn't look quite as hairy this way but was a lot easier. The effect is the same. I couldn't find any red hots so I used mini M&M's instead which worked well. Kids liked the different colored eyes. Several people asked what was inside, expecting something gooey, but the dough needs to be stiff enough to hold the pretzels in. Next time I might try putting a small maraschino cherry or mini marshmallow in the middle for the "guts". To speed up the drying I put them in the fridge and they set up in within a couple of hours. Need a lot of space to spread out though. Definitely have a helper with this one - kids, husband, wife - anyone who wants to lick chocolate off their fingers.

These were brilliant. A little messy, yes, but fun and oh what a neat result! The kids at our Halloween party last night loved them. They tasted darned good, too! I dipped them into chocolate and then covered with sprinkles, throwing the sprinkles into the melted chocolate when they became too clumped to use. We also used different colored pairs of Smarties for the eyes for a bit of fun.

These cookies turned out to be alot of fun. I think there might have been too much oil in the chocolate because they never fully dried, even though a bit messy everyone loved them.

TOOK A BIT OF TIME TO MAKE FROM START TO FINISH AND I EVEN MADE SUPER BIG TARANTULAS..12 TOTAL..I'M GUESSING REGARDLESS OF SIZE THAT 1 1/2 BAGS OF MILK CHOCOLATE CHIPS FOR COATING IS A MORE REASONABLE AMOUNT TO WORK WITH AND I USED ABOUT 6 OZ OF SPINKLES. ALL IN ALL VERY CUTE..AND I'M EXCITED TO PASS THEM OUT TO THE KIDS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD TOMORROW NIGHT DURING BEGGARS NIGHT.

Just made these--I'm rating not the taste but the effect :) Great for kids' Halloween parties! Messy but fun to make. Instead of pouring the chocolate over, I held the cookies by one edge of the "body" over the bowl of melted chocolate and poured it over the cookies with a spoon, so the drips fell back into the bowl. Even so, with one 12-oz bag of chips, I didn't have quite enough chocolate. Also, this takes a LOT of sprinkles--I had a 10.5 oz container and was a tiny bit short.

Time consuming, but fun. I made them for an adult party, and though they aren't the most sophisticated in taste, they look great. I used dark choc chips that come in a bag that is microwave safe. When it came time to 'frost' the spiders, I squeezed a dollop from the bag onto the body and spread it with my finger. Minimal waste of chocolate and no extra oil needed. Be sure to make the legs long enough, otherwise you don't get a good effect. Also, be creative with the body shape - fangs are a very fun addition!

So easy! And really cute. The chocolate coating part is time consuming, but the result is worth the time. We frosted on a cooling rack over a pot so we could recycle the chocolate- worked very well. Note these take several hours to dry in a warm house so you need a big surface to lay them out on. Make sure you stick the pretzels in the middle of the cookie or they will fall out after cooking

Very fun to make with my 4 year olds. A little more time consuming than I'd expected but well worth it. I suggest using a pastry brush to "paint" on the chocolate - saves on a mess.
