Have not found time to cook for the past few years, but somehow managed a delicious Easter dinner for family and friends with the preparation of this great recipe that requires only one addition, which was lemon tiramisu prepared with Limoncello Liqueur. I will have to learn to take more time to prepare these culinary gems that are so satisfying and fun to prepare without the requirement of sitting in a restaurant and being waited on instead of preparing in your home.

We eat very well as a rule and we both cook often. So when I get a "Wow!" after just one bite I know we have a winner. As others have said, from start to finish about 40 minutes in one pan - I used a very large Calphalon straight-sided skillet; the potatoes browned beautifully in it. This is a lovely rustic way to do rack of lamb - full of flavor and super-simple, even a novice cook could do it. I highly recommend making extra tomatoes as their acidity offsets the fattiness of the lamb nicely; we served it with plain steamed then flash-sauteed green beans in EVOO. Fabulous!

Fantastic and easy to make. The result is well worth the effort. I made this for a group of 10 and they all loved it! Make sure to choose a quality rack of lamb, as it won't be as nice if chops lack any meat. It also doesn't hurt to add a little more thyme and rosemary.

Made extra herb mixture and no tomatoes. My potatoes didn't brown well but tasted incredible. Excellent recipe for 2!

It was my second time to cook (ever) when I made this, it was very easy to follow and turned out really good=)

This is absolutely the best thing I ever made. Quick and easy. Roasted to exactly 130 degrees and it was perfect. While it roasts, you have a little time to finish up any other sides or last minute tasks. Will be making it for guests soon. The potatoes were wonderful.

Simply amazing. My boyfriend and I made this on a weeknight and dinner was ready by 7:30 and was easily the most delicious meal we've both eaten in a long time (and we eat really well!). We ommitted the potatoes, shallots, and water as we decided to make mashed cauliflower instead. We didn't miss the calories! As we used a nonstick pan for the meat, we turned the oven down to 380 degrees and the meat came out perfectly medium rare in 20 minutes and the tomatoes took 35. We used the WF mashed cauliflower recipe and added a little more evoo than called for plus a little bit of the herb-garlic mixture. We also increased the garlic to 6 cloves and had just the right amount for the tomatoes, meat, and cauliflower. Cauliflower recipe: http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/recipes /1222

This lamb rack recipe is painfully easy to make and delicious. You may need far more of the garlic/herb paste to cover the entire rack than is laid out in the recipe. Excellent with the side of baked tomatoes and sauteed asparagus.

This turned out well as directed, including cooking times. I would slice the shallots thicker next time as they were burned at the end of the oven time, however.

Delicious! Not sure if the tomatoes were necessary. Next time, to save extra work, I will throw them in the pan with the lamb. I made 2 racks (8 bones each) for 5 people and served with mint pea puree. It was better than restaurants. :)

I love lamb and have made it in all its variations numerous times. This was hands down the best I've ever tasted, homemade or at a restaurant!! I used red potatoes and then topped the tomatoes with crumbled feta when I took it out of the oven. Even my one and four year olds couldn't get enough. My only complaint was that I wanted more.

I have made this three times and it is fantastic every time. The tomatoes and the potatoes are delicious. Very good with a Pinot Noir.

This was unbelievably good. It is a simple dish to prepare and looks and tastes like a million bucks! I followed the recipe to the letter except for the potatoes. I used four new potatoes and I did not peel them. They were perfect. One more thing is the tomatoes - I prepared two as it called for, but one tomato would have been enough for the two of us. That said, they are still quite tasty! I'll be making this more often. My wife already said, "This is our new empty-nest Easter dinner!"

My wife loves lamb. Her traditional birthday dinner, which I make for her, is some kind of lamb dish whether it be lamb chops, leg of lamb or some other variation. This year I chose this recipe for her birthday dinner. It was outstanding, one of the best I've ever made. I made exactly as described in the recipe. You won't be disappointed.

My wife was so impressed, particularly by the tomatoes! It was also delicious..

Really delicious! Also, very simple to prepare. I cut the potatoes a little thicker, and fried them alone first for 10 minutes before adding the shallots. This gave the potatoes a bit longer to brown and crisp up, since the shallots don't need so long in the pan.

This recipe was amazing! Couldn't have enjoyed it more We didn't have any fresh herbs around so we used dried thyme and herbs de provence (we also didnt have any dried rosemary). It still was fantastic.

This was truly fantastic. I've never tried making a rack of lamb before... but they had such a good deal on them at Costco I had to try! The flavors were bold, the meat was cooked absolutely perfect and the presentation was great. I'd highly recommend this super easy recipe to anyone.

Outstanding!! Great flavour and quite easy...I will definitely make this again.

This was a huge hit with my family. It was pretty easy to make and very flavorful. Instead of cooking the potatoes in the pan, I roasted them in the oven at the same time as the tomatoes (but in separate pans). I served the potatoes and lamb together in a large dish and the tomatoes on its own in a separate serving plate. I will definitely make this dish again!

Like all of the previous reviewers stated, this recipe is one that I will definitely use again. The potatoes and oven roasted tomatoes were incredible!

Loved this recipe! Simple, elegant and delicious. We used lamb chops rather than a rack, seared both sides and added them to the potatoes the last 8 - 10 mins. This helped produce crispier potatoes but they still benefitted from the lamb juices. Additionally, I didn't pour out all the oil from the lamb and sauteed the potatoes until a little crispy. Yum! Also, cooked the tomatoes for 30 minutes rather than the recommended length and in the future I'll throw them in the same time as the potatoes. We were munching on brie while cooking and the garlic/herb mixture went very well with that, too ;)

The first time I tried this, I stuck pretty close to the recipe. This time I forgot to buy potatoes, so I looked around in the cupboard and found a box of Israeli Couscous I had been meaning to work into a recipe. All I can say is WOW(x2)!! The al dente pearls of Israeli Couscous are a PERFECT match with this lamb dish. I will make this with the couscous from now on!!!

Like the previous reviewer, WOW! Rack of lamb is so easy anyway, but this dish was sensational. The potatoes are amazing. We would have finished off double the amount. Oven roasted tomatoes are the best. Long part of my repitoire, glad to be reminded of how good they can be.

WOW!!! At first this seemed a little too simple to be good, but I am glad I tried it. I have never enjoyed eating cooked tomatoes, but they really shine in this dish. I followed one reviewer's suggestion and used heirloom tomatoes and boy were they good. Oh...by the way...the lamb and potatoes were fabulous too. I can't wait for my next chance too cook for a party. This will undoubtedly be what I take!!!

Very easy- rave reviews- we make this for our guests a lot and can't stop them from inviting themselves over now! I ditched the potato- they tend to get too mushy- either pair with some goat cheese mashed or roasted separately to make them crunchy.

The lamb turned out really well and the tomatoes complimented it nicely. However, I thought the potatoes were mediocre at best - too soft & mushy. I would make the lamb again, but not the potatoes. Make sure to watch the tomatoes, as the recommended time was too long.

Wow, valentines dinner with nice bottle of wine - incredible! Why don't I make tomatoes like this more often? We used fingerling potatoes. Doubled the herb rub as I had a 2 pound grass fed rack.

Delicious! Used lamb shoulder chops and round instead of rack of lamb (because it is much more expensive) and it was still really delicious. The seasoning is SO good and the tomatoes were a perfect compliment!

I made this tonight and it was so easy and soooooo delicious. My husband loves lamb chops and said that it was as good as any restaurant serving. I think next time I may drizzle some balsamic vinegar over them while baking. Followed the recipe to the exact times and ingredients. OUTSTANDING!!
