Wonderful recipe that is worth the work. The only change I made was to add a bit more Parmesan. This is the second time I made it. So delicious with osso buco!

The instructions are good, but as with most risotto recipes, the recipe ends up taking longer and needing more broth than in indicated - definitely have some extra broth on hand so that you don't have to finish with water! I gave this 2 fors because 1) Risotto ALWAYS starts with at least 1/2 cup dry white wine before the broth - that is how you break down the starch in the rice. After you fry the rice in the butter and onion,s stir in the wine and cook until the alcohol is gone, then start with the broth. 2) Risotto Milanese is with beef marrow broth, not chicken. At the very least, use beef or veal broth if you want a more authentic flavor, but ideally homemade broth made with a good assortment of marrow bones.

It's pretty good. I was thrilled to finally use up some of my saffron, however I found the saffron a bit too dominant. Next time I will use less.

I have made this recipe at least 10 times in the past 4 months - it is a HUGE favorite in my house. I substitute a cup of white wine instead of water. Saffron is VERY expensive, but you can buy it on eBay from sellers in Iran for a huge discount. Without the saffron, this recipe would just be a bowl of rice.

This is a great, weeknight recipe. Easy, exceptionally tasty and is a great accompanyment to just about anything. I omit the saffron and add 1/4 cup of Sauvignon Blanc for extra flavor. Yum!

This classic dish is spot on and perfect for Osso Buco. My guests love it every time I make it. I would not change a thing.

I made this with osso buco and it really went well as a side. I am not sure how to cook this without the rice becomming sticky after it is served. It took about 40 minutes to cook. Still, the flavor was good.

This is simple but delicious recipe. I found using a generous amount(1+ cup)of wine and soaking the saffron in it for a half hour before using really helped infuse the taste, and made for a more intense colour.

I made this to accompany classic Osso Buco. Delicious.

I wanted to start with a basic recipe since Risotto is something I have wanted to make for a long time, the flavors in this were good. However, I had to cook it for a lot longer than stated and add about 1.5 more cups of stock. I also added half a cup of pinot grigio. Total cooking time I would estimate at 40 mins, but it was delicious! Added mushrooms sauteed in butter and balsamic for a little texture!

I took a few cooking classes in Florence. The key to risotto alla milanese is a (generous) half cup of white wine.

I doubled the saffron and dissolved it in 1/4 cup of broth, adding it about half way through to get a more even color and disbursement of the flavor. Also added 1/4 cup of cream and 1 tablespoon of butter just before serving. It adds to the creaminess.

I think I discovered I don't care for saffron from this dish. My husband found it rather boring and unintersting. I thought the texture came together well, but it was slightly bland, even using my homemade chicken stock...served with a great osso buco

This was my first attempt at risotto and it came out perfect! I subbed dry white wine for the water, as other reviewers suggested. I debated buying saffron as it is so expensive, but in the end, I'm glad I did. This was great!

Yum! This is like a grown-up version of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, in terms of color and comfort. I think it needs a bit longer to cook and more liquid. As other reviewers have suggested, do add wine rather than water, and more saffron. I added the saffron to the simmering broth and wine and it was great.

Awesome! My Italian husband grew up on a classic risotto and he says this is just like grandmas!

Yum! I took someone's suggestion and used white wine intead of water and it was fantastic. So far the best risotto recipe I have tried.

I've made this recipe twice now. The first time I replaced water with white wine, the second time I replaced water with Sherry. Both times it was devoured and received rave reviews from the family!

I steeped the saffron in the broth before adding it to the rice mixture. That seemed to work really well!

Good. But added some changes. Used shallots, extra saffron, and butter.

I gave the recipe a 2, but it could easily be a 3 with some small adjustments. Agreed with Brookline... double the saffron and add it sooner. And add some salt during the saute stage. I also added white wine instead of water to the broth simmer which brought out the flavor of a classic risotto. Sometimes classics are meant to be simple. Confidential to Kelly in Seattle... plain rice cooked in chicken broth is just that, not risotto. This was not a complicated recipe and it offers the basic techniques and ingredients for making true risotto (though wine is key, IMO).

Nice, easy, plain risotto. Good choice to serve when the rest of the meal has strong flavours.

A very simple risotto and a very good side dish. I would recommend adding a little more saffron (1/2 tsp instead of 1/4 tsp) and to do it a little earlier than 3 min before completion in order to give the aromatic flavor and yellow color more time to permeate the dish. Also, a little grey salt added in beginning would be helpful. I'm definitely keeping this recipe to accompany fish and chicken.

This was my first try at risoto, and thought it was amazingly easy, although my timing was a bit off with my main dish so it ended up drying out a bit. I love saffron, so added a little extra; it still tasted wonderful, and will definitely make it again!

What I like best about this recipe is that is very simple to follow and a good base recipe for future risotto endeavors. I took the next steps immediately. I started out by rendering some prosciuto, throwing in the shallot and (increased dosage of 8 cloves) garlic, and then deglazing pan with dry, white wine. Add drawn, clarified butter then the grains. I used the same liquifying technique until the end, when I finished the dish with a tablespoon of butter and more wine, making it truly creamy. Also, try to shave your parmisan reggiano instead of grating it. Works for me.

This is a really traditional risotto with the saffron threads that add zip. I served it with lamb and used grated romano cheese. My guests loved it, and I will make it again.

There are a lot easier risotto recipes to make. Plain rice cooked in chicken broth is a lot easier, and I think, better than this recipe. For an unbelievably good risotto, try the quick Mexican corn risotto on this site. A more complicated recipe, but still easy and much more tasty.

This is an excellent, easy, quick risotto to make. My whole family loves it!

I used a lot of saffron, which I love, and the color was vibrant golden yellow. I cut up some carrots in diagonal penny slices and let them simmer in the broth as I was making the risotto, and they were done just right. I served the risotto mounded on a white plate, surrounded by the carrot pennies, and topped it with some shrimps that had been wrapped with little slices of bacon and quickly fried. Bit of parsley and the presentation was just lovely. Tasted just as good as it looked, too.

I don't have a lot of experience with risotto, but thought it could use something more.

It took more than 18 minutes and needed about a half cup more liquid (maybe because I live at a high altitude?), but it was really good. I fried some bacon beforehand and used the bacon grease instead of the butter then stirred in the crumbled bacon just before serving. Yum!

This was my first attempt at making Risotto, and I was extremely satisfied with the results of this recipe. The risotto was al dente and quite delicious. I added some sliced mushroom and italian parsley to garnish and served it as a side dish.

I love risotto, and risotto Milanese is my favorite version. I also usually add 1/8 cup of diced proscuitto to the sautee of onion-- adds a subtle depth to the flavor.

I've made this for my last two dinner parties and everyone loved it, even though I'd never made risotto before. It's as good with or without the saffron.
