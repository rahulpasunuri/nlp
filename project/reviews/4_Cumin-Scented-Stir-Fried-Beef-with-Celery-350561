A wonderful recipe - just what I was looking for after our trip to China in April. I particularly liked the idea of cumin and it did taste great! The green of the celery, the meaty beef and the white rice - also optically a pleasing dish! And the taste was sophisticated. This recipe definitely just made it on my fave list! Thanks for posting!

I enjoyed this recipe, but when I make it again I will make a few changes. I thought the meat tasted too much like soy sauce; I would probably add rice wine to the marinade next time. I added a red bell pepper and some green onions and at least doubled the ginger and garlic and I would certainly do those things again. Ground cumin was a fine substitute for cumin seeds (I probably used about half a teaspoon) but the soy sauce was overpowering...maybe I didn't use enough? I should also point out that my meat to vegetables ratio was a little too low for my boyfriend...

This sounded very interesting albeit simple...simple always makes me suspicious. It was GREAT. Layers on layers of flavour from very few ingredients. Kids liked it so it will go into rotation.

Made this for hubby and me last night. Liked the beef. It was tender and tasty. However, the dish overall lacked flavor and was rather bland (particularly the veggies, even though I added red peppers, snow peas, onions, and scallions). We didn't throw it out, but I don't think I would make this again. It just felt like something was missing in the flavor.

so so good, this is a definite weeknight stand by... adding sliced red pepper tonight.

Quick, easy, and delicious dinner. I did not have cumin seeds so I just added a sprinkle of ground cumin instead. I really liked the mix of flavors. Big hit at our house -- I doubled the recipe for hungry boys. I also added some other veggies on hand -- carrots, onions, and scallions.

Really good for a super quick meal. I should have backed off a bit on cumin seed as mine was super fresh and flavor was a bit strong, even though I love cumin. Served with jasmine rice.

Delicious!!!! I wanted to try it with rice wine but I couldn't find it, the Sherry was good though. My bunch of celery didn't have leaves so I just skipped them. I added extra garlic and ginger too. I don't even like celery and I thought it was amazing.

Outstanding! The entire family loved it.

Loved this. I am a vegetarian and my boyfriend is not so I did a portabella version for me and beef for him. The mushrooms were delicious and he loved it as well. I will make double portions next time so we have leftovers.

the deliciousness : ease ratio on this recipe is great! just a little prep, and out comes a savory and filling meal. i doubled the celery (love it) and added some shredded carrots, and skipped the ginger - this would have probably added another dimension to the flavors but in all honesty I'd probably skip it again, as I find it sort of a pain to work with. A definite recommended recipe - little work, lots of flavor.

This was an extremely easy recipe and the taste was amazing. I would have used less red pepper flakes as I don't like things that are too hot but my husband LOVED it. I have already started adding it to my regular menu list. I added more than the required amount of celery as I was trying to use up the last of a stalk I had. It was great.

Man-oh-man was this recipe simple. And delicious. I sort of cheated and used ribeye steak (trimmed of as much fat as possible) so the meat was crazy tender. Everything came together easy and fast. It's great for that mid-week dinner when you're about out of energy.

I've made this twice now, once with flank steak and once with leftover chicken tenderloins, and both turned out very well. I don't have a wok, and instead used a large skillet, which functioned just fine. I may try adding green onions, as some reviewers have suggested, next time.

This is the second time I've made this, but this time I doctored the recipe quite a bit. The results were great, so I wanted to share what I did. Instead of celery I used sugar snap peas and instead of rice wine or sherry I used a combination of red wine (merlot) and apple cider vinegar. I also used extra red pepper flakes, garlic, and cumin. This is a flexible, easy, and fast recipe. I highly recommend it.

You know, up until the point when we sat down to eat this dish I thought it was going to be 4 forks. But somewhere along the way (was it the sherry? Should I have used the Chinese rice wine instead?) something went wrong. It smelled great, it looked great. But it tasted, well, just okay. The dish needed something more to infuse the meat with more flavor. I served it over a bed of brown rice and had enough for leftovers but probably will continue to search for a better recipe.

Delicious meal and easy. I added green onions as another reviewer suggested and had rave reviews. Using flank steak is pricey but worth it. Had it with a green salad and brown rice.

This was fantastic. Doubled garlic and ginger

It was good but not great. It's a bit boring just beef and celery. Next time I'd make this with a more tasty veggie like snowpeas or broccoli. I served over brown rice which was very nice. Leftovers were great the next day!

This is an outstanding recipe and super easy. My only addition was a little chopped cilantro on top.

My husband and I loved this. We doubled the recipe and it made just the right amount for the two of us. Substituted red wine vinegar for the rice wine, but otherwise made as written. Delicious. Super fast, easy, and healthy. Served with brown rice.

Easy and probably the best stir-fry I've ever made. I made a double recipe and used sirloin. I cut it very thin and it was nice and tender, especially since I made sure to pull it out as soon as it was browned. This was great, both the meat and the celery were cooked just the right amount. Next time I'll try adding some other veggies, as other reviewers have suggested.

I really love celery and cumin so I thought this sounded good. I made it with a 3/4 lb pork tenderloin, frying the meat in two batches. This recipe came out so good and it was really fast & easy to make! Highly recommended.

Very good, very simple.

Excellent! I made this with sirloin (flank was $6.99 a lb!!), still sliced thin and across the grain and it worked out nicely. Also I used fresh red chilies instead of dried red pepper flakes, it added a nice color and spice. I did forget the ginger (oops!), but it still tasted great- I think that the ginger would go well with the cumin though ;)

This was EZ, tasty & terrific! I followed the recipe but doubled the celery & added sliced shiitake mushrooms & 2 sliced scallions. No need to double the sauce, but I did add a dash of cumin powder & deglazed the pan with chicken broth to avoid adding add'l oil. Served over short-grain brown rice. Deeeeeeeeeeeelish!

The quickest, easiest, tastiest stir fry I've ever made. It is now going to be in the weekly rotation.

This is a good recipe, very quick and easy to do. I added snap peas and carrots which really gave it some good flavor. Next time I'm going to put some brown sugar in the sauce to balance the spices. Definite make again for me!

This is a delicious change of pace from the usual stirfry dishes. The cumin is unexpected and very nice. My kids cleaned their plates and asked for more. I didn't make it exactly as written (used a better cut of meat and added cilantro with the celery leaves) but I think the flavor combination came through just the same.

We doubled the recipe, and really enjoyed the flavor and texture. Flank steak was very tender, and the celery was still a bit crunchy, making for a great combination. We will make it again any night-- simple and delicious!

I really enjoyed the flavor of this meal, but I did throw in some broccoli I had in the fridge, and I tripled the recipie, as I was making it for the family. I would exercise caution in the meat choice. I got the blade cut from the butcher and he cut it into stir fry pieces for me, but it was still quite tough, so I advise making sure to cut against the grain, and cutting the pieces small. Next time I will definately use flank, and cut it thin. Overall though, the seasonings were nice, and even my husband said he would eat it again.
