jicama is rather bland, good substitutes are water chestnuts or apple Jicama adds a nice crumch

I like this recipe a lot. I've served it several times & most everyone loves it. I take it to an annual July 4 celebration every year because the colors are perfect for the holiday, and it's always the first thing to go. I usually forget to buy the sesame seeds, so generally make it without that. The jalapeno adds an interesting touch that some people don't care for...while others are surprised that they really like.

Refreshing. but OK. Not sure if I like it with the jalapeno. Jicama was a good ingredient for that juicy crunch.

I'm also replying to the person looking for a substitue for jicama... I think the best substitute would be kohlrabi, which has the same crispness and mild, sweet taste. Raw julienned turnip would give you the same crispness and texture, but I think the flavour would be too strong.

I did not dig this recipe. Blueberries and jicama? Ick. I guess if I go out and buy beautiful fresh berries, then I prefer to eat them WITHOUT honey and jalapenos.

I have not made this recipe but wanted to respond to the person who needs a substitute for jicama. I had the same problem recently and used hearts of palm. They do not have the crunch but have a pleasant, mild flavor and worked well in my salad.

What can I use instead of jicama? I've never seen it.

Very refreshing to serve in the Texas hot summer. It is a nice addition to serve with fajitas or chicken enchalidas.

I add the chilis straight to the dressing and let the mix sit a while. I use it on any and all salads (spinach, sprouts, mesclun, whatevers in the fridge) to rave review each time.

Used the dressing (with a finely chopped jalapeno added to it, along with a couple of "honeydew" sage leaves) on a combo of mango, watermelon, pineapple and sweet onion. Many, many requests for the recipe! Let it sit for a few hours to blend, and it was incredible.

I served this for the fourth. Everyone loved it. Make sure you get fresh fruit. That makes all the difference.

This was a very refreshing taste and just right for the 4th of July in color and taste. I was careful to pick sweet fruits and I added the cilantro and mint as suggested. Both of these additions is what I believe "made" the salad. Everyone in the family enjoyed this. The chili was not hot enough, next time I'll make sure to keep a bit more of the heat in.

This was a lovely salad and nice alongside simple grilled chicken. I second my previous reviewer's suggestion that the person from Chicago perhaps had berries which were not ripe. Also, jicama is to provide texture - it has very little flavor of its own.

Thanks for the mint idea! It worked nicely with the salad. I also added a little fresh cilantro.

I for one, thought this was a delightful salad! Perhaps the reviewer before me didn't have ripe enough fruit. I also added some fresh chopped mint leaves, which really livened up the flavors. It was wonderful with grilled chicken. Beautiful color too - would definitely make again!

Disappointing. Though the jalapeno had a nice bite, the salad somehow managed to be both too sweet and too sour, and the fruits completely overpowered the jicama.
