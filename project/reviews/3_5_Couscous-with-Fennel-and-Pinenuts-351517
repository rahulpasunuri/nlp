I cut the couscous, bouillon and water by half and my husband and I loved it! Certainly no waste of pine nuts, however I can understand why some of the previous critiques noted it as bland if they used the full two cups of couscous.

I did not make the recipe as intended, but I love the way mine turned out. I substituted the pinenuts with almonds (less expensive) and sauteed them with the fennel until fennel was golden brown along with onions and garlic. I then used Israeli couscous and sauteed for another minute before adding the chicken broth. The combination is awesome!

I doubled the amount of fennel and made with Grande Coucous. It was delicious. I love fennel seed and have a spice grinder just for this spice. The Grande Coucous takes forever to cook and I sauted it with the fennel before bringing the broth and water to a boil.

I don't understand the rave reviews. I made this as an accompaniment to a middle-eastern spiced leg of lamb, and used a high quality homemade chicken stock. The couscous was very bland - a complete waste of pricey pine nuts. Desperately in need of seasoning and perhaps the addition of chopped figs.

Outstanding. Made it with lemon chicken kabobs, and grilled asparagus. Very easy and simply exceptional flavor combo. I can't imagine a better restaurant meal anywhere. Pair this with a nice chardonnay - and viola - a wonderful evening.

This was very nice. I adapted it with jasmine rice, since I try to avoid gluten. I measured the rice I had and then added the stock/water to measure twice the rice, and covered/cooked until the rice was tender. Very good.

This was a lovely accompaniment to the Rainbow Trout with Tomatoes Ginger and Shiitake Mushrooms dish... didn't have fennel seeds, but used ground anise - delish!
