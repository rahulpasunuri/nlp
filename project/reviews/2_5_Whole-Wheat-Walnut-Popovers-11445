Bein a fan of light and fluffy popovers, this recipe falls really short, literally. These popovers were dense and small, barely feeding three hungry children. I would be inclined to categorize this recipe in the muffin section rather than popovers. It's always fun to try something new; I'll try a different recipe next time as well.

Very nice sturdy popovers. The whole wheat flour helps to prevent falling. I serve these with molasses butter or apricot butter. These are great do ahead popovers, just reheat before serving.
