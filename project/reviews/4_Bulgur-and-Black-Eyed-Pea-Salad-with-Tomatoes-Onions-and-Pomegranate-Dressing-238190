I meant this recipe in my review below, I give it FOUR FORKS. For some reason I'm having trouble getting the 4 forks to show up in my review.

This is a keeper for us. Although the 'small bulgur' took 1/2 hour to cook, not the 5 minutes the recipe said. I used 'small' grains of whole bulgur weat, perhaps in saying 'small' they meant 'cracked'? Because cracked bulgur cooks in a shorter amount of time more like they described. I googled a subsitution for 'Pomagranite molasses' and many suggested 1 part honey to 1 part cider vinegar. This worked well as a substitution. Next time I will try to get some of the real thing from the chef supply store. Even without the pom molasses it was very good. It's healthy & easy on the wallet, a nice break on our menue from eating meat.{I added 1 extra can of drained black eyed peas to make it more of a meal.}

Made with what I had on hand (quinoa instead of bulgur and frozen herbs) but the result was delicious. My husband found the tastes of Turkey he loved and we can't wait to make it with fresh herbs and bulgur. Would definetely be best served a bit chilled, we couldn't wait but loved every last spoonful! Definitely a keeper.

Excellent! It turned out much better than expected!

This dish is GREAT! For the first time ever,though, I created something else entirely based on it. To complement a french-inspired lunch, try: shallots, tarragon, chives, parsley, carrots (for color), green grapes, walnut oil rather than olive oil for the dressing. Leave out the peppery heat. I realize it indeed creates something entirely different, but it turned out really good and got rave reviews!

Made this with quinoa as that is what I had on hand. While the quinoa is too small of a grain for this dish, the flavors are just insane! Since I can't tolerate spicy foods too much anymore, I used a small can of chopped green chilis for just enough heat. Will make again with the bulgur - can't wait! NOTE: if you have anemia, this dish is packed with iron and iron absorbers.

Oh my goodness, YUM~ Made exactly as written, expect added more garlic and made my own pomegranate molasses by boiling down a bottle of pomagranate juice. Could maybe use some more black-eyed peas? I doubled it and it made a TON! Added Ras el hanout and fresh mint. Was really spicy with my jalepenos, and I seeded half of them, I guess I had an extra spicy bunch. Saved walnuts to use as topping, so they would be crunchy each time I serve it, as we will be eating this for awhile. Will be great for hubbies lunch though.

This was terrific. I made it as written in the recipe, but then decided upon tasting that I wanted more basil. The jalepeno I used definitely mellowed its hotness after 30 minutes or so.

Was looking for something do to with my fresh texas peas I got at the farmers market and this sounded interesting, it was and delicious to boot. Served it with Turkish Sauteed Sea Bass with Almond Tarator and asparagus with lemon to make an entire Turkish meal.

Was looking for something different to serve with pork and this was a hit. One small word of warning: REMEMBER TO WEAR RUBBER GLOVES WHEN CUTTING THE red jalapeño chiles. If you happen to forget...like I did (since I don't often use chiles)...rubbing alcohol takes the sting out of your hands. Learned this after suffering for 24 hours and having tried a long list of remedies.

I love this recipe, not surprising as I adore pomegranate molasses, but have cut the bulgur to one cup, as I am single and it makes a lot. I cook bell, banana,& anahiem peppers with the onion. Plus I add Basil, parsley, & mint [more than stated] as I have a garden and take advantage of the bounty. For the beans I like baby limas & small navy beans that I have cooked myself with some fresh rosemary. Summer is about to come to a close and I will miss this dish until next year. . .

This meal is easy and truly delicious. I was unstoppable, eating it out of the pan even before I dressed it. If you didn't have or couldn't find pomegranate syrup this would still be worth making. I couldn't get my hands on any red jalapenos so I used a bell pepper for color. The (green) jalapenos I had turned out to have no heat at all,so I left them out and added a squirt of harissa to the dressing. It worked out nicely - full of fresh flavors and very satisfying. This is going in the permanent rotation.

Delicious! I cooked medium-grain bulgur in low-sodium stock instead of water, and halved the olive oil (1.5 tbls for saute, 1.5 tbls in dressing) and the walnuts to cut calories. I also made the "mistake" of adding a third clove of garlic, but it was super-tasty.

This has become something of a weekly dish in our house. We usually add two cans of black eyed peas (or one pea, one chickpea) for bulk and, lately, we've taken to sprinkling it with ras-el-hanout. Makes excellent leftovers.

This is really good. My husband loved it! I didn't have enough basil so I added some cilantro and parsley, also, I used pistachio nuts instead of walnuts. This will definitely be on our summer menus again.

well, it looks like I added one extra galic clove by accident, but I guess I wouldn't change that&
