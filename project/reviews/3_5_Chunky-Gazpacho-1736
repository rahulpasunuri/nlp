You know, there is an alias for all the gazpacho recipes I have read so far: Bloody Mary's. You all better be chasing this gazpacho with a little beer. All you need is tomatoes, cucumber, a little red bell pepper, tomato juice, dash white wine vinegar and some olive oil. Adding all that other stuff makes it taste like a condiment...which admittedly isn't so bad on a Sunday morning.

Let's just say I can still taste the garlic, and it's the next morning. A little too strong.

This recipe is a summer staple for our family. I add an extra garlic clove, no green pepper, and use balsamic vinegar for extra zing. If you like spicy- add 1-2 Tbp of chiptotles chiles. Serve decorated with chips, and sour cream/guacomole.

Well received by a number of people at a garden party and then at 2 dinner partys. Replaced half of the cilantro with italian parsely and found it less bitter. I did not thin the soup with juice.

Great start ... BUT missing the critical elements of CELERY and Lemon Pepper ... and it's way to heavy on the cilantro, while the single best expander (which is a must!) is Clamato juice, and the best ZING producer (however mild) is Habanero pepper sauce (which is FAR more flavorful that the old standard Tobasco, even if only VERY lightly used!). Double or triple the tomato paste portion, which solves the pale color problem. Do NOT reserve the chunkier veggies ... puree the heck out of the vinegar, oil, onion, garlic (which ALSO can be at least DOUBLED), LOTSA lemon pepper, and the Habanero sauce, along with a few tomatoes and juice to help liquefy the base. Blenderize the rest of the veggies separately (with the tomato paste)to control for your mid-sized chunkiness. Then mix your hand chopped larger chunks with the first two batches ... and thinly chopped CELERY in the third UN-BLENDERIZED batch is an absolute MUST! Then, add additional salty tang to taste by way of boullion powder ... but let the lemon pepper carry the base "black-pepper" and salt taste. Forget peeling the cucumbers ... there's wonderful texture and nutrients in the well-washed skin. Go lighter on the green pepper ... and our tastes prefer only about 2 tablesppons of the cilantro (you'll be surprized, however, at how the taste is still there!). Finally, add a dash MORE vinegar, and, if you want the "edge" off, add a single packet (only one!) of Aspartame sweetener. Finally, and here's the key ... do a small batch first based on these comments ... then have at it to YOUR TASTES! Experiment! Within reason, the result is a WONDERFUL cool veggie medley!

Great, especially with the tabasco to spicen it up a bit!

Try adding one can of Campbell's beef broth to this recipe along with the suggestions of V-8 or spicy tomato juice. The recipe gets even better!

To give it a biit of a kick, use spicy hot vegetable juice instead of tomato juice. Great when you have a garden and get really fresh vegetables.

I would back off on the vinegar, maybe using 3 Tbsp instead of a quarter cup. Otherwise, delightful.

Very tasty, but I was disappointed by the color -- more pinky than red. Perhaps I put in too much onion? I would try other gazpacho recipes before making this one again. (p.s. I put in arugula instead of cilantro and it tasted great.)

What to say that hasn't been said? I blended until not so chunky rather than add to much tomato juice and it was excellent. Try this recipe -- you will not be dissapointed.

Completely yummy, and easy to make.

Use less oil & more heat! We like the chunky better, but was in Barcelona last weekend (I live in Europe)and they mostly serve it NOT chunky - give the veggies on the side.

Great for the summer to make ahead

From the point of view of two gazpacho lovers: Excellent!!!!!! I would use only one clove of garlic next time.

EASY - GREAT TASTE - MY FAMILY LOVED THIS ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS WAS NICE AND CHUNKY

My husband loved it!! It was the first time I made it. I used just straight tomato juice to thin, but next time will use a V8 or spicy tomato for variation. Buffalo mozzarella and hot pita wedges compliment nicely.

Excellent gazpacho! I like gazpacho thick and with lot of vegies in it so it was perfect. I added additional green pepper, cilantro, and garlic in the puree and used an English cucumber. I processed to a thick, not chunky, puree and added a 12 oz. can of Snap-E-Tom and plenty of Tabasco. I'm not sure what the olive oil was for - it could probably be reduced or eliminated.

This is the first time I see this TV show and visit this site. I'll give my response once I try these interesting receipts. Thank you for making it available for us.

I thought it was good, but a little too chunky. I liked the flavor. My wife thought it was excellant. The basil croutons were considered by both of us too be great.

My fiance said this was the best Gazpacho he ever had. I will make this over and over again. For a less chunky soup I added a small can of tomato juice and it was perfect!

Great gazpacho -- would have liked the base to be a little less chunky -- it was a meal unto itself!
