Seems a lot like regular pasta to me. Nothing special here.

Another great recipe! I tripled this recipe to make enough for six people. Only used one cup of wine. I bought fresh homemade pasta from a local pasta shop and it made all the difference. This was a winner!

I added green beans but any vegtable would work - spinach or squash. We really like this one. Enjoy, Heidi

Very easy and fast using ingredients I usually have on hand. Added tbsp tomato paste for slightly thicker sauce.

This was simple and tasty. Not a gourmet meal, but perfect for a quick weeknight dinner. I used 1 spicy Italian sausage and 2 regular with fennel. I also used fresh basil from my garden. Hubby liked and 3- year-old son liked it (minus the spicy part). I would make this again.

Great, easy.

I used soba noodles and herb sheep sausage that I bought at my local farmer's market. The sausage gave it a nice kick -- otherwise I think it would have been less flavorful. The sauce was thin until I tossed it with the pasta -- when I did that, it soaked up the excess liquid and gave the pasta more flavor.

Some complained about the sauce being too watery. To solve this issue I used tomato paste to thicken. Also used the spicy turkey sausage.

Really bland & tasteless. The sauce was watery even though I followed the quantities exactly and tried to boil the wine longer to burn more liquid off. This is not the kind of recipe I would expect from Epicurious. I definitely do not recommend this recipe.

A little bland... I added a cream sauce (cream, butter, nutmeg, garlic and parm cheese) and diced chicken. This helped!

A definite keeper. Do not leave out the wine, as it imparts an irreplacable flavor to the dish. I usually add twice the amount of diced tomatoes, more onions and sligthly more sausage that the recipe calls for, to get more of it, and it still tastes wonderful, every time.

This was a good recipe, but there was one change I thought it needed. The sauce wasn't "saucy" enough for me, so I added a can of tomato sauce to fill it out, in addition to the can of diced tomatoes the recipe calls for. Otherwise, this recipe is a keeper.

Awesome. Very quick and simple, and it doesn't require a long grocery list. I use spicier Italian sausage and a good Cabernet for the wine. Also good topped with shredded Asiago. Yummy.

This recipe was excellent, very easy to make, and quick. The wine really adds surprising depth to the flavor of the dish. I altered it a little bit, adding just 1 1/2 cups of onions instead of two cups and used one can of crushed tomatoes and a half cup of diced tomatoes.

This definitely made 3 monster portions. Fried 6 oz. of bulk Pilgrim's Pride turkey sausage and there was no fat to drain (seasoned it with Italian seasonings, and the sausage tasted great). I, too, also used only 1 cup of onion and added about 1 tsp. of fresh minced garlic. The dish turned out a bit sweet (perhaps my red bell peppers were too large). Next time I would substitute 1/2 of a green bell pepper for 1/2 of a red bell pepper. Overall this was a pretty good recipe, but not a 4-forker.

Yummy!! I took other reviewer's advice and added garlic. I let the wine reduce a bit longer than suggested to keep sauce from being too thin and turned out perfect!

I liked this recipe, but I used hot Italian sausage instead. Turkey sausage just doesn't cut it for me.

Pretty good. I used reduced fat Jimmy Dean sausage and added italian seasoning. Next time I may add tomato paste with the diced tomatoes, as the sauce wasn't "saucy" per se, just watery. It's a definite do again, though!

I took the previous cook's suggestion and used half of the onion called for in the recipe along with two small cloves of garlic. I also added about 1 tablespoon fresh diced hot pepper to the red peppers. I substituted excellent quality chicken Italian sausage instead of turkey and cut back a little on the oil. I'd say if you can't see the seasonings in the sausage (hot pepper, flecks of spices), then don't use it. Chicken sausage is much drier than turkey, and you won't get oil floating on the top. Use a good quality diced Italian plum tomato with seasoning, and you won't be sorry. I also wouldn't recommend skipping the wine, if you can help it, as it helps the flavors meld during the very short cooking time. This makes a lot - my husband and I both had healthy helpings, and there were plenty of leftovers for another meal. Very tasty, and a good recipe to keep around in a pinch.

A good beginning-- I'm looking forward to tweaking the recipe a bit. I would definitely advise draining the fat from the sausage before adding the other ingredients, as it's a pretty greasy dish. This also calls for a lot of onion, which could be scaled back some, possible with the addition of some garlic. I liked it better than my two teenage boys, but we all thought it was better the second day. I doubled the recipe and had a ton left over-- the original can easily feed 3-4 hungry people, not 2 as stated. Overall, it's good--has potential, but not yet great.

Loved this recipe! So easy to make and so full of flavor! Wonderful! Didn't change a thing and would definitly make again.

We loved this! I agree the sausage used is very important. Also, I used regular canned diced tomatoes and added my own Italian spices.

I used a high-quality local brand of spicy Italian sausage with extra garlic and incidental spices (oregano, coarse black pepper), and found this to be absolutely delicious (my mate agreed). It freezes well too. Very tasty!

I thought this would be good, and I added garlic and oregano for extra flavor. But the flavors just didn't come together and it was bland and boring.

Very simple & very good! Tastes like a traditional Tuscan meal.

I doubled this recipe. It was easy and delicious. It was even great leftover.!
