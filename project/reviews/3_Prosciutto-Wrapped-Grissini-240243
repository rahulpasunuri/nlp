brush the grissini with truffle butter and then wrap with prosciutto. The truffle butter adds so much to this recipe!

Nice, simple idea. Since fish is the only meat we eat in our house, I dipped the grissini ends in chive cream cheese, and then wrapped with a slice of smoked salmon. Guests get the prosciutto version.

It's a great little nibble to have out when your guests come, and it doesn't take much time at all. I know some people get fussy b/c it's not much of a 'recipe', but it is an idea I wouldn't have come up with on my own, and people like it. I'm going to try the Plugra suggestion below next time.

These must be served right away...otherwise the breadsticks get soggy and the whole thing is ruined.

Actually for a bit more complexity and nice presentation, try rolling the breadstick in plugra butter then wrap with a fresh basil leaf then the proscuitto. Wonderful combination of flavors and yes, I just get the store bought rosemary sticks from Central Market. I use this recipe a lot for cocktail parties at catering jobs. My clients love it. Just have patience and roll gently as the breadsticks tend to break especially when you're in a hurry.

Man you people are nasty. If you don't like it, don't bloody use it, and just say something like "Its too simple for me". Why be insulting? Are you perfect? Doubt it. Lighten up and get a life.

I turn to this again and again. Of course making the Grissini is the reason this recipe was in Gourmet!! Not simply for the technique of wrapping them with prosciutto. But I must say, the technique is superb. I have made these with store bought Rosemary grissini and making it myself. I turn to this again and again for the simplicity and how quickly they are eaten every time that I serve them.

3 fork recipe but I give it a 4 to compensate for the food snobs. Love these, and though it may seem super simple, [which it is] it allows you to present a food on its own merits. Now, you could just throw some prosciutto down on a platter but that doesn't do well for presentation. If you read the intro you could see that they KNOW it is easy but there is a reason, so you can taste the prosciutto itself. Thought I was a food snob until reading the last two comments, perfect much?

You're kidding, right? How mindless can you be. The biggest challenge must certainly be A) in which salumeria to buy the prociutto and B) do I buy grissini with or without sessame seeds.

This has to be one of the lamest recipes I have ever come across on this website. Come on people, monkeys could make this recipe.

To the cook from SJ: Grassini is the name of my ex ;op the recipe mentions Grissini which is an Italian breadstick. the idea is really to have a simple appetizer, but to be quite honest, I'm not sure it's that interesting.

What in the heck is grassini??? Never heard of it. Recipe doesn't explain. And frankly, don't care. Perhaps next time something is featured in an email, it should make a bit more sense. Or perhaps I'm not making sense. Has happened before.

Cute, Charlie. Probably making the grissini (linked recipe) makes it a bit more challenging than rolling the proscuitto.

It took me a while to figure out whether to roll these to the left or to the right, but once I got over the challenges of this recipe the results were outstanding. A keeper! I think the epicurious folks are bored for a good discussion these days (see "salted water for boiling" recipe thread)
