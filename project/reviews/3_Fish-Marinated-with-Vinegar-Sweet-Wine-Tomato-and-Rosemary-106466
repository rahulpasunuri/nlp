Excellent! Didn't think I would like the cold fish, but it was wonderful! I really like the rosemary flavor in it. It may be a little too hot for some, I thought it was great!

This was great! I needed a non-dairy fish dish for Christmas Eve dinner, and this fit in nicely. It sort of reminded me of marinated herring, but didn't taste as strong. Just be careful not to overdo the hot pepper, it can easily overpower the dish. I will definitely serve it again with a loaf of crusty hearty bread!

Loved this the sweet of the wine (used Marsala) and the sour of the veingar, no one dislikes onions more than me and didn't think they over powered this dish at all. I ate it cold my wife heated it up. Made it with Tialipia (sp?) couldn't get the snapper it called for.

Maybe this was not meant to be a dinner recipe as I served it. It is served cold and vinegar & onion flavor is very strong. This may be better served as an appetizer with crackers and mild cheese spread.
