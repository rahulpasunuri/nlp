Delicious and easy. I had red miso on hand which was fine. Walnuts a great touch to the dish. We used broccoli instead of asparagus because I had it and steamed it then seared it high heat to the dish. I think virtually any green vegetable will work.

Easy to make and delicious! I substituted oyster mushrooms and whole green beans instead of asparagus.

I tried this recipe right away last night when I saw it posted in the newsletter. Sadly we were disappointed. It was cloyingly sweet, and the sauce really didn't bring together the scallops and the asparagus. There is another scallop recipe on Epicurious for a Star Anise Orange scallops which is a far better recipe. But I agree with the other reviewer to please add more Japanese-style recipes to the site!!

Thank you for providing Japanese cooking style. As I researched Japanese food is one of the healthy meals one can have. Please do include more recipes with Japanese flavor; I really treasure them. I have not tried it yet but I am familiar with the ingredients and can not wait to serve it to my family.
