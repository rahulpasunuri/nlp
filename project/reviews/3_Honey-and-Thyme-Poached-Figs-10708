I made this recipe with one pound fresh figs instead of 1/2 pound dried. Reacting to comments of previous reviewers, I used a dry red wine to reduce sweetness, but included honey and apple juice. Also added 1/4 tsp cinnamon. Upon reduction to syrup, sweetness was just right. Serving with creme fraiche and lemon zest, as suggested, makes a tasty and interesting combination of flavors.

Took these camping and served with a triple cream brie. People thought I was a goddess! Actually altered the recipe. Used dry white wine and no apple juice. Thyme was nice, but I'm going to add rose geraniums next! Used Mission figs, but would not use them again.

This dish is fine, but not impressive. Too sweet, so omit the honey and definitely top with the mascarpone, creme fraiche, or sour cream. I couldn't taste the thyme, even though I used 1/4t dried, so would recommend increasing it.

Very intriguing combination of tastes. The marscarpone is a must. I substituted Riesling for the Sauternes, and it worked well. I would perhaps add a bit more thyme (not much). A definite keeper!!
