Texture was amazingly smooth and not at all icy...even after a few days in the freezer. I used what was available...lemon balm, mint, golden marjoram, fresh ginger and vanilla bean...and the flavor was good but we found it WAY too sweet. I suggest 2/3 cup of sugar instead of a full cup. To cut the sweetness, I added the juice of four limes and some lime zest and remixed it into a spectacular lime sherbet.

My garden isn't doing very well this year, basil, coriander, lemon thyme all died. All I had in large enough quantities was peppermint and spearmint. It was fantastic! my husband insists we have it in the house at all times and that I increase the size of the mint patch next year. I used 2% milk on my first attempt and it was amazing, just a bit more difficult to scoop verses my whole milk attempts.

I made this with about a quarter of it heavy cream. The herbs I used were peppermint, lavender, lemongrass, and vanilla bean. It was fantastic!

I made this using almond milk instead of milk (I am slightly lactose intolerant and I decided that soy or rice milk just wouldn't cut it) and it worked beautifully. I also used lemon grass instead of lemon balm, and aniseed instead of tarragon. Having no fresh lavender on hand, I used dried. I doubled the recipe, and everybody loved it. Every bite tasted a little different because of the different herbs. I really reccommend it, and I will make it again for St. Patrick's (with green food colouring!)

I made the herb infusion in 1 2/3 c. milk, and converted this to a no-cook recipe by substituting half and half for the rest of the milk and 4 oz. egg beaters for the yolks. I omitted the constarch.

I would give this 3 1/2 forks. I loved the lightness of the ice milk vs normal heavy cream Ice cream. The five herbs were delicious. I replaced the tarragon with fresh oregano. I served it on top of the plum buckle also on this site. By the end of the evening every bit was gone.

I made this using 5 cinnamon sticks instead of the herbs and used skim milk because that was all I had on hand. Delicious! Still creamy and with lots of cinnamon flavor. I added a little ground cinnamon just before freezing.

WOW! I awed guests with the magic of these five herbs. I asked around the table what herbs were included. Having seen my garden, and as the recipe says, they were able to identify all of them. Sublime!

This had the subtle 'hint' of Chartreuse liqueur to me. Very nice. Had all five herbs growing in pots. Best when freshly made and served. I served it alongside fresh blackberries.
