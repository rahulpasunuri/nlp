I made this for the first time two years ago and it's been back by popular demand ever since. I leave out the orange marmalade. It's sweet enough without it.

Who would have guessed that raw cranberries and an unpeeled orange would be edible, never mind delicious. This is a really great recipe - make sure you chop the ginger up pretty finely, or people get a shock. You can use a mandarin or an orange and it works just as well (and no seeds)

I made this last year along with the Cranberry and Dried Cherry sauce (on this site) to give guests a choice between fresh and cooked sauces. It was excellent, esp. after sitting in the fridge for a few days to meld.

Definately something that I will make again. I used an organic orange instead of a tangerine though because the tangerines in the store were waxed. Unfortunately it lost its ginger flavor as it sat.

This was great for Thanksgiving, but a little too sweet for my taste. I used 1/2 c sugar and will slightly decrease next time. I also added a splash of orange juice, but may try lemon or lime juice for added tartness.

This was a great addition to our Thanksgiving table. I will definitely make this again!

I never much liked cranberry sauces until I made this one. It is incredibly easy, incredibly easy to master and makes you seem like a star in the kitchen! I've never made it without having the majority of guests clamor for the 'secret' (it's amazing how few have identified the crystallized ginger). I, too, reduce the sugar content as the thing tastes much better IMO when straddling the line between sweet and tart. Make it about 2 days ahead so the flavors really have a chance to mingle. I've read that some people would prefer their cranberries cooked, but I have to say that I can't IMAGINE this recipe that way. The crunchiness and freshness that come from having the ingredients raw are what make this recipe truly distinctive. I plan to make this every Thanksgiving/Christmas from now on.

Very good - everyone I make this for wants the recipe. Easy, tasty, simple. I do cut down the sugar, though - 3/4 cup is way too much. 1/2 cup will do nicely, and since I like the tartness, I tend to cut it back even further when making it just for myself.

Absolutely awesome - definitely make this a couple of days ahead of time so the flavours can meld.

It was quick & easy, but I would make it at least a week ahead of time. It tasted better after a a few days when the bitterness from the citrus peel mellowed a bit.

I loved this--it was my favorite part of the entire Thanksgiving meal. I found myself eating it directly out of the container with a spoon the day after Thanksgiving. Made it with the crystallized ginger mini-chips that I bought from King Arthur Flour--they were just the right size and required no chopping!

Made this the night before so it could stew in its own juices ~ was a huge hit, even with picky family members. I ate gobs of it, and I have never liked cranberry dishes of any kind. You have GOT to like ginger, though... I do so two big thumbs up for this zesty, tangy treat.

it's very fresh and tangy.

Each year I make a different cranberry sauce. Last year, on a recommendation from a friend to try a relish, I tried this one. Besides being so easy to prepare everyone raved about it and they are insisting I make it again this year.

Are cranberry relishes usually raw? My husband and I liked this as written. It was really good with the ham as well as the turkey.

Great! Fast, easy, and tasty. On the whole I have an aversion to cranberries, and yet every year they rear their ugly little red heads. Enter this recipe! It's really tasty. I find that the fairly coarse chop on the ingredients helps it layer in the mouth well. Make it two days ahead.

We just had this relish for Thanksgiving 2002 -- my family went wild for it and asked that I make it again this week to have with chicken. The only change I made was to reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup as we don't like things too sweet -- ginger added so much to this relish! I'll make it again and again.

This was very nice. I do prefer a cooked cranberry sauce however and will stick with that.

Perfect just as is! So fresh tasting and easy too! The easiest part of Thanksgiving dinner- my 4 yr. old made it. I just supervised the food processor. Everyone loved it!

I agree with one of the other cooks, the flavors go well together but I would have preferred it cooked. I wish I would have thought to boil it. Maybe it would have gone over better with my guests. I'll try it again,but cooked next time!

easy to make, delicious as well as distinctive and memorable taste. A keeper.

I made this early this morning and tasted it about 8 hours later. I love all of these flavors together, but I actually thought it needed to be COOKED. I just didn't like it "raw". I brought it to a boil and then took it off the heat. Now, I love it.
