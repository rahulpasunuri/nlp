Like kphilbin, I made this for two people (four quail) with the full amount of sauce. The sauce is absolutely fantastic, and I paired it with green beans and mashed potatoes. I didn't really appreciate the chestnuts, though - they don't seem to add anything to the taste, and I think the texture is off-putting. But otherwise, a fantastic use of quail.

Tasty but I wouldn't make it again, only because there's little to no meat on a quail. The chestnuts were a wild card, too - some liked them, some didn't. And the quails were too small to prevent my husband from puling a frozen dinner out of the freezer afterward and declaring it "the main course".

I made this recipe for Valentine's Day, and it was truly delicious. I made 4 quail for 2 people, but did not reduce the quantities for the sauce or the grapes and chestnuts, and it worked out well. The sauce in particular had a wonderful complex flavor, probably the tastiest I have ever made. It was also not hard, just took a while to execute. The only thing I might try next time is ordering the jumbo quail from D'Artagan instead of the regular sized quail that I used this time, since they really are tiny. I will definitely make this again.
