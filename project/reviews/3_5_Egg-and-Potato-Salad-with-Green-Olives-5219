Based on feedback that this recipe was balnd and runny, I made the following changes and it turned out well. I omitted the milk. I increased the dijon mustard plus a hint of sugar. I added Rosemary. I added capers.

A similar recipe to one my grandmother used to make. Though, yes a bit bland, with such a simple recipe, it's not hard to spice it up with some chili powder, cayenne or just some of that olive juice. Great starter recipe and easily modified. Use your imagination next time San Diego!

Terribly bland and boring! Will not make it again.

What a great and easy salad to make! I made it for an impromtu party because it is so quick. A few people commented that they usually don't like olives, but they added just the right amount of saltiness.

This was so good, everyone ate too much. But with big smiles on there faces. My husband wanted to have leftover's for breakfast. I used a little less mustard and less vinigar but a little more olives & pimento. Next time I will add the olive juice also.

Really tasty! I have to admit though I used whole milk and regular mayo.

This is a recipe I've been making for almost 30 years. I'm of pure Irish heritage and this is one of my families favourite recipe's. I think the person who said it was runny, simply may have added too much milk. Probably by accident, and hoped it would work out. They should try it again. Possibly using 1 or 2% milk instead of nonfat. This may make a difference in the consistency and yet will still be low in fat.

I thought this sounded so good but it was terrible. It was runny. I do not know why it needed the milk. It would have been better if it was mayo (and the other ingredients) only without the milk. Would not make again.
