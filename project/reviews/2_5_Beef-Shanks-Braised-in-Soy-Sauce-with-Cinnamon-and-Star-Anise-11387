In fairness, I used a leaner cut of meat, because that's what was in the freezer. However, the flavor did not thrill me, and I ended up doctoring up the finished dish with sraracha and sesame oil to give it some flavor. I think this is the first time I've given a negative on an "epi" recipe, but I won't be making this again.

I actually made this recipe as written - a bit of an anomaly here - but I digress ... I wanted to love this dish & I happened to have all the delicious ingredients on hand but alas, the flavor of the finished dish fell flat. Also not loving the turnips, but at least I used them & tried to like them. Had the sauce been thicker & more intense, I probably would have liked the flavors more. Perhaps reducing the liquid a bit more would improve the dish? Just a suggestion for others, since I won't be making it again.

Hey 'Ping', who the h**l said that this recipe WAS Chinese???

This was so very tasty. Although not all aspects are Chinese, it was a delightful alternative to how I normally cook something like this. I will serve this for company!

On the rating scale, I liked this dish, but I didn't love it. Maybe I would make it again, but most likely try to find another recipe. I used beef short ribs instead of shanks, and I used sherry instead of scotch. The flavor was intense and my guests enjoyed the meal...even taking leftovers home...I personally thought that it lacked luster.

An authentic oriental beef noodle taste but I would prefer to use Japenese Soba or Ramen noodles. I also adapted the recipe to a rather exotic casserole.
