I used a multi-grain bread and smoked pork chops. It was very good but next time I would use less ham and more chicken stock.

This was really good. It was a great combination of flavors and made just enough for our family of 10 with some leftovers for the next day.

I placed slices of chicken breast on top of the stuffing and they baked perfectly for a one pan dish. I also left out the ham. Next time I will try substituting pecans for the hazelnuts.

I made this for Christmas and was told by my family that I need to make this every WEEK for the rest of my life! By far the best stuffing I've ever made for any holiday dinner. I left out the bell peppers (just because I don't like them) and added more broth than was called for, but otherwise followed the recipe. The ham hocks were a pain, so next time I will use pancetta or prosciutto and possibly substitute macadamia nuts for the hazelnuts. It gets 24 thumbs up from my guests!

Since this was my first attempt at this recipe, I made a test batch a couple of days before Thanksgiving to make sure it would turn out OK. I used thickly sliced prosciutto and leeks, and left out the green pepper and celery as we don't like them. Didn't bother with the parsley. I couldn't find toasted hazelnuts, so I just bought a bag of regular ones and toasted them myself. It initially turned out like dry croutons in a bowl with ham and cherries tossed in, but it was still tasty. On Thanksgiving, I beat two eggs in the broth and mixed it in before putting the stuffing in the pan. I mixed in the goat cheese but then crumbled additional goat cheese on top before putting the foil on. It turned out much better that way, but I think next time I will use three eggs and a little more broth. Everyone really liked this stuffing. I will probably make this again and serve it with rotisserie chicken.

This was the stuffing I served with our Thanksgiving ham this year (after 30+ turkeys over the years, I'm ready for something different!) and it was truly amazing. I did use chevre and store-bought stuffing cubes instead of what the recipe called for; the consensus is that this could be a casserole-type main course with just a little massaging. Regardless, it'll be making repeat appearances at our holiday table for years to come.

Made this for a Thanksgiving dinner last year for about 20 people and got rave reviews and requests for the recipe. Definitely do this one again.

We really enjoy this recipe and have made it several years in a row. Those complaining about a strong feta taste should switch to soft goat cheese (chevre) instead. Super delicious ... takes a bit more time, but it's worth it.

This turned out dee-lish! I used cibatta cut in smallish 1 inch chunks, twice as many cherries, and definitely more broth than is called for. yum!

I love this recipe! I add my own twist to it by replacing the cherries with pomegranate and the ham with pancetta. It's now a yearly tradition at my house.

This stuffing was amazing! I made it last year for Thanksgiving and will again this year. Yes, it's a bit more intensive to make than a box of stove top, but well worth it! My husband still raves about it. It was by far the best thing on the table and was terrific as leftovers.

I used store bought bread crumbs and substituted cranberries for cherries and doubled the amount of them. This is the best stuffing I've made and I am doing it again for Christmas. Everyone loved it.

Time consuming to make but so delicious. It was a big hit at Thanksgiving, and we thought it tasted just as good, if not better the next day as leftovers. It was a lot of food, even for my biggest pot, so I think it would be easier to make in smaller portions, but for a big family meal, this was perfect!

I thought this was ok, but would probably use store-bought bread cubes next time. Aside from the texture of the bread, the other things in this stuffing were delicious. I altered the recipe so it would be vegetarian-friendly (veggie broth, 1/2 cup pecans in place of the ham) and used dried cranberries in place of dried cherries. I'd make it again, but would want to experiment more to get the texture right before serving it to guests.

My guests loved it. To me, it was just a notch below excellent. The finished texture was great and I loved the cherries. Like another person here, I need extra broth (used homemade turkey stock), but that was really no big deal.

Wonderful combination of cherries, goat cheese, ham, hazelnuts, & herbs. Mine needed additional broth, probably because of the bread I used which was quite dense.

This was fabulous for Thanksgiving! Guests said it was the "standout dish" of the evening. I just purchased a bag of hazelnuts from the baking section - already toasted. I recommend adding the cheese in large crumbs since the heat of the broth melts it easily, and refrain from overmixing once the cheese is added. The cheese is more distinct. I used italian parsley. Don't worry if the edges get "crusty" or appear overcooked - guests said they liked that part the best!

This is a good idea, but needs lots of adjusting. I would cut the bread in 1/2 inch cubes, make the veggies a little bigger, add a little more fresh goat cheese. Maybe add some sort of seasoning. Didn't even notice the cherries.

This may actually be the best stuffing we've ever had. It's a heart attack in a pan, but it's only 1 day a year! It's a keeper!

This tasted overwhelmingly of celery, feta and smoked ham. I felt it was out of balance. I added garlic powder to the leftovers and they were much better, I also ate them with cranberry sauce (I felt the tart cherries did not counterbalance the other strong tastes enough). One could hardly taste the hazelnuts, although without them it might have tasted different...

We made this for a Thanksgiving dinner party last year and it was by far the best Thanksgiving dish we've ever had. Our guests all wanted the recipe before they left. We usually like to try different stuffings every year, but I think we will be doing this again for many years to come.

I used walnuts because they were available. Being English I served this as a side for Christmas Day dinner. The previous reviews were spot-on. Every guest raved about the stuffing. Prep the previous evening and follow the recipe precisely. Excellent!

This was really great stuffing and everyone loved the finished product! I will definitely make again.

Wonderful. I used thick sliced smoked ham from the deli counter and dried cranberries (which I forgot to soak first) instead of the cherries because I couldn't find them. This stuffing got rave reviews and there were sadly NO leftovers!

Made it this year for Thanksgiving. Everybody said it was the best part of the menu! I used regular ham instead of the ham hocks and substituted almonds for the hazelnuts.

I made this last year. It was my first thanksgiving and I wanted something new next to the old. It was fantastic! I justed blackforest ham cubed instead! FYI.Skipped the nuts because of allergy.

NO! DON'T USE THE HAM HOCKS! the whole stuffing was beautiful until it was tarnished by the rubbery car-tire texture of the hocks. Substitute with bacon or prociutto or even diced ham. JUST DON'T USE THE HOCKS!

I normally don't care for stuffing - too much sage, too much sausage, it's just not my taste. This one was different and delicious. The fact that it is made in a dish rather than in a bird means I'll be using it more than just at Christmas and Thanksgiving! I didn't soak the cherries, and they were still moist and tasty. I added three garlic cloves instead of one, and used chopped prosciutto ham which was OK, but really this recipe doesn't need the meat. You could definitely add a bit more cheese to compensate.

This was the best new stuffing recipe I have made in years! I did cheat a little and use bread crumbs from a box, but added some smoked tenderloin that we had on smoker with the turkey and that really added a lovely punch! The hazlenuts complimented the green bean dish I made, which also included hazlenuts, and the tartness of the cherries and the goat cheese really cut thru the smoke of the turkey. Everyone agreed it was the best stuffing they had ever had! Thanks BA, for making my turkey dinner so outstanding this year!

This was my favorite part of the whole Thanksgiving dinner. It's just so good, with the cheese and ham and the tartness of the cranberries (I used them instead of cherries) and the thyme. If my whole Thanksgiving dinner floped, I knew this would save the evening. It's a dish to be repeated throughout the year. Enjoy!

This was one of the best stuffings I have had in years.

This stuffing smells like Thanksgiving. The most difficult part of this recipe was removing the meat from the ham hocks but it was certainly worth the effort. The hazelnuts had a nice texture. This will be a regular part of my Thankgiving dinner rotation.
