It was a bit difficult to make, but it was quite delicious! I used rum instead.

I love this pie! It's now a Thanksgiving tradition, but after the first year I made a few substitutions: dried cherries instead of currants, and bourbon instead of apple brandy. And lazy as I am, I use a store-bought pie crust. It's always a big hit.

I am surprised by the previous reviews for this recipe -- I found this pie to be quite unusual. I made only minor changes: a pinch of cloves, a bit more cinnamon, Braeburn apples i/o Granny Smith, calvados i/o apple jack, and more thickly sliced fruit. The calvados flavor was still bright after cooking even through the caramel. I am making it again for Thanksgiving but I will try it as a tart this time.

I agree; this pie looked better before it was baked and when it was baked, it was very bland. Kind of like a boring apple pie--all the great ingredients just melded into a nondescript filling. I really wished I had spent the time on creating something else.

Too much effort for a very bland and ordinary result. The crust was nice, and a change from the standard pastry, but the pie had no real special flavor - the currants, pears, brandy and caramel flavors were totally absent. In the future, I will use the crust on a traditional apple pie recipe.
