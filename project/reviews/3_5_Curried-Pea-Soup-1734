I rarely remember to review recipes but I have to review this soup. I had been carrying around a page from BonAppetit with this recipe for at least 5 years just recently decided to try it.My cook made it for us for a big party and it was absolutely sensational.Everyone wanted a copy of the recipe,including my cook.You really must use the yogurt mixture or you will not get the gist of the soup.It is beyond brilliant and undoubtedly the best soup on your website!

This was just a fine, simple soup and excellent for powering through the extra bags of peas in my freezer. Use an immersion blender to puree it; and if you don't have this great little tool treat yourself to one today. $25-40 and completely eliminates the mess and fuss of making blended soups. My curry powder was a bit tired so I brightened the flavour with some Angostura bitters. Call it cheating, but it works a treat.

I was worried about trying this one after reading some of the reviews and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised- the pea soup was anything but bland and my 1 year old loved it! Thanks Epicurious!!!

Really liked this, but thought it was a bit thin. Next time I'll throw in a potato.

My husband and I loved this soup. Forgot to make the yogurt-cilantro for the side--which we could have used considering all the heat. A delicious soup. Next time might add carrots and celery.

This dish definitely deserves four forks as it was the hit of my dinner party and was so easy to make! I made as is but substituted vegetable stock for chicken. Also sprinkled a spicy cruncy Indian cracker dried pea mix on top of the yogurt before serving. It was really good!

my husband and I really enjoy this soup. I am not a pea soup person but this is delicious. I serve it with Tandoori, Saag and jasmine rice.

Very quick and easy. I'll definitely make it again. I served it with stuffed red peppers and garlic mashed potatoes.

Overall very tasty and easy if you remember not to fill your blender more than half full with hot liquid! I thought I could speed things up and cheat the amount just a little..... What a mess! Substituted mint for cilantro in the topping - it was excellent!

This was really good. I had one guest who really didn't like pea soup that loved it. I doubled the recipie to serve for 8- however, I'd use a little less curry.

This was great - quick and easy to make, satisfying and yummy (and I am not a pea soup fan!)- you definitely need to make the yogurt garnish as it really makes the soup.

Excellente! I used hot curry which made the dish quite hot however the yogurt mix cooled it just enough. Plan to use 1/2 hot and 1/2 mild curry next time out. I used 1 red onion for the soup and from that just saved 1/4 cup out for the yogurt mix and it worked fine. Very easy to make and superb result.

I added ground toasted cumin seed to the yogurt mixture with excellent results. Also, I used a mixture of fresh and frozen peas.

I used a hot curry powder and this made the soup even more delicious. I also used Tzaziki, now that I am living in Greece, for the yogurt topping and just added dried cilantro instead because fresh is not possible to buy.

This soup is a big hit with my husband. It has a fresh subtle flavor that makes it my favorite pea soup
