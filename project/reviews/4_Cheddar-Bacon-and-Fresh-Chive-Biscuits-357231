These were fantastic! Even my fussy husband loved them - we had them with beef bourguignon. I made half a batch, added an extra piece of bacon and also some parmesan. I didn't have any buttermilk , so made up some sour milk with lime (I didn't have any lemon or plain vinegar. They were a hit!

I doubled this recipe to take to a bake sale. I just taste tested my first biscuit and it was scrumptious. I forgot to buy bacon at the store so my biscuits are just cheddar biscuits, I added some cracked black pepper to give a little spice. I gave this recipe two forks because the batter was super dry I ended up using all the buttermilk I had plus some water to make the dough come together properly. After I took the biscuits out I went to remove them from the sheets and they had cooked to the paper. Next time I think I will go a little lighter on the cheese to avoid the stick-age and maybe butter the sheets before I put down the paper. and definitely add the bacon.

These are ridiculously good. Some alterations- I used more bacon (8 slices or so), all-purpose flour, green onions, and added about a teaspoon of garlic powder. YUM.

Delicious! Moist and very flavourful. I used and aged cheddar for more punch.

I love this recipe. There was a review that said they were bland, but I found them to be anything but. I may use one extra piece of bacon as well- but with 6 they were still completely delicious. I cooked off about a third of the dough for some friends and they really loved them. I live alone, so I had quite a bit of dough left over which I brought to my parent's house (with a few biscuits made already) and they were a big hit with them too!! They didn't even freeze the dough, made them for the next couple days and ate them all!!! :) Dad's favorite new biscuit. My boyfriend is coming into town tomorrow with a friend, and I'll have these handy to snack on and will definitely make breakfast sandwiches with them too!!

These biscuits were delicious! I decided to roll them and use a round biscuit cutter because I wanted a finished look versus the rustic drop biscuit. They were beautiful, split in half with mustard and thinly sliced ham. I served them with gazpacho. A big hit!

These were a big hit. Best when served the same day they were baked.

awesome biscuits. made this to go with TG dinner. was a fantastic hit. used medium cheddar because I was scared, however next time sharp will be the way to go because it really isn't too strong tasting. and next time 7 pieces of bacon! used one of those hand pastry cutting tool because I didn't have a food processor. worked fabulously. I'm pretty sure I stole the show on TG!

I have to admit that I only made this recipe because I came across it and had to use all of the perishable ingredients it uses. I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with a very nice batch of biscuits; howeever, all of us (including my kids) were underwhelemed--they were mildly tasty, but not what I would expect for all of that extra sharp cheddar (chich I used), bacon and chives. I would probably make this again--it would be good with chili or something--but wouldn't recommend it either.

Delicious! And I scrambled some eggs and made a breakfast sandwich with the biscuit, perfect for a quick breakfast!

This is a pretty standard powder biscuit recipe with the buttermilk being the exception and it's a very nice addition. Powder biscuits don't traditionally have much flavor. They are used almost exclusively to soak up the rich broths of soups and stews. That these have flavors, subtle and tasty, makes them stand out and versatile. A nice accompaniement.

Yummy. I had only whole wheat bread flour, so I used white all-purpose flour, and it worked fine. I made them the size called for, but I think I will reduce the size next time. I wasn't sure about drizzling them with honey, but I'm glad I tried it. I loved them the way they were, but I have variations going through my head. I think I might try them with some blue cheese, or maybe sliced ham and gruyere in the biscuit, rather than as a sandwich as some of you have deliciously suggested!

Fantastic biscuits. My whole family loves them. They are a step up from what I find on Food Network!

My favorite day is waking in the morning & knowing I am off from work and cooking/baking a new recipe. These biscuits and Epicurious's Lima Bean Soup were my plan. The biscuits came out beautifully....I overfilled a large 1/3 cup ice cream scoop to = the 1/2 cup and although I have a well stocked pantry, opted for the tip from another reviewer, using AP flour without any problem - the biscuits rose well. I'm also glad for the tip from Epicurious as well....the biscuits cut in half with slices of ham off the bone, Dijon mustard, and a slice of gruyere [hubby, the cheese lover's suggestion] were heavenly to accompany that lima bean soup. I agree with many that these neither screamed out bacon or cheese, but the subtlety of flavor was just right to me. We ate four and I froze the remaining 8, hoping they will be just as delicious down the road as well. They would be great with scrambled eggs for breakfast.

We thought these were delicious. They bake up exactly like the photo. I followed the recipe, except for adding 2 tsp. garlic powder as recommended by an earlier poster- - the garlic powder probably adds the extra ooomph that other folks thought these needed, but 2 tsp. was not very noticeable. Next time I might try cayenne too. I also plan to cut back the salt to 1 tsp as I found these a bit too salty w/ the -- bacon and cheese. I used a slightly heaping ice cream scoop and thought they were a perfect size.

As a first-time biscuit maker, I am relieved that this recipe is as forgiving as can be. It took me forever since I kept second-guessing myself and I was convinced I didn't do *anything* right. The store only had light buttermilk; the bacon I used was unexceptional; I don't have a food processor so I used a hand mixer; I have neither parchment paper nor stoneware (like jjanemin) so I used a cookie sheet and had to cut them off the sheet with a knife. Much to my surprise here I am eating a golden, flaky crusted, moist interiored, downright tasty biscuit with butter and honey. I didn't need extra buttermilk--there's a heck of a lot of cheese involved helping to hold the biscuits together. The 1/2 cup size makes for a hefty biscuit that can easily act as a sandwich base; next time I'll go for 1/3 or 1/4 cup scoops. As both Jillulrich and hwoodm wrote earlier, the flavor is missing a little something ...at least when there's not a chunk of bacon involved! Maybe the light buttermilk is to blame? Or perhaps I need sharper cheddar. If anyone comes up with a successful solution, please post! I suppose that the subtlety is what makes the biscuits versatile enough to function as sweet (with honey and butter) OR savory (with Dijon mustard and ham), but next time I'll hold out for regular buttermilk, use more chives and more potent tasting bacon (D'Artagnan makes an incredible wild boar bacon I think might be perfect), and I'll get some super extra-sharp Canadian cheddar.

These biscuits were quite tasty. Enjoyed them with Beef Stew last night. Next time I make them, however, I would make them 1/4 cup size, not 1/2 cup size. The 1/2 cupper is just too big. I would also add a bit more cheese, probably wouldn't use the bacon (didn't feel the bacon really added much to the overall flavor), increase the chives and add finely chopped fresh serrano chilis.

these biscuits are phenomenal. I had made the bacon the day before, so I measured out the buttermilk and cubed the butter first and then put them in the freezer. it it was summer I probably would have stuck the flour in the freezer too after measuring it all out. the dough was drier than the recipe describes, but it all turned out fine once they baked. next time I will probably fold the dough out and cut it into squares. I used a new zealand grass fed white chedder that wasn't supper sharp but it worked great. Next time I'll reserve a little cheese to sprinkle on top before baking.

Delicious! I made these exactly as the recipe says and they came out amazing! We put butter and honey on the warm biscuts and had a delicious breakfast!

Decided to make these on a cold morning and did everything wrong. I used all purpose flour. Didn't have any buttermilk so I soured some sweet milk. Didn't have enough cheddar so I used what was in the fridge -- some cheddar, some Mexican mixed cheese, some garlic cheddar & some parm/reg. Grumbled as I mixed in a bowl that was barely large enough (this makes a LARGE amount of dough). Didn't have enough parchment so I used my stoneware. Baked as directed and expected the worst. What I ended up with were fantastic, delicious biscuits with a light crispy crust. I will definitely make this recipe again. Maybe I'll follow the directions, maybe not. Absolutely delicious.

I made these yesterday for my sweetie. Yummy! I had to add extra buttermilk as the batter was a little dry. I cut the butter in without using the food processer...easy! Would make these again.

Followed the recipe exactly (food processor makes the process a snap), and these biscuits were absolute heaven. Perfect in the morning - warmed up and drizzled with honey. YUM

I made two batches of these little treats for my sisters baby shower to be eaten with honey baked ham. It was my first time making biscuits and they were easy as can be to make. the flavor was good, but not great. it was missing something. maybe my cheddar wasn't sharp enough. I will make them again. I just might tweek them a little. I'm more of a cook, not a baker, so I'll have to think what I can do to make them "WoW". Everyone loved them though! they were every bit as pretty as the picture!

I made this recipe to bring to a recent party. I almost doubled it because of the small serving size, but I'm very glad I didn't. With no food processor, I used my hands and the biscuits came out nice and fluffy. I made 2-bite biscuits by hand and got probably 35 or so. I uh, may have used more bacon than stated. They were a huge hit.

These biscuits were good but I would not say they were great. They were east to make though. I don't know why but I felt something was missing... The recipe calls for so much cheese and a fair amount of bacon and chives yet it is almost hard to taste all those yummy flavors I don't know why though. I would make them again, they are good just wish they were great!!!

I made these biscuits except I halved the size using about 1/4 cup. We served them with my husband's smoked pork shoulder and BBQ sauce. The dish rocked!

These biscuits were soooo good! I doubled the recipe which was a mistake as I had tons of leftovers. I made them smaller than directed using a scoop that holds an 1/8 cup, which I overflowed. I did not use bacon. I used lowfat buttermilk. I used 14 ounces of 2% sharp cheddar cheese. I thought this was plenty of cheese even thought I doubled the rest of the ingredients. I added 2 tsp. garlic powder. I baked the biscuits for about 14-15 minutes. Reminded me of Red Lobster's biscuits.

Great biscuits!! If adding ham and dijon go easy on the dijon as it overpowers the bacon and cheddar. Great the second day toasted with an egg for breakfast.
