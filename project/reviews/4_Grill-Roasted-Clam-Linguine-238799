Clams and mussels have been my nemesis. I have NEVER been able to cook them at home in a satisfying way. Well, this recipe changed that alright! First, I used a couple of tablespoons of a pre-made garlic butter from Whole Foods in lieu of the olive oil and fresh garlic (just cuz I was lazy). I also cut back on the lemon (used about 1/4 of what he recipe called for) and it was perfect! I can see how too much lemon might overwhelm this recipe. When I first tasted the sauce, the anchovy taste was overwhelming but after adding in the linguine and clams it was PERFECT. I used live manila clams and soaked them in water for about an hour and scrubbed them to death. Only 1 stubborn clam had a teeny bit of grit; the rest were spectacular. For added flavor, I soaked the cooked linguine in the pan with the sauce while I grilled the clams. Then put the pasta in a large round bowl with some grated parmesan regianno and pecorino romano ( i know that seafood pasta is not supposed to have grated cheese but it added a tanginess and rounded out the dish). Then I added the grilled clams to the remaining sauce on the stove and cooked on high for a few minutes, basted the clams in the sauce and then poured the whole pot into the pasta bowl. DELISH!!!!

This recipe was nice and fresh-tasting, but it had WAY too much lemon, and I even used less than what the recipe called for. My brother found it amusing to repeatedly tell me, as we were eating, that it could use a little more lemon. Anyway, I think that I agree with the people who said that grilling the clams didn't really add anything, and if you were to make the sauce in a bigger pot and then steam the clams in there, the cleanup would not really be effected. I would say that this could be a nice weeknight go-to recipe, but clams are a little expensive for that. So overall, I would have to say that I probably won't be making this again.

I found grilling the clams did not leave the broth with enough "clam taste". It was a bit to lemony. Next time I will steam the clams like someone else did below and use the broth. It was good as written, but I am sure will be fabulous with some minor adjustments.

On the way back from Mexico this weekend I scooped up some clams from the market to use in this dish. What really captured my interest was grilling the clams, which was easy. The clams' juices cooked off quickly, but this didn't seem to affect the overall taste too much. As a personal preference, I added extra garlic and a bit more red pepper flakes. Everything turned out excellent.

I have made clam linguine many times and this is now my favorite recipe. my husband was raving about it and had three helpings. Grilling the clams really brings out their flavor. I used foil to cook them and this helped to catch their liquid. I highly recommend SOAKING the clams for 20 minutes in cold water with a couple of tablespoons of corn meal (or without if you don't have it). This causes the clams to spit out their sand. I have had a couple of dinners ruined by skipping this step. then lightly scrub the clam shells. I put the linguine and clams directly into the sauce once they were cooked and finished the pasta in the sauce which resulted in the pasta being perfectly coated with the sauce. (Some of the pasta water made it into the sauce) It was great!

This recipie is easy, healthy and marvelously tasty! The only change that I made to it was to heat the clams in a large, hot saute pan, instead of the grill. Then, after I pour the clam liquor ove the pasta, I deglazed the evaporated clam liquor with a little of the pasta water and poured it over the pasta. This is also a great recipie for those who are lactose intolerant.

I've made this numerous times when we've been at the beach--pure and simple, with good fresh little neck clams, this tastes like the ocean. Light,slightly salty, slightly lemony. The anchovies really make it too. We sprinkle a little fresh grated parmesan on it. The sauce just smells and tastes divine. Serve with a nice Vinho Verde or other great summer wine. Although I do laugh at the recipe description, "No big, heavy pot is needed." Well you do have to cook the pasta in something!

Loved the sauce. The clams were just ok. I would used the sauce to steam mussles in.

Well I hate to be the dissenting vote here but my husband and I both hated this.I was so disappointed after all of the rave reviews. All we could taste was lemon, and I even used a little less than the recipe called for. We threw it away and ate salad

Best white clam sauce I have ever made or tasted. Easy too!

Covering the grill grates with foil and rubbling it will a bit of olive oil will solve the problems removing the clams from the grill! I love this recipe!

We made this tonight and loved it! The sauce was so good (though I did add 1/2 bottle of clam juice). We loved watching the clams open, though it was tough to transfer the clams from the grill without losing the juice (hence, the extra clam juice). Big keeper in this family! The only big pot was the one for the linguine! This will be the only way we make clams from now on! Served with crusty bread for soaking up the sauce and a Caesar salad.

Excellent, The grilled clams make it an outstanding dish and it is lighter then the usual white clam sauce. The only problem we have had is removing the clams from the grill and retaining their juice. I have added a bottle of clam juice to make up for the loss

I prepared this dish last night for 8 people, so I doubled the recipe. It was fabulous! I entertain a lot, and have made lots of pasta and seafood dishes, but this was extraordinary! I followed the recipe exactly - and made the sauce ahead to avoid last minute craziness. I agree to serve it with warm bread to sop up the delicious juices. My guests enjoyed watching the clams open up on the grill - a fun way of preparing them!

Great sauce! I tested 4 recipes last night on my husband and two friends in preparation for my neighbors 75th birthday celebration (Im grilling a main dish for 20). All were huge hits and Ill mention the other recipes later. Because I had so many things going on, I prepared the sauce well in advance, then simply reheated while the pasta cooked. So easy! I used anchovy paste instead of the fillets since my Montana store lacked the fillets (but I could buy 10 varieties of canned sardines, go figure). The three I cooked for love hot and spicy, yet I have a sensitive palate, so I thought it was just perfect heat, while they couldnt tell it contained any spicy ingredient. Great dish. The other experiments last night: Grilled jumbo shrimp with lemon and oregano, chile rubbed shrimp with avocado corn cocktail, BBQ beef ribs with molasses- bourbon sauce. My guests raved about all!

Fabulous! Doubled this recipe for a crowd and got rave reviews. I steamed the clams rather than grilling and then served them on top of the cooked pasta in a big white bowl. Very pretty and delicious. I'll definitely make this again.

This is a great white clam sauce recipe. So fresh tasting and lite, yet plenty hearty. Love the lemon. The only thing I changed was: instead of the wine alone, I used about a cup of wine and 1/3 cup clam juice from a can of chopped clams for the reduction and added the clams themselves at the end with the anchovy etc. Crusty bread and a Caesar salad were great sides.

Easy, yummy and gorgeous. I used a pinot gris for the wine and kicked up the garlic and red pepper. My guests loved it. For extra grilling fun, I started out with grilled figs wrapped in pancetta with a little goat cheese and drizzled basalmic.

This was fantabulous and easy! I did the clams on the grill. It was fun watching them pop open and because all the juices were in the shell cleanup was a breeze. I added grilled japanese eggplant, zucchini and roasted red peppers to the pasta. A piece of French bread is also essential to sop up the sauce.

Made this dish last night for my husband. Split the recipe in half just for two - it was absolutely fabulous. Oh, and I steamed instead of grilled the clams to save time preparing/cleaning the grill.
