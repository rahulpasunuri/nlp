I just made this and it was delicious! It was easy and if you really like sage like I do, you can add more sage. The crisp fried sage as a garnish was different and very good. For those that said this lacks flavor, make sure you add enough salt and pepper to taste. DELICIOUS!

This is incredible - the best pasta I've ever made! And so easy, too! I added the squash as it suggested, and it was perfect. The crispy sage leaves are the best part, so delicious. I will definitely make this again, maybe adding some pancetta for protein.

Such a scrumtious, very rich dish. We loved it on it's own as a main dish, but it would be a great companion to a roasted chicken. Buttery goodness!

Excellent! Great for a light evening meal. Added only 1/2 of the butter & still very buttery,but delicious!

This was an absolutely fabulous dish! I used the egg fettucini that it calls for, knowing that it has so much more body and richness than regular pasta, and I definitely recommend it - regular pasta would not have been the same. The fried sage leaves are divine.....such a scrumptious dish! Can't wait to make it again!

Perfect with my fresh sage from the garden.

Fabulous! I used tortellini, but besides that followed the recipe. I didn't even use all the best ingredients and it still turned out great. I wasn't convinced about cooking the sage leaves whole since I'm sometimes a bit ambivalent about sage, but the fried sage was divine. I would have liked to gobble it all up myself, but it's way too rich.

This is quick and easy, but in my opinion needs a blast of heat. Next time I'll include sauteed hot sausage of some kind. I added lots of crushed garlic this time, but that wasn't enough for my palate. Not even a dash of red pepper flakes saved it. I think any good quality pasta will do if you don't have fresh (I used shells because that's what was on hand) but don't neglect the quality of the broth. When a recipe has this few ingredients they had all better be top quality.

Really nice and simple. However, I thought the amount of butter was way too much (and believe me, I have nothing against butter--it's one of my favorite food groups!). Obviously, with a recipe this simple, really good cheese is must.

I loved the pasta, but I loved eating the very buttery crisp sage leaves. They were like candy to me....amazing. Very simple. I was afraid I would burn the butter, but everything turned out so well. I used the beef stock and will try other stocks next time....fantastic dish.

I skipped the broth and added a crushed garlic clove to the simmering sage. Then I crumbled the sage, and chopped the clove, and added the lot to the pasta. I served it with roasted chicken stuffed with herbed goat cheese.

Excellent!!! Everyone loved this and it's so easy! Used fresh grated parmesano reggiano and the combination of chicken and beef broth.

I love this dish. I made it without the broth (I didn't have any) and it was just wonderful. I just used the butter, sage and cheese. I will make it again with the broth next time.

Made this as per the recipe and thought it was boring as a side dish but last night made it as a main course with butternut squash and it was AWESOME!

This was a very easy and delic little meal. I would definetly recommend making as a side for a meat or fish. Sort of tasted like a better version of fettuccine alfredo.

This was a great side to beef with merlot sauce! I used more sage than the recipe called for, which I'll probably do again.

So simple to prepare! The sage infuses the butter, so that the flavor is so much more than one would expect! Serve with veal chops, steak, chicken - all will be exceptional with this as a side.

This was my first time making browned butter. It was so easy to make and the results were fantastic! A nice simple dinner on a weeknight. Definitely add the cubed butternut squash for added texture and taste.
