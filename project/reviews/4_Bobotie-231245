Love this recipe and being South African I love trying a variety of versions. I stick to the method of soaking the bread in the mild, squeezing out the milk (to use later) and then crumbling the soggy break in the mixture. Also, the rice: I tend to break two vegetable stock cubes into the rice while it boils. When you have thrown out the rice water, try stirring in saltanas, raisins, dried pineapple cubes and some flakes almonds. It adds a lovely touch. This recipe also works well in phyllo cups (leave out the rice) and eat with a salad of your choice.

It was delicious, very interesting mix of textures and tastes. But yes, the topping was just soaking through the meat. It didn't look perfect but it was tasty.

#1: Your need about 2 lbs of meat for this dish #2: It is delicious. I made w/ left over boneless lamb leg & family couldn't compliment me more. I think they liked this better than the roasted lamb. #3: The Yellow Rice is a must.

Like some of the other reviewers, this was the first time I ever tried to make a South African dish, and I have never had this dish before so I did not go into it with a very specific end result in mind. I chose to use ground lamb and followed the recipe as exactly as possible, but had to use dried bay leaves. It was fairly easy to make, filled the house with a really wonderful, fragrant aroma, and tasted very good served with the suggested yellow rice. It was a somewhat heavy meal, though, and I don't think it is the kind of thing I would want to serve often. I noticed that several other reviewers said the egg/milk topping just poured through the meat to the bottom of the pan, but this did not happen with mine. The milk and eggs set up on top, giving a soft, souffle-like top layer to the meat. I think the milk/egg mixture probably seeps to the bottom if you use ground beef (less dense than ground lamb) and perhaps if the casserole dish is too large (I used a 10-inch wide oblong dish).

This was the first time I ever tried to make a South African dish, and I was really happy with the outcome. In this case I used Lamb, not beef. I love how it asks for raisins and nuts. The different textures really blend well together too and it's also a fairly easy recipe. Pretty perfect for any Winter supper.

Oh, my heavens. This was amazing. Wouldnt change a thing. I only had 1.60 lbs ground beef and it was enough. Like other reviewers I was equally mystified by the recipe writer's omission of a quantity or weight for meat, however when clicking on the shopping list generator tool it lists 2 lbs. as the quantity needed, so I'll go with that next time. (I hope that helps.) I did not have fresh leaves, so I used dried bay leaves. I tried soaking them in boiling water so I could roll them. Well, that didn't work and they were still stiff, so I buried them flat. Although another reviewer thought this spoiled the dish I can't agree since I thought the result was delicious.

This is a great recipe! I was really hesitant considering all of the disparate ingredients and complex steps, but to my surprise (I'm not especially good with the oven) it turned out fabulously! I used a pound of lean ground beef and a pound of ground lamb, and with the dried fruit mixed in it had this great slightly sweet/fruity flavor. And while I was hesitant about the custard, it turned out to be a great complement to the rest of the dish. Definitely would make this again: it's unusual enough that it will surprise people at the dinner table but tasty enough for heated up leftovers.

Baked at 350 for an hour+10 minutes instead of 325, and when I went to pour the topping over, it just dribbled through the cracks in the meat down to the bottom. However, the end product was still really tasty! Next time I might add 1 more egg and some more bread crumbs to help bind the meat better, or just cook it at the recommended temp and watch carefully to make sure it doesn't crack before the topping off. Served this at a World Cup party--everyone loved it and wanted to take home the leftovers!

Where's the meat ?? No mention of 'how much' minced beef or lamb ..odd,no? Sill setting up to make an entire South African meal and planning to use all of your recipes ....wish me luck .

Just curious to know how much meat should be used. Any recommendations? For some reason the recipe doesn't specify an amount.

Nothing is ever going to be quite like Ouma's, but that is probably because she experimented alot and discovered the secrets. Being a bit of a spice monster, I automatically tripled the spices and it turned out fabulously. Not a dish to make when you are in a hurry.

It was good the first time. The second time I didn't follow the directions and just pressed the bay leaves in without rolling them. It probably was the nastiest thing I have ever made. Roll the bay leaves!

ok, but not quite the "real thing," heh? Next time, I think I'll double the spices and dried fruits and grate the apple (the juice seeped out and added good flavor, but left the apples squishy, tasteless chunks.)

I loved this dish and my boyfriend did too. i didn't know what to expect, but a few months later we went to an african restaurant in melbourne and ordered bobotie, and it tasted just the same, so i was pleased that i had attained some authenticity.

We did this as part of a South Africa theme dinner (we're all going on a safari/SA trip). Can't say we are looking forward to our culinary experience there. This dish was okay, not fabulous and so far from my usual likes of bright fresh flavors. Interesting for our theme dinner; not good enough to add to my repertoire.

I am very satisfied with the way it turned out. The taste is very authentic. I used lean ground beef instead of lamb and made the bobotie without the topping ahead of time. It took closer to 35 minutes for the topping to set properly.

While there are doubtless as many subtle variations of bobotie as any "national" dish (e.g., lasagne) this comes close enough to what I've had at the homes of South African friends to be welcome. My notes: I added more curry powder and would chop the apple and apricots in larger pieces the next time so they don't cook down so much. I drained away the liquid fat in the casserole dish before adding the topping (using the potato masher worked brilliantly). I also had to bake the topping at a higher temperature and for a longer time than indicated. Served with yellow rice. It was delicious and enjoyed by all.
