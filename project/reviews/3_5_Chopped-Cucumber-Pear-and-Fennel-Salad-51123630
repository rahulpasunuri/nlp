I loved this salad for Thanksgiving dinner because it was not too sweet, it was beautiful and light. I gave it 3 forks because I did alter it to be more of a fruit salad: one English cucumber, 4 pears, one cup of pomegranite seeds and left the one large fennel bulb. I followed the vinaigrette recipe and several guests asked for the recipe. A big hit! I will definitely make for Christmas dinner.

Nice crisp salad. The dressing by itself is a little bland, but it is good when combined. I think the key to this recipe is to use really sweet pears, like red Anjou or really ripe Bosc.

I don't know why this is rated so low, I loved this salad! It is not a super strong flavored salad, but that's what I liked about it. The crunchy texture of the cucumber and fennel and the mild sweetness of the pear were great. I didn't soak my fennel/cucumber overnight and added extra pomegranate seeds.

I used my own vinaigrette since I printed the recipe without realizing it didn't include the recipe for the vinaigrette. The salad was very good.

I made the vinaigrette first and it was so bland that I didn't bother to make the salad.

what a great idea to add the blue chz...I made this to the letter but my fennel bulb had no fronds...my markets choice...HUmmmm...the salad seemed very flat, I served it w/ ribs, thought the fresh taste would be great w/the ribs for a fallish dinner. I was disappointed. I love BA...I'd say maybe this will be much better w/ fronds, and the blue chz too, but I think I'll move on.

A great fall salad. I did cheat a little and added a little crumbled blue cheese...but what is better than a little Maytag.
