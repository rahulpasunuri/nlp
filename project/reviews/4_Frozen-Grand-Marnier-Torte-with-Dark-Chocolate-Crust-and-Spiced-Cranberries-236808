For most of my dessert eating life, I've made and ordered rich, chocolate sweets. Lately, I've been branching out, and I'm glad I tried this frozen Grand Marnier torte for Christmas, which I found in the Holiday Dessert slideshow on Bon Appetit's website. As soon as I saw this colorful and unique dish, I knew it was the one! It does have a chocolate cookie crust, the flavor of which comes through with a crunchy finish, but there are a lot of tastes and textures in each bite. Its absolutely delicious! Heres the link. Another plus is that most of the ingredients in this recipe are fairly inexpensive, as opposed to, say, all the cheese in cheesecake. You will have to invest in some Port and orange liquor, but there'll be plenty left. I didnt use Grand Marnier b/c it costs more than similar liquors and we have a local product, Paulas Texas Orange. Also, instead of a true Port, which comes from Portugal, I went with a local wine, Torre di Pietras Tango Port. We drank the extra, which was the perfect compliment to the dessert, especially since it was too late for coffee. I agree with others that the cranberry overpowered the filling, although I wish I had read these reviews before I made it. :) Next time I will try substituting other fruit. I was thinking of apples or oranges as well as raspberries. Bon Appetit says the recipe is easy, and I would mostly agree. I had one difficulty, I wasnt sure how stiffly to beat the whipping cream and sour cream, and there wasnt much guidance. But I just went with my gut and it turned out great! This dessert was fun to make, festive and was a hit with my friends. We did not have a cranberry dish with the Christmas dinner and I was glad to be able to incorporate the traditional fruit into dessert. I would certainly make this again!

Year after year this never fails to impress the many friends and family that I entertain over the holidays. It is time consuming but not hard, and I make it ahead of time. I don't usually add the white chocolate curls. The taste is delicious and not too sweet. The presentation is jaw dropping.

The perfect holiday dessert--elegant, delicious, and can be made ahead. Makes for a beautiful presentation. I skipped the white chocolate curls and think it would have been too much.

I have been making this for years. For me, it is a lot of work, but well worth it. This dessert is not sweet at all, but we love the cranberries and the port. Every time I offer to bring something to a special dinner, someone asks me to make this.

I have been making this dessert every Christmas for the past three years and it is always the star of the show! Time consuming, but well worth it. Careful cooking those eggs; don't let them scramble.

I asked the question on 11/22/09 and the answer is yes, very easy to cut ahead of time, store in freezer and then place each slice on a separate plate and put the topping on. However, I wasn't happy with this recipe. The torte filling pretty much tasted like eggnog ice cream and the topping, as written, was not good. I will not be making this again.

I served this dessert last night at our Gourmet Group Holiday Dinner. It was very easy to make. Based on other reviews I substituted part of the fruit in the topping with raspberries instead of cranberries, I used 2 cups of cranberries, cooked them down, then added 3 cups fresh raspberries. The topping tasted great by itself. The torte tasted great by itself, but when combining the two, the sauce completely overpowered the torte and it was pretty bad. As I think back on it, I can't really imagine mixing the flavors of the grand marnier with the port in the sauce, the port took over everything. This was a huge disappointment and a recipe that will not survive in my cookbook

I am planning on making this and will need to slice and serve in the kitchen so no need to wow guests with the whole torte. Would it be better to slice the unadorned torte and then place the cranberry topping on each individual slice, rather than piling the cranberries on to the whole torte and then slicing?

I made this last Christmas(08) and it looked so beautiful! However, the cranberries totally overpowered the taste of the torte and I didn't even use the amount called for. If I were to ever make this again, maybe rasberries or cherries would be better.

It's good and something different. Found the cookies with ice cream toppings, not in the regular cookie section. Before I found those, I used the 100 calorie Oreo thin crisps.

Made this for Christmas dinner and the presentation was beautiful! However, must agree with others because the cranberry sauce(I didn't even use all the cranberries) overpowered the desert so much that all you could taste was cranberries. Don't think I'll make it again as it was labor intensive. Might be better to serve the cranberries on the side , but won't look as pretty. Maybe cherries would be better...???

Have made this several times and have never had any leftovers! For our last party, I did not have Grand Marnier, so I substituted Orange Curacao...it has enough orange flavor to balance with the cranberries and chocolate. I did try it with Triple Sec once, and do NOT recommend it...not enough flavor. Otherwise, this is one of the best dessert recipes I've ever found!

I liked it since the first time I saw the picture!! I've done it twice, and working on it today again... simply breathtaking. Here in my country it is not possible to find fresh or frozen cranberries, so I use other berries like raspberries, strawberries and black berries. LOVE IT!!! MMMM!!!!

This was very impressive and delicious. I made the dessert in the summer and substituted bing cherries for the cranberries. The sauce did not congele like the cranberries but I used the etra sauce beneath each slice to add to the presentation.

I have to say that this is the first dessert I have made for Christmas that the whole family liked! It was a bit time-consuming but well worth it. I used chocolate graham crackers to make the crust and used a vegetable peeler as well to make the white chocolate curls.

Rating: 4
Holy cow this was delicious! As beautiful as the photo, too. Be careful not to press the crust in too firmly, or it won't slice. I added some extra Grand Marnier (of course!) but didn't stray otherwise. The berries are so good, I'll make them again on their own. As testament to how exquisite this cake is: This year, the men stayed at the table after Thanksgiving dinner in anticipation of having a slice instead of filing into the living room for football. Dad has already asked me when I will be making it again. Soon, I hope!

Although not easy, this was an amazing elegant and beautiful holiday dessert. I was not able to find chocolate wafer cookies. I suppose next time I might try oreos. Another tip, buy extra Cranberries during Thanksgiving and freeze. I had a very difficult time finding fresh Cranberries. I got lucky at Whole Foods. I used a vegetable peeler for the white chocolate curls.

Rating: 4
Huge raves on taste from my guests, and very impressive when brought to the table. Left about a cup of the delicious mulled cranberries off, but will use that sometime this week as a dessert topping. Couldn't figure out how to get the chocolate curls to work, so drizzled melted white chocolate on top just before serving.

Rating: 3
Lovely presentation, pretty easy to make, and a delicious combination of sweet and tart. If you like chocolate and orange you can't go wrong with this. The only modification I made was to only make 1/2 of the cranberry topping, and I spooned a pile into the center only b/c I didn't know how it would re-freeze. Oh, and I couldn't duplicate the luxe white chocolate curls from the photo. Anyway, tasty!

Rating: 4
This is superb! I took it to a Christmas party and the hostess called me a bitch then proceeded to take a picture of the torte. The flavor combinations are perfect - orange, chocolate, tart spicy berries that pop in your mouth. I put approximately 2/3 of the cranberry sauce on the torte and used the remainder to garnish the plates. It's gorgeous and unfortunately it cannot be kept on display. Serve it and put the remaining torte back in the freezer. Thanks to the genius that created this recipe!

I've made this twice in 10 days for different gatherings, it is not only delicious but also beautiful and so festive for the holidays. The wonderful spiced, slightly tart cranberry topping offsets the sweetness of the torte. So easy to make, it came out perfectly and did not melt and cuts easily. I made it exactly as the recipe and used all 5 cups of cranberries. Will certainly make again.

I AM making this recipe again for this Christmas because it was such a hit last year. It was easy the first time around and the effect was quite stunning. It even traveled well through 2 states (I kept the cranberries separate for the trip.) We liked the tartness, but I could see how a little more sugar would please more of the crowd. Regardless, this dessert rocks.

Rating: 4
wonderful, easy, and best of all can be done ahead. Made this for our annual gourmet group Christmas gathering and everyone loved it after an evening of appetizers. We even have a pastry chef in our group. Only change I made was to use only l cup fresh cranberries. Decided I didn't need to open another bag. I used a 12 oz bag of Ocean Spray fresh cranberries. Will make again for sure.

The colors of this dessert are beautiful, as described. However, the taste was not. The cranberries were way too tart in contrast to the mild base. Maybe some additional sugar or fewer berries or chopping the berries would have helped? It was also quite runny, so it made a mess when the sides of the springform pan were removed. My candy thermometer did not register as low as 175 degrees, so I overcooked the egg mixture and it did not fully incorporate into the other ingredients. A description of the desired consistency in the recipe would have helped to avoid that problem. It did not impact the flavor or texture much, just made little yellow spots in the white base. The base was good, but not sweet or heavy enough to counteract the extreme tartness of the cranberries. The crust was tasty, but very hard when frozen, making cutting the thing difficult. I could not get my white chocolate to curl, so must have bought the wrong kind. (I was very careful to catch it at just the right coolness. I didn't know there were different kinds of white chocolate.) Next time, I'll make cheesecake if I want cranberries on top. That could counteract the tart flavor better. This dessert would be much better with blueberries or cherries on top, although not as festive looking.

The cranberries were way too tart in contrast to the frozen base. More sugar might have helped a little, but the berries were like a sour explosion with each bite - not good. I had trouble with the frozen base because my candy thermometer did not register as low as 175, so I ended up overcooking it. The result was small bits of coagulated egg that did not incorporate into the rest of the ingredients. It really did not impact the flavor or texture much, but a description of the desired consistency in the recipe would have been helpful. The base was very good, but just not able to temper the cranberries enough. The crust was extremely hard when frozen, but tasty. Next time, I'll make cheese cake instead. That would probably work with the cranberries better.

Good tasting dessert but I needed to double the wafters for my 9 inch cheesecake pan and it was a mess! slopping over the edges and melted very fast, so fast that I could not cut through the crust since that was still frozen and the filling was liquid. I did have it in the freezer over night.

To MQuintana from Miami, FL: Some ideas...next time, make certain that your egg yolk-sugar mixture has reached 175 for safety and thickening purposes. Beat the yolks slowly for even more than 5 min. if necessary until the mixture becomes very thick and cool. This will help a lot. Start the next step by whipping the cream alone until soft peaks begin to form, then fold in the sour cream, yolk mixture, etc. It sounds like the cream mixture was overbeaten in an attempt to get it to set up.

This was really very good. The combination of chocolate, cranberries, and orange is always tasty, but this is a particularly nice version. The crust is aided by the added chocolate chips (I used organic Oreos with better flavor than regular storebought). I also tripled Grand Marnier in the filling to give a pronounced orange flavor. Very nice, even when melted...

This dish was the hit of my Christmas Eve cocktail party. It made for such an amazing presentation that guests wanted to take pictures of it! I wasn't that crazy about the amount of cranberries and would probably half that next time but the contrast in flavor it brought to the torte was wonderful. It truely is an elegant dish that will amaze your guests. I even had one young lady say it was the best desert she has ever had!

This really wasn't difficult to make...and made a great presentation. I had difficulty finding fresh or frozen cranberries and ended up using dried cranberries and reconstituted them...and added some frozen cherries to obtain the "look". In the future, I would make with most any kind of berry and just reserve some fresh to mix in at the end.

This is absolutely scrumptious! I made this for our annual Christmas smorgasbord and everyone raved. Not only that, it was easy to make and absolutey gorgeous.

Simply great! Couldn't find fresh cranberries so I substituted 3 cups of dried and 2 cups of fresh raspberries, reducing the sugar by ¼ cup and adding the juice of ½ a lemon to the sauce. It was beautiful and delicious. It will become one of my staple desserts.

AMAZING! I hate baking so this seemed to be the perfect Christmas dessert. The cranberries, orange-y filling and chocolate crust complimented each other perfectly. The orange flavor of the filling seemed a bit too intense as I was making it, but after freezing it, it was perfect. Met with rave reviews by my family, both older and younger generations. I just wish it didn't lose its look once it started melting. Still, I impressed everyone with a beautiful and tasty dessert! (FYI, to keep the cranberries nice if you re-freeze, shrinkwrap it with one of those foodsaver things if you have one; it keeps it together and protects the berries!)

Made as written. I had my doubts about using the uncooked cranberries, but they actually complement the sweetness of the torte. It looked like the picture for once, and folks thought it was picture worthy. It makes a lot and the fact that it melts makes it hard to take to a buffet gathering. I wonder about using the key lime white chocolate mouse cake on this site as a basis and making it using that recipe so it would not have to be frozen. I even made the white chocolate curls once I got the chocolate to the right temperature. Folks thought it was hard to make. Another compliment. It is worth making when you want to impress.

Made this for Christmas and although time consuming it is worth the effort!! Fabulous presentaion and great flavor. I overlooked saving out 1/2 cup of the chocolate crumbs to put in between filling layers - didn't miss it. The presentation was great even without the chocolate curls.

This dessert was out of this world! It was sooooo easy and absolutley stunning. Plus, the whole thing can be stored in the freezer for days. I made the chocolate leaves (from the eggnog tiramasu trifle recipe) instead of chocolate curls and this truly WOWed the audience. The custard is so light and accents the deep flavor of the cranberries and dark chocolate crust perfectly! Please try this dessert, you will not be disappointed.

I made this for a dinner party this past weekend and I was very pleased with the flavors, particularly the cranberry topping. I wasn't crazy about the chocolate crust though--very hard because of being frozen. I wonder if graham cracker crust wouldn't be better. I would also cook all the cranberries, rather than reserve two cups at the last minute. I used frozen cranberries to make topping.

This dish was an absolute hit. I would make it again exactly as written. If you don't care for the tartness of the uncooked cranberries, cook all of the rather than holding two cups out till the end. Perhaps I would try this next time. I didn't bother w/ the white chocolate.

Beautiful presentation and wonderful flavor contrasts. I rate this above even my most treasured party dessert recipes. If it was a refrigerated dessert instead of frozen, it would be unbeatable, especially for leftovers, as the cranberry topping loses its sparkle in the freezer. Anyone know how this filling could be converted to set up in the 'fridge instead of freezer? Gelatin?

This was a big hit at a dinner party recently. I found it relatively easy to make -- I made it in approx. one hour the night before and put it in the freezer, which is great if you are pressed for refrigerator space! The only change I made was to add 2 star anise to the port and cranberries, which I removed just before serving. I definitely did not think the liqueur flavor of the Grand Marnier was too much; in fact, we really enjoyed the contrasts between the flavors of the crust, the torte itself and the cranberry topping. Very impressive presentation, especially at the holidays!

I made the torte this past weekend and everyone just raved about it. I took the suggestion of another reader and made more cookie crust to add to the middle. You DEFINETLY need to keep this in the freezer until ready to serve, it melts very quickly. Just take it out, add the cranberry topping, slice and serve. YUMMY! You can stick it back in the freezer if you don't eat it all at one sitting. The topping freezes well and it's delicious the next day even though it's frozen. Enjoy.

Dramatic presentation--very elegant! Quite good tasting, but a little rich and "sophisticated" due to the presence of the liquors. Some of my guests loved it, but several were a little overwhelmed by the cranberries. It was not a universal hit.

This is possibly the best dessert I have ever made... in my entire life. And trust me when I tell you that I have made many, many desserts. It is the perfect combination of flavors and textures. Everyone was crazy about it. I made the recipe exactly as written including the white chocolate curls as garnish (visually they are a definite plus). I would make this over and over. It's time consuming but worth every minute. I took it out of the freezer about five minutes before the serving and cutting was not a problem.

This dessert was the hit at my thanksgiving dinner! It was absolutely gorgeous and relatively easy to make. We followed the directions exactly but next time would probably change things just slightly. Add more chocolate wafers to the recipe and put them in the middle because its a nice balance with the cranberries and add a little less orange juice concentrate because it was a little over powering the next day. I also agree with the other comments that it needs to be served frozen as soon as possible because it melts quickly and can make a mess.

I made this last night for a little Christmas get together, and it was really tasty. I wasn't sure what to expect (I mostly made it because the picture was so beautiful!), but it had a little bit of everything-- chocolate crust, creamy citrusy filling (it reminded me of frozen lemon curd) and a cranberry topping that just tasted like Christmas. Everyone loved it! I used Triple Sec instead of Grand Marnier (much cheaper!) and Sherry instead of port because I had it-- it turned out great!
