I halved this recipe simply because that's how much chocolate I had on hand and it worked quite well. A lot of rich chocolate flavor but not too sweet.

This is sooooooo good! Just the right amount of chunky stuff, great chocolate flavor. I only gave it 3 forks because when it freezes overnight, it is so hard you have to use a jackhammer to get it out of the bowl. Maybe it needs a little touch of liquer. I think an interesting variant of this would be to add coffee. I bet it'd be great.

A very good ice cream but not as rich as I thought it would be. Loaded with pecans and chips, though.

My friend asks for us to make this every year for her birthday!

This is a *very* rich, very chocolately ice cream. My coworkers devoured it in no time!
