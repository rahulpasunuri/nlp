I made 2 versions - one with low fat mayo & the other with yogurt. I did not like the yogurt, so I mixed both together. The herbs were a bit too strong - if I made these again I would reduce the amount by half. Overall, a good recipe with adaptations.

This was fantastic. My hens are giving me a lot of eggs right now and I was able to get the radishes and herbs straight from our garden. Wow! What a great combination. The crunch from the radishes and the taste of thyme was fantastic. My husband said we needed to make these again and again until the radishes are done!

My family loved these eggs at our Dad's day luncheon. I even took half of the filling and made the basic deviled egg for the cautious eaters - everyone wanted these.....I thought they were great...I would, and plan to make them again.

These Deviled Eggs were good, but not as good as I expected. I liked them, but they were not a standout and I probably won't make them again in the interest of finding something better

Considering the reviews I expected to really love this and was quite disappointed - as were my husband and parents. I mixed the eggs with yogurt and mayo (as one reviewer recommended, and the next day added the herbs. The egg mixture without the herbs was quite yummy and I am not a fan of plain yogurt. As written, there were far too many herbs for my taste. Perhaps if one fourth of the quantity called for were used it might appeal more. I would maked deviled eggs again with the yogurt, mayo and mustard.

I can't fairly rate this recipe since I forgot to buy the herbs while I was at the store. I ended up using by boyfriend's undated dried herbs (bad sign...) but heck, they still turned out pretty good. The radishes made a tasty/crunchy addition and I used a blend of full-fat and lowfat mayo. Pretty dang good. --t

I would actually give this a 3.5 fork rating because I haven't had a lot of experience with deviled eggs, but this recipe is the best so far. Since they are lighter and tastier than traditional deviled eggs, make plenty of extra -- they will not hang around for long.

This is by far the best deviled egg recipe that I have ever tasted in 40 years of cooking. I first served them at my daughter's baby shower; they were a major hit! I've since prepared them for Thanksgiving, Christmas, casual gatherings, etc.
