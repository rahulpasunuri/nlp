Good, but too much work. My favorite way to fix hachiya persimmons is to remove the calyx and small core, then puree in blender with 1/2 cup plain or vanilla yogurt. Sometimes I top it with bits of crystallized ginger. Easy and delicious!

I have a persimmon tree, and use this puree every winter to make cookies or cake; yummy delicious, but so limited. Does anyone have any other good recipes to use the puree? I'm wondering if I could use slices of firm hachiyas on a pate sucree tart crust, glazed with this puree and baked... would it turn out too astringent or would the baking mellow and sweeten the flavor of the unripe sliced fruit?
