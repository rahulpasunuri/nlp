Such an amazing cake!! A keeper! Like many reviewers suggested, I decreased the butter and increased the pistachios. Came out perfect :)

Would appreciate feedback on what I may have done wrong. As previously suggested, I used 1 stick of butter; divided the batter into 2-8 inch cake pans. Followed the instructions. The cake was unflavorful and dense. Help!

I love pistachios so I made this cake last night! This was a delicious and satisfying simple cake. The flavor was delicate, and buttery with a course crumb. I made another cake the Devil's food cakes this is a moist, airy, rich coffee chocolate layer cake. Im luckily discover this in: http://cake.gourmetrecipe.com/Popular_Cakes_Devils_Cake, better try this one now!

easy. fluffy batter. I used 1 stick of butter (I'm sure it's be fine with less), and almonds instead of pistachio - nearly a cup, measured after crushing. Only half the sugar worked FINE. (It's still sweeter than sweet cornbread) Do this so you can have a sliver for breakfast, and be like, "what? cake 4 breakfast is totally normal." I also subbed half the flour with white wheat flour. for me - I'd like more cardamom. for fancy, I'd make a whipped cream "frosting" or coulis (ginger jam??). This will be a go-to cake for me from now on.

Very tasty cake. Made the suggested revisions below- 1/2 c butter and 1 cup pistachios. Found the cake a bit sweet for my liking. Will definitely try this recipe again, with 1/2 the amount of sugar next time.

I made this cake for the second time, and absolutely loved it again. Used 1 stick of butter and 1 cup of pistachios, as recommended by other reviewers. Left a bit of texture to the pistachios instead of grinding them all to a fine powder. Great tips! This time, I divided the batter between two 9" round cake pans. They took exactly 20 minutes to bake. I frosted the cake with a half batch of the Whipped Creme Fraiche recipe from this site (minus the orange zest), and it was a perfect complement. This is one of my favorite cakes I've ever made because the flavor is so interesting, rich, and memorable. I will definitely make this again.

I made this cake for party where Indian food was going to be served. I followed all the other suggestions of decreasing the butter to 1 stick and increasing the pistachios to 1 cup. I didn't have ground cardamom handy so I used opened a handful of cardamom pods and ground them with the pistachios. This cake was a hit and several people at the party wanted the recipe. I guess there is an Indian sweet that has a similar smell and taste. The only thing I'm going to change next time is to use raw, shelled pistachios from and Indian grocery store so I don't have to remove the all the shells. This cake was simply delicious without frosting but a little powdered sugar dusted on top was also yummy. Definitely a keeper and go to recipe for the future.

amazing... so simple looking but complex in flavor. I made rosewater scented whipped cream to go along with this... just whipped 1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream with some confectioners sugar and about 1/4th of a teaspoon of rosewater. i also used fresh vanilla beans because i had them.

MMMMM!! I only had 3oz of pistachio so added 1oz of ground almonda, cut the butter down as all reviews have mentioned, It made a batter not a cake mix, and I needed to cook it for an extra 5 mins, but it's lovely, just lovely!!

Delicious. Simply frosted with cardamom whipped cream was great! I doubled the recipe and baked it in (2) 10" round pans. Leftovers were nice and moist for days. Next time I will increase the cardamom a bit...and get one of the people who now also love this cake to shell all those nuts!

A nice moist, very flavorful cake. I made with one stick of butter per the suggestions made, and it was plenty rich. Would pair well with a fruit compote or sorbet. I would describe the cake as very pleasant, but not exceptionally memorable.

This is my number one, go-to cake! Made modifications per past reviews, and substitutions due to dietary restrictions. I have made it several times - first time as one-layer pistachio cake with coconut frosting, twice as a layer cake using almonds instead of pistachios (once with vanilla frosting and once with chocolate. I preferred vanilla, and I am a chocolate person). A few times I have made it just to have (breakfast, after dinner, etc) with no frosting or topping. I have made it in 9-inch round pans, 8-inch round pans, and a small loaf pan. I have also made it mixing pistachios and almonds, which I prefer. You really can't go wrong with this cake! First, I did use 1 cup of nuts and left some of them more coarsely chopped, reduced butter/oil to 1 stick or 1 half cup. I also added 1/4 tsp almond extract. I reduced the salt to 1 1/8 tsp. I played around with different amounts of cardamom, and my family and I found 1 tsp to be the perfect amount. I substituted Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free all-purpose flour for the flour, and Ener-G egg replacer for the eggs. The first few times, I substituted Earth Balance buttery spread for the butter, Edenblend rice/soy milk for the milk, and used turbinado for the sugar. Next, I made it changing only the sugar - used sucanat instead of turbinado, which resulted in a fluffier cake. The final time, I substituted extra virgin coconut oil for the butter, hemp milk for the milk, and used coconut palm sugar for the sugar. This was definitely the healthiest version, but also very rich (also the thinnest). They are all excellent, though I think the first version I made is probably best if you want to make a layer cake - nice crumb. This cake needed to bake much longer in my oven.

I made this cake for the first time this afternoon for a party, and I was a little nervous because I like to test recipes before I make them for a crowd. Despite my nervousness, I got positive feedback from all who ate it. I personally found the cake to be good, but very dense. Per other reviews, I lessened the butter to one stick, and I also used 2% milk instead of whole, and 1 cup of pistachios unstead of 3/4 cup. Overall, this was a good cake and I will make it again.

I loved this cake because it was so different from the norm...I followed the recipe exactly as listed and was happy with the result but next time I would definitely try reducing the butter to 1 cup as suggested by other reviewers because it was a tad greasy...still yummy though!

This recipe is so easy and so delicious. I cooked in a pyrex baker for 28 mins and it came out very moist and fluffy. Regarding the amount of cardamom, I wanted more, my husband wanted less! So that is just preference. I also followed the other reviewers' suggestion of 1 stick only of butter, and it still came out very rich (might even reduce slightly more next time). Additionally, I substituted organic sucanat for the sugar, which gave it a wonderful caramelly flavor. I will definitely make this one again.

I've baked a few cakes in my 55 years. This is the cake I've been trying to get at. Love it.

Rating: 3
I modified the recipe by using a total of 1/2 cup of vegan shortening instead of the butter. I also used white whole wheat flour instead of plain white. It came out very moist and tasty. It didn't rise too much but it is perfect with coffee or tea. I plan to serve it with a side of mastiha ice cream that I made earlier this week. Cannot wait to try it.. I give it three forks since I didn't follow the recipe to the point.

I too modified as suggested and reduced the butter to one stick. I agree: this cake is fantastic! I called it a "flavor explosion" - there was so much going on, and it was so delicious, it was quite exciting to bake such a unique cake. I baked it for someone else, but was able to eat some trimmings; now I want to bake the whole thing for myself. I added 1 (not 2) TBSP of orange zest as per the Epicurious/2007 version of this recipe, and that amount in the cake was perfect; I think the added complexity really made the cake "shine". I baked one batch in two 6" rounds so I could stack and fill. Took approx 37min.

I made this for my dad's birthday even though he claims not to like cake, and he loved it! It has a rich and unusual flavor. I made some changes based on previous reviews, which technically would make it a three star recipe. But with the changes, which I highly recommend, it's definitely four stars. Only needs one stick of butter, 1/2 tsp. extra cardamom, maybe more if it's not fresh, leave some pistachios not totally ground. Baked it in a 10" springform for 27 minutes. Would be great doubled to make two layers, with a filling between. Came out kind of thin, but delicious nonetheless. Served with lightly sweetened whipped cream and fresh strawberries. Many thanks to previous reviewers. This is a keeper!

This was an interesting version of pistachio cake...I increased the cardamom slightly and added just a touch of almond extract for more complexity. In addition, I omitted the butter, and yet it came out perfectly. Nice, light, and very interesting. Also, I ground the pistachios, but left some small pieces in as well, so that the cake had a nice crunch to it. All in all, a very pleasant, light, not too sweet dessert cake.

Very nice cake. Very moist, too. The flavors are reminiscent of Indian or Middle Eastern desserts. Followed all of the recommendations listed below by AClevelandCook (6/4/06), and it turned out wonderfully.

Huge hit, but I only gave the recipe 3 forks since I made a number of changed, based on other's comments. I used only 1 stick of butter, I increased the pistachios to one cup, and I increased the cardamom by maybe 1/4 tsp. Baked it in a cake pan, exactly 20 minutes, and served with whipped cream and strawberries macerated in honey (thanks, CA!). I also did not grind the nuts to a powder, but almost, so there was a little crunch in the cake. It was excellent, and got rave reviews: thanks to all who commented, it made the recipe and makes this site! I served it after a Middle Eastern meal, and it was perfect. Would also be good with a simple frosting, but it is quite moist.

AWESOME. The lovely green color and slight crunch from the pistachios, combined with the exotic cardamom, is wonderful. I will add some whipped cream (probably mixed with creme fraiche) and some sliced strawberries next time to complete it.

It was deeeeeeeeeeeeelish! We made it 4 times in 2 weeks!

When tasting the batter, I thought this needed more cardamom, so I added probably another teaspoon more. This was probably a bit much, but I do think it needs more than the original 1 tsp to achieve the proper flavour. That said, it's a delicious cake. Pistachios and cardamom are a classic combination, and this cake delivers! Perfect with a cup of hot tea.

I agree with other reviewers that this cake was a bit too buttery. But it is delicious, and it really tastes exotic with the pistachio/cardamom combination. And, it is easy and makes a lot of servings, so it would make a good dinner party cake.

A delicious and unique cake--the amount of butter needs to be reduced by about a third, and I would add less cardamom next time, as the flavor threatened to overwhelm the delicate flavor of the pistachios. Served it with whipped creme fraiche and fresh strawberries, sliced and macerated in honey.

I made this for my husband's birthday party because he likes cardamom and pistachios. It was incredible! I frosted it with home-made vanilla frosting and candied pistachios. I am still getting compliments 6 months later.

I agree this cake was too buttery. I used a smaller bundt pan so it look voluminous. I made a mistake of adding pine nuts because I didn't have enough pistachios. It is essential to have fresh nuts and cut down on the butter and must use cardamon for flavoring.

This cake was a huge hit. The hardest part was shelling the nuts and finding the cardamon. Otherwise it's sooo easy. I frosted it with a cream fraiche (heavy cream, buttermilk, vanilla & sugar).

e x c e l l e n t r e c i p e ! ! used a 7x10 glass baking dish with wax paper. a little extra butter, a little extra cardamom, 2% milk, 1 cup unsalted pistachios and a dash of sea salt. baked for 35-40 minutes and it came out absolutely perfect. imagine a double layer cake with creme fraiche between the layers and a little on top with fresh strawberries. mmm...

Rating: 3
I followed the other reviewers' advice and used a smaller pan - a 9-inch round springform. I just used parchment paper instead of wax paper. I had to increase the baking time to 30 minutes. I found my cake extremely buttery -- not that I don't love the flavor of butter, but it seemed to dominate. I would probably increase the pistachios to at least one cup next time, and I might augment cardamom by half a teaspoon. This is delicious, but not phenomenal. I had some pistachios I wanted to use up -- maybe next time I'll try the sour cream pistachio cake, also on this site.

We love cardamom and we love pistachios so I made this cake last night and although it was good, it wasn't wonderful. Could it be that my cardamom was too old? I may try it again with fresher spice or add another 1/2 tsp. of cardamom. I wonder if toasting the pistachios would give a stronger flavor.

Rating: 3
This was delicious. I am not sure why, as I followed the recipe exactly, but I did not seem to have enough batter for the size of the pan recommended. I will try this recipe again with a little smaller pan. The taste of the cake itself was great and very moist.

What a surprise! This was a delicious and satisfying simple cake. The flavor was delicate, and buttery with a course crumb. I used a slightly smaller glass pan and adjusted the bakeing time. The cake came out great and was a big hit. I served it with fresh berries and sourcream, but whipped cream or icecream would also be nice.
