This jelly is tasty and not too complicated to make. I ended up using a 1/2 cup of port and found that its flavour definitely comes through. I didn't use the pits when making the jelly as I had forgotten to purchase some cheesecloth. I don't think the recipe sufferred for it.

I used this recipe last summer and plan to use it again this summer. It was the first time I had ever 'canned' anything. It was easy to follow, pretty easy to make. I used RIPE italian plumbs harvested from the tree in my front yard. I added pears to the mix and extra port. It turned out great. I gave the jelly as christmas gifts last year and not only did it get rave reviews from friends and family, I was even asked for the recipe.
