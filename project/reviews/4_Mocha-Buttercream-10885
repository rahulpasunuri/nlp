Do not make any other mocha buttercream. This is it!!! Out of this world on consistency and taste. I made it to go on chocolate cupcakes and it definitely made the cake. I used a bit more chocolate and less of the espresso powder mixture (actually used decaf coffee powder). I think the full amount would have made it too strong on the coffee flavor, but it's so easy to adjust to personal taste.

This was delicious and well worth the extra effort to make. My only complaint is that it was not what I would term "mocha". It is very heavy on the coffee component and light on the chocolate part. If you want a coffee flavor, use as is. The next time I make it, I'll use less espresso and more chocolate.
