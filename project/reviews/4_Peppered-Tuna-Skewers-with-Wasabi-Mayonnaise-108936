This recipe is so easy but looks impressive. I simplified it even more by using Trader Joe's wasabi mayo - no need to prep the dipping sauce! Use the best tuna you can find from your fishmonger and keep it on the rare side when cooking. Don't overdo it on the soy sauce, while my guests loved it, I thought it was a tad salty.

This was really excellent and super easy! I think the quality of the tuna is key. Got some great sushi grade tuna at our local farmer's market (although I don't think you need sushi grade since the tuna is seared). Had 2 1-lb tuna pcs which I cut into quarters and seared for about a minute total; then cut into chunks. Put chunks on arugla with mayo in a bowl in the middle. Had toothpicks and pickled ginger on the side. Would not bother with the ginger next time. Brought it to a party and everybody loved it.

I've served this on skewers for a cocktail party per the recipe. I've also prepared the fish in grilled steaks over Asian inspired salad greens with a dash of sesame seeds, a ginger vinaigrette, and the wasabi mayo on the side. Any way you serve this, it will be a big hit!

Delish--easy & great for when you have guests. I too added a couple drops of soy sauce to the mayo -- be sure to dry your tuna well so it browns quickly. Great over a salad too

Made this for a holiday party and it was a huge hit. I loved he wasabi mayo-- it was surprisingly good. An easy item to make for a party or even bring. I didn't have pickled ginger but it came out just fine.

Fabulous for a cocktail party. All of them got eaten and several people asked for the recipe. A little time intensive to assemble, but then totally done before the party starts. We served them individually on long toothpicks.

Made this for a party this week and it was a big hit. Cooked the steaks whole then sliced and kept chilled til just before the party. Very easy to skewer and serve. The wasabi mayo was great with our roast beef sandwiches and also the smoked salmon I served. Everyone loved it.

Wow! This was so good and so easy to make! Had it as a dinner entree over rice with a side of green beans with ginger and cashews (from this site). Tweaked the wasabi mayo a little bit by using part greek yogurt. Also, made a soy dipping sauce (from this site). Perfect meal! Can't wait to make them as hors d'oeuvres for a party.

With this recipe, I experimented with salmon, since it doesn't have that much fish bone. I also heated some sliced ginger with the oil just so there is no fishy smell as well as give the fish a little bit sweet taste. If we are going to serve this to kids, we could have sour cream. because wasabi has a rather strong taste for kids. Overall, I love the original recipe and will serve it again in upcoming occasions :)

Excellent! Served it as an entree. Used 1/2 of wasabi, and although nice complement, it was still a little strong. Left over mayo-wasabi can be used for sandwiches.

This appetizer was a big hit at our dinner party last night. As my husband and I were cleaning up, we tried a few uncooked tuna pieces in the wasabi mayo. We decided that the uncooked tuna was even better than the seared. For our next dinner party, we will serve the tuna marinated and peppered but raw. It will be much easier. And, for those of us who love sashimi, it will be even more tasty.

Rating: 4
excellent and easy, for cocktail party or first course, or even dinner. Get the best pickled ginger you can find, and definitely make the wasabi mayo - it is just the right note. Try this even if, like me, you are not a huge fan of tuna.

I've made this a few times to rave reviews. I grill the tuna steak, then cut into slices and toothpick with the ginger, for an appetizer.

Wonderful. Instead of skewers, I served as an entree with tuna steaks. Seared tuna in VERY hot pan with peanut oil and dash of sesame (added right before adding tuna). Scant two minutes a side for medium rare. Husband claimed it was best tuna I had ever prepared.

I've made these a couple times, once for our "gourmet club", always a hit. They go great with skewered scallops w/orange sesame dipping sauce also from this site. They are wonderful together!

For New Years, I served this as an app for me and the hubs. I cut the tuna into cubes, skewered and marinated. Seared them and since they were already skewered, it made turning them a snap! LOVED the wasabi mayo - while it's not terribly inventive, it's delicious.

I have made this several times, and always use whole slices of tuna, then cut after searing. Once, I made this for wine-food pairing party, where we were passing appetizers. So, it all needed to be made ahead of time. I seared the tuna (rare) in the morning then wrapped tightly in plastic wrap. An hour or so ahead, I cut it into small squares, threaded with the ginger, then used baggie with a little corner cut off to put a little sqiggle of wasabi may on each peice. Then refridgerated again. It was very pretty and our guests loved it...even many who were convinced they would never like sushi! (Also, after making this several times, I think it is far far better as an appetizer chilled...but as an entree I would still serve it warm.)

This recipe was delicious and so easy to prepare! I seared the tuna in large pieces and cut it and skewered it afterward. Because of this it wasn't seared on every side of the cube and came out very rare, but it tasted wonderful and was a huge hit with the wasabi mayo. I will definitely be making this again!

Wow!! I barely got this onto the plate before my guests devoured it. I doubled the recipe and still it was gone in minutes. I seared the tuna whole and then sliced it thin. Seems it would be pretty difficult to manage to sear all 4 sides of the tiny cubes without overcooking. I also gave my guest the option of ginger - had the tuna slices on a plate w/wasabi mayo in center and ginger slices and skewers on the side.

Wow, this is going to become one of my go-to recipes for gatherings. I made these for a polo match tailgating--made the mayo the night before, bought pickled ginger from the sushi counter at Whole Foods and these were quick to make. (and used arugula instead of watercress) I will definitely be making these again!!

Absolutely delicious. Used sushi grade tuna and only seared the outside of each cube for 10-15 seconds using a cast-iron skillet. It had a nice crispy crust and was rare inside. Also used fat-free yogurt instead of mayonnaise, served with a side of soy sauce and wasabi mixture like sushi. Delicious!

I made this for New Year's Eve with a group of friends and family with a wide age range. Everyone loved it and it was so easy! Definitely take the advice of other reviews and cut the ahi AFTER cooking. It's much easier to handle that way. Sushi lovers will rave.

I came across this recipe only 1 month ago; but have made it 5 times already. Fabulous! Even guests who are somewhat reluctant when it comes to either tuna or wasabi loved it. I like to add a tablespoon or so of freshly grated gingeroot (not the pickled kind) to the wasabi mayonnaise. Also, if serving guests whom I know like spice, I add a few dashes of red pepper flakes to the tuna marinade. I agree with WEL-PAC - best pickled ginger out there - get it if you can!

If I could give this 5 forks, I would. It's very easy to make and truly fabulous. It got rave reviews from everyone. The wasabi mayo is essential. A note about the ginger ... I finally found a pickled ginger that is sushi-bar quality with great taste. It's from WEL·PAC. Excellent. In Minneapolis you can find it at Coastal Seafoods.

My wife calls this our go-to recipe. It is so simple, yet so delcious, that it is well ensconced in our regular rotation. In fact, we serve it on what we call Tuna Tuesday. It's also great for last-minute company. the vacuum-packed ahi tuna steaks we buy thaw real quickly in a bowl of water and the prep time is minimal. We don't bother with the skewers, and we love the pickled ginger and the watercress. But the recipe still is great even without those ingredients. Super Yum.

This is EASY, elegant, and tasty. Worked well for a party. Give the wasabi mayo time to sit for the flavors to blend...it tastes bitter right after you stir it together.

This recipe is delicious, and very popular with our friends! As others have suggested, I cook the tuna in steak form and cut after cooking. I also cook the tuna for less time than recommended (we love RARE tuna) on a very hot wok - about 30 seconds per side. I find that using sesame oil instead of olive oil adds a nice touch.

As everyone before me describes, its difficult to sear pieces quickly. I would also be sure pan is VERY hot. The mayo was a huge hit but I loved the recipe.

I made this for my father's friends... not the most open minded about new foods. They all loved it, and became more and more daring about the "rawness" level they would eat. I didn't even bother to put these on the skewers because they went so fast. I just cooked them as steaks, cut them into strips and served with toothpicks. Amazing!

We hosted an appetizer party last night and with 9 children finding the time to prepare any meal can be a real challenge. We were able to prepare the mayonnaise the day before and in about 45 minutes we had the dish ready for serving. The wide spectrum of flavors was so wonderful that everyone loved it! This recipe is a real winner!

The trick with these is to be able to cook them on high heat quickly, so they remain raw in the middle. Used skewers for a "bird's nest" style presentation -- and they disappeared faster than I could replenish them! Will definitely serve again.

This is a delicious recipe, simple! Nothing like tasting the great fresh flavors of fresh ahi tuna. I made this dish for a wedding reception for 75 people and one thing that I wish I would have done differently is NOT cube the tuna before I cooked it, rather sear it as a whole steak and then cube and skewer them. As a previous cook had mentioned it is quite difficult to sear and be consistant with 28 cubes of tuna as it would be with one! Otherwise a huge hit. Highly recommend them.

This was very tasty, and was devoured by boring relatives whose usual response to seafood is "eew, fish." Indeed, in anticipation of such a response, I made only half a batch, which turned out to be instructive: beware, the full recipe requires some really quick work to sear and turn 28 cubes six times each in less than two minutes. I found I could barely cook and turn half the recipe without overcooking the tuna; the whole thing would have been a disaster. Finally, not wanting to spend $18 per pound for fresh tuna that most of my relatives wouldn't know from pollock, I bought a small individually frozen tuna steak at a fraction of the price. It worked out fine.

This was a wonderful appetizer on Christmas Eve. My family are not very adventuous diners (to say the least!) and were very suspicious of this recipe (the tuna is still pink inside!!!), but they ended up loving it. I marinated the tuna in Very Very Teriyaki Sauce and then rolled it in sesame seeds before cooking. They were delicious and very easy. I couldn't get them out of my kitchen to the dining room before half the plate was eaten! My family is ready to try more of my Bon Appetit recipes!

I never thought to serve seared tuna this way, but it is delicious! Instead of just pepper, I used McCormick Montreal Steak Seasoning and sesame seeds. Guests just love it!
