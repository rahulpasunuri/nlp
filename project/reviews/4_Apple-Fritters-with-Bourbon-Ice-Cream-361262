This apple fritter recipe is amazing. I have made them several times and they are fantastic. I have not made the ice cream...sounds delicious though! I have served these with vanilla bean ice cream for dessert and for breakfast for my daughters slumber party! I have made no adjustments to the recipe and did use mostly safflower oil, some veg oil , saved the oil for a second use. YUMMM!

The apple filling was quite good by itself.

These were very tasty. They have that fried, state fair food taste that is so good. The base batter was too thick - there was no way the apples and egg whites were going to blend. I added a bit more milk until I could incorporate the apples and then tried my best not to mash the whites in too badly. For frying, the first ones were not cooked through but almost burning so I made sure not to make the next ones with too much batter or too thick, width-wise. The ones that succeeded were great.

This was everything we hoped it to be! The ice cream was scrumptious! Easy recipe :). The fritter base was a little stiff, I quickly put it together in my standing mixer with a paddle, it came together beautifully, tender interior, and scrumptious. This is a decadent treat, make it for someone you love

Sooo delicious!! I totally cheated on the bourbon ice cream front to make it less daunting; besides, I don't have an ice cream maker. I just bought vanilla ice cream, set it out to soften a bit, added about 3-4T Bourbon to about half the carton, stirred it in, and refroze it. This, of course, makes the ice cream just slightly alcoholic, whereas making the ice cream from scratch presumably boils off the alcohol. Anyway, the bourbon flavor was detectable but not overwhelming and the result of the fritters + ice cream was TOTAL DELICIOUSNESS!

We made both the fritters and the ice cream and wow, it was like a fabulous restaurant dessert. The ice cream was a very rich vanilla ice cream with just a hint of bourbon. We found that the fritter "base" to which we were to fold in the egg whites was very stiff, like cookie dough and therefore there really was nothing "gentle" about folding in the egg whites. Maybe we measured the dry ingredients incorrectly. I'm assuming this made for a heavier fritter but we didn't know the difference - we all thought they were fantastic. A bit of effort goes into this but it was worth it.
