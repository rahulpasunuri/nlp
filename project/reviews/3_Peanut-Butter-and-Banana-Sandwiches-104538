TO: A Cook from Toronto ON on 10/18/03: Your review made me laugh out loud when I read it, and several times since - especially while sharing it with friends. Thanks for the chuckle! I agree with the other reviewers about not mashing the bananas with the peanut butter, too.

this is an old favorite. i gave it a 2 because mashing up the bananas in the peanut butter is just wrong. as another reviewer said, spread the outsides of the bread with butter for easier frying. just slice the banana and lay it on top of the peanut butter, then drizzle with honey and fry. this also rocks if you spread one piece of bread with nutella, the other with peanut butter, and put the sliced bananas in the middle. at that point, though, you can't really justify having dessert.

I would suggest slapping the peanut butter on pepperidge farm 9 grain bread then lay the banana in long slices onto the peanut butter then top with other slice of bread. Take a bite and enjoy. This is the closest to heaven you can ever get!

I hope that the last cook was kidding about the dinner menu --- what a combination! :)

I served this dish to a dinner party of 8, along with a side of acorn squash stuffed with wild rice, hazelnuts, and dried cranberries, with an endive salad with apples and gorgonzola on the side. The wine for the evening was a Beaujolais. The combination of these dishes should be avoided, for while my guests appeared pleased with the salad and the squash, the peanut butter and banana sandwiches were not met with the same level of approval. Next time I will substitute the bananas for jam and see how that goes.

Okay, I like the grilling part. I sometimes do it to my PB&J's, too, but it IS very drippy and messy, you need to go light on the PB. Our family PB&B recipe is: spread PB on two pieces of hot-from-the-toaster toast, apply banana wheels to one piece, cover with the other. Eat. Rinse. Repeat.

In a word, overkill. Mashing the bananas with the peanut butter makes for a pablum-like consistency that melts right out of the sandwich as it's cooking. I'm a huge butter fan, but grilling this in butter just makes for a super greasy mess. I'm going back to slicing bananas onto peanut butter-spread bread and eating it 'raw.'

Great sandwich, kids loved it. Instead of melting the butter in the pan i just put some on the bread as you would for a grilled cheese. Turned out great. Used hints from others and put the bananas on top of the peanut butter, and mixed some honey in with the peanut butter. Will try the suggestion of just drizzeling the honey on next time. Will definately make this one for the kids again.

Great but doesn't need all that butter = especially if you have good quality peanut butter and thick, homestyle bread. I'm not saying this as a healthy food fanatic - just a PB purist. I don't like too many competing flavors with my PB.

OHMAGAWD! I am a diehard Epicurious cook, but wanted spruce up my children's pb & J's. Wow... my kids devoured these, as did my husband who came home from work early not feeling well. These little gems put a smile on his face too. These sandwiches are delicious. Comfort food at it's best. We have friends from Sweden who think peanut butter is the curse of the devil, they ate fish paste as children. They have no idea what they're missing out on!

this is an old time favorite BUT i would NEVER mush the bananas and peanut butter together -- i slice the bananas on top of the peanut butter as it is heating up. defintely needs to be grilled for the full effect.

Okay - call me crazy, but I've been eating peanut butter and banana sandwiches since I was a kid and I still love them! I put honey on mine, though, which makes a BIG difference. For those who scoffed at the recipe, drizzle a little honey over those banana slices and give it a try!

Pouah......if this receipe was the prefered of Elvis, we must admit that our taste has changed since the time of the king.

A total delight. Much better if you don't skimp on the butter. It's okay -- Elvis's birthday comes but once a year.

I'm sorry??? I find it difficult to believe that anyone is worried about the "extra fat" in this recipe. Perhaps a salad would be a better choice.

This is equally delicious cold, just as sandwiches. If you must have it hot, then put the sandwich into the sandwich toaster and you have a tasty snack without the extra fat.

What a gastronomic delight. I know that if I eat this for lunch every day I will soon wind up just like the King.
