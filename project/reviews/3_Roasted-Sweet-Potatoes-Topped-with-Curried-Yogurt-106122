I really enjoyed this, and it was simple and easy to make. I made it as a side dish for a friend's potluck dinner party, but would also happily eat it as a veggie dinner if dining by myself. Loved the sauce with the sweet potato (as did my friends). Would also be happy eating the sauce as a dip/spread on almost anything. I did add a little cumin to the sauce with the curry powder impulsively, but the sauce would be great with or without. I did use a tomato, but don't think it is necessary to do so.

I serve the veges hot with room temp. yogurt sauce. I love it! Can't make it often enough.

I agree that the sauce didn't do much to enchance the dish. In my very humble opinion, I've found that the tang of ketchup is wonderful with the sweet potatoes.

People, people! A recipe is nothing more than a road map - you can always choose to make little detours in the route. Just keep the destination the same. We sliced the sweet potatoes about 3/4" thick and layered them in a roasting pan spprinkled with a little bit of oilve oil and some kosher salt. For the topping we upped the curry to 11/2 Tbl.-half sweet curry powder, half hot, and added a large pinch of cumin. We served them at room temp and they were divine!

This recipe did nothing for me or my husband. We liked the sweet potato, but the taste of the yogurt concoction didn't compliment the taste of the sweet potato at all.

Nothing special, I agree the yogurt mixture would be good as a dip with fresh veggies.

Although I'm a big fan of the sweet potato, the yogurt topping just didn't do anything for me. The curry was nice, but the parsley and tomato were too much -- I just like the taste of the potato itself. My husband and I ate half a potato, and the leftovers sat untouched in the fridge until we had to just throw them away. It was a nice cooking variation for the potato though, other than just baking.

I love unusual dishes and I especially love curry so I just had to try this one! I really liked the sweet potato combined with the yogurt sauce, but I think next time I will add a bit more salt-it just seemed to be missing something. I used plain nonfat yogurt, and dried cilantro instead of fresh, and it turned out fine. Definitely let the yogurt mixture sit for at least a couple of hours before serving-I noticed a huge difference when trying it after 15 minutes, then trying it after an hour and a half! I used the leftovers the next day and put it over steamed asparagus! yum!

This is a delicious fusion dish of middle- eastern and southwestern influences. I made it for a dinner last night and it received overwhelming raves. Next time, I will make the sauce a day ahead, or earlier in the day, to let the flavors ripen. I used regular yogurt, not nonfat.

I made this recipe and liked it. For me, it's hard to go wrong with a sweet potato and I enjoy the taste of curry. I too wish that people would just rate the recipes and I also benefit from helpful suggestions i.e., cook longer, use this instead of that, etc. This is such a valuable resource for new tastes, I vote to keep it clean.

This recipe was so contentious I just had to try it! The curry powder complemented the potatos' sweetness. I would leave out the tomatos next time unless I had a really good garden-fresh tomato. A tasty and unusual brunch dish.

I followed the recipe and thought it was OK. We all thought it was good, but no one raved about it. I was trying to be healthy (nonfat yogurt and all), but as one diner said, "There's nothing like butter on a sweet potato." Next time I'd probably skip the curry concoction and go for a little butter instead!

This recipe is way overrated !

Yikes. The original comment that started the bickering has apparently disappeared...so i have to comment that the original response (to the comment) that welcomed suggestions but politely asked to not RATE the recipe if drastically changed is appreciated. TOO many reviewers skew the ratings doing this. Those of us who ask this are NOT saying "don't comment" we are simply asking to comment but not rate the recipe if you haven't made it mostly as written..

LOLOLOL. Really, Annapolis, YOU need to get a grip! Confusing "condemn" with "condone"???? So much for 'puters increasing literacy levels.... As for the recipe: 1. We adore sweet potatoes and are always looking for new ways to use them. 2. We adore Asian flavors. 3. I personally believe that a great many foods taste best at room temperature. P.S., nuking them works great, too -- I treat them like baking potatoes (pierce several times with fork, nuke time depends on size and # of potatoes, rotate 1/2-way through, wrap in towel for several minutes before eating -- these refrigerate and reheat well). Roasting, however, is vastly superior, when time permits.

Perhaps you should look up the word "condone."

We really like this recipe, although I would never have thought of using this topping with sweet potatoes. I think - as others have suggested - the topping would also be great with other veggies, like winter squash. I used yo-chee (yogurt cheese, which is yogurt, drained for several hours) which gave a thicker consistency to the topping. I think it would also make a terrific dip for chips or raw veggies! Yum!

Excellent compliment to roasted duck, and red wine which accentuates the slice spice of the yogurt topping.

Well, I haven't made this and am baffled by the comments. For those who made it, did they use the sweet potato with curried yogurt recipe as a starting base? It sounds like some of the reviews go with a different recipe which includes beets.

To "A cook from Annapolis Maryland": I agree with you!!

You all need to get a grip. The addition of ingredients to this recipe were suggestions, not an indication of displeasure of the original. Perhaps you all need to lighten up and expand your horizons rather than condone others.

I made this tonight with sweet potatoes, carrots, rutabagh, beets, butternut squash. Drizzled it with olive oil, salt and pepper, put in some fresh thyme, sage and oregano. Roasted it at 350 to 375 for 1 hour or so. It was wonderful.

Ladies, PLEASE! Retract the claws! We all come to this web site to read about interesting dishes, regardless of who thought it up. You can choose not to fix it an alternate way, but no need for name-calling & rudeness.

I agree most heartly, PLEASE so not rate recipes you do not follow. It is very arrogant of you and does a disservice to the chef of the recipe printed.

TO: A Cook from Melbourne, FL comments and suggestions are always welcome, but please don't RATE a recipe that you have changed so drastically that it no longer resembles the original. thanks
