Very tasty, a nice variation on our SF classic. Real green goddess came from the fancy hotel kitchens. The boy scout fare reference must refer to the bottled grocery store variety of the 60s-70s - hardly the same. Used greek yogurt, having no sour cream on hand and added a small amount of garlic. Also used vietnamese fish sauce instead of anchovy paste. Nice and thick enough to serve as a dip or could be thinned slightly for a dressing.

Delightful. Added 3 anchovies, juice of half a lemon and used Tarragon vinegar. So good.

Fantastic! The dressing is good on salad (mache or lamb's lettuce) as well. Substituted low-fat yogurt and a little creme fraiche for the sour cream. Added a lot more lemon (juice of whole small lemon) and 1-2 whole anchovies.

This recipe is wonderful! If you are searching for a bean recipe just go make this one! No really~go! It's simple, absolutely delish, and green beans are just RIGHT NOW. This is a perfect cold accompaniment whatever else summer you are having. :D I did add garlic and fresh tarragon and used apple cider vinegar. This one has become an immediate standard. PS: I don't know what 'boy scout' cuisine is either~but it must mean awesomeness.

Try steaming beans instead of boiling them: more vitamins. I forgot to dry the beans, with no ill effects. Use non-fat mayo and sour cream to cut fats. I subbed out red-wine vinegar with apple cider vinegar plus 1-1/2 tsp dried tarragon. I also added a crushed large clove of garlic and tripled the lemon juice to 1-1/2 tsp. I wanted to try some of this recipe after 24 hours, but my family of four ate the entire recipe in one night. Our 8-year-old went back for seconds...of GREEN BEANS!

This recipe benefits from a couple of unlisted hints: I added a clove of minced garlic, substituted 1-1/2 tbs of frozen pesto (because I ran out of anchovy paste), and tasted 100% better after 24 hours in the refrigerator. I served it cold with a grilled pork tenderloin and everyone loved it. It was so much better the second day.

Maybe I'm not a big enough foodie, but I wasn't insulted by the use of the term "Green Goddess" since this is a side dish, not a salad. I made the recipe as given (used frozen haricots verde) and used it as the carb accompaniment to London broil. It wasn't great, but my meat was marinated in lemon juice, olive oil, parsley and lots of garlic so that compensated. I'm saving the recipe...and next time will be sure to use tarragon vinegar and garlic to punch it up.

This dressing needs a healthy dose of garlic, fresh or dried tarragon and tarragon vinegar, not red wine vinegar. It's the tarragon that makes it so good. And Green Goddess dressing is not "Boy Scout" food - it's excellent when made the right way.

The dressing was fresh tasting but didn't really taste like a green goddess dressing. The idea may be worth another try but I'd find another green goddess dressing recipe with more spices from this sight.

I cannot try this recipe. Green Goddess dressing met it's demise in the 1970s, and for good reason. It's "boy scout" cuisine.
