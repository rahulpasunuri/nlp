A dependable hit. This isn't a fancy company dish, this is the sort of thing I'd serve my mom and let her think we always eat this well. :-) It's comfort food to me. I've made this for years. When I cannot get rabe, spinach does fine. Try it, it's very easy and tasty.

I used chicken thighs with bone in and skin (where all the flavor lives!), and added a 1/3 cup heavy cream to the marinade/sauce which helped to bring the rosemary and rabe together nicely. Served with roasted salt-n-pepper red potatoes to soak up the broth.

I thought this recipe was "very good". I didn't have broccoli rabe or collard greens, so I actually substituted broccoli florets. I served it with rice to soak up the broth. It was delicious. Yummy!

Good, not great. I used boneless skinless thighs and avoided many of the problems others encountered, and also used fresh picked baby collards but the dish still didn't come together as well as I thought it should. Rosemary and chicken go well, not sure about that herb and greens. Everything took longer to to than recipe states, leave extra time.

Yuck! The ingredients are great, but the dish was awful.

I tried this dish because I love broccoli rabe. It didn't disappoint. My husband especially loved it. I served it with couscous and I think it would also go well with rice - to sop up the delicious broth.

Loved it! Great "clean" taste. Out of Rosemary so used Oregano.

This was a great dinner party dish. My only note is that I cooked more than the recipe called for so the cooking time was longer - which dried my chicken out a bit. I also used swish chard because the store was out of rabe. I would make it again.

A good weekday meal. Naturally I cheated on the marination time. I served it with Near East chicken and garlic couscous for less stress.

I used rainbow chard for this dish, and it turned out great. The chicken was very tender and juicy, and it was great with boiled, buttered small potatoes. I used the ribs and stems of the chard instead of discarding them, as I like the crunch and tanginess it adds. As somebody else mentioned, it's a good weekday recipe.

I made this recipe, but I didn't boil the broccoli rabe, instead I sauteed it in olive oil with the garlic. It was very good!

This is a great weekday recipe. I used collard greens instead of broccoli rabe and it was great. I did saute the collard greens in a little butter/olive oil mixture and some sliced garlic. I cut the greens into thin ribbons (chifonnade). Saute for about 15 minutes and place it in the oven with the chicken -- it will come out perfect.

Well folks, you know me by now. There is a raging storm outside and I wasn't going to the grocery store. Time to substitute. So, I put rosemary and chicken breast into the search terms. This recipe was one of the twenty-seven that appeared. I did have some flash frozen broccoli so this one did appeal to me. I was out of chicken broth as well. So I used white wine and lemon zest. I used a Spanish seasoning, Sazon Goya, because I was out of crushed red pepper as well. Taste great! Tomorrow I will finally get to the grocery store. Peace.

This recipe is pretty good, but the cooking time is incorrect since the chicken was quite underdone. Since the broccoli rabe was already done, I microwaved the chicken 3 extra minutes before serving. Next time I will fry the chicken longer before assembling the dish and putting it in the oven.

It was quite easy, very delicious and would make it again, though i am going to use salmon filets tonight and use a grilling pan instead of a skillet. Will do as update...

My husband and I love this dish. I have always been able to find broccoli rabe but not this time. I'm making it with collard greens, I'm sure we won't be disappointed.

My husband said the chicken tasted "moldy". Perhaps he just doesn't like rosemary, but I thought it was mildly unpleasant, too.

I can give a definitive two thumbs up for the suggestion of adding a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes. Make sure you really reduce the sauce to intensify the flavor. I served it over brown basmati rice. Delicious.

Leftovers were wonderful served cold for lunch the next day!

Didn't have time to go out of the neighborhood for broccoli rape so used more easily found collard greens and added half of a coursely chopped vandalia onion since we love them. I served it over rice, but decided it would have been better over egg noodles. Even my non chicken loving husband remarked in favor. Callista's suggestion of a few red pepper flakes sounds good & I'll probably try that next time.

I thought it would be tastier considering the rosemary and the broccoli rabe -- maybe I'll add some red pepper flakes next time.
