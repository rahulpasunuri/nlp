It was rather boring. I added more rum and some cinnamon, but it still was kind of lack-luster. It might be better with a sauce (maybe caramel) instead of whipped rum cream.

A simple, yet elegant dessert. I'm not a big fan of raisins; however, I enjoyed them in this dish. I will definitely make this again!
