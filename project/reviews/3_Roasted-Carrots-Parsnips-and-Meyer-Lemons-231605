This was delicious. Remember to slice the veg the thickness required by the recipe. Those had a nicer consistency than the ones I cut thicker.

We made this tonight. The lemons with the root veg worked really nicely. We used beautiful huge cloves of garlic that just added to all the flavors. It was delicious.

Loved this combination! I used parchment paper instead of non-stick spray on baking sheets. Added sliced fennel and it was delicious!

I made this to serve with the Moroccan chicken with green olives and preserved lemons. It was quite good on its own. I would tend to agree that it's not the best use of Meyer lemons (hard to come by for me) but it's still a great way to prepare root vegetables.

I totally disagree with worldbeat. As they acknowledge in the review they haven't made this recipe. The lemons are not for garnish but instill a flavour to the vegetables. IT is really easy and very tasty definately a recipe to re-do in our house. When you put it on the baking tray pile the vegetables on top of the lemons to enhance the flavour.

This is REALLY super if you love root vegies! I used fresh Key limes as we did not have Meyer lemons and the dish was VERY Sparkly tasting with these. The flavors meld well over night and the garlic is heavenly with the other flavors. a Wonderful Tropical Style vegie!

I agree with worldbeat. Meyer lemons wasted. I love parsnips but their flavour is overpowering and carrots should out number the parsnips. It would require potato to mellow out the dish. Would not make this dish again.

I make roasted veggies quite frequently and can tell by looking that this recipe ain't happenin'! I can't for the life of me figure out why anyone would want to put lemon slices in this. Trying too hard to be fashionable. Here's a few tips: substitute shallots or rough chopped red onion for the garlic cloves; substitute duck or bacon drippings for half of the olive oil. Sprinkle generously with a couple of teaspoons of fresh or dried thyme leaves. Take care not to crowd the pan or the veggies will steam instead of roast. I'd strongly suggest throwing in a diced potato to mellow this out a little. By then, you'll have a totally different and much tastier recipe.
