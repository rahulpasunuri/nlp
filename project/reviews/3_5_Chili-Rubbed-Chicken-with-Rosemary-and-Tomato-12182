Alas, one of the first dishes from Epicurious that we haven't liked immediately! I think with several modifications, we'll make it again, but as written, I don't think it's a fantastic recipe. I took hints from other reviewers and increased spices and marinating time. The chili was overwhelming in the sense that it made this more of a "single note" dish than adding to the complexity of flavors. Did like the tomato...always love rosemary...like I said, we'll probably work with it and try it again someday, but it wasn't a bang-up success.

This is one of those reviews that everyone hates, since I didn't make the recipe as written at all, didn't fuss with the rosemary and the skewering, etc. I just made the marinade (doubled with extra spice), pounded the chicken breasts to about 1/2" thick, rubbed the marinade into the chicken, and after about an hour ploped them on the grill. I serve it with the coleslaw w/yogurt dill dressing, from this site, and blanched green beans. It is so quick and simple, and has become my boyfriend's favorite meal.

Do give this a long marination. The preparation was problematic: the skewers don't necessarily want to hold the chicken-breast pockets together. I found it much easier to grill and handle the chicken by trussing it. The trussed and grilled packages presented very well slanted atop a bed of garlic couscous (with the string removed) with a vertical rosemary sprig garnish. I decorated the plates with some dabs of a couple sauces (chipotle mayo and yellow bell pepper) and a confetti toss of tomato brunoise. The point is, it plates up nice...

The chicken was a bit bland -- I would marinade it as long as possible. We added some extra veggies for more kick, as well as some roasted tomatoes. Definitely a healthy dish. Works well with a garlic couscous.

We loved it! The fresh tomato added a great dimension of flavor.

Excellent recipe, easy to make, can prepare ahead of time. I made this when I had a friend over for dinner, we both loved it. I also tenderized the meat to make it more foldable, and it seemed to cook pretty evenly. This will be a often-remade dish for me....

I was a little disappointed with this. I expected it to be spicier, so next time I would definitely add a jalapeno or serano pepper. I also found the chicken did not cook evenly. The inside of the fold undercooked while the outside overcooked. So with some variations, I think this could be much better. I like it better with the tomatoes grilled separtately. But definitely worth trying! Great to find a fat free marinade.

Easy to prepare for the grill. Delicious flavor and a nice presentation. I added more garlic for the marinade.

This was very tasty. The combination of chili and rosemary worked very well. It was easy as well. Oh, I pounded the chicken flat so it was easier to fold over the tomato. I used metal turkey skewers.

Easy, flavorful, mostly do-ahead dish. I make extra rub, coat chicken breasts, and freeze individually for a nice weekday dinner. I have made it along with burgers and steaks and served at barbeques for those who are watching their fat or calorie consumption. It has been very popular and I have had numerous recipe requests.

The wrapping was a bit challenging-it seemed very fat-but the skewers seemed to keep it together. The tomato fell apart but imparted a nice flavor and kept the chicken moist. The rosemary really added flavor and made a nice presentation. My husband liked it too.
