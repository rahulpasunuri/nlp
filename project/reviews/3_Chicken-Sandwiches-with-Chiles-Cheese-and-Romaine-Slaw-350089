I loved it!I did make a couple of modifications. I seasoned the chicken with "all purpose adobe" and I used fresh jalapeno instead of canned. I paired this sandwich with avocado . Great lunch on the go.

I was super skeptical as I was making this and so glad I went ahead with it as written. WOW it's delicious!

One of the best, most interesting chicken sandwiches my husband and I have ever had. We will definitely make these again!

The flavors just didn't blend in this recipe. I didn't think it worth making again.

This was a FABULOUS sandwich! Big hit for football Sunday, too. I'd add garlic and more salt to the hot sauce when in blender stage. And even though it seemed like the jalapenos would be incredibly overwhelming, they added just the right amount of kick, but subtly. Will definitely make again!

Easy and all of the flavors are good, but the slaw really makes the sandwich.
