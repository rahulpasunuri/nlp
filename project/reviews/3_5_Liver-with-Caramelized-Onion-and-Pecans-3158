It was great, however the cooking times according to the recipe were incorrect. I used an electric stove and an iron skillet with the medium heat, according to the directions. But to carmelize the onions takes longer than 10 minutes and cooking the liver took longer than 2 minutes. I cooked everything a little longer than recommended and it turned out great, except I did get a bite here and there of the liver that wasn't quite cooked long enough. It's a great recipe for the experienced cook, but for someone who is dealing with liver for the first time, I wouldn't recommend it.

My husband loved it, I thought is was good. I would make it again, but use a little less balsamic vinegar. Also added mushrooms to the onions.

Sorry, the balsamic overpowered the delicate sweetness of the beautifully browned onions. Perhaps a dash of balsamic vs. an entire 1/4 cup would suffice. I prefer another Epicurious recipe, "Venetian Liver and Onions."

This was very easy to make and tasty. I will make it again, but it really takes something fantastic to earn 4 forks and I just felt this recipe wasn't it.

One word of advice: make sure you buy calves liver and not beef liver. The difference is huge, no matter what recipe you use.

Odd as the recipe appeared to me at first, I was impressed by the reviews people gave it. I'm a big liver fan and this is now my favorite recipe. The vinegar and cloves flesh out the flavor and the crunchy nuts give the texture another dimension, too. Give it a shot.

I cooked this for my girlfriend after she had expressed a craving for liver (oh oh!). She said it was the best liver she had ever tasted. I think the ground cloves make it special. Like a previous reviewer, I used walnuts intstead of pecans and that worked exceedingly well. I served it with mashed potatoes (a must for this dish, I think) and asparagus tips marinaded in olive oil and salt and then grilled in a ridged pan along with strips of red pepper. These last two ingredients really picked up and enhanced the flavours of the caramelized onion as well as looking spectacular.

I hate liver but I made it for my husband who loves it. The only changes I made were to cut down on the cloves which I only added to the onions. I had thin slices of liver which I dredged lightly in flour seasoned with salt and pepper. I cooked the liver for a very brief time which left it very tender. My husband LOVED it even though he wasn't sure at about the onion mixture at first, he it loved too. It smelled really good so with some urging from my husband I tried a little. I have to say as someone who never liked liver, I'm a convert. This was absolutely delicious. Maybe it was the thinness of the liver, I don't know but it was excellent. We'll definitely make it again!

I love liver and onions and this is the best recipe I have ever tasted, very easy to make. Was nervous about using ground cloves but it turned out great. Will always make liver and onions with this recipe from now on.

This is our favourite liver and onions recipe by far. True comfort food for casual nights at home. Pour on the balsamic, crank up the pecans, and don't overcook that liver. Its a winner.

It's really delicious; my husband loved it (best meal we had in days). Instead of calv or beef liver I tried it with chicken liver (what I had handy) and it was delicious. I served it with a simple potato gratin at the side. This recipe will become one of my staples: simple, cheap, fast and simply good food.
