I saved this recipe for years, since there were no markets nearby that had the cross cut ribs. Now with an Hmart a mere 15 minutes away, this has become a family favorite. The spinach with toasted sesame seeds is a terrific side dish with it as well. The meat just falls off the bones - I never change a thing about the recipe!

This is a Great recipe and I use it on all kinds of beef cuts. I generally make a batch and as I am separating my cuts for the freezer pour the marinade in then. some times I cut out the vinegar and substitute Ginger

Marinated for 24 hours and then BBQ as said. Easy, quick and delicious. Would be best as part of a multi course Asian dinner.

I used 1/2 cup applesauce to sweeten this sauce up a bit and because I noticed some recipes use pureed pear in them. Then added 2T. ginger, chopped, and 1t. chili-garlic sauce. I boiled the leftover marinade to make a sauce. Served with rice and kimchi and it was awesome!

Fantastic recipe! Did change the preparation a bit. After 24 hours in marinade, I seared the ribs, put them in a heavy pot, and let them cook slowly on the bbq for 2 hours. Took the ribs out, put the pan on stove and cooked marinade down to glaze. Put the ribs back on the hot bbq, brush with glaze and enjoy! Our favorite Korean Short Ribs EVER!

These are OUT OF THIS WORLD good!!! I found the cross cut ribs at a nearby Mexican food market as another review suggested. They were quite a bit thinner than what is called for in this recipe, more like 1/8" thick and took just a couple of minutes on each side. These were maybe even more scrumptious the next day cold. Just bought another batch to make for the weekend....mmmmmmmmm!

Made this for a Korean gourmet club dinner. Great flavor and very easy to prepare. I let them marinate for 3 days, and they were so tender! I made two batches; added a little ginger to one, and some chili garlic paste to the other based on others' comments. Everyone asked for the recipe, so I'll make this one again.

Easy & delicious! 8/10 on my scale. We marinated the meat about 20 hours. I bet this would be good with flank steak too.

Excellent! Used boneless short ribs and cut them in serving size pieces. Served with kimchi potato pancakes and cucumbers with wasabi and rice vinegar. A definite keeper.

Good, but not the best Korean BBQ I've had. If I were to use this recipe again, I would use low sodium soy sauce and add a little minced ginger.

Loved this. It is going to be a family standard. We served it with cauliflower puree.

Overall a good recipe. The garlic and salt level was perfect, although the marinade could have been a bit sweeter. The short ribs I bought were a little tough (maybe that's why they were on sale) and next time I'll add a kiwi to act as a tenderizer. Finally, I broiled them in the oven. Placed them on a cooling rack with a jelly roll pan underneath to catch the drippings and set it about 2-3 inches away from the heating element. Broiled it for 5 minutes on the first side, 2 minutes on the second side and it was perfect.

I have made these ribs several times but never for guests. We had an Asian themed dinner with friends and served these ribs. I thought I'd made extra but every single rib dissappeared.

This was easy to prepare and tasted great, husband and daughter liked it alot. It's rare that they agree on food. I added minced ginger root to the marinade. I served the Sesame Spinach recipe with it, and it was also delicious.

This is a great recipe for Korean Short Ribs. Made the marinade and used Short Ribs and boneless chicken thighs. Grilled and sprinkled finely sliced scallions for a pretty presentation. Both ribs and chicken were eagerly gobbled up!

If you are looking for a really good recipe for short ribs, this is it! I loved the flavors! I used extra brown sugar and added honey to really bring out the sweet flavor. Authentic or not, this is a keeper.

Some times I wonder about some of you overly-critical so-called cooks--who give a **** if it is authentic or not--it is delicious!! So, why don't you anal-retentives find something else to do other than nitpick!!

I have to jump in and comment on the "unauthentic-ness" of this recipe. My sister-in-law, who is Korean and an excellent cook, recommended this recipe to me as a very good Kalbi recipe that she makes. I also have to echo the comments of others that there is no definitive Kalbi recipe. One of my sisters-in-law has been known to put Coke in her marinade! I agree this recipe is not the best Kalbi I've ever had, but it is pretty good, and relies on ingredients that many kitchens have on hand. Three forks!

I love this recipe. The flavors are great. I have made it several times for BBQs and always get rave reviews. I add ginger to the marinade for extra flavor.

Rating: 4
it's really tasty. i first tried it when I used to have a korean homestay student. You could even make it sweeter(if you like sweet food). it's healthy, too because if you look at the ingredients, it has little bit of everything. Kalbi(that's the Korean name) way to go!

Those who object to the vinegar and brown sugar might want to look at the Korean short rib recipe from Gourmet `92. The point that it isn't quite authentic is well-taken, but even Korean recipes for this dish vary widely. This is basically a variation of terriyaki, and I found this recipe to be delicious. Short ribs are indeed fatty, but you can find some that are less fatty than others. Slice these THINLY- otherwise the sugars will burn before the interior gets cooked. Also, add some kiwi- it has a natural tenderizer, but only add it in the last hours of marination or else the meat can get mushy. Boil the leftover marinade to serve as a sauce, especially if you are serving it with rice.

Brown sugar and rice vinegar may add some flavor to this dish, but those are not required ingredients in teh recipe to make authentic Korean Galbi. I hate to read Asian recipes in various American cooking magazines with so many errors/ wrong ingredients.

Rating: 1
Brown sugar is as foreign in Korea as snowballs in Hawaii. And there is absolutely no need for the rice vinegar unless you're making sushi. Good thing I have my own Korean restaurant to make this correctly.

This was soo good!! I made it your a BBQ party and everyone just loved it. It helps that the cut is not super thin like what you see in the korean restaurants, it is somewhat still thick so the meat was tender instead of chewy.

My guests devoured these ribs so quickly, I almost didn't get any!! I doubled the marinade (for 12 lbs of ribs)and let them "soak" for 72 hours. I also used 1/2 granulated sugar and 1/2 brown sugar, and added chopped fresh ginger. These were easy and delicious.

Korean pears aren't necessary for kalbi. What's Korean about this recipe? Barbequed short ribs, aka kalbi, is probably one of the most famous and delicious Korean dishes (bulgogi is another famous one), and this recipe is a basic Korean recipe for kalbi. It doesn't need to be complicated to be authentic.

You need ground Korean pears and ginger. Korean pears tenderize the meat. Exactly what is Korean about this recipe?

We really enjoyed this. If you are unable to find the korean style short ribs a flank steak will also be tasty. I love to grill and this was simple with a taste that makes an impact on the taste buds.

I made this recipe when it appeared in the magazine (and it was fabulous), but I am almost positive that the marinade had tons of ginger. I see in other reviews that readers have been adding it.

This was so-so. I've made galbi many times and there are so many other great ways to do it. Half the amt of soy and substitute the other half w/ teriyaki. Chop onions and a smidgen of kiwi fruit together in a food processor and add that, plus the chopped green onions to the marinade. And don't forget about sesame seeds! Also sub about third of the sugar w/ honey. Both honey and kiwi really tenderize the meat.

These are fantastic, and very easy. I'm with Port Chester--why exactly did you freeze and reheat them? These ribs should be eaten right after grilling.

I thought this was great! who grills to the rare stage,freezes them, reheats them in the oven and expects them to be tender and juicy? What were you thinking?.

A real disappointment. I grilled these to the rare stage,then froze,and reheated in the oven. They were very tough and dry even after leaving in the oven for only a few minutes just to heat through.

These were sooo good. We used regular beef ribs instead of the short ribs and had to cook them in the oven. Next time we will definately use the short ribs and hopefully have a bbq.

This is coming from a Korean who knows Kal-bi. I thought the recipe was a bit on the bland side and noticed a major absence, ginger! When I made it the second time with ginger and a 1/4 cup of regular sugar it was outstanding.

Loved it! I'm on my way out to the grill now to make them in -37c weather! Any suggestions on keeping beer from freezing, other than "drink faster". Again, just great recipe!

This is the most delicious Korean BBQ marinate that my family ever taste. Pounding the meat lightly before marinating (which I learned from a friend in my cooking class)makes the BBQ tender.

Rating: 3
I made this for the family just because I found the ribs at the market and the price was right. I have had them in Korea and Hawaii and loved them but thought the would be hard. What a great recipe so easy. The whole family raved! I was only able to marinate them for about 10 hrs. But the flavor was still good. I think I will try them under the broiler as its getting too cold to BBQ.

If you have ever been to Maui and had ribs from Azeka, this is the closest recipe we have ever found. We have made it three times in three weeks, and vow to have these ribs in our freezer at all times. We marinated for 48 hours and bumped up the sugar and it is very close to the "secret" Azeka recipe. YUM!

I too used this recipe with rib eyes. It was fabulous -- my son, who will not eat meat, ate an entire steak cooked with this marinade! I just used this recipe for a dinner party and everyone raved about the steaks! Try it, it's wonderful....

I really loved this recipe. Since reading the recipe I was craving this meal and it didn't disappoint. The one mistake I made was having the butcher cut the ribs too thick (they didn't soak up enough marinade). This will certainly become a regular addition to our BBQ.

Had this recipe for a while and decided to make it last nite - wow - the marinade was a keeper for life and the spinach was the best.....the short ribs I had had the bone in it so had to grill it a little longer....can't wait to make it again for company instead for just my wonderful super husband

I haven't tried this recipe, but I have a delicious family recipe for this dish. On the whole, the recipe seems authentic, except for the vinegar in the marinade.I would recommend omitting the vinegar, and substituting a chopped small onion for the green onion and pureeing all the ingredients in a blender. You definitely need to marinate overnight, and the ribs are great eaten wrapped up inside of leafy lettuce leaves with a bit of bean paste or chili paste.
