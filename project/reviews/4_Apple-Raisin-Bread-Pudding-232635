Oh gosh, that should be spelled "Panettone".

Had some left over Pantone from Christmas and thought this recipe sounded like a good way to use it, so I substituted the Pantone for the cinnamon raisin bread, added my own cinnamon, a few left over candied pecans and some cranberries. I omitted the step of browning the bread, opting to use chunks of Pantone just as it was. Incredible and delicate. Wonderfully flexible recipe.

I am so excited to have found such a simple and delicious recipe. I added cinnamon and chopped up dates in place of most of the sugar and it turned out amazing

I have to agree with most of the other reviews. I made this last night for a dinner on a rainy,cold, miserable, power-outage kind of day. It was a huge hit and one of the easiest desserts I've made in a long time. Like most others I had to add a little extra touch of my own including a light sprinkle of extra cinnamon and a small splash of vanilla. I made it in the souffle dish and had it in the oven for exactly 50 minutes. I hate when breadpudding gets too dry, and this was perfectly done and creamy.

What a wonderful comfort food for a chilly night's dessert. I used Costco's Kirkland Brand whole grain cinnamon raisin bread and added 1 teas. of vanilla to the egg/half and half mixture. The leftovers were perfect with coffee for breakfast.

I tried this for a Sunday dessert. Naturally I didn't have the right pan size and I slightly overcooked it in the bargain! It was still fabulous. So, we have a great tasting dish that's also somewhat forgiving. You can't lose with this recipe.

REad this understanding I am pretty much incapable of following a recipe to the letter: great pudding - guests loved it. Easy and made with stuff you'll almost always have in the pantry. I used honey/oatmeal bread and added 1/2 t. cinnamon when I cooked the apples. Used Granny Smith and added dried cranberries instead of raisins. Also added walnuts and 1/4 t. nutmeg to the custard. Also topped with lightly whipped cream. Is it the same recipe? Probably not, but it was delicious, presented beautifully and I'll make it again for sure.

Ever the deviant, I used a very stale French loaf with left the crusts on, and used a Golden Delicious apple. I sprinkled the top with cinnamon before baking. It was quite good!

Deliciously delicious. Easy to make and enjoyed by everyone in the household- adults and toddler! I didnt have cinnamon raisin bread so i just buttered the bread and sprinkled cinnamon on top and toasted it in the oven. The raisins were sprinkled throughout the dish just before it went into the oven. The water-bath is a must. Will definitley make it again.

Very easy and so tasty. Comfort food at its best.

A very easy recipe to make, and my dad (who is rather picky about his bread pudding) loved it. The water bath helps keep it moist, and the apples keep it from being too heavy. I added some vanilla extract because I think any baked goods are better with it, and added a bit more cinnamon as well. This recipe is a keeper.

I used leftover STALE french bread, added cinamon and raisins and did not measure, I also baked it in the oven, came out as a cross btwn bread pudding and a custard. Very good, and hard to mess up, experiment some, simple flavors compliment each other well. Oh, added brandy as welll!

I'm not much of a dessert cook, but this was great, easy and delicious. Made it for my picky book group and got raves!!

If you don't have raisin bread, use whole wheat or grain bread and raisins. I did. The water bath bake made it souffle like....I also added some grated sharp cheddar cheese in the last few minutes of cooking and changed from back to broil...served it for brunch and it was very well received.
