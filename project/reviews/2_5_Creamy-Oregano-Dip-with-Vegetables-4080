This went over like a lead balloon. I let it sit overnight so the flavors would develop, and that helped... but folks didn't seem to like it, and I had to force myself to eat it. Might be better with a bit of garlic or grated onion? It just didn't have much flavor; rather bland even with the cayenne.

This refreshing dip is lovely with a crudite platter and is also a nice topping for the Chickpea Walnut Burgers found elsewhere on this site. I added a dash of lemon pepper for added spice. It tastes good right when it is made and even better once the flavors develop. We discovered it's a much healthier alternative to sour cream-based dips and a good way to eat our veggies. Enjoy!

This is a very good addition to an assortment of appetizers. It is light and refreshing, and good with both veggies and crackers. It helps balance out heavier appetizers.

This is best for guests who prefer healthier, vegtarian, spicer fare. I love this dish, but I served it to a "meat & potatoes" crows and they weren't that impressed. The dip was very fresh, and was fun to prepare, as it gave my kitchen a nice smell what with all the lemon and oregano. I have since made this again and cannot wait to make it for my friends, who would definitely appreciate this fare.

The dip really has to sit overnight for the flavors to 'come out.' It's a refreshing alternative to standard onion dips. The dip is tangy and spicy and also is great with pita bread. My guests loved it!

This dip was okay - very mild flavor (in spite of the cayenne). I probably will not make again
