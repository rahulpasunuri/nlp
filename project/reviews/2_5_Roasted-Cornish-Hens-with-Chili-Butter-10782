Good, but not great. May make again if only due to the recipe's simplicity and the fact that it draws on items I have in my pantry. Agree with the first reviewer that the chili powder and cayenne just didn't give it the pop I was hoping for.

Perhaps I just realized that I do not particularly like Cornish hens...perhaps I wasn't in the mood - whatever the case, the result was disappointing and greasy...and largely tasteless (even with all that butter and chili powder)...
