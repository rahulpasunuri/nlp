I thought these were good, but they were a little bland for me. I didn't have any the right cheese so I substituted parmesan, maybe that was why? I would probably add a little more garlic as well

Excellent! Perfect to serve with a hearty soup, but also a great appetizer. Will definitely make over and over again!

So easy to make and so delicious. It's ideal with cocktails as the recipe introduction says. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

This was quite good. I cut the baguette in 6" lengths, removed the bottom side to open it up and then topped it. This way it was a bread side to the meal instead of a d'Oeuvres. It was well received by all.

This quick and very easy recipe is ALWAYS a hit anytime I'm entertaining- even with the kids. The fresh parsley makes it look fancier than it really is- a no brainer!

I too did these as part of Thanksgiving appeitizers. I had some Cacioricotta, so used that along with Parmiggiano Reggiano, and forgot the parsley! They were still pretty popular.

Made these as an appetizer for Thanksgiving and they were gone in minutes! I used homemade ciabatta bread instead of baguette.

This is an easy-to-make and yummy appetizer, but I did find that the toasts tasted extremely salty to me. I realized I didn't have kosher salt and substituted less table salt, but maybe that was the difference. I also think you can easily dispense with the parsley topping. It clumps unless chopped very, very finely. I'll give these another try, for sure.

A good ratio of garlic to cheese. I think it would be good paired with soup, pasta, or simply as a tasty appetizer. Very quick to make. I cooked mine on the convection setting and got a nice slightly browned top. Yummy.
