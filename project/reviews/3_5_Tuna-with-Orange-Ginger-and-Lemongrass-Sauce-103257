Tasty, with a few alternations. I used salmon, used more of all the spices, and only 1 tbsp of corn starch. Very good over rice and bok choy with sesame oil and soy sauce.

I really didn't care for this recipe. I can't put my finger on what it was, but I will probably not make it again. A little bland perhaps? I just think there are better recipes out there for tuna.

Very tasty! Next time I'll add a little fish sauce to give more of a Thai flavor. I wasn't thrilled with the bits of garlic, ginger, & lemongrass so I strained it after making it. Looks prettier and the taste is still very intense. Served with sauteed bok choy & snow peas and Near East's sesame-ginger rice. Great, healthy, easy Friday night dinner!

Always on the lookout for new tuna recipes and this is a quick and outstanding winner with great bold flavours. I find using lemon grass in 1/4 inch pieces much better for removing from sauces and soups, but for this sauce I stained it just prior to serving. I made the sauce per the directions but let it sit for about 1/2 hour off the heat, then reheated just as I was searing the tuna - then strained it and the presentation was fabulous.

Just ok. The sauce overpowers the tuna. If you cut down on the red pepper flakes, it may help. Definately puree the sauce. Use black and white sesame seeds to enhance the appearance. Serve with bok choy and other colorful Asian vegetables.

the taste of the orange is too overpowered by the mixture of the garlic, ginger, lemongrass, and onion. good but wouldn't do it again!

I made this recipe as is...then I made it again and used salmon instead of tuna. We prefered the salmon. This sauce is amazing...and NOT the same with lemon juice...MUCH better with lemongrass. YUM!

This is a good recipe for tuna. The presentation is not fantastic with the sauce, but it definitely is tasty - the sesame seeds work well as well. Surprisingly spicy though; make sure you complement the dish with a contrasting vegetable.

I loved the flavor of the sauce in this recipe. I doubled the sauce recipe and did not puree. I personally enjoyed the crushed red peppers and added a little extra to give it a kick. Everyone enjoyed it.

this sauce did not complement the tuna as well as I thought it would. I have almost all of it left - my husband (who caught the tuna) scraped his off and used the asian vinagrette I made for the salad. Oh well, I can't win every time!!

I wasn't that impressed with this. Maybe because I didn't have onions. I much prefer a pineapple/ginger/soy sauce marinade, reduced on the stovetop while the fish bakes or grills, then drizzled over.

I followed this recipe to the letter and thought that it was outstanding. Spend the extra $$ and get the really fresh tuna from the seafood store. This recipe does a great job of bringing out all that is good in tuna.

I will use this sauce for lots of other things. It's really tasty

Great combination of flavors. Depending upon the thickness of your Ahi, 3 minutes per side may be too much.

We thought this was a very tasty dish. I didn't find it necessary to puree the sauce though.

I made the tuna on the grill and added the corn starch mixture to finish off the sauce after I brought the tuna steaks in from the grill. I served it with a spring mix salad and Champagne salad dressing. It was very tasty despite leaving out the lemongrass. I will definitely make it again the same way.

Puree the sauce?? Are you kidding, just mince everything very fine. 3 small peppers were enough to make the dish just a little spicy. I'd cut back just a little on the ginger and add a little extra lemon grass. The tuna must be very fresh and cooked rare. Will try grilling the tuna next time for a change.

I thought this was ok. I used blood oranges (it was what I had), and it had a nice color. I think there was too much red pepper in it. It masked the orange/lemongrass/ginger flavor. I also didn't have any sesame seeds, so I seared the tuna in sesame oil instead of olive. I'll try it again without the pepper, or at least with a lot less.

Excellent Dish. I cut the lemon grass into 1" pieces and took them out after the sauce reduced. I then pureed sauce and heated it up just before using it and then mixed in the corn sauce mixture. I made this with steamed carrots and Shanghai Noodles with Eggplant & Bok Choy. It was great.

This is my family's favorite fish recipe. I have served it for family and guests -- everyone raves. No need to puree the sauce; just don't add the cornstarch mixture until just before serving. This keeps it from getting too thick. Also, I make it with sushi-quality tuna and just sear it and serve it rare. Slice each steak on the diagonal against the grain and overlap slices on the plate; then nap with sauce. Beautiful and delicious.

Completely agree with the suggestion to puree the sauce after it's cooked. The proportions in this recipe worked well for two 10 oz tuna steaks. I pureed the sauce when it was done boiling down but before adding the corn starch mixture, then marinated the tuna steaks in the sauce for about 15 minutes. Warmed up the sauce while cooking the tuna, added the corn starch mixture and served by pouring the sauce over the tuna on the plate. Next time I would serve over jasmine rice with some bok choy and jullienned carrots on the side. The dish works great with a nice Zinfandel.

This was very good. We used very fresh Blue Fin Tuna that my husband caught and we seared it one minute per side. I followed the suggestion to puree the sauce and it was fantastic. Served it to guests and they took the recipe home with them.

Very flavorful, good for something different. But I agree with the chef from Wilbraham in that it has an unattractive appearance and consistency. I would puree the sauce so that it's much smoother. The steamed baby broccoli, shitake mushrooms and julienned red and yellow bell peppers I made with this dish helped the presentation.

Overpowering taste of ginger and lemon... unattractive apearance and consistency.

Very, very good. My daughter was eating the sauce on everything. Will do again!

This recipe is absolutely amazing! The best main dish I have ever had the priviledge to serve. We made it for New Year's Eve in no time at all! I did it with only two tuna steaks and a full sauce recipe, and felt like it was a perfect amount. If anything was ever "bursting with flavor" this is it!

do make more sauce! i served this with broccoli and wild and brown rice. my only regret was not heeding the advice to prepare more sauce as it would have gone perfectly with the side dishes. i subbed lemon verbena for the lemongrass in a 1:1 ratio. i don't know how that changed the recipe, but it was superb.

This is a quick, delicious winner. I even used frozen tuna steaks from Trader Joe's (thawed them overnight in the fridge), and it still turned out like it was from an expensive restaurant.

Without a doubt, this is a hands down 4 fork recipe! Talk about delicious!! The sauce is amazingly flavorful. I agree with another reviewer that you do want to make more sauce than called for because you're going to want it! I made 2 tuna steaks with the full amount of sauce and we used just about all of it. This was also very easy to make which was nice. Try this recipe, you won't be disappointed!

This dish was an amazing. My father and I made I in our new house to celebrate. The smells alone could feed a family! Lemongrass was a new thing for both of us and we absolutley fell in love with it. Definity would make again!!!

I made the full recipe of sauce... for half as much tuna, wondering if I'd have too much. But no! The sauce is fantastic - and more *is* better. My husband who doesn't like fish much couldn't stop talking about it.
