So worth the time! According to my taste, and other reviewers suggestions, I sauteed the remaining onions & added red chard. I skipped frying & rolling the tortillas, dipped them in warm sauce to soften and made layers. I also used leftover baked chicken & less cheese. We thought it was better than typical Mexican restaurant enchiladas. It's also much less time consuming than a true mole sauce. Use the best ingredients you can find and enjoy.

This is a great make-ahead for entertaining. Agree that the prep time is underestimated -- active prep was definitely longer than 45 minutes. I made the recipe exactly as written and very much enjoyed the results. Made two trays the day of a dinner party along with guacamole, red rice, refried beans and a tomato salad. Very easy and great not to have to stress about the main dish with guests in the kitchen. I did not double the sauce and the resulting dish was on the dryer side, but the taste was excellent and with accompaniments (guac, sour cream, salsa) it was plenty moist. Great recipe! Will definitely make again. *For those wondering about how much chicken to use, I bought a net 2 lb rotisserie chicken, stuffed 5.5 inch tortillas to bursting and still had one or two servings of chicken mixture left over.

These enchiladas are time consuming, but worth every second. I did double the sauce like the other reviewers had suggested and it came out perfect.

Fabulous! Definitely double the sauce. I used a rotisserie chicken and I microwaved the tortillas in damp paper towels to make them pliable. Huge time saver, plus you avoid all the extra oil. Would definitely make these again! We might even be having the leftovers this morning for breakfast - that's how good they are.

Excellent! I doubled the sauce as well and would highly recommend doing so - made the perfect amount. I used a rotisserie chicken to save time, and it was absolutely fabulous. My 2 friends could not stop saying how great they were and we almost finished an entire pan between the three of us! Winner of a dish.

There is a reason over 250 people have reviewed this. It's really good. I made this a couple of years ago and used more olives than it called for (sprinkle the remainder over the top of the rolls). I'm glad I had made note of that because when I made it again tonight, the olives were the element that sent it over the top. Served with avocado and sour cream. So yummy.

I have been making this dish for years. Very yummy and reliable. It does take time, but easy to make. I serve it with Bobby Flay's green rice, and and a side dish of corn and red peppers from Ina Garten. Also make the Cheddar Jalepeno Bread. Great for entertaining, due to assembling day before.

Thanks to prior suggestions, I used a grocery store roasted chicken; I doubled the sauce; I used Pepper Jack cheese to sustain a bit of extra heat. Overall, a big hit. Don't skimp on the olives. I used every bit of sauce because I kept rolling tortillas until the filling was gone. Delectable. But, while easy, it takes a lot of time, even with a precooked, roast chicken.

I'm so glad I found this recipe!Full disclosure though- I couldn't bring myself to put in 10 tbsps of chili powder. I ended up wimping out at 6 (5 regular, 1.5 hot/smoky) and I'm glad I did. I followed other reviewers suggestions and doubled the sauce and added a can of stewed tomatoes. I also put in a bit more chocolate and subbed the olives for canned chilis since my husband isn't a fan. I know it's a lot of changes, but good recipes are just a starting point, right?

Wow! These were sooooo tasty! Trust the amount of reviewers. Modifications: doubled the sauce, used rotisserie chicken from safeway, used pepper jack cheese and added a half can of stewed tomatos to the sauce. These are all changes you will find other reviewers talk about and it was great!

Very unique enchilada recipe featuring an enchilada sauce akin to mole sauce that was delicious. To save time, I used left-over grilled chicken breasts, and layered, rather than rolled the tortillas alternating with a combined mixture of the chicken/onion/olives, and grated cheese, twice, and ending with a third layer of tortillas covered with grated cheese and remaining sauce. If I do this again, I'll add the full 5 Tbsp of Mexican-style chili powder. I only added 4 thinking it was too much, and now think it could of used a little more spiciness. Overall, very impressive and delicious!

I make this all the time, whenever I want to feed a bunch of people AND dazzle them. The olives are key - they elevate the mole with needed brightness. I also double the sauce (but reserve some for passing at the table) and top with a little chopped cilantro for color. Also, be warned, it takes almost 4 hours. But maybe only if your kitchen is wee, like mine.

I made these for a Mexican fiesta last night and they were absolutely delicious. I did follow a lot of the other reviews and doubles the sauce. I also didn't use olives in all of the enchiladas - in some I put corn and others I substituted green chiles. All varieties were delicious. They would also be good with just cheese and chiles. I topped with queso fresco in addition to jack cheese. A definite hit!

Rating: 4
I'm not somebody who usually has the time or inclination to write reviews (though I always read them!), but this recipe is stellar. And I make one change to it that seems to make it even better. I saute Swiss chard leaves and add them into the filling. It extends the filling and also adds some hearty, chewiness. Each time I make it the leftovers go away far too quickly!

Rating: 4
My mom and I made this and it was a lot of work, but well worth the effort! I took two 9 x 13 pans of these for South American food day at my son's school and they were a big hit! I used ancho chile powder and it was not too hot for the kids. I doubled the sauce as other reviewers had recommended and was glad I did! Also, I think pan frying the tortillas (brushed each side of the tortilla with light olive oil) and using the green olives and chocolate are essential to this recipe. I will make this again for my family!

This is an excellent recipe! The mole sauce is full of flavor and mildly spiced - no threat to those who don't like spicy dishes. I used a rotisserie chicken which worked well. My only recommendation would be to make a bit more of the sauce than called for so that the enchilads can be more smothered in it.

Big disappointment! I wish it wasn't so because it sounded so interesting. This is a lot of work for mediocre results. The sauce is lacking in complexity. And the sauce is everything in an enchilada dish. I don't know why others found this so good. Perhaps my early familiarity with Mexican cuisine just had me expecting more? (For the record, I used homemade chicken stock and smoked chili powder, too!)

I love this recipe. I use a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store as they're on sale on Monday's (save time & money!). Also followed another reviewers advice and rinsed the olives so that I could control the saltiness a bit better. I would definately double the sauce next time and freeze whatever I don't use. The sauce tastes so good, you want to use more than the recipe makes. My entire family loved this - even those that are not fans of green olives.

3.5 forks.I would space the prep time over 2 days next time. Plenty of stock left over to work with and the tortillas absorbed a lot of the mole so I'm definitely making more sauce next time. For those complaining about salty olives, try rinsing the brine from them with cold water first.

Made this recipe for Christmas dinner and it was a big hit! Of course the margaritas might have played a factor?

After reading all the reviews I was really expecting something spectacular. The enchiladas taste like any enmoladas (enchiladas de mole). I'll stick to my own recipe(I use queso fresco inside and cotija on top.) What I really liked though was the addition of the green olives!

Rating: 4
Always a winner! There's not one thing I would change. I've fed people who love mexican food and people who don't like those flavors and everyone raves about it. I've made this dish for 7 years now and it will continue to be a family favorite.

This recipe was extremely flavorful... and despite my eyeballing most of the ingredients, it still came out very well. I didn't have time to prepare the chicken so I shredded the breast meat from a store-bought rotisserie chicken instead. The green olives were interesting and added a surprising taste to the enchiladas.

Rating: 4
I agree with others that this takes a lot of time; more than you think. But I have to say the flavor was delicious! The amounts didn't work out for me--had lots of filling left but only made one tray of enchiladas with the # of tortillas and sauce. Could have been my mistake in the exhaustion by the end of the process--but worked great for making ahead for house guests. Used 3 TBSP only of chili powder to keep it kid friendly. A hit.

Rating: 3
Wow 5 tbs of chili powder is a little on the hot side! I guess everyone likes spicy food, but I would recommend using less and adding more to your taste. I also added some green chilies and a couple of slices of jalapenos. Also, I used 6 cups of broth and 1/2 cup of water. Plus the cinnamon is a little strong, maybe a little less of that too:) But overall the taste is fantastic!

As I rated it, this recipe is Delicious! The chocolate gives it a mole like quality that is very savory. The only thing I will change next time is leaving out the green olives. I think black would be better. The green were just far too salty for hubby and I.

I followed the recipe to the letter except made additional sauce as some had suggested. I thought it was good and very different. The olives were no issue, as a matter of fact, they were not that significant in the taste. I thought this was okay, not outstanding. Will probably choose a recipe less complicated, more simplistic next time.

This is THE BEST enchilada recipe I have every made. We often make it with the leftovers from a roast chicken, making it a bit faster. I also make this "Lasagne Style", layering the tortillas, sauce, cheese, etc. It's faster and looks and tastes just as good! Making the sauce and letting it reduce is key...so delicious!!! I usually serve with a coleslaw made with vinegar and oil dressing, onion and cilantro. Devine!

Rating: 4
These enchiladas are time-consuming, but they're well worth the effort. I made them for a dinner party and my husband's cousin ate three helpings. I've made these with both store-bought rotisserie chicken and with chicken I cooking according to the recipe. Both ways are good, but cooking the chicken at home and using the broth for the sauce, adds a depth of flavor you won't get from canned broth. I usually add two chopped chipotle peppers (with sauce from the can) and one fresh jalapeno to up the spice level a bit.

Rating: 2
This was disappointing. Living in Southern California I make a lot of Mexican food and this was just okay. Also, perhaps I was a little disorganized the day I made it, but it seemed like I was working on it all day! So to cut down on time I would definately make the sauce the day before so all you have to do is assemble it the next day. Doubling the sauce recipe is a must.

I made this dish last weekend and it was excellent. Because I was only cooking for two, I did half as much chicken, tortillas, and olives, but still used the original amount of sauce. It is a good thing I did make that much sauce because it was barely enough. Also, when the recipe says that it takes 35 minutes to reduce the sauce it only took about 15 minutes (this may have been because I live at 7,900 ft!). Also, it took 2 hours from start to finish, which was definitely more than I was planning for. However, overall, it was delicious!

This sauce is incredible! DEFINITELY double it. I needed to cook some ground sirloin, so I used that instead of chicken...still worked out fantastically! My step daughter (18 & skinny) ate three helpings. Tonight I made some highly rated empenadas (from the site) and they kept saying that they wished we would have had this dish again. (I personally like the other better, but whose to judge!). This is really exceptional....try it!

Wow, this sauce is incredible! I would have drank it if I hadn't used it on the enchiladas. The only suggestions we would make are to use Sharp Cheddar inside and possibly cut down on the green olives. But really those suggestions are neither here nor there because this recipe is pretty much flawless! Okay, I've got to stop writing cuz I'm gonna go eat another one!!!!

Sadly, this was a flop at my house. While I thought it was ok (but not great), my husband, who is admittedly picky, wouldn't even finish his. He said it was the olives. The sauce is really good, though, and would be worth using on different enchiladas. I fit everything into one 9x13 pyrex by layering it casserole-style instead of rolling the enchiladas separately. I had doubled the sauce after reading the reviews, and had some left over with this method. Upon reflection, if I were to make this again (unlikely), I would definitely take the shortcuts (deli chicken, grated cheese, hell, I might even buy pre-chopped onion and garlic) , as I was working for hours for a payoff that just wasn't worth the effort.

I didn't think this was as amazing as some of the other reviewers, but it was very good for homemade enchiladas. I added a few tblsp of tomato paste to give the sauce more depth. I found the sauce definitely needed to e doubled, and it tasted much better the next day, so i would make it ahead.

I was hesitant to try this recipe, but glad I did. I would give it 3.5 forks as written, but 4 forks with modifications. Thanks to the reviewer who suggested dipping the corn tortillas in the sauce to coat them well. I used a Safeway chicken and pre- shredded jack cheese, so they were VERY easy to make. I also used 4 cups only of the chicken broth and added a can of mexican chopped tomatoes with green chiles, as well as a small can of chopped green chiles. The green olives were a nice variation. I also thought the sauce needed to be doubled, as did others. The enchilada sauce turned out amazing. Way better than the store bought stuff. I couldn't taste the chocolate, which I think is a good sign. It added just enough complexity without screaming "chocolate!"

Small variations from some extra interest. I used MONTEREY PEPPER JACK and JALAPENO STUFFED GREEN OLIVES. I doubled the sauce recipe and still not quite enough. I'd also go with the 6 inch corn as they are slightly easier to deal with and compile. I made this for hubby's birthday last year and my mother in laws birthday this past weekend. They were a HUGE hit both times!

I was really looking forward to this dish ~ a mole' sauce with few ingredients and great reviews! The husband and I were pleased with the first couple of bites but then the sauce just started tasting "off". We live in Mexico (so are probably pretty spoiled) . and have eaten many incredible mole's, many with ingredients lists a mile long. What we decided about this recipe is that the flavors were too singular; you could pick out each individual ingredient. The best mole's are the ones that are seemless ~ no one flavor stands out on it's own. Mole' is a lot of work and this recipe wasn't worth the time.

I made this last week and froze half since we're a family of four. Needn't have bothered. The first night I suggested they start without me since I was working on biscotti and by the time I got to the table, there was barely any sauce left. Ditto with the second batch a few nights later. Next time I might make a bit more sauce. All in all, they couldn't get enough, and though it's hardly Rick Bayless at his best, it was pretty tasty.

These are amazing! I usually make 1.5 times the sauce, but I like a lot of sauce. The recipe is wonderful as is. When I'm making this for my family I cut the prep time significantly by layering the tortillas and filling instead of rolling them. Wonderful recipe-give it a shot!

divine! kept the olives and am very glad I did so. doubled the sauce (actually, halved everything in the recipe EXCEPT the sauce, same diff) and most unfortunately I let it boil too long. (maybe my burner was set too high??) that said, I wound up having almost the amount originally called for, and the result was so scrumptious that hubby is already requesting it again. note: if you can get authentic cotija or queso fresco, definitely seek that out instead of the standard jack cheese. the dish would have been amazing without, but the cotija really sealed it.

This is the best enchilada sauce I've ever tasted. I will never use canned sauce again. I used chipotle chili powder, and 5 Tablespoons was almost too hot.

It's almost unfair of me to rate this because I made some significant modifications. To the sauce, I added six tomatillos and two or three ancho chilis (the huge mild green ones) and omitted the powder. I used my hand blender to puree it down and thickened it a little bit with cornstarch. Very importantly, I followed my mexican friend's advice on assembly; you fry the tortillas for 10 seconds a side and then immediately dip them in the sauce so that they're completely covered. Fill them, roll them, and arrange them in your dish. Just before baking, cover them in more sauce (don't drown them, though). Top with cheese. This way, they're tender and moist and delicious. This recipe done this way was absolutely fantastic.

Reading this recipe leads one to think it is 'labor intensive." Here are a few tips to slide thru the prep work making a meal for family and freezing other half or pleasing a party group. ---------------------------- I use black olives instead of green(just our particular taste). SLice them in the food processor-slice blade blade.Place in bowl and then..... Shred Monterey Jack or your cheese of choice-shred blade-place along side the olives in same bowl. Cover with saran &Refrigerate. Purchase 5 lbs of chix breasts-cut off all fat-Cook in broth. KEEP THE BROTH for the sauce! Cut the cooked chix breasts in the food processor using the 'slice blade". Let the processor do the work, do not force with the 'pusher.' YOu will get nicely shredded chicken as a result. This enchilada sauce is most authentic and flavorful. I cook down 2 onions instead of one. I have also added a can of El Paso Enchilada sauce to this homemade blend if I dont have enough sauce-works well. I use 1/2 oz of chocolate chips at the end of making the sauce. Keep stiring, they blend quickly and add the last touch in flavor. I use flour tortilla's (burrito style), and fill them generously with the mixture made of cooked chicken, with monterey jack,olives and sauce- Fold of tortilla goes on the bottom. Reserve some sauce, cheese and olives as the topping. Bake as directed but good idea to broil the top once done if you love the crispy well done tortilla with toasted cheese & olives. Wonderful recipe! I have made this at least 12 times since it was posted-my alterations made it easier for me in time and effort. My husband and teenage son LOVE this recipe. Perhaps that is why I have made it time and again. I made it again last nite and had a side of guacamole, sour cream, green onions and the last of our garden tomato diced on top of the bubbling hot enchilada casserole as it came out of the broiler. YUM.

Looked at previous reviewers and followed their advice. Doubled the recipe for the sauce. Only used 6 tbsp chili powder, 3 tbsp ancho, 3 tbsp chipolte. Used rotisserie chicken from Costco. Used a 14 oz can of tomato sauce and 2 cans fire roasted chilies, cut the low sodium chicken broth to 4 cups . Made one tray using corn and the other with flour tortillas. I made these a day in advance and took them to a party even though it was the first time I made this recipe. They evaporated; everyone that happened to get some (I did not) enjoyed them and wanted the recipe. I directed them to the website for the recipe. I will definitely be making these again. I will double the sauce again and will keep the chili powder at 6 tbsp.

This recipe was terrific. We made a few shortcuts and a few additions. To cut the time we used rotisserie chicken and canned stock. We sprayed the tortillas with oil and baked them for a few minutes rather than frying them. After watching an America's Test Kitchen episode on enchiladas I felt the sauce wouldn't be right without some tomatoes, so I cut the broth to 4 cups and added an 8 oz can of tomato sauce and also a can of fire roasted chiles. After reduction and addition of the chocolate the sauce was dense and complex. The olives were a great addition. Definitely will make again.

I've made this dish numerous times. It's one I crave occasionally, but it is very time-consuming if you follow the recipe to the letter. It is worth it, though. My most recent adaptation was to steam the tortillas instead of using oil to soften them. There is a slight difference in the finished product, but not enough to warrant all those extra calories. I also prefer cheddar cheese to the somewhat dull jack, and I always mix the onions and cheese into the chicken and sauce to save time. My husband doesn't like olives so I leave those out. I also make the rice that was featured with it in the magazine. I believe it's called Three Chili Rice. Soooo yummy. I've doubled the sauce and frozen some for use with makeshift enchiladas. It freezes well.

I don't usually rate recipes, however after reading some of the negative reviews, I HAD to rate it. This is the BEST enchilada recipe. I have been making this dish for the past few years and no matter where I've made it, everyone (culturally across the board) loves it. The amount of salt utilized in any recipe can be controlled and if one doesn't like the concept of chocolate in their enchiladas, why make this recipe at all? Anyhoo, that is my two cents and defense of what I think this is a fabulous dish.

Our guests loved it! Us, too. Loved the olives - what a great idea. I couldn't find mexican chili powder here, so I used regular & it worked fine. I was concerned the sauce was too spicey before cooking...but it really does mellow during cooking. Also, I didn't bother cooking the tortillas first - still came out great. Lots of leftovers. Thought the amount of sauce was just right. And the proportion of filling per tortilla was just about perfect (but I might add a little more cheese per tortilla next time). Here, too, I couldn't find Monterey Jack, so I used manchego. Maybe that's why I want to add a little more next time! I found out this recipe is very flexible & forgiving. A keeper!

I have made this numerous times and it is great every time. Use a deli chicken to shred and bought broth as recommended if you're in a hurry and it still comes out great, but making your own broth does produce a richer and deeper sauce. A keeper for sure!

Stunningly delicious! My family devoured this; and even if you don't eat it, just make the sauce...it will fill your home with the most incredible aroma. That said, here are some things that I would change/suggest. Change...I would substitute green chiles for the olives. I used regular chile powder, so a little heat from jalepenos, adobo chiles or cayenne would have been welcomed. Suggest: I had made a roasted chicken the night before and was looking for a "leftovers" recipe so the chicken would not go to waste; therefore, rather than go through the brothing/cooking, get a 2-for. Roast a chicken and eat it one night and use the leftovers for this recipe. I had 4 cups of chicken left over from my chicken dinner and that was plenty to make this recipe. If you have half, then halve the enchilada recipe.

This is an excellent recipe. My guests all LOVED this and said it was amazing, which is why I am giving it four forks. I made 50% extra sauce like others suggested and I am glad I did. It seemed the perfect amount. Next time I make it I might even add a little more chocolate. A note to those who do not like green olives: others here have noted that you cannot taste the olives. I think that you can taste the olives and it does give the enchiladas an interesting (olivey) undertone.

served to guests with homemade guac, fresh salsa and sour cream on the side and a tomatoe salad, for an informal weeknight dinner - perfect. Took a bit of time but wasn't difficult and made enough for plenty of left overs so worth the effort. Used a rotisserie chicken to quicken things up, otherwise followed recipe exactly. Not much of an olive fan but you hardly notice them and I'm sure the add to the flavour so don't omit. The sauce was great but needed more, next time will double the sauce,as suggested by others, and save any extra for another time. Definately will make again.

Shortcut - cook the chicken whole - don't quarter, it cooks in 30-40 minutes and it then falls apart while deboning. I increased the sauce by 1 can of broth and 25% more of each of the other ingredients which I kept exactly as written in the recipe without substitions. I fried the tortillas but next time will not to save more time. I also used a larger baking dish so I was able to put all in 1 dish. Made guacamole. Total prep time i.e. oven time was 3.5 hours. Dish and taste were perfect as written. It was not too hot as many fear using the mexican chile powder which mellows with cooking and with the addition of chocolate. I wonder if the reason some of the reviewers did not like it was due to not using the hot mexican chile powder or changing the ingredients. It got 5 stars in my house and will be a keeper.

WOW - This dish was absolutely delicious. My husband and both our girls loved it. Probably the best enchilada sauce I've made. I didn't use the olives, and I cut back on the cumin and chili powder just a bit.

this is one of the best recipes on this site. the olives add to the complexity of flavor. I use chicken breasts instead of whole chicken (easier). I will be making for a house full of hurricane displaced friends - it makes so much food.

My husband (King of the Picky Eaters) loved this dish! Its by far the best, and most authentic enchilada sauce I have ever made. I followed other's advice and doubled the sauce (except for the chili powder), used low sodium broth too. I used flour tortillas - just because they are easy to work with and no need to heat them to make them pliable. I used boneless, skinless chick breasts, which worked great. This is a wonderful, easy, make-ahead dish that would get rave reviews at any party.

I used to live on the border, and this reminded me of the stuff the locals made me. Those who think the chili powder is too strong may not be using the mexican variety; even then, true mexican food tastes more strongly of chilis than the tex mex stuff. I ditto the remark regarding salt and deli substitutions; if you fiddle with a recipe, expect variation of results. Even my husband, who doesn't like green olives ordinarily, raved about this dish. Everyone I've made it for loves it!

Rating: 4
I have made this reciped on many occasions. Regarding the salty complaints: You must know that when substituting from the deli it will be high in sodium. When you substitute canned chicken broth it obviously must be low salt. The original "from scratch" recipe balances the ingredients well including the salt factor. I would not recommend substitutions. If you must be quick, make the adjustments considering the high sodium content of the deli (or prepared) product or don't blame the recipe. Your olives may be too briny as well. Get the milder ones that you use for your best martini. It is a beyond compare dish when done from scratch. Do this reciped when you have the time and you will avoid any disappointment. Good Luck!

I have to say, I'm a little surprised at the review from the cook in Co. I live in So. Cal and make mexican food quite often and I think this recipe is fabulous! I follow it exactly and I think it's better when you cook the chicken yourself but it is a bit time consuming. I usually make the sauce a day ahead to save time. I would highly recommend this! By the way - mole sauce is usually made with chocolate so that is not unusual!

I was very excited to make this dish and it turned out very disappointing. I used a rotiserie chicken and followed the rest of the recipe following every detail and all I can taste is Chili Powder. My fiance said it tasted like it came out of a box and I have to agree. This is the most disappointing dish I have ever made from Epicurious. Anyone that lives in the West or that makes mexican food fairly often...watch out!!

WONDERFUL!!! This has become my favorite meal since I made it the first time. I add a can of crushed to matoes to the sauce before I pour it on top. Great dish for company, I only put green olives in half the enchiladas because not everybody likes them(they are my favorite part) I make the chicken the day before to save time though.

WOW! Just made this recipe for my family and it was really a hit. I followed the recipe exactly as presented and would not change a thing. Grew up in southern California where I ate lots of Mexican food and this recipe made the best enchiladas I have ever had. I was a bit concerned about all the Mexican chili powder it called for but I should not have been because the chocolate mellowed it completely. It's a good recipe to make on a quiet day off when you have sufficient time but well worth the effort. Yummy!

These are great enchiladas! Don't skip the green olives they really made the meal. I used less cheese to cut back on the fat and they were still great.

Left out the olives, added some diced tomatoes and caramelized onions to the chicken before rolling them, and I have to say this is one of the best Mexican recipes I've ever made. Prepared this for clients today, and they said these were the best enchiladas they'd ever eaten. The sauce tastes better as it cools, so don't be freaked out if the cinnamon or any other flavor seems overpowering. Let it cool, then you can reheat. Honestly-an amazing dish.

I have been making this recipe since it orginally appeared in 1998 and is one of my favorites. It is time consuming but so delicious, it will remain one of my family and friends' favorite dishes for years to come I am sure. The Three Chili Rice also goes wonderfully with it.

This is my new favorite enchilada dish! I have wanted to make this one for a while because the chocolate intrigued me. I tasted the sauce before adding the chocolate, and it was pretty good. The flavors (including the heat from the chipotle chili powder) were kind of sharp. But when I added the chocolate it gave the whole sauce a mellow richness. It really made the whole thing come together. And I would never have guessed there was chocolate in the sauce if I hadn't put it in there myself. My husband and I both loved this. We had it with chips and salsa, refried beans and rice with corn and peas. (Also, I loved making this dish. There is something very satisfying about quartering the chicken with a cleaver.)

Prepared this recipe using leftover roasted chicken breast meat that I shredded. Doubled the sauce ingredients, and used equal amounts of hot, and mild chili powder because the hot was VERY hot. Used black olives that I already had, green onions instead of chopped regular for the filling only, and mixed in one large bowl along with the chicken, and cheese. Warmed white corn tortillas over burner with open flame. Served with corn sauteed with olive oil, butter, minced garlic, and lime juice. Garnished both with chopped cilantro. Made for a delicious, easy, make ahead of time dinner.

This dish was delicious! I followed the following tips from previous posters and would encourage others to do so, too: use pre-cooked chicken, mix fillings before assembling, skip the frying step (I microwaved corn tortillas in a damp paper towel for 30-45 seconds) and change green olives to black. I also added about 50% more chocolate than called for. I've had this dish with both corn and flour tortillas, and I would recommend corn. The flour tortillas can get a little gummy. But overall - so good!

Fantastic!! My daughter lives in Santa Fe and said this recipe is as good as the local food. (We did use Santa Fe chili powder in the recipe) Rave reviews from everyone who had it. I did NOT find it time consuming or messy. Thought it was easy and delicious. Highly recommend!!

These were awesome! I followed the other reviews and did double the recipe but you really don't need to double the chicken broth. Plus corn tortillas are a must and they have to be fried, only lightly though. My fiance, who is Mexican, tried them and loved them. He thought they were awesome. These are defintely a keeper and will be made again. A few last minute things: I used 2 5.5 llb. chickens prequarted and had extra chicken and used the smaller tortillas (say 5 in). Also, I even had left over sauce! And lastly, rinse the olives or it will taste a bit salty. Enjoy!

This dish was time consuming! The sauce in this dish is spectacular (and is the only reason I'd make this again) but everything else can be changed to make preparation go much faster. Precooked chicken, flour tortillas (easier to work with and taste better I think) and of course preshredded cheese. Doubling the sauce is a must- I did and used it all. Using half the olives and chopping instead of slicing them made them blend better. This flavors of this dish are more complex than your average enchilada dish so this is perfect for entertaining.

This was very good and my first attempt at any kind of mole sauce. I will say that even though I love to spend the day in the kitchen, this took some effort. Our dinner party for four was a hit. I served this with BBQ corn and homemade cookies and cream ice cream. Here are my changes: Instead of all chicken broth, I added i bottle of ale and a bit of water. Like others suggested, I doubled the recipe for the sauce and didn't have quite enough stock. I also mixed the filling ingredients all together and had pepper jack and cheddar instead of monterrey jack. Don't know if it made a difference. I also added a can of diced green chilies to the filling (4 oz) and a can of diced black olives as my husband doesn't like the green. Like others, I skipped the frying tortilla step and just softened them in a toaster oven wrapped in foil. One cracked, but the rest were perfect and if you add enough sauce to the filling mix, it is wet enough to really moisten the tortillas. Next time I think I WILL serve it wil a pico de gallo sauce, or something cold and refreshing because this is heavy and rich, especially for the Spring/Summer.

This was extraordinary! We skipped the green olives but otherwise stuck to the recipe. It was very very tasty. We are using this as a kick-off point for a new burrito recipe..can't wait to see how they turn out! This recipe made two lasagna pans of enchiladas, so plan to either freeze some or take it to a party..

I would give this 2 1/2 stars if I could. The enchilada sauce is very good. My family just thought green olives coompeted with the flavor of the sauce. I would make again, but substitute black olives for the green. Also, this is messy and a bit time consuming - so I would save for company!

I doubled this recipe and made this dish a day in advance for a group of hearty eaters. It got RAVE reviews. I cut out the olives--I;m not a fan. I think you'll definitely needed to double the sauce in this recipe. Besides the olives, I wouldn't change a thing! A big crowd pleaser.

As written this was quite a bit of work, especially since I had never made a mole sauce, and had to keep checking the recipe. I didn't use green olives but substituted frozen chopped spinach. Also added a bit more seasoning and used flour tortillas. Brought it to a block party and it received rave reviews.

Rating: 4
Delicious as is -- though it would probably still be tasty without the olives. Definitely combine filling ingredients to shorten prep time. Purchased rotisserie chickens work fine. Also, for a party, we made one dish of chicken enchiladas, and a vegetarian version (substitute black beans for chicken). Both versions got great reviews. To others who don't want to fry the tortillas: the corn tortillas may be soft to begin with, but they'll turn to mush if not BRIEFLY fried. This won't happen if you fry them. Do add the chocolate. The finished result will NOT taste chocolaty, just richer and deeper. Try this dish -- you won't be sorry.

These enchiladas were great! The sauce was wonderful - so much better than anything you would find in a can. And it was very easy to make. I did use black olives instead of green, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The amount of sauce is rather sparse, so I might make more next time as others suggested. Also, next time I will add the cheese on top when I take the enchiladas out of the oven and let it melt on top before serving - otherwise, it just melted away in the oven and you didn't even know it was there. Very tasty though!!!

What a delightful discovery for a Texan living in the far north to find such a delicious enchilada recipe. The big surprise was in how good the mole sauce is. It is quite rich and delicious, yet very simple compared to other moles. The only thing I did different ly from the recipe was make my own chile powder: 4 dried new mexican, 2 anchos and one chipotle, seeded and roasted briefly in the oven, then ground in a coffee mill. As to the use of chocolate in the recipe--absolutely! (No surprise since chocolate originated among the Aztecs and Mayans). It adds wonderfully to this dish. Make it exactly according to the recipe and you won't be disappointed.

Rating: 0
I am searching recipes, and I noticed the question from the reviewing below me. The reason for the chocolate addition is to make the sauce a "mole" sauce. If you have ever been in a Mexican restaurant, you will notice "Chicken in Mole Sauce" It is different from enchillada sauce in that it is thick, and sweet, and the chocolate gives it a depth that is really rich. So, I haven't tried this recipe, but I do see that it is a mole type sauce. Usually mole sauces also have pumpkin seeds added. Hope this helps.

I have made enchalladas before. They were simpler than the ones described in this recipe. I got the recipe from a friend's mom (who is from Bolivia, speaks Spanish and lived near Mexico (Tucson, AZ) for many years with her family). It basically called for tortillas, enchillada sause and cheddar cheese. So what I am so confused about is where the chocolate comes in. I can't imagine how adding chocolate could make this recipe good. All I can see right now is extra, unnecessary calories. Is it really better with the chocolate, or is it something I could leave out and why should I add it (what does it do, in other words)?

Made this for a dinner party and got rave reviews...a great make-ahead dish..will take other reviewers' advice next time and double the sauce. Not too spicy for adults but would cut the amt. of hot chili (or eliminate) for children..also add more chocolate. Used flour tortillas and steamed them...made for easier assembly. Am looking forward to making it again!

I made this recipe first time and left out the olives, and used flour tortillas instead (which do not need to be reheated) and only 1 tablespoon of chili. I also used shredded chicken breast, and used the water I cooked them in for the sauce. It was so simple to make and my family loved so much that I will make it again and again and again. Great to take to the cottage, all assembled, frozen, and ready to put in the oven anytime.

A flavorful chocolate-spiked mole, enchilada dish. Certainly there are time-saving devices...I made this with individual breasts (with skin and bone) and layered the pan lasagna style and it was delicious. Now I'm looking for a good pumpkin-seed sauce for chicken; for instance, where does one find hulled pumpkin seeds? any ideas in Los Angeles?

Thanks to tips from other reviewers, I made a few changes to this recipe as well. I doubled the sauce as recommended by others and also used about twice the amount of chocolate than what was called for. I also didn't use the hot mexican chili powder because I prefer a milder sauce (as do my 4 & 7 year old kids). When I tasted the sauce alone, it tasted a little peculiar and I thought the dish wasn't going to turn out well, but when it was all assembled and baked, it really was delicious. I've actually made this twice and all have enjoyed it. I also recommend making the "three chili rice" as a side.

I have made this dish many times and everyone just loves it. Each time I make it, though, I swear I will not fry the tortillas again and I vow to use already cooked chicken. I always forget though, and it takes a LONG time to prepare. I'd love to hear from someone who has steamed the tortillas instead. Is there a noticeable difference? I always leave the olives out as my husband doesn't care for them. The sauce is great. I serve refried beans and garnish with a dollop of sour cream.

Wow! This is the best Mexican food recipe of any kind I've found anywhere. I've looked for several years for a reasonable, mole-approximating recipe that would give me this taste without requiring me to take vacation to prepare it. I doubled the sauce recipe, which was necessary to cover the enchiladas, and then I doubled the chocolate and added two tbsp of brown sugar. It was all I could do not to eat it straight from the skillet. My husband, guests, and I loved, loved, loved it, and I'll be making this again.

I have made this dish twice now. The first time I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and added jalapenos AND hot salsa. That, combined with the fact that there are WAY too many onions made it HOT, HOT, HOT. The second time I added only the jalapenos, Mild salsa and cut down on the onions. Great with a side of Spanish rice!

I was quite wary about the green olives and won't eat them plain, but in this recipe they are great!

I made this first for my family, then for a group of 12 women. The reviews from them were outstanding. Everyone loved them.

Mmm, these were really good. I didn't change anything, though I must not have filled them as full because I got more than 2 pans full. Not a problem! I haven't decided if the green olives added much, and might leave them out next time. I did fry the tortillas, which is sort of a pain, I guess I'd try steaming them next time to see how that compares. The sauce is wonderful.

This was great. It was just as good reheated the following day. The sauce is a simplified version of the traditional Mexican mole - minus about 10 ingredients but nearly as good. One note - the free range French farm chickens we get here do not run to 4.5 pounds (no thanks, Frank P.) but one 3 pounder was quite enough for 16 enchiladas. Also, I was concerned that the sauce even after reduction was too thin, but it worked just fine.

Delicious. I used the "short" method and shredded cooked boneless, skinless breasts & canned broth, but I was thrilled with results. The only other changes I made was I skipped the olives and added capers instead. I may add more capers and some cayenne or green chiles next time, as we like a bit more heat. I used the hot chili powder and didn't find these too spicy at all. Definitely take the extra time and fry the corn tortillas. They were divine. I would recommend making one and a half times the amount of sauce called for. We used a little canned enchilada sauce to line the bottom of our dish because we didn't have enough mole sauce.

After living in San Diego and enjoying a many wonderful traditional mexican meals, it was nice to finally find a recipe that would compare. This has become one of my "signature" dishes and is requested often. I don't skimp on cooking the chicken or making the broth as it is wonderful! The rice, which is featured with this recipe, is fabulous along with homemade refried beans I do replace the green olives with black and as my husband is a green sauce fan I make a separate pan with Stokes green chili with pork over the top. This is a must do recipe for mexican lovers.

I made this recipe this weekend and my guests loved it. I doubled the sauce as previously suggested. Although still very good, I think doubling the sauce only overpowered the taste of the green olives with chili powder. Next time, I will not double the sauce. I recommend mixing all the ingredients together instead of layering in the enchiladas as well. I would suggest using half mild chili powder and half mexican hot if your guests don't like really spicy food. Double the chocolate in the sauce to get a rich brown color to sauce. Serve topped with sour cream or maybe guacamole for presentation. Buy the chicken already quartered so you don't have to cut it yourself. Shred using forks after boiling.

I just made this for the second time. I love it. I made it much spicier this time (first time I used california chili powder, this time hot mexican molido powder.) It was REALLY spicy that night but I just ate some leftovers and it really mellowed out. Also, I doubled the recipe (quadrupling the sauce), and it took forever (which I already knew) but the happy faces of my guests made it worth it! I put more chocolate in to make it a richer browner sauce. Also, no green olives. I think green chiles would be a great addition. Also, if you make the spicy version, be sure to have plenty of sour cream on hand for guests to cut the spice with. Mexican Confetti rice on this site made a nice mellow accompaniment as well.

I cooked this reipe for some guest one night and it was a instant hit. Our guests have never experianced Mexican food before. My girlfiend and I are Califonia transplants and have yet to find a good authentic Mexican Resturant in the Boston area. This recipe was a terrific result for us and our frineds. I however did modify the recipe by adding (1) 4oz can of whole, roasted, and peeled green chili's, took out the chocolate, and reduce the broth from 4 cans to (2.5) cans.

I got this recipe out of one of the Bon Appetit cookbooks, and it calls for 5 cups of shredded cooked chicken which gives you more options than poaching a whole chicken (I used chicken breasts). Other than that, and not frying the tortillas which were already soft, I followed the recipe exactly and was pretty happy with the results - it is time consuming though! Only thing I would change is the amount of chili powder - I used mild and 5 tablespoons was still too much. I will make it again with less next time. The presentation is better than some enchilada recipes, if you're making it for guests. I also made more sauce as recommended by other reviewers, but didn't use all of it - I think you would be ok without it.

Rating: 3
My husband and 10 year old really enjoyed this dish. I did stayed pretty close to the recipe, though I subsituted chicken breasts for thighs, and used 1/2 plain chili powder instead of 1/2 of the mexican hot. I'm glad I did, as it would have been way too spicy for my daughter. I don't agree more sauce was needed. The sauce is delicious, but I think more of it would have overpowered the chicken, which was excellent with the olives. I agree mixing all of the filling together was much simpler than layering. Also, microwaving the tortillas with a couple of drops of water saves a lot of fat, and works every bit as well to soften them for rolling. Overall, excellent!

This fabulous recipe was improved by making tortilla crepes instead of using store bought tortillas. 1/2 cup plus 2 T. of instant masa flour, 1/4 cup of all-purpose unbleached flour, 1/2 t. salt, 3 eggs, 1 cup plus 1 T. of whole milk, and 3 T. melted butter. Whisk all ingredients. Let sit for 15 minutes to rehydrate. Pour through a strainer, pushing batter through with a spatula. Brush non-stick crepe pan with butter, heat to medium-high. Pour 1/4 cup of batter. Tilt pan to spread. One minute first side. Lift with fingers or edge of knife. 20-30 seconds 2nd side. Store between pieces of wax paper. Can be made day before and stored at room temperature. Recipe makes about 9-11 tortilla crepes.

After reading all the rave reviews, this was a huge disappointment. The sauce was extremely flat and boring.

This recipe is a definite KEEPER. The sauce is absolutely delicious. The 1st time I made it, I halved everything and it came out great--but needed more sauce. The 2nd time, I used 5 cans (instead of 4) of chicken broth (it was not "low-salt"--bad me) and I eyeballed the remaining measurements--using a little more than required--just as delicious as the 1st time. It's worth your time to try.

I threw boneless skinless chicken breasts into the crockpot on low, while I was at work, so getting the shredded chicken was a breeze. As one poster mentioned, I had wonderful, soft, corn tortillas that I didn't have to cook before using. So I found this recipe no harder than the average enchilada recipe. I did take a cue from others and double the sauce. Even my 7 year old cleaned his plate and asked for seconds.

So long as you don't start to burn the onions before you add the chicken broth, you can cook the mole sauce as long as you want, adding more broth or water to thin it, cooking longer to thicken it. It should be like a black-bean soup, not too liquidy but not like porridge. You can use canned stock for the enchiladas and the product of boiling the chicken for the rice, to save time. You can also skip frying the tortillas, especially the bottom ones if you need two layers in the baking dish. Almost as tasty and a bit healthier.

Although time consuming, this recipe is worth the trouble. I've gotten several compliments on the mole sauce. For those who like it hot, I use monteray jack with added jalapenos. I also leave out the olives as I find it's a bit too salty.

Very Very Good Enchiladas! A lovely mole sauce. I did not fry my corn tortillas; they were soft already. And the mole sauce was quite good, and had depth not just a flat taste--a problem I have with many moles. This is one of those very good recipes that you can work from. Make it and play with the recipe to make it perfect for you. I will substitute some queso fresco in my next try. Also, I might add a slightly hotter chile powder. I found "New Mexico Chile Powder" (the closest to "Mexican-style") in my Mission district grocery, but I think it was too mild..

This is a standby. Yes it takes an incredibly long time to prepere. But the taste is so wonderful, that it's a once every couple of months treat for us. Make lots of extra, and freeze the chicken in the sauce (but NOT in the tortilla's as they'll get mushy on reheat). Thaw and assemble in fresh corn tortillas and you're in for a wonderful treat!

Not a dish to make if you don't have a lot of time. Next time I will make the mole sauce beforehand (like the day before). Taste is wonderful.. Three forks for this one.

Very good and mole sauce good. Used a bit more chocolate/cinnamon than called for (I always do according to taste), and used flour tortillas and a mild cheddar in lieu of Monty Jack (as that's hard to find in England!). As this was for dinner party, on serving, drizzled with sour cream (used fresh which is runny over here so with traditoinal thicker style could pipe from a pastry bag or plastic bag with hole in end) and sprinkled with chopped cilantro/roasted red peppers) to add color and texture. Sauce could be used on its own with marinated chicken. Also very good leftovers next day.

This was good, but not a "knock-your-socks-off" recipe, therefor, only 2 forks given and I would not make it again. I did not alter the recipe---followed the instructions very carefully. It was too time consuming, and I even did a lot of the prep work one day prior to assembling the enchiladas. I'm still in search of the perfect enchilada recipe.

I made this recently, making some previous reviewer suggested changes. I added a bit of brown sugar and peanut butter to the sauce, and combined the ingredients before filling the tortillas. I wish I had tried it just as the recipe states first. While this version was very good, I thought it was a tiny bit too sweet for my taste. Of course, my chocolate could have also been a factor. I had no semi-sweet chocolate squares in my pantry, so I substituted about 1/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. That was probably too much to add. This recipe mades a large quantity. I froze 1/2 of the chicken mixture and some sauce (seperately) for later use. By the way, I cooked a whole chicken, weighing almost 5 lbs., and used the broth from that. I added carrot, onion, bay leaf, etc. to the chicken water as it cooked. The chicken was moist and very delicious.

made 1/2 the recipe as an experiment. very good. this was my 1st mole sauce. i would definitely make again for a casual get-together. i would experiment making it "lasagna style" (i.e without rolling the enchiladas individually)

Made two dishes of enchiladas for our Superbowl party: this recipe and another recipe with regular red sauce. These were devoured long before the other dish. Worth every minute of preparation. The amount of sauce was perfect for one baking dish so you definitely want to double it for two. And black olives, instead of green, were great.

Good stuff. I've always loved good chicken mole, and this is an excellent mole sauce.

Rating: 4
This recipe is amazing! Instead of a whole chicken, I poached about three and a half pounds of chicken breasts in some of the chicken broth. The sauce is amazing, although I agree with the others it's worth upping the quantity. I paired this with a spicy rice cooked in chicken broth with peas, a finely minced canned chipotle chile, some canned tomatoes and a spoonful of the adobo sauce from the canned chiles. It made an excellent meal with plenty of leftovers!

Rating: 3
As recommended below, I doubled the sauce. I also used more chocolate than the recipe called for (by about 1 1/2 times), and added some brown sugar and peanut butter (a tablespoon or two of each) to round out the sharpness of the chili powder. With these additions, the sauce was excellent.

Rating: 3
This is the first time I have made enchiladas and they were delicious. I did double the sauce and was glad that I did. The recipe made 2 full pans which was more than enough for me and my husband, so I sent one pan with him to his work, a firestation, and got rave reviews from every one of the firemen! Very tasty, especially served with fresh scallions sprinkled on top and sourcream.

Just great! i used flour tortillas and pork and it was wonderful. the sauce is a real keeper and I don't see why beef would not work too. i cut down on the chili powder as 5T seemed alot but will probably increase it next time.

We absolutely loved this recipe for the sauce. I didn't use the olives. I've always loved mole sauce, which is hard to find in restaurants, and this one is the best yet (and I can do it at home!!!) Thank you!

Rating: 3
Although it can't compare to authentic mole, it was a fairly good "westernized" shortcut. I only made 1-1/2 times the recipe for the sauce but doubling it would have been better. If I make it again I will use the dark meat of the chicken, or turkey, it's just a matter of preference. Green olives were nice. Mexican queso would melt better than monterey jack.

I have made this recipe twice, and I agree that it is well worth the time it takes to make. Followed advice from other reviewers to double the sauce and glad I did! Definately do not leave out the chocolate.

I've made this dish several times and find it much better than any enchiladas you can order in restaurants. The sauce is particulary good if you double the receipe and add a little extra chocolate. I also love the addition of olives to give it an excellan salty taste that accentuates the sweetness of the mole sauce.

This recipe was delicious, however I kept comparing it to one I often make that has dried chiles that I grind myself in the blender. The sauce for that recipe is to die for and the one in this recipe, although good, was not in the same category. For the amount of work this was I think I would make my other recipe.

These were just wonderful! I had my doubts about the sauce, but boy, was I pleased with the outcome. I poached three large chicken breasts in broth, and added a large can of chicken breast meat for good measure. It was plenty of meat, and certainly easier than boiling and deboning an entire chicken. Definitely use the chocolate and cinnamon for authentic taste, and mix the ingredients ahead of time. DOUBLE THE SAUCE RECIPE or you will be disappointed. I did, and had just the right amount for a single batch of enchiladas. Yum! Time consuming, but worth it for a big change of pace.

I have been searching for a good enchilada recipe for a while and this one really was just what I was looking for! My only recommendation for anyone who wants to try this recipe is to make more sauce than the recipe calls for. The sauce is very good and in the end I wanted more to pour over the enchiladas before baking. I would suggest either doubling the sauce or at least make 1 1/2 times what the recipe gives.

Rating: 3
This was a great dish, I will definitely make it for my Cinco de Mayo party. The dish does not need salt, the olives are plenty. Next time I might add a little more cinnamon and chocolate, which I guess would make the sauce a little more like mole.

This is some of the best chicken enchiladas we have had. I feed a family of finicky eaters and every one of them thought they were great. I tried the recipe exactly and it was great. I will probably make them a little spicier next time, but this recipe is definitely a keeper. I served it with the three-chili rice that everyone also loved.

Rating: 3
These enchiladas were very good however I found that the green olives were a little too salty for my taste and I am someone that normally salts my food. They are rather time consuming to make also. But all in all I would make them again and I did make them with the rice dish that is coupled with the enchiladas in the issue of Bon Appetite which was delicious. I also heated the tortillas in the microwave in a damp towel to soften rather than frying them.

This is the best enchilada recipe! The Mole sauce is outstanding so you will definitely want to double it. Try these and you WILL crave them.

This is excellent--the sauce is what makes this dish! I couldn't find 'hot Mexican-style chili powder', so I added a dash or two of cayenne, which gave it a little kick. Definately mix the filling ingredients--but remember to save a couple of cups of cheese to sprinkle on top. My husband says he would rather have black olives. Personally, I liked the green, but I guess its a matter of taste. We'll have this again, but I'll try every conceivable short-cut.

The flavors in this dish are wonderul!! The only change I would make the next time would be to use black olives instead of green. I only made half the number of enchiladas and kept the sauce the same, and was glad I did. Great with shredded lettuce, fresh tomatoes and sour cream.

excellent dish...enjoyed by my guests, even the finicky eater who says she doesn't like olives. i would also make more sauce next time b/c i would have liked to have had more in the chicken mixture...i ended up making more sauce after i had assembled them, and adding a bit to the dish and to top once cooked so it wouldn't be too dry. i saved myself a little work by buying cooked rotisserie chicken. i also may add something next time to make it a little spicy. as is though, it's terrific.

Wonderful, I brought it to a pot luck, got raves, and just got a phone call for the recipe. Definitely mix ingredients up first. I did half the batch with black beans and corn (both canned) instead of chix for the vegetarians and they liked it too. I had leftovers of both fillings and the next day mixed the chicken mix, beans and corn all together, and made up some more sauce and they were the best of all!!

This dish is a lot of work--but worth it. The sauce is delicious--both with and without the chocolate--I've made it both ways.

The suggestion for combining all ingredients for the filling is another good time saver.

These are time-consuming, but well worth the effort when you crave authentic Mexican flavor. Instead of the whole chicken, I used 4 pounds chicken breasts, which are easier to skin and bone and we also prefer white meat. I think you could successfully use boneless, skinless breasts in a pinch, but expect to sacrifice a little flavor. Heating the tortillas in the microwave saves time and fat. Otherwise, I wouldn't alter this recipe in any other way. It's fantastic.

I have made this recipe several times and think it is the best enchilada recipe I have ever made. DO NOT omit anything in this recipe!! The only thing I have done differently is not reduce the sauce as much. I like having the extra sauce. It is time consuming, but well worth the effort. Definately make the three chili rice as an accompaniment. This dish is OUTSTANDING. I cannot say enough good things about it.

Loved these as well. Very unique mole-type sauce for an enchilada. Cut down on the fat a bit by sauteeing the onions, etc. in the chix broth you have to add eventually (keep adding just a bit to keep pan and onions from scorching)anyway and by heating tortillas for 20 seconds in microwave between 2 damp paper towels. Would be inclined to add a bit more olives next time.

This was, without a doubt one of the best enchilada dishes I have ever had. Took a bit of time to make, but nice because it can be made ahead and heated right before serving. Do not substitute a thing....be sure to put the cinnamon and chocolate in. There is such a tiny bit, but that little bit honestly makes the difference between a so so recipe and, as I said, one of the best I've ever, ever made (and I cook a lot!) This is one of the few recipes I have ever given a 4 fork rating!

Delicious! Don't leave out the chocolate -- it gives the sauce a richness and a velvety texture. And don't skip the step of frying the tortillas or they will tear. If you want to save fat and calories, use spray oil or dip the tortillas in the sauce before filling them. Since I'm vegetarian, I substituted black beans for the chicken, and it was wonderful. I made the chicken version for my husband who also loved them.
