Ate hot. Very good, though didn't have quite enough asparagus. Left out the dill since dill ruins everything.

Very good as a cold dish.....I added more asparagus and more lemon juice than called for in the original recipe. Also next time i will peel the larger asparagus before cooking so that the soup is not stringy (it was a little stringy for me even after being pureed).

My dinner group recently had a 7 course Greek dinner that included this recipe and it was a big hit. I served it cold in a stem glass with garnish. It was easy to make and I made it the day before the party. I added more lemon and dill than called for. Very impressive for a party.
