I used store-bought Garam Masala and frozen corn, as it was winter. It came out gross! Unless you are willing to make the garam masala from scratch and to use fresh corn, avoid this recipe.

Have made this twice using Garam Masala that I had on hand. This is sooo good! Could eat the whole batch myself. Didn't think about cutting down on the butter. Might try that next time.

Like "nastysuprise" I used a Garam Masala I had on hand. I do want to try the one given here, it sounds wonderful but I was pressed for time. This was a hit, especially with the vegetarian at the table. I made a bit of a mess in my kitchen while "milking" the corn. I hated to waste the juice and the clean-up but I think it just goes with the territory. I will make this again.

This is so, so amazing! I had a very good Garam Masala on hand so it was even easier to prepare. What a fantastic flavor. My family who claimed not to be creamed corn fans were blown away. This one is so exceptional that I will definitely make it for company. I also used half the butter and didn't stir in any extra to the pan. I think it would have been too much. Sadly, I halved the recipe, everyone was disappointed there were no seconds!

I have never felt more compelled to write a review as I do for this one. The warming spice mixture combined with the sweetness of the corn makes for amazingly good comfort food. I made the full recipe and my husband and I nearly finished all of it- hard to stop eating it. The only variation I made was I used half the butter called for but then a splash of cream. I'm headed to the farm stand first thing tomorrow to buy more corn so I can make this again.
