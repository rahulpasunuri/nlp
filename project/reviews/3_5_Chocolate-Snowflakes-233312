I have made this recipe several times and it has always been consistently easy to work with and delicious. Rich chocolate taste needs nothing other than the dusting of confectioners' sugar.

This dough is a joy to work with -- very easy to roll out with little flour. I made these for winter solstice this year and alternated powdered sugar (sprinkle on right as you transfer to cooling rack) and baking some with sanding sugar using both small stars and snowflakes. Yummy and very pretty. Will become an annual event.

Simple recipe - easy dough to work with - sophisticated cookie. Keep them thin and small - you'll need to dust with confectioners sugar. If the sugar won't stay on, use more.

We've made this recipe for years and love it. One caveat: we only make it on clear, sunny days because high humidity can make the cookies tough. We also dust the cookies BEFORE we bake them to make the confectioner's sugar stick. As the cookies bake and swell, the sugar makes patterns like snowflakes on them.

These cookies turned out great and have a nice flavor. I cut them in stars, since I didn't have a snowflake cookie cutter. The powdered sugar does not stick. I wonder if I should have put it on while the cookies were still warm? After "powdering" a few and not liking the results, I decided to just pipe some white and pastel blue frosting dots on some and stripes on others. They look great.
