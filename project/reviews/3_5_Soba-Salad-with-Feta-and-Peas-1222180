Great, easy recipe. I used only a litle olive oil, added a bit of sesame oil, used mirin instead of sugar and ponzu instead of soy sauce. That made the dressing really light and savory. Definitely use edamame instead of peas...much higher protein content that way.

Great recipe. We upped the veggie content by adding some shelled edamame. I also had less soba noodles than called for, so it was more veggie than noodles. Very yummy. My husband LOVED it.

Great recipe! I made it completely without oil and used mirin instead of sugar for a more authentic flavour. I also added some left over salmon. Delicious!

Very tasty. I used less oil and will probably use even less next time, maybe about half. I added a chopped red pepper, which added a great flavor and color.

This has become one of my staple dishes. The flavors complement each other perfectly. I may try it with a little less oil the third time (already made it twice!)

Fantastic quick dinner. Also delicious.

This was easy to prepare, and pretty tasty. It can easily be varied to individual taste and ingredients at hand. I definitely will make this again. It's a good candidate for a brown bag lunch.

Though I found this dish to be ok, my children loved it! So, I will definitely be making it again.

To emilycorey from NC: Tried to find Nigella's version on her website and couldn't. Which cookbook is it from?

I thought the other reviewer was a bit too hard on this recipe. I liked it for a quick summer meal. It certainly can be altered to taste...less oil, a few other veggies. I found it fresh and tasty.

This was not a good soba noodle recipe. Way too much olive oil..and it just didn't go together well. Nigella Lawsons soba noodle recipe is amazing...try that instead.
