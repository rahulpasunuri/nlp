I really enjoyed this dish. I added Old Bay Seasoning in the water instead of salt. However, next time I think I will saute garlic with the zucchini, rosemary and tomatoes.

I found this recipe to be bland and lacking in flavour. I will use it again as a base, as I love shrimp, zucchini and tomatoes, but will add additional spices and some white wine.

This simple dish is loaded with pure fresh tastes. A great way to use the fresh tomatoes and zucchini that are so abundant in the summertime. Each flavor stands alone but also blends together well. I sauted the shrimp in the skillet with the tomatoes, zucchini and rosemary versus cooking it separately, and served the result over a bed of farfalle pasta. For those that can't live without garlic, adding 2 minced cloves during the sauteing process would work well.
