love this refreshing palate cleanser - definitely should use walnut oil - If I need a heavier salad I top it with a ground mixture of walnuts and blue cheese.

Left out the walnuts and used olive oil in place of the walnut oil. Also substituted coarse ground dijon instead of smooth. Delicious! A nice refreshing break from the rest of this menu which is very heavy.
