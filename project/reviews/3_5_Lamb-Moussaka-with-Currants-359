This dish was the biggest disappointment. It's a complete waste of a lot of money and time. The preparation from start to finish is about three hours. The delicious taste of lamb completely disappears in the tomato and white sauce. I certainly will not be making this again.

Amazing! My only edits were to double the cayenne and substitute an Ancho pepper for one of the green peppers, just to add some spice. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and it was phenomenal. It does take a long time to prepare - but it's totally worth it.

I love Greek food and I thought this would be fun to make and different for us. I made it and boy I knew it was going to be alot of work reading the reviews and I was right! I learned a few new things about eggplants - and I used ground lamb from the grocery store which has tons of fat so I just half browned it in a pan then added it to my pot and let some of the grease come out to about 3 tablespoons (i/o olive oil) and used the remaining fat in the lamb to saute my onions in - ended up with very little grease at the end - however - this did not fit in my 13x9 dish... unless it was about 2 in taller.. so I had to kind of dome the second layer so it wouldn't spill over during baking. Fantastic dish and will totally do to impress company!

Terrific flavor. I made a bunch of changes, though, to work with what I had and to try and avoid the problem some reviewers noted about the yogurt topping. I substituted water for the wine and skipped the tomato paste, and I used 3 large cubanelle peppers instead of the green peppers. Finally, I made the topping out of 1 cup yogurt, 1 cup feta cheese, and 3 eggs. This topping was really flavorful.

This was a perfect moussaka recipe. The eggplant slices weren't mushy because they were broiled instead of fried. Perfect solution to prevent mushy eggplant. And the currants and yogurt are a very good idea too. They add a kind of Middle Eastern touch. Try this one, you won't be disappointed!

to make the eggplant easy & tasty slice it lengthwise paint it w/ xvolive oil & grill it on your bbque - no need to salt,wipe etc.I'm Very busy but you can make this ahead in stages & the results are worth it -I add roasted sliced baby artichokes to mine & do the same w/ the potatoes- this keps well as all the ingredients are pre-cooked -to do a low fat version skip the custard & thicken w/ really good breadcrumbs - I bake bread for just this purpose !!!

This is a delicate dish, due to the lamb. I thought it was excellent, though, as noted, a bit time consuming. The next time I make it rather than broil the eggplant (which makes me nervous, since I have to watch!) I'll either fry it in half an inch of oil on the stove (my favorite way to prepare eggplant, and authetically mediterranean!) or bake(rather than broil) in the oven while sauteeing the peppers and meat. I do think its best to salt.Also, I would add more currants, at least 1/4 cup, maybe half a cup more.

Quite good. Like many reviewers, I recommend draining the lamb of fat before adding to the casserole. I also salted the eggplant slices and let them drain in a colander.

I have made this dish several times - everyone loves it. I did not salt the eggplant, and I did not use any of the oil called for - just some pam. Also blotted the cooked lamb really well to remove the fat. The only other change I made to the recipe is I used one can Italian diced tomatoes and one can crushed tomatoes. Otherwise followed the recipe as written and it is delicious.

Good recipe. I think it best to just salt eggplant before cooking.

I would not make this again b/c it is such a project, but for a one-time experiment it was fun to try! the lamb sauce has great flavor, though I thought it might burn (around the edges) after 30 min of cooking. So I took it out before the "bubbling" stage--so no grease to skim--so the grease bubbled up through the yogurt topping when that was baked. This was not an appealing look--I agree w/ the previous reviewer that you could try cooking the lamb separately and draining it of fat before adding to the rest of ingredients. Also, it's very filling, you can feed more than 8 if necessary!

I'm going to make this again. I used ground sirloin instead of lamb and the custard from the vegetable moussaka recipe on this site instead of the yogurt, I did make a few adjustments to the recipe. I used grated mizhitra instead of parmesan in the custard, I also used some coriander and cumin in the seasoning to give it the flavor of an excellent vegan moussaka we make at the restaurant I work at. Next time, I will use lamb. Served with a side of couscous with lemon and herbs (recipe from this site).

***Review #3: Made this yet again, this time with regular eggplant and without broiling them. The eggplant (sliced thin) was not fully cooked even after 1 1/2 hours in the oven. I think regular eggplant probably needs to be broiled first, but if you want to skip the broiling stage, then it's best to use Asian eggplant, since it's more tender and will cook thoroughly even without pre-broiling. **Review #2: Made this again. This time, I salted and blotted the sliced eggplant, but skipped the broiling stage. This saved a lot of time, with no appreciable difference in taste (less greasy too). Used the bechamel topping from the Shortcut Moussaka recipe, which was much tastier than the yogurt topping. The moussaka came out great and not watery at all. Just make sure to blot the eggplant really well or there'll be too much liquid in the final product. I placed the salted eggplant slices between layers of paper towels to soak up the water. BTW, I should mention that I made this both times with Asian eggplant.* Review #1: Delicious but time-consuming to prepare. As mentioned in other reviews, most of the work is in prepping the eggplant. I didn't use peppers at all, but instead increased the amount of eggplant to 3 1/2 lbs, with a thin layer of potatoes on the bottom. The other change was using just 1 28-oz can of tomato sauce. With these modifications, the ingredients filled a 13x9x2 baking dish to the top, with just enough room for the yogurt topping. BTW, the yogurt did not "softly set" after 15 minutes. Will make this again, but with the traditional bechamel topping next time.

a good foundation recipe. we love the currants! i bought boneless leg of lamb and ground it in my food processor, and the texture is much nicer that way. i used red peppers in place of green, which are too bitter for me in general. the eggplant and potatoes must be very thin! roast the eggplant until totally soft before assembling. i had to bake it longer before the potatoes were soft enough. also, don't bake the yogurt on top! dollop it cold onto the hot moussaka, it's so much better and more appetizing that way. buy greek yogurt if available; it's much better, but i like the traditional bechamel. a great dish!

This was the best moussaka I have ever tasted! As the other reviewers have noted, however, it is very labor intensive and time consuming. I used only one 28 oz. can of tomatoes (crushed) and found that it was plenty. I also used a turkey baster to extract some liquid that the lamb was giving off as it was sauteeing. I believe this helped the dish from becoming too runny. Does anyone out there have any ideas on how to cut back on the eggplant preparation time? Do you think if it was sliced thinly the dish could be made with raw eggplant? Thanks for any comments! Enjoy!

I think I may have sliced the eggplant too thin, and perhaps sprinkled too much salt on the eggplant as the dish was very very salty, which somewhat spoiled the taste of the dish. Will attempt again bearing the foregoing in mind, as I think this casserole is worth the effort.

very good. my only change would be to slice the eggplant thinner next time. the sauce is fabulous. i think i added a pinch of cloves and cinnamon as well.

I switched out a few ingredients and it came out great! Dry sherry for the red wine, ground turkey for the lamb, dried cranberries for the currants. This recipe was delicious, although time-consuming. But worth it for everyone! I would recommend purchasing the cooked eggplant from a local deli as that step took up a good portion of my time.

This was a great tasting recipe - my husband thought it was the best moussaka he had eaten because he said it was "lighter" and had more vegetables than the others he has tried at delis. I would have given this recipe four stars, except that it really took a lot of effort. Between making the dish and watching after two young boys, I was exhausted by dinnertime. But we now have plenty of great leftovers! (By the way, our boys would not touch the meal, which was disappointing. They really missed out.)

This is very good, the currents add a wonderful flavour. I would suggest, however, that the lamb be cooked first, thoroughly drained of fat, and set aside until vegetables are sauteed, at which point it should be added. Otherwise it is a bit greasy.

Time consuming but worth it!!! I made it the day before I served it and it was still outstanding.

Last months I had a dinner party of about 26 people. I was looking for something I could do ahead and that would be different and taste. Well I found this moussaka recipe and decided to try it. Just want to tell all you readers it was a great success. Everyone loved it and could not say enough good things about it. The only thing I will do again is cook the potatoes a little more next time. It was well worth the effort.

This is one of those dishes where you wish the leftovers would never quit. But they do by the very next day if you are lucky ! I didn't have any currants and it was still this good. I am emailing the recipe to my cooking buddy in Richmond VA this very minute.

This is one of the best recipes I have ever tried. Honestly I would describe it as "to die for". I make it for myself and a friend who was very familiar with Greek cuisine. She was amazed. It was wonderful as leftovers as well.

This was a great recipe with one exception. One tsp. of cayenne pepper is WAY too hot! I used 1/2 tsp. and it was still overpowering. I recommend 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper. I added cinnamon and more than a pinch of fresh nutmeg for a great flavor. The currants create a sweet and wonderful variation. Because my yogurt turned out to be spoiled, I substituted the custard topping from the vegetarian moussaka and it was delicious.

Yummy! I made this for a church dinner group to rave reviews. Like lasagne and similar casserole recipes, it's time consuming but worth it, and the currants add a lovely bit of sweetness to this classic.

i made this dish for easter, and while time-intensive (it helps to have a few friends help out), it was worth it. this is a no-holds barred, don't-skimp-on-the-fat kind of meal -- definitely good for a get-together. the combination of lamb and currants was an interesting one -- i had only had moussaka with beef before, but i felt the lamb added a touch of spice.
