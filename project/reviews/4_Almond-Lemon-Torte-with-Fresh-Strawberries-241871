made this for the first time this Passover - LOVED it. The mild taste and scent of citrus was wonderful. It was so easy and yummy that I'll probably make it again before next passover. I also used EVOO because that's all I had at home - I also used a bit more lemon juice and orange juice (which was orange/mango which was what I had on hand). I added about 2Tbps of lemon juice to the strawberries pureed in the blender and chilled it before serving (drizzled on top of each slice).

Amazing light, rich flavor. Also used EVOO. Thought the strawberries overpowered the torte. Would work great with flavored whip cream or a lightly flavored sorbet or ice cream.

I made this cake for Mother's Day Brunch - it was a hit! I followed the recipe to a tee, except used EVO. Deeeelishous!

This was excellent - I got rave reviews from my guests. Perfect for a Passover meal.

This was by far the best Passover dessert I have ever had! Everyone at our Seder LOVED it! The only change I made was to use EVOO. It was not a problem at all. I make other olive oil based cakes from this site and they all use EVOO. I was in the mood for a light, refreshing dessert and this fit the bill. It will now be my "go to" recipe for Passover as well as other times during the year, just substituting regular flour for the matzo meal. This recipe is outstanding!

This cake is fabulous. I've made it several times and it always comes out perfect. I have substituted amaretto cookies for the matzo meal which is a more perfect compliment to the almond flavoring.

My 11-year old baking student Yann made this cake a few hundred miles away from his mentor as part of a five week school project. It provided him with probably the greatest learning opportunities, after making some simpler batter before. To summarize the experience and evaluate the recipe I want to quote one of the beneficiaries of the cake, who had a watchful eye on the process: "Screwed up the egg- whites? Still delicious! Burned the bottom? Still wonderfully moist inside! A demanding recipe [for an 11-year old], but very forgiving indeed!"

It's a good thing I have lemon powder from King Arthur's flour. Really helped this. Agree with all about the texture. A very useful and recipe that can be the base for many a dessert.

4...4...4...4...4. From five different people! Used regular olive oil, didn't matter. Screwed up the order of mixing once, didn't matter. I prefer to chop the peel coarsely instead of zesting it because I love the orange gold flecks through the cake. Tastes the same either way. Amazing. Made it with pecans. Amazing. Made it properly. Amazing. It's fairly versatile. Forgot the orange? Ah well, use some lime. Forgot the lemon? Well, now it's not a lemon torte, is it? I wouldn't even call this a torte. It's a cake. A moist as heck cake. This cake makes all other cakes look dry - even fudge cakes. I really have no idea what makes this recipe Kid-Friendly except it's delicious and cake. But it's adult-friendly too. Sometimes I put pears on it. Other times I put stewed berries on it. Next time I think I'll pour liquor over it and hide it in the back of the fridge so I'm the only one who gets it.

I made this for a dinner party with lactose-intolerant guests, but I would make this again any time for anyone. Fabulous. Light and moist and flavorful. Presents very well, and not hard to make. I'll be making this again and again.

By the 6th day of passover this year I'd already made this twice and might make it again. It is such a great cake, I think it would be good for the rest of the year also. It's very moist, and gets better on the 2nd and third days.

Fabulous. Rave reviews from everyone at the Seder table. This cake is MOIST, favorful and most importantly will be made again next year. I followed the directions as written. The only modification was less sugar and a dash of vanilla extract in the puree.

I didn't try this, put I made to have a passover dessert for Easter dinner for quests observing Passover. Everyone loved it and my father in-law took what was left home, he thought it was the best passover dessert as well as just a very good, light dessert. This is one passover recipe I will not share so I can always be the Passover hero!

This has a great taste and moister texture than many passover cakes I've tasted. I think it was great for passover, and would taste much better with either a fresh raspberry sauce (instead of the strawberries) or good quality raspberry preserves..next time, I will use them instead!

Refreshingly light and moist, this cake was the perfect accompaniment to conclude the big Passover dinner. A huge hit w/ everyone, even the chocolate lovers! Accidentally used extra virgin olive oil, and still was delicious. Didn't have any problems w/ the egg whites-was sure to beat them as recipe indicated.

Nice and light yet moist even w/o the sauce. Makes good cupcakes, which take ~ 25 min to bake.

This was moist and delicious; a big hit with our Passover guests. Work fast after you add the sugar to the egg whites, though, or they'll quickly turn into a limp liquid. Also, it freezes well.

A huge hit, not a crumb left. I could not find mild olive oil, so used canola oil and macadamia nut oil, also I used vanilla sugar for the srawberry puree. Enjoy!
