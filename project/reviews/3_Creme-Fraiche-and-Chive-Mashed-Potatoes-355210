I forgot to mention I used salted butter.

This was simple and easy. I bought crème fraîche from Trader Joes, and it was delicious. My kids really liked it and it is a nice alternative to plain mashed potatoes.

They were ok. The flavor was subtle, but good. They turned out to be a bit soupy in texture however. I like my mashed potatoes nice and creamy, but this was a little too much so. I ended up putting them in a baking dish and baking them for 20 mins to firm up a bit, which did improve the texture. Overall, these weren't bad, but I would much prefer regular, homestyle mashed potatoes. If you want to try a new, gourmet mashed potatoes recipe, I would highly recommend another Epicurious recipe for Caramelized Shallot Mashed Potatoes. Significantly better!! http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/foo d/views/Caramelized-Shallot-Mashed- Potatoes-241649
