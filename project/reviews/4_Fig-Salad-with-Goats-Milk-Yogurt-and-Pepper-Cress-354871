I and my guests loved this salad. I couldn't find whole, fresh figs at Whole Foods, so I bought dried figs, sliced them into quarters and mixed them into the pile of watercress and mint leaves. Excellent flavor combinations!

Didn't go over well with the family. Found the dressing bland, too yogurty tasting, and no one liked the mint.

This is a wonderful salad! It gets rave reviews from company. I have not been able to get the pepper cress or Indonesian pepper, but it is delicious with watercress and whatever dried pepper I (lightly) add.

Excellent and beautiful to look at! I used arugula instead of cress and sprinkled the goat cheese over the salad rather than incorporating it into the dressing. Also left out the chili (since I was serving with Chipotle Lime Grilled Chicken - another keeper). I felt the olive oil was unnecessary and would leave it out next time.

Delicious! The flavors were varied, but they all came together deliciously. I sliced my figs into thin circles- it's my favorite way to serve them so they look pretty, but are easy to eat. To the comment below- you can figure out the nutritionals yourself. If you don't have basic knowledge about nutrition, then just search for caloric values online. Or just make sure to get low-fat dairy products and cut the amount of oil.

Where are the calories listed? How can you claim this is a healthy item when there are no nutritionals??

Very tasty, particularly the dressing. Did anyone peel their figs, or did you all just serve them as-is? I kept the skins on, and even though the figs were ripe and tiny, the prickly texture of the skin was a little off-putting.

Picking the leaves off the watercress takes some time. I didn't present it as they did in the photo. I used more dressing and cut the figs in quarters longwise. The figs need to be very ripe to give a sweetness. The salad dressing is really rich, so be careful how you apply it.

Exceptional salad, perfectly balanced sweetness of the figs, peppery greens, rich dressing, spicy oil, sea salt and pepper....just amazing. I did sub baby arugula for the pepper cress just because I couldn't get my hands on any cress, but I can't imagine it hurt anything. A serious keeper.

The sweetness of the dressing, figs and mint balances the bitterness of the watercress very nicely. Unfortunately it didn't look much like the picture, but who cares when it tastes so good. The dressing came out a bit thick and there was A LOT of watercress relatively speaking. Maybe not all bunches are made alike? I sprung for the fleur de sel and I think it was worth it.
