This shortbread was too "short" for my taste. The flavor was good, and the shortbread very tender and crumbly. However the combination of 1 cup butter and 1 cup ground pecans made the shortbread seem greasy to me.

My sister requests these cookies every year. The brown butter adds a new dimension to shortbread. BTW, these are also excellent substituting hazelnuts for the pecans. :)

I have done this recipe several times and each time to great acclaim. It is often asked for exclusively. I agree that leaving the dark milk fats in adds some character, and doesn't seem to be a detractor at all.

One of the best shortbreads I've ever made. The brown butter flavor is to die for. I rolled the dough out to 1/4", baked it and while it was hot, cut it with a round cookie cutter. Perfect.

Terrific flavor--big hit. I doubled the recipe, put all the dough into a jelly roll pan, and baked for something like an hour. Worked great, with the end result on the slightly thicker side (which I liked).

the browned butter fragrance is exceptional. I keep the thickness reasonable for shipping sturdiness. Next time I will try to darken the butter even further and keep the cooked milk fats in the recipe.

As one of my sons put it, "These cookies are fa- nominal!" Okay, so his spelling needs some work, but these shortbread bars are really delicious. I made them according to the recipe. I was a little worried when cutting them hot, because they started to crumble a little, but after they were fully cooled, they held together nicely. Served them with greek yogurt-summer berries-dried plums- and honey. Everyone loved it, but the cookies were the star of the show!

I decided to roll these out thinner than the recipe calls for and cut them with a cookie cutter. They tasted great but were way too fragile. I think I'll use the browned butter idea with a sturdier shortbread recipe.
