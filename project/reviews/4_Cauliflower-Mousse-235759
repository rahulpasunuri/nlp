Love the flavor and texture. Made according to recipe, except added 1/4 C cheese into the cauliflower mixture. Next time I may omit the nutmeg and try another savory herb. The prep is easy but the baking time is way off. I baked in 1 qt souffle dish, in the water bath in 375 oven for 20 mins, then reduced heat to 360, sprinkled some pecorino-romano cheese on top and continued baking about another 30 minutes. I skipped the 'invert the dish' step and served from the souffle dish. Before serving drizzled some white truffle oil -- that took the dish into nirvana land! Will definitely make again for family and friends.

Probably in the oven for an hour before the center firmed up and the sides pulled away. I inverted into a pie plate. Scary, but worked. The parmigiano reggiano browned beautifully. Next time I'll do this in a quiche pan, toss the reggiano on top and broil without the inversion theatrics.

A stunner, very impressive with little effort, really like a souffle. I added 3T os grated parmesean cheese. I subbed potatoes for 1/2 the cauliflower, and used 3 eggyolks + 2 egg whites lightly beaten MIXED in plus 2 egg whites beaten until medium stiff peaks, FOLDED in to help "hold up" the extra potato weight. The resulting texture was light and delicious.

Made this as a side dish on Christmas eve...It looked most impressive on the platter. I doubled the recipe and found that it had to cook for about an hour and a half before I was brave enough to invert it and hope for the best. It came out in one beautiful piece. Garnished the top with dried minced parsley. It was one of those things that looks a lot harder to create than it actually is. Will make again for a special dinner.

This worked beautifully, made in individual servings, instead of as a one quart mousse. Maybe that's why mine worked as well as it did. I left out the cheese, and served it as a side dish with duck braised in red wine. It was perfect. I had "goldenrod" caulflower, and the color was wonderful

yummy, lots of nutmeg thats for sure. A fun recipe to use up cauliflower. Took a while to gel though, kindof mushy - maybe cook for more time? In fact it never seemed to get firm

This is a very nice and unique dish and not too complicated to make. I'm personally not a big cauliflower fan so I'm going to try it next time with carrots or another veggie but my guests really loved it. It slices and presents beautifully. We devoured it and there were 4 of us so I'd reconsider the "serves 6". I garnished it with parsley and a bit of paprika to add some color since my platter was white as well as the mousse itself. All in all a great side dish.
