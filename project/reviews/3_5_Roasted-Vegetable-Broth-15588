The ratios in this recipe are what make it a winner. I liked the chard in the stock and also added golden beets for some extra sweetness. Great depth of flavor. This will be my std veggie stock recipe from now on.

Excellent vegetable broth, but next time I'll throw away the vegetables. They gave their all to the broth, and were not worth much. I usually avoid greens in my vegetable broth, as they tend to turn bitter. One cup of chard, though, is only about 3 leaves, so I used it.

For us non-vegetarians making this stock, you will miss that certain 'je ne sais quoi' that throwing in a chicken adds to a stock. That said, this is a very very good vegetable stock. The roasting of the vegetables is crucial to the stock developing a rich flavour that approximates a meat stock -- let the veggies develop crispy brown bits. If I were making this again, I wouldn't add the swiss chard. It overpowered some of the other more desirable flavours and made it taste very, how to describe?, green and vegetal. Also, I don't think I could use this on its own as the headnote suggests without reducing it down to 6 cups or even by half -- it's not flavourful enough to stand on its own, but as an ingredient for vegetarian-friendly soup, it's great.

Delicious! Make a double batch--it won't go to waste!

I made this recipe many times when it first appeared in magazine 10/98. We moved and I threw away the magazine and now I am so excited to find it on the websit...with Fall here, I was craving it. It freezes well and is rich engough for any soup that call for chicken broth.

This is a fabulous and easy recipe; I serve strained to start an otherwise rich meal. If you intend to strain it, you can just chop the veggies roughly, which cuts down on the labour. The leftover veggies are great chopped coarsely in a food processor and used as a ravioli stuffing. Yum!

This is the best vegetable broth that I have ever made; it makes an excellent base for Lentil Soup; I have made it several times and frozen it for later use.

Labor intensive, but the best vegetable broth I have ever had. Definitely recommend it!

This is easy and fun to make. I use it for all recipies that call for chicken broth. The question is what do you do with all the leftover veggies?

This broth was suprisingly rich. Roasting the vegetables makes all the difference. After straining, I'll add the vegetables to a Lentil Stew. I'll definitely be freezing some of this broth for later use.

This is good and pretty easy to make. The chopping takes up most of the time, but that is made easier with a food processor, of course. The leftover veggies were good to snack on, I found.

This recipe like so many others has too many hard to find ingredients. Not everyone lives in NY, LA or Chicago. KISS (you can be gourmet without saffron, crimini mushrooms, or wild bird nest.

This broth is easy to prepare and is very adaptable; you can add, subtract, or substitute veggies and it's still great! I use it as a substitute for chicken or beef broth in recipes when I'm eating meatless. Double the recipe and free it for later use, you'll be glad you did.

The first time I made this recipe, I was looking for a vegetable broth that would stand on its own when used in French onion soup...and I found it. The key was simmering the broth and reducing it by 1/3. Its full flavor supports the sweet caramelized onions while giving a suprisingly clean finish. I froze a couple of quarts and used it this spring for cream of asparagus soup...good stuff.

This broth recipe is superb. Although I did not have all the ingredients and added different veggies, the result was a terrific broth for furture uses.

This broth turned out so rich and flavorful, it tasted like chicken broth! Supremely easy, too. Make it, freeze it, use it.
