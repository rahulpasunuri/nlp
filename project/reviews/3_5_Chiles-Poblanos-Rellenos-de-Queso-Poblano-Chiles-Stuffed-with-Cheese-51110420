This was really time consuming, but really tasty! I have an electric stove, so couldn't roast the peppers over flame. I tried my kitchen torch that that was so slow it was a bust. Last resort was to broil them on the top rack of my oven. This wasn't great, as the taller part of the pepper near the stem was closer to the element and cooked/burned faster than the ends. So, I over cooked some them and had to toss a couple. The salvaged ones kind of shredded when I peeled them, so I had little faith that they would hold together when I stuffed and fried them. I was wrong! The batter and cheese actually kept the peppers together and the stuffing inside! I used Queso Fresco from the local Latino market, which worked great. Also, I think you could probably half the sauce - we have a lot of leftovers. All in all, really yummy, but next time I have a hankering I'll probably just go to a mexican restaurant.
