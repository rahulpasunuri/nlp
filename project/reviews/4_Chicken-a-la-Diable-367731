Delicious recipe but a bit dry, so serve with something saucy. NOT a diable recipe, just panned chicken. Have made several times, always with less flour, less salt, & added thyme/other spices to give it more taste. But a good recipe to use for cheaper chicken breasts as they turn out juicy.

no depth? I wouldn't say that ... though, to be fair, the flavor came out more the second day, when we had the cold chicken breasts with a small salad. there's plenty to this recipe, and it is quick and easy. I'll make it again, and it was top notch.

This was an easy recipe and the chicken came out juicy but I wouldn't make it again. The flavor didn't have any depth to it. So I'd find another recipe rather than fiddle with this one. (I think to have four forks and "would make it again" it should be top notch without altering the recipe.)

Pretty good except it's entirely too salty (1 serving has over 2300 mg...). Next time I will not add any salt in the recipe, and will double the amount of cayenne... there isn't much "diable" with the current level of cayenne! However the chicken was absolutely delicious otherwise and I will make this again, soon!!

Easy and delicious - perfect for a quick and healthy weeknight dinner. I used panko instead of fresh breadcrumbs and it came out great. The only change I'll make is to up the cayenne (or add Sriracha) next time to make it a bit spicier.

Excellent and perfectly tender and moist. My kids 12, 9, and 5 loved it. Used panko breadcrumbs instead. Would bring more heat if serving for adults.

Tasty! ...but nothing special. The cayenne gives a little kick but I didn't feel that the dijon added much flavor. The amount of flour (a full cup) was about twice too much; the other ingredients were just right. As another reviewer mentioned, I would be tempted to try making this again with something more - adding some more spices or garnishing with marinara.

This could not be any easier and is a great way to serve the ever popular chicken breast. I made it for a weekday dinner get together that involved kids and adults. It was very popular with both groups. An alternative to pounding your breast out is to slice the breast horizontally which is surprisingly easy as long as you have a good sharp knife. Another alternative is to see if your grocery store carries chicken breast that has been sliced "scallopine". The best compliment I got was, "It's like shake-n-bake." And I helped. :)

very simple and delicious for a quick meal. Used chicken tenders instead, and a cast iron skillet- which I think makes all the difference. crispy breading on the outside and juicy inside.

This came out wonderfully! We used store bought bread crumbs instead of fresh, but otherwise made it according to the recipe. Next time I'll put some thinly sliced ham on top and cover with melted provolone.
