I love this frittata. I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I used flour tortillas instead of corn (because that's what I had), chili powder instead of jalapeno cheese (because jalapeno cheese sounded weird to me and I had regular cheese at home), and added soyrizo. It required more stove and broiler time. It was delicious and super easy.

Made the recipe as printed and it was delicious. The tortillas were a nice touch; I've made plenty of frittatas over the years but it never occurred to me to put tortillas in them. Very tasty.

Loved it, very easy supper. Didn't have the tortillas but didn't miss them. Served this with sweet chili sauce. Yum!!!

I wanted a way to use up a couple ears of fresh corn, so I made this sans tortillas (didn't have them) and cilantro (hate the flavor). For others considering the same thing, I'd definitely use SOMETHING, if not cilantro--though the texture of this was good (I had to saute and broil longer than this says, though), the flavor was a little boring.

I doubled the recipe, and also added about 1/2 cup of diced red bell pepper, which I sauteed along with the chopped onion. I thought that the flavor and texture of the frittata was great, and will definitely make it again. The corn tortillas made it much more substantial than other frittatas that I have made.

Delicious! This is a good base recipe, you can do whatever you want to it, but the corn and cilantro are key!

Made this for my very picky husband and he really liked it. Used cheddar instead of pepper jack and added some red pepper and green chiles. Good, quick and easy. I was surprised at how much I liked the flavor of the eggs and corn together.

Great! Easy dinner.

Light, quick and easy! Increased the eggs to 6, added chopped tomato to the mixture and shredded chicken on top once in the skillet. Served it with avocado slices. Nice at room temp for brunch too.Yum!

Made this exactly like the recipe and it was de-lish! Be sure to thaw frozen corn as recipe says, before adding it. I neglected this point and had to increase cooking and broiling time.

Sauted onions with some garlic. Added some black beans & black olives. Only had some swiss & mozzerella. When serving, topped with sour cream & salsa.

Doubled and with frozen corn, the cooking time increased to 15 minutes on low, but it turned out great.

Easy, fast & delicious.

This was ridiculously easy! And so good; my corn was a few days old, so this was a desperation meal, but it tasted as sweet and crisp as the day it was picked. Perfect for a quick weekday meal with a fruit salad.

Made this for dinner last evening & it was delicious. I used fresh white sweet corn & sauteed it with the onion before adding the egg mixture. I didn't have cilantro or green pepper so I used a spicy McCormick Seasonall mix to add some pizazz & it was wonderful. Easy as well as good.

Great meal for a weeknight supper.

The nice thing about this recipe is that it is very flexible! I've made it several times, using whatever I've had on hand... different cheeses, adding veggies... I even used some chorizo one time, which was very good.

The funny thing about ratings on this site is that often people would make it again (or not) but it seems like hardly anyone actualy follows the recipe! Being totally guilty myself - I added some leftover olives, black beans and used cheddar and jalepenos instead of pepper jack. It was tasty, but I think the right cheese would add more kick.

I tripled this recipe for 6 people. Used 1 1/2 cups corn, 1 cup chopped fresh tomatoes and one cupe of black beans. It was delicious with enough left over for two more people. Also made the salad with orange-cumin vinagraite (found on this web site.)

A good use for leftover tortillas. Quick and yummy.

Very nice. I added maybe 1 or 1 1/2 cups of okra in the very beginning of sauteing (before the onion, since it takes longer to cook). The okra lent the fritatta a moister, almost buttery feel. I also added 2 chopped roasted jalapenos to the egg mixture since I used regular white cheddar, but I didn't get much jalapeno flavor. Next time I'll try using the jalapeno jack that the recipe calls for, or maybe mild green chiles? I didn't have corn tortillas so I crumbled 2 handfuls of blue corn tortilla chips -- it worked great.

I found this recipe by doing a search on eggs and tortillas, which I had, but was unable to follow it precisely because I had a different kind of cheese on hand (which worked great anyway) and flour tortillas rather than corn. I also ended up cooking it entirely on top of the stove, flipping it once so both top and bottom were crunchy. The kids gobbled it up!

This is a good formula for a quick meal. I tone it down some for my children, using plain shredded cheddar and a dash of chili powder instead of cilantro. My daughter loves cutting up the tortillas with scissors.

This recipe was very easy to prepare. I doubled it and cooked it in my 12" cast iron skillet, which worked great. I also added a little bit of spice to it. Otherwise it had good flavor.

Love this dish, quick and delicious for a light main dish. However to get there I use a whole can of cream corn (14oz) which makes the dish much more moist so I add maybe another tortilla to sop up the excess moisture.
