Nothing to write home about. The recipe was okay, but not something I'm going to make again. On the plus side, it was super easy to make. However, it was a bit dry and bland even with the addition of some of the reserved water and twice as much Parmesan cheese.

This went over really well! My only stray from the recipe was to add julienned patty pan zucchini at the same time as the tomatoes and wine. Next time might throw in a pinch of red pepper flakes and a bit more garlic, but otherwise this was quick and tasty!

Didn't use as much arugula and added shrimp as suggested by another reviewer (no parmesan). Results were just okay. On the fence about making it again.

I've been making this for years. Early on, the argula was too expensive to buy in this quantity. I used spinach instead, and my husband preferred it!

This is one of my all time favorite recipes! The combo of the sundried tomatoes and the arugula is fantastic. Serving the suggested sides is recommended. The tapenade and artichoke hearts complement the flavors perfectly. I love the quick and easy aspects too. Being able to purchase julienned sundried tomatoes, washed arugula, marinated artichoke hearts, bagged greens, & premade tapenade makes this effortless. Leftovers are delicious too.

This was delicious! I didn't have white wine so I used prosecco which was what I had. Also didn't put so much cheese. After 3 Tbsp, I found it was salty enough. Also found no need to add the 1/4 cup pasta liquid.

I followed this recipe exactly (including the salad and baguettes) and we loved it. It's light and flavorful and was just enough for two. I'd serve it to guests as well.

Was surprised, after reading the other reviews, that this did not work for me. The arugula taste was too strong (and I really like arugula!) and did not blend well with the sun dried tomatoes.

I love this dish and make it often. I use the sun-dried tomatoes in the herbed oil (oregano etc.) which makes all of the difference.

Try this with a half-pound of shrimp--wonderful! The secret is the oil from the sundried tomatoes. A great way to use up all that arugula from the garden!

It is simple but flavorful. Tangy arugula and sweet sun-dried tomatoes are good combination. It seems like a lot of arugula, but they do cook down quite a bit.

Extremely tasty and simple to prepare. Great summer meal!
