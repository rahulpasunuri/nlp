Ick - can you enter no forks? To be fair I am not wild about canned tuna, but I thought since there were so many good reviews that perhaps this redeemed it. Nope. My husband likes canned tuna and he thought it was just OK.

Quite tasty!! Love the mixture of the capers and the sun dried tomatoes with the tuna!! I added some freshly squeezed lemon juice and I also mixed the mustard into the tuna instead of spreading it on the tortilla.

So quick and easy. Light but still filling!

I made this because I had leftover sundried tomatoes and capers from making the "Pasta Salad with Mozzarella, Sundried Tomatoes and Olives" (another excellent epicurious recipe). I didn't have fresh parsley, so I substituted dried dill. It was a nice twist on tuna salad.

Great on a tortilla.

This is a nice healthy tuna salad, I used spinach wraps. I liked the non-traditional flavors and ingredients.
