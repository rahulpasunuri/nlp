Well, we loved it. I added another yolk, used oranges instead of tangerines and loved the recipe. Can't wait to make it again!

Good old Joy of Cooking (my edition is 1965) has the answer to runniness. Keep 1/4 cup sugar apart from the recipe and add slowly to the stiffly beaten egg whites, then fold in. The dessert holds together much better. (An oven thermometer is the best answwer to not burning the top.)

This was very light and the tangerine flavor was great. I used cooking spray instead of buttering the dish. However the sponge cake did shrink so it was just a thin skin over the custard and didn't have a good presentation. Don't make this for guests. Definetely serve it cold like traditional custard of flans and also so the custard will be set and not runny or mushy. I'll make this again because it's light and healthy.

The recipe was easy and the flavor was nice but the "custard" was runny. I baked it longer than 45 minutes because the custard had not set but then the cake started turning brown. The cake shrunk and deflated moments after removing it from the oven making it unpresentable for guests. Too bad it didn't work as I like the concept and I still have lots of tangerines.

I used what I had on hand, which was lemons; I used 1/3 cup lemon juice and 1 cup milk. It was light, tart and delicious, a nice blend of textures. Definitely serve it warm. I will make it again with lemons, and also try it with oranges or tangerines.

I found this to be refreshing and delicious...I substituted orange peel and orange juice since I did not have any tangerines on hand...and it was yummy and light...the custard was just the right consistency..i will definitely make this again as a summer dessert..:-)

The Cake was set, but the light custard part was quite runny. If you continue to cook the cake, the custard may/may not set-then sponge cake would be hard.
