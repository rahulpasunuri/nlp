Well, San Diego, that may be the most interesting review I've read. The question is, "how did it get 2 forks?"

I tried this recipe last night, had to search around for the ouzo and millet. To be honest, I didn't find it to be anything special, fairly tasteless. What taste it has is strangely like throw-up. Sorry for the bad analogy, but it's sadly true. I usually love the bon appetit/gourmet magazine recipes, but this one isn't a winner.

I cooked this last night with a few revisions.. I took out the Millet and added onion to the cast iron skillet before starting the shrimp and then cooked the shrimp on a healthy bed of onion. Finally, I sprinkled fresh mint and used Raki(Turkish alcohol) for the last flavor note. Delicious :)

This was excellent. I followed the recipe exactly (except I shelled the shrimp before cooking), using a small poblano for the green chile, and I wouldn't change a thing. I used a cheap anisette liqueur that came in a smaller bottle than ouzo (for cooking I don't think it makes such a difference) and the shrimp cooked in it were delicious: they held their flavor mixed in with the rest of the dish, and between the shrimp, feta, olives, and tomatoes, there was a perfect complexity. Plus this dish was ready in under 30 mins! A winner!!
