If your not the best baker (like me) this is a great recipe to try. It was simple enough, straightforward and I was able to get it in the oven in less than 15 minutes. Like others I substituted regular flour with baking powder and salt for the self rising and I used extra virgin olive oil...no funny taste or anything. It is a very bland basic cake, but I'm sure you could jazz it up!

Great recipe, very moist and light. I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the recipe, and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top just before baking. Once it came out, I mixed a T of butter with a T of honey and little bit of brown sugar, and melted it all together in the microwave for 15 seconds. I used this to glaze the top of the cake once it was cooled. I think this might add that extra flavor that some of the commentators complained about.

I made this at high altitude (5280 ft). I added an additional 1 T milk, used 1T less sugar, chopped the pears and tossed them in a bit of the flour before mixing in, and baked in a loaf pan for 40 minutes. It was delicious and moist, with a clean pear flavor. Delicious with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Found some sweet winter pears at the market---they were wonderful in this cake. I did decrease the sugar slightly and used whole wheat flour. It makes for a slightly more 'muffin-y' cake, but we like that. oh, also I doubled the recipe and made it in a sheet cake pan...6 servings wouldn't make it through the day around here.

I wanted to use a bunch of pears in a brunch dish, so I tried this. It was good, but I thought it quite a bit too sweet (that could depend a lot on the ripeness of the pears used, I guess). I also replaced 1/2 cup of the flour with cornmeal for a more "country" texture, and we really liked that. I also used extra virgin olive oil (I'm not sure why the recipe recommends to not - maybe it has more olive flavor? but I did not notice a negative impact in the cake), used fat-free milk, and replaced lemon zest with lemon juice because it's what I had. Lastly, this probably took an extra 10 minutes in the oven.

This was more like a breakfast cake than a dessert. We actually used extra virgin olive oil and it seemed to turn out well anyhow. We used less sugar (maybe 1/2 cup). We also followed other reviewers and made our own self rising flour (with half whole wheat and some extra flax seed meal thrown in.) I also sliced our pears in about 1/8 inch slices since they were less ripe. We also added 1 apple sliced thin & sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top. It was a nice not too sweet, full of fruit cake. Would be great to serve to weekend guests for brunch. I just realized that I left out the lemon peel since we didn't have any.

Boy, sometimes I wonder what the reviewers are talking about! This cake was so completely ordinary that I would just as soon not eat it as eat it. Plain, plain, plain. I did add cinnamon as some suggested and it didn't add much at all. I'll keep looking.

Easy and unique! I made two over the holidays, the first one was so tasty. A little cinnamon was a nice addition the second time around. Looks impressive too!

Great cake. Very clean flavors -- great pears are essential. I used turbinado sugar on top...followed the other reviewer's suggestions for DIY self-rising flour. I only used about half of the grated zest and I liked the lemon flavor more in the background. I found that the cake held up almost a day and was still nice and moist (although it does taste best warm).

Rating: 4
I thought this cake was absolutely wonderful and my family agrees. It seems from some of the other comments that the quality of the cake may be related to the quality of the pears. We had some delicious pears. We picked them the week before on a horse farm and let them ripen in the basement. They were slightly crunchy and very sweet. I used light olive oil and added about 2 t. baking powder and slightly less than 1 t. salt to my regular flour. I didn't worry about being exact with the rules of substitution for self-rising flour based on some of the comments from prior reviews. The results were yummy! I'm looking forward to trying it while it's warm next time! I may also experiment with adding a little cinnamon and/or orange, but then again, maybe not.

Rating: 4
Moist with a fine texture. I didn't have self-rising flour, so used all purpose with 1 1/2 t. baking powder and a dash of salt. Didn't have whole milk, but used whole milk yogurt, so I added 1/4 t. soda. Fabulous simple cake. I wonder if it would work with other fruit too?

Sounds great on paper, unfortunatly it resembled too much the flavor of paper. Not something I serve as a desert, more breakfast food then anything else.

I needed a good recipe to utilize an abundance of pears. This one caught my eye since it looked so simple. I cooked it in a 10" tart pan for 45 minutes. The top was golden brown, the middle was fully cooked. An excellent dessert. I'll pass the recipe around to family and friends.

Rating: 3
I thought the cake was very unusual and quite delicious. Two of the four people who I prepared it for thought it needed more flavor. They suggested cinnamon, perhaps some nutmeg. I would add a small amount to the pears before mixing everything together. Have made it with orange zest as well as the lemon zest. Both are very good. Enjoy!

This is a really delicious and simple cake. Perfect for those who don't really like sweets -- and easy on the cook! I didn't read the instructions correctly and threw all the ingredients into one bowl all at once. It still turned out great, guess it's foolproof.

The subtle flavour of the pears is really lost in this cake. Too much lemon. I make a similar one with cherries and it works very well. It certainly could not be easier though.

Very nice! Not too sweet--would make a good cake to serve with afternoon coffee or tea. Tastes best when warm.

This cake is fantastic. I had ripe bartlett pears that I had to use. This is the first time I make a cake using olive oil - I used regular olive oil as extra virgin would mask the pear flavor - the cake was light and tender.As the cake serves 6 and there are only 2 of us, I divided the remaining cake in 2 pieces, wrapped each in plastic wrap and froze them. I thawed the cake at room temp. a few hours with the top part uncovered - this cake froze very well! I did not invert the cake to serve, as the top looks very nice. Skim milk works well.

My mum loved this cake but for some reason I found it somewhat disappointing, although I added some Lemoncello to the batter to make it more zesty. However, I think I might give it another try substituting the pears for some other fruit and maybe adding raisins, because I have the feeling it might have just been that the pears I used were not very tasty in the first place.

Rating: 3
This was a great find! I made this recipe at our country house in France and used pears and fresh peaches. My family loved it. No problem with a soft center. I used a larger, oval shaped glass pan and baked it for 55 mins. Will make it again for sure. It fit in with the atmosphere here beautifully.

I just made tis cake and had to sample a piece while it was still warm. It's was AWESOME when warm, but not as incredible when it cooled. My wife and I both found it tasted/felt a little egg-ey in the end, even thought there are only two eggs in it. Would have rated this a full 4 fork if based on when warm, but only 3 forks once cool. It's very easy to make, looks and tastes great. The powdered sugar is optional for presentation, but not really necessary for taste. Note: 1) I used All-purpose flour with 3/4 tblsp baking powder and 1/4 tblsp salt... this is the equivalent to self-rising flour. 2) I accidentally baked my cake for 50 minutes instead of 40, and it was fine, although next time I'll try 45 min. I had no problem with center of the cake being partially uncooked as some reviewerts have complained.

Rating: 3
Interesting cake. Very Italian. Almost bread like in its texture. Like the other reviewer mentioned, it seemed as though the centre was not entirely cooked (a bit dense and doughy) but it was very tasty all the same. I did use extra virgin olive oil (all I had) and I understand now that the reason not to use it is because it gives it too much of an olive oil taste. I would make it again, its very good for people (like my husband) that do not like sugary, buttery cakes.

Rating: 3
Despite the fact that the center of the cake did not get sufficiently cooked (it was still delicious!!)everyone loved it and ate it before I could even dust it with powdered sugar!! I used skim milk because that's all we had, and canola oil because only had extra virgin olive oil and thought it would be too strong. Used a little less sugar and it was still plenty sweet, and also used (ripe) D'anjou pears --no problem there. Maybe it was the milk??? Anyway--the cake was so crusty and delicious, next time I'll double the recipe and use a 13"x 9" pan so we'll have some left to cool!!!

Just a comment, if you are looking for a breakfast cake that will hold well for days, check out "grandmother's apple cake" on this site. It is delicious and holds well; make sure to bake it the full 55-60 minutes so that the middle is done.

This was so easy! I was in a hurry and made the mistake of just throwing in regular flour. Silly me. It turned out all right though... not as fluffy as it should have been, but it still had a delicious taste and the texture of the pears was great. I will definitely make this again- this time with the right flour. :)

I had problems with the center not being done as well. It appeared to be done when I tested it with a toothpick. The flavor is good and it is easy, but I might look around for other recipes.

Well I just made this Cake this morning and it turned out wonderful. I didn't have self-rising flour so I did what the cook from Sheepshead Bay NY did. Plus, I didn't have whole milk. Never drink it. Had 1% and added a tablespoon of melted butter to it. Used a 9 inch springform pan sprayed with pam. Came out easy. Couldn't have turned out better.Oh and I used canned pears. Much easier.

Rating: 1
Well, I don't know what happened. I thought we had followed the recipe, but the center was not cooked and the outside was cooked about 60%. We were able to eat the outside, but even so found it somewhat bland. A sprinkling of sugar perked up the flavor. I might make it again out of pure stubborness because so many of the reviewers liked it.

Everyone enjoyed this cake very much. Used 2 Comice pears (that's all I had) and skim milk. It was a moist cake but not at all like bread pudding. Drizzled some caramel sauce over the top to serve. Delicious!

This is a very easy recipe to put together & so moist. Pears definitely should be ripe & softer. I shared it with a number of people and they all loved it. I sprinkled on a combo of sugar & cinnamon on the top instead of powered sugar. A nice light, moist coffee cake. Making it again tonight.

Rating: 2
Oh dear! Where did I go wrong ? I made this exactly as recipe states, with the exception of using 1% milk, rather than whole, as it was all I had. It turned out wet, soggy and bread-puddingy. The flavour was very nice when it was still warm, but by the time it had cooled, the awful texture overwhelmed everything else. I ended up throwing most of it away. And I'm a good cook! What happened?

Rating: 4
Agree with other reviewers. Outstanding! I also used an 8 inch round cake pan, and it looked great. Kept well for 2 days, then got soggy and didn't taste fresh. I used 4 fresh, ripe pears,which seemed like alot, but worked beautifully.

Rating: 4
Great recipe for covered dish, brunch, or any occasion. I never have any left the second day. Tips: 1. I have made it with canned pears and with half pears and half apricots. I like them both. I'm sure I'll try peaches one of these days. I used two 14 oz. cans drained well. 2. Skip the parchment paper if you want to simplify things -- spray Pam in a springform -- it comes out beautifully. I don't bother with all the turning and inverting either -- if you want to remove the cake from the bottom of the springform, loosen it with a knife and lift it right off. 3. I bake it a minute or two longer in an 8in pan because it is a bit higher and the slices are nicer than the 9in pan it calls for. 4. If using canned fruit, look for packed in natural juice rather than heavy syrup. You don't have to rinse the fruit and the cake isn't too sweet. 5. For the lemon peel, I peel off several strips of zest and mince it super-fine. Grating takes me longer and makes more of a mess of the lemon -- and sometimes my fingertips!

Very Good, Easy to make. I used fresh pears just ripe. Nice crunchy top. Did not keep well though. Needs to be eaten same day or next.

To cook from Montreal: To make self rising flour from regular, just measure off the 1 1/2 cups flour called for in the recipe; scoop out 3 tsp of flour and replace with 2 1/4 tsp of baking powder and 3/4 of salt. I did the calculations for you for this particular recipe, in future just remember that every cup of self rising flour contains 1 1/2 tsp of baking powder and 1/2 tsp of salt. This formula which Gagetown uses, is actually printed on the bake of a self-rising flour brand. Good luck!

Rating: 4
This was a real winner! Easy to make and presented beautifully when dusted with powdered sugar. I used canned pears (packed in juice, not heavy syrup) and this simplified the recipe quite a bit. For dessert, I served this with a bit of dulce de leche ice cream and our friends raved. Tomorrow, I'll warm up the left-overs and serve for breakfast(no ice cream this time!). Will definitely make this again, and next time I might try it with peaches.

While making the cake, I found out that I had no eggs so I soaked the sliced pears in a bowl of water to keep them from turning brown while I went to the store. Mayabe this is why but my cake had a consistency of bread pudding and I am wondering if this is what the recipe truly yields or if this should have burned out more like a cake. I would appreciate anyone responding. The flavor was good regardless and I will make this again.

Yum, yum, yum! I think it is the lemon zest that makes this cake so good. You can't get that flavor out of a box mix. This is definitely one I will make often. Easy and impressive. By the way, this is the first time I have ever seen olive oil listed as a dessert ingredient, but I always use the Bertolli 'Extra Light Tasting' olive oil in all desserts that I make calling for vegetable oil (because I just don't use regular vegetable oil for anything else so I stopped buying it) and this has always worked out fine.

Thank you Gagetown! While I can get the self rising flour here, I really didn't want another storage container in my cupboard for those few times I'd use it.

To respond to Quincy, I wouldn't have a problem with using canned pears (make sure you dry them on paper towels so the moisture content isn't screwed up). Every good cook needs space for short cuts!! I would not use extra-virgin olive oil unless you want it to taste strongly of olive oil. No opinion on the canola/veg oil since I haven't tested the recipe and don't know if a subtle olive oil flavor is desired.

Before I try this recipe I had a couple of questions. Can you use extra virgin olive oil or vegtable oil (not concerned with the fat content, just curious). Also how about canned pears (don't balk, just looking for some short cuts.)

Like the other "Cook from Glendale, CA" I also used unripened pears which did not give the recipe the justice it deserves. This quick, fresh dessert was devoured by my daughter and her family even with crunchy pears. I gave this three forks due to the good flavor and for it's simplicity; however, "delicious" is a bit overboard.

We love this cake. I made it 3 times already. It is very easy and because it is so full of pears and the fat is olive oil, it seems like a relatively 'healthy' dessert. I used a different kind of pear each time and it is always really good.

This would have been a tasty, easy cake if I had used ripe pears. The flavor of the lemon rind came right through. I will make this one again, avoiding the rock-hard pears (thinking they would soften in the baking process.)
