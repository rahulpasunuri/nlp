I've made this several times, and seriously, best mac and cheese ever! Use skim milk, use 2% mild cheddar (not sharp!), add a splash of tabasco. This stuff will absolutely positively NOT reheat--the sauce breaks, so I've made 1/2 and 1/4 recipes.

Rating: 4
I LOVED this! I followed the recipe as written (but added an extra cup of cheddar cheese - I used half extra-old, and half mild). The result is creamy, delicious goodness. The blue cheese is not overpowering - it is pretty subtle (I used Danish blue). I might put in a bit more blue cheese next time, but it was a good balance for my husband who doesn't really like blue cheese that much. I added a panko crust and it was fabulous :) To Username 1981 from California - the butter and flour needs to be heated because it is necessary for the sauce to thicken up properly. Cooking it for a minute helps take away any taste of raw flour. It does indeed turn into a goo, but that's why you add the milk slowly - so that you can whisk away the gooey consistency. The mixture is called a roux and is the base for several cream sauces.

There needs to be changes to this awesome mac and cheese. Butter & Flour: I don't know why it says to warm up the butter with flour because it becomes this weird floury goo. I'd add the butter, flour and cream/milk together. Gorgonzola cheese: That's what I used, but I used 8 ounces and if I used a pinch more would have been way too rich! And we love rich foods. Bread crumbs or similar is really a must because this is on rich mac and cheese. Other than these suggestions this was sooooo great!!!

Delicious recipe. I am a bleu cheese fan so bleu was a must. I also added Extra Sharp White Cheddar (this is amazing w crackers) and Mild Cheddar. To make it a bit more healthier (ahem, less guiltier) I used wheat flour instead. When served, I topped it off with green onions and it was simply marvelous. I made this as a side dish for Thanksgiving and it was devoured by the next morning.

I've made this several times, and each time its the best mac and cheese ever! I have a small household, and halving the recipe works well...I've never been able to reheat this recipe! If anyone has any hints on how to reheat leftovers, I'd appreciate them. Otherwise, you just have to eat it all in one sitting!

Easy enough, Added nutmeg and ground red pepper. It did the deed but will augment with dried tomatoes.

Rating: 3
I'm not sure why I had this problem, but two tries and I ended up with the same results when trying to quickly cook the flour in the melted butter: lumpy flour that would NOT have mixed in with the milk & cream at all. I ended up adding more butter and less flour to get a more pasty, thick consistency, which mixed well with the milk/cream. We used Amish blue and Vermont cheddar, but think I would go with a bit stronger blue next time. Also, don't forget panko on top!!!! It added such a nice light crunch-factor that would've been sorely missed!

SOOOOOO good. Buttered some panko and crusted the top, it was delicious. Next time I might do yellow onion before the roux, and add more bleu cheese or use a stronger one. Didn't use the chive.

Everyone that came round enjoyed this twist on a classic recipe. I also added mushrooms.

I also used Gruyere and used Gorgonzola - topped with some panko bread crumbs with more cheese - skipped the chives (got too wet and mushy) - I may have also been a little heavy handed with the cheese, but is there ever such a thing as too much cheese? excellent

Rating: 2
This was very easy to prepare, which I appreciated. I did substitute Gruyere and then used Whiskey Blue (very strong). I think the next time I prepare it I will either use a more subtle blue or lessen the amount (upping the other cheese). It was nice, but not something I would want regularly. Definitely the dominant dish on the table, flavor wise. Other than the Gruyere switch, I prepared everything as described, and it turned out well.

Rating: 4
Our very favorite mac and cheese. Used half gruyere and half Point Reyes blue. Subbed skim for whole milk, but did use cream and then upped the ante with a touch of truffle oil (it's Christmas after all). Topped with sliced toms and panko. A perfect foil for our roasted beef tenderlion.

When I first tried this at the Blue Onion years ago, I decided that it was the best mac and cheese ever! Years later, I got the recipe in Bon Appetit and it's the only mac I make now! I use Tillamook xtra sharp and Danish Blue and it turns out amazing every time. You can definitely use lower fat dairy with the same results. I've tried the many additions that other reviewers suggested but I always go back the the recipe 'as is'. Simple, decandent and delicious!

When I made this I added some extra butter in with the cream and milk and used extra blue cheese with a little less chedder. I found it rich and highly satisfying.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe several times with a few changes. I usually don't have whole milk or cream on hand so I sometimes make the cheese sauce with skimmed milk. The dish is less creamy that way but still delicious. I have used Danish Blue and Gorgonzola on different occasions. I always have a good English Extra Mature Cheddar on hand. I also add a 1/4 tsp smoked hot paprika to the sauce. Adds a nice kick and colour. I might try adding onions as well next time.

I made this recipe this weekend for a baby shower cookout. Everyone at the party said it was the most delicious mac and cheese they had ever had! It was unbelievably delicious! I added a bit more cheddar cheese and a bit mroe blue cheese than the recipe called for to make it super rich! It was delcious!

Rating: 3
Something that is failed to mention here - this recipe is mostly dependent on the type of cheese you use. Some types/brands of blue cheese are stronger than others, and those complaining of an overpowering blue cheese flavor might have chose the wrong kind to fit their palate. When I tried this recipe I thought the cheddar was overpowering, but that was my fault for not using a mild cheddar. It's all about blending flavors and balance, and will take a few tries before you discover the types of cheeses that you like the most. Also, I think that bread crumbs add a marvelous touch to the top layer. I also use green onions instead of chives as I find them to be much tastier.

This is very good when it's hot, however it dries out easily. Next time I will add chunks of tomatoes to give it the needed moisture. I did also use other reviewers tips and added bacon and carmelized onions. YUM

Delicious. I sauted a small, chopped onion with the butter before adding the flour and substituted evaporated and 2% milk for the cream and whole milk. Next time, I would add some tobasco. This is a great comfort dish on a cold day.

I have converted more blue cheese haters with this recipe than I could count. And that includes my husband who is now a blue cheese freak!

Loved this recipe, as did my family - even my fussy sister in law. I made 3 changes -I substituted gorgonzola for the blue cheese, added quite a few shots of tobasco (trust me - the flavours can take it) and added some bread crumbs on top when I baked it. One other suggestion I would make is to give the dish a few minutes to cool before serving the pasta. It tastes better very warm than it does when it is scalding hot. This recipe is highly recommended if you want a cheesy flavourful rich baked mac & cheese.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I've had the original at Blue Onion Bistro and while mine wasn't exactly as creamy, it was a close second. I used imported Gorgonzola, Wisconsin sharp Cheddar (cheeses from Trader Joe's) and whole milk. I didn't measure, just used what I thought looked right. Also sauteed a container of sliced button mushrooms in olive oil until crispy (to hold their shape) and caramelized a sliced Vidalia onion. Added to the mac & cheese. It was so yummy! Not sure why people had issues with reheating...I reheated mine for 2 days after, and it was still as creamy as when I first took it out of the oven.

I made this in an attempt to wean my kids off the dreaded mac'n cheese in a box. That was a resounding flop but my husband and I loved it! I had no chives so I substituted minced green onion.

I give this recipe only two forks simply based on following recipe. That said, I will definitely use this recipe again, only I will tone down the blue cheese and use a mild cheddar. If you do not like blue cheese (and I do, very much!), you will not like this recipe - the taste is very strong. The spiral tube pasta was perfect.

Great recipe. My wife hated blue cheese the first time she tasted it, but this recipes makes it subtle enough not to overpower her, but still around enough for me to enjoy it.

Rating: 3
Magnifique! This was my first time making macaroni and cheese, and it was just what I hoped it would be--creamy, decadent. I used gorgonzola and sharp cheddar, and skipped the chives as I had none. I put the dish under the broiler for a minute to crispen the top, and I'm glad for it. The blue cheese flavor was fairly subtle. The amount of sauce was just right. Since I make "comfort" (read: outrageously fattening) foods once in a blue moon, I didn't use any of the healthy shortcuts. Will make again for company next time.

Rating: 2
I was so excited to try this recipe--two of my favorites-- blue cheese and mac n cheese. And with all the positive reviews, I even signed this dish up for my office's upcoming holiday party. Unfortunately, I really didn't think it was great when I made it for a test run. The flavor was very good, but the texture of the sauce was very flour-y and distracting to the overall dish. I will probably try it again and mess around with it to see if I can get it to be better, but I will be looking for another dish to take to my office party. This just wasn't good enough.

WOULD I MAKE THIS AGAIN??? WOULD I MAKE THIS AGAIN???? :) This is my absolute fave M&C recipe EVER! My husband is not a huge blue cheese fan, so I have to switch off and make regular M&C w/ just cheddar every other time, but I always look forward to my turn :)

This was fabulous! My husband is a huge mac & cheese fan, so I make it for him from scratch a few times a month. Usually I just make it on the stove-top, though. This time I knew I had a bunch of baking I would be doing, so the oven would already be on, and I didn't want to have to tend to the pot on the stove, so I went looking for a baked recipe. Since he is also a bleu cheese fiend, I settled on this one. Usually the two of us can polish off an entire pound of macaroni and cheese in one sitting. This dish was so rich and flavorful that we didn't even manage to eat a quarter of it. This dish would be great for a dinner party. This does not even compare to the stove-top version I usually make. I had never realized how one-dimensional my stove-top mac & cheese was until last night. Baking the pasta in the cheese sauce means the flavor penetrates the pasta and makes it so much more flavorful. The changes I made were: I used penne instead of macaroni, omitted the chives altogether, and I mixed some Red Dragon (mustard seed) cheese with the cheddar. I didn't measure the cheeses, just eye-balled them, but I know I used a full 8 oz of bleu. I will most definitely be making this again. I think next time I may stir some crumbled bacon into this for an extra flavor kick. One word of caution - I tried baking this in an 8x8 dish, since my 9x13 was already occupied (it seemed to fit)... bad idea! The cheese sauce bubbled over and now I need to clean the inside of my oven. I think it was worth it though.

We really liked this. Adopted the carmelized onion recommendation, and used Berkshire blue cheese. I easily divided the recipe by 3, for 2 people- glad I did because leftovers didn't reheat well. Served with grilled lamb chops. Great combo. Easy to put together. Will certainly make again.

This is perhaps the very best macaroni and cheese recipe ever. So simple and so delicious that I was eating it out of the pan before it even made it to the oven. Also, the blue cheese does not predominate. It's just enough to give it an amazing flavour!

for some reason i think this would have been better if it wasn't baked. the noodles are already cooked and the sauce is ready. when you bake it for 25 minutes it just gets thick. i would rather have it more saucy. i had this with the grilled smothered pork chops, those were unbelievable.

I made this as the recipe says, but with table cream as store was out of whipping cream. Used Danish blue cheese. It was VERY rich - it really will serve 8 if you follow the recipe, unless you are an amazing eater. I would use lighter milk and skip the cream, perhaps. However myself I would just not bother with the recipe again; it was not worth the hassle compared to easy (and cheaper!) home-made baked macaroni with 'ordinary' cheeses. Perhaps I am getting out of my league with this sort of recipe, but I don't think so. Really the problem for me was this was too rich - if you want, try it, but I suggest using lighter liquids than recommended. The amount of sauce was right, in my opinion.

Phenomenal. I took the advice of other chefs and added caramelized onion--I truly think this helped make the dish as good as it was, adding more dimension to the flavors. This is RICH, (and I used skim milk, 1/2 and 1/2, and 2% cheddar). Not something to eat every day, but a wonderful variation of the original. Fantastic flavors. Corkscrew pasta worked perfectly with the sauce.

This was an amazing dish--I prepared it for my husband after we ate it at the restaurant in Seattle. I added 2 caramelized yellow onions which added a yummy sweet dimension. Next time I make it, I will add more onions and I think with the extra caramelized onions, it will be a four fork dish.

I thought this recipe was FABULOUS, as did my children, husband, and several guests.

This is excellent. Made with really large elbow macaroni and used Vermont white cheddar and Danish blue cheese. I used all 2% milk for the liquid and increased the flour a bit.

I thought this recipe was good, but not quite blue cheesey enough. I probably didn't use the best or strongest blue cheese at the market (pretty pricey) so that may have been the reason.

We eat regularly at the restaurant that supplied the recipe. They use gorgonzola cheese and I would recommend that highly. I was thrilled to be able to make it at home and it turned out perfectly, including the amount of sauce for the pasta. At the restaurant they use an unusually-shaped pasta that I can't find, but would suggest bow-tie as it's pretty close in shape and texture. Superb! Editing to say that the second time I made it I added some of the French's french fried onions on top. Talk about gilding the lily!

I made this but was not so stupid to use plastic pasta - I made fresh. I love the chives and agree use your choice of Blue Cheeses - but not Wisconsin - give me a break - they are fine for cheddar but haven't a clue about Blue (French or Danish only). I did get a bought of gas from the food but that could have been the whipping cream and the fact I had a couple of beers with it. My wife was turned on by the taste of the Macaroni so I suggest it for a romantic dinner. Good Luck Guys!

Macaroni and cheese has always been "comfort" food at our house and we love blue cheese so this recipe was a no-brainer!
