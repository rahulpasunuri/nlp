I changed it up. I sauteed onion,celery,carrot,parsnip. Then added the liquid and potatoes. Blended with an immersion blender. Added spices, thyme,white pepper,cayenne,ancho and smoked paprika. Used less than 4 oz of cheese and no cream

This is a good basic recipe, begging to be personalized. I used one large red potato, one large carrot, pinch of cumin, thyme, red pepper, bay leaf and lots of black pepper. I only used 3 cups of chicken broth because I added one can of creamed corn at the end when I added the corn kernels and mashed up the potato with the back of a spoon. It was very thick even though I used half and half.

Rating: 3
I thought this was really good, although it tasted more like potato soup with corn than traditional corn chowder. That is probably because I added two potatoes instead of one, but the extra potato made it thicker and therefore the 1/2 cup cream was unnecessary (I used a splash of half and half). I did not add the cumin since I'm not a fan, and instead spiced with garlic, cayenne, and s&p. The cheddar was a really nice touch.

Rating: 3
I added some diced serrano pepper with the onions, used an immersion blender to puree the soup a bit after adding the corn, and added cubed smoked turkey to make it a full meal. Garnish with some cilantro pistou or tomatillo salsa. I WOuld give this 3 1/2 forks but can't figure out how to add the 1/2 fork!

Wonderful soup! Held up great the next day--even thicker. Made it accdg to recipe, except added extra potato and a sliced carrot. It was plenty thick, contrary to other reviews. My kids were not enthused, but my husband and I enjoyed it very much. I'm not a huge cumin fan, but the funny thing is, the flavor really didn't jump out at me.

Rating: 3
This soup was super easy and really yummy. (I have never given anything 4 forks yet. I wish I could give 3.5!) I didn't really add anything, just changed amounts of things: Changes: 1 1/2 tsp cumin (per other reviews), 5 small red potatoes, not peeled, diced, 1 1/2 packages of frozen corn (16 oz bags), no flour, no butter. I think the extra corn and potato helped make it more chunky. I did use an immersion blender to thicken it up some more and added only about 1/4 cup cream. Added cheese separately per serving. I will definitely make this again.

Rating: 4
This was delicious. I made the recipe with these changes: added one cup of diced carrots with the onions; used three medium potatoes instead of one; used half and half instead of cream. I am surprised people are skimping on the cumin; I thought it added delicious flavor. The showder was thick and creamy. I will definitely make this again this winter, and I might try added the creamed corn as suggested by other reviewers.

Rating: 4
The whole family loved this soup! Left out the bacon (I'm a vegetarian) and used vegetable stock instead of chicken stock. Used leftover corn on the cob I'd cooked, cut off the cob and frozen from summer grilling season and added more corn than called for (probably about 16 oz.). Sauteed onion, then added cumin and corn, just to bring out more of the sweetness in the corn. Added flour and stock. After cooking a bit, so potato was soft, used the immersion blender to partially puree soup, then added cream and cheddar.

used fresh corn and extra potato. Excellent fall soup

Rating: 2
This soup was pretty good as is but it's a recipe that lends itself to additions so I did: I used half and half instead of cream, four red potatoes, and added one diced red bell pepper with the onion. I also halved the cumin and used a sharp New York cheddar. I would cook more than four slices of bacon if you like bacon. I did about 6.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe. I followed advice from others: added an additional potato; halved the cumin and added cayenne; add more bacon and a 16 oz bag of corn. Delicious!

Rating: 3
This is a good starter recipe but a little watery for a chowder and bland if you omit the bacon (as I did to reduce fat). It needs some doctoring. First, use only Yukon Gold potatoes. Cube 3-4 depending on size. Boil in just enough water and use this as your "stock" - meaning don't dump out the potato cooking water! The starch released by the potatoes will act as a natural thickener. Saute the onions in a different pan and add some minced garlic along with the cumin and flour. Add this to the potato "broth." You will already have the potato liquid so add enough chicken broth and chicken concentrate (love Trader Joe's Lo Sodium Broth packets for this) to get the consistency you want. I usually add some instant mashed potato flakes to thicken - this cuts the amount of cream and cheese you need at the end to finish. Also recommend adding some finely diced carrots that have been softened in the microwave for flavor/color. My last trick is to throw a bag of (cheap) frozen corn into the blender with some of the cooking liquid and add that to thicken and then add another bag of sweet young white corn as is to the soup. As a finishing touch, add the cream and cheese as needed but you will probably find that you need very little of these. Enjoy!

Made as written, except for omitting the bacon. It was very good and the husband also loved it. Not thick, as most chowders in restaurants tend to be, which to me is preferable.

I made it just as directed except with half and half instead of cream, so I cut down the stock just a touch. It was delicious and very easy. Though I didn't adore the texture, so I blended half of it and it was yummy! I will definitely add this to my cold weather hearty soup repetoire.

Rating: 4
Took the advice of several reviewers and this was great! Do not know what the original recipe would be like since I made so many changes. Used 6 slices of bacon and added it back in after the onion cooked. Added 3/4 cup diced red/yellow pepper and cooked with the onion. Added 1/4 tsp. of cayenne at the same time as the cumin. Added 1 cup of creamed corn and used a little less chicken broth. Doubled the potato. Turned out thick with good color and texture. Look forward to making it again.

Rating: 4
This is wonderful. I actually chopped the bacon and left it in instead of adding as a garnish. I will try next time to use green onion instead of regular. I also have made this previously and left the onions chopped a little larger this time. Gave it a bit more crunch without being overly strong.I always lighten the amount of cumin. Probably 1/2 and 1/2 would be a bit lighter. Also I would definitely use an entire bag of froen kernel corn.

Rating: 4
This soup is a winter staple for us. I skip the bacon and use veggie broth, skip the cream, usu. add an extra potato or two to thicken it. Sometimes I'll add a rib of celery and/or carrot to liven the color. If you live near Trader Joe's, the Celtic low-fat cheddar they sell has a great sharp taste -- you won't miss the fat. I also like cilantro in place of parsely. Would not skimp on the cumin. Lastly, I always prefer this blended with a hand blender.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I did make a few changes, I sauted the onion in a little olive oil and then added bacon pieces at the end. I used milk instead of cram since my husband can't eat super creamy items. You could definitely taste the cumin, but that didn't bother me. The consistency was perfect for me.

Rating: 3
Delicious but lightened it up some. Used olive oil and a touch of liquid smoke for the bacon, fat-free half and half for the heavy cream, and added some chicken I had left over. It was delicious, a keeper. Want to try it as written when we lose the vacation weight!

Rating: 3
Very yummy soup, though I did modify the recipe somewhat. Like other cooks, I used 6-7 pieces of bacon. I threw a little wine in the pan after frying to help deglaze; I also found that half an onion was plenty. The cumin was a bit much, so next time I'll use a little over a teaspoon of it. I'll also use half low-sodium and half regular broth, since the soup was a bit salty. Following the advice of other reviewers, I added a few dashes of cayenne, and that gave it a nice kick. Since I like my chowder thicker, I added a few dashes of cornstarch and used an immersion blender to puree the vegetables a little. This soup is savory, warming, and very filling-- great cold-weather food.

Rating: 3
Very good but next time I will double the corn and use 2 medium potatoes (50% more) for a more "chowder" than "soup" effect. Cumin was just right.

I thought this was bland without enough structure. I expect chowder to be hearty perhaps it needed more potato.

Fabulous, tasty, easy, cheap! My husband, who's from Minnesota, says it's the best corn chowder he's ever had. My only comment is that it's got a strange color - kind of grey/beige, I think from the cumin. But still wouldn't change a thing. Made it exactly as written (rare for me) and it was perfect.

This was a great chowder. I also sub'd the can of cream corn for 1 cup broth and veggie bacon for the real thing. Still delicious! The consistancy was not great but I'd definitely try again. Maybe less cheese next time?

Rating: 4
This is easy and incredibly satisfying chowder. Per suggestions, I replace 1 cup of broth with 1 can of cream corn and replace the bacon with sweet Italian sausage to add zip. A handful of leftover chopped spinach from the freezer added color, but a pinch of chopped green onions or chives would do the same with a little more zip. Great stuff!

A great hearty chowder! I add two minced cloves of garlic, a tablespoon of dried thyme and about a half cup of chopped carrots.

Good chowder, I changed it a bit for extra flavor. I added roasted garlic, and a few dashes of hot sauce for a bit of a kick. I also used fresh corn I had leftover that was roasted on the grill instead of frozen. Next time I will find a bread with roasted garlic in it. Paired well with a semillon/chardonnay I had.

Rating: 3
Very good, but had to make a few changes. I will omit the cheddar next time, as it really just congealed on my spoon, and didn't really add any flavor. I diced some red pepper and cooked that with onions. I also added the bacon while simmering and a bottle of IPA beer. It was a little thin, and next time, I will probably use a little corns starch to thickenen it up.

This was good and so easy & quick for a weeknight. We made it vegetarian with Morningstar Farms bacon (successful veggie sustitute in recipes to add smokey flavor, just saute in oil or butter) and vegetable broth. Used white cheddar but would definitely use yellow next time to add color. Our toddler liked it too!

Made this for some friends I was visiting and it was great (making it again soon!).

Delicious-to-the-max chowder! I did make a few changes: Used only fresh "peaches and cream" corn (so very sweet/yummy), home-made chicken stock, a 1 cup combo of whipping cream/half and half, increased bacon to 8 slices and put half into the soup, added 2 cloves minced garlic and a few dashes of cayenne, used extra-sharp old cheddar, doubled the amount of potatoes (Yukon Golds), was generous with fresh cracked pepper, garnished with more grated cheddar, the rest of the minced bacon and snipped chives. Served with a spinach salad and garlic toast, this chowder was simply outstanding! I think fresh corn really makes all the difference in this soup. Forget your low fat/low carb diet just once - make and enjoy this oh-so-rich and oh-so-tasty treat. For corn lovers, this is heaven in a bowl!

This was a ho-hum soup. I followed the instructions exactly and thought the cumin spices could have been halved. The soup was also missing in some other flavor but I couldn't quite place it. I expected a little thicker/chunkier soup since it was a chowder. Final rating - okay, but wouldn't make it again.

Double this recipe or you'll regret it tommorrow! I substituted one can of cream corn for one cup of the chicken broth. The potatoes take 10 min longer than stated, but this soup is a definate winner. Recently I made it with low sodium broth for my sister who has high blood pressure and the flavor was still great. I served it in bread bowls with a mixed greens salad. I'll try the red bell pepper next time.

I've served this a number of times to large groups and everyone loves it. To stretch the recipe a bit, I usually add a half-pound of Italian sweet sausage -- cooked -- and top it off with a dollop of the fab parsley/jalapeno puree from the July 1992 corn chowder recipe (which is tasteless/bland). The puree gives it that extra zip -- a perfect marriage.

I only used half the cheese, but to ensure it tasted cheesy we sprinkled some on top of each bowl. We did not miss a thing! It tasted sinfully rich

This is one of my favorite recipes from this site. I omit the bacon and use veggie broth because I'm vegetarian, and it's still quite tasty. I tried cutting down on the fat by using low-fat cheddar for half of the cheese and leaving out the half n' half. I don't recommend this route; it wasn't nearly as tasty. The sharper the cheddar, the better!

We had this last night when we hosted a pumpkin carving party. We served grilled sausages (andouille, and chicken w/ apple) and the Mixed Green Salad with Roquefort Vinaigrette (also from Epicurious). I made it a day in advance and followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of adding two potatoes instead of just one. I doubled it and did drain off ALOT of the bacon fat before proceeding with the butter/onion saute. For dessert we had pumpkin cheesecake (Epicurious). It was a perfect fall meal!

An excellent recipe for a cold winter's day! I'm not a big fan of cumin, so i decreased the amount to one teaspoon, and the dish came out wonderfully.

Wonderful soup for a cold day, very filling! However, I think the cumin is a little overpowering, I will probably halve it next time. I added a few teaspoons of coarse ground salt, and used an entire bag of frozen corn (16 oz) and thought it was just the right amount. I'm sure with fresh corn this would be amazing!

Delicious! I sauteed the bacon separately and used some of the rendered fat to saute onions. Additionally, I couldn't think of making this with anything but white shoepeg corn because it is so tender. I followed the advice of some other reviewers and cut down on the cumin (for others, not me), although I think it would be devine with all of it. I serve the cheddar on the side with the bacon and it's good with or without the garnishes. I am on the second time around for this and I cannot wait to serve it to my good "foodie" friend, as the first time was met with such rave reviews (I felt sorry for the other untouched soup!). What a find!

Despite all the suggestions to add more cream, I made this chowder exactly as directed in the recipe and was wonderfully surprised by the richness and creaminess of the soup.

Just delicious! I didn't have quite enough broth, so I added more heavy cream (3 cups broth, about 2 cups cream) and the soup was especially delicious! I halved the cumin, but didn't find it too spicy, so I will probably follow the recipe exactly as is next time. A perfect fall comfort food!

Based on the feedback I decided to try this recipe after I made some adaptions. My husband likes a substantial soup so I added 2 cups shredded chicken breast, used 6 red skin potatoes diced into cubes, 2 cups fresh green beans sliced into thirds, and about 1 1/2 cups diced red pepper. I at least doubled the amount of chicken stock and replaced all of the cream with 2 cans cream style corn. I added the green beans and red pepper just prior to serving and then topped with bacon crumbles and cheddar cheese. My husband has already started asking when I am going to make this again! WONDERFUL!

Yum! I followed the excellent suggestions of adding a diced red bell pepper and an extra potato and using my hand-held blender to puree the soup a bit after the potato was cooked. I omitted the bacon (we're vegetarians) and added a little water and more cream (!) to compensate for the additional ingredients - turned out just delicious and perfect for lunch on a cool fall day. My husband and I are looking forward to the leftovers for lunch again today! :) Next time I think I'll add a clove of garlic to the onions, or maybe a roasted poblano pepper... simple, comfort food - definitely a keeper!

Fantastic soup. Originally from Maine, I am addicted to chowders and am always looking for something new. This is one of my favorites. I do only add a dash of cumin, though. I feel that the amount called for is overpowering.

Only complaint: Too much cumin! I like the taste, but I felt that two teaspoons was one too much. I felt like I was eating Indian food. Otherwise, I took the advice of another poster and added an extra potato. I removed half of the potatoes when they were done cooking, and pureed the remaining in the soup, adding the rest of the potatoes afterward. It gives the soup a very nice texture. One thing that this soup almost screams for, is a dollop of brandy or sherry.

Excellent and easy to make even for a novice cook. Prepared the first time for a crock pot potluck style dinner for a group of about 20. Received rave reviews and several requests for the recipe!

This is a good corn chowder. I did make some changes such as fresh corn and chopped red peppers. I also used whole milk and buttermilk vs cream and no bacon grease to cut down on the fat. It was still very good. Also putting the cheese on the top before the bacon is a very good idea to enhance the flavor.

What a great soup recipe. My very fussy other half just loves it. Cumin adds such a nice flavor to this dish. I'll throw in some leftover roast chicken when I plan on serving this as a meal, and garnish with green onion. Try adding the cheddar to the hot soup at the table, to keep it from clumping at the bottom of your pot. Freezes well.

This was delicious. I didn't put any cumin in as it's not my favorite spice. I also put in slightly more potato than the recipe calls for and I used fat-free half-and-half instead of heavy cream.

Either way, this is a keeper.

It's very easy to cut the fat in this recipe. I love bacon, so I kept the bacon, but drain as much fat from the pan as possible. Omit the butter and cut the cheese to 6 oz. I also used fat free half and half. And I pureed some of the potatoes which added the rich texture of the soup. I also added green chilis for some added flavor. The cumin and green chilis added some nice mild spice and the chopped bacon added a mellow smokiness. My better half loved it and co-workers are asking for the recipe.

This was a wonderful soup. I omitted the bacon fat entirely, added red bell pepper, and slightly less cheese than called for. I also took some whole cumin seeds, roasted them a few minutes in a cast iron skillet, then ground them in my spice grinder. The freshness of the cumin added a fabulous undertone that really complemented the corn. Try it..it really is better than pre ground cumin, and not hard to do. I served this to my finicky husband, and he loved it, as did my guests. It gave us sustenance to get through the evening of absorbing the crisis that occured yesterday..the terrorist attacks.

Ditto the fat-free half & half for the heavy cream, and since I wanted this not quite so thick as chowders usually are, I skipped the flour. I used 2 c white wine and 2 c broth instead of all broth, but otherwise made it according to the recipe, and served it with a homemade wheat molasses bread. Really good, and fast enough for an "aah! it's wednesday night at 8pm and there's nothing in the house for dinner" dinner.

Pretty good, but although I like cumin and used less than called for, the flavor seemed out of place to me. Half-and-half, no butter, less bacon fat, and slightly less cheese worked fine, but I should have added green chilies or some herbs. I'd do that if I made it again.

My husband and I are trying to watch what we eat so I tried making a lighter version of this recipe by substituting the cream with milk, eliminating the butter, and putting in only about half the amount of cheese called for. It was delicious... perfect for a cold, rainy Sunday. Easy and delicious.

Wow! This soup is amazing! I made it entirely vegetarian with organic vegetable broth and no bacon and it was full of flavor. This is the type of soup that makes you want to lick the bowl.

Great Soup. Not everyone in my family likes cheese in their soup, so I served finely shredded cheddar on the side and it was a hit for one and all (a big accomplishment with two picky teens). The cumin seemed a strange spice for corn chowder at first but it mellowed beautifuly

Very good. I drained off all of the bacon fat except for about 2 Tbs. I think that was enough to add a nice flavor but cut out a little in the fat dept. Next time I may try it w/ whole milk instead of the cream.

We enjoyed the soup. Thought it was a little bland before adding the cheese, so also added some canned, diced green chilis. This definitely added a nice touch of flavor.

Very easy soup with nice flavor. Even my 2 young children liked it.

Made this for tonight's dinner & it really is easy & delicious. I wanted to cut down on the cheese (8 oz seemed way too much & I'm a cheese lover) so I tried using 4 oz initially. This wasn't enough so I went to 6 oz & this was great. I can't believe that another 2 oz would make it much better. I also used fat-free Chicken Stock, for health reasons, but would probably go for the regular stock for 'company' occasions. It just has more flavour. Great cold-weather comfort food & a recipe I'll use again & again.

I will definitely make this soup again, very easy! I didn't know what cumin was and from the reviews I was a little nervous but it was wonderful and I would not consider decreasing the amount. Also, I used skim milk instead of the cream and only had mild cheddar on hand. Next time I will have sharp cheddar for sure but this was delicious anyway!

This was quick to make and excellent. I substituted fat-free half & half for the cream and it worked great. This was very tasty and satisfying on a cold, rainy evening.

Both my husband and I liked this chowder alot, but both felt kind of ill afterwards, and again eating the leftovers a couple days later (which were great!). I think the culprit for our stomach discomfort was the bacon fat, which I'll pour out next time and use canola oil.

Lovely dish. Quite easy to prepare even on a week night. Even my picky 12 year old daughter enjoyed this dish. I would make this again.

I make this soup often. Be sure to use good sharp cheddar. The only thing I do different is I add a couple of shredded carrots. The cumin makes for a great flavor in this soup!

I really enjoyed this soup, but I think it would have been better if I used sharp cheddar as the recipe called for instead of mild cheddar which is what I had on hand. I will definitely make this again.

This soup is delicious and easy to prepare. I followed the recipe exactly and think it is just right.

This is fantastic - it's one of my boyfriend's favorite soups now. Very hearty & comforting, it can almost stand on its own for a meal, just add a salad and you're ready to go. I use skim milk instead of the cream, a canola oil spray instead of the butter, and low-fat cheese, and it's still incredibly rich and satisfying. I'm also mostly vegetarian, so I used vegetarian "bacon" instead of the real thing, and my guests never even noticed. Yummy!

Instead of bacon, I added leftover ham and it was delicious......very smokey flavor. Took others advice and didn't use as much cumin and regretted it. Will go for more next time.

Made this recipe for a winter soup supper/neighborhood party and it was delicious. I followed the recipe to a "T" and wouldn't change a thing.

This soup only tastes like cumin (and for my husband, that was not a good thing at all). The texture was very nice and it wasn't too heavy, but if I were to make it again, I'd dump the cumin and try something with a little heat.

Very good, but next time I'll use a less onion which tends to overpower the soup.

Rating: 4
I liked this soup very much. I used less cheese and only 1 t. of cumin, but the reduction in cheese had to do with a limited supply on hand and the decrease in cumin has to do with my husband not particularly liking this spice. This soup meets my cold weather criteria quite nicely.

This was *very* easy to make and a big hit -- big enough that we're going to make it again for Christmas dinner. The red pepper that some other "raters" added for color also added a little bit of spiciness; otherwise, I think it might have been a little bland.

We loved this soup. Next time I'll double the recipe. I omitted the bacon.

Made this for the first time for the office. Very good flavor, everyone seemed pleased, easy to make. Added a little crushed red pepper for coloring. Definitely will make again and again!

This is the first epicurious recipe that I have made and it was wonderful! I reduced the Cumin to one tablespoon and added more potatoes and corn. I will definitely make this again and again.

Great chowder recipe! The combination of the corn and the cheddar is really nice. A keeper.

My husband and I loved this chowder! It's definitely a keeper! What do you think, Lyn?

This is a great corn chowder. I have never put cheese into any I've made before, but it works. Usually I saute some red pepper with the onion to add color and sweetness. Fresh sweet corn is a real treat that you can enjoy all year if you boil it for a couple minutes, cut it off the cob and freeze it.

Excellent chowder! I made this twice, but the second time I added diced baked chicken and did not top with the bacon (just let my boyfriend eat it), I think it was a little better that way.

Absolutly incredible! So simple to make yet full of flavor. I used fresh ear corn. I added more cheese, corn, and potatoes than called for to add a little more body. My father, the self-proclaimed chowder-making king was speechless when he tried it!

I made this using day old corn. I cut it off the cob and par boiled it. This gave the chowder a nice crunch to it.I agree, the chowder is delicious the next day.What a hit again.

WE THOUGHT IT WAS VERY GOOD. I DID NOT ADD AS MUCH STOCK, AND ADDED MORE CREAM AND CHEESE THE SECOND TIME. A LITTLE GARLIC IN IT WAS ALSO GOOD.

This soup is a real family pleaser. My 16 year old son begs me to make this. To reduce the fat, I used evaporated skimmed milk and light sharp cheddar cheese, and 2 pieces of bacon. I also fried the bacon and left it in the pot. We thought the bacon flavor was more intense this way.

This soup was even more delicious the next day, all the flavors just melded together and it was the best! I added the 14 oz can of creamed corn to the recipe as advised by another reviewer, it was a definite hit.

I would absolutely make again. Delish and easy, easy. I will probably add some chopped fresh cilantro as a garnish and possibly a little more cheese. A definite "have again"

Made this recipe with a very rich chicken stock (homemade) which gave it extra depth. After tasting, added a 14oz. can of creamed corn....this gave the soup sweeter corn flavour than the frozen corn alone did. We ate it the first night but decided to finish up the leftovers 2 days later and that was when I decided I could make this again.
