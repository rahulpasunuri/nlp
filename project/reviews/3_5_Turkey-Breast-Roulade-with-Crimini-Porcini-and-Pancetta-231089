This was easy and tasty. I used dried mixed wild mushrooms as that was what I had on-hand, and I reconstituted them in chicken stock for extra flavor. My husband doesn't care for fennel seeds so I just left those out. I also added some fresh thyme and sage to the stuffing. I didn't have metal pins so just trussed it up with kitchen twine. It was slightly dry, which wasn't a huge surprise with the breast meat, but next time I may try brining it like I would with a whole turkey.

This is the best Thanksgiving recipe I've ever had. A couple of modifications: I brined the turkey breast first (I did another turkey roulade last year and it was too dry). This time it was very moist. I soaked the porcini in chicken stock for a richer flavor. Also, I used bacon instead of pancetta because my store was sold out of pancetta. Absolutely fantastic recipe and stunning on the plate. Festive and delicious.

Finished. Some things I learned: don't use canned bread crumbs. I had to augment my other crumbs with canned as I didn't have enough. It made the stuffing kind of gritty. Brine the breast. Even though I basted and buttered as directed, the meat dried out more than I would have liked. All in all it was a tasty anchor for our t-day meal and all that ate it enjoyed it. I'm a serial recipe maker so I don't tend to revisit things I've made unless they're extraordinary. As such, I probably won't make this dish again but that's not because it wasn't good... it just wasn't blow- your-socks-off awesome imho.

This was perfect for our Thanksgiving dinner for two, with the only complaint being that there isn't a lot left over. I didn't read any of the reviews until afterward, and made it almost exactly as written. I did use a Le Creuset French oven and it worked perfectly. The drippings and gravy were excellent. With 2 very simple sides - shredded brussel sprouts with scallion & lime, and baked acorn squash (butter and S&P only; no sugar, please!) this was a lovely meal. One comment on cooking I'll add: the recipe isn't too clear on this, but after making the roulade, it really should be chilled for at least an hour before browning.

I'm mid recipe. I didn't know how to de-bone a breast nor how to double butterfly. Had to search the interwebs. Would love to see that info linked from this recipe. Will update after completion. done for now.

This was fabulous. I made it pretty much exactly as it was written. I used a Le Crueset roaster instead of messing with foil, and remove the lid when the recipe called for removing the foil. I think it kept it extra moist. I will definitely make this again.

This was really good and easy. My family is filled with chefs and restaurant owners and we are food snobs! They loved it. I tripled the recipe for a family party of 35. I covered the rolls with bacon for add'l moisture and pulled it at 150 degrees. I had filling left over.

I've made this five years running, and it is the most simple yet elegant recipe I have ever found for turkey. It is wonderful for an intimate gathering (four or fewer) and one can do two of these for a gathering of up to eight. I have never used the fennel (I just don't like fennel) so I just up the amount of dried porcini to increase the intensity of flavors. This, along with my mom's brisket, has become a family mainstay. I always serve it with an Oregon pinot noir, and I always get rave reviews!

I've made this for the past three or four years-- it's my go-to recipe for a two-person Thanksgiving (though I think it'd be enough for three people easily, even with a 2.5 lb breast half). I've learned a lot the past few years; maybe this is stuff that's obvious to other people, but it sure wasn't to me. First, until this year, I used a big roasting pan for the turkey, but it was pretty thin, and the whole "browning" thing didn't work very well; everything just burned. And I never had any drippings/broth remaining when I was done. This year I finally got my cast iron skillet seasoned and ready, and it was SO much better. The browning worked perfectly (once I gave in and used most of the 2 Tbsp of oil), and at the end, I had plenty of liquid remaining for the gravy. For the stuffing: last year I was really disappointed because it didn't have that almost "meaty" consistency--it was just way too dry, even after adding twice the amount of liquid suggested. This year I pretty much ignored the suggested amount... I added a LOT of the mushroom soaking liquid (probably 2-3x), and then added a bunch of chicken broth as well. I don't have exact amounts, but I just kept adding broth until it had the right consistency. Also, the supermarket ran out of porcini mushrooms, so I used a mix of porcini, oyster, and chanterelle. I expected the turkey to take longer than the prescribed 45 min, based on other reviews, and I think it took a long time in previous years for me. But when I took the temp after the 45 min, it was somewhere around 175--way higher than I'd intended (the breast half was about 2.6 lbs). Ultimately, the turkey was a little drier than I'd have liked, but still delicious.

This was received with great praise and enthusiasm at Thanksgiving dinner this year. Many compliments on the stuffing and the moist turkey breast. Required a bit more prep than I'm usually willing to do but definitely worth it in the end.

So I made the recipe a second time with better results. First I pounded the breast a bit more and used a smaller (4 lb) breast. It was moist, lovely in the middle but still dry on the ends. I would suggest making this recipe with 2 small pieces so that it would be easier to roll to a consistent girth. My Thanksgiving guests are real foodies and they liked it too - so this is a keeper!

I'm only reviewing the turkey because I didn't make the stuffing. I used the fennel, prosciutto stuffing on this site. I did follow exactly the directions for cooking the turkey and it was delicious. We were only 3 for Thanksgiving and I didn't was to cook a whole turkey. This was perfect. I will definitely make this again.

I made this with a 5 lb breast and so doubled the recipe. The dish had to be cooked ahead of dinner as it was served at a celebration held at my friend's house. Although very tasty, it ended up a little too dry (even though I used a thermometer, took it out of the oven at a reading of 155 and let it rest). I made the gravy by mixing a roux in the pan and added in 6 or 8 quartered shallots that had roasted along side the bird as well as a healthy amount of thyme and some sherry. In the end, even the daintiest of dinner guest had seconds. Carving was kind of a nightmare and if one had an electric knife I think the presentation would benefit from it. I think that I would try this again but use less stuffing inside the roulade.

I made this recipe the day after Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit, even with people already sick of Turkey. I could not find just a breast of turkey, so I bought a whole bird and filleted the breast out myself. The double butterfly was very easy to do. Really, the hardest part of the whole recipe is getting the breast pounded out flat and rectangular. This had tons of rich, mushroomy flavor to it, and the gravy that was made from the pan drippings was delicious! Some of my guests for the evening are already requesting it again. This is now on my list of top main dish recipes.

I am about to make this for Thanksgiving but was able to get only 5-7 lb breast. Any estimation on cooking time? Should I double amounts of stuffing?

I make this exactly as the recipe directs except for the skin. Wrapping it in prosciutto sounds good though. Don't really need the lacing pins. If you need help holding it together while you roll it, use toothpicks.

I made three roulades for "feasts" on two consecutive days. Prepped one day (prep is laborious), cooked the next. The butcher "butchered" the butterfly, so I might do it myself next time. Needed much more broth than recommended during roasting, and more time to cook. Lovely presentation, rich-tasting, a bit pricy, and far from "everyday" food. Best gravy EVER.

Made this dish for Turkey Day and it is excellent! I particularly liked the stuffing. Due to grocers shortage I used proscuitto vice pancetta, and it was pretty good, although bacon would be a better replacement.

This was delicious. I made the recipe about how it is stated (most unusual) and it was a big hit. I butterflied the turkey myself and it wasn't that difficult. It came out really well. One of my guests actually took my stained printed recipe to give to someone else.

I made this last night and it was very good even though I did a poor job butterflying the turkey breast. All I could get was a bone on one so I had to do it all myself. I will use less fresh rosemary next time as I thought the flavor was too strong in the stuffing. I also used thyme instead of fennel seed as we don't care for fennel seed. Although I had less than 2 3/4 lb trukey breast it took longer than 45 minutes to cook, more like 1 hr. 10 minutes. The gravy was also very good and easy although I cooked the butter and flour in the pan rather than kneeding it together. My 14 year old son who doesn't like stuffing said " Make this stuffing for the turkey at Thanksgiving this year."

very tasty, a nice presentation. I had a hard time getting it pounded to 1/2", i'm not sure if the butcher didn't 'double butterfly' it right, or if i'm not a good pounder, but it would have looked better if it had been pounded evenly. also, my turkey breast was larger than the recipe, so i was uncertain as to how long to cook it. I put a thermometer in it and cooked it to 168 degrees, i might do 164 degrees next time.

I made this dish for the second time this Thanksgiving, and it was just as delicious as I remembered from last Christmas. One question... It took considerably longer to cook than the recipe states - Almost 90 minutes. I did make it ahead and refrigerate, but it sat out for a solid half hour before going into the oven. Should I have used convection? Not made it ahead at all? Any suggestions?

Excellent! I'll never do a whole bird again. Also loved the stuffing. I generally don't like turkey so I used a terriaki marinated (store bought) breast tenderloin. It turned out great.

I varied the recipe by wrapping the finished roll in prosciuto before its initial browning. The result was an absolutely marvelous preparation that induced a taste memory lasting days.

Doh! What I meant was you can make this skinless. I wrote 'boneless'instead. And to clarify, I didn't use the metal skewers at all, just twine, and that worked out ok.

I made this omitting the fennel as I don't like it, and adding in some dried morels that I also had from a trip to France. You could also substitute smoky bacon for the pancetta for a stronger flavor. As a chef, I knew what was meant by double butterfly but if you don't, other people have addressed this in reviews. (It just means to cut two flaps to extend it into a rectangular-ish piece.) I also used twine, not skewers to secure it. Be sure to let it rest adequately before carving. I didn't make the gravy called for but opted for a more traditional roux-based gravy using homemade turkey stock. This recipe easily serves six people, but could probably extend to eight depending on the size of breast. You should plan about 1/2 pound of meat per person when it's stuffed. You can also make this boneless, just be sure to baste it more, or brine it first. A chef from New Jersey wrote that her guests suffered gastrointestinal problems after serving this dish, but as a culinary professional, I can assure you there's nothing wrong with this recipe. But just remember that anytime you cook poultry, you need to be rigorous about sanitation and assure your meat is cooked thoroughly.

QUESTION: I try not to totally change recipes but i wanted to know whether any of you cooks thought I could substitute the mushroom stuffing with any anothers. Not that it doesn't sound great but I had my mind on wild rice, cranberry, and pine nut stuffing. Think this would work?

My family LOVES this turkey dish. We have a huge crowd on Thanksgiving so instead served this for a small group earlier in the month. I've also used the same method/stuffing for chicken with success. I felt I needed to respond after seeing the comment from Del Mar, CA. The recipe calls for 1 TWO and 3/4 pound breast, and not a 12 and 3/4 pound breast that I agree would be impossible to find. The magazine is quite clear, but the way that the recipe is listed on Epicurious it's confusing.

Rating: 3
the combo of flavors was wonderful, but the proportions given were out of sync. firstly, i dare you to find a 12 3/4 lb half turkey breast. I used an 8 3/4 lb whole breast and did not have enough stuffing. as for the sauce..the ingreds given seemed lackluster so we added more porcini juices and about a cup to a cup 1/2 of cognac, and some golden raisins a few minutes before serving. we omitted chix broth as well as chix broths vary so much and can be very salty and onion-y unless homemade. someone needs to re-think these amounts and rewrite. i had to call my brother who is a professional chef to come over and check them out and he thought as i did that there was some mistake. when someone finds a turkey big enough to have a 12 3/4 lb half breast, let me know.

I love to do a turkey roulade for an intimate Thanksgiving dinner. The mushrooms in this one are sure to make it a favorite. For all who are unsure how to double butterfly a turkey breast, it's easy. Just make a cut 1/3 of the way through the breast and open it up. Then on the thicker side make a cut from the inside out. opening basically like a 3 folded letter. It works try it. You'll like it.

Double-butterfly???? It seems everyone, including the butcher, was confused by this one. This recipe was easy, even without the "triangle" shaped turkey breast, but not worth the trouble for someone who is not crazy about fennel. I even halved the amount called for and it still overwhelmed the other flavors in the stuffing mixture! In addition, the turkey took much longer to cook than indicated. Note to disgusting NJ cook - next time, don't serve turkey if you don't know how to read a meat thermometer!!

This was simply delicious for our Thanksgiving dinner. It is always a problem to find something suitable for 2 people and this was perfect. We ended up freezing half (after roasting, of course) and still have enough for a weekend of leftovers. I did use the butcher to bone out the breast, Neither he nor anyone else had any idea what double butterfly meant. So I just followed the recipe with the solid boned breast. It turned out fine.

I made this as part of the entire small and elegant menu in this issue. All excellent. This recipe was easy to make. The double butterfly I did was inelegant, but when tied with twine, it held its shape better than most pork roasts I've treated the same way. We did brine the breast in advance. I'm not sure we needed to because it's cooked covered through most of the receipt. Very nice presentation.

The stuffing was good, but the recipe was more trouble than it was worth. If I were to make it again I would make the stuffing separately, for a regular turkey breast that I cooked according to a tried and true recipe. The time investment would be fractional, and the result would be similar.

To Miat3 it is easy to double butterfly a turkey breast. You make your first cut about 1/3 of the way of the breast thickness horrizontally. Then open it up. On the thicker portion you then make another cut from the inside out half way through and open it up. think of a piece of paper folded 3 ways into and envelope and how you would unfold it. I love rolled stuffed turkey breasts. To the cook from NJ you are disgusting.
