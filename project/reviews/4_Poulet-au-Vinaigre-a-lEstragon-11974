I always read people's reviews, but I never write in. I am someone who rarely makes the same meal twice. This recipe was so bad that we couldn't eat it. Fortunately, the dog likes it.

Agree with Ottawa that the aroma and amount of vinegar unnerved me, but really liked the flavors together. Used only four boneless, skinless chicken thigh pieces on the first try in case we didn't like the sauce. Meat was nice and tender and the flavor of the sauce rocked.

What a delicious surprise this dish turned out to be! The vinegar seemed to make the difference from other tomato and chicken dishes we've tried. We served the chicken over elbow macaroni which we cooked for 10 minutes, longer than the recommended time,but perfect for this dish! Thanks to the reviewer who suggested frozen onions - worked out well!

I have made this recipe many times in the past, and am delighted to find it again. It is absolutely one of my favourite chicken dishes ever. I've always had raves about it.

This was a delicious tangy recipe. I wouldn't say it's my favorite chicken recipe ever, but it's certainly one I'll recommend.

Wonderfully complex flavor for so few ingredients. Subsituting frozen pearl onions will streamline things - just thaw and add when the blanched onions would be added. Also, I had to make my own tarragon vinegar: I steeped tarragon sprigs in champagne vinegar for 4 hours and the tarragon flavor was clean and clear. I served this with pommes anna and haricots vert. A white burgundy held its own against the acidity of the vinegar.

A fantastic recipe. The sauce was outstanding.

When I first made this recipe, the smell of vinegar that penetrated the house as I was boiling down the sauce made me doubt the flavour. However, it was well worth it. The sweet and punget flavour of the sauce is wonderful! I made it for a family gathering and every piece was eaten.

I saved this whole menu and prepared the whole thing-very classic French-potage san germain, the chicken, pommes anna and haricots verts, followed by a frisee & baby arugula salad with roquefort toasts. This is a great do ahead dish-excellent. I only wish you could retrive past menus as they appeared in Gourmet.
