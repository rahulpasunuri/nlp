The combo of butternut squash and red grapes roasted together is VERY good. I used what I had in my kitchen which meant I tossed the squash and grapes with EVOO, S & P and roasted for about 20 min. @ 450. Sprinkled chopped toasted walnuts on before serving. Loved it! I was just looking for the correct temperature to roast the squash when I saw this recipe. Guess I kind of made it my own but so glad to have stumbled uponthe squash/grape combo.

Great success! My husband and I really enjoyed this: it was easy, tasty, healthy (I did cut down on the butter/oil, but I didn't miss the extra fats). The grapes were a great addition. Will appear on out table a number of times this fall!

This was a crowd pleaser at my holiday dinner. I used leeks (as suggested) and cut down on the butter and oil. I also did not use the pine nuts. It was delicious!

This is a tremendously tasty preparation for butternut squash. The sweetness of the roasted grapes melds beautifully with the squash and sage. A real keeper for a Fall recipe

I've never written a review before, but this recipe was so easy and delicious, I decided to take time. Who would have thought grapes would taste so GOOD with squash? I followed recipe exactly, but skipped the pine nuts and followed others' suggestions to just cook 30 minutes. Next time, I think I'll omit the butter and add more sage. Yum!!

Whoops - I just realized I forgot the onions! I used rubbed sage -- as I did not have any fresh;and had only about-to-go bad black seedless grapes. It took about 25 minutes of roasting to prepare for two (I halved the recipe amounts). Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it was a HUGE success with my husband who is not too fond of squash. This is a winner!

Super yummy. I did not use the nuts and I recommend that if you use a larger squash to cook longer than suggested. It took a little longer to get the onions brown. Also I doubled the sage. Will make over and over.

Who would have thought squash and grapes could compliment each other so? I cut out the butter totally just mixed the oil with the vegetables. I also added about 1 leek which really added alot of flavor. I am so happy I found this receipe. Eash, delish and good for you too!

I made this recipe exactly as written. It was awesome (and I'm not a huge fan of squash OR fruit in savory dishes). I will make this again and again. And everyone at work asked for the recipe.

This recipe was easy to prepare with minimal effort. The end result was really tasty. The pine nuts provide a nice depth, and the grapes add a nice sweetness. YUMMY

Terrific recipe! A great way to get little ones to eat a vegetable other than peas or carrots. Would definitely agree that cook time should be between 30 and 35 minutes. Would absolutely make again!

The best butternut squash recipe I have ever had. I didn't have the grapes, and I roasted the pine nuts with the rest of the ingriedients. Next time I might add more sage and less butter. Great combo of flavors celebrating the fall.

what a delight to have grapes in the mix of things...a nice treat..easy beyond belief...i served with lamb, but can see loin of pork as well, the grapes are a must to offer texture and an unexpected treat...a departure from raisins.....so easy and tasty at that.

I have made this 3 times in the past 3 weeks and on Thanksgiving. What a hit! It is so easy and a wonderful blend of flavors. I upped the sage 2x and lots of black pepper. didn't use pine nuts and still wonderful. The grapes are a new and unique twist for a hint of extra sweetness. 50 min is way too long. they are done in about 30-35 min.

This dish was a lot of fun for me - a self-proclaimed "lousy cook". I was proud of myself for making it and of my family for trying something sooo different. My kids said, "it is ok, but I don't think we would CHOOSE to eat it again." I liked it and would love to make it again in a smaller batch for company.

I have made this recipe three times in 3 weeks but have opted to start using a little more sage than suggested. We love it and it is good heated up in the microwave the next day as well. Easy to make, good for beginners or bachelors to impress somebody special.

Very, very good. I think much flavor comes from the butter (with which I seldom indulge). Like others, I used more sage, probably 1 1/2 tablespoons, and it still could have been more. I checked a couple of times and took the dish out when the squash was very soft, I don't know how long that was, but certainly less than 50 minutes. For those of you that are adding syrup, that is a very, very different dish than this savory sage flavored dish. This dish highlights the naturally complex, MILDLY sweet, flavor of the squash Nothing masks the flavor or makes it cloyingly sweet.

This was very good. I strayed a bit and didn't use the grapes (didn't have any) but added about 2 Tablepsoons pure maple syrup. Delicious!

Delicious combination, I will definitely make again. I agree with those who recommend roasting only 30 min, as I thought at 50 min the grapes lost too much color/texture. Also, I would add more fresh sage, maybe 2T to roasting pan, or some additional before serving.

Awesome. I was out of fresh sage so I used some fresh thyme and a bit of ground sage. Raves from my husband who hates squash.

Excellent recipe! I would shorten the cooking time by 10 minutes and toss in some calamata olives for the last 10 minutes and maybe some fresh Feta cheese. I'm making the dish for a group of 20 this weekend to go with a slow roasted chicken cookout.

I've made this twice. The first time, I followed the directions and felt that 50 minutes was too much cooking time as the dish lost its texture, but the flavor was good. The second time I made it, I was in a hurry so I preheated a cast iron pan in the oven, tossed all the ingredients in the pre-heated pan and only cooked it for 20 minutes. Got the nice brown color, great flavor and better texture. The grapes really make this dish. An excellent, easy side dish that pairs well with pork or poultry.

What a marvelous side dish! I added some fresh sage before serving. Roasted this on a dark pan for maximum caramelization and it was delicious. Try it, you'll like it.

Got rave reviews when I made this for Thanksgiving. It really was a nice change for BN squash. I found it took 20 minutes longer to get it to brown but I may have used more grapes vrs squash than recipe said.

Sounds weird, but because of the good reviews we decided to make it. It IS delicious. We also used black grapes; I was worried because the skin is more tart than red grapes but it came out fine - very tasty. Cooked the recommended length of time, then turned it down and cooked an additional 10 mins while I heated the rest of the meal. Perfect.

I haven't made this yet....but it sounds delish! To the cook about peeling...here's a great trick. If you have a Trader Joe's market, they have bags already peeled and cubed (fresh)!!!

Here's a tip for peeling squash, pumpkin, etc.- pre-cook the squash a bit by placing it in the microwave on high for a few minutes. The cooled squash then peels very easily.

Delicious, and for the cook who wants to know how to peel butternut squash. A little trick is to microwave the squash for a few minutes enough to soften the skin then slice into the skin and peel

I haven't made this recipe yet, but to answer a previous request: The best way to peel a butternut squash is to wear gloves ( your hands get yellow) and use a very sharp vegetable peeler. Other suggestion, which i love, would be to take advantage of the precut containers that many supermarkets offer this time of year (fall). Have fun!

Very nice recipe, and a bit unusual. The only thing I didn't expect was that it turned the onions purple, maybe because I used black grapes instead of red? To the previous reviewer who asked how to peel butternut squash: the easiest way I know is to cut it right where it starts to bell out. Peel the straight part like a cucumber and the round part like an apple. Then slice and dice. I use a Y-shaped peeler from Williams Sonoma that is terrific, and not expensive. A great gadget.

This was delicious. The grapes stayed plump, and when I bit into one, it sprayed warm, sweet juice into my mouth. The sugar from the grapes slightly carmelized the squash. I ate the leftovers for dessert. Will make again for Thanksgiving.

Great and easy. Blended the leftovers the next day with chicken stock, and a bit of half and half for a quick, tasty butternut squash soup!

This dish was perfect, the cooking time was to long, it was done in 30 min at a 425 convect oven.The only small change I did was I used a sweet red onion.

Delicious but the cooking time is a bit too long. In my convection oven, with the temperature set at 400, the squash was carmelized and done in 30 minutes. Served for the Jewish holidays to rave reviews!

At first I had my doubts about the grapes, but I followed the instructions exactly. It was really good! Easy to make, and the sage and grapes went surprisingly well with the squash. I searved it as a side, with pan fried chircken breasts topped with asiago cheese, sage, and procuitto. Great meal.
