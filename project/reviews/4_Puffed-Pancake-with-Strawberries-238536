I prefer - http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Dutch-Baby-with-Lemon-Sugar-352279 it's the dutch baby recipe also on epicurious. Pretty much same thing but better!

This pancake is a bit too "eggy" for my taste; if you don't like eggs you might not like this. However, my parents seemed to like it (I made it for breakfast) and the strawberries and powdered sugar give it a nice touch. The presentation in the pan before quartering it is really impressive!

delicious! it was a hit with the whole family. after reading all the recommendations of other cooks, i added 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1/2 tsp. of almond extract for a flavorful pancake. next time i might include other berries or peaches for a delightful summer breakfast.

This was quick and easy to make for a weekend brunch. I added vanilla as others had suggested and used half and half instead of whole milk as it was the only thing I had on hand. Turned out delicious and everyone loved it!

honestly, made this while half drunk and craving something sweet.Still turned out incredible. Subbed Amaretto for suggested vanilla. Sublime...

Just finished breakfast and these were delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except I squeezed a little bit of lemon on top. I should have read the reviews; adding vanilla or almond extracts would have made the batter a bit more flavorful which was the hubby's only complaint. I personally thought they were plenty flavorful. Can't wait to make for guests. Will definitely make this again.

I made this as a Valentine's breakfast for my wife and we both absolutely love it. As other reviewers suggested, I added 1 tsp. vanilla and a half teaspone of almond extract...mmmm good. By the way, it was easy to prepare and it did puff up pretty high. In addition I served it with maple syrup and a side of thick sliced maple smoked bacon...now that's a breakfast.

This is identical to the recipe I have developed for "Dutch Babies", and delicious with lemon juice and powdered sugar on top when strawberries are out of season. I add a tiny bit of lemon or orange oil (the orange is fabulous with the strawberries!). I also raise my oven rack 1 level above the middle, so the bottom of the pancake isn't quite so hard.

This was an easy quick alternative to regular pancakes. With litte flour, you could really taste the eggs which made for a hearty breakfast. Very good...will have this again soon.

Fantastic dessert, especially after a heavy dinner. Guests really appreciate the lightness and tastiness if the dinner has several courses. Also good in the winter with the raspberry sauce from "Thick apple pancakes with raspberry sauce." Is now a standard dessert for us.

Very nice and simple recipe. I did a couple of things differently. I eliminated the powdered sugar. I added minimal sugar to the strawberries and a hint of lemon juice. I also served it with lavender infused syrup found in another recipe with strawberries and lemon sugar. Great combination of flavours.

Cook from NY, living in Australia I found a similar recipe in a European magazine 15 years ago. I loved it, this recipe had all sorts of sliced fruit on top and it was served at the table in my favorite cast iron skillet. Thanks!! I loved this, agree with the vanilla.

I made this recipe for a Sunday morning breakfast for me and my husband. It was delicious; dense and custard like. He prefers more protein-based dishes (like crepes) so this was a new alternative. It was much easier and faster than traditional pancakes or crepes. I added ½ teaspoon of both vanilla and almond extract. I will definitely try this as a dessert the next time we have guests over.

I have been making this for several years but with slight adjustments. When the pancake comes out of the oven, squeeze 1/2 a lemon mix with powdered sugar in pancake. This will make a glaze. Add strawberries. I also add blueberries and a banana. Yummm!!!

i added vanilla as suggested and this pancake was just delicious - grand marnier would be good, instead, if serving for dessert. didn't use any sugar as the strawberries were very sweet, just drizzled a little maple syrup before serving.

These puff pancakes are great and vanilla would be a good addition. I make them in small ramekins so that everyone has their own little baby puff pancake. See photos on my blog at basilandginger.com

This was very easy to make and came together quickly. It was missing something for me, though, and next time I'll add a little vanilla to the batter.

This was super easy and tasty, but it was missing something for me. I will make it again, but I think next time I will add some vanilla to the batter.

I love this pancake. My mom used to make this when I was a kid. I made it with whole wheat pastry flour and it was deliciously tender

This was cool to make - I didn't have strawberries, but used powdered sugar and maple syrup. I like this version of a pancake and will make again.

My neice Drew and I tried this recipe. Very good. Impressive looking when served. Might add a bit of sugar to the batter to make it a tad sweeter for a dessert recipe. We will be making this one again!
