Would rate at 3 1/2 forks. Really delicious considering how easy to prepare. For 18+ oz. halibut cut in to 4 small fillets, prepared 1/2 recipe of the vegetable relish. Subbed cherry tomatoes, red bell pepper because that's what I had on hand. Used less onion and omitted cayenne out of necessity for husband who does not enjoy a lot of spice. Great served over whole wheat cous cous. Since I love some heat, garnished my plate with a drizzle of Sriracha. Yum!

The halibut was very moist. I substituted basil for the parsley and we loved it! This will be a favorite for dinner parties

This was a great, easy recipe. The fish was delicious, and i found the relish very tasty. I have even made the relish to eat on its own as a salad. I will definately make this again,next time for dinner party.

I liked the way the fish was cooked in the recipe it turned out yummy. However, the relish was very boring. I will make the fish again but will use a different accompaniment.
