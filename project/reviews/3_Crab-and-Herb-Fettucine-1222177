This was good with a few modifications. I halved the butter and added half a block of chèvre that I had in the fridge. The favors were good, but the quantities were off.

4 forks with a little modification. I doubled the sauce except the butter; used 15 Tbsp. butter. Didn't have white wine vinegar, used seasoned rice vinegar with delicious results! Definitely use more lemon zest and just because it punches up the flavor. Substituted 1 lb. bow- tie pasta to give the sauce something to stick to. Used 3 cans lump crab meat, works well in this dish. I had no leftovers!

Made this in a pinch for unexpected company with imitation crab and dried herbs. All agreed it was excellent. Highly recommend. Will make again.

this worked out great as a light summer supper. Lucky enough to have the herbs already growing out back, and chesapeake jumbo lump was available at the local market. really good. My main comment would be that it is hard not to break the lumps up when stirring in the herbs...

I thought this was really bland and I even tried to jazz it up with extra spices but without success. I think it would be better if the crab meat was seasoned or something else I couldn't really put my finger on...

This was so-so--my husband enjoyed it, I thought there are lots better ways to use lump crabmeat.

I used Krab and it was just fine. Love all the herbs and the spike of lemon.

Would do again, but I found the lemon taste to be overpowering. Will reduce lemon portion by at least 1/2 next time. Had to use dried tarragon and mix of herbs was good.

I used fresh "canned" crab meat from the fresh seafood section of the store, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I thought it was very good and worth making as a special dish or when having a dinner party. The butter did make it a bit rich for my palate, so I will try substituing with some olive oil next time. I don't often cook with tarragon, so I enjoyed the fragrant nature of the herb. I am always looking for new flavors to add to our table and this was a nice (if slightly decadant) dish to serve.

I absolutely loved this dish, and can't wait to have it again. I actually loved all the butter -- so decadent! -- but using olive oil as suggested by some reviewers is a great idea. I also agree that the pasteurized, canned crab (from the refrigerator section, not the tuna shelf!) is just fine here.

This was positively the greatest waste of time and crab ever. The only way to improve it is to not make it.

I also reduced the butter from 10 tbs to 6, and added 2 tbs of olive oil. I used fresh crabmeat and an "Italian Bouquet" mix of fresh herbs (basil, oregano, thyme) from the store instead of the herbs in the recipe, and added peas. I ladled the whole mix over fettucine florentine, and topped with crushed red pepper and grate parmesan. It was really, really good.

I rated the recipe at 3 forks because I think the modifications that I made brought the dish from delicious to outstanding. First off, I reduced the butter from 10 tbsp to 6 and added 2 tbsp olive oil. I added 1 tbsp chopped fresh thyme and 2 tbsp chopped fresh mint to the herb mixture. Also, I added 1/2 tsp. crushed dried red pepper, which gave it a nice kick! I also added freshly grated parmesan cheese (1/4 cup) as a garnish. Delicious!!! Also, I highly recommend the large, 1lb can of fresh crabmeat from Trader Joe's.

was really excited to try this one, but would not do again. expected more subtle flavors, but as other reviewers pointed the tarragon is too overwhelming.

Rating: 1
We found this dish edible but not particularly enjoyable. I felt that the tarragon overpowered the dish. My husband thought is was good but two "herby". I guess if you are a fan of tarragon you'll enjoy this, otherwise I wouldn't recommend it.

This is definitely a make again dish for even your most descriminating dinner guests. Every mouthful is a surprise in that you can taste each individual ingredient making its contribution to the whole. It's also easy to assemble. I made the crab portion before guests arrived and only needed to attend to the pasta right before calling the guests to the table. This time of year, I served it with a Jersey Fresh tomato salad. Delicious.

Had a dinner party for six and served this as an appetizer. Everyone loved it, they even asked for seconds with the main course. Half of us considered it heavy, and the other half did not.

I was amazed with the results. The herbs make it a delicate and very interesting summer dish.

This was pretty much just crab, herbs, and pasta. Not very good. One could find better uses for crabmeat.

Really delicious! It is deceivingly heavy though. I used a very small amount of fresh tarragon because I'm not a big fan of it, but just the hint was enough to liven up all the flavors! Next time I will definitely lighten up the dish a little. It was very buttery and rich.

Great recipe. Fresh and light. Perfect for summer entertaining.

Delicious - Perfectly balanced flavors but describing it as a LIGHT citrus sauce is a bit of false advertising - the only thing light about this is the color - it's wonderful but oh so rich. I made it according to recipe this time (took the meat from King Crab legs, used fresh tarragon from garden) but next time will "lighten" it up myself.

Delicious! I made it on a really hot summer day and it was beautifully light. I must confess, I don't like tarragon, so I used basil instead. After reading the other reviews, I increased the amount of pasta to 12 oz. dry egg noodles. The dish went perfectly with a glass of sauvignon blanc. I will definintely make this again.

This was SO good and fresh-tasting. I removed the meat from snow crab legs, used fresh tarragon from the garden, and fresh pasta, as someone else suggested.

I used a whole box of fettucine and there was still plenty of sauce left - probably could make a box and a half. Agree about the tarragon, while a classic pairing for crab, it can be overwhelming - I used a little less and more basil. Don't bother making unless you have fresh crabmeat

We were divided on this one. My mother loved it and scraped her plate; I thought it was okay. We used canned crab from Costco instead of fresh, which may have made some difference; also, you have to REALLY like the taste of tarragon. What we both agreed on is that much more pasta was needed for the amount of sauce. I'd double the amount next time.

A wonderful, light, but flavorful dish. The vinegar/wine mixture thickens the butter to a lovely sauce with some body-- not at all oily, or greasy. The herbs (especially tarragon) lend a nice complement to the crab, without over powering. I substituted 1 lb fresh fettucine for the dried. It was fantastic, and easy to prepare. Great for a warm summer night on the patio with friends.
