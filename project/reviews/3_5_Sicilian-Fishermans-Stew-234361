I doubled the wine, used a 28oz. can of chopped tomatoes (no good tomatoes yet) and half cod half shrimp. It turned out well especially given how fast this is.

I loved this because it's great tasting and simple, very fast. You could make it for a weekday homey meal with inexpensive fish like tilapia, or dress it up with a bit of shellfish added to the cod/halibut/etc. Absolutely must add more wine and tomatoes, and I agree with the reviewers that added spices, I added crushed red pepper. Super healthy. I served with a steamed artichoke first course, and with salad & crusty bread alongside the stew.

I made this with tile fish because that's what looked good at the farmer's market, and the somwhat-steaky fish did great. Added diced, pitted olives (green and black mix) because I had some, and loved the added Sicilian kick. The recipe worked fine without parsley, which I didn't have--though I'm sure the herb adds a nice touch. I agree that I would probably make more broth next time with more wine and water. Hearty but not heavy. Will definitely make again.

Very tasty - once I added the wine, hungry guys appeared from all corners of the house (this result not guaranteed if there are no guys in you house to begin with...). I added some tiny baby potatoes (whole) about 10 mins before adding the fish. I used tilapia from Trader Joe's at $5/lb - great meal for little $$.

My boyfriend and I decided to make this on a whim one night just using whatever fish was on sale at the market (Tilapia and Halibut), we also threw in some muscles and scallops which made it all the more delicious! This recipe is so easy, filling, healthy, tasty - I just can't say enough good things about it! We have added it to our short list of regular dishes! I agree with the other reviewers who added more tomatoes - I actually added more wine and water (in proportion) as well to get more broth/sauce. Try this, and don't feel pressure to spend a lot on expensive cuts of fish - it was delicious on the cheap as well!

Except for chopping, this was an easy but delicious recipe, even tho I had to use frozen swordfish. Not cheap, however, if you aren't a fisherperson. Definitely improved by grated Italian cheese. As one would expect, nice with crusty bread and dry Italian pinot grigio.

Just a remark: this recipe is exactly the same as Sicilian Fish Stew with Tomato and Parsley. The only difference is that this recipe calls for two tomatoes, which is still too little. I made it using a whole tin of tomatoes, otherwise there's hardly any sauce. And basil is very good with it too.

This was a really nice, warming stew. It's simple, so good, fresh ingredients are key. Definitely wants some warm, crusty bread.

I'm not a big fish fan, so it may be that this tastes better than I've rated it, but it's relatively fast and easy. I made this for a party (doubling the recipe) and it was a big hit with those who don't eat meat

I have made this recipe many times and have sometimes substiuted a can of chopped tomatoes for fresh and have added a small bottle of clam juice. It's terrific. Just add a nice loaf of crusty bread and you have the perfect seaside dinner.

This was very easy, healthy and good. My husband thought it needed some "zip" like from lemon, but the rest of us weren't sure. It was subtle, simple and wholesome.
