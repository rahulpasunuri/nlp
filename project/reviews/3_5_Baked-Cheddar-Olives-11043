My guests almost come to blows over these! I have been doubling the recipe, but I think I'm going to have to start tripling it! I use extra sharp cheddar, grate it while it's cold and then allow it and all the other ingredients to come to room temperature before mixing. I use my hands to mix and form the dough. On occasion I have added up to an extra tablespoon of butter and/or a teaspooon or so of water to aid in dough formation. I find that these taste best at room temperature. It's critical to use small olives to ensure the tastiest dough to olive ratio.

Great little addicting munchie...especially for cocktail parties. I used 3 tablespoons of butter as I could not get the dough to form with only 2....

Bring these to gatherings and social functions and folks will be glad you came. Here's how I get around adding liquid to the dough: Using a pastry cutter, cut cold butter into the dough, as for pie crust. Combine the flour/butter mixture with the rest of the ingredients and let it sit out on the counter for an hour or so - the mixture comes together beautifully. I also find that there's enough brine on the olives to help with the adhesion. The real trick to these is to form just enough dough around each olive and no more than that. Finally, like other raters, I tend to buy supermarket finely shredded cheddar and olives - only I add maybe 1/4 cup pecorino or reggianno to the dough. These are really worth the small bother.

Really yummy! I was afraid the dough might be a little bland but it was very cheesy!

These are amazing and really easy to make! I used a high quality English White Cheddar and did not find it necessary to add liquid - curious how they look with orange cheddar as previously recommended. I served these on Thanksgiving with cocktails and got rave reviews... I highly recommend for any party you have!

Yummy! These were delicious and relatively simple to put together quickly. I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and added about 1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon of olive juice to the dough to make it easier to mold. Next time, I will grate the cheese very finely - I think this will help, too. These will be high on my list from now on.

I have made this appetizer a half dozen times over the last couple years, and I am getting ready to make again to take to a party tonight. I get nothing but compliments on these. Everyone seems to like them. Looking over past reviews, many people found that adding a few drops of water made it easier to roll the dough around the olives....I would agree with the concept, but I add a few drops of the liquid the olives are in and like that MUCH better. You don't want to add too much, but a little really makes it easier! I -- and my husband! -- highly recommend this recipe!

Why anyone wouldn't give this recipe four stars is beyond me! It is amazing and so easy! I have, however, experimented with different cheddars, and that can make a difference. I recommend Tillamook extra sharp cheddar; barring that, make sure you use an "orange", extra sharp cheddar. As for olives, dont get too fancy, just good ol' jarred spanish olives with pimentos work best.

These tasted weird to me while the olives were still hot (too strong) but once they were cool they were fantastic! The only change I made was to add a few drops of beer to the dough b/c it was too dry to work with.

I made these this past weekend for a family pot luck dinner. I thought that they were good but not great. However they seemed to go over very well with my family.

A recipe adaptation from the classic Olive-Cheese Nuggets from the original 1967 Elegant But Easy...original recipe uses 1/4 lb sharp cheddar, 1/4 cup soft butter, with 3/4 cup sifted flour, 1/8 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. paprika, I always added a dash of red pepper and wow, it's been a hit at parties, ladies nights, & family gatherings for 3 generations! Best of all, takes only a few minutes to make, throw in the freezer, then always have an instant hors d'oeuvres ready to pop in the oven. Original recipe dough much easier to work with than this recipe. Same concept, place teaspoon of dough in hand and wrap around olive, couldn't be easier. Less flour in this recipe makes it a snap and tastes much better.

This is a great epicurious moment when one reviewer is worried that you'll use farmhouse cheddar and high-end olives while another is concerned about which grade of store-bought grated cheese you might endeavor. The end result is yummy. The addition of worcestershire is in the spirit, but actually next time i will try a little dry mustard instead. Also, enlist the fastidious person in your life to form the balls for you.

These were great and my guests loved them. I cut down on the flour a tad and it was just enough to take away the floury flavor and enhance the cheese!

Surprisingly delicious! They were the last thing I set out at a recent party and the first to disappear. Thanks to Katy from Oakland, I found her advice to be spot on. All I would add is to maybe use finely shredded cheese or grate your own to make it more likely to stick. And don't be deterred when it doesn't look like "dough" -- it will stick with the pressure from your hand. These will be a staple at my future parties...

This is one of those magic recipes: easy easy easy, and tastes so fantastic that people's eyes get real wide after they bite into it. I've made it at least four times, and for me, its important to NOT to buy a real nice cheddar. This recipe is best with good ol' grocery store orange cheddar cheese; somehow the fancy stuff doesnt work as well. I used Tillamook. Also, get the small spanish olives that come in a jar; dont buy gourmet, big olives. the only other thing is that this recipe is woefully tiny. it makes about twelve. Should be quadrupled! Press a ball of the cheese in your palm, then place the olive inside the circle, and slowly work the cheese mixture around it. I find that the juice from the olive helps.

Even though I followed the recipe exactly, the overall taste was of the flour. If I could get rid of that, it would be a great snack.

There is a better recipe for this in the Fannie Farmer cookbook - called Cheese Puffs. I don't like this variation as much.

Did not disappear but everyone thought they were very good. I probably liked them the best... great combo of flavors with the "kick" sending it over the edge. Wish I had some right now. . .

I've been serving these to rave reviews since 1991. Try making it with the olives stuffed with almonds and extra cayenne -- delicious, very tapas-like, and perfect with a cool glass of dry sherry.

These are so delicious! I took the advice from the previous reviewer when it came to rolling the olives in the dough: I flattened circles of dough in my hand, stretched it around the olives, and rolled the olives in my hands afterwards to smooth the coating. This was very easy, and I think it helped keep down the dough/olive ratio, so there was no need to double the amount of dough like some other reviewers ruggest. Really delicious party food. The better olives you buy, the better it will taste.

I've been making this recipe for a few years now, and it is ALWAYS a huge hit. I am not allowed to host our annual Superbowl party without them. (A friend calls them "those cheez-it olive things) A few tips: I always buy good, large deli olives, not the jarred kind. I find this recipe really small for that; I always double it, and for large groups I quadruple. The dough is a lot easier to make if both the butter and the cheese are at room temperature. I have found a pretty easy way to wrap the olives, too. I drop the dough in tablespoon scoops (or larger), but then I smash it into a flat circle in my hand, wrap the olive in it, then just roll the olive around until it's pretty even. Using my hands seems to soften the dough enough that I don't have to add water, even when it's really crumbly.

Made this exactly to the recipe ... they came out very light and the olive with the cheddar is a surprisingly good combination of flavours.

Made these for a New Year's Eve dinner party and they were devoured. Not a one was left. I did have some trouble wrapping the dough around the olives (dough was very dry and crumbly even after adding water). Made ahead of time and froze--then popped them in the oven for about 20 minutes and served. Will definitely make again.

I don't know what went wrong... it was pretty bad.

These couldn't possible be any better! I love these! I doubled the amount of dough, since I wanted a few more than 24 appetizers, and it made enough for 32 olives. I had to add more butter than was called for, to get the dough to hold together. Also added more cayenne, which I love. These were like like cheese-olive cookies. I'm going to make these again for Christmas, if not before. They're also good room-temperature and even cold. Little orange delights!

These were so good! In addition to the olives, I used marinated pearl onions and red peppers. I did need to add more butter than called for as my dough was too dry to work with. They were gobbled up by my guests!

While making the cheese dough, i realized that i only had about 5 stuffed olives left in the fridge. Having a few sweet red bell peppers and some black pitted olives, i decided to dice em up and use that as a stuffer and found that it tasted excellent...the salty cheese dough (i added some parmesan to the mix) went really well with the sweet peppers inside...a perfect afternoon snack!

If you love cheese, try making this wonderful appetizer with "MacLaren's Imperial" sharp cold pack cheddar cheese. It comes in a 250g red tub and transforms this into a cheese fiend's dream.

I've been making this recipe ever since it appeared in the January 1991 issue. Always gets rave reviews! A real "standard" at our house. I use extra-sharp white cheddar and usually double the cayenne. Also, it works perfectly in the Cuisinart--just grate the cheese (4 oz. by weight)with the grating blade, replace grating blade with the metal chopping blade, add all other ingredients and process until dough forms a ball on top of blade. Works every time. GREAT RECIPE! PS: I've found, a good brand (such as Goya)of "manzanilla" olives are best for this.

Instead of using small, pimento-stuffed olives, I subtituted large, garlic-stuffed and jalapeno-stuffed olives. They dissapeared in minutes! Using the larger olives requires you to (at least) double the recipe. I agree that the cayenne should be increased as well.

My mom introduced us to these delicious cocktail munchies a few years ago. They are easy but time consuming and well worth the effort if you like green olives. We tried wrapping them in puff pastry, and while that tastes fine, they paled in comparison to the cheddar dough. Make several, they freeze very well and reheat in a flash for a fast appetizer

People come to my house now asking where those killer cheese olives are. So now I keep a bunch frozen in case people drop by. The hardest part about this recipe is rolling the olives in the dough. I found though that once you get the olive wrapped, just rolling it around between the palms of your hands distributes the dough nicely around the olive.

I just read this recipe while searching for another, but I made this many years ago as a canape. I used the Pillsbury Crescent Rolls, but then coated them w/ grated parmesan cheese before baking. They always received raves when served.

Rating: 2
I made these last week, and the flavor, when you bite into them, is DELICIOUS. The thing I wasn't so crazy about, however, is that the coating turned out to be sort of cracker-textured...the texture of the breading wasn't what I had expected. Probably won't make them again because of that. Flavor, though, was great!

I was disappointed with this recipe. The dough was too dense, needed to be lighter and fluffier. The idea posted of using refridgerator biscuit dough would probably be better. I might try puff pastry dough. (note: the addition of more cayenne is recommended if you use this recipe).

Rating: 3
These were a hit...very easy. The most time is spent wrapping the olives. I might use double the amount of cayenne next time. I like food that has a kick to it, and I wasn't able to taste the cayenne this time around. Overall, it was a very good dish.

Here is a simpler variation of olive canapes I snagged from my sister-in-law. They're fabulous and much too easy. Pillsbury crescent rolls (in pop-open canister, from dairy case) good quality olives, pitted chopped fresh rosemary. Tear off a piece of dough, wrap around olive sealing well, and place on baking sheet seam side down. Brush with olive oil and sprinkle lightly with rosemary. Bake until golden. These can be prepared ahead of time and refrigerated before dabbing with oil and rosemary and baking.

What a great, simple recipe! I also had trouble getting the dough to stick together and added a little extra butter. Also, if the butter is very soft, it is a little easier. I don't know if my olives were extra large, but I only got 12 from the recipe instead of 24. I also cooked them a little longer than called for. They hold up well and are even great cold the next day. Very easy for last minute guests and everybody likes them!

Talk about easy! And what a hit these olives are. I had a little trouble getting the mixture to stick together so I sprinkled a little water on it and that seemed to do the tricked. They are absolutely delicious. Perfect treat to bring to or make for any holiday party!

I surprised my family by making this as an appetizer and we almost ruined our appetites eating these. We couldn't even wait for them to cool off before eating them. I would recommend waiting, however, they do taste even better after they have cooled a bit. Very Yummy!

This was a big hit at the last party I threw. In fact, people have requested that it be served at my next gathering.
