This was great. I followed the recipe pretty closely but did add some white wine as mentioned before by other reviewers. Easy and delicious.

This is such a quick, simple recipe. I made it over pasta. I doubled the chicken broth and the tomatoes/juice, and then reduced the liquid down to get a heartier ragu texture. (must remove clams first or they get overdone)

This was so fast, simple and delicious. My only changes were to use some clam juice and white wine along with the chicken broth. Probably 1.5c liquid in total and a larger can of chopped San Marzano tomatoes. I grilled and sliced my sausage and tossed in some sauteed fennel thinly sliced too. I used steamer clams, which were a good sub for little necks. But my boyfriend and I ate 3 pounds by ourselves. Not sure how 4 pounds would equal 6 servings... Served with toasted baguette and balsamic dressed salad. Great dinner.

This was hit with a few substitutions. I took the advice of other reviewers and cut the sausage to a half pound. I also used hot chourico rather than italian sausage. I substituted an 8 oz bottle of clam juice for the chicken broth. I also deglazed the pan with white wine. Sliced a crusty french bread and served alongside this dish was great for soaking up the juice. It was almost a shame to throw out the remaining juices when we were done. A definite keeper

Excellent! Used 2 cans of tomatoes, clam stock instead of chicken, and added 1/2 cup vermouth with juices and served over angel hair with garlic bread and simple salad

I have made this 3 times in the past 3 months. Love it, love it, love it... I put some white beans in the last time and a little less sausage. We had a crisp white wime and bread.

We made this recipe after buying clams on a whim and not knowing what to do with them. It was glorious! The balsamic really makes the dish pop. We used Cherrystone clams (that's what we'd bought) and served it over rice. Can't wait to make it for company!

Mom was super impressed with this meal for Mother's Day, well dad was too. Couldn't believe how simple this meal was to put together. I did take a reviewers suggestion and pre cooked the sausage and then sliced it, less grease and more appealing looking, doubled the sauce, substituting wine for half of the broth and added some sliced mushrooms, a family favorite. To save time, I actually made the sauce the day before which gave me the chance to skim any excess fat off, plus the flavors melded and deepened. Just heated back to a gentle boil before adding the clams. Served over faralle pasta with a nice crusty loaf of bread.

I used a combination of New Zealand green lip mussels and littleneck clams. I'm not a major clam lover, but this dish was outstanding. The sausage was home made venison spicy Italian. This will be a staple preparation in my household from now on.

I used 1/2 littlenecks and 1/2 cherrystones b/c the market didn't have enough littlenecks. I liked the texture of the littlenecks better. I used 1/2 lb of spicy Italian sausage, used 1/2 c. stock and 1/2 c. dry white wine and let it reduce a bit before adding the clams. Delicious! My boyfriend raved and gobbled it up.

fantastic taste- i substituted mussels to this recipe along with about a dozen clams (i kept the same poundage). i would also cut the sausage by a quarter and almost double the tomato recipe as indicated below- let the stock cook off a bit before you add the clams- about two minutes before they're don, add the mussels- definately serve bread to soak up the sauce!!

I never made clams before and this recipe was so easy. I added a little white wine to spice up the flavor a little - it turned out awesome! Would definitely make it again.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish served over linguine but both thought it might be better with more tomatoes and less sausage.

I used this recipe to try out my new pressure cooker. It adapted perfectly! The clams were succulent and the sauce was infused with all of the flavors! (Hint for pressure cooking: Once up to full pressure cook for 1 min. and 30 sec. then release pressure immediately to avoid overcooking.)

I have made this recipe numerous times for my family with excellent results. The only change I made was to substitute the clams with mussels.

Excellent recipe but here's the changes I made. Instead of the Italian sausage, I used Bruce Aidels Cajun Creole Andouille sausage-just one- sauteed the sliced sausage a bit and omitted the red pepper flakes. It turned out really well, and I think I'd like it better than the crumbled sausage in the sauce! Just another idea....

I made this last night as a main dish for two and substituted 1 dozen cherrystone clams. I did not change anything else, having all that broth to dip bread in is the best part!The flavors were incredible!
