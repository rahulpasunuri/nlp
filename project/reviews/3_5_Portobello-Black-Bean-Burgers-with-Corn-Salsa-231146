The flavors are fine, but this recipe needs to go back to the drawing board at a fundamental level if it is meant to be served on anything or eaten with anything other than a spoon. We followed the recipe EXACTLY and got goopey patties -pleasantly crisp on the outside, the consistency of refried beans on the inside. More cooking could not improve the internal consistency without burning the outside.

I have been searching for a recipe such as this. But i must admit i was skeptical after reading all the iffy reviews.I decided to go ahead and give it a try with my very own twist.I sauteed 1/2 an onion & 1/2 a red bell pepper in a spritz of pan spray for 2min then i added the finely chopped mushrooms, 1tsp minced garlic, 1tsp minced chipotle pepper, salt & pepper, cooked for 2 more min.Once the mushroom mixer cooled i added 8oz of refried black beans, 1/4tsp of each chili powder, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder & lemon pepper, 1/8tsp of cumin, 2Tbs flat leaf parsley chopped, 6Tbs Panko, 2Tbs Breadcrumbs. After mixing all the ingredients together i formed 3 patties, dusted them with panko, then wrapped in plastic wrap and placed in freezer for another meal. The remaining mix i warmed in a skillet with 2Tbs of sloppy joe sauce, and served it on Sandwich Slims...!!DELISH!!

I loved this recipe, and so did my mostly meat loving husband! It was healthy, delicious, easy, affordable to make, and just so good. If someone is unexperienced at making black bean cakes, it may take some practice to get them right (so they are not soggy, so they have a nice crust, etc), but its well worth the practice. I'm heading to the store to get the ingredients to make this for the 3rd time now! :)

Really disappointing. The corn salsa was good though. But the burger tasted like cardboard.

I have yet to make this recipe, but I wanted to add a note regarding the Worcestershire sauce. If one is a vegetarian they need to be sure to get the Worcestershire specifically labeled Vegetarian. Annie's makes a great substitute. Other than that note, I look forward to trying this recipe!

We are not vegetarians and thought this recipe is a great idea. I followed the directions for the portobello and bean burgers and thought it might be a bit bland so I doubled up on all the spices except for the salt. The mixture tasted great, reminding us more of falafel and less of meat. People seemed to have problems when forming traditional sized burger patties, so we made smaller patties and fit a few instead of one into each pita pocket. Try a cumin-flavored slaw instead of drippy wet corn salsa. We loved our version.

We did not enjoy these burgers. The flavor of the mushrooms was lost and the burger was bland. The corn salsa was the saving grace. The burgers did not hold together very well but most veggie burgers I have made seem to have this problem.

Please be aware that Worcestershire sauce is NOT vegetarian: it contains anchovies. Just a heads up.

Calling this a "burger" was a bit of a reach but it was good. I tried making it as a burger but it was not good at all. Then I followed the suggestion with the pita bread and it was really great. Excellent and unusual flavor!

It was VERY quick and easy. I added a bit more breadcrumbs and fresh onion instead of onion powder. It does not taste like a burger, but still firm and tasty.

I decided to try it, since we are mostly veggie and my husband has a deadly soy allergy. It was a bit difficult to flip and I lost one, but overall they did go and they tasted delicious. In the future I am going to grab that brown rice idea and give it a try. I think it would really help.

I thought this dish was great. The first flip was a bit difficult, but that had more to do with the width of my spatula than the consistency of the burger. I did make a couple of modifications: I used a can of black refried beans instead of whole and I left out the Worchestershire simply because I didn't have any. I served it to company on black bean and cracked pepper bread from the local bakery. Wonderful!

This is very tasty. I took some cooked brown rice and blended it in the food processor. This added a nice "glue" and held the burger together really well without compromising the flavor. Made this recipe for a group of 40 people and everyone loved it (had some bacon on the side for the meat eaters)

Pretty tasty. Try cooking in olive oil, adding paprika, and instead of plain avocado, guacamole. As for the texture, I had to add more bread crumbs, but it was still a bit difficult.

I also had horrible problems with the texture of this. I used 6 oz mushrooms and 1 can black beans, and made sure I grilled it long enough to form a crust, but it was still incredibly mushy inside. That being said, the taste was really very good. While I detest folks like Layla1 who rate a recipe when they haven't anywhere near followed it, I will allow that peas with stuffing would of course hold together much better. Perhaps next time I would increase the bread crumbs, or lessen the worcesteshire to get a firmer consistency.

turned out fabulously, I really enjoyed these!

I was looking for a vegi burger receipe and decided to take faith in my fellow Southern Californian's recommendation (MBrosch 2/28/05) and give this receipe a try. Due to my personal dietary intolerances I had to make some major modifications to the receipe. (In fact so many, that we may have to rename it.) I have to say, my new version, although not gorgeous in looks, was absolutely fabulous in taste! And, I will definetly make this dish again. OK, now, hang on to your seats, it's a bumpy ride... To begin with, I deleted the following ingredients: the corn salsa, the black beans, the green chiles, the chili powder, the salt, the onion powder, the bread crumbs, the whole egg, and the vegetable oil cooking spray. I added to the existing receipe: three 8 1/2 oz. cans of peas (yes, folks peas! the perfect vegetable), 1/2 maui onion minced, 2 egg whites, 1 Tbl. Brushetta Sun Dried Tomatoes with olives, 4 Tbl. shredded parmesan cheese, 1 C. herb-seasoned stuffing, and 2 Tbl. garlic infused olive oil. I have to admit the mixture did fall apart a bit as I was turning it over in the pan, but I decided to loosen my expectations with the resultant loosening of the "pattie". I like to think of it as a "veggie, sloppy joe", rather than a veggie burger. I'd further advise that anyone who requires a structured lifestyle, may have difficulty with this one, but if you can "hang loose" (and you like the taste of peas), then the reward is worth the waiting. As a side comment, I do think that peas are an underrated vegetable that needs reconsideration. They are very filling, have lots of fiber, some protein, and lots of vitamins. Can't beat that. Also, if I figured it correctly, my revised version was lower in calories. It came to approximately 229 calories per serving, instead of the 416 calories in the original version.

One additional note...I only had 6 oz. of portobellos and used 1 can (14 or 15 oz?) of black beans, so the altered ratio may have helped the burgers stick together also.

I decided to try this recipe even after reading the lone, horrific, review posted...and I'm SO glad I did! Bear in mind that I accessed this recipe through Self and was looking for a healthy dinner (and am rating this as such), so if you're trying to imitate a meatless burger you had at a big chain restaurant, this may not be it. The flavors blended wonderfully, however, and both my husband and I really enjoyed this dish. I didn't feel like dirtying my food processor, and I think it may have worked in my favor - I finely chopped the mushrooms and then we used a hand masher to do our final blending of the burger mixture - I didn't have any trouble keeping the burgers "together." The end result is a bit "mushy," but not enough so to keep hubby from mentioning how similar to a burger he thought it was. Fresh and delicious, I though this was a great example of high nutrition, "bistro-style" fare. Looking forward to the leftovers...

If there were negative forks, this would have gotten them! Texture was awful, flavor was blah, and they would not stay together for anything! Skip this recipe and find another, if you are looking for a black bean burger recipe.
