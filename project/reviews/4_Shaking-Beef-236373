If you want to skip the butter, don't make this recipe. The butter is completely essential to how amazing this dish is. It has become a complete staple in my recipe book. This is so delicious I find myself randomly craving it at least weekly. Just writing this review, I'm drooling. It is sweet, a little salty, buttery, and melty. The beef is tender and juicy. Everything about this is sublime. A couple changes I made: Use low sodium soy sauce. I find that in general, low sodium soy sauce works better in cooking sauces. Double the amount of sauce you need. You're going to be licking the bottom of your wok to get the last drops of this sauce, you want to make sure there is plenty to put on your rice. This is the tastiest asian beef stir fry I've ever eaten. I made it once for a party and it was a huge hit.

This was an interesting twist of classic stir-fry, but nothing special. The hit of lime juice was good. I didn't serve it on watercress but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Also, I didn't use butter for health resaons.... probably a good reason it wasn't as good other reviewers thought!

Abso delish! First time making it, I followed the recipe for the meat exactly...next time I'll use a bit less salt and low sodium kikkoman soy sauce. There is plenty of flavor in the other ingredients. I also served this with plain rice to soak up the luscious juices with the salad on the side and some vietnamese vinegared onions. Oh, and a lime wedge to squeeze over the meat. I love trying new recipes, and this one is amongst the most gorgeous I have found so far! Me and this shaking beef have this friendship thing going on up in here! :)

I have had this at the Slanted Door and I had to make it. I followed this recipe as written and it did not disappoint! So far I've made it 4 times and I've concluded that 1 medium lime is not enough for 4 servings. This recipe served 3 well.

Wow! This might be one of the best beef entrees I have ever made. My boyfriend & I both loved it! The only thing I did different was I subbed boneless NY strip and cut it into very thin strips instead of cubing. Because of this, I cooked the meat for less time. I also added fresh basil to the pan when I threw in the scallions and onions. It was absolutely delicious and will become a staple of ours. Thank you so much to the poster of this recipe!

I added a little bit of dijon to the sauce and it added a lot of flavor! delicious recipe.

Delicious and quick. I skipped the butter and I forgot the lime juice. It was still a big hit.

Loved this easy, delicious dish. We added asparagus, yellow bell peppers, and snap peas. Left out the watercress & lime dipping sauce. The lime would have given a perfect hint of citrus, but it wasn't missed at all. Served over jasmine rice. Yum!

This was excellent. I poured the beef with the vinegar sauce over brown rice and did not use the lime dressing at all. I ended up with a very tasty rice and beef bowl. I added some roasted broccoli as well. Even my five and one year old eat it up!

this has become my favorite recipe for just plain stir fry, and i find its very amenable to substituting chicken for the beef. i marinate and cook the meat as directed, then set aside and add the vegetables to the same pan, stirfry them lightly (cooked about halfway to what i want), then add the meat back in and the fish sauce mixture at the end and finish cooking. it works well, good flavors. i havent tried it with shrimp yet, but i suspect it would be just as good.

I have made this recipe at least 4 or 5 times since first having it at the Slanted Door. We have tried other Shaking Beef recipes at other restaurants and have always been disappointed. This really is much like what I had at the restaurant (even if my wok never quite gets hot enough!). Thanks!

I made this for dinner tonight and my hubby loves it!!! Thank you for submitting this recipes Charles!

This is my favorite Asian Beef salad. The recipe sounds more complicated than it is. The secret to tender flavorful beef is to have the frying pan (or wok) super hot, then let the beef cook on each side undisturbed for the minimum amount of time necessary because the meat will continue to cook after you add the onions and while you are shaking it. I like the salt/pepper/lime dipping sauce but it is not required. Serve with Jasmine rice to get the full effect!

This easy recipe reminds us of our favorite Vietnamese dish. I concur with other posters -- the final sauce makes the dish something special. We've used pork, chicken, and beef, substituted lemon for lime and mirin for wine, and enjoyed every variation as well as the original.

Made it tonight. Not sure if it was supposed to be as juicy as it turned out to be. i skipped the greens and just stuck with the beef. other than that though the flavors were delicious

I cooked this for my family and they loved it. I am a huge fan and would love to see Charles Phan come out with a book and share more of his recipes.

Made this the other night in a desperate attempt to cook up a beef dish w/out worcestershire. It was delicious! Didn't have any fish sauce, and used mirin for the white wine. Everything else I followed to the letter. Be careful not to overcook the beef. Next time I'll be sure to use half the cooking time. The lime sauce is surprisingly good. Don't skip it!

This was really good. The recipe was a bit confusing since I didn't really know how it was supposed to turn out, but as I went along it made more sense. I used top sirlion instead of tenderloin and that worked very well. My wife isn't very fond of beef but she loved it. I'm curious now to try it again with a pork loin and see how that comes out.

This didn't turn out very well. It was vinegary and the meat had that fried taste. 6-8 minutes was way too long to cook 1 inch cubes of tenderloin. Perhaps I did something wrong, but I will not try this recipe again.

I made this for a small dinner party last night and it was a big hit! Today, I took the leftover cooked beef (small amount!), sliced it and combined with the marinade, lime sauce, chopped red onion, red pepper flakes & cilantro for a very delicious and authentic tasting Thai chili/lime beef salad! (A Thai chili instead of the red pepper flakes would have been better, but I didn't have one)

The Slanted Door is one of my favorite places to eat in SF so I was very excited when I found the recipe and I was not disappointed! Excellent and easy.

Simple to prepare, fun to cook and looks as great on the plate as it tastes. I prefer my beef rare, so I will cook it for only 3 minutes in total next time. My only caveat would be not to attempt this dish unless you have a really good extractor hood above the pan!

I was SO excited when I saw this recipe. I used to live down the street from the restauraunt that made this dish famous and it was my boyfriend's and my favorite. I made it tonight and we stuffed ourselves, it was so good, just as I remember it. I didn't use the watercress and made some sticky rice to go along with it and that worked great. The whole separating the meat thing is just to make sure the meat gets spread out on the pan, and you can split the vinegar mixture between the two batches. The lime sauce over the top just before serving is a must. (Many, many thanks to the poster.)
