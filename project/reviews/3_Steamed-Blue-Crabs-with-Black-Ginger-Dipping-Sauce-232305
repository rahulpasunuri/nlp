Even though I'll only bother with Blue Crabs (cooked at home) about once a year, this is a great addition to my 3 or 4 other BC recipes. Maybe I'm just getting older, but time I make crabs, I enjoy it less and less. It's just more work and mess than it seems worth - and I consider myself an "expert" crab-picker. And I agree with a few others: Old Bay is "old hat."

Aside from all the difference in preparing crab, has anyone tried the ginger sauce & what did you think?

To the cook from Cowtown, I believe the cook from Naples, Fl is referring to how to shell a blue crab after it has been steamed.

I've had crabs cooked just about anyway possible. Honestly, I think this is much better than souping them in OB and beer.

You do this while they're still alive? I guess that's why you break off the pinchers first. Some people boil first, then clean.

Here is my method for cleaning blue crab. You need a wooden table top and running water like a fish cleaning station. Carefully break off the pinchers and the little flap on the bottom. If that flap is not pointed, return the crab to the water, it is a female. Stand the crab on one point. Hold the legs with one hand and the other point with the other hand. Pull in opposite directions and the top of the shell will come off. Save the top of the shell for deviled crab. Using the hose and your fingers, remove the long thin tan lungs and the yellowish gut. Everything left, except the shell can be eaten.

Ok, this is the "throw 'em in the pot" method, live? A lady on Crystal Beach, TX told me there were several ways to kill a crab including "throw 'em in", but whatever you do, "kill 'em before they die". Cooked live, or kilt, what's the best way to clean them before eating? We catch a few every summer and put them in gumbo, or we can buy them live at Fiesta grocery store in Ft Worth, so I'm curious how ya'll cook and clean crabs.

To the MD cooks, this was a different way to prepare blue crabs. Your way is not the only way.

For perfect blue crabs, any Marylander will tell you that all you need is beer, butter,old bay, and salt (and maybe a little cider vinegar and green onion). Bring one bottle of beer, and equal part water to boil in the bottom of the crab pot...add the crabs in layers, seasoning generously with old bay and salt. Spread out the newspaper, and serve with the melted butter and apple cider vinegar. MMMMM!!!
