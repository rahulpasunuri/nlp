If you are having trouble with the cookies sticking to the pan, use a Silpat, it solves the problem and is SO easy to clean. I have made this with the homemade dough and with the Pepperidge Farm dough and they are interchangeable -- the whole trick is to chill everything at each step.

This was the most complex, time-intensive recipe I've ever made. But, the cookies were REALLY good. I discovered that chilling everything you use with the dough is good: the surface you roll them out on, the sugar/cinnamon mixture, etc. Also, I just let them cool on sheet of tin foil--they kept falling through the rack--and the tin foil worked well (they completely cool in a few minutes). Also helps to have lots of empty room in the refrigerator. I had a hard time understanding the instructions, so I looked it up on the internet and found an episode of a Julia Child show. She had a baker who she introduced as "the best pastry dough baker in the country". His recipe for the dough is MUCH simpler, so I'll try that next time. I'd provide the link, but not sure if that's permitted here.

OMGOODNESS were these AMAZING! The recipe is fairly easy - the hard part was having to wait 30 mins each time to re-fold them. I kept falling asleep so a recipe that would have taken 5 hours took a whole day! lol. The end result was fantastic! Cinnamon, sugar, butter! Two things: 1). While cooking, even if you had buttered the pan, the cookies will STILL stick onto it so it's very hard to keep them from breaking as you're peeling them off. 2). The recipe tells you to cook it for so-so time but I actually had to bake it longer because the dough wasn't firm and that was annoying. It took me 20 mins, I believe!

Yummy!! The dough actually does separate into flaky layers. It was a challenge to get it rolled out into a 15x8 rectangle each time, but turned out fine, so the recipe seems forgiving. The baked pieces didn't stick together very well, just ending up in halves instead - so have twice as many, right? Would be great for breakfast, too.

I made these this year for Christmas. They were really good. But my only problem was that I wasn't going to spend all day making dough. So I bought Pepperidge Farm Puff Pastry and it worked fantastic. I added a little bit more sugar and cinnamon to mine. I would definitely make them again soon.

worth the effort. i made this recipe while working on another. the only thing i changed was adding more cinnamon sugar, at my boyfriend's suggestion (he tends to like things on the sweeter side). after i made the cuts i sprinkled leftover cinnamon sugar onto a plate and coated both cut sides. it made the cookie sheet a bit stickier, but the result was very good, as all sides were sort of carmalized. i will definitely be making more of these.

A labor of love I make around Christmas every year. I have had problems with making these directly on a baking sheet (burning). I have found that a cooling rack with parchment paper spread over it works really well.

My husband and I LOVED these flaky, buttery little cookies. They're not even too sweet. 5 hours seems like a long time to spend making anything, but these aren't difficult at all, especially if you make them over the course of a few days. The most difficult thing about these was trying to stop eating them.

I have had these on my Christmas cookies platter since it came out in the magazine, and it's everyones favorite. Though they are time consuming this is not a difficult recipe. Even if they start to unravel (after the first 9 minutes of baking) simply reshape the dough to repair. I will say I have had tastier results with European butters such as Pure Kerrygold or Lurpak.

I loved these cookies. I couldn't stop eating them! Some of the best Christmas cookies.

I followed the recipe exactly and loved it! I have been craving palmiers since I got back from Paris and thought I would never have them again. When I made these, they were so much better than the ones in Paris. I made them at a slow pace over two days and found that it wasn't difficult at all to make and so easy to go through in 3 days!

This recipe makes the most delicious delicate cookies! The flavors of butter, cinammon, and sugar with the crispy texture was like taking a trip to France. I agree that this recipe is time consuming and the cookies should probably consumed with 3 days. Worth all the work!

These cookies were delicious and came out tasting much more delicate and complex than most bakery palmiers. Although the recipe looks time consuming, it's really not so bad if you're planning on being home all day because you can do other things while the cookies chill.

I guess you have to be a real baker to make these work. After all or the work, they wer only really good the first day. Re-cripting made them hard when they cooled. Definitely not worth the time.

EXCELLENT

These were fabulous, even with the endless rolling and chilling. The taste was so superior to store-bought puff pastry. One little tip, though. I had both logs on one silpat covered cookie sheet during their final chill. When I went to make the first batch, I reached for another cookie sheet and lined it with silpat and cooked the first batch of cookies. I cooked the second batch on the chilled cookie sheet. The second batch puffed substantially more. So make sure to use chilled cookie sheets for best result. I'd also roll them differently, just starting the sides and rolling toward the middle, for a better look.

Tiny, very cute little cookies. This is the first time I have ever turned dough and it came out better than I expected. I also did it over 3 or 4 days.

Despite the endless chilling and rolling, or maybe because of it, I loved this recipe. I did stumble on one piece of advice, however. According to the recipe you take the rolls of dough and put them on a cookie sheet in the refrigerator. I put both of them on the same silpat-line cookie sheet and when I went to cook them I grabbed another cookie sheet for the first roll, and lined it with a silpat mat (which worked just fine BTW). When it was time for the second batch I used the chilled cookie sheet that had been in the refrigerator and the cookies puffed substatially more. So, not to self, make sure to use chilled cookie sheets each time. I'll probably alos try to roll them toward the middle because the folded over shape comes out rather haphazardly, IMO. But, boy or bot were thee good. This was my first time making my own puff pastry and I can assure you, the difference in taste between that and the store-bought kind is huge.

Even though these had multiple steps and a lot of chilling time, I thought these were easy for the effort and the yield. I'll make these again!

Whoa! Labor intensive is right! This was the first time I've worked with puff pastry, and these came out wonderfully. I gave them out as Christmas gifts. They're much smaller than you normally find them, but so cute and tasty. I followed the recipe exactly--I just sprinkled the cookies with a little extra cinnamon sugar before baking.

I really liked these cookies-- simple, sweet, buttery and flaky. Yes, the steps are time consuming, but the rolling, folding and baking process was surprisingly simple and generated great results first time. I echo the previous recommendation to be sure to flip the palmiers quickly as soon as you take them out of the oven. I suppose if you wanted to cut down on the time, you could use frozen puff pastry, but I really liked how the homemade dough turned out.

I made these on a Sunday - which was a good idea considering that they are very time consuming to make. The process wasn't difficult and the cookies were delicious but they just didn't wow me. They were pretty tiny to begin with, which was cute, but didn't yield as many cookies as I felt a recipe that takes nearly six hours should. Mine didn't unfold because I pressed the folded dough together firmly on both sides. A nice first time experience with puff pastry but I doubt I will make them again.

First, the cookies are delicious. Unfortunately, they were a huge pain to bake. Most of them pulled apart a lot when I baked them, and they stuck to the parchment paper because I let them cool for a minute instead of flipping them immediately. I might make them again now that I know to flip them immediately as they come out of the oven.

These were fantastic cookies! Though the chilling and rolling of the dough was a bit time intensive, it was worth it. I baked these two days before I went to a holiday party and they should have be recrisped in the oven.

Excellent. Taste just like from a bakery, but fresher and more buttery. Super-easy, and I was worried because I added extra water to make the dough come together. I made one batch exactly as the recipe stated and in the second batch, I added orange zest. Both were great. The only problem wasw with the cookie unfolding as they baked. Still delicious though.

Oh my goodness, are these ever good. I didn't change the recipe at all. They are crisp and tasty. Well worth the effort.
