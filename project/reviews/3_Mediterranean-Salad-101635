I didn't find this bland at all. I used cilantro instead pf parsley which might have helped, as cilantro has a stringer (and more delicious!) taste. I also omitted the eggs.

I thought this was good enough to eat the night that I made it, although my fiance didn't. He didn't like the way the flavors were, or lack of flavor. He really couldn't put his finger on what he didn't like, oh well I wont be making this again.

I do not understand the bad rap that this salad is getting. It accompanied a wonderful recipe called Chicken with Bell Peppers, Smoked Ham and Paprika. I served it all with quinoa. Really nice meal. It is not an overpowering salad. All the ingredients blend rather well. Let it sit around for a couple of hours for the flavors to blend. A side note: Used a fresh roasted pepper instead of canned.

I've eaten such salads in numerous bars in soutch of France. The key is to have fresh, possibly organic vegetables that have strong natural flavor and taste. The US supermarkets' ones are bland and so is the salad made of them. So my advise is buy best and freshest vegetables you can, then you will see that you do not need additional salt or Dijon.

Don't bother. Boring and the flavours don't meld especially with the fennel.

This salad was a disappointment. It definitely lacks zing. I added a couple of tsps Dijon mustard to the dressing and that still didn't help. The vegetable combination is interesting, though. I guess I will experiment with it some more.

Even though my husband and I liked this dish, I agree with the reviewer that said it didn't have enough zip. Although it was much better the next day for lunch. Definately add salt. I also sprinkled a little bit of feta on it. Next time I'm going to try making it with Balsimic Vinager to see if it adds more flavor

This salad, despite its tempting lineup of vegetables, turned out plain and a little sad. The omission of salt seemed an error, so I salted the dressing, but it was not enough to perk it up.

What a nice surprise. This recipe is a wonderful side or main dish. My husband and I loved it!
