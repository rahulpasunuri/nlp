Interesting and easy dessert. I loved the texture, deep brown color, and strong coffee flavor. Don't skip the cream. Nice foil to the coffee flavor.

Interesting pudding. Used to hate tapioca, but really like this dish. The pud turned out nowhere near as clear as the one in the picture (but still appealing). I substituted Samboca for amaretto and used low-fat milk.
