Both husband and I found the salsa bland. Mint was a nice touch, though.

This is a delicious salsa. I loved the charred flavor, and everything came together nicely. I didn't use peppers or cumin because my guests didn't like either, but it was still wonderful and easy to make. Will definitely be making this again.
