My family enjoyed it for lunch today. Next time I will use a whole fish instead of fillets and steam the green beans to make them fresher and juicier. I didn't bother with the dried shrimp and we didn't seem to be missing anything in the curry.

I thought this recipe was incredible. My girlfriend now believes me to be an authentic Thai Chef. The curry has a deep heat, but not overpowering. It was thicker than most curries I've had. We used "Rice Powder" in lieu of "Rice Flour"? In any case, We raved and raved about how good it was.

This was quite good. The deep fried green beans were an interesting touch. I am not really convinced I noticed the dried shrimp in the dish, but I had them on hand so I used them. I made this with 1 pound of tilapia and served it with the pummelo salad, and found it to be more than enough for 6 servings. The 2 of us had lots of leftovers.

Using 1 cup mustard oil & 3 cups veg oil adds a tangy taste to the recipe !

According to my calculations, 1 1/2 lbs is the equivalent of 24 oz (16+8). So if each serving is 3 oz, this recipe should yield 8 servings. In this case, the recipe is assuming six 4-oz servings.

To the L.A. cook; a serving (or portion) of meat (in this case, fish) should be 3oz. Unfortunately, our culture has brainwashed us to believe that we need huge amounts of food on our plates. This provides exactly the right amount for 6 people.

This was good, but short of outstanding: the flavors are complex and work together well, but don't inspire or surprise that much. A good solid dish, though. One a side note, I found that the amount of food was not very much as a main course even for 5 people, let alone the 6 the recipe is supposed to be for.
