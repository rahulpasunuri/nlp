really nice and easy to make summer salad...especially if you are trying to get rid of purslane from your basil patch :-). Used big toms, and twice of their amount and everybody loved the unusual tanginess of the greens.

I was charmed by the recipes' weedy frugality so picked a handful of purslane off the garden path. My dinner guest plucked the leaves and small stems as I mixed the dressing, it is simple and ridiculously nutritious salad. If you find your self midsummer and tired summers' usual leafy fare this recipe will surprise.

This is a delicious salad and gets an extra fork for the fact that purslane grows like crazy in my garden and is a completely free vegetable. It tastes light and lemony flavor that is good tossed in many dishes. I highly recomend not weeding your garden.
