I followed the directions faithfully, cooking the dish in a roasting pan covered with heavy-duty aluminum foil. We really enjoyed this - the clams gave up a lot of liquid. We like spicy food and my husband suggested adding some sausage for a bit more kick - I might include some chorizo slices next time. A nice dish to serve to company.

I absolutely loved this recipe. It was a wonderful change from using pasta, Since it was for one person I did the following .Use cast iron skillet for whole meal. took wood handle off, used two large potatoes, peeled, 2 small onions, cut in half and sliced, 6-7 cloves garlic. NO cans tomatoes?, I used V8 juice. I love frozen Northern Star's clams on the half shell. They are excellent for this kind of dish. I didnt put temp of oven up as high by accident so had to cook potatoes longer but then jacked up heat to 400. I would make this again and again.

It took forever for the clams to open. I would oven roast the potatos and then do it all stove top. I added shrimp and I should have done it at the last minutes of cooking. I do this same dish with mussels.

Love this recipe. Have added shrimp and lobster pieces and served it as a zuppe de pesce. I can't believe how easy it is and so delicious.

To Cook on 10/6 - It's aluminum cookware that you shouldn't use for cooking tomatoes. Cast iron isn't the greatest either.

This was absolutely wonderful & easy to make. I was out of regular potatoes, and used sweet potatoes instead, which really added a new dimension of flavor!

Absolutely delicious! Instead of the fresh tomatoes I used diced canned tomatoes & only used a little red pepper flakes. My family loved it. What a winner!

Fantastic! I haven't had a meal that good in a long time - restaurant or home cooked. And really easy! The clams released allot of liquid so make sure you have some crusty bread to sop it up. Yes I made it in a cast iron dutch oven. I've cooked tom. sauce and chili in cast iron with no prob.

We made this recipe with wonderful clams ordered from the website in the Gourmet article (patsclams.com). It is lots of fun and just delicious. It's very easy to assemble in a large roasting pan

This was devoured by four of us. It was definitely a winner. I even gave the recipe to our friends and they are very difficult to please.
