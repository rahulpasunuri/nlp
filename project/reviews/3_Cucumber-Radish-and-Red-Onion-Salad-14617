This was ok. I liked having all the vegetables really thin, but the flavor was so-so. I added a lot of salt to my very fresh farmer's market vegetables and still thought the salad was missing something. Perhaps a little dill would have done it. I will make it again and experiment as the vegetables themselves made for a nice medley and presentation.

I sliced the cucumber and onion very thin on a mandoline-type slicer. I did not expect this salad to be good but,against my better judgement, I followed the recipe to the letter. I still do not understand why, but this salad was excellent! It is especially good as a side dish or accompaniment to special sandwiches.

Would make a nice light lunch. Just add bread. I also like it because many times I actually have these ingredients on hand.

Maybe my onion was particularly strong, but I thought it overpowered the cuke and even the radish.

An excellent change from the everyday cucumber salid.
