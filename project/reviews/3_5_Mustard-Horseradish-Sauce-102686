Made for the third time and thought it is a good balance of ingredients and has great flavor. I did add an extra tablespoon of horseradish.

Great sauce, super easy to make and flavorful. I've made it numerous times with the beef tenderloin recipe, and as a condiment to lesser cuts of beef, and it is always a hit! Tarragon adds a lemony peppery sweetness but I agree with other reviewers that the sauce is still good when tarragon is not available.

This was PERFECT with tenderloin... no need for fresh tarragon in my opinion... if you permit the flavors to develop.

Excellent accompaniment to a wide variety of meats.I make it every year with my Christmas beef tenderloin, on top a bed of watercress with parmesan shavings and olive oil drizzle.

I've made this recipes several times, and I agree more horseradish to taste. I use my homemade horse radish that is stronger than most prepared ones at that. I've also used a bit of concentrated apple juice to add some light sweetness, which is especially tasty with pork.

This is a great recipe for those who want to adjust the heat of horseradish I made it exactly as written but, as other reviewers did, I ended up adding more horseradish until the amount had been doubled. I served it alongside the herb-and-garlic crusted beef tenderloin (also found on this website) for Christmas dinner. My guests loved both the sauce and the beef; both will go in my repertoire.

As many have said I would add more horseradish to taste. Was wonderful with prime rib. Offered this and cabernet au jus, both were outstanding.

This is so good, I wanted to spread it on everything in sight. Truly delicious, simple, perfect. Will be making it again soon. Tastes good slathered on leftover roasted potatoes.

Good sauce to accompany Prime Rib. I suggest adding more horseradish. The sauce is easy and can be made a day ahead. I made this a second time and found it to be too mustardy as others have mentioned.

So simple and a wonderful alternative to horseradish sauce. I always serve it with beef tender.

Made this for a dinner party to serve with beef tenderloin and got rave reviews - used a little more mustard than called for, about half the amount of horseradish and added a little lemon juice. Toyed with adding capers as one reviewer did but in the end decided they weren't needed. If I were making this to go with a fish dish, I might further reduce the horseradish, substitute dill and add the capers, though.

I used this sauce for my corned beef and cabbage dinner for St. Patrick's Day 2002. It was excellent. Like another reviewer, I had to use dried tarragon, but I'm sure that fresh is better. I think another fresh herb might work well, too. As was suggested, I used slightly less mustard, and I added some salt.

Made this using regular (non-fat) plain yogurt, half the Dijon, half the olive oil and half the horseradish. Had excellent flavor on poached salmon.

Was intended for salmon burgers...could not use. Overpowering dijon flavor. Would not use on anything!

I served this with beef tenderloin for a garden dinner party and the combination was delicious.

Made this with a little less dijon mustard and a touch of lemon juice, plus salt and pepper. Substituted dill for the tarragon and added capers after blending. Served with grilled Chilean Sea Bass and Asparagus Flan. Outstanding.

Made this sauce to serve with citrus-braised pork tenderloin with small party rolls as part of a buffet. Everyone loved it! I did add more sour cream to the sauce to make the consistency thicker for spreading. Perfect accompaniment to the pork. Will definitely make this again.

I'm not a big fan of horseradish sauce, but the Dijoin mustard cuts the horseradish "kick" nicely. Very nice consistency, but use good quality sour cream. I served it w/ a standing rib roast and everyone seemed to enjoy it.

Excellent. We made this with an herb breadcrumb crusted pork tenderloin with basil cream mashed potatoes. Plate with a mound of mashed potatoes in the middle of the plate, then slice pork into inch thick medallions and place N,S,E, and west on plate around potatoes. Dollup the pork with the mustard sauce and hit the plate with extra chopped tarragon. Emeril ain't got noth'n.

I use the mustard-horseradish sauce with your recipe for seared beef tenderloin, which I was the "hit of my summer party"! It was an easy recipe to follow, and instead of searing it inside the house, I had put it on the grill outside, adding all the trimming you suggested! Thank you. You always come through for me.
