Very happy with this. Substituted cauliflower for potatoes due to dietary needs. Used fresh instead of canned tomatoes. Used two chilies and the result was not spicy at all - next time, will not seed. used lime juice at the end. Served with quinoa. Delightful!

It's a bit time consuming so make sure you aren't too hungry while cooking, it smells so good. I used only 1 chile, and omited the lemon juice. We ate with naan bread instead of rice. Will definitely make it again.
