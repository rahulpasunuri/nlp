made this for xmas dinner, it was delicious, easy to make, and very nice presentation. The crust was a little too salty for my taste, I would cut the salt to 1/4 tsp. in the crust. Otherwise perfect. Not too sweet.

I made this for Thanksgiving and had such high hopes for it, but it was sooo sweet! I couldn't even eat it, although sugar-toothed friend liked it.

I included this in the pre-Thanksgiving menu for our Gourmet Group dinner, and assigned it to myself. It was awesome - a perfect sweet ending to a big turkey dinner. (I did have to add a little more browned butter) I will give it for Christmas gifts along with the recipe!

I made this tart for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. I followed the recipe exactly and would make it again. The crust was flavorful and the filling was nice and gooey.

Delicious and easy to make. People are asking me for the recipe. I will definitely be making it again.

Browned butter makes everything better! This came out beautifully, particularly the crust. I only had a 10" pan and it covered the bottom with a nice thickness. I also used probably 4 extra tablespoons of butter in the filling and came out with a texture very similar to pecan pie. Dreamy!

The browned butter and golden syrup combination make this very delicious, but my crust really absorbed the filling so I didnt get quite the gooey center I had expected. I will make it again though as it was quite easy and had great flavor, but I may need to add a little more butter to the crust and bake it a bit longer before adding filling. As it was, it tasted more like a (very tasty) pecan cookie bar.
