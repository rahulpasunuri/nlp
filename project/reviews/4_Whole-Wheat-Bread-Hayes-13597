This was really good, basic bread, with a touch of sweetness. I added toasted walnuts and raisins to one loaf, which made it even better. I used half bread flour to keep the loaves lighter, and I think it that makes a good balance.

Add my praise to the others before me on how great this bread is. First time making bread and it turns out fantastic. Added sugar to the yeast, and 1/2 and 1/2 white/wheat flour. The second I made it I couldn't get over how dense the dough was (before the first rise) but realized I only used 1/4 c oil instead of the full 1/2 c. Mixed all the ingredients using the dough hook.

This bread is a weekly staple in our home. The only variation is to add the sugar with the yeast and to substitute multigrain flour for half of the whole wheat. It gets rave reviews from all our guests!

I usually never rate recipes, except in my head, but this one is the exception! I'm a complete beginner when it comes to yeast breads, and even though I think I overkneaded this one, it still came out great, if a little dense. Followed the recipe to a T except I subbed honey for the molasses since I didn't have any on hand, and skipped the egg wash because I forgot to pick up eggs at the store. This tastes as good or better than anything store-bought. The crust is light and ever so slightly crisp, and the inside is soft with a slightly sweet taste. Perfect (or it will be next time when I don't knead it so much)!

This is an absolutely AMAZING whole-wheat bread recipe. I didn't have molasses so I used agave nectar. (Healthier!) and it turned out splendidly. I also added the sugar to the yeast and water (before reading the reviews, how funny) instead of later. Oh! And I used fresh yeast and doubled the amount, as you tend to need to with it. I also couldn't find the oats (I JUST put them away, too) and used sesame seeds instead. This bread is really adaptable!! Even with those changes it came out splendidly! Light airy crumb - a far cry from those dense logs of wheat I've made in the past. I think I too have to credit the three rises. This recipe will be saved for any ventures I ever plan again with whole-wheat bread. What a marvel! I think it would be amazing with chopped nuts in it or various other lovely additions. I plan on testing all my theories using this recipe! Thank you!

This is a wonderful bread recipe. I made it exactly as written but added a teaspoon of the sugar to the yeast to help it proof. Unlike other reviewers, I though the egg wash and oatmeal were absolutely worth doing...they added a crisp texture that contrasted to the bread and made a beautiful presentation when served uncut at a meal. I will make this bread again and again.

Great recipe and simple to follow. I used 3 c. wheat and 3 c. white flour and added the 2 T. sugar to the yeast/water mixture to activate the yeast as mentioned in a previous post. The multiple risings keep the bread light, unlike some wheat breads I have made in the past that turned out really dense. Next time I will cut down on the molasses as I don't like a "sugary" taste in my bread.

This has become a staple in my house. It's a healthy bread has almost a nutty flavor, and it's incredibly simple to make (it's one of the few recipes that I've been able to memorize...). I don't use the egg wash or oats - it's just more to do and extra ingredients that don't make any real difference to what this bread is. Great toasted in the morning for breakfast, great for a sandwich for lunch...

This is an excellent recipe. I live in Costa Rica where molasses is not available and so I substitute honey and use brown suguar instead of the white. Also I substitute the oatmeal topping with a mix of seeds: sesame, poppy, pumpkin, fennel and caraway. Finally, I sometimes make rolls by dividing into 32 Pcs.

I'm a novice bread baker, and with this recipe I turned out two beautiful loaves. I used a combination of wheat and bread flour, honey instead of molasses, no egg wash, and I free-formed the loaves and baked on a pizza stone. The results were two delicious, tender loaves that surpassed my expectations. I can't wait to try it with all whole-wheat.

I like this bread well enough, but the egg wash and oats just made a mess - it stuck to the pans and the oats fell off and got everywhere, and they don't add to the taste. The rising process is long (3 times!) but makes a very nice texture. I used all molasses, instead of some sugar. I like the fig and fennel bread on this site, but that one's harder to get to rise, so it ends up very dense.

Rating: 4
I've made this recipe at least seven times. The first few times it came out too dense. By letting it rise for longer than the 1 hour specified for the first rising and keeping it in a warmer place (in the oven around 170 degrees) it turns out wonderfully. The best loaves yet had organic whole wheat BREAD flour, honey, and NO egg wash/oats. I have doubled the recipe to great results- better than ever!

From a yeast-impaired baker, I can tell you that this is foolproof. With one exception. I always add a little molasses (or other sweetener) to the warm water to activate the yeast. Otherwise, my yeast doesn't bubble the way the recipe describes. This bread disappears as quickly as cookies in my house

I'm so happy I found this recipe. I made it the other day and it's so good! I'll make my own loaf from now on. I twirked the recipe a bit because I didn't have molasses in my kitchen. I used brown sugar instead. I also substituted one cup of whole wheat for all purpose flour. I even added a tablespoon of powdered milk. I topped the loafs with sesame seeds. I must say, it turned out well. Thank you for sharing this recipe :-)

I make a lot of bread, and I'm always on the lookout for recipes that my 15-year-old vegan son will eat. This recipe is an excellent starting point. The first time, I made it without any changes other than omitting the egg wash on top before baking. Be patient with giving this dough time to rise--the lack of white flour means it will take more time. The finished bread has a very fine texture, velvety almost like pumpernickel. It makes incredible toast. The second time, I incorporated some of the changes suggested by other reviewers. I replaced some of the whole wheat flour with 1/2 cup wheat germ and used only 1/4 c oil. Next time I'll tinker with it some more. One of the other reviewers suggested using some cornmeal, and that sounds good. That's the nice thing about a good yeast bread recipe--you can customize to your own taste.

I normally have little luck with yeast breads but this bread came out wonderfully. Maybe it's the 3 risings. This bread is really delicious - especially considering how healthy it is! I changed the recipe a bit based on some of the suggestions: used 1 cup oats, .5 cup bran and .5 cup wheat germ in the first mixture. I also substituted honey and brown sugar for the sweetners and butter for the vegetable oil. Mine took a long time to rise even though my home is quite warm.

As someone who does not typically enjoy wheat bread I have to say this was terrific. Even my kids, who seem to have an aversion to anything that might be even remotely healthy, thought this was a tasty bread. This one is a keeper.

I combined this with a 100 year old recipe for whole wheat bread I've been using & it's what I make now. I use milk instead of water (more flavor) as in my original recipe, 1/3 cup molasses & eliminate the sugar, & I use 1/4 cup butter & 1/4 lard instead of oil as in the original recipe. The amount of fat is minor as it's for a whole loaf & it adds a lot of flavor.

Rating: 4
This is an excellent 100% whole wheat bread recipe. Usually I make a half white, half wheat bread for a less heavy loaf, but I'll be making this one from now on. I reduced the oil to 1/4 cup, used 1/4 cup brown sugar in place of molasses (next time I'll try honey), and left out the additional sugar. I added about 2 Tbs. more water to make up for the reduced liquid. Also added 1/2 cup stone ground cornmeal. Very good!

I discovered this recipe when it first came out on Gourmet. I used it to christen my brand new KitchenAid mixer. I love the texture. Usually homemade whole-grain breads are tough and chalky. This bread is moist, chewy, and soft. It's hard to believe it's 100% whole grain. I have used canola, peanut, and light olive oil, all with equal success. I have used the oats for topping, as well as a plain egg wash. I have made it in loaf pans, but I prefer to bake it free-form on a pizza stone. Tonight, upon my husband's request, I took one of the loaves, made a split down the middle and put butter. That was a great move! The bread toasts well, and it's wonderful with peanut butter. It makes great tuna and chicken salad sandwiches as well. A wonderful recipe all around.

This was a pretty good and easy bread. Next time I'll try using some brown sugar to enhance the flavor, and maybe toss in some sunflower and pumpkin seeds into the dough for some textural interest.

This bread has a nice texture, although I found the flavor to be a bit bland. I increased the sugar to 4 Tablespoons raw sugar. I also "pre-heated" my microwave for about 30 seconds and let the dough rise in there and it didn't take as long as some of the other reader's had mentioned. Used the Kitchen-Aid to knead it for 6 minutes and used two miniature loaf pans that produced 11 little loaves. (350* oven for 16 minutes) Next time I may substitute and use 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup canola oil instead of all canola to see if that enhances the flavor.

Rating: 4
So good! I've made this recipe three times now. The rising time is always double what the recipe says, and even then, it doesn't rise as much as you'd expect. Don't let that discourage you. The loaves still turn out nicely shaped, and it is truly the best tasting wheat bread I've ever had!!

This is very yummy bread! I didn't think it would be that great from the ingredient list but since the reviews were so good I thought I'd try it. Must be the molasses. It was great! I've been using my bread machine lately to make dough but did this one by hand and it was so easy I might just shelve the machine for good. I made half a recipe and used whole wheat pastry flour (didn't have any regular whole wheat flour) and baked it free form on a cookie sheet/stone. Next time I think I'll try rolls.

I love this recipe. I bake it weekly. After making it several times, I decided to try some changes to make it even more healthy. I reduced the oil to 1/4 cup, and eliminated the sugar. The bread did not suffer at all. In fact, I like the texture even better now. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I did not think it needed the extra sugar. I also top with wheat germ instead of oats. I grind my own grain w/ my Kitchenaid grain mill attachment. This not only adds to the health of the bread, but makes it fresher and tastier, in my opinion. (Also cheaper!) I use my Kitchenaid to mix and knead the bread as well. This is a very forgiving recipe, and adapts well to additions/changes.

This is wonderful! I've been making bread for years (whole grain), and this is the best recipe I've found - it's dense and soft with wonderful flavor. I've done several things to change it which have made it easier and work better: I warm the 2 cups water to no more than 105 degrees (Tassajara Bread Book says any hotter and the yeast is pushed and gets "tired"), then I whisk the yeast and molasses into the water all in the same glass measuring cup and let it sit for 5 minutes. The other modification (suggested by Laurel's Kitchen Bread Book) is to combine the flour, salt & sugar in a big bowl and make a deep well in the middle. Then I pour in the yeast/molasses/water and oil into the well and start stirring from the middle out - very simple and effective. When I can't stir it any more, I dump it out onto the table and start kneading. I also warm a big ceramic bowl with hot water and put the dough in that near the furnace to rise. I do find that it takes twice as long to rise as the recipe says. It makes great bread.

This is wonderful bread--I have made it several times and love the flavor and texture. The only changes I make are baking the loaves free form on a baking stone and prefer to top with toasted wheat germ rather than oats. Great recipe!

I live on this bread. I bake it every week, sometimes more often. Its nice and dense, won't squish out, but still tender with a chewy crust. Fabulous with peanut butter - I eat it every morning! My husband loves it too, despite being "wholesome." I have streamlined the process a little: I use olive oil instead of regular, quick rise yeast and bit of extra sugar, mix it up in the Kitchenaid, split it directly into two greased pans, and rise it once in a warmed oven, no egg wash, then bake. It takes ten minutes to mix, and I don't even have to be home while it rises, that's what makes it a practial everyday bread. It keeps well for about three days airtight at room temp, and freezes perfectly. And so good - I can never go back to store-bought!

Wonderful, dense bread--be prepared for really hearty 100% whole wheat. Rich, dense texture and good flavor, plus it can be made with things you have in the pantry. Finally, you can feel nice & virtuous about the whole wheat! . . . OK, so I've made this twice now, and I prefer the version I made with honey instead of molasses, and 1 extra TBS of sugar (offsets the heaviness, I think). Both times I forgot the egg wash & oats--still the best dang bread I've ever made (and I make bread about once/week)!

This was a great hit w/ all our friends!!!! Very easy and fun to make. In the end I used approx. 4 1/2 c. flour and 1 1/2 was whole wheat the other was a Hi-Gluten flour, wow it ROSE!!!! Will definately make again and recipe makes MORE than enough!!!!!!!!!!!

Loved this bread. Not difficult to make. The molasses I used was expecially dark, so it turned out very dark. It was light and chewy with a nice texture. Next time I make this, I may add a small amount of oats to it since I liked the oats on the crust so well.

This was my first attempt at making a yeast bread. I am so glad I did it. It was so easy and came out perfectly... Crisp on the outside and soft in the middle. I didn't have molases so I used honey. I have a thing with fat so I used melted light margarine instead of the oil. It came out delicious. My husband who doesn't eat wheat breads (he doesn't like the texture) loved this and had more. Proof he wasn't just being nice. I can't wait to make this again!!!

I think this bread came out as intended--it rose well, browned nicely on the crust, and stayed moist inside. Still, my boyfriend and I were not big fans--the texture is just too brittle. I was skeptical about a bread made entirely with whole wheat flour . . . oh well. If you like your bread a bit chewey and light, this recipe is probably not for you.

This bread was excellent. The flavor was beyond compare, the crust was spectacular and the texture was moist and soft. I made a few changes to the recipe though. First, I found I was out of molasses so I used malt barley syrup in it's place which I keep on hand for making bagels (Wow, this recipe would make fantastic bagels!!!), I threw in about 1 cup of harvest style grains to give it some crunch, and I made it overnight. In the evening, I mixed up the dough, kneaded it, and left it in the fridge to rise. In the morning, I finished it off. It worked fantastically. I'll be making this bread regularly.

This bread was excellent and pretty easy to make. I used the rapid rise yeast and peanut oil. This was my first time I used rapid rise yeast and it really does cut down on the rising time. The bread has a great taste and is not to heavy, I will definitely make it again.

WOW! This bread was really easy and it tasted amazing, and it smelled fab. The recipe made two glorious loaves that were devoured in two and a half days I'm working on my next batch as we speak. It turned out terrific. I will cherish this recipe and make it on a regular basis. For the person whose bread was dense did you knead for 8 mins by machine or hand, because the machine is much more powerful than we are. Chances are that you worked over worked your dough and the more glutten you have the denser/ heavier the bread. Mine was soft and flavourful. YUMMY!!!!

I don't know what happened here. All was going well, the dough looked good, smelled good, rose properly. Then I baked it for the specified amount of time and yet it was nowhere near done in the center. I put it back in the oven for 15 minutes more...still raw. 15 more minutes...didn't even seem to make any progress whatsoever. By this time I just got frustrated and threw it away. I don't know where I went wrong, none of the other reviewers seemed to have this problem. Urgh!!

This is a very straightforward recipe, especially as it was my first time baking bread. I put the loaves directly on a stone. The bread turned out very dense (like pumpernickel) but good. It seemed to lack a certain depth in taste (maybe needed more salt?) I liked the other readers idea of putting in fresh rosemary. I may add caraway next time. A good basic recipe to tinker with.

Well, being a dufus, I ended up using half all purpose flour, since I didn't "have plenty" of the whole wheat flour. Despite that, it is incredible bread. Very flavorful, perfect texture, devoured by all. I used walnut oil instead of canola since I actually knew I didn't have any canola oil.

I changed recipe and used 2 cups of all purpose flour instead of the full 4-6 cups whole wheat flour. I found this to be a flavorful bread with a good texture. It is a sticky dough but firms up as it is kneaded with more flour.
