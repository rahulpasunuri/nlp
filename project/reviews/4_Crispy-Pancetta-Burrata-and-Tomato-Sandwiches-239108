This sandwich is AMAZING, and it is absolutely worth it to find the burrata. However, I used bacon instead of pancetta and I don't think the addition of pancetta is worth the money. This sandwich is expensive enough with all of the other ingredients. Make it in late summer when the tomatoes are at their best and you won't be disappointed!

So delicious. My dad was even impressed. Works just fine with Goat cheese or mozzarella.

I have to say this is a great rendition of a BLT. I took the some of the tomato marinade and added it to some mayonnaise with black pepper. This helped add a bit of moisture and helps cut the salty pancetta.

I wanted to make this ever since it was on the cover but I don't get what all the fuss was about. A normal BLT is better.

Delicious combination! Great as written, also good with goat cheese

Great sandwich. I used the Burrata and it is fabulous. It really needs to be at room temp to spread. I wouldn't change a thing.

This was way too salty for me. Way, way too salty. Of course, it's possible I had an unusually salty type of pancetta. Next time, I will really cut back on what gets added to the tomato mixture. Other than that, this was a good taste combination and it was simple.

I was able to actually make this with Burrata I found at Bristol Farms. This was, hands down, the best sandwich I've ever made. I used Pan Rustique bread and it was just as good. I also used a bit of the tomato "sauce" to spread on the other side of the bread and it made it soft, juicy, and heavenly. I served this to a friend one night for dinner with tomato soup. Amazing! Do try to find Burrata - there is nothing like it in the world and it made this sandwich...

This was a wonderful BLT twist...it had the right amount of salt and crunch and it was a great way to use a good summer tomato.

These were the HIT of our annual trip to Napa with dear friends! The burrata and brioche were both found at Sunshine Foods in St. Helena California!

I also could not find burrata, even at my fancy urban grocery store, and used fresh mozzeralla instead, but it was still wonderful.

Who knew anything could be better than a BLT? Was delicious with fresh mozzarella, could't find burrata.

Fantastic! Like others, I had trouble finding burrata (though I've had it before and LOVE it). But bufala mozzarella was an easy substitution and was delicious! I used homemade bread, which kicked it up a notch, but even without that, it would have been fabulous.

I made this with mozzarella because I just could not find burrata, but it was still very yummy. Try it on focaccia bread. Delicious!

Definitely the best BLT I've ever had. I, too, used fresh mozz - a no brainer substitute.

The minute this issue came in the mail I knew I had to recreate the cover! The sandwiches were as fantastic as they looked! Had no access to burrata, so I thin- sliced fresh mozzerella as a substitute.
