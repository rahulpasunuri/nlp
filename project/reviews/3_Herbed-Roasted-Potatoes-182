I make this dish with fresh rosemary. It's wonderful.

Good this way, but tastier with fresh herbs! Just increase the amounts to 1 "heaping" teaspoon of each fresh herb. Equally good with red-skinned potatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces!

I've already made this several times. I used purchased mixed dried herbs (veggie blend) and I tossed the potatoes with all the olive oil and then sprayed the pan with cooking spray. Tried them with skins off and on, they're good both ways! Great with a sandwich for a light meal.
