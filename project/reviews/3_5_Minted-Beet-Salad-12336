This is delicious! I get in a rut with vegetables, and the beets with the mint and balsamic is a taste treat. Just remember the next morning that you ate beets!

I love beets, and I love mint, but somehow I don't like them together. Maybe it was the texture of my mint leaves; I could still feel the fibrous/tough nature of the leaves, even after letting the salad sit to mellow.

I served this over arugula. It is really a strikingly beautiful salad with the ruby-color beets against the emerald color greens. Very nice. The taste was interesting as well.

I'm not even wild about the taste of beets, but I loved this recipe. The mint flavor really marries well with the beets. The others who shared this dish with me also loved it.
