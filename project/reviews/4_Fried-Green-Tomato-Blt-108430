Used our own green tomatoes and panko with cornmeal, and then used Semifreddi's seeded baguettes. We'd definitely make again.

This was DE-LICIOUS!!!! I must preface this by saying that it is September in LA and the farmer's markets are BURSTING with incredible juicy tomatoes. If tomatoes are not in season, skip this until then. I also took a previous reviewer's suggestion of making a simple garlic/mayo aioli and pan frying the pancetta and using that pan to fry the tomatoes. I needed to add a little extra oil to the pan to make it work, but I think the rendered fat from the pancetta gave it a nice extra flavor. Last, but not least, I served these along side the creamed corn recipe from Gourmet June 2008 and replaced the cream with milk. OH MY! My husband was practically in tears because this was so good! This was a perfect meal to an end of summer bounty.

This recipe is way more complicated than it needs to be. Keep it simple, with fresh (preferrably local!) ingredients and you'll never go wrong. How about... Roast some garlic cloves to mash and add to mayo to make a nice aioli. Next mix flour and cornmeal for your dredge. Mix two eggs and a bit of milk for an egg wash. The key is to cook your 'maters in the bacon grease. Dredge the tomato slices, put in the egg wash, dredge again. Fry. Compose sandwiches. Enjoy. Was that so difficult?

It's a bit of work, but even the kids loved it. Definitely serve with already prepped food if serving as an appetizer.

Okay...I just used the ingredients for the basil mayonnaise and then added it to a fried green tomato and bacon sandwich with arugula. But based on the combo of the mayo, tomattoes and bacon combo---WOW!!! My new favorite sandwich!!!

Oh my gosh! The best appetizer I've ever had. I serve it at almost all my summer dinner parties and people rave. If serving several courses, recommend using small tomatoes and cutting stack to about three layers. enjoy - fabulous!

This is a preparation intensive dish if you don't organize your ingredients (and order of assembly) well. If you're hostessing AND cooking for a dinner party, I recommend you limit the rest of the menu to things you can make ahead of time. Make the basil mayonnaise in advance. (you can halve the recipe to make an appetizer for six people, and I used low fat mayonnaise) I cut the bacon slices in half to make final assembly easier, and fried it instead of baking. (you can then use a portion of the bacon grease to fry the green tomatoes). In addition, I limited the stack, using baby arugula (milder) as the base... then a thick slice of a ripe red or yellow tomato, a smear of the basil mayo, 3 half strips of bacon, the hot fried green tomato, and a dollop of basil mayo on the top. In spite of its humble origins this is a luxurious looking (and tasting) dish - salty and tangy, hot and cold, spicy and fresh. Fabulous!

I don't understand the enthusiasm of previous reviewers. This is OK, but it's quite a lot of work for just OK.

I had this at our supper club last week and I am going to make it for a BBQ tomorrow. It is a fantastic dish with a great presentation!

It was just the two of us, so I dumbed it down a bit. Made the basil mayo, the pancetta, and the fried green tomatoes, and used them with some red heirloom tomatoes and sliced country bread to make the most extraordinary BLT sandwich ever!

This is an outstanding recipe. Very fresh tasting. Wonderful basil mayonnaise. The only comment is that it stacks very high and is filling. If using as an appetizer, you might want to create a smaller stack

Great summer appetizer. Easy to make and great flavor with the tart green tomatoes and sweet ripe ones. I'll definitely make this one again. They stack pretty high, so they need to be eaten using a fork and knife.
