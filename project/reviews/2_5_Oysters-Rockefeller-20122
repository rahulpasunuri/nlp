Not a fan. I should have used the more recent Bon Appetit recipe.

I was a little worried about trying this one as it had not yet received any ratings or reviews but it came out delicious. I picked it over the other rockefeller recipes because it seemed the simplest. I used reduced fat sour cream. I like things really garlicky, so I added about 5 cloves of chopped garlic to the spinach mixture. I didn't have Pernod- added a splash of Marsala wine instead.
