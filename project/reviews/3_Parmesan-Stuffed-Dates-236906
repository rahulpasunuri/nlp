I have served this for numerous parties from small gatherings to bridal showers. It has always been a hit. People can't believe something so simple could be so decadent. Since I am girl always watching her pennies I have always gone with the most inexpensive parmesan and it is has never failed me.

I find the reviews that others have written so helpful. I followed the suggestion of an earlier reviewer and wrapped the stuffed dates in Proscuitto. Then I baked the dates in a 300 oven for about 10 minutes until the cheese softened and the proscuitto crisped. They were absolutely delicious. Very rich, but wonderful. One other good thing, these can be made the day ahead and baked when needed. One more note, I skipped the oil and arugula.

Thanks to the earlier review that suggested wrapping the date in proscuitto! Wonderful suggestion. The sweet/salty combo was delicious. I skipped the oil and greens and baked the dates about 10 min in a 300 oven until the proscuitto crisped. I loved how easy these were. I will definitely make these again. Also, I had some extra that I stored unbaked in a tupperware in the fridge. These can definitely be made ahead of time.

Not sure what didn't go right considering these reviews, but the sweetness of the dates completely over-powered the other flavors. Definitely needs the parma or bacon as suggested by another reviewer to balance out the sweetness. But, since I am vegetarian, that was a no go. I will probably try these flavors again... with adjustments that will mean a lot less sweet and more savory per bite.

Was making these for a party the other night...one of my guests suggested that I wrap them with parma ham before baking ....skipping the oil and greens...And, boy they were amazing! Next time I would make these little bundles in the A.M. then bake in a 300 oven for 10 min.'s 'til warmed through.

I make somethng very similar which is always a big hit at parties. The only difference is that I don't slit the dates (pit with forceps,) and I skip the greens/olive oil. Then I heat them until the cheese just starts to melt and serve while still warm. I can never make enough to have them last the whole cocktail hour. Always use excellent quality cheese and Medjool dates.

Wonderful! A great flavor combination of sweet, chewy dates with the dry, salty cheese. So easy and delicious!

I made this along with the Elegant Endives and I thought it was a nice combination for appies. It was also easy to re-heat since our guests were late!

This was tasty but not a crowd pleaser. Half the dates were left uneaten. Next time I might try figs.
