A standard in our recipe box. Absolutely delicious. Do not skimp on the herbs.

We enjoyed the relative "lightness" of the dish along with warm comfort of a roast chicken. The sweet and savory components were excellent with each other. Definitely worth making again. Next time I will make sure I get a crispier skin on the chicken.

I used dried figs instead of prunes and it turned out great. Use the whole cabbage not half so there is enough cabbage to go around. Also, I used a cut up chicken rather than whole one which was much easier to serve when finished. Finally, one of the reviews said there might not be enough sauce so I put 1 and 1/2 cups of chicken broth. I had way too much sauce! If I did it again, I would use 1/2 cup or 3/4 cup of chicken broth (less not more!).

This was really tasty, and my sweetie and I, who are trying to lose weight, felt very virtuous. I used thighs - there was practically no chicken in all of town! and sage from my sage bush in lieu of thyme, which I was out of. I didn't use garlic as our guest is allergic, and I bought a pricey Riesling. Like others, I used just one pan, which made serving & clean up a breeze. My sweetie commented about the individuality of the flavors (not something he'd ordinarily notice). I'll certainly make this again.

I have made this at least 20 times. Anybody who says the flavor is "underwhelming" did NOT follow the recipe. And the dude who threw a pre-cooked Costco chicken in with some veggies and "thickened broth" - just go eat at McDonalds, you are killing me. For those who don't like the mess of frying, here is a simpler way to get the same result: in your large final cooking pot, BROWN the veggies. (that is where some of the flavor comes from - Hello??) Toss them out into a bowl and use the same pot to BROWN the chicken (same reason for browning). Toss the veggies back in around the chicken and add the rest of the ingredients and put it in the oven. This saves a pot to clean, the chicken splatters less in a taller pot, and the "browned bits" are already in the bottom of the pot and do not need to be scraped up using the wine/broth and then thrown into the pot. I never have enough sauce....we eat every bit on the chicken or some potatoes.

Very Good; I only used 8 prunes and next time I will only put in 6 prunes.

I was really excited to try this recipe as it got such amazing reviews. I followed it exactly and found the sauce very thin and the flavor underwhelming. I will not be making this again.

I completely agree with the reviewer from Boston and Paris that the basic steps of browning the chicken and the ingredient of wine is essential in this recipe. I do use variations, but this recipe calls for these steps. Otherwise, it is really not the classic recipe, and something else, altogether (which is fine if that is what you want, but will not have the same flavor as this recipe) Having said that, this recipe is sublime. This is the kind of thing that professional chefs love to eat when not cooking, as it is rather direct and speaks to the quality of a few ingredients to create something authentic and delicious. Highly recommended.

This is a very classic recipe and it lends it self to some flexibility, BUT it does rely on some basic classic techniques - not difficult but necessary for the results. The reason ingredients are seasoned and browned separately is to create layered flavors. If you are not going to bother, you may as well use a crockpot :)

Very easy. Very tasty. I just used chicken stock instead of wine. and i used chicken chucks. You could prob skip browning em if you used skinless and put em under a layer cabbage.

This is now my standby chicken recipe and I keep dried prunes on hand just to make it. I served it at a dinner party and the guests were salivating from the aroma when they entered the house. I have used whole chicken and chicken pieces without any difference. I do tie the herbs into a bundle for easy extraction and I find that Savoy cabbage has the best flavor. It works better if you uncover the pot at the end of cooking and then roast for another 20-30 minutes; the chicken browns and the sauce reduces. You have to spoon the sauce over the cabbage a couple of times while cooking uncovered so it doesn't brown too much though. Otherwise follow the recipe exactly. Absolutely delicious.

This is a wonderful recipe. I used 2 lbs of chicken breast instead of whole chicken - much easier!

I've been making this since it first appeared in the magazine, and it is now my go-to roasted chicken recipe. I don't always use riesling, but whichever white wine I have on hand. Riesling is the best, but it is still delicious, simple, and well worth any mess caused by frying. The only quibble is that the roasting always seems to take more than an hour.

This was a bit tricky to make, but the results were wonderful. I served this to a group of 10 and it had everyone raving. It was incredibly juicy and flavorful.

Nice warming winter meal. Although there is some prep time involved, once its in the oven you can sit back, relax and know you have a wonderful meal in the making.

This is the best dish I've made from this site--and I've made several dozen--and one of the best dishes I've ever made. Highly recommended for a delicious, fortifying, healthy meal. We used Mark Bittman's recipe for spaetzle found on the New York Times website. He gives a great, straightforward method and that was the perfect accompaniment.

Made this entire menu (except for dessert) for a dinner party and it was amazing. I didn't use a whole chicken, but cut up breasts and threw in some drumsticks. I also browned my vegetables and chicken in the same pot I cooked them in (my 8 quart dutch oven). Make sure you really use exceptional wine too -- it makes all the difference. All of our guests loved this dish - the prunes and cabbage really went well together and the chicken was wonderfully moist and tender. Simple, healthy food!

Delicious and well received. I followed the recipe as is except increased the browning time for the chicken. It gave the finished dish more color and helped to hold the skin together for carving. I served it over steamed basmati rice to hold the juices in.

I love cabbage and I love prunes so when I read the recipe I knew I couldn't go wrong. TO THE COOK FROM DENVER,CO.(03/16/06): Please read ahfisher's comment from Montreal Canada (05/16/06). Asparagus with bacon was a part of the original menu where this recipe came from.

I found this dish overwhelmingly oily. The flavor was just alright. My (German)mother-in-law had made a rabbit with dried apricots and prunes and it was unbelievably delicious, so I thought I'd try this. Not a hit at all. Even my husband (who eats everything) was not thrilled. Sorry, won't be making this again.

To: thejoker from SF Bay Area - Sauteing the veggies and chicken first is to create caramelization, the secret to all flavor in any recipe. Had you followed the recipe exactly I'm sure your results would have been more satisfactory.

Delicious! Wonderful flavors. However, didn't care for the loose cooked herbs that needed fishing out of the sauce before plating. Next time, I will tie them up in a bundle for easier extraction.

Just reading this recipe I knew it would be good. The flavors of the herbs, garlic, prunes and wine were a perfect marriage with the chicken and vegetables. I served it with the asparagus with bacon (also part of the original menu) and some basmati rice. Best of all, the prep time isn't outrageous, especially considering the result. I am planning to make this at my next dinner party and I'm sure it will be a big hit!

Cooked vegetables first then added Costco rotisserie chicken and thickened chicken broth at the end. Fast and delicious.

Yum. This was simply fantastic. I used one pot for all the cooking so prep time was minimal. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the sauce was yummy and beautifully thickened. Like magic-- straight out of the pot! This would be great for a dinner party.

very tasty and easy. the cabbage was not too much for those skeptical of it, not too little for those who like it. i added more veggies and some extra drumsticks since i was serving a larger group. adjusted the other ingredients accordingly. easy to modify.

I served this last night at dinner for 4. (I agree that there are 4 servings.) I made two changes, which I'd do again: doubled the # of carrots and used 2 whole heads of garlic (and tossed the really small cloves). Next time I would double the amount of cabbage, which probably necessitates putting some of the cabbage in before the chicken. If the cabbage is under the chicken, however, maybe it'll disintegrate. I did not get the point of pre-frying the veggies or the chicken. (Can someone enlighten me?) That's why it gets 2 forks and not 3 forks; frying is really messy. Another reason it gets 2 forks is that there weren't enough veggies. I did put in some extra cabbage but because it was high in the pot some of it stuck to the side of the pan and burned. As I used a whole can of chicken broth, I might've ended up with more juice than most (I had 2 cups). Probably the juice is what keeps the chicken so moist. Next time, I'd double the # of prunes, herbs, and lemon peel. I can never figure out how to serve whole birds, so I cut up the chicken, putting it in one dish (with a small amount of juice poured on top) and put the veggies in another dish, removing the stalks of the herbs. Finally, the cooked chicken I served looked nothing like the beautifully browned chicken in the photo.

I'm confused, I do not see cabbage or celery in the picure but asparagus which is not even listed.

Fantastic flavor! I used only two heads of garlic and added more carrots and celery. Served it with the herbed spaetzle that's part of this menu. A word of caution though: the garlic and shallot combination is quite potent, intestinally speaking. Make sure you sleep next to someone who loves you the night you serve it!

I loved the garlicky taste in every bite. This was a fantastic recipe.

Wonderfully tender and flavorful meal; loved the natural gravy the dish provided. I used a larger chicken and it did take a little longer to cook, but well worth the effort involved in browning the chicken prior to putting it in the oven.
