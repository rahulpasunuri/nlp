Any thoughts on whether this is 8 for a main or 8 for a starter or what? It is part of a buffet so am curious about scaling. Thanks

I scaled this down for one, with a few very minor changes. I made a quick stock out of the shrimp shells and tails (cover with water, a few good pinches of salt, and 4-5 peppercorns. This only takes 5-10 minutes and makes the dish taste so much richer than using water would). I also added some finely minced celery (from the inner ribs), and fresh chopped parsley, and the tiniest squeeze of lemon. I used much less butter in the initial saute, and finished the sauce with a tablespoon of butter at the end. Served it on grits. It was great, though I would probably leave out the garlic next time, or add just a pinch of garlic powder. I love garlic, but I thought it was a little overpowering in this dish.

I made this for brunch this morning. I cannot believe how wonderful and simple this dish is. We ate it with grits and there wasn't a drop left.

This was very good but would substitute bottled clam juice for water to make it a little richer. And to the cook from Fl, Hominy Grill is in Charleston, SC, NOT Savannah and they serve a wide variety of dishes that don't contain shrimp.

???? Duh - it is a shrimp recipe. Has anyone made this recipe, yet?

This morning inspired by the latest issue of Gourmet January 2008, all about southern cooking. I fixed Cre amy Stone-Ground Grits and Low Country Breakfast Shrimp (page 77). I, of course, replaced the Shrimp with tomatoes. The grits are made with half water, half milk, and some butter. Instead of stone ground grits I use Bobs Red Mill Corn Grits they are located in the organic section of your grocery store. For the Low Country Breakfast Shrimp I substituted 3 Roma tomatoes for the shrimp. The dish turned out spectacularly. I have always wanted to go to the Hominy Grill in Savannah, but I dont eat shrimp. This was a perfect substitute. Thanks Gourmet for the inspiration!
