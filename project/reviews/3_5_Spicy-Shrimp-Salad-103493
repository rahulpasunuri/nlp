This was excellent! I didn't have any peppers so omitted them. I used 1 tsp Old Bay and tasted and thought it was enough. I think 1 1/2 tsp would have been too salty, but I'm not a big salt fan. Will make this a lot over the summer...

Fabulous and so easy to make!! I did add a little cayene and the amount of heat was perfect.

DELICIOUS! My DH literally called it "da bomb," because he is stuck in 1992. I increased the Old Bay by 1/2 tsp and added some cayenne but forgot to add the lemon juice. It didn't matter. It was great anyways! Chilled for 1.5 hours, alternating freezer and fridge, then put this on a sub roll with lettuce and tomato.

This was a hit with my family. I did what everyone else did and added some lemon juice and quite a lot of cayenne. Because my husband thinks it's not a real shrimp salad without avocado, I added that as well. It would also be delicious with chipotle pepper powder to give a slightly smoky flavor, perhaps grilling the shrimp beforehand.

Good standard to have in the recipe box. Like others I added a bit of lemon juice and some cayenne. Also, included 1 cup of macaroni.

So glad I made this! I followed the adjustment of the reviewer below who increased the old bay, added some cayenne and lemon juice, and served it on endive leaves. Huge hit at my New Years day dinner.

My family loves this salad. I serve it on crusty rolls for a special treat on our long trip up to our Maine cottage. It's a special way to begin our vacation. Sometimes I substitute lobster for the shrimp. Yum!

I love this recipe. I've made it for my family as a quick lunch on our trip to a summer cottage in Maine for years now. It's like the beginning of special things to come. Sometimes I replace the shrimp with lobster. Color, tasty and a special treat, who could ask for more????

Similar to other reviewers, I thought this recipe was a very good start, but added a few squeezes of lemon juice, a couple dashes of tabasco and substituted some leftover corn for the celery. Definitely let the salad set up in the fridge for half a day or more. I think this one is great in a lettuce leaf wrap or endives, but also does well as a sort of burrito if you add a little cilantro, wrap it up in a warm flour tortilla and lightly fry with some olive oil.

As written, not very exciting, only a 2-forker. But, very easily jazzed up; I sauteed the shrimp after generously seasoning with my cajun spice, and I added a touch of tabasco to the mayo.

a great variation to this is to substitute some capers for the celery and add a litle cider vinegar to the mayo. actually its great on a triscut cracker.

This was terrific! We served it with fresh back yard tomatoes and it was a hit. It really helps to let it sit for at least a couple of hours

I originally tasted a similar recipe a year ago, but could not track it down. When I tried this recipe, it definitely did not meet my expectations, so I jazzed it up a little. Instead of 1 1/2 tsp Old Bay, I used 2 1/2 teaspoons, plus 1/8 tsp black pepper, 1/8 tsp ground cayenne pepper, and 1 Tbsp fresh squeezed lemon juice. Much Better! I received lots of compliments.

Good...worth the few minutes involved in preparation. Do the day before to allow seasonings to blend. Increase the dressing proportions to accomodate the salad.

While I like this recipe and would make it again, I don't love it as is. I found it just a little too salty, probably from the Old Bay Seasoning. It did have just the right amount of heat so I'm not sure how to go about altering the recipe. If I add more mayo or cut down on the seasoning, it might be too bland. Any thoughts?

I love Old Bay Seasoning, so this was a big hit! I bought pre-cooked, deveined shrimp at the seafood market to save time. I don't like celery, so I substituted peeled and seeded cucumber. This would make a lovely luncheon dish stuffed in a big summer tomato - yum!

This was an acceptable dish. I would suggest, though, that if you're going to take the time to clean & boil shrimp and chop vegetables, you make a more satisfying recipe.

This is a delicious shrimp salad. Next, I want to try it in a sandwich.
