This turned out great! The yogurt sauce was delicious and my veggies were roasted perfectly. I did use the recommended eye of round to preserve the healthier intentions of this dish. I'll definitely make this one again.

I used a larger cut of beef than the recipe called for, so I seared it in a Dutch oven first, then added veggies and put it in the oven for 2 1/2 hours. So tender and flavorful, and the horseradish sauce is delicious. My veggies got a little overdone, so next time I will add them later. We will definitely make this one again.

I tried this recipe last night. I used a 3lb center round. I wish I saw the previous review first. Sounds like a good idea to sear the meat on high and then cook for longer at lower heat. I cooked using a meat thermometer to 145 F. It took about 90 minutes with oven at 450 F. Wished I had pulled it out earlier, probably 135 F would have been good. It was slightly past pink after letting it sit for 5 min. It was still quite tasty and easy to do. Don't forget to use the sauce. It definitely needs a little extra flavor. We used the horseradish sauce, very good. My son used Barbecue sauce and was happy.

This was wonderful! I added onions to the vegetables. Since my roast was 3 lbs, I roasted it at 450 degrees for 15 minutes and then 285 degrees for about an other hour until it was med-rare. I did use a eye of round roast. Not as tender as a tenderloin but still very good. The sauce is also very good. Not too hot!

My dining companion took one bite of this beef and declared it to be "The Poor Man's Prime Rib". It was tender and delicious, however I did a couple of thing different. I used a 2lb eye of round and roasted it at 450 for 15 minutes, then reduced the temp to 250 and continued roasting until internal temp reached 140 degrees. About 1-1/2 hrs total. I put the vegetables in the oven about 10 minutes ahead of the roast to give them some extra time at the higher heat. Everything was great. This will be a favorite.

I won't rate this recipe because I have not tried it. I am wondering if anyone has tried this as written with eye of round roast. Eye of round is a much different cut of meat than tenderloin which the previous reviewer used.

I made this last night and it was very good. The prep time is very short (I didnt peel any of the vegetables) and the finished product is very good. I used beef tenderloin and added more rosemary than the recipe calls for, really just because I had it on hand. I usually dont care for horseradish sauce over beef but this was a very good addition to the dish, try not to skip it.
