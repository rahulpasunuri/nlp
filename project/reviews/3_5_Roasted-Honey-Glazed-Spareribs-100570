This dish was great! I put these in the oven at 275 for about an hour then 350 for an hour. Because of the last review, I put a piece of foil over the top and had no problems burning (of course it was in the oven). Topped them off on the grill for about 10 minutes. Everyone couldn't get enough of them.

Even though I watched these carefully they still came out completely burned with 30 minutes left to cook.

Wah!!!! I was so excited to make these ribs. I had a little taste of the marinade last night, and thought the ribs would be divine. Unfortunately, despite my following the recipe to the word, the ribs were D-R-Y and not too tender. I guess the flavor of the ribs is okay, but the taste is missing something- maybe some mustard, soy sauce. Something!

Great googly moogly this was tasty. I made it for about 200 college students. Granted, they would (and do) eat the paint off of the walls if they thought it would taste good...but I and my staff liked them and that is saying a lot. The sugars will burn if you put them straight on the grill...so I started in the oven...got kinda cooked and then finished the them on the grill...damn fine job if I do say so myself. Oh yeah, I used canned baked beans (remeber the 200 students thing) as a side and dropped a couple of shots of this blessed nectar in the pot to cook with the beans. The honey flavor just made it all come together perfectly. Cheap, fast, flavorful...they all love me now and do my bidding...thank you epicurious...this was better than a Jedi mind trick...

Aaaaaaa! What went wrong?! Tried to make these for my birthday as spareribs were his requested dinner. I marinated these as called for and cooked and basted accordingly and they came out like burnt charcoal brisquets! I lined my roasting pan with foil and the glaze still leaked onto the pan and made for a terrible clean-up. This was my first attempt with spareribs, but think I'd try something else next time.

Outstanding recipe! Definitely line the roasting pan with foil to help with the clean up. I substituted a 3 inch piece of fresh ginger, cut into pieces and smashed like the garlic. Also threw in some additional sparerib brisket pieces which are meatier. Would definitely make this recipe again.

OH MY! How GREAT was this recipe??!! I had a bbq with 6 close friends, and we "mmm"ed our way through the whole meal ... I used chicken instead of ribs, and will do it again. The best thing? I still had sauce left over!! .. what to make tonight? .. hmmm..

I'm giving this recipe 4 forks because my husband thought they were unbelieveable! He loved them! I didn't get a chance to try them since they were gone...I made them for a dinner party and everyone who had them enjoyed them very much. I was wondering if anyone had tried making them with the "Country-Style Spareribs". I think I may do that next time. I also agree with everyone else who said to line your pan with aluminum foil. It helped me with my clean up!

We enjoy these ribs, but need the sauce doubled (at least), so there is plenty of it. Also, cook at a lower temp. or not as long, as the sugars do start to burn. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil to avoid the burnt mess cleaning. I will definitely try it on the grill sometime.

My husband found the ribs weren't spicy enough. My Mother liked them. I found them to be spectacular. I will make them again! I made Emeril Lagasse's "Maw-Maw's slaw" and had some french fries with the meal. A cold beer with all that would be complete.

It is now a tradition to make these delicious ribs every New Year's Eve and 4th of July I have become famous to my family

Used boneless pork ribs the first time, chicken the second, we're undecided over which was the most delicious!! I never cook in the oven during summer, so these went on the grill both times. Certainly one of our favorites, and very quick to prepare.

This is our favorite recipe for ribs! About one hour at 350 is sufficient, turning half way through. Try this recipe with skinless chicken too.

My husband and I loved these ribs! Next time, I will cook it a little longer at a slightly lower temperature because after 1.5 hours the sugars were burning and it was difficult to clean the pan afterwards. Outstanding flavor!!!

I'm a big fan of ribs and this is perhaps my favorite "rib recipe."

Very tasty ribs. I marinated my racks in ziploc bags but they did leak so BE CAREFUL!! Nice flavor and pretty sweet. I didn't need to roast them the full 2 hours, though. The ribs and the pan got very dark after 1 and 3/4 hours so I took them out then. I used a heavy deep dark roasting pan which was non-stick but still a greasy mess to clean up. Still, this is an easy recipe that I would recommend to rib lovers.

An easy and very tasty recipe for ribs! Cut the recipe for marinade in half and used on one slab of spareribs and it was perfect. Produces a nice sweet-hot glaze and flavor.

These ribs are excellent, not too sweet, just right. I used Baby Back pork ribs. Cooking time is just right.
