This crust is delicious - my absolute favorite pie crusts.

Flaky and delicious! I used this crust for an apple pie and my guests loved it. I perhaps cheated a bit and rolled the dough out on wax paper, but this worked well since it had initially stuck to the counter too much. I had never made pie crust before and did end up using a cookie cutter to make some festive shapes that covered up where my crust had a bit of a seam and didn't look perfect, but the taste was phenomenal (and people thought the design on top was nice anyway).

FAB. Everyone loves this crust. I've used it on the Common Apple Pie and Sour Cherry Pie w/ Lattice Crust (both on Epi) - it's perfect for both.

This is a great and easy pie crust. You need more like 1/2 cup of buttermilk, but otherwise no change.

Fantastic Crust! Made it just as the recipe says...as I usually do the first time I make anything. I didn't need to change a thing. Rolled out perfectly for my apple pie and had pie lovers raving about it for days! They were all begging for the recipe. I will use this time and time again.

Far and away the best pie crust I have ever tried. I brushed the top with egg whites whisked with water, ans sprinkled with a sugar mix. Perfect.

I just made a savory meat pie using this excellent crust. Very, very tasty and so easy. I, too, used lard instead of vegetable shortening and increased the buttermilk by about 4 tablespoons or so. It was perfection! Buttery, flaky and SO delicious. I had enough dough leftover for another pie. It's a great thing to have on hand in the freezer. This is the best pie crust I've ever tasted.

This has become my staple pie crust. It is easy to make and roll out. My husband loves homemade pie crust, and this is his favorite. Just make sure to cover the edges with foil after they brown, or it will burn.

This is the first time I've ever tried making my own crust, but this recipe is nearly fool-proof! Just a few suggestions: 1) When using a food processor, pulse while adding the buttermilk just until the clumps form. 2) After rolling out the bottom crust, chill again in the pie mold while making your filling. The crust is flaky and light, and the bottom crust cooks perfectly. What a find!

Oh, yes! I have never made pie crust without a food processor before, and I was worried that it was a little lumpy, but it was really, really good. I may have to start making more pies.

I used this for the Black-Bottom Banana Cream Pie, and it was perfect. It was flaky and a perfect base for the pie. I will make this again.

Thank you to the reviewer who suggested using lard instead of veg. shortening. For years I've been looking for the perfect pie crust recipe; buttery, yet flaky, but I always ran into the problem of crisco. I just cannot put anything in my food that is made from ingredients I cannot identify, so my crust always lacked in the 'flaky' department. Until now! Subbed the shortening for lard and the result was the BEST pie crust ever. My search is over :)

Really delicious and relatively easy. I consider myself "pie crust challenged" and my husband is "pie crust efficianado". When rolling out, it was a little difficult to work with (again, I'm slightly challenged!), but when presented with the end result, my husband was extremely impressed. It had a good flavor, was flaky with just the right amout of crisp. Keeper!

I use this crust for all my pies. I always forget to add a bit more buttermilk, so I have a slightly crumbly dough and it is a bit of a challenge to roll. I know if I would adjust the buttermilk initially, it would be an easier dough to work with!

I halved the recipe to make one 9" crust. I prebaked the shell for about 5 minutes at 400 and then poured in the lemon buttermilk pie filling from this site. The pie was delicious and the crust was perfect - flaky, tender and tasty. Also, this crust recipe is amazingly simple to roll out. I would strongly recommend it to anyone who is phobic about making his own crust.

I used lard instead of vegetable shortening and doubled the buttermilk. The lard was in the refrigerated section. Excellent results. I used it for pecan and apple pies.

I am almost evangelical about this crust - I followed Stephen from NH's tips and added a bit more buttermilk and rolled it out between sheets of plastic wrap. Fabulous! I've had to eat a lot of my (English) mother-in-law's bad pies, so I should know!

I love this recipe. I added chopped fresh thyme to the dry ingredients and it wokred out really well. I doubled the salt, as I usually do for bread and dough recipes and it was perfect.

Fantastic crust, used it for a savory Italian Easter Pie (eggs, ricotta, ham, pepperoni, parmesan) very easy to handle, baked light and buttery. Everyone asked for the recipe.

Used regular short-crust pastry. Family stated, "This is a keeper". Always looking for new pie recipes and this one is different, easy to make and good.

This pie crust is delicious. It took a little more than 1/2 c. of buttermilk for mine to come together easily. I will use this as my standard pie crust.

I replaced the buttermilk with goat milk yogurt and made a mince pie, served it at Thanksgiving and people were raving. The 91 year old aunt said it was the best crust she'd ever tasted.

This makes an excellent pie crust with great texture and flavor. I also found the mix a little dry after refrigerating the dough so I added a bit more buttermilk. I find it easy to work with if you roll it out between sheets of plastic wrap.

I actually liked this dough alot and use it for most of my pies. The trick is to use more buttermilk and to not work the dough too much.

For the last few years I've been using this pie crust dough in almost all of my pies. I used this crust for my Thanksgiving pies and the crust tasted equally great in the apple, maple-pecan and maple-pumpkin. Take your time rolling out the crust as it tends to break apart. I cover the edges with foil from the beginning of the baking process and the crust always browns to perfection.

I hate having to give a recipe such a bad rating when everyone else loved it, but this crust ruined my apple pie, I didn't even want to serve it. It was very hard to work with and roll out, and was not very tasty.

This is a good and simple to follow recipe. Instead of the solid vegetable shortening, I used Philadelphia cream cheese which made it a good flaky crust.

I loved this. It was almost as good as moms. I had to add a little more moisture than called for and I made homemade buttermilk with milk and vinegar. This handled well and tasted great.

best pie crust I have ever made. Very flaky! I have been making it for 6 years after finding it in magazine.

This is a wonderful recipe that I will use over and over again. I tried it with the maple syrup pie and it was great. (You know the crust is going to be good when the dough tastes good!) The crust was light, flaky, and easy to make. Yummy!
