I've been making this recipe for years and still love it. Revisited it recently and was surprised to see it says to heat the oil over high heat. I always do med-high to medium, otherwise, it is difficult to manage without burning. the crispiness of the pasta is a nice change. Good, quick weeknight meal.

I made this today for a potluck, since I was pressed for time I did not fry the pasta as suggested as I had never heard of such a technique! Sounds fun! The dish got great reviews however, so next time I will fry the pasta!

Just a question - how do you toast pasta?

I really loved this pasta. I have only seen one other toasted pasta recipe, but it was one that my father learned in Italy. For that one you toast the raw pasta and then cook it by boiling it in broth for flavor. That is what I did with this and it turned out perfectly.

I did not fry the pasta, too many calories. I used a little oil for the pine nuts and sun dried tomatoes. Next time I might add a little chicken broth. Very easy. Great side dish!

I didn't like it. It had a mild taste of burnt which came from the pasta. Maybe my skillet was too hot... I'm not sure. I drizzled 1/3 cup half & half over it to moisten it up which made it edible. But I won't do this again.

I had trouble frying the pasta. It kept getting stuck to the pan, so I ended up using a lot of oil. Next time I'll have the tomatoes and pinenuts ready and toss the pasta in the pan at the very end. I'm sure I'll end up with a less oily dish.

Yum! Frying the pasta is amazing; I used a sharp fish spatula and that helped overcome the initial sticking...Perservere, and it will crisp up nicely! I added a couple of extra tablespoons of really, really, good olive oil to the final mix. It got RAVE reviews from my husband, who usually likes very saucy pasta. No changes whatsoever, which is almost unheard of from me! Very gourmet but not "weird".

I'm going to have to make this again because, unfortunately, I didn't get to eat any of it. I'm a personal chef and made it last week for a weekly client. I followed the recipe exactly and I had a note this morning that it was "Outstanding!"

I have been making this recipe since I first found it in Bon Appetit 10 years ago. I absolutely love it! The secret to the special taste is FRYING THE PASTA!! Do not omit this step!! Frying it to where the edges are very, very crisp gives it not only a unique flavor, but texture as well. The only change I have made was to use fresh tomatoes when I've been out of sundried and they worked very well also. This is a make again, and again, and again recipe!

WOW! For such a simple recipe, this is amazingly delicious. I didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried, and I also replaced half of the olive oil with oil from the sun-dried tomatoes. I was impressed. Next time I make this (and there will be a next time) I'll decrease the pine nuts to a generous half cup and increase the tomatoes to 1 cup. Fast, easy, and so tasty!!

Nice recipe, but I agree with the cook from DC:it is a little heavy. I added some tender zucchini and lots of parsley to bring some green. (Maybe broccoli would be good too?) One problem I had was the pasta didn't come out to be crisp (I used bow ties) and it started sticking to the bottom of the pot --- what did I do wrong?

This was the first dish my Michael ever made me... Whoa! Talk about aphrodesiac!!! It has become our trademark recipe with our friends. We even make our own sun-dried tomatoes, just for this recipe. Now, if I could only find a Pine nut tree...

I skipped the step involving frying the pasta. Used "al dente" cooked angel hair and otherwise followed the recipe. This removed lots of the oil, and it was truly delicious. Served it as a side dish with "Sauteed Chicken with Yellow Grape Tomatoes" from this site, just because I happened to have all ingredients on hand for both. Yum!

Try using a three color pasta, and the result is one that looks great, and the flavors are very good. We make it often.

When you're in a bind, and have little on hand, this is a tasty recipe.

This dish was terrific! I also used bow tie pasta. The pine nuts can be "toasted" by them cooking for a few seconds in the oil on low heat before adding the sun dried tomatoes. I used a garlic olive oil for the pine nuts and sun dried tomatoes. A very tasty, quick and easy week night dish.

I can't tell you how many times my family has made this recipe - when we travel we sometimes bring a stash of dried tomatoes and pine nuts so we can throw it together. It's easy and tasty. We don't use dried tomatoes in oil, however.

I found this recipe to be extremely greasy/oily. The combination of the sundried tomatoes in oil, the fried pasta, pinenuts and cheese were too much. An addition of something green or omitting some of the fat would probably help.

I made this dish for my pasta loving family and we loved it! The slightly crunchy pasta (I used bow ties) was a yummy surprise and definately one I will prepare again.

This recipe is a keeper. The crispy texture of the pasta is incredible. I prefer bowtie pasta instead of spirals. I used asiago cheese instead of parmesan because I prefer the nutty flavor and it melts a little better - it also compliments the toasted pine nuts. Several have asked for this one. I beg you to try it - you won't be sorry.

I loved the texture of this dish! I didn't have parsley so I used fresh basil instead. Yum Yum!
