This is a relatively simple dish with rewarding results. Like some other reviewers, I used mango chutney because I had it on hand; it tasted delicious, though the coloring wasn't as shown in the pictures (of course). It went over well with the teenagers in the house.

This was a total hit during the holidays. The flavors are perfect and came together really quickly after marinading. I couldn't find apple chutney and used mango as directed, which worked fine.

This recipe is AMAZING with "Old Farmhouse Chutney" made by Stonewall Kitchen. You can find it in some grocery stores or gourmet food shops. It's better than any other chutney I've tried with this recipe, and in fact, I won't use anything else. Try it!!

I loved this recipe. I substituted apple cider vinegar for the apple cider and the sauce turned out amazing. This is a good recipe if you are short on time but still looking for something that will definitely impress.

I really enjoyed this dish. It was easy and flexible. I had no cider so I substituted apple juice and instead of apple chutney, I used trader joes mango ginger chutney which gave it a little zing. Also, since some people here mentioned the marinade turned basting sauce was a bit thin, I threw some sliced mushrooms and cut up some dried figs to the pan. The mushrooms helped absorb up the flavor and the figs were a nice sweet addition. I made this with the simple dish of mashed sweet potatoes with maple syrup. Added some snow peas and it turned out a great and really easy meal.

This was really very good! I used mango chutney because I had some already on hand. I marinated the pork for 4 hours. Since my family prefers pork well done, rather than medium, the pieces took about 50 minutes to cook. I did open the oven several times to baste. In the end I thickened the sauce lightly with a bit of cornstarch and paired the pork with garlic roast potatoes and a baked vegetable medley. Everyone loved the pork and asked for seconds.

I thoufht this recipe was delicious! I wouldn't change a thing. My sister in law, who doesn't like pork that much loved it. I sent some home for her husband and he devoured it. Next time I am going to plan ahead and marinate for 3 hours instead of the one.

Pork was good. I couldn't find apple chutney. Opted for cranberry chutney instead (13 tablespoons in a jar, found in international aisle). Had a good merlot on hand. Overall, it was a nice meal....

This was such a disappointment after all the great reviews. I usually agree with other cooks, but this one sure didn't blow my dress up. It just didn't have anything special about it. In my humble opinion, there are many recipes on this site for pork tenderloin that are much better. Sorry to be the lone negative review, but we won't be doing this one again.

Excellent--much, much easier, quicker than a similar recipe on this site-Pork with cranberry-port sauce from October 2001. Same flavors, this recipe even better. I also used Trader Joe's apple-cranberry chutney, but also easily found the Silver Palate one, and another brand (but can't remember the name) in my local grocery store.

I grilled my pork tenderloin, but used the apple chutney sauce and it is excellent. I paired the pork and sauce with the Cornbread Dressing with Roasted Fall Vegetables in the same Bon Appetit issue. It's a great combination for an autumn dinner party.

Chutney is generally not available in Paris, so I used Confiture of Rhubarbe. Sauce was excellent and pork was sooo tender. I browned the pork a bit longer than suggested. Absolutely yummy & very easy!

We cooked 70 lbs of pork using this recipe for our annual church harvest dinner. It was a geat success. It took 7 recipes of the marinade using both mango and apple chutney for the marinade. Every one loved it and wants the recipe!

I served this to guests. They all kept saying that it was the best pork they had ever eaten. I could not find apple chutney, but did find a carribean peach lime chutney ( I found it at Giant Eagle) and used peach nectar instead of apple cider. Will definetly make again!

As with the other reviewers, I thought this was wonderful. I had to use Mango Chutney but yesterday I found a Cross and Blackwell Apple chutney ... will try it again this weekend.

An effortless gourmet meal that is perfect for mid-week. The pork stays juicy while the marinade adds a 'fall' flavor. I found a apple-cranberry chutney at Trader Joe's that worked perfectly, other than that I followed the recipe exactly and paired it with the herb-roasted eggplant from the same issue and some Grenache.

Delicious! Pork was moist and the sauce was wonderful. A definite keeper.

I forgot cider at the store so I used a half cup of applesauce and a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar. Other than that, I followed the instructions. It was outstanding! My husband said it was one of the best ever. It was truly a gourmet meal!

I made this as written with the Silver Palate apple chutney and it was delicious and very easy -- a good weeknight dinner and family pleaser.

I have made this twice since the recipe was published and my picky husband loves it! It is extremely easy and very flavorful. We love the fruit flavors from the mango chutney. Can't find the apple. This pork dish stays moist and tender. I will definitely make it again.

This was remarkably good for such a simple recipe. I used mango chutney as recommended for a substitution, and it added a delicious sweetness to the sauce. Served it with roasted delicata squash and some bread to sop us the sauce, and it was perfect. Even the picky teens liked it. One of those recipes that makes you look good without much effort.
