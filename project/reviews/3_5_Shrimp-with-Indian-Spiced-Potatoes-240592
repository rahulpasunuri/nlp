I really liked this, and it was very easy to make. Instead of frozen hash browns, I grated potatoes in the food processor.

This is reasonably quick to prepare and is very tasty. My only problem with it was the texture. I would have preferred that the potatoes be a tad crispier. They needed to saute a little longer but I was concerned that the peas would become too soft. So next time, I'm going to leave the peas out until I get the potatoes a little crisper - then add the peas (perhaps half thawed) and the shrimp. Overall, it's a keeper.

I almost doubled the spices as others recommended. I put the two packages of potatoes in my skillet, but it was overwhelming. Did not have a bigger non-stick. Next time will use only one package of potatoes (seemed to be plenty.) Quick and flavorful.

Loved this. Added more spice - extra curry powder, extra cayenne and some cumin, and I think that extra kick was perfect. I used half a large onion chopped up instead of the scallions with no problem. This will go in rotation.

I thought this was a tasty recipe. I served it with kale like another reviewer did, and that was a nice complement. One of the reasons I decided to try out this recipe was that it seemed like it would be really quick, but it took me at least an hour to make. Maybe I did something wrong, but the active time was definitely more than 10 minutes.

I made this dish and agree that it needs something more. It was great, but if you eat a lot of Indian food you'll find it a bit bland. I added seasoned salt and cumin -- that seemed to be the little kick it needed.

Such an easy recipe to adapt to whatever is on hand...leftover diced potatoes with onions and peppers; green beans for peas; onion for scallion; extra cayenne as suggested. I served it on a bed of kale sauteed with garlic, plus dollop of sour cream on top along with the cilantro. My husband raved!

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish. It is delicious and fairly quick. I used about 1 1/4lbs. of shrimp. Will definitely make this agian.

A nice combination of flavors and spices. The hash browns and peas work well together, and the shrimp is good with the garlic and ginger.

Fabulous. I increased the amount of cayenne to 3/4 tsp - we like it spicy! I didn't have frozen hash browns, so I used my mandolin to very thinly waffle-slice yukon gold potatoes. They cooked quickly and tasted great. Definitely will make again.

My husband and I both loved this dish. I substituted onions for scallions because I forgot to buy them and it was perfectly good. I served it with a plum chutney which added a nice touch

I really liked it, but my husband thought it was bland. I served it along with a Whole Foods-bought prepared cilantro relish, and that helped. I think the spices need to be punched up a bit -- perhaps with the addition of cumin next time.
