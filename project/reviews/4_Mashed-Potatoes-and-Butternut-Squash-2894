I used real butter and mixed with a hand blender. So tasty! I think steaming made all the difference-so much flavour. Will definitely make again.

This recipe is just okay for us. It lacked flavor. I boiled the veggies instead of steaming so they only needed a couple of tablespoons of butter and that may be the difference from the glowing reviews.

Very yummy and easy. Great for vegan family members while keeping the whole family happy.

Have you ever seen the movie "What About Bob?" where Bill Murray loved the food so much at Richard Dreyfuss' summer home that he groaned through the whole meal? Well, that was my husband's response when I made this dish! It was terrific! Will definately make again!

Love this recipe, but used butter instead of margirine. I have made it twice, and it was always a hit. Even better than regular old mashies(my word for mashed potatoes). Mashies are so boring, this is a delightful variation! I would reccomend it.

I loved the recipe and would recommend it. Just make sure (especially if you substitute acorn squash) to remove a good thick rind. You don't want any hard bits in the end product.

I loved this recipe, super delicious. I used real butter (OF COURSE!) and added some carmelized shallots in the final mix. I will make every time I need to fulfill my mashed potato cravings, but with a fantastic twist!

Great substitute for the regular mashed potatoes :-)

These are GREAT! A tasty, very different side, or bed for braised beef or lamb shanks. Be sure to salt liberally and don't forget the nutmeg.

It was good. My husband would have given it 3 forks. May make it again, but there are so many wonderful things one can do with mashed potatoes other than this.

Great Recipe, I used butter and added some milk though to make it smoother. Easy and memorable.

I have made this often since it first appeared in the magazine. Great for a winter dinner. Easy and is always well received.

This dish has become a mainstay of our dining repertoire. Definitely go for butter over margarine. It has such a nice flavor and a lovely color. They are great the next day if you fold them around a bit of cheese and sautee them in patty form.

Absolutely awesome dish! I halved the squash (scooped out seeds), brushed small amount of olive oil, salt & pepper, and baked in 425 F oven until just tender and nicely browned. Cooled squash, peeled and added the last 15 minutes to steamed potatos and garlic; procedeed with rest of recipe.

Also works well with a little ground ginger insted of the nutmeg.
