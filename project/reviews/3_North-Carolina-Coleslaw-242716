I've eaten Lexington BBQ in Lexington and this is a fairly authentic recipe. I have made this as a salad with finely sliced lettuce instead of cabbage and it has also worked well. This is a great side dish for summer picnics as it travels well and doesn't spoil quickly. This is a regular in our house.

This truly was not that great, I wouldn't make it again. Didn't do it for us.

I made the dressing exactly as written but used about 1.5 bags of ready made coleslaw mix. I enjoyed the dressing but my husband didn't and some others at the dinner table liked it and some others didn't. I might make it again and would probably cut down the oil as well even though the salad itself didn't seem too oily.

This was sooo easy! Surprisingly, my husband loved this. Usually if he has a traditional dish, he only likes it made the traditional way. Not in this case. I will definitly make it again.

seems like a lot of oil--I must agree. Haven't made this yet but I would rethink the oil.

Pretty bland. I used napa cabbage, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. No one in our family cared for it, I'll keep looking for a coleslaw recipe.

I served this slaw for lunch immediately after making it; it was good. However, I put the leftovers in the refrigerator and served it 6 hours later, and the salad was much improved -- from good to very good. Without having to use mayonnaise, it is safe and delicious picnic fare.

Perfect balance of sweet and tang. We used red cabbage for a brighter color and would use the same again. Highly recommend.

This coleslaw is very much the type we used to get at the roadside barbeque stands in Dare Co., North Carolina before the fast food joints. Not quite "Make a rabbit slap a dog" good but awlful close. I did reduce the amount of oil to 1/2 cup vice 3/4 cup and think I might reduce it again to 1/3 cup next batch. Oh yea, the next batch must be made soon as 3 people but a serious hurt on this 8 serving recipe.
