SO delicious. The bananas were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, and the chocolate sauce was nothing less than amazing. I prefer to use 4oz of ghiradelli semi-sweet chocolate, rather than bittersweet. I think it gives the perfect amount of sweetness.

So delicious and so easy. A wonderful treat for a family evening. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

WONDERFUL! A super sinful and sexy looking and tasty treat that appears to be far more complicated than it is. I have made this several times exactly as written with perfect results every time to rave reviews. Always asked for!

Was great! I found the sauce to be more bitter than I would have liked it. But I am sweet tooth :) I might try it with white chocolate next time ...

I used salted peanuts instead of walnuts. Folks loved the sweet and salty taste. Delicious and easy.

Very sweet and buttery tasting dessert, everyone seemed to enjoy it. Agree with a previous reviewer that it could do with more bananas, at least one banana per person would be better I think. I probably won't make this particular recipe again though, since it was basically just cooked bananas with chocolate sauce, and I've better recipes for both of those (a simple chocolate ganache with broiled bananas is simpler to make and tastes better to me).

This recipe is way too sweet. I followed the directions exactly. I took two bites and threw the rest out.

This was very yummy! Our guest actually used the end of the spoon to scrape the carmel from the bottom of the bowl - fabulous dessert.

Very easy and absolutely great. Use a good quality ice cream & chocolate and you won't be disappointed. I used Haagan Daz & Scharfenberger.

So, so delicious. A bit richer than what I'd usually go for...but holy moly. Worth every tablespoon of cream, butter and chocolate!

This was really delicious. I think it's hard to go wrong with these ingredients, BUT...I did have some trouble with the chocolate separating from the butter & sugar. Very yummy, but it wasn't smooth. It also started hardening a little bit when it hit the ice cream. I used Giradhelli chocolate with 60% cocao.
