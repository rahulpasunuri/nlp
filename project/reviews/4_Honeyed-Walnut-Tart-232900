Made this for guests the other night and it was scrumptious, made a fantastic impression. Would be great with a little whipped cream or something.

Excellent! Crust was flaky and interesting to just fold over. Tart was not too sweet.

I used pistachios instead of walnuts to good effect. Although the dessert was a success it wasn't such a hit that I'll make it again and again. The orange flower water makes this dish.

a lovely centerpiece for afternoon coffee, served with creme- fraiche-whipped cream (add a couple of tablespoons creme fraiche to whipped cream). the sourness is a perfect complement to the sweetness of the tart. be sure to chop the candied citrus nice and fine. I candied my own lemons and oranges and used a bit of both. I baked this in a pie pan - next time I'll make it free form on a baking sheet and be sure to roll the crust thin. for the pastry I used salted butter, 4T water + 1T vodka, which made a delightfully flaky crust.

A wonderful combination of nutpie and baklava, this rich confection needs just a smsll slice to sate your sugar craving. Very easy to make (I left out the orange flower water, too).

Made this for neighbor for Rosh Hashannah this year - we split it. Was absolutely delicious...loved the combination of flavors with the lemon and the orange flower water...gave it a Middle Eastern accent!

This is just delicious. The citrus is a nice balance to the sweetness of the sugar and the honey. The dough is easy to work with. The filling looks like it will be too wet but it sets up nicely and the crust is not soggy. (Ok, so I skipped the orange-flower water.)
