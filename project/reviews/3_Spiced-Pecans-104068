We had good success with this recipe aided and abetted by earlier reviews. We used 2 cups of water and 2/3 cup of sugar but double the amount of pecan halves to 2 cups, boiling it and frying it in two portions. Forewarned we used oiled parchment paper instead of paper towels. The results were delicious.

As written this is a horrible recipe. Cut the water down to 1/2 cup but leave all the spices as written. Also do not fry, they taste so much better when that step is skipped. When modified they are great and a must for the salad.

This is a tough one to review. The flavor is totally addictive, so that gets 4 stars. But the instructions, maybe a 2. Modifications I make, based on other reviews, are to use 1/2 - 3/4 cup water; skip the frying step (so unhealthy!). After the sauce thickens and starts sticking to the pecans (almonds also work well) I pour it all out onto a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake in a low oven for 10-15 minutes, so that they dry out a bit. The glaze gets a bit crispier as they dry/cool. Yummy!

Yeah, this is a funny recipe. I cut the water in half. Clearly it doesn't matter how much water you do start with since basically you have to boil it all off anyway to get it to turn syrupy. I boiled it down to a syrup and poured it out onto a baking sheet where it all crystallized. I then baked it about 15 minutes at 350. This crisped up the pecans, and some of the sugar mixture leaked out the bottom and candied, giving them a nice delicious crunch.

I checked by copy of the October 2000 magazine and the ingredient quantities are exactly the same. I must have done something wrong but I did not like the nuts once they were fried. They were great when I coated them and just let them sit but the frying didn't work for me. I would make it again but leave out the frying step, maybe toast in the oven to make them less sticky.

NOT WITH THIS RECIPE....THE QUANTITIES HAVE AN ERROR....I THINK 2 CUPS OF WATER VS. 1/2 SUGAR MAY BE INCORRECT. I MADE THIS RECIPE IN 2000, IT WAS GREAT. I MADE THIS IN 2005 AND IT DOES NOT WORK???????

Yes, these were a bit of work.....but they were well worth the effort....and your guests will appreciate the results! After reading the previous comments I made some adjustments to the directions. I cooked the syrup for a little bit longer,then added the pecans. I divided them into 2 batches.....the second batch cooking faster than the required time I drained on paper towel, but transfered immediately to wax paper...turning them until they cooled down. Mine turned out crisp and spicy.

The "glaze" never turned into a syrup so the flavor was largely lost by the time the nuts were finished. Nice crisp texture, however.

I made these last night to add into a spinach salad today.My husband came home from work and after eating a couple, made himself a batch to munch on last night. They were delicious. He topped them with extra sugar after he took them out of the oil which gave them an added sweet crunch.

everyone at my party loved them! i cut the water by half and definitely watched the frying time - 2 minutes is too long. nice treat on top of a wonderful salad.

These nuts are really a treat and definitely worth trying! We couldn't keep our hands off of them! Great on a salad and also for just snacking. I used the full amount of water. I cut the cayenne pepper in half and that was perfect for us. Not too spicy. After pouring off the excess liquid I put the nuts on a buttered cookie sheet and baked them in a slow oven, stirring often. That worked out well for me. Yummy, I can't wait to make them again!

I didn't like the prep: I did cut the water /sugar ratio, & did the deep frying, and removed the nuts to paper towels to drain. Then went on to other kitchen work. When I tried removing the nuts, they'd all become stuck to the towels. UGH!

Third year in a row I have made these for Thanksgiving and will make more for Christmas. I put in full amt of water and 5-6 c. pecans, and boil for 15 mins or so. Nuts do get soggy but crisp up and develop flavor when fried. I also salt them a little after frying. My friends and family crave them!

These nuts are amazing !! 1/2 to 3/4 cup water is plenty. I boiled the nuts in the syrup about 10 minutes and sprinkled extra paprika & cayenne on just before frying for a little extra kick. Definitely worth the trouble.

There's enough guilt that goes with fried foods - be careful - 2 minutes is too long to deep fry - not worth effort

I've made these before, but thanks to the cook from Oakland, they came out MUCH better this time. I used about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of water and followed the rest of the recipe word for word. Voila! Just the right amount of spicy and sweet.

First thought on reading recipe was "two cups water and one half cup sugar. Yeah right!" Stirred spices into sugar and used only enough water to disolve sugar (1/4-1/2 cup. This cut boiling time down to the three minutes. Fried in oil and drained on silpat. Great results.

Excellent. Must drain pecans on waxed papaer NOT paper towels...

I tried unsuccessfully to get this recipe correct; my trouble was getting the sauce to the right temp to coat the pecans. Hence, I would rate it 2 forks for the directions and outcome (pecans soggy, cook frustrated). I will try another recipe for spiced pecans on this site.

Wow these are dynamite! I'm surprised to see the negative reviews. Mine turned out so wonderfully I plan on making a huge batch of them next holiday season for guests to munch on. I used them on a salad and they were the best part. I followed the recipe exactly and didn't have any problems.

Had a little trouble getting the sauce hot enough to coat the pecans. I could only get the temperature to go to 115F. Threw in the pecans anyway. It worked out okay. Truly a dish beyond compare. Will make these again just as a treat in themselves.

Don't bother trying this one. When the nuts were first made they were OK but 30 minutes later they were soft and just yucky. Then let's not even talk about the mess made by the popping grease. Just don't do it!!!

I followed the recipe exactly, which is unusual for me, and they are delicious!!! However, be sure to drain them on waxed or parchment paper, rather than paper towels. I used them in a salad with mixed baby greens, endive, apple and roquefort cheese. Fabulous! They are good with cocktails also.

This recipe requires patience. I cooked/boiled the syrup mixture for about 10 minutes and it never hit 220. I put the pecans in the runny syrup and they didn't get "coated". Then I fried them in 350 oil and they turned dark brown. Following directions I drained them and put them on paper towel and they stuck! The flavor was okay but not worth raves. Why would I make this recipe again? There are other sure-thing recipes for spiced pecan with better flavor out there.

I made this recipe two different ways. The first one I kind of followed but found that the pecans took too long in the water and ended up getting soggy. The 2nd time I followed just the ingredients, since most of the complaints were about frying. I let all the ingredients boil until it turned to a thick syrup and then added the pecans until there was a pretty good coating (about 5 minutes)and then I put them on a greased cookie sheet over the BBQ for about 7-9 minutes. I constantly stirred them to avoid getting stuck and it worked!

Definately do not drain these on paper towel after frying, or you'll need to add another 15 minutes for chipping the paper off each pecan - patting with paper towel would be better. Actually, I'd skip the frying altogether. But they tasted good.

These nuts are really excellent. They taste great with the Romaine and Gorgonzola Salad with Roasted Garlic Dressing. However, it did take me longer than 3 minutes to get the temperature up.

These nuts are really good! I didn't have time to make the recipe all the way through, so the first batch I made I put the syrup coated nuts on waxed paper before frying. This was a big mistake because they permanently stuck to the paper - if I had a silpat this wouldn't have happened, but... I've discovered they are quite tasty unfried (and more spicy). The second batch, I put the nuts on an oiled tray before frying and that worked really well. I found it a slight bit difficult not to over cook them while frying as I was using a wok, so mine have this great carmelized flavor and they are rather dark brown. Hard to stop eating them though!

The sugar syrup takes longer than 3 minutes to reach 220 degrees. Be sure to use a candy thermometer. The sugar syrup on my first batch wasn't thick enough, but the nuts tasted ok. The second batch I made sure I cooked the syprup long enough and the nuts came out with a thicker candy coating. They are hard to stop eating.
