After reading the rave reviews, I made this for our weekly feast. I was very disappointed. It was just OK, and a waste of good ingredients.

Yummy, but (I never thought I'd say this) too rich for me. I loooove decadent desserts, but in this case, the peanut butter overwhelmed the homemade hot fudge sauce that I put on top. I couldn't even taste it! I highly recommend the Black Bottom Peanut Butter Mousse Pie as an alternative.

Ok this is dreamy. The texture is so good. I used a purchased pie crust but would have been better homemade of course. One thing, the pie does not necessarily have to be frozen to be good. I just had a piece out of the refridgerator this morning and it was just as good. Some people dont like cold things so... Kind of like a Reese whipps.

I followed the recipe to the letter, except that I did use all-natural (no addditive) peanut butter against the advice of the recipe. It turned out as rich and delicious as it possibly could haveeveryone at the BBQ absolutely raved about this fabulous pie so Im not sure why the recipe discourages the use of a healthier ingredient that doesnt compromise the taste or texture of the pie whatsoever. I recommend using all-natural peanut butter in this pie.

Excellent! Rave reviews. I used pre-made chocolate graham cracker crust to save time. Hot fudge tasted much better with it than chocolate syrup.

Another version of this recipe is to add 1/2 cup miniature semi-sweet chocolate chips to the peanut butter mixture.

Yes, this was rich, its supposed to be! Very good. I used a pre-purchased graham cracker crust and used hershey's chocolate sauce instead of the hot fudge. Everyone loved it. The only thing I would recommend is freezing it for more than the minimum time of 2 hours - it was still very soft when we ate it.

Way too rich, way too big! I made two, first following the recipe and then adjusting. We liked my version much better: the concept is to reduce portion size, cut filling by half, further reduce sugar, add flavor. First plan on 10 pieces not 8. Use chocolate graham crackers. For filling, drop sugar to 1/2 cup, use 4 oz Neufchatel cream cheese (and non-fat may be good as well) and 1/2 c reduced-fat peanut butter. Add 1 t cinnamon to only 3/4 cup cream and then whip. The trick, however, is adding chocolate. It LOOKS better drizzled on top. It TASTES better swirled in. The compromise: Add 2/3 of filling to the crust, swirl in 1/2 ounce melted chocolate. Add the remaining 1/3 plain filling. Then drizzle 1/2 oz chocolate over top. My Dad was in heaven ... luckily the REST of the pie goes home with him tomorrow. It wouldn't be safe here otherwise! PS My version has 237 calories, 13 grams fat vs 479 and 36 in the original.

I made a test of this recipe without the crust for use with elderly people who can't chew well but who love good food. I substituted whipped evaporated milk for the whipping cream in order to add more nutritional value, and swirled fudge sauce on the top in individual cups. My teenaged son just got home from school and ate one in about three bites and loved it. I ate some and loved it. I think if I were making it as a pie, I would use a chocolate crumb crust. It is very easy to make and very delicious.

My dad, a long-time peanut butter pie devotee, absolutely raved, and that is high praise. This pie is wonderful!

I swirled chocolate in the top portion of the filling and it was a nice addition. Got this suggestion from another reviewer. Also, I had trouble getting the frozen crust out of the pie dish in one piece. Don't know what the solution is on this but well worth making even if it comes out in pieces.

I also used the oreo crust. It was a winner people who normally don't like peanut butter loved this. I will definitely make again

Yum, Yum, Yum! Took the advice with the oreo shell and broken Reese's Cups. Delicious and easy. My husband, who does not like peanut butter pie, ate it and went back for seconds. Recomend eating at refrigerator temperature not frozen.

I love this dessert (as did my guests), but I recommend using a purchased graham cracker crust. Believe me, the filling is all people remember.

This recipe was easy enough for my almost 4 year old daughter. We had great fun making it together. It was a big hit and we'll make it again I am certain. We used a pre-made Oreo crust and also melted a couple of handfuls of chocolate chips which we swirled into the top 1/4" of the pie filling before putting it into the freezer. This recipe is a must for anyone who loves to eat chocolate and peanut butter together.

I just had this dessert at Shorty's (the contributor of the recipe) here in New Hampshire a few weeks ago! I was wondering if there was cream cheese in it. It certainly is very rich, and I would recommend that you try small servings and get 12-16 from one pie.

This pie was delicious but a little heavy and hard when frozen. To lighten it up, I decreased the sugar and folded in whipped topping instead of whipped cream to get a lighter texture. I also added broken up Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Miniatures and swirled in melted chocolate with a knife tip after pie was in shell, topped with whipped topping in a pastry bag with a star tip and sprinkled top with chocolate shavings and peanut sundae topping (chopped unsalted roasted peanuts), then froze. Served over hot fudge topping decorating the plate. Delicious and pretty.

read the directions carefully, especially about dividing the 1 c sugar between the crust and the filling! it was ok, but a little too rich for my family. the kids wouldnt eat it. i couldnt believe a pie would sit around the freezer for so long

This pie is fabuloso! People swoon and rave and beg for the recipe...it's easy, quick, and delish-capish! Four forks up!

This is truly an outstanding dish. I made it using an Oreo cookie crust. I substituted a non dairy whipped topping for the cream and used chunky peanut butter. I will certainly make it again.

This is utterly delicious. I have made it four times and every time I get requests for the recipe. If you are a peanut butter/chocolate fan you will not be disapointed. It makes a lot and is so rich that I divide it into two crusts. Its great to have an extra dessert in the freezer.

TOTALLY DECADENT. A FAMILY FAVORITE.
