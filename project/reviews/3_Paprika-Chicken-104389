Delicious and easy chicken recipe. It's a little bit different from my usual chicken recipes, but simple enough that the kids loved it as much as I did. I added two cloves of garlic to the onions, and used boneless chicken thighs, which did cook in the allotted time. I'll make this one again.

i made this recipe almost exactly as is except for the addition of garlic and mushrooms. i wish i could say otherwise, but i was pretty disappointed in the recipe. it wasn't horrible, but it lacked flavor. i don't plan to make this again.

A good, simple dish. Yes it needs to cook longer. I put mine in a casserole dish and baked it after it was prepared on the stove-top. Chicken was tasty and tender. I didn't use olive oil. I had plenty of fat just from the chicken skin. I will probably add a clove of garlic in with the onions next time. I served it with egg noodles.

With not a lot in my fridge one night, I checked online to see what I could make with chicken and sour cream. This is the recipe I made. Since then, I have made this often. It is full of flavour and so easy to prepare! For a little depth to this recipe, I use half regular paprika and half smoked paprika. My fiancee loves this recipe and requests it often. A good busy week night recipe.

fabulous recipe-easily 4 stars my favorite way to eat chicken.

No one to blame but myself; had only 1 onion; added a red & green pepper; and I think my paprika needs updating. It was just okay, will try again and use fresher stuff, avoid peppers....and leave the chicken skin on.

I'll weigh in on this recipe. I have to admit that I am from south Louisiana and frequently critique (harshly) what some people call Cajun food. I therefore got a real kick out of the various Hungarians arguing over the details of whether or not this is authentic Chicken Paprikesh. To me, it doesn't matter. It is absolutly delicious, but OF COURSE I changed things. I did not render the chicken fat but used a bit of olive oil for health reasons. I added mushrooms as several reviewers suggested, and they were delicious. After browning the chicken and onion mixture and getting everything in the pot, I put the entire thing in a Dutch oven and baked it at 325F for 2 hours. I then mixed in a half container (? 1/2 cup) fat free sour cream and topped the plates with freshly chopped parsley. I served it over fresh wide egg noodles. It was wonderful. The chicken fell completely off the bones. So whether or not it is authentic, it stays in our family repertoire of dishes to have again.

My husband nearly ate himself into oblivian. For us, the only thing that could have made this one better would have been adding garlic. I may try that next time I make the dish, which will probably be very soon.

This recipe is on my Gourmet Cookbook. It calls for 2 medium onions, instead of 2 cups of onions (my apartment smelled of cooked onions for days!) It looked fairly easy and quick to make (45 minutes, supposedly), so I went ahead and tried it. I agree with most reviewers that the chicken will not cook through in the time specified, about 20 minutes. Next time I will brown the chicken thighs (with the skin on) in the olive oil before I make the sauce. I will only finish cooking them in the sauce (without the skin). Also, I did not think that the flour was necessary. The sauce thickened up a bit in the extra time that was required to finish cooking the chicken.

If you don't like this recipe, then your spices are not fresh. This is amazing winter comfort food.

I make this dish occasionally. Changes I think for the better: Double the stuff for the sauce. After doubling the sauce... Double the paprika (pref with hot some hot paprika as th addition) and double the sour cream (at least). I serve over wide egg noodles or homemade pappardelle that have been sprinkled with butter and caraway seeds. I know... unorthodox... but it is good.

Delicious!!!! Wonderful! My chicken thigh supplier (Costco) tends to have very large thighs with an excess of fat hanging from one side, I cut this fat off and rendered it as well as frying the skin-on thighs. This provided sufficient fat to cook the onions and I still got my thighs with skin-on. I am the type of person who does not understand 2 Tblsp of sour cream, the minimum amount is 1/2 cup. Added mushrooms and due to the size of the thighs used the oven baking method (1 hour at 325). For me paprika + sour cream = egg noodles. Also used 19-oz can of diced tomatoes and 1 cup chicken stock. The sauce was awesome.

Thanks to earlier suggestions I kept the skins on, subbed vegetable oil for the olive oil and cooked the paprika for a minute before adding the chicken. Then I browned the chicken slightly with the onions/paprika b4 adding the liquid. I skipped the tomato sauce and upped the liquid to 1 c.stock and 1/2 c.water. My pan wasn't big enough so I transfered everything to a large casserole and baked at 350 for 45 minutes. It was lovely - falling off the bone. Very flavorful but next time I'll use a combo of sweet and hot paprika, which was suggested to me by my off-the-boat Hungarian father-in-law.

Excellent dish but agree had to cook chicken an extra half hour plus. Only had skinless boneless thighs which worked well but agree that bones + additional rendered would give richer flavour. However, still quite good. I added some sauteed mushrooms which married well with it, and served with the spicy cheddar biscuits (heavenly) from this site.

I agree with those who say that the chicken can use a longer cooking time; in fact, since it's dark meat, you can add time easily without it suffering. I don't know if we're allowed to recommend items by brand, but I use Penzey's spices (penzeys.com) and their paprika is fabulous. My husband adored this dish and it can definitely be served to "company"!

Quick notes: Do not use olive oil (the flavor is wrong.) Use sunflower oil or lard. The typical Magyar dish starts with onions being heated until translucent in fat. Take the onions off the heat and add sweet Hungarian paprika (the quality of the paprika is absolutely critical. Buy the Pride of Szeged stuff.) Stir. DO NOT LET PAPRIKA BURN. It will ruin your dish. Return to heat with chicken pieces. Do not skin chicken. DO NOT add water unless absolutely necessary to keep dish from burning. Often, the chicken paprikash here is of the falling-off-the-bone quality. Don't worry about overcooking the dish. Many recipes add ONE SMALL tomato (per chicken) in the sauce as well. I don't, but a whole can is way too much. Serve over galuska aka spaetzle.

I am from Hungary, and people here have no clue about the real `paprikas csirke`. Forget the butter in Hungarian dishes, use vegetable oil.

This was simple to make, but it does need to cook for at least 1 hour. We served it over cous cous and really enjoyed it.

I thought this was a wonderful week night dish. This will be a staple in our home. I am glad that I didn't read the reviews prior to making it because I probably would have been scared away -- DON'T LET THE REVIEWS KEEP YOU FROM TRYING THIS!!!

Made this tonight and my husband did have seconds; however I found the chicken lacked flavor, yet the sauce was good by itself. I cooked this for about an hour, probably could have cooked another hour if I had had the time.

I wasn't expecting much when I made this, which was something I fixed just because I happened to have the ingredients in the house and didn't feel like going to the store. It was a pleasant surprise, very tasty, with a depth of flavor that probably comes from the paprika. I discovered the difference good Hungarian paprika makes not long ago, and this is yet another example. I followed the recipe as written with minor exceptions. The chicken thighs in my freezer were the skinless/boneless type, so I skipped the step involving the skin and just browned them in good olive oil, dusting them first with a bit of flour, rather than worrying later about thickening the sauce. Also, I used white wine, instead of broth, and I threw a few carrot chunks in the pan for vegetables. I let the whole thing simmer for quite a bit longer than called for, because my husband was late getting home, but the chicken didn't seem to mind at all! Finally, I served these with a very easy potato pancake recipe instead of noodles. (four russets, grated and wrung dry, mixed with one small grated onion, two beaten eggs, 4 T flour and 1 t salt, cooked in a small amount of veggie oil at 375 degrees for a few minutes.) My guys were very happy, indeed.

I have a hard time following directions so I used skinless/boneless thighs and fresh tomatoes because that's what I had. Instead of using stock and the flour paste I put a dollup of good quality chicken stock concentrate into the mix and let it reduce. So I wouldn't upset Sacramento I tossed in a bell pepper. A couple of jalapenos ended up in there as well. I used quite a bit more paprika as I adjusted for taste. I may try Austin's idea about the onion/paprika paste next time then finish with some mango and papaya salsa thing.

I don't know why pple think this is supposed to be Chicken Paprikash!!! It makes this claim nowhere!! I liked it, although next time I would use legs instead of thighs. I thought it had a nice flavour, although I would also spice it up with some cayenne, or even just add a green chilli.

If you want a truly spectacular and authentic recipe for chicken paprikash, use the one in Joy of Cooking. The secret is cooking the onions and paprika down on a slow flame until the onions dissolve into a paste. This took me about an hour stirring occasionally. Don't add the chicken back in until after this step. The result is the most fabulous tasting chicken dish I've ever eaten.

I thought this dish was extremely tasty. I simmered it about 1/2 hour longer than stated and added some Thyme which gave it some extra flavor and tenderness.

Sorry folks, but my beloved Hungarian grandmother would be turning over in her grave if she saw this recipe. True Hungarian Chicken Paprikas has NO TOMATOES IN IT! Whatever this is, Hungarian it AIN'T. And my grandmother was the best Hungarian cook that ever lived.

I made this recipe when I couldn't find my Hungarian father's favorite one (also from Gourmet, Oct. 1988, p.199). I wouldn't make it again! I had to modify it a lot to make it edible (cooking the chicken much longer, more salt, etc.) but it still had a bland, flabby taste that I couldn't fix. I think that rendering the chicken skin makes it way too greasy, and I was never able to lift off all of the fat from the top. Also chicken paprikash is not meant to be a quick week night meal. It has to be cooked long and slowly and left to sit overnight in the refrigerator. If you want to make this, try another recipe! George Lang has a good one also in his The Cuisine of Hungary.

Try my Hungarian gulash: saute 8 (yes, 8) thinly-sliced onions in 3-4 T. olive oil; add a sliced sweet red pepper and 5-6 cloves pressed garlic; then add a package of sliced mushrooms. Take off heat; mix in 8 (yes, 8) T. GOOD Hungarian sweet paprika, 1 tsp. salt, some grindings of fresh black pepper, and 1 tsp. dried dill. Add one whole chicken, cover with water, bring to a boil, and then cook on low for 90 minutes. Debone the chicken, add the meat back to the stew, and allow to sit in the fridge overnight. Serve with a dollop of sour cream on the side over boiled potatoes or real egg noodles. You can also chuck in a few chicken bouillon cubes if you like - richer but saltier stew base. Eat wearing either crummy clothing or all black - paprika stains. THIS is comfort food.

I agree with the cook from Hungary and used his/her recipe with excellent result. That version I rate 3 forks and will make again.

The original Hungarian dish is excellent but this recipe has not much to do with it. You may want to forget about the canned tomatos (you may use fresh instead). Use more oil 2-3 tbsp, and cook the skin with the chicken, discard it only at the end if you don't like it. 1. Saute the onion in oil until it's golden brown. 2. Stir paprika in, and immediately add the chicken. Stir so the flash is sealed by the oil on all sides. 3. Add salt, and a small amount of water (or broth). You may add a couple of cloves of garlic. Braise it covered until the chicken is done. Add water as necessary. Best if it is cooked in its own juice. 4. You can serve as is, or to add the soure cream first reduce water if any left then add the cream - though 250 ml is more approriate for this amount of chicken - and cook it until it starts to boil again.

This recipie could be excellent, however be sure to use hungarian paprika, Madras. Season the chicken with salt and pepper, then season some all purpose flour with salt and pepper. My grandmother was from Hungary, and any paprikash type of dish you "browned"!! the onions, you also added garlic 1/2 way through the browning process, stirring constantly. For even more flavor make a roux of equall parts of melted butter and flour and cook stirring constantly for 3 minutes. Let this cool. Add it at the end (pull chicken first) whisk in to boiling liquid untill well incorperated add chicken back in and simmer untill starch taste is gone. About 20 minutes. Also try adding some sliced sauteed mushrooms in at the end. Do not forget to season with salt and pepper to your taste. Oh yes brown the chicken, remove from pan and then begin the cooking of the onions.

This dish was very disappoing-almost completely lacking in flavor. The sauce never really flavored the chicken which was underdone even after cooking it 15 minutes longer than the recipe called for. We threw away half of what we made-and we only made half a portion.

This dish is wholesome, but completely uninteresting. Noone asked for seconds and I couldn't even 'push' the leftovers. The dish does not have the flavor of Hungarian or Eastern European versions of this dish. -- Even if you're just looking for a quick way to prepare chicken, there are better choices out there to be had.

ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS. SERVED WITH HORSERADISH MASHED POTATOES, AND CRUSTY FRENCH BREAD. REALLY A WINNER.
