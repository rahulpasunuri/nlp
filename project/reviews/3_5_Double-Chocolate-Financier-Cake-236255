I added two extra egg whites (because I was tryinng to get rid of them) and beat the whites as others have recommended. Got lazy with the chocolate and it could have been more finely chopped, but no complaints later about the small chocolatey pockets. The cakes were ready in exactly 23 minutes and were very moist. Didn't have time for the ganache, but I put apricot jam between the layers, and served with a dollop of whipped cream -- everyone was happy!

The first time I made the cake it was a little so-so. Second time I made it I used orange zest and blood orange preserves with the cake, and Domaine de Canton Ginger & Cognac Liqueur in the ganache. Tasted wonderful, but I like chocolate, orange, and ginger together.

Overall this recipe is delicious but I have a couple of problems with it. I've worked as a pastry assistant, and here is how we made financier cakes: brown butter with vanilla bean & set aside, heat egg whites & double boiler just until the sugar has dissolved, and whip whites to stiff peak in kitchenaid. Then add your flours (regular & almond, in this case the cocoa powder as well), and the mixture will deflate somewhat. While the mixer is running, drizzle in your brown butter, making sure the whites/flour and butter are mixing cohesively (making an emulsion) and not "breaking" (looking greasy and separated). This cake should be dense and will not rise to spectacular heights! All that being said, next time I make this recipe I will leave out the cocoa powder & chocolate in the cake mix, as I thought the vanilla, brown butter and almond flavor got lost in the mix. The ganache for the filling and the top were absolutely spectacular. I pressed buttered, salted, and toasted sliced almonds on the sides of the cake, and let the shiny, smooth glaze look pretty on top. Next time I might increase the recipe to create three or four layers of cake, to make it seems substantial. This one is quite flat- seems very adult but not totally show-stopping!

Excellent cake !! Finished a classic seven course dinner with a variation of this recipe & everyone raved !! I used more egg whites as suggested and beat them to soft peaks...the cake even came up a bit doing this. I used ground walnuts instead of almonds and a quality orange marmalade (with a liberal bit of gran marnier). For the finish..I candied walnuts with extra orange zest and served with fresh whipped cream & gran marnier. The cake was easy to make and will def be making it again. My guests are still talking about it. Will try the almond/apricot version next...def want to try a few more combinations.

This is the first cake I ever made from scratch, and honestly, one of the best cakes I've tasted. I didn't use apricot but current jelly. It turned out great.

Easily one of the best cakes I have ever made. Don't hesitate to use 7 or 8 egg whites and whisk them bordering high peaks. This is the only thing that will give the cake any loft, don't expect it to rise any in the cake pan.

The taste of this cake is very similar to one my grandmother used to make when we visited her in Switzerland. I love it! It brings back fond memories, and I'm happy to have finally found one that I can make at home. No one cares that it's flat once they taste it.

This cake was simply delicious! I made it with some trepidation considering I live in high altitude Mexico City. Egg whites and eggs can be tricky in a cake--a genoise is usually a disaster. But more than anything, everyone enjoyed the great taste and texture. This is definitely a repeat! Bonnie E.

cake tastes like heaven on earth, especially with the apricot filling. cake layer did come out nice and flat, so i just folded it in half to make a good two layers.i think this is one of my favorite cakes

I love to experiment so when I saw this cake that's what I decided to do! I whipped the egg whites to soft peaks and my cakes were also pretty flat. (like an inch high). I don't particularly care for almonds, and have a LOT of pecans sitting around, so I used pecans instead that I chopped up and the texture and taste were probably a LOT different, but really good! The cake came out very tasty, but I think for the time involved and the calorie content which I don't even want to think about, there are probably other cakes out there that I will try next time.

Thanks to the earlier notes, I did whip the egg whites to soft peaks. But I do not believe that made much of a difference. My cakes also turned out a bit flat, dry, and dense. The flavor was good, especially because of the apricot jam between the layers. And this particular ganache was delicious.

I also ended up with flat cakes, otherwise good flavor and beautiful ganache. Whisk to blend eggwhites is a big difference from Whip to firm peaks. And it is a relatively expensive mistake. But I am glad I came on line to figure out what went wrong.

i didn't whip the eggwhites either (duh) and it came out super dense and super flat. i figured i'd go ahead and glaze the cake anyway since i spent all that time and money on it. i'm glad i decided to because even though it was flat, it was very tasty. i'll definately remake this cake, since everyone liked it. but i'll next time i'll remember to whip the egg whites. it will be even better!

I haven't made this financier but I have made many financiers successfully. It's one of my favorite desserts. One thing they forgot in this recipe is that you have to whip the egg whites to firm peaks. That's the reason the cakes are coming out flat as a flitter. Try whipping your whites and your cake will come out fine.

cake came out flat as a board. the picture is deceiving.

What a dissapointment! The picture looks great but the cake came out dense like cardboard. I don't know if I did something wrong or what. The ganache filing wasn't bad and maybe I will try it with another cake. Buying ground almonds wasn't cheap either. There has to be something better.
