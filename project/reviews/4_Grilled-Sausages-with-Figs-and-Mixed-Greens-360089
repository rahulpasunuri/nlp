Fantastic recipe. My 11 year old twins cooked the meal. Its a great meal to delegate to jr. chefs. It was wonderful. Served the meal with toasted pita bread. Used organic chicken sausage. Still superb. My family would eat this again.

This was an amazing salad. I forgot to buy mint . . . . and it was still good, so I can't wait to try it with the mint. I might use an Asian pear instead of figs next time.

I'm so happy to have come across this extremely satisfying dish. I mixed everything together from the start instead of plating each dish separately. Holy wow, I can't say enough about this meal. REPEAT!

This is the most fantastic salad and dressing!! My friend made it with homemade venison sausage that was a little bit spicy and it was perfect! I decided to make it for a group of vegetarians and used falafel balls instead of sausage, also good. I had to cut them in half, but they soaked up a little dressing which was nice. I also added a little cumin to the falafels.

I didn't want to use the indoor grill, so I parboiled the sausage for about 10 minutes, sliced them and finished them on the stove with the dressing. A great recipe; my husband isn't much into salads, he went back for seconds!

Fabulous salad, and made the pizza too. Also excellent.

Great seasonal dinner enjoyed outside. Used mint from the yard. Added a little dressing to the onions and sliced sausage after grilling rather than wasting it on the grill. To the reviewer from Montreal: perhaps dried figs or a good black plum would be a decent substitute. Enjoy!

Great dressing and overall flavor combo! Used feta instead of goat cheese and roasted figs (12 min at 350 deg) but otherwise as written with garlicky sausages. Excellent recipe!

Can anyone recommend a nice substitute for the figs? Unfortunately, I don't have the best supermarket nearby so figs might not be available...

This was an excellent salad. I used sweet Italian sausage because my daughter does not like spicy, but otherwise followed the recipe. I will definitely make it again-we all enjoyed it very much.
