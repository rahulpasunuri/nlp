These brownies are great for the reasons the past two reviewers disliked them. My brownies were not dry at all. The sauce is excellent, but not necessary...especially if you're in a hurry for a chocolate fix. These will definitely satisfy any chocolate craving.

As I made these for a party instead of a dinner, I modifided this recipe to delete the sauce and frost with a white chocolate ganache. I think the brownies are a little dry and I didn't like the cinnamon very much - I would probably use fewer nuts, no cinnamon, and more coffee next time. The white chocolate ganache went very well with the brownies.

Although these were good, they were not great. The brownie taste was complex and definitely not for the person looking for some good old comfort food. Additionally, the combination of the brownies and the sauce was so rich that it was overpowering.

Oh My! Definitely a keeper! I made this for a Super Bowl party (sorry, Seattle) - put the brownies on individual decorative dishes, spooned sauce over, and added chocolate curls. Everyone raved about it! I think it would have been completely devoured except that the portion size is quite large - most people were cutting the brownie in half. When I make again, I will use a smaller cutter - I may even cut it into squares (cutting off the end pieces) so I won't have so much leftover. I am using the current leftover brownie bits to serve with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce (for another party). This brownie can be very casual without the sauce - but the sauce and chocolate curls make it a very elegant dessert.

I'll give this 4 forks, though I'm not a chocolate lover. My date thought they were great, so I gave him the leftovers to take home. Sinfully rich, and very moist, but the coffee flavor of the sauce was a bit strong. The delicate flavor of the white chocolate is lost between the sauce and the brownies. Added a few raspberries and a mint sprig to the plate; it looked like something in a restaurant. Might try with a cream-cheese-based sauce next time.

I have an embarassing history of botching most of what I try to cook, but these brownies came out fabulously! The white chocolate espresso sauce was to die for. Four forks up for this recipe.

It's sinful. I used a 9" springform pan for the brownies and put the finished sauce in a ketchup-type bottle. Just heated the bottle in the microwave and dizzled the brownies decoratively with the sauce. Very rich, but delicious.

Great stuff. Followed the recipe as written but used brown sugar instead. Also my 3rd and last egg fell so my version only had 2 eggs in it. Still turned out great - very moist. Will definitely make this easy dessert again. I've tried 2 other brownie recipes in epicurious but this one is my favorite so far.

These were very good the day I made them but even better the next day... I liked them better when they were completely cooled to room temperature and had firmed up a bit. I love the cinnamon flavor and found it more pronounced the next day -- it is unexpected and delicious.

Easy, elegant, impressive and wonderful blend of flavors. Brownie is rich and fudgey, sauce is decadent. This recipe has never failed me, nor has it ever failed to please our guests.

These are spectacular. They are so easy to make, but impress the heck out of guests because they seem so fancy. They are a sure crowd pleaser!!

Very easy to make. Does require some prep and planning ahead but really wonderful. Perfect for an intimate dinner for two or two couples.

These are great minus the sauce.
