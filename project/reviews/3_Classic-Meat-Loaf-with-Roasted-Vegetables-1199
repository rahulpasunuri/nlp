I have been a Bon Appetit subscriber for decades and have been this recipe since it came out. Everyone wants to eat my meatloaf, and some ask for it as there favorite meal. You can't go wrong with this one.

After looking through the reviews I made some small modifications... fresh garlic (2 cloves), minced the onions and backed off just a little on the Worcestershire. I also used parsnips, red potatoes and carrots. My family found this dish just average. Next time we'll just roast the veggies without all of the liquid. We'll also season them a bit too. The parsnips were right on flavor- wise, not quite as strong a flavor as a yam and better texture... I think.

As is, this is a 3 Fork recipe. However, with some simple changes, it is a 4 Forker. 1) Use meat loaf mix (1/2 lb ground beef, 1/2 lb ground pork, 1/2 lb ground lamb or veal). 2) Use fresh minced garlic. I like a lot in savory dishes. I use at least 4-5 cloves - usually more. 3) Add fresh chopped parsley. Other herbs, like oregano or basil might complement nicely, too. I have also been known to throw in some cumin. 4) Chop the vegetables slightly smaller than suggested. (Chunky but relatively fork-sized.) 5) Use as much broth as you need to ALMOST cover the veggies. 6) I like to use wheat bread for health purposes. It's an optional change.

I cut down on the amount of Worchestershire sauce, used fresh garlic, and cut the veggies in smaller chunks. The meatloaf was moist and flavorful, the vegetables were perfectly done. I made a simple pan gravy with the pan juices. All in all, a simple satisfying meal for a cold winter night.

I also had the problem of the vegetables taking forever to cook. As per previous a suggestion I will cut them up smaller to make sure that they are under the broth and possible add more broth since that really did make the vegetables tasty when served. I did use the garlic powder but next time I will use real garlic. Make sure you cut the onion up nice and fine so you don't get crispy bits of undercooked onion. All in all, the meatloaf was very tasty, the best part was that it was moist and tender.

I really didn't like this. My kids hated it. My friend liked it, so received the leftovers. I didn't like how it fell apart when I sliced it. Perhaps mincing the onion would be better, or at least "finely chopped". Way too much Worcestershire. Not crazy about the Ketchup on top when the sweet potatoes were so nearby. Sorry for the nasty review, but then, my mom made the best meatloaf. Anybody have a recipe link to Heaven??

I cannot make good meat loaf, no matter what recipe I use. But, I made this meat loaf (with a few changes), and it was good. I like meat loaf browned on all sides, so I left out the broth and vegetables and baked it in a pan. I added finely chopped green pepper with the onions. Next time I will use more catsup and less worchestershire sauce.

Based on previous reviewers' remarks and what I had on hand, I made this Christmas Eve with the following substitutions: 3 slices of lite 7-grain bread, 3 tbsp. of Worcestershire sauce and one of sherry, 1 tsp. minced garlic, 12 oz. of beef bullion + 2.5 oz. of sherry, one white potato and more carrots. FOOD JUST DOESN'T GET YUMMIER THAN THIS, especially the second day. My boyfriend, who is basically a grunter, couldn't stop talking about it and ate practically the whole thing one one sitting, the pig.

I think this is a very good recipe but I have made changes that improve it. Use half ground beef, half ground veal. Use two cloves of garlic, crushed, not powdered garlic. Try porcini broth (made from cubes available in specialty stores)instead of the beef broth. Skip the yams - the taste does not go with the dish. For any uncooked vegetables (those not in the broth), cook them quickly in the microwave while your family is eating the rest of the vegetables and sneak them back into the broth. You can get this into the oven in ten minutes and actually eat it on a week-night.

The key to this recipe is to cut vegetables small and keep them in the broth around the meat loaf. If they are out of the broth, they do not cook. My husband loved this recipe.

This is a great, easy recipe. My young children (3 under 5) love sweet potatoes so it makes getting them to eat the meatloaf a lot easier.

The best I've ever eaten! I've made this 20+ times. Even my 21 month old raves about this. A classic good for cold winter nights.

I was disappointed with this recipe and have decided that I just don't like meatloaf. It was slightly better than the recipe using onion soup mix. Even my husband (who is very easy to please and says I'm too critical about my cooking) told me he didn't really enjoy it. Guess I'll give up on meatloaf...

This is the BEST meat loaf I have ever made or tasted. It is so moist and flavorful. yum yum

We thought this meatloaf was really great (although Ive never made meatloaf before so I dont know what to compare it to!) however..I wasnt so sure about the vegegtables. 2 potatoes and 4 carrots really dont fit in the pan so we used 1 yam and 1 reg potato and 2 carrots. It came out moist and delicious. I also broiled the meatloaf for the last 5 mins to brown it a bit on top.

My husband and I absolutely love this meatloaf! It's perfectly moist and juicy and the flavor is incredible. Instead of garlic powder, I minced 3 garlic cloves and also added a chopped green pepper. The leftovers are wonderful reheated with the extra broth and served on a roll...mmmm mmmm!Also, I quartered all the vegetables and they cooked thoroughly.

This meatloaf came out so moist and delicious! It was soooo easy to make too! I put the loaf together the night before cooking it and it may have given it extra flavor. I cut the vegetables smaller than the recipe says and after uncovering after the first 45 minutes the vegetables were very soft. I had to remove the vegetables before continuing and I added some broccoli at the end and it gave it more color. I will definitely make this again!

The vegetables were fine, the meatloaf was awful. My family likes meatloaf and to a person this was rejected as just bad.

YUM! I am not a meatloaf fan, but I was looking for a change of pace. This is the best meatloaf my fiance' and I have ever eaten. Both the meat and veges were moist and tender. Easy clean up, too. I am sensitive to wheat, so I substituted one cup of cornflake crumbs for the bread. Also, in a pinch, I substituted minced garlic for the garlic powder and cut it in half. Next time I may add more beef broth, as we really enjoyed pouring the juices over the entire dish.

I've never been a meatloaf lover, and this recipe converted me. This is hands-down, THE best meatloaf I've ever had. The vegetables are great. I don't know why some of the previous reviewers had trouble with the vegetables not softening - mine are always falling apart. Yum. I would suggest cutting them into smaller pieces than the recipe says. I have also recently been substituting Dale's (brand) marinade for the worcestershire sauce, with excellent results. Also, I would not suggest reducing the liquid amounts, as this is what flaors the veggies so nicely. This one's a keeper at my house.

I thought this meatloaf was good, but next time will cut back on the garlic and pepper (by at least half). I did have trouble with the veggies being undone, and will probably zap them in the microwave first.

We decided to give this a try. After almost 2 hours, veggies were still hard. Had to take them out and cook them on top of stove. When they were done, put them back in pan w/meatloaf for a few minutes. Did not care for the taste at all. Liked my own meatloaf recipe much, much better. Would not make this again.

Very delicious, however, I did increase the beef to 2 pounds to create a firmer meatloaf. My family loves this recipe, also, have used the meat loaf recipe for meatballs and marinara.

Look no further for the best meatloaf recipe. My only suggestion would be to replace most of the worcheshire(sp?) sauce with your favorite steak sauce or catsup. Everyone wanted the recipe, and said it was better than Mom's used to be.

This meatloaf is very flavorful, though I would recommended using less broth and water. The excess amount made the meatloaf fairly crumbly. That said, with the tasty veggies, this recipe can be your whole dinner. It's a nice break from cooking sides dishes to accompany the meatloaf.

I followed the recipe to a "T". After two hours, the russet potato quarters were like rocks, and the sweet potato quarters and carrots were not much better. The meatloaf was a bland, soggy, fall-apart mess. I tried it again, using freshly ground lean veal and fresh garlic, oregano, thyme, rosemary and parsley. It was a repeat of the first disaster.

We are not big meatloaf fans, but after reading all the reviews I had to try it. Well, it is the best we have tasted & the veggies with it were great too & it makes and easy supper. I have never seen my husband eat so much meatloaf in one sitting. A keeper for sure.

After so many mediocre meat loaves, this one is excellent. From my teenage son, "If you have to eat meatloaf,this one is the best." High praise indeed.

My husband was a little hesitant when he saw me putting broth in with the meatloaf (what are you going to do, boil it?), but all concerns vanished once he tasted it. He even ate a leftover meatloaf sandwich the next day, which has to be a first!! Will definitely make it again!

This was great, my boys even ate it and they've always turned their noses up at meatloaf in the past. It never occured to me before to roast veggies with a meatloaf while it was in the oven, duh!!! I cut the amount of garlic powder in half, thought a tablespoon might be a bit overwhelming.

This is my ALL TIME FAVORITE meatloaf recipe. I will never, ever, make another meatloaf recipe again.

We thought the combination of roasted veggies and meatloaf a wonderous idea. Thoughly enjoyed it.
