We have been making this recipe for over 10 years and love it. For such a simple ingredient list is really has great flavor. I've made it for some self proclaimed "curry experts" and they have raved about it. I use a shallot and don't always use cream (subbing with yogurt/milk). Great recipe!

I made this with apple chutney instead of mango chutney (had none), fish stock instead of clam juice (ran out), and low fat yogurt instead of cream (cut calories),jasmine rice cooked along with the onion and sauce with shrimp added later and it was still absolutely delicious. What makes the dish is the curry and chutney. Highly recommended!

Just great and except for the peeled and deveining very easy. Made a couple changes -- used low fat milk and yogurt instead of cream. Also substituted Stonewall Kitchen Curry Mango Sauce for Mango Chutney. Yum!

Excellent weeknight dinner dish. We doubled the amount of curry powder, but otherwise made it exactly as written, and added chopped red pepper and chopped peanuts as condiments. Hot mango chutney added just the right amount of spice.

This dish has become one of my weeknight staples. Chicken is a great replacement for the shrimp and I highly recommend using green or red curry paste instead of powder. Don't forget the condiments. I usually use diced red pepper, green onion and chopped salted peanuts.

Great curry dish--I added 2x the curry powder--I used Madras curry powder-- otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The house smelled sooo good. Will certainly make this again.

This was delicious, but next time, I'll reduce the amount of red onion. My sauce was a little thin, so I'll let it reduce for a longer amount of time as well. Served with chopped peanuts, green bell pepper and golden raisins. Everyone loved it!

This recipe is easy and quick. Great presentation for a dinner party. For condiments, I added chopped green onions, peanuts, chutney, shredded coconut and dried currants. The presentation IS all in the condiments! I served this at a dinner party and discovered one guest did not like curry, as I was preparing it. I went a little light on the curry for him. He vowed to "try" it, and by the end of the night, he was asking for the recipe!

LOVED IT! I was in the mood for something a bit exotic, but had worked all day, and so was looking for a recipe that was quick and easy to prepare. This curry fit the bill. Despite its simplicity, it was WONDERFUL! So savory, and delicious. My husband loved it too. I wish I had made more. We devoured it. I made it exactly as written. The seasoning was relatively mild (which I'm sure would suit many), and next time I may kick it up a bit. This is destined to be one of our regular family favorites.

WOW!!WOW!!WOW!! that's all I can say about this one! I love curries and this is the easiest and delicious one. I might substitute low fat cream instead of whipping and do some modifications as I will be tempted to eat it everyday.Try it at least once!!

WONDERFUL - great for buffet- great for a dinner party. So simple to throw together. Will blow your guests away. Flavor was terrific - even better next day. The condiments make your table.

Simple and delicious. I sprinkled diced red pepper, green onion and peanuts over the dish. Tasted wonderful. Next time I'll try this with chicken and add potato cubes. My only regret is that I didn't make enough.

Liked it quite well, but agree that the addition of a few veggies makes it even better. We use a hot curry and it's a staple for our cool-weather menus.

Rave reviews on this easy recipe. I used 1 1/2 lbs shrimp and upped the other ingredients accordingly, not skimping on the hot curry powder. It was a big hit with the seafood eaters at Sunday dinner.

We didn't find this anything special. Much prefer a creamier sauce with chutney as a condiment. There are better recipes on this website.

I made this last night and thought it was delicious! I served it with chopped peanuts, toasted coconut, chutney and some chopped veggies. I found it to be a very simple recipe that turns out great. Next time I will add more curry powder, and maybe even make it with some steamed vegetables added with the shrimp.

This is one of my favorite shrimp recipes. I've made it for guests on a few occasions, and it receives rave reviews. And it's so easy to make!

Fantastic quick dish. I had to throw together a nice meal on a weeknight with about one-hour notice and I had nothing in the pantry. I was able to go to the market and make this dish with time to spare! The recipe is as simple as can be, looks beautiful and tastes great. What more could you ask for? I did add a pinch of turmeric for a more vibrant color. Definitely pass the accompaniments on the side. I added coconut in addition to those listed. I think this would work just as well with chicken, too.

I've prepared this dish for guests at least five times. Each time it has been very well received and always, someone has asked for the recipe. It is easy, and it is just very good. Use the condiments, chopped nuts, coconut, chopped bell pepper. I highly recommend this recipe.

Delicious, simple, quick curry dish. Perfect for all kinds of tweaking. Try it over basmati or jasmine rice.

This is an outstanding recipe. I did not have clam juice so used a little chicken broth and the results were fantastic. SOOOO easy, too

I have only made red curries before and was somewhat skeptical about this recipe but tried it anyhow. It was delicious and have since made it several times.

Prior to sauteing the shrimp I used a little curry powder, b/c I like curry. It worked fine. I forgot to add the green onions, it was still very good. It is quick and easy and the color is gorgeous.
