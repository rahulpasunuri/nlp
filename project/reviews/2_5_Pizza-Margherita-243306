Easy dough and tasty toppings. My American taste buds could have used more cheese to balance out the wateriness of all the tomato, but this makes a great base recipe to build upon.

I thought this recipe was great, though if you are not using a pizza stone I would bake them directly on the oven rack for a few minutes at the end to crisp up the crust. I also put a bit of feta on top.

Reading the reviews below, the reason that most of you are unhappy with the dough receipe is that in Napoli they use a special flour that is very low in ash content it is called Farina Tipo 00 that flour makes 100% difference, the next part of the receipe is using a very good sweet fresh tomatoes and fresh mozzerella. Try I bet you'll never use any other flour again. you can get online at many different sites and some very good itakian deli carry it also, here is a link: I have made this pizza in firhouse many times and my guys love it! http://markethallfoods.com/store/index .php? main_page=product_mh_info&cPath=10&pro ducts_id=649&gclid=CKSdtN3m_ZsCFRJM5Qo dbkdS_A

Was ok, but after searching for a good recipe for an authentic Neapolitan pizza crust, this other one was BY FAR the best dough recipe i've come across! And the cooking method, using a pizza stone at 550 was important:) http://www.101cookbooks.com/archives/001199.html

I was not thrilled with the dough recipe either, although I didn't have a problem with the dough rising, as long as each time the dough is coated with olive oil during the rising process. I thought that the recipe tasted a bit too "grainy" with so much semolina. As far as the toppings, I didn't think the oregano was necessary and used more fresh basil (with the leaves whole). Overall, not bad, but still looking for a better crust...

This dough recipe must be wrong by way of the bread flour and semolina. I made this twice, both times, it did not rise to perfection, and baked tough and dry. I hope someone else tries this recipe, (the toppings were very good) and shares their experience. thans!
