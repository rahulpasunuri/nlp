I rather liked this one. One alteration since I am not a huge ham guy, used chipotle chicken sausage. It is a nice way to warm up this cold weekend. The romaine is a little bland, so next time I think I will go with the spicier bite of arugula.

One fork, because I made it "as written" and thought it was "just okay". This recipe BEGS for tweaks, and the reviews below certainly offer many. How is it a recipe that needs so many tweaks gets such a high fork rating? Are you not simply rating the recipe YOU CREATED? Fork ratings means very little, at least as they pertain to the RECIPE. Many people evidently have a high opinion of THEIR OWN COOKING. I'm just sayin'...

(See review below) I also added a pecorino romano rind!!!

Rating: 4
Made additions as per other reviewers (and some of my own!). Added two carrots and half a chopped onion to the first step when cooking the garlic. (One 19 oz can of beans is two cups already.) Used 2 cups of cannellini beans and 1 cup of chickpeas. Used one full can of chicken broth (2 cups). Used 3 chorizo links, and added 1/3 cup of white wine. Since I had some time, I let it boil down 30-45 minutes instead of five. Served with homemade corn muffins instead of the baguettes. Very tasty (and forgiving) recipe!

Agree with many of the other alterations made before me: added onions/carrots, pureed one can of beans, cooked with a parmesan rhine. Yum!

This recipe, with some alterations, was absolutely fantastic. The final product was 4 forks, but since I made so many changes I am rating the original recipe 3 forks. I omitted the ham but added onion, carrots, celery and red pepper flakes. To the broth I added a parmesan rind (as previously suggested) and some red wine. I used three cans of cannelini beans, mashing up half a can in the food processor. Lastly, I added a ton of freshly chopped flat leaf Italian parsley. The final result was fabulous. I will be making this on windy, cold days for years to come.

his was the easiest most fabulous bean soup I have ever had. I used their option of arugula. And I didn't have stewed tomatoes so I used a 16 oz container of trader joes medley cherry toms, drizzled them with olive oil, and baked at 400 till wrinkly, then mashed them with some sugar, kosher salt, and a couple tablespoons of tomato sauce. An amazingly delicious recipe. The only thing I would do differently would be to chop the arugula.

I rated this recipe four stars not because it is truly an indescribably delicious recipe, but because the outcome was amazing, given the minimal amount of effort in making it. This was very, very good (3 forks). I used a nitrate-free, uncured ham, organic beans and tomatoes, and fresh arugula from our CSA. Made the recipe as written (minus the bread), and the entire family loved it. It had a creamy consistency because of the beans--but without any dairy! Definitely a great mid-week recipe.

Tasty light stew, perfect for a summer evening. I find that adding a handful of torn fresh basil leaves and a pinch of sugar brings out the flavour.

It was really surprising how good this dish was. I added onion, carrots, and a special ingredient- parmesan rind. It is a great way to use the nub at the end of the parmesan and it really added a nice flavor.

Had leftovers form Easter, so used Honey-Baked ham. Didn't want to run to the store just for stewed tomatoes, so used plain canned, but that allowed me to add sage. Also had some kale, so tossed that in instead of the other greens.Yummy and simple.

Wow! Despite reading the comments about how fast, easy, and delicious this stew is, this still impressed me! I used pancetta,I added more garlic, crushed pepper, and a touch of red wine. I had some garbanzo at hand, so I used that, and one can of canellini. I pureed the soup with a hand blander,and add a touch of cream. I added the arugula on the plate because hubby does not care for it, and I don't think it did it for me. I will make it the "whole" way next time and compare.

This made a delicious vegetarian soup by omitting the ham. To make up for the missing meat, I added a little extra garlic, shallots, and a good amount of red pepper flakes to the first step. I finished it with a little cream to make it a bit richer. Lovely!

I searched the Epi app on my iPhone while I was on the bus on the way home from work. Since I already had many of the ingredients for this stew in my pantry, it took a quick stop at the corner market and the dish was ready when my husband walked in the door, half an hour after I got home. We had a crisp green salad to make it a perfectly well-rounded, satisfying dinner. One thing: it didn't hold up well for next day re-heating, contrary to my expectation. However, we really enjoyed the ease of prep and the final result.

I was skeptical at first,but it all came together, it was fabulous & easy too. I substituted fresh spinach for the greens & sprinkled some grated pecorino on top each bowl. Next time I may try smoked sausage in place of the ham.

I will add my name to the list of reviewers who thought this dish was super easy and super tasty! Even after reading all of the reviews about this recipe, I was STILL suprised at how quickly the dish came together and how hearty and delicious it tasted. I stayed pretty true to the recipe...I just added one more clove of garlic, used San Marzano tomatoes that I canned this summer and smoked ham. I was really conscious of the salt in the dish based on other reviews (and used ingredients with little to no salt to make sure it wasn't over- salted)...and ended up having to add salt at the end (which is certainly preferable to having an over-salted dish!). I used arugula and really liked the flavor that it added. Perfect dish to ward off the rain and cold! And the leftovers tasted great today, too!

This amazinly easy stew has become a standby weeknight meal. So delicious and quick. Instead of 2 cans of cannellini beans I use one of cannellini and one of garbonzo beans. I have made it with arugula, spinach and kale, and I find kale is the best as less hearty greens become too soft. Making the toast is essential to enjoying the stew!

Wonderful recipe. My husband, who is very wary of soups and beans in general, really liked it, and suggested having it again. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used bacon instead of ham, because that's what I had on hand. I also took out some of the beans and pureed them before putting them back in, thickening it up and creating the illusion that it wasn't quite as "beany" as it was, which may have added to my success. I was skeptical at the lack of seasonings, but it really was delicious just as written! I'll definitely be making this again.

This was good and really easy but WAY too salty. Used low-sodium broth but still salty. Next time I will use chopped tomatoes with no salt added, and try smoked ham.

Really easy and fast. I used spinach instead of the romaine for nutritional purposes. Tasted great. This would taste great with other veggies in it too, like if you had some leftover veggies you need to get rid of. Did not need seasoning, but make sure to stick with low-sodium broth & tomatoes or else it could taste too salty.

Love it! I've made this 3 times in the last two weeks. I use only one can of beans, no ham, and twice as much broth as the recipe calls for. I also use baby spinach and I make the baguette with plenty of olive oil and garlic salt. A perfect winter week-night meal.

Oh what warming comfort food; so good and so easy! I followed the recipe as closely as I could with the exception of adding one more clove of garlic to make it 3, and using white kidney beans and Great Northern beans as that's all I had on hand. Fine substitutes and maybe even preferable. The baby romaine (green and red) happens to come in a 5-oz box of organic greens and was just delicious. (It looks like too much at first, but is not. It wilts down to a perfect amount.) I did want to see what romaine tasted like in a soup, and I was not disappointed. My ham was also smoked ham. I will be making this time and time again. Maybe it deserves more than 3 forks. It's a winner.

I have been looking for recipes to introduce more legumes into my familys diet and this fit the bill. I used ham I had in the freezer from Christmas and couldnt find the greens so I used fresh, baby spinach. I also used canned broth with roasted garlic to add another layer of flavor. I served it with homemade bread and everyone was sopping up the broth with it. Even my step-son who avoids new foods like the plague ate it up. Next time I will double it to be sure there are leftovers. Yummy!

I was late coming home from work so my husband attempted this recipe(he rarely lifts a pot or pan). He found it extremely easy to make. We used low-fat kielbasa (cooked first) instead of ham and spinach instead of romaine. It was SO tasty!

Very easy make and was really good-- even better the next day. Yes, it is amusing when a cook changes the WHOLE recipe, but I did sub out the aruglua for mixed winter greens (turnip, mustard & collard mix) and used 1/8 of a cup olive oil. 1/4 seems like a lot in this dish. Using a quality ham is a must, the chain-store supermarket variety makes for a flabby salty stew.

At first I ignored this simple recipe as it looked kind of lame but had some ham to use up so gave it a try and it was great. Could not find baby arugula in my local supermarket so used kale and doubled the garlic and dish was great.

To start, I probably spent more time reading the reviews than I did cooking this meal. I prepared the recipe exactly as written with arugula, and after reading the good and not so good reviews I think it boils down to the quality of ingedients you use.

I always like to read the reviews on this site - they often are helpful and sometimes make me laugh. This is especially true when cooks subtitute ingredients and you end up wondering if they haven't in fact created an entirely new dish. (You you the type "I didn;t have beef so I used salmon, I didn't have white wine so I used ginger ale. I didn't have dill so I used parsely, sage rosemary AND thyme.") With this in mind let me offer some tweaks on this simple and healthful recipe that I think keep the spirit of the original. So..I didn;t have stewed tomatoes so I sauted some chopped red onion and celery (whihc I did have) and then added the garlic and a can of diced tomatoes. I also had a sprig of rosemary which I threw in as the stew was simmering (and the removed). When I was buying ham I saw a lovely smoked pork chop in the local market so I cubed that and used it instead of baked ham. I threw in the bone as well and it gave the stew a great smokey flavour. The only other thing I recommend is shredding the babay arugula. It blended in nicely with the stew and seemed a bit more elegant. There was no "hubby" to please but I enjoyed this.

Rating: 3
Loved this dish, especially the added bright green color of the romaine! I added onion and celery and a small amount of green pepper while cooking the garlic. Who ever heard of stew without onions or celery? Also, a touch of salt was necessary. I served it with breadsticks (homemade) and my husband loved the dish. It was easy and fast even though I had to cook up my own white beans as none were available (I live on an island and we don't have everything in cans!).

The olive oil could probably be reduced by half. And I used half spinach, half baby romaine, and thought it tasted great.

Had this for dinner my husband loved it, then my married son came over ate half the leftovers and took the other half to his wife. It was great

This is the best ham and bean soup recipe ever! I accidently added a can of tomatoes with green chilies and it was a delicious mistake. I also added one more can of beans.

A nice alternate to chili for a cool eve or an apres ski dinner! I also used spinach (simmered for only 1 min) with great success.

I agree that I was surprised that such an easy and seemingly pedestrian recipe could be so extraordinary. I made this because it was fast and it was cold outside! Delicious! I usually don't like when people say that changed this and that, but I will throw this out: I used escarole instead of arugula because I had that in the house, and (great choice) replaced the ham with Aidell's pre-cooked artichoke/garlic turkey sausages, topped the stew with fresh basil, and YUM!! Will definately make this again!!

I agree! This stew is so easy and so good. This can definitely be a company meal - just don't tell them how easy it is!! :)

Very, very good for something fast. I used spinach and that worked fine. I also used less oil, just because I'm careful about calories and fat. Simmered it longer while bread baked to blend flavors. This will take its place along side escarole soup as a weeknight favorite.

An excellent quick, filling, and tasty recipe!!! I slightly crushed some of the beans with a potato masher before adding the greens. This slightly thickened the broth and smoothed out the entire dish. This is a very flexible recipe. There are so many choices to substitute for the ham. Right now I'm thinking Kielbasa or knockwurst. Mmmmmm!!!

This is quick and easy and fairly healthy. I too added some fresh grated parm on top and the crusty bread is a must on the side! Will definitley do again this winter.

Wow - even my six year old loved this recipe! That is a miracle in itself! I added diced chicken breast and used baby spinach instead of arugula. I also added a bit of sweet basil and oregano and topped the stew with fresh parmesan. Fabulous and so quick!

This soup is so quick and soooo yummy, very hearty! My husband, kids and friends love it! We make it at least once a week, but there are never any leftovers. He thinks it is even worthy of company and they'll never know it only took you 10mins.!!! Add some leftover parmesean rinds while cooking.

For the amount of time and effort this dish takes, it deserves four forks. Amazingly simple ingredients with delicious results. Used Muir Glen diced tomatoes, baby arugula from a greens mix and toppped with parmigianno reggiano and fresh pepper.

I was a little skeptical that such a pedestrian group of ingredients would culminate in something as good as the other reviews claimed, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it really was delicious! And quick and easy as well. I tripled the amount of garlic and topped the soup with some good-quality asiago before serving, and it was a fantastic winter week-night meal. Both my SO and I loved it.

Loved this recipe, very quick and delicious. Didn't have stewed tomatoes, used whole tomatoes and also subbed sliced canadian bacon because I had no ham. Would use chicken with this as well!

wow -- who knew that canned beans and canned tomatoes could create such a delicious soup in just a half an hour? Minimal prep, maximum flavor. This is my new go-to comfort soup. P.S. - I tossed in some red pepper flakes with the garlic and it gave the soup a lovely little kick.

Delicious quick meal! My husband turned up his nose when he asked what I was making but confessed later he really enjoyed it. No cannellini beans where I live so I had to use Romano beans plus baby spinach. Will make again.

Easy, fast and simple. Not really a ham fan so a great solution for the left over holiday ham. Added asparagus tips just because we had them. The base is simple and easy. Since it was new years, we added black eyed peas. Just fine. Still have some ham so more stew tonight.

Really tasty and simple! I used an extra can of beans and broth..also (accidently) used canned tomatoes with green chilis.

Wonderfully simple and quick without being a thin or flavorless dish. I used homemade chicken broth and some Rainbow Swiss Chard--any fresh green would do. Also added a small amount of packaged Italian Seasoning (rosemary, sage, oregano, thyme, etc.) A quick weeknight dinner that will hold for that late arrival.

Super good, super fast, super easy. Used 3 14oz cans of cannellini and 5oz of baby spinach.

great recipe. my modifactions - use crushed tomatoes instead of stewed for a thicker tomato base and used kale for greens (i cut out stem from kale so it would cook faster and to avoid any bitter taste). loved it!

this is a wonderful fast hearty meal. the only thing i would change is to use fewer greens or more beans.
