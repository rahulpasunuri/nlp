Amazingly tasty and an indispensable ingredient in the Georgian Pork Stew. Also delicious as a condiment with grilled meat.

WOW. Really excellent flavor, texture, etc. I used green jalapenos and threw in 1/4 of a habanero for good measure. Really added a great complexity to the stew.

This is FABULOUS.....as a salsa connoiseuer, this might be my new favorite. Since there were no red jalapenos available, I used green. Instead of red bell pepper, I used yellow because it has the same sweetness, and I decided that food processing red and green together would probably result in an unappealing brown. To me, this sauce tastes as though it's a fusion of Jalisco-Style Mexican and Indian foods. What a great and spicy combo! The next time I make this, I plan on adding some olive oil and using it on a beef tenderloin in lieu of chimmichurri sauce.

We really liked this - very spicy. I changed the order (cilanto and basil last) to keep it from turning out a brown mush.
