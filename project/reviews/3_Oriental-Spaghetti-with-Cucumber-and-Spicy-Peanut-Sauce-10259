It nice and SPICY! The trick is cutting the cucumber just right. It should be 3 inches long, 1/8 of an inch wide, and under an inch tall. I also added an extra cucumber.

This was tasty, but I could not get the cucumbers to mix with the noodles! Perhaps it would have worked better with soba noodles, as others suggested, but I didn't see them at the store I was at. I used crunchy peanut butter, as other reviewers had suggested, and I'm not sure I liked that. I also increased the proportion of sauce, which I always do, and added toasted sesame seeds, which I think made it more like dishes I've ordered. I think next time I'll use honey instead of sugar, more soy, a bit of rice wine vinegar, and if I still can't find the soba noodles, I'll use rice noodles or lighter, thinner cappellini. I liked the flavor, just needs a bit of work! I hope it tastes good leftover...

Rice noodles. Whisked peanut butter with lemon juice, honey, a bit of soy and a drop of tamarind paste. Pureed garlic and ginger with a bit of hot water and added to mixture. Topped with Julienned carrot, cucumber and Spring Onion. YUM!

Made this with the following changes: used lo mein noodles added carrots and red bell pepper, julienned added fresh ginger used lime juice and chunky peanut butter served cold dress at the last moment - it was delish!

sorry, but this tastes just like it looks: like a random whats-left-in-the-cabinets mix. You have a mix of very bland tastes with overpowering peanut butter. nothing interesting here, even if for a staple.

Delicious! Although I thought that the water diluted the sauce too much, so subsequently I've doubled the amount of sauce (and added a little extra peanut butter) and added much less water. I also like to add matchsticked carrots, or stir-fry zucchini, broccoli, and carrots to toss with the pasta and sauce and serve it warm.

We loved this recipe! I was a bit unsure of the ingredients, but it all tasted great together, and it was so very quick and easy. The only thing different I did was add matchstick-sized carrots which were a great compliment. This is definitely a keeper.

This is a great staple dinner, especially in summer. I use soba noodles and add cilantro and carrot - very good

This was fantastic, but I did make the following changes. I added fresh ginger to the sauce and used chunky peanut butter. Instead of cucumber I used a package of shredded broccoli slaw and the green onion. Super easy and the family, who thought they would hate it, loved it.

This dish sounded unusual at first, but it's become a weeknight staple. It's quick to make, I usually have all the ingredients at hand, and it's so flavorful.

I just use this recipe for the sauce (for stir-fry), but that in itself works very well. I like to add ginger and/or coconut milk for extra zing. A hint: If you use boiling water, the sauce will have a thicker consistency.

Great summer salad dish for barbecues! A few changes... I omitted the noodles, added carrots and cut those and the cucumbers into "matchsticks". It travels excellently if you keep the vegetables separate from the sauce and toss together at the last minute or have guests pour on the sauce themselves. Vegetables can be prepared the night before... and no need to reheat anything!

I have made this recipe several times and made adjustments. The spaghetti is fine, but this is even better made with soba noodles. I use 2-3 tablespoons of lime juice instead of the lemon and double the garlic. I also add a few dashes of hot sauce. I prefer chunky peanut butter so that some bits of peanut remains in the sauce. And you can add other cruchy veggies that you have on hand. I find that slivered radishes make this dish look prettier.

My husband didn't like the sound of this recipe at all and implored me not to make it. Nonetheless--naturally--I forged ahead. I took Boston's cue and used chunky peanut butter--worked fine. I served this cold at a tailgate, and, even though it's not the most visually appealing dish (especially when the chilled temperature made the sauce a bit, um, gummy, and the cukes a bit clear), everyone raved about it, including my husband. Next time I might add the recommended julienned carrots for color.

It works really well if you use chunky peanut butter. I also used another teaspoon of soy sauce, and a pinch of salt. You can also use a chili-garlic paste that you can find in Asian markets in place of the hot pepper flakes too. I also added some bean sprouts to the noodles, since I've seen it prepared like that in some Chinese restaurants. It also works just as well with lo-mein noodles.

I loved the sauce, but did not like the cucumbers. It made it virtually impossible to reheat. Would make a good main dish if chicken were added. I plan on making it again and leaving out the cucumbers, adding bite-sized pieces of baked chicken and julienned carrots.

I really enjoyed this dish. I made it as a dish for a buffet for my vegetarian friends. Everyone one likes it. I don't do spicy, so I just leave the chili peppers out.

I'll have to disagree with the other reviewers. This was a great little lunch! Maybe the flavors are better after the noodles have sat in the fridge overnight. I thought the salt content was fine, but then again I rarely salt anything. I used soba rather than spaghetti. I'm sure that improved the flavor a little bit.

This was a quick, easy, and tasty recipe. I served it with a tomato, red onion, and basil sald drizzled with olive oil as a light dinner. My only suggestion is adding about 1/4tsp of salt. The recipe calls for "salt to taste," which I normally take to mean a dash or two.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. I think it would make a pretty good side dish, but certainly not a main dish. I am going to try once again, but have chicken breasts grilled up to eat with it.
