I've made this several times. With Sea Bass when it is just two of us ($$), or substituted halibut when having a dinner party. Both fishes work very well with it. This is a delicious, and easy to prepare meal! I like to serve it with sauteed Swiss Chard on the side.

Seabass is so deleicate and buttery tasting that this lime sauce over powers it completely. Way tooo tart. Thankfully I spooned the Mojo sauce to the side of the fish, to dip into, rahter than over top like the recipe suggests.

I just made this for dinner using halibut fillets and it was awesome! The Mojo sauce was the perfect blend of flavors and not overpowering at all. Using fresh limes and garlic makes a difference. I thickened it a little to make it less runny. I'm adding this dish to my growing repertoire of fish recipes.

I wasn't crazy about this dish. The lime was way too overpowering. I had half lime and half lemon and it still was too much. Also, I'd rather know the inside cooking temperature of the fish rather than just how many minutes it needs to cook for, bec that's what is most important. Really disappointed in this one.

According to Whole Foods, Chilean Sea Bass is back!! Out of danger of extinction! Go for it!

This is a delicious preparation that works well with other flavorful white fish as well. By the way, a note to anyone ELSE tempted to lecture cooks on Chilean Sea Bass: Please don't, at least not several times in one recipe. We get it. Most cooks are aware of the issue, and many of us search for recipes to get ideas about interesting preparation methods and flavors. Perhaps instead of making us all scroll through these things as we try to figure out whether lime or lemon juice is better for a sauce, Epicurious could drop a footnote on certain "controversial" ingredients. These aren't actually reviews.

The first time I made this dish was for company. My husband and guests LOVED it! Would definately do it again! Was very yummy. Served with black beans (homemade with hamhock), brussel sprouts and artichoke with dipping sauce.

We are now cooking this for maybe the 5th time. We have substituted lemon for about 1/2 of the lime. Other than that, it's an absolute winner in our house. Everyone will eat it and it's on our diet!! I look forward to making it again.

The fish technique is fine, but the Moho sauce? Disgusting. Too strong, sour, oily, overall horrible. I can't believe someone's kids ate this! Not only would I never make this again, but if I were served this dish in a restaurant, I would never go back. That bad.

I cooked this without the cilantro and avacado for serving - added fresh parley flakes on it out of the oven and it worked well. The Moho sauce is very strong and tangy, and I cut the lime juice down. For extra zest I added shiitake mushroom slices but porcini would have survived the Moho sauce better. Still was a true winner!

Delicious! We served this over the "Green Rice" from the Cumin-Dusted sea bass recipe - VERY GOOD:)

Very, very good. I made this for a small dinner party and it received rave reviews. One of the guests was alergic to avocado, and said that the dish tasted fantastic without it.

I didn't care for this recipe much. I followed the recipe exactly (though cut it in half for 2 instead of 4). I thought the sauce was MUCH too acidic (note the lime juice/vinegar to fat ratio). On the positive side, it was quick and easy to make, and my husband did like it. In his opinion, the avocado balanced the acidity of the sauce. We are both big fans of cilantro, which is what drew us to the recipe to begin with.

Chilean Sea Bass is being over-fished and is very endangered. Do your part to save these fish and stop buying them.
