Terrible. FOllowed directions to the "T" and only came up with strawberry jam in the end. Not worth the time.

I was nervous to try the recipe after all the negative comments. However, I really wanted to make these! I followed the recipe exactly, except that I boiled the mixture after the corn syrup was added longer than 3 minutes. Not sure how much longer  maybe 5-6 minutes? It was getting pretty thick and I tried the frozen plate trick mentioned in one of the messages. I will buy a candy thermometer for the next time! They came out great  a bit stickier than they should have been, but the general texture and flavor was delicious. The essence of strawberries. My main comment is that a smaller dish should probably be used to set the jellies. I would use an 8 x 8 next time, so that they are more like cubes. The larger dish made them a bit thinner, but I suspect that was so they would be lower calorie per piece. For those commenters who wanted a firmer gum drop consistency, that is not what pate de fruits typically are like.. they are softer and more delicate than gumdrops or gummy candy.

pate de fruit needs to be cooked to a precise temperature, usually 107 C (225F) but varies depending on type of fruit used. the best way to check if it's ready is to freeze a small plate, put a small drop on the plate, put back in the freezer, wait a minute, take out and press on it, if it is not sticky but still soft to the touch it's done. i make this about once a week at work and still have trouble with it. Don't be discouraged, but it takes definitely takes more than three minutes. this recipe is completely non-helpful.

I tried this 3 times and each time was left with a gooey jam-like mess. I added more pectin, cooked it longer, tried letting it firm up over night in the fridge and no such luck. Anyone have a better recipe?

I'm glad that I'm not the only one who had a problem. I made them and then thought I'd have them set in the fridge. They got firm, but wet-like. I cut them and coated in LOTS of sugar. They taste good, but the consistency is off.

Here's my recipe for fruit jellies, maybe this'll work for some of you. For the parts that call for liquid, you can use pureed strawberries, juices, strong tea infusions, almost anything, with the exception of citrus, mango, pineapple, which contain enzymes that prevent the pectin from jelling properly. mix well in a small pan (mixture will be thick, but that's ok): 1 3/4 oz pectin 1/2 tsp baking soda 2 oz liquid (pureed fruit or whatever) In a larger saucepan, mix: 2 c. sugar 4 oz liquid (fruit puree) put both of them over low heat and stir alternatingly. When the larger saucepan begins to boil and the foam has subsuded in the smaller pan, slowly add the contents of the small pan to the large pan, whisking constantly. Boil 1 minute, stir in any other flavor or color, and pour into an 8x8 pan lined withgreased plastic wrap or foil. Let cool, and when it's set up (give it an hour or two), turn out onto sugared wax paper. Cut out shapes and toss with sugar. Let air dry on a rack 24 hours. DO NOT put them in the fridge; moisture will condense on them when you take them our, turning them into a runny mess. Store at room temp.

We can make it three. I tried this recipe 3 times today. It is far from easy. The first batch was too runny. The second batch was too thick. I think the third batch worked, but it is still setting up so I don't know for sure yet. The recipe is far from easy. Tips: Use exactly 2 cups of strawberries. Use more like 2.25 Tbsp pectin. Stir constantly and boil the fruit for about 10 minutes, until it reaches about 205 degrees. I had high hopes for this recipe, but am so disappointed, and I, too, am a long-time Epicurious user but this is my first review, that is how disappointed I am. If I can perfect the technique, I may try again, but beware.

I agree with the below reviewer. I was disappointed enough in this recipe that I felt compelled to review for the first time (long-time Epicurious reader and user). I also found the results to be much too runny and had been expecting a much firmer consistency. I may or may not serve these at my holiday party (they are currently in the fridge in the hopes they'll firm up even more) since they look like a preschool craft project. The recipe was anything but "easy," contrary to the description.

I made this recipe and had it set overnight. It was very runny, so I added more pectin and let it sit over another night. It was much firmer, but not the consistancy of gum drops like I thought it would be. Very pretty though

I made this and had them set overnight. They were not very firm so I added more pectin, and let them sit over one more night. They were much firmer, but very wiggly and not a gum drop consistancy at all which I thought they would be. Very pretty though.
