I really liked this and did not have any problems following the recipe and getting it to work. I did top with fresh whipped cream and a few raspberries. It is a light, simple way to end a robust meal. I made it the day before and it was even better the following day.

I loved this. I was trying to use up some of the limes from the tree in my yard. It was my first attempt at making a curd or custard of any kind and it did take much longer than 5 minutes (but less than 12) to rich a really thick stage. I used a little more cream than recommended to balance out the tartness and it was amazing. It made 4 huge servings and would probably be better split into smaller servings. I will definitely be making this again - every time my tree makes enough limes probably. Before that happens though I need to find my electric hand mixer. Beating that cream by hand was tiring.

I also only got 4 servings (and they were small) out of this. We loved the tartness, but had a problem with texture..had a little "graininess" to it, not sure why? Any advice? I've made curd from several types of fruit before, so I thought I knew what I was doing and never had that problem before, esp after forcing thru sieve! However, good enough to do again, as it is quick and simple after juicing the limes.

Have made this recipe twice. It took more like 10 min., rather than 5, to get the mixture to thicken. And never did the mixture "hold marks of the whisk." I don't even understand what that is supposed to mean. Ribbons, perhaps? It never got to that point before the mixture seemed to start to curdle. The day of preparation the mousse was very creamy. It was more mousse-like in consistency the second day. It was also less tart. I found that topping the mousse off with sweetened whipped cream did the trick to relieve some of the tartness. I also think that 5 min. in the ice bath might not be enough. This recipe makes 4 huge servings, as far as I'm concerned. The second time I put it in portion-controlled cups (about 3 oz.) and got 10 of them. No need to squeeze lime. There is excellent key lime juice (not made from concentrate) out there. 20 min. active time is an underestimate. Took me about 45 min. with the juice in a bottle. (I'm slow and methodical.) Figure at least a half hour. I wonder if this recipe can be frozen.

Yes, juicing the limes is probably the only offputting part of the process. I cut the limes in half removing the bigger seeds, used a reamer and juiced into a sieve, removed the seeds and pressed the solids. I also replaced the sugar with "Splenda". Rave reviews from everyone. Perfect for those that really loved a strong citrus flavour.

Creamy and tart and a little bitter: very good. Really does make only four servings, so make double if you're serving more people. Also, be prepared to spend a lot more time than you anticipated juicing those tiny darned limes--I tried a press and a reamer before realizing my electric, rotating citrus juicer was the only way I was going to get enough juice out of that bag of limes.
