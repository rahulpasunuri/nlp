I have made this three different times, and every time it has come out beautifully. It's not even the holdidays yet, but the fresh cranberries just came into the store, and I can't wait...I'm making it tomorrow! My husband even likes it, and he does not generally like anything cranberry. I use a Pyrex bread pan as a mold, unmold it on a platter, and then decorate with fresh rosemary sprigs around the bottom.

I haven't actually made this yet. I intend to though. I'm curious is anyone has used a sieve instead of the colander for straining. I think it would be much easier that way

My family loved it! I piled the cooked cranberries around the mold--very pretty and delicious.

This was popular at our table. I am not a cranberry sauce fan but it was quite good. I made it to replace that nasty canned jellied sauce, but it really doesn't resemble that sauce in any way. The "gel" is much more gentle, but not like jello. Sort of a grown up version of jellied cranberry sauce. And don't use an oaky wine (like chardonnay), this needs something crisp.

This was delicious and beautiful to boot. Do taste the juice for level of sweetness - I had to add about 1/4 cup more sugar. I used a dome-shaped bowl for a mold, and garnished it with fresh rosemary sprigs and pomegranate seeds. I made it for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it. Also, do not discard the solids! I ran them through the food mill, first on medium and then on fine. I'm going to make a cranberry mousse by mixing in some dried cherries and pecans, and folding in whipped cream.

This is a great jelly but cannot stand on its own. It needs to be on meat or something. We tried it on lamb and it was amazing! (The garlic rosemary lamb) I also did this with a sweeter wine and ginger instead of the rosemary and it was great too. The "solids" remaining are a great whole cranberry sauce and should definately NOT be thrown away.
