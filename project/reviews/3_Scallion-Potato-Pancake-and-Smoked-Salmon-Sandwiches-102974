This is much like the rosti at the eatery, Marche. Instead of scallions, I used finely chopped white onion. I think the capers and red onions are optional. The sour cream is just fine. I recommend cooking the potatoes first, whether boiled or a quick method is putting the potatoes in a bowl with an inch of water and cover w/ a lid. Then microwave for about 7 minutes.

These were delicious -- a perfect Sunday night supper. They can be greasy, so pat them down or use less oil for cooking. They are particularly good with smoked pastrami salmon.

The potato pancake over powered the smoked salmon. I served it at a dinner party for 12, announced that is was my "test" recipe of the night and only one person out of 12 would like it again.
