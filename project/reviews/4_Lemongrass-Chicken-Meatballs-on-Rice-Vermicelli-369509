Delicious, light and healthy. My hungry partner and I finished all the meatballs just the two of us and had plenty of sauce and noodles leftover to hopefully make another batch of meatballs. The only subs I made was to use soy sauce with a little lime, instead of fish sauce since he's allergic and coconut oil for the scallion oil since I didn't have vegetable oil. And we sprinkled crushed peanuts over the top.

Yummy. I made only the meatballs and dipping sauce.I used my meatball maker/cooker and got six meatballs out of the recipe. I think for lunch tomorrow I'll eat over some brown rice and using a lot of the sauce -should be excellent!

Wonderful. Highly recommended. Followed the recipe except served with rice instead of vermicelli. Would try with the vermicelli as well but was delicious with steamed jasmine rice.

Made the dipping sauce, scallion oil, and meatballs, served with rice instead of vermicelli. Delicious! I use Red Boat fish sauce and I recommend using that if you have access since the dipping sauce has a lot of fish sauce. For us, we had 1/2 the dipping sauce left from the first recipe. Made the meatballs again and served with the leftover dipping sauce. Still delicious. I thought the meatballs might stick on the grill. No problems! Just wait until they are browned on the bottom before flipping. I will trying the grilling method for other meatballs since that worked great and added a wonderful flavor. This really isn't a difficult dish at all. One change was that I made the meatballs smaller and got about 20 per batch.
