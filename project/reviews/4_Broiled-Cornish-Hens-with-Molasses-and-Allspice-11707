The chicken was good but we like to have sauce with our meats. So I took heated 3 tbls butter added 1 finely minced shallot for a few minutes. Then mixed in a cup of homemade chicken stock, 1/2 tsp corn stark and about 1 teaspoon of the molasses stuff. It was wonderful.

Flavor was ok, but very mild- chicken needed another 2-4 minutes of cook time to be done- unless the hens are very very small. Sounded more interesting than it actually was

This is a warm/cozy way to eat hens. Just watch the cooking time; I believe it requires a lot more.

I am always looking for new spice combinations and glazes for poultry. This one is great.
