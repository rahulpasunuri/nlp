Simple, delicious, fast, not high-end meat. We threw in some garlic along with the green ingredients. Key is to get it out of the oven while it's medium rare. We had 2.5 lbs and 30 minutes after reducing to 325 was all we needed. Served with toasted rye brushed with caraway seed butter and sliced avocado topped with lightly sauteed tomato slices and crumbled bleu cheese. Only letdown was tomato - if you've been reading about the industry, you know how bad they make 'em. Next time, heirloom, local, organic. Recommend Leffe Brune ale to accompany. Chose it because after carefully considering all options, there weren't any because it was the only bottle in the fridge. Worked fine.

This is my go-to recipe for a bottom round rump roast. You have to make sure you cut the meat across the grain or it won't be very tender.. I like my meat a little more done than what the recipe calls for so I usually leave it in the oven on 325 for 1-1/4 hours, making it a medium roast rather than rare. I don't use the scallions, etc. Instead, I add about 1 C. beef broth to the pan after removing the roast, thicken it with some flour and water, add salt and pepper if necessary, and cook until it's a nice consistency for gravy.

Maybe my cut was too big (and I did cook at a higher temperature than recommended just to have food on the table on time), but I prefer the texture of a braise. It wasn't really tender enough for me. HOWEVER, the sauce is imply fantastic and elevates a so-so roast to the heavens. I did follow others' suggestions and added a garlic clove and a squeeze of lemon. Fantastic! I will try again with a smaller roast and cook at a lower temp...

The cooking method is easy and yields excellent results. I used a cast iron dutch oven and got plenty of carmelization as if I'd taken the lengthy step to brown the meet on the range prior to putting in the oven. The sauce is a good base but a little bit bland. It will need to be customized as it lacks a little something. I added 1 minced clove of garlic and 1 squeeze of fresh lemon juice and that seemed to balance the flavors well.

I served this last night with five other Gourmet recipes: 3-cheese pizzetta for an appetizer; crusty puffed potatoes, mushrooms Diane, and endive and walnut salad (with baby romaine instead); and finally the pecan spice cake from the same issue (4/07). Not too simple, not too complicated - and my stepkids said it was one of my best menus ever. :-)

I wouldn't say this cut of beef lends itself so well to a simple roast -- I think I should have done a long braise. The sauce was ok, but could have reduced oil by half.

When I read the recipe I couldn't imagine that sauce would taste so fresh and unique. The blend of fresh herbs was perfect! It made an old standard stand out! Our guests raved and had seconds. I used an eye-round roast.

This sauce is positively delicious, both on meat and on boiled potatoes. I don't think the parsley is even required, as the olive oil, capers and scallions are what makes it so tasty.

Great beefy flavor and a sauce with a punch, exactly as described. YUM. A keeper.

Easy and great for a dinner party; added smashed garlic clove to sauce and removed before serving.

this was ok, not a ton of flavor and not very moist and delicious as rump roasts can be. i prefer a marinade and garlic stuck in the fat.

I liked the simple prep for roasting the meat it turned out flavorful and moist. The sauce didn't really do it for me, so I skipped it and just left the roast in its juices. Next time I would make the wasabi-garlic sauce recipe here on epicurious and serve the roast with that.

I always wondered how the cook a rump roast, short of a pot roast, and this recipe is a winner. My family loved the sauce, which was a refreshing change from standard gravy or au jus.
