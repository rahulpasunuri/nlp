Betel leaves can be found at most Indian grocery stores. The leaves are chewed all over Asia. In India the leaves are the outer wrapper for paan, a snack that can be addictive, depending on what its made of.

The lady in the asian grocer acted like I was crazy to be asking for betel leaves. She claimed they are chewed by the Thai people like tobacco, with the same affect. I don't know if she knows what she is talking about, but I ended up buying spinach because it was the closest I could come at that store. The squid and sauce were very nice. Tender squid with a rich complex coconut curry sauce.
