I had a more simple and informal version of this in Florence and wanted to try it for myself. I used a vegetable peeler to slice the zucchini thin and toss it all together, serving it in a mound. I have made it with the mint and without. If I have really fresh, local zucchini and good olive oil, I prefer it without the mint or pine nuts.

This is one of my favorite summer side dishes. It's super easy to make and fresh and light, not to mention delicious! I've made it several times and sometimes substitute basil for mint or feta for parmesean when I don't have one of the ingredients. It's a winner every time!

I made this using zucchinis and spearmint from my garden. Very nice.

This is a great summer recipe. It's super light and fresh. After making it for myself I'm making it to bring to my friends. My mint plant looked particularly unfortunate when I made this so I left out the mint and it was great without it. I used a vegetable peeler to slice and it worked just fine--I had ethereally light paper thin slices of zucchini.

Simple and a huge hit around our house...I have made this at least 10 times since our zucchini crop started coming in; I've used basil instead of mint and made other minor tweaks depending on what I have on hand, and it's always great. Even the kids love it...also a great potluck item.

I have made this at least a half-dozen times over the last two years. It is always a hit. I've presented it on a platter and also tossed in a bowl. I think it definitely improves by allowing it to sit for a while. I use more lemon and lemon zest than recipe specifies. I have not toasted the pinenuts. I liked the suggestion of using hazelnuts.

I didn't think this was as great a dish as most thought. It is unique, easy and somewhat tasty though. I used my own idea as presentation by using individual salad plates to serve this, one for each person.

I was trying to figure out what to do with all the zucchini from my CSA and stumbled across this recipe. I LOVED it - it is so easy to prepare and very refreshing on a hot day. I'll definitely make this again.

Beautiful, fresh, and easy (if you have a mandoline). I loved the combination of flavors, especially when it is allowed to sit for a bit. I used a lemon olive oil to give additional lemon flavor and used roasted hazelnuts instead of pine nuts since that is what I had. I will be making this again!

we made a non dairy version and added farmer's market squash and sesame seeds. could use more dressing.

This was so refreshing. I'm not much of a cook, but this was simple to make and I had all of the ingredients handy. Ok, I left off the pinenuts... and I had to use a little lime juice too. And my neighbor dislikes mint so I made half of it with rosemary. But it came out awesome nonetheless.

This recipe has 3 good things about it -it's easy to make, different, and delicious. I have made it twice - my husband loved it.A good side when you are grilling.I didn't have any pine nuts, it worked well without them.

I loved this recipe. I will definitely be making it again while zucchini is in season. It was such a light and delicious first course. I switched out the pine nuts for capers. It was beautiful with the slivered zucchini flowers on top.

This is a wonderful combination of flavors. I toasted the pinenuts and arranged all the slices on one large plate and let it marinate for about 45 minutes and the flavors melded perfectly. Used a very young pecorino toscana.

I found this recipe 'zippy' and fresh. I played fast and loose with the amount lemon, and since we had no fancy cheese in the house and company was due in minutes, I used freshly grated Asiago instead. I like the idea of using Basil but ours was dead after the dry summer...I will try it next time.

After reading all of the solid reviews, I decided to give this one a try. Maybe I'm missing something, but this dish was bland and boring. I'll move on, but this was a real miss!nothing for

Just simple and Wonderful!!. I changed mint for basil and was a hit. I used a high quality extra virgin olive oil made form hojiblanca olives wich results in a sweeter and softer aftertaste. I also toasted the pine nuts slightly wich imparted a nice nutty flavor. Don't forget a touch of freshly ground black pepper. definitly a keep !!!

i was a bit skeptical of the mint/zucchini pairing, but it was very pleasant and refreshing.

This was a beautiful salad! Next time I make it, I'll increase the olive oil a bit and perhaps toast the pine nuts. I didn't use near as much fresh mint as this called for, but did use some. Very summery. Makes a lot!

Absolutely delicious--light and complex and crunchy. This is definitely going to become a staple salad for me. In fact, this was so good that late at night I choose it instead of the leftover Strawberries Romanoff to snack on. Yep. It's that good.

Simple and wonderful! The mint adds such a gorgeous freshness, really makes it all pop with something different. For readers finding this recipe fussy, you could easily toss all ingredients together and serve as a really elegant, simple salad.

a little hesitant at first but this dish is super easy, the flavors blend very well and it's a nice light course in between heavier italian appetizers and entrees. good cheese is crucial. will definitely make this again.

This was outstanding! The combination of mint and lemon made the dish so "summer" tasting. I wanted to make the dish a little more filling, so I doubled the pine nuts and cheese.

Very simple to make (good slicer is important), great presentation and tastes wonderful.

This is a very impressive and simple first course. Zucchini is not my favorite veggie but definitly gets top marks in this recipe. I look forward to making it for wine dinner parties or just to impress my husband again!

This is an excellent first course for a great summer meal. However, I toasted my pine nuts and found it added another layer of flavor, which this dish can handle. I agree that it revs up the salad repertoire. This will become a regular summer salad here in Fire Island.

If you are tired of traditional salad before a nice meal, make this. It got rave reviews when served for at Easter this year. Very beautiful, fresh salad, and I did find a hand slicer that sliced very very thin at a local Asian Market. Great Recipe!!
