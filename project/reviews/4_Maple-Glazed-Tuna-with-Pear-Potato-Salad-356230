This recipe is a bit of a mess, although the idea behind it is good. The tuna you use should be SUSHI GRADE, not just thawed frozen tuna from Trader Joe's. Secondly, the accompanying potato salad recipe is off in a number of ways -- the pieces need to be smaller than the recipe says, and the pears need to go in earlier than the recipe says. I'd also chop the onions if I were to make it again.

This was absolutely delicious. I made both the tuna and the pear-potato salad and plan to make both of them again. YUM!

Re my prior post: I did not make the salad so the 5 minutes was only for the tuna portion.

This recipe is simple, delicious, and took about 5 minutes total to prepare! I cut back the olive oil considerably, sliced the tuna thinly, and served it over giant cress (not sure of the exact type, but you certainly could use watercress, too). Really delicious.

To the cook asking about parasites, no. Sushi fish intended to be eaten raw (tuna most notable among them) are only frozen when necessary for transportation. If you get it near the pier, it will go from net to plate in only a few minutes. Fish species that are more susceptible to parasites will be served cooked. Not all sushi/sashimi is served raw.

Delicious! I cut the potato in smaller chunks as others suggested. I used shallots rather than red onion and I didn't have pear, so I used a Macintosh apple. It was excellent, despite all the modifications. The tuna was good, though the flavors were not strong.

This is an excellent recipe. I did use suggestions from other reviewers: used about 1/4 the juice of a lime, and reduced the curry in the Pear-Potato Salad. It was easy, elegant and delicious. I know I will make it again. A good dish for company.

Just a comment, is anyone besides me afraid of getting worms or paristites from eating raw fish from the supermarket? I hear fish for 'sushi' has been 'deep frozen' in a 'special extra cold freezer' to KILL anything, but I don't think the same precautions are taken for supermarket tuna & the center of this fish will be virtually 'raw'.

Didn't make the Pear-Potato salad only the tuna, which I really enjoyed. Nice flavor, quick & easy. We grilled the tuna for total of 3 mins to avoid 'sushi' rarity. Because we grilled the tuna we didn't get a good glaze -- but nevertheless the flavor was there. Nice meal for family or company. Will definitely make again

This recipe combo is amazing. I recommend doubling the Tuna Sauce and pouring over the potato

I love raw tuna and I love a seared crust but the combination of a hot and cold element is not to my liking. One thing you might try is putting your seared tuna in the freezer for a few minutes right out of the pan so that everything is the same temp. Tip of the hat for this technique to the most generous tuna fisherman I know, Garth.

I wasn't sure about this recipe until our daughter recommended it. Pears and potatoes? But, in a curry, the two married perfectly. I think I would add a bit more spinach to the finished salad, but otherwise I made it to recipe.

soooo easy and delish! i cooked this longer than the 30 seconds suggested -- probably about 45s to 1 min per side. it's still pretty rare, though, which i like, but you have to be prepared for it. the sauce is incredible and definitely used extra for dipping! made it with the pear potato salad, and both were excellent.

absolutely scrumptious! Fresh and deliciouos tasting and the potatoes compliment very well! Thanks for this... tummy says 'yes'!

The dipping sauce was amazing! I am new to cooking tuna, so I had a hard time stomaching it practically raw. 30 seconds on each side....really? I like sushi, but I wasn't expecting it to be so cool in the middle. If I wasn't afraid that I might be poisoning myself, I would have given this 4 forks. The potato salad side dish was perfect.

Made this last night and it DIVINE. So easy, the sauce is sop-it-up good. Ditto the previous review that said serve with a bowl of sauce on the side to dip the tuna. Absolutely perfect as-is. I'm enjoying the leftovers for lunch right now.

I made this last night and it was fabulous. I loved the way the maple glaze sauce went with the tuna. I even put the remaining sauce in condiment bowls so you could dip each bite of tuna in it if you wanted extra - and we did! I served this with the pear potato salad and it was delicious. This potato salad will become a new staple side dish. Will definitely make this again. I made the Edamame Dip with Pita Chips as an appetizer and it was simple & delicious - http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/foo d/views/Edamame-Dip-with-Pita-Chips- 357370 Overall, it was an easy, delicious and healthy meal from start to finish.

I'd used whole grain mustard because I didn't have Dijon. It doesn't allow the glaze to be whipped, so I don't suggest this. Also, I had a bit of a problem searing the tuna in a stainless steel pan. Perhaps those who don't own non-stick pans (due to the chemicals in Teflon, etc) should grill or do a quick broil instead. The taste was a great combination of sour and sweet. I'd definitely make this again.

Delicious and easy. Potato pear salad worked really well with the fish, the cuury was subtle but nice addition. I used fingerling potatoes, and arugula instead of spinach.

This was pretty awesome, of course the local grocery store had no tuna steaks on hand so I used salmon instead and it was really good. I also made it with the reccommended salad which was also awesome. Definately going in my collection of recpies to make again!

This is a great recipe. Easy, and delicious. I made it almost exactly to the recipe (I had German instead of Dijon mustard on hand, and had shallots instead of the red onion for the salad). 5 star quality for very little time and effort. One note, I'm at high altitude and next time will sear the tuna for longer than 30 seconds, it wasn't quite cooked enough, but it was still fine. With tuna, underdone is better than overdone.

Made this for a quick dinner for my husband and it was excellent. Added more cilantro than called for and served (for a super quick meal) with sliced avocado. Brilliant!
