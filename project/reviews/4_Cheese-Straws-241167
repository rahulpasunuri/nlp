I thought this was blah as written. Not bad by any means, but not fantastic either. I give the recipe 3 stars as-is. I made a second batch with a lot of cumin, paprika, allepo pepper flakes, sea salt, ground black pepper and pecans and they turned out really good. There was no way I was going to be able to roll out the dough straight from the processor. I needed to chill the dough for a while before it was firm enough to work with. My second batch was 4 stars. This is an easy, adaptable recipe.

This couldn't be easier or more tasty. I made several batches; one with a smoky cheddar and another with Swiss Emantaler. I only cooked them for about 13 min...any longer would've dried them out completely.

Very dry, used Gruyere. Since they were difficult to twist and make 'straws', I rolled the strips into curly's and they were better than the strips. They cook quickly, watch closely, do not overbake and dry them out. Will keep looking for other recipes.

These were super easy to make and delicious. I used 2 cups of cheese and more red pepper than the recipe called for and loved it. Great treat for the holidays!

I have made these for years without the benefit of a food processor. Just work the dough with your hands until all the cheese and butter melts together. I usually add some chopped pecans and the smoked paprika that others have suggested, but I roll the dough into a log, wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate it until it begins to firm up. I then slice it into medallions so that they are more like little cookies and they aren't so fragile. I'm going to follow instructions from some others and try different cheeses...these make a lovely holiday gift and are always very much appreciated.

Wowsers! I agree with everyone. It is a good thing I did go ahead and make the double-batch because I have eaten most of the first! I cut the dough with small and large star-shaped cookie cutters and they are aaahhhhh-dorable. They will be perfect for the party. This will easily be going in my repertoire!

Easy and delicious. I've made this recipe dozens of times. Yesterday I made two batches, one following the recipe exactly and the other with half the cayenne plus 1 tsp ground cumin and 1 tsp toasted cumin seeds. Both were fantastic.

These were very good, but not as cheesy as I expected. I used a nice sharp cheddar. I'll try again with another cheese, or maybe two different cheeses. My little food processor wasn't big enough to finish the job, so I formed the ball with my hands and went from there.

I don't have a food processor either, but found that I could use my hands to incorporate the butter into the flour and grated cheese. These were a hit at a bridal shower!

I'm not sure exactly what to say about this recipe. I did not care for them, but I made a double batch and they were all gone at the end of the party and I had several people request the recipe. As we discussed the dish, it was eventually agreed upon that they taste like Cheez- itz. And I don't like Cheez-itz, so I suppose that explains why I didn't care for them.

Easy and delicious. I used extra sharp white cheddar so I sprinkled the tops with smoked paprika and sea salt, both for a little color and taste.

Cheese is like bacon: more is more! There's nothing else I would edit about this recipe!

Rating: 4
Loved the taste of these (I did throw some thyme into the dough since I had a lot and I knew it would taste good). They were so easy to make! Well, at least the dough was. I spent a lot of time making these look pretty by braiding two pieces together. But they ended up perfect and delicious. Flaky and cheesy and even a bit impressive.

Living in Switzerland, I make these with half ripe Gruyere and half Sbrinz, grated. Huge recipe! Half is usually fine. These are DELICIOUS. Perfectly OK made a day or two before. Always a hit.

Rating: 4
Absolutely addictive. Cheesy, spicy, crispy and a snap to make! I substituted 1 tsp of Tony Chachere's Original Creole Seasoning and a good grind of black pepper to add more heat. As others suggested, I cut into 1/2" strips and gave each a twist to add a little more eye appeal.

Rating: 4
Really fun and addictive! Make more than you think you will need as these go quick! I have made this many times based on this recipe, with variations in the cheese and spices. A strong cheese like parmesan cheese or asiago works well. With chedder I prefer more cheese in this recipe, and you will want a strong, sharp chedder. You can play around with spices to get just the right flavor.

Rating: 4
Oh my, I can't stop eating them! Big mistake, making them 4 days before a party. I'll have to make another batch. Instead of making strips, I used a small cookie cutter to make biscuits. They're light, flaky and wonderful. I added dry mustard and a bit more cayenne, as one reviewer suggested, and I think I'll add even more next time.

Rating: 4
These were super easy and great, I don't have a food processor so I just grated the cheese and mixed it by hand. They were the best crackers I've ever had and I will never be buying them again!

Rating: 4
Easy and excellent recipe. The butter gives them a delicate, nice texture and the taste reminds me of cheddar Goldfish crackers - and I mean that in a good way! Adults like the tangy cheese flavor and kids love them too. A real keeper. I made a triple batch and froze half for later. Freezes well.

Rating: 3
Easy. Tasty. Added a little smoked paprika. Served them with Farmstand Gazpacho. I still like my family cheese snack recipe better, but this one is much faster.

Rating: 4
Easy, addictive, the perfect nibble. Just watch them like a hawk because the bottoms brown quickly, even when switching the baking sheets. For me, they work best being a bit shorter and fatter than the recipe calls for. I also twisted them as others suggest, and they look more "gourmet."

Rating: 4
Good and easy. I added 1/2 cup of roasted pecans to the food processor before adding the milk. MV

These are wonderful little goodies. I tested them for a local Wine & Cheese Festival using the white cheddar, aged gouda, and chevre cheeses. They were all wonderful! And the tip for using the fettuccine cutter on the pasta machine - wow! Whipped them out in no time.

Rating: 0
I've done these a few times now, and would like to add some ideas. First, I work the dough, after refrigerator it for a half hour, using a puff pastry style, I.E. Roll it, fold it in thirds, reroll it, fold it in thirds again, and repeat about 10 times. It adds a nice flakiness to the recipe. For consistency, I finish it in my pasta roller, and cut it with the fettuccine cutters. That seems to give it a nice consistent shape and size.

Rating: 4
I took almost every bit of advice about this recipe from other reviewers except that I made the sticks thicker than shown in the photo. They were a hit, even with 1/4 t. of cayenne. I twisted them and although they didn't really stay twisted, they had some interest to them. I also followed another person's advice and did not leftovers into a plastic container to store them, but rather kept them out in a basket. They remained crisp and tasty. I would definately make these again!

Rating: 4
I made these to use some old cheddar I had going bad. I rolled them with my pasta machine cutting them into thick fettucine strips. I baked and froze them and have served them several times since by popping them into the oven for 10 minutes to thaw and recrisp. These are awesome to have on hand.

Rating: 4
Don't make the mistake I did...I prepared everything just as the recipe said, but after I got the dough ready I stopped to give my daughter a bath and stored the dough in the fridge -- big mistake! When my disks (I rolled the dough in a log for easy slicing) came out of the oven they weren't a pretty even orange color...they were speckled! My guess is that by putting the dough in the fridge the butter and cheese got hard again and therefore didn't have a chance to properly melt during their short duration in the oven. They were still yummy and I look forward to making them again.

Rating: 4
These were really good, in fact somewhat addictive. Increased the cayenne as suggested. Very quick and easy to make, dough is easy to work with if not rolled too thin. Will definitely make again.

I made these and they are great! So easy! The dough was wonderful to work with.

These went over great--I made two kinds, one with sharp cheddar as advised, one with cheddar infused with caramelized onions. The one with the onions made for much more delicious cheese straws.

Very yummy. Smelled like pizza when it was cooking. Simple recipe. I didn't change a thing except taking the other reviewer's suggestion of twisting two strips for better presentation. I may add more cayenne next time and use better/sharper cheese.

Rating: 3
Good,w.extra cayenne as others have noted. WARNING: don't store these in a sealed container. I made these a day ahead, waited for them to cool (snuck a few, so I know they were deliciously crisp), then put them in a Tupperware container lined with paper towels. When I took them out to serve, the straws were not nearly as crisp--a big disappointment.

Rating: 4
These are delicious. A definite hit for nibbles before a dinner party. I made them a little more presentable by twisting the straws before baking and they came out looking great. The dough is fragile, but if you're careful, it's doable and definitely worth the effort.

Rating: 4
So good that I can't make just one batch - they go so fast! Easy to make variations - I usually add more cayenne and a touch of dry mustard.

Great. I increased the cayenne a bit, and I love the spice it added. The dough was really easy to work with as well.

I made these for a party I was having. My parents stopped by to say hi and ate so many of them that afternoon that I sent the rest home with them and had to make another batch for the party. Needless to say they were delicious. Not only did my parents love them, but most people at the party commented on how good they were as well.

Rating: 4
I grew up with these--same recipe, but made using a cookie press (old-fashioned metal screw top kind)--using the star attachment to make 2-3 inch long straws--that texture really complemented the flavor. Also these are 100 times better on day two (if they last that long.)

These are so yummy and easy to make. I didn't have cayenne so I used black pepper instead and they were delicious.

Great recipe. I made them to set out as appetizers for a brunch and everyone loved them! Great to snack on, very cheesy.

I doubled this recipe and after making about 40 sticks considered tossing the rest of the dough--I was planning a party and had so many other things to work on, so I thought 40 would be plenty. My mom convinced me to make the rest and I am glad I did! People loved, loved, loved these! They are a little time consuming but I made mine 2 days before the party and stored as suggested. A partygoer called them "cheese-its on crack." --I think that is a good thing!

This was a great and easy recipe to make. I was asked by a couple of people for it, and will definitely make again.

These were delicious, and easy to prepare. However, made as long thin straws they are rather fragile. I dont know why they wouldnt work as well as more manageable wafers, about 1-inch-by-2½- inch.

I have used a mix of Parmesan and Gruyére since I cannot find Cheddar in Italy. I had to add a little more of milk. Everybody liked them. I served the straws with Parma ham.

Rating: 4
One more note to those who are having a hard time with the amount of milk given in the recipe: I first thought it was not enough, also. I learned I had to keep pulsing the food processor longer than I expected. Be patient and it forms a ball with roughly the consistency of butter cookie batter. Perfect.

Rating: 4
These were loved by everyone--friends, family & coworkers. I weighed the cheese, used my Cuisinart, and didn't have to change the amount of milk. I highly recommend using an extra sharp white Vermont or Canadian aged cheddar, not some run-of-the- mill orange stuff that happens to be labeled "sharp." Do not be put off by people saying "these are like Cheese-Its only waaay better." They mean it as compliment. These are FANTASTIC.

Rating: 4
I didn't want to bother with the food processor and it was easy enough to make by hand. I omitted the salt and substituted an unmeasured amount (maybe 1/4 to 1/2 tsp?) of mustard powder for the cayenne. The flavor was great. I measured the cheese by weight and still had to add quite a bit more milk for a workable consistency of the dough.

Rating: 4
This is really good. Followed advice of weighing the cheese instead of using measuring cups, and dough came out perfect with no change in the amount of milk. Great snack.

Rating: 3
I thought these were actually kind of dull in flavor. They did have heat but the flavor was just not there. Maybe if I used a stronger cheese (I did use sharp cheddar), or added herbs or something. I found the dough came together really well and they were easy to make, but I wish there was a more flavorful variation.

Rating: 4
I made these for a party tonight, and the flavor is excellent. The cayenne pepper adds just enough kick and flavor. Just a note of caution...watch them really carefully because once they start turning more than a golden brown, they have a very burnt flavor. Next time I make them, I think I might experiment with the cheeses and try different combos.

These cheese straws are simply amazing. They are light, delicious & fool proof to make. Because the strips are fragile I put half of the rectangle directly onto the baking sheet & cut the strips right on the sheet.

Rating: 4
Really good and super easy to make! I would double the recipe if you have more than 4 snacking on them...they are addicting!

Rating: 4
Best descriptive - addictive! I made them as is. I weighed the cheese instead of using a measuring cup and found that if you use the measuring cups alone you really need to lightly place the cheese in the cups - do not pack at all. Maybe that's why some needed more milk to form the dough bc mine formed a perfect ball when pulsing.

Rating: 3
These are really tasty! I only have them 3 forks because they are not the most beautiful things, but they are very good and easy to make. Save yourself some grief and just cut them into 5 inch long strips to transfer onto the baking sheet with a pastry blade or spatula.

Rating: 4
These were yummy! I made rounds instead of straws and didn't roll as dough as thin. They came out almost like a flaky cheesy biscuit. It definitely needed more milk than what the recipe called for. I will make again!

These were amazing. I was actually too lazy to make the "straws" and so instead, cut rounds out and made cheese rounds. It definitely needed more milk than what the recipe calls for.

These things are awesome! My mom made them for New Year's Eve and we snarfed them down before she could pop the top on the champange! They totally were the best ever snacks. Kinda like Cheese Its but in straw form. My mom said next time she would add sesame seeds for some oomph. FYI: One thing she said was that she needed to use more milk than it called for to make the dough soft.
