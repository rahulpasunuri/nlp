I did not think that this dish was bland at all for a vegetable side dish. It's not like it's a curry. I did substitue shallot for the red onion and that went well. I've saved this recipe and will definitely make it again.

Based upon the reviews I took complete license with the recipe. Really good..... if you roast the cauliflower instead of boiling it.

This is a good start, but you really need the serrano ham. You can get it from any Italian deli. You also need fresh garlic and cayenne pepper to add a bit more oomph to the cauliflower. Also, don't substitute regular tomatoes for the grape tomatoes, they're much sweeter than cherry tomatoes, though strawberry tomatoes are OK too. You also need to think of this as part of a tapas buffet; spicier and punchier dishes are balanced with this one.

The rating I am giving this is with the following substitutions and additions: shallot for onion, prosciutto for serrano, use some cayenne for the pepper and add 1 tsp fine herbs crumbled. Also sprinkle servings with fresh grated Parmesan cheese. I agree the recipe "as is" is pretty bland.

Not being a fan of cauliflower, I was surprised that I liked this. I could not find the serrano ham and had to substitute prosciutto, but it tasted just fine.

I have no idea how someone could think this is bland - this is one of the best cauliflower dishes I've had in months, delicious, with balanced flavors, great summer food as a tapa or main course salad. Definitive a keeper.

No butcher knew what I was talking about when I asked for serrano ham, so I substituted prosciutto. Very tasty and flavourful, but it seemed a little liquidy. I might try squeezing the juice out of the tomatoes a bit next time...

Cauliflower takes on whatever flavors you add to it. This was simply there--nothing to write home about.

A very flavorful and tasty recipe. Super easy to make. Serrano ham is a must, it makes the dish. I wouldn't substitute if you don't have to, but if you must prosciutto might work.
