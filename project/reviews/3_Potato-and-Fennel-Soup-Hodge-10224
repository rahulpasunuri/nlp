I made it today and I added a couple of carrots. I then mashed the cooked veggies in a food processor then added them to the broth. The result was ever so smooth and creamy. I sprinkled the chopped fennel green ends at the end and it was superb. An excellent starter for a winter meal.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out a bit bland. The potato flavor was stronger than the fennel. Next time I would add a teaspoon of crushed fennel seed to make it tastier

This was a good soup. I lighted it up a little by sauteing the fennel and onion in a little pit of chicken broth and used Fat Free Milk. Not quite as rich but very tasty and a lot less calories

Wonderful! Besides being quick, easy and healthy, the fennel taste is subtle and delicious. And it made the whole house smell delightful.

This soup is great served cold. Make at least 24 hours in advance, cover and refrigerate. I added a little chopped parsley to the top of each serving.
