UPDATE: after watching a few videos on YouTube about how to make Barfi I realize that what this recipe is missing is LIQUID. All the other ones I saw added about a cup of either milk, cream, or water. I was making mine dairy-free so I added about a cup of water, put my separated mess back into the cuisinart, and whipped it up to the correct consistency. This is a really helpful video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZEvYcDiC8

TERRIBLE. I followed this recipe word for word and when the cashew paste got into pan with the sugar and started heating up, all the fat separated out and it left a clump of nut-butter and sugar sitting in a pool of oil. No amount of arduous stirring (over well over 20 min) helped to homogenize this mess. Ugh.

This recipe is fabulous! I made the fudge as the recipe suggested (instead of boiling water, I just soaked the cashews for two hours in room temperature water with a dash of rose water). However, this recipe is wonderful, if for no other reason than being a base recipe from which it is easy to make adjustments according to what you want to make -- i.e. want to put chocolate in it? Add cocoa powder during the heating process or blending process. Want to make peanut butter fudge instead? Use peanuts. This recipe is absolutely wonderful!
