i made these and found that a pre-bought dough was much better. I also found that the stained-glass effect left something to be desired. It got all over the dough and turned out badly. It also tasted strange and too sweet with the candy.

I found this dough to be a bit tough to work with also - very coarse and cracked a lot when I rolled it out. I baked the cookies on parchment and had no trouble lifting them when cooled, and they looked pretty. My daughter said the green candy tasted terrible too after baking. I would make the stained glass cookie again, but would use a different dough.

I found these cookies to be no problem to make, though i did get some bubbles in the candy when it melted. It didn't stick to my parchment paper. I agree that the texture is a bit different but it was very impressive!

This was somewhat of a waste - I was able to use the dough for regular cookie cutouts, but doing the stained glass effect was disappointing. The candy melted into a greyish color and having the shortbread with hard candy was too much of a texture change. Lemon peel was a nice touch in the dough. I made lemon icing and these were still a hit.

I made this recipe for my daughter's class...I bake often and was struggling to get the fourteen cookies that I needed. The dough was terribly coarse and tough. I had no problen getting the cookies off of the cookie sheet after baking - use a different sugar cookie recipe and add hard candies to that. What a nightmare!!!

These cookies look beautiful, but it's not worth all the effort for the way they taste. The cookie dough is great, but nobody seems to enjoy a wonderful lemon cookie, then biting into a lollipop. These are a lot of work, and you're better off making something that looks AND tastes great.

As it's been mentioned before, bake these cookies on aluminium foil to make them easier to lift (and to spare your cookie sheet). The results were gorgeous on my first try. I also substituted orange zest for variety. Keep an eye on the cookies as they bake, if the melted candy froths it'll ruin the results. Although the cookies look wonderful, my guests were a bit put off by biting into hard candy halfway through a cookie. For that reason, I intend to make them again but with chocolate or perhaps jelly beans in the center.

I really liked the dough...the lemon zest addition I thought was a nice touch. I had no problems with preparation. I put Lifesavers in a mini food processor and ended up with 'Lifesaver dust", as my boyfriend called it. Filling the cutouts was easy with the "dust". I baked the cookies on foil, as one reviewer and several other recipes suggest. The different flavor Lifesavers really added different tastes to the various cookies. The only problem I had was that the "dust" completely filled the cutouts to the top, but the cooked, melted "dust" only halfway filled the cutouts...maybe if the Lifesavers had been crumbled, not processed, it would have yielded a different result. Overall the cookies made an attractive presentation and everyone who ate them enjoyed them.

I didn't have any trouble with the recipe. I found the parchment paper to be fine. I think that the trick is to fill the centers so that the crushed candy goes completely to the edges of the cutout. I used a 1/8 tsp. measuring spoon to carefully spill the crushed candy into the centers. Any spill over I could gently brush off of the cookie over to where it belonged. The cookies themselves I thought were very good. I used the mini cookie cutters with the last of the dough to cut tiny cookies and I baked those without any stained glass centers - but you have to reduce the baking time for the smaller cookies so they won't burn. Caution though - the green candy when cooked tastes foul. Next time I will just use red.

Only two forks because although the cookies are beautiful, the cookie dough isn't the best. After reading the comments below, I lined the sheet with foil and let the cookies cool completely before removing. I had no problems at all. I used crushed up Life-savers and Jolly Ranchers candies in addition to red-and-white-striped mints. The cookies looked great and tasted good as well. It takes a little time, but is worth it as an accent cookie in you holiday platter.

I don't understand why everyone had such trouble. Try cooking them on FOIL, wait for them to cool and the candies won't stick. And I just put the candies in a plastic bag and beat them senseless with a hammer. Then you can pick them up and sprinkle them in the opening. I've been making these for years, but i lost my cookbook. now I have my recipe back.

I saw the picture of these cookies and had to look at the receipe. They look very similar to Russian Chistmas cookies but thought I'd share mine here. 250g flour, 90g powdered sugar, 1 egg yolk, 160g butter, lemon rind. Roll and cut shapes (circles) half having smaller circle in center. After cookies have been baked and cooled spread jam on one cookie and place cookie with cut out in center on top. Put in air tight tin. The longer you leave them in the tin the better they get. We make these at Thanksgiving for Christmas.

This recipe didn't work out for me, either. I also found that the candy attached itself to the paper and I couldn't get it off. I also found it hard to put the candies in the 1 inch cutout without spilling any on the cookie. I wish mine had turned out as attractive as the picture!

These cookies were a nightmare! Everything was ok until they came out of the oven, the hard candies when baked stuck to the paper, the cookies broke when lifted off the sheet-very frustrating. I tried a second time (leaving the hard candies out)and the cookies were ok. Maybe I did something wrong-I would be interested to know about another experience.
