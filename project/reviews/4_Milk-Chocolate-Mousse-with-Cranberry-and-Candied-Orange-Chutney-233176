This is divine even without the chutney, which I usually bag in favor of whipped cream jacked with some Kahlua. I made this for a good friend who had just come home with her first baby, and when I dropped off a huge bowl of this mousse and the butternut-squash lasagna recipe (also here), she called me practically crying (nothing like getting fed a good meal after labor). If you like milk chocolate, this is heaven.

I made this for Christmas and my whole family raved about it! I made both the chutney and the mousse the night before and both held up quite well. I added about a tablespoon of sugar to the whipped cream on top, but that was really the only change I made.

Great flavor, but way too rich in chocolate,so I used half of what it called for.

Great mousse recipe, but this makes a lot more than 6 servings. I made 2/3 of the recipe and still had a lot leftover after dessert for four. Otherwise, best chocolate mousse recipe I've tried in a while!

I have not made this yet, but I have a question. I need a dessert that can be ready to serve in a few minutes. I do have a few hours prep time, but can't chill for four hours, like the recipe states. Can I still make this?

Easy and delicious, with great chocolate flavor and a really light, fluffy texture. But this makes a lot more than six servings ...

Very simple and delicious mousse recipe. I used the pound plus milk chocolate from Trader Joe's and it turned out great. Don't forget the chutney - it is very simple to make and adds a lot of depth to the mousse flavors

This mousse was so rich and delicious. I added more cream than the recipe called for because it was so sweet. It made it perfect. Very thick and creamy.

I'm not a huge mousse fan in general, but even I loved this. It is retains the creamy richness of eating good quality milk chocolate (and I invested in good stuff) while still being light(ish). Could very easily be made in fancy moulds as it does retain quite a bit of body. I doubled this recipe, btw, for a thanksgiving crowd, and people raved.

this was so good! I impressed everyone.

Lovely recipe! I followed directions precisely (except for using Cool Whip instead of beating cream) for both the mousse and the chutney and served it exactly as pictured. Had it for a special family gathering that included 3 ladies 80+ and a teenager -- it was a hit with all ages!

I didn't have time to make the chutney, but it was delicious on it's own with a fanned strawberry on top. I spooned the mousse into dessert cups and it set-up in about an hour. This will be one of those staple desserts that I will rely on when I want something quick, light, but decadent.
