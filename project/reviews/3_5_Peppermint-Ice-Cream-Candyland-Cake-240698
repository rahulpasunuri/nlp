This recipe was so easy! It was soooo rich, though, I could barely eat half a sliver of the cake! It turned out really well, especially that chocolate drizzle, which I think is necessary to enjoy the cake. I didn't have a candy thermometer, but the candy brittle turned out well, and it was all very easy.It just takes a lot of time and is very drippy as you put the ice cream on the very brownie-like cake. The gummies in the candy brittle melted, but they ended up being the tastiest and gooiest part. I would recommend taking a couple of days to do this just because the ice cream melts quickly, but its fairly easy and turned out delicious.

Made as per recipe. Used peppermint chocolate chip ice cream. Froze the softened ice cream in the same cookie sheet as for the cake - as per suggestions. Worked perfectly. Brittle also (surprisingly) worked perfectly. I worried that the sharp edges of the brittle might be dangerous for a bunch of six year olds, but it was fine! The only complaints were that the cake part was very frozen and hard to cut/eat. Otherwise the cake was beautiful. I can't wait to try it again with a different flavour of ice cream and colour coordinated candies.

This cake gets 4 forks for its visual appeal as well as taste. I was a bit intimidated at first by troubles other reviewers had. But this cake isn't terribly hard. The brittle took two tries as it burnt the first time, but if you have two people and work quickly it's easy and quite stunning. Use many varieties of candy and skip the gummy worms. Another key tip when putting the ice cream layers together. Do the cake and ice cream layers and then freeze the cake for a couple hours so that the layers don't move when you're doing the top and sides. Really not too difficult and gives a pretty major "WOW" factor.

You need an entire afternoon and a helper to make this cake. I used vanilla ice cream and made the cake as directed. The cake was excellent, moist and spongey, just as I remember it as a child. It does take a significant amount of time to assemble, especially when the ice cream begins to melt. This cake also feeds about 20 to 25 depending on how large the slices are. I am undecided if I would make this dessert again because it took so long. I would suggest though pounding the ice cream out in a 15x10 baking pan and then freezing it. Be sure to cake the cake evenly as well, it does make a difference when assembling. Enjoy your ice cream cake.

I have made this two times, for two different birthday parties and both were a hit. OKAY...now I am going to turn into one of THOSE reviews...I substitutted mint chocolate chip ice cream and did not frost with ice cream, I frosted with icing. To make assembly simple, I put the softened ice cream in a parchment lined big cake/deep cookie sheet (about 1 inch deep) and freezed. Made the cake in the same pan after cutting the frozen ice cream into three long bars and putting back in the freezer. Once the cake was cool, cut it into three big long inch deep pieces, put parchment between and froze. Once all was happy in the freezer, assembled on the serving plate and back in the freezer again. Once it was frozed solid, I assembled and frosted - yep, and put back in the freezer. The cake part of this recipe is very brownie like (which we loved) and pick any flavor of ice cream to go with it and you are set - but plan a day or so ahead for assembly. Love this!!

This is a showstopper. I made this Christmas 2007 and everyone loved this cake. When my two year old nephew tasted this cake, his eyes closed and he was in a daze! It is absolutely delicious and beautiful. I have never made candy brittle before and it turned out great! It is worth the work.

I made this for a Christmas party, and it was a huge hit! At the time, this was the most complicated recipe I had ever attempted, and I didn't even try to make the candy brittle. The cake part was moist and just the right consistency. I would like to try this with different kinds of ice cream.

A very good cake but the candy brittle was near impossible and I gave up after two disastrous attempts. Otherwise this won a big thumbs-up from my Christmas guests, and works well with gluten-free rice flour.

Everyone needs to be humbled and this reipe made it my time. I cook and bake a lot and no part of this receipe seem to turn out correctly. And I was so excited to make this!The brittle never reached the correct temp and I must have overcooked it, was a light caramel color. New lesson learned, do not break up the brittle and store before, mine melded together in the container. Thought the cake was a too dense but see that it was to be like a brownie. I bought the premium vamilla ice from Costco and tried to make the ice cream in my food processor. My food processor rebelled and stopped working. All you cooks out there know that is the worst feeling. It forgave me and it is working now. The ice cream became one big old pile of PINK!!!!! But I will not be defeated, will make it again, follow the tips here and definitely get a new thermometer.

I made this cake with mint chocolate chip ice cream for a friend's birthday and it got rave reviews. Thanks a million to bnacook who recommended softening the ice cream, spreading it in the same pan used for baking the cake, refreezing and slicing. It worked wonderfully!

This cake was a disaster, but I won't rate it since I think it's probably the fault of my freezer rather than the recipe. My cheapo freezer is incapable of freezing ice cream hard, so it took on the consistency of a milkshake and ran down the sides of the cake into a sad puddle on the platter. I don't think I've ever made anything that turned out less like the recipe. Do not attempt this if your landlord provides you with the lowest-quality appliances known to man!

This is a beautiful and delicious cake. I had some kids who weren't big peppermint fans so I figured I could switch up the ice cream and brittle if I really wanted. But I personally love peppermint so this was a HUGE hit. Hard for me to keep the layers even and the ice cream was a bit sloppy to work with. Will try some of the hints next time. I couldn't find peppermint ice cream so I mixed a carton of vanilla with strawberry and put the mint extract and crushed mints in for a minty taste and VERY pink cake! A DEFINITE keeper.

This cake was beautiful!I had no problem w the candy topping. The ice cream I bought (a no brand)would not freeze hard, would have been better if it had! Pauline

Wow. We loved this cake. First the cake itself was moist and chewy-- great when it was frozen. The brittle was so fun-- we used lots of Hammonds candies. Almost crminal to smash them but the colors and flavors were beautiful. We needed a BIG cake so we doubled the cake recipe and baked in a regular sized half-sheet pan. Then sliced it the long way into thirds and went from there. It was perfect. Did the same amount of brittle called for in the recipe and it was plenty. Used 4 quarts of ice cream from a local creamery. We did not have any trouble spreading or making it look like the picture, but their ice cream is very easily softened by hand. A real show stealer!

I was so excited to make this cake! I saw the recipe in the December issue and had to create it for Christmas. Everyone oohed and aahed over and and said that it looked like something straight out of a movie because it was so beautiful. I used a variety of pink (Cotton Candy, Bubble Gum, Tutti Frutti) Red (Cinnamon) and White (Marshmallow and Vanilla Bean) Jelly Belly Jelly Beans along with Snow Caps, Red Hots and big gumdrops cut in 4ths and rolled in sugar (so they don't stick together!) for the candy brittle. I used an entire gallon of Kemp's Pink Peppermint Ice Cream in the block, opened the block and used a knife to cut even rectangular ice cream layers and assembled without any smoothing. I re-froze after assembly then took it out to smooth the rough ice cream with an off-set spatula and stuck my candy brittle in. I highly recommend this cake - not only is the presentation second to none but it tastes great, too!

I did not rate the recipe since I did not make it, but I thought I might comment on spreading the ice cream more smoothly. There's an incredible baked alaska recipe from Gourmet 1986 whereby the finished product looks almost identical to this recipe....six layers of alternating ice cream and brownie. The 1986 recipe says to "line a 15 x 10 jelly roll pan with foil and freeze for 15 minutes. Puree the softened ice cream in a food processor until smooth and spread evenly in the frozen pan and freeze ice cream until hard." After the ice cream freezes back hard, cut the ice cream in strips just like you did on the brownie and stack them up. Its pretty simple and I think this procedure would help out on this recipe. I just got through making my old baked alaska recipe with peppermint ice cream instead of the original coffee and the peppermint ice cream did great in the food processor. Good luck!

this was yummy and so much fun! the cake is like a brownie and it is just delicious! the only thing i would suggest is not to use gummies in the candy brittle. a lot of them melted.

Made for Christmas Eve dinner and came out great. The cake was a little hard to get out of the pan as it crumbled a bit. Good suggestion about using a knife to cut the ice cream. The candy brittle came out ok. Kinda looked like shards of glass! Kids had fun with that one. Skipped the sauce and that was fine. Will make again and would also do for other holidays with a different flavor of ice cream.

I made this for a holiday party contest for the best dessert w/ chocolate - and I won the grand prize trophy! The brittle on top didn't look like the picture and was hard to make - but it looked good anyway!

I made this cake for no reason, it is amazing! the candy brittle is really good. Next time I will definitely have more Ice Cream on hand, Edys Peppermint Ice Cream is wicked good!

I would never make this cake again - after spending the $ on Baskin's Robin's Peppermint ice cream and the time and effort to bake the cake, I realized I would have been better off doing a special order cake through Baskin Robins instead. This cake didn't taste better than a baskin robin's ice cream cake, and I certainly couldn't get it to look better, because no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't get the ice cream icing to look as nice as this photo. Also, the chocolate sauce is 100% unnecessary - I didn't think it was the right kind of chocolate sauce for the peppermint anyways.

I made this today in advance of a neighborhood progressive dinner tomorrow. The cake was simple to make and is OK. The trick I stumbled on regarding the spreading of the ice cream is to use ice cream thats packaged in a rectangular carton. I peeled the carton off the ice cream and used both an ice cold stainless steel knife to cut the ice cream and place it on the rectangular cake and a large stainless steel pie server to smooth it out; a cold kitchen didnt hurt either. The brittle recipe worked fine, but it took a long time for mine to get to 300 degrees, and I only had about 2/3 of the amount that was estimated. Be absolutely sure to have the candy pieces cut up and in a container thats easy to very quickly spread over the brittle&the extra step will create exactly the result you want. I think my guests will enjoy the presentation, and the taste!

Fun and delicious! The candy brittle is beautiful. The only challenge was spreading the ice cream smoothly
