I tried a variation of this recipe with lime, rather than lemon, and added cilantro. It was great!

People are lambasting the separation of vegetables for no reason. It's a composed salad, not a tossed salad. Yes, the description/instructions could have made that clearer. But it's not so unusual. A composed salad allows the individual parts to shine. The vinaigrette is what ties them together.

I guess they made salads differently 15 years ago. vegetable oil? keep the veggies separate? Seems to me that even in 1994 we knew better than that.

I would make this recipe again with the following changes: Use Olive oil and vinegar, salt and pepper, generous squeeze of fresh lemon juice and you have a fabulous dressing for this salad. Try it!

yes, I agree with 1/30/03 - why not combine all of the vegetables together? Pretty stupid if you ask me. I like to make a salad with just tomatoes and avocados and for the dressing - just use EVOO and vinegar with salt and pepper and it is out of this world, of course a litte red onion or sweet onion couldn't hurt. Its something about Olive Oil in a dressing, that's for sure. Make sure you let it marinate for a little while first, mmm mmm good.

I used this recipe as a base for a lettuce salad. My husband and I both thought the combination was good. For the dressing: 2-3 T lemon juice, 1 T white wine vinegar, 2-3 T olive oil, 1/8 t black pepper. For the salad: 2 sm seeded tomatoes, 1 avocado, 1 seeded English cucumber, 3-4 T sweet onion - diced and tossed with dressing. Tossed red leaf lettuce with additional dressing. Lettuce on plates topped with salad and a sprinkling of shredded parmesean cheese.

Sorry to say but this has got to be the stupidest recipe on the website. The "instructions" are completely confusing - keep the veggies separate until the end? Shouldn't the flavours meld? A pointless recipe and, worse, really boring. Sadly, these are my favourite veggies! Don't bother!!

I improve this with some modification. I substitute olive oil. I also like to add parsley or cilantro for added flavor. In my opinion balsamic or sherry wine vinegar give this a more exotic taste. Consider giving this a shot of tabasco for added zip.

I don't get it, vegetables are kept separate? Aren't they supposed to be tossed together for service?
