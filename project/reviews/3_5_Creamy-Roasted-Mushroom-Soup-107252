This soup was good, but I, like a lot of the reviewers, thought it lacked in body and layers of flavor. Don't judge me by doing this, but I added one can of golden mushroom soup and pureed one can of French Onion Soup to the mix. My guests were licking their bowls!

When the temperature drops, soup is on my menu and this is tops on the list. It is delicious. I use boxed chicken broth, sherry, and add a another T. of flour. I always make a double batch and give some away. It gets rave reviews

This was a very nice soup. I was a little lazy and didn't remove the gills of the mushroom, and I also threw all the mushrooms and broth in the pot at the same time, then used my immersion blender until I had the desired proportion of bits and puree. It still tasted good. Used more mushrooms as suggested by other reviewers, in my case 2 lbs of portobellos; and subbed the onion for shallots as others suggested. I used red wine, and put some extra in towards the end. And used only about 3/4 cup of whipping cream. And used mostly vegetable broth with some chicken broth, all reduced sodium. Definitely had to salt and pepper at the end.

Great soup, The only thing I would do differently is add more mushrooms, and I used beef broth instead of vegetable.

I used 1 1/2 lb of portobello and 1 lb button mushrooms, cleaned and cut up and roasted as directed. I used beef broth and added enough beef bouillon to give it a good flavor. I thought it was bland without this, even with the Madeira, and found it was not too salty. I returned most of the shrooms to the pot, holding back about 1 1/2 cup. Using a hand blender brought the desired texture and then I added the reserved shrooms, chopped coarsely. Wonderful!

Great recipe - must be the roasting of the mushrooms that set it apart. 1/2 tbsp black truffle paste worked well. Also sub'd some of the cream with sour cream.

Eventually, this became delicious soup. I used 1/3 vegetable stock, 2/3 red-sodium chicken stock. Everything else was as in the recipe. It tasted thin when I first made it, as if I didn't have enough mushrooms, or perhaps, too much stock. I ended up adding much more salt and pepper, nutmeg, but the topper was adding a tsp of sour cream to each bowl after serving. Now, it tastes rich and wonderful.

this was delicious! been having it for a week and about to make another batch. i used olive oil instead of butter, and half and half instead of heavy cream to make it lighter. didn't have any madeira, so used red wine. it really turned out perfectly, best mushroom soup i've had.

Used cremini (baby bella) and shiitake, which roasted down to little chips. Keep the shiitake pieces a bit larger than the more dense types of mushrooms. Also used shallots and roasted the garlic as others had suggested. All fine. What hasn't turned out so well is the substitution of chicken broth for the vegetable. Made the mistake of not using reduced sodium broth and now the soup is too salty. Added more cream and water in addition to nutmet, pepper and more thyme. So we'll see how it goes. Nice texture, but the mushroom taste has been overwhelmed by the chicken broth and salt. My advice is to stick to vegetable broth (make your own with the mushroom stems, celery and carrots) and add a little chicken broth if you like. I still have a bit of experimenting to do on this recipe, so I'll post my final results.

I have searched for years for a creamy mushroom soup this delicious! Roasting the mushrooms brings out the woodsy flavor in them. I used shallots instead of the onion, more garlic-of course! and I only had sherry- which was just fine! this is now a staple in my house.

It's always nice to read the reviews before proceeding with the recipe! I for one improvise and adapt regularly, and this delicious recipe is no exception. I didn't have enough of some of the ingredients so I portioned down - only used cremini mushrooms and dried porcinis, which I rehydrated, and used their liquid as part of the puree. Also used a beef bouillon cube and leftover stock. The recipe as called for was nice, but I added a handfull of nutmeg and a lot of cracked pepper to give the soup a bit more oomph. The result is heavenly - can't wait to share it with my husband when he comes home!

We've made this three times for holiday meals, and am planning to make again tomorrow for Thanksgiving. There are many helpful tips in the reviews that I would like to second: (1) Don't scrimp on the cheapy mushrooms... much less flavor. Get to a Farmer's Market if you can and buy about 1-1/2 pounds of shitakes and 1 pound of portobellos. (2) If you can, pick up a mushroom stock or base at a gourmet-ish grocery. Makes another huge flavor difference. (3) Use shallots instead of onions, for a smoother more complementary flavor. (4) Roasted garlic in the puree is nice. (5) Shave some truffle cheese on top of each bowl as you serve it! (6) And this is the most important part -- add three glasses of pinot noir, as your cooking... to drink for yourself as you cook. It makes the whole process much more enjoyable.

This soup needs a little help. I had to use some concentrated veggie or beef bouillon to give it more body. I used skim evaporated milk and pureed everything after it cooked for while. A large dollop of sherry was helpful too.

Delicious soup - had it as a starter for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it. I used all portobellos and baby bellas and pureed all of them instead of leaving chunks. I also roasted a head of garlic with the mushrooms and added that to the puree. Also used dry sherry. The next day added the leftovers to some leftover lentil soup, which was also amazing.

I served this soup for New year's Eve. One of my guests is a vegetaian and I really needed to break routine. This recipe did it. If I had made more, I think my guests would have skipped the main course and jsut had soup that evening. I had no Madeira so I used a merlot. Utterly declicious.

Dirt Soup! How I laughed when I read that review. I thought maybe people weren't de-gilling the portobellos, but even after doing so myself, it definitely looks like dirt soup, but it doesn't taste like it! It certainly is earthy, but in such a great way. I had trouble not gorging myself on this. I used half beef, half vegetable Knorr stock granules mixed up to very good effect. I only used portobellos and large button mushrooms, with a few grams of porcini thrown in for good measure. And when I added the stock to the blender (over all of the mushrooms), I used it to rinse the foil to get as much of the mushroomy goodness in. The remainder I ended up licking off! I agree wholeheartedly with the recommendation to replace some of the whippping cream with soured cream. It just works so well here. Either mincing finely, or reducing the onion by a little bit wouldn't hurt either. Perfect, creamy mushroom soup for me, ideal with toast soldiers to bring me back to being a child.

sorry this is A Cook from houston, tx who just reviewed.. I meant that I reduced the amount of all ingredients by 3/4, not just the mushrooms.

Rating: 4
This soup is AMAZING. I used only portobello mushrooms, and reduced the amount by 3/4. I was 'generous' with the salt and pepper for roasting the mushrooms, so that when the soup came together and I tried it it was seasoned perfectly. I used dry sherry as other users suggested. I put all of the mushrooms in the blender with some of the stock. I made this soup to use for homemade green bean casserole, and unfortunately it wasn't as creamy as I had hoped. I will adjust the soup accordingly for that application, but just by itself it's perfect.

This one is hard for me to review. I recently had the best cream of mushroom soup I'd ever eaten, so I was trying to find something like it. This isn't. It's not bad - everyone who ate it, loved it. But for me, it lacked oomph. I used additional mushrooms (cremini and oyster) and used beef broth as I thought it would add some nice depth, but in the end, it was just ok to me. I will make it again but probably try tweaking it a bit using the recommendations of other reviewers.

Rating: 4
This is the best! For a bit more depth of flavor, I slice the top off a head of garlic and add it to the roasting mushrooms (omit the 3 cloves used later). Then squeeze the roasted cloves into the mushrooms to be pureed. Cornstarch blended with Light cream makes the soup gluten-free and a little lighter; and a really good vegetable broth makes all the difference.

This is the first recipe I've ever bothered to review, and I'm doing it now because 1) I'm surprised at how good this is, and 2) I've had just enough wine to make it seem like a great use of my time. I almost tanked this recipe when I got distracted and didn't hear the timer go off for the mushrooms. They were a bit more done than I would have liked (i.e., crispy), but the soup still turned out fabulous -- I am shocked. I used chicken broth and herbes de provence, otherwise stuck to the recipe. Excellent -- will absolutely make again for the holidays!

Good flavor, unappealing looks. All those portobellos make for a lot of "black bits". I really had to cajole my DH to try it. When he finally did, he loved the flavor. In fairness to the recipe as it was created, I used all portobellos (what I had on hand) and chicken broth, which was OK. Very earthy , but not very eye-pleasing.

This is really a terrific soup. My husband and I had a mushroom soup at a local French restaurant recently. Since then, he has been driving me nuts to make a great mushroom soup. This did the trick!! I used a good quality dry sherry and shallots instead. I also like crimini mushrooms better, so I used those.....really, really rich and satisfying. My fifteen year old HATES mushrooms and LOVED the soup!! Make it...you wont be sorry!!!

I roasted approximately 2 lbs. cremini, oyster, and button mushrooms and used a mix of marsala cooking wine, cherry port and balsamic vinegar to replace the madeira (approximately 1/2 cup). Also added (2) scallions to my large chopped Vidalia onion. Used 4 cans of beef broth and 1 cup 1/2 and 1/2 instead of whipping cream. For herbs, I used a pinch each of steak seasoning, tarragon, and dried thyme with the onions while sauteeing. I also added 2 bay leaves after all liquids were added and it was simmering. Really had a nice, earthy flavor and my fiancee absolutely loved it. I served it with a warm, sliced baguette with lightly flavored honey butter that I make. We accompanied with a dry, light greek white wine as well. Very elegant for a relaxing fall evening.

Rating: 3
A friend gave me a sheep's head mushroom, so I roasted it (over 1 lb) per instructions. Substituted beef broth for veg. and fine dry sherry for madiera. It is good, but far from sublime. I think I overestimated my "wild" mushroom's contributions. Don't think they were as earthy and woodsy tasting as in the past, and I think that the mushroom is the key. I would add a bit more flour to thicken the soup more. A thicker texture would be a bit more satisfying to me.

Rating: 3
Perfect for the first rainy fall day! Doubled the Shitakes, used a mushroom stock, and added another 1/4 - 1/2 cup madiera with the cream for more flavor. The recipe doesn't specify but the sweetness of a basic Bual worked well. Let some of the mushrooms roast until crisp and tossed in at the last minute for a lovely textural contrast. An Alsatian Pinot Blanc paired better than the Chassagne-Montrachet. A good, solid soup -- not mind blowing, but perfect for a damp evening.

I have made this soup a couple of times. The first time I followed the recipe exactly, the second time I tried to "go cheap" and used your regular joe shmoe button mushrooms. Guess what. It wasn't as good. Still good, but not absolutely fantastic like it is when you follow the recipe.

I really liked this. I halved the recipe, except I used a little over a pound of mushrooms & it could've used more (I only used button mushrooms though). I used that "cooking red wine" (I don't drink) & instead of blending in the beginning, I put all of the soup in the blender at the end for a few seconds, so it was still a chunky. I also used beef broth, which was good, but I can imagine that vegetable broth would be better. Oh- & I used 1% milk instead of cream- - tasted good to me! will definitely make again! mushrooms smelled great roasting & would make a great side dish on their own!

I love this recipe. I made this recipe with a few minor changes that make it less complicated. (1) I tossed cut up button, shitake and crimini mushrooms in EVOO and sea salt and roasted in a 400 oven for about 20 minutes. I didn't fuss with the foil part. I then poured the mushrooms and accummulated juices from the pan into the pot and followed the rest of the recipe pretty much as is. I used an immersion blender to get the whole soup more like a bisque, but it was still chunky enough. I didn't have any sherry but the soup was fabulous anyway. I will make this again and again.

I made a lot of changes to the recipe but the soup was still a big hit-- white wine instead of sherry and just plain button mushrooms, omitting the thyme. Just before serving, a little white truffle oil was just the perfect addition. I would try making it using sherry as I'm sure it would add greater depth of flavour than just white wine. However, I would still leave out thyme which I love, but don't find all that appealing paired with mushrooms.

I used more mushrooms beacause I love them, and I used light cream and the results were wonderful and tasty! Also, for the health conscious the more mushrooms you use and puree, the less cream you will have to use to thicken the soup! Either way this is a keeper!

I'm a nurse and a Mom. Certainly not a seasoned chef. But, my house smells luscious and the soup does taste very good. (I made this for my son who really likes mushrooms) I did puree the entire batch of soup and add a extra can of broth in doing so. Might just put it in the frig and eat it tomorrow since everyone liked it better on the second day. Maybe I'll add some cooked small potatoes too. I know I also added a lot more mushrooms than the recipe called for. Not bad for my first try. The fresh thyme is also a very nice flavor to the soup.

It is a real subtle soup with some wonderful flavors. My husband liked it better than I did, I felt it could use some improvement. This time I used the small portabella mushrooms and rehydrated porcinis. I roasted a couple of shallots with the mushrooms and added them when I pureed the mushrooms. My grocery store didn't have madeira so I used marsala instead. I saved a lot of time by roasting the mushrooms while I was preparing the liquid portion of the soup. Next time I'll do things a little different: I'll use white wine and cognac or a good spanish sherry instead of marsala. I'll also puree the whole soup, I didn't like the onion pieces. I think adding sauteed sliced criminis at the end will give the soup a nice touch.

This is a great soup and really easy to make. I've made it twice and my guests have loved it. Be sure to use homemade chicken stock (if you can.) Also--the second time I made this I increased the amount of mushrooms by about a third. The reason: they shrink in roasting. Try this soup! It's wonderful.

This soup is fabulous! Rich, sweet and smoky. I used some very nice, sweet sherry instead of the madiera. Be careful during the last 15 minutes of roasting the mushrooms uncovered, a few of mine ended up pretty crispy. Wonderful soup - it will be a winter staple in my house!

Not overly impressed with this one. I used the broth the mushrooms gave off and pureed it in my food processor. I didn't like the consistency of the 'paste', it wasn't smooth enough. Should I have used a blender? Would it have made a difference? I also couldn't find shitakes, so used baby bellos. Didn't have fresh thyme so used dried thyme and fresh rosemary. The broth flavor was okay, but I had to add lots of salt and freshly ground pepper. Also dumped in my glass of wine. The finished product was okay, but I wouldn't make it again.

Eating the leftovers right now, and it does taste better than last night. I served with homemade foccaccia and added some porcinis and crimini to the mix instead of shitake.

Probably, but I would try other mushroom soup recipies first. It was also a little watery for my taste - I like thicker soups so I would add less broth as well.

I thought the soup was only fair. On the wine for cooking discussion: Yes, we've heard everyone say "if you wouldn't drink it, don't cook with it."

Those are awful - any brand, any flavor. It's pure sodium!

I would probably use chicken broth if I made again, not being vegetarian. Some vegetable broths are iffy and can make a difference in finished product.

Shiitakes tend to be a little rubbery, so I cut them into smaller pieces. Portobellos are too earthy and robust for this recipe (for me,) so I used Crimini. Next time I'm going to try a little horseradish... Steve is absolutely right - cook the cheap stuff and drink the high end. Anything else is just plain foolish.

Fantastic, rich and earthy soup. I had no problem with the texture of the mushrooms. This was served as the starter course for our Thanksgiving dinner, primarily to provide a hearty course for the vegetarians in the group. Everyone loved it, including a picky 5-year-old who thinks she hates mushrooms. I made this ahead and it was even better the next day, and was the first leftover everyone went for the day after Thanksgiving. Definitely a keeper!

Wonderful! For those who aren't happy with the texture of the 'shrooms, try blending most of the soup instead of doing the chunkier version -- we found the smoother version absolutely irresistable (kids and adults alike)... Also, next time I think I'll used half and half; it's so thick when blending most of the batch that I don't think it will be noticed...

Not my favorite at all. All the ingredients sounded perfect, but none of us liked it. Might try it again with a mushroom broth...

After reading all the reviews, and praise, my expectations were rather high for this recipe. Needless to say, it didn't quite live up to them. We did follow the recipe and when all was said and done, it needed to stay on the simmer to soften the mushrooms further. I enjoyed the earthiness of the soup, and it did have nice "mouth feel" how could it not with all that cream! But all in all, I didn't think it was a standout.

Hmmmm....like someone else who posted, my 'shrooms came out a little chewy even though I prepared them as instructed. I wonder how they'd have been if I'd used dried. Otherwise, I like the flavor of the soup a lot and served it with a fresh home-made loaf of Italian bread. Very nice.

we used a port with the portobello's a little cheese and a good bread and our kid's thought we were in italy delightfull

A real winner! This hearty soup can easily be a meal in it self. I prepared it exactly to the recipe. For such simple ingredients, it offers a complex and delightful array of flavors. I had my first taste with a glass of Merlot and crusty bread. Ambrosia! Can't wait to make it again for guests.

This soup rocks! Used a Medium Dry Maderia and made the vegetable stock using the shiitake mushroom stems and herbs de Provence. Can you say yum? Sure you can!

I didn't like the concentration of the madera. I would 1 cut the madera by2/3, add more mushrooms,consontrate the stock more and maybe use clear chicken stock instead. [ I did make my vegatable stock of mushrooms and a bit of charrdonay[to bring forth a stronger mushroom essence]].Even as is, the recipe would be great in a thermos on the side of the ice-skating pond.

Wow! I feel like I've entered a chatroom frequented by a bunch of highschoolers. Stop the name calling and criticism already! It's only soup. Speaking of which, I'm eating mine now and it's pretty good.

This was okay. I think next time I will try it with plain ol' button mushrooms. The portobellos and shitakes came out rubbery for me (cooked the amt. of time the recipe called for, so they weren't overcooked). Making it with FF half and half makes this a very light and healthy soup. Oh, and Steve, madeira can be sweet OR dry; Brendan, you were a jerk; Karla, it's actually spelled "break".

To Brendon, I hate to brake it to you but some people like me need recipes they can make for thier family that doesn't cost much. Some poeple are poor but they still have to cook something!

This is to Brendon- you were totally out of line with that insensitive comment. Hasn't your mother ever taught you that if you can't say something nice about a person, keep your mouth shut. Maybe Steven didn't have the money for a better wine & did the best with what he had to work with. Geeesh, some people! You owe him an appology!

I also made this soup for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit - even among our Russian guests who really know mushroom soup! I also added morrels (dried-reconsituted-liquid added) and reserved those for garnish as well a shaving of romano on each bowl. As an aside, I have to agree with Steve - inexpensive for cooking is perfectly fine, it's when the wine is unadulterated by other flavors (from cooking) that quality truly matters.

I think that people need to remember that taste is subjective and that we are just talking about soup and wine. There is no need to get nasty with anyone. Steve didn't poison your cat, or kill your family, he just used inexpensive wine.By the way, the soup was very good.

Wow, Steve. You cook with cheap. Bet that was some soup. Must taste pretty cheap as well. Please keep me off your invitation list!

Good recipe, along with a salad, for a cold evening at home. I substituted Port for the Madeira also and it worked fine. The roasted mushrooms are great and consistency of the soup is good and thick. I would make it again.

I made this soup for a soup and dessert church potluck and had at least 6 people asking me for the recipe. The organizer announced how great it was to the entire congregation. I substituted a Tawny Port for the Madiera.

Actually Madeira is a dry wine. Sherries can go from dry to sweet, but Madeira is always dry. Madeira can range from cheap to very expensive. I cook with cheap and drink expensive. I usually cook with Paul Masson or Livingston cellars.

I served this as an appetizer and we couldn't finish our entrees. We didn't expect it to be so hearty. I didn't have Madeira so I used Chablis instead. I also used heavy cream. Next time, I'll probably use light cream.

This was so delicious! I can't wait to have the leftovers tonight. I used a nice cab instead of madiera, but I think a sweet madiera would give the soup some depth. I was amazed at how flavorful this soup is. I highly recommend it!

Thanks for the question, Frederick, I've wondered the same about several recipes that called for Madeira. I've never bought it before.

Rating: 4
Be sure to watch the roasting time and mushroom conditions during the last 15 minute roasting time. I cut the recipe in half and the mushrooms did not require near the amount of final roasting time (the uncovered portion of roasting time) that the recipe suggested. This was terrific! It was our Thanksgiving dinner soup we started the meal with. I served it in my Lenox china tea cups and it was loved around the table.

The soup sounds delicious & I am dying to make it, but I had a question. Which of the Maderias did y'all use? They can run the gamut of dry to very sweet. Any help would be appreciated, especially from the 4 Forks folks.

WOW!!! This was one of the best mushroom soups I've had in a long time. I served it as the first course to my Thanksgiving meal.I got lots of OOOOsand Ah's.Even my son-in-law(very picky eater) loved it. I used Marsala instead of Mederia.It was great! A keeper for sure!

I made this for Thanksgiving and doubled the recipe adding some button mushrooms as the store didn't quite have enough portobellos. My family and friends loved it. Even the "non-mushroom" eaters. Some said no soup and then when they saw and smelled the others eating it, had to have some! Definitely a keeper.

Mushrooms are not my favorite thing, but this recipe made me a convert...I loved the richness and the earthy flavor of the mushrooms. I will be making this for Thanksgiving.

My family loves mushrooms AND garlic, so i made this immediately upon finding the recipe. I was actually as much motivated by the 'bad' review as the good one, since "too garlicky" is one of the best recommendations i could hear. (and obviously, if you don't like so much garlic, all you have to do is reduce it) We love it as-is though; it will probably be an every-other-sunday dish, after our afternoon hikes.

I very rarely give recipes 4 forks but this recipe definitely deserves it. It was creamy, earthy and easy to prepare. Everyone, including my picky mother, loved the soup and went back for seconds and thirds.

Yuk. Too garlicky. There are other mushroom soup recipes that are easier and tastier. We threw most of it out.
