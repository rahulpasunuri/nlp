Wow! This was much better than we expected. We like orzo, but we only tried this recipe because of the many positive reviews. It lived up to its expectations - the Parmesan and the fresh rosemary seemded to make it special!

Excellent! Even my husband ate it and he hates cooked carrots!

This was very good...interesting with the carrots and cheese. I added water/broth as if cooking risotto as suggested by another reviewer, and it DOES take more like 20 minutes to cook, not ten. It was good, creamy...not fabulous, but very good.

Have been making this recipe since I read it with the Chicken Salitmboca. A little of the lemon sauce goes great over the carrot orzo...make together. They compliment each other well.

This recipe is idiot proof and I've made it 4-5 times. My young kids love it too. I have used Rosemary from the spice rack (just as good-a little goes a long way). I also tend to add more cheese. But, then you can season to taste. Also, don't worry if you don't get the carrots exact....the more you add, it tends to keep the Orzo from drying out. Just a really cool dish...give it a try!

Surprisingly lovely. Loved that the carrots stayed al dente. Added some lemon zest while the dish was simmering with great effect.

It seemed as if there was a lot going on in this recipe but I tried it anyway and was pleasantly surprised at how well the flavors and textures came together. It's also a nice way to combine veggies and starch into one dish. Thanks to all the previous reviewers for talking me into it!

My family and anyone who tries it loves this dish. It's easy, and most of the ingredients we have on hand all the time. I also like the idea of throwing in veggies anywhere I can.

This is my son's favorite side dish, despite that he has decided that he doesn't like carrots anymore. Sometimes I use stars instead of orzo, and that certainly bumps up the kid appeal! I usually use 2 C chicken stock and 1 C water, and no green onions, and if my mother-in- law is coming, I use thyme instead of rosemary. This is a really wonderful side dish.

Excellent orzo dish that I stumbled across by accident, while searching for a chicken saltimbocca with lemon sauce recipe. Really, really good for such a basic dish. While sautéing the orzo and carrots, heat the water & stock in a separate saucepan and add hot to the orzo mix (as if making risotto). That'll keep it closer to the 10 minutes.

This is a fantastic recipe for little ones, thanks to the creamy texture, mild flavors, and natural sweetness of the carrots. My 17-month-old absolutely devoured it! Plus it's loaded with veggies that picky eaters won't even notice. And a bonus -- mommy loves it, too.

This was a great last minute lunch, as I happened to have an old hunk of parmesan and some baby carrots in the fridge. Chopping the carrots roughly by hand was easier than dealing with a food processor, and gave the dish a more rustic look and texture. I agree with previous reviewers that it does take longer than 10 minutes to reduce the liquid, but it's still a very quick dish to make. I also agree that you may want to add your spicy ingredient of choice - a dash of tobasco, some extra black pepper, a strongly flavored herb - as it is otherwise a very sweet and creamy dish. Either way, it is excellent in its simplicity.

20 minutes, not 10. Consider adding water and stock as for risotto rather than all at once. I bumped the garlic, cheese, onion and rosemary about 15% for taste. With fresh carrots straight from the ground this would be unnecessary. A good summer dish.

Easy and delicious - i used basil and pine nuts instead of green onions and rosemary, and probably more parm, salt & pepper than recommended.

Fantastic - a great spin on ordinary orzo with added health benefits and deliciousness. Will certainly make this again for the easy prep and great taste.

didn't have fresh rosemary...it was quite good nonetheless, but perhaps a bit lacking.

Agreed, the liquid takes 20 minutes to absorb, not 10.

This orzo dish perfectly compliments the chicken satimbocca in the same issue of Bon Appetit. I wouldn't change a thing.

Takes 20 minutes (not 10). Uses ALL the broth. I will use store-bought shredded carrots next time and will not put in the mixture until the last scoop of broth goes in.

delicious, agree with previous reviewers that it took much longer for the liquid to absorb

Make this. It will become a regular addition to your table. My 13-year-old son requested it for his birthday dinner (of course, I had to double the recipe), so the appeal of this recipe crosses age lines. Go with the broth, and add a few dashes of Green Tabasco. Easy. Good. Can't beat it.

Delicious. Definitely took longer than 10 minutes for the liquid to reduce- but it was worth it. Don't skimp on the parmesan!

liquid took a good 20 minutes to fully absorb, but loved the dish. Was a nice companion to the Grilled Steak Kebabs with Orange and Hoisin Glaze also on this site.

Pretty good, I recommend using all broth and cutting back on the rosemary. I also think shredding the carrots would make for a better presentation.

Have made a few times now; the first time the family commented that while delicious the cooked grated carrots made the dish look like, um, vomit... :-( so now I cut julienned carrots into little cubes and that seems to help it look better. Used all broth, and shallots, and cooked as for risotto. Easily doubled or tripled for large gatherings; have even made this on a camping trip w/ veggies prepped in advance and a frozen ziplock of homemade stock. Delicious!

At first I didn't think this would be anything special, but it is wonderful. I made it again for my husband and he also loved it. Would be great for kids...

Delicious. I have made this multiple times. Need to double the recipe, though, because it does not go as far as it is good.

Very good. Will definately make again.

Very, very tasty. My only advise is to add a little lemon zest to help balance out the rosemary. Also, instead of cooking it until the liquid was absorbed, I cooked it until the orze was just bit past al dente. There was extra liquid, but that thickened up as the dish cooled off a bit, giving it a nice saucy texture.

wonderful flavor, goes well with fish,poultry,beef. wouldn't change anything except make double portions forleftovers

Very good. I used all chicken broth and it was very flavorful. I am not sure the cheese added anything and will likely omit it next time. Also substituted chives for the scallions.

I thought this was an excellent dish. The flavors melded together very well. I did use all chicken stock instead of water. I served it wth maple glazed pork chops

Rating: 3
This dish is a great way to use up the rest of those carrots you don't know what to do with. The key here is to use real parmesano reggiano and fresh herbs, whether it's rosemary, basil, or sage (they all work). Without the bold flavors these ingredients convey to the dish, I agree with other reviewers that it will be just so so. But when fresh is used, the dish is very good.

This was delicious, super easy and beautiful on the plate. My 3 yr old enjoyed helping me make it, and enjoyed eating it!

My husband and I liked the dish with the chicken in the magazine. It did take a little longer, but not a deal breaker. I had no green onions or fresh rosemary so I used about a 1/4 tsp of dried rosemary and a really good fresh parmesan cheese. Next time I would skip the rosemary and use some of the sage from the chicken recepie.

I agree this was ok. Sort of blah, but fine for a side -- took longer than it said. The spousal unit loved it. We had it with the chicken saltimbocca from the same issue. We need a "maybe" option on the Would You Make it Again question.

Rating: 2
This was ok. I guess I thought it would be creamier and have more carrot flavor. I used really baby carrots instead of the whittled down ones they sell in bags. I thought this would make the sweet carrot flavor stand out more. In the end it took twice as long as the recipie stated for the orzo to cook and even when it had the carrot was still a little raw. I think I might make it again but next time I will blanch the carrot before I put it in the food processor

This was good and easy to make. I served it with grilled lamb chops and steamed artichokes. My very picky husband and equally picky 13-year-old daughter asked for seconds. I'll be making it again -- a good basic side dish! (Note: It took more like 20 minutes, not 10, for the liquid to be absorbed, but perhaps that's because I was cooking it at high altitude.)

We loved this new take on orzo and it was so easy to prepare.I served it with a lemon pepper roast chicken and broccoli. I only did a half recipe for the 2 of us and wished I'd done the whole thing. I agreee leftovers, dresed with a bit of olive il and vinegar would make a lovely cold salad.

We liked this , though the rosemary made it taste a bit like, um, dirt- good dirt. I will try basil or another herb next time.

Fantastic recipe ! I just served it at a dinner party and everyone took seconds and thirds. It went beautifully with a garlic shrimp bake, and I can imagine it paired with all kinds of meat. I think I would make it for a cold salad, as well. A keeper!

What an easy and delicious side dish --to go along any entree....We had it with the crusty wasabi salmon in the same issue and it was a perfect compliment. I'm not a big fan of herbs so I omitted the rosemary and it was great -- my husband loved it too..would make it again and again and again and would serve to guests as well. One thing I found -- it took about 10 minutes longer until the liquid was absorbed.

This is a lovely weeknight dish. Very easy. Used adult carrots (3) and thyme when I realized I didn't have rosemary. It really elevated the breaded fish fillet we paired it with. This will go into heavy rotation.

Served this with the "CHICKEN SALTIMBOCA WITH LEMON SAUCE" (recipe on this site. The combination was delicious. The rosemary in this recipe blended wonderfully with the sage in the saltimboca. I used some lemon zest in the orzo for some added zing.

A good side dish - nothing spectacular but easy to make. I think it would be better with a little more zing. Maybe some ginger or cayenne? Would probably be good using squash instead of carrots too. Will make it again - but not in the "regular rotation".

Rating: 3
Very good with a salty/savory main course such as the saltimboca (also v.v.good). I added fresh ginger and aditional garlic as well as fresh thyme and used all chicken broth with no water. next time I will add a little sugar and it could stand some extra parm too.. a great and easy alternative to risotto- does not need that much attention and could be made ahead of time as long as you didnt add the cheese and herbs. I reheated with a little more chicken broth and THEN added that stuff in- didnt get gloppy at all..

Tasty, but not knock your socks off spectacular. A good way to get in your veggies without feeling like you're eating them! I third the long cooking time, though I was using stelline (which have worked just fine as a substitute for orzo in the past for me). I also used some cheddar instead of parmesan. Went quite well with some braised pork chops.

I made this last night for Valentine's Day along with the Chicken Saltimbocca (in the same issue). It was delicious and simple for a weeknight meal. It took longer for all of the liquid to be absorbed (15 - 20 minutes). This side dish is a keeper as is the Chicken Saltimbocca!!

Rating: 4
This is a REALLY amazing side-dish. When I saw it in the magazine I just had to try it. The only comment that I want to make is that it took longer than 10 minutes for the orzo to soak up the broth and the water. It took me 15-20 minutes before all of the liquid was absorbed. It is well worth the wait, though!!
