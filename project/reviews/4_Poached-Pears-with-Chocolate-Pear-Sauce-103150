Easy and delicious. Was going to a dinner party attended by vegan, gluten- and dairy-avoiding guests and as usual, epicurious saved the day. I substituted banana juice for the pear nectar and Bourbon (ratio 1:3 of alcohol to the banana juice instead of 1:1 wine: juice as the original recipe called for). Also didn't peel the pears as I like the vitamins in the peel. Turned out delicioso!

Good but a lot of mixed reviews. I had a hard time finding pear nectar before we flew home but finally did (Whole Foods). Lots of places had juice but I'm glad I found the thicker nectar. Again it makes a lot more sauce than you really need but it stores well. The only issue I ran into was the sauce crystallizing unless I stirred it constantally then recrystallizing on the plate. Obviously I did something wrong. Decent desert definitely, not great the way I executed it but I followed the directions to a T. Any help?

I will make this again, and again, and again, ..., etc. This was a surprise ending to a great meal. The chocolate pear reduction came out flawless. The pears were tender and full of flavor. It was not overpowering or too sweet. I only had fudge swirl ice cream in the freezer, so I used the instead vanilla. I also used whatever white wine was in the fridge (not dry) and it was a perfect. I have a photo I would love to post if I can only figure out how to do it.

I made this yesterday for a dinner party tonight. I poached the pears yesterday and they looked fine. This morning, they are brown colour. I tasted them they taste ok, but don't look nice. I am thining I will put the chocolate sauce on the plate, pear and then top with the ice cream to hide the look of the pears. The mango sauce is really a nice flavour.

Excellent. I've made it twice and preferred the pears warm. The chocolate-pear sauce is delicious and kept well in the fridge for weeks.

Delicious! This was a huge hit at a dinner party. I followed another reviewer's hint and used mango nectar instead of pear nectar, and it worked wonderfully. I found that the cooking times for both the pears and reducing the sauce needed to be closer to 15-20 minutes, but that was my only problem.

Wonderful way to end a big meal. My guests loved it and it was simple to make ahead. I left the pears out at room temperature and reheated the chocolate sauce in the microwave right before serving. Served it with biscotti.

This was excellent, easy and a cinch to make. I poached the pears and made the sauce as directed. I plated with heated vanilla ice cream as a 'warm' sauce, put a small circle of pund cake on top of that, fanned the pear on top of the pound cake and drizzled the chocolate sauce over that. It was excellent. Very elegant and satisfying. I will definitely make this again.

Easy, pretty healthy, light enough to be a good dessert after a rich supper, and impressive - perfect for dinner parties. I used white chocolate and it was fantastic.

this recipe was fast, deelish and easy. The key to success, though, is presentation. The pears are visually lackluster, as is the vanilla ice cream. I plated with mint sprigs and pomegranate seeds (only because they were on hand). Lacking both pear nectar and the time to shop for it, I replaced with mango nectar. Wonderful! Adds a sharpness that pear would not. I bet most any nectar would do. This recipe makes way more chocolate sauce than you need but why skimp? I just had a midnight bowl of chocolate sauce over vanilla ice cream. Yum!

Served this at a family function and my aunt wouldn't let me take the leftovers home. Everyone loved it. I served it with pound cake and that served as a great compliment to the chocolate sauce.

Based on other reviews, I must have done something wrong during the trial run of this recipe. I found it very bland. I also hate to write thatI substituted or added something, but...I added 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg and 3 whole cloves to the pear nectar mixture and removed the cloves before adding chocolate. My guests really enjoyed it and I think the additions added some interest to the sauce. I will definitely make this again.

Followed the recipe and it worked well. Prepared it two days in advance. Pears turned alittle, but after fanning them and pouring the chocolate sauce they looked fine and tasted great. Added a sprig of mint for color.

Made this for a dinner party and everyone liked it a lot. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and served the pears with raspberry sorbet, which was a great flavor combination.

Made this for my parents' birthday dinner (their birthdays are one day after the other) and it received 2 enthusiastic thumbs up from my mom and my dad, who is normally not very effusive when it comes to food, said it was very good! I made the mistake of using Bartlett pears that were too underipe so it took almost an hour of poaching for them to be the right consistency. Otherwise, delish!

I hate those reviews that start with " I substituted this for that, etc etc, but I made this with red wine, and with apple juice instead of pear nectar (I couldn't stand the idea of spending 3$ for something I was only going to use a cup of) Needless to say it turned out fantastic !!! Real simple, real easy, and real good !!!! Cheers John

This recipe is easy and fabulous! I've used red wine (pinot and merlot) with wonderful results. It's even great without the ice cream--a 4 point WW dessert!

simple and delicious. I used red wine. Use high quality chocolate - it makes a big difference

Very simple to make and very good, especially with Valhrona chocolate! For a more elegant--and easier to eat--presentation, I swirl the sauce over a plate, then slice and fan the pear halves on top. A good reaspberry sorbet in place of ice cream makes for an inspired taste combination.

I knew I didn't like chocolate with raspberries or chocolate with strawberries - now I know I don't like chocolate with pears either. And much as I love pears poached with spices, poaching pears in pear nectar and white wine produces something very akin to CANNED pears!

If you're a fruit of the month club recipient and cringe when you get a big box of pears...this recipe is for you! I'm not wild about pears but this recipe really was delicious. My husband loved it too.

Couldn't find pear nectar so substituted 1 jar strained baby pears + 1 jar baby pear juice and used only half the chocolate called for. Sauce thickened up nice and fudgey. I served it cold (spread rather than poured on pears, also cold)and topped with crushed Amaretti crumbs. I left out the ice cream, dessert tasted rich and delicious and the Amaretti crumbs added a nice almond crunch

The taste was great, but I don't think I reduced the juice enough because it was to runny. I was hoping for a more fudge like sauce.

This was good. I agree with another poster that a little butter rounds out the sauce nicely.

This is a great recipe to have on hand! It's quick and easy, calls for just a handful of ingredients, and is delicious! Early in the day, I poached the pears, set them aside, and reduced the syrup. At serving time, I just heated the poaching liquid and whisked in the chocolate. I thought the sauce was much improved by whisking in a tablespoon or two of butter at the end.

Easy to make and what a hit! Definitely a keeper. Very light and refreshing with just the right amount of chocolate. I made them without the ice cream and don't think I would have them any other way.

FABULOUS!! This is a perfect "light" ending to an elegant meal. The chocolate pear sauce is a terrific complement. I plan to swirl a raspberry coulis alongside the chocolate sauce next time for something different.

Rave reviews. I used less sugar than recipe called for. Very tasty and easy to prepare.

My dinner guests couldn't get enough of this refreshing, elegant dessert. Combining the chocolate with the poaching liquid gives the sauce a unique sweet-tart quality. My pears were apparently too "under-ripe" and took about twice as long as the recommended time to poach sufficiently, so make sure you check the pears with a fork before you remove them from the liquid. I will definitely prepare this recipe again.
