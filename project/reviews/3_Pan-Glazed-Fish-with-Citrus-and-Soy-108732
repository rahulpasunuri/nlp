The glaze was tasty, nothing amazing, but good. The cooking method made it very easy to overcook the fish while trying to get the glaze to reduce, which is what happened to us. So, yes, it's simple, but I found it rather easy to screw up.

I made this with Tuna medium rare and topped it with scallions instead of lime wedges. Very good, quick and easy too!!

It was delicious. A bit salty, but that may have been because we used regular soy sauce. Also, we made a combination of scallops and some other white, flaky fish (can't remember which)- and the scallops were excellent. Got the mirin and sake inexpensively in a Japanese food store.

I made this for my brother-in-law's birthday. Everybody loved it. I used cod. I highly recommend this dish!!

Excellent...and so easy! I made this with swordfish steaks for New Year's Eve, and everyone loved it! I didn't have sake, so I substituted white wine, which worked fine.
