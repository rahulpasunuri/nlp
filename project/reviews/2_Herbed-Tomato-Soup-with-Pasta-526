I absolutely love this soup and make it any time I'm sick. I use a regular pot and lid instead of a Dutch over and it turns out perfectly.

This is one of our favorite soups!! My husband loves it. I have made one adjustment to it. I double the amount of pasta so it is more filling. I have made it on several occasions to serve at work and it always got rave reviews.

Seems very odd to class this as a tomato soup when there's no tomato in the list of ingredients!

I have made this several times. The recipe calls for adjustments - I found mini-shells the best pasta to use. I also add a little hot sauce, and at the end throw in a cup of parm/romano cheese to thicken the soup and add more flavor

There isn't anything remarkable about this soup. Even with spicy vegetable juice, it lacked something.

The recipe gets its "tomato-ness" from the spicy vegetable juice. Enjoy!

Did I miss something? Tomato soup that has no tomatoes in it? Yum.
