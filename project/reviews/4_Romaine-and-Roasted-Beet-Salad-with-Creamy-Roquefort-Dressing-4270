This salad is excellent. The dressing is a bit tart, but very good with the sweetness of the beats. We made it at my mother in laws house for Thanksgiving, and now plan on making it for Christmas eve dinner it was so delicious!

This was excellent! But was glad I read reviews first... this definitely very garlicky, tho' I do grate my garlic not chop it. Next time will use less. Also did not have roquefort. Used goat cheese & it was great! Definitely will make again.

Excellent dressing, made with just one substitution - half & half in lieu of full cream. We're huge fans of blue cheese and will find any excuse to incorporate it into a meal. I had all ingredients on hand to compose a lovely 'wedge' of romaine, cryovac-packaged steamed beets (sold at Trader Joe's), and pecans. The dressing is quite thick - I wouldn't say 'drizzle' is the appropriate terminology. Just spoon some dollops of it across your salad.

I've been making this dressing for a few years now, always with great results. I usually arrange belgian endives on a plate, followed by juliened beets, and top it with crushed pistachios for crunch. Dressed it, and voila! Beautiful presentation and delicious!making it again tonight!

I first made this for a holiday dinner party where I wanted something red and green on the plate. I have made it several times since. I omit the red onion as the shallot in the dressing is enough onion for me. The salad makes a beautiful presentation and it's delicious. Yum!

Great salad, fabulous dressing.

I loved this dressing! I didn't really measure the ingredients, but I'm sure I used way less than 1/2 C mayo and I substituted plain yogurt for the whipping cream (sweetened with a little bit of honey to compensate for the sour yogurt taste). I also used mixed greens from the farmers market instead of the romaine and the different texture didn't matter. I added a hardboiled egg as well.

I am always amazed when someone makes a MAJOR revision to a recipe and then rates it...Please "mw1", do us a favor and refrain from rating recipes you did not prepare -- it skews the fork rating that many of us value. Experimentation is fun and encouraged, but if you omit the beets from a beet salad, you are no longer rating a beet salad recipe and your review is not relevant. Thanks! As to the recipe as written: I agree with the other beet reviewers that it was delicious and is a "keeper".

Very good! Not great! Made it exactly as per the recipe. Nothing bad. Just nothing to rave about.

This salad was stupendous.Couldn't find the cheese so I substituted Stilton - not as creamy, but worked great. This is going into my permanent recipe file.

Fantastic! I had a dinner party with 6 and everyone raved. I put the beets on individual plates first - tossed the rest of the salad ingredients and put on top of beets - then drizzled dressing over all. No bleeding, was beautiful and everyone wanted seconds.

This is my favorite salad. I have made it many times and I wouldn't change a thing. The beets are crucial and I have never been put off by any amount of "bleeding". If the beets are put on at the end and the salad is arranged and not tossed at all, I have experienced minimal pinkness. Yumm!!

The beets are mandatory. Just add them as a garnish at the very end.

I have made this salad several times and gotten rave reviews from all. The beets really make the dish but if you don't like beets, the dressing is fabulous. Put the beets on last to avoid the hot pink!

Did not make the salad but the dressing is out of this world!! The dressing deserves 4 forks!!

Whether serving this at home or bringing to a function, this recipe is requested. I omit the beets (only due to the "bleeding"), use hearts of romaine for ease of preparation and garnish with chopped bacon. Very nice.

I prepared the dressing and used it with iceberg lettuce wedges and it is excellent. My four forks rating in for the dressing, which is easy to prepare and better than any I have tried. I will possibly try the whole salad later, but I am an iceberg lettuce fan.

Based on the other reviews, I substituted sliced fresh oranges for the beets. Also, I omitted the watercress. The dressing is fabulous, and the presentation is beautiful. This was a real hit with my significant other and three of his golf partners. Reminds me very much of a salad served at Kaiser Grille in Palm Springs.

This was a great salad. The beets do color the salad a horrible pastel pink color, I would not omit the beets next time, because they taste great. I would just add them to each plate. I added pomegranite seeds, hard boiled egg, and bacon. Then to the dressing I added fresh lemon juice. It was really really good!

When I tasted the dressing to ensure it was fit for guests, I couldn't believe I had made it. It is gourmet restaurant quality and so simple. I used leaf lettuce instead of romaine and, although I am a huge fan of beets, I will cut down on the number next time. They turned the whole salad very pink and it became visually unappetizing

My husband and I have made this recipe many times. The dressing is to die for. We omit the beets and substitute 2 tangerines. Peel and put slices on the salad. The combination of Roquefort, nuts, red onions, and oranges is outstanding. Try this one!!!!
