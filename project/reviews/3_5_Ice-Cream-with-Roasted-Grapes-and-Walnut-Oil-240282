It is good, but there are a lot of other dessert options I would prefer. It is very quick & easy which makes it a plus, and even young kids can help which is always important in my kitchen.

This is ridiculously good. Walnut oil is key.

I love vanilla ice cream and I love odd yet simple recipes (which I consider this one to be): This was a treat not to be beat!

This was really easy and awfully good. A lot of bang for not much effort, and not really heavy, which is great after a big meal where you just need a little sweet.

Try this with La Nogalera Walnut Oil, absolutely delish! Unique and great dessert!
