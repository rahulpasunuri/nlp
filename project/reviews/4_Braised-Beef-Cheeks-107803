Super-easy to make - the house smelled wonderful, and the dish was spoon-tender! Even better after resting overnight. Served with cauliflower mash and plenty of pan sauce. Adjusted slightly for 5 lbs of Prather Ranch beef cheeks (certified humane purveyor) which my 17 yr. old son and I demolished in 2 days. This is a fantastic, homey dish that is impossible not to love!

Made this over the Easter weekend and it was just fabulous. As suggested made on the Friday to eat on Easter Sunday. My Beef Cheeks did not need trimming and were well marbled and when reheated at about 120 C in a fan assisted oven came out wonderfully well. The only additions I made were mixed dried mushrooms, re-hydrated, at the initial point of cooking and then left over red wine about half a glass, and a little home made chicken stock to thin down the sauce which after cooling from the original cooking was very thick. This was all served with Mustard Mash, Oven Roasted Potatoes,roasted in chicken fat (very naughty) and steamed cauliflower florets and petit pois. This all accompanied by a Chilean Merlot which balanced the richness of the beef and sauce very well.

Oh, forgot to add that cooking short ribs too long loses the flavor! Cooked 3lbs for just 2.5- 3 hours or until soft in slow cooker.

awesome I did as another reviewer and slow cooked it for a few hours and then finished it in the oven. perfect! and SO easy. I used short ribs, couldn't get the beef cheeks in time.

Made this for the first time for Thanksgiving, having chanced upon it at Sam's Club (who knew??). I only trimmed the gristle & fat minimally. Also added two heads of garlic and a few bay leaves. Upped the cooking time, reduced the oven temp to 275F. Removed meat and strained the soup, heated more to reduce, smashing the garlic bits in it. Crazy delicious & easy. Shredded the leftovers & stuffed them into fresh raviolis.

This was fall apart amazing. However, the beef cheeks were very difficult to trim. I honestly feel that this would have been just as good with many other cuts of meat. I served this at a family dinner last night and everyone raved. Made with brussel sprout and radicchio salad, gruyere rolls, and rosemary potatoes. Unbelievable flavor and consistency. Will definitely make this again.

This was absolutely delicious. The sauce had so much more flavor than I expected from so few ingredients. I did not have time to make this a couple of days ahead of time so we ate it right out of the oven. I added an hour to the cooking time to ensure the cheeks were very tender. I was only feeding 3 people so I used 2 beef cheeks but doubled the celery and carrots. I also added 6 smashed garlic cloves before putting the pot in the oven. The end result was tender, succulent meat that tasted like braised short ribs (but a whole lot less expensive!). I reduced half of the sauce to serve on top of the meat and served with asparagus and parmesan butternut squash. Dinner got rave reviews. I will definitely make this again!

I made this the first time following the recipe, omitting the final 1.5 teaspoon of salt, and adding several cloves of garlic. The thick silken sauce was intense and deep flavoured. Made the recipe again, except for extra sauce, I added 1 cup chicken broth and 1 cup water to the simmer before braising. I doubled up on the mirepoix (holy trinity of onion, celery, carrot) as well. The sauce (less thick and great for spooning over a bed of quinoa or couscous) was just as intense and delicious this time around. I would make this again with an extra pound or so of cheeks to fill my 8 quart dutch oven and braise it an extra hour, for lots of leftovers.

I have eaten beef cheeks in some quality restaurants in northern Spain and in Ireland in the past year and without a doubt, the result after following this recipe was equally as good. The meat was so tender, you could eat it with a spoon. Two small amendments: I added some garlic gloves to the sauce just before I put it into the oven; and I strained the stew in muslin and reduced it down in to a sumptious, syrupy deeply-flavoured sauce. Wonderful.

Made this with more than the recommended amount of salt & pepper when browning: both course ground. And the canned whole tomatoes included the chilies - Mex style. Had a very little tang and the cheeks were melt-in-your-mouth good.

I was surprised at the lack of garlic, so I added 6 small cloves, chopped, and also a teaspoon of crushed red pepper. The heat was perfect -- just a touch to really intensify the overall flavor. Truly a fantastic recipe.

I first had cheeks in a nice restaurant in The Netherlands and have been looking for cheeks ever since. I also found them at Walmart. This recipe is outstanding and can be prepared on the stove top. Goes well with polenta and potatoes (mashed or boiled). The sauce is sublime.

This is becoming a favorite in our household. Most recently, I added chantrelles just before putting it in the oven--they were a great addition. I often use less meat than is called for, but always the same amount of liquid which can stand on its own as a thick stew.

We used Wagyu beef cheeks for this recipe and it was splendid. I think we would have licked our plates clean if it wouldn't have been so rude! We will be making this again.

Lobster was once considered to be trash. Try this recipe and you will understand that this "trash" cut of beef is the new lobster. The hard part: finding a place to buy the beef cheeks.

We were glad for the advice to order the meat ahead from the butcher, as in the fall apparently beef cheeks go quite quickly. Be sure and order beef cheeks, as we nearly ended up with veal cheeks (which are apparently more popular). We had them cut smaller than the recipe called for, so we served two cheeks to a person (at about 4oz each). This was plenty of food BTW as the broth thickened and was very much enjoyed with a slice of a warm baguette (to scoop up the thick liquid). We cooked this a day ahead and left it in the refrigerator (which is nice to be able to do when cooking for the group), and served in bowls. We served, on a small side plate, the Tuscan Kale (whose recipe we found here as well). It was a huge hit--very rustic and tasty meal. True comfort food. I know I will be making this again and again!

This was simple to make and was absolutely great. We had been having beef cheeks, pork cheeks and veal cheeks in France and this turned out exactly like what we had eaten over there.

I served this for a Sunday night dinner party and it was a HUGE hit. I purchsed the cheeks from The Healthy Butcher on Queen Street if you are a Toronto resident - they remove all the fat and are a dream to work with. I made the dish a day-and-a-half in advance, and when it came time to reheat I used a methid that Molly Stevens employs in her wonderful All About Braising cookbook (James Beard winner!). I took the cheeks out of the braising liquid (more sauce than liquid actually) and reheated the braising liquid on the stovetop. I added a bit of beef broth to the sauce to thin it out a little. I cut the cheeks into slices across the grain, spooned a little sauce in the bottom of a shallow le Creuset serving dish, lay the sliced cheeks in the dish and poured the rest of the sauce over the meat. I reheated them for 20 minutes in a 300 degree oven. I served the cheeks with green beans, and an amazing celery root and apple puree from the New Way to Cook book by Sally Schneider. This is a definite keeper recipe. The cheeks are economical, and they really are the most tender cut of beef I have served. Gorgeous!!

This recipe is GREAT. And guess where I found Beef Cheeks? The Wal-Mart Super Center!! It was in the Meat Dept. in the Mexican Food Section. I have also gotten Beef Cheeks from my butcher.

This is one of my all time, tried and true faves. I substitute beef stew meat for the beef cheeks and serve over either polenta or noodles. Everyone for whom I've made it has raved!

This has become my favorite comfort food dish. It is delicious, economical, and easy to prepare. It turns out just as nicely in a pressure cooker as it does braising in the oven. The poster that recommended cleaning the fat from the cheeks is in error. Leave all the fat and connective tissue on. Just cook them a day or two before you plan on serving them and remove the congealed fat prior to reheating. The meat will be more tender and succulent than if you remove the fat prior to cooking. Bonus: the flavor becomes even better after a day or two making this a wonderful dish for a winter supper party.

This gets the extra final fork just for the long way it had to go from what I bought and trimmed to the bits of heaven I ended up eating...by far the tenderest meat I have ever had. (I added some chuck to the pot just to use it up, so I could compare right there. The cheeks were WAY more "melting.") The trimming was a bit gross and messy, but the sauce and cooking was a snap; braised it, let it sit for two days, then just reheated and ate. (It was educational, too; get the whole fresh cheeks -available here at the evil wal-mart only,- and not the frozen bricks some ethnic butchers have on hand. But hurry...like flank and osso buco, this cheap cut will probably become chic, pun neither intended nor original, and expensive soon.) Give it a try, for the taste and texture (and price!) should really win you over.

This recipe has become one of my favorites. I usually make it with beef tips rather than beef cheeks and it's equally as delicious. The meat literally falls off the fork it's so tender.

Hmmmm...well, we were downsized in the tech depression and have started a business. Meanwhile, we're watching our money (dwindle) and enjoying using recipes that would cost us a mint to try in a restaurant. (The business is doing well but it needs more money than it generates at this point.) Wal-Mart had a sale on beef cheeks, I'd just read some reviews on beef cheeks recipes and just couldn't resist. This is a fabulous Italian style potroast with some of the best flavored and buttery-textured beef you'll ever try. Downside -- you need to really clean the fat off these cheeks if you get the $0.79 cent per pound Wal-Mart special. There are connective tissues in the cheeks that break down into this fabulous gelatin but eat them hot or warm. The gelatin feels a little gluey when it cools. Great way to expand your horizons, I will make it again in different variations. Next time will probably get into mushrooms and artichoke bottoms plus a marinade before braising.

I will be trying this soon. I have found beef cheeks, even in Iowa and have been wanting a recipe.

I have not tried this recipe,but did have veal cheeks in San Francisco,after being talked into it by the waiter. It was the most tender and delicious entre I have ever eaten. I will try it.
