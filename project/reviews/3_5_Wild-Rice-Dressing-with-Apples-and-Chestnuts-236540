I've made this a couple times, and I won't make it again without making some significant changes. First, make sure the sausage is good quality, and I recommend starting it before the onions so it browns properly. Also, a flavorful chicken stock is a must. Be generous with herbs and salt, and then you'll be in good shape. I felt that mine was bland and overly nutty-tasting. The chestnuts are wonderful, but they needed more of a counterpoint I thought. Will probably make again, but might mix and match with other wild rice recipes.

This was a big surprise for me when it came out of the oven. I was expecting a good recipe, but not an amazing one, I just love it! The combination of the sausage, apple, chestnut and the rice... it's just perfect. I can't wait to make it again.

As always, it came out completely fabulous. The soft tender chestnuts paired with the nutty bite of the wild rice blends so well with the apples and sausage. This recipe is the quintessential autumnal go-to meal. I made it for the third time this evening and couldn't wait to add those ingredients to my shopping list once more.

I was extremely disappointed in this recipe. The dish was incredibly time consuming and the end result was one step from inedible. I will be interested to see if anyone has a better outcome.
