These tartlets were Wonderful! Excellent tasting pastry and nice, subtle orange flavor that blended very well with the raspberries. Easy, too. No need to roll out the pastry. I was worried that the dough was too sticky, but it was fine after chilling it for an hour. Also, aside from the raspberries, all the ingredients are something you probably already have on hand. These tartlets also look great. Would definitely recommend.

I have not made this recipe, but looking at the ingredients I would suggest a change. Every orange curd recipe I have ever made has half orange juice and half lemon juice. It will make the flavor stronger.
