This was amazingly good. I made it just as directed. Both my father (not an adventurous eater) and I (a very adventurous eater) loved it. I'm definitely adding it into my regular repertoire.

Good flavor but too greasy. I should have drained the fat that cooked out of the beef before proceeding.

I am vegetarian, so I substituted textured vegetable protein for the ground beef. This required the addition of a little more water when it started to stick to the pan, but otherwise, it cooked similarly. We do not have the fermented black beans in any of our local stores, so I had to omit those. All the same, it was very good. I would enjoy it either at its current level of spice or spicier.

Wonderfully easy and surprisingly scrumptous. Used ground turkey instead of beef. All three of my kids had their plates EMPTY (which is a four fork indication) and even my husband gave the nod of genuine approval. Will add this to our family favorites and consider it a staple for sure. (double on the sauces like other reviewers mentioned)

Quick & painless preparation, unique, and very flavourful. I recommend this dish without hesitation. As with many Asian-esque stir-fry dishes, doubling the sauce never hurts and gives way for the addition of other vegetables like Bok Choy, Brocolli, etc... One caution: use the leanest of ground beef or prepare to drain off some of the fat before adding any other ingredients...

I've made this recipe at least 10 times -- it's my 7 year-old son's favorite dish. Like the other reviewer, I've used green onions in lieu of leeks, but leeks are definitely preferable. I also frequently double the tofu (two packages) and add a mess of frozen peas. If you don't have the peppercorns, you can make do (but they're pretty easy to pick up in any city's Chinatown). And for heat, you can also add chile sauce when you mix the bean sauce. It's delicious!

I agree with the suggestions made by the Cook from Brooklyn...increasing the amount of bean sauce, soy sauce, and the heat factor. I used a Szechwan seasoning available from McCormick. Our local Publix (where shopping is a challenge) has decided not to carry leeks, so I used green onions instead. My Fair Maiden said she thought the green onions worked just fine since she is not fond of leeks anyway. According to the FM, this is a "have again."

This is a really great recipe for Ma Po Tofu flavor-wise, but I think it goes a little too easy on the chili and soy sauces. I would increase the amount of chili bean paste (do-ban jiang) and soy sauce to at least a tablespoon each, and since Ma Po Tofu is supposed to be mouth-searingly spicy, I'd throw a whole dried red chili (or two) in there too.
