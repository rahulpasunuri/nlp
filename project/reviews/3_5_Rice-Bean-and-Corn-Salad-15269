This was really good. Followed earlier suggestions and doubled cumin + coriander, and quickly sauteed garlic + onion before adding water. Recommend adding some heat, such as dash of cayenne.

Great summer recipe - paired it with a cuban pork tenderloin. As much as I claim to dislike recipe alterers... I doubled the cumin and used ground coriander (doubled) as well as twice the amount of corn (Trader Joe's fire roasted - frozen). Also added a tiny bit of chipotle powder. Huge hit and sooooo healthy!

Lovely side dish, super easy and very tasty. Easy to zing it up a bit with an extra dash of lime or seasoning. Super fresh!

Every time I make this someone asks me for the recipe. I have to admit I don't measure all the spices and I use a lot of lime.

what a simple and yummy recipe! I made as a side to soft tacos with the following changes: -used instant brown rice (from trader joes) -sauted the onion and garlic together in a little olive oil and poured over mixture - didn't use coriander because i didnt have it. This was so good! Am having leftovers for lunch today topped with some homemade avocado/tomato salsa. Yum!!!

We added an extra ear of corn and additional spices (cumin, etc.) to make more of a Spanish or yellow rice. Would definitely make again ... even the picky eater at the table asked for seconds!

I've made this recipe several times now, and I think I've got the necessary changes to make it an excellent recipe: Double the cumin, coriander, and salt. Saute cumin, coriander, garlic and onions in 1 t olive oil before adding rice for extra flavor. Add finely diced red or green bell peppers with corn for color and extra flavor. Finally, frozen or canned corn works fine if corn-on-the-cob is not in season or not of high quality.

I think this is a great simple salad that combines rice, bean and corn well. Don't expect anything too fancy.

I thought this was pretty good. I used instant brown rice to speed up the cooking time and added extra spices (cumin, chili powder). Would be good warm too.

I had such high hopes for this recipe, and followed the advice of others to heavily doctor with cumin, red pepper, etc. The texture was comforting alongside beef tacos, but I'm afraid the salad was just too bland. It looks delicious, but my husband and I both thought the taste to be a disappointment. It is easy, though.

Very good and very simple. But it is nothing fancy - sometimes I think people in here expect to be blown away by recipes. This is very much what you expect - a nice combination of rice, corn, and beans and an easy way to prepare them. A good starch alternative. Relax and enjoy!

After making this, the 96% "would make it again" rating was surprising. It wasn't HORRIBLE, but I followed the receipe exactly and just found it kind of bland.

I make this simple salad frequently because it comes together so quickly and has a nice fresh taste. Usually, I add red peppers and avocado and sometimes a little grated cheese--mild white cheddar or queso blanco.

I've made this several time for a nice lunch. I also added diced red bell pepper for color and crunch. I've also substituted parsley for the cilantro the the result is fine. However, I prefer the cilantro.

Made this an easy, yummy meal by pan searing shrimp coated in a spicy southwestern seasoning (BAM) and adding to the salad before serving. It was a big hit at our *Spicy* Christmas Eve Buffet.

This tasted so good that I made it three more times in a two weeks. I made burritos and put this in as filling with black beans, avocado and sour cream. This is a must have.

Tasty, refreshing and simple. Like many others I added chopped red pepper for color (if the original recipe would have included it, I would have rated it 4 forks!). This is a very forgiving recipe...I've made this salad using both leftover corn on the cob and leftover rice (just add the seasonings to the rice with about 1 Tb. water and reheat before adding the corn), and have also tinkered with the proportions of corn, rice and beans according to my mood with no ill effects.

Great recipe! Used it as a side dish for a Mexican theme party and added some tomatoes for garnish. I 3x the receipt for a party of 12 but didn't triple all ingredient amounts: still used 1 onion and 3 tbls of cilantro.

Yummy. Served as a side dish to grilled salmon -- it was very festive and fun. I added red pepper, which made the dish look very appetizing, and a tablespoon of olive oil. I also inadvertently forgot to grind up the coriander seeds, and I kind of liked chomping into them.

this is a good side dish especially for a Mexican meal. However, it is kind of blah looking. I would add a red pepper (as another reviewer has suggested) for both color and added oomph.

Tasty, simple, everything right with this one! I used canned white shoepeg corn, it was fine, and made it easy to have all the ingredients around.

This salad is sensational! I added chickpeas to the mix and only used half a clove of garlic. The flavor was still intense and delicious. My roommates used it as a dip for tortilla chips. Any way you eat it, this salad will be a sucess!

Very good! I used frozen corn--anxious to try fresh. Next time, I'm going to use toasted & ground cumin & coriander seeds. I also made the night before & brought to room temp.

For the amount of effort this takes, this is a delicious dish!! My dad and I came home late from work and were both incredibly tired, almost ready to just pop a frozen pizza in the oven. Since we're trying be more healthy, I instead did a quick search and found this recipe promising to be ready in 45 minutes or less. They don't lie! I tend to be a slow cook but this was ready in no time. I made a few mistakes.. I added the corn before everything, I used twice the amount of rice (thus twice the water), ommitted the lime because I didn't have any on hand, and mistakenly opened a can of black bean soup, which turned out great anyway. This may sound odd, but we added a little sushi vinegar and found it tastes wonderful. We were both glad we went for this and not the pizza!

Yum! I did make it with converted rice & it was perfect. I roasted a red pepper & added for flavor & color. Excellent! If you don't have fresh corn in season, use the vacuum-packed yellow & white Niblets.

This is very tastey, simple dish. Because I am a dietitian, I switched up to brown rice. Sure, it takes longer- but it is much better for you and adds more flavor. Cook the brown rice for 50 minutes (or get instant brown). Saute the onions for 3 min, add in the cooked rice, and complete the recipe as above.

What a great dish - subtle flavours that truly reminds one of southa merican cuisine!!

Great recipe for a hot day. I used converted rice which worked fine. I also goofed and put the corn in first instead of last. Still was great. Served it warm with stone ground corn tortillas and salsa. Really easy. Really healthy. Really tasty.

This tastes great - I have made it many times and everyone loves it. Try adding a bit more cumin and garlic. I also serve it hot.

Yum! Made this for a picnic (doubling it) and it was great. My rice (I used Texmati) came out stickier and soggier than I would have liked, but I used canned corn and may not have drained it well enough. I also added chopped red bell pepper for garnish and it added yummy color and taste. Loved the flavor of the rice, although I could not find ground coriander seeds and instead crushed whole seeds. I will definitely make this again - after all, it's a complete protein and low in fat! It was a hit with the hubby as well.

This dish is delicious and easy to make. The fresh corn makes it and is a great summer salad for a picnic since you don't have to worry about it spoiling.
