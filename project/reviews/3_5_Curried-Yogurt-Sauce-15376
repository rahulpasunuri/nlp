Excellent sauce. Followed recipe exactly. Have used this as a dressing for cold poached chicken salad. People love this sauce.

This is a fabulous sauce. Try it with the Bombay Turkey Burgers on this site.

I am not a curry fan but made this for a fondue meal that we were having. I loved it so much that not only did I forgo my beloved bernaise for this sauce but I have also dreamed about it every night since. Tonight I am having this sauce with barbeque chicken thighs and I can almost taste it now. YUMMM

Fantastic -- this sauce along with the cucumber horseradish sauce also on this site and cold or room tempurature sliced tenderloin make a wonderful prepare-ahead buffet dinner. I make this with substantially more magno chutney and curry powder than called for in the recipe.
