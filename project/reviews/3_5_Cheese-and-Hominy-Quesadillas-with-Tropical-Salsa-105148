@dlwofford ... butter?

This recipe is always a big hit with family and friends. I found the salsa to be a great balance for the quesadillas and if you use a fresh pineapple for the salsa you can use the bottom half of the pineapple to serve it. Also, I've found it helpful to run the hominy through the processor prior to assembling the quesadillas so that they don't pop during frying.

Really yummy! Although warning: hominy was not easy to find. (And I didn't make the crazy salsa!)

This is a great recipe! I substituted cantalope for the pineapple and added some black beans, but otherwise stayed true to the original. My guests raved about them and several asked for the recipe. Even my husband kept coming back for more, and he is not a big quesadilla fan. Definitely a keeper for this Mountaineer Chef!

I wouldn't make the strange salsa again, but I'd probably make the yummy chesadillas without'em. I just don't think onion goes that great with delicious fruits like mango and pineapple. And adding exotic ingredients like japapeno and cilantro just makes things worse. I'd like to find a good salsa to go with these...Also, I'd never tried yellow hominy before...it's a treat.

My wife and I make this receipe about once a month. Easy, unique and affordable. We used canned crushed pineapple and mangos to simplify. We use a little less onions and instead of butter we use PAM on a onstick pan. Absolutely awesome! We even made it for a dinner party and none were left!

These were a welcome change to the typical quesadilla! I used sundried tomato flour tortillas to enhance the flavor, and served them with the Avocado & Tropical Fruit Salsa (recipe on this site) instead. MAKE THIS ONE!

These were fabulous! I brought them to a friend's house as appetizers--we ate so many of them that we were barely hungry for her great dinner! The salsa is also great on fish and barbequed chicken. I've made this several times to great reviews.

The salsa was wonderful! Makes for a colorful presentation. I had never had hominy, which turned out to be very good. It's a great substitute for corn, not as sweet though. The salsa makes up for it.
