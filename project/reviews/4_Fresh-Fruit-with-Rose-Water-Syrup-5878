This elevates the ordinary to the sublime. Any combo of fruits and berries with some gelato on top and a sprinkle of toasted almonds makes a refreshing and delicious end to any meal.

The rose water was fragrant without being too empowering. It was a pleasant dimension to these everyday fruits. My guests loved it too. I will definitely be making it again soon.

Thank you for the suggestion from: A Cook from Jacksonville, FL to poach pears in this syrup - delicious.......

This is the most delicious syrup I have ever tasted. You can put it on many different kinds of fruit (we had it on orange, grapefruit and papaya last night). If you can find rosewater, definitely give this a try.

This was even better the second day, when all the flavors had a chance to blend a little and the juices from the fruit had mixed with the syrup. I used a quart of strawberries, left out the pear, and I'll add more rose water next time.

You just have to try this - it's amazing. It's one of those recipes that doesn't look that exciting because it's so simple but the combination of cinnamon and rose water is sublime. Fresh, light and delicious. I used pears, oranges, grapefruit and apples and served it with a little creme fraiche but it doesn't need a thing.

Used fresh peaches and strawberries, the syrup is the key. Rosewater makes it smell so good. Added juice of one lemon to prevent browning of peaches.

Wonderful, lite, not too sweet dessert. The rose water gives it that unusual something that everyone loved. Even people who don't consider themselves fruit fans, loved this. Added seedless watermelon as well-very good.

Easy to make; wonderful flavor. Served over sliced pears, this makes a very nice and simple yummy dessert. I want to try poaching pears in this syrup next time.

This recipe is great. I followed the recipe exactly (as I often do the 1st time I'm making a dish). The rose water gives a wonderful flavor and an intoxicating smell.

Just like everyone said: fresh, tasty, and, might I add: healthy. I had 10 different fruits in my salad. There's really no limit. Most of my guests helped themselves to seconds. I served this fruit salad at a buffet dinner, along with vanilla ice cream and sponge cake.

Oh my gosh -- what a fabulous dish! The aroma alone is intoxicating. I served this at our neighborhood's Memorial Day barbeque and it was quickly devoured. Everyone wanted to know what the unusual flavor was -- and no one guessed that it was roses. I presented this in a lovely wooden bowl and garnished it with sprigs of mint -- it's a great combination. I will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe using pear, raspberries, grapes and nectarines. The flavor was nice, but not overpowering. This was served as a dessert after a large Greek dinner and was a nice, light way to end the meal.

De-lish! Easy and so tasty. I used fresh strawberries and some thawed frozen blackberries and raspberries. Served it over angel food cake w/ a bit of whipped cream. YUM-O-LA!

I made this as a dessert for a North African themed dinner party. It was thoroughly enjoyable, but I think that the fruits I used (cantaloupe, mango, strawberries) overwhelmed the flavors of the syrup. Next time I make the recipe, I'm going to increase the rose water and cinnamon and see how that works.

Great recipe! Be careful with the rosewater (can be purchased in specialty stores ... I got mine at a bulk food store near the spices) ... if you add too much (as I did the 2nd time I made it) it overpowers the syrup. Also, a few too many grapes. Finally, this keeps for at least 3 days (great leftovers!).

I make this quite often, it's the best fruit salad I've ever had. Most recipes cover up the taste of the fruit, the rose water compliments it well while letting the taste show through. Rose water is available in the Arabic section of the grocery store.

I sprinkled the dishes with edible rose petals and mint leaves and then put the fruit on top. It was delicious. Great Brunch dish after Golf or Tennis.

This is a great recipe. For a different twist, boil a star anise with the syrup. This is great in the winter.

The syrup has a very sutble flavour. I used fresh fruit in season: Honeydew, Cantalope and Oranges.

I agree with the previous review - it tasted fresh and light - neither the rosewater or the sugar were too strong. Got many compliments!

The sugar syrup was not overpowering, and I'm usually a big proponent of fruit served without sweeteners. However, this was a nice, light variation.

I used this fruit mix to fill phyllo-dough cups (I put a bit more of rose water for stronger flavor). Works beautifully.
