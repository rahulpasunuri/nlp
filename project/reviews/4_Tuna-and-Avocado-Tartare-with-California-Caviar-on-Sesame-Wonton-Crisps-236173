Great Tartare! I added some chopped granny smith apples and plated with a layer of tartare, a thin layer of Tobiko ( flying fish roe), and finished with a top layer of tartare then drizzled soy sauce on top. Have already made this twice in the last 3 weeks and will be making it again soon.

I added 1/2 cup thawed edamame and tossed with the veggies and dressing. I reserved the tuna so it did not discolor. I plated it by spooning the veggies into a biscuit cutter followed by a layer of tuna. I wish I had diced mango for a third layer. I slid the biscuit cutter off the tower and added a few wontons around the tower. It made very delicious, pretty appetizers.

they have this at one of my fav restaurants. they just put the soy on the side to combat that turning color problem...oh and the sesame seed crackers are an excellent short cut. work smarter not harder. one of my fav recipes.

The tuna was very tasty, but I was very disappointed with how it looked. Once one adds the soy sauce mixture, it turns the lovely pink tuna flesh into an awful grey color. I used just fraction of the sauce and waited to the last possible moment to dress the fish. It was not very appetizing. I would not make it again with the soy, but will try with some other acid. Also instead of wontons, sesame seed rice crackers are a good shortcut.

Gee I hate to dash the recipe rating but I thought it was 3, my husband stopped eating after 1 crisp, so I split the difference. Followed the recipe exactly. It was sort of bland. To get to my 3 I added more wasabi, salt and soy as well as additional vinegar. After those changes I did think it was tasty. I didn't care for the ugly brown the soy added but if it had tasted fantastic I would have forgiven that. I will try this again but with some adjustments. Lime rather than lemon, possibly ponzu rather than soy, more vinegar, more salt. I think this has real possibilities but tonight's just didn't live up to what I am sure are these ingredient's potential.

I took this to a dinner party last week and it was quite a hit. I marinated the tuna in the sauce for several hours and added the remaining ingredients just before serving. Everyone agreed that the avocado really took this appetizer over the top. I thought the crisps were just so-so. I preferred the tartare with pita crisps. This is definitely something I will make again and again.

Love this receipeand always get raves. I simplify by using either rice crachers or file cups instead of the won ton wrappers. Also, our local Japanese seafood store will dice the tuna. Finally, I find that it is better made several hours ahead (or even overnight) to allow the flavors to blend

My guests (and I) loved it! Very easy to make. Lots of flavor. Don't skip the won tons! They were easy to make and my guests really liked them. They don't take away from the tuna at all. I skipped the caviar as well. The only thing I'd change next time is to dial up the heat and add more wasabi. I didn't find the amount of soy too salty at all. Everyone ate it right up!

Excellent recipe...fast and easy and absolutely delicious. I used Wasabi powder, instead of paste and withheld the caviar. I also brushed the wontons with sesame oil, instead of olive. Phenomenal recipe!! Will definitely be a favorite in my household

This tartare is FABULOUS!!! I thought wontons would take away from the tender and delicate tuna and avocado so I just served it with water crackers. I did not have chives or green onions while I did not think I missed them, I will add them next time. I have added a little ginger for extra kick. Also if you like spicy you may want to add more wasabi. Finally, I have paired it with sparkling rose which complemented this dish perfectly! I got a lot of praise for this tartare and can not wait to make it again!

This is absolutely the best tartare recipe. of course you have to tweak to suit your own taste, but I have had people swooning with mine. I add more wasabi, skip the caviar, double the wontons. Everyone has different taste, but the main theme of this recipe is amazing.

A very good tartar recipe, but not yet excellent. It's almost more like Hawaiian poke. I don't like wasabi so I replaced it with Korean hot pepper flakes. I also used lime instead of lemon. Finally, I didn't like the powdery aftertaste on the won ton skins so I had to wipe the cornstarch off each skin before spritzing with Pam olive oil. Time consuming but tasted much better.

This is good, but it tastes too much of soy. I added a 1/4 t of ground fresh ginger to cut the salt. The brown color is a problem, also stemming from the soy. I found a recipe from Eric Ripert that avoids the brown stuff altogether. Going to try that next time.

This is fast, fresh, and healthy. I've made it in 2 countries... and ALWAYS a hit!

This is such a crowd pleaser! I serve with prepared ginger on the side (like the kind at sushi bars) that really adds to this dish. It gets a bit soupy, so when serving on the wontons, use a slotted spoon. You still get great flavor. An easy trick is to prepare all ingredients first then refrigerate, then add fish at the last minute.

I love making this without the wontons and the caviar, and instead serving it on spoons as hors d'oeuvres. I made it for a dinner party we hosted last night and even a friend who isn't really fond of anything fishy thought it was great!

Everyone loves this! No one touched the caviar, I don't use it anymore. I use a touch more wasabi to give it a bit more spice.

I found this marinade to be too sour. To correct, I took soy sauce and sugar, simmered a bit to reduce, added some sesame oil. I had this on side to drizzle over if desired. It definitely balanced this dish for me and I might find a way to adjust marinade next time (or do this again). For the wontons, I oiled sheet instead of parchment and it worked great.

This came out incredible. Everybody loved it and asked for recipe. Thought the wonton wrappers would be hard to work with but were not. Just had to be carefull because I burned a whole batch. They cook very quickly.

My daughter and I made this recipe as a tester for her graduation party. We loved it and so did the other taste testers! We added fresh ginger to the sauce and kicked up the wasabi. We soaked the tuna cubes in the sauce for 30 minutes and prepped the other ingredients and tossed with a small amount of vinegar to keep the fresh color. Just before serving we drained the sauce from the fish and tossed everything together. For us this was the best way to preserve all the colors in the dish and the tuna had the most amazing flavor after soaking in the sauce. We are making this again!

Evn though I used lemon water on the avocado to start, once you mix it with the soy sauce, the color is a little odd. I think this is what kept people away from it at the wine tasting event I took it to. No matter - it was absolutely delicious, so what didn't get eaten there went home with me for dinner. YUM!

Really nice recipe. Great presentation ideas. For added flair, I highly recommend using a chef's ring. It turns out gorgeous!

I made this both with and without the cucumber and don't think the cucumber really makes much difference. The (toasted) pine nuts suggested by another reviewer add a great flavor and crunch to the dish. I did not have any caviar and don't see much reason to add it - the dish is great without it. To address the appearance issue mentioned by another reviewer, I cut the avocado and immediately put it in diluted lemon juice. I drained it before adding the avocado to the dish. I made the dish for myself tonight and it's debatable whether it will last long enough to turn another color.

To make this a main entree, we served this over aliitle sushi rice. The recommended Chardonnay was great, but a CA Gewurtztraminer stands up better to the wasabi.

Very tasty! Everyone enjoyed this quick and easy appetizer. I added some fresh grated ginger and sliced pickled ginger to the sauce and tossed everything together just before guests arrived. Additionally, I used canola cooking spray on the wonton crisps...a lot faster and simpler than brushing the oil.

It's so weird but no one at my party touched this dish! When I made it I thought my guests would go crazy for it. It was hard not to eat it all myself. I loved the flavors. The fish guy was even nice enough to cut the ahi into pieces for me - awwwww. But still, not one person even tried it. So, after thinking about it, I decided that the color was off-putting. The avocado turned it kind of a gray color, so by the time I served it it didn't look that great. It still tasted terrific. In nay case, my advice is if you make this serve it right away as that is when it looks as good as it tastes.

The wonton crisps add alot to the presentation of this dish. I added some pine nuts to the Tartare to give it a bit of bite.

I bought fresh ahi tuna and I thought the dressing overpowered the tuna. I made the won ton crisps which were really good but all the sesame seeds fell off. Next time I would not bother with the seeds.

I made this to the letter for a cocktail party (though I used salmon roe instead of the particular caviar called for). It was a huge hit. Really, everything about it was easy and delicious.

It was delicious. I used about 2/3 of the avocado to keep more of an emphasis on the ahi. I didn't bother with making my own wonton crips and used taro chips from a bag. I might try making the crisps next time.
