Very good dish and my family loved it! However, I too made changes: only used 4 slices of bacon, 6 cloves of garlic, fresh sage (about 1/4 cup and then stirred in more towards end of cooking), 2 eggs, about 3/4 cup cream and 3/4 cup sherry and added more to suit my desired taste. I think I also added a little beef broth I had left over and/or pasta water to thin some. Also added a little crushed red pepper, salt and pepper. This is an easy dish to adjust as you like. For me the sherry made all the difference in adding flavor and went beautifully with the cream and mushrooms).

The fat content of this recipe is extremely high...12 slices of bacon, 1 coup of whipping cream and 4 large egg yolks. This isn't healthy eating. This also yields more than my husband and I want to eat in one meal. I cut the recipe down to serve two people, and, in doing so, I cut the bacon to two slices and replaced the heavy cream with milk. In stead of tortellini, I used whole grain pasta. It was delicious and much healthier for us. Calculate the fat grams in the original recipe and you will be astonished!

Very good - I would recommend using 1/2 of the mushrooms listed.

My husband made this for dinner tonight. Yummy! He used proscuitto instead of the bacon, and added baby peas. It's definitely a keeper!

I followed the recipe except that I used fresh sage, only 8 oz. mushroms, 1 cup remaining pasta liquid, and added peas. I partially cooked the pasta liquid, cream, egg mixture before adding the remaining ingredients. I also added cut chicken that I cooked in the extra bacon grease. The one problem with this recipe is that they do not mention the addition of salt and ground pepper which is necessary or it will be very bland!!!

really good.... I added peas and white wine, otherwise made as written. looked for this recipe after having the tortellini carbonara at Carmine's in Chicago, does anyone know how to find their recipe? This, however, was similar and delicious.

Not enough flavor to justify the calories! This needs some fresh herbs, crushed red pepper or something to give a kick.

If you want a rich cheese fix, just make this with Three Cheese Tortellini!!! I made this tonight with the cheese tortellini and used half and half instead of whipping cream. It was so rich and filling that I have tons of leftovers. The recipe definitely makes 6 huge main-course servings. I think one of the other reviewers had the right idea: use spinach tortellini!!! Also, to cut down on the fat, I nuked the whole slices of bacon in paper towels until they crumbled when handled, and used olive oil to sautee the veggies. If I could find spinach tortellini, I would make this dish again. I guess it is all a matter of perception, but I didn't find this dish as quick to make as the recipe would lead you to believe. To me a quick recipe does not involve all those steps and dirty bowls, a pot and a skillet at the end of preparation.

This sauce was a quick fix diiner at my house. I used proschiutto instead of the bacon which worked out great. My only complaint was that it was a bit eggy, so I wil probably use half the eggs the recipe calls for next time. Overall, good but not great.

This was delicious, but very rich -- definitely a "special occasion" meal for us. We ate lightly the day after and had no guilt. Also, we only used 6 slices of bacon and it was still wonderful. We used spinach tortellini and seasoned generously with salt and pepper. Very tasty!

A good cream sauce. I believe the original carbonara did not call for cream.How about Tortellini alla BONNIE.

Rating: 0
It's a nice cream sauce, but not a Carbonara. It could be better by using Pancetta over bacon. I'm constantly facinated by the corruption of good names because the cook used one or two items from one recipe and then swiped the name to boot.

I agree, this is not a traditional carbonara. But it's a quick look-alike for during the week. I, too, use half and half instead of eggs and cream and it works out great. I thicken it with freshly grated Locatelli if needed. A turn of fresh black pepper is nice, too.

This recipe begins to get to the point but I would up the sage a bit AND the garlic...remember, you are competing with 12 bacon slices!! Also, Julia Child once remarked that she was disgusted with those who, in the name of "low cal or low fat" refused to cook with wonderful ingredients such as butter or cream. She thought these people were missing out on some of life's sublime pleasures by being too rigid. Remember folks, one CAN eat in moderation!

The Original recipe for Pasta Carbonara has absoluetly NO cream at all. The sauce consists of lardons of pancetta, sauted in olive oil, with chopped onions and Marsala. Meanwhile, the pasta is cooked and drained and eggs, beaten with grated Parmesan, are poured over the hot pasta, and tossed, cooking the eggs in the process. Then, the sauted onion - bacon mixture is poured over and tossed through. That's it---No cream. Rich, but not deadly.

this is a heart attack on a fork! Enough calories and fat to sabotage any eating plan. We love pasta, but this is way overboard for us.

To make this dis lighter, use half and half instead of egg yolks and cream. I also use a head of roasted arlic instead of fresh minced...it adds a milder flavor (you can also use a combination of the two).

I have been making a recipe identical to this for about 4 years. The sauce is suppose to be thick and adhere to the pasta - nothing left at the bottom of the bowl. It is rich, but is a great hearty meal during the wintertime.

Tortellini is a cheese based pasta. The recipe calls for egg yolk, whipping cream and more cheese and your suprised it's rich with thick sauce? That's exactly what carbonara sauce is! Yes, put in the bacon.

I, too, found this very rich and heavy. I added all the water, but the sauce was still way too thick. Are you supposed to add back the cooked bacon? I did, at the end, and was glad I had cut back on it a bit. In addition to the problems with the sauce, I feel the combination of flavors did not work very well. Sorry, not a keeper.

This was a very rich dish. I ended up adding quite a bit of water to the sauce because it wasn't enough- maybe it was because it was on the stove longer though and it sucked up a lot of the sauce.
