Excellent w/few changes which I think improved flavor: minced garlic, made Wolfgang Puck's pizza dough, mixed cheeses mozzarella 5oz, Fontina 2 oz, Parmesan 1 oz. omitted olive oil in salad. Fontina adds a creamy texture to cheese and Parmesan-topped edges of crust is delicious. Definitely broil veggies rather than pan sear. Plus I baked in pan on pre-heated pizza stone which make a nice crusty bottom. Excellent!

I only roasted the veggies for this, then used another pizza dough recipe. I thought the roasting times and vegetable combos were pretty spot on.

This was such a surprise! I make pizza nearly every Sunday night, and this recipe has been on my to-do list for a long, long time. Somehow, salad on top of a pizza didn't sound like it should work - I was so wrong! I followed the recipe for the roasted vegetables to the letter, used my own homemade pizza dough and baked it on a perforated pizza pan (the best for a crisp crust). When finished, I sliced it and toped it with mixed greens and slivered red onion, lightly dressed in balsamic only, no oil. It was a huge hit! I'll definitely be adding it to the Sunday-Pizza rotation.

great pizza! Used only 1 squash and it seemed like plenty, sauteed the salad a little to wilt it. Maybe a little too wet. Overall a nice filling healthy pizza!

I've always loved salad-topped pizza. Not only does this recipe taste divine, it actually is healthy! The balsamic dressing works so well with the pizza. Yum!

Delicious! Pretty much made as-is, but used arugula instead of mixed greens on top, and added fresh garlic to my roasted veggies.
