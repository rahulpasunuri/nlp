Delicious and easy. Used a mandoline to cut the potatoes thin. Made for Thanksgiving. Definitely will make again.

I'm not saying it's a bad dish, after all I have made it for two holiday meals, but it's just not the rich, cheesey dish that I want from a gratin. Love that it's so simple and quick but I'll probably try another recipe next time.

This is a truly delicious and easy to make recipe ( despite the feeling in the pit of my stomach when using a mandolin for the potatoes). I made it twice over the holiday season and the second time I only had about 8 hours after mixing the whipping cream and the buttermilk and it was still great. I tried it with Herbes de Provence between the layers and also without and both versions were good.

I would not make this again. I followed the recipe exactly, it was just ok not outstanding for the added expense of the gruyere cheese.

Excellent and quite easy version of potatoes au gratin. Watch the salt, however (as in "sprinkle generously with salt..."); one taster thought I added way too much salt, but everyone else gobbled them up. I am considering trying this in my crock pot, as a way to save oven space when roasting the main course - especially if different temperatures are needed, anyone ever try this in a crock pot?

This is the exactly the recipe I have looked all over for, the others were far too complicated. Many years ago, my family hosted a French girl as part of a cultural program. She made us a fabulous dinner with her favorite dishes. She made this and a very beautiful ratatouille. She made it exactly like this. Can't wait to try it!

This is a wonderful and tasty recipe. When I made it, I used sour cream and added some whipping cream to lighten it. Then followed the recipe. Delicious! The second time I made this, instead of putting it together like the recipe stated, I first sliced and boiled the potatoes to firmly done, and then folded in the sour/whipping cream combination and half the gruyere cheese, and then spooned the potato mixture into a baking dish, sprinkled the other half the gruyere over the top and baked for about 20 minutes at 375 til browned. I preferred this way better.

So simple and delicious. I used sour cream which I had on hand, loosened with a little whipping cream, instead of creme fraiche. Also added some herbs de Provence for herb flavor. would also be good with a little sauteed leek or shallot.

I had a fondue party.... and had leftover Gruyere cheese. I made these gratin potatoes... and they are amazingly delicious!

Four forks for ease and taste. I'm too cheap to buy creme fraiche and not good enough at planning ahead to make it, so I made this last night using nonfat sour cream, thinned a tiny bit with some milk. I used more than the recipe called for, maybe 2 1/2 cups in all, but it seemed necessary in order to smear it over the potato layer. I sprinkled on some herbes de Provence and for cheese, I used Jarlesburg, because that's what was in the fridge. It was not the least bit greasy or oily, despite my leaving it in the oven too long as I was chatting with company and not really paying attention to the time. I will gladly make this again, maybe changing up the herbs for a different taste.

Very good, but I expected more from all the reviews. Guests were pleased. The creme fraiche added a very thick sour cream taste and consistency. Baked it at 350, covered for 1 hour, uncovered for 30 min to brown top.

Received rave reviews on Christmas Eve with this one. Although there were eleven people (and two of my children only ate this despite the fact that there was food enough to feed at least 20 people) I should have made a double batch! It was delicious and SOOOOOO easy - my favorite kind of recipe!

Rating: 4
This has become a traditional dish at our Christmas dinner table. It's a great side to our stuffed beef tenderloin. I have found that it's very expensive if you have to purchase the creme fraiche, especially if you need to double the recipe. I always make my own following the directions below and it comes out great so don't hesitate to substitute.

This was pretty good, because anything with potatoes, cream and cheese is bound to be decent. However, I thought that the amount of cheese made the dish a bit gummy. I think that there are better gratin recipes out there, and I'm not sure I'll be using this one again.

I made this for dinner last night, exactly as stated except that I stretched it to 4lb potaties and 2 coups each of creme fraiche and gruyere to feed 11. There was enough for 12 plus with a bit left for seconds. It was the best and most simply gratin I have ever had.

Excellent gratin recipe. I altered a touch. I used half yams and half yukons. I added fresh minced thyme, sage, coarse salt and Italian parsley into the mix. I tossed the potatoes in the herbs then followed the rest of the recipe. YUM. WONDERFUL recipe. Was stuffed before it came out of the oven and couldn't resist going back for two more tiny servings. Exquisite. Rare 4 forks rating. Thanks Epicurious and to all those who commented - great ideas!

I had some 1/2-made creme fraiche (I just put store-bought in cream and let it sit for two days and it ferments) and some beemster cheese (a kind of aged gouda.) Was it good? 2 people ate all 8 servings of it. And it couldn't be easier. I sliced the potatoes very thin using a cheap plastic mandoline.

Rating: 4
Amazing. This is very easy to make, and thinly slicing the potatoes was easier to do than I thought. The Gruyere did separate into an oily slick, but it didn't impact the flavor. I guess the cheese was "too high quality" like another reviewer mentioned. I think next time I may try to reduce the heat in the oven to prevent separation.

I have tried many potato gratin recipes, and this one is my family's favorite. It just so happens to be the easiest one to make, so it is a definite keeper! I used Trader Joes creme fraiche, and a bit more cheese than what was called for in the recipe. Other than that, I stuck to the recipe and it wasn't bland at all (a few previous reviews claimed that it was too bland). I recommend this one highly.

I first made this a few years ago for Thanksgiving dinner. It couldn't have been easier and it was an instant hit with a family who never strays far from baked or mashed potatoes.

Now, I've prepared a tater or two in my lifetime, and this is just one of the easiest and tastiest recipes that I've found. I made this last night as a side dish to some prime steaks, and this dish was the hit of the evening. I used the best cheese I could buy, and it probably made a huge difference. I also added some dried herbs, and sliced the potatoes super thin using the food processor. Couldn't be easier or more impressive.

Deadly recipe. And so easy. I used a store- bought fraîche and about 200g of cave-aged Swiss gruyere from Les Amis du Fromage on 2nd & Burrard. I cooked using the recommended pan size and followed the cooking times and my dish turned out superb. No oil separation. Perfect potatoes. I served them w/roasted beets & Zuni's mock porchetta.

I also agree with some others about the dish coming out greasy. I will experiment with a different cheese next time (used a high quality gruyere from Whole Foods) or a different creme fraiche. I was a little disappointed with my results compared to others, but the ingredients of the dish seem promising-- will try again before giving this one up.

Not only is this easy it is just spectacular. Sprinkled pepper and a pinch of nutmeg on each layer. Will make again and again.

O.k. Loved this recipe and so easy... however, there were variations.. I didn't have 3lbs of potatoes and didn't have enough time - I had 1lb so, I put in the microwave for 7 mins (pretty much cooked them thru) sliced them and used 1/2 cup creme fraiche to 1 1/4 cups grated asiago and manchego cheeses - layered and cooked for 15mins at 425 convection - nice a brown and bubbly! so so good! quick and easy - will definitely make again and follow the recipe.

Rating: 4
Just wanted to say thanks to those below whose reviews encouraged me to make the creme fraiche rather than using store-bought - so easy and incredibly good, I will do it every time from now on. A rare 4 fork recipe in my opinion, but thoroughly deserving. My only change I made was to add a sprinkling of freshly grated nutmeg to each layer with the salt and pepper. This will replace my standby potato gratin recipe that has more steps and more ingredients with (slightly) less stellar results. And I had no problems with separation... I've no idea why you'd use anything but the best cave aged cheese you can find.

Rating: 4
I must agree with the Mountain View cook. My experience is using non-aged cheese and alta dena creme frishe will result in absolutely no grease. The higher end creme frishe and aged cheese creates a grease feast!

Rating: 4
Delicious! It was the perfect potato dish for Christmas! Additionally, the separation of the fat is caused by overcooking, not the quality of cheese. When you start to notice little accumulations of fat, you have to take it out of the oven immediately otherwise it will become a puddle of fat...not very appetizing. Hope this helps!

I love the recipe and always prepare over the holidays. To the cook from Chicago: You may have used aged Gruyere. This recipe needs the super market cheese, not gourmet aged. This happened to me as well with the wrong cheese.

What did I do wrong here??? The gruyere and creme fraiche kind of separated and so it was almost as if the potatoes were swimming in butter. Nice crust but way too greasy.

I have to admit I was skeptical since I haven't had much luck with gratins in the past but this recipe is amazing. Using a mandoline to slice the potatoes makes them even & reduces prep time. Great, great potatoes!

The key to making this a flavorful and savory dish is using a good cave- aged gruyere (aged at least 14 months). This is sharp, nutty and aromatic cheese that does not need additional herbs to dress it up. Most US supermarket Gruyere is nothing like the real thing. Look in the specialty cheese case.

Rating: 4
This is really delicious. I ran out of both creme fraiche and gruyere and added mascarpone cheese and parmesan. They worked well, but stick with the others of you have them. The cheese gets deliciously chewy. Don't forget to salt and pepper the layers - they need it.

Wow, very tasty. I made this ahead of time (and let sit at room temperature for about 3 hours) because I needed a different temperature to roast a ham; then I reheated it for about 30 minutes before serving. Very tasty, I will mention that the cheese/cream did separate with reheating. I will try again but would plan to serve shortly after cooking to avoid the separation.

This recipe offers a good guideline for a potato gratin, but it's just not that amazing. I made this for the first time at Christmas dinner and expected fabulous results, based on previous reviews. (Read: I assumed that a preliminary trial wouldn't be necessary, as other reviewers seemed to love this dish.) While everyone *liked* the dish, no one raved. It's pretty bland, but if you're open to adding some additional herbs and spices, it could be improved. Also, a blue cheese or sharp cheddar would give much more flavor than the gruyere. Overall, the gratin is good if you're a safe eater and prefer richness over flavor. If you want something with a lot of flavor, you won't find it here. I suggest baking it in a springform pan, this way you get nice wedges instead of a scoop of potato.

For those of you having trouble finding creme fraiche, it is simply a mixture of whipping cream and buttermilk that has been allowed to sit at room temperature for 24 hours. To make the proper amount of creme fraiche for this recipe, combine 1 1/2 cups whipping cream with 3 Tablespoons of buttermilk in a glass jar. Let sit at room temperature (about 70 degrees) for 18-24 hours. Stir, and it is ready to use... or you can refrigerate it and use within 10 days. For my family, this recipe is a little under-spiced ... so I like to perk up the dish by adding a little chopped, fresh garlic and dried rosemary to the sauce before baking, or layering the potatoes with chopped green onion and/or or crispy bacon. If you find that the edges are browning too fast, cover with foil. During the last 10 mins. of cooking time, you can cut a slit in the top of the foil and peel it back to expose the middle part of the casserole, or remove the foil entirely (depending on how much the edges have already browned)

Rating: 4
So simple and so good! I took the advice of others and soaked the potatoes and had no discoloration. Then tossed all of the potatoes with creme fraiche. Layered half of the tossed potatoes and half of the cheese. Then repeated. Even the picky kids loved them. Will make any time!

A fammily favorite. We make lots and leftovers re-heat well. To speed it up. partially cook potato slices in microwave. Trader Joe's carries creme fraiche. Another way to make creme fraiche is to whisk 50% sour cream and 50% heavy cream and let sit (covered) at room temp 12 hours (until thickened). Will keep 7-10 days.

I tried making this several years ago and it didn't work out well, mainly because I put too few potatoes and the cheese/cream mixture took over. I tried it again correcting that problem, adding fresh thyme, substituting sour cream mixed with a little heavy cream for creme fraiche (can't find it ANYWHERE), and making it in a 10" tart pan. It came out great! I used the tart pan to serve a smaller crowd and the presentation is very pretty. Flavors are strong and good. The thyme adds a lot, go for it. Glad I gave it a second try. Lots of salt and pepper, and letting it rest before serving, are the keys to success. And lots of potatoes!

This is a follow-up to my previous review of this dish. Since my original review I have made this dish many times and tried several variations. None measure up to the simpliity of the recipe as originally written. I tried using "Simply Potatoes" prepared potatoes, also a mistake. Use fresh potatoes, creme fraiche and the best gruyere you can afford, salt, pepper and parsley. Nothing more is needed.

Simply delicious. I followed the recipe exactly although I left the potatoes un-peeled for a more rustic dish. Certainly one of the best potato dishes I have ever eaten. The possible variations are endless. Chopped onions, roasted garlic, chopped onion & jalapeno, crumbled bacon, wild mushrooms would all be excellent additions. Also, for those who have a problem with the sliced potatoes turning black, slice them into a bowl of cold water. When ready to assemble the dish, drain and pat dry. Can be held several hours this way.

Didn't have time to run around trying to find creme fraiche, so substituted entirely with sour cream. Also used a beautiful Compte from France instead of Gruyere and it turned out perfectly, if just a touch too sour. Can't wait to try it again with the creme fraiche and perhaps with the addition of roasted garlic and/or onions as others have suggested.

I was disappointed in this dish, although some of the guests at my Christmas Eve dinner raved about it! The flavor was good (loved the gruyere, homemade creme fraiche) but the potatoes did turn grey in the two hours that it sat in the fridge after assembly, despite tossing the potatoes in the creme fraiche immediately after slicing. The dish did not cook evenly in my convection oven, leaving undercooked areas in the center (my bad). I'd make it again, just cooking longer and not assembling it way ahead of time.

I tried both versions - the first pan with homemade creme fraiche and gruyere and a little romano pecorino; the second with sour cream and romano pecarino only. The first version won hands down! The creme fraiche texture was MUCH creamier as the sour cream dried out and curdled a bit. The gruyere had wonderful flavor, and I'm not a fan of swiss-type cheeses. The creme fraiche was exceedingly easy to make, you just have to plan ahead a day or two. I set mine on a heating pad and wrapped in a towel to keep it warm for the 24 hours it took to thicken.

Wow, this was fantastic. Everyone raved at the Thanksgiving dinner table. It was super easy to make (with a mandoline) and even though it was a bit pricey, it was worth it. I bought the creme fraiche and Gruyere at Whole Foods - I don't know if you can get these ingredients at your regular grocer. I agree with the other reviewers - it's quite rich so you don't need a lot. But the leftovers were really good too so it's tempting to make more :-) Oh, I did take the advice of another cook and just tossed the potatoes in the creme faiche and then layered them with the cheese. This seems easier and more even. Enjoy!

I made this instead of mashed potatoes for Thanksgiving. Well, goodbye mashed potatoes! it was great! One note, I had 10 people for dinner and so did increased the recipe by half, making 2 pans. Not necessary. Although people raved I still had leftovers from the first pan. This is a rather rich dish, so if you are having a lot of side dishes, just the regular recipe as is is more than enough for 10 and would probably feed 12.

I basically substituted everything in this recipe with something else, but if you follow the format you'll get delicious results.

If you have some good Parmigiano-Reggiano in the house, it's absolutely incredible as a stand in for the Gruyere. Similarly, since creme fraiche usually comes in 8 oz. countainers, I've made up the difference with whipping cream and the flavor and texture are still perfect.

Outstanding! I followed the recipe without any changes or substitution. It was very easy to make and took only a few minutes for preparation step. To prevent the potatoes from turning dark, I peeled the potatoes and placed them in cold water, removed half of them and pat dry, then sliced and proceded with the seasonings before I removed the remaining potatoes and repeated the process. I also use madoline for slicing. This is the one gadget that is a must have if you do a lot of slicing. It cut things into absolutely neat and even slices as quick as you can move your hand. There are many madolines out there ranges from $9.99 to around $200. Watch your fingers though!!

this was so good, it completely overshadowed the other dishes served at dinner. I took a previous reviewers suggestion of sour cream/heavy cream instead of creme fraiche. I also layered in sliced onion between potatoes. Couldn't find gruyere, so used rennet-less extra sharp cheddar. Loved it!

By the way, I did add a bit of satueed vidalia onion and garlic to add some flavor as others had suggested.

I thought these potatoes were very tasty because I love gruyere. The only thing is, you have to work very fast to keep the potatoes from turning black.

Woah! So disgustingly good, it is shamefull!!! I did as some of the others and used sour cream (worked great!). I also satueed some onions and garlic and added to my layers. To you inexperienced, move fast because the potatoes turn dark! Maybe this was the best because I love gruyere, don't know, but YUM!!!!

We're not really a potato eating family so when asked to bring a potato dish to our family Passover dinner I was stumped. Found this recipe and it was simple, straight forward and very good. I want to try it again using sliced zuchini or mushrooms and asparagus instead of the potatoes.

Absolutely amazing! Made for many family gatherings and it was gone in seconds. Careful though.. very rich!

After pouring through pages of au gratin recipes this one seemed to receive the best reviews... and, it was fabulous. I doubled the recipe for 8 people and the plate was clean! My dinner guests went home with the recipe in hand. This recipe is easy and tastes like you spent hours making it. This one is a keeper.

This is so easy and tasty. I have made it as written and made it with heavy cream when I didn't want to buy buttermilk for three tablespoons. Each time it has been a hit. Most recently, I warmed the heavy cream with a little fresh ground nutmeg and a half an onion in it. I removed the onion, let it cool and poured it over the assembled gratin.

I have made this as directed and altered it for different tastes. I've made it with cheddar cheese and I've mixed sour cream with heavy cream in place of the creme fraiche. I can't tell any real difference and it's by far the best au gratin recipe I've ever tried. I've made this recipe a number of times and everyone has always loved it, even with my modifications.

Decadent? Oh yeah. Probably 150 points on weight watchers? Given. Tastes like a small piece of heaven? Definately. Don't skimp on the cheese! It really makes the dish!

These turned out wonderfully -- I used a convection oven for faster, more even browning. I also added a bit of nonfat milk to the creme fraiche before I did the top layer. This prevented the potatoes from drying out. I also made prepared this the night before and then started cooking it when my guests arrived. It's a lot of prep so it's better to do this in advance.

Made these last night and they were incredible. At first husband did not like smell of gruyere cheese but 5 minutes later was going crazy. Also added some onion between layers. Will make again and again.

I used crushed garlic mixed with the creme fraiche. I think it would be bland without a punch of spice. Very good!

This will be a holiday favorite. Hint:Instead of layering potatoes with creme fraiche, simply toss the potatoes in a large bowl with the creme fraiche. Place half the potatoes in baking dish, layer with cheese and repeat. It was easy and excellent!

WOW - This was by far the best vegetable dish I have ever made...I made a full 5 lb bag of yukon gold potatoes and them some...for 8 dinner guests and they were scraping the bottom of the dish...I cant believe it all went...every one wants the recipe...Served with Beef Tenderloin....It was the BEST.....We added roasted garlic to the creme fraiche and sliced green onions on each layer but it would have been GREAT without it...its all abou the cheese.....Thanks Epicurious for a great recipe I will serve forever...

I made this for Thanksgiving and loved it so much that I'm making it again for Christmas dinner with friends and neighbors today. A very simple dish yet it's still rich and hearty. After reading some of the suggestions below, I think I'll try adding some roasted garlic this time.

i made this for thanksgiving and really do not understand why everyone rated it so highly. it was really just ok, nothing exciting. i would have rather used the creme fraiche for something else instead of wasting so much of it on this dish. there are much better gratin recipes out there, although this was very easy. too bad it wasn't better...

This was a wonderful, simple recipe that I served at Thanksgiving. Everyone liked it, including my Italian boyfriend who is a cook and very selective. The high quality yet simple ingredients make this a keeper. I did about 10 layers very high in a deep casserole dish, and this required a little extra cooking time but it was fabulous.

I added a sprinkle of nutmeg with each layer of cream fraiche. I usually increase the cheese and cream.

Wow--so easy (especially if you slice the potatoes with a food processor). made several hours ahead and it kept fine in the refrigerator. Also roasted a head of garlic and added to the homemade creme fraiche.

Wonderful dish and EASY! I substituted the Creme Fraiche with sour cream, 2 Tablespoons of heavy cream and stirred in 3 large crushed garlic cloves. I took the advise of another review and was very generous with the Gruyere. It was perfect! This will definately be part of my favorite for-company recipes.

I have made this twice and believe that making the creme fraiche from scratch is key.....it definitely came out just wonderful when I made it with the homemade fraiche and only pretty good with the store-bought. When I made the creme fraiche from scratch I didn't add a single ting else to the recipe and it was hand down the best potato dish i have ever made. Highly recommended and it goes very well with a roast.

Rating: 4
Absolutely, sinfully, rich and delicious. And incredibly easy to make! However, I did make some alterations, so those who are recipe purists should avert their eyes. The second time around, I added generous amounts of minced garlic (5 large cloves) and finely chopped green onion (three bulky stalks) to each layer of the gratin, which definitely enhanced the flavour. Highly recommended!

My family has always loved scalloped and au gratin potatoes, but this is the only recipe they want now that I've tried this. There was not a scrap left over. I've had weekly requests for it.

Well, I've never been a fan of potatoes gratin until now! I used this recipe as a base recipe for an Easter dinner that I was assigned to bring potatoes to. Instead of creme fraiche I used 1 cup of cream with 1/2 cup of light sour cream and 2 large cloves of garlic pureed together. Between the layers I sprinled fresh chopped chives, gruyere and sharp cheddar. I had extra room in the pan so I added another layer of potatoes. I topped it all with a splash of half and half and some shredded parmesan. - (I was out of the cream and gruyere.) Everyone loved this dish. Even me!

I just can't rave about this recipe enough. I have made it as is, I have made it strictly with heavy whipping cream - no creme fraiche, I've added mashed garlic paste to the whipping cream, I've garnished it with scallions as opposed to parsley, etc. This recipe is fantastic AS IS but it is also fun to play around with. I agree with one other reviewer...do NOT skimp on the Gruyere, it is the key to the dish and ya can't get enough!

Rating: 3
This was very good. I had a bit more potatoes so I needed more liquid. Had 4 lbs of potatoes and added 2 cups creme fraiche and a mixture of 3 tbs sour cream and 3/4 cup 1% milk. It was picture perfect and the sour cream added - je ne sais quoi - just the right sourness with the cheese? Yum.

This was really good and really easy - it's one of those dishes that everyone likes. My mom liked it so much she made it the following night for dinner - she didn't have enough creme fraiche, so she added enough milk to equal the amount of creme called for. I thought it tasted better and moister with a little bit of milk (about 1/3 cup) - I will make it her way next time. Really great!

Rating: 4
An easy, quick recipe (using a food processor to slice the potatoes). The first time I made it, I used the whole amount of creme fraiche recommended, to the delight of my guests. The second time, I cut down the creme to 1 cup and it was still delicious, and heated up just fine the next day.

I made this recipe for New Year's Eve and thought that it was very good, although a little on the bland side. Next time I will carmelize some onion and put it between the layers as I did with the other ingredients. I really think that it would enhance the dish. Served it with prime rib...yum!!

this recipe sticks tightly to the K.I.S.S. principle and, as such, is probably the best potato au gratin recipe i have ever tasted. try using a hint of truffle-infused olive oil in the preparation if you're feeling a bit adventurous.

Everyone loved this dish... Excellent.. Willl definitely make it again. I had to make it a few hours early because I was serving it with ham which had to be heated at a much lower temperature. Then I microwaved it for about 6-7 minutes to warm up, and it was just fine. But I had a little left and the next day it did not reheat as well, the butter seperated from the cream, it was messy. So I think this dish needs to be eaten the day it is prepared.

I made 4 lbs potatoes and used 1 cup creme fraiche and 1 cup sour cream blended together. I also increased Gruyere to 8 oz. I sliced potatoes on 1/8" blade of my Cuisinart and they cooked beautifully. Loved the recipe but I don't like it when the cheese on top browns too much -- so I would probably cover for half the time with foil next time I make this.

Rating: 4
This dish meets all my criteria: Easy to prepare; looks pretty when served; has people clamoring for more. I have made this several times and it never disappoints. I use a mandolin to slice the potatoes and leave them unpeeled. I have also thinned the creme fraiche with some whole milk or cream to stretch it (creme fraiche ain't cheap) and make it easier to layer.

Rating: 4
Four ingredients = 4 forks! The potatoes had a perfect fork tender quality, and the cheese was creamy and delicious. I am not usually a fan of "swiss" style cheese, but I will add this recipe to my list of "must make again". Special enough for company and easy enough for family. I made the creme fraiche versus buying it and from now on will never buy ready made again. The recipe also halved beatifully!

This has become my special occasion potato dish. It's absolutely wonderful & everyone asks for the recipe. I'm going to try to make my own creme fraiche next time, to cut down the cost. Try this recipe - you won't be sorry.

We thought that this was wonderful! Using too few potatoes would probably make a big difference, maybe cut amounts in half and use a smaller dish (re: previous post). I did substitute Yukon Gold potatoes for Russet, let the creme fraiche sit for 2 days & used pretty good Gruyere. Easy, looks nice, tastes great. Good re-warmed...with parsey garnish put on guests individual plates rather than the entire dish. I'm taking it to an Easter party full of very picky people, and I'm sure that everyone will love it!

I didn't have good luck with this dish. I think I used too few potatoes and my baking dish was slightly smaller than recommended, but I still used the full amount of creme fraiche and cheese. Anyway, it was very greasy and too rich. It may have been my fault though. Just thought I would add my two cents.

Rating: 4
I used half and half instead of creme fraiche, and cooked the potatoes and half and half gently for 2 minutes before assembly in the casserole pan for baking. The gruyere cheese was added to the top at about the last 30 minutes of the 75 minutes of cooking. This was the best potato gratin I have tasted...a great winter dish served with salmon and a green vegetable.

Made as written it was loved with our Christmas ham. Had to make the creme fraiche too, and it turned out perfect - I may never buy it premade again! The family was suspicious of a dish made with a dairy product that had sat around for 2 days, but it was yummy. I would probably vary this recipe though by adding garlic at the least.

Potatoes gratin have always been a favorite but this recipe takes the honors. The gruyere adds a dimension that just is not there with more traditional cheeses; it gives it a creamy and zesty taste missing in other gratins. It was a hit for Thanksgiving and we have made it again since! This one will stay on our favorites list for a long time.

This was the first potato recipe that I have used with Gruyere that actually looked appetizing. I can't leave a recipe alone, so I added some half 'n half which gave it a creamier texture. I also sprinkled some paprika on top. Will definitely make again.

I made this with yukon gold potatoes instead of the baking potatoes, and used 5 pounds of potatoes but kept the other ingredients the same. It was still very good. I will stick closer to the three pounds of potatoes next time, as I would have enjoyed the cheese creme fraish mixture being more pronounced.

My family loved these potatoes at Thanksgiving. They looked absolutely gorgeous too. I, however, found them a little too "sour". Perhaps using half creme fraiche and half cream... might add a little nutmeg next time too.
