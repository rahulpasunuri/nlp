Amazing! But I made a good number of changes to the recipe. I substituted Franks Red Hot for the Tabasco (I'm sure any cayenne sauce will work but you really can't beat Franks). I also used bigger chicken drumsticks and removed the skin before marinating. I used smoked paprika which added a great flavor. I didn't have parsley so cut it out and didn't bother with the butter. I made a dipping sauce out of non fat plain yogurt, a little mayo and crumbles of blue cheese (let it set for about an hour in the fridge) Served with arugula tossed in the blue cheese sauce. Was deliciuous!!! Can't wait to make it again.

I use a "take" on this marinade for all dark-meat chicken. Just lemon juice and a lot of Tabasco. Especially nice with boneless skinless thighs-- it gives a nice kick and cuts the greasy taste totally

I reduced the Tabasco to 2 TBLS and substitued basil for parsley and used Hungarian paprika. We(3 adults and 4 teenagers) had these cold for a beach picnic along with the black bean, jicama, and grilled corn salad from Bon Appetit. It was all yummy!

The coating was just the right texture, but the chicken tasted too strongly of Tabasco.

Great dish. To make it lower in fat I spray the drumsticks with butter flavor Pam and then put the bread crumb mixture in a ziploc bag to shake them in. Makes it much easier.

This recipe is definately a keeper. We liked the fact that it was baked (rather than fried)! And the spice was definately a plus!

Excellent, spicy flavor. I have made this many times and people who like hot food really enjoyed this. I pierce the drumsticks with a fork in a few places to allow better saturation of the tabasco mixture. Also, I generally marinate the drumsticks longer than recommended here (seems to make the drumsticks more spicy); sometimes for up to eight hours. This is definitely a keeper dish for spicy food lovers.
