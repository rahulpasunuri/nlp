I love this one!! Ive made it numerous times and the best part is that you can make most of it well in advance. It also makes you look like you know what you're doing!! I'll definitely keep making it.

I made this for christmas because it reminded me of a dish my husband had on our honeymoon in France. It was easy to prepare and recieved rave reviews from my family all of whom are self proclaimed food critics! Ended up searing our own foie gras, coudl not find pre-cooked and used some of the left over drippings in the preparation of the brusselsprouts. I woudl defitely do again.

Easy to make and great as most could be done in advance. Didn't make any changes except halved the recipe. Got rave reviews - in fact am making again for a group of picky eaters.
