This is an excellent, simple dish. It's rare to find a quick meal with so much flavor. I highly recommend it. I did add 1/4 teaspoon of sugar to mellow the salty flavor.

Very nice and very simple. I would suggest to add anchovies, or a little more crushed olives ( i used the purple ones ). For me a real PUTTANESCA is a little bit more strong. Highly recomended.

This is a great, quick, easy-to-prepare, bold tasting pasta dish. The higher quality the ingredients the more magnificant this simple dish will taste. I used "Nina" brand canned tomatoes and chitarra dried pasta made by "rustichella d'abruzzo", the coarse pasta cut soaks up the sauce perfectly!

You must make this simple and quick sauce - it is amazing! This sauce is incredible - so thick and full of flavours. Fresh tomatoes are abundant right now and I used lots of vine ripened romas, plus some oven roasted ones I made with olive oil and fresh herbs - amazing. My 16 year old son sat down with the left-over sauce and garlic bread as a second helping!
