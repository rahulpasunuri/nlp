This was delicious exactly as is. I cut it long after it cooled and didn't have the easiest time of it-- but the bits and pieces all tasted great. Just tossed them into a bowl and served like that, no problem.

Had a good boxed ginger cookie today (the eve of Christmas eve in Virginia) and thought-I can do better than this! Tried these just now-wow-really good and different which I love. Added 1 T. minced crystalized ginger to the base and 1/2 extra (1tsp total) ground ginger to the topping. I did buy new powdered ginger for these and I was able to find the Lyle syrup at my local Krogers. Per other reviews (and this is essential I think) I waited about 15 minutes for the glaze to set and cut the 8X8 pan that i used into small 1 inch pieces with a very shrap knife. I removed them form the pan and let them cool on a cooling rack. They came out prefectly! Merry Christmas everyone!

An excellent cookie. I added 1 tablespoon finely chopped crystallized ginger to the shortbread base and used 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger in the topping to up the ginger flavor and baked it in a 9x9 pan.

Absolutely wonderful. Lyle's syrup is a must. It can only be purchased around here via the internet, but a sister got me some at Stop & Shop in CT. Whatever it takes, find it it adds great depth of flavor to fabulous cookies!

Very good as is but next time would use smaller pan as bars are quite thin, would double ginger amts and add crystalised ginger and/or grated fresh ginger to heighten ginger taste.

This was really delicious, however, it breaks apart very easily. Also the shortbreat can get dry and separate from the rest. It was very tasty though. I will try it again and try to master cutting it sooner rather than later.

So easy to make and very tasty. The advice to cut while still cooling was great - no crumbling issues for me. This recipe is a keeper.

I've only just found this recipe, and I've already made it twice. If there is any way to make shortbread more delicious, this is it! First time I made it, I used old ground ginger from the spice rack- absolutely NO ginger flavor, and they were still amazing. Second time used brand new ginger, and it was like a completely different dessert. Either way, they were delicious, and it is about the easiest dessert I've ever made. 20 minutes from start to finish!

A hint from my New Zealand cooking authority (Mum) - you need to cut the ginger crunch in squares or bars before it thoroughly cools. Then you'll be able to do it without it all breaking up or crumbling. Also - I add a couple of tablespoons of finely chopped (cuisinart) candied ginger - just for that extra punch

Oh, and by the way, I used light Karo syrup instead of the Lyle's syrup.

Very good! Three and a half forks. The shortbread isn't the absolutely most outstanding I've ever tasted, but it's still very good and the ginger flavor and topping make it special. I tripled the ground ginger in both parts of the recipe and added chopped candied ginger too.

My husband and I first tasted ginger crunch on a trip to New Zealand. We both adored it! A friendly inn keeper gave us a bottle of golden syrup to take home and we've been making this unusual concoction ever since. People always rave about its unusual yet pleasingly sweet taste. A pan doesn't last long! I add slightly more ground ginger to both the base and the topping than is called for in this recipe. I prefer to bake it in an 8 X 8" pan for a slightly larger bar cookie.

Make sure to spread the base evenly in the pan or it will cook unevenly and fall apart, despite the binding effect of the topping. This is good but it can't really be reliably cut into squares; you pretty much have to break it into pieces and hope the pieces don't crumble into bits. In terms of presentation that makes it rather a bear, but it is delicious.

This is an excellent recipe. If you love ginger, the cookies are addicting. It is not easy to stop eating them. I offered some cookies to two Asian friends, and they adored the cookies as much as I.

There is something magical about the taste of these divine little bars. I can't describe it, but it's wonderful. Do what the recipe directs, and cut them into the 64-pieces size. They're even better in little bitty bites, for some reason. These are easy, wonderful, and indescribably good.

Easy,fun, and inexpensive to make. Turned out very well and everyone likes it. I really love the flavor, which is gingery but a little unusual. A warning: you will find yourself addicted to this stuff! Highly recommended.

This was very tasty, but had problems. It is so thin and crumbly that 1/3 of the bars crumbled. Next time I make this I will either double the recipe or put it in a smaller pan. In addition. I only baked the base for 15 minutes otherwise it would have been overdone. I, also, sprinkled chopped candied ginger on top and it is a welcome addition.

My husband loved this one, as did I! We like blending unique and subtle flavors. The only problem I encountered was that the cookies crumbeled when I tried to cut them. I don't see how they could have cut them so small! I only got about 40 squares out the recipe. I may ahve over cooked the shortbread a bit.. This one is a keeper!

I love these! I made them for a St. Patrick's Day dinner, and they were a hit. Even my mom, who doesn't particularly care for ginger, loved these. I ran out of ground ginger after using it in the shortbread base, so I sprinkled the top (as another reviewer did) with chopped crystallized ginger while the topping was still warm, and I think that added to the allure of these delectable little things. I will make these quite often.

Wonderful, unusual and easy: 50 minutes, plus cooling. I made these for an ethnic potluck dinner, and everyone wanted the recipe. I cut five rows down and eight across so the cookies are square. You can probably substitute Karo light syrup for the Lyle's but I found it in the gourmet section at my grocery store.

This was absolutely delicious, and all my guests were asking WHAT IS THIS?? The ginger flavor is subtle, and the Lyle's syrup is essential, I think, to the lovely flavor. I know I'll make this again and again from now on.

Great Cookies! everyone loved them. When the topping was still hot I sprinkled the top with crystallized ginger, this added a great kick and they looked great too.

This is one of the lovliest holiday cookies I've made - and so easy. Be sure to add it to your Christmas baking list!

Very easy to make. The recipe has a lot of butter making it quite rich. I took these cookies to work and everyone loved them. The recipe says to bake the shortbread in a metal pan, which necessitates close monitoring towards the end baking to ensure that the shortbread doesn't get too dark. Also, I'd recommend that the cookie be cut into larger squares than suggested by the recipe. But this one is a keeper based on easy of preparation and flavor.
