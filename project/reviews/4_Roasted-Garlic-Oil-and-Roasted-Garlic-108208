Essential to any kitchen. I make this once a month...

I usually make a double batch to share with a friend, and I freeze the mash in 1 tsp drops to pull out whenever I need it, so there's no worrying on how quickly I need to use it up before it spoils. I've found the oil lasts much longer than 1 month, though I use it up fairly quickly, as it just mellows out anything you could make where you'd use garlic. Perfect recipe for my kitchen!

I used rosemary sprigs instead of thyme (and used the garlic to spread on bread, versus using the oil for other purposes). Was very easy and turned out great. Cooked it for about an hour (I think the recipe said about 45 minutes+).

A simple and easy approach to making an essential ingredient for every kitchen. Personally, I add a bit of sea salt, rosemary and a hint of red pepper and it seems to keep the oil from spoiling for 6 months or so.

This is wonderful to have on hand - both the oil and the garlic. For such a simple recipe, it has myriad uses. I use the roasted garlic for everything - it is especially delicious (with a little rosemary and salt) rubbed under the skin of a chicken breast before baking. The oil is perfect for sauting vegatables or using in a salad dressing, and a little goes a long way. Enjoy!
