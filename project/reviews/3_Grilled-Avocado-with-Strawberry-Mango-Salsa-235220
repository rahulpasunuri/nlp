My husband and I really liked this salad. The grilled avocados were good and the flavor was unchanged by the grilling only a little softer. One whole avocado per person is a lot because they are so rich. I suggest 1 LARGE avocado halved and would serve 2. Some of the citrus/vinegar should be drizzled over the greens.

The salsa was great. I used Florida avocados and I have to say that I was not too thrilled by the taste of a warm grilled avocado. Next time perhaps, I'll leave the grilling part out.
