Made this recently for a party exactly as written sans the pine nuts (plain forgot them). It was gobbled up so quickly I didn't even have a chance to sample it! Three people asked for the recipe and said three people claim they have never liked goat cheese before! I'll be making this again at Thanksgiving and will sneak some in for myself before I serve it.

YUM! And I don't even tend to like bell peppers all that much. I made this per the recipe with two exceptions - about a third less oil, and double the pine nuts. My man even said that he would like this at a super bowl party. :)

This is wonderful. I left the cheese whole and poured the dressing over top. Much easier and also went a lot farther.

Tasty and easy...although I didn't have the corriander and did omit the fennel.

I've made this at least oonce a year since it was first published. Everyone loves it. It's easy and the flavors are unique. The only change I make is to blend all ingredients together with the goat cheese - to make a wonderful spread.

I really wondered about the unusual list of ingredients but made this based on the rave reviews. I was not disappointed! My guests and I could not stop eating this stuff! I used a coffee grinder to crush the coriander and fennel seeds. I brushed the baguette slices with a mixture of olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper and threw them on the grill for 30 seconds per side. I then let them cool and put them in a ziplock until serving time. I served this in a quiche dish with the grilled baguette layered around the outside of the dish. Fabulous!

Excellent! I was surprised at how delicious this was, given how easy it was to prepare. No need to change a thing - although any combination of peppers would work.

I made this last night as a test drive for Thanksgiving. I made it as written but plan to make a few changes for tomorrow. I am using red, orange and yellow peppers and just a tiny bit of green. I am going to drizzle the whole think with just a bit of balsamic vinegar. Even my 11 year old liked these. The colors are really pretty for a Thanksgiving dish. I am going to have a side dish with some good green and black olives because I think they will add a punch too.

This recipe has made the rounds with all my friends. I don't think I've ever had such a universal hit! It's great on bagels in the a.m. if you have any left...

I've only made this 2x, but will make it many more. I love it! Such a wonderful combination of flavors, and so very easy. I have just run the garlic through my garlic press, both because it is quicker than slicing, and because I know my husband wouldn't like the big pieces of garlic. This is a great recipe!

This recipe is my absolute favorite appetizer to serve at dinner parties. It's not too heavy and it is extremely flavorful. Everyone always raves about it (even those who claim not to like goat cheese).
