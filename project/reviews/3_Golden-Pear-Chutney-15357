Really intoxicating! We followed the recipe with our own version of the 4-spices blend (extra nutmeg and cinnamon and a little allspice) and because there were not enough fresh pears left on the tree, added about a half pound of apples. I loved making the "roux" with the sugar and pear water; it felt like making a gumbo! The result was absolutely perfect; when it cools, the sugar carmelizes and it is far thicker, so don't drain it! Will be making another batch; this is going fast!

WAY too much vinegar in this recipe, I didn't care for it at all. It is like eating something that has been pickled strongly. I am disappointed after reading the other reviews, I thought it would be fabulous. I followed the recipe exactly.

I'm from Belgium and we're not used to eat chutneys uphere but they sound so attractive, I'd like to try one. The only thing is that I'm vegetarian so thank you for the idea of serving it with cheese and crackers!

I have never made anything like this before, it was delicious and the perfect side for turkey. The flavors are complex and intoxicating. The family loved it!

Used under ripe green-skinned pears (unpeeled)and 2 heaping teaspoons chipotle chile with about 1/2 the indicated vinegar. Turned out well- accompanies ham, turkey, duck, and lamb quite nicely. Has a mellow heat first with the mustard then developing with the smokey chile.Had no problems with thickening but I did simmer the sugar syrup alone until about the consistency of Karo. Plan to make again using fresh quince.

Tasty. No problems here thickening the sauce. I did make 1/2 the amount, though, since we only wanted enough for immediate consumption. There is still a ton!

Taste was great... but I would use more fruit to liquid ratio. I canned mine after draining out at least 1/3 of the liquid, and got great results. I am making it again today, and will be using 25% more fruit to the same other ingredients.

I'm making this as I write and it tastes wonderful. I came back to check on comments because it WILL NOT thicken. I see someone said they added more cornstarch...more than what? It doesn't call for any! I added cornstarch and it looks just about perfect.

This is really good and simple to make, but I would use less cayenne next time. Also, I had to add quite a bit more cornstarch to get it to the right consistency. I served this with warm brie and crackers: it was a bit hit! It's also been a great hostess gift,etc. throughout the fall.

The recipe was perfect. It was easy to make and tastes great. It makes exactly 5 pints! I think it will make wonderful Christmas gifts.
