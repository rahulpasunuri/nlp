This was my first batch of pitas ever and they turned out fantastic! I do have a knack and passion for yeasty concoctions though...The recipe is great if you follow the instructions carefully. I made mini pitas by cutting it into 16 smaller chunks. Used a countertop toaster oven. A+++ would make again and again.

I didn't really follow the directions for this recipe. Just pulled the quantities. Used 3 tsp of rapid rise yeast and opted for sugar instead of honey. Eliminated the cornmeal. Added yeast to the whole portion of water and let it sit, made the dough as normal and did a warm rise in the oven for about an hour, hour and a half. The dough yielded about 13 pitas rolled out fairly thin, and I baked them on a pre-heated cookie sheet rather than on the rack itself for about 2 minutes on either side. They formed beautiful pockets and held up well despite being thin. Great toasted into chips with homemade hummus.

I tried this recipe a couple of times, using the tips in some of the other reviews, and I just did not get good results. I mean, it was edible, and of course better than store bought, but I have gotten consistently better results using the "pocket bread" recipe in the Laurel's Kitchen Bread book. The cornmeal sprinkling on the baking sheets is unnecessary. I think the dough needs 2 full rises before shaping into its pita/loaves. Letting the shaped pitas rise for 30 minutes, for me, did not work at all. When I did that, they did not form pockets. When I put them in the oven (straight onto the racks) ASAP, they puffed very well.

I made this as per the recipe with the exeption of cutting the salt slightly . They were fantastic! I would definitely make again and up the amount of whole wheat flour next time.

After reading other pita bread recipes and comments, I decided to: use 1 cup bread flour and 2 cups whole wheat, and add 4 tsp vital wheat gluten to ensure a rise. It worked! These pitas are just as poufy and tender as can be. Be sure to roll them very thin and absolutely let them rest 30 minutes before baking. I use a baking stone, which I think makes a big difference. They have a wonderful flavor and worth the time to make at home. I'm going to freeze a bunch. Enjoy!

My 9 year old daughter and I made these--very fun recipe and absolutely the best pita I've ever eaten. Try these once and you will never buy pita bread again. PS Thanks to A Cook from Sacramento who recommended adding the 4 tsp of wheat gluten

really great and easy recipe. I just made it and cut it in half since it was my first time. but it is pretty fool-proof and delicious!

Fantastic recipe as is. However, I've noticed that I rarely achieve the "pockets" commonly found in store-bought pita bread... That is, until I added 4 tsp of wheat gluten to the flour. That batch of pita rose TREMENDOUSLY in the oven, and held that perfect pocket shape. The wheat gluten also helped to enhance the flavor of the wheat. Finally, an absolutely foolproof pita bread recipe!

I made these pretty much as written and they were FABULOUS! So easy. The dough is silky and easy to knead. Love this!

For previous review, I froze the shaped dough! Baked without the wax paper and foil!

Doubled the recipe - shaped dough into pita and stacked with wax paper, wrapped in foil. Baked at 500F a bit longer than recipe and was great! Working this dough is a real pleasure - one of the best I've done!

Haven't made this recipe yet, but salt is NOT a leavening agent. It actually slows the yeast down. Leaving out the salt will change the flavor and speed up your rise times a little, that's all.

Rating: 3
Fantastic recipe and so easy. I am looking for a saltless pita recipe but was reluctant to eliminate the salt from this recipe, as I know salt acts as a leavening agent. Does anyone know a whole wheat pita bread recipe than doesn't use salt?

Rating: 3
The bread came out really well! The process, as with all bread making, is a little labour intensive, but I think it was all well worth it. I made smaller breads (4-5 inches), so got almost double the amount mentioned in the recipe. Paired it with the gyros recipe on this website. Lip smacking!

I was in a greek pita mode and buying lots of pita at the grocery store. This recipe tastes so fresh in comparison to store bought ones. I make tzatziki with cream cheese and grated, strained cucumbers with minced garlic as a topping with tomatoes. I think it'll make great pizza crusts too.

Rating: 4
As suggested in other reviews I baked these on my pizza stone and they turned out great. They're not really an everyday thing since they took about 2 hours start to finish, but a nice special occasion treat.

This took longer than I expected and my first batch I cooked longer than prescribed. They were super hard. The second batch, I followed the baking time and they looked much better. I may up the whole wheat next time--and there will be a next time!

I made this successfully in a food processor without having to hand knead. I accidentally added all the water in the first part of the rise, and at the end, lightly floured a plastic tray and let the rolled pitas rest there instead of on cornmeal without problems with sticking. I tried placing the pita directly on the oven racks, but found using the pizza stone was more manageable. The recipe seems to be forgiving, and the results were great.

Rating: 4
Surprisingly easy to make, and the pita tasted great. The trick is to roll the pita very thin, like the pitas you buy in a store, so that each ball rolls out to a circle that is approximately 7-8" in diameter. I did not flatten mine out enough and they tasted great, but puffed up into little hemispheres, not the right shape for pita. Also, the cooking time (in my oven) was too short. I cooked them about 5 mins on the first side, and then 2 mins on the back side. They actually developed "pockets" that way.

After a first failed attempt at making pitas using a different recipe - this recipe is a winner. The pitas turned out perfectly puffed and delicious hot out of the oven served with hummus, grilled veggies, feta and olives. I will be making these again and again.

I've been making bread for 25 years and this is the best pita bread recipe I've made. It stays soft and fresh for several days and has exceptional flavor! Did't change a thing.

Rating: 3
Awesome, easy and authentic! What more can you want from any recipe? A huge hit on our weekly greek night. If you don't want to put the dough directly on the oven grates, try a pizza stone. Then you won't have curved ends on some of the breads.

Wow, what an easy and inexpensive way to make pitas. Pitas now cost $6.00 in our area for what this recipe created, and it probably only cost us $0.50! I'm eating my first testing of this recipe and am very pleased with the results. I only had 2.5 cups of whole wheat flour, so I added white flour and then a little oat bran to the recipe. It all worked great.

This was the first time I made pita and it came out great. I used 3 cups whole wheat flour but other than that followed the recipe exactly. While the dough was rising I made a white bean hummus - I roasted a small head of garlic at 375 drizzled with olive oil. One 15 oz. can of cannellini, rinsed and drained, the roasted head of garlic, lemon juice, salt and pepper. The pita is great with it. Definitely make this again and again!

excellent pita: soft, yet grainy with the wheat. I just ate one with nutella and am having trouble saving the rest for tonight's hummus. My two-year-old daughter likes them too. Lucy

I am NOT a baker, so I attempted this recipe with much trepidation. However, despite my previous failed attempts, these pitas came out GREAT! It was a little on the flavorless side though, so I think I will try to use a little more honey and add toasted sesame seeds. Otherwise, I used all whole wheat flour and added 1/2 c. wheat bran.

Rating: 4
This is one of the easiest and tastiest recipes for pita bread I've tried. It's really important to make sure the surface you place the dough rounds on for the final rise will not stick to the dough -- you want to be able to slide the rounds right off. I think cornmeal is best for preventing sticking. Also, this recipe doubles nicely.

Rating: 4
easy to make, I like a lot of fiber and heartiness so used whole wheat flour, milled flax seed and some oat bran too...it was delicious and turned out with great pockets!

I thought this worked very well. I used about 2 cups of whole wheat flour, 1 C all-purpose white flour, and a couple of tablespoons of wheat gluten. Just for fun, since I was making falafel out of garbanzo beans from last year's hurricane stash and since these breads were supposed to cook for such a short time, I did them using our outdoor gas grill on the upper level (with a stainless steel baking sheet). I don't think I let the grill preheat enough for the first batch so they were a little flat, but the second batch came out nice and puffy. Not only is this recipe good, you can make it without electricity as long as you have a nice hot grill!

Rating: 3
I'm not sure where I went wrong. . .but putting the pitas directly on the grill did not go well to say the least - I ended up having to use my flat pan - the pitas were pretty good in the end but a lot of work and a really dirty oven. If I can figure out where I may have gone wrong I'll make them again.

I have made this recipe several times now, and it has always worked out fabulously. I used a little bit more honey that 1 teaspoon, and all whole wheat flour, no gluten and no cornmeal. The pitas still came out soft and stayed fresh. I especially like to sift sesame seeds and thyme into the flour before adding any liquid, it really adds a nice flavor.

I made the dough for this in my bread machine --- basically I put the ingredients in the order one usually would (water, sweetener, oil, salt, flour, yeast). Seems to have turned out well --- and cuts the total working time to 20 minutes or so (add in 2 hours for the bread machine to do its thing).

I made this with 3 cups of freshly milled whole wheat, 2 Tbsp.gluten and followed the recipe otherwise. I am thrilled with the results! Every loaf was perfect. I have made whole wheat pita in the past, usually with disappointing results. This recipe is a winner.

Yummy! I used 3 cups whole wheat flour with 2 Tbsp. Vital Gluten. Even my picky toddler loved them! We had no problems splitting them. They looked just like they do in the store, only they tasted much better!

This pita bread is just great! My kids love it. I omitted the white flour and used 3 cups of whole wheat flour with 3 tablespoons of gluten flour (for soft texture, this is the secret for soft 100% whole wheat bread, you can get it a health food stores). I warmed up the honey, olive oil and salt with the water before adding the yeast (I do this when making any bread). All the ingredients being warm helps the yeast rise. I took some one's advise from a previous review and mixed all the ingredients and let it rise for 1h and 30min in a warm oven (turn oven on 400F for one minute than turn it off). I use the corn meal with no problems, it didn't even get brown, maybe because I have a gas stove? or maybe because I used a heavy stainless steel pizza pan. Because some reviews said the bread plain, I added more honey and salt. My turned out so good, I will make a triple recipe next time. Good cooking to you!

Simple to make, and the texture and flavor simply can't be beat. I even prefer this to the pita bread at the local Middle Eastern bakeries. Though other reviewers have complained about blandness, I added an extra squeeze of honey, which I think helped bring out the sweetness of the wheat.

My first attempt at pita making myself. It was surprisingly easy and fun! I used just 100% whole wheat pastry dough (3 cups), and pure maple syrup instead. I don't think it matters much what type of sugar the yeast feeds on since it's such a small amount. It was a smooth dough and great to work with. I didn't have any cornmeal so I just sprinkled the bread with more flour as I stacked them before baking. This worked out. It would have been more easier to split into pockets if I rolled out the dough more thickly. Overall, a delicious pita. If they cool and get stiff, I suppose one could warm them up and they would still be just as tasty! I look forward to another chance to make them again. I think freezing them is a great idea for a quicker meal.

I took the advice of a previous poster and did not use the cornmeal. Since I was hosting a dinner party, I was afraid of a burned smell in my house. So, I put the pita rounds on waxed paper to rise before baking. But, when it came time to put them in the oven, they STUCK to the wax paper! Some would not come off at all, and I had to reshape. It was a nightmare! Has anyone else had this problem? They ended up baking OK, but I would probably add more flour during rolling and definitely use the cornmeal to avoid this problem.

This was my hubby and I's first foray into breadmaking. It was easy and they came out so great. I often wonder when we go to middle eastern and greek restaurants why their pita bread is thicker than store bought. Now we can make it at home. I wrapped them in foil and we ate them all week; made individual pizzas or just dipped in hummus. Good stuff! PS: Cornmeal charred for me too, smoke detector went off!

Rating: 4
Fantastic dough, easy to work with. Would skip the cornmeal bit - at 500 the cornmeal falls off and chars. Will make regularly.

If you're out of honey just use sugar instead as I did. It was fine to just kneed all the ingredients together at the beginning and let rise a couple of hours--no need for complicated cycles of kneeding and rising. Press the dough out into rectangles instead of circles, they'll fit better into a regular household oven! Dough was too saggy to go directly onto my oven racks, so baked on oiled metal trays instead. Wonderful!

Out of this world!!!! Hint: prepare as much of this as you can (double the recipe) and freeze the unused pita breads.

This is outstanding!! I love it! Very easy recipe and pretty much fool proof. I do agree alone, they taste rather bland. But if you dip them in hummus or just butter out of the oven, very tasty. I used ceramic tile at the bottom of my oven and set the pita right on that, it worked wonderfully.

They turned out so good, better than I expected!! The only problem I had was the dough was very very thick and would not roll out into nice sized round balls. In the end they had a very "homemade" look and tasted fantastic!

I agree wholeheartedly with the Cook from Chicago,IL., I have tried making pita bread a number of times and this is the first success! To those who thought the flavor was bland, it may have something to do with the olive oil used. I just happened to use a new bottle of extra-virgin olive oil and the flavor of the bread was outstanding.

Rating: 2
Although they turned out looking beautiful and splitting open, they had little taste. They tasted good with hummus or lamb kabobs, but tasted like cardboard on their own. Might possibly try again with more salt or olive oil. Cooking for 5 minutes would have been way(!!!!) too long in my estimation. They do give you a sense of accomplishment as the previous reviewer said.

I have tried 3 other pita bread recipes before this one and believe me this recipe is awesome. Worked perfectly and what a sense of accomplishment to have made pita bread

This is an amazing recipe. Extremly easy to prepare with fantastic results. Unlike the previous comment, my pita did split. It would have been perfect for grilled or roasted veggies with melted cheese. However, I served it with hummus and the bread was hit. I doubled the recipe and because I had to step out for a bit, I let it rise in the refrigerator for approximately 4 hours. When I arrived home, it was beautifully risen and ready to ball, roll and bake. This recipe is a definate addition to my cookbook. Thank you, Epicurious!

This is the best pita recipe that I've tried. It isn't doughy like others. It doesn't split open like the ones you buy in the store but tastes much better.
