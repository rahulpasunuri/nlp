Not worth the effort or expense! We love rib-eye's and this prep did nothing for them.

A good and simple recipe that can be varied in a number of ways. Roasted red peppers and balsamic are just a great classic combo. I prefer to roast my own peppers, and add some heat with crushed red pepper. Rosemary can also be subsituted or added to with several different herbs.

I thought the flavors in this were good, but just not strong enough, even though I marinated it for about 5 hours. I think that the ratio of oil to vinegar should be almost reversed. As it was, I cut back on the oil and double the vinegar; it was still way too oily. The acid in the vinegar is what breaks down the tissue fibers in the meat, so more vinegar would have produced a more tender steak. I don't cook much red meat, so perhaps my technique was off; I'll try this again with more vinegar and less oil and see if it helps. It also set off the smoke detector. I did like the red peppers in this dish (I roast my own so they're not soggy) but only once I put vinegar on top of them in the pan and they turned black and crusty. Yum!

This marinade is delicious and easy and will add flavor to many different cuts of beef. But, my husband and I weren't pleased with the roasted peppers. I thought they took away from the simple goodness of the meat. Might try it with a different vegetable next time.

I am not an experienced cook but I found this recipe to be very easy. I marinated the steaks for 2 hours and then forgot to salt them, but they tasted great anyway. I thought the peppers were an important part of the recipe they are cooked in the juices and with balsamic vinegar at the end and poured over the steak. YUM!

Easy to make. Can go with the red peppers or just skip them, the marinate is what this recipe is all about. Marinate longer if able to and get your pan good and hot before you throw them on. Read recipe carefully because the vinegar is DIVIDED and this is not stated in the list of ingredients. Enjoy.

This dish was excellent! If peppers aren't your thing, try substituting them for white mushroom caps and adding another tablespoon of balsimic vinegar to brown them out...an excellent dish.

Very good! If you like balsamic vinegar, roasted red peppers and garlic, this one is for you. MArinate as long as you can and have a hot pan ready. I will make this again.
