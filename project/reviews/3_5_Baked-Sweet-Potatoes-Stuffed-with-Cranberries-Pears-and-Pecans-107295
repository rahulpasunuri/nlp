I have made this several years in a row now. I actually keep the topping separate in case some people want traditional sweet potato toppings. I exclude the balsamic vinegar and sometimes add a bit of fresh lemon. Delicious!

I wasn't sure about this blend of ingredients, but this turned out to be the hit of the meal. One person doesn't like sweet potatoes, so I made one with a regular baking potato. She also doesn't like butter, so I made the butter-vinegar mixture with olive oil and balsamic. It was great. Baking time of the larger sweet potatoes was more like 75 minutes versus the estimated 55. Other than that, the recipe was perfect as directed, and I rarely follow a recipe this closely. Try this one...you're dinner guests will be amazed.

I was baking sweet potatoes for a quick supper and wanted to check the baking time for the potatoes, and stumbled upon this recipe. How fortunate! This recipe turned a simple supper into something quite scrumptious! While the potatoes were baking, I just quickly sauteed the other ingredients, substituting ground ginger for real ginger, because it's what I had on hand.

I really like this recipe, but I did my own interpretation of it. Instead of baking the whole potatoes, I peeled, cubed, and roasted the potatoes in a little olive oil. I also soaked the cranberries in brandy, at the suggestion of a previous reviewer. Lastly, I put the potatoes and cranberry mixture on top of Israeli couscous with a touch of cinnamon and added the extra splash of balsamic vinegar at the end. I'm the only one who will be eating it, but I love it!

I make this every year for Thanksgiving, soaking the cranberries in a sweet wine or port. It is fancy enough to impress guests and if made in a casserole or individual ramekins, it is very quick and satisfying. I usually make this in individual ramekins, being able to individualize to our family members preferences is a big plus.

Yummy! I love this recipe!

A very nice change from the praline topped variety. I took the advice of others and made this into a casserole dish. I boiled the potatoes then mashed them with butter, cream and vanilla and spread the mixture in the casserole dish. I covered the cranberries in sweet wine and microwaved them to soften. I also added the ginger to the pan when cooking the pear.

This is a wonderful recipe; if you do not have pears on hand, sub with tart apples... equally delicious and pine nuts work in lieu of the pecans.

I made this for TG and it was very good but not the show-stopper I thought it would be. The final package wasn't as beautiful as the photo (the sides of the potatoes didn't stand up) and the taste wasn't as great as I thought it would be. If I did make it again I would mix the potato and the stuffing together.

Made this for Thanksgiving and thought this was a great side dish, my husband really enjoyed. The balsalmic vinegar was a nice contrast to sweet potato. I followed suggestion of another and treated more like a twice baked potato, scooping out sweet potato after baking and reloading with fillings. This is a beautiful side dish for those who don't like marshmallows.

A delicious healthy alternative to white potatoes or rice. I did not follow the recipe exactly as my daughter does not like cooked pears, and I didn't have pecans. Also substituted dark brown sugar. Nevertheless it was delicious and easy for a weekday meal but would make a great addition to a holiday menu too. Will definitely make again - and experiment with variations.

I have so many good things to say about this recipe! The presentation was beautiful. I used ruby red yams because they have a tougher skin than the regular do. Do not over bake the yams that can cause trouble with the skin peeling off easily. I mashed the pulp outside of the potatoes and did not put all of it back in so there was more room for the wonderful filling. Each ingredient in the filling complemented the other beautifully making a perfect flavor. I thought the ginger was just the right amount. Everyone loved them they were the hit of our Christmas Eve dinner. This recipe is a keeper and I will not only use it for holiday dinners. They would be great in the fall with any type of dinner.

Good recipe. I have also made the topping and baked over mashed sweet potatoes in a casserole dish.

I made the recipe as written, and we all found the ginger overpowering. It looks beautiful, though. If I make it again, I'll leave out the ginger. If you love ginger, though, this is the recipe for you.

Wonderful dish that really pleased yesterday's Thanksgiving crowd. Served it casserole-style with pear mixture on top. Used d'Anjou pears since they hold their shape so nicely when sauteed. Soaked the cranberries in warm brandy (thanks Highland Park) and left to sit overnight so all the brandy was soaked up. Increased the butter/balsamic mixture for the potatoes. Forgot the brown sugar but decided not to add it after I remembered since it had enough natural sweetness. This is a dish for those of us who aren't members of the marshmellow-sweet potato society.

This dish is delish! It was simple and quick to prepare. I loved the topping--not too busy with a great mix of flavors and textures. The basalmic vinegar gave this dish a subtly different taste that made it special. I didn't follow the recipe exactly. Once I scooped out the yams from their skins I didn't feel like putting it all back in them so I just put them in a serving dish and put the topping on it. That way we were able to control our portions and 3 yams fed 7 people with some left-overs for tomorrow.

Just finished Thanksgiving dinner and thought this dish was wonderful. Very easy to prepare ahead of time and simply rewarm. All of my guests really thought the sweet potatoes were super with the sweet, crunchy topping. I will make again.

I'm not one for fussy dishes, but find that this one is worth it. Some people find the ginger too overpowering, so if serving to a crowd, cut back a little. I usually chop up pears and other ingredients and saute them all together, then heap whatever is in the pan into however many potatoes I'm cooking. Great even with just a light salad - and makes your kitchen smell divine!

I wish I had read the comments before making this. It took too much of my time, and was the least eaten dish on the table. I found it to be too dry and not appitising enough. traeting it like twice baked potoe's would have been a big improvement. will try again without the Thanksgiving pressure!

This dish stands out alone, even along side a huge Thanksgiving meal. The presentation is inviting, the sweet potatoes mixed with butter and balsamic vinegar a unique and delicious flavor.

Excellent... add cinnamon if you like it. i removed the potato insides and mashed them seperately, then folded cranberry, pear, roasted banana and spices in, and restuff the potato skins.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner. It was quite fiddly, and frankly didn't have enough of an "oohh, ahhh" factor for me to bother with again. I think ordinary whipped sweet potatoes would have done just as well.

This is a good side dish. I made the following changes to the original recipe. I used balsamic reduced by 75%. Same measurements but the reduced vinegar adds an additional layer of sweetness. I used 3/4 cup cranberries. I roasted the pecans and used about 1.5 cups. I removed the potato meat and pushed thru a food mill for a smooth texture. I served the mixture in a potato cup made from another potato. I used a slinder long potato for the cup. I cut the ends off then cut in half on a 45 degree angle. Hollowed these out, baked with oil and kosher salt for 35 minutes. Place potato mixture in the cup and top with the compote. It looks very nice on a plate. Experiment with the cups and how you want the plate to look. Have fun !!

Excellent! The flavors blend together perfectly to create a new taste sensation for the humble sweet potato!

Pretty tough to find 8 oz sweet potatoes...next time I will buy the big ones and cut them in half (as for twice baked) rather than lop off the top quarter inch. We had plenty to stuff the potatoes with. Thought it was tasty as did all of guests. I was wary of the vinegar but not with the end result! This is not a dish to make at the last minute, and is great for those cooks who like to get things prepared ahead of time!

The flavors were so distinctive, yet they didn't overpower one another. I macerated the cranberries in warm brandy and I also used yams as they have a deeper color and richer flavor along with the fact that the skins are tougher and held up well to the mashing. Served this to a very critical crew -- grown children and grandchildren. They loved it!

My husband and I loved it. I do think, however, that it's a bit optimistic to expect this to top 8 potatoes. I cut everything in half, and had enough for 2 large potatoes (with very little left over). I can't wait to make it again!

Cut down on the ginger. Otherwise, it was great.

Had to be a little creative w/ this one. Potato skin fell apart while trying to mash. I ended up just taking the pulp out and mixing in a bowl. While trying to think about how to salvage the dish my mother in law suggested putting them in ramekins and then topping with the pear mixture. Turned out great and made a very pretty presentation.

Really delicious.I didn't have any pears on hand so I substituted apples. Worked great. Make sure you bake the sweet potatoes completely or they might be hard to mash in their skins. I'm going to use this for Christmas this year. Definite keeper.
