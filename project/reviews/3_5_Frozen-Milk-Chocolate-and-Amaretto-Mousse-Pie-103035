Reminds me of my mom's old 50s recipe for Brandy Alexander pie. So easy. Plus, why not be creative and put them in mini-pie tins (Keebler makes them) or even martini glasses with crushed cookies and almonds on top for great presentation? Thanks!!

Delicious and very easy! I couldn't find chocolate wafer cookies so I mashed up almost a whole box of chocolate teddy grahams. It was fabulous! Definately make a day ahead of time to let the flavors work together!

Oh and I meant to add, I love Amaretto and didn't think it was too strong at all, in fact if you used less I think it might just taste like chocolate pie. Which is still good but not the point of this recipe! ;)

Easy as could be and yummy, it disappeared quickly! I might like it even more topped with whip cream but it's great as is.

1/3 cup amaretto does make it kinda boozy.

Very rich, too strong amaretto flavor. Would use less liquor next time. Nice texture, refreshing summertime treat.

Very easy to make it and very rich! I made this over the holidays and it was very well received! I think that it would be better with the strawberry sauce as recommended by the cook from NC. I going to make this again!

This was good but not the best thing I've ever made. I probably wouldn't make it again.

My Valentine's dessert. I dressed it up with strawberry sauce and a chocolate dipped whole strawberry. Very Rich!
