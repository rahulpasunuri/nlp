I love the flavor of sesame oil in a salad dressing. I would add it to this one. There's a good asian salad recipe on consultations4health.blogspot.com that has raw apple cider vinegar to give it a kick, and it's healthy!

i make a similar salad with bok choy or baby bok chow which is chopped and raw. it gets rave reviews. i tried other veggies with the dressing and noodle/nut mixture and really prefer the bok chow.nyc

I was impressed with how delicious this simple dressing is. Agree with other reviewers to maybe give the ramen noodles a few extra minutes to toast, then add the almonds. Also don't forget (like I did!) to separate the oil. Only 6 of those 8 tablespoons go into the dressing. Since it's not really a meticulous recipe where you'd be paying extra close attention to the instructions, I think it's an easy error to make.

I substitute shredded cabbage (from Trader Joes - it's the only cabbage that comes shredded just thin enough) for the spinach. Hugely popular!

Excellent! The mix of nuts & noodles is nice. The sesame seeds are too small with almonds & noodles., so they tend to clump together & stay on the bottom.

After reading the reviews, I used 6 tbsp. of canola oil in lieu of olive oil and added 1 tbsp. of sesame oil. I used a combo of seasoned and unseasoned rice vinegar and added fresh grated ginger. I think this last addition is a must. I sauteed separately each of the noodles, almonds, and sesame seeds (used a combo of white and black). My noodles coloured very quickly. I also added sliced red onion (instead of green onion) and mandarin oranges and julienned red pepper. The presentation on black Asian style plates was lovely but I thought the salad wasn't really memorable.

First saute noodles before almonds and sesame seeds, mandarin oranges were great in salad. Also, I added 1/4 of the seasoning pack to the dressing, Excellent! Everyone wanted the recipe.

I followed the advice of another cook who said to add the nuts and sesame seeds after cooking the noodles a bit. This is good advice as it takes the noodles a little while to cook. I added mandarin orange quarters. I made it with Miso Glazed Seabass. It was a huge hit and I will definitely make it again!

I would give this 3 1/2 stars. This salad is really good. I made it for a gathering and everyone loved it. It only contains a few simple ingredients, but the flavors come together and compliment each other really well. I would not change any of the ingredients, but I would pan saute the noodles for at least two minutes before adding the almonds. I would wait another minute or two before adding the sesame seeds. The problem is the sesame seeds cook MUCH faster than the ramen noodles, and can easily burn over medium heat for that long. With that said, I loved this recipe, and I will make it again. Also, the dressing would be good on any asain inspired salad.

oh my!i made this for a labor day picnic and even though i am known for bringing great food to a party..i have NEVER had so many compliments on a dish in my life. even the teens were raving about this salad. and the men! it is so amazingly simple but so incredibly delicious. i added mandarin oranges also and used a melon scoop to scoop out pineapple. i also used more sesame oil in place of the olive oil and i think that made the dressing much better. i also toasted the almonds and sesame seeds separately to avoid burning. you must make this salad to believe how great it is!

This dish was so easy and quick--I literally made it in 10 minutes! I substituted cabbage for the spinach (it was a coleslaw mix), added fresh pineapple, a splash of sesame oil & fire oil to the dressing (in place of some of the olive oil), and used half sesame oil and half olive oil to brown the noodle/nut/seed mixture. Other reviewers are right-on...do the noodles first (and break them up before you start unlike the way I did it!!), then about 5 minutes in, add the almonds, then about 7 in, add the sesame seeds (I used black for color--gorgeous!). Everyone loved the dish and I will most definitely make it again!

I've made this dish several times for large get togethers and it has always been a hit. I've also grilled chicken and added it to the salad and made it a meal. It is better to make the dressing a day ahead if possible. Easy and great for a party.

I followed the advice to add the nuts and seeds to the ramen mix after the ramen had already started to brown. Otherwise, I made it exactly as is. Pretty good, but I'd suggest making the crunchies a day before to let them absorb each other's flavors and so they won't have such a greasy feel and making the dressing a day ahead to let it thicken and the flavors blend. Next time, I'll try baking the crunchies and adding ginger to the dressing.

Can't go wrong with this dressing. Use ingredients only as a starting point as there is so much more potential. Added canned mandarin oranges and another time added fresh pineapple. Also, tried dried fruits. No matter what I added the salad came out great!!

My husband and I loved this salad. I added a few splashes of sesame oil and cut down on the olive oil--it really can use less and still taste great. I found that the sesame seeds almost burned before the noodles were done, so next time I will first add the noodles--cook a few minutes--then add the almonds and seeds. I used seasoned rice wine vinegar. Also, next time I would weither cut down on the onions, or saute them for a few minutes to take their "bite" out.

For those of you wanting lowfat crunchies... Preheat oven to 250F-275F (depending on your oven). It's like making Chex Party Mix -- bake for 1 hour & stir every 15 minutes. I used a cookie sheet lined with foil and sprayed with an olive oil cooking spray. Place ramen noodles only on foil and spray lightly and evenly with cooking spray. Stir in sesame seeds and almonds after 30 minutes, and bake for another 30 minutes or until golden brown.

Excellent salad! Have made it many times and each time I have to print the recipe off and give it to several people!!! Great for potluck, as I just make up the crunchy stuff and the dressing the night before and put the salad together right at the last minute. I always reduce the amount of sugar by 1/3 or 1/2 and I have also used honey in place of sugar. Yum. A wok works great for toasting the crunchy stuff. Oh - some advice, add the sesame seeds after you think the ramen and nuts are about 1/2 done. Otherwise the seeds get too brown too quickly. A friend suggests toasting the crunchies in the oven on a cookie sheet and omitting the oil from that process. Haven't tried it, but I'm sure it would work fine.

This was absolutely yummy! I quit eating the rest of my dinner so that I could have more of this.

As all the rest of you did, I made a few substitutions, but the basic recipe is a great starting point. I added a few dashes of sesame oil to the dressing, used broccoli slaw, added some (unshelled) sunflower seeds and some chopped dry roasted peanuts (the hot & spicy variety), about 1/2 cup of each, and how can you forget the cilantro!! I added the falvor packets to the dressing: I used one of picante chicken and one of the chile flavor with the dressing mix for a double batch. I liked it better after it had set a bit longer, actually. Now that I think about it, it's really not much like the original at all! A double batch was enough for 10 people, and everyone loved it!

Rating: 3
At this point I'm no longer reviewing the original recipe, since all the modifications make this an entirely different salad. I used 3 c cabbage and 3 c spinach, 1/2 c red onion, 2 scallions, and one 15oz can of mandarin oranges for the bulk of the salad. For the dressing, I used 2 T toasted sesame oil, 3 T seasoned rice vinegar, 2 T sugar, and 3 T low-sodium soy sauce. I toasted the almonds and sesame seeds separately, and after I toasted the noodles, I added some water to soften them. I didn't cool them before mixing with the salad greens, since I prefer both spinach and cabbage slightly wilted. The result was a very good, standard Asian salad-- it tasted like Chinese chicken salad without the chicken. Next time, I would really like to add some marinated, grilled chicken as suggested, and I would throw in one more green onion.

I laughed when I saw this recipe. It is one that's been popular for about 10-15 years here in the Upper Midwest. We (me & the other 10,000+ cooks who regularily make this) don't consider it gourmet cuisine, but it's always popular at gatherings. (Perhaps could be considered the summer equivelant of "Hot Dish"?) Hee-hee... However, it is refreshing & light. I have never cooked the Ramon noodles before adding to the salad. Just a note: You can reduce an enormous amount of fat from the recipe by using the non-fried noodles. They are labled as low fat & have been air-dried as opposed to fried. I would add them to the salad at least an 1 & 1/2 hours before serving, as they are as hard as a Minnesota winter... Enjoy!

Not only would I make this again but we have had it several times since we first discovered the recipe. We have also added various other things to it but really like the dressing.

Excellent flavor. Since I have yet to receive counselling for never ever following a recipe, I made some changes. I didn't find fresh spinach, so I used arugula, which was a-mazing in this salad. I used very lightly sauteed asparagus and snow peas instead of green onions, white vinegar & red vinegar instead of rice, which I couldn't find, and added 2 red bell peppers, 2 mangoes, and shredded leftover grilled chicken. Omitted seeds and almonds as my hubby can't eat them for medical reasons. Peppers and chicken didn't make that big an impression.

This was fabulous! I also used the so-called Kirkland recipe and instead of green onions, substituted stir-fried sugar peas that I let sit to room temperature. Also added a breast of smoked chicken. My 5-year-old, who is not a big vegetable fan and initially looked at the salad with a skeptical eye, gobbled it up once he started and asked for seconds and even thirds. Wonderful!

Great texture and flavor to this salad. We made it for dinner last night adding some grilled chicken breasts. The salad dressing I used was from another recipe on epicurious submitted by a reviewer and contained within a recipe review, "Kirkland dressing." The crunchy ramen noodles were surprisingly good!

Nice flavor & texture, but, like nearly everyone else, I too made some changes/additions to the recipe. Used 4 Tbsp. peanut oil, 4 Tbsp. olive oil. Reduced the sugar, used seasoned rice vinegar, tsp. fresh minced ginger and half of the oriental ramen seasoning packet. Threw in a handful or two of slaw mix, sliced red bell and mushrooms as well. Instead of oranges (canned mandarin oranges are virtually tasteless), I added some fresh pineapple bits--gave it a nice tang. Great salad!

I took the OC cooks suggestion and used the flavored rice vinegar with less sugar - had a nice taste. I added 2 large mangos, 3 nectarines, 2 avocados and shredded rotisserie chicken. My husband loved this salad and he's a very picky eater. This one is a keeper!

My friends and I were talking about how much we love spinach salads, so for the next that we got together I came to epicurious.com for a new spinach salad. This was easy to make and very tasty. The salad didn't last for too long; it was inhaled! However, I was in a pinch and didn't have Ramen noodles, so I substituted chow mein noodled for them.

I love this recipe. I have made it countless times. The only change I make is to use 1/2 peanut oil and 1/2 vegetable oil in the dressing. I saute the noodles,etc in veg oil. Once i used pine nuts instead of almonds. It's always so well received

Rating: 4
The texture and flavors of this salad are simply wonderful! I was surprised that the ramen noodles took on such a nice flavor after being toasted in the olive oil. I tweaked it just a bit, by adding more sugar to the dressing, and an extra tablespoon rice wine vinegar, as we it a little sweeter. Also used mixed greens instead of spinach. Next time I'll take other reviewers advice and subtitute some sesame oil in the dressing. Served the salad with marinated sirloin kabobs w/ mushrooms and cherry tomatoes, and couscous. This recipe earns my very first "4" rating on Epicurious-- excellent taste and very quick to make.

This salad was a huge hit at my house! I do think the dressing is better with seasoned rice vinegar instead of regular rice vinegar. If you use seasoned rice vinegar, cut the sugar back by one tablespoon. I eliminated the almonds (I did toast the noodles and sesame seeds), instead I tossed in glazed walnuts which I purchased in the produce section of our grocery store (so incredibly good). I also added the mandarin oranges and the red bell pepper as suggested by other reviewers, excellent recommendation! Excellent salad.

I appreciated the review from the asian chicken salad with roasted peanuts (Super Salad) that lead me to this recipe. I added pork and chopped red & yellow peppers (leftovers in fridg). Cut the oil to 3 1/2 TBL olive & added 1 1/2 TBL sesame oil. Sugar reduced to 2 TBL. I added a touch of water to the end of the noodles, just to soften them. Great and fast dish.

Would be bumped up to three forks with some additions. I thought I would try it "as is" the first time but I can see that it definitely needs some more ingredients to give it a balance of flavors and textures.

WOW!! What a delicious salad. I have made this salad a few times and gaurantee if you follow my suggestions you will die over this salad! First, I only used 2 T of oil to heat the Ramen noodles and mixed the Oriental seasoning packet in with the noodles. WOW!!! Delicious! I used 1 bag of broccoli and slaw mixture and threw in just a handful of spinach. I also used 4 green onions, one can of manderine oranges (drained), 1/2 red bell pepper (julianne), 1/2 cup peanuts and cooked diced chicken breasts (you can certainly buy the pre-cooked breast slices). Toss this all together. My dressing was 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4+ cup rice vinegar, 1 T sesame seeds, 1/2 t black pepper, and only 1T canola oil. Whisk the dressing together, pour over salad dressing. Add prepared ramen noodles. Toss. Serve. AMAZING!!!!! The dressing is much lighter and tastier then what is given for this recipe. DELICIOUS!!! We love it!!!

This was great, though I used a few variations: I toasted the nuts and ramen in sesame oil and added mandarin oranges and grilled chicken (to make it a main course). I think next time I'll use less oil in the dressing and fewer green onions - the onion flavor was overwhelming at times. This will definitely become a regular in my house.

Have made a variation of this salad for several years that I think improves it. Substitute peanut oil for olive oil in the dressing, and heat the dressing ingredients for a few minutes--just til the sugar melts, then cool. Use sesame oil to saute crunchy ingredients. And substitute chopped Napa cabbage for spinach. It's more work to wash, dry, and chop the Napa--but worth it.

This is an excellent salad - have made it many times. Have also made it with a few revisions: sliced fresh white mushrooms and fresh orange segments added to the salad, and to the dressing I reduced the amount of olive oil and added 2 Tbsp sesame oil, 1 clove of garlic finely grated, and a 1/2" piece of ginger root finely grated. This dressing is excellent, especially if you let the flavours blend for a while before using. Love the combination of the toasted noodles, almonds and sesame seeds. Overall, an excellent mixture of complex flavours with a lovely crunchy texture. This salad is a real winner!!! Oh,forgot to mention: also used the dressing as a marinade while grilling chicken breasts, then sliced and served atop the salad for a summer supper. Simply delicious!!!

This is a regular staple in our house now. While this incarnation is the best, I have also subbed garlic for the green onions, or hazelnuts, peanuts or pecans for the almonds, and it always turns out delicious.

I thought this salad was delicious! Everyone loved it, but I thought the dressing was a little too sweet. Next time I make it I will use a little LESS sugar. I served it with a small piece of marinated grilled salmon as a first course. It would also be good with chicken or grilled shrimp!

No, I wouldn't make it again with spinach, but yes I would with shredded cabbage. Loved the dressing flavors and everything else, just feel that cabbage lends itself to the crunchiness of the rest of the ingredients and I found the spinach to be boring. Love spinach, but prefer it in other salads....... KIMBER

I made this for our Blue and Gold Scout banquet last night and instead of spinach I used a bag of coleslaw cabbage(saved on chopping). It is always a hit and I have learned to print out the recipe before I go because I am always asked for it. It is also very good with chopped chicken, I look forward to the salmon and spinach. Good idea! Canned or smoked or poached?

Great mixture of texture and taste. Could use other types of nuts as well. Agree with previous reviewer about addition of chicken for complete meal...salmon would work as well. Definitely will make again as it is so easy.

Nice general recipe. I prefer a lighter dressing for salads, however, and next time around will half the dressing which tended to mask the fresh spinach rather than enhance it. It is also a bit sweet,so I may reduce the amount of sugar as well. A dash of red pepper gave it some depth. May be good with grilled chicken breast as a meal unto itself.

This is a wonderful salad that has rapidly become a favorite of everyone that tries it. The bowl is always empty.

My family loved this recipe. I substituted red wine vinegar for rice wine vinegar. At the end of the meal the salad bowl was empty. Always a good sign!

This is an excellent, easy to make spinach. The dressing has a nice flavor and the ramen noodles and almonds are an interesting addition. I didn't add the green onions.

This is so easy and fast. I added diced oranges for color and sweetness. It goes well with any kind of stir fry. I would not plan on keeping any leftovers. The noodles get limp and greens wilt.
