A perfect addition to the Thai-style potstickers also on this site. The sauce is easy to make and incredible - spicy without setting me on fire, a great balance of sweet, sour, and spicy.

This is so simple, yet so fantastic! I doubled the Thai pepper because I love Thai sauces with more heat. Thanks, Epicurious, for having the best food site!

This sauce is great. A must have with Gai Yang. I cooked it for just a few minutes longer after I added all the ingredients to thicken it up a bit and incorporate the flavors. It tastes better warm than at room temp. I never knew how easy it was to make.

Excellent! An absolute must with Thai chicken. Just a perfect combination of sweet and spicy. Even guests who are afraid of 'hot' loved it. Will definitely make it again.

Really great recipe - I used finely chopped green & red chilies instead of flakes, and used it as a dipping sauce for barbecued, marinated chicken drummettes at a cocktail party - it was a real hit & they disappeared almost instantaneously! (I made it quite spicy, so if using as a dip, consider having a non-spicy alternative like thai peanut sauce as well).

Very tasty and easy - just like the stuff in the restaurant!

THIS IS A KEEPER! Used on grilled chicken as suggested and it made the meal. I will try other things to use this sauce with, as it seems it could be a versatile, tasty addition to other dishes.

I love this recipe! I tried it with distilled vinegar and then with apple cider vinegar another time. The distilled vinegar was much better because it didn't give too much "tang" as the apple cider vinegar did! Excellent dipping sauce for sticky rice!

This dipping sauce is perfect with the chicken. A big hit. I would think it would be great with shrimp or fish as well.

This dish is tangy with just the right bite when used with the Thai grilled chicken. I tried this in my Hot and Sour Soup recipe and it really livens up the soup, My family loves it!!!

I am anxious to try this with shrimp. It's sweet, it's sour, and it has a little bite. My family loved it!
