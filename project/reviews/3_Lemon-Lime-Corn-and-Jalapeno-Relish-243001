I wish I'd checked the reviews first. As I discovered, the proportions were off...way off. Not enough corn, and way too much oil. The rinds were like little slices of shoe leather. My end product did not look like the photo in any way, shape,or form. Boo-appetit for their dud.

This is a good idea, but I can tell you without even preparing the recipe that you need to increase corn to 4 ears, and blanch it first (or grill it right in it's husk for about 15 minutes)...zest citrus, and reduce olive oil to about 1/4 cup. Salt and pepper to taste!

I am making this for weekend company. I first discovered the recipe last summer and it got rave reviews from family and friends. I zested the citrus rinds rather than peeling and slicing, however. The idea of chewing through the peel wasn't very appetizing to me. I served it over swordfish kabobs with Vidalia onions. Sublime, healthy summer recipe!

I thought the taste was great however I had to make this for a huge group therefore I needed to multiply the recipe by a lot. Like another reviewer wrote, the quantities were way off. I had to drain a lot of the oil and juice out...way too much and it made it soupy. Next time I'll dress it less.

Okay, I am the person who wrote the bad review below. And now I feel the need to change it (although I still believe the quantities listed in the recipe are way off.) After a few days, I dumped out all of the oil I could and sauteed the relish with shrimp. I then filled some corn tortillas with the mixture, sour cream, avocado and cabbage. It was absolutely delicious--but I definitely had to modify the recipe as written.

I must say I am mystified by the rave reviews. I love all the ingredients, but was really disappointed. Also, what is with the amounts in this recipe? They are obviously way off--ie. 2 ears of corn do NOT fit into 1 cup, a scant 1/2 cup of jalapenos is more like 2, not 4... (was I using mutant produce?) and what's with all the olive oil?? I reduced the amount, increased the corn, and the whole thing is STILL swimming in oil! It's pretty gross.

extra yummy, especially on pan fried halibut.

I liked this, but I had issues with the corn being raw. Although I used very fresh, in-season corn, I thought it was a little on the chewy side. The next day, I had some grilled fish on hand so I sauteed a little of the salsa to take the raw edge off, then added the chunked fish to warm it, and put it into homemade fresh corn tortillas. Now *that* was good.

Great recipe, I was surprised that it wasn't that spicy, but since I guess that al depends on the jalapenos that you use. Definitely let it sit at least 2 hours and I would recommend over night as it was even better this morning...
