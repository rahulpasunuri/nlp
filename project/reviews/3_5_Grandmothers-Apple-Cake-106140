This is a favorite "go-to" recipe to bake up for a brunch party. I use one more apple in the recipe, but an extra pear works as well. It is best made in advance.

I am always looking for simple apple cake recipes. This was fairly simple but very bland and i would not make it again. As previously stated, it is WAY too much batter for an 8 inch cake pan. I thought it looked fishy but left it in there, and yes, it overflowed. I would suggest, if you must make this, to use a 9 inch springform. overall, it was just bland and perhaps a little spongy/oily. Not what i was looking for and i would not bother with it again, there are better recipes out there.

I thought this was quite yummy! And a great way to use up some of our apples from apple picking. I did make a few changes - I only had 1/3 cup of strawberry yogurt so I used that and 1/3 cup of sour cream. I somehow missed the mention of cinnamon in the recipe so as I was about to pour it in the pan it occured to me that it was lacking spice. I added 1 tsp. of cinnamon and 1 tsp. of vanilla. I also used 6 northern spy apples instead of the golden delicious. It could have used the extra tsp. of cinnamon but other than that it was delicious, very moist and flavorful.

I always check the reviews before I go ahead with any recipe. I have to say, I had a problem with some of your suggestions. Firsr off the batter is too much for a 8" cake pan, correct, so I used a removable bottom cheesecake pan. The batter fit fine and did not overflow. I do suggest a tube or bundt pan. Second, I added 2 extra apples as suggested. My finished cake came out underdone in the center. I think because it was too moist/dense with the extra apples and I used the wrong pan. I SUGGEST, either following the recipe exactly or using a different pan, ie. bundt or tube pan. This will allow the cake to cook trough in the center. I was very disappointed with the finished product, although my guest said it was good. I think they wanted to be polite. It wouldn't be fair for me to rate this recipe as I did not follow it exactly.

Thanks Granny....delicious! It is moist and appley and gets better the longer it is kept... Next time I will experiment, as some others did, with extra fruit, nuts and some other alcohol.

Thanks to suggestions of previous reviewers, I made a few changes - more applies, no Calvados, less cinnamon and a little nutmeg. Added chopped walnuts and a handful of dried currants. Very good, and a hit at a small dinner party.

I've made this recipe 3 times- it's a delicious cake. I leave out the Calvados, and it still turns out great. In the mix at the end I have taken to stirring in walnuts that I glazed quickly in a pan with melted butter and sugar. It is like an eastern european cake. I took it to a christmas holiday party last year and everyone just loved it. I'd really recommend it.

Why doesn't this recipe have any salt in it? I liked this cake very much, but will add just a bit of salt next time, since I found it slightly flat tasting. Based on many other comments, I used more apples (4 medium) and a Bundt pan. Next time I'll grease and flour it better, too, since it stuck. I also used cognac instead of Calvados (don't think it made any difference) and just a bit of ground ginger in with the cinnamon. Very, very moist and cinnamon-y. Delicious!

If you can stand it wait three days to eat the cake! It just gets better and better. The second time around I used frozen blueberries. Just sauteed a half bag in a pan with the butter. Lots of juice came out so I thicken with cornstarch. Worked beautifully. Try it. Actually the possiblilites are endless when you think about it. I skipped the brandy. And I sprinkled it liberally before I baked it with that coarse sugar.

Rating: 4
As ever I always read the reviews before I make a recipe. I added more apples and sprinkled coarse sugar on top to give it a bakery look. The following day I thought it was just okay. But the next day it was over the top! So feel free to make it two days ahead. Won't know what the third day would be like because it is all gone! Next time I think I will cut the apples into smaller chunks but it really doesn't matter. Since I couldn't find my cinnamon I used pumpkin pie spice with a splash of cardiman. Your grandmother would be proud!

Yummy!! This is a simple, delicious apple cake. I have made it several times and I pretty much follow the recipe. I do use more like 3 or 4 apples (usually granny smith, or whatever I have on hand), and I skip the brandy--it's just not my thing. Also, I sometimes add a bit of applesauce to make it really moist. I love to serve it warm with whipped cream and a cup of tea!

Whoever when writing this recipe suggesting the 8" cake pan-hadn't made it! Go with the other readers and their bundt pans - MUCH easier and less messy! Very nice coffee cake and not very sweet; I like that!

I had lots of apples that I wanted to use up, so I put 5 into this cake and baked in a springform pan. Delicious way to use up apples that are past their prime.

I added many more apples,and a pinch of cardamon, nutmeg and salt to the mix. I used 1 cup of sugar and maple yogurt from Brown Cow. As it was cooling, I realized I forgot the oil! Didn't matter -- still a moist, not too sweet cake!

Delicious, moist and dense! I used about 6 large apples for the cake and kirsch (cherry brandy) instead of Calvados. Turned out great! Then I caramelized some more apples with butter, brown sugar and kirsch for about 15 minutes and then pureed the mixture in a blender with cream cheese and plain yogurt for a tangy apple cream topping. So yummy.

Rating: 4
Very good, simple recipe. Perfect for breakfast. I upped the apples to 5 (they were medium), and used Cointreu instead of Calvados since I didn't have any on hand. Still very good. I'd decrease the sugar to 3/4 of a cup at most.

First time rater, long time "Epicurious User". Well, here's the deal-- I read all of the other reviews and decided to take some advice. I used more apples (good thing) and a larger pan (bundt pan), and added a bit of salt. I was actually looking for an apple cake which I recently had at an Agritourism villa in Italy. This was not an exact or even near substitute but neverthe less, it was very good. My husband thought it was great. Probably because it wasn't so sweet or gooey as some cakes can be and he doesn't have the sweet tooth that I am burdened with. However, next time and there will be a next time mainly because it was so easy and not fattening, I will try a square pan and possibly put a crumb topping on it. I'll try jacking up the sweetness score. But now does anyone have any suggestions on how to put the flour and eggs in? Should they be alternated and added like that? What I did was put all the flour in to the yogurt and sugar combo and it nearly broke my poor little wisk! Then I added the eggs and things were again copasetic. (Spelling, anyone?) The other suggestion I have is to not fall asleep while cooking it which is what I did, Then the topping was a bit crunchy. Anyhow that ended up being the bottom so it didn't rreally matter anyhow. And because I was so tired and it was late when I made it I left it in the pan overnite and really had to struggle to get it out of the pan in the morning, so don't do that! I then served it at a little brunch (brave, wasn't I) with a bit of confectioner's sugar on top and some crocusses in a little glass in the middle and everyone loved it. So, whew! that's my story. Sorry for being so long winded, but I'll cut it short-- I got to go and finish eating that cake. Till the next time...

Really good recipe. I have made it with apples and have substituted mangoes and pears. Really yummy!

Quite good. I used about 6 apples, and I should have used 10 or 12 and just really let them cook down. Cooked it in a bundt pan and it came out perfectly.

Moist and delicious! I used a bundt pan for it though, because i couldn't imagine using a small little round cake pan. I also added 3 more small apples - for a total of 5. When frying the apples i used brown sugar instead of white. My grandmother used to make the best apple cake when i was a little girl, and this one is just as good.

Delicious and easy. I put mine in a large bundt pan. I would not recommend baking it in a 9 inch cake pan... too small. My eight-year-old son insisted I put this as a four fork recipe.

A wonderful old fashioned apple cake, that is moist and full of flavor. I added an extra apple, per other reviews, and all recipients begged for more.

I misplaced a fabulous Jewish Apple Cake recipe. If anyone has it, please send it to me! This one leaves me totally flat. It needs much more apples, much more cinnamon, and a crumb topping, not the awful oatmeal streusel suggested by a member. Also, I reduced the sugar as one member suggested, because I do not like overly-sweet cakes. What a mistake...not sweet enough.

Rating: 3
This cake was absolutely delicious and I will definitely make it again, but DO NOT USE AN 8-INCH PAN!! I did, and there was far too much batter. Gobs of it poured over the sides during baking. I'm planning to use a ten-inch springform the next time I make this cake, just to be on the safe side. At a minimum, use a 9-inch. Other than that, fantastic! And definitely improves with age.

Rating: 4
I love this cake. The cooks who thought the apple taste didn't come through may not have sauteed the apples long enough. 5-7 minutes is not long enough on my range. It takes more like 15 minutes on low-medium flame, until the apple slices are truly golden brown and maybe are forming a bit of a crunchy crust (be careful not to let them burn). The extensive sauteeing carmelizes the apples and really brings out their flavor.

Rating: 2
This cake turned out OK. Followed the recipe to the letter. The sponge WAS moist and light but a bit bouncy in texture. However the overall taste was well a little bland. I agree with the previous reviewer who said they couldn't taste the apple. I loved the sound of this cake but it was no more than the sum of its parts.

Delicious and moist. Definitely a cut above typical cakes. Made it just as instructed except used regular brandy (don't have calvados) and baked for 55 minutes. Will make this again.

I have made this cake several times over the past months. I'll be making it again this weekend for a friend's 50 birthday party. I've made the cake for parties and for pot luck lunches at work. It always gets rave reviews. So easy to make which is a real plus for me since my skills in the baking department are truly lacking. I think I put more apples than called for. No problem. The first time I made it I used apples from a neighbors tree. The apples were small and I think basically some wild un-named hybrid type. Who knows. They worked just fine. I've used Gala and Granny Smith too. I don't think it really matters what type of baking apple one uses. I use apple danish flavored yogurt and cut the cinnamon in half. I use top of the line French calvados; (Daron brand $40.00 a bottle here in Nashville.) Try this recipe. It's truly easy and truly good. Enjoy.

Excellent and easy - my whole family loved this cake. I used vanilla yogurt instead of plain (only because I didn't have any) and increased the amount of cinnamon. I made this in a bundt pan (still only took about 45 minutes to cook) and sprinkled a bit of raw sugar on the top, so the bottom had a nice crunchiness to it. Lovely with homemade vanilla ice cream, but perfect all by itself as well. A keeper.

This cake was very moist and yummy! I didn't have any apple brandy so I omitted it and the cake was fine. There was a lot of batter, so I also baked mine in a 9 x 13 pan- generously greased and floured. (Not sure how all that was going to fit into an 8 inch cake pan anyway). Only needed to bake 35 minutes. Turned out perfect. Very good with a cup of coffee in the morning.

Do not listen to a single negative comment about this cake! It was the best non-chocolate cake I've ever had. It was so moist, not dry at all. I didn't have any yogurt so I used light sour cream. I also didn't have any calvados, so I skipped it. If I was to change anything at all I personallly would use a tad less sugar. Aside from that it's perfect!

This is my husband's favorite thing, breakfast, dessert, whatever! A wonderful dish to make in the late fall, very quick and delicious. Don't overcook, because it isn't as good once dry, and don't eat for a day or too - the longer it sits the better! I highly rec. whipping up some cream with a dash of calvados on top! Yum!

We have an Amity teacher from Barcelona living with us this year. She brought her mother's cake recipe (in Spanish) with her. I tried to make it twice with no success (FYI, levadura is NOT yeast). Then I searched on epicurious.com and found this recipe. This is it! Omit the apples and use lemon yogurt and you have mother's cake. Our Amity scholar was SO happy!

Would have liked to rate this 2.5 forks. It's definitely an easy cake, but we were a bit disappointed with the flavor as it just wasn't as appley as we'd have liked. The texture was nice and I put it together in a snap -- both definite plusses. I followed the directions precisely, but next time (I will give it a second try) I'll add an extra apple and see if that makes a difference.

Had no cake pans,so I used a 9x13 pyrex baking dish. I was worried there wouldn't be enough batter for the baking dish, but it turned out just right. Plus, I only had to bake it for 35 min. Used 1/2 lowfat sour cream,1/2 yogurt. Used granny smith apples. And brandy. Came out really good. My only suggestion would be to add a pinch of salt to bring out the flavors a little more.

This wonderfully delicious and moist apple cake is now a favorite in our house. My husband adored it, and a good friend who was visiting when I made it, said, don't change anything about this recipe, it's perfect. I agree. It's the easiest and best apple cake I've made so far, and is definitely one that will be passed down through my family recipe cookbook. It also makes a lovely cake for serving at an afternoon tea. Thank you Alexandra Leaf and Fred Leeman -Van Gogh's Table for this delightful recipe.

Easy & yummy. One tip: Grease pan with butter and sprinkle flour over bottom and sides, knocking off excess flour - this hasn't failed yet in getting that cake perfectly out of the pan. I substituted with 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, fat free yogurt and Japanese plum liquer because I didn't have brandy. Also used 1 Red Delicious, 2 Gala and 1 Granny Smith apples. Baked in an 8 inch square pan for 1 hr 10mins, and it turned out moist. Didn't overflow the pan like some reviewers mentioned. All in all, one of my more successful baking efforts :-).

This cake was wonderful! It is a simple cake, but perfect for tea or for a snack. If I were to serve it to guests after a dinner, I would serve it with a side of vanilla ice-creme or whipped creme. My cake came out wonderfully moist and took only 50 min. I suspect that the time for cooking may have alot to do with the type of yogurt used. I used Brown Cow regular (ie. not low fat) yogurt which is quite a thick, dry yogurt relative to others that I've used. I used half the cinammon and brandy (rather than calvados). Definitely a recipe I'll use again!

i agree wholeheartedly with the previous reviewer. the only change needed to this recipe is the cooking time. thanks to the reviewers who suggested a larger pan, made the cake in a bundt pan. served it with a little vase with daisies in the middle, (a la my big fat greek wedding) got a chuckle from the kids and husband. hey, thanks to the reviewer from l.a. whose oatmeal topping i used. it was a big hit! don't know how a couple of cooks got a dry cake from this recipe. it was way moist, even with the cooking time increased to over an hour. wonderful cake, and so easy. will become a staple.

this is a great recipe, everyone who ate it enjoyed it. one change to the recipe that i would make is the time to bake. if the cake pan is placed on a sheet pan to cook, it definitely needs at least one hour to cook. it varies on the oven, but i had to cook it exactly for an hour and ten minutes. otherwise, the cake came out delicious and moist.

Well this is the apple cake recipe for the permanent file. This is the type of recipe that you steal from your Grandmother's hidden recipe files, covered in smears of cinnamon and touches of batter. I love the fact that it is put together in one bowl, with a whisk. No electric mixers or fancy steps. I read the reviews and went with a 9-inch by 3-inch round cake pan. I lined it (Maida Heatter style) with foil that was lightly sprayed with cooking oil. This way the cake cooled in the pan for 30 minutes, then I lifted it out to a cooling rack. I also topped it with a favorite streusel topping and it was the perfect touch to a lovely cake. Sweet, filled with apple chunks, but not too sweet or too spicy. A keeper. Perfect with a tall glass of milk, or even fancy enough to serve with coffee and tea.

I followed the recipe to a "T" and also followed the test kitchen advice, but the cake tasted floury. I made two as gifts but decided against giving them. I'd say I'm a good cook with a lot of experience, and I can't figure out why my cake came out like this.

I had to bake this for an hour and twenty minutes until the cake tester came out dry, but the cake was still moist and deliciously fragrant! I agree that an 8" cake pan is too small. Next time I will try a bundt pan, I think. For dessert last night I served it with creme fraiche that I had flavored with a splash of vanilla extract and just a sprinkle of sugar. It was a good, tart foil for the cake. Am waiting to hear reviews from my colleagues for the leftovers today!

I made this cake with buttermilk instead of yogurt as well, and also added an oatmeal crumb topping made up of 1/3 c flour, 1/3 c brown sugar, 1/2 c oats, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 3 tbsp butter - served for brunch as coffee cake. Really really good!

I was looking for a pear cake and used this recipe. I used buttermilk because I didn't have yogurt. I made the batter, without fruit. I mixed the pears with a bit of flour and the sugar and cinnamon. I put half the batter in the pan, then the pears, then batter, and baked. It was excellent.

This is a wonderful cake. It is delicious and the texture is great--moist and tender. This is one of the best apple cakes I have ever made, and is very simple to put together. The amount of batter does seem better suited to a 9 inch pan (I doubled the recipe and wound up with enough batter to make three fairly high 8 inch cakes).

This is the third apple cake recipe I've tried from epicurious, and my favorite. Very very moist and a wonderful appley taste. I used non-fat yogurt with no noticable problem. I would say, however, that this should be baked in a 9 inch cake pan - I did mine in an 8 inch as the recipe tells you to do, and it spilled over the top quite a bit. But I'll definitely be making it again. Simple as can be too!

Very good, I thought I might have overbaked it at almost 50 minutes but it was moist and delicious. I used granny smith apples; family consensus was that next time we will add just a pinch of salt. Definitely will make again.
