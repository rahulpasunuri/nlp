I regularly make this dish. I grow Thai basil every year (not anise but it's close enough). I have ferral lemonbalm in my garden so sub that for the lemon basil. It is always tasty. I usually grow some chilies every year and use any kind I have except Habanero. Thought I might try it with some rice noodle...mmmmmm

I couldn't find the 2 types of Thai basil, so I used regular Italian basil. Other than that I followed the recipe. It was fantastic. I am going to serve it to company next time. The key, is to use garden tomatoes, not store bought. The sauce is fresh and fragrant. I have made the sauce alone and used it to dress other Thai-style salads. This is a winner.

This was great--my husband really loved it. The only thing I'd change is not to use the chile seeds--they were too hot for us. This is a light, tasty salad that is perfect for summer. We had great tomatoes, which I think is necessary for this to work.

Great with little bay shrimp and grape tomatoes. I used garlic, lime, fish sauce, and sugar in the dressing and I also just had dried basil. It was still a very nice basis for a salad even if you don't have quite all the ingredients. The lime, fish sauce, and bit of sugar in the dressing are definitely key. I've got lemongrass in a squeeze tube which works pretty well.

Excellent salad.....wonderful flavor. I didn't have good lemongrass, so I left that out, and I used Italian basil instead of the two specialty basils. Received rave reviews and many recipe requests at a potluck. Making it for dinner again tonight.

The only positive taste note in this salad was heat from the hot peppers. Otherwise it was totally undistinguished.
