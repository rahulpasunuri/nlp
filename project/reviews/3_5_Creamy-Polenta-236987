Made the changes most suggested here and added a few of my own - it was fabulous! Used 1/2 milk and 1/2 chick broth. Much like a favorite restaurant from years ago, served with a healthy dollop of pesto in the center, surrounded by slices of tomato around the edge, and topped with thin slices of a good cheese (I used bits of fresh mozza) that melted into the whole thing. Absolutely sublime! Served as a main dish with baguette toast and a salad.

I did cut the recipe in half, but when I was finished it just tasted like butter.

Definitely add 1/2 milk, 1/2 chicken broth in place of the water. Cooking is easier and faster by using a double boiler - only 25 minutes. If you can't serve it immediately, try adding more milk to the pot without stirring it in. Leave the double boiler on the lowest heat and stir the milk in just before serving. Yum.

I got a grain mill for our Kitchen-Aide mixer for a Christmas present. Wow! I snagged some field corn on the cob from a feed store (AKA "Horse Corn"). I shelled it and ground some fresh, coarse corn meal. I used the ingredients in this recipe, but I did it in a crock pot, cooking on low overnight. Next morning, done and creamy smooth.I poured it into a loaf pan and cooled, then chilled. Sliced and grilled, sauteed, or backed is awesome!

Turned out fluffy and tasty once I "fixed it" a couple of times. As other reviewers did, used 1/2 2% milk and 1/2 broth. Maybe my mistake was that I brought it to a boil before I turned it down to simmer? I needed to thin it out with water a few times during the cooking process (that took way less than 45 min). Will make again and try a mushroom ragu over it (had pork with cherry sauce).

Yes yes yessss, this is a heavenly base for whatever sauce or topping you can whip up, and a super easy way to prepare it. Definitely do 1/2 milk 1/2 stock thang, much creamier and way more flavorful. And despite what the other reviewer says, do NOT skimp on your quality of polenta/cornmeal. I splurged on freshly milled cornmeal at the farmers market, and at the risk of sounding like the biggest bougie you've ever heard, it is indeed the most delightful and thrilling polenta I've ever had. When's the last time you ever thought polenta was thrilling? That's right, I thought so. Do yourself a favor, get fancy polenta!

Very good recipe. "Polenta" is a dish, "cornmeal" is its ingredient (as well as other ground grains, such as buckwheat), even though plain cornmeal is sold marked as "polenta" with, of course, a higher price. All that is needed is very good quality cornmeal....no need to buy the "gourmet" products labeled "Polenta".

Wow, this was so creamy and delicious! I follow reviewer suggestion and made from 'cold' start; used half milk and half chicken broth in place of water. I really like the cooking method. When the polenta was finished cooking, I added 1 C grated cheese and about 1 tsp dried thyme. This will definitely be the recipe I 'go to' for soft polenta. This was a side dish for BA Spanish Crusted Roast Pork Tenderloin (wonderful).

Polenta is a wonderful food. This recipe seems to be the building block. I'd suggest a couple of things, however. First, I'd suggest substituting broth for water. A vegetable, chicken, fish or beef broth adds a wonderful dimension to the flavor and better links the polenta to the main dish. Second, I'd recommend experimenting with adding your favorite enhancements, such as sauteed mushrooms, basil, or cheeses, late in the cooking process. It seems to me that it's difficult to go wrong with this basic recipe and it's fun to adapt it to your family's tastes over time.

I used cornmeal from the baking aisle and it turned out great! Also reheats in the microwave with a bit of water really well.

Simple, Delicious, have made it again and again. Always a great side dish.

Wow! this is the first polenta recipe that worked the way it was supposed to for me. Usually the polenta cooks way too fast. I used the polenta they sell in the bulk bin at Whole Foods and cooked it for an entire 45 minutes. (I actually prefer doing this with grits for example.) The polenta really was "creamy."

Wow, great comfort food and so easy. I, too, used the cold water method (substituting a can of chicken stock for a portion of that) then stirred in a cup of pecorino romano cheese once off the heat. Topped with a creamy mushroom sauce, this simple dish is hard to beat!

First time to try polenta. Have a new love. Followed other reviews and made with broth and milk and started cold. Added some parmesan cheese and topped with sauted shitake mushrooms. Awesome!

I used 1/2 milk and 1/2 chicken stock and added Italian Spices, Garlic Pepper, and grated parmesan cheese. It was great!

Try this instead and save yourselves as lot of time: Soft Polenta 2 quarts water 2 Tablespoons butter 2 teaspoons salt 2 Tablespoons minced parsley 2 cups coarse-ground cornmeal Combine water, salt, cornmeal and butter in a 3 to 4 quart ovenproof saucepan (I use large clear Pyrex bowl). Bake in preheated 350-degree oven 1 hour and 20 minutes. Stir polenta and bake 10 more minutes. Remove from oven and set aside 5 minutes to rest before serving. To serve, spoon polenta into each of 6 warmed shallow bowls. Spoon sauce of your choice and garnish with parsley if desired.

Three forks with modifications. I always start polenta in cold water - it allows the starch to expand more making it creamier. Also start with 1/2 milk and 1/2 chicken broth for flavor and creaminess.

Just a not to the last reviewer, yes it works quite well starting with the cold water. And yes I start my oatmeal - cream of wheat, (even grits!) this way, and it comes out much creamier, and as long as you stir from time to time, there's no problem with clumping! give it a try!

This is a very reliable recipe for polenta. The beauty of polenta is you can be really inventive, adding seasonings, cheese, it's always delicious! To the person who starts with cold water, I have never heard of that for making polenta. Wouldn't it take longer, and clump? Making polenta is like making oatmeal or cream of wheat, and you start with boiling water or scalded milk to make them.

I made this for New Year's Eve with the polenta. Big hit! I made the beef early in the day & re-heated it so it was perfect for entertaining. Also I loved how I could walk away from the polenta for 10 minutes & not worry. My guests wanted the recipes. I served them with roasted brussel sprouts & everything got raves.

I subbed the water with chicken broth and reduced the salt. I'd give it 2 1/2 forks. It's nothing inspiring, but it's simple and tastes good.

A good and basic recipe for beautiful polenta. Hardest part: finding coarse corn meal in Southern California. Finally found it at Whole Foods, almost $4.00/lb. Ouch. Also, am I the only person who stirs polenta into cold salted water, slowly bring it to a boil, stirring until it thickens? So much easier than stirring into boiling water. Good results.
