I used at least 2 cups of pecans--my Dad's favorite pie is pecan and he said this is the best one he ever had. Easy and delicious!

too sweet. i tried adding salt and orange zest and reducing sugar, but it was just way too sweet. i even upped the pecans but left the other ingredients the same. i have had other pecan pies, but this one was over the top in terms of sweetness. i will not make this again.

I actually increased the filling by another half as the first time I made this recipe, the filling was a little thin after baking. I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of zest of tangerine to the filling and it was really amazing! It added some roundness to the sweetness of the filling. I also recommend covering the crust with foil to keep it from being too brown.

Based on other reviews, I added a generous pinch of salt and a very heft glug of bourbon. And based on my own slobbering over the prospect of cramming as many pecans per bite as possible into my, er, piehole, I increased the nuts. ZOMGOMGWTFBBQ goooooooood. Multiplying the recipe 1.5X was a perfect fit for the 2 standard size, frozen pre-fab pie crusts I used. Super easy recipe, but that was expected, having lazied out on the crusts.

YUMMY...I made this last year for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit...and yes it's sweet. It's now standard fare at our Thanksgiving table. I added a few more pecans also.

I use a different recipe for the pie crust...the cook"s illustrated recipe for foolproof pie dough. Being Canadian I love the idea of using maple syrup. It is the best pecan pie my entire extended family has ever tasted. I have made it several times. A real winner!!

I went to make a traditional pecan pie for a surprise visit from my brother and found I didn't have enough Karo syrup. After checking my pantry for a substitute and finding an unopened bottle of maple syrup, I found this recipe and am so happy I did. It was so well received and both my brother and my husband said that it was the best pecan pie I had ever made. Great recipe.

I have made this several times for a real southern crowd and it is always a big hit. The maple syrup is a great ingredient that is used in place of corn syrup in many other pecan pie recipes. I recently started adding about a shot of bourbon to the liquid before pouring it on the pecans and it gives it a great added richness.

I made this Thanksgiving morning, it was easy and very delicious. I toasted the pecans first, used Trader Joe's pie crust, grade B dark amber maple syrup and add a big pinch of kosher salt. It wasn't as sweet as I expected based on other reviews and we enjoyed every bite.

Rating: 4
A fantastic pecan pie. The maple really makes it special. One key correction to the recipe - it needs salt to cut the sugar. Even if you use salted butter, you may need to add a dash more kosher salt.

Rating: 4
I know a lot of reviewers think this pie is too sweet, but I disagree. It's a pecan pie - it's SUPPOSED to be super-sweet! I used the full amounts of sugar, although a bit more pecans than the recipe called for -- I chopped half of them, and left the rest whole. I also used a refrigerated pie cruse (the kind that comes rolled up) in a deep-dish pie pan. I find that frozen crusts can come out goopy and gooey on the bottom of custard pies, whereas the refrigerated pie crusts come out crisp. The maple flavor in this pie is just incredible, and a unique change from traditional pecan pie. I made two pumpkin pies and one of these...this pie was gone in minutes, whereas I still have 1 1/2 pumpkin pies sitting in my fridge. If you are a fan of pecan pies, this one will knock your socks off! If you find it to be too sweet for your tastes, I suggest serving some whipped cream made with only a tiny bit of sugar. This will cut the sweet, and add a nice creaminess.

checking in after Thanksgiving to report this pie was a success and easy to boot. Only thing I messed up on was using a 9" regular crust vs the recommended deep dish. Filling bubbled over and I thought I was doomed, but luckily the pie was on a foil lined cookie sheet, and ended up looking fine in the end. I did cover the edges 1/2 way through and glazed the crust with an egg wash prior to filing...not sure it helped though with the run over....anyway, will probably give it another shot for x-mas. I like the look of the whole pecans, but found it a bit cumbersome to cut and eat, might chop them next time as well...

Rating: 2
Way too sweet. The only salvation I see for this would be to double the nuts and halve the custard, just so it flavors the nuts and makes them stick together.

Rating: 4
SO good. Everyone raved about it at my Thanksgiving dinner. Very sweet like a pecan pie generally is, but with a richer flavor because of the maple. I will definitely be making this again. SO easy. Next time I will use my own crust.

Amazing! and sooo easy to make. I used nearly a cup of brown sugar packed and no white sugar because I misread the recipe. (I wasn't trying to be "fancy' or anything, I just forgot to write down the white sugar all together) oh, and added a pinch of salt because every review complained about it being too sweet. It was fabulous!

very easy recipe, but you can use a little less maple syrup bc it comes out very sweet. also, i chopped the pecans in a food processor and then arrange pecan halves on top of the pie once i poured the filled into the crust. that way, it came out picturesque!

This was my first pecan pie. I cut the brown sugar to 1/2 c. packed plus 2 tbsp loose. I also used slightly less than 1/4 c. white sugar (all based on the previous reviews). I used supermarket pure maple syrup - grade A (not sure what the difference is between the grades but that's what the supermarket had). Then I stuck to the rest of the recipe and everyone loved it. I will make it again. Maybe even for Thanksgiving.

I was looking for a recipe for Jack Daniels Pecan Pie, but all I could find were recipes containing corn syrup -- yuk. I adapted this one and the results were outstanding. Here's what I did: (1) reduced the maple syrup (Grade B) to 3/4 cup (actually boiled it down, didn't just reduce the amount); (2) added 1/4 cup Jack Daniels Single-Barrel; (3) omitted the white sugar; (4) spread 1/2 cup bittersweet chocolate chips on the crust before the pecans; and (5) used the "Tender Pie Crust" from the July 2005 Bon Appetit instead of store-bought (substituting maple sugar for white). Oh, it was good!

After reading the other comments I decided to try using 1 cup of maple syrup, but using only 3/8 cup of brown sugar and 1/8 cup of white sugar. It was great. This is the way that I will make this pie again (and again).

Wonderful! I was looking for a pecan pie with no corn syrup (can't get that stuff here in ye olde worlde) and this was perfect, I will make it every time I make pecan pie. I didn't think it was too sweet as some other reviewers did. I made it just as the recipe said except I used my own crust in a 9 inch tart pan - made 2/3 of the filling and it was just right.

In our family, no Thanksgiving is complete without pecan pie--and this one is the hands down winner! The maple syrup adds a richer, deeper flavor that can't be beat. I make this recipe as written, serve with fresh whipped cream and ice cream, and it disappears without a crumb left.

Since everyone agrees that this recipe is a winner, I'm going to focus on what NOT to do. If you were raised on icky-sweet pecan pie (like I was) use this recipe AS IS, with NO changes. I thought I'd be smart and heed the advice of other reviewers who found the pie too sweet. However, removing the white and brown sugars is a mistake I won't repeat, making it too blah -- almost like it was "mass produced". Increasing the filling is also a mistake... it turns the filling into a custard with a texture that everyone found untraditional and disappointing. One more thing -- I used Grade A Amber, which is spectacular on waffles but is lost on this recipe. Next time I'll use Grade B, which is sweeter and smokier and will probably do this pie justice! I also recommend using syrup bought from the source (for example, Clark's Sugar House in Langdon NH ships it if you contact them at sugarhouse1@earthlink.net) but you can get it from any sugar house -- they're all pretty good. Yes, it's pricey, but I buy 3 gallons a year and it hasn't broken my bank account yet!!

Very very sweet a small slice goes a long way. Mine came out a little runny, so I dribbled the extra juice over vannila ice cream served with the warm pie. It was a hit with our friends.

This pie was super easy and DELICIOUS!! It looked a bit plain to me, so I whipped up some cream with a bit of the leftover maple syrup and served that on top. Everyone agreed that the whipped cream on top added a lot to the pie. Next time, though, I think I'd refrain from adding syrup to the cream. The pie is already VERY sweet, and plain whipped cream would provide a little better contrast to that sweetness, I believe. Anyway, this pie was a HUGE hit, and everyone asked for the recipe!

I was looking for a pecan pie recipe that did not call for corn syrup, and was delighted to find this fantastic recipe!

Everyone who has tried it loves it and says that the sugar is not to be missed. Enjoy!

Based on previous suggestions, I dropped the white sugar all together. I also used Grade B Vermont pure maple syrup, which cut down on the sweetness and added a cool smoky flavor. Then I pre-toasted the pecans for 5 minutes. I wouldn't do that again since I think the raw nuts would've soaked up more of the flavor. I left the pecans whole and took a minute to flip them all to the right side. Beautiful, yummy, and easy as pie...

I'm not sure if I'll every make a pecan pie another way again. It was excellent! The maple is a natural flavoring compliment. I used plain old Log Cabin pancake syrup and it was fine. I was worried about the amount of sugar the recipe calls for, but it was no sweeter than any other pecan pie. Thank goodness Christmas (and another excuse to make a pie) is right around the corner.

Rating: 3
I scoffed at those who said the pie was too sweet before making this, figuring pecan pie is supposed to be almost tooth-achingly sweet. Nonetheless, this really was too cloying (though a big dollop of whipped cream helped). Dad & husband loved it anyway, but next time I'd cut back on the sugar -- I'll follow the suggestions below -- to let the maple taste shine through. Also, used whole pecans and they floated to the top beautifully.

Pecan pie is my favorite, but I'de never made it, before. This turned out well but I would change a few things, next time. Fist, I would toast the pecans, a little, so they're a bit crunchy. Second, I think I would double the filling, (at least increase it, a bit). Finally, I DID head the advice to reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup and was happy I did. Served with bourbon whipped cream...mmmmm

I agree on cutting down the sugar. I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar, no white sugar, and it was still very sweet. I like the maple syrup flavor in this pecan pie though, so I would recommend making it!

This is a delicious and easy pecan pie recipe. The sweetness is just what I would expect from this pie. I made the pie with some maple syrup that I bought at a small érablerie on Ile d'Orléans in Québec and I would definitely use pure maple syrup again. After comparing the recipe with some others I also adjusted the recipe by adding 1 tablespoon of bourbon, eliminating the white sugar entirely and just using 1 cup of brown sugar. This recipe and the spiced pumpkin pie recipe I found on Epicurious will always grace my Thanksgiving table. Thank you!

I prepared this pie as written in recipe. It was so easy, my two year old helped. Overall, I thought the pie tasted excellent;HOWEVER, the maple flavor was completely negligent. I used Vermont grade A maple syrup. Next time, I will use grade B and/or add 1 teaspoon of maple extract. One guest said it tasted exactly like her grandmother's pecan pie made with corn syrup. I was disappointed that I had wasted a cup of real maple syrup!

Just before Thanksgiving I was hunting around for pie ideas and came across this recipe. I do not like pecan pie, but my whole family does and I decided to try this. I did not have as much pure maple syrup on hand as I thought I did, so I ended up having to use half dark caro. This turned out to be perfect. I did not actually have a piece, but the family said it was the best pecan pie they had ever had just the way it was. They all emphatically agreed that it would be much too sweet with all maple syrup. I will make again next year exactly the same way.

I made this for Thanksgiving '02 and even non-pecan pie eaters raved. I think the maple flavor is the special something.

The frozen pie crust was fine and thus this is so easy to make.

Never had pecan pie before ( not a very British dish, this ) .... didn't know it was so easy.... and tasty.

I just made this for Sunday dinner with my brother and family..It was a snap for sure. I did melt and drizzle in criss-cross fashion, Ghiradelli bitter sweet dark chocolate of the top. Just put it in a baggie and nuked it for a wee bit and snipped the end off. So easy,huh? Everyone thought the pie was super and of course as all nut pies are ultra-sweet,as that is their character to begin with... I did add a small scoop of vanilla ice cream (or I guess I might try creme fraiche next time...or to be totally off the chart, I think you could mix the creme fraiche with marscapone flavored with vanilla) ... to the side to help with the gooey sweetness. Just so darn simple and easy.Use a pretty pottery pie plate. I used a blue Le Creuset. Great presentation, too !!!!!
