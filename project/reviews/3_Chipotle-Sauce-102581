I added one more chipotle and a tbs of cider vinegar to balance the sauce.

For MarginWalker, there are canned chipotle chiles in adobo sauce and actual dried chipotle chiles. The distinction is necessary for the home cook to know which to purchase. Not redundant at all.

Good recipe...but I must mention that I think that it is stupid and redundant for it to say "dried" chipotle chili.....that is like saying wet water.....

More smokey than hot. Quite complicated and time consuming to make, but went so well with the soup!!

I agree with another reviewer that this is all spice and no real flavor. It was extremely hot, but nothing else. I added some lime juice, more cumin, and some and hoisin sauce to taste. It's still hot but now has tons of flavor.
