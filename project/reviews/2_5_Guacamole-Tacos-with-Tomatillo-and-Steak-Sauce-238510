I'm surprised at the 2-fork rating. It must be related to the guacamole recipe offered, which is the most boring guac recipe I've ever seen. I simply made the guac the way I always do, adding: Vidalia onion, garlic, cilantro, juice and zest of a lime, plum tomato, cumin and chile powder. I eyeball the proportions for everything relative to the number of mashed avocados in the bowl, so experiment to taste. I'm one for fresh guac, but if you use plenty of lime and store it with a pit in the container, it won't turn brown and the flavors get a huge boost after spending the night in the fridge. We're vegetarians, so I used fake steak strips (MorningStar Farms), which add a lovely smoky flavor once sauteed in olive oil until somewhat blackened and then chopped into small pieces. The only Chile de Arbol I could lay hands upon was ground, so I had to guess at the amount. I used 2.5 tablespoons, which may be a bit much for folks, but if you like some heat, it'll be just right. I also had to use 12 dried Guajillo chiles, which gave the sauce a lovely deep red color. The sauce, made with my changes, offers an intense heat that will make you sweat and clear your sinuses without making you feel like the inside of your mouth is being burned out. Make it in advance and the flavors just get better. I also used soft corn tortillas and fried them in corn oil until slightly browned and patted them down well before assembling each delightful taco. We loved these so much we had them for dinner two nights in a row! I can't wait to make these for guests--meatless, of course!!

I keep thinking something is wrong with this recipe... my sauce was completely green... nothing at all like the brown steak sauce in the picture... I couldn't find guajillo chiles, so I had to use serrano instead, and had to use powdered chiles de arbol instead of whole dried ones, but I can't imagine those changes would give the brown look to the sauce?? Flavor of the sauce was actually awesome - not bland, but the green look (from tomatillos) was unappetizing with the (essentially) boiled steak and green guac... Suggestions: actually add some steak sauce and saute meat in that (with seasoning) instead of in the tom. sauce and use both, use red onion and lime in the guac. Surprisingly, we really liked it, but I was really looking for the 'steak sauce' bite and flavor, and the meat was lost in the tomatillo sauce, so with a few improvements, I think it could really turn the recipe around to be fantastic.

Honestly, one of the most disappointing recipes ever from BA. Dried guajillos or fresh? The recipe never specified (I assume dried). The steak sauce was nasty- very bland, tart, and the steak was unappetizing. Guac was mediocre at best. Good concept on the recipe but lacking on the execution...

I thought this reciipe rather boring. The sauce was a little bitter. I added salt and a little sugar to cut the bitterness. The meat was tough so I simmered it about 45 minutes and it was better. If I make this again I would probably grill the meat first and then chop it into pieces and add it to the sauce. The guacamole was bland so I added some granulated garlic, lime juice, chopped tomato and cilantro, cayenne, salt an pepper. After assembling I topped it with some grated pepper jack cheese. After these adjustments it was quite good. I was wondering if Bon Appetit really tested this recipe. If they did I can't believe they thought it was worth making as is, because it was very mediocre. I will make this again using my own improvements. A dollop of sour cream would also be a great addition

BO-RING and so much work! I live in Phoenix and was able to find all the ingredients. I did not use the guacamole recipe as I could tell it was dull. I used the Barefoot Contessa guacamole recipe which is excellent. I made the tomatillo and steak sauce, it was extremely labor intensive and so not worth it. Just plain dull. I did however, make the green chicken enchiladas from the same Bon Apetit issue and they were excellent!
