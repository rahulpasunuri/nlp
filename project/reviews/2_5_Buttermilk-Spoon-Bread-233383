This was a real disappointment. The texture was awful and it is very very bland. I will not be making this again. I served it for a Sunday family dinner and it was hardly touched. The leftovers went in the garbage.

Add another 1/2 stick butter. Add 2 Tablespoons baking soda (to the eggs and cream mixture). Add 2 cups roasted pureed sweet poatoes (also to the eggs and cream mixture). Add another 1 teaspoon salt. Now we're talking...

Yum. Easy to make, creamy with a great toasty flavor on top. I cooked it a little longer than called for. Leftovers were GREAT fried in butter and topped with maple syrup for breakfast!

I cooked this with the extra cheese as other reviewers had suggested. That definitely helped, but it still wasn't worth making again (even though it was a very simple dish). The only thing that really gave it some pizazz was my creamed corn over it.

I didn't like the recipe. It wasn't horrible, but definitely not my momma's. Perhaps cooking it longer would give it a better crust. It also needed a lot more salt which I added after tasting the batter. Will not make again.

Easy and delish. Good as a side with something spicy, as it doesn't have much of a kick. It was a hit in this house.

Light and fluffy-offers something different than regular cornbread. I might add a little more flavor with more pepper and perhaps dried thyme or another herb in the future. Mine took a little longer to cook, but a good recipe overall.

Not bad, but not great either. It made a tremendous quantity, and the leftovers were not particularly enjoyable.

Great tasting and easy to make; we expect to make it again. Please note that there's an error in the number of servings. It's more like 10 or 12 servings, not the '2' that's listed.

I made this recipe to go with ham and tangerine chutney. I have not made spoon bread nor tasted it. I found it interesting. Sort of a cross between omlet and cornbread. It went well with the other dishes. The only issue I had was that it took 80 mins to cook. Not sure why but it ended up fine, just cooked slow. I also had it with left over ham and tangerine chutney but melted swiss cheese over it in the microwave for breakfast. Very nice

Note that there is an error in the number of servings - it should be 12, NOT 2.

I added 1/2 cup of swiss cheese to this and found it to be a nice accompaniment to the ham. Nice texture and ample flavor. Next time i may try it with cheddar or Fontina cheese.

This was a delicious recipe. It was very easy to follow and the result was fantastic. It came out light and fluffy. It did not resemble grits at all. Everyone loved it...even the kids. As far as the "bland" comments, sometimes you just need something a bit mild! I will definitely serve this again.

This definitely needed something to give it flavor. It had a very deep, rich taste to it because of the whipping cream & buttermilk, but as others stated it was bland. I have other cornbread recipes that are much better than this one.

This recipe was not as easy as lead to believe in the intro and very lacking in taste. It remided me of a recipe for Corn Pudding, which is much easier to make and much better tasting.

This was an unusual and delicious side dish that paired beautifully with the glazed ham that the recipe accompanied. It has simple flavors that complemented the sweet/salty ham quite well. And yes, it does serve 12.

Bland is an understatement!! This spoon bread had almost no flavor at all! I was so disappointed as were my guests!

This recipe was light as promised, but oh so bland. There are better recipes out there.

This was not a creamy spoon bread - more like a grits casserole. Nothing special. I will go back to my original spoon bread recipe.

Haven't tried this yet, but I plan to make it this week. The recipe is for 12 servings, not 2. I just checked my Bon Appetit magazine.

Come on Teahead, it must be a typo! This recipe must serve 12, not two. I plan to make this over the weekend; it looks really good!

I haven't made this recipe yet, but it seems like a lot of ingredients for 2 servings.
