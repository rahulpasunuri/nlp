This is the recipe that caused me to actually sign up at Epicurious, so I could save it to my recipe box and post a comment. I just loved it, and it was easy. I don't know if I'll ever buy pate again!

Great pate. I made this recipe twice. Once with butter and onions, which came out somewhat dry, and once with rendered duck fat in a 1.25:1 substitution and with 1/2 onions, 1/2 shallots. The recipe is much improved with the duck fat and shallots; the pate is creamier, fluffier, and more moist. Despite 7 anchovy filets, it still needs a pinch or two of added salt.

I love this pate. I make it every year. My guests go crazy over it every time. I have substituted shallots for the onion, added 2 tablespoons of cream, extra nutmeg, and.....here is the zinger....truffle oil at the end of the pureeing. It really makes the pate.

This pate was very good and very simple to make. I made it for Easter and we thought it needed "something", so added a teaspoon of grated lemon zest. That did the trick and really brightened up the flavor.

This is a wonderfully simple pate. I agree about the anchovies- to leave them out would be a crime. However, next time I make it, I will probably add whipping cream to the mix as, over time, the consistancy gets rougher- But I will definately be doing this again- so much easier than the baked pates I've been doing!!!

This makes a fantastic, rich pate. I soaked the livers in milk overnight and sauteed them rather than boiling them, but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. DO NOT leave out the anchovies! They add wonderful salty richness without tasting fishy.

This was delicious and so easy to prepare. My guests loved it and gobbled up every bit - even the ones that didn't think they liked liver. ;->

This was the best pate I've made. I substituted 1/2 lb. of ground pork for 1/2 lb. of chicken livers, and included cremini mushrooms (about 6-7 large), and a healthy dose of garlic. I also sauteed everything together in the same pan, adding ingreds. according to their cooking time. Used this pate on bruschetta with tenderloin for an appetizer - party goers loved it!
