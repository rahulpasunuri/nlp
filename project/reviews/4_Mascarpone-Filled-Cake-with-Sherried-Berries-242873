I made this for my daughter - mind u I make something then adjust it to suit me always, this one I didn't adjust - I used bob's red mill flour as a friend told me to try that one as it isn't as dry. I used a spring form pan which did very well. the only thing I might change is adding lemon extract as it goes well with the berries and I didn't top the cake - I sliced it then added the berries to each slice - I also put some of the cream in a decorators bag and did a design on the top as to make the cake look nice as I took it some where before serving. its also why i didn't top it with berries as I didn't want a soggy cake - once sliced it I could add as much of the topping or none as the guests wanted. I am a bit of a food snob and tend to throw out something if not perfect and remake till it is. I rarely leave a recipe as I found it as my cook books will attest to!. I come from a long line of cooks and some things we make are old family ones passed only thru memory.

Everyone enjoyed this recipe, even those that aren't huge fans of cake. I didn't have a two inch deep cake pan, so I divided the batter between two pans and reduced the cooking time to about 25-30 minutes. I followed the recipe exactly, and it was delightful. I used only strawberries and it seemed like an elegant twist on a strawberry shortcake.

The first time I made this for my mom's 50th birthday. We all decided that the cream filling was the most amazing cream we had ever had. As for the pound cake, it was a little bit of a disappointment. Their was nothing terrible about it but I'm used to my mothers famous lemon pound cake from Germany. With that being said, the second time I made the cake I put a lemon twist on it. I used mom lemon pound cake recipe and added lost of lemon juice to the cream. It was very good.

I just made this cake yesterday for a housewarming party and the guests loved it! I put the cream between the layers and and left the cake in the fridge overnight. Before serving, I had some extra cream so we spreaded this on the top and then arranged the berries over this. I definitely recommend the top layer of cream to hold the berries. It was also nice to have more of the cream throughout the cake since it was so divine! I recommend making more of the marscapone cream so that you have extra to spread on top of the cake. The cake itself was lovely and dense. I suspect you would have to be careful not to overcook this type of cake or else it would end up dry.

I just made it today and served it for our dinner party. The cake was truly delicious. Followed the recipe exactly and the cake baked the cake for exactly 35 minutes. It formed a nice crust around the sides. Great balance of flavors and textures. Left over mascarpone cream was used for dipping extra strawberries. Yum!

Rating: 2
I followed the directions in the recipe, even sifting the flour before measuring it out (unnecessary, as the measurement was pretty much the same pre and post-sifting). The cake's texture came out light and fluffy, but as another reviewer described, it tasted oddly like cornbread. I did not make the mascarpone whipped cream or berries, and may try them later with another cake recipe.

The cake was really good!!! I recommend serving it right after making (mascarpone gets a little hard and not that fluffy after refrigerating).

the mascarpone and the berries were amazing, but the cake had no flavor. it would be better if the mascarpone and the berries went on a moist lemon cake.

I have been stalking this recipe for months! Finally my husband's birthday... such a disappointment! Everyone always devours my creations fighting who is to take the leftovers and guess who came home with half a cake?! This by no means was a bad cake BUT it was no 4 forks not even 3... The texture and slight sweetness of the cake reminded me of cornbread. delicious mascarpone cream but did not hold up to the dense cake and severely understated berries. I am not a super super sugary sweet dessert person BUT if I am going to indulge in dessert, its going to be worth it.

Needs high altitude adjustment or it will rise too much, leading to overflow in the oven and texture problems (as happened to me on the first try). At 6,000 feet, I used 3/4 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1 c - 2 T sugar, 1 c + 2 T buttermilk (rather than amounts in the recipe) and baked at 375 degrees.

Rating: 4
Just great, but make sure the cake pan is at least two inches deep. Mine was less than two inches, and the cake spilled over in the oven and fell in the center. I didn't have time to bake another cake, so I saved some filling for the top and piled berries over it. It looked beautiful. I am thinking about making it in a springform pan next time. I mixed the mascarpone and cream the night before, so all I had to do was whip it up at the last minute. Guests appreciated that it was not too sweet.

Rating: 4
INGREDIBLE dessert. Made exactly as written, with the exception of adding the flour and buttermilk alternately, no problem with curdling. My guests polished it off in no time, all raving! Tried a second time macerating the berries in Grand Marnier, as others have done, for a couple of hours. Not good, the sugar drew the juices out of the berries, making them rather pale and limp. No comparison in taste. Stick with the recipe as written. I am hard to please and rarely give anything 4 forks. I would give this one 10 forks.

Rating: 4
Wow. The sum of these parts is so much greater than the individuals. I also used GM instead of sherry because I had it on hand. I made three batches of this for a large dinner party; one fell in the middle (I used that cake to make cake balls instead, also a hit). Even with that, this is one of the best cakes I've ever tasted...beautiful and easy! MAKE THIS.

The cake is divine. So tasty and light. Delicious. I had a slight problem with the cream though. Maybe I over did the beating? At one point it was smooth and creamy and looked perfectly spreadable, but I thought it wasn't stiff peaky enough, and beat it some more. Big mistake. The whole thing broke and looked curdled. Tasted good but couldn't spread it. So I added some more Mascarpone and heavy cream and mixed it by hand till I got an even texture.

Very easy and delicious. I used 2 8" pans because I didn't have a 2" deep 9" pan, and that worked fine. Baked about 25-30 minutes. My husband ate 3 pieces, and he usually is not crazy about whipped-creamy things.

This cake is absolutely amazing. I have made this over and over (more than five times) and everyone has loved it. I always use fresh berries. I assume frozen would work too, but they probably wouldn't be QUITE as delicious. If you feel the need to cheat out on some of the work, the Trader Joe's Vanilla cake mix (not NOT yellow) works beautifully. Even when I made this for the same crowd (again), everyone still raved. The absolute best summer cake recipe by far. I always go a little lighter on the sugar, but that is just for my personal tastes. Don't even think twice about making this. It is amazing!

Rating: 4
I made this cake as directed, but increased the amount of berries/sherry glaze by 1/2. I would have doubled it. I made the mistake of putting the berries on 1/2 hour before serving and the center of the cake got soggy. I just wanted everyone to see how gorgeous it looked dressed! Everyone loved the cake. I will DEFINITELY make this cake again!

Rating: 4
Made this for the first time a few days ago, and I was very pleased with the results. Although rich from the cream and mascarpone, I found the sugar content very palatable as opposed to many cakes that are just way too sweet, also easy to put together! I would like to figure out a way to increase the moistness of the cake itself, but other than that, it was fabulous. I may have overcooked mine by a few minutes though. Keep the berries to 4 cups! It's more nutritious, and the berries and sherry syrup add moisture and delicious flavor to the cake! Highly recommend this one!

Rating: 4
Made this a second time with the correct cake flour (previously had used arrowhead mills organic pastry flour, which I am now very suspicious of--just not as soft as pastry flour should be). It was even better than before. Easy, looks gorgeous, impresses all. Don't think you need 4 cups berries, though. 2 is good, which makes it less expensive.

THE BEST CAKE. MAKE IT-- SO EASY!!! SOO DELICIOUS AND BEAUTIFUL TO LOOK AT. I HAVE MADE ALL MY FRIENDS MAKE IT. ONLY CHANGE WOULD BE TO ADD A TON MORE FRUIT BC EVERYONE WANTS SOME W THEIR CAKE!!!

I made this cake for a baking contest and took second with it. Had I tested ahead of time, I probably could have done a better looking version. I added Penzey's 35% alc almond extract to both the cake and the whipped cream. In the cake, it was lightly noticeable. In the whipped cream it was the bomb. 3/4t seemed perfect. I whipped my cream to where it was stiff and lasts for days. Any fear of this cake not lasting is unwarranted. The fruit on the other hand, I'd have liked my syrup to have been stickier, but without reducing it, that wasn't what I got. Maybe a different Sherry would have yielded a thicker result. It never did congeal as I expected. It was still delightful. Pouring some of the juice into the cake helped distribute the flavor of the fruit. Amongst many other cakes, this one was still very easy to eat, even when getting tired of all the sweets.

Can only add to the hype. This recipe was PERFECT and hit all the right spots after a huge, heavy, lasagne-filled meal. After so many roasted vegetables and red wine, a heavy chocolate-on-chocolate-plus-chocolate-sprinkles-with-ice-cream birthday cake would have had us all in a food coma. As full to the gills as the 9 of us were during dessert, the cake disappeared quite quickly while we were doing the dishes. I will NEVER pretend my icing skills are up to doing a whole cake again. Having the layer just in the middle let the cake itself shine, and it was gorgeous. Makes me want to speak Italian. Although I had to be careful when trying a bit of the batter from the bowl...man oh man. Delicioso.

I've probably made this cake at least 4 or 5 times in the past 6 months. Every time it's greeted with squeals of joy and awe from friends and family. It's a very well presentable cake, easy to make, and not terribly demanding on the budget. In response to other reviews: It's not what I would a call flavorful but certainly not bland; nor is the cake itself "light" (like angel food or other sponge cakes) as some have deemed it. Honestly, it's simply delightful and perfect for any spring or summer (or just any) occasion.

Rating: 4
This was delicious and very easy! I made it almost exactly as directed, substituting amaretto for sherry and using only about 1 cup of berries. I also spooned some of the syrup over the bottom half of the cake before putting the cream in. This was a great way to add berry flavor to the bottom half. It was a big hit and it's maybe even better the second day because it firmed up a little in the fridge. Highly recommended!!

This cake was fantastic- you really can't go wrong w/ marscapone. It's been a while since I made it, and I think I used fresh berries, but I imagine would work with frozen as well. Could also macerate in any number of things.

Such a lovely cake! It's light and very tasty. Made it for a friend's birthday, will now make it for mine. It got rave reviews - people were fighting over who'd get the extra pieces! I made a batch and a half because my cake pan is larger (26 cm.) and cut it into 12 pieces - they were slightly big, but the cake is so good everyone ate their entire pieces. Had to use frozen fruit (berry mixture), it was still very good.

Rating: 3
Very nice; really quite simple, but the mascarpone icing is really spectacular. I was sherry-ing berries while whipping it up, and I suddenly heard the mixer change it's cadence a bit and start bouncing, so I ran mine a bit past stiff peaks. However, the smooth consistency more than made up for the slightly-harder-to smooth icing; it also was a surprisingly large amount that it made. You really can't go wrong with this one, especially if you love berries.

This cake is light and delicious! All of the adults and even my picky kids loved this (without the berry mixture). I think lemon zest would be a great addition.

I used slightly less sugar, fat-free buttermilk, triple sec instead of sherry, and coffee mascarpone and made as a birthday cake for my sister-- It was a huge hit with some finicky family! Definitely not a "light" option, but so simple and elegant that it tastes very light. Equally delicious and beautiful-- especially with the berries on top!

Forgot to mention that I used triple sec for the macerating syrup. Great aroma!

Made to recipe for the cake, reducing the sugar to 3/4 cup. It had a very nice crumb and flavor. For the fruit, I used one basket each of raspberries and blackberries with the prescribed amount of syrup. After the fruit macerated for a couple of hours, I used the syrup to baste the exposed cake halves. I wondered if the mascarpone and heavy cream would whip to peaks, but it eventually did. This was a big hit, wonderful flavor and very pretty presentation.

I made this cake yesterday for a Labor Day cookout and it was a huge hit! Someone at the party was allergic to seeds in the berries so I had to serve the berries on the side - other than not getting the same presentation as the picture, it was delicious. I'd definitely make it again.

This cake is impressive to look at, yet easy to make. I made this for our day-long work retreat and it was a hit. I substituted Amaretto for the Sherry. I did have an issue with the berries falling off the cake, but I managed to keep just a few on there for presentation, then served more with individual pieces. My buttermilk curdled, but it didn't seem to affect the cake at all - I will try, as others have suggested, to add some flour before the buttermilk next time.

I wouldn't call this cake "light as can be," but I would call it fantastic! Seriously - an incredibly delicious cake that would do well with about any frosting. Though the mascarpone filling and berries made it a little more summery.

It's berry season and this is yet another wonderful way to use the quarts of cheap berries I seem to end up buying every time I go to the grocery store! I took this to a lab picnic and it was the only dessert that got completely eaten! I am just beginning to experiment with baking and had no problems with this recipe, so don't be intimidated. I had some left-over berries and just ate them on top of buttermilk pancakes I made with the extra buttermilk I had after making the cake!

Rating: 4
yes, yes! So lovely on a summer evening, like a giant gourmet twinkie and I mean that in the best possible way. I added lemon zest to both the cake and the cream, and macerated the berries in Poire Williams pear brandy. It was delightful and our guests had seconds and even thirds. I followed others' advice and used an eggbeater on the buttermilk before adding to the batter and the cake is very light and fluffy. I kept the berries in their juice on the side and served individually, so as not to jeopardize the leftovers. Cannot wait to have this cake again tomorrow! Breakfast is served....

This makes for a simple, yet elegant dessert! I used triple sec instead of sherry for the berries and only used strawberries because that is what I had on hand at the time. I also used some of the liquid after macerating the berries and spread it on the bottom half of the cake to add a little fruitiness to that half. All in all a superb dessert!

Fantastic cake -- there are only two of us so I made cup cakes so I have single servings and can freeze some. I did substitute sour cream for the buttermilk since that was what I had.

Loved this cake. Just made it today and served with strawberries and blueberries in the syrup. My only change was using amaretto instead of sherry or grand marnier - simply because I didn't have the two on hand. However, I will always make this with the amaretto as it was out of this world delicious! Cake was easy to make and work with. Will do this again and again!

Awesome, Awesome, Awesome! I made this for my Brother-in-laws birthday and it was a great success. The only thing I changed was I substituted Grand Marnier for the sherry as the guest of honour did not like sherry, and it was fabulous. my husband took the leftovers to work and now they think I should open a bakery. If yu need something for company or a special event this will definitely impress, in both look and taste!

This is a wonderful cake. I also substituted Grand Marnier for the sherry. I used a silicone pan and still had some trouble with the cake sticking, and the cake crumbled a bit when I cut it in two. Next time I will use parchment paper on the bottom and two pans so the cake doesn't need to be cut.

Rating: 4
Amazing cake! I used two cake pans instead of cutting and baked for 20 minutes as previously recommended. To shake the buttermilk, I used a hand blender for a couple minutes and had no problem with the cake curdling. Lemon zest was an excellent addition as well. Lastly, I used orange juice and sugar for the fruit and it came out just fine. My mom who doesn't eat cake loved it, so I would definitely make it again!

It's my first attempt to make a cake. This is a very easy cake. My guests all like it even though I made a little mistake in the cake base. After I added the buttermilk, it curdled up and I didn't know I had to mix it longer to get smoother. Therefore, the texture of the cake base is not smooth and fluffy, but more like a torte. I will definitely make it again. I also would like to try to add some Almond flavour to the cake next time.

Enjoyed the cake. Used the wisk attachment on the standing mixer and used another reviewer's suggestion of alternating the buttermilk with the flour. The cake did not sink in the middle as experienced by others. More sugar needed in the filling. Also added a little lemon oil and vanilla to filling for enhanced flavor. Berries would not suffer from less alcohol.

AMAZING! Made this for a party and was a HUGE hit. One friend gave it "5 stars" and he doesn't even like dessert. So easy and presentation is beautiful. Some guests thought the cake was store-bought. Based on many reviews, I substituted Grand Marnier for Sherry as I had Grand Marnier on hand. Macerated the berries about 8 hours before serving and refrigerated. I assembled the cake about 4 hours before the party (minus the berries) and covered and refrigerated. I think most people let it stand room temp but I was paranoid of the cheese/cream mixture. When we arrived at the party, I added just enough berries on top for presentation and let stand room temp. When it was time to eat dessert, I put more berries on top of each serving and drizzled juice. Also used a springform pan. I didn't add lemon zest to the batter. I like the simplicity of the cake and let the macerated berries stand out. DEFINITELY a go-to dessert from now on!!!

Rating: 4
An EXCELLENT cake recipe. Since there are only two of us here, an 8 or 9-inch cake will always go stale before we can finish it. So I baked this recipe off in two 6-inch rounds. Baked beautifully in 35 minutes. One I wrapped and vacuum-packed for the freezer. The other I sliced in half, brushed with a Meyer lemon simple syrup and filled with a mascarpone/lemon curd mixture. Light and delicious! I also added a little more than 1/4 teaspoon of culinary lemon oil to the batter which gave it a delicious and light lemon flavor. This cake is very adaptable and will be my go-to cake whenever I need one from now on.

This was a well-written, easy recipe. The cake was beautiful (actually mistaken for store/bakery bought) and delicious. I used Grand Marnier to macerate the berries, and it turned out really well. The cake itself was light and fluffy, a great complement to the cream filling and berry topping. I made the cake a day ahead to save on prep time the day when I was going to serve it. I would definitely recommend this dessert and will make it again!

So yummy and can be sold it as a healthier cake if you are selling to people with imagination. I don't much care for sherry so I macerated the berries in 1/4 c spiced rum and 1/4 c cointreau. So tasty... everyone was fighting for the berries. I baked in 2 cake pan since I have an inability to follow directions. Overall a super simple, fabulous cake. Oh, don't mind the buttermilk if it curdles. just give it a few extra spins in the mixers and it should smooth right out.

As someone without a giant Kitchen Aid mixer and without cake flour, I still managed to create a fabulous cake. The cake itself comes out perfect and cutting the cake in half was not difficult at all, esp. with a serrated knife. The cake looks beautiful and is a fabulous, dense, almost pound cake like consistency. I had never made a cake with buttermilk instead of milk and it worked perfectly. I took the advice of another reviewer and alternated flour- buttermilk ending with flour. That worked very well. I used regular King Arthur white flour and it worked just fine. Also used grand marnier instead of dry sherry which did not taste sweet enough for fruit and a cake when I had a taste of it. All in all FABULOUS cake that looks incredibly more professional and beautiful than it is to do! MAKE THIS CAKE!!!!

Amazing and surprisingly easy to make! I made it for my brother's birthday. He asked for something with berries and my parents enjoy a lighter less sweet cake, so I tried this one. Everyone loved it. I used a spring form pan and dental floss to halve the cake with no problem. I used frozen berries and substituted brandy and triple sec for the sherry. The golden crust of the cake was so tasty I wished I had more to munch on. Most cakes are intensely sweet and basic tasting. This one was lightly sweet with complex flavors, how all cakes should be! A new favorite!

Wow. I didn't believe that this would be so spectacular just from reading the simple recipe. Almost a sponge cake with a beautiful whipped frosting. Subtly delicious.

Okay, okay. This cake is really good and easy enough for non-championship bakers. My only screw-up was that I accidently used an 8 inch pan and didn't realize it until there was batter pouring into the bottom of my oven. But even despite this, the cake turned out lovely and tasty. It cut easily in two with a knife. I had extra filling left over.Berries are so yummy. Leftovers make great yogurt or ice cream topping. Well, if there are left overs.

So easy and very yummy. Used brandy instead of sherry because that's what I had on hand -- still delicious. Also did not have cake flour so I used the cornstarch trick -- came out light and fluffy with a perfect texture. A hit with the huzz -- and with all my coworkers who ate the leftovers :)

I tried this yesterday and my batter curdled after adding the buttermilk and then the cake feel terribly and browned on the edges. I threw it out.

I'll try it again tomorrow.

WOW! I always select recipes based on reviews & ratings and this one was a 10! Made it for Dad's 75th bday and it was a smashing success. The cake was so moist & tender that it threatened to disintegrate upon tip out of the pan. Got lucky & only a couple of tiny pieces came off the sides. I took some advice and used dental floss to cut - brilliant & simple. Also used Patron Citronage orange liquer instead of Sherry. Cooked the liquer & sugar for 10 minutes on low, to give it a slightly syrupy consistency. Substituted 1/2 cup powdered sugar for granulated in the mascarpone for better disolving. Served berries on side so as not to muss cake top. DELICIOUS. Better than many restaurant desserts!

This cake was so incredibly delicious, but the texture was unexpected. This was the fluffiest cake I've ever made... there was no way I could have cut the cake into 2 layers by cutting parallel to the floor. Instead, I cut it into 2 portions perpendicular to the floor and stacked them, then covered the whole thing in the frosting. I did the same proportions of cream cheese and whipping cream, added 1.5 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, and powdered sugar. Whip with a hand mixer and it becomes a light whipped frosting. Was a party favorite!

Yum. Yum. Yum. This recipe was sent via one of those Epicurious updates which I always check out (usually better than the work stuff I'm reading). With all those 4 forks, I had to try it. And it was everything everyone said. Beware that the berries to slide off the cake as you are cutting it, but that was easy to fix -- just spoon the berries on the cut slice along with the soaking liquid. I'd also suggest adding extra berries to the sherry/sugar soak.

This is an absolute dream of a cake, and I'm not a big "cake person". I took it to a picnic, and everyone about died over how amazing it was. I had to stake out the last piece for my daughter, who couldn't come, otherwise, it would have been gone, gone, gone. I divided the batter into two 9" pans, per another reviewer's advice, and they came out perfect, plus, no muss or fuss with cutting layers. If you are going to transport this cake, don't let it get too warm, as the layers might slide. However, eat it at room temperature, or the marscapone can be too much like cold butter. This is NOT a heavy cake, nor is the frosting, in my opinion. It is perfect for summer. I can't wait to make it again. I mascerated the berries, and everyone thought them divine, but I think it would be fine to toss them on dry, too. The lemon zest was worth the effort. Honestly,I can't say enough about this cake.

Such a simple, lovely cake! I made this for Easter Brunch and it was perfect. Not fussy, fresh, and easily appealing. Its a heavier cake, the texture is dense, and much like a milk cake. The mascarpone frosting is heavy too. Overall, this cake is not light and springy. Although I skipped macerating the berries as I was being lazy, they were fine just topped on the cake with a sprinkling of powdered sugar.

I usually love to bake not eat but this cake I ate it! It's very light and the filling was so delicious. My 2-year-old son asked for the second piece and he finished it very fast. I had no problem with the cake. It didn't fall in the middle. I don't know was it because I divided batter into 2 9"cake pans instead of one pan? Adding the lemon zest really made this cake smell so good.Love it! :-)

I made this yesterday for a BBQ and it was a hit. Mine did fall a little in the middle but that worked to my advantage because it held the berries nicely. I also used a springform pan which made it much easier. As per another reviewer's suggestion I added the the zest of one lemon which gave me the idea to soak my berries in Lemoncello instead of using the sherry recipe. Just put them in a bowl, pour Lemoncello over them and let them soak until you are ready to serve. I put what I needed on top and served the rest on the side. Everyone raved about how good it was and everyone asked for seconds so, unfortunately, there was nothing left to take home. I think the Lemoncello made a tasty difference. I will definitely be making this again.

I am not going to rate this yet, because we wont be eating it until tonight, but my cake fell too. I followed the directions exactly, so I am not sure what went wrong. I suppose I will just fill the dip with extra berries....a berry bowl cake ;)

Has anyone else had any trouble with the cake falling in the center? The first time I made it, it fell alot in the center, the second time it was perfect, and the third time it fell a bit. I double checked the ingredients, I know my oven temperature is correct, and I did bake it in the middle of the oven. Any suggestions?

One of my favorite desserts ever! A real winner. I added a tsp. of lemon zest as others recommended but otherwise made it as written. The cake has a wonderful texture (sort of like a light cornbread) and has just the right amount of sweetness to go with the tangy mascarpone filling. Juice from the berry mixture soaks into the cake a little without making is soggy. Outstanding! (Note-- one reviewer said adding the buttermilk made the batter curdle. Even though I let the buttermilk come to room temperature before adding it, it made the batter look curdled, but still everything came out fine).

I made this for a friend's birthday, and it turned out really well. My two friends and I both agreed it should get four forks. I bought some lemon to put in the cake batter, but forgot to put it in! I think it would be a nice addition.

Easy to make and a crowd pleaser. I used amaretto in place of the sherry. After I drained the berries served the leftover amaretto sauce on the side. It was a huge hit.

My hard-to-please family loved it. Barely a crumb left on the platter. While I had intended to add lemon zest to the cake batter, I was in such a hurry that I completely forgot. Still, it turned out lovely. I think I'll use this cake recipe as my go-to plain cake. It has a pure, sweet taste that goes great with berries (like this recipe shows) or just as a jumping off point for other flavors. It's nice and soft, but not impossibly crumbly or spongy. As I write this, I realize how much I enjoyed it, and I'm a little sad that my family had to go and eat it all. :-P A few other adjustments I made: I used Brandy and Chambord instead of Sherry 'cause I didn't have any. Had to play with the measurements, but I made sure not to pour syrup onto the cake. The strawberries dripped just enough for the cake to soak up a little flavor yet not get drowned in liquor. Also, I added a few extra tablespoons sugar to the filling because I wanted a sweeter taste that the kids would like just as much as the adults. It turned out to be a wise decision, as most of the adults in my family apparently have a sweet tooth. :-)

This is a wonderful cake! Easy to make, light and fluffy (but perhaps deceptively so with all that cream and mascarpone), wonderful texture. I used frozen mixed berries to no ill effect. The cream easily frosted the entire cake, and I can't imagine putting all of it in between the layers. It is not a big cake, and I toyed with the idea of doubling the recipe; I think if I'm serving a larger crowd that would be an easy way to make it go further. Overall, a great recipe! It is getting added to my repertoire.

I followed the recipe for the cake exactly and it came out perfectly. As I didn't have dry sherry on hand I used sweet sherry instead and cut the sugar in half and allowed them to mascerate for 6 hours. Also, I didn't drain the berries but spread some of the juice onto the bottom half of the cake. I also add a layer of the berries before adding the layer of the cream. It was exceptionally good. Not too sickly sweet and very light. I look forward to making it again and again.

Great cake. Easy to make and delicious. I used Amaretto to soak the berries in and it worked fine. I didn't add sugar to the alcohol mixture. Would make again for sure.

I forgot to add that this was super easy and quick. I had the cake, cream, and berries made and dishes done in 20 minutes. Also, watch the baking time. I only had to bake mine for about 25 minutes.

I doubled the cake recipe, and used the sunflower cake pan from Williams-Sonoma (see it here: http://www.williams-sonoma.com/srch/recipe.cfm?action=RCP&searchform=1&searchtype=recipe&recipe=sunflower). I added the zest of one lemon, and it made the cake really pop under the flavors of the berries. I used cherries and blueberries and let them refrigerate in the sherry sauce overnight, and they were SO GOOD. I served the marscopone on the side, since the cake itself was too beautiful to slice in half. The presentation with the berries piled in the center of the flower was gorgeous. Lot of oohs! and ahhhs!

I liked this recipe quite a bit too. But, hmmm, it was because it was the opposite of sophisticated, as mentioned in other reviews. Agreed - it's easy - in fact so easy it should be a summer / fall staple. Also - unlike the advice in another review, I suggest you do not strain the berries too carefully. Allow the sherry fortified juices to soak the top somewhat - control it to your taste and consider whether it will all be served at once or some saved for later. Not suggesting you drown the cake, but the cake itself is not too flavorful, and though you could change the recipe (zest) to account for that, I think the idea is to use those liquids to complete the range of tastes and textures.

Served with fresh blackberries & sliced strawberries on top, this was an elegant and delicious dessert. I added the zest from one lemon to the batter per an earlier reviewer's suggestion. Good idea! Got rave reviews from a variety of guests. Drained the berries for topping well so that cake wouldn't get soggy. Passed extra fruit (some from freezer since berries are expensive this time of year) with the sauce for additional topping after the slices were served. Watch the baking time - it will overcook quickly.

Superb! Wonderfully sophisticated enough for a special birthday cake.

Outstanding! This is going to become one of my go-to recipes in berry season. The cake was light, delicious and came together in no time. I only used half as much sherry/sugar syrup as the recipe called for, since I had wonderful farmer's market berries, and I didn't want to overwhelm them. I also used pastry cream rather than the mascarpone filling, just because I had some.

Lovely, sophisticated take on berry shortcake. A few things: the first time I made it, exactly according to the recipe, the batter curdled when I added the buttermilk. The cake turned out alright, but not as good as the second time, when I allowed the buttermilk to come to room temperature, and added it alternately with the dry ingredients. (For the cook who felt it was not light-as-can-be, be careful not to overbake.) I wanted the berries to be flavored with the sherry, but did not want them to be completely macerated. I made the syrup, brought it to room temperature, added it to the berries an hour or two before serving, then refrigerated them. I took them out 15-20 minutes before serving. No need to assemble the cake just before serving  it can be assembled and refrigerated earlier in the day. Also, to make it easier to split it in half, consider popping it into the freezer for 15-20 minutes (this does nothing to spoil the cakes wonderful texture). In the future, I might add lemon zest to the cake. All these notes aside, this was a real hit, and its a keeper.

Wow!! This will definitely be what will be made in our kitchen when we think strawberry shortcake. It goes beyond the classic. We loved it!!

This was super easy and well-liked but mine did not come out light-as-can-be. It was more like a dense, almost dry cake which went well with all the berry syrup it could soak up. I used pastry flour instead of cake flour, which should normally not make a huge difference, as pastry flour is essentially less soft than cake flour but softer than all purpose. I have noticed that the arrowhead mills organic pastry flour I used does not come out very light, in a lot of recipes, and am wondering if that is the problem. But regardless, this is a delicious and easy recipe.

Wonderfully easy recipe! I baked the cake in a 9" springform - came out beautifully high. My guests oooed and ahhhed.

This cake was delicious. I made it for a Fourth of July party. I've written all about it on my blog. http://megan-deliciousdishings.blogspot.com/2008/07/4th-of-july-cake.html

Great summer dessert! Cake was delicious and the marscapone-cream filling was not too sweet. I used one cup of spelt flour + one cup regular flour. The spelt gave it a nice texture and slight nutty flavor, and upped the health factor. I found the syrup too sweet, so will amend that part next time. I will also try substituting some of the butter with flax meal next time. Reduce the fat a tad.
