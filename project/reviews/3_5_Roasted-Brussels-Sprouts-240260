Dressing is exceptional, and is also great with other roasted vegetables. I've used it with roasted broccoli and cauliflower. Roasting time for brussels sprouts vary alot depending on thier size. Best to just keep a casual eye on them after they've been in the over a while.

Tres delicious! I have a question for you more experienced cooks: How can I turn this sauce into a vinaigrette for other salads? (Pardon my naivete...)

Didn't read the reviews and burned mine in just 20 minutes for a dinner party. I'm sure it would have been tasty if I hadn't burned the brussels sprouts!

These sprouts were a HUGE hit at our last dinner party. Even the non-brussels sprout lovers thought they were delicious. The sauce is very strong, so use a gentle hand when tossing it with the roasted sprouts. I lightly dressed them, and then had extra sauce and extra rice topping on the side.

This recipe is seriously wrong. It asks for a temperature of 450. That seemed too hot so I used 425. Still way too hot. The recipe says to roast for 40-45 minutes at 450! No way. They were blackened after only 20 minutes at 425.

When I saw "450°F for 40-45 minutes," I thought, that can't be right. So I checked the reviews and sure enough, it's way too much. I used baby brussels sprouts, and they were done in 15 minutes at 400°F. I love how they turned out crispy and nutty. I had everything for the sauce except the mint. But even lacking that, it was a terrific combination with the sprouts. I think I'll look for the Tiparos fish sauce, though; I think the brand I used was too salty. I'll look for the Japanese puffed rice, too. I imagine it would look great on top.

great flavors, would have been great if cooking time and temp had been different. I burned mine while busy preparing other things. Maybe 400 for 30 min?

I just used the recipe to roast the brussel sprouts. Like lots of other people I found they cooked much faster. Unfortunately the first time I made these they were almost charred...my bad; I should have watched more. Quite delicious, though!

I just used this recipe as a guide to roast the brussels. I didn't make the dressing. The brussels alone were delicious - but cooked a lot quicker than the recipe suggested.

I had these for the first time at Ssam while in NYC and had to get the Momofuku cookbook immediately so I would have the recipe (sadly didn't realize it was posted here at the time). One of the most amazing dishes I've had and it tasted just as good (well almost, nearly, just about) when I made it. Make extra rice krispies, you'll want to snack on them. :)

Even as someone who likes Brussels sprouts and loves Thai food, I was dubious about this combination of flavors. But what do you know - this is delicious! The sweet/spicy/salty sauce perfectly complements the nutty roasted sprouts, and the fresh herbs really lift the whole dish. I'm not convinced that the crispy rice is necessary, but it did add a nice visual flair. I served this with chicken roasted with lemongrass and garlic (the recipe is on this site).

I love brussels sprouts, but these are the best I've ever had. I was just looking for a roasted b-s recipe, but had all the ingredients for the sauce and was just blown away. Who knew that fish sauce and brussels sprouts were just made for each other??? I've made this three times since I found it about a month ago.

I agree with others that they take a lot less time to cook- but just keep an eye on them and take them out when they are nicely crisp and brown all over. For the sauce, I use the lime mint from our garden which adds an amazing floral-fruitiness and typically we use sweet chili sauce instead of the sugar, chili and garlic and it turns out great.

AMAZING! I confess that I didn't make the dressing or the puffed rice - I just used this method to roast the Brussels sprouts. So delicious I may never cook them any other way again. To those looking for a terrific veggie dish - roast the sprouts as directed, salt well, add pine nuts and a squeeze of lemon. Terrific.

These are excellent! We have a depp fryer so I did that instead of roasting in the oven and I think the rice crunchies complement the sprouts really well. This is a quick and tasty side dish and we did it with spring roll app, beef and noodle soup and tofu stuffed with mushrooms.

I had these the other day at Momofuku Ssam Bar. They were absolutely amazing. The best brussels sprouts I have ever had. I am making them for thanksgiving and hope they turn out half as good.

Had these last night and can't stop dreaming about them today. Brussel sprouts!!!! Never would have believed it... Will be making for our next "one-upmanship" dinner...

The dressing is delicious. Prefering to keep it simple - didn't use cilantro, garlic, or peppers, just the fish sauce, sugar, water, and mint. It is a tad salty but in a good way. it's not overwhelming. Cooked in a glass baking pan and yes, it didn't take as long to cook. Used half of the dressing recipe with 1 lb of sprouts and didn't have too much dressing left over. This is very easy to make, I will do it again.

I guess no one reads the recipe. It clearly states to use only enough sauce to coat. Wonderful, nothing can beat the original but these are definitely a close second. Enjoy!

I made these in the fall for a dinner party, I'm not sure what happened but there was soooo much sauce. The flavor was good if a little salty, I'd half the sauce next time. Also did not do krispies! Perhaps in the deep fryer the brussel sprouts get sealed and so don't soak up as much sauce and get mushy?

I loooove brussels sprouts, and I greatly enjoyed this dish and got a lot of compliments on it at a potluck. However, I felt that there was too much sauce (the sprouts were a little soggy, and I had to drain a sauce-puddle out of the bottom of the dish) and that the sauce was proportioned strangely (I cut the fish sauce in half, thankfully, but then it was still a little too sweet). I'll probably make it again with less fish sauce and with tamarind juice and a dash of sugar instead of simple syrup.

Wow! Just finished supper and these were fabulous! My husband was raised as a British school boy, and therefore KNEW he hated Brussels Sprouts. Towards the end of the meal, he gave me a pleading look and asked if he could have any that I didn't want -- I didn't share. I shortened the cooking time to 20 minutes, and didn't use the crispy topping.

Did not like the sauce, though the crunchy stuff was fun. Would have preferred plain brussel sprouts!

These were fantastic! I was not sure how well the asian flavors would work with my favorite vegetable- I never stray very far from the tried-and-true roasted-with- garlic-and-butter method. Oh, what I'd been missing! Do keep an eye on the roasting time. I started checking after about 15 minutes and my fairly small sprouts were perfectly done in 25.

Amazing. I'm not sure the rice krispies really added anything to it, honestly, but it was amazing. I made it for Thanksgiving and 3 kids (5, 8 and 10) who had been turning their noses up at the thought of brussel sprouts seriously fought over the last ones. Couldn't believe it.

Fantastic, best brussel sprouts we've had except for Momofukus! :) Make sure you just coat the sprouts with the dressing, too much is too strong and gets the krispies soggy very quickly... It took much less than 40 min to bake the brussel sprouts so keep an eye on them!

The first time I had David Chang's brussels sprouts at Momofuku, I was totally blown away. I am so glad that the recipe is online, because now I can replicate its savory goodness at home! I definitely think that you can adjust the roasting time, but one of the best things about the sprouts at Momofuku is that they are just falling apart tender. I'd suggest keeping it closer to 35 minutes, but hey, whatever floats your boat!

Rating: 3
I agree with everyone who's said that 20 minutes was just fine. They still got nice and brown without being too schmooshy. I only had brown sugar, and that worked nicely. I happened to have plain puffed rice cereal in the house (not rice crispies, but rather that plain, sort of nasty styrofoam stuff that comes in big bags). Made more than 1/2 cup because there's nothing wrong with extra crispies!

These were so good, far and away the best recipe I've had for brussels sprouts, and I was a little nervous about it. Requisite changes: I adjusted the cooking time since I had very small sprouts: 20 minutes @ 425 was plenty for tender, well-browned but not mushy sprouts. Also, I lacked mint, so I used more cilantro, and had to use a dried chile. I don't think these were critical changes. Will definitely make again.

That "dressing" must have been somebody's idea of a cruel joke. Yuck!!! I ended up with roasted brussels sprouts...period.

amending my review to add the requisite forks. depending on your oven 425 @ 30 -40 mins is a good all around temp (size of oven makes a diff i think) otherwise, don't change a thing. to my complete shock the work crowd devoured it. the rice krispies are awesome. it's the NEW green been casserole. (thx epicurious for adding a scroll bar to the review box)

I thought nothing would make me appreciate the bitter and unfriendly brussels sprout, but this recipe has changed my mind and my palate. No need to ask whether I'd make it again -- I already have!

Nothing beats the original, but these come pretty close. I roasted for 40 minutes and, while the browned edges add a nice taste, the sprouts got a little soft for my liking. The dressing is amazing. I'm definitely making it again.

Nothing to add to the raves, except: You can use a "bhel poori" mix from an Indian grocery and skip the rice krispies.

Just to add to the above ... Tweaks: 1) Yes, they were a little overdone after 40 mins. I'd either cut the roasting time to 35 mins, or lower the temp to 400F and keep the roasting time the same. 2) The recipe only needs a little over 1/2 the amount of dressing called for ... 1.5 fl oz of simple syrup, plus 1 oz fish sauce is probably sufficient. 3) I'm not big on minced raw garlic in the dressing - instead, i just pounded the clove flat, infused it in the dressing while the sprouts roasted, and then removed and discarded the clove just prior to use ... a garlic infusion if you will.

Rating: 4
Very innovative recipe ... the combination of fish sauce with simple syrup makes for an interesting dressing that compliments the deeply caramelized sprouts.

These are absolutely delicious, even without the puffed rice part. I cut the cooking time to 25 minutes, though next time I will try lowering the oven temp. to 400 like another reviewer. The cayenne in the sauce gives it a nice little kick, but not nearly enough to scare off people who aren't into spicy food. It's a little tingle on the tongue, and that's it.

40 min. on the top rack of my oven worked fine for me. Skipped the puffed rice and used pan-fried shitakes with garlic. Very tasty.

Cut the cooking time in half - I used fairly large sprouts and they were burned to a crisp all the way through.
