Really unattractive salad, as its mostly one color, but a good, quick meal for me when I need to prep and eat something fast with ingredients on hand. I feel like arugula or another, more flavorful, peppery green would have worked well here to add punch. A little chopped red bell pepper maybe. Olives?

An OK salad. Useful in getting the family to try different types of salads.

I just made this for lunch and it was delicious. A great alternative to the usual greek salad/cobb salad/caesar salad choices. Plus I always have a jar of artichoke hearts and a can of chick-peas in the pantry. I coarsely chopped the artichokes to spread them more throughout the salad. Didn't have romano so I used parmesan and that was delicious.

Rather boring recipe, I had hoped for more. It was fine, but nothing spectacular. I doubt I'll make it again.

This salad was just OKAY... I probably wouldn't make it again.

Excellent recipe, this was the first time I had Chick Peas in a salad, and it was perfect. My husband and I love it. We have more cans of Chickpeas than anything else. For the person looking for a substitute for Romano. Ofcourse Parmesean! Or leave the cheese out all together. It makes a difference, but if you have a little balsamic and about 2 tablespoons of extra light olive oil, mix it together, pour it over the salad and mix with fresh ground pepper. YUM, its it die for!

This was a great salad and so easy to throw together. The ingredients are things I always have on hand so it is convenient to boot!

sounds interesting but I need a substitute for Romano cheese. Any ideas?

Whenever I make this recipe I always seem to make it twice. I love it and usually use it for a change of pace at lunch time. When the week is over I find myself putting together another batch for the following week. I've never given a recipe 4 forks before, but this one is definately a winner. If you can't get enough cheese, do what I do and add a little more.
