I've made this a couple times and it is delicious. Serve it over couscous or with crusty bread for the sauce. I used vongoles instead, and they were just fine. Everything else stayed the same.

We love clams. This recipe intriged me. To much going on with all the flavors. I'm glad we tried it but have had better clam recipes from this website.

Served this to company last night and there wasn't a drop left! I added more sausage, used brandy instead of the sherry and would cut the peppers into bigger pieces next time. Also, if you want more heat, try smoked paprika. Can't wait to make it again....

Very good dish. I only used one poblano and also light on the pepper. Otherwise the clams get overpowered. Crusty bread is a must.

Very easy and attractive dish. I served it over angel hair pasta with homemade french bread for the ever important sopping up of the special sauce.

really easy and delicious- i did substitute littleneck clams for manila clams and marsala for sherry. perfect amount of spice with just one poblano chile. heated up well the next day, too.

This dish tastes beautiful and looks beautiful...and it's quick and easy. Because I like to use local ingredients, I substituted Alaska steamer clams for the Manila clams with great results.
