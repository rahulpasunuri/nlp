I eat this salad every summer throughout peach season. It is easy breezy and magnificent to boot. I want to marry this salad!!!

Is this a gourmet masterpiece? No, but I give it 4 forks for being what it is: a quick, easy and delicious dish that comes together fast. Normally I would not use bottled dressing, but here it's fine. The only change I made was to use less of the dressing (I got the Brianna's that so many suggested) because of the high fat content. I dressed the chicken, peach and onion pieces, but for the greens, I mixed them separately using some of the dressing diluted with a little orange juice, so it wasn't quite so thick and high-fat. Then I plated the chicken mixture on beds of the greens and sprinkled the nuts on top. A hit.

Excellent salad! Refreshing and so easy to make. Only thing I changed was I used pecans instead of walnuts. Yum!

It's not fresh peach season, so I used a Pink Lady apple, diced, and cashews. I usually don't use recipes calling for purchased dressing, but I tried this, using Brianna's poppy seed dressing, which I had, and was pleasantly surprised. It's very good, and not as overwhelmingly sweet as I feared.

All the ingredients sounded lovely although i also added bell peppers. I liked the idea of caramelizing the onion, great suggestion. I've never had poppy seed dressing before. I popped the lid, sampled it and thought it was WAY too sweet.. however the BF liked it so I figured I would only put in a small amount. I was pleasantly surprised! All the flavors fit just right. I would definitely make this salad again.

Excellent recipe - great for a large crowd or potluck. I used mangoes instead of peaches - worked splendidly!

Used whatever I had on hand: blue cheese dressing, an orange, added orange zest, chicken left over from making chicken stock. Sauteed onion before adding, as other reviewers suggested. The resulting salad was delicious, and very quick and easy. This recipe exemplifies how all you need is a basic concept for a recipe: practically any fruit, practically any nut, practically any version of onion that tickles your fancy, any prepared (creamy) dressing you favor, add it all together and you've got a winner.

Amazingly easy and light summer salad. So much more appealing than the usual mayonnaise chicken salad. I forgot the walnuts and still liked it!

This salad is delicious! I used toasted pecans instead of walnuts, two roasted chicken breasts that I shredded, and used Renee's Poppy Seed dressing. It was quick and simple to prepare - perfect dinner on a warm sunny day.

this was a fantastic and easy recipe. I used mango instead of peaches and used honey roasted sliced almonds in place of walnuts. Served it over a bed of greens. Very light and refreshing.

Great recipe, received many requests for it. I used nectarines (because of availability) and missed out nuts because of duplication in another chicken salad I was serving, but I imagine it would taste even better with the nuts. I served the greens separately, not tossed in. I used Breannes dressing, as suggested and it was a hit. I did find that it lost some of its zip after sitting, prbably due to the dressing being diluted with the nectarine juice, but I had none left at the end, and could have added more dressing as the event progressed. I served croissants with it.

Awesome! I used necztrines instead of peaches - just a personal preference. (To the person who poo- poo-ed the botttled dressing? Brianna's is excellent - just as good as my homemade one - just easier!

I made this for my son's first bday and got rave reviews. I used Brianna's dressing and baby spinach and did not carmelize the onions. It was fabulous! Even the kids were eating it. Everyone is asking for the recipe.

Bottled salad dressing? No problem! This is such an easy recipe; why would you want to complicate things by not using bottled dressing? The flavors were fantastic and the preparation was a breeze. I used rotisserie chicken, leaving some of the skin on. I think this really added a great flavor. I chopped up all the fruit because I thought the garnish was redundant and you had to cut up the fruit to eat it anyway.

This is a stupid question, but I have to ask. Just how do you carmelize the onion? I'm imagining fairly wilted, soft onions that might add some flavor but would take away from the crunchiness that this dish seems to need (to blend with the smoothness of the fruit). Could someone please explain how you do the carmelizing? Thanks.

Purchased salad dressing? Come on!

This is a great recipe for anyone and especially for kitchen novices. The basic chicken/fruit/onion/nut combination works very well and I think it would be almost impossible to screw up. I substituted what I had on hand for an impromptu lunch (slivered almonds and bibb lettuce) and my guests loved it and asked for the recipe. No one could believe I just whipped it up. For my taste, it needed a little spicing up so I added just a little salt and pepper but think the curry or many other spices would work well. I liked the texture of the raw onion and would simply use a little less if I felt it was too strong. A good recipe to play with if you like.

So many rave reviews for this dish and I am not sure why. I liked it, a few others at my pot luck realy enjoyed it, but I thought it was just ok. I've had better chicken salad. I carmelized and used Brianna's dressing.

This is a fabulous summertime meal! I added a little gorgonzola cheese as a garnish and used a store bought rotisserie chicken so I wouldn't have to turn on the oven. Very easy!

I've been using epicurious to find recipes for almost a year and this is the first time I've loved a recipe so much that I had to leave a review. This is the best chicken salad I've ever had. I used pecans, baby spinach, and Breanna's dressing. This is the only chicken salad I'll ever make again!

I served this to my Bunco group, and it won rave reviews. I will definitely be making this again. An excellent summer luncheon meal.

I too made this for a luncheon and everyone loved it. I took your reviewer's advice and caramelized the onions, and since peaches were not in season, I used cantalopes. I also used Brianna's Poppyseed dressing. This salad was so easy to make and tasted like I had worked on it for hours!

This salad was definitely yummy! It was my first time making it and everybody loved it. I used Brianna's Poppyseed dressing and it mixed well with white peaches. By surprise...white peaches, walnuts and dressing was a good mixture for this salad. Must try!

Let me say, my very hard to impress mother-in-law talked about this salad for weeks after I served it. It sounds a little different, with the fruit, but all of the flavors combine very well, so it doesnt stand out or overwhelm. I just used Kraft Poppyseed dressing, and I luckily had baby greens on hand from my garden (if you can grow it yourself it is very much worth it, you can have fantastic salads all summer), but I used about half of the stated amount. Be sure to serve right away or the greens will wilt. A very nice & colorful presentation, and most importantly, delicious!!

Absolutely delicious! I LOVE this salad and have made it numerous times, always to the delight of my family and guests. I use Brianna's poppyseed dressing and fresh, in-season peaches. Simply wonderful!

Sooo easy and so good. I served this to company on a very hot day and it was cool and refreshing. Everybody loved it. Also, I used fat-free dressing, so it fit right in to our eating plan.

OK, so I used pecons instead of walnuts, canned chicken meat and a totally different dressing. I didn't have poppyseed dressing so I used El Toritos's Cilantro Pepita Caesar. This was a very easy, tasty salad. I will make it again but will try it with the Poppyseed dressing next time.

As far as salads go, this one is suitable for any and all occasions. I used Brianna's Poppy Seed Dressing and added goat cheese, served with breadsticks and voila - a divine lunch was had by all! WILL make again!

Couldn't be simpler and makes for a nice light dinner in the heat of summer. I threw in some crumbled goat cheese and used pre-cooked chicken.

My co-worker and I adapted this one for a big (80 people) luncheon and were very pleased by the compliments we received from everyone. We used cantaloupe and Granny Smith apples as the fruit, and garnished with fresh strawberries and pineapple. We used the poppyseed dressing recipe found in "Watercress, Pear and Walnut Salad w/Poppyseed Dressing" (also on this site). It was outstanding.

Just finished dinner with my 2 teenaged daughters. One loved it and had seconds, just about licking the plate! The other wasn't crazy about it, but ate most of it. I thought it was very good. I had never used poppy seed dressing before, but chose Briannas since it was mentioned by another reviewer. I tasted the dressing 1st, but felt it was too sweet, reminding me of Miracle Whip. I added curry powder, garlic powder, salt, fresh ground pepper, apple cider & white balsamic vinegar to the dressing, and to me it was much better. I used Romaine lettuce (my favorite), and pecans instead of the walnuts. I served the salad with hot bread sticks and enjoyed dinner very much.

While the base recipe is simply delicious, I made several changes that created a truly outstanding salad ... I added about 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/4 teaspoon white pepper and 1 tablespoon of curry powder - the flavors melded beautifully. In place of lettuce we used organic baby spinach and substituted Honey Mustard dressing. I also sauteed the onion as several others recommended; an excellent suggestion. My friend who is normally not a salad fan is still raving about this dish ...

I would go with sauteed red onions, and stir in the peaches at the last minute for a nice blended flavor. Grilling the chicken is good, too. I have made this recipe twice this summer, to rave reviews. The first time I tried it with the baby greens, they wilted somewhat in the summer heat outdoors. I then used romaine lettuce, which held up superbly and the color was beautiful. The poppyseed dressing I used was Brianna's, a creamy dressing and is an excellent complement to the peaches. I would definitely add this to my favorites.

What a great summer salad! I also made this with pre packaged chicken and cantaloupe. Next time I would half the amount of red onion or try the carmelized onion...

This was a big hit at my party. I omitted the fruit and used it as a spread on toasted baguettes. It was a nice alternative to a mayonaise base chicken salad.

We carmelized the onions, which we preferred as a more subtle alternative to the sharp taste of red onion - it was great! Adding goat cheese would have been great too.

Liked it enough after trying it peach season last summer to go searching for it again this summer.

Terrific spring/summer lunch dish! I made it with cantelope instead of peaches and used ready-cooked chicken. It was a breeze to prepare (my 10 year old helped!) and it looked very impressive. The combination of flavors was exotic. This will become one of my regulars for entertaining!
