So good and so easy-always a huge hit!!

A follow-up to my review of several years ago! My extended family demands I make this for major holidays 3x/year. Here's what I do, because I'm all about shortcuts. 1) Purchase 2 ready-made Oreo pie crusts instead of making them myself. The mousse easily whips up enough to fill both of them. 2) Use good-quality semi-sweet chips (1 bag) 3) Heat the first cup of cream in the microwave to boiling in a glass measuring cup (dirties fewer dishes) From start to finish (I've timed it!) this takes about 20 minutes (plus setting time) and is always a HUGE hit, whether with my family or if I make it for friends or other get-togethers. Love it!

This was so easy to make, easier than I expected! I made it for the people I work with and they raved about it. I gave them all the recipe. I then made it two days later for my relatives, who also raved over it. This will be my signature dish to bring over to someones house for dessert! I wasn't so good at decorating with the rosettes of cream on the top, so I just made my own design, and then shaved a chocolate bar. Wow...the look AND the taste!

This pie is crazy good and incredibly easy to make. Used chocolate teddy grahams to make the crust and made the whole thing the day before and added whip cream before serving. Fantastic!

I have been making this pie for years. My family demands it for any occasion! It is so easy and delicious. I use a 10oz bag of Ghiardelli dark chocolate chips and 1/2 a bag of semi-sweet chips for an extra rich and chocolatey pie. Yummy!

I only made the crust. I used it in conjunction with the Bon Appetit recipe for Frozen Peanut Butter Pie (url below). It was exceptional. http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Frozen-Peanut-Butter-Pie-1217.

Although I knew that this was not a traditional mousse I needed something quick, easy, and ready-to-serve in a few hours. I had all the ingredients on hand except the heavy cream so I made this for my chocolate-loving husband. I reduced the recipe to 2/3 and used a glass pie plate instead of the springform pan. The amount was perfect. I used Ghiardelli semi-sweet chocolate chips and would have normally melted them with the cream in a microwave but since the processor was already out for the crust I used it for the chocolate as well. I sped up it's cooling in the fridge while I whipped the remainder of the cream to which I had added 2T. of Grand Marnier, and 1t. orange extract. That I folded into the cooled chocolate, and finally into the crust. I garnished with a rim of plain whipped cream, and shaving of Vosges Blood Orange chocolate bar. It was served 3 hours later after being stored in the cooling drawer of my refrigerator. My husband was happy but it;s not a repeat for me. I'd suggest to use chocolate wafers, or scrape the cream filling out of the Oreo's as the crust was overly sweet.

Amazing. And SO easy. I'm sad there weren't any leftovers from the get-together I took it to. Everyone loved it. Will definitely make this againhow can you go wrong with anything that involves Oreos? I did one and a half recipes of the oreo crust for it, and don't have a food processor so ended up smashing the butter in by hand. Turned out fine. I'm not entirely sure why I needed to use a springform pan though, the crust ended up seeming so delicate that I didn't bother to remove the sides of the pan. Perhaps it's only needed because it's nice and deep? The recipe did yield a LOT of mousse.

This really is an exceptional, easy pie to make. I did bittersweet 3oz and semi 9 oz. Made a strawberry sauce in addition and added grand mariner and a touch of sugar to the whipped cream. Next time I'll try mint oreos and and maybe a different type of liquor, just for fun. Easy and impressive.

I made this for the first time last week. As someone who loves whipped cream, this is basically chocolate whipped cream with whipped cream on top. Heaven. I took leftovers to work and they were gone before I got any so I made another one 3 days later for another event. MMMMMM. And so easy. You don't need to do the food processor step. And I agree, it easily serves 12. Too rich to cut into eighths.

Fantastic pie! Very silky smooth filling with a delicious crunchy crust. A chocoholics dream! This will easily serve at least 12 people. I recommend making it the day before and keeping it in the fridge until you`re ready to serve, as the texture is best when it`s cold. I sweetened the whipped cream with a little powdered sugar and Kahlua.

We LOVE this recipe! I also use semi sweet chocolate chips (Guittard)and no food processor. We take it up a notch and pipe the finished mousse into dessert glasses and refrigerate to set. Just a few raspberries on top with some mint leaves make it beautiful as well as yummy!

I made this delicious pie in squares. I make my own version of oreos(faux reos,KAF) My husband bought me the perfect brownie pan for Christmas, so I trried it! For the filling I used semi sweet morsels+1TB. of Hershey's special dark cocoa. The Choc. melted beautifully. This was the silkiest mousse I have ever made or have eaten! It was not the slightest bit grainy. After chilling in fridge for a few hrs. I froze. Because of the nature of my using this recipe. It was for my son's school. Teacher Recognition Day. I was asked to make a chocolate mousse cake. I thought this would be easier to handle!!Huge Success!!!!!!

This pie was a huge success. My two-year-old nephew had to be physically restrained, he was so eager to have this dessert. All my guests wanted some: It was irresistible. On the first attempt, I made the pie exactly as directed. On the second attempt, I made a few changes. First, I did not use the food processor to incorporate the chocolate with the cream. The pie had a buttery texture and I thought that I had over-processed the cream and chocolate in the processor. I didn't want to run that risk again, so I heated the cream in a double boiler, then added the chocolate and stirred until melted. I removed it from the heat and then added the vanilla and salt. The chocolate didn't look smooth enough, so I stirred it until smooth. Second, I changed my technique for whipping the cream: Put the bowl and the beaters in the freezer for at least two hours before whipping the cream. This is what The Joy of Cooking advises to keep the the milk fat firm, rather than becoming oily (which might be another reason for the buttery, greasy feeling the pie had the first time I made it).

This is really an easy, delicious dessert that pleases everyone. It's been a staple recipe in my family for many years. I have started making it with the chocolate wafers or, as I was in a pinch this time and didn't have any, scraping off the cream filling from the cookies. This cut the sweetness a little. Rich and delicious -- feeds a crowd.

Delicious despite being incredibly simple. I used good semisweet chocolate (important because that flavor carries the dish). I sweetened the whipped cream topping slightly and drizzled with raspberry liqueur. Wonderful classic recipe!

I've made this a few times and just made it again for Thanksgiving - HUGE HIT! This pie disappeared fast and my son has already asked me to make it again! The only thing I realize now is that from now on, rather than using 12 squares of chocolate (which make a big mess chopping or putting in a food procesor) I will use a 12 oz bag of chocolate chips!

This was so simple and so delicious - a perfect combination. It seemed to get even better after a day or two so I would always make this a a few days in advance of serving.

I rarely bake, but I've been craving chocolate mousse pie from my childhood and decided to try this. I agree with others that it does not come out "mousse-y", but the flavor is good. If I make it again, I will double the amount of crust and use a richer chocolate for the mousse. (I used Ghiradelli semisweet chips for their ease.)

I must say that I kept this recipe I originally found in Bon Appetit in '92. I lost it but recovered it on Epicurious. Unless my memory doesn't serve me this version is different. As I recall there was also instructions to make bittersweet chocolate leaves for decorating the finished product,not shaved chocolate.

This is yummy and so easy to make! I had never tried this method of melting chocolate before, by putting it in the food processor and pouring the hot cream over, and will never do it any other way again. The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly, except for substituting chocolate wafer cookies for the sandwich cookies, and thought it was a little too sweet. Since then, I always cut the sugar in half, which I think brings out the chocolate better. And I also add a very small amount of sugar to the whipped cream, so there's just a hint of sweetness. In the summer I like to put a drizzle or small puddle of raspberry sauce on the plate, and then garnish each serving with a fresh raspberry. I've also drizzled chocolate sauce on the plate, and then used a Droste dark chocolate wafer to garnish - too much trouble to make chocolate shavings! I usually just do dollops of whipped cream right before serving rather than piping it around the edge to save time. Using good quality chocolate chips, like Guittard, rather than chopping Baker's squares also saves time.

This recipe was very easy, but very impressive. The chocolate mousse was smooth and light, yet rich-tasting. I used the Oreo cookies for the crust and really liked how the crust turned out. My kids asked me to make this every night for dessert.

My son said this was the best chocolate mousse pie/cake he EVER ate. For the crust I bought chocolate sandwich cookies from Trader Joe, which turned out to be peppermint, by mistake, and he--and I- -loved the minty taste these added to the dessert. And it was sooo easy to make. The problem is that one slice adds at least two pounds of body fat. It is too, too rich. Make sure not to put crust too far up the sides of the springform pan. Next time I will add the beaten egg whites, as suggested by another reviewer to lighten this up a bit.

This recipe is quite wonderful, and fail-proof even for a non-baker such as I. A friend gave me a huge slab of Valhrona chocolate and I had to 'guesstimate' how much 12 oz. would be. It still came out perfect, creamy and chocolaty. I took the advice of some and used Nabisco chocolate wafers and added liquer (Frangelico). My guests raved. This will be going in my permanent 'tried-and-true' file.

this was delicious! i brought it to my nephew's graduation party and everyone oohed and aahed. my only change was to use almost a whole box of nabisco chocolate wafer cookies instead of oreos. i also added a little sugar and kahlua to the whipped cream used for decorating the top. i think it would have been even better had i made this dessert the day before instead of that morning. i tasted it a day later (i got to bring home leftovers) and it is divine!!!

Well, this IS rich, but for how EASY to make and delicious it is, I can forgive! I made it twice, first time with about a quarter of the chocolate called for in the mousse + a bit of cocoa, and the mousse was lighter; but my guests kept coming back for more. Second time I followed the recipe exactly and it was so rich and dense, but I'm sorry to say I might love it more this way (probably because I'm a huge chocoholic!). I used Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate and Pepperidge Farm chocolate chocolate chip cookies for the crust.

Rating: 2
This was too rich and heavy for me. Maybe the problem was the chocolate I used -- Scharffenberger (I'm sure that's misspelled) 60% cacao semi-sweet chocolate. Maybe I'm more of a Hershey/Nestle girl. I would've preferred a light, fluffy mousse to this dense, chocolatey stuff. 8 servings from this recipe? You've got to be kidding! More like 20!

Simple to make but so delicious - and I am not that huge a fan of chocolate. I made only the mousse, and agree that by using chocolate chips, you can skip the food processor step and just add the hot cream to the chips in a bowl and beat them till the mixture is smooth. I put the mousse into pre-made chocolate cups, topped with one fresh raspberry, and all my guests were wowed. Definitely a keeper, and an easy way to have a "finger food" dessert that is also elegant.

This pie was exactly as advertised...easy, delicious and make ahead. I made this for dessert after a very, rich Christmas dinner and it was loved by everyone (my 7 yr old said it was like eating chocolate air). The only modification was a replacement of Oreo's for the crust. I used Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafers (the entire box), a bit more sophisticated and not as greasy since we were minus the cream filling in the cookies.

The taste, too, was excellent. As many have stated here, use the good chocolate....it's well worth it.

My family and friends know me as the "dessert queen" since I love baking but this is by far, the BEST dessert I have ever made or tasted! I was a little hesistant by the positive comments I read. I couldn't believe a dessert with so few ingredients could be so incredibly delicious. I used CALLEBAUT chocolate (from Belgium). I would highly recommend spending a little more and getting a fine quality chocolate - it makes all the difference. I also used Oreo cookies (the whole sandwich) for the crust. Next time I would use a little more so the crust could go up the sides a little bit more. I also did what some of the other reviewers suggested and poured boiling cream into the chocolate/ vanilla/salt/sugar mix. I also used real vanilla (from Mexico) - much more intense flavor. For the presentation, I piped whipped cream around the edge of the pie and added fresh raspberries. The pie came out perfectly out of the pan. No need to run a knife around the edge. Some of the comments I received were "unbelieveable" and "this looks really professional." Ofcourse, everyone wanted the recipe. THIS RECIPE WILL BE FOREVER IN MY COLLECTION!!

The original version of this recipe in the 80's was one of my favorites and I was thrilled to see it again without the raw eggs. I thought this one was equally as good and much easier to prepare. I made it for a large dinner party and everyone loved it! I simplified the recipe by melting the chocolate in a double boiler then mixing in the hot cream and vanilla without using the processor. This had no bearing on the end result and created less mess. I made a second one in a 10" pan and increased the recipe by 1/3. I thought the extra crumbs made it easier to work with than in the original recipe where I barely had enough crumbs to line the pan and the slight extra thickness of the crust was better to me. I made decorative chocolate leaves by painting melted chocolate on the back of waxy leaves, freezing them and peeling the chocolate off--fun and pretty. This was an impressive, but easy dessert and addictive as a leftover.

Yummy, yummy, yummy! This was so easy and so delicious. I made the mousse with 8 oz of semisweet chocolate and 4 oz bittersweet and thought it was just right(not too sweet). The rosettes piped on top were the perfect finishing touch and really did make it look professionally done. Will make again and again when I am in need of an elegant yet simple dessert.

This was excellent. I did substitute about 25 Nabisco's famous chocolate wafers for the oreos, and I used a deep dish pie plate instead of the springform pan. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I will probably follow the other reviews next time and add a tbsp. or so of sugar to the final whipped cream topping, I think it could have used it. We ate this after it had chilled about 9 hours, but the taste and texture was even better the next day.

TRY THIS RECIPE! I am usually the type of cook who assumes that more effort = better result. In this case, it's just not true. I was leary of trying a mousse w/o eggs assuming it must not be as good. (Although I hated the stress of serving a dish with uncooked eggs...) I tried this for fun and it is the best mousse I've ever had. I used Scharfenberger chocolate which I think is key. ALso added some espresso powder. It sets up wonderfully and has a great texture.

What a delicious and pretty dessert. Like the other cooks, I too skipped the chocolate in the food processor step. I made this for friends who were celebrating their anniversary and they loved it. I decorated the top with raspberries in the middle in a circle and then filled in the rest of the top with the whipped cream and chocolate shavings on top of the whipped cream. It was light, fluffy and had good chocolate flavor. I used Oreo cookies for the crust and Scharffenberger chocolate. I would make this again in a heartbeat.

I've been making this recipe for at least three years now. It is an awesome recipe! This is my boyfriend's absolutely favorite dessert, and if I made it as often as he requests it, we'd both be blimps by now.

And if you're feeling lazy, use good quality chocolate chips and forget about the chopping!

Have made this recipe numerous times, all to rave reviews and it really is not that difficult. I like the fact that there is no eggs in this recipe compared with some of my other chocolate mousse recipes. The recipe is even easier when you use Oreo crumbs that you can buy at the store. Cover the top with piped whipped cream except for a center circle which I fill with raspberries and drizzle melted chocolate on the top. People think it is from a bakery.

Just made this for the third time this weekend, and it has been a hit every time. As for the previous review, I think if it was too sweet and lacked depth, it was probably a result of the chocolate used. Obviously the higher quality the chocolate, the better the flavor. By the way, the food processor is not necessary for the mousse, I just melt the chocolate in a double boiler and then add the cream.

Easy to make and the results are predictable. Definitely flavor the whipping cream: sugar + some liquor such as kahlua works pretty well. If you don't want to use a processor for the mousse, it's fine if you just pour the cream over a bowl of chocolate and whisk it smooth.

I've been making this recipe since 2001. It's incredibly tasty and EASY. There's almost no point in adding my review because there are plenty of four-fork reviews for this recipe as it is! It's awesome!

This recipe first appeared in BOB APPETITE in December of 1980. I still have my back issues. The presentation and amounts of ingredients was a bit different, like 12 cookies instead of 12 but it is the same recipe. It was decorated with chocolate leaves and whipped cream. I made it for my Graduating Nursing School class and it was a big hit. I make it anytime I want an impressive and elegant dessert. It's been 24 years and there has never been one person who can resist it and the second piece they all say they can't eat, BUT DO. I love all of the recipes and will continue to collect and make them.

I improvised a lot on this recipe. I used chocolate graham cracker crumbs for the crust, and didn't use a food processor. I boiled the cream then added the chips, then whipped the rest of the cream and folded in the chocolate cream. For a richer mousse, I omitted the vanilla. I was told it was the best chocolate pie they had ever tasted and that it was like a cloud of chocolate the melted on your tongue. Try putting a swirl of raspberry puree on the top for an extra zing...it's a definite crowd pleaser!

A simple yet dazzling dessert! I also added a tablespoon of sugar & a squirt of vanilla to the whipped-cream topping. This pie is very rich & feeds well more than 8 people--12 would be more like it.

The best Chocolate Mousse I have eaten. Rich and smooth. I used a pre-made pie crust for a time-saver and a 12 oz. bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Incredible.

I made this for the kids and several pies for the adults. I can't believe how quickly this went. Every adult ate some and it was the first to go. I made it in a 9x13 pan because my springform pan was already in use. It worked wonderfully. I just spread the whipcream on top (added 2T sugar to the cream) and then scattered chocolate shavings. Wonderful. Will definitely make again.

This is a wonderful chocolate mousse pie! My husband says it's definately a "keeper." The only change I made was to add about 1-2 T of sugar to the 3/4 cup whipping cream that is piped on top. Plain whipping cream is just too bland. I would definately make this again.

I thought the mousse was delicious and very easy to make. I used it as a filling for a chocolate cake and also piped it on top of the cake as a decoration. There was no need to use a food processor for this recipe. The mousse was light and flavorful but not overwhelming.

Have used this recipe for a few years and nothing but praises. For a little twist, use a muffin tin without paper cups and follow the recipe. It's a little harder to make, but gives single servings. Use a toothpick to get them out and add a cherry topping.

This is one of the best desserts I've ever had or made. I've entertained alot and found not one person who didn't love it. I added some special touches to it's presentation, by slicing it up as a cheesecake into 10 pieces, and on the plate drizzling some raspberry sauce before placing the cake on it! Surprisingly with such a rich taste, it only costs me about 10-15 US dollars to make!

Unbelievable!! My family and friends fought over the last piece. I would limit the crust to the bottom of the spring form pan only; will make for easier serving.

This was a very good and easy recipe. I used a store bought Oreo crust and there was just enough pie filling remaining to fill a small ramekin (great treat for the chef!). I made this a day ahead and it turned out great. Definitely a keeper!

This is a very easy recipe. I made a raspberry sauce to accompany it and decorated the top of the mousse with chocolate leaves, fresh raspberries, and whipped cream rosettes. It's an impressive presentation for very little work.

Talk about simple and decadent! Can't get better than this. I've made it twice just recently for guests and most had seconds. The chocolate is smooth and velvety and the whipped cream cuts the sweet so perfectly. Just yum all around. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips which made it all the more simple. I will definately add this to my list of old faithful recipies. Bon Appetit.

We love this dessert! I've made it twice in the last month and each time I've had request for the recipe. I'm almost reluctant to give it out - its so easy! I skip the chocolate in processor step. Instead I chop the chocolate or use chips, pour the warm cream over, let sit one minute and stir until smooth. So good!

This is the first new recipe to be accepted into The Family (my mother's extended, traditional southern family) Vault in about 5-10 years. Everyone loves it and it's so simple! My grandma has to watch her cholesterol, so she limits her rich desserts (at holidays we usually make 6-8!). Now, instead of having a sliver of 2 or 3 of her favorites, she has a nice-sized slice of this. I can't think of a better compliment! P.S.-- Maybe because I whip it so much, I always have enough filling for two pie crusts-- it's so much easier to buy the ready-made Oreo crusts at the grocery store (and they don't have that tendency to crumble).

Excellent! Party-goers were asking for seconds.

I tried this recipe as just a mousse-no pie crust. My guests liked it, though I thought it was a little too light and fluffy. I prefer a denser, more intensely flavored chococlate mousse, and this wasn't it. However I might try it as a pie, with the hope that the crust would provide the inense chocolate flavor I want. I did add Kahlua to the recipe and would recommend that.

FABULOUS AND MOUTH-WATERING. I CREATED A DIFFERENT PRESENTATION THAT WAS GREAT. PLACED CRUMBS IN BOTTOM OF 9X13 PAN. FOLLOWED EVERYTHING ELSE AS WRITTEN. HOWEVER, AFTER THE MOUSSE HAS FIRMED UP, I CUT IT INTO BARS AND PLACING THE BARS ON A RACK, POURED QUICKLY, SLIGHTLY COOLED GANACHE ALL OVER. LET SET IN REFRIG. HELD UP REALLY WELL AND WAS A BIG HIT.

This has to be the best and easiest mousse that I have ever made. I use Chocolate Cat Cookies (for people) from Trader Joe's and a bit more butter and the crust works well. My family has asked me to make this part of our holiday traditions. Thank you

I have made this recipe over and over again. Everyone loves it, and I always get requests for the recipe. I typically don't make it with the crust, just the mousse in decorative glasses. The last time I made it, I added the juice and zest of two oranges and a touch of Kahlua. It was so good, my guests swooned. It's particularly nice to make for those (like me) who are allergic to the eggs that are usually found in mousse recipes.

Rating: 4
I make this over and over and ALWAYS to rave reviews. I use bittersweet chocolate (Scharfenberger - I wish they would make chips, which would be much easier than chopping). This is simple to prepare and always impressive. I've made it without the crust, and garnished with a dollop of whipped cream and mint leaves. For holiday gifts for a few folks this year, I made this, garnished with mini candy canes and presented it in a brand new springform pan with a few of my favorite recipes that require a springform pan (including this one).

I've been looking for a good, simple chocolate mousse recipe forEVER! This is the one. I use only milk chocolate chips, others are too rich. I also prebought the oreo cookie crust for $1.69 because I am lazy. Only problem I had was the pie doesn't transport well, needs to be served immediately out of the fridge, otherwise mousse "melts" and is messy. I also recommend just placing the mouse in dessert dishes and topping with whip cream.

I love both the ease of this dish and the response from my friends! I too, use chocolate chips and I make sure to pour the hot cream in the food processor before I start to blend - otherwise the noise of the chips flying around in the bowl is incredibly loud! Don't worry too much about the crust completely covering the bottom of the pan - just let it cool in the springform and pour the mousse into the pan and chill it in the refrigerator. Great Recipe

This is a great recipe! I make it all the time and my friends love it! To make preparation even easier, I make the following changes: I use semisweet chocolate chips instead of bothering to "finely chop" the chocolate. Since I don't have a food processor, I just add the boiled whipping cream to the bowl of chocolate/vanilla/salt mixture and mix. The chips melt within a couple minutes, and the mousse turns out as smooth as silk.

I included this on my V-day menu, and it was a hit! I also used chocolate chips and it came out great. The one thing I changed is that I sweetened all the whipped cream, so that what I added onto the top was sweetened, too. I also think that I folded in more whipped cream into the chocolate. It wasn't too rich that way.

I made the mousse only and it was superb! However, I halved the recipe and served 3 portions. It would actually better serve 6 as it was so rich, no one could eat more than half. This recipe is also sinfully easy to make.

Oh wow! This is the most delicious mousse I have ever tasted! I didn't even make the pie part, just the mousse. I let it set for 5 hours, and it was divine! Really really rich though. I didn't make the whole thing, I split the recipe in half because I didn't have enough whipping cream, turned out wonderful.

I made this for dessert on Christmas Eve and it was a HUGE hit with everyone. My family thinks I'm a real talent in the kitchen thanks to this one. I served it in goblets with the whipped cream and chocolate shavings. I also used semisweet chocolate chips for the mousse part. It came out so well I made it again for NYE, only in the pie form. Heaven on earth, if you ask me! And NOT hard at all.

It doesn't get easier, faster, more impressive with such little fuss. I used oreo cookie crumbs 1 1/2 cups. Also, I used 1 cup whipping cream at the end and did three rows of star-shaped whip cream rows, leaving center untouched. Easy, sets quickly and DELICIOUS!

A delicious dessert! I agee with a previous reviewer's cooments that you don't even need the pie crust --just put the mousse in a few elegant glasses and you'll be set! I also used chocolate chips (Hershey's) and found that it had a great flavor!

I made two of these pies (with several others) at a Thanksgiving for thirty last year, and "the crowd went wild." Everyone loved it. It is also very easy to make, so I loved it, too. One thing, I use a Silverstone-coated springform pan and the crust does tend to slide down the sides of the pan during cooking.

Yum. Next time I won't bother with the pie crust though, and just make the mousse itself. Very yummy, very easy. Made it with chocolate chips, and it was great, but would experiment with other kinds of chocolate as well. If you like chocolate mousse, you will not be disappointed.

This was *incredible* mousse. It was rich, velvety, and delicate yet stable enough to be a little forgiving. I actually made some of it in a pie crust, found there was too much mousse, and put three more cups of it in coffee mugs to chill. All of it turned out wonderfully.

Very easy and delicious!!! I used chocolate chips (save time) and a *deep dish* plain pie crust (counterbalances some of the sweetness of the mousse). Also note: it really does take several hours to set fully, so don't eat it before the allotted time or it won't be as good. YUMMMM!

This is an amazing recipe. I have made it twice, and once was for a dinner party that my parents were holding, where one guest was a gourmet chef, trained in Paris. After dinner, I brought out the chocolate mousse pie and everyone was silent as they waited for her verdict. "It goes down like velvet..." she said ... Everyone scoffed down their serving, and there wasn't enough for seconds! A definite hit, I'd say!

This is an update on my previous review- I did make the pie using peanutbutter chips instead of the chocolate (changing nothing else) My guests thought I should open my own bakery! This is the best pie we ever put in our mouth!

Definitely a crowd pleaser. I replace the semisweet with bittersweet.... then since it is so rich, I slice about 12-14 pieces rather than 8 and top the slices with whipped cream. I also refrigerate the crust before baking so the crust keeps its shape better.

I made this for Thanks Giving. It was the only pie that was finished that night. Instead of using the piping the cream we wipped it and put it on top. I used chocolate chips, they were much easier. And I used a ready made Oreo crust. This will be a holiday staple from now on. Thank you. Fast & Easy :)
