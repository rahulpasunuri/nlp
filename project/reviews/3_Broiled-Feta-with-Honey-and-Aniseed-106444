Nothing could be simpler. The combination of sweet, licorice and salty/tart is great.

I've made this two ways: with the aniseed and without it. When I made it without the aniseed I used very roughly cracked black peppercorns its place. We preferred it with the black pepper. Delicious either way.

This dish is a hit every time I do for my celebrations. The flavors are unexpectedly pleasant!! Do not forget the crushed black pepper!

I use this recipe whenever I need a last-minute appetizer. It's always a big hit. I serve it with toasted baguette slices. Only suggestion: oil the bottom of your serving plate -- otherwise the honey will stick to it as it cools.

This recipe looked a little odd but I tried it anyway and it was really good. Made the recipe as written then cut the feta up into smaller squares to eat with toothpicks. Looked nice on the appetizer plate accompanied by purple grapes.
