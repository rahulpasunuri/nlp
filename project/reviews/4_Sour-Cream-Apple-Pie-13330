I thought that this recipe was over-rated. It was an average pie: nothing to write home about. Followed recipe and was cooked perfectly with good crust but it was a let-down when we finally got to slice into it for dessert. Pretty bland & forgettable.

This is the only pie I can't live without at Thanksgiving! I make it exactly as written (except I use an all-butter pie crust from Smitten Kitchen rather than pate brisée) and it is a favorite among guests every year. You can't go wrong with this recipe, and you don't even need the whipped cream.

I've been making this recipe since 1992 because it's so fantastic! This pie is more solid than others and does not have the thick syrupy goo that oozes out of other apple pies, so if you like that, this isn't the pie for you. The sour cream in this recipe gives it an extra flavor boost that's just terrific with the apples. It also looks beautiful. The filling puffs up a bit and caramelizes.

Rating: 4
A very tasty pie. I followed the directions except I made my pate brisee with vodka in place of water (and it was perfect!). I think I still prefer regular apple pie - but this was wonderful. Tangy apples in a sour cream custard - yum!

Probably the best pie I've ever made. Absolutely irresistible. I double the recipe for the topping, but aside from that, this recipe is perfect as-is.

This was wonderful. It is true that it is better the second day as it was fairly plain the day it was baked. It was up against sticky date pudding (which also can be found on this site and is heavenly). According to my guests, this was the winner. It will be a staple at Thanksgiving from now on. I am giving 3 forks because I am not sure that I loved the crust...but it was still devine!!!

This is hands down my family's favorite for Thanksgiving. I didn't make it last year and they revolted. It's not too sweet and the topping is crunchy and adds just the right texture to make this a unique pie. I also double the topping. Since I use the frozen pie crusts that come in a package of 2, I always make enough for 2 pies so I can have leftovers! I use my apple-peeler-corer- slicer gadget for consistent slices that cook evenly. I don't always use the ginger whipped topping and noone misses it. The pie is awesome on it's own.

This is my favorite apple pie! Always gets rave reviews, and it's very simple to make. I use my own crust recipe and leave off the ginger whipped cream, but I make the filling and topping as stated. Highly recommend.

Made this today for a friend's B'day and it was really wonderful. He really liked it, especially not being too sweet. Very easy and very pretty too, in the green Emille Henry pie dish. First time to use the Pate' Brisee, and I must say it is the best ever! Will certainly be making this often. Also might double the topping, although is was nice, I'd like just a bit more.

this was my first try at making a pie. oh man was it delicious! my guest were coming back for more and asked for the recipe. with the ginger whipped cream put this pie over the top! i did double the topping as the others suggested. this is going to be a regular for us.

There was nothing special about this recipe. The topping was a little short and didn't cover the entire surface.

Rating: 3
I wish I had read the comment to double the topping. I made it as it is written and the topping was very skimpy. The apples were still too crisp after 1 hr & 15 mins of baking, but maybe the ones I had were green or something. I used Granny Smith's, and I would try again with them because you don't want the apples to get mushy or the pie will be too wet, but I think the apples I used were a little odd. The filling tastes OK, but I think I will play a little with the spices next time.

Rating: 4
The best apple pie on the planet! I replaced the cinnamon in the topping with ginger though because I felt cinnamon was too boring. Granny Smith apples are a must because of their tartness.

I've made this pie every year for Thanksgiving ever since I found it on this website in 2000. I slice my apples with the apple-peeler-corer-slicer gadget so they are pretty thin slices and are nice and soft when the pie is done. Everyone loves it! Maybe this year I'll even attempt my own crust instead of the refrigerated I usually use.

Mmmm! My first attempt at pie baking and it came out great. I used all butter for the crust. I did have to bake the pie a little longer than called for to ensure apples were cooked.

Very disappointing. Couldn't find my usual recipe for this to used this one based on reviews. Flat tasting filling (and I added cinnamon). Nice topping---I added 2 tablespoons or so of chopped walnuts. Will have to find my usual recipe because it's far superior to this one!

Rating: 3
Very easy to make but the flavor was quite mild. I'm putting this down to me using red apples (which I happened to have in abundance) rather than Granny Smiths, which presumably would have given a more tart and intenstive flavor. My family liked the pie a lot and I assume it will be worth four forks when I use the recommended apples!

Rating: 4
Wow! I made this for Christmas Eve and was pleasantly surprised at how delicious this is. I wasn't sure how well the sour cream and apples would go. It almost has a custard consistency. I love this pie- better than regular apple pie! I used a variety of different apples (whatever I happened to have) and didn't bother with the ginger whipped cream. I'll definitely make it again.

I stumbled on this recipe when looking for a sour cream and cherry pie. A very simple dish to make, my family consumed the entire pie in one night. I made my own dough so I cut out decorative leaves to bake on top. I also made this pie in a tart pan rather than a pie pan, so I ended up with extra filling. I will definately be making this again soon.

This was fabulous; (I found another prior recipe in an older Gourmet which included chopped walnuts in the topping - that's how I made it.(about 1/2 cups) )It was gobbled up and folks wished I'd made two. I will absolutely make it again.

I use this recipe to bribe family and friends!!! The one thing I, initial, found bothersome about this recipe was peeling, coring and slicing the apples. I now use unsweetened apple sauce, it gives the recipe a cheesecake-like texture that family and friends love.

This pie was a hit at Thanksgiving this year. However, it is critical not to fill the shell with too many apples. We made one pie with more filling and one with less, and the pie with less was much tastier. Fill only to the crust line, but use all the batter! Yummy.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and everyone seemed to like it. I used the Flaky Pie crust recipe from this site instead which is delicious! The pie smelled heavenly while baking and looked beautiful too when done. Nice change of pace from the usual, but I think I'll go back to a more traditional apple pie next time. I also made the bourbon pumpkin cheesecake, which is always a big hit! Won't make this pie again, but I'm glad I tried it. No one seemed to want the whipped cream with it, but this was not a big dessert crowd.

Rating: 1
We didn't love this pie - the crust was good, the topping was good, but having tasted this, I can say I'd rather have regular apple pie with a form of cream (sour cream, ice cream, cheese, whatever) on the side to complement it. The sour cream mixture didn't make the pie special; it just made it different. I guess some people will like it just for the change of pace, but overall it didn't work for me or my family. I won't be making this again.

I found this recipe when looking for a way to recreate the pie made by the "Little Pie Company". This is the only one that came close.

The other reviews seriously exaggerate the quality of this recipe. The sour cream/egg filling was unpleasant in texture and in taste and a poor pairing with the apples. I'm only grateful it was just myself and my boyfriend eating this horrible dessert and that I didn't have any guest over for dinner.

This has been a Thanksgiving dinner staple since Gourmet first published the recipe in 1992. It always disappears, often before the sweet potato pecan pie (our other Thanksgiving standard dessert). I serve both with whipped cream flavored with brandy & Grand Marnier. Try it, and you'll never return to ordinary apple pie.

As a neophyte pie baker, I found this recipe easy to make. The crust came out fine and I've received positive feedback. I've made this recipe twice, and both times the sour cream seems to separate. I've followed the recipe closely. Anyone know what I'm doing wrong?

Unless you simply must have an apple pie but are tired of the traditional, I would stay away from this one. The crust is great and topping is great but the filling didn't work for any of us - far too tart. Maybe a mix of apples would have helped.

I've made this recipe 4 times in the last month. It is truly one of the best Apple Pies I have ever made. I don't agree with doubling the topping but I am not a humongous sweet tooth. I felt it was too much when I did. When I did it 1-1/2 times it was much better. Also, it seems to need longer than 1-1/2 hours to bake. I just do it until it is brown.

This pie was incredible! The crust was light and flaky, and the filling was so unusual! I'm definately making this one again for Thanksgiving. I doubled the topping as well, and it was perfect. Make sure you slice the apples VERY thinly, so that they cook all the way through.

Very good pie. I agree with most of the reviewers that the topping should be doubled.

Rating: 4
Best company pie ever. Make this when everyone else is making the typical apple pie. More sophisticated and easier [only has one crust to work with]. I have been making this since 1992. Must double the topping and make sure that you use exactly the amount of apples called for in the recipe- by weight. Normally I am not so fussy about "weighing" fruit for fillings and would just "guesstimate". You will have either too much custard [soggy] or not enough [dry and curdled]so, weigh the apples. Use an apple suited for pies such as spies [best for pies]. I sometimes make this in a 9" tart pan with a loose removable bottom and use pate brisee for crust. [very crisp but sturdy enough to take out of the tart pan]

Rating: 4
WOW! THE best apple pie!!! I also doubled the topping. I thought the recipe spoke for itself, but a friend of mine had mediocre results. All I can suggest is to make sure it's fully cooked! You'll know it's pretty much there when it's all browned and bubbly!

Rating: 4
Yummers! I'm glad I read the reviews before baking. I doubled the topping as a result, and I see now I never would have had enough to cover the pie had I not. I kind of wish the filling was a bit sweeter, but I think that just makes me that much happier that I doubled the topping.

YOWZA! This was the most delicious apple pie I've ever had or made! Even my husband, who is strictly a cherry pie guy, loved it. I did double the topping and I used a refrigerated pie dough (Pillsbury). Ohh did it ever fill the house with delicious baking smells as it baked and I was amazed and very pleased with the way it looked when I took it out of the oven. Mounded high with apples and topping, truly the most beautiful pie I've ever made. When I cut into it, the inside was just as delicious looking. Mmmmm what a smooth and satisfying taste!! The type of pie that makes you close your eyes and moan upon tasting it. I can hardly wait to make it again. A WINNER!!

Delicious! Very tart and sweet. I doubled the topping as suggested by another reviewer, and used fat-free sour cream and egg beaters rather than eggs. I also added an extra apple, which made this a humongous delicious mound of a pie - my boyfriend's eyes glowed when he saw it. Perfect.

I'm wondering why some of you try a recipe for the second time when it was a dud the first time around? Do you think Epicurious is the end to all recipe searches? I enjoy this web site but there are literally thousands of fantastic and delicious recipes everywhere you look. Why waste your time trying to make a loser work just because other cooks rate a particular one as excellent. Did you ever think that maybe their tastes just aren't the same as yours? I'm not trying to be mean, I'm just puzzled.

This recipe yields a truly wonderful pie. The texture is creamy and smooth, with the delicate flavor of the sour cream filling serving as a beautiful counterpoint to the tart-ish apples. Delicious crust, and not at all difficult. I think this will replace my tried and true apple pie recipe. One word of caution, however: you will need AT LEAST double the amount of topping for a 10-inch pie.

I worried that substituting plain low-fat yogurt for the sour cream would ruin it, but it turned out tart and creamy anyway. I was pleased with the taste, and everyone who tasted it liked it. I would have liked the taste cinnamon glaze to be more incorporated though, might mix with yogurt before baking next time.

I have made this a couple of times and now the family expects this for every Thanksgiving. Fresh apples are important as is keeping the dough cold. I made the dough the night before and stored it in the refidgerator. Once it was rolled out I kept it cold until it was filled and popped it right into the preheated oven. (Pate Brisee tips from the Joy of Cooking). The topping should be kept cold until used.

I've been making a Silver Palate version of this dish for years and years, and this one is just as good. On top of it, the crust for this one is MUCH easier to make!!! I would also note that the first time piecooker should be sure to keep all the crust indgredients CHILLED--like after you cut up the shortening and butter, roll it in flour, and pop it in the fridge or freezer--if it gets to warm, its hard to handle. Also, I used a food but just pulse the machine so that the heat from the engine in the processor does not heat up the pie crust that you want to stay cool. I doubled the topping also, and used 5 small apples that weighed exactly 51/4lbs., which is why I think some people did not have enough custard if they used large apples! Overall, FAB-U-LOUS!!!!!! I couldn't stop eating the apples raw in the custard!

This was an OK pie. There was not enough custard to go with the apples and there should have been more crumb topping. The pie should also be kept in the oven longer to cook the apples more. I think I'll forego the crumb topping (use a top crust) and decrease the apples next time I make this.
