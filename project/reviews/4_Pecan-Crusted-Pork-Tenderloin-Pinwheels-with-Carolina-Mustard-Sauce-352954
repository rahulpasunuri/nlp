Excellent! So flavorful, moist and delicious. I took the advise of another reviewer and put these in the oven instead of grilling them. They turned out famously, but I think I might try to grill them indoors next time since the bacon didn't look as yummy as it did in the photo. It was cooked, but not dark and crispy like I would have wanted it to be. That Mustard sauce is heavenly! Definitely a new family favorite! I thought cutting the strips was going to be difficult, but it was surprisingly easy. I also just sprinkled the pecans on the spirals, then topped with the sauce. YUM!

Delicious dish! Was obviously going to need some work based on gaps in the recipe as written, but even after reading other reviews, I wasn't sure how to approach it. My particular solution was to partially cook the bacon, butterfly tenderloin and pound it flat & use many more toothpicks. I mixed the (finely chopped) nuts into 1/2 of the mustard sauce and pressed the pinwheels into the mixture, flattening them somewhat. I refrigerated the pinwheels for about 3 hours prior to grilling. Cooked for a shorter time. I served over sauted spinach. They stayed togehter well and were so juicy & good that I didn't realize until later that I had forgotten to reheat and serve the remaining sauce along with the meal. That is a happy surprise as it was totally unneeded but will give me another opportunity to enjoy that yummy sauce with a different kind of meat tonight.

This is a phenomenal recipe. Cooked like the recipe stated only we chopped the pecans & mixed them into the mustard sauce as some of the others had recommended. We made for our Couples Gourmet group on May 6 & they all LOVED it. And we've already made it again & are taking it as the appetizer to our Wine Club this weekend as a pairing to our Cline 2010 Ancient Vines Mourvedre. Thank you for a WONDERFUL recipe...easy to prepare & delicious! We will make it again & again!

I left out the salt in the pecan crust and it was still way too salty-all three of us agreed.

Amazing!!! Slight shortcut- rolled the pork & bacon into pinwheels and placed into a baking dish. Mixed the pecans into the mustard sauce (also delicious), poured over the pinwheels, and baked for 30 minutes at 350. Phenomenal dish!

I loved the flavor of this but I'm not entirely sure the pinwheels were worth the effort. From the reviews I read, I think some people thought the sides were supposed to be coated in nuts but according to the recipe it was just the outside of the pinwheel. The nuts still didn't stay on very well though. I will definitely try this again but will attempt a different presentation. And how on earth did y'all get a pork tenderloin sliced into 6 filets? Best I could manage was 3 so I cut those in half and then pounded them. :)

I took a really big shortcut with this and did not make the pinwheels. I took a Pork Tenderloin and sliced it down the middle to butterfly it. I added 2 thick slices of bacon and pinned the pork back together. I don't know what "Carolina Mustard Sauce" is so I made up my own. 2 TBS Fancy Mustard, 2 TBS Honey, 1 TBS Balsamic Vinegar. I rubbed the mustard mixture over the pork then some coarsly chopped pecans. It was a great hit. It will be done again.

whole family loved. I am not surprised others had issue w/ pecans not sticking (too early in prep), so I did the following: cut pinwheels then add sauce on both sides. press in pecans on one side and put that grill side down. rest of pecans i mixed in a bit of leftover marinade and added to 2nd side after we flipped over. worked great. Next time I'll wrap pinwheels w/ bacon on outside (directions sounded to me to put on pork and roll, putting it inside) and I think that would help cook more of the bacon. Due to time we did not make sauce in advance yet really enjoyed it--don't let that stop you from trying the recipe.

This was better than I though it was going to be. I made the sauce the day ahead and it was amazing. We also didn't grill it as long and the meat was tender and moist. After reading the other reviews about the pecans falling off during cooking, I ground the nuts very fine and placed them on top of the pinwheels. Then I basted the pinwheels with the sauce. We grilled the non-nut side first, which seemed to help the pecans stay on. I will definitly make this again.

This recipe is absolutely delicious! Used thick-cut bacon and cubed pork tenderloin, and marinated overnight in the mustard sauce. Rolled up the day of, and grilled just a couple minutes on each side. Delicious, and will be a definite summer favorite!

I was a little bit worried that my family would not like this recipe but they ended up loving it! In order to keep the pecan crust from falling off like a previous reviewer, I browned the rolls in a grill pan and then baked them in the oven to 160 degrees. The sauce was really flavorful. I also pre-cooked my bacon. Even my son who does not usually eat meat loved these!

Great pock dish

Both the sauce and the pecan-crusted pinwheels were very easy to put together. I found that just a half recipe of the sauce was sufficient to coat the pork, with plenty left over as a dipping sauce for each bite. With the halved pinwheels only about 1/2" thick, both husband and I were dubious about the cooking time, and found that 4- 5 minutes per side was just right. We do love the sauce, and will make that again for other pork dishes. The pinwheels, however, were a fun experiment that I don't feel compelled to try again. Much of the pecan crust simply fell off during cooking, so we did not get much flavor from that.

Delicious! Great flavor. Fun presentation. Made the sauce the same night, so while I'm sure it's better after 24 hours, don't let that keep you away from trying this one. I also pre-cooked the bacon in the oven for about 10 minutes before creating the pinwheels to ensure the crispness desired by my family. Pay attention to inserting the toothpicks on two parallel planes to make the last cut easier. Easy & excellent!
