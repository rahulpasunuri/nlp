The amount of green onion completely took over this dish. Would reduce onion by 1/2, or maybe saute lightly to sweeten them a bit. Cumin was a nice touch. I found the potato prep tedious for what seemed like and easy recipe. Good idea to use Simply potatoes (ready cooked).

These were lovely, really easy and made a nice change from mashed potatoes.

I'll make this dish again, but not with cumin.Too taco-y. Mom and I both love potato cakes, but the cumin just didn't belong. We had it with the garlic-rosemary steaks and the cumin just didn't go with them marinade.

I followed Kimber's lead and used the Simply Potatoes, which worked fine (and saved work & time - thanks Kimber!) Using my cast iron pan and keeping the stove at a fairly even med/high heat gave me nice crisp cakes. The next time I make these, I'll increase the cumin a bit, though.

I cheated by using the Simply Potatoes Shredded Hashbrowns and they worked just fine. I only made a couple of the "cakes" and used one egg and that seemed to be just right. I served these with the Tender Pork Tenderloin from this site and they compliment each other perfectly. Enjoy! KIMBER

Served these with beef tenderloin with port-rosemary sauce last night for guests. Added a little more cumin than called for and loved the flavor, but my cakes turned out a little burned on the outside and a little mushy inside. I cooked them 8 minutes on one side and 7 on the other on medium-hight heat. Any suggestions on that?

These potato cakes were wonderful. Tried a variation of them omitting the cumin, but adding a pinch (change to suit yout taste) of curry powder, and dusted them with paprika as they finished frying, promarily for the colour. Served then with BBQ chicken breasts and fresh garden peas. YUMMY!!!

These were great. I used 4 small boiling potatoes, and two bunches of scallions, so my mixture was a little egg-ey, but they were still good. After boiling my potatoes, I simply cooled them in cold water before I grated them. Then I used a food processor with the grate option, and I thought the texture was perfect. I felt that they should have been browned more (I didn't brown them for the full 8 minutes per side - I was in a hurry), to be crispy, like frites or hash browns. I served these with broiled salmon and asparagus with gorgonzola butter (on this site), and drizzled a little of the gorgonzola butter on the salmon - the meal was quite a feast for a weekday meal.

What a versatile side dish. The subtle flavors of this dish would compliment any main dish. I chopped my onion very finely, and had no problem with the onions being crunchy. I also added some cajun seasoning, paprika, a generous amount of garlic powder and a little season salt. They were a tad bland and could have used a some more salt. I liked how nicely they browned. I would definitely make this dish again.

Pretty good- I reduced the cumin by half, could have used a little more. Didn't have enough green onion, so I also chopped some vidalia- good flavor, but onions could have been precooked a little as they were still a little too crunchy for the texture of the cake. With a little experimenting, these could be really good.

Cakes would have been greatly helped by more salt. What should have been a great combo of tastes (they sure smelled goof) somehow seemed to miss the mark - despite the cumin I found these bland.

Very nice. Easy to make. Only used about 3/4 tspn. of cumin. Not over powering. Will make this dish again.
