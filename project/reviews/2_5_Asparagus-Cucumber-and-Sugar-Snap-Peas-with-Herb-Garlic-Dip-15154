When I made this recipe I cut it in half. I also added a bit more garlic. The asparagus was nice parboiled but I didn't think it was necessary for peas. I really like this recipe because it is lowfat, healthy and sooo good. I like the different variety of vegetables and I also added some french breakfast radishes. Since we still have asparagus, I will keep making this dish.
