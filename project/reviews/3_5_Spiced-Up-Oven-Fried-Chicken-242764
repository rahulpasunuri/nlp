I have to say, I was a little skeptical given other reviews of a similar recipe (which now seems to be gone) but I made this almost exactly to the recipe. My husband can't eat gluten but loves this kind of food. I used cornflakes and some gluten free breadcrumbs. I didn't have smoked paprika so just used regular. It was delish!

def. follow carla66's additions...this chicken was not only super juicy and delicious but very crunchy to. I had no prob. getting the cornflakes to stick. My boyfriend even loved it (and he the cook in the relationship and very selective about what he like) I would def. make it again!!!

deansue, if you want to hawk a grocery store, don't do it on epicurious. For the record, this recipe was easy and got excellent reviews from my kids.

Pretty good. Definitely not fried chicken, but tasty nonetheless.

Why bother with this or any other oven baked recipe. Go to COSTCO. You can't possibly match their roasted chickens. Even the late Julia Childs said she couldn't make a tastier chicken. Only downside is it's not crunchy. But I'll give up crunch for flavor.

i am going to try this tonight, might use the buttermilk and the flour, egg/bmilk, bread method. any ideas?

try taking 2 cups of buttermilk and 1 Tbsp garlic salt and soaking the chicken for 30 min. Then, dust in flour before dipping in the egg mixture and then in the FINELY crushed crumbs...the coating will stick very well and still be nicely crisp after baking.

very good alternative to fried chicken. i was too lazy to go out to by paprika, which could have probably improved the taste of the recipe, but i used an equal/slightly larger amount of cayenne pepper instead. My friends loved it. I did also notice that the cornflakes did not stick too well to the chicken; as a solution, i tried putting piling a little extra cornflakes on top of my pieces of chicken (including drumsticks) when placing them on the baking sheet. this gave at least one side of the chicken a very crunchy texture.

You're supposed to use plain (unsweetened) corn flakes FreshCope, not Sugar Frosted Flakes. But it's good you do not feed your dog chicken, as we all know, ingesting the bones could kill him.

i would substitute the milk with buttermilk Add Garlic onion and some kind of chili powder

The taste is okay, but the crust doesn't adhere well to the chicken. There are better oven-fried chicken recipes out there. The best thing about this recipe is the use of smoked paprika. It really adds a lot of good flavor.

Don't worry about the dog, FreshCope, he probably won't share his food with you either!

I'd like someone to fry this recipe and tell us all how it turns out. Could you handle the crunch?!

I don't have to make this before I tell you that this is the best chicken this side of Popeye's. My mother always made it this way, and I have been making it for years.
