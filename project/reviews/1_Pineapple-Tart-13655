I usually put in milk powder when I make the shell and I use a lot more pineapples and a lot less sugar.Chop up the pineapples and put them in a huge pot. Cook them slowly over a low heat until the juices dry up. You may add a little sugar if you like. I find that this makes a more appetizing and satisfying pineapple tart.
