Wonderful! I did change it though--I used chicken broth instead of water and subbed sherry for wine (didn't have any wine). I also left out the onion since I didn't have any in the house. I added toasted sunflower seeds and roasted chickpeas that I had tossed with cumin and cinnamon. It was delicious. Served with Roasted Eggplant, Feta and Tomato from this site and roasted asparagus. I didn't measure the cinnamon and probably used less than 2 tsp, I just did it to taste and it worked out just fine.

Am I the only one that thought there was too much cinnamon in this? I used 1/2 the amount and it was still too much in my opinion. Also, I think that the flavor just didn't pop for me. It was sort of flat overall...like it needed lemon or mint or some other zingy ingredient. I can't say I'll make it again b/c there are so many other great recipes for couscous out there.

Simple, but very tasty and I'd imagine versatile too. Be careful the water you add to the raisins isn't too hot, otherwise the texture and color will be ruined.

I used 1/2C raisins and 1/4C dried apricots for some variety. My boyfriend's mother from Morocco loved this recipe!

oops, I meant "melt the butter and chop the onions"

I love this recipe, even when I don't have saffron. having made it so many times, I've sort of evolved my prep to be more streamlined: while the raisins are plumping in th4e hot water, I melt the onions and chop the onions. then I saute the onions in the butter (I use all the butter at this point, but have reduced it as well to no ill effects). Once they start to caramelize and get transclucent/light brown on the edges, I add salt, pepper and the cinnamon. then I dump in the water AND the raisins. When it comes to a boil I add the couscous and run off the flame. after 10 minutes covered it is perfect--I add the toasted almonds and a little more chunky salt. Soooooooooooooooo good!

I gave this recipe 3 forks because I think a couple of things could be changed to make it better/easier. Instead of reconstituting the raisins, you can throw them in to the boiling liquid - which should be stock IMO (I used vegetable) I sauteed the onion in the same pan i cooked the couscous, it gives the grain more flavor. I also think using Olive oil would be a better option, but all in all it's a quick, flavorful dish!

great couscous recipe. Served it with a Moroccan eggplant chicken dish (the recipe is on this site also) and it was a success with everyone!

Great with the Moroccan chicken. I modified and use 1/2 c raisins and added 1/4 c dried sliced apricots and 1/2 c toasted coconut.

Easy and very good. Definitely try with the Moroccan chicken.

Delicious way to enjoy couscous. Although I wonder if currants wouldn't be better than raisins--I'm not a big fan of raisins in my grain dishes. Still, this dish is really about the saffron-cinnamon combo with the almonds.

So easy and works great with the eggplant and moroccan chicken. Everyone will be licking their fingers while eating.

Love this side dish. I've already made it twice and it comes out well each time. Goes great with chicken or fish. Very mild but tasty flavor. I substituted the saffron threads with a quarter teaspoon of turmeric and used white raisins. I also omitted almonds the last time I made this dish. It was delicious either way, but would rather have the almonds than go w/out. Definitely an easy dish to spice up any meal!

I really liked this recipe. I had to make a few changes due to what I had in the house. I used whole wheat couscous and left out the wine. I also used 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 water to add flavor instead of all water. I think this added to the recipe, I do not think I would like the wine. The dish has subtle flavor, it is not super strong. I served it with a Middle Eastern seasoned grilled chicken and vegetables and it was amazing.

I've made this dish a few times and we always enjoy it. It is nicely spiced and can stand alone,but isn't so strong that it doesn't support the main.

I tried this receipe and it was excellent! It had a nice exotic flavor-I served it with tandoori rubbed pork tenderloin. I subbed Chinese 5-spice for the cinnamon which I think gave the flavor a little more depth. Will make this again for sure. tandor
