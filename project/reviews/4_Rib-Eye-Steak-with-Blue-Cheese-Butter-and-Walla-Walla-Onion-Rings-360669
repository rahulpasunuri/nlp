Perfection! I did need to add a bit more beer than called for in the recipe. Not a problem though, just add the beer until you get the consistency you're looking for. Want a thicker coating, add less beer. Thinner, tempura like coating, add more beer. This is a keeper!

I tried making only the onions and they were amazing! but instead of vodka I used 2 tablespoons of milk, and they were great.

I have only made the onion rings, but they are outstanding. Just like you would get at the fair. So easy to make and delicious.

Add roasted garlic cloves to Blue Butter and this recipe would be over the top good.

I agree with all the reviews. Make sure you add extra beer as the current mix makes a dough and not a batter. I actually doubled the beer. The lemon zest was too over powering. I will cut it back next time. I may just leave it out and replace it with something else like garlic.

i agree w/ decreasing the amount of lemon zest - it overpowered my blue cheese (maytag). i'd cut it by half and add to taste, first, if making this recipe again. garlic also would have been a nice touch.

Great dish. On the butter I would go just a little less on the lemon zest, and maybe add a touch of garlic. I used a quick onion ring batter and it was great, next time I will try the onion ring recpie used here though just to see. Definitley recomend.

this is so simple and so good! for the rings, I used a half cup of beer and what i had was dough instead of batter. you'll need about ten ounces of beer and you get a tempura consistency batter. everybody really loved these rings, they were pretty darn happy with the steaks also,
