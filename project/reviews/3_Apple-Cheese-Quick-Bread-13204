This was delicious, so easy and fast, and definitely NOT dry! I cooked it for about 45 minutes (I was worried it would overcook based on other comments), but put it back in the oven for 5 more minutes and it was still incredibly moist. (Other cooks might just want to keep an eye on it during the last 10 minutes of baking if you are worried it will dry out.) I used heirloom, very juicy and sweet (about 18 brix) apples, subbed cheddar for swiss cheese, and omitted the walnuts because I don't like nuts in bread. Next time I will add grated cheddar to the top of the bread.

This is absolutely superb! It is moist and so flavorful! I don't understand the comments about it being dry. When I grated the apples (peeled), there was a bit of juice that collected in the bowl, maybe 1/4 to 1/2 a cup, and I added that in. Would that make the difference? I don't know but this is fantastic bread with or without cream cheese. The only changes I made was to use margarine instead of butter, and I used half red delicious, and half granny smith apples.

I'm collecting apple recipes for a friend who recently moved to the mountains of NC (surrounded by apple orchards). So, I've made this exactly as written and with modifications. I found it to be dry and bland as written. But, am really happy with the result after minor modifications. I didn't care for the swiss cheese. I found that either cheddar or smoked gouda were superior substitutions. Like one of the previous posters, I enjoy the flavor hit that comes from sprinkling a little extra cheese on top of the loaf during the last 15 minutes of baking. I also found that adding 1/4 - 1/3 cup of apple sauce (1/4 cup if commercial, 1/3 if home made) and a handful of chopped, dried apples plumped in Calvados significantly improved both the flavor and the texture. I also tried substituting apple butter for the apple sauce and didn't care for the results. The texture was heavier and the flavor was too sweet. Note: If you use a commercially prepared apple sauce be sure to check the label. Applesauce that has added sugar is just too cloying. There are a couple brands that are just apples with a pinch of salt. Next best thing to home made.

Nice flavor, but dry, dry, dry. I made it exactly according to the recipe, but had a hard time even spreading the cream cheese on without it falling apart.

I made it according to original recipe and it was good, but I wanted a little less sweet, little more substance, so I used the following with excellent results: 1/3 organic turbinado sugar, 1/3 raw organic honey, I substituted whole-wheat flour for fuldkornsmel" - or organic whole-grain wheat flour (it's crunchy), 140g shredded organic emmenthaler, 2 medium sized organic local apples, 100 g walnuts. Results are a hearty "rye bread" (in Danish rugbrød) substance to the bread. While still a little warm, served with some whipped vanilla cream and cognac for dessert. In a word-WOW.

This was a great way to use some extra shredded cheese I had in the fridge. I used colby jack with granny smiths and it worked well - brought to a neighborhood gathering where nobody could believe it had apples and cheese. I skipped the walnuts but found that the whole wheat flour gave it a nuttier taste. Tastes like a lightly sweet quick bread, it's just hard to place the flavors. Very good, especially with cream cheese as suggested.

After reading the reviews of others I stuck to the quantities. The only change I made was to sprinkle more grated cheese on top for the last few minutes. This gave it a nice taste. My only complaint is that the apples seemed to hibernate to one end of the bread. Maybe the oven was not the right temperature?

The recipe was just delicious! I left out the nuts and used red juicy apples. It wasn't too hard to make at all and came out perfect. My dad and I will have fun making this recipe again.

Very good. There is not a very pronounced flavor of apple or cheese, but it comes together very nicely. I love the wheat and the honey with the subtle apple and cheese flavors. It will be wonderful served with a nice wine. I plan to do that this evening. Great texture. I'll be making this again. (an added bonus: the kids love it too!!)

I have made apple cheese breads before and I didn't think this one was very good. The dough seemed really dry so I had to add a few tbsp of milk. The aroma is nice, texture so so, but I found the flavor to be mushy. Granted, I used a sweeter softer kind of apple, and I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup, and I used cheddar, but the apple and cheese flavors aren't distinct at all. As some others have said, a good way to use up extra apples.

I love to make quick breads but was very disappointed with this recipe. It has a nice texture but no flavor.

Well, I was searching for a recipe i could make quickly ... I always have a few blocks of cheese and apples on hand, so I knew this would be a contender. Brought it to a 'potluck' and everyone loved it. Regards,

I was not impressed with this at all. Maybe i did something wrong but it is not worth trying again. This was one taste and in the garbage!

Great way to use up old apples. The bread was moist and the cheese gave it a nice creamy flavor; I used Monteray Jack and Almonds with good results.

This bread was delicious, and it looks great. I used cheddar instead of swiss cheese and left out the walnuts. My loaf needed more than the time prescribed to bake fully.
