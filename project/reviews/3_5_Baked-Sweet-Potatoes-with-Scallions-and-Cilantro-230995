I quartered 3 large sweet potatoes and microwaved them for about 15 minutes. Then I spread the butter mixture on all the pieces. After it melted, I tossed the potatoes. My family loved it. I also used this butter mixture on regular baked potatoes. Yum!

Fresh cilantro is what the recipe calls for. For those who can't find cilantro, you might substiture with lemon balm or lime juice. I add lime juice as well as the cilantro. I use evoo because I can't have butter and I also, use a handful of cilantro.

This was delicious! I'm not even a huge fan of cilantro, but this was rich, yet crisp and refreshing at the same time. Will absolutely add this to my regular recipe rotation.

I love it when simple recipes are this good! I didn't have any scallions, so I diced a little sweet onion instead. The flavors go together beautifully -- I will make it again!

Like so many people, I strayed from the recipe a bit. I instead used a pinch of herbes de provence with some salt and pepper in the butter. My sweet potatoes took about 45 minutes and were perfectly softened. Yum!

I hate cilantro so I substituted sage. Obviously quite a different flavor but yummy. I think this would be good with any fresh chopped herbs that you might have on hand.

Very easy to make, and I liked the sweet/salty contrast. May use the butter mixture with regular potatoes.

Simple to make and declared a winner by all at the table!

really good and simple..thank you australia for pointing out the difference in coriander and cilantro. I always wondered why the dried coriander had a completely different taste from the fresh cilantro. So now I've learned that one is a seed and the other a leaf. I used the fresh cilantro in this recipe but the dried seeds, although giving the potatoes a different taste, would probably be as good.

I don't understand why only a little more than half of the people who had this would make it again. I thought it was a very simple, yet tasty dish that really showed off the flavor of sweet potatoes without covering it up like other, sickenly sweet, sweet potato dishes do. The cilantro and scallions were mild, but provided an interesting contrast to the sweet potatoes. I let everyone spoon their own butter into the sweet potatoes. Overall, it was very easy to whip this up and I would make it again in an instant!

In England and Australia coriander is both the herb and the spice (ie, what Americans call cilantro is the leafy part of the corriander plant (the herb), and the seeds of the same plant are the spice). I hope this helps our UK cook!

To Bev from England: Coriander may indeed work well, but as you correctly pointed out, cilantro is an herb, coriander is a spice.

To the cook in England, cilantro is also known as Coriander. It's used a lot in Mexican and Asian cooking.

I keep coming across recipes on this site which use cilantro. I assume it's a herb but have never seen it in England. Can anyone suggest an alternative?

So good! I used regular salted butter and had to add a little salt after that. But, oh that cilantro flavor....

VERY flavorful - I might cut down on the herbs next time...it was pretty intense and didn't really go with the rest of the meal - but I will try again...

Very easy and tasty. Instead of all the butter, I used only 1 Tblspn butter, and 1 Tblspn reduced fat sour cream. I also added a squeeze of lime juice to the mashed potatoes to freshen up the flavor. I made it last night, and liked it enough to make again this evening.
