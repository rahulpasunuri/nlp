I changed this recipe a lot, but it was so amazing when served. I sauteed the thyme in butter and then added the scallions until golden. Then, I added 4 TB dry white wine and reduced by half. I next added 1 TB creme fraiche. Meanwhile, I sauteed the bay scallops in butter until golden and then added the wine and thyme/scallion mixture. It was amazingly delicious served over fresh pasta.

This dish made me feel like an accomplished chef. It was very easy to prepare, and the flavors and textures were sublime, despite the fact I eliminated the mushrooms all together. We had the freshest bay scallops from Menemesha and this recipe added a touch of elegance to our Saturday night dinner. Butter and cream are always a special treat. I served Brussel sprouts with crumbled bacon on the side and a sliced kiwi salad. Very nice meal.

I made this for my family and it was very well received. I served broccoli rabe on the side which compliments this dish well. I had some time after I made the mushrooms and before I needed to cook the scallops and all commented on the fact that it smelled wonderful. It is a lovely change of pace and I may experiment with butter and cheese with the polenta (a request by my Italian mother, polenta is just not the same without it for her) Make it and enjoy.

I don't eat seafood so I made this without the scallops. I've never made polenta before and this was very easy. Down South we call 'polenta' grits! The mushroom sauce was excellent. I forgot to add the bread crumbs but the dish was exceptional. I will definitely make this again!

Excellent. Have made this several times - great meal for company. A variation I've used is to buy the polenta "round" in the produce section, slice into 1/4 - 1/3 inch slices, brush with olive oil, italian herb seasoning and broil slightly. Serve the scallop/mushroom dish on top of the polenta rounds. We likes the texture and slight crisp top of the polenta rounds against the creaminess of the scallops/mushrooms.

I just don't get it. This dish was at best just OK -- and way too heavy for bay scallops, IMHO. I even made the parsley breadcrumbs from scratch as indicated -- and thought they added nothing but more overkill to both the polenta AND the poor scallops. Maybe using large sea scallops . . . but I'm not sure I liked anything well enough to try it again.

This was amazing all my favorite things, rolled into one fantastic dish! Great in the winter. I did use the polenta, although it was pre-made. But I feel like the dish really wouldn't be nearly as good without the polenta's creamy, corny-ness. Also, the breadcrumbs are something definitely not to be left out- they add a whole crunchiness thing, which makes the dish so much more interesting. I did make my own breadcrumbs, which I think helped too. The only thing I think might be an improvement was that the scallops could probably be added to the mushroom mixture and simmered for a minute or two, just to meld the flavors a little. Maybe do this instead of sautéeing, because it would be very easy to end up with rubbery, overcooked scallops otherwise.

This was really nice. It was a bit heavy as a first course, though. I think if I made it again, I would serve it as a main.

this was quick and easy. I served it over angel hair.

This dish is absolutely fabulous, my family loved it. I served it for Christmas eve. We are big polenta fans, but this dish is exceptional. The breadcrumbs make the dish, however - don't omit that! It is quite surprising. A lovely, elegant, easy recipe.

no way! the polenta is awesome with it. i just made it tonight for the 2nd time, and it turned out even better than i remembered. the polenta has good texture contrast with the mushrooms and scallops. it's a neutral canvas for the delicious sauce.

We omitted the polenta but other than using oyster mushrooms and seafood stock made the recipe as written. Absolutly wonderful! The sauce would be delightful with chicken or white fish, and possibly veal as well. I like the wild rice mix idea, and think potatoes would be good, but suspect that the polenta will overpower the rich delicate flavors.

The fam and I really liked this dish. I forgot to add the bread crumbs,they were not missed.I served it over pasta,not polenta,although i would like to try it that way. Easy, good and guest worthy.

Easy to make and very, very tasty. Now a "regular" in our home.

Didn't make the polenta or bread crumb topping but the scallops were great. It is especially hard to find good recipes for bay scallops and this one works well and has a sophisticated taste.

A real crowd pleaser. Fairly easy to make. Time consuming in the prep area, but worth all the work. I'd reccommend grilling the polenta rather than serving it soft.

Elegant and tasty. Used sea scallops and shiitakes, crimini, and oyster mushrooms. Added a little more cream, and I think next time I'll add more sherry. I want to try it again, because I think I put too much polenta in the bowl. It didn't dominate, but I wanted to taste more of the sherry cream. My fault, because I split the mushrooms and scallops (3/4 lb) between two of us but halved the polenta (thinking the recipe served 4). Definitely trying again in the future, perhaps when guests are over. BTW, the recipe does indeed say to salt/pepper the polenta as well as the scallop and mushroom mixture.

This was rich and savory, I loved the fresh thyme and the texture of the wild mushrooms. It was very simple, but it helps to have all ingrediants prepped. I don't care for polenta, so I put it over wild rice - the nutty flavor worked well with the mushrooms. Using nice big sea scallops works as well.

I found this dish to be easy to prepared, wonderful to present, and delicious! Perhaps other reviewers found it bland because the recipe doesn't call for salt, which I added (with pepper) to both the polenta and the mushroom cream sauce. I used more sherry and less broth, which also added more depth to the flavors. Finally, I used shiitakes, which have a wonderful flavor. I loved it, and so did my guests!

Yuck! This recipe is totally without flavor. It is bland to say the least and the polenta does absolutely nothing for the dish. Save your $$$$$

Delicious! I used shitake and royal trumpet mushrooms. Added just a touch of red peper flakes and a bit more sherry and cream (wanted to get rid of the last of the sherry and the cream). My husband called it great comfort food.

Bland and without any punch. Not worth the money and effort

A great romantic dish (I halved the recipe and served for two). Used a mixture of shiitake, oyster, and sliced portabella mushrooms. Simple and delicious. Not too difficult for this inexperienced male cook on Valentines Day!

I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I would do differently next time is to use a better quality sherry. This was an excellent dish, with a great combination of flavors. I will definetly make this again.

I really enjoyed this interesting combination of flavors. Be sure to make your own breadcrumbs, leave them coarse & season them well. I added more sherry than the recipe called for & used a lot more thyme & chopped parsley in the mushroom mixture. Baretta instant polenta worked well (Cost Plus). I paired it with a Viognier - excellent. I'll make this again.
