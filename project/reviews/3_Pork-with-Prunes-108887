This is fantastic! I have served this to many friends and they all want the receipe. The dried plums breakdown into a delicious 'chocholate' sauce.

This dish is just awful! Pork and prunes should not come anywhere near each other.

I only used 1/2 cup of water. I have a pot with a tight fitting lid for braising. You really don't need that much liquid. The pork came out nice and tender and the sauce (after a brief reduction) was smooth, sweet and savory. Great cool weather dish.
