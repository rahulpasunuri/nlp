If you LOVE garlic like my husband & I do...then you'll also love this recipe.

so it looks like what the reviewer from boston is saying is to skip this recipe all together. If you want the same taste with less the time of her alterations, I would suggest using the garlic-herb mashed potatoes recipe on this site. It uses Boursin so you have the creamy garlic/herb taste without the time of making a cream sauce.

Way too garlicky!! You have to really love garlic to appreciate or enjoy this recipe. You couldn't even taste the potatoes!

In addition to adding more garlic to the finished product, drop 4-6 (or more!!) peeled cloves, cut in half, into the water you use to boil the potatoes. When you drain the potatoes, don't throw out the cloves, just mash them in with the rest of the ingredients.

For maximum flavor, this recipe requires at least a full head of garlic and preferably two (yes, two). Separate the garlic cloves and remove the skins from them. Simmer the cloves in 2/3 cup of heavy cream over medium-low heat for 25 minutes, or until garlic is tender and cream reduces and thickens. Mash the potatoes by hand (not with a food processor, for the love of God, which only results in gluey mashed potatoes) along with the garlic-cream mixture, a half a stick of butter and loads of kosher salt and freshly ground pepper. This treatment completely redeems this recipe.

The seemingly generous amount of garlic might not be enough. I used an old Finnish method of adding genral flavour - add 2 - 3 chopped potatoes, that have been softened in boiling milk. You might also want to boil some carrots and/ur turnips with the potatoes. It adds both taste and looks.

My rendition of the recipe- add 1. heavy cream 2. butter 3. cream cheese 4. parmesean cheese 5. mozarella cheese 6. roasted garlic 7. green onions. Enjoy! My family does! (don't forget the mentos afterward!)

Despite the large amount of garlic, the garlic flavor somehow gets lost in these. In addition, they weren't very flavorful overall. Maybe cooking the potatoes in broth would help, or adding sour cream or buttermilk. I ended up adding cream cheese, salt, pepper, sugar and parmesan cheese, and these were still not all that good.

these were very tasty,but the consistancy was a bit gluey(i didn't put them in the food processor).but i used yukon gold potatoes. maybe they have more starch or something. any ideas? next time i'll follow the recipe exactly.

A great taste. If you like garlic you will never go back to regular mashed potatoes.
