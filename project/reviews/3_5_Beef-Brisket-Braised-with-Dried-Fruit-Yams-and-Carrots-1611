This is delicious and will now be my go-to brisket recipe. Two things though - salt the meat and, before you do anything with the vegetables, sear it. You will miss out on that essential "crust" that's so delicious if you just add it once the vegetable are cooked.

I have made this recipe with great success with some minor tweaking: I increase the red wine and decrease the chicken stock, I make sure to rub the brisket with a lot of kosher salt, fresh pepper and paprika before searing and I put in the veggies and dried fruit at the end. (I usually cook it for a few hours, remove it, cut it and then put it back in the pan with the veggies for another few hours.)

I was looking for a brisket recipe with a little more flavour and this fit the bill nicely. I didnt have any dried fruit so I added fresh black figs instead. When the meat was done I set the vegetables and meat aside on platters to cool and blended the onions and figs into the sauce after reducing it by 1/3. This ones a keeper.

This one was voted off the table and replaced with pizza. It was too sweet, had no complex flavors, had no balance, the veggies were mushy and the meat never got to the fall apart tender other reviewers noted.

this has become our standard recipe for Hannukah, which all our friends look forward to.

Ditto all of the reviewers who would not make this recipe again. Too sweet, no complex flavors, tender meat with no acidic or salt balance, mushy yams and fruit. Need I say more?

Way too sweet! The meat was delicious and you didn't need a knife to cut it but for all of the time it took to make this, I sure wouldn't bother again. After a dinner for 4, I removed the rest of the meat and chucked everything else in the garbage!

so, what is a tsimmer?? I followed the wonderful suggestions and directions of the cook from NJ and this was wonderful! not sure i'll make it again (we don't eat a lot of meat!) but i'll remember it for sure!

I tried making this in a crock pot as recommended by one of the cooks who rated the recipe. IT WAS AWFUL. Plus, it really NEEDS SALT. My family ate it because they love brisket and I added salt, and the crock pot was my mistake and not the recipe's, but even when I reheated it uncovered so that some of the liquid would evaporate, the taste was SOUR.

I've made this recipe many times. It is my husband and son's favorite brisket. Over the years I've made a few changes. Add 1 1/2 Tbs chili powder with the other spices. When you first put the meat and fruit in use only half the prunes and apricots, and add a large handful of dried cranberries. Bake for 1 1/2 hours. Refrigerate overnight. The next morning skim off the fat and slice the meat across the grain. Puree the sauce in a blender. Return the meat and sauce back to the pot and add the carrots, yams and remaining 1/2 of the fruit. Bake another hour. This way you get the sweet flavor of the fruit in the sauce, but also have firm fruit and veggies for the tzimmes. When presentation is important I sometimes bake the sliced meat with 1/2 the sauce in a baking dish covered with tin foil and the tzimmes and rest of sauce separately. Keep stirring the tzimmes.

Lost this recipe. My friend Norma gave it to me in 91 and rediscovered it on this website. A million thanks to Norma, Bon Apetit and the website!

Served this dish at Passover seder. Delicious, however, I agree with the other reviewers about shortening the time for the fruits, yams and carrots-by a lot! And the touch of chili powder was inspired.

Rating: 1
This was a big disappointment, and poorly written. The dried fruit shouldn't be cooked for more than an hour. Sweet potatoes take less time than carrots, and neither should be cooked for more than 30-45 minutes. Salt and pepper needs to be added, and sauce should be reduced or thickened. I wouldn't make it again.

Loved the recipe. Easy to make too. I would add the yams later as many other reviewers said.

Rating: 2
My guests loved it, but it was a little bland for me (my Mom always made a more savory brisket). I might try it again, though, with the Cook from Brooklyn's secret ingredient! I added the carrots and yams the last 45 minutes, as well. Next time, I would add just half the prunes and apricots as directed and the rest for the last half hour.

I made this recipe in 2002, and it was such a hit that my family demanded that I make it again (and exactly the same way)for 2003. I put the carrots and yams in at the last hour as recommended. My secret ingredient - one tablespoon of chili powder.

I followed the reviews and put the carrot/sweet potatoes for the last hour and they came out perfect. However, I felt the prunes and apricots dissolved. Next time, I'll put them in later also. Very tasty and will make again. New Email address: mpaul@mvp4me.com

I just made this for a Passover Seder for 12 and what a hit!! I used a 7lb brisket and cooked it for 8 hours on low in a crock pot. I did follow everyone's advice about adding the carrots and yams at the end and it worked out beautifully. Definately would make it again in a smaller portion for every night cooking.

This was fabulous, a tsimmes brisket. I always slice my brisket about 1/2way thru - it makes it so much juicier(my mom taught me that.) anyway, it was really quite delicious and i will make it again. my father said it was the best brisket he's ever eaten and he's eaten quite a lot of brisket in his life!!!!!

I had never made brisket before, and I made this for my Passover Seder. It was wonderful. I also added dried cranberries, and I did not add the sweet potatoes or carrots, preferring to cook those separately. The dried fruits all melded together to make this wonderful sauce. Everyone loved it. I would definitely make this again.

The cooking process is a long one, but it was worth it. It really was fabulous. Definitely add the yams the last hour they were perfect and not mushy. We used the same amt. of ingredients and used a 7lb. brisket and the results were fine. Cooling the entire thing in the fridge helped to skim the fat and also made the meat easier to slice. Prep one day ahead is key.

Well, maybe I just don't get sweet flavors with beef. This was okay, but not worth the work for me. I did another brisket at the same time with my basic recipe and liked it better.

This was wonderful. I thought that I had followed the recipe to the letter but when I came back to reveiw this I realized that I had FORGOTTON to put in yams :0 Anyhow It is dee lis ous and althrough it made alot and I was thinking leftovers the 5 adults and 2 children ate the entire thing :(

I made this brisket for the first passover dinner I ever cooked for my family. They LOVED it. To comment on the yam/carrot debate, I put the yams and carrots in 2 hours before the end. Next time I will put them in 1.5 hours before the end as I thought they were a little soft -- but delicious all the same. I wouldn't worry about it. My grandmother liked the recipe so much she called me the next day to ask for it which is the biggest compliment of all.

I think I've finally found the best Brisket recipe ever! This will surely be the Brisket served at every occasion in our family. I also added the yams and carrots with 1 1/2 hours cooking time to go. Even people who don't especially like yams enjoyed it.

Rating: 4
I followed everyone's advice and added cranberries and only cooked the potatoes and carrots for an hour (plus the reheating). It was delicious. I suggest letting it sit overnight due to the amount of fat that appeared on top. However, once it was skimmed, the dish was wonderful and will be used for this years Chanukah dinner. Very simple, delicious and different! Enjoy!

Very easy and tastey. The brisket was very tender. I agree with the previous opinions about adding the yams later to avoid them turning mushy. I added them the last hour of cooking and they were just right.

We all loved this recipe. I have already made it twice! I read some of the reviews and used some of the tips available... such as add vegetables later especially the yams and use some dried cranberries as well. I highly recommend this recipe.

This was the most sweet and juicy brisket I've ever tasted! I made it 2 days before the seder and reheated it for our Passover dinner. I got lots of compliments on the taste. I would absolutely make it again!

This is the best brisket recipe I've ever made, even better than the recipe with portobello mushrooms and cranberries. How it could come out dry for the reviewer from Israel is a mystery. It has a delicious sauce that I couldn't stop eating. I cooked the yams for 1 1/2 hours and they were perfect - nice and soft but didn't fall apart. Try this, you'll love it.

This was delicious -- a big hit with all family members, large and small. I left the yams and carrots in large chunks and they didn't get mushy at all, even after refrigerating and reheating. I will definately make it again.

Made this for my family. My son who is a very fussy eater couldn't stop eating it and raving about it. It's a definite winner with my family. The only suggestion is to put the sweet potatoes in the dish about 3/4 of an hours before it's finished. That way they don't end up 'mushy'

This came out really bad, the meat was really dry, and the carrots also came out hard. In conclution it was a complete disaster. I wouldn't make this brisket again if my grandmother's life depended on it!

This was the first brisket I ever made, and my first passover cooking for my husband's family. Everyone enjoyed it. My husband loves the leftovers. I will definitely make it next year. I cooked the veggies separate and omitted the bay leaves and allspice. It was still delicious and easy.

This has become a holiday tradition in our house, especially for Passover. I don't eat meat, so I separate the tzimes from the brisket to serve and they are delicious. It has been a success every time.

Every year I dread eating brisket - too dry, too stringy, and tasteless. But this recipe was delicious! I love the dried fruits and added dried cranberries for something tart in addition to the sweet apricots and prunes. I omitted the paprika (which you never miss anyway). Lastly, I put the yams in 1/2 hour later than the recipe calls for and they kept their shape through a second re-heat. Even my 6 year old called for seconds! A new family tradition!

This was incredible. We've never been brisket fans, but my whole family loved this and we will make it each Passover. I found that the yams did need over two hours to cook. I cooked it for 1 1/2 the first night, left it overnight, then added the yams and carrots and finished it up and served it the next day. Wonderful.

My family has been making what they thought was the ultimate brisket for years! After tasting this recipe, they couldn't stop raving. Even people who normally eat chicken,couldn't resist this dish. A wonderful aroma will fill your home,as the combination of the wine, fruit, and meat simmer. I loved it that this recipe could be made one day ahead of time and reheated! Your guests will really think you outdid yourself and spent the day slaving away in the kitchen. Make extra fruit and potatoes to have with leftovers, if there are any.

This dish was excellent! My mother admited that it was better than the brisket she has been making year after year. I added some catsup and worcester sauce to the gravy for some extra zest. One hour is plenty for the sweet potatoes and carrots to cook, otherwise they get too mushy. Latkes made a great side dish.

Rating: 2
I thought the dried fruits produced a good, flavorful sweet-sour gravy for the brisket. However, I found that the cooking times given for the yams was too long, and they softened, and in some cases, dissolved. The dish was still very good, but in the future, I plan to put the yams in about 30 minutes later so that they will retain their shape, perhaps through a couple of reheatings.

I have made this recipe many times and it is a lovely winter winner. Especially good for dinner parties, as it holds well and can be made a day in advance.
