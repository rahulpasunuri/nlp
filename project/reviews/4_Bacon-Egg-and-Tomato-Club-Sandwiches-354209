Absolutely delicious! I just did 2 slices of bread as more of a regular sandwich and used a over-medium egg in place of the hard boiled. The chive mixed with the mayo is wonderful!

Delicious :) I used extra thick slabs of heirloom tomatoes and it was divine!

I've now made this recipe several times, including for a summer outdoor bridal shower. It is amazing. When making it for just my husand and I, I use fried eggs, over medium because he dislikes hardboiled eggs. I've also combined the fresh herbs with torn lettuce and that is great too. Most recently used a small amount of fresh kaffir lime leaf, lemon basil, Italian basil and fresh oregano. The lemon flavors really added a zing

Made this for friends and not a crumb was left. Used tomatoes from farmer's market and turkey bacon. Delicious!

Very tasty. Summer tomatoes and the herbs, which I mixed with a spring mix of lettuces gave the best and unexpected taste with each bite! I ended up only making it one tier, but it was the best egg sandwich ever!

Another terrific variation for this - bacon, egg and cucumber sandwiches. Use thinly sliced cucumber in place of the tomato, or even in addition to the tomato.

Ever think you might have a heart attack in the middle of a sandwich, but it would be so worth it? That's this sandwich. In an effort to watch calories (hahahahahaha!) I skipped the center slice of bread and just made these like BLT's with hardboiled egg slices. Oh. My. Goodness. So delicious. The chive mayo is just right to go with the whole sandwich. I would eat this once a week if I thought my arteries might cooperate. I'm actually sort of fantasizing about eating this again right now. *sigh*
