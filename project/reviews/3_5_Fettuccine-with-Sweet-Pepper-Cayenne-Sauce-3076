Very good and easy! I didn't add the cheese to the sauce, but served Asiago on the side. I had to add flour (whisk in while sifting flour through a strainer) which worked just great. Alsol, I used Fuselli instead of fettuccine. Our dinner guests really enjoyed this and I'll definately make it again. Bon Apetite!

Great recipe -- I used vegetable broth and creme fraiche, so didn't have the worries of the sauce not thickening (creme fraiche is the easy way to make these creamy sauces, I find). I thought that it could use a little more cayenne -- just a touch more to add a little zing. Otherwise, a keeper.

A delicious (mostly) vegetarian dish. To cut calories and fat, I used reduced fat butter, fatfree half-and-half in place of the whipping cream, and 99% fatfree canned chicken broth. Warning: If using fatfree half and half, add it last and cook only until heated through. Fatfree half-and-half will not thicken, but will become stringy. Also, I used shredded rather than grated parmesan cheese and noticed that it clumped, but the flavor was still very good.

Great recipe. I agree with the others who said more time will be needed to allow the sauce to thicken. I also add a small shallot with the garlic. Sauce works as a great base and chicken, scallops, shrimp, etc. work great with it.

This was delicious, and I added a pound of sea-scallops to the sauce, which was as good for the scallops as it was for the pasta. Fabulous!

This dish is great and simple to make. The combination of flavors is excellent. I followed the recipie as is, the only exception is letting the sauce thicken for a couple extra minutes. Don't worry if it still looks thin, after adding the cheese and taking it off of the heat, it thickens perfectly. Would work with chicken or shrimp as well, but really doesn't need it. Great and easy!

The blend of flavors in this recipe is divine (peppers, cayenne, garlic and peas). I needed a little extra time to get the sauce thickened. This dish can be enhanced with shrimp but is awesome as is.

Hungry late one night and had some of the ingredients on hand, minus the peas and red peppers. Still was very good and I'm sure all that much better with the missing veggies. This is similar to a recipe I've had for years but this has a nice subtle kick with the addition of cayenne pepper.

I've made this several times with a few variations. One simple change, instead of just bell peppers, I used cauliflower, snap peas, broccoli, and bell peppers - and then I made less pasta. It's really delicious this way. I also added a bit of blue cheese to the sauce.

Yum!! Perfect taste, spice, everything. I wouldn't change a thing!

I LOVED this recipe. But I did make a few changes (I can't leave recipes alone!). I used one yellow and one red pepper and since I really love spicy food, I doubled the cayenne pepper. I also added chicken and shrimp to the mixture. And I served it with dense rolls to soak up extra sauce. It would also be good with lobster in the sauce....YUMMY. It was a big hit with our family!!

I made this dish for my husband for our 4th anniversary dinner. I served it as the main course. It was absolutely fantastic. I would not change a thing about it.

This was tasty. I added a shallot and sliced grilled chicken. I also used skim milk with 1 teaspoon cornstarch instead of cream. It was a little hot at first (I might use less cayenne next time), but once your taste buds get used to it, it's very good. I will definitely use less butter next time.

Easy and yummy. I roasted the peppers and added them with the cheese; also substituted half and half for cream. Nice combo of sweet and spicy!

This has become one of our favorite dishes to make for dinner. Omit the peas (simply because I don't like them.) We have this pasta all the time. Very easy and wonderful flavors.

Excellent! Hearty, fiery and delicious. If you ordered this dish in a restaurant, you'd feel that you had gotten a great meal. Very simple to prepare, too. The only change I made was to use one red pepper and one yellow pepper, purely to make the dish more colorful. I served it with a baguette (which cut the heat for our kids) and a fresh fruit salad. This will definitely become a regular at our house.

My husband and I really liked this recipe. Very easy to make. We julienned the peppers and cooked just until crisp, we also eliminated the peas and used fresh parsley instead of basil. We also added another 1/4tsp of cayenne to really spice it up! Yum :-)

This is a great side dish! My husband and I love cayenne and the amount included is perfect! We used 1/2 cup of milk and a 1/2 cup of half and half instead of the cream. It is a quick and easy recipe - and the leftovers are great.

There is way too much cayenne in this recipe, (and I like spicy food)- it simply hides the wonderful flavors of the red peppers. I would only put in one third of a teaspoon of cayenne pepper and i might add some finely diced ham to liven it up next time.

This dish was fairly spicy, but excellent and my husband who is very picky, felt that it compared to a good restaurant dish (that's a compliment).

Very easy, very flavorful. And it was just as good leftover for lunch the next day. Try it!

Very easy and quick!!! A great one dish meal. I added some shrimp to it also.
