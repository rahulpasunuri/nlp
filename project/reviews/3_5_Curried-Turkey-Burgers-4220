I wish I could have given this a zero fork rating. I thought this was one of the MOST vile things I have ever made or tasted! It sounded pretty bad, but I tried it since others had good things to say about it. The texture was mushy, and it besides the fact that the sauce was horribly horribly sweet, the burgers had no flavor other than the chutney and the curry. Sorry, steer very clear of this recipe.

This recipe is quite good. I made the sauce and meat with Miracle-Whip Lite & Lite Sour Cream in place of the yogurt. The Miracle Whip certainly provided its "tangy" zip -- which is counterintuitive to the sauce (I'm on a diet, so I can't drop 1200 calories of mayo into a meal...); however, with real mayo I think this recipe is likely very good. The seasoning of the meat is a little light for 2lbs of ground turkey. I used the recipes seasoning with 1-1/4lbs of ground turkey and thought the meat was flavorful. One of my burgers fell apart in a George Foreman grill, and I pan friend the remaining 3 full size burgers.

These burgers are a great light summer treat. I sometimes substitute homemade chunky applesauce for the apples and always even my 10 year old loves them. They are a bit gooey before they cook, but they grill up more firm and are delicious with mixed greens and pitas! Highly recommended.

GREAT! The yogurt sauce really adds a lot. I only had about half the mint on hand and it was still good. Also, I halved the chutney and curry in the burgers hoping my one year old would try it. He LOVED it. Soon to be a staple in our house, I'm sure.

I agree with the other reviewers -- these burgers are tasty, but fall apart easily on the grill. As much as I love grilled food, I'd recommend that you use a grill pan (or cook on the stove).

This has become a real summer staple at our house. The burgers are nice, but I think the sauce is what bumps it up to 4 forks. I like to serve them in whole wheat pitas with grilled mangos as a side. However, the burgers can be tricky. Some things that have helped us: use greek yogurt (thicker) and light on the applesauce; use a hamburger press; place on wax paper in the fridge or freezer for a while before cooking; then use the wax paper to flip the burger onto the grill (tear around the individual burgers).

Pretty good burgers, and healthful too. I'd make them again, although I'm more smitten with the South East Asian T-burgers also found on this site.

Obviously everyone has different tastes, but the sauce on these burgers was way too sweet for me. The burgers themselves were OK, but the sauce was just not good.

Really good and healthy too. It's in the repeat file. (Might skip the mustard seed... what's the point?)

Very good, and low fat too!

I hate to be the lone voice of dissent, but my husband and I did not find these burgers to be that impressive. Sure they're tasty, but just not as stupendously good as every other reviewer has stated. I really wanted to blown away by these based on all the glowing reviews, but I'm afraid they were a bit of a letdown.

If you have come across this recipe, you must try it out! It is delicious and a pleasure to make with all of the wonderful fragrances. I must have put the mixture in front of my husband's nose four times instructing him to "smell this!" There is not one thing I would change about the recipe, just make it as it says. The burgers are a bit wet, so don't handle them very much. You could stick them in the fridge to help set them up a little before grilling. We had no leftovers and this recipe will become part of the permanent collection in our household. This is sure to impress all of your friends and family!

I almost gave this three forks, but this dish really is beyond compare, so gave it four. Never had burgers this tasty and unique. If you like curry and are trying to find something new to do with ground turkey like I was, then you must try this dish! I followed the recipe exactly. I was a little nervous from other reviewers comments about the burgers being a little wet...but I went for it anyway. And, I also did these on the grill. I was very liberal with the PAM and did not mess with the burgers (only turned once after 5 minutes) and then grilled the other side another 5 minutes. They came out fine. No sticking. The sauce compliments the burgers wonderfully. What a great combination of flavors. The burgers were even better the next day! Enjoy!

Absolutely wonderful. Both the burgers AND the sauce had such an incredible combination of flavors! Served with homemade pitas and a big, fat Greek salad. :) My husband is already looking forward to the leftover burger/sauce for lunch tomorrow. I did pan fry, rather than grill. Otherwise, stayed true to the recipe.

These were great! I skipped the chutney, just didn't have any -- but they were terrific anyhow. Definately a taste-bud treat!

I just finished my third burger in as many days for lunch today, and all I can say is...I can't wait to make these again! I made this as written except that I used a scant measure of the apple sauce and I broiled them. Perfect; I wouldn't change a thing. Very loose mixture, but the texture is great once cooked.

Used curry paste instead of powder and reduced the chutney just slightly. Really liked the flavor and texture. Usually turkey burgers are really crumbly, but these were really delish! We served the burgers with rice pilaf, warm pitas and stirfried pea pods. Nice light meal. The sauce was awesome too!

INCREDIBLE!!! I was looking for something a little out of the ordinary and stumbled upon this recipe. The flavors blend together fantastic! It may be a little labor intensive but ABSOLUTELY worth every second spent.

I loved this recipe. I had an easy time on the grill, you need to be generous withe the PAM, on the grill and burger and don't fuss or try to turn them. I didn't serve in pita, just open faced on a nice bed of lettuce with a dollop of the sauce. The next day I forwarded all of my culinary friends this recipe. It's a keeper.

Fabulous. I used ground chicken instead of turkey and didn't have any applesauce, but they were terrific anyway. Even my boyfriend loved them (he ate THREE) -- and he doesn't usually like curry!

Great dish, very simple once you throw it all together. I broiled the burgers which gave an excellent result, about 5-7 minutes per side. Since they are very moist I can understand why they would likely fall apart on a BBQ. Serve with cous cous and it is a very easy, quick dinner.

This was very easy to make, though it did require a lot of ingredients that i didn't have. My burgers were very soft and so I was glad I had to pan fry them; i would have thought they'd fall through a grill. Maybe I put in a little too much chutney (I LOVE mango chutney, it's my favorite condiment), but my burgers oozed and left a sticky coating on the pan. Completely tasty, highly recommended dish! I ate the leftover burger for lunch and my coworkers were amazed at my culinary skills!

This was an amazing recipe. I didn't alter the amounts of 'liquids' in the burger, but did add double the curry powder and a dash more cayenne in both the burger and yogurt mixtures. This sauce is amazing- definitely make double and re-use the next day!

The whole faimly LOVED this recipe. (We are big on curry and mango chutney) I will cut down on the apple sauce next time. Pan frying was a helpful hint I took from others. The sauce was also delicious. We had quite a bit left over, which we will happily use on some chicken. I love the fact that you can get a great tasting burger that is moist and low fat! Doesn't get any better.

These burgers were delicious. I reduced the wet ingredients just slightly and they stayed together perfectly in the pan. I used apple curry chutney instead of mango--yum! The next day I mixed the leftover sauce with broiled chicken for a nice lowfat chicken salad.

Delicious! Spicy and sweet. These grilled very nicely, though we did add some oatmeal as a stabilizer (not necessarily the best choice, but we were out of bread crumbs). Excellent, too, the next day, torn up and mixed with the remaining sauce and some leftover wild rice as a salad.

Excellent!! My husband and I loved the mix of spices and fruits. The sauce was also a very nice with the slightly dry burger patty.

This was a yummy, different and healthy burger, especially if you like mango chutney (which I do)! I followed the recipe exactly and didn't think they were too wet as long as you pan-fried them. I agree that they would be tough to grill without the risk of them falling apart. If I tried them on the grill I might put them on tin foil or a grill basket or something. Both burgers and sauce were very good. I used spicy chutney and with that and the cayenne these were pretty spicy burgers. I will definitely make this again. It would be a nice change of pace during the summer BBQ season.

Best burger I've ever had! Didn't have mustard seeds so substituted with 1.5 tsp ground mustard, but wish I had the seeds. Used whole milk yogurt and skipped the applesauce because other reviewers said the mixture was too moist. Also used a mango instead of the chutney as I didn't have that either. Pan fried, super yummy! Great flavor combos.

Loved this recipe- my boyfriend asks for it over and over. I omitted the applesauce which makes the burgers much easier to handle and they are still delicious. The mustard seeds are the best!

Yum! Yes, the burgers were wet, but I grilled them on a stovetop burner in my nonstick Calphalon grill pan, so no problems there! :-) The second time I made them, I baked 40 meatballs in a jelly roll pan for 20 mins at 400F. They were swimming in liquid. Next time, I will add bread crumbs!

Rating: 3
Excellent taste and textures!! I added some bread crumbs, as the other viewers mentioned problems with the meat mixture being too wet and cooked the burgers in a frying pan. Next time I will make meatballs, as I served the burgers with rice. We usually only eat one burger, but last night I had two and my husband had three! The mustard seeds are a must!

These turkey burgers were great, especially with the yogurt/chutney sauce. I've had experience with wet turkey burgers falling apart on the grill before so I cooked them in a frying pan and they worked perfectly.

I've made this numerous times and everyone loves it! They are quite moist, so I cut down a little on all the wet ingredients. I serve them on a plate with rice and drizzele the sauce over them.

Delicious burgers! Had MAJOR trouble with sticking on grill though so finally broiled. Turned out better. Mustard seeds give unusual and very pleasant texture.

Awesome blend of spices... Don't be dissuaded by the mango... very good and good for you, unbeatable.
