I had ground veal, hamburger, and pork left over so that was my meats. I seared the meatballs, I like that crisp exterior. The recipe was good and I will make it again.

This is very similar to my grandmother's Italian chicken soup. It's wonderful! I have never found it necessary to brown the meatballs. I simply bring the stock to a boil and put the meatballs in then bring it down to a simmer until they are no longer pink. This is a delicious, comfort food.
