Very yummy. I doubled the recipe but only had a cup of rice wine vinegar so I used dry sherry for the second cup. Did use the water. Tasted delicious.Like others, I did not use oil in the marinade. Thought it to be unnecessary. It took a long time to cook down the sauce and I didn't reduce it enough. However, the thin coating that it did have on the wings gave it a great sweet, spicy flavor. Next time I will have more patience with the sauce. Another note- you can probably adjust the heat of the wings by adding more or less red pepper flakes.

These were absolutely amazing. I would say that these are restaurant quality. My husband usually says "fine" to food I make that he considers good. But...these wings got a "Good"! That's like acknowledgment from Chef Ramsey!! I loved these wings. One note that it did take 40 minutes to cook down the glaze in my cast iron pan.

Easy, spicy and delicious. Baked wings 20min on 400 degrees then reduced to 350 for additional 20 minutes. They were not over cooked. The needed the additional cooking time. The sauce was the right consistency at about 40 min. It thickened as it cooled a little. The we're fabulous....we devoured them. 'can't wait to make them again!

This has potential but the actual instructions need modification. First, you cannot possibly bake chicken wings in 20 minutes unless you pre-cook them in some manner before baking. I would suggest either deep frying the wings and forget about baking or bake them first and then crisp them in some oil. Second, like other reviewers, it took forever for the sauce to thicken. We played with the process but kept the ingredients the same. We did, in fact, love the heat-and-sweet of the sauce.

my husband and I loved these! I didn't read the reviews before hand so just made recipe as written and we devoured them. We skipped the rice and just sat outside with the wings and a pile of napkins. Will definitely make again.

I don't actually know if these wings were good because they were gone before my husband or I could get any. Made 5 pounds of wings for a party of 10 for a tiki bbq/pool party that also included 12.5 pounds of char siu ribs, coconut rice, spicy peanut noodle salad, baby bok choy with ginger scallion dressing, and Trader Vic's Mai Tais. Marinated the wings for about 8 hours, par cooked them in the oven, tossed with the glaze and finished on the grill. Marinade and glaze both tasted great. Would have liked to try them on the wings. Will make 10 pounds next time.

It's Super Bowl Sunday and I made these wings for my husband, who loves hot wings but was a little skeptical when I showed him this recipe. He devoured them. Here's how I changed the recipe (props to all the reviewers): I eliminated the oil -- wings have enough fat and I think oil tends to dull these bold flavors. I minced green onion with the garlic in a mini-chopper; eliminated cilantro; grated about 2 tsps. of fresh galangal along with the fresh ginger; substituted mushroom soy for regular soy; and increased the amount of soy sauce to a quarter cup. Marinated the wings in a zip-lock bag all day. For the hot sauce, I agree with the other reviewers- forget the water. I added garlic powder (about a tsp), increased the chili sauce by a tablespoon, decreased the sugar to a half cup and substituted organic brown sugar for white sugar. Next time I will add 2 kaffir lime leaves to the sauce (remove before serving). Simmered the sauce for a good 40 mins and it thickened nicely. After roasting, broiled wings a minute each side to complete caramelization. To serve, mounded jasmine rice in the center of a platter, surrounded it with the sticky wings and surrounded the wings with broccoli that was roasted at the same time as the wings. Sprinkled scallions over all. All in all a very successful dish.

This is a nearly-perfect chicken wing recipe. We did some improvising with the sauce and tweaked ingredients to our taste, which is why I won't give it a 4-star-rating, but they were straightforward, simple and delicious, particularly with ample cilantro. We served on their own (sans rice) with a variety of other appetizers.

I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, not wings, and followed the recipe exactly. I really liked the marinade, but the sauce lacked something, I think. Next time, I would add more chili garlic paste and less sugar.

They were good, but nothing special. the sauce took over 40 minutes to thicken. I will look for a different wing recipe.

This recipe is awesome. It was a true hit at our New Year's Day (Shogatsu). I used 5 lbs of wings and tripled the glaze so I would have some left over. I didn't pay attention to how long it simmered, but cooked it until it was quite thick. I thought I would have to thin it, but the consistency was perfect when reheated in the microwave. I am definately going to freeze these to have on hand.

I won the chicken wing cook-off contest at church with this recipe. Followed the recipe as written (without the rice). It's knock-your-socks-off hot--and I was very glad the judges were all young men who enjoyed the heat!

Made this for the Superbowl and was fairly disappointed. Nobody at the party seemed too impressed. If I were to make this again, I would cut back on the sugar as the wings were waaaaay too sweet and increase the chili- garlic sauce. Also, the sauce took 40 minutes to reduce instead of the stated 20. I think I would have preferred the traditional hot wings over this recipe.

Rating: 4
I made these once again for the game this weekend and they were a huge hit. Maybe my cooktop runs hotter than others, but my glaze reduced in the 20 min as directed in the recipe. In fact it got so thick I had to add more water. Great idea to freeze with the marinade. I also baked them on a drying rack in a rimmed sheet pan so they aren't swimming in their own fat.

Made all as directed. Drummettes on a foil lined sheet in convect bake for about 25 min. Used the water amt as written - boiled roughly 40 min and still didn't thicken up enough - might pull it back a bit but don;'t want the flavour altered - it was fantastic. Might consider brushing with glaze in the final minutes of cooking, then tossing with the rest of reserve glaze. Reviewer correct in saying that they are great room temp and perfect for company/buffet/grazi ng food.

Rating: 4
Great alternative to typical 'hot' wing recipes. The only changes I made (beside doubling the recipe for 4 lbs of wings) was using green onion instead of cilantro and cooking the wings on a rack on the baking sheet. I did use the broiler for 5 minutes at the end. My glaze didnt thicken up in the 20 minutes. Im sure it would have if I simmered it a little longer and more importantly, let it cool. Even the glaze a little thin, it coats the wings and tastes great.

Made this for my son's football team banquet and they were GONE in a flash. Amazingly delicious. Like others, I had to cook the wings longer than the recipe said.--they are much better cooked a bit more. Absolute best wings ever, great room temp so they are excellent to bring to a party, potluck, picnic. Make these once and you will be begged to do it again.

Rating: 0
The glaze mixture is incredible! However for you non-cooks (like me) you need to really cook those chicken wings - not 20 minutes, but probably more like a half hour. I cooked them for 25 minutes and they weren't really done and the finished product was less appetizing than it could have been (Yes, my oven was the right remp. - I use a thermometer to make sure). Also, when it says cut them at the joint it means cut off the "elbow" - type part leaving the drumstick. Again, I'm no cook and so I was cutting them at the wrong joint!

These were really great. I made them for the game last night and my husband loved them. I personally would have liked them a little more crispy, but, he loved them as is. The recipe worked perfectly all around. Glaze only took 20 min and did get very thick when it cooled. We'll be making them again for the game next week.

I tried this last night for my family and they loved it. It wasn't very difficult to make. The glaze took alot longer to make than the 20 minutes suggested, but maybe the heat I had it on was too low? It was worth the extra time so I didn't mind.

Mmmm. It's Superbowl Sunday and the wings are the hit of my party. I made the sauce earlier (yes, it did take a full 40 minutes to cook down....and I put a splash of water in the pan to reheat it, as per the other reviewers). I marinated the wings for 6 hours without cilantro (not our taste), then grilled them, and glazed them. They are absolutely superb! And thank you to the other reviewers for their tips -- I really appreciate them.

Definately restaurant quality. I read a lot of the prior reviews, and decided to include the water and increase the simmering time to 40 minutes. I didn't have a strong vinegar smell in the house (believe me... my kids would have told me if there was). The sauce still looked watery after the 40 minutes, but I found that once I put it on the chicken and it had a chance to cool a little it thickened up. I used green onion in the marinade instead of cilantro. This is definately a keeper.

Really good flavor on this recipe. Sweet, yet with just the right amount of kick. Even though I was only able to marinate for 1 hour, still came out fine. Sauce only took 20 minutes to thicken for me, and got REALLY thick when it cooled before chicken was ready. Had to rewarm to loosen it up. Will definitely be making these again!

My first attempt at making wings...they were incredible. I went by the recipe, and they turned out perfectly; however, I'd agree that you need about 40 mins to allow sauce to reduce enough for the glaze. The leftovers (very few!) were also excellent cold and right out of the fridge the next day!

Rating: 0
I use experiment with the tried and tested recipes on epicurious extensively. This was a absolutely fab! Made them for superbowl party...and not one wing left. Tips: Make sauce ahead if possible, it has a strong smell. (dont worry does wear off). I decided to serve the wings without the rice, with the sauce drizzled just on top. I extra sauce for later use.

Rating: 3
I took the advice of other reviewers for several things: Let them marinate longer than two hours (was 4-5) and left the water out of the sauce, cooking time was decreased a lot. Beware though, cooks SO fast this way you may need to reheat by adding water. I used 1/2 wings and 1/2 boneless skinless tenders for the Super Bowl (Yeah, Steelers!) All the tenders were gone, only about 1/2 of regular. Very tasty! Will make again as a dinner with rice as recipe suggests.

Word to the wise.....if this is your first attempt at making wings, do NOT buy them whole. Either ask your butcher to separate the drumette from the wing tip or just buy them in bulk and frozen from your local costco, BJs, whatever. Regardless of the 2 hrs I spent hacking away at these little wingies, the recipe is delicious. Spicy, savory, sweet, yet light enough to eat about 2 dozen. Enjoy everyone!

Rating: 4
I have made these several times over the years and they are always a big hit. Delicious!! I marinate them the night before and bake them in the oven the next day and they are great. Word of advice - make sure to bake them in a single layer or else it takes much longer. Making the sauce ahead of time to get the vinegar smell out of your kitchen is great advice from the review from Granite Bay - it is a powerful scent!

Rating: 4
YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS ONE!!! I have been making these little gems for a good two years now and I have always had nothing but positive feedback. I have always marinated these for a good 24 hours and I use a mix between wings and drummettes and we always slow cook these on the grill, I like the way they turn out on the grill (more color) vs- baking. Make sure you make the sweet sauce ahead of time to get the "vinegar" smell out of your kitchen. Absolutely divine recipe! Thanks epicurious!!!!!

This recipe was great on the grill with soaked hickory chips! And I didn't even make the sweet and sour glaze simply because my husband doesn't usually like sweet and sour flavors. I made the marinade in the morning, let the wings marinate all day while I was at work, then grilled them when I got home. I didn't have peanut oil so I used canola oil and I didn't have cilantro so I used chopped chives instead. They came out great and my husband loved them. Next time I'll add a tablespoon or so of sesame oil and I think I'll try the sweet and sour sauce too because I love sweet and sour even if my husband doesn't!

Rating: 3
Very good, but spicy. I marinated the wings for about 4 hours, baked them, and then broiled them to make them crisp. As for the sauce, I doubled the amounts and cooked it down for about 45 minutes to get it sticky. I had plenty of sauce leftover for at least 2 more dinners, but since we love it we can't wait to experiment with it. (I bet it's very good as a glaze for pork)

Prepared this last night for some out of town (Paris no less - a little intimidating) guests. I tripled the sauce and used skinned thighs instead of the wings. Since there have been so many great suggestions about this recipe, especially regarding the cooking times involved, I remained undaunted as my pot of sauce bubbled away for quite awhile before it finally got to be nice and syrupy. Next time I'll skip the water called for. Anyway, it was well worth the wait. I served the sauced chicken over basmati rice (which became scrumptiously sticky) with a big loaded green salad and crusty ciabatta on the side and a triple berry cobbler for dessert. Everyone helped themselves to seconds and thirds and absolutely raved about dinner. I will definitely serve this again to both family and guests.

Rating: 4
I make these by the buckets full!! I've made as many as 35 lbs at a time with no leftovers! Family and friends always request these at every gathering. However, I think it is important to make sure the wings are dry and totally thawed so the marinade sticks. Also I feel the cook time is inaccurate, I like the wings to look dark and crisy. And, don't rush the sauce, it take time to get thick. These are a great hit!

The family loved this. I used chicken breast tenders instead of wings. Give yourself extra time for the sauce as it takes longer than 20 min. to reduce. Next time I'll make extra sauce for the rice, by request. A keeper!

I made this just last night, even though when I remembered it needed to marinate I almost didn't do it. I ate later than usual, but it was worth it. I did an hour+ instead of two to speed things up a bit, and even then the wings were very flavorful. I broiled them for just a few minutes to get them a little crisp. I had some trouble at first getting the sauce to thicken as others mentioned. I think I was too conservative with the fire at first. Once I turned it up a bit it cooked down nicely. A nice alternative to just baking or frying wings.

For my last football bash, I wanted to serve a couple different types of wings. I chose these and the Parmesan Mustard Chicken Wings. Half my guests loved these best, while the other half raved about the crunchy parm/mustard wings; I think both are winners.

These were great. I used drummettes and marinated them for a full day. I also broiled them toward the end, as suggested by other cooks.

These were so fabulous- I followed some advice posted by earlier reviewers and popped them under the broiler at the end to make them look more appetizing and I started the glaze before putting the chicken in the oven because everyone said that took longer than twenty minutes. I made them last night for my boyfriend and we ate them while watching a basketball game. I made skinless, boneless thighs so we didn't get too messy and they were great. I cook a lot and my boyfriend likes most things, but he told me not to lose this recipe. I think he'd be happy to eat them everyday...

I'm making these wings again tonight. My husband loves them! I suggest marinating them all day long. I added chili garlic sauce, more soy, rice vinegar and green onions to the marinade. Definitely need to cook the sauce longer and broil the wings for at least 10 minutes to get them brown. Don't pour all the sauce over the wings or it will be too much of a good thing!

We thought these were pretty good, but the sauce, which was quite a bit like the tamarind sauce you get with Thai bbq, makes them very, very sticky. I found the times to be off; had to cook the sauce 10 min longer to get the desired consistency; had to bake the wings 10 min longer to get them looking like something I'd want to eat. Way too much sauce even when reduced more than suggested, even for 2.5# wings.

Wonderful! Your friends will accuse you of using a good Chinese restaurant/bought sauce, as this one is so authentic and good. We don't care for wings, so we used whole boneless chicken breasts. I substituted the cilantro-based marinade for one on this site (a sesame oil/garlic/rice vinegar/soy marinade) as I was also making the chicken/shrimp/beef sate's for the party. So, tossed the cooked breasts in the sweet chile glaze, mmmm, and served over rice in a hot pan for added sizzle. It was fantastic in sound, taste and presentation!

I stocked up on chicken wings that were on special at the market. I am truly one who appreciates good wings. This recipe was delicious! Enjoyed the addition of cilantro. I made a batch each of these wings and the Sesame Chicken Drumettes that can also be found on this site. I honestly can't say which one we enjoyed more. They were both great. I always marinate in a plastic zip-log bag which totally immerses the meat in the marinade. Squeeze out as much air as possible and flip every so often. The sauce was so good that I couldn't help licking my fingers. I do confess that I had to make the sauce twice since the first attempt cooked to the hard candy stage! Too many BTU's! Will try next time with boneless thighs.

We've been making this recipe for over 3 years now. It became a part of our New Year's tradition, and it's now branched out to other special meals, as well. It's SOOOOO good!
