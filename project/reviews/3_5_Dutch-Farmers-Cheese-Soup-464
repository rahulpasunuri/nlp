I really loved this soup. I cut the butter to 2T, but even so, the butter flavor really permeated the veggies. I also used grated cheese instead of the slices, which allowed me to mix cheeses (half aged Gouda, half sharp Cheddar) and use less while still getting the full flavor. It was simple but delicious, easy to make, and it got even better the next day.

Oh and I second the addition of white wine. I used a healthy pour of Chardonnay because it was open. And you will need more than 4 cups of broth. I used 6 cups, but it all depends on your preference for broth to solids ratio.

Really great soup. Can't stress enough that well-aged, sharp Gouda really makes a huge difference. Don't skip the cheese and bread on top. A few tips ... the last time I made this I used half the butter and rendered a few slices of bacon while melting the butter. Really added a nice smokey flavor, though some might not appreciate that. Used sharp Gouda and crusty rye bread. When in a hurry, I use frozen cauliflower, cut-up carrots and frozen uncooked hash brown potatoes (the kind that come in the bag all cut into little chunks --the peppers and onions in there don't hurt the flavor any.)

surprisingly flavorful... I substituted broccoli for cauliflower 'cause I had it.

Liked this very much. I found I needed about 6 or 7 cups of stock rather than 4. I pureed about 1/3 and liked the consistency very much. Really nice flavours. Added a small glug of Gewurtztraminer because that's what we were having with it, and a pinch of nutmeg at the end. I think next time I'll probably just grate some Old Gouda right into my bowl and skip the broiled bread and cheese. Am looking forward to the leftovers!

A nice simple, hearty soup. Not too complex, but it's good in its own way. If you let it simmer for longer than 30 minutes, the cauliflower will sort of disintegrate and thicken the soup up, though it's not as attractive that way.

With this Dutch Cheese Soup, if you're really a konisure of fine cheeses it's best to use a well aged Gouda. Rekomend an age of at least 6-8 months on Gouda Cheese, inkreases the taste of this by drastik proportions due to the Aged Gouda's strong taste. :) enjoy

I thought that this was the worst soup I've ever had. It was just inedible.

Simple recipe belies how wonderful and filling is this soup. I develop "bottomless stomach" syndrome when this is served. And it's even better if one is feeling under the weather!

This is a favorite of ours. Quick, easy, and delicious! This is comfort food for me. I also make it with chicken broth.

I made this soup, but I did not include the cheese because I didn't have it on hand. It still tasted pretty good. I blended it partially so that it was smooth with bits of vegetables left intact. Nice on a cold evening.

We love this soup. We use chicken stock instead. This is a fast, easy delicous meal served with a green salad.

This soup is easy to make and delicious. For a thicker consistency, I puree some of the cooked vegetables and broth and add it back to the pot.

Absolutely wonderful. The key is placing the bread and cheese on soup and broiling it. Defenitely will make again!!!
