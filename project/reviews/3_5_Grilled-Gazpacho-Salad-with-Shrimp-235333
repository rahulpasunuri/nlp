The green onions are very stringy and off-putting and got stuck in our throats, making us gag. I usually only review dishes I've thoroughly enjoyed but feel the need to warn you away from this one. The fresh ingredients and beauty of the dish are not attractive enough to overcome its weaknesses. If you ignore my advice, eliminate the green onions - one of my favorite pungent roots ever but not well on the grill!

The whole family enjoyed this dinner off the grill. I added spicy Italian turkey sausage (for our non-shrimp-lovers) and used basalmic vinegar (because was out of red wine vinegar). Like others, I have a few time-saving tips for future cooks: (1) olive oil spray saves lots of effort and dirty dishes instead of tossing with olive oil, and (2) a little minced garlic in the dressing is easier than roasting the garlic (mine burned).

I'm not a fan of the charred limpness that all-too-often passes for grilled veggies, and the way this recipe is written makes it seem much more complicated and labor intensive than it needs to be. Fortunately, my love of gazpacho and the fact I had most of the ingredients on hand made me try this anyway! The simplicity of olive oil, sea salt & fresh pepper, and grilling brings out the bright, summer earthiness in good ingredients. I made several shortcuts/substitutions as Im trying to clean out my freezer and pantry before I move: Used already-toasted bread cubes left over from fondue night; already-peeled shrimp from Trader Joe's that I marinaded straight from the freezer; fresh corn-on-the-cob instead of yellow bell pepper; chopped avocado (added at the end) instead of grilled cucumber. To simplify things, I threw everything on a copper non-stick grilling tray and set it atop the grill, then poured myself a glass of wine and snipped basil from the garden while dinner made itself. Summertime, and the living is easy...

This was GREAT! And very easy. I did however make make a few modifications. instead of using the hot pepper sauce I tossed the shrimp (peeled) with a bit of chili powder, olive oil and salt and pepper before grilling. Definitely a good decision! we also did not add the bread to the salad as the recipe suggests. Instead we sliced one small loaf of Ciobatta in half (like a bun)and lightly brushed both halves with mixture of olive oil, 2 cloves of the roasted garlic and salt and pepper to each piece and put right onto the grill until toasted and served on the side. We also served this with a few ears of grilled corn. grilled out of husk with a bit of olive oil and salt and pepper. I would definitely make this again and again!

Beautiful dish. You could present this at a casual summer barbecue or equally well at a formal dinner. The basil is a must, so don't leave that one out. Next time I will leave out the roasted garlic. I LOVE roasted garlic, but in this dish it's strong sweet flavor out competes some of the milder sweet veggies. It was overpowering.

English Cucumbers are very Nice in this recipe & Using a little of each of the hot sauces in your kitchen is a delight. Sea Salt & fresh ground pepper are a must, I used a sprinkle of smoked black pepper from Rafal Spice in Detroit & was very pleased

The components of this salad were good, but it was kind of boring. If I were to make it again I'd jazz it up with a more flavourful dressing, or maybe even some blue or goat cheese. Also, the directions were a little confusing - I basically grilled in two batches, first with the long-griller veggies, and secondly with the quick-grillers. Finally, it tasted a little funny cold, like it should have been warm but I accidentally served it cool. Maybe serve it quite cold so that it's clear it was done with intention.

I found this recipe to be great for a casual gathering since most of the work is done in advance. It's also a great starting point for adding/replacing fresh vegetables. Try it with asparagus, squash or eggplant too, though the quality of tomatos is critical to best results. I've even added chilled ziti with red pepper flakes (instead of hot sauce) and balsamic instead of red wine vinegar.

Though I've used epicurious for years, this is the first time I've actually reviewed a recipe. I felt it necessary to dampen the expectations created by the wildly enthusiastic reviews. I made it without changes thought iit was just OK, not fabulous or fantastic and certainly not worth the effort. There is nothing wrong with it. It's just not great.

great to make for having people over for so much can be done ahead of time - but note there's a lot of prep involved but clearly worth it.

Excellent! Made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it. They couldn't stop eating it! It's definitely not great cold the next day. Eat it up.

I used at least half as much olive oil. I brushed all veges before the grill. Used large prawns deveined w/out shell, only because on sale at fish store, thought they might be harder to grill but it picked up the flavors and it was Delicious. This is definetly a hands on meal and prep.

I've made it twice now and LOVED IT both times. Got rave reviews from lunch guests. I agree with the other review, it's even great as a left-over. The second time I made it, I didn't have any cucumber, so I used zucchini and it's yellow cousin, and it was just as good. This dish is a summer MUST.

I have made this recipe three times now, every time I have served it all the guests have asked for the recipe. I was amazed at what happened when cucumbers were grilled.

This salad is heavenly, even leftover. It's very labor intensive and would easily serve 8 as a side salad. The labor is well worth it for special occasions and the fresh basil at the end is a must.
