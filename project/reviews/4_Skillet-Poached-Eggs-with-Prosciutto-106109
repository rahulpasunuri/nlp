This was good... it's hard to make more than four fit into one skillet... there were five of us and I had to do my own after the fact, but it goes quickly. Using one yolk per ramekin is really the only way to have a soft yolk. Prep make this go quickly.

This recipe is easy as well as delicious. I made Blender Hollandaise found in the Epicurious website for added elegance and it was amazing. Watercress was a fine substitute for the Arugula and it didn't matter that I cooked the eggs too long. I will make this again and again!

I made this for New Year's Day brunch. Very easy, quick and delicious. I used English Muffins instead of the bread, and it worked very well.

I just made these eggs for christmas brunch since my husband has to work later in the day. They were easy and best of all sooo delicious! I used chives instead of green onions and parma prosciutto---my husband was very happy with his meal!

Made this on a whim and it was excellent! The instructions for poaching eggs are very good. We used the leftover onion oil as dipping for bread at dinner. All the way around yum!

great recipe involving some of my favorite ingredients. unfortunately the yolks cooked before the egg whites settled, both times i tried. next time i might try just one per cup?

I thought I had green onions and when I started making this I realized I was out, so I used some of a dipping oil I had on hand plus some fresh basil, it worked great! 6 minutes was too long for my ramekins so the yolks were overcooked but it was still delicious and super easy, I will definitely make this again and it would be great to serve to guests

WOW! Despite all the great reviews, I really expected dry, bland, and too-healthy without the hollandaise... I was so wrong!! This was really good and flavorful. I did use spinach and lox, instead of arugula and prosciutto, because I had them on hand. We LOVED it.

Made as written- AMAZING! I have nothing else to say, this recipe is great for bed in breakfast.

My husband calls this my bed and breakfast recipe. I make this with broiled grapefruit for our special overnight guests. Wow - it is outstanding. Used spinach as the greens on the sourdough bread. To get the poached egg cups out I used large spatulas - be sure to run a knife around the edge of your poached eggs before flipping.

My roommate continues to rave about this recipe! I added two small cloves of crushed garlic to the olive oil mixture. Used teacups like someone had suggested, and used one whole egg, one egg white.

Made this with chives from my garden and it was good, but even better we thought, with a little fresh basil, grated parmesan cheese and lemon olive oil. I use "O" brand oil. A little goes a long way. I lift them out of the pan with a slotted spatula, but I love the teacup idea from a previous review! Will try that the next time.

Just a tip. Use canning jar tongs to take the dishes out. No burnt fingers !!

Because I only put one egg in each of the 4 ramekins 6 minutes was too long. It was delicious. Used the leftover "pesto" for breads and pasta.

Really outstanding...I made on toasted herb focacaia and used one egg per ceramic tea cup -- the handle made it easy to pick up out of the water and turn the egg out. A new brunch favorite!

Excellent flavor, beautiful presentation and super easy to prepare. My kind of recipe! A bonus is how fast it all comes together, without destroying the kitchen. That's important to me when serving guests breakfast in the morning - it should look effortless, and this recipe is. Thanks!

A simple, impressive brunch dish for company. It took me a few extra minutes to cook the eggs, and used smaller ramekins, but it still came out amazing!!

This was a really great change to the usual eggs benedict (not as good as smoked salmon mind you but different nonetheless). Although he never really said, the fact that my husband devoured the entire plate without so much as looking up pretty much says it all ~ yummy!

I have made this recipe several times and have received only raves everytime. I substituted smoked salmon for the prosciutto a few times, and it's just as good. Enjoy!

OH MY GOD!!!!! This was the best egg recipe I ever made! My husband loved it and wants me to fix it againe for dinner! I didn't cut the fat or anything out...that's what makes it so good. I highly recommend this recipe, and I hope you all enjoy it as much as my old man and me did. THANK YOU EPICIRIOUS! You saved my marriage!!!!!

Wonderful change of pace from regular eggs or Eggs Benedict. My husband loved them and he rarely eats anything but the simplest of eggs. I will use thinner cooking cups next time; my custard cups were too thick and it took longer to cook than the recipe called for.

Great flavors and very easy. It is a sure hit with guests.

Holy Moly, this is good, looks beautiful on a plate, and invites all sorts of personal twists to taste. It's best with the prosciutto or ham, though I made two without ham and added thinly sliced fresh buffalo mozzarella and basil for a vegetarian twist with great accolade. To cut down a bit on fat, I coated the ramekins (only needed 6 oz. size) with a spritz of cooking spray, and they slipped out like magic. Be quick in inverting the cup, otherwise they'll plop out and won't have that lovely molded look. This one's headed to the recipe box!

I substituted Spinach too, and it worked well. I used Smoked Salmon in instead of proscuto and got good marks

I made this for my husband and I last weekend, and we LOVED it! Perfect in a brunch menu!

Made this X-mas morning and it was excellent! (I have since made it using spinach and salmon instead of the arugula and prosciutto, which was just as good.) Really, give this a try!

This was delicious and a healthful change from Eggs Benedict! I added a spoonful of roasted red pepper puree with a touch of garlic for a pretty color contrast. Lots of possibilities for variations and SO EASY!!

Made this twice since I got the magazine last month. The first time was just to try and it was requested for Xmas morning so I made it then also. Simple and elegant. I substituted spinach for the arugula which worked out fine. Also couldn't get prosciutto once, it was still good (and maybe healthier) but it's better with.
