I loved this recipe...but I did doctor it a bit. I used fresh spaghettini instead of penne. There were a ton of leftovers so I could freeze them for lunches.

I used fresh tomatos and added spinach and mushrooms - yum! My husband ate the leftovers for a midnite snack.

This was much to bland and greasy for me. I've roasted artichokes and roma tomatoes and mixed that with pesto and enjoyed the results much more.

This is quick and good, and uses very few ingredients that are easy to have on hand. Everyone liked it. I halved the recipe for 3 women and we had leftovers.

I guess you could say that I 'doctored' this recipe a bit, not having marinated artichokes, rather canned quartered ones. The tomatoes in my pantry were the stewed italian style which I diced. I only used 1/3 cup of pesto and I added organic spinach from our CSA box at the end, along with some red pepper flakes...and this was a winner! I would say that this recipe serves 6, at least. Love those leftovers!

I think this is a little on the heavy side, but it's quick and delicious. I like to make this when I want something tasty but I don't want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen. It's perfect on a cold day!

This is a very tasty pasta dish. It tastes better than it looks though. I used home-made pesto and roasted Roma tomatoes. Sundried tomatoes would be good. I added a few red pepper flakes. Next time I'll add some chicken, although it was wonderful without. I will definitely make it again.

This is a great pasta recipe that is easy to prepare and has some depth. I used home made pesto. My family loved it. Grate additional cheese over top and garnish with a sprig of fresh basil. Will make over and over again.

Made this for 140 people at a luncheon and it was given outstanding reviews by all. Used flour with the onions and butter to thicken sauce and also added 1 can of tomato paste to 2 1/2 gal. of sauce.

Solid weeknight cooking. Fast, easy and flavorful. The trick to use the oil from the artichokes would not work with all brands as most artichokes are packed in an oil/ water mix. I substituted olive oil and a mix of spices (red pepper flakes, garlic, thyme, oregano) for mine.

Given all the rave reviews, I thought for sure this would be a big hit. It wasn't bad, just seemed a bit bland and boring. I even made pesto our family loves for it (arugula-basil pesto on epicurious) and it just didn't have the wow factor we were hoping for. It needed a bit more kick -- maybe adding some red pepper flakes or more artichoke marinade would help.

This was delicious... but made a ton (especially considering I cook for one). I'll be eating leftovers for days to come. I added a basket of mushrooms to saute with the onions & garlic and used homemade pesto. Will definitely make again. Lots of flavor in this dish. Delicious the second day (and the third, and the fourth...)

I was looking for something quick to make for my family, it was easy and a huge hit!! Will make again and again!

Delicious, especially the next day. Used my own pesto from last summer. Made the recipe last night and enjoyed it for dinner. But the best was having it straight out of the frig for lunch today. The flavours have melded beautifully. Think we'll be fighting over the leftovers!

I added half of a bunch of arugula to this recipe during the final mixing phase and it was delicious. I would highly advise it!

Yummy! This recipe was easy to make and better yet it was delicious. Definitely a great meal to make when you don't have a lot of time.

This was delish!!!! I saw nothing wrong with the color and it was very tasty.. I will surely be making it again.

I'm no cook, but I do love to eat. Made this dish for my boyfriend and we both loved it! I agree with others, it's not the prettiest dish, but what it lacks in appearance it makes up for in taste. I added a few crushed red chilies and some mushrooms....quite tasty.

Good for a fast and easy main or side dish. Goes well with grilled chicken. Not beautiful however, pesto and tomatoes make it look a little muddy

Rating: 1
the flavor combination of the pesto and artichokes just didn't appeal to me. Also, it was very unappetizing looking. Definitely would not make again.

So quick, easy to prepare and a wonderful combination of the flavors of Italy I love; no one ingredient over-powers the other. I agree that it is even better the next day. Enjoy! KIMBER

This was easy to make. I will use fresh roasted tomatoes next time I make this. It was even better the next day. Next time I make it I will make it a day in advance. That will give all the flavors a chance to blend better. I also swithced out the penne pasta for bowtie pasta.

This is a great recipe for really fast, but delicious dish. I followed the recipe pretty closely, but used fresh fetuccini instead of penne. The whole dinner took about 15 minutes to make from the time I started chopping onions until it was in our bowls. The leftovers were great too. Will definitely make this regularly.

This was fast and easy! I would add more artichokes and garlic next time but other than that it was great.

I have made this several times. It is a great, easy dish for nights when my husband and I both have to work late. It's been a tiny bit on the salty side most times, I guess that depends which brands I'm using at the time.

My fiance and I LOVE this recipe. I roast four fresh tomatoes instead of using canned and it tastes just like a restaurant pasta. (And I'm not talking Olive Garden, folks!)

I want to rate this 4 spoons, but I cannot really say "it is a dish beyond compare". However, it IS really REALLY good. It has a lot of flavor and is super easy to make. I will definitely make this again and again and again.

This recipe was without a doubt delicious! My family loved it and I would definitely make it again. We ate it hot but I'm sure it would be wonderful as a cold pasta salad!

This was wonderful! I had some leftover grilled salmon & tossed that in at the last minute. I'm eating the cold leftovers right now--makes for a great cold pasta salad!

I made this for a dinner party and it got rave reviews. It's a great meatless (and almost vegan!) entree that has loads of flavor and is easy to prepare. I'm making it again tonight!

This recipe was quick, easy, and tasty. I have 2 children under the age of 3 and for the ease of this, I definitely will keep it in the rotation during the week.

This is an awesome recipe! I added a sliced red pepper sauteed with the onion, and 1/3 cup dry white wine to rinse out the pesto sauce jar. This is a great recipe to make when you haven't planned anything, with ingredients in the cupboard. I meant to serve it with a salad and forgot that, and just served with freshly made focaccia bread and a bottle of good red wine. We loved it! We'll be having this again often, and plan to take it on the boat with us this summer.

Very good and easy to make. Have served to guests and family members - everyone thinks it's yummy. Suggest adding a bit more chees.

My husband liked this better than I... but since I do the cooking, this one won't be made again. Very mediocre - there are too many really good pasta recipes to settle for average.

I made this dish last night for my husband. I used pennette for the pasta. I followed the recipe as written and found it visually unappealing: brown sauce. I could have added fresh basil, more garlic, etc. but then I couldn't rate it on it's own merit, could I? It tasted fine as is, but it is not a keeper.

Rating: 3
Very flavorful! I used homemade pesto which I think is probably better tasting than storebought. I recommend making the recipe as is - it doesn't need extra garlic or artichoke marinade. I'll be making this again!

Rating: 3
we really loved this recipe. but, we found it most unattractive (red tomatoes + green pesto = brown unappealing sauce). perhaps i did something wrong. i did make it early in the day--perhaps it needs to be made closer to suppertime. can anyone help? we would love to eat this again, but ...... thanks in advance.

This is a great dish, and it is SO easy to make. I added more pesto than the recipe called for, and next time I will add more artichokes, too. They soak up the flavors really well. It works well as a side dish or main dish. Great recipe!

I made this for a light supper on New Year's Eve and it was delicious. I also used my own pesto sauce, but I am sure that a store-bought variety would be good. I will definitely make this again.

I will definitely make this again. We are always a little skeptical about new recipes but this one was a winner. The pesto and tomato combination is unusual and the pre-made ingredients made it easy to prepare.

I love to cook and made this dish for my wife and I the other night. I grow our own basil and therefore used our own Pesto. The dish was superb we both loved it. I plan to make it for our friends real soon.

Very yummy! Easy, quick, and delicious. I'll be making this again! I added more garlic and think next time will try adding extra fresh basil. A great alternative to the usual marinara sauce.

If you're tired of store-bought pasta sauce, this is definitely one to try. The flavorful mixture of tomato, artichoke, and pesto is perfect for those craving something new. Add extra garlic if you're a garlic lover!

Very easy, very tasty as a main course or even as a side.

Very nice. Double the garlic, make your own pesto, and use all the marinade from the artichokes.
