I've always found that the biggest pain with these types of sauces are preventing it from overheating and separating the fat from the butter. As stated, simply taking the pan off the heat for a few seconds while gradually adding the butter every so often worked perfectly. I followed the directions as stated though my reduction of the wine and vinegar wasn't as syrupy as expected. Regardless, the sauce was absolutely fantastic. I left out the extra salt and pepper at the end, it was already delicious and I didn't want the extra bite of pepper. I tried to recreate a dish I had at Trellis in Kirkland, WA, gnocchi with beurre blanc, pancetta, and fried sage. It turned out wonderfully. I kept it warm in bowl of warm water while the gnocchi cooked, which heated it right back up when it was mixed in.

Why does it have a video for Aioli attached to it ???

perfect! I used part red wine vinegar and part distilled white vinegar and subbed soy milk for the cream. Also, added a few drops of dijon mustard and a squeeze of lemon. I only used about 3/4 of a stick of butter (I used vegan earth balance) which achieved the butter flavor. There was enough for about 3-4 servings. It was delicious drizzled over salmon!

I didn't have time to follow the recipe exactly, so I changed it a little. I made it with white wine vinegar, rice wine vinegar, garlic and butter. It was delicious!

This is my absolute favorite sauce in the world. I would tweak the directions, though: It's best to remove the sauce from the heat before beginning to add the butter. The hallmark of a beurre blanc is a perfectly smooth, creamy texture; too much heat will cause the butter to separate. You want to rely on residual heat to bring the sauce together as you gradually add the butter.

I was worried about the amount of white vinegar because my family does not like that type of flavor (eg sour pickles, etc) however this sauce is incredible! Everyone thought it was extremely delicious and it was not difficult at all! We had it over the crab stuffed sole and it was fantastic!

Oh. My. Goodness. Rushed home from "Julie and Julia" to make this amazing and simple sauce. I made just half for the two of us and it was still way more than we needed. The entire recipe would generously sauce 8 servings of fish. At that rate, you would only be getting one tablespoon of butter and 1/2 tablespoon of cream, so its not nearly as deadly as it looks from the recipe. Forget the Smart Balance once in a while and try this. Thanks, Julia!

Delicious! My daughter & I came home from seeing Julie & Julia and just had to made a beurre blanc! This was great! We served it over tilapia & added parsley at the end. It would be great with any herb that matches what you are serving. Lemon zest is also a good add-in.

lovely sauce, be sure not to use too much shallot, as the reduction is pretty fast and furious and the shallot gives off a lot of flavor. needs quite a bit more pepper than suggested.
