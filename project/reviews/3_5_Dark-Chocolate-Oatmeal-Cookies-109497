I found this recipe because I was looking for an oatmeal cookie recipe that used steel cut oats instead of instant. The cookie was delicious but the oats were kind of pointless, you could barely tell they were in there at all. I will try again, but plan on increasing the oats so that they're noticeable.

This recipe was fantastic. I am very excited to have found a cookie recipe that doesn't need eggs or a ton of butter to be exceptional. For the seasoned baker, this is an ideal recipe to edit and play with. I lessened the butter, doubled the vanilla and used coarse sea salt. They turned out fantastic.

Worried I left something out, as the dough was almost crumbly; only came together when moistened with water. Doubled receipe,. Didn't think I'd ever bake these again, but actually tasted pretty good.

I doubled the recipe--who wants 12 cookies!?--and they seem to have turned out really well. I did everything as directed, times two. My stand mixer didn't produce those "moist clumps" after adding the dry ingredients and I worried I had left something out. I hadn't, so I just mixed the dough well with my fingers. I formed cookies with a 1-Tbsp. scoop and did not press them down. They look like the picture. I must say that the oat meal seems somewhat superfluous. These are a lovely, tender chocolate cookie. Not sure why the oatmeal is even there. There is also a somewhat salty undertaste, but that's OK with me.

Super simple. Super good. I didn't let my butter get quite to room temperature and was careful not to acually over beat the butter, sugar and vanilla. I think this helped alleviate the spreading issue others reported in their reviews. I also baked these on parchment paper with no grease. They came right off when they were cool. We absolutely make again and again.

Ohh sooo Chocolatey! I followed the ingredients & instructions as listed with the exception of putting the cookie balls in the freezer while the oven preheated. Then flattened them to 1/4" thick and baked them on lightly buttered parchment paper. I definately will make again.

Good cookies for people with egg allergies. My kids loved them. They taste like brownie cookies. If you don't put too much shortening on the pans to grease them, they will not spread too much. I also chilled the dough after making balls for 15 minutes before putting them on the baking sheet and flattening them. They are delicate when you get them out of the oven. It is best to let them cool a bit on the cookie sheet before moving the cookies to a rack. Once they cool, they harden up fine. I used regular steel cut oats. Next time I make these cookies, I will try quick cooking steel cut oats.

Made a batch of these cookies this afternoon. Fantastic chocolate flavor and I rather like the "sandy" texture --- bit different than most cookies. The oats do add a chewiness to the cookies -- but if you are used to "regular" oatmeal cookies -- it's not really comparable. The chocolate really plays the lead role in these cookies -- so I would recommend using good cocoa powder and chocolate chips (I used organic cocoa powder from a local shop and Bernard Callebaut chocolate chips). Only change that I made to the recipe was to use bittersweet chocolate chips -- because that's what I had in my pantry.

I made these exactly as written and didn't really enjoy them. They just taste like chocolate mixed with butter - nothing special. Mine spread out really thin on the cookie sheet too.

My new favorite cookie! Will definitely make again! Only baked 10-11 min.

far, far too much butter, which causes them to flatten, spread, and turn out greasy. either add more flour or reduce amount of butter. also, cooking time is far too long. 10 minutes tops, and take them out before you think they're done.

This has become a favorite cookie at my house. I use mini chips and double both the oats and the chips. I make them thin (cook 10ish minutes) and they are the perfect crunchy/tender, not too sweet cookie.

Rating: 3
I liked these but I may have over beat my butter or mixed the dough, because my cookies spread quite thin & had a softer texture than I was expecting, based on all the "sandy" reviews. Next time I will be more careful with the dough & may chill the cookies before baking & bake for longer for a thicker, sandier biscuit. The chocolate flavor is good & the oats are unique, though not amazing. I used bittersweet chocolate chips, which I may halve next time & will definitely cut the salt down, maybe half? I found these too salty (yes, I used unsalted butter). A good place to start, I look forward to improving my first attempt.

I made these as written (I had no eggs and wanted to make cookies) and they are delicious and tasty. I highly recommend making them as written, especially if you like sandy textured cookies. They remind me of the "world peace" cookies (Dorie Greenspan). Enjoy!

used earth balance instead of butter. they came out perfectly. the steel-cut oats had a nutty crunch and my housemates asked, "are there walnuts in these?" peanut-butter-chocolate-chips pushed these into the realm of sugar coma.. will stick with the semisweet next time. i formed them into balls and spaced them farther apart than other cookies and spread lots and came out well. they lasted five minutes out of the oven. definitely making a double batch next time. i'm not a chocolate fanatic, but these were fantastic.

These are incredible ONLY if you wait until the next day to eat them - you must give them 24 hours! Very much like sandies or sables, they are buttery & rich. I have over 75 very special cookie recipes - this is one of the best. Use the steel cut oats - they're necessary for the texture...

As a chocoholic and a frequent baker, I found this recipe to be a huge disappointment. I added an egg as suggested by previous reviews since I like a moist cookie and also adjusted flour down and quick oats up. Overall, it's just not that chocolatey. The dough is thick, sticky and hard to work with. There are so many other, better chocolate cookie recipes out there - on this site and elsewhere. I wouldn't waste your time with this one.

Rating: 3
I made the recipe basically as is. I didn't have any cocoa powder on hand, so I nixed that entirely. I also used milk chocolate chips. Really give these guys space on the cookie sheet because they will seriously expand. Unfortunately, mine ran together.But aside from having blobby cookies, they taste great. Definitely a recipe to double, at the very least. Just don't be expecting soft cookies, and you won't be disappointed. Crispy, and airy, these are delightful.

I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. These were great! I doubled the vanilla, as I do in most recipes, and have tried them both with steel cut oats and old fashioned oats and they were great both ways.

This is my 2nd attempt at it. 1st time, I used 1 egg, wholemeal flour, half brown sugar& half white sugar, added 1/4 Cup chopped walnut, 1/4 rolled oats. Did not have semi-sweet baking choc so I used baking M&Ms. I came out perfect. It had bite because of the rolled oats and the whole meal flour but it tasted SO Good! Everyone LOVED it. Today, I had to make some for my son's food fair at school tomorrow. I forgot abt the suggestions of the egg & additional oats. Followed the recipe word for word, and sorry to say... it tasted sandy & dry. A far cry from the 1st time I made them with the adjustments. Gonna have to make a New batch again later. Good recipe, but need to adjustment to be perfect. Forgot to rate it just now.

I didn't read the recipe all the way through before starting and I panicked a bit when I realized that eggs weren't listed in the ingredients. I read it and re-read it to be sure and then I read the reviews. I'm glad I decided to disregard all the cautionary tales and go ahead and make these *basically* according to the recipe. These are gorgeous cookies! I didn't have any chocolate chips, so I smashed up a bit of Callebaut milk chocolate and I used steel cut oats. I rolled the dough in sugar and baked them for 12 minutes. I also let them cool completely on the cookie sheet. To be honest, I wasn't expecting much, so I was pretty thrilled after tasting one and loving it. Crispy, very chocolately... really, just so good! My daughter was annoyed that I was making oatmeal cookies, but I suspect when she unpacks her lunch tomorrow and samples one of these cookies, we will have a new family favourite on our hands. Definitely double or even triple the recipe...

I made these for St. Patrick's Day using McCann's Irish Steel-Cut Oats. I read through the comments, many users commenting on the need for an egg for a creamier/smoother cookie texture. I didn't have an egg in the house, and followed the recipe as written. I can see why people would want to add an egg if they didn't like the "sandy" quality of the cookies, but the finished texture reminded me of sandies and sables. Ok, not exactly my all-time favorite, but quite pleasant, too. And do let the cookies rest on the baking sheet before trying to transfer them to a cooling rack. They'll have firmed up a little so they don't fall apart on you.

I absolutely love english tea time - and this will become my new favorite. If you've ever had english hobknobs while on campus at an english college - this is the recipe for you. The consistency is like an english tea biscuit; it is both light and rich at the same time. I added one egg as other reviews, used 1/2 C oats, and also sprinked powdered sugar on top. Don't forget the tea for you, and a glass of milk for the kids.

Rating: 3
Like some of the other reviewers, I was suspicious of a recipe without an egg and with only two tablespoons of oats (the whole reason I searched for the recipe was to use up oats I have). I added an egg after creaming the butter and sugar, and reduced the flour to 1/2 a cup, then increased the oatmeal to 1/4 cup plus two tablespoons. I also used quick oats, and swapped chocolate chips for chopped-up Godiva bars I had left over. Finally, I also dusted the tops with sifted powdered sugar. The result? A delicious, tender cookie, with a rich chocolate taste and the firmness of oatmeal. I don't have grounds for comparison, but these changes made it a cookie I will make again.

Rating: 3
I added a small egg to the wet ingredients and used raw cane sugar. I made the cookies rather large - about 3 inches - and they came out very light and airy. Had previously tried making according to the recipe, and the cookies came out too dry. If you use an egg and make them big enough, they won't be fragile. I baked them for 12 minutes.

Yumm! I decided to make these on a whim to bring over to a friend's house. I used salted butter because I didn't have unsalted, and just omitted the salt in the recipe - this ended up working just right. I doubled the recipe and added about 1/2 cup chopped dried cherries. Ate 2 right out of the oven (after they firmed up a bit) and, had to hold back so there would be some left to bring to my friend. Very chocolatey and rich!

I used rolled oats and added one egg. All in all, I found them just ok. I found them kind of greasy.. so I'd decrease the butter at least to 1/4C.

I am definitely adding these to my regular cookie repertoire. I made them per the recipe with the following changes: added ~4T of old-fashioned rolled oats (had them on hand) and skipped the chocolate chips since I didn't have any. I also recommend baking them for a little less time - closer to 12 minutes than 14. And don't move them until they cool or they will fall apart. Not too sweet, perfect with cold milk. Definitely adding these to my regular baking repertoire.

This recipe is very simple. I followed it exactly except I used old fashion oats. I would agree with the others that it could use more oats. I double the recipe and would recommend that too, if you would like more than 12 normal sized cookies. We are going to have the remaining with ice cream!

I LOVE these. They are crisp, but tender. Not hard at all. A little fragile so be careful removing cookies from the cookie sheet while still hot. I used the steel cut oats. I think they would still be great without them. I did chill the cookie sheet with the flattened cookies before I baked them. I also rolled the balls of dough in sugar before I flattened them. I just like the way it looks. There's just two of us. 12 large cookies is plenty.

My husband made these for a family picnic and they were superb. We used Quaker oats, as that's what we had in the cupboard. He took the advise of other reviews and chilled the dough and pushed it down on the sheet before baking. He added another tablespoon of oats (per batch) since it didn't call for too much in the original recipe. We also tripled the recipe. It is a small batch when made as written.

I love these cookies, but I leave out the oatmeal. To put a spin on things, I use them to make homemade ice cream sandwiches, or I make a white chocolate ganche, and make fanciful "OREO" cookies.

For those questioning various oat types...In the United States and Canada, 'oatmeal' can refer to products made from oat groats, such as cut oats, crushed oats, and rolled oats. The groats are coarsely ground to make oatmeal, or cut into small pieces to make steel-cut oats, or steamed and rolled to make rolled oats. The quick-cooking rolled oats ("quick oats or 1 minute oats") are cut into small pieces before being steamed and rolled. "Instant" oatmeal is pre-cooked and dried. For those across the pond, I believe you go by Course, Med and Fine. Medium (Scottish Pinhead) is what we call steel cut. I hope that helps clarify.

These cookies did spread more than I liked, the other cooks are correct, the pan could stand a little visit to the refrigerator for 15 minutes before baking. The steelcut oats are worth seeking out for the unusual and wonderful texture! I also didn't mind the small recipe size, you know how extra cookies just jump in your mouth when you're not paying attention.

After reviewing the comments, I doubled the recipe and made the following modifications. 1. replaced half the all purpose flour with oat flour (3/4 c. all purpose flour, 3/4 c. oat flour) 2. added 1 egg 3. used old-fashioned oats (what I had on hand) I refrigerated the dough for a bit before baking and was very pleased with the results.

My children and I made these to have for Mother's Day tomorrow, but we ate them all tonight so we will have to make more!!! They are fabulous! But I agree, the recipe does not make enough.

These got rave reviews from my friends! They all asked me for the recipe. I quadrupled the recipe, and used rolled oats for lack of steel-cut oats. They tasted good all the same. I also replaced some of the butter with flax meal (which substitutes well for a bit of oil or fat when baking). my only complaint: the recipe doesn't make nearly enough. You'll be happier with a double recipe at least!

These were baked exactly as described and they turned out great. Apart from the oats, they remind me of Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafers- only much better. I won't ever have to purchase them again-just make these w/o the oats. On a seperate note, I like to read these reviews before baking/cooking. It's great to get the tips and creative adaptations that cooks add, as well as some modifications. That said, the value of reviews are diminished when people rate a recipe poorly when it's most likely that THEY did something wrong. These recipes undergo rigorous testing and are rarely mistaken.

I have made these cookies many, many times. The taste is excellent, not too sweet, just salty enough, and the dark chocolate is perfect with the oatmeal.

These were good - not fantastic - with the steel cut oats. I was a bit disappointed. I felt like I missed a step - like partially cooking the oats to soften them. My five year old loves them, though. Next time I'll try the regular oats. I only use those in cookies, everything else is steel cut here. For the person wanting to know about traditional oats - there's the note at the bottom of the recipe: Market tip: Old-fashioned oats have been cut, steamed, and flattened with large rollers. Steel-cut oats are not as highly processed and look like tiny pellets. They produce a more al dente result.

Yum! Yum! My husband called these "the perfect cookie". I've made them many times. So quick and easy to whip together. A few notes: My first batch burned a bit. Using a 'generous' tablespoon is far too big. Mine burnt before the middle was cooked. Either remember to flatten or use a smaller teaspoon ball and put the ball on the baking sheet and allow it to 'flatten' itself. I prefer the latter. I used rolled oats and liked that much better. Also rolled the dough balls in sugar before baking. If you are missing chocolate chips substitute with chopped walnuts for a yummy variation. to get the proper consistency you must use butter, yup, butter. No imitations. Must be room temp, must be beaten on at least medium and if you follow measurements accurately don't be alarmed if it seems dry, it will be perfect. Screw eating a half dozen low fat cookies! Eat two of these and ENJOY!!

These have come out well and badly for me. They always come out well if the butter is very cold when I first put the ingredients together and if I let the batter rest in the fridge for about 10 minutes before I start forming the cookies. I also swiped the great idea from another commenter who greased the bottom of a glass, dipped it in sugar and used that to press the balls of dough. They come come out very pretty that way. Thanks for the tip, whoever that was! The final cookies are delicious and we make them all the time.

This recipe has been changed!!! No wonder there is such a wide range of reviews. I saved this recipe from this site - it called for 3/4 cup of cocoa and 3/4 cup chocolate chips.

These cookies are great for chocolate lovers who don't like overly sweet concoctions. After baking 5 variations, the best ones were with traditional oats rather than steel-cut (far more attractive) and no toppings (such as crystalized sugar). The original ingredient ratios worked best.

Easy and delicious. My butter was very soft which made the dough easy to work with and probably increased my yield (I doubled the recipe but ended up with three dozen cookies). Take the recommendation of rimmed baking sheets to heart. Using a rimmed sheet will control the spread of the cookies and keep them from burning or cooking too quickly.

While they've got oatmeal in them, these are hardly oatmeal cookies. I found that if I baked them on a normal baking sheet, they got overly brown and crispy, but if I baked them on a double-layer sheet, they come out just like the picture. Ever so slightly salty, good chocolate flavor.

Definitelyl a "Got Milk" cookie. Very chocolately and not too sweet, which I liked. But too much butter IMO, made it overly greasy and rich. I used the steel cut oats and liked the bit of crunch and texture they added. These do seem to be a rather flat, crispy cookie, not as puffy/chewy looking as the photo would suggest.

I made smaller cookies and to flatten them, I greased the bottom of a glass, dipped it in sugar and used that the press each cookie. Maybe because I live at 6,000 feet, they cooked only 8 minutes. Longer and they would have burned. I like them a lot.

These cookies are awesome. They are super chocolately without being cloyingly sweet. I always double the recipe.

After reading several reviews I considered making some of the recommended changes because I didn't want tough cookies but decided in the end to try the recipe as written then decide how to change. Aside from using old-fashioned oats, I made no changes and my dough was not stiff, the cookies chewy and tender and not overly sweet. I did use Double Dutch Dark Chocolate powder from the Baker's Catalog so not sure if that made a difference; I also creamed the butter for about 5 minutes until doubled in size. Absolutely delicious! Very rich and chocolate-ly with a nice sandy texture similar to shortbread. Very easy to make which is an added bonus.

Loved it! Based on suggestions below, made the following changes: - used old-fashioned oats, not steel-cut - added an egg (chewy and moist cookie) - shortened cooking time by about one minute Because I had it lying around the house, I used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder. Delicious!! Perhaps a weensy sprinkle less salt next time. Husband looked dubious at the sticky black mass as I rolled it into balls and squished them flat, but inhaled the final product. Will DEFINITELY make this again.

These are very good, but dry. If you like a crisp cookie, these are great. The batter is the driest I've ever seen--lots of little crumbly balls. But they do come together when worked between your hands. It was a bit startling to me at first, though, I was sure I'd done something wrong. But in the end it's a very tasty cookie.

These cookies are chocolately, and very sweet. I would advise 1/4 cup of sugar instead of the orginial half cup. Some of the cookies flattened quite alot in the oven. Overall this recipe is a keeper.

I adore this recipe and make it every time I have a chocolate craving. With the steel-cut oats, it feels like a health food recipe, but it still tastes like a treat. Yummmm.

Simple, easy, chocolately, delicious! My husband and children loved them for their flavor and texture. I loved them for those reasons and the fact that they took mere minutes to put together. I doubled the batch, used rolled oats and cooked them for only 12 minutes. The results were great! This is definitely a keeper.

I can't believe something this good could be this easy. I baked three batches before the kids let me get a look in. Definitely double the ingredients. I used old fashioned oats.

Awesome!!! quick to make, easy and delicious. I am definitely scoring good points making these cookies for my family

These look fabulous coming out of the oven, and taste-wise they are very good, but I wasn't able to pick up a single cookie without it completely crumbling. I used Smart Balance instead of butter, which usually produces great results, but perhaps it was a mistake with this recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the oats, I used old fashioned. These are fabulous cookies!

I make these regularly because they're quick and very easy. If you don't like the density of the basic recipe, here are two different ways to change them up. 1) Reducing the flour to 1/2 cup + 1 tbsp makes a crispier, flatter cookie; 2) adding an egg makes a chewier, flatter cookie. You don't lose the great deep-chocolate flavour either way. All three approaches have been very popular.

These cookies are absolutely delicious! They have a nice crunchy texture and really satisfy a chocolate craving. The Ghiradelli double chocolate chips work very well in this recipe. I recommend doubling or tripling this recipe when making, because they are always eaten right away!

Delicious! Will definatly double the recipie next time, as they only lasted the afternoon. To the cook from Deerfield... you may have overbaked, as the cookies firm up after they cool. Try reducing your time slightly.

Help! Made these exactly as stated in the magazine. We about broke our teeth on the steel cut oats and the cookies were flat and crisp. The chocolate flavor was great. With all the positive reviews, I'm wondering if I did something wrong(?). I'm curious enough to try again, but would like some tips. There really isn't any moisture in this cookie, should I have cooked the oats? Any suggestions?

I just finished making these. They are really yummy. I tried doubling the recipie. they turned out ok...they flattened out a little too much. I would definately add more flour and try again next time. these are a great chocolate craving fix!!! enjoy.

This was a wonderful cookie. I was afraid I wasn't cooking them long enough, but they cooled to be firm and tender. They were delicious.

Eek! I had made this before the recipe was changed to match the one in the magazine, and didn't notice the changes until the cookies were done. I had tried using Splenda Blend and was blaming the difference on that. Next time I'll use the 3/4 c cocoa, and real sugar.

I used the magazine version of the recipe and regular oats - loved the results! I'm always complaining that chocolate cookies don't have much chocolate flavor, but this recipe proved me wrong. Also, it's great to have a delicious recipe like this on hand when you're low on eggs.

These cookies came out rich and delicious. They were easy to make and I would make them again. I substituted white chocolate chips in my cookies and the contrast was great. I made my cookies smaller and rounder as well.

Simply put: great, rich, chocalatey, brownie-like biscuits. I followed the online recipe to a "t" in terms of ingredients. Only change: I started the cookies almost rounded (only slightly flattened) and then flattened slightly with a spatula at 7 minute mark, when I also rotated the pan. These came out about 1/2" thick and were intensely chocolatey - very good, with slightly melted chips and a crumbly texture. These are not your typical cookies and are much drier. I bake a ton and would not change these a bit - enjoy them as they are.

I've just made these for the third time, following the printed recipe from May 2004, rather than the online amounts. Once again, the cookies were very well received. They're rich without being sugary, which I quite enjoy. The steel-cut oats are not to everybody's taste but are a big hit with those who enjoy something other than a store-bought cookie.

Rating: 3
I like these but the recipe does need some tweaking. They need a bit more oatmeal and chips for texture. Also, they only need to be flattened very slighytly or they are thin, flat, and hard. I only baked them 12 minutes.

Um, at 14 minutes, there is no way in the world that 3/4th cup of flour will hold up a cookie of that density. In fact, I just made the recipe to a T, and they spread until they became crispy little things.

These are INTENSE! If you crave rich, deep chocolate cookies, then look no further. Regarding the controversial adjustments, try 1/2 cup of cocoa, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 3/4 cup chocolate chips. These cookies are incredible!

Thanks to all the reviewers who alerted me to the revised amounts of cocoa, salt, and chocolate chips in the magazine version. These cookies were fabulous, and a big hit with my cookie monsters.

I have been making these cookies from the magazine and was horrified to discover that the online version (which I gave a friend) has three errors. There should be 1/4 cup each of the cocoa, salt and chocolate chips. This version has 3/4 cup each. Please correct the online version!

This is a gorgeous, rich and delicious cookie. They became one of my standard recipes the first time I tried them. Try bittersweet chocolate or Ghiradelli Double Chocolate Chips instead of semi-sweet, they add extra depth to the flavour.

I had pulled the paper copy from the May magazine and wanted to double check the oats quantity. Much to my surprise, the on-line recipe has 3/4 cups of cocoa, chips and 3/4 tsp salt compared to 1/4 cup/tsp in the magazine. I used the 1/4 c cocoa and 1/4 t salt, but increased 1/2 c chips. They turned out very good, but could have used a little more cocoa and oats.

I didn't think it was horrible, but my husband absolutely hated it! The cookies were very dense. My husband described them as "hard, stale brownies." Don't know if I did something wrong or not...followed the recipe, but lengthed the cooking time slightly (about 3 minutes). Tend to have great successes with most baking, so I was rather surprised by the poor results.

Rating: 4
Very, very chocolately and very, very yummy. The cookie itself wasn't really sweet, and this made the chocolate chips an almost unpleasant, too sweet intrusion. Next time, I'll see what happens if I omit them and maybe add a touch less salt. I did have to add a dash of milk to get the dough to hold together, but it didn't seem to be a problem.

Great cookies. I used very warm butter (room temperature, but meaning 85 degrees or so) and only cooked them 10 minutes on the top rack of the oven. They have a great texture, wonderful flavor, and I had no problem mixing them despite the lack of egg. The Brits among us were particularly happy. Warning, though-- these are for chocoholics only...

I made a batch last night and there are only two left this morning - a very unique and delicious biscuit and a new favourite for my boyfriend. I'd best describe it as fudgy shortbread - and with 3/4 cup of cocoa, of course it's going to be intensely chocolate! They are quite salty, but I really liked the salt/sweet contrast. If you're not a fan, just cut the salt. I used organic cocoa, oats and vanilla.

Very good -a little like shortbread, rich and not too sweet. Oats add a nice texture. Great with coffee.

I found these extremely easy to make and satisfied my need for a chocolate fix. I noticed that the recipe in the magazine calls for 3/4 cup chocolate chips. I split the difference and used 1/2 cup of mini chips. I also used old fashioned oatmeal. The texture came out just like a standard chocolate chip cookie - fairly flat, a little crispy, but not crumbly. Not too chewy, either. In fact, it has hard to tell that they DIDN'T have an egg in them (I guess I'd been expecting more of a shortbread texture). I didn't have any problem with the batter not coming together - used by Kitchenaid stand mixer. Anyway, I liked them a lot and would definitely make them again when I need cookies but don't have any eggs.

Apparently I didn't really understand the concept of "biscuit". The cookies were too chocolatey and mine burned. I used the steel-cut oats and I didn't really like the texture. Would not recommend it.

This is a great, different cookie recipe. If you start adding egg and using just old-fashioned oats, you'll lose the uniqueness. On the first try I got fantastic biscuits. My husband said I could make them anytime, all the time!

Very chocolatey cookies, but a bit salty. I made the first pan of cookies too flat and they crumbled after baking. I'll make these again, but I'll reduce the salt, and I might try adding an egg to the mixture.

These cookies were ok. Very chocolatey but they seemed very salty also. Perhaps I mismeasured. I would cut back the salt to a 1/2 teaspoon. And word of caution to anyone trying to cut back on fat and calories: don't decrease the amount of butter, or the cookies won't hold together.

Chocolatey--Yes, Crunchy--Most definately. My mother is Scottish to the bone-- she LOVED these cookies becuase she believes that cookies should be crunchy. I'm not a huge fan-- but they were very fast and easy to make! I'd do it again... for her that is.

These were very good, and quite different from other cookies I've made. To the reader who wondered if the missing eggs were a typo: I don't think so. These are a "sandy"-type cookies, and have an entirely different texture than your average chocolate chocolate chip cookie. They do require a bit of kneading to come together, but are very easy otherwise.

Rating: 2
These cookies were very cocoa-y and rich. Much better after a day or two when the flavours really developed and they got more moist. I added an egg - the recipe definitely needs it. Otherwise there is cocoa and flour flying around the kitchen. Much like a brownie cookie.

Nice and chocolately, but too crumbly for what I was looking for.

My 10-year-old daughter has made these 3 times in the past 2 weeks, completely unassisted, to rave reviews from visiting kids and grownups alike. After the first time, she doubled the recipe...and doubled proportion of chocolate chips. She used oatmeal but would like to try with chewier steel-cut oats. The texture is a little unusual without eggs, a bit crumbly, but not that difficult to work with. My kids love it that they're allowed to nip into the uncooked dough. I'd say these are the first cookies we've made that can compete with our No. 1, ordinary tollhouse chocolate-chip cookies.

Perfection! The oats serve up a bit of unusual crunch. "I like these ones," said a four-year old, fingers and mouth thick with chocolatey crumbs. My batch made 18, plenty big, might cut sugar to 1/4c next time. Will long be a favorite.

Did I miss something? The "batter" didn't bind at all. I ended up adding two eggs before forming them into cookies. They tasted good, but really nothing to rave over. Please tell me if I did something wrong or if there is a typo in the recipe posted.

These are great - very chocolatey but not overly sweet, and the crunch from the oats gives them a really nice texture and unexpected surprise. Try one with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
