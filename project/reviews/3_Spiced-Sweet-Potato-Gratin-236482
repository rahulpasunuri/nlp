Huge hit with our family! Only advice is to only use 3 lbs. of potatoes. Would love to hear if anyone has ideas to lighten this up a bit.

After reading the other reviews, I did cook the potatoes until they were done. I think it was a little too long because they became mushy and I wasn't able to get nice slices. After mixing the spices together as the recipe calls for I realized it was going to be a little to strong for my taste. I only used about a 1/4 TBS of the spice mixture on each layer...and it was just enough. I couldn't imagine using all that the recipe called for. I would use less cumin next time as it was the most overwhelming of the flavors to come through. I served it room temperature as the directions call to do, but ended up reheating it as it did not taste great at room temperature. Definately serve this after it cools for about 10 mins. I cooled it on a baking rack with a piece of foil under it because it was dripping oil from the cheese and sour cream. Overall, I enjoyed it, but some of my guests didn't care for the Indian flavors.

Every time I make this it is a hit. It is quite rich so unless there are quite a few people it doesn't always get finished in one setting. I sometimes bring this for the holidays instead of making the marshmallow or sweet yam/sweet potato dish. I also always use the Maharaja curry powder from Penzy's. I highly recommend Penzy's spice company to everyone. The spices really are an important piece to this dish. Use quality spices and you will taste the difference.

I had the good fortune to have this served to me at a friend's house last Thanksgiving. It was one of the best things I've ever had. The flavors were perfect.

This recipe is excellent. I used the Maharaja curry powder from Penzy's Spice company. The key is to use really good quality cheese and spices. And not to skimp on the cheese. I used red skinned yams, the flavor is much much better than sweet potatoes as sweet potatoes don't fit with these spices very well, in my opinion at least. I also added lemon zest which gives it a nice dimension. I made this for a party and everyone loved it.

This recipe, made exactly as directed, results in a beautiful dish with an enticing aroma. However, the flavors didn't blend well and the cheese (an excellent one) overpowered the flavor of the potatoes. I'm glad I tried it before deciding to serve it to guests. Disappointing.

I have made this 4 times and everyone including children have loved it. It also traves well - 2days of driving before Thanksgiving !

Agree that cooking time for sweet potatoes needs to be increased IF you make this. No one finished their helping at dinner. The flavors are nice. I pureed the remaining gratin and made a soup rather than throw all away. That was a hit, they didn't know it was their rejected dish from Thanksgiving.

This was a great twist on traditional sweet potatoes. Made it for Thanksgiving and sweet potato lovers raved. I could have done with less cumin and will do so next time. But very tasty.

Wish I could use zero forks. This recipe was terrible--oily from the cheese and the spice combination just tasted funky. Made for Thanksgiving and everyone hated it--had to throw the whole thing away.

This was a nice twist on the traditional sweet sweet potatoes at the Thanksgiving table -- although the sharp cheese was an off note. I'd use something milder next time.

This recipe was not difficult, although I peeled the sweet potatoes first and then boiled them. It just wasn't that good. It was not bad and my mother liked them a lot but no one else at the table was crazy about them. It wasn't an embarassment but I wouldn't make it again.

I made this exactly by the recipe. We didn't care for it, but maybe that is just our individual tastes. If you do make it, the cook times need to be increased to get the potatoes done. 3 1/4 pounds of potatoes are more that you will need for the 9" pan. I had about a pound left over. Personally, I think it needs more salt and pepper.

This recipe is quite good. I did use butternut squash rather than sweet potatoes and also substituted light sour cream. We will have this again for Thanksgiving
