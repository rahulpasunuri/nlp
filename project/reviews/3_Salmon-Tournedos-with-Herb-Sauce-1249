The sauce is a magnificent foil for the salmon in this. I have made it several times with both salmon steaks and filets. The latter is not so nice for presentation, but if taste is all that counts...

Absolutely delicious, and easy to make for guests.

I make this all the time and find it well liked by my guests. It assembles easily if you treat the two salmon pieces like two commas, one inverted into the other and then pull the tails around to form the tournedo circle. I first made the recipe after seeing it on "Madeline Cooks"...Madeline Kamman's PBS TV series from the mid'80s. The sauce here is better than her simple compound dill butter, but both make it a delicious and easy salmon entree. It works well on the barbeque! also.

A fine tasting recipe, but it is impossible to debone and skin salmon steaks without them falling apart. I kept the skin on, the bones intact and ommited the tortilla wrap. The meal got rave reviews from my guests although I thought it to be a bit ordinary for all the work that goes into it. I also think the cooking time is more like 25 min.

Did not use the sauce. Instead used chive oil (chives pureed with olive oil) to keep the recipe heart friendly.
