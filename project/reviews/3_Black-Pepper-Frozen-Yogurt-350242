This was a REALLY interesting frozen yogurt and I thought the pepper-flavored caramel was really nice. I used a very thick Greek yogurt (Fage) and got a nice texture. It was very tangy, though, and the tang seemed heightened by the pepper. I would actually like to try it as an ice cream and see what that's like.

This was an interesting novelty, but I don't think I would make it again. Contrary to the previous reviewer, I found this to be exceedingly peppery. In retrospect, I think there are several possible explanations for this difference in our results. For one thing, I was using very good quality Tellicherry black peppercorns (from Penzeys). For another, based on the previous review, I ball-parked my measurement of the second tablespoon of blackpepper, erring on the more-rather-than-less side. Additionally, after I cracked the peppercorns in my mill, I then ground them further in a mortar (my thought was that the more pulverized the pepper, the stronger the flaver would be due to the increased surface area of the flakes). Also, I let the mixture chill for about 19 hours instead of the suggested 8 hours (I had other committments). The end product was an exceedingly blackpepper-flavored caramel frozen yogurt, and not in a good way. It is possible that milling and mortaring the pepper and then letting the mixture sit for more than twice the suggested time amped up the flavor too much. Alternatively, it possible that I ground the pepper so small that too much of it passed through the strainer when it came the filtering step. Either way, the result was just way too pepper for me.

This was better than I expected! The caramel hardens when you add the milk- but then dissolves as the custard comes to a simmer. I'm glad I stuck with it. There wasn't a very strong pepper taste- maybe next time I'll crush my pepper a bit more, I was a little afraid it would be too peppery. The flavor is smooth, sweet and like a dark caramel. Pretty good!
