Perfect. Don't change a thing. Don't worry when you think the dough is too wet. It's supposed to be this way. Delicious.

Making this for a second time this Easter. It was a huge it last year and it looks very pretty on the table. This year though I will experiment with a different food coloring method for the decorative eggs because last year the color ran into the dough as the bread baked in the oven.

Very tasty, especially when just baked. Couple of comments to note when preparing. First, I used store bought dye for my eggs and it tended to "run" into the dough during rising. I think perhaps they weren't quite at room temperature. Second, when preparing the master sweet dough, make sure that you don't leave the stand mixer unattended. Mine almost shimmied off the counter, (I doubled the recipe though.) Third, the recipe doesn't state whether the eggs were edible following baking. To be on the safe side, I discarded the eggs. Although it was very pretty with the eggs, I probably wouldn't use eggs in the future. Otherwise, an excellent challah recipe.

Seriously the BEST sweet bread I've ever had and made. So rich, sweet, buttery - but still light and flakey. Very much like a brioche, but more sugar, I believe. The dough is definitely wet. Don't worry about this at all. It comes together. I let mine rise overnight in the fridge. Made three loaves in one batch. All were perfect!

Wonderful. I am not a big fan of sweet bread, but couldn't leave this alone. Don't worry that the dough is really wet, it works great.

This bread was absolutely delicious! This was my first attempt at making easter bread and it came out perfectly. Received rave reviews from my Italian family and requests for it to be a yearly staple at our Easter dinner.
