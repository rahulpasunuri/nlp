Exceptional. Used the garam masala from the Tandoori Turkey recipe on this site and it always comes out perfectly.

salmon was incredible

Turned out excellent. I kept the marinade / puree on the salmon while grilling and scraped it off after. Served with cilantro rice and some sliced bananas on the side, just to mix it up. A Belgian style white ale (e.g. Avery White Rascal) has the right zest and lightness to go with the meal.

As previous reviewers have noted, make sure you smell/taste the garam masala before you use it to make sure one spice is not too dominant. We use a Garam Masala sold at Fresh Market and it was excellent for this recipe. Also, instead of the raita we used a citrus/Greek yogurt sauce from another Epicurious Salmon recipe. The two were fantastic together and got rave reviews from my guests.

Haven't made this yet but I am going to ... with confidence. Note to the cook from Baltimore below - maybe the particular garam masala you used was not the greatest blend. Garam masalas vary quite a lot in terms of flavors depending on how the blend was put together. When possible, I prefer to buy it in bulk so I can smell it before buying. I like a garam masala that is not too heavy on any particular spice, especially cloves.

I used Greek yogurt and a hothouse cucumber. This was absolutely wonderful. I would not change a thing.

I made this for friends and my family (which includes a 15- and 11-year old). Quick to prepare and rated excellent by all. I've made my own garam masala from a recipe in The Barbecue Bible by Steven Raichlen for other dishes, as well as this one. I also used Greek yogurt, because it typically doesn't require draining. Additionally, I used a hothouse cucumber, because it's less watery than the Lebanese variety (the most common in supermarkets). Plus, I remove the seeded core, which is much less firm than the rest of the cuke, before chopping. I served the salmon with mango segments and pita bread cut into triangles (pita is very similar to naan--the Indian flatbread--but much less expensive). At first, I tried a Viognier (fruity but dry white wine), but found it clashed with the marinade. However, a 2009 Merlot/Cabernet Franc blend matched up very well. For dessert, I served coconut cream pie.

I served this for a dinner party and got rave reviews. The garam masala was an excellent rub with the super fresh salmon filets. I also thought the raita was a nice complement to the spicer garam masala. I served the fish with lemon roasted potates green beans and sherry glazed mushrooms. I offset the spicy salmon with what I call california salad (butter lettuce, strawberries, avacado,grapes,toasted almonds and poppyseed dressing. I am making this dish again tonight. Ut was a hit.

I was so excited to make this recipe as it looked quick and easy. The Garam Masala was too strong and ruined the flavor of the dish, in my opinion. Also, the yogurt and cucumber should have been drained for an hour prior to making the raita as the sauce was runny. I may try this dish again and omit the Garam Masala and drain the yogurt and cucumber, as I love cumin and coriander.

Strange - I followed this recipe to a T and thought it was fair at best. The raita was fine, but I found the seasoning on the fish to be way too sharp. My husband and I eat Indian food very often and love Indian flavors. We do not shy away from seasoning or spiciness at all. I looked back at the recipe twice to see if I left anything out or mismeasured, but I hadn't. I used fresh ginger and measured everything carefully. The only thing I can think of is that the garam masala or the cumin in my pantry were not good/fresh. Maybe that threw the flavor off. Will ditch those spices and maybe try the recipe again.

This was outstanding. Even my husband, who is not a salmon eater, enjoyed it. I used whole-milk yogurt for the sauce and strained it for an hour before making the raita. I served it with saffron basmati rice and Indian spiced chickpeas (Tandoor Chef) from the ethnic frozen section of the grocery store. I ate the leftovers the next day.

I have made this twice now- it is fabulous. I made it exactly as is- and did not take off the marinade before grilling. The whole family loved it. Definitely a "keeper."
