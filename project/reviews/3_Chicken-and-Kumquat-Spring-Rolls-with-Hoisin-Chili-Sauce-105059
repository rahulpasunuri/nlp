Couldn't find canned Kumquats in syrup. This was great with fresh. We added peanut butter to the dipping sauce, as another reviewer suggested.

Not enough flavor

Excellent. I added a couple heaping Tbs. chunky peanut butter to the sauce with a little water to thin it and served it hot. Makes a nice contrast to the cool herb-minty rolls. I must admit that I added more chili paste but that's because I like very spicy foods.

This was ok but I wouldn't make it again as I'm not a fan of MSG filled hoisin sauce. By the way cook from Riverside - I'm Chinese and those egg rolls are AMERICAN Chinese food as in food made specifically to American tastes - they certainly don't exist over here!

It's always an adventure to try foods from another culture or part of the world (I'm Italian). One of the wonderful things about EPICURIOUS is that it provides that opportunity and it becomes a culiniary education. So, for those who were not familiar with Spring rolls, EPUCUROUS has given us all an opportunity to learn that unlike Egg Rolls, which are Chinese and fried, Spring Rolls are not either. Thank you for an inspired and exotic recipie!

I would like to make this but cannot find the kumquats in syrup in my asian market.I bought an ingredient called loquats in heavy syrup.When researching what they are,I discovered they are like apricots,and are also called japanese plums or may apples.I know apricots and kumquats are not similar in taste.Do you think these will work in this recipe?

Attention Tree: FYI, In Thailand a spring roll is rice paper and fried, what we call a fresh roll is rice paper and not fried. Egg rolls are laso fried. Check your sources.

Excellent. I prefer it without the lettuce and I used regular bean sprouts and fresh kumquats. My guests really enjoyed it as well.

The rolls are not fried. These are cold rolls similar to vietnamese cold shrimp and pork rolls.
