This was a simple recipe and loved by all my family thought it the best red gravy ever!

This is a great all around sauce recipe. I used it to make baked ziti as well as the cassoulet. It is wonderful!

I enjoyed this sauce very much. I subbed dried basil and anchovy paste, but otherwise made as directed. It was great with the cassoulet recipe, but would also be terrific for pasta and other uses.
