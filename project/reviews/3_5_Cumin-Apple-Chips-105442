Excellent taste. Before cooking these I was unsure about the combination of sugar and cumin, but man are they good! Slice the chips as thin as possible, even if you don't end up with perfectly round chips. The thinnest ones crisped up very well. Also, I baked mine for close to 2.5 hours and my oven tends to run hot.

Wonderful! I make these often in the fall, two batches at a time in double ovens. Simple with a mandolin and a silpat. Sometimes I use powdered sugar and good curry powder, sometimes powdered sugar sprinkled with sea salt, but always a sheet of the cumin. I think I'll go through my spices to see what else sounds good with apples.

I would love to know what these cumin apples chips are filled with in the photograph as I think it looks divine and would make a beautiful looking canape... editors... can you be of some help?

I got a mandoline and silpat for Christmas. Made these to try them out. Made more the very same day after husband ate the whole first batch! EASY and amusing.

if you don't have a mandolin or a really big kitchen, don't attempt this one. I tried to make these for a cocktail party, and it was too much trouble. my tiny NYC kitchen would have appriciated if i went to one of the many gourmet deli's and picked up something similar instead. it can create a big mess, and the chips are just okay. added a little paprika and they were a little tastier.

They are worth buying a Silpat for!
