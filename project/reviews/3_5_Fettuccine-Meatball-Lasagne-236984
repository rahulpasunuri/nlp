Lack of flavor in both the sauce and the meatballs. Quite disappointing for the amount of time required.

This was great. We used 2 lbs mixture of ground beef and ground pork from the farmer's market. Made the meatballs much bigger than instructed, I ended up with approximately 60. I've never made meatballs before so I can't say whether the time spent frying was worth it, but I can definitely say that they were delicious!

This was a crowd-pleaser. I doubled the entire recipe but used only 1/4 - 1/2 cup oil, still found I needed more breadcrumbs and adjusted the seasonings accordingly. I used only lean ground beef for the meatballs and baked them vs. frying. The sauce was fine. I used cottage cheese and found the filling too thick so I thinned it with white wine. I have been asked for the recipe and will definitely make it again.

This went over good with my fussy 5 year old as well as the rest of us. My husband loved it and is taking a big pan of it on his hunting trip to share with the boys. To save time making the meatballs, I rolled them fast and chucked them all on a cookie sheet and put them under the broiler for a few minutes.

Just finished making this dish an its very tasty. It can be a little time consuming with making the meatballs an frying them but its worth it youll be happy with the results I also tweaked it a lil bit i used turkey meat instead of beef an i also used regular tomato sauce instead of whole tomatoes but all in all it was worth it i suggest it to anyone

Great results. My wife made this and although the meatballs took a while to make, it was fantastic. The meatballs & fettucine noodles are what make this different, so it's worth it if you want it to stand out. It held together great and more than pleased a crowd of serious foodies.

Finally, a reasonably simple and delicious take on lasagna. I knew the meatballs would be too laborious so I simply browned the meat with everything except the egg and bread crumbs. The sauce was easy and my kids loved the bright taste of the tomatoes. The layers held together beautifully. Recently, I have been trying different lasagna recipes but almost always the outcome is not worth the labor, not so with this recipe. My entire family wants this dish again, soon.

I made this for a Valentine's dinner party and my guests went crazy. The tiny meatballs were delightful. Though it was a fair amount of work, it's worth it for a special occasion.

A nice lasagna variation, but the meatballs weren't worth the trouble. I would use Italian sausage (sauted without the casing and broken up) next time. Or you could just saute and break up the meatloaf mix as another cook suggested.

Sounded great and tasted good but it is a laborious recipe for what comes out pretty much like lasagne. Sounded like a good change of pace but given how time consuming it is, there's not enough payoff. Next time I'll go back to an old standby lasagne.

My loving hub helped with the prep of this; thankfully! I was responsible for the meatballs, and I must admit it was incredibly time consuming. We always rate our recipes after the fact, and we both agreed that nothing was gained by forming the meat mixture into meatballs. In future we sould simply brown the meat, breaking it up slightly in the pan. Ours stayed together beautifully, with distinct layers. We both agreed that the dish lacked flavour, despite adding additional herbs. Other than that, a hearty, satisfying meal for a large group!

We loved this! Certainly the concept of it was an interesting idea. I must admit I used pre-made Italian-style meatballs due to lake of time, but otherwise I followed the recipe and it was delicious and presented very well. I will definitely make this again but will add some fresh basil into the filling next time.

I agree that this is not really lasagne, and I was disappointed by the sauce. It was too "chunky" to suit me, and I will use my own homemade recipe next time. I had no more room on the stove to fry the meatballs, so I baked them in the oven and they came out great. No need for that cup of vegetable oil.

This was really great. The only changes I made were to add sauted mushrooms and add chopped fresh basil to the ricotta filling. My only gripe is I wouldn't really call this a "lasagna", more like a pasta bake, it didn't hold the layers together like a typical lasagna. But the flavors were right on. I'll make this again.
