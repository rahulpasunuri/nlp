Great stuff! Definitely agree with other reviewers who said to toast the pine nuts and add lemon zest along with skipping the steaming and boiling the asparagus, reserving water for pasta. I added the tips at the very end of the pasta cooking. Also added the cheese to the hot pasta and pesto for better melting.

Oh my gosh...so good, so easy, really fresh. I didn't measure anything, just threw a bunch of ingredients in and it worked just fine. I had precooked, pasta and cubed chicken in the freezer in which I tossed the pesto, making this dish even easier. I don't have a food processor so I just chopped away and the texture was really nice.

Yeah, it wasn't really a favorite at our place tonight. Made with the lemon zest and that quite possibly saved it. Still needed more lemon juice after serving, but even so it wasn't great. Don't think we'll be doing it again in a hurry, but it was worth a try.

A massive improvement to this recipe: add the zest of one lemon after mixing in the cheese. It brings out the flavors and brightens the dish. Makes a boring recipe into a delicious one!

I was surprised by how good this was. I also make this with grilled or sauteed chicken pieces added in. So easy and good. Changes: I used less oil than they called for and added in pasta water to thin it out instead. I wonder if roasted asparagus might be a nice change up.

Very easy and tasty. I made it with about 3/4 cups of walnuts, toasted in a skillet before adding to the asparagus, and for simplicity I boiled the asparagus and then cooked the pasta in the same water. The raw garlic in this seemed particularly sharp - you've been warned. I would make this again because it's so easy, but I would say it's good, not great.

Delicious, easy, and very fast to make. I cooked the pasta in the water that was used to steam the asparagus, and also took the advice of the person that suggested the garlic be sauted beforehand. Make this for a potluck and everyone loved it. Pine nuts are very expensive in my area so I will experiment with others that are less pricey, but I did include them in the dish and it was great!

Phenomenal! Next time I will saute the garlic for a minute. It was a little too harsh tasting as a "raw" state of garlic. I served with diced chicken (seasoned with cracked black pepper and salt). Will make again!

Grilled asparagus with some grated cheese, added more cheese and garlic. Great flavor!! Very easy!! Don't know if we can eat regular pesto now!!

Easy and delicious. My husband and 3 year-old loved it, too. I added a can of cannellini beans and some reserved asparagus tips to the pasta during the last minute of cooking. Also only used 1/4 c. olive oil. Great weeknight dinner!

I think the reviewers who say this tastes bland need to use good parmesan cheese, in-season asparagus, and a little more salt. Also, don't over-process the asparagus -- follow the directions and leave it a little chunky.

Really good! Actually, so good that my husband went out of his way to come to the kitchen to comment on how great it smelled. I also added chicken to it seasoned with the pesto. Gave it 3 forks only because my hubby said it smells better than it tastes (very subtle taste, not bad at alll, though).

I was looking for a low fat, no cream, pasta/ asparagus recipe and this fit the bill! An excellent use of spring asparagus.

I roasted the asparagus and pine nuts, used less oil, and added diced herbed chicken and a few whole aparagus spears. I also served the sauce on spicy sesame linguine, which added some nice flavor. With the chicken and spears, it was very pretty and my husband loved it.

I added italian sausage and this was excellent!!

Was really disappointed with this one--I LOVE asparagus in any form and also love pesto, but found this to be bitter and bland--a waste of good asparagus and parmesan. My children (3 1/2, 1 1/2) loved it, and my husband thought it was okay, but there's much better out there...

If you have asparagus only once or twice a year, maybe this isn't the recipe for you. But it is delicious, albeit without a recognizable asparagus flavor. I reserved the tips and half of the pine nuts (toasted) to add at the end.

I thought it was great, and so easy! but my family didn't finish it. Oh well, so much more leftovers for me!

Very easy and enjoyed by all, even kids. Added slices of smoked salmon.

Toast the pine nuts before pureeing. Also, keep some of the nuts aside and add to the pasta when tossing, it adds another dimension to the texture. A good deal of black pepper and a squeeze of fresh lemon perks it up. This is a great dinner party dish.

This is an excellent recipe for asparagus lovers! I puree the stalks and leave the asparagus tips whole...works great!

This recipe does need some additions. I use one less garlic clove and I add 2-3 tablespoons of fresh basil and some chopped red pepper.

Unappealing texture and little flavor. Ate one serving, but didn't save the leftovers.

Tasty, but I agree with another reviewer - save the asparagus for another dish and make a fabulous basil pesto.

This was so delicious, and easy as well!!! I added the zest of 3/4 of a lemon and some coked chicken. I also added some extra pine nuts after I put everyting in the food processor, and I reserved the tips to add to the pasta. my husband commented several times about how good it was.

The asparagus-purist me should have spoken louder to the always-eager-to-try-a-new-recipe me. What a waste of good asparagus. I would much rather have eaten traditional pesto and saved the asparagus to be savored by itself. This lacked a defining flavor and was quite disappointing overall.

This was great, low fat and incredibly easy. I modified it for 2 people and it was still a ton of sauce. I cut down the oil alot and the cheese. I also added in some left over chopped roasted red peppers and added the steamed asparagus tips to the pasta instead of blending into the pesto. This was rich and creamy and we definately did not miss any of the fat!

Excellent! I was slightly wary of this recipe, but it turned out great. Very creamy, though the taste is not as stong as a typical pesto sauce.

Very good and easy. I toasted the pine nuts, used more garlic and less cheese.

I found that the amount of pesto that this recipe generated was more than enough for the penne, so I saved some for later use. Also, I did not have any pine nuts in the house, so substituted slivered almonds instead. Lastly, using 1/3 C parmesan and 1/3 C grated provolone enhanced the flavor tremendously!

Very good with pasta. We used the leftover pesto to make pizza the next night and liked that even better.

This is a lovely and healthy spring dish that we enjoyed very much. It has a wonderful balance of flavors, and I think it would appeal even to those who are not asparagus lovers. We compared it favorably to the delicious pasta we ate in Italy.

This was terrific! On the advice of another reviewer, I too reserved the asparagus tips and added them at the end. I also found that this recipe is excellent with almonds (instead of pine nuts).

This was excellent. I served it with grilled veal chops. Very easy to make especially if you microwave the asparagus.

Really good recipe; to make it even better do not process the asparagus tips in the pesto--save them to toss with the pasta.

Absolutely easy and scrumptuos. AS a counterpoint, I served this with sliced cherry tomatoes
