We made it as described. The lettuce was great-a terrific alchemy! We made it for a large group and everyone had seconds.

Sorry to be the dissenter here, but this was downright awful. Perhaps I did something wrong, but the lettuce turned a sickly yellow-green, and didn't add anything other than visual distraction. The garlic oil, scallions and chix broth also added no flavor at all - it just tasted like plain peas.

We love peas. This recipe is good, but it IS odd that it's meant for 2 servings for holiday meals. I also add a small sprinkle of sugar, AND adding 1/2T or so of tarragon makes it superb.

I love this recipe! Very easy, and makes an elegant side for any roasted meat.

Nice, simple pea recipe. But how very odd (lazy?) for epicurious to rerun a recipe that serves TWO under a 'christmas feast' feature, where everything else is meant to serve 8-10. I don't mind doing the math, but sheesh!

I've made peas in this fashion for years except for the garlic infused oil (which I will use this time)My recipe calls for a "sprinkle of sugar" over the lettuce as it wilts. I'm always asked what I did to make the peas taste so special. Be sure to use only the smallest peas you can find.
