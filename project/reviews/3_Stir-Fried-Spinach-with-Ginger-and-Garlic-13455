My wife thought this was fabulouse. I thought it was very good considering that the most I had to work was to wash the Spinache. The dish is O.K. I wouldn't run my kitchen around it.

I made this tonight along with my rack of lamb. I didn't have fresh ginger so I used powder. It was good but would have been better had I used the fresh ginger. Someone mentionted that it tasted bitter....if you burn the garlic it will be bitter. I did not have that problem.

I made this and thought it was great! I used fresh spinach and added a few drops of sesame oil as suggested by another reviewer. Quick, easy and delicious.

Totally tasteless. I wonder how a 10 oz. bag of spinach totals 1 1/4 pound? The math is as bad as the recipe.

Uninteresting.

This was a very good recipe, however i added a little something to it. I added toasted sesame seeds, and i used sesame oil instead of the vegitable oil. I feel that this added a bit more flavour. And well... i am quite a fan of sesame so :)

What a wonderful way to cook spinach and so fast and easy. Went very well with Kung Pao Beef and jasmine rice. I did not want to share it!!!

This is one of those recipes that will get reused over and over in my house, because of its taste and its simplicity. Made it for my husband and preschoolers tonight and they were asking for more! Very tasty and took no more than 5 minutes to cook.

Quick and easy! I used a bag of fresh, washed baby spinach and the entire dish took about 5 minutes to make. Added a splash of rice wine vinegar at the end to zest it up. Yummy!

I found this dish to be bitter and bland at the same time. Yuk!

This was very good! Had with Rack of Lamb with Caramelized Shallot & Thyme Crust, and Gruyere Potato Gratin. Great dinner - fit for a king.

I love spinach, garlic and ginger, so this was a treat. Next time I am going to use sesame oil for that extra flavour. This recipe is easy with ample portions.

Nice, simple, fast way to prepare spinach. I like the Asian flare of the dish.
