I hadn't made these in many years, but had brought them to many parties in the past. I brought them to another party again last night and they were as big a hit as always! I highly recommend them! I do agree with being careful not to overbake the crust.

Really bad. What a total waste of money and food. WIll be headed for the garbage this morning.

This recipe is my all-time favorite. I've made it for years and it's always a hit. When you make the crust, take it out just when the crust begins to golden around the edge. It's much better if you almost undercook the crust. Give the bars some time to rest (a couple of hours at least) before serving (they will fall apart otherwise). A PHENOMENAL recipe!

A definite winner! Well-balanced flavors, not too sweet. Using a food processor for the crust definitely makes a difference. Did not change a thing.

Don't know what happened here. The crust is too soft yet also crumbly; probably not cooked long enough. The topping is too gooey. Of course I ate them all because it has chocolate, nuts and TONS of butter. Silver Palate has an easier and better recipe.

I made these bars for a brunch, and they were an instant hit. Additionally, they are my husband's favorite treat!

I thought these were very dry and crumbly. Perhaps I overbaked them, but I just wasn't impressed. Next time I will make Nestle Toll House Bars with Pecans and it will be a lot less trouble.

Great recipe for a BBQ or pot-luck. These bars are fast and easy to make and are quick to disappear!

These pecan bars have a shortbread-like bottom layer that provides a lovely contrast to the chocolate and nut topping. They were a tremendous hit with my friends (including one who is a pastry chef).

Scrumptious! Recipe always requested when people taste them. I cut into bite size squares and freeze. When I have a sweet craving I just pop one into the microwave and enjoy a delicious snack!!
