Successfully doubled the recipe for a Christmas cookie exchange; just took the first batch out of the oven. I followed the recipe exactly as written except that, since my store was out of vanilla bean, I mixed good quality vanilla extract in with the egg whites (about 1/4 tsp. per batch), and it is fine. More than fine--absolutely delicious! I toasted my coconut and browned and ground my almonds the night before, and this made the mixing and baking part quick and easy today. Can't wait to taste them once dipped in the chocolate (melted Ghiradelli Bittersweet Chips). A relatively simple yet very sophisticated little cookie.

Boy, were these easy and good. I made changes, like everyone: used 3/4 cups sugar, which was plenty, and used unsweetened coconut instead of sweetened. I can't imagine how sweet these would taste with 1-1/3 cups sugar! I used 4 ounces of bittersweet chocolate for dipping. Also, I set the oven to convection baking at 300 degrees and used parchment paper. That worked very well. After dipping, I set the macaroons on a foil-lined tray and put them in the frig. When cold, they came right off the foil. Next time, I'm going to add some finely chopped dry cranberries, an idea I picked up from a different recipe.

I was looking for a good macaroon recipe and this one rocks. I took the advice of previous reviewers and cut the sugar down to a cup; I think we over sugar everything in this country and it's really unnecessary. By cutting it back, it brought out the delicate flavors. These are fabulous; this recipe's a keeper.

By reducing the sugar, it allowed the flavors to come through and made you want to keep eating them. This one's a keeper.

The batter smelled just heavenly as I was folding the coconut into the eggwhites. I used 3/4 of a cup of sugar instead of 1 1/3, and omitted the almonds. I think with the less-sweet coconut centers, using semisweet chocolate becomes more necessary. These are incredibly soft and moist; a great recipe!

keep in mind that egg white is a key ingredient here - the parchment paper is a must. I had to do without it and convincing the macaroons to come off the pan was almost impossible.

Used 1 cup, maybe a bit less, of sugar because of some warning. I made them a bit larger too so it just made about 25 macaroons, probably took more like 35 minutes to bake at the larger size. these are absolutely amazing and are just like how my favorite bakery does them.

These were gorgeous. A little crispness on the outside, fluffy and soft inside. I did reduce the sugar to 3/4 c. as so many said they were too sweet, then used a regular good dark chocolate bar outside. Mine were done in 25 min- but with convection on.

I've made these several times. Tonight, they came out flat. I wonder if it is because I did not beat the egg whites long enough. They still taste good!

Never thought that I would say that something is too sweet, but these were, even without the chocolate. The truth of the metter is that I didn't like them enough to even bother with the chocolate. I would have liked a more chewy, moist macaroon. Will not serve these or make these again

I made these for a Christmas cookie exchange - they were fantastic and so easy. I used vanilla as I could not find a vanilla bean. I needed more chocolate for dipping and the recipe did not make 5 dozen. I have made them many times since and always get raves.

We loved these and I am sure I will make them again. I tweaked the recipe as follows: - add a bit of salt - I used vanilla sugar instead of sugar + bean, and it was just fine - I rather than dipping the bottoms, I dipped the sides to about 1/2 way. Voila -- Passover black and white cookies! I made them bigger (and fewer) to achieve the effect, but there were still plenty. I can also tell you that these freeze great.

I will make these again and again. I liked the chocolate drizzled over the top idea and baked them for atleast 35 minutes. Yummy

I love these. I would call them merangues not cookies. Aside from that, my daughter said they are bland looking. I agreed and decided to drizzle chocolate on top in a crisscross pattern. they look quite appetizing now. Try them. Great taste yet not over th4e top.

I was looking for a good coconut macaroon recipe and a number of highly-rated ones include flaked coconut and only use the egg white as a binder. I tried one of those but THIS is the kind of coconut macaroon I remember and love, and amazingly so does my 15-month-old (yes, MONTH) toddler. I made them plain without the chocolate and 25 minutes cooking time was fine. The only thing is, I tried piping them into rosettes but after a little while they got VERY diffitult to force through the tip, so gave up and dropped spoonsful on the tray.

This recipe is fantastic. I've made it several times now and it is always a hit. My husband is alergic to nuts so I always substitute a cup or so of whatever dried fruit I have on hand, dried cranberries, cherries, currants etc and they are always delicious!

These macaroons are delicious. They are chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside. I use more chocolate than recommended on the recipe.

This was my first time making macaroons, and I made them for our seder last night - they were a hit with everyone. I reduced the sugar to a little less than 1 cup and used more coconut - around 5 cups. I couldn't find long shred, but it didn't seem to make much of a difference. I will certainly be making these again, and again, and again....

Love this macaroon recipe! I only used 1 cup sugar and still found them a bit too sweet. Will use less sugar next time.

These are AMAZING! I couldn't find the long-shread coconut, but the more finely grated stuff worked just fine. I will definitely make these again!

In fact, macaroons are most traditionally a French cookie that is made with ground almonds, not the coconut meringue with which most of us (including me) grew up.

These cookies are easy to make and a good way to use up left over egg whites. They also make a nice presentation as they are dramatically delicious looking. I did not use the vanilla bean...as I did not have any. I'm sure it would have improved the flavor but they were delicious without it.

My guests absolutely loved this recipe. I halved the recipe and there were plenty although I could have made the full recipe to have more leftovers. Because I don't have a double boiler, I melted the chopped chocolate in the microwave and that worked fine. Like others, I also cooked these for about an extra 10 mins. Highly recommended ... very easy.

I'm basing my ratings on my 17-year-old son's opinion, because I will not eat anything made with coconut! I just made these for Passover (I haven't even had a chance to dip them in the melted chocolate yet). My son says that they are wonderful! I decided to jazz them up a bit by adding a couple of handfuls of mini chocolate chips along with the ground almonds. He says that he likes them just as they are, but still wants me to dip them. After all, can you ever have enough chocolate? These took about an extra 10 minutes to bake, but I wouldn't raise the oven temperature, because I'm afraid the bottoms would burn.

Absolutely delicious and easy easy! One question is why mine took so much longer than 25 minutes. I can't help but wonder if 275 degrees isn't a bit too low? I didn't have vanilla beans, so I used some extract and had to use sweetened coconut so I cut the sugar to 2/3 cup. Fabulous!

Didn't have vanilla bean, used 1/2 tsp extract, also didn't want almonds (kids don't like!) but put in 1/8 tsp extract. Used Silpat, and cooled directly on rack (not cookies sheet on rack) and worked just fine. Easy recipe and great results!

Well-meaning note to Jackie: Macaroons ARE coconut meringue cookies. These were quite nice.

Awesome and easy to make.

Taste and look more like coconut meringue than anything else but still good! But I was expecting MACAROONS so quite disappointed with this recipe.

I made these from the magazine. The picture is so beautiful, I had to try them. As my sister said, these are better than candy. One co-worker, who doesn't like coconut, went back for another. They are not difficult and make a beautiful presentation. I couldn't find unsweetened coconut, so I cut the sugar back to 1/2 - 2/3 cup and it worked great. Mmmmmm....

These macaroons were wonderful. I didn't have a vanilla bean, so I added about 1/2 tsp of extract to the stiff egg whites. Since the grocery store only had sweetened coconut, I cut the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup. I got rave reviews from my in-laws. Will make again!

I loved these! I didn't use the ground almonds because I didn't have them on hand. I used Valhrona chocolate (bittersweet for dipping. The quality of the chocolate mixed with the light chewiness of this cookie, was heavenly. I liked these much better than the ones I had had Manichevitz) at Passover seders. Viewing other macaroon recipes, I realized that the egg whites are usually not beaten, but just mixed in with coconut as a binder.
