This is amazing! I have made it a few times and it is always a winner. A few tips on the sauce - I always make it earlier in the day or the day before (it's a bit messy and not something you want going when guests arrive). It takes A LOT longer for the final reduction than the recipe states (more like 30-40 minutes). Be patient and work with the consistency rather than the times noted. I also tend to use more mushrooms and home-made stock or concentrate the canned stuff a bit. This sauce is totally worth the effort, but requires planning. The creamed spinach is light - more like a cream coating than dense, heavy creamed spinach. I do halfed-fingerling potatoes tossed in truffle oil and truffle salt, then roast them in the oven. The beef is easy and fool-proof. I salt the meat the night before. After bringing to room temperature, I use a blow-torch to completely sear the meat before it goes into the oven (a Thomas Keller trick for prime rib - also a winner).

i just made the sauce and beef. the sauce was good, a bit runny. there is no need to double the recipe - it makes enough for 6 easily if not more.

So many people raved about the sauce... but I found it insipid... despite two bottles of red wine!! I served this for Christmas dinner. Since I was serving 12, I needed to double the ingredients. It killed me to open up two nice bottles of Pinot Noir, especially when the end result wasn't all that great. Followed the directions to a T, but the end results was watery and just so so. I think a bearnaise sauce would have served me much better!!

This is an absolutely outstanding recipe. Something I & my husband will rave about for a long time. I shopped for the beef tenderloin at Whole Foods and ended up with the tenderloin that they cut the filet mignons from. An incredible cut of meat - obviously key to this recipe. The red wine sauce turned out great and wasn't too time consuming to make. Didn't make the truffled fries, served with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus. Delish!

The red wine sauce is amazing! I made this for my husband's birthday. We ended up eating at midnight--the sauce takes a while, but it's worth it. Next time if I do this on a weeknight, I'll prep the sauce the night before. We ate it with mashed potatoes instead of fries. Great meal to impress...anyone!

I followed the resipe almost exactly and it turned out wonderfully. It is very expensive and time consuming but worth it. I made for a dinner party and everyone raved about it for weeks.

I've made this dish several times. It never ceases to amaze! I'm hosting a dinner party tomorrow night and these recipes are the foundation of the meal! I typically halve the sauce because otherwise there's a lot leftover (and I hate leftovers). I also add some onion to the recipe (a quarter cup in my halved product) and a couple diced garlic cloves. Additionally, I cook the tenderloin in a 500 degree oven for 22 minutes - a technique I got from epicurious...

This was a huge hit at my last dinner party. The meat was amazingly tender and sauce a fabulous compliment. Can't wait to make again.

Ok. This was good. This is really good. Used steaks and halved the recipe so it was only for two. The wine sauce was incredible. Creamed spinach, /especially/ for only having _2_ ingredients, was outstanding. I'll do the whole kit again and again. Easy enough for a week night yet amazing enough for impressing the boss's boss.

This is for the creamed spinach recipe. it was wonderful! the spinach is so fresh (becuase it is fresh) and it was the easiest thing I ever made...great band for the time...I followed the amounts and had enough for 10 people.

I made this sauce to serve with beef tenderloin and it was a big hit. I used a merlot and the sause smell didn't agree with me...I served it as a side with the beef and everyone used and and loved it...the next day, we made steak sandwiches with left over beef and every wanted the sauce on it..so I guess they meant it. next time I'll try a different wine and maybe decrease the viniger. I never did try it.

I'm giving four forks and a standing ovation for the Red Wine Sauce, which was extraordinary! I made beef trenderloin and served it with the sauce, and it was very flavorful and rich. It does take a lot of time to make, but it was so worth it. -- I doubled the recipe (mainly because I was fearful I wouldn't have enough or that I'd mess it up). To the contrary, it was perfect (a big accomplishment for me and reduction sauces), and my double batch served 8 generously, with a good cup of leftovers. It has kept well in the refrig. (don't know how it would freeze), and I used it on pork chops and another filet. Scrumptious!

I have been making this recipe for a few years. It is probably THE best meal I make. I still have not made the fries though!

Wow, just made this for Christmas dinner and the red wine sauce was out of this world! I will say that it was too thin at the end (as mentioned by some previous reviewers) and I had to use a cornstarch slurry and additional reduction time to get it to the correct consistency. The only change I made was to add some finely chopped garlic to the mushroom and shallot saute. I think that the second 'simmer' should probably be a reduction by boiling because I ended up with much more than the 1 1/2 cups in the recipe. However, the flavor was outstanding and we were dipping everything in it! Yumm! The beef is a no brainer as is the spinach and we didn't make the truffled fries. A great sauce recipe, put it in your box!

Oh yes the sauce. It is now my go to recipe for sauce for tenderloin steaks that we have for Christmas dinner. Maybe some day I will try the rest but that sauce is fabulous.

Like everyone else, we loved this sauce! The only thing I would do different next time is less sugar. The shallots have such a nice sweetness, I don't think sugar is needed. We used a $12 bottle of cab sav and it had a wonderful flavor.

The sauce is liquid gold. So good! The creamed spinach is great too. I didn't do the fries, I used organic fingerling potatoes instead.. just a little olive oil, salt and pepper and placed them cut side down on the baking sheet to get them nice and crispy, you can't get a better potato then that! LOVE this recipe, this sauce is going on my permanent menu for my catering business.

I only made the sauce from this recipe and if I could give it 5 forks, I would. For me, it was a lot of work for 1.5 cups of sauce, but it was SO worth it. We had it with a tenderloin that we grilled and a different creamed spinach recipe. It is the perfect sauce for this meal. I didn't have a Pinot that we wanted to make a sauce out of and used a $12 Cab instead and I would do the same next time. Great sauce recipe!

I made only the beef and wine portion of recipe and it was such a hit Christmas day. The whole bottle of wine seems excessive but it cooks down and is fine! My kids LOVED it on their mashed potatoes. One thing that really added to the sauce was pouring the juice from filet pan right into the sauce at the end - added incredible flavor. My sister e-mailed me again today to rave about this!

I noticed the photo with the recipe does not show creamed spinach. I loved the recipe including the truffled French fries. I especially liked and found helpful the quantitative and qualitative directions in the preparation section of the red wine sauce. It helped me a great deal to know I was to end up with a little more than a cup of sauce. About the truffle oil, what I found was "truffle oil" made from grapeseed oil and truffle flavor ($17 per pint). Anyone find something else? Also I used a $22 Napa Pinot Noir, and a Napa red wine vinegar with the sauce. One more: sliced mushrooms. Just any ol mushroom will do? Thank you for the recipe!

Rating: 4
Always a hit. As others have mentioned make the sauce ahead of time (it is actually better if it sits) and then it is a breeze to serve. I used twice baked potatoes rather than the fries for a more elegant side that is also made ahead of time.

Rating: 4
To pdoering: Try adding some of the pan juices after you roast the tenderloin. I always make the sauce at least a day ahead - adding pan juices if it's too thick upon reheating makes the flavor of the sauce extra complex and delicious.

I just made this sauce and it reduced too much. It's about 1/4 cup shy of what it should be. Does anyone have a suggestion what I should do to get the additional 1/4c back? Right now it's a bit on the thick side.

Rating: 4
I believe my husband's comment was "I fell in love with you again tonight!". A definite winner. The sauce takes a lot of time, but well worth it. We bypassed the creamed spinach, but had it with a spinach & strawberry salad and baked potatoes. I was also unable to find fresh thyme (we live in a small town), and just added some dried. Delicious! will definitely be making this for company.

Rating: 4
I am a huge fan of this recipe. Being able to make the sauce a day ahead of time reduces stress dramatically. The fact you don't use pan drippings is what makes that possible. Note: As a variation, I take two bottles of port and reduce them using a heat diffuser so the port never actually boils. (Same when I reduce balsamic.) When the port is reduced in half, I then reduce it a second time per the recipe. Also, I've found I need to double the butter/flour mix to get the sauce to a velvety consistency.

This has become my favourite beef tenderloin recipe. I have made it for several dinner parties and people literally lap up the sauce! I usually make the sauce in the morning so that I can focus on my guests. Believe me, this recipe is worth it!

The sauce is excellent. Well worth the effort. Takes time and patience to properly reduce, but guests loved it. As with other reviews, my sauce required a bit more effort to thicken. Made 24 hours ahead and tasted divine.

You MUST make this sauce the day before. The difference in flavor is striking. I recommend adding 2 tsp cornstarch (dissolved in a bit of cold water) while reheating the sauce to make it velvety, but not too thick.

outstanding sauce -- everyone from the 3-year old through my husband mopped it up. I used all beef broth (no chicken) and did not strain the shallots out.

I made the sauce a day before to save some time on Christmas. Used a large onion because I was out of shallots and skipped the mushrooms. I sauteed those on the side to make them golden and crispy. The sauce was amazing and served as wonderful compliment to the perfectly cooked meat. Served with lyonnaise potatoes and roasted asparagus. Rave reviews for the first Christmas at our place.

Rating: 4
Excellent sauce - a real hit with my husband and in-laws! Replaced the shallots with 1 large onion, the red wine vinegar with white balsamic, and the chicken broth with beef broth - very rich flavour. Also, doubled the recipe so that I would have some extra to reheat the leftover beef tenderloin in the next day. Finally, added water/cornstarch mixture to thicken it as I found the consistency too watery. Recommendation: make the day before you are planning to serve - the flavours are more intense after sitting 24 hours...

I made the beef and sauce for dinner guests and it was a hit. I had an interesting experience making the sauce. When I added the wine and it said to boil until reduced by half for 20 minutes I set the timer and was busy with other tasks nearby but I was not watching the pan. In about 15 minutes all the wine had boiled away. I caught it right before everything started to burn. In a panice I threw in the contenets of a leftover half bottle and brought it back to a boil and went on from there. I was on pins and needles until it was done. Luckily it came out great. I have never had a sauce that tasted like that. What one of the other reviewers said was true. DON'T taste it until its done. In fact, I made mine the night before and when reheating to serve the smell and flavor was divine. I have to say that beef tenderloin is not my favorite cut of beef. I am saving the last of my sauce for the next time I grill steak.

I just made the tenderloin and wine sauce as an appetizer for a dinner party. The wine sauce is a divine layered flavour that just knocked 'em dead. It's a little difficult to measure the reductions. Don't be afraid to tip the lot into a measuring cup to check. It makes a difference.

I made the tenderloin and red wine sauce as an appetizer for my annual Christmas dinner. Turns out, it's one of the best sauces I've ever tasted, incredibly rich, layered and perfectly paired with a tender cut of beef. The only error I made was in serving a Cabernet Sauvignon with it. I plead ignorance, I like whites.

Not only was I impressed, my family was overwhelmed at the flavor and quality of the meal. As a precaution I bought an organic tenderloin at Central Market in Fort Worth and used all organic ingredients. What a difference! The sauce was amazing! It should have it's own name. Sauces are always under appreciated. This sauce makes the meal. I recommend this recipe to seasoned chefs and beginners. I will use it again when I need to impress. A big thanks from all of us.

I am im love with this recipe. My husband and I have eaten at a Michael Mina steakhouse before so I recognized his name. I made this for an intimate corporate dinner party at my home. It was to die for!! I followed the recipe exactly and like most of you suggested I let it reduce for much longer than five minutes. I would say thirty minutes or so. When this sauce was done it fit in a small gravy boat but it was so flavorful that you didn't need a lot. I strained the sauce and I think you should so that it is velvety smooth. This is an expensive sauce to make but one that I will probably make everytime I roast a tenderloin for a special occassion! Thanks to everyone for sharing their tips on this one!!!

I could not bring myself to strain this sauce. I served it heaped atop the tenderloin (just substitute ground pepper for the peppercorns and strip the thyme leaves off the woody stems). Mashed potatoes, roasted slender asparagus, and candlelight...sooooo good...perfect for a rainy fall night!

Made the sauce and tenderloin for some very special friends. SPLENDID!!!! We all agreed that this recipe goes to the top of the class! I will make this whenever I really want to "wow" my guests! I followed the sauce instructions to a tee, but agree that the broth reduction step took longer than 35 minutes -- I think more like over an hour.... We grilled the tenderloin after patting it down with a generous sprinkling of Montreal steak seasoning. YUMMM! Served the sauce with the beef, and made the Mashed Potatoes with Crimini Mushrooms recipe found on this site also (another winner!!).

I made this dish for my husband's 46th birthday, with two of our best friends in attendance. All four of us agreed that it was probably the BEST DISH WE HAVE EVER HAD! Now that says alot! The sauce was like velvet. A few things I did different were: After searing the meat, I coated it in a mixture of equal parts(4Tbs each), of dijon mustard, olive oil, chopped fesh thyme, and rosemary. I added about 8-10 juniper berries to the sauce along with the peppercorns. I made a far superior creamed spinach. It was the recipe for "Creamed Spinach Deluxe" on epicurious.

Rave reviews on the beef and sauce! I'm surprised by other reviewers saying the sauce is too sweet, or that they can taste vinegar etc. I just followed the recipe exactly, and found it was wonderful. Maybe they rushed and didn't reduce it enough?? I did need to cook the last stage of the reduction quite a bit longer than the 5 mins suggested by the recipe - I just kept going until I had the the 1.25 cups final volume that the recipe called for, and that turned out perfectly from a flavor standpoint. A little sauce does go a long way, so freeze your leftover sauce for next time! If you want a little more flavor on the outside of the beef, try searing it in bacon drippings (by frying up about 4 strips of bacon first). Definitely use the meat thermometer to determine doneness, as cooking time can vary significantly depending on the size of your tenderloin. My 4 pound loin took over an hour, but was perfectly medium-rare at 120 degrees. Can't wait to make this again.

This dish is fine for adults. The adults will eat it in a jiffy because their tastebuds are much more refined than the children we now raise so spoiled. My daughter wouldn't even bat an eye at it. Of course, I shouldn't have been giving her a dish with wine sauce, but I was a young mom who couldn't help herself back then. My new husband is an excellent chef, and he agrees that this delicacy is for an adult-only household.

I made the sauce only...and in response to one reviewers question, YES you can freeze it. The recipe makes ALOT so I froze 1/2 of it and 4 months later, it was still excellent--just warmed it on the stove. It is so labor intensive, I for one am glad to know it can be made ahead (way ahead) of time. Hope this helps.

I'm rating only the red wine sauce. DO NOT make this sauce, it's way too sweet. I followed it exactly, wondering what would happen with 2tbsp of sugar in there in the end, and it's very very sweet. A waste of nice ingredients and time. I think you could make it and leave out the sugar, and while you're at it, the vinegar too, and it would probably be good. Trust me, I've made a red wine sauce or two and this tastes like dessert it so sweet.

My husband made the sauce for our beef tenderloin on Christmas Day and frankly, it was horrible. No matter how long we cooked it, all we could taste was vinegar and sugar, so we threw it out. It was a waste of good ingredients. Why does a sauce for red meat need sugar in it anyway???

I was a little iffy about it at first because of the vinegar and sugar; before it's done reducing it has a strange taste and I was worried that it would spoil the meal, but by the end it was fabulous. Deffo will make again for a special occasion (tenderloin roasts are not in my weekly budget!)

OK, I really wanted to make this last night. We had left over tournadoes from my birthday and all of a sudden had invited a couple of friends to finish off the beef with us. I looked over the recipe and figured that I had about half of the ingredients and that I could substitute for the rest. The results were rave reviews from my friends. Here is what I did. Sauteed leeks and fresh garlic, added the sugar and redwine vinegar, about 1/2 a bottle of wine, chicken stock (don't laugh at this...kitchen bouquet and worcestershire instead of beef stock) ground thyme, white pepper, peppercorns, etc. It came out beautifully and was a wonderful accompaniment to the beef, which I sauteed in butter with bacon strips.
