Excellent! No need to core the tomatoes.

This sauce is wonderful! A versatile sauce that could be used for pizza, eggplant parmesan, green beans, salmon oreganata, etc.......I made a huge batch and froze it in small containers. Pulled one out this evening for the eggplant parm and it was so good!

Nice basic sauce. Way better tasting than canned and easy to make. Since fresh tomatoes aren't tasty yet around here, I used high-quality canned plum tomatoes and it produced a decent result.
