one cook talked about cider vinegar, this was a mistake. the recipe calls for apple cider and i suspect some of the failures made the same mistake. i substitute a carrot for the potato and used chopped fresh ginger and some curry powder when i sauteed the onions.insead of heavy cream i use greek yogurt dollops. i havent tried the fried parsnip garnish yet but will, i leave out the parsley i use the same recipe for a delicious butternut squash soup.

This was great - we will definitely have this on the menu again. I hate when reviewers do this, but here I go: I didn't actually make it according to the recipe. Sorry! I just put an apple in the soup instead of the cider and added a small celeriac (celery root) we had laying around. With some good bread and a side of kale, it was a satisfying but not-too-heavy pre-Thanksgiving meal. The recipe strikes a good balance between comfort food and something a little unusual.

Used Granny Smith Apples freshly juiced and 2 TBs of Apple Cider vinegar instead of Apple Cider Used only 2 TB butter and one slice of pepper bacon to saute veggies. Removed bacon before processing and discard. Used chix broth to keep the veggies hydrated while cooking. Used 1/2 sweet potato and 1/2 white potato Deleted Parsley altogether Used Vitamix blender to puree and it was smooth as velvet. Served with my signature baked sourdough bowls and received rave review from all.

Nice, unusual soup. I think it would make an excellent and elegant first course, but it was a bit strongly flavored as a main course.

Loved! And I didn't even have time to add the fried parsnip. Just a lovely creamy texture and depth of flavor. I'm sure the topping would have added some visual points- pureed parsnip soups unadorned are not the prettiest things.

I had great success with this recipe. I did make some substitutions, some due to necessity some in response to other reviews. I left out the potato - had none - instead I added an extra parsnip and two smallish carrots. This may have helped with the thickness others complained of. I used organic apple juice, but to counter the sweetness I added 1-2 tsp of apple cider vinegar. Lastly, I used only 3 tbsp of butter and one tbsp of olive oil to cook the vegetables. Also I subbed 1/2 a cup each of half and half and plain yogurt for the heavy cream - it's what I had available and it cut the fat. Like I said, a lot of subs, but it turned out great and very apple-y parsnip-y. I DID make the fried parsnip topping. It wasn't too difficult and it's really quite tasty.

Yuck. The end result was sweet and the consistency of library paste. A waste of my good homemade chicken stock and expensive heavy cream.

delicious and different...i used 2 gala apples in place of the cider and left out the cream, so i needed more broth/water, but it had a really nice savory taste. you couldn't really taste the apple - i might try granny smiths next time - but the parsnip taste was nice.

This is a great soup, and easy to make. I didn't make the fried parsnip, just had some nice bread with the soup. The finished product was missing something. It needed some acidity to offset the sweetness. I added some cherry vinegar at the blending stage. I also mixed some sour cream with a little lemon juice and zest to garnish the top of the soup and sprinkled some left over chopped parsely.

Very nice flavor. I added 1/2 of a sweet potato and 1/2 potato, used onions instead of shallots and used milk instead of cream. It was wonderful but a bit thick. I used additional c.broth to thin it out. Overall - this recipe is a keeper

Very rich and flavorful soup. I used half & half instead of heavy cream and if making it again I would use milk or maybe skim milk. Tasty and easy to make.

I must have done something horribly wrong, but I can't figure out what it is. I made the soup pretty close to the directions, substituting tart apples for the juice or cider as other reviewers suggested. What I ended up with was unedible and I had to dump the whole pot. (And by the way, I had way more than 4 cups - from the list of ingredients I suspected it would make a full pot, and it certainly did.) I love all the ingredients, I eat parsnips in other things and love them, so I'm sure it's not being unfamiliar with what a parsnip tastes like. Maybe I had a bitter parsnip? It smelled good while cooking, but after one half of a mug full, I knew it was awful and couldn't be served. I have had so much good luck with recipes from this site, so I am at a loss.

I've always loved making squash soups for Thanksgiving but this year I thought I would try something different and this one sure was a hit. I went full bull and garnished with fried parsnip strips and poached apple slices. This made a nice presentation in an heirloom tureen. The flavors of this soup are unique and complex even without any spices in the ingredients. I served this soup as a starter for our Thanksgiving dinner and half way thru my bowl I realized the soup was so rich and good that I wondered why we needed anything else on the menu! Given that, I would agree that maybe whole milk or half and half would make an acceptable alternative to the heavy cream in the recipe especially if the soup is the starter to a large feast. But this soup as prescribed here with appropriate salad and bread can surely be a meal in itself.

I twice blended this for a smoother texture. Topped with cripy pancetta instead of the fried parsnip. I thinned it out with broth when reheating and it comfortably fed five as a starter. Lovely flavour with the cider.

I ended up modifying this recipe quite a bit - substituted two tart macintosh apples for the juice, used about a cup and a half of cabbage instead of leek, and because I had a guest who was lactose intolerant, left out the cream, using a bit more broth to thin it out. It was delicious! I wish I had made more. I would like to try the creamy version sometime.

Amazing soup. Made it for company and everyone really enjoyed this soup and went back for more. There were a couple modifications per other reviews and I doubled the recipe  turned out great. I first cooked bacon and used the fat for cooking the vegetables before adding the broth. I put the bacon aside for later. I used milk instead of cream, but you would have thought it had cream in it. I also used the cider and really enjoyed the tartness it added. When all was done I used the bacon, cut into bits, and went with the fried parsnips. It was a beautiful presentation and everything can be done an hour or two before any guests arrive, just keep the soup warm. The soup taste great even when chilled and reheated.

I love to try new soups and new flavors, which is why this caught my eye. Made it tonight for dinner with a friend and was so pleased. Was a great combination of flavors, unexpected, and a great start to the meal. I would make it again, I made it with apple juice and I can see how cider would also be good. Followed the recipe, just in greater volume, and thought it was delicious.

This was good, but next time I'll take better care to smooth it down to the right consistency. It was more like a slightly gritty applesauce than soup. Part of the reason is that I used pureed apple instead of juice, and part may be because I didn't cook the leek, potato and parsnip long enough.

This is good as is but next time I'll make some adjustments. I will use a Granny Smith apple instead of apple juice, which I found too sweet since the parsnips already have a natural sweetness. Perhaps I'll add some dry white wine. Another parsnip soup recipe suggested a garnish of boiled leek strips (green parts). I'll add those too. And maybe half milk, half cream instead of the heavy cream to make it somewhat lighter.

Fantastic....I would give this soup 5 forks if I could!The mixture of flavors was incredible. The garnish of fried parsnips is a must and just takes a minute. Used a vegetable peeler and fried parsnips in a small pan in 1/2 inch of oil. I used 2% milk instead of the cream . Bet you can't eat just one bowl!

I've made this soup for years with rave reviews. I skip the garnish because it is too much work but have used a dusting of fresh chives (cutting back a bit in the shallots). I love it with cider and I've never met anyoe who doesn't like it.

Haven't tried this but quick not to filippa who added the cider vinegar - the recipe calls for apple cider or juice - not vinegar! No wonder it was awful. Maybe you should try it again.

Well I did something drastically wrong. I only had 1 parsnip so I halved the recipe. Well I confidently threw in half a cup of cider vinegar. Big mistake. After a few mouthfuls I just can't force any more down. Too much cider vinegar. Obviously I did something wrong. So for any novices out there like me, add the cider vinegar gradually, to taste!!

Very delicious. The parsnips and apples complement each other well. It is rather sweet, but if you like parsnips, then you'll like the sweetness. I didn't have apple juice, so I used applesauce and a little added water. It worked. I don't eat meat, so I used water instead of chicken broth--veg broth would work better, but it was still flavorful.

I began to worrry since I've had a couple of failed soups from this site.. but this was FANTASTIC. As everyone said, the parsnips and apple work wonderfully together. This was the first time I've ever even eaten a parsnip! Use apple cider instead of apple juice.

I think I added one too many parsnips to the soup, which overwhelmed the soup with a very parsnippy flavour and not enough apple. It was okay although I probably won't make it again.

This soup has a woonderful flavor. Next time, though, I won't puree it smooth. My husband said (and I agree) that it needed "chunks". As a smooth soup it seems to lack something.

I have made this soup several times and offer the following based on my experience...I have used different types of chicken broth - homemade, Swanson's, and Butterball and found the Butterball Low-Sodium, Extra Flavor (blue label) to be the best by far. It made all the difference in the richness and flavor of the soup. I have also added extra apple juice (I prefer apple cider) and it didn't hurt at all. A definite keeper - I make it often.

This was really easy to make. Use a hand blender to puree in the pot. I substituted NF milk for the cream, and didn't use any butter at all and it was really rich anyway. I also added a little fresh lemon juice.Perfect with a salad, and some crusty bread!

I served this delicious soup to my guests on Christmas evening it was a great hit. I was pleasantly surprised how easy it was to make, it is so rich and flavourful you would think it took hours to prepare. The garnish can be easily made by using a potato peeler. I deep fried the parsnip shavings in 1/2" canola oil in my frying pan, they cooked seconds.

Everyone at my house thought this was great! Most of them had never tried parsnips before and agreed that they are all now parsnip fans. I did make the fried parsnips for the garnish, but I don't think I would do that again. It was a nice extra touch, but no one really cared for them and it was more trouble than it was really worth. I like someone else's suggestion of chives-sounds much better and easier.

I made this soup for our gourmet group, and it was a big hit! I doubled the recipe (except for the apple juice) to serve eight as a first course and had some left over. I also added some lemon to taste, which gave it some extra tanginess. In addition to the fried parsnips on top, I added chives. Delicious!
