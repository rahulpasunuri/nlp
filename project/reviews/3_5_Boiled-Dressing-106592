This is better than Hellmans, and it's good to know that the ingredients are all natural and unadulterated. Delicious.

It's just an old fashioned name. I guess it predates Hellman's on every shelf. My mother-in-law's neighbor, who died 25 years ago at the age of 85, always made a dressing like this for her potato salad. I still remember how good it was.

Why is this called "boiled" dressing if you're not supposed to let it boil?
