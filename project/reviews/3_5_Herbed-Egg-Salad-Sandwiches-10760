This is my new favorite egg salad. I used 5 eggs and omitted the lemon juice. Used chives and fresh parsley for the herbs. Served it on marble rye bread. Wonderful, highly recommend. Husband and Granddaughter love it too!

This was very tasty and easy. Next time I will use six eggs with the same amount of other ingredients so that it is less "saucy". I used cinnamon basil and parsley as the herbs. I can never find anything to use that basil for but this was a wonderful choice.

OK, so I know it's not the best egg salad of all time, but it's become my go-to, 10 PM on a weeknight, "shoot, what are we going to make for lunch tomorrow?" recipe, because it's quick, easy, and tastes good. I make it with chives, which is a good egg salad herb. I know a lot of people don't like the sour cream, but for me that's actually what makes the recipe -- I have an aversion to overly mayonnaised egg, tuna and potato salads, so this lightens it up a bit and avoids that problem at all costs. I did not find that it made it too runny, especially if you're going to refrigerate the salad before serving.

This recipe is very good, although not overly flavorful. I would venture to say it is kid friendly, and would be good to serve to picky eaters. I will definitely include it in future picnics.

Delicious change of pace from the usual egg salad. I have many herbs in my garden and any combination works well. I like to add sage, oregano, and chives. Increased the scallions, lemon zest, and Dijon. YUM!

I thought this was a nice variation of the regular egg salad. I used flat leaf parsley and chives from my herb garden and also added a little dill. The next time I think I'll use only the lemon zest and omit the juice of the lemon. Very tasty and I'm positive I'll make it again.

Great egg salad - I took the advice of other reviewers and omitted the sour cream and used chives and dill. Tasty! Would definitely make it again

A favorite at the tea party I threw for my mother's 70th birthday. My 7-year old niece particularly liked it, which means I will make it again. I would omit the sour cream - the mixture is too runny with it. I used dill and chives as the herbs. I thought about spreading mayonnaise on the edges and rolling in additional herbs for presentation, but ran out of time. Maybe next time!

This recipe is fine but nothing special. I used tarragon. Maybe should try again with different herb.

This was good but not spectacular. There are too many recipes out there for me to try this one again.

This was great alternative to typical egg salad. It was a little thinner than I prefer it, but tasty none the less...

The salad was good but not knock-your-socks-off- great. I used a combo of mayo/sour cream/yogurt. The dijon certainly is crucial and I added extra to help give it some zing. I served it on fresh, homemade rye bread and that helped some. I'd make it again but with some modifications. I wonder what a dash of horseradish would do for it. Or, leave out all the hot stuff and go dill city and top with cucumber. Hmmm.

This is a delicious alternative to plain egg salad. I added dill, capers, and some smoked salmon and served it on toasted bagels- absolutely fantastic!!

A delicious way to use up all those Easter eggs, but I'll definitely be making this again. I used chives and tarragon from my garden and had to use an onion roll because the 7-grain bread I planned on using was gone. I skipped the lemon zest this time and it was very good, but I'll give it a try next time.

the dijon is key - without it, well, it's like a chocolate cake without the chocolate!!!

Pretty disappointing! My version seemed flavorless and textureless. I didn't have any Dijon mustard on hand, so subbed dry mustard powder and threw in some capers to enhance the brightness, but no luck. Found myself searching desperately through the cabinets and fridge for something to perk this up...ending up throwing in more lemon zest, anchovy paste, chili powder...nothing rescued it. Also found that the yield is grossly overstated - I made this recipe at 150% and squeezed only 3 mildly plump sandwiches out of it. Won't make it again.

Great recipe! If you're trying to lighten it up a little, opt for reduced-fat mayo and sour cream -- don't go fat-free all the way. I made that mistake and my sandwiches had a slightly sour flavor to them. I think they would have been superb with full-fat mayo and sour cream, though.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe for egg salad. The only change/addition I made was to add a bit of anchovy paste to the mix. Delicious!!

I like it fine, but like it even better when I add about 3/4 cup steamed, chilled, and chopped asparagus to it. And, I prefer it with the addition of a few spoonsful of capers, plus a pinch of curry powder, [or] a pinch each of coriander, cumin, garum masala, turmeric, etc.

I made this recipe for tea sandwhiches, and it was a big hit! I just used parsley for the fresh herbs, and it worked out fine.

This recipe is delicious. Great way to use up left over easter eggs! This is the only way I make egg salad now.
