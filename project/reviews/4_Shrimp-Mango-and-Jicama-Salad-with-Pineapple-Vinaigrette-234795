I used the vinaigrette part of this recipe to make a chopped salad with jicama, zucchini, red pepper, fresh pineapple, mango, cilantro, green onion and cucumber. It turned out fabulous and was a bit hit with my ladies group as a side dish with grilled Garlic Lime Ginger Pork Loin (from Epicurious). My husband didn't even mind eating it leftover for the next couple of days and he never eats leftovers, plus he asked for it after it was all gone! This is going to be my go to summer side salad this year.

i did a review earlier, but i forgot to say i roasted the shrimp instead of boiling them, the texture and taste was great. i put a little olive oil, salt,pepper, and ginger to season.

This was a very simple and yummy dish to make. I couldn't find jicama, so I cut an Asian pear in thin slices, it worked well. I think I will add avocado the next time or even try a little red pepper flake or some sort of heat.

This was the salad for a luncheon for 35 ladies with an Hawaiian theme. We started with Mango Gazpacho, so eliminated the mangoes in this salad. We used spinach instead of Boston lettuce (easier for a buffet) and used Trader Joe's cooked shrimp. Soaked the red onion, next time will eliminate. Otherwise, DELICIOUS!GREAT vinaigrette!

I've made this recipe several times and love it. I feel that eating the salad while the shrimp is still slightly warm makes a difference.

I followed the recipe exactly and would not change a thing. Absolutely loved it! Note, you will have onion breath after eating...

I had to make a few substitutions - spinach for Boston lettuce, pineapple juice for concentrate, and frozen mango. Like other reviewers, I added avocado, and it made the salad much better. However, this was just good. It was a lot of effort for something just good, so I'm unlikely to make it again.

This salad is great: easy and delicious! Substituted the jicama with apple (couldn't find it) and doubled the amount of cilantro...yummy!!! It's now a frequent staple in my repertoire!

We omitted the onion and cilantro. The frozen cooked shrimp and the frozen mango from Trader Joe's made this fast and easy. Very popular

Very tasty- nice summer meal. Went well with Quinoa black bean salad

I could not find any jicama to use so I replaced it w/ a variety of green and red apples. They worked beautifully. The flavors were so good w/ Jerk Chicken that several times, I omitted the shrimp, dice every thing super small and used it as a chutney to cut the heat of the jerk. It is always a hit!!

I used peeled and chopped granny smith apples instead of jicama and regular pineapple juice, not concentrate. I made this all summer because our local supermarket gave away 4lb bags of shrimp as loyalty incentives.

Very good. I couldn't find pineapple juice concentrate so I just used pineapple juice instead and bumped up the amount. I added a diced jalapeno, which was very good. I will definitely add an avocado or two next time I prepare this. I think it would be especially tastey if you grilled the shrimp...

I only made the vinaigrette, not the salad, but boy was it delicious! Great tropical taste.

This is one of the BEST SALADS EVER! I have made it so many times - awesome! I use only half of the oil and add a tad more pineapple concentrate or other juice, like lime. Amazingly delicious.

Delicious! I tried the jicama and liked it. As with others, added more pineapple and lime juice but I also added PEACH SCHNAPPS, which pumped it up nicely. I tried this with a combination of crab, shrimp, and lobster and also threw in some avacado. What compelled me to post a review is that the vinaigrette is tasty and versatile, so you can twist the recipe a number of ways and it's a win-win.

Loved this recipe! So perfect for summertime because it is fresh and sweet. As a sidedish, it might feed 6, but probably more like 3-4. I am going to try green apples with it next time, per my man's suggestion. Cucumbers, too. Fabuloso!

Great, simple, easy to make

Delicious. Took it to a Caribbean party and it was gone by the end of the meal. Followed everyone elses' suggestions and added a lot more pineapple concentrate and lime juice until it tasted the way I wanted it to taste. Added more cilantro too than the recipe called for. Use cucumber instead of jicama because I couldn't find it at any of the stores around me.

I made this salad for a potluck and it was gone it minutes!I am going to try cooking shrimp this way for other recipes. If only I could have had Southern shrimp--it would have been perfect. I will definitly make this again.

This was a delicious salad, great for a summer side. This in spite of the fact that we used pre-cooked shrimp rather than cook raw shrimp as directed by the recipe, which might have added to the final product. However, it was plenty flavorful as is, will definitely make again!

I actually used this recipe in a different way. I was preparing food for a carribean themed party, and all the food (or most of it) was to be on skewers. I really wanted to use this salad recipe, so I decided to try it on skewers as well. I left off the jicama, but otherwise prepared the salad as the recipe states. Rather than serving on a plate, I skewered the mango, red onion and shrimp (after "marinating" in the pineapple lime dressing) and laid each skewer on a boston lettuce leaf. Guest could eat the food either right off the skewer or wrap the food in the lettuce and pull the skewer out. Either way, it was delicious and a big hit!

My partner loved this salad. He said it's his new favorite summer salad. I will probably add less onion and jicama next time, but the tip to add more pineapple juice was right on the money.

This recipe was excellent. I made it for a party and everyone loved it. It is a very crisp and refreshing salad perfect of a hot summer day.

We made this and really enjoyed it! It will go into our "summer entertaining" recipes. We also added more pineapple juice. Next time, we will probably add some chunks of avocado. I think you could easily use the ready-prepared cold, boiled shrimp if you were in a hurry.

This is absolutely fabulous! I'm always looking for a new salad recipe and this one is a keeper. I made the dressing according to directions plus followed the hint about adding more concentrate. The jicama/mango/shrimp combo is perfect. You could easily replace the jicama with cucumber if you don't have access to exotic produce, and it would work well.

Wasn't able to find jicama that day, so I substituted canned bamboo shoots instead. Also, used canned pineapple juice (pure), along with chopped pineapple bits. Ate the whole thing rolled up in romaine lettuce leaves- messy, but very delicious.

I'd give it over 3 1/2 forks. My wife is always asking me to fix her a light salad and I never have until I read this recipe. It tastes just as good as it sounds. I took the advice of the other commentors and went heavier on the pineapple concentrate (another spooonful). Outstanding!!!!

This was a fantastic salad. I added a bit more pineapple juice but would not change anything else. My husband enjoyed it a top of cold basmati rice. I will make this easy, refreshing salad again soon!

This is a very refreshing salad for a summer supper. I found the pineapple dressing a little too mild (I will use a little more pineapple next time with just a pince of brown sugar) but my husband really liked it as written. I added red pepper and cucumber and served it over spinach.
