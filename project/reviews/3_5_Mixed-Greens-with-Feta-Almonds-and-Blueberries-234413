An absolutely terrific summer salad. I've made it many times, and after my family members have had it, they go on to make it many times as well. One strange discrepancy between this online recipe and the one in the magazine that I use: The online recipe says to use toasted pine nuts, while the recipe I have says to use toasted slivered almonds. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

This salad is fantastic! I substituted balsamic vinegar for the red wine vinegar and it was delicious. Very quick and easy.

Incredibly simple and so, so good. I used pine-nuts, not almonds. Super quick to throw together with simple ingredients.

This is one of my favorite salads. I like to use goat feta (I think it tastes better) and have also subbed goat cheese. I sometimes add leftover shredded chicken to this for more of a meal. I also love it as a BBQ side. A great use for extra summer berries!

I make this salad often and find that we love salads that include lettuces, fruit, a tart or strong cheese and nuts. The magazine recipe does say almonds, was confused by the pine nut comments. This goes well with many dishes.

This salad has my guest going back for seconds but I do change it up. Most important BABY ARUGULA. It's just not the same with mixed greens. A touch more honey. Taste the dressing, you'll know when it's nicely sweet. And I toast almonds instead of pine nuts. PERFECT!

This was delicious, and as the author notes you can pretty much substitute any nut, berry or green for this recipe, so I used almonds and hazelnuts with baby spinach.

Doesn't knock your socks off, but very good & very simple.

While I found the dressing to be just average, I thought the salad was delightful. I made it with pinenuts as listed in the ingredients (they are more popular with my family) but I'm sure that it would also be great with almonds as indicated in the title.

FIrst time I made this recipe, I inadvertently used 1 tablespoon of honey instead of 1 teaspoon. The result was still well received. The next time I made it, I used 1 teaspoon of honey and the resulting dressing was fair. Next time I will probably use someting in between those two measures.

This is a wonderful salad. My mother-in-law said it was the best salad I have ever made. I also thought it was strange the recipe said pinenuts, but the magazine called for almonds. Obviously a typo here. Very easy to make. Definitely will make again.

Delicious. A great mix of flavors, and a flavorful start to a meal. The feta and blueberries combo is delish with the dressing. I had to use sherry vinegar as I discovered I was out of red wine vinegar.

This is a nice refreshing salad and the dressing is so easy and quick to make with ingredients usually on hand. Have made it a few times already and have passed the recipes to guests who wanted it.

While I love all of the ingredients in this salad, I was disappointed by the end result. The dressing is bland and needs to be jazzed up somehow.
