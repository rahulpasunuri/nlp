Texture problem here: it's just too stiff, like slightly airy fudge. Delicious and rich, almost too rich; two of the three of us couldn't finish our portions.

The best thing I have ever eaten. Very easy to prepare. I cried when I had the first bite.

I usually do egg-based chocolate mousse. But I chose this recipe because the reviews (and ingredients) indicated it would be stiff enough to scoop. It was very stiff! Here's my quibble with Julia: textures of whipped cream and mousse are too similar. In lieu of the white chocolate whipped cream, I made a creme anglaise. Seedless raspberry puree into glass bowls, then mousse, then creme anglaise drizzled on top. My elderly relatives loved it (as did the younger ones). Though this was very easy and popular, I will continue with egg-based mousses.

Who am I to argue or change a recipe of Julia Child's? However, that is what I'll do. My husband is addicted to chocolate mousse so I make it to please him. Although he and all my guests have loved it, and it is much easier to make than the egg version I find it a little on the thick side. So, here are my suggestions: replace the raspberry liqueur with 1/2 amaretto and 1/2 grand marnier (yum)! Also, increase the amount of whipping cream to 1 1/2 cups. Finally, don't make too far in advanced. Enjoy.

I made this as a birthday dessert for someone who likes Sambuca, so I substitued that for the raspberry liquer. No problem; it still tasted wonderful. It was quite dense, and it doesn't keep well - I thought it tasted odd the next day.

Although the flavors all worked wonderfully together, the consistency of the mousse was much too dense. When chilled it became like ice cream, not light and fluffly like I had hoped. The white chocolate didn't integrate easily with the whipped cream, but perhaps I did something wrong. I agree that there was too much liqueur as well. Don't think I'd make this again.

This is a good mousse recipe -- EXCEPT, it calls for TOO MUCH raspberry liquer -- the friut taste overwhelms the mousse -- next time, I will incorporate one-quarter the amount!

I loved this dessert! It was relatively easy to make but looked quite elegant. I wouldn't recommend making it too far in advance; the chocolate becomes dense, far from the light and fluffy treat it can be if served on the same day.

I had to make this dish for French class. Everyone in the class loved it. I liked it the most. Since then I have made for my roommates and my other friends on campus

The combination of flavors in this mousse is wonderful ... very yummy. However, when chilled, mousse becomes very dense and not very attractive - I would suggest a serving piece that is not clear glass.
