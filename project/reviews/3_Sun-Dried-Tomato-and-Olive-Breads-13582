I made this bread for a picnic with my collegues, they all loved it. It goes very well with a tapenade (dip made of olives and anchovies). Based on the other reviews, I put 1/2 tablespoon salt instead of 1, and this was largely enough.

While this bread is cakey, the flavors are fabulous. I have friends who request it as a gift around the holidays. It's fantastic toasted and when you bake it your house smells great. We also like to serve it with soup in the winter (great dipping). Definitely cut out the salt and rinse the capers. I also like to substitute the tomato oil for the shortening for added flavor.

This bread had a cakey consistency (not what I was expecting) and was WAY too salty. I suggest elliminating the tsp. of salt, and even rinsing the brine from the olives and capers before adding to the batter.
