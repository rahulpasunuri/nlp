Very good and easy, but be frugal with the salt- the cheese itself is already very salty.

Very delicious and easy to whip up in a hurry. It was a hit with everyone, and even some of my less "cheese-cultured" family members enjoyed.The fresh rosemary and garlic are just the trick!

An excellent appetizer with pasta. We took this to a dinner party and it was devoured immediately.
