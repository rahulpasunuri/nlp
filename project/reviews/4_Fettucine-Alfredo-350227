With "I'd pay for this" comments coming from all at the table, I am thoroughly pleased with this recipe. I added the cheese to the cream mixture before the pasta and stirred until fully incorporated; I then added some champagne vinegar to the sauce for a bit of acidity. I served this with shrimp and a nice chardonnay. Definitely a keeper.

I liked this a lot, wife didn't at all. I thought it was quick, easy and made for a great backup plan when w realized we didn't have everything we needed for the planned dinner. Added some steamed broccoli at the end and some smashed garlic cloves to the simmering cream. Would definitely make again when she's not around.

Fantastic! It reminds me of the kind the women on the Italian side of my family make. It's much better than the stuff you buy in a jar and not much more difficult.

Rating: 4
The sauce is way too thin, even before you add the additional water to it, so I added 1 CUP more Parmesan cheese and that thickened it right up! Plus, I added some fresh mushrooms and broccoli sauteed in garlic and baked cajun shrimp. That spiced it right up and this is a good base recipe to add to.

WOW - this is so good!!! I made it for my husband during the week - so quick and easy - and of course we had to have it again. I made it for lunch Sunday and added a tablespoon of gorgonzola and a couple handfuls of spinach to the sauce - and that made a GREAT blue cheese alfredo.

I almost forgot. If you use poor quality cheese to prepare this, you will end up with a bland dish. This is all about a creamy CHEESE sauce :o) This is a winner!

Rating: 4
Absolutely perfect! Be sure to use only the 1/4 cup of pasta water. This was not too watery. I also added a large crushed garlic clove to the simmering cream for added flavor. I removed the garlic clove before combining the ingredients. A little cooked diced chicken breast tossed into this was also very good.

A great and easy pasta dish. I saute shallots and pancetta in butter and add them to the cream/butter mixture before adding the noodles. yummy!

Rating: 3
I'm giving this recipe three forks because I did have to adapt it quite a bit. I'd suggest not adding the water as this made me have to cook the sauce for a lot longer to produce a thick enough sauce. Basically the water had to evaporate to make it thick enough for the pasta. I also suggest you double the parmesan so use about 2/3 cup parmesan for the best results. I served this with Engagement Chicken and my husband loved it. Also the recipe doesn't say how long to cook the sauce and it does take some time for all the cheese to melt. Otherwise I'm glad I found this recipe and could adapt it to taste.

Rating: 4
Delicious. I didn't change a thing. I used fresh pasta, cooked al dente in heavily salted water, high quality cheese freshly grated, and additional salt and pepper. If you use mediocre quality ingredients, or skip a layer of seasoning, I could see how the result could be bland. Also, adding the pasta to the sauce with a little pasta water made for the perfect consistency/ texture. Yum!

When I was a teen I had an extreme love of Fettucine Alfredo. I ate it weekly, and perfected a recipe (different from this one). As an adult, I found a cream sauce such as this too rich, and difficult for me to eat. So I thought the recipe needed a bit of acid to balance out the cream. Here is my alteration. 2 tsps of chopped garlic 1/2 of the butter in the recipe 1 egg yolk 1/8 cup of deyhdrated tomatoes (mine was home made and stored in olive oil) 1/8 cup of cilantro My daughter absolutely loved this. A friend of mine tasted it and though there was bacon in it.

Rating: 3
This sauce is extremely decadent, rich and delicious. I sauteed 1 T of shallots in the butter at the beginning for a little extra flavor. Because it's a basic sauce you could add pretty much anything to the pasta - I chose chicken, baby bellas and peas. I agree with some of the other reviewers that this is not enough for four; it's more like two or three.

Super easy and super yummy

Rating: 0
I can't give this a fork rating due to changes we made, but I think the proportions are just right for producing a good texture, and the right amount of sauce for the amount of pasta called for. Really creamy without being sickeningly rich. Garlic, shallot, arugula, peas, and nutmeg all worked as additions. We used pretty cheap romano, and it was still great. Note: this amount of pasta and sauce does not really make 4 main course servings if you are planning on an indulgent pasta night and you are not making any other courses. My partner and I are not particularly piggy, but we ate the full recipe, even with the added arugula and peas. Yes, we were very full, but pleasantly so.

Rating: 4
Such an elegant recipe. I have done several variations on this and it always turns out well.And the best part is having the kids gobble it down. Today's additions were sauteing mini bella mushrooms, garlic and shallots in the butter before adding the cream and pasta. I then added huge prawns (already cooked) at the end and heated until warm. Yummy!!!!

Quick, easy, tasty, and easily modified. Add roasted garlic, or baby spinach, or mushrooms. Just be sure to use unsalted butter, or taste before adding additional salt.

A great, indispensable cream sauce. If anything a dash of nutmeg is nice once in a while, but perfect as is. Definitely one to put in the recipe box.

Rating: 4
Based on everyone's ratings, I too made some slight changes. I used the half and half cream, nutmeg, and garlic as the previous rating recommended. In addition, I used both Parmesan reggiano and romano cheeses. I was trying to re-create the Alfredo I had at La Familigia, by far the best Italian restaurant in Boston's North End. They use Romano cheese. I topped the pasta with prosciutto, sliced chicken breast, and sautéed mushrooms. I think you can top this pasta with anything- broccoli, chicken, mushrooms, etc. or leave plain. It's a good basic alfedo sauce.

Rating: 4
As per other reviews, I added garlic and nutmeg to the butter before adding the cream. This is what I used: 1/2 C. Half and Half, 4 Tbl butter, about 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 3 large cloves garlic (love it!), a touch of extra virgin olive oil for the garlic to brown in, and about 1/2 c. freshly grated parmiganno cheese. Another note: I did not make this sauce for pasta, but rather for a pizza. It's on a rosemary ficosha dough, with grated swiss and cheddar cheese, fresh spinach, green and yellow bell peppers, and lemon shrimp. The sauce turned out amazingly! Waiting for the pizza to cool to try finished product. Smells delish!

Fantastically simple base alfredo. After making this once, I see lots of potential for variation! As is, a superb simple sauce. I added a crushed garlic clove and a bit of extra parmesan and it was superb!

Rating: 4
I use this as my base recipe whenever I make alfredo. The recipe as written is excellent, but when making it for myself I usually use half and half instead of cream and saute mushrooms and spinach first. A little garlic powder and/or nutmeg also gives it a bit more flavor. Oh - and I've successfully made this with mozzarella instead of Parmesan, and wouldn't be surprised if other cheeses taste just as good.

This is wonderful - I have made it several times with the only addition being a small amount of nutmeg. This recipe is so good that it made it onto my cooking blog - check it out! http://unhipsquirrel.blogspot.com/2011/05/classic-fettucine-alfredo_13.html

I made the sauce portion of this recipe many times, always to consistent results and rave reviews. Super easy, quick, and delicious. The first time I added additional salt, but once the cheese was added it was too salty. Resist the urge to do this, only add additional seasoning after all the cheese has been incorporated into the sauce.

Not quite right ... you want to undercook the fettuccine, drain them before they are al dente. Then put them back in the pot with a bit of cooking water and the cream, and stir until they absorb it all, at which point they should be al dente. Otherwise they will be overcooked. Add the butter and cheese at the end, if the fettuccine get coated with butter they will not absorb the cream! Best of all, should you be so lucky, is to shave some white truffle over it all...!

made exactly as is, this recipe is really, really delicious. Of course with all that butter and cheese, it's a once-a-year kinda treat.

Doubled recipe and served with some cheese tortellini. Modified as follows: added one lag. garlic clove, few hot pepper flakes and dash of fresh nutmeg, plus a large handful of mizuna at the end to add color.Replaced 1/2 of the heavy cream with low fat half and half Very good and easy.

What a great recipe! Fast and easy. I used made it with Thanksgiving leftovers - onions, thyme, mushrooms, garlic and or of course turkey added into the butter before the noodles. It was fantastic. Unfortunately I halved the recipe and there will not be leftoevers. Definately a keeper.

As an Italian, it's a shame I have never tasted or eaten Fettucine Alfredo! This was very good....what wouldn't be good with simple ingredients + butter? I doubled the recipe [love leftovers] and did make changes of using whole wheat pasta, and half & half instead of cream. I made breaded baked chicken breasts and salad to complete the meal. This will ofcourse be a 5* recipe on my pc bookmarks!

this is so easy and delicious. I caramelized an onion in butter, then added garlic, shitake mushrooms and let it cook a bit. Then, I added the cream and cheese. Double the recipe, but used the same amount of pasta water. Served with flatiron steaks and arugula salad. Great combo.

I tried this recipe first with half and half to make it slightly healthier, but made it exactly as shown the second time. My family raved about it the second time! Even my picky 13 year old loves it!

I would probably make more for 4 adults, but portions are fine for 2 adults/2 children.

this was pretty classic Alfredo. I used half and half and a little arrowroot to minimize the coronary risk. I doubled the recipe and shouldn't have doubled the pepper, so I had to make more sauce. I even used Sargento parm cheese and it was good. LOL. So i'd go a bit easier on the pepper and do add some garlic. I just made the sauce with cheese and pasta water.adjusted thickness with Arrowroot and poured over pasta. I'm still recovering, but hmm it's good. Plus I got to tell my kids that the REAL Alfredo lit my mother's cigarette at his restaurant in Rome in the mid 1950s.

I've been using an Alfredo recipe for years that - while good - is much more complicated and not nearly as tasty as this recipe. This Alfredo is OMG GOOD! With 4 people, including 2 hungry boys home from college, I tripled the recipe. I also sauteed 1 large clove of garlic in the butter (as per other reviews) before adding the cream, a touch of fresh ground nutmeg, and cooked up 16 oz of fettuccine nests. I saved the pasta water, just in case, and did end up adding one small ladle-full to the mixture. It's ALL gone.

thanks to previous reviewers, I added some ingredients because it sounded pretty bland. I sauteed garlic in the butter, added some mushrooms and shredded spinach, more salt, a shake of cayenne and a dollop of pesto. It came together beautifully and was very tasty. One thing, though: I don't think this would be enough sauce for four servings, as we two ate it all up.

A very easy recipe. Like others, I put the cheese into the mixture after the pasta was added. I did not add any extra water. This will be my alfredo recipe from now on. Also, I added garlic, crushed red pepper, 1/2 pound shrimp and several diced, cooked andouille sausages. Yummy!

Rating: 4
I also made changes, but the sauce was so creamy and delicious I am rating it 4 forks because I think it would have been amazing even as is. I threw the cheese directly into the sauce with the butter, which turned out well, making for a thick sauce with great texture. I minced some sundried tomatoes, half a chipotle, and some basil and spinach and tossed it in while it simmered. I also threw in a tiny bit of flour/water slurry towards the end, since I loathe a sauce that's not thick enough, but I don't think it was actually necessary, the cheese seemed to thicken quite nicely. I didn't bother to thin with the cooking water, just tossed in a splash of vermouth at the end. This is delicious, and I plan to make it again exactly as written to confirm my suspicions that really - all you need is butter, cream, and cheese.

Rating: 4
Easy recipe. Next time I will add the garlic as suggested. I too used salted butter. I used 1/4 C half and half and 1/4 C whole milk. I cut up chicken and sauteed it, then mushrooms. I added these in the last step. It was really good.

It is a very good basic recipe. But like others have stated you do need to add some seasoning, such as salt, pepper and basil. I also doubled the recipe for the sauce. As is, the recipe would yield only enough sauce for 1/4 to 1/2 lb of pasta (IMO).

By itself this recipe is plain. I added shrimp and sea scallops which seemed to help. I made a little more of the sauce as I found the recipe to produce too little for my liking. The best thing about this recipe is how quick and easy it is.

I added broccoli and a bunch of black pepper. The sauce was thinner than I expected, but simple and delicious. I used the pasta I had on hand, which was plain old penne, and it was still very yummy.

Not terrible, but bland. Notice that all the excellent reviews are by people who added all sorts of seasoning--I would not recommend cooking it plain! I love plain old fettucine Alfredo but was disappointed with this recipe. A word of caution, be extremely careful not to let the pasta cook past al dente--egg noodles cook fast, and the result of overcooking is awful!

This recipe was incredibly easy and tasty. Because the ingredients are so simple, you really could experiment with other flavors. I added one small clove of garlic. The only thing I would be cautious about is the pasta water. If your pasta water is too salty (as mine was thanks to the well-meaning actions of my boyfriend), it will make your dish too salty. I wound up using the water because the pasta was done a little before everything else and needed a little water before serving.

This fettucine is just delicious. I realized too late that I didn't have Parmigiano-Reggiano in the house so I used grated mozzarella in its place. I made half the receipe and didn't need the pasta water at all. This was really a wonderfully easy and scrumptious pasta.
