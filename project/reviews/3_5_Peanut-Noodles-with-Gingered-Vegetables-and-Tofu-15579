Not worth the effort! This recipe should be called "Boring Stir Fry Without Much Flavor." There's nothing exactly bad about it, but it's not really good either. Skip it and move on to something else.

I made this while my vegetarian cousin was visiting. The color and crunch of the vegetables really make this delicious. I may make it with chicken in the future, but have to say I don't miss meat in this at all.

Yum! How many dinners can boast seven veggies? A lot of chopping, but worth it. I did use this recipe as more of a guideline than a mandate. For the peanut sauce, I used the Spicy Peanut Sauce from Gourmet, April 1996 (a half recipe). For the veggies, I swapped snow peas for the yellow squash and added garlic and soy to the mix. I didn't do it, but this would also be great with cilantro on top.

I give this a "meh." The peanut sauce in the Moosewood cookbook is better. It's a perfectly fine meal but nothing special.

This was a tasty recipe. I like the fact that it has lots of vegetables and, of course, you could adjust the varieties of veggies to your family's taste and the season. I only gave the recipe three forks, though because I thought it could use a little extra punch of flavor. Personally, I seasoned the veggies with a bit of light soy sauce and some asian sesame oil. I also thought the pepper could use a little boost. If your family eats spicy food, I recommend punching it up or mixing a bit of chinese chili garlic sauce in when you cook your veggies. Otherwise, tasty and healthy:-)

completely delicious! we added half a seeded jalapeno to the peanut sauce because we like things extra-spicy. otherwise a fabulous, fresh, delicious meal!

Pretty, fresh tasting, a lot of chopping and prep for a decent but not extraordinary result. I definitely didn't find the recipe made too many vegetables. I added half again as much of everything to serve six enthusiastic vegetable lovers and I came up a little short. For best flavor brown the tofu separately then add it to the other ingredients. I'd try this recipe again because I like the Chinese Peanut Sauce, but next time I'll add sugar snap peas and even more of the other vegetables.

This was a good recipe, but it wasn't fantastic. Although the peanut sauce was tasty, it was denser than I would like. Perhaps I was simply put off by the truly incredible amount of food that it made--one person can only consume so many peanut noodles before losing an appetite for them.

try quorn meat free chicken tenders with this if you don't like tofu. These things taste exactly like real chicken, i have fooled everyone i have made this dish for into thinking that they were really eating chicken. Substituting the tofu with these things makes this great dish even better.

look for thai rice noodles instead of just plain spaghetti when you make this, it goes a lot better with the peanut sauce and you can usually find them in the international section of your grocery store

What a delicious peanut sauce recipe!! I used whole wheat pasta which worked wonderfully. A slight change to the tofu in that I marinated it a bit in soy sauce, ginger and garlic and then browned it separately from the vegis. Topped the whole thing with some left over peanut sauce. Yum!! It makes quite a bit of food too!

Very yummy, and made lots of leftovers for my husband and I. Will definitely make it again.

This was delicious. I made it with whole wheat linguine instead of spaghetti and I doubled the sauce. Next time I would stir fry the tofu first to brown it.

Loved this recipe, it made a lot of food with tons left over for yummy leftovers. Subtituted different veggies and baked the tofu after marinating it in the peanut sauce, but this extra step is not necessary for a delicious healthy meal.

Lots of chopping but well worth it! My first experience with tofu and I am now a big fan. Highly recommend.

I loved this dish. i've been looking for a peanut sauce/pasta recipe for awhile, and this is the best I've tried yet. Thank you to those who suggested chicken instead of tofu. I thought my kids wouldn't get close to it with tofu in it, so I stir-fried chicken instead. Next time I will marinate the chicken to give it more taste. I thought the sauce was just right- not too thin (it actually gets thicker as it cools), not too sweet. My 15 year old son who usually asks if he can make a pizza when I put something like this on the table had 3 helpings, and ate most of the veggies too. Will definitely make again.

This is a great recipe . The sauce is so simple if you make ahead . Say a few hours before I use chicken instead of tofu as my husband will not eat tofu . I use sp onions, carrots, broccoli, sugar snap peas and red pepper. I store the sauce separately for leftovers . yum

This makes an extraordinary amount of food--my husband and I have been eating leftovers for a week! It's very good, and the vegetables stay crunchy even days later. I doubled the peanut sauce--it just wasn't enough for the amount of pasta and vegetables.

Used mushrooms instead of squash. Was a great recipe and was easy to make :)

Fantastic way to get veggies into your diet!! I used broccoli, portebella mushrooms, and bean sprouts. Tofu was added in thin strips that were sauteed first in olive oil, crushed red pepper, and garlic (yummy!!!). Also, to really kick it up-a-notch, add half of a habernero chili pepper to the sauteed veggie mix. What a difference!!!

yummy, yummy, yummy and so good for your tummy! Labor intensive? Pshawww! I didn't study the recipe so I picked up a jar of peanut sauce at the grocery. Delicious! Yet, now that I found the peanut sauce recipe that goes w/this dish, I'll definitely try it because that recipe alone looks delish! I did not use green onion as I can't stomach it -- I subbed shallot for the white part and chives for the green part. Next time I'll throw in some bean sprouts. Don't understand the comment about the garlic since the recipe doesn't call for it??? The "tofu was gross" comment??? Don't get it. You HAVE to use the extra firm and only heat it through. Don't like it? Substitute some cooked chicken - or shrimp!

My husband and I love this. I make it as written except for the red bell peppers, which I freakin' detest. My kids aren't fans, but then if it isn't mac n cheese.....

I make this recipe all the time. It is diffrent every time, depending on what vegetables are in the fridge. I am not sure why others say that it is a lot of work to make. I find that it is about as labour intensive as making a stir-fry. It is also easy to double or even quadruple. When I make the sauce I use boiling water making it easy to stir. I also found that leftovers are easily microwaveable and tastes as just as good the next day for lunch! This is one of those recipes that you can make easily and quickly with whatever is in your fridge.

Two words: Not Good. It's definitely too much work for the finished product. The peanut sauce was decent, but the tofu was gross. Maybe it'd be edible with chicken instead.

We used Indonesian sweet soy sauce (Ketjap Manis)in place of the soy and sugar as we thought it would be more authentic. The peanut sauce was very good and we liked the variety of veggies; but the dish was not stunning enough for us to want to eat it again.

The peanut sauce was too sweet for our liking. We altered the recipe the second time we made it and enjoyed it a lot more. We used an all natural peanut butter, didn't add in the 2tea. sugar, but added chilie garlic sauce and snow peas. We also substituted in a rice wine vinegar for the apple cider vinegar and used a broader noodle. We liked the taste of the revised recipe and will make it again.

Great recipe! One of our favourites. It does take extra time to chop up all the vegetables, so for us it's a weekend dish. I put in a bit less peanut butter than required, and I use sugar-free peanut butter. Plus, we place the veg on the noodles, then top it off with the sauce. The presentation is nicer, and you can better taste the sauce.

This recipe has become a staple in our house! Even won over a vegetable hating 13 yr. old! We love it as is, no changes to recipe.

This was beautiful, and I loved the Peanut Sauce -- but, overall, it was too tedious chopping all those veggies for the end result. Marinating the tofu (or buying seasoned tofu) is a good idea; maybe that would have made the dish more satisfying.

Rating: 3
I thought this was terrific, but like many others made/would make some changes. I didn't use carrots or celery b/c I don't like them. Added extra hot pepper to the sauce. Didn't have cilantro and it tasted great without, but would like to try it with next time. Pressed the tofu for about an hour for added firmness but I'll pre-fry it separately for crispness next time. Would be good with bean sprouts too I think.

Really a beautiful, reasonably heathly, filling & yummy dish....just make sure you're in a mood to chop vegetables! The sauce was really really good(if you like spicy which we do - if not cut the garlic & red pepper down a bit)& just a hairsbreadth away from being extremely delicious but I am not quite sure what it needed to boost it up to "4 forks" for me.

This is a great dish and so easy. I add a little more sugar in the sauce as well. I have made this several times. I use sugar snap peas and red pepper instead of carrots and celery . A winner every time!

I only used half the peanut sauce with the noodles, and thought it was perfect. I omitted the white parts of the scallions and the celery and used _lots_ more ginger in the veggies. I also marinated the tofu in sesame oil, chile paste, sugar, vinegar, and soy sauce, then drained the cubes before adding them to the veggies. Very nice--really an attractive, easy, cheap and tasty dish. The noodles with peanut sauce do not hold well, though.

The peanut sauce was so vile, I had to get online to make sure I didn't make a mistake (I didn't). In my opinion there is way too much peanut butter; the texture overwhelmes what would otherwise be a light dish. The gingerd veggies are good, though sans the sauce. My boyfriend and I ate one bite of ths and had to order a pizza.

Rating: 3
Very very good. The next time I make it, though, I will reduce the garlic in the peanut sauce by half because we thought it was a little overwhelming. Also, I might double the sauce.

This is an excellent meal for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. To spice up your tofu a bit, dehydrate it in - a lot of - paper towels for one day and then soak it in a blended mixture of ginger, pepper seeds, cilantro, soy sauce, a few drops of sesame oil, garlic, and sugar. Fry until brown and then add to the noodles and tofu! This is a hit with everyone I make it for! (be careful, tofu soaks up the spice of the pepper a lot, so it may be a little too spicy for some people!)

What a pretty entree! I loved this recipe. I'm worried that the left-over might be a bit dry, but the first time it was served was a hit. I (being a non-vegetarian) used chicken instead of tofu and had great results. Next time I would double the sauce recipe and use the extra as needed.

Rating: 4
mmm...what a great way to eat tofu! I used pressed tofu (bought at an asian grocery) since it simply does not fall apart (no matter how much you saute). Other than that, the sauce seemed kind of thin, so I heated it and added some cornstarch, which thickened it right up. I am definitely going to make this a staple meal!

Yum! I served this as a cool summer salad to my Creative Memories Workshop clients and they loved it!! I must admit, I changed a few things. Sugar peas replaced the Brocoli and Baby Bok Choy for celery. Then I added buckwheat soba noodles with the spagetti noodles for a deeper nut flavor. Yum-yum, there were NO left overs!

The tastebuds will dance. I use organic rice noodles and substituted some veggies here and there. The veggie chopping is a bit time consuming, so I get on the phone with a friend I need to catch up with and chat&chop away!!!

Instead of the tofu, I substituted tempeh, which has a firmer texture and won't fall apart while being stir fried; I added it with the ginger so it would get browned, instead of at the end like the recipe suggests for the tofu. I think it was a little dry, and needed more sauce. That said, it was tasty, pretty to look at, and filling.

I added scrambled eggs and mushrooms to this recipe to make it even more scrumptious!

Definitely a keeper. Out of necessity, I had to make a few substitutions: for vegetables, I used equal parts of green beans and carrots (about double the carrots called for by the recipe), plus the red bell peppers, which made for a nice presentation; and instead of sherry, I used rice vineger. The sauce was great and, all in all, it was quite an enjoyable dinner.

I have been making this recipe since it landed in the oct. issue. It is one of my all-time favorites. I add a bit more red pepper flakes ; because I like spice. It freezes very well in individual food containers and is convienient for taking to work.
