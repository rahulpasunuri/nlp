see my username. I worked at the Anchor Bar once... The recipe does not make "Buffalo Wings", as previous posters have noted, ONLY Frank's Louisiana Hot Sauce is used. AND the picture is bogus, as well. Buffalo Wings would never be served with the wing tips.

I agree with Mrobmsu, one must use Frank's hot sauce. This is from the Anchor Bar in "beau flow" where wings originated.

You don't use Tabasco sauce for Buffalo wings. Its equal parts Frank's Red Hot Sauce and melted butter--no tabasco, soy sauce, red pepper flakes, etc. The Frank's Red Hot sauce is hot, but it has a much better flavor than tabasco.
