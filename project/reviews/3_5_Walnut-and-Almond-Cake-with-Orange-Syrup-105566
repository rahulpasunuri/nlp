I had a bunch of leftover nuts from Christmas that needed to be used soon, so this was just perfect. It does take a long time to make, but it's worth it. Very good cake! I forgot to add cinnamon, which I realized only once it was in the oven, but it still had a wonderful flavor (and it smells heavenly when it bakes!). I also simmered the syrup about 5 minutes after boiling it for 2 to thicken it up a bit.

I found this cake to be light and delicious. I served it with a small dollop of whipped cream and sprinkled some gated orange zest over the cream for a more interesting presentation. Not only was it a hit, but every one of my guests wanted some to take home which is rather unusual. It makes a very large 9x13 cake, so I was happy to send some home with my guests. Despite no leavening, mine rose up out of my pan. My husband summed it up with, "This is a keeper!"

I had great success with this cake - never tried anything like it before, so everything about it was a tasty surprise. The texture is perfect - very light and fluffy, nice contrast to the nutty flavor. And the orange syrup added that nice zest, really brightened up the taste. Definitely making this again. Just make sure you find a cheap place to get your nuts in bulk!

With the price of nuts, this was a very expensive cake to make, and not worth it for the results. Taste is similar to a carrot cake, albeit with a denser texture, which works well with the syrup. Definitely better the next day. Served it as the ending to a Greek meal, topped with yogurt mixed with vanilla and honey. Guests ate it, but didn't get my usual rave reviews and no one wanted to take any home.

I cut this recipe in half and used a metal 8X8 square pan. Baked for 35 minutes and it was perfect. I used graham crackers and a microplane for the orange zest intead of grating peel. I was worried about the flavor of the graham crackers, but it was delicious... Served it with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream and everyone cleaned their plates. A keeper for sure!

This came together very easily. I baked the batter in layers to use in a wedding cake and it worked very nicely. Don't be alarmed if the batter nearly fills the pans since there is no leavener except the egg whites. Gerber zwieback (in the baby aisle in the grocery store) come packaged 8 to a bag which is perfect for this recipe and they are nice and light and fresh. Also, I used orange oil vs. the rind in both the syrup and the batter.

I've made many of this type of greek walnut cake with orange syrup but this one is the best. Usually they are very Dense in texture. This one is almost as light as Angel food cake and the addition of ground almonds is a wonderful change from the usual. Also it's incredibly easy to make. I will make this cake over and over.

Being married to a Greek man from Lesbos I am always trying to find new recipes to entertain our guests. This cake was a big hit at one of our dinner parties.
