This was very good and the rhubarb somewhat kept it's shape. However it was "soupier" than I thought it would be. I would cut down on the water for the tea and also up the amount of jasmine tea as it was fairly undetectable. Personally, I would also cut back on the ginger as it was a little too strong.

Beautiful dish. I used Vanilla Sugar instead, and it was wondrous. Also, use less sugar if you so desire, and leave vanilla sugar to sweeten mouthful by mouthful. Also, if you have a chinese grocery or teahouse near you, ask for buddha's tears or jasmine tears tea. It is rathe pricey ( i found it for 14$Cdn for 100 grams) but it provides a _much_ more subtle taste. It is basically nothing but jasmine flower buds. Sooo delicate and beautiful. Word to the wise: do not use frozen rhubarb unless you are prepared to serve this dish as a compote, and not as pieces of rhubarb. If fresh, the pieces of rhubarb will not fall apart as easily as frozen.

This is so fantastic! Very subtle, witha fine tea flavor.It's great with the accompanying Mascapone Cream, and excellent over biscuits, like the ones in the recipe for Strawberry-Rhubarb Shortcakes in the April 1994 issue of Bon Appetit.

I love rhubarb and jasmine tea. This is very easy way to enjoy both flavors. I'm not a big ginger fan, but the flavor is so subtle that it's a pleasant undertone. This recipe seems to make too much to I made about 2/3 of the recipe. My husband thought it was fantastic served over ice cream and had me make it for some of his co-workers.

I had hoped that this would turn out fragrant and sweet-sour, but instead, it was overpowered by the sugar; I couldn't taste the jasmine at all. Also, it wasn't pretty to look at--instead of the beautiful maroon tones that I expected, it was more of an olive drab color. The rhubarb fragmented into threads with the cooking...maybe my next compote will have better success.
