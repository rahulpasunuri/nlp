Made this cake for my husband's birthday. It was a BIG hit. The only family member not thrilled was my 18 year old son who prefers more sweeter desserts. I will definitely make this again!

I have baked this cake twice, and both times the batter overflowed the pan, even though I used a 9" round pan the second time. It makes a lot of batter! So be sure you use the 2" deep pan they recommend, or use a 10" round cake pan. After I put meringue on top, I used a propane torch to toast the peaks and swirls to get that toasted marshmallow flavor. This cake is amazing and simple.

Just an update on this cake....I have now made it about 12 times, and it's always great(always in a springform pan) Recently, I made it for a friend's birthday and realized I had only about 6 tbs of butter on hand - so that's how I made it. Turned out FABULOUS! Make sure you start testing this cake right at the 40 minutes and as SOON as it starts to set up, stop baking! The other interesting thing was an experiment with the frosting - took about half the prepared frosting and added 2 tbs of organic peanut butter. A little gooey, but WOW what a combination! Still my favorite chocolate cake recipe!

I made this exactly according to the recipe for my friends' birthday, and decorated it with sprinkles. Everyone loved it! Very rich, dense chocolate cake with a lot of flavor. I made it the day before, which I definitely reccomend because it was much moister than what it would've been if I had made it day of. And the icing was fluffy and not too sweet and to die for! I would definitely make this if you like the snack cakes, but also if you just love chocolate and marshmallows!

Perfect for cupcakes, bake about 18 minutes. Kids love these, and the marshmallow-type frosting is a big hit, even with us grown ups, particularly if you are not a fan of buttercream. Foolproof, quick and good.

The frosting was fun and different; however, the cake itself was relatively bland and dry. I will not be making the cake again, but may try the frosting on a different cake.

I think this cake really depends on your taste. I thought it was a little dull, but my dad loved it. He prefers desserts that are a little less sweet and I like sugar. The cake was good, but I'd prefer a nice sugery buttercream frosting!

This cake turned out moist and dense - very rich. Would easily serve 9. Wrapped it in plastic and frosted it a day later, per the note. This was my first time making a cake from scratch, and I was concerned about it "falling" given our altitude (6000' plus), but the little it did was covered by the frosting.

This recipe is so easy. It's the grown-up version of a classic treat. The only hard thing is to decide between ice cold milk or a cup of coffee!

I made this recipe for my co-workers yesterday, and it was a huge hit. I doubled the recipe- baked in two 10" round pans. The cake is dense with a fine crumb, moist and dark and flavorful- just be careful not to over bake. I also doubled the frosting. It is absolutely majestic looking and tastes as good as it looks!

I made this cake for charity so I didn't really get to taste it. However, I made a double batch of the marshmallow to make it look more impressive (so it would sell faster) and toasted it on top with a blow torch. I did get to taste some left over marshmallow and it was really good! I got rave reviews from those who did eat the cake. Will definately make again sometime when I get to have some!

This tastes just like a Hostess cupcake. That sounded good when I was reading the other reviews (after all, who doesn't like a good childhood treat?), but after I made it, the cake did not taste any better or fresher and it took a lot more work than just unwrapping one of those foil wrappers. I won't make this recipe again because next time I will just buy the Hostess version and/or make one of the great recipes on Epicurious.

I know everyone hates it when they change recipes into something entirely different. I never made this cake but want to throw out there another idea. For a Christmas dessert I took devil dogs and cut the ends off on a diagonal. I sprinkled each log (8 in a box), with a raspberry liquor then I made a chocolate buttercream frosting and spread each one. I used a fork to make lines on surface of each log to make it look like a log. I stacked these on a plate. Looks like a wood pile. Stick in fridge. Can decorate with powdered sugar, etc. Great festive dessert.

I am thinking of making this for Christmas desert and adding peppermint extract to the icing. Has anyone experimented with adding flavors to the icing?

This hits the mark -- it tastes exactly like a devil dog. I was attempting to cut it into two layers and filling the middle in order to have the devil dog "look". The cake has a fine crumb, so cutting and filling is difficult. I suggest freezing the cake before attempting to split it.

I ate this cake everyday because it was my first from scratch. despite the fact that i couldn't find unsweetened cocoa powder at my local ctown grocery store and used unsweetened chocolate that i had to melt and using a non-electric handmixer, it turned surprisingly delicious. i was most impressed that i made melted marshmallows from scratch. my friends were all delighted!

The cake was good, but not anything amazing. The frosting was excellent - gooey and yummy while still being light, and something kids would love! I don't know what a devil dog tastes like, but my husband says this was very close.

I made this cake for the first time yesterday, and not ever having a devil dog, i had no expectations. After reading some reveiws, I decided to used all milk, and no water. It tastes great! the cake was moist, and the frosting light as air! I made it in heart shaped pans, and put cream in the middle, and on top! yummy!

I made this into cupcakes instead of the cake with the only change being the bake time which was 20 minutes. I highly recommend this recipe--most cupcake recipes are too sweet for my taste and this was just right! I am not a gourmet cook, and friends thought I bought these cupcakes at a cupcake boutique because they came out so pretty with the shiny smooth icing and the cocoa dusted on top. Delicious!

I have now made this cake at least ten times, and we are not even big dessert eaters! It is a terrific cake that can be made quickly. Make it as written in terms of ingredients, but I like it in a round, 9 inch springform rather than a square. I also cut the cake in half horizontally and put half the marshmallow in the center. Also, if you whip the icing longer, you get an incredibly stiff, glossy product that screams "devil dog".

Rating: 4
This is my second time reviewing this recipe. My family is so crazy about the cake that I wanted to share my "tweaks". This time I used a 9 in round pan, which was better. I made the full icing recipe (not half), and cut the cooled cake in half, using half the icing as a filling and half on top. Great cake. Great leftovers.

made this cake for a Sunday dinner desert- I was initially dissapointed with the results, but after the cake set out overnight it improved so much in both flavor and texture I could not believe it. It's not the easiest cake I've ever baked but it is very distinctive and different in it's mixture of flavors. Great for an occasional that calls for something special. The only adjustments I made was to reduce the butter to one stick, still turned out great, and to coat the pan in cocoa rather than flour.

Rating: 2
Dense, moist cake with a good chocolate flavour. I used a 7" x 11" pyrex baking dish, and Pam for baking spray. I also made 1/2 a batch of frosting, in a double boiler setup as described. I liked the cake better than the frosting, but it's a lovely glossy topping. I will make it again, and use more vanilla in the frosting, and maybe something else in the cake. Like a liquor or at least use milk instead of water in the batter.

I baked this with a friend. To fight the "bland" review, we used ample vanilla extract and cream instead of all the water. We also put more chocolate in, adding Bernard Callebaut chocolate drops that melted into the cake. However... the suggested baking time was just a bit too much for our cake and so it came out relatively dry. My suggestion: cream instead of water, extra vanilla, and less baking time.

Made this cake for a party. Everyone loved it except my husband and me, who never eat processed food--we thought it tasted like it came from a package.

Rating: 1
I was a little concerned when I saw that the recipe called for so much water. Now I know why - it resulted in a dry, bland-tasting product with no character. My husband (a dessert junkie) wouldn't touch it after a few bites and I ended up throwing it away. The frosting is a basic marshmallow frosting recipe, so with a bit more vanilla it was salvageable. I would recommend the frosting on a light, fluffy yellow cake or try a different chocolate cake recipe. This was bland!

excellent! I made this for a super bowl party and am planning on making it again. I have never had a devil dog, but it was delicious, and my boyfriend and I ate it all week-- I would say it was more than 6 servings! Delicious and easy

good, i've never had a devil dog so wasn't sure what it was supposed to taste like. cake is def much better on 2nd day which i will consider if i make this again. would also consider subbing coffee or another liquid instead of the water in the cake.

Oh my! I made this for a neighborhood potluck, thinking the kids would like it. But the adults loved it too! The cake was dense and moist, and the frosting is just divine. I prepared exactly per the recipe, mixing it over the simmering water. The texture and taste of the frosting is amazing, and I'm going to use it in sweet potato recipes this fall in place of marshmallow. The batter fit fine in my 8-inch square pan, which is deep. Maybe those who had overflow problems don't have deep pans? I also floured the pan with flour (I forgot the tip about using cocoa instead) and I had no problem with white residue on the sides of the cake. It came out looking absolutely fine. I used all of the frosting on the cake, so when cut, you got a thick slice of cake with almost as thick a layer of frosting. I absolutely disagree with whoever below said this tasted "processed" just like a real devil dog. No way - it tasted "real" to me. This is an easy and delightful cake to make and it will become a standard at my house!

Rating: 4
This is wonderful! I followed the suggestions about the larger pan etc. and used a springform. I, however,have big problems with (any!) recipe(s) that list two sticks of butter - so I gave this a try the first time with about a stick and a half - it was great. Next time, I went to a stick and 1/3 - just as good! So, if any of you want to cut a little fat and calories - this still works! It is great as the days go on!

Rating: 2
Very very dense cake. I realized half way through making this that, while the photo had totally enticed me, I'd never actually eaten a devil dog. That probably explains my not being madly in love with the frosting, which is very marshmellowy. If you like that kind of thing, you'll love this frosting. Cake definitely does improve over a day or two. Don't take the "frost just before serving" thing too seriously - the cake is fine the next day if kept in the fridge.

Rating: 2
The problem with this recipe is that it is REALLY like a devil dog - my kids are so used to real ingredients, etc. - and this truly tastes like it just came out of the plastic wrapper. So for me they were great - my kids were wondering what the big deal was. Next time I'll use the same cake but replace the filling with whipped cream spiked with a heavy dose of vanilla and sugar

Rating: 2
The cake tasted like devil dogs and was easy to make. I used two 8" round pans and I have a convection bake option on my oven which worked well when I reduced the baking time. I would use parchment paper on the bottom of the pans to ensure easy release of the cake. I used the pasturized egg whites with my huge kitchen aid mixer and they were slightly runny. I added cream of tartar and they were able to hold stiff peaks. In general a nice, chocolate cake -- but not too impressive. I'd make it for the kids again, but not for company.

Just great! Definitely use a square pan, not round...it's beautiful and does taste just like a devil dog!

Rating: 4
Very delicious cake, much better after it sits for a day. Notice the recipie calls for an 8" SQUARE pan, 2" high. This is almost the equivalent volume of a 9" ROUND 2" high pan. An 8" round will be too small. Also, I substituted milk for half of the water which gave me a nice moist cake. Can't wait to make it again.

This cake really does taste like devil dogs, especially on the second day. True, it lacks a certain gummy quality, but that's a good thing! I followed the recipe exactly, using an 8 in. square pan and I had no trouble at all except that it needed more time in the oven. I tried what someone else suggested - making only half a frosting recipe, slicing the cake in half and using all the frosting there. That adds to the devil doggyness and I recommend it.

Rating: 0
What a mess! Ignore the pan size recommendation!! Despite my better judgment, because it just looked like too much batter, I put the batter in the 8" cake pan the recipe calls for. I figured the test kitchen had checked it out and maybe it wouldn't rise much since it has baking soda, not powder. The batter quickly rose over the sides of the pan and dripped all over the oven racks and the bottom of the oven where of course it burned. What was left of the batter plus the burned bits scraped out of the oven all went into the trash. A waste of good ingredients and the batter tasted really good, but I was pretty ticked to have to clean out the oven on short notice! I will definitely check the reviews before I try another recipe from Gourmet.

This was outstanding; definitely will be making this one again. Followed other reviewers' advice: dusted the pan with cocoa, and used a 10" springform pan. Raves on the both the look of the cake, and the rich, moist texture. Folks also loved the marshmallow frosting. Can't go wrong with this one.

Rating: 4
This was, as promised just like devil dogs. Use a 9" pan, however not an 8". In the 8" the baking time had to be increased which made it a little drier than I would have liked plus it was too much batter for the pan. Very easy too.

Rating: 4
This was fantastic. It started out a little dry but actually tasted better and moister after it sat. I made a half recipe of the frosting (I only had 2 tablespoons of corn syrup) and that proved to be enough to make fluffy peaks on top to cover. I was thinking when I make this again that I'd cut the cake in half and frost the middle so it's like a delicious chocolate and marshmallow sandwich.

The one issue I have with Devil Dogs is that the cake is too dry. I make this a day ahead as suggested, and found it became more moist as it sat. I cut the cake in half and put some frosting in the center, which was great. As another reviewer did, I used a stand mixer for the frosting, too. Definite do-again cake.

I made this recipe into cupcakes a couple weeks ago for a birthday. The recipe turned out 18 cupcakes, liners were filled to 2/3 and baked for 30 min. I made 1 1/2 times the frosting and initially thought it would be too much. After trying one, I found the frosting to be so light and fluffy, I had to pile on more to each cupcake...the frosting ended up being as high as the cake portion! Everyone loved the cupcakes...well, except my bf, who prefers a less fluffy chocolate cake.

I feel culturally deprived because I have no idea what a Devil Dog is, and wish I had known sooner if this is what they are/were. This cake was fantastic! I made cupcakes and used my own marshmallow frosting. Amazing!

I made this recipe as cupcakes this past weekend for my daughter's 7th birthday. They were a hit and DO taste like Devil Dogs!! I served these to the adults, but made a vanilla cream cheese frosting for the kids (I was nervous about the egg whites) I followed the recipe exactly and baked them for about 22 minutes. After reading about the cake rising a bit, I only filled the liners 1/2 way full.

Delicious and easy cake - and it comes out just like the picture. I made it for the second time last night. I baked it in a 9" springform pan for 50 minutes and it was perfect (I previously undercooked it slightly and it sunk in the middle). The tip about flouring the pan with cocoa rather than flour is a good one. I added 1/4 c. of white sugar to make it slightly sweeter. I did the frosting in the double boiler the first time and in my mixer the second time and noticed no difference. It was much easier to just turn the mixer on for 6 minutes and do other things rather than stand over the stove with a hand mixer.

Delicious and easy! I would recommend using wax paper in the bottom of the baking pan, as I had trouble getting the cake out of the pan wihtout it. I will frost the cake in the middle next time as well. Will definitely make this recipe again!

Simply marvelous and a truly simple recipe. Just use a larger pan. The cake got rave reviews and there was hardly any left for the next day. I will make this again and again!

I made this recipe and doubled the frosting, which proved to be too much frosting. I might recommend 1.5 batches. The frosting held up well over a few hours, so don't worry about frosting it ahead of time (the recipe says to do so immediately before serving). The cake is insanely delicious and really does remind me of devil dogs, particularly the rich chocolate cake.

Incredible! Frosting is fabulous, and recipe is so easy to make. Used convection mode but came out a bit dry (and high) so will standard bake when making again which will be often! Also good tip about using chocolate in place of flour to coat baking pan. This cake is a keeper, simply delish!!

LOVE this recipe. I thought the 8" pan made for a nice high cake. Next time I will cut the cake in half and put some of the marvelous frosting in the middle as well as on top so as to have a better cake to frosting ratio! Very good!

This was a great recipe and the frosting was a big hit. I did find the cake pan was too small (8" square, 2" deep) and had some overflow. Will make again---but in a bigger pan!

This was such an easy fun recipe. I used a dark cocoa instead of regular and it came out amazing. The marshmallow frosting made it taste like a kids treat, but the dark chocolate flavor amped it up to an adult level.

I grew up with Devil Dogs and this is truly evocative of this lunchbox snack, albeit far more gourmet. My kids loved it and so did I. One thing the recipe didn't instruct was that "flouring" the pan should be done with cocoa, not flour. Otherwise the white flour will deface the sides of your lovely dessert.

This cake is awesome. everyone loved it. Very beautiful dark moist cake with an easy to make frosting. I also made another cake that I saved for the next day, but did not notice much change in the flavor.
