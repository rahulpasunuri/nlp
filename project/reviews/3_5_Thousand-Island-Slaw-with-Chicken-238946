I've made this dressing many times (omitting the caraway seeds) and served it over iceberg wedges or tossed with chopped romaine. It's so popular with my friends and family that I finally made a triple batch to keep handy in the fridge.

This recipe has become a summer favorite. Even the left overs are popular.

Used half prepared slaw mix and fresh shredded cabbage. Great for a summer light supper or lunch. Added some color to the plate with sliced tomatoes and stuffed eggs. Very tasty.

I have been looking for a great Thousand Island recipe and I've finally found it. I didn't add the caraway seeds because I didn't have them on hand, but the results were still terrific. A great dressing for just about any kind of salad.

This flavors in this dressing are so refreshing, especially on a hot day. I couldn't find prepared coleslaw mix, so I served it with shredded lettuce and sliced mushrooms as a side dish to barbecued pork. The second time I made it I added leftover chicken for a main dish. My guests cleaned their plates, even my picky 13-year- old who HATES salad. I didn't add caraway seeds, but we loved it anyway. I'll make this again and again.

I only had 1 lb of coleslaw so I made 1/2 the dressing, this was more than enough. Even with the caraway I still felt like it was missing something. I will make again because it's quick and easy and a good way to use up leftover chicken.

I made this recipe for dinner. My husband and I loved it!!! I shredded my own cabbage, added carrots and radichio and green onions on the top. Excellent!!

I made this tonight for dinner and overall it was good. I shredded my own cabbage and carrots and I think it could have used more for the amount of dressing. I would also consider adding some shredded broc stalks, radish, etc to add more flavor, texture and bulk. It would be a good dish to take to a summer potluck.

Wowsers. When it's this hot outside, it's so wonderful to find something this good to fix that you don't have to sweat over. Loved the flavors, loved the ease of preparation. Only bad thing: I had NO leftovers :o) NOTE TO EPICURIOUS: Does anybody proofread your recipes before they post them? I was puzzled by what "shoured" meant until I figured it was supposed to be "shred." Second recipe I've read here today that had a huge misspelling in it.

The 1000 Island dressing was exceptional, and it will be my new stand-by for Crab or Shrimp Louie Salad. This slaw salad was super-easy, since the main ingredients were store-bought. I was timid about using all the caraway seeds, but will definitely include the full teaspoon next time. Truly a 10-minute meal that's great on a hot day.
