This was just hummus with bacon on top of it. There was absolutely nothing party-worthy in this dip.

I used smoked processed gouda in place of the monterey jack which nicely complimented the bacon. I'm glad I havlved the recipe as it gave me plenty of dip.

I didn't have monterey jack cheese or yoghurt, so i used what was on hand. I substituted jarlsberg and ricotta cheese. The jarlsberg ended up giving it a sweeter flavor than I expected, which I balanced with a bit more cayenne pepper. The ricotta made it a bit grittier, so I pulsed my machine longer and got a desirable consistency. I think the cayenne is a bit too obvious and would like to add a bit different bite to it, but I'm not sure what that is yet. All in all, a good recipe for a quick and easy appetizer.

This is a fantastic recipe - I've gotten raves for it ever time I've made it. I definitely add quite a bit of cayenne - part of the "to taste" direction. I sometimes add a bit extra lime juice, too. (To echo someone else, definitely use lime rather than lemon.) I've also made a version of this for some vegetarian friends - to mimic the rich smokiness of the bacon, I used ghee instead of bacon fat & then added smoked paprika (from Penzey's) and substituted chipolte for the cayenne. Nothing replaces bacon, but this is still awfully good.

Have made this several times & always get compliments. Yummy & unusual.

Loved this. I made it without the bacon to cut down on fat and added extra spice. Also made it with garbanzo rather than canellini beans. Everyone asked for the recipe. My husband, who never eats beans, counts this among his favorites. It's become an entertaining staple in our house.

Delicious! I used smoked aged cheddar rather than monteray, and green onions with the bacon on top. Others saying this was either too spicy or too bland should adjust cayenne to taste as the recipe suggests.

Very nice. Mt wife who isn't a bean fan, loved it. As the dip is a tad on the thick side, Tortilla chips or Frito Corn Chips work well. I agree it is better served warm.

Wonderful dip -- the bacon adds a great smoky flavor. I didn't find it too spicy, in fact I added quite a bit of cayenne. I also tried it with a mixture of cannellini & black beans, which is a nice twist, though it's great with just cannellini. I serve this warm, though, rather than room temperature -- much better that way.

hey, not-so-smarts, west indian doesn't refer to west india, but instead a group of islands called the "west indies". st. kitts, the island where the restaurant is that this recipe came from, is one of these islands. review food, not names of recipes, especially if you don't know geography.

This is a great party dip. It tastes great and my guests always love it. I will make this one over and over.

Did you mean West Indiana Bean Dip? I didn't try it, so i'm not knocking it, but there is nothing West Indian about this recipe. How about Bacon Bean Dip?

Good dip although a little spicy.

I've made this a couple of times for parties & it is always a big hit. I love the unique flavor. Be sure & use real bacon.

What is "West Indian" about this recipe? Cannellini beans? Why not pigeon peas? The spices are average- not specific to West Indian cookery. The name is misleading-

This was very bland and had a weird consistency. I would not recommend it.

Very different taste. I would put green onois and sourcream on top too

My friends liked this dip very much...I would add more spice to it, but I thought it was a nice refreshing summer dip. Also I halved the recipe and it was just enough for a few guests.

Ok, maybe I really wanted it to be a refried bean dip. So the next time I am using half as much sour cream and lime NOT lemon. I didn't have to "kick it up a notch". I'm from Texas and we have darn good chili powder.

This dip was good but nothing spectacular. Like other reviewer, had to add extra "hot" in form of cayenne (or could use other hot spice/sauce) to spice it up. It's rather time consuming to make, and I've made about 10 different bean dips so after awhile I tend to use the one that - after all being equal - tastes just as good but is easier to make!

A nice change from "refried bean dip". I used half the beans and my guest thought it was very good. I would put this in my " can't screw up with this one" file. Don't be afraid to kick this up a notch. Stored very well and was good after a couple days as well.
