This was a great meal. expensive but great. I really loved the mint pesto. I was unsure at first but it was really tasty and very easy to make. Much better than mint jelly.

I modified this pesto recipe in a dish of my own invention and it was wonderful! I doubled the recipe, used more mint than called for (my garden is overflowing!) and added roughly a cup of pine nuts and a few ounces of grated parmesan before blending. I put that over boiled tiny new potatoes, tossed with some cherry tomatoes and served as a side dish for grilled lamb sausages -- a huge hit!

After pricing out a rack of lamb, it cost $80 to make when you tie all 4 sides together.

Like other reviewers, I've made this only with leg of lamb instead of rack of lamb. I love the marinade and the potatoes. I deglazed the pan that I used to brown the roast with about 1/2 c of red wine. I added the drippings after I sliced the roast and reduced - WOW! I liked the mint pesto, but I don't love it enough to justify the amount of work. The recipe makes a lifetime supply of mint pesto. I froze numerous 1/4 c containers (enough garnish for 4 servings) which works well. The reason the mint pesto is bland is too much olive oil. I recommend that the olive oil be cut to 3/8 c. Also, you may want to cut back on the red pepper ... a dash of cayenne would be enough, even though I love spicy food.

I have to agree with TxDoula - this was totally bland. I was looking for an alternative to the rosemary, garlic, sea salt rub I normally use. Just goes to show that sometimes you need to stick with the classics.

I love this recipe!! Every time I make it, I get rave reviews. I think it is unfair to rate "part" of a recipe as the last two reviewers did.....looking at all the wonderful reviews....I don't think theirs should be counted.

This dish came out very well for our Easter dinner. I made the mint pesto the day before and let it sit overnight in the fridge. I also substituted lime juice for lemon juice (didn't have any lemon). The mint flavor came through very well. The lamb was juicy and very tasty.

I am reviewing the sauce only as I paired it with another lamb recipe. I have been cooking almost exclusively off of this website for 3 years now, but have never registered. My family disliked this sauce so strongly that I registered just to rate it! The mint flavor was almost non-existant. Overall, very bland, waste of expensive ingredients.

Only rating the sauce, I felt the flavor of the oil and lemon overpowered the mint. I ended up adding some cider vinegar and a touch of dijon to bring up the flavor and then cut cherry tomatoes into the sauce. It was better after that.

Fantastic. We served 5 with 2 1.5-lb racks of lamb (modest portions required by our modest wallets) but doubled the number of potatoes to make sure no one left hungry. The lamb required nearly twice the specified cooking time. The mint pesto was wonderful; we had it over fish and chicken for the next few days to come.

I have made this 3 times in the last month ... absolutely d-lish!! I do however modify the recipe oh so slightly ... I use Yukon Gold taters (as I prefer them to 'new') and to the divided portion of the marinade for the potatoes I add the juice of half a lemon.

I was a bit disappointed in this recipe and would make another version of Rack of Lamb next time. I felt there was too much oil in the marinade. In fact, I added more mustard to keep it from separating.

My husband adores lamb so I made this last night. I was in a hurry and couldn't find racks of lamb at the store so I just used a boneless leg of lamb. I thought it was delicious. My husband said it was the best lamb meal he'd ever had...quite a compliment from a man who's had lamb all over the world. I give the meal three forks, he'd give it five if he could.

To "Don't French the Lamb": Must have been a sight to see - you and all your guests sitting around the table gnawing on lamb bones to get to the little bits of meat on them.

Because of cost, I did this with a 1/2 leg of lamb for 4 people (approx. 3.5 lbs.) It was a hit! I seared the leg on the stove top, then surronded it with the very small potatoes and baked in a 350 oven for about 45 minutes until internal temp read 140. This worked well as the potatoes took same amt. of time. The meat was pretty rare, but that is what my guests wanted. I had a lot of leftover sauce, though. Everyone loved the sauce, but I think next time I'll only make 1/2 recipie. Tonight I think I am oging to marinate some pork chops in the loeftover mint sauce and then grill to use it up. The

Don't french the lamb. The meaty parts between the bones are the best parts when roasted.

I serve lamb a lot and this recipe sounds wonderful.... however, I am really interested in those "lish" cookies!!!

I like the recipe very much. In fact I have been making lamb for years in a very similar way - using bread crumbs, crumbled thyme, a little salt, plenty of freshly ground black pepper and a dash of garlic powder made into a paste with virgin olive oil - and spreading this mixture onto the lamb racks and onto slightly hollowed out tomatoes with the tops cut off. I sometimes place 1-2 sprigs of fresh rosemary and several unpeeled, crushed garlic buds under the rack for aroma.

This works with a leg of lamb, too. The potatoes soak up the drippings - awesome.

WHOLE FAMILY LOVED IT CAN'T WAIT TO MAKE IT AGAIN

Wow! These cookies were wonderful! Added a little extra hazelnut for more flavor. They were absolutely yammers! My friend, Trish, came over, had one and said they were simply lish! Quick and easy was right!

Wow - best lamb I've ever had. The potatoes were fabulous as well. The marinade is absolutely fantastic and the mint pesto is completely optional. I'd have to say that I did not care for the pesto at all, but then, I'm not a very big mint fan.

Fabulous!! Made it for company last night and everyone raved about it!! I agree, the mint pesto was wonderful! And the potatoes...WOW!! It's the best rack of lamb recipe I ever made! I look forward to making it again.

DELICIOUS!!! I didn't have time to brown the lamb before roasting so I poured the olive oil/mustard/garlic mixture on top of the racks and let it marinate at room temperature for one hour before roasting. I roasted it for 20 minutes at 450 and then continued to roast the potatoes another 15 minutes while the lamb "rested". Rave reviews from everyone! I served it with the sauteed sugar snap peas and radishes and it was perfect!

I am not a big meat eater, but the mint pesto made me want to eat lamb every night. The potatoes were delicious and easy - will make those again soon! Followed the suggestion and served with asparagus (and a spring salad) - lovely Easter dinner!
