I made this because it's a fast, heathy meal using ingredients I had on hand, and it got good reviews. But it is really boring. I used spicy fresh young mustard greens, extra garlic, and crushed hot red pepper, and threw in some excellent cherry tomatoes at the last minute, but even so we felt virtuous for finishing our bowls. Might have been the whole wheat pasta...

YUMMY! I used more garlic and omitted the onion (mainly because I didn't have one!). I also added a small can of diced tomatoes with the chicken broth. I added italian seasoning and red pepper flakes before reducing the liquid. I used fresh spinach and mushrooms, and substituted navy beans. Topped it with a extra sharp white cheddar.

I had to make adjustments based on what was in my cupboard, so I don't want to skew the ratings. I would probably give it a 2 (good but not special) but at the same time would be likely to make it again since it's pretty easy. My adjustments: 1/2 onion, 2 garlic cloves, only 1/2 c broth, 1 cup wilted (somewhat fresh, not frozen) spinach. Added 1 link of spicy chicken andouille sausage. Next time, I would want more spinach and broth, but I'd probably keep the reduced amounts of onion and garlic.

I made this exactly and thought it was very good. It's light and I would even reduce the amount of pasta ratio to veggies.

This recipe turned out really good! I substituted white beans, and used MINI farfalle, instead of the normal size. I also added shredded, grilled chicken, and a little bit of spicy italian seasoning to help the flavor. My 12 month old daughter gobbled it right up! I like that it has healthy ingredients, and they were all in my pantry. I will definitely make it again.

this was an easy week night dinner that used items that i had on hand. it wasn't spectacular and i just ate some leftovers for lunch. the flavor was not better, as i had hoped. i used cannellini beans after reading the other reviews and added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes and a handful of halved grape tomato pieces for color. overall, easy, affordable and basic...

I thought this was easy and delicious. I used frozen chopped spinach and just used 1 cup of broth to save time on the reduction part.

After reading the reviews I was prepared to add more flavor to this dish. I added about 1 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper and 1/2 tsp. dried basil. I also used cannelini beans instead of garbanzos and lots of freshly grated parmesan. My husband and I both thought it was very good. The kids, however, being wary of anything involving spinach, would not try it.

This dish is one of my staples, I could eat it every week. I add some turkey sausage and it makes a world of difference! Whole wheat pasta and fresh spinach obviously also are great.

Remember a Richard Olney recipe somewhat similar. Okay, as to blandness, I added 2 T chopped pimiento, 2 T chopped cooked mushrooms, 2 sliced link-sausages cooked. I agree, too much chicken stock. Probably used more olive oil. Pasta stars. Earthy.

I thought this dish was very bland. I followed the recipe exactly except I added chicken. I won't make it again.

I was suprised at how tasty this dish was. Sometimes the simplest things are the best. The chicken broth made the difference; it added flavor where water would have made it bland. The only thing I would do differently would be to reduce the chicken broth further than I did, which was approximately half. Otherwise it was pretty good.

I liked the dish, it was quick. I used the condensed broth, and skipped boiling for whatever minutes. I thickened the sauce with cornstarch. Next time I will substitute chicken for the beans, my family did not like them, and I will double the spinach as well.

A good basic dish, but it needed something. Maybe next time we'll try the feta cheese suggestion, or the red pepper flakes ... but that sort of defeats the low-fat purpose, doesn't it?

I made this for me and my boyfriend and it was delicious! I substituted the cannelli beans for the chick peas. I also added the feta cheese before serving and we were very impressed. There's certainly plenty of taste (unless, of course, you're only used to consuming alfredo-type sauces!) I will be makiing this again for sure!

Though I added cracked red pepper as suggested by others this dish was still very bland and boring, wouldn't bother again!

Absolutely delicious!! It's easy to make, low-fat, great tasting, and original. I always use fresh vegetables, so I used fresh spinach instead of frozen. Also, since I love garlic, I used around 7 large cloves of crushed garlic. I will definitely be making this dish again and again in the future!

This is a terrific recipe, simple and delicious. We've been enjoying it regularly for a couple of years. I double the spinach and use locatelli cheese instead of parmagiana. The frozen spinach is soooooo much easier than fresh that it's worth the slight loss of flavor that might result, and it means that you can make this recipe without running to the store for any fresh ingredients.

i would think it much better if fresh spinach was used

My kind of dish - quick and delicious! I used a bit more spinach, and cannelli beans instead of the chickpeas, and added a shake of red pepper flakes. Also, I used a combination of shells, mosticelli, and rotini, which the sauce could stick to more easily. Probably would be good with feta cheese, too.

We used fresh spinach and also added a bit of chipotle pepper (1/2 of a small one)a bit more oil and cheese.
