I make this soup several times each Fall and Winter with 2 noted changes. I make my own chicken stock with the carcass of a roast chicken from the previous night. I remove most of the meat and add it at the end really just to warm the chicken through. I also do not use rice, but egg noodles instead. I boil the noodles separately and add them to each person's bowl so that they don't soak up all the lovely broth, and so they can be saved for bowls of soup in the following days.

I've made this soup a number of times when either I or my boyfriend were sick. To develop the flavor I like to use a chicken carcass (either left over or from a takout rotisserie chicken) and then add the cooked chicken later in the process. I also use egg noodles instead of rice and add them towards the end of the cooking. Of course, I remove the carcass before serving but I find that it provides a much more rich flavor to the chicken stock, especially if it's not homemade.

I was sick and wanted chicken soup. I didn't want to make a big project of it and so I opted for this recipe. I add and extra carrot, bay leaf, dijon mustard and some Secret Aardvark hot sauce. I left out the rice and added the udon noodles at the end. Just as I was wrapping things up, my boyfriend come home from work and exclaimed that out apartment smelled like a Jewish Deli. That meant something, since he worked in a Jewish deli in his youth. This soup isn't Bubbies but I made it in a fraction of the time, and we both loved it.

My 9 year old son and I picked out this recipe. He wanted to make it for dinner. It's a very simple recipe so it was perfect for him and everyone at the dinner table rated it 3 to 3 1/2 forks!

This was a good base recipe to start with. I was disappointed with how bland mine tasted, despite using top quality ingredients, so I added some dijon mustard, a few bay leaves, some peppercorns and a spoonful of a mushroom buillion paste. I know that this is changing the recipe quite a bit but the end result was delicious. A great soup for a cold night.

Great soup. I did follow others' advice and halved the rice and thyme. Came out perfectly. Very tasty to all ages and inexpensive and easy clean up!

My daughter wasn't feeling well and I was looking for an easy and quick chicken soup recipe. This fit the bill entirely -- it so easy to make and the flavor was really wonderful. I used Swanson's organic chicken broth and substituted cilantro for the parsley. Yum!!!

This was a good, simple and basic recipe. I don't know why the cook from rhode island thought it was terrible. I can hardly taste the garlic. I didn't measure the thyme so I don't know how much I put in. I kind of combined this recipe and mom's chicken soup recipe

This is a great recipe for basic chicken & rice soup. I made it as written except for two changes - I added some peeled, diced potatoes because I needed to use them up & I reduced the dried thyme to 1 full teaspoon. I know from past experience that to much thyme can make things taste like medicine (& who wants that?). This was great for my young daughter because the veggies were nice & soft and the ingredients are simple. After I pulled out a serving for her, I did add a little salt, & pepper to the remaining soup for my husband & I. Perfectly simple meal & great with warm rolls. This isn't a "wow 'em" type of soup - this is one where you just enjoy the flavor meld of the chicken, rice & veggies exactly as they are.

I made this soup for my husband and he loved it! I did make the soup with egg noodles rather than rice. We ate it with sourdough bread and a salad. It make a great meal for lunch or a lite dinner.

If I could describe this recipe with just one word, It would be YUCK!!! First of all, WAY to much rice. Secondly, WAY to much garlic. And third, WAY to much thyme. It was a big letdown!

I have made this soup several times. It is simply wonderful, the best simple chicken soup I've ever tasted. I omit the Thyme because my daughter does not like it, and it is still wonderful. My entire family loves it.

We always called this "cheater's soup". Fast and you can really add whatever you like to it.

This is a great, no-hassle, throw-it-together recipe for a cold winter's night. I've made it several times now and my husband and I love it! Added a peeled, diced potato last time, and I would suggest cutting back the rice by almost half or it gets really, really thick. I also cut the thyme in half and add some dried sage. Yummy!

The flavor of the soup was perfect. We did cut the rice in half as one rater suggested. It wasn't enough. We also cut the dried thyme down to one teaspoon and that was plenty. The recipe couldn't be easier and we loved it.

I hate to be one of the low raters amoung so many high raters of this recipe. I would reduce the rice by half - it came out like rice soup - like a big mush. I kept adding broth until I ran out of broth to add. Also, I thought the thyme was overwhelming. I like thyme but didn't really like it in this recipe. My husband, who had a cold, thought it had a weird taste. I did like the easy preparation and might make it again with less rice or with noodles and maybe no thyme at all.

mmmm...you can do anything with this soup! I made mine spicy, and I swear it dissipated my cold instantly!

This is an easy recipe and makes your house smell cozy! I first cooked chicken breasts in the oven with lemon pepper, then added to the soup for a light pepper taste. Needed to add more stock after first servings. Incredible the second day!

Yummy. I used curly noodles instead of rice, since I didn't have enough rice in the cupboard. Just added them at the end so they'd have 10 minutes to cook. I also increased the liquid a bit, but I don't know if that was really necessary. We ate it for days!

I added a few more spices and Maggi bouillon cubes which only enhanced the flavor. I also substituted brown rice. Everyone asked for the recipe.

OUTSTANDING and so simplely quick. I have made it no less than 12 times usually after we have a chicken one night then use the scraps to make soup. The only thing I do different than the reciepe 2 cups less of broth and I ad some mushrooms. IT IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS!!

This was awesome. A definate repeat. Added a diced potatoe and cut back a tad on the thyme. I happened to have some leftover rice and added 15 or 20 minutes before serving.

This is very, very good, and couldn't be any easier to make! I think I will try substituting egg noodles for the rice, which would make it an even quicker dish to make. We'll definately be doing this again.

God Bless the Dad who came up with this recipe! It's simple, and oh-so-yummy. I love it! To make it even simpler, I often add uncooked chicken directly to the pot a few minutes before everything is done cooking. (This might be a food-handling no-no, but I haven't had any problems yet.) I also replace the rice with egg noodles, only because I always seem to have lots of noodles around.

I have been making this recipe for several years, especially after Thanksgiving. I make a stock of the turkey carcuss, then make the soup. Obviously, instead of chicken I use the left over turkey meat and replace the rice for egg-noodles. Just cook the noodles in a seperate pot, drain, then add to soup when done and enjoy!!!

This is a nice variation on a standard chicken soup I have been making for a while. It is still pretty plain, but definitely comfort food.

I definitely would make this again but I, as others, did change a couple things. That's what makes this recipe so delightful. I didn't have any cooked chicken so I took about 3 or 4 chicken breasts and sauteed them in a small amount of bacon fat and liquid smoke. After the chicken was done I sauteed the celery, onions and garlic in the remaining grease. For children, 1 tsp of thyme (dried) might be sufficient. I also used linquine instead of rice, as well as baby carrots instead of sliced. I would reccommend this recipe to anyone who wants a lift after a cold day. Yummmmm!

Great, simple and flavorful recipe! i poached the chicken in water,peppercorns,bay leaves,onion,garlic,carrots & celery; then i cut them up into small bite size pieces and added it to the soup pot. i also added chopped tomatoes, without seeds, and it tasted so wonderful! also, i combined chicken broth with vegetable broth and some beef broth; it had a great taste to it! also, i didn't add the rice, i cooked pasta shells in a separate pot and added them in individual serving bowls with the soup (adding pasta or rice with the soup tends to make the pasta/rice really mushy, which i really hate!).

This was an excellent after work dinner, I threw everything in a pot on the woodstove, added thin noodles the last ten minutes, and dinner was ready when we were, with no fuss or tending. While I really enjoy cooking, some nights are so hectic its nice to have a meal that "makes itself".

I wouldn't use any rice next time--just vegetables. Cook the rice separately, and throw the carrots in a little later -- I like them soft, but not that soft.

Terrific quick dinner! My children were able to help put the ingredients in and, even though they weren't thrilled when they put in the onions and celery, when they tasted it they both agreed that we had to add more veggies next time. Serve it with crusty bread to soak up all the extra broth!

FAST and DELICIOUS - DH and 3 FINICKY KIDA LOVED IT!!My DH was ill tonight, and rather late, announced he'd like to have chicken soup to "feel better". Having just returned from a trip, we had NOTHING in the house... I made a mad dash to the market and got 2 large cans of chicken broth, the veggies (I added corn and Chinese pea pods) and a roasted chicken. At home, I followed the recipe very closely, just adding the pea pods after turning the soup off and letting them "heat up" a little. Also, I did not add the carrots and celery until the broth was already boiling, as we like our veggies crunchier, even in soup. Will probably make this one once a week! FAST and DELICIOUS, and Dh is already "feeling better" Thanks for posting this quick and dirty version of soup!!
