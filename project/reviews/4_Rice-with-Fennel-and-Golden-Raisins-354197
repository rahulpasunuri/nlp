I made this as written with the exception of using a red onion, and served as a side to the Salmon in a Bengali Mustard Sauce, also on this site. This would be a nice pilaf with any Indian main. Be sure to cook the onion and fennel till almost carmelized.

I made this with chopped dried apricots since I don't like raisins as much and it was delicious. Very delicate, but comforting.

This was good but didn't have a wow factor - it was missing something. But I would make it again.

Perfect!

I enjoyed the rice, but I felt as if it was somewhat lacking in flavor. Mostly it was just sweet from the fennel and raisins, but not many others pervaded. Maybe next time I'll add some contrasting spices to liven it up a bit.

Delicious and goes well with so many recipes. I will make this many more times in the future.

This rice pairs beautifully with the black sea bass/olive salad (associated menu). I used fennel pollen rather than seeds (pollen is more intense, so adjust measurement.) The final product was aromatic and pretty on the plate. It holds its own, so I will try it with poultry, pork, and beef, too. A keeper.

Great rice recipe. I used basmati, and it turned out delicate and fluffy. Had to substitute regular raisins in place of golden, not as pretty but worked well. Served with the Black Sea Bass with Tomato Salad and some broccolini for a delicious dinner.

uber easy and quite delicious. My CSA delivered a fennel and I'd never cooked with one before. I watched a video on how to clean and chop one on youtube (in which a woman hilariously referred to the fronds as "prawns") and a quick half hour later had a gorgeous rice dish that I wouldn't even tweak the recipe on. Make sure you use basmati rice....nom nom nom......

I was making a Mediterrean style fish soup and the recipe called for a potato but we didn't have any. In order to thicken the soup and add some flavor I used some of this rice which I had leftover and frozen. Wow! It worked great and the fennel and raisins worked great with the fish and tomatoe broth. Now I am going to make sure to make extra every time to have some on hand.

Delicious! My husband loves anise, fennel, licorice, etc. and I've been trying to find an alternative to his favorite Rice Pilaf, so I thought this would be a perfect dish for him...he LOVED it! I used Jasmine Rice (that's all I had) and I think it added a nice sweet character to the rice...This was simple yet sophisticated. I will make it again and again.

I have just eaten a portion of this and found it definitely on the yummy side. OK for the time of cooking too. Ate it with a vegetarian burger type thingy and found it all lovely. My wife loves fennel too and now I have another way of using it. Even my son liked it! HOwever I used Italian tround rice and treated it like a risotto...

Yum! This was a great way to change up rice with just a few extra steps. It was good in the days after I made it, too.

Great side-dish for pork, chicken and fish, and the flavor just improves by the day (we're now on day 3, and still enjoying it). Foolproof fancy rice.

All I can say is WOW! This is a fantastic dish, I was quite dubious as I had not cooked with fennel before but I will certainly be keeping this recipe and no doubt cooking it again and again. Yummy Yummy

Mmmm... this was really good. I had never cooked with fennel before and I really liked it as did my husband. My young children didn't really think it was great, but they ate some of it. I made this with a Yogurt, Lemon, and Paprika Marinated Chicken. It was a nice side dish. I also made the kiwi-sorbet with it. This all complimented each other very well. The only thing I would change is that I would chop the fennel bulb more finely. My pieces were about an inch x 1/2 an inch. I'd dice it more finely next time.

Fantastic! I made this side dish for dinner with a roasted chicken and my finicky husband who likes his rice plain usually ate 2 helpings! The raisins and fennel balance perfectly. This will be a new regular addition in my weekday repertoire.

This was very, very good. We grew fennel for the first time this year and this is a real winner. I served it with roasted veggies. I am going to use it when my vegan son visits, maybe add a little fideo to the mix.

This was almost as easy as making normal rice, yet so much better tasting! Definitely good to use basmati and just a little orzo. I made this dish with a delicious Steak and Olives (also from Epicurious), and the rice almost out-shined the steak! I will definitely make this one again soon!

This is an excellent side dish (I had the left overs for breakfast...). I will add a few more raisins the next time I make this as a personal preference. The cooking time of 22 minutes was amazingly accurate. Enjoy!
