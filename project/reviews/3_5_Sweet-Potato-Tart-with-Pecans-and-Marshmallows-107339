This was a great variation on pumpkin pie. In fact, my family thought just that! The crust was a great find for this and I used half and half in place of the whipping cream since I was out of it. I also substituted walnuts for pecans. The marshmallows didn't stay white like in the picture but, rather, melted to just give the tart added sweetness.

My marshmallows floated to the top, but the tart was yummy. Next time I think I'll cut down on the sugar by a third and it will be perfect floating marshmallows or not.

Really good. after I read the reviews about the marshmallows rising and it not looking like the picture, I modified it by adding more sweet potato to make it more firm and just left out the marshmallows to put it all over the top before I serve it. I love the crust. It was very time consuming though with all the cooling and chilling. Sheesh. I'd make it again..

I was out of pecans..so I used toasted walnuts instead, but the small change I made in this, was to add almost a half cup of milk chocolate chips on top of the marshmallows and walnuts. MMMM...it tasted like a s'more sweet potato pie :) I also had a problem with some of the marshmallows rising to the top, even though I coated them in powdered sugar beforehand. Made no difference anyway, it was scrumptious! :)

All right, I admit, I was looking for a Christmas side dish, not a sweet. So, I left out half of the sugar and doubled the amount of sweet potatoes. It was fabulous! They raved about it. It's definitely a keeper.

To keep the marshmallows from turning into foamy goo, toss them in powdered sugar or cornstarch before pouring the sweet potato batter on top. This is one of those food tricks that get left out of magazine recipes... a lot...

Agree with all other cooks. It will never look pretty. But the taste was awesome! I will make again for sure. I was making 4 desserts for my dinner party so I bought a Pillsbury crust instead of making this one for the tart. Still turmed out great and an easy adjustment it you are crunched for time.

I agree with the other cooks that the pie didn't look like in the photo, but it was the biggest hit of Thanksgiving at my house! Everyone adored it and just loved the unique sweetness of it. I have already been asked for the recipe and to make it again.

This crust is labor intensive, but ultimately worth it! Though I seemed to spend the entire Thanksgiving day making this dessert, it was a super hit, and will definitely make it again.

Mine too came out looking nothing like the picture in the magazine. I don't see how the tart can bake without the marshmallows melting into the potato and rising to the top. Regardless of how it looked, it was very good and enjoyed by all.

I did a dry run on this tart prior to Thanksgiving. I followed the recipe exactly, however mine did not look like the photo. The marshmallows ended up floating to the top and bubbling up. It didn't look as pretty, but it sure tasted wonderful. I'll try it again.
