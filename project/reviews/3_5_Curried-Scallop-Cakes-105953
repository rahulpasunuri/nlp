These were delicious. Next time I will have a partner to help though. Difficult to make the cakes and cook them at the same time.

Huge hit!! I chopped up about 3/4 of the scallops and put about 1/4 in the cuisinart. I used regular breadcrumbs for the general mix and then rolled in panko, and I chilled for 4 hours. They held together perfectly. I came back from India a few months ago and had an Indian dinner party -- they were the favorite!!

I had 1 lb of crab meat that I needed to use so I adjusted the recipe accordingly and used 2/3 of the required ingredients. Next time I'll cut down even more on the dried mustard as the flavour of the crab was a little overwhelmed by the mustard flavour. Otherwise, it was absolutely fabulous.

A gem of a recipe; have made it several times and find I can't skimp on the egg-yolk sizes if I want them to hold together. Sea scallops aren't always available so I've substituted bay scallops (equal weight).

My company really enjoyed these scallop cakes with the curry twist. My first time using panko and I will never go back to regular breadcrumbs - wow what great crunch! I did add half the egg whites too and had no problem with the cakes stayin together.

Since I made these with dungeoness crab which is plentiful in our area, my rating is for the rest of the recipe only. I don't know how it would be with scallops. The scallops available today weren't fresh, so I didn't purchase. I had no trouble with these falling apart. I did, however, use far less oil (olive oil) than called far. I made sure it was very hot, and cooked these much longer than called for because I made mine entree size. Watch them and turn when golden. My husband, a curry lover, thought these had just enough curry in them. I, also enjoyed them. Served with a mango/peach salsa and a tomato/potato salad with lemon olive oil dressing from another site. It was a delicious meal. If using scallops, I think the key would be to cut them up pretty small in order to hold them together well. Do the same with the green onion. I used whole egg, not just the yolk. Make sure to really squish these into a firm ball before making these flat for frying. They will stay together much better that way. Refrigeration of the mixture for the hour is essential.

I couldn't find scallops or Panko so I used canned crab, and Italian bread crumbs. I had a little trouble getting them to stay together during frying, in my case though I think theywere a little dry. Too much breadcrumbs? They were perfect for a curry night, and they reheated well. My husband referred to them as a 5star hush puppy.

Although the flavor of this dish ws excellent, the cakes simply would not stay together making cooking and presentation difficult. If I were to cook it again, I would try some tips suggested by other cooks.

Rating: 3
These was very good and served to rave reviews. My only problem was that the cakes did not all stay together very well. I'm not sure if my scallop pieces were to big, or I didn't pack the cakes tight enough. I'll try some variations to try and get a better result next time.

just a shorte note.... Seems like one must often let fish, rice, potato stuffed foods rest (and chill) before frying.

My first batch fell apart while cooking, so I made a new batch and pulsed the scallops in the Cusinart before mixing in the other items. I used a small cookie scoop and it made quick, uniform balls. The result were delicious, light puffs. Excellent.

I suspect the secret is using fresh, high quality scallops and making sure they are dry. The rest time seemed to be important, don't rush this one. And Panko crumbs were really good. I will use them more often.

These were good but not great. The flavor was fine, and though they were fragile there was nothing disastrous about getting them to stay together (had to be eaten delicately however). I guess I was just expecting something more from such great ingredients. That and I may have over-cooked them a bit--they never quite got golden, just went from raw to deep brown. Not enough oil?

Omigosh....I was so nervous while making these! Even though I followed all the suggestions, I kept thinking they would fall apart or not taste right. All for naught! They were AWESOME! And everyone at the party loved them. They were the first to go. Definitely a repeater!

This was my first attempt at making any type of crab/scallop cake and they turned out great! I used panko and chilled the mixture well, fried them a few hours ahead of time and reheated.Served them appetizer size with a mango salsa and got rave reviews. Next time I will add coconut and not chop the scallops quite so fine. I was concerned after reading how they tend to fall apart that I think I overdid it and lost some of the great scallop texture and taste. I usually don't like curry but these were fabulous. Can't wait to make them again!

I had a litle difficulty with this dish. My scallops were partially thawed when I made the dish. I used the food processor as someone suggested and that worked great. Followed the recipe exactly and chilled the mixture. It was very soft and the first few did fall apart in the oil. I think, because the scallops were not totally thawed, that there was more liquid than expected, so I added some soft bread crumbs and two egg whites. After that they worked perfectly and my guests loved them. The oil has to be very hot. I made a lime mayonaise (mayonaise, zest of a lime, juice of half a lime, and a fourth of a teaspoon of lime oil) as another person suggested and that disappeared, too. The flavor is not too strong in my opinion; I used exactly the amount of spices in the recipe. Definitely a keeper.

I just made this recipe and was somewhat disappointed. I followed suggestions to help keep the cake together and it didn't quite work out. The second batch came out much better than the first though. The reason I think is that the oil was much hotter with the second batch and also I left them in much longer than suggested more like 5-8 minutes each side. The scallops surprisingly were still tender and the cake looked exactly like the picture. The main problem besides having the first batch fall apart was that I found that although the flavour was okay the curry left an aftertaste and I thought it was very salty. Although I am giving it 2 forks I did find it alright and it certainly is easy to make it just didn't make me go gah gah like it seemed to do for other reviewers. These days you can buy better appetizers for about the same price.

I made this for a Thanksgiving Dinner appetizer. A few of the guests were "Pescetarians" -- vegetarians who eat fish. They absolutely raved about the scallop cakes and begged me to send them the recipe. I would make this dish again in a heartbeat. It was so simple yet elegant.

Absolutely fabulous. I think it's key to chill for an hour; the cakes came out delicate, crispy and not at all crumbly. Husband waxed poetic over them.

I LOVED these. They were a huge hit. I followed the recipe exactly, except I was out of panko so I used organic bread crumbs. They held together well. I've used panko with numerous versions of crabcakes and had a hard time keeping them together. Maybe with breadcrumbs to shape and then panko on the exterior to get that nice look and crunch would be the best of both worlds.

The big hit of my party tonight. Even the ones that didn't hold together were eaten. Served with a wasabi sauce which really added a nice touch.

They were good, but not great. Followed the recipe with the exception of: used whole eggs, added coconut to the coating, and baked instead of fried. The combination of flavors (cilantro, curry, etc.) smelled great, but it didn't necessarily translate to the taste. Added some chutney as a topping, and that was nice, but still something was missing....not quite sure what.

Rating: 3
I too found the flavor to be great but that they didn't hold together very well. I will take the earlier advice of processing and refrigerating the mixture next time.

I followed the recipe exactly except I used Italian breadcrumbs. The flavor and taste were excellant, but I found the cakes did fall apart. I made them 4' diamater. Next time I will use whole eggs, and chill the mixture and also make the cakes smaller. I made a mango salsa for on the side and got RAVE reviews. I am using this recipe for my catering business and am sure it will do well. Thanks again Epicurious for a wonderful recipe!!!

FABULOUS! I took the advice and used the food processor. Had friends over for dinner and they loved it. Making them smaller size for an upcomming cocktail party and have no doubt they will go over. Try and get the Panko if you can - it does make a difference.

I thought these were great! I couldn't find panko, so I used plain bread crumbs instead. I refrigerated them over night and cooked in the morning, they held together fine. I just reheated when guests arrived and everyone enjoyed them!

much easier and just as tasty way to make these: arrange on a buttered pan, drizzle the tops w/a little melted butter, and bake at 350 for 10 min on each side. I mixed alot of unsweetened coconut with the Panko and it was great.

Absolutely delicious. No problem with the cakes coming apart so long as the cakes are amply refrigerated and the scallops diced small enough. Not too small, though, or the juicy plump scallop flavour and crab cake-differentiating texture could be lost. I served these as an appetizer on Christmas, and my mother, who had professed to dislike scallops, adored them. I will add these to my list of standard appetizers for future parties.

These are wonderful. I sliced the scallops and decided that the pieces were too big so I then cut each slice in half. Next time I will chop the scallops into smaller pieces. They tend to fall apart.

These are out of this world! I took the other reviews advice and used the food processor for the scallops. I decreased the curry powder to about 2 tsps. I used the panko which was great! I got a lot of compliments on these. I used whole eggs and let the mixture sit over night in the refrigerator. They held together fine. Made them in the morning and reheated them before the guests arrived that evening. My husband and I just finished them off today (2 days later) for lunch. I also used the lime mayo recipe below. They were great!!!!! I'll definitely make this again.

I made these cakee last night, and they were great! Following the suggestions from other reviewers, I chopped my bay scallops in the food processor and served them with the lime mayo. I used regular bread crumbs and whole eggs rather than just the yolks. I think this may be the answer for crumbly cakes, as mine held together and fried up perfectly. I also kept them in the fridge for 2 hours before frying. Will definitely make these again!

I wanted these to be served as a passed hors d'oeuvre at a dinner party and they were a bit too crumbly. Since the taste was incredible (with the full amount of curry!), I want to give these another chance. Any suggestions?

I have been making this recipe regularly for a year and a half, and we STILL get excited about it! The panko really is best, but I have also used purchased and home-made breadcrumbs with great success. These are a necessity at parties now, and I have directed people to this site more times than I can count. Make sure to chill the mixture well. It really does wonders in forming the cakes. We serve them with a lime mayonnaise that my mother-in-law uses with stone crab. The lime offsets the curry perfectly! (Mayo, lime juice and zest, a little Worcestershire, and Tabasco for zip.)

I would rate this a 10!!! I doubled the recipe and chopped the scallops in the food processor. Perfecto. I also halved the curry and put in 1-1/2 teaspoons for the double batch. It made for a nice subtle flavor Next time I will make a day or 2 ahead and refrigerate and just warm them up when the company arrives. I served this as an entre at a yearly brunch yesterday along with Island Pork Tenderloin Salad (the salad was served in a bowl on it's on not under the pork, cauliflower gratin, honey giner glazed carrots & smow pea & green bean salad. For desert....key lime pie & strawberry shortcake. The best brunch yet.

I have searched high and low for a good crab cake recipe, but I don't need one anymore. I think I much prefer these scallop cakes! They were fantastic. I made a few changes: I omitted the cilantro; used Fat Free mayo; added coconut flakes to the mixture; and adjusted the amount of panko (I ended up blending in more and more until I thought the consistentency was more firm.). We ended up with perfect, sweet, deep flavors. We try not to fry often, even if these weren't greasy, but I can't wait for another excuse to make these! Ooh, I'm making myself hungry!

They were great! I kept switching between this scallop recipe another almost identical one on this site. The other had some coconut in it, and I thought that it would be great with the curry in this one so I added some sweetened-shreaded coconut to the panko breading (not inside the cake). It added just the right amount of sweetness. The fried up perfectly, and I'm not even good at frying.

I thought it was very good, although I would agree with others that you don't need so much curry. I'm glad I only added half the amount in the recipe, because it came out just great.

Very good, everyone devoured them. They are difficult to shape - you need to squash them together. The breadcrum "clumped" together. Next time I'll mix everything well, then toss in breadcrumbs. If scallops are too big, cut in half, then quarters.

Made these for a New Year's Day party and received rave reviews. A great way to add a spice and interest to an array of hors d'oervres. Chopped the scallops finely as others suggested and didn't have too much trouble with them falling apart. The key seemed to be hot oil and tightly forming the cakes before rolling in the Panko. Prepared them the afternoon before and reheated for 10 minutes in a 375 degree oven. Absolutely a winner!

Rating: 3
These cakes were very flavorful, we all enjoyed them. My cakes were not even close to falling apart. I followed the recipe exactly. Possibly the reviewers whose cakes fell apart used all 3 1/2 c. panko in the cakes instead of just 1 1/2 c. called for in the write up. will definitely make these again.

I made these for a Christmas party I was having. I liked the "do-ahead" idea. What a disaster! They fell apart and $16 worth of scallops evaporated in my fry pan. I'm an experienced cook and can't figure out what I did wrong- other than perhaps not dicing the scallops small enough. I managed to salvage about 15 of the cakes and served them with a thai chili sauce. I'll try again with some of the suggestions I see here.

Made this for our Oscar party - everyone RAVED. really nice scallops helped, and i think the panko is essential. If you have trouble finding it, look in the asian food section - it's mass marketed in a green box. Saute carefully, they do tend to fall apart. And, yes, you can make them a few hours ahead - just reheat on a cookie sheet in a 350 oven for 5 minutes or so. I formed them 6 hours ahead, refrigerated, fried them about 2 hours ahead, and reheated after guests arrived.

Interestingly, I couldn't get Panko prior to making this recipe. But the reg. bread crumbs worked just fine. I had no problems--my didn't come close to falling apart. My cakes were well-chilled. My father who doesn't like curry--loved this dish. I making it again for Christmas.

These will not fall apart when cooking if you chop the scallops into 1/4 dice as directed, and if you chill it long enough. I made them entree-size and they did not fall apart. I think they needed a bit more flavor - next time will add more scallions, cilantro, mustard, curry powder, S&P. I served with mango salsa. Everyone raved.

The taste is great. Like many others, mine fell apart--I should have read farther into the reviews before making. MY IMPORTANT QUESTION: if I make them in advance for a party, will they taste as good when I reheat them. Thanks.

I made these for my 50th birthday party. They were a hit. I would definitely go for the panko again. While they'd still be yummy, I like the crispness the panko gives. Easy to make ahead. Just roll into balls with a real light touch and put in fridge for an hour. Saute carefully and they will not fall apart. A sauce would be nice, but we served plain as finger food. I had a few left over and heated them in the oven the next night and put on a salad with baby lettuces and a nice vinaigrette. RH

I think I had some problems with this recipe. My scallop mixture was so full of scallops that it didn't stick well together. When I cooked them they ended up falling apart. Not sure what I did wrong. Everyone liked them even if they were no longer finger food. Flavor was good. Would try again and perhaps use less panko in mixture.

Rating: 4
As it turned out, none of the people at the party like curry and aren't overly fond of crab cakes. That said, I assumed this recipe to be a total waste. I was quite surprised when the largest detractor wandered into the kitchen looking for more - they were all gone. This is the best testament that I can give to the wonderful flavours and textures of this recipe. Cook with confidence!

I searched for recipes to serve at my 40th birthday party. As a caterer and avid cook, I wanted to put a menu together that was unique, tasty and easy to eat. This recipe was outstanding. The panko breadcrumbs were lighter and gave a nice crunchy texture. I will keep this recipe in my file for future catered events!

I was very pleased with these. Although, I did not have panko on hand, we just used Progresso seasoned bread crumbs. They were very light and tasty. Held together nicely too, and we did not even refrigerate first due to time shortage. Will do again!

A different dish, easy to make, and loaded with flavor -- you have to like curry and cilantro, however. Definitely use the Panko, not coventional bread crumbs. I made these into nice sized cakes for a main course but they obviously could be made smaller for an appetizer.

I thought the panko made these a little dry, and hard to keep together. I added some melted butter 1/2 way through. The second batch came out better than the first. My husband and company loved them, I felt they were a little to dry.

I would certainly make this again (it's delicious!) but would take readers' advice about chopping the scallops finely and letting them sit, shaped, in the refrigerator for at least an hour before cooking....mine came apart. Here's the perfect sauce for them: 1/2 mayonnaise to 1/2 Dijon mustard plus a GOOD shake of Old Bay Seasoning. You can make this by the Tablespoon or by the pint for all kinds of seafood, but especially fried seafood. When my husband started making this we called it "Better-Than-Tartar-Sauce"

I made this recipe almost exactly as written, except I shaped them into 6 large cakes and served them as an entree. They turned out to be perfectly seasoned, beautifully golden, and light as a feather. Even better in many ways than the idolized Maryland crabcake. I refrigerated my mixture for an hour, then refrigerated the cakes for an hour before frying in 1/4 inch of peanut oil. Cakes held together perfectly and kept a nice, crisp coating. Panko breadcrumbs are a must. Drain briefly on paper-towels then serve with basmati rice and cucumber/yoghurt salad.

Absolutely divine!!!!!!!!! One of several appetizers I made New Year's Eve, and this was by far the best.

Rating: 4
This is a terrific dish. I made it twice over the holidays because people raved so much about it. You must dice the scallops finely. If they are too large, the cakes will break apart easily. Also, when you are forming them in your hands, don't be afraid to squeeze them together firmly and don't flatten out the "balls" too much, just a little bit & they will hold up just fine. I thought about a dipping sauce too but they were so good all on their own I decided against it.

Rating: 3
To the cook from Rochester, I have had my share of failures, but through trial and error ... I always chill (at least an hour) any type of meatball/patty first regardless of recipe instruction. I find this way there is less chance of them falling apart or the crumbs flaking off. Sometimes when you reheat them, the crumbs will fall off if steam is produced during the reheating process.

Rating: 2
The flavor was great but they fell apart as they were being fried and turning them over in the frying pan was difficult to do without breaking them. Wish I knew what to do so that they would not break at the frying stage or as you took them out. They also fell apart as they were being lifted out after being reheated in the oven!!!!

I'll make this again. Be careful not to chop the scallops larger than 1/4", they'll fall apart. They are fine without a dipping sauce or chutney. There were only 2 of us so we had leftovers, they were ok re-heated in the oven the next night.

Just a question: did anyone serve these as an hors d'oeuvre with a dipping sauce of some kind--something to pass on a platter? Or do they stand alone nicely? I am interested in making them for new year's eve. Thank you.

Actually, 3.5 forks would be more accurate. My guests rated this as "sublime." I did make it ahead, and the cakes reheated beautifully. I paired it with a mango papaya chutney I found on ths website - also wonderful. Definitely a keeper. Be warned, however - when you fry the cakes, the curry really smells up the kitchen, and it lingers.

Absolutely delicious! Discriminating appetizer connoisseurs found them irresistible. Easy to make with wonderful contrasting textures and delightful spiciness. A light, tasty alternative to crab cakes.
