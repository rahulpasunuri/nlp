This is a simple and yummy sandwich. I sauteed the onions a couple of hours before dinner, then just warmed them up at serving time. Since it is summertime, I grilled the steak.

This was a very bigger winner at my house! I used sirloin steak instead of ribeye and it was so tender! My son asked how soon before I cook it again.

I followed the recipe pretty much as written, except at the end I put them under the broiler with some pepper jack cheese. This helped to hold them together. My husband and I both thought they were yummy. I rated this recipe with 3 forks because it only took about 20 minutes from start to finish and I love that.

Tasty and easy. No problem with the red onions - they were sweet after sauteeing them. I used sirloin, because i'm not a big fan of all the fat in a ribeye. Enjoyed the horseradish mayo, but ended up adding more plain horseradish to my sandwich.

Made this last night and they were delicious. I only made about 1/2 of the horseradish/mayo mixture, as I was afraid of that much horseradish. Also used less onion than written, as our red onions are SO hot. Next time I might increase the mayo mixture to about 3/4 of what is written, and try a small sweet yellow onion instead of the red. Subbed fresh spinach for the arugula. Very large and satisfying sandwiches. Do try them!!!

This is a keeper! These sandwiches are so good and the horseradish mayonnaise is just terrific! I will be making these again and again. Plus they are so simple!!!
