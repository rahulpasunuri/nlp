This is the best meatloaf I have ever made! My partner doesn't stop talking about how delicious it was. I omitted the bacon on top and reduced the amount of salt as other reviewers have mentioned. The meatloaf was easy to prepare and sooooo moist! With the prunes, carrots and celery it helps one with their daily dose of fiber too!

Made this almost as written (omitted the salt and no bacon on top) and it was fantastic. Meaty, moist and full of flavor. Required no glaze, served with an aujous gravy. Leftovers were excellent as well. Definitely worth repeating!

WOW! This is really, really amazing. I have made this many times, and have had nothing but rave reviews. However, in the interest of full disclosure, I tend to be a "more is MORE" gal, so I did add a bit more of the herbs, worcester sauce, garlic, etc. to the meat. I have also just made it with leftover hamburger (without the other meats), and it was equally as good. My boyfriend ate most of the TWO loaves I made even though he was already "stuffed" (it was that good), so I froze the leftovers. Well...the next night he was begging for -- you guessed it! I didn't like serving beef two nights in a row...and tried to steer him to his other favorite: shrimp scampi. No go! The point is...is that I just nuked the frozen meatloaf in the microwave for a few minutes, and it was just as good as if I had just made it and taken it out of the oven. This recipe doesn't call for a topping, but sometimes I brush the top with a baste of ketchup, worcestershire sauce, and honey (or agave nectar). I think this would also make a great appetizer for a party as mini meatballs with the dipping sauce.

Could not bring myself to add 1/2 lb. of bacon (I was making 2) so I left it out and it was still wonderfully moist and flavorful. I have stopped buying celery for the small amounts needed in a recipe and substitute what's on hand. This time is was kale.

I have made this recipe a few times and it has been great every time as written. The last time however, I only had beef and really liked the flavor better without the mix of meats. Also added a simple gaze of fig jam for the last 15-20 of cooking and really made the rest of the flavors pop!

Very good meatloaf- I used my husbands homemade bacon and omitted the breadcrumbs and parsley because I didn't have them handy. When it went into the oven I mixed some ketchup, brown sugar, Worchestershire and a dab of yellow mustard and kept that over a low flame until the meatloaf was cooked- Yum! Will definitely make again.

My new go to recipe for Meat loaf. Did some subsitute since I made this at the last minute. Used panko soaked in the milk, dried cranberries instead of prunes, mixed ground beef with pork sausage, mild turkey italian sausage and veal. Really moist but held it's shaped well. I put on a glaze of ketchup, hot pepper jelly and worcestshire. My husband and son said it was the best I have ever made. I have been married for 28 years so we had meatloaf many times over the years.

Just try it! I did it exactly as indicated, and it was absolutely great. Very, very moist. I made a double recipe as some reviews suggested, but didn't have two bread pans hand, so I used mini-loaf pans for the second batch. They were a bit overcooked, but still so moist and delicious. This just bumped out the family fave meatloaf on the first night! No changes needed!

Hubby and I love this super flavorful recipe. Not my Pops meatloaf for sure. Bit time consuming, but I make a 1.5 X recipe - which makes 2 loaves, eat one and freeze one. Can't always find ground pork at the store so I sub mild italian sausage when that happens. I brush on a "glaze" blend of ketchup, spicy mustard with a tablespoon of my 18 yr. balsamic. Yummo! Oh, my Pops loves this meatloaf, but he will never spend the time to make this one. This is a keeper recipe!

What a great recipe! I can finally have meatloaf with my husband, who never seems o like it. This was phenomenal. I added a little white wine to the veggies when cooking. I also used 1 lb. of pork, 1 lb of Beef, and 1 lb. of Veal. I upped the ingredients a little bit, and divided into two loafs, which kept cooking time down. I added a glaze of Ketchup, worcesteshire sauce, chili sauce, brown sugar and jalapeno jelly..this was amazing. My husband had three pieces, and could not stop talking about it. He even called his mother in Italy to rave about it! This is the ultimate compliment, because she is the true Italian mother that can make anything beautiful, and taste great. This is one of my new favorites. I served this with Yellow Spanish saffron rice and some petite peas. DELICIOUS!

Wow!! Amazing! My first time making meatloaf and possibly my second eating it! I used a mystery mince I had in the freezer, I think it was pork and it turned out deliciously regardless. I did top it with a mix of BBQ sauce and tomato paste after reading a few reviews and am glad I did as it had the aroma and taste I remember from childhood and complimented the slight sweetness of the prunes. Yum!! Also added an extra egg and cooked in two 9in. loaf tins-perfect fit!

Wow! I wanted to have an All-American meal. But how to make it special with meatloaf? This was the answer. Very tasty and moist. Quite a few had seconds. Wouldn't change a thing. As usual I made it all ahead the day before and then cooked it the night of the party. Worked out perfectly.

I made this for dinner last night. It was good but I felt that it lacked..."umph". During the last 20 mins, I added a glaze on top of the loaf to give it some color. I'm glad that I did because it not only give it some color but the extra kick that it needed. I mixed tomato paste, ketchup and a Japanese Tonkatsu sauce...which is a sweeter version of the American steak sauce.

I searched for the highest rated meatloaf recipe and this came up. I just didn't think from reading it that it could be that great but decided to give it a try. OMG - it's delicious! I was worried about the prunes (no one in my family is a fan) but they were unrecognizable in the meatloaf as I did make sure to chop them superfine in the food processor. I think it is the secret ingredient that made this such a moist meatloaf. Well and of course the bacon! Yum - this went straight in to the recipe box and is now my go to meatloaf.

This was delicious the first time I made it and followed the recipe exactly. But honestly, it was just too, too rich for my 58 year old body to feel good about. Here's the good news. I have since made it with ground chicken and only 2 slices of bacon in the mix. Surprise! Equally delicious and feels so much better. Makes a darn good sandwich the next day too.

I'm not crazy about meatloaf - at least I wasn't before I found this recipe. I didn't have the allspice, had golden raisins instead of prunes, was out of celery and carrots (made stock yesterday), and did have a burning desire not to go to the store. I decided that, if it wasn't good, I'd blame my pantry and not the recipe; no blame to be had here, anywhere. My husband had seconds and seriously considered thirds. This is now my go-to meatloaf recipe, and I'm looking forward to the next time we have it. Who knew?

Ahhh yes, meatloaf! So retro. And I know being a kid in the 60's and a teen in the 70's, just how many times I was forced to consume a tough slab of packed beef that could take a person out, should it become air born and hit one's head! Not anymore. Moist and tender, delicious.

I made this the night before my dinner party. Immediately after it was finished, I tried it and was not impressed. The next day, I warmed it in the oven and it was amazing. The flavors were intense and layered. It was definitely a hit. I also made a glaze of jalapeno jelly, ketchup , and Worcestershire sauce...it wasn't necessary for this recipe but did add a savory kick.

I have to agree with the consensus, it's amazing. And I don't like meatloaf, but my husband kept asking. Made as is -- as suggested by some other reviewers, I added bacon strips to the top before baking, and I served with a side sauce, basically deglazed the pan with wine and added a little ketchup and honey. It was fabulous. The teen-aged son groused a little about carrots, but never suspected the prunes :)

I have never been a meatloaf fan. Most meatloafs I have tasted in the past were a bit dull and dried out. However, my husband loves meatloaf so every few years I look for a recipe that will please us both. This is a sure fire winner! The prunes and bacon give it incredible moisture, taste, and just enough sweetness to think, mmm - what was that? I have made it several times since first discovering this recipe and will make it tonite for us. It is supposed to be a rainy, stormy nite and perfect for comfort food :)

Finally, at the age of 54, I have a fantastic meatloaf recipe. I really think the secret is the prunes & bacon, NO to the reviewer who asked if the prunes give it an odd texture. By the time you process the prunes with bacon it's more like a thick paste anyway. But the flavor! Just so tasty, my sons ask for seconds, never did that for any other meatloaf I tried. I prefer shaping mine into a loaf in a pan & cut salt a little.

Rating: 0
Not a review, just a question. Does the addition of prune introduce an odd texture? Seems that there could be sweet, chewy bits in the final product. Didn't want to review until I actually tried it. Have spent many fun hours reading reviews for dishes like this that go sort of... "I made this and it was terrible, of course, I am a vegan so I substituted tofu and porcini for the meat, Cilantro for the bacon, apple juice for the milk (lactose free), hummus for the butter and kiwi for the eggs. Also eliminated the bread crumbs to make it gluten free, and since I couldn't find local prunes, I substituted bean sprouts. Completely eliminated the salt as well, and I baked 10 min at 100 degrees to reduce the carbon footprint of my meal as well. Other than that I followed this recipe exactly and I thought it was a disappointing meatloaf. One Fork."

Loved it so much the first time I made it, did it again and got rave reviews by everyone of my guests who ate it. And easy, easy, easy. And quick. I did make a substitution though, since I have to pre-order from my butcher ground pork, which I never get around to doing. So instead, I take the meat out of 2 big or 4 small mild pork sausages. I also cut the salt in half to 1 Tbsp since there the pork adds a lot of salt. But tastes great! I think the prunes really made it amazing.

An easy substitution is to finely chop/food process 1-2 tart apples in before cooking the carrot/onion mixture, instead of using the prunes. Makes a fairly flavorful meatloaf.

I made this instead of my usual meatloaf recipe and was very happy with the results. The minced prunes were a delicious and unexpected addition that I can't wait experiment with in other applications, and of course the bacon amped up the drool-worthiness. That being said, I'm giving it three stars instead of four because of all the extra steps, time, and labor involvement. I've had plenty of other meatloaf recipes that were equally as good and less than half the work, so I'm not sure I'll make this one again.

Rating: 4
OMG! This is to-die-for! And I've never been a meatloaf fan. Like others, I used golden raisins instead of prunes, all ground beef, and subbed turkey bacon. I skipped the allspice and glazed with ketchup. Reminds me of meat loaf served in the cafe at Neiman Marcus. Slightly tangy-smoky-sweet and savory.

Rating: 4
I chose to make this recipe based on the positive reviews. I, too, recall the comfort of my mother's meatloaf -- my favorite bit being the baked-on ketchup on the top of it. So I was determined to find a better recipe that spoke for itself. This recipe exceeds the review. The only thing I did differently was to use my grocer's meatball mix which is ground veal, pork, and beef. OMG!!! Fabulous, worth the preparation time, and a definite keeper. If you love the idea of meatloaf but were never impressed with anything you've tried before, you MUST try this one. It was fun to put the prunes and the bacon in the food processor together. The bacon's smokiness comes through in the finished dish, and the prunes are barely detectable -- just a slight hint of sweetness throughout. Enjoy!

Rating: 4
I've always felt that meatloaf was one of those foods that really isn't very tasty - what we love about it is the memory of eating it as a child, and the comfort factor, not so much the taste of it. Both my husband and I couldn't handle each other's childhood family recipe - I mean don't we all have a different one? So we decided to find a new one all together and start a new family comfort food. This one is it. OMG, SO GOOD. This recipe is a total winner. Yes it's involved, but it is SO, SO worth it. The prunes - perfect level of sweetness. The tang of the vinegar is just right. Cooking the veggies adds a nice texture and flavor. Very moist. It's perfect. The first two times we made it, we skipped the bacon, and it was delicious. Tonight I had bacon, so I put it in there and it took it over the top. Gourmet meatloaf. I love this recipe. FYI - we haven't made it mixing in the ground pork, just beef, and once with 1/2 beef and venison, but otherwise, pretty much followed the recipe fairly closely. Sometimes missed the celery or parsley, if we didn't have it.

1st time i used pitted cherries because thats all i had and it was great (though the small ones loved the flavor i guess they did not like the texture of the cherries.). Made it today with 2lbs mix of veal pork and beef. This time I had the prunes and pureed them as much as i could. Amazing.

Incredible! I used 1 lb ground turkey and 1 lb ground buffalo, excellent flavor. I did not have prunes, but had dried dates which tasted perfect combined with the bacon.

Loved this. Had a previous meatloaf recipe from Gourmet magazine that I've used for the past 10 yrs. Tried this based on popular reviews. This is now my go-to meatloaf recipe. I was reluctant about the prunes, but glad with the addition as it adds some sweetness against the savory ingredients. I did deviate and basted the uncooked meatloaf with ketchup - it always comes out as a nice carmelized glaze.

This is my new favorite meatloaf recipe. I had to use dried cherries instead of prunes, but that was fine.

I prepared this meatloaf last month exactly as the recipe calls because I believe that is the only way to review a recipe. With that said, it was ok. I grew up eating traditional meatloaf with ketchup and I really didn't care for it. What I did like about the traditional meatloaf though was the often sweeter side to the edges of the meat (probably ketchup). When I saw the ingredients and prep time for this, I thought it would be worth a shot. It was good but not great. The flavors just didn't come out well. I prepared it again this past weekend and made several substitutions including venison, sweet potatoes, rasberry vinagrette, dried cornbread stuffing and a touch of brown sugar. It was really, really good and did the trick for my tastes. If you'd like to try it, I put the recipe in my recipe box.

Oh, so good! I just made this meatloaf and it was absolutely delicious! I didn't end up with the large amount of fat that was visible in the photo - in fact, there was very little fat. I think that was probably due to using only beef, no pork, other than the bacon combined with the prunes. I used only 2 lbs organic free-range beef. Two other minor changes were Panko breadcrumbs and I reduced the salt by 1 teaspoon - everything else was per the recipe. As other reviewers have remarked...the husband said it was the best he's ever had. Of course, served with mashed potatoes and sautéed greens. Looking forward to making it for company!

Despite all these changes it was so tasty! Would definitely make again.

I have never made meatloaf in my life, but had an inkling for a diner style meal. This is a very special recipe. Not at all comparable to the dry meatloaf that needed sauce some may have had before. I substituted the whole milk for 1%, as that is what I had in the fridge. It was still fantastic.

I usually don't have prunes in my pantry, so I've made this recipe substituting raisins and Craisins... both times with excellent results. Also... since I'm cooking for two, I make this recipe and put it in 4 mini-loaf pans for the freezer. My husband LOVES this meatloaf. I do, too!

I have to say, I didn't much care for meatloaf before this. Now it's one of my favorite recipes! I don't use the prunes or the bacon, and sub in a half lb of plain sausage in for the extra half lb of beef. The sausage makes it extra greasy, but we just drain it and I can cook the meat until 195° without fear of dried out meat. Used only one tsp salt and panko breadcrumbs as well. EXCELLENT!

Didn't like this at all - rather than a meatloaf it seemed like a fruitloaf. I made it exactly as written (rare for me) as I wanted to achieve the same results of raving fans. I think it was the prunes - wish I had used golden raisins. My husband didn't like it either and he wonders why I keep deviating from "tried and true" recipes - because I'm bored with those. Oh well, another meal that will sit untouched in the frig until I toss.

This recipe, while somewhat time consuming to prepare, is SO worth the effort. The flavors are much more complex that the standard diner fare meatloaf with just a hint of sweet in the background. I did not have prunes on hand so subbed dried apricots nor did I have allspice so subbed cinnamon. I will try it again with the called for ingredients but the product was wonderful with the subs. So far, I have shared the leftovers with three coworkers and all have asked for the recipe. Take the time, it is worth it.

I omitted the bacon and added about 1.5 tsp of salt, and it is still way too salty. Otherwise, it's very flavorful. If I were to make it again, I would use slightly less than 1 tsp salt. It's really annoying to cook a recipe with too much salt...not much you can do to fix it.

Great recipe. I doubled it with the following changes based on what I had on hand: all 80% chuck ground beef, substituted plumped golden raisins for prunes and Chinese 5 Spice for allspice, added 2 jalapeno peppers to veg saute and forgot the garlic. It was baked free form on a 12 x 18 sheet pan and took 1 hour 5 min at 350 deg. Outstanding flavor and texture. Family loved it and I will definitely make it again.

I made half again as much (3 lbs meatloaf mix, so had beef/pork/veal). Only changes were out of necessity due to missing items in the pantry. No celery, used unsulfured apricots (and less than called for) in place of the prunes, and threw a chunk of fresh lard in the veggie pan, since I had no bacon. That said, I don't know that I'd ever do the bacon..it was amazing like this! Only complaint..not enough leftovers today, I may have to fight for my sandwich. This is now going to be my standard meatloaf. Oh, yes, this makes an amazing outer "crust" without adding any glaze or sauce.

Absolutely delicious! This elevates meatloaf to something special. I made a couple of small changes to the recipe: addition of ground veal to beef and pork mixture and some fresh thyme.

Best meatloaf I've ever had. Didn't have prunes so I used sun dried tomatoes instead (about 1/4 cup) and was a great substitute. One word: don't use the food processor for everything. Definitely chop the onions/carrots, etc. Keeps it chunkier, which is good given the other food processed ingredients.

My kids absolutely devoured this recipe. It goes well with the purred cauliflower. The pork and the prunes add a lot of flavor

Exceptionally well balanced with few substitutions: more veal, less beef, cider in lieu of vinegar, and whole grain breadcrumbs. I made 2 small loaves, melted/broiled sharp cheddar over the top once complete, and served with a mushroom-marsala sauce reclaiming a portion of cooked fats to integrate the flavors. Next time I'll probably add mushroom to the mirepoix and use a meatier bacon.

As all previously reviewed, this recipe is truly special - like something you'd get in a restaurant. Delicious and complex. Followed the recipe to the letter only used polish sausage instead of ground pork (which may have been TOO oily, but it was still absolutely yummy). Only advice is back off on the salt a bit.

SO GOOD! Not having the best memories of my mother's loaf of meat, I was still craving some good meatloaf over the weekend. I read the reviews and decided to give this recipe a try and, WHOA. This is some seriously good meatloaf. It's definitely not for people watching their waistlines. It also makes amazing sandwiches the next day. My husband and I couldn't stop eating it!

YUM! So incredibly tasty. I tested it out on 4 family members and they all said it was great (even my incredibly picky 3 y-o ate it!). I love the addition of ground bacon! I love everything about it! Oh, and I stayed quiet about the addition of prunes (used organic prune baby puree) - my family would balk at it - this really added an extra oomph to the dish for sure.

My husband and I are not meatloaf fans but I had left over ground veal and pork so thought a meatloaf would be good for a change. I thought, if I can't find a decent recipe on epicurious then there is no such thing as good meatloaf. Based on the reviews this is the one I tried. Since I had veal and pork I used that along with 1/2 lb of beef. I don't think it really matters what kind of meat you use. Anyway, other than that I stuck to the recipe. We both loved it. we are converts, at least for this meatloaf. The striking thing is the wonderful smoky flavor from the bacon coupled with the sweetness of the prunes both of which really shine through. If you don't use these two ingredients, you are not making this meatloaf. It was stupendous.

Best meatloaf ever. Left out the bacon, used whole wheat bread and soymilk. Cider vinegar 2 TBSP, worcestershire sauce 1TBSP.

This is very good meatloaf. I did make a few substitutions- no preserves though- LOL! I used red wine vinegar instead of cider vinegar and left out the bacon. I actually measured amounts instead of eyeballing as usual. I'll make it again with a few changes. i felt like I could taste the worcestershire sauce. I would reduce or maybe even eliminate it and use balsamic vinegar for the acid/ sweetness and depth of flavor. I might up the garlic. My husband wonders if the prunes could be increased as well. I am looking forward to sandwiches tomorrow... nice bread and some thin slices of red onion.

Made this using 100% venison, otherwise to the "T". My daughter freaked over the pieces of bacon fat (from the bacon) in the recipe and wouldn't eat another bite. It seemed a bit too sweet to me (for meatloaf). Both my husband and I liked it, but we all prefer my good old fashioned plain meatloaf. We eat a lot of amazing things from my kitchen and was suprised this just wasn't over the top, but it wasn't. Not on the remake list, but was nice to try something new.

183 reviews, rated four forks?! I was optimistic, but slightly skeptical. I was wrong. This meatloaf knocked my socks off. I never knew that sentence could be possible. The secret has to be the prune/bacon puree. It gives the loaf a meaty sweet flavor that you can't quite put your finger on.

Wonderful recipe and I would serve to anyone; made without changes (except for whole grain bread. I found chopping up the bacon and prunes in the processor made a goooy mess so since then I now slightly cook the bacon and chop it by hand with the prunes. This makes Makes a very large loaf, so I slice it up when cool and keeping one portion to eat cold on the morrow, I then freeze the rest in individual portion to stop me skoffing the lot in a couple of days. cheers and bon appétit !

Delicious! My modifications: I don't like celery or parsely, so I left those out. Instead of bread crumbs, I used oats. Instead of whole milk, I used almond milk. Instead of prunes, I used dried cherries. And I just plain forgot the allspice. :) Despite all that, it was delicious, although my husband thought the texture was a bit too soft for his taste. Highly recommended.

Loved it. Omitted prunes (because I just didn't happen to have those on hand), and added an extra half pound of grass fed ground beef, and it was still excellent. Even my husband, who usually loathes meatloaf, liked it.

I friggin love this meatloaf. I've made it once before with ground turkey and low-fat milk. The bacon and sauteeing the carrots and onions before. Oh man. Just absolutely delicious. The milk did upset my tummy, but I'm about to make it now and just soak the bread crumbs in chicken stock.

MMmmm I love this meatloaf...this is the 3rd time I have made it. First time I made it exactly as written, it was great. 2nd time I made some changes...too many it came out a bit dry. This time around I used 1 lb beef, 1/2 lb pork, 1/2 lb turkey breast...I cooked the bacon a bit till slightly crispy in spots...this also adds a nice smoky flavor I feel. Otherwise everything as the recipe states....I feel this is such a favorful, juicy, satisfying meatloaf, with the slight sweetness of prunes is happiness. Made potato and turnip gratin ...and simple steemed kale. Completely satisfying.

Rating: 0
I followed the recipe almost to the letter - the changes I made were... No bacon, just because from reading the ingredients it sounded like it would be rich enough without it, and I was right. If the reviews that say this was too rich, greasy or salty put you off, just skip the bacon. I doubled the allspice, and also used about 1/8 tsp of grated nutmeg; it seemed like it would go with the hearty/savoury theme. This worked really well. If you want to try it with nutmeg but only have pre-ground, use about 1/4 tsp. And lastly I forgot to buy prunes, so I substituted 1/2 cup of sultanas, soaked in boiling water for 15 mins then drained and finely chopped. The onion and celery I chopped very finely, and I grated the carrot, because I was worried if there were big chunks of vegies it would make the loaf too crumbly and not hold together properly. As it turned out it was still too crumbly. A couple of commenters have said that using oatmeal instead of breadcrumbs keeps it more together, so I'll try that next time. Apart from the crumbliness this was an amazing meal. Tangy from the W sauce & vinegar, juicy from the pork & dried fruit, savoury from the beef & nutmeg. To all those commenters complaining about it being too fatty - did you even bother to TASTE the fat? I know it's hard in our Anglo-American food culture to view anything fatty as good, but the stuff that oozed out of this meatloaf was OUT OF THIS WORLD. We ate it as a condiment with the potatoes I roasted in the pan and some steamed broccoli, but you could turn it into a gravy with a splash of beef stock, some wine & flour, or save it to toss potatoes in before roasting them. Seriously, don't waste precious pork fat. Those of you who who threw the fat in the bin: there is a special hell for you.

There's something about this recipe! It must be the prunes - you can't even taste them when the loaf is done. I combined buffalo meat with pork, and I think I put some ground turkey in there, too. Anyway, if you keep the ratios in there, it comes out winner - everybody had 2nds and 3rds

Two forks means good. And yes, this was good. Quite good. Two and half forks! I followed it to the letter, but thought it was merely good. I didn't taste the prunes. Maybe I will try adding more. The bacon flavor was very strong and made a lot of grease. (I used Oscar Meyer). Maybe I would try half the amount. I like using oats in my home recipe. Maybe I would add those next time. I'll fiddle with it some. We liked it. But it didn't wow me the way it did so many other people. : (

excellent! made it tonight when i only wanted to use what was on hand--cold and rainy and didn't want to go to the market. made it in a half quantity only using ground beef, substituted raisins for dates and store-bought bread crumbs for fresh and dried parsley. it still came out delicious and was very easy to make--most "difficult" step was cutting the veggies. this is a great enhancement to your basic meat loaf.

Sunday Jan. 17, 2010 in San Diego I adapted this to copy the Gorgonzola Chicken Meatloaf served at the Daisy Cupcake restaurant on Atwood Ave. in Madison, WI Did not use bacon, prunes or any other kind of meat except ground turkey; DID use about 6 oz. of gorgonzola cheese; Used ground turkey - 2.5 pounds; Baked in muffin tins and round casserole 350 degrees for about 30 min. for muffin tins 350 degrees for about 40 min. for round casserole.

This recipe worked brilliantly. I did not like the idea of prunes, so I substituted raisins. There was no ground pork left at the grocery, so I substituted the contents of two uncased italian pork sausages. The end result was delicious - my 7 year old cleaned his plate. That's worth 4 forks alone!

I was only able to use what I had on hand for this, so I missed out the bacon and worcestershire sauce. But with a little added tomato paste and balsamic vinegar, the result was fantastic. The prunes really added the necessary plummy richness to make this shine above other meatloaf recipes. Can't wait to add the bacon next time!

Delicious recipe for basic meatloaf. I used ground buffalo (bison) instead of the beef, and Canadian bacon instead of regular bacon in the meat mixture, and cooked the vegetables in olve oil, but otherwise followed exactly--mine might have been leaner, but that is what I wanted, since some meatloaf recipes I have tried have been kind of greasy. I was a little dubious about adding prunes, but they worked wonderfully with the other seasonings and the pork. Great texture and flavor. Can't think of anything I would change!

This is one fantastic meatloaf and definitely a keeper. A smash hit. I will not hesitate to make this again for company again (first time with family) and I really do not understand the few negative reviews. I have never written a review about food before, but I felt I had to add my two cents here. I followed the recipe almost to the letter, but for the substitution of dates for the prunes. It was beyond all expectations--the texture was incredibly moist, succulent, and the marriage of flavours was just fabulous. To my delight, the leftovers were even better the next day. I rarely make meatloaf because I associate it with childhood recipes that were doused with ketchup. This recipe is in another league altogether--a gourmet quality dish, in my view. I cannot wait to make it again and my mouth is watering just remembering the taste from a few nights ago.

I loved this meatloaf. Actually used it to make sliders (divided the meat mixture into three long loaves, then baked as instructed).

It certainly is a moist and delicious meatloaf. Being a first timer I stayed true to the recipe however I think next time I will add some chipotles in adobo sauce to balance the sweetness.

The best meatloaf we have ever had. I made the recipe exactly, and this is very flavorful and juicy. I originally was skeptical about the prunes, but many reviewers praised this "mystery" ingredient, and I wholeheartedly agree. I would never have thought to add this, but it created a complex flavor and just a bit of sweetness that brought out the flavor. This is so juicy, you will want to serve with mashed potatoes. I made roasted garlic mashed potatoes, but this meatloaf is so flavorfull, I will do plain mashed potatoes next time. This is an exceptional meatloaf.

I served this last night at our Wednesday night potluck. I made a milder version of meatloaf for the children, but intended this to be more to adult liking. Numerous people commented on how good it was, they liked the richer flavor than most bland meatloaf they've had before. My husband loved it!! He would have never guessed there were prunes in it. There was not a single piece left in the pan to take home!! The only change I will make when I make it again will to add more chopped bacon. It could be a little stronger in the flavor once it was cooked. This was excellent, very tasty and I plan to make it again soon.

I enjoyed this recipe a great deal. I normally never change a recipe until I've made it once as written. However, I did not have a carrot and I used whole grain bread for the crumbs. I only used one egg as I thought the mixture was "loose" enough. I, too, made gravy with the drippings and I heartily agree with others that the prunes gave it a depth that I would never have anticipated. This may have become my favorite meatloaf recipe!

I had to laugh reading the back and forth comments about reviewing a recipe if you have changed the ingredients--but here goes! I halved the recipe, and it easily served 3 people and took about 45 minutes to reach the recommended temperature. I used ground sirloin instead of ground beef, increased the ground pork very slightly, and used dates instead of prunes. I had to add more bread crumbs when I mixed it all up because it was too gooey when I shaped it into an oval. Very tasty indeed!

This was the biggest disappointment of anything I have tried on Epicurious. I tried to follow the recipe exactly and it was very bland and lacking in flavor. To me it did not taste much like meat, which is a disappointment because it is a recipe for a loaf of meat. I would not make this again for any reason. I was so looking forward to this meatloaf. The reviews were so positive that I made it for company for the first time. I will never try another recipe for the first time when we are having guest, no matter how positive the reviews are. Perhaps it should have been a clue that some of the positive reviews were by people who either don't like meatloaf or prepared it for people who don't like meatloaf.

At first the idea of adding prunes really did not excite me but after reading the other reviews I thought I'd just trust the recipe and go for it. And I'm sure glad I did! The prunes added the perfect amount of sweet and the meatloaf was sooooooo moist. It was fabulous! There was absolutely no need for ketchup either. In fact, we didn't even put it out on the table. It's really THAT good! You won't be disappointed with this one!

This was great, no bacon or pork but bravely went ahead BECAUSE of the comments posted by those that have "ventured the loaf" before me.

This was really pretty easy. Watch the ground beef amount: it's 1.5 lbs, not 1 lb. I failed to notice until halfway through, at which point I had to defrost some more. Doh! Anyway...I used quick-cooking oats instead of bread crumbs for added fiber, pre-cooked (preservative-free) bacon and only 2 pcs, then sauteed the onions, etc., in the bacon drippings plus a little olive oil. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. There wasn't too much grease in the pan. It was a gorgeous hunk o' meat. Of course, I thought the photo w/ the recipe looked appetizing, so I may have different visual standards than most reviewers! I happily dipped mine in ketchup. My family didn't have time to do that before they had scarfed it all up. Both kids want more in their lunch tomorrow. Time & $ well- spent. P.S. I love it when people make substitutions and tell the tale in their reviews. I also love to hear from more persnickety types who follow the recipe to the letter and report on that. I've learned so much about cooking from both kinds of reviews. I only ever saw one review I thought so outrageously departed from the recipe as to be worthless. The parodies of this particular review were hilarious, though.

I've made this by the recipe and without the pork. I prefer it by FAR without the pork, and the bacon is definitely a personal choice, I will leave it out in future attempts. The plums and veggies are great.

i'm vegetarian and needed a fairly simple meatloaf recipe that i could sneak some veggies into for my 4 year old daughter. she is somewhat finicky about meat and she loved this recipe. apologies to the previous rater, but i made it with the ingredients i had on hand - regular breadcrumbs and equal parts beef and pork. it smelled delicious and came out very moist and not dense or heavy at all. i would not recommend leaving out the prunes as they are the key sweet element and a good source of potassium!

served to a picky group and everyone raved about it. I topped it with strips of raw bacon before putting into oven which added lots of flavor. will certainly use this again as a base recipe for meatloaf.

I'M SORRY, BUT PEOPLE REALLY SHOULDN'T "TWEAK' A RECIPE......REALLY NOT A VALID WAY TO RATE/REVIEW WHEN YOU DO THAT. WHY BOTHER USING THE RECIPE THEN IN THE FIRST PLACE??? I'M NOT INTERESTED IN WHAT OTHER PEOPLE DO OR DON'T LIKE. LIKE MOST PEOPLE, I JUST WANT TO KNOW HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THE ACTUALY RECIPE, PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED, OR EASE OF THE RECIPE.....THAT'S ALL. THAT BEING SAID, THIS RECIPE WAS WONDERFUL.....VERY EASY TO PREPARE, VERY ACCURATE IN PREP, AND VERY MOIST! IT HAS A SLIGHTLY SWEET FLAVOR, BUT THE UNDERTONES WITH THE ACID VINEGAR, SALTY BACON, AS WELL AS VEGGIES WERE THE PERFECT FOIL. IF YOU'RE NOT A LOVER OF SWEET WITH SAVORY, IT WON'T BE A KEEPER FOR YOU....... HOWEVER IT WAS FOR US!

As stated by numerous other reviewers, I made this with a few substitutions. Isn't that the point of meatloaf? It's basically the meat....and then ingredients to combine and make the texture and flavor appropriate. I grew up with meatloaf consisting of a Lipton Onion Soup package and an egg. Needless to say, I knew it was time to put a few cooking skills to the test. I skipped out on the prunes and bacon. I added 1 lb each of ground sirloin, pork and veal. Added a little extra garlic for zing and added an extra stalk of celery - just because I LOVE cooked celery! This recipe takes meatloaf to a gourmet level! There are so many restaurants in Manhattan that have "Mom's Meatloaf" on the menu. To me, that just means they added the soup package. THIS is what I want my son to remember for the next 50 or so years as "Mom's Meatloaf"! Good luck to all - it's delicious!

This is my new favorite meatloaf recipe!. My favorite part of meatloaf used to be the tomato sauce topping, but no longer. My husband was a little doubtful when he saw me chopping the prunes and bacon in the food processor, but he agreed that the results were amazing. The only ground pork I could by was lean and in a 2 lb. package, so I used 2 lbs. lean pork and 2 pounds ground beef and it turned out great. I might use a little less salt next time as the bacon added some saltiness. Maybe reduce it to 1.5 tsp.

I was filled with positive anticipation while preparing this recipe, partially based on the somewhat intriguing ingredients, and partially based on the predominantly positive reviews. However, I did make it low(er) fat by frying the chopped bacon until crispy before adding it to the mix, using extra-lean ground beef and lean ground pork. Also,I used rye bread to make the bread crumbs, and, as some other reviewers noted, finely chopped the celery, carrots, onion, and garlic in the food processor. The resulting meat loaf was, thankfully, not swimming in fat as in the unappetizing photograph which accompanies the recipe. In fact, I removed very little extraneous fat from the baking pan using a turkey baster about 15 minutes before the meat loaf was done. My family and I have always heartily enjoyed my "usual" meat loaf, but we were quite pleasantly surprised with how absolutely delicious this recipe turned out. It has usurped my "usual" meat loaf recipe, for sure; I would give it 5 forks if I could.

My husband said this was my best meatloaf ever and wants it again. I omitted the prunes; used regular bread crumbs (its easier) and used rice wine vinegar. I also blended the veggies together so that it was more fine than just chopped veggies. Truly a jem of a recipe.

Well...I made it as written except I left out the prunes, and used lower fat pork, and thought it tasted about like a burger patty. This was the first meatloaf I've ever made, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but next time I am going to try something saucier.

Rating: 3
I read all the reviews before I made this 'loaf this week, and it totally lived up to my expectations. The prunes, which my dining partner was wary of, were a delicious addition. There WERE a lot of pan drippings, but it's meatloaf, not diet food. Highly recommended. (PS, I used 1.25 lb beef and nearly a pound of pork, because that's what size the packages came in.)

Rating: 4
I thought this was GREAT. It's pretty fatty, but I don't recommend modifying it...just eat it in small portions only a few times a year! The prunes and Worcestershire sauce make it piquant and kind of eradicated the need for another sauce like ketchup. We used panko bread crumbs, and buzzed the vegetables in the food processor a few times and so it had a very tight, loafy texture, which I like. We also used grass-fed beef and uncured bacon, cut the bacon down to 3 pieces and the Worchestershire sauce to a little over 1 tbs. I recommend serving with braised red cabbage & apple, mashed potatoes, and braised greens. FABULOUS.

I have to say this is one of the best meatloaf recipes. It's very succulent, and the flavors are amazing. The prunes do added a nice unique subtle sweetness and complexity to the taste. I highly recommend it! I used lean beef which I think is fine, given the fact that the recipe calls for bacon and pork.

Rating: 3
I was only able to purchase beef & pork in 1# packages, so I used 2# beef & 1# pork. I increased the bread crumbs to 1- 1/2 cups, and the milk to 1/2 cup. I omitted the bacon, attempting to cut fat from the recipe. Is this why the texture of the finished product was coarse & granular? Also, instead of prunes, I pureed 1/2 cup of canned plums. I really liked the flavor of this meatloaf, but I'd appreciate suggestions to improve the texture, without adding fat. It's definitely a recipe worth a couple of tries.

OK, so I made several changes to this recipe: I didn't have any celery or worcestershire sauce (I used soy sauce instead), and I mistakenly purchased 1 lb ground beef and 3/4 lb ground pork. I used quick oats instead of bread crumbs, and I didn't saute the vegetables 'cause I was in a hurry and forgot to read that part. I also didn't use bacon because I wanted to cut down on the grease. It was still the tastiest meatloaf I have ever had. I'm stocking up on Worcestershire sauce for the next batch - this is definitely a keeper recipe and, evidently, one that does not suffer tremendously from substitutions or shortcuts here and there.

We haven't been big meatloaf fans, but loved this one and will definitely make again. I cooked the bacon before combining with other ingredients. Used reserved bacon grease to cook the vegi's (left out the butter). Baked just 45 min, then cut into thick slices and grilled. Yum!

Re. why 2 pans: you don't use a loaf PAN, you just make a LOAF and put it into a 13 x 9 pan. This was good and tasty. But definitely COOK the bacon FIRST, else you'll have lots of nasty pink bits in your meatloaf; also lots of bacon grease in the pan. Also, I think I will make this in a traditional loaf pan next time. But it's quite good and tasty.

Rating: 2
I made this as written and though it was good, though it was a little intense for my tastes. I liked the flavor for the most part and it was quite moist, but next time I would probably cut back on the bacon and/or the worcestershire. I would also add a little bit more binding ingredients as my loaf was too soft to get good slices. Overall a good jumping off point for meatloaf with a twist.

Kudos to "mreisi" for his/her comments regarding this recipe and other reviewers' comments. My partner and I always follow the recipe *exactly* the first go around. If we choose to use a recipe again, we then 'tweak' it as and when we see fit. This meatloaf? Spectacular . . . as is! And, with my recent windfall of 10 pounds of ground beef (Certified *Organic!* Angus Beef) from a farmer friend, the resulting product can only be better!

Best meatloaf ever! I'm not a meatloaf fan, but the combination of prunes and bacon was intriguing so I gave it a shot. I could hardly wait for leftovers! Please reviewers, don't give a recipe a poor rating after you've substituted everything but the kitchen sink because you don't have ingredients on hand or don't "like prunes". Tell us something useful like sliced bread will soak up the extra oil, or quick oats bind meatloaf better. And yes, meatloaf is NOT lowfat!

I'm a professional chef and this is the most horrible meatloaf I've ever eaten. I rarely try new meatloaf recipes because my "signature" meatloaf is so delish. I thought this would be an interesting combination of flavors - wrong! Thank goodness I didn't make this for Rex, a dear friend who loves my meatloaf, he'd be hard-pressed to be kind and not gag.

We really liked this. The first time we made it we skipped the bacon, and it still tasted delicious. Would probably try 1 or 2 pieces of bacon in it next time for the flavor. We were surprised by the prunes. They made it just a little sweet without being pruney. We agree the photo in the magazine wasn't all that beautiful (my husband said it looked like a big lump of food in a pan, which isn't very glowing). But, on the other hand, when we make food it usually turns out tasty but isn't always gorgeous. I might like to try making this with turkey sometime to do a lighter version.

I made this last night for my meatloaf-loving husband. He rated it the best meatloaf he'd ever had, and said I could continue to experiment, but he wanted this to be the standard I returned to. I used more carrot and no celery, all beef (organic), and used a small amount of olive oil instead of butter. It was very, very good.

The forum is perhaps a better place to discuss this, but I wanted to comment on the role of reviewers on Epicurious. I recently defended my dissertation on the rhetoric of cooking Web sites like Epicurious. The reviews were one of the features that made Epicurious strikingly different from other sites. I like recipes that anticipate the realities of modern suburban homes, but Epicurious recipes often do not. So I either muddle along on my own with occasional success or I hope other Epi members are in the same pot as I. Usually they are and they tell me about it in their recipe reviews. The reviews following each recipe co-opt the authoritarian voice of recipes and always describe reviewers' successes and failures with substitutions. They make the changes based on what was available in their kitchens or based on their families palates. They add ingredients. They leave out ingredients. Reviews admit mistakes the cooks make or critique the recipes. Others discuss changes they would make if they made the recipe again. Many reviews specifically reference other reviews so it is clear that users read and value the comments of others in the Epi community. Users are making knowledge collaboratively and valuing that collaborative, experiential knowledge. I'm going to make this meatloaf this week and I'll post again with my review (and likely my substitutions).

Agree with others that this was very good. I get the magazine, and I have to admit that the photo is not very attractive. My finished loaf looked better than this photo, although there was a lot of fat to try to remove before putting it on the table. I didn't make any substitutions, except perhaps low fat milk (rarely have whole milk on hand). It was easy to prep with a food processor. I cut the bacon by hand and tried to trim the obvious fat from the meat before incorporating it. I grew up putting chili sauce on meatloaf, but this recipe does not need any extra sauce - it's tasty and moist when prepared as written. Enjoy!

This is a good meatloaf. I didnt change anything in the recipe simply because it would not be this recipe. I rated and reviewed this recipe as written and found it delisious. Now would i make some changes? Yes, but it wouldnt be this recipe then would it. If you are going to rate and review, use the recipe as given dont change it and then write a review, thats not the purpose of rating and reviewing. Just my opinion, i could be wrong.

I don't like meatloaf, but my husband does, so I made this for him & was surprised to enjoy it also! I left out the carrots & added portabella mushrooms. I didn't have ground pork, just 85/15 organic beef, but the flavor was still amazing. I will definitely make this again.

This was, without a doubt, the best meatloaf I've had. My husband, something of a purist in this matter, concurred, even after he knew about the prunes. I essentially halved the recipe, since it's just the two of us, and used all beef since I didn't have any pork (I did, fortunately, have bacon). I did use 2 eggs, though, for extra binding. I upped the oven temp a bit to make sure it formed a nice crust before it cooked through, since the smaller loaf cooks faster (40 minutes or so to 155). I urge you to try this - it's nothing like the stuff with Lipton soup your mother/grandmother used to make.

Significant variations, so I didn't rate it, but I really liked this recipe as a base. I used brioche instead of sandwich bread, 2% milk instead of whole, vegetarian Worcestershire sauce (it was all I had in the house), no bacon, about 1/4 cup apricot preserves instead of the prunes, no pork, a total of 2 lbs ground beef and 1/2 lb ground turkey breast, 3 eggs and no parsley. (Whew!). I really liked the flavors, but it was definitely different from a typical meatloaf. I like mine uniforn in appearance, so before mixing the meat with everything else, I blended the latter in a food processor. I also used the processor to chop all the veggies and mince the garlic. When I added those to the pan, I chopped the bread in it and then added the milk to the same container. It was a lot quicker that way and used very few dishes, which was an added bonus. I was also really tired when I was making it, so I misread the recipe and completely spread the mixture out in a 9x13 pan. So it wasn't exactly a loaf, but it did cook more quickly (~30 minutes) and there was a nice lot of crust. Next time I plan to up the preserves by an extra 2 tablespoons, add some tomato paste (what can I say--I guess I'm a traditionalist!), and use textured vegetable protein (TVP) instead of the turkey. I was too tired to make potatoes, but a simple salad of mixed baby greens with a raspberry vinaigrette went well.

The 4th fork is for the pleasant surprise. I'm not used to this whole "liking meatloaf" thing. The prunes were a great addition. I forgot to get pork, and the bacon in my fridge had gone bad, so I used 2 lbs of organic ground beef with an 85/15 fat ratio, and will probably use a lower fat content next time, because it was swimming in fat after baking even without the bacon and pork. Because I don't have a meat thermometer, I baked this in a ring shape so it would cook more evenly and would be easier to check for doneness (nod to Betty Crocker for the help on that one). It also made more of the yummy crust. My British husband likes gravy with just about everything, so I used some of the more-than- ample drippings and a small box of beef broth with some s&p and it came out well. I served with garlic mashed potatoes and a tossed salad and it was just the happiest thing that could have happened to my mouth. I definitely recommend this, the little carrots bits were great, and although I couldn't taste the celery or parsley, I'm sure they added something.

In reply to Haddenfield, the instructions did not say pack it in a loaf PAN, but in a loaf shape. I too found this a little to 'meaty' and fatty. Next time I will put bacon on top of loaf, not in. The milk and breadcrumb mixture made the mix too wet so I added some dry panko to bind it together. Loved the vinegar & prunes!!

Quick oats will bind things better than bread crumbs if you find it too crumbly; perhaps add a whole grain component as well. I use less butter as well.

For the cook from Atlanta and Haddonfield..I learned a trick recently from Paula Deen. When preparing meatloaf don't use a loaf pan, use a 13 x 9 pan; but first place two or three slices of thick sliced, hearty white bread in the pan. The larger loaf pan allows for a larger portion of the loaf to brown, and the bread will pull away and retain that unwanted fatty liquid from the loaf. If you liked this meatloaf recipe you might want to try Paula Deen's Bacon Cheeseburger Meatloaf recipe.

Rating: 3
The flavor of this was great BUT I was disturbed by the amount of liquid (primarily fat) that resulted after cooking for the alloted time. I drained off most of it and it totaled more than a cup. It seemed as though the loaf was practically braising in the volume of fat, water, etc. I double-checked to ensure I followed the recipe exactly and I had -not sure why so much. I didn't have the problem of it being crumbly. B/c it wasn't up to temp after an hour twenty-five, I turned up the oven to 375 and let it cook another half hour or so. I too will modify this with some lower-fat shortcuts, starting with subbing 2 percent in place of whole milk and cutting back on the bacon and butter next time.

My husband loved this meatloaf; I thought it was very good as well--nice and moist, as many have noted. Loved the addition of prunes and bacon. Did anyone else, though, find the directions strange? It says in the introduction that it isn't baked in a loaf pan, but then later the directions say to bake it in a loaf pan, in a 13 x 9 baking dish. At any rate, I just made it free form in a large dish, and it came out great.

This is a WONDERFUL meatloaf recipe! It was my first time making meatloaf and I found this recipe very easy and just so wonderfully flavorful. To make it a bit healthier, I used whole wheat bread instead of white bread; 2% milk instead of whole milk; 7% fat ground beef; extra-lean ground pork (they recommend not to, but I didn't think it was problematic and it was still full of flavor); turkey bacon; and I stir-fried the chopped vegetables in olive oil instead of butter. I found the flavors to be still just as rich and heartwarming, and the husband and a houseguest loved the dish. I'll most definitely be making this one again!

Rating: 2
Liked it, but didn't love it. I found the chopped up bacon in the loaf to be too much.. It certainly contributed to the flavor, but somewhat dominated it. I very much liked the addition of prunes. I also like the concept of a cooked mirepoix added to the mixture. I did find the loaf to be extremely moist and somewhat crumbly... meaning, I had trouble slicing it and getting my pieces to hold together. I also needed to cook the meatloaf on 375 for 30 minutes longer than suggested in order to get the internal temperature to hit over 155 degrees. POSSIBLE MODIFICATIONS: If I make again, I will probably eliminate the bacon altogether and use a slightly leaner cut of beef to complement the ground pork. Reducing the fat and the bacon should cut down on the moisture a bit and eliminate the bacony flavor. OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS: I made a sun-dried tomato ketchup (Recipe on Epicurious.com) and spread some over the top in the last 20 minutes of cooking. It complemented the meatloaf well and was consisten with the 'high-low' concept of this dish.

In a word, this meatloaf is exceptional. VERY tender, moist and, most of all, incredibly flavorful. The bacon and prune mixture in the meat makes this really delicious.

This was the first time I made meatloaf. I didn't grow up eating or making meatloaf so I don't really know what good meatloaf tastes like. This recipe was really, really, tasty and what counts is my family loved it. My husband initially said it is not like his mom's but he couldn't stop eating it. It renders quite a bit of fat but since it disappeared so quickly and was easy to make I give it 3 forks. There were no leftovers.
