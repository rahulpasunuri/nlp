I ended up finishing in the oven after reading the previous reviews. After sauteeing the apples and adding the juice and vinegar I poured it over the chops that I had in a 350 oven. I cooked for 15 minutes and they came out nice and tender and well infused with the flavor. I have another recipe that is similar that uses Marsala wine that I have to say I like better. This was good but not sure if I would make it again.

I've made this twice now. I love how easy and delicious it is. I serve it over a bed of wild rice.

I made this in a cast iron pan with bacon fat. I peeled the Golden Delicious apples and used bone-in chops with no problem. I liked it more than my husband who thought it was fine. I had to hold it on the stove for 30 min and while the chops toughened up a bit the flavors were great. I'll certainly make it again. Easy too!

The flavors were quite nice but the pork needed to meld with the apple/ vinegar/ onion flavors longer. I think next time I'll shorten the pork cooking time on the front end and add more liquid on the back end so I can increase the simmer time. The texture of the cooked apples was a bit mealy to me, but my husband loved them. I too would have given it 2 1/2 forks had I made it with my changes.

I used pork tenderloin instead of chops. I cut several slits in the pork and stuffed them with slivers of garlic. Also coated with oregano, salt, and pepper as directed. I seared the the tenderloin for about 5 minutes then roasted it at 400 for 10-15 minutes. I also added a little cornstarch at the end to slightly thicken the sauce. It was delicious!

This was excellent. I made this for my birthday dinner, and I will definately make this again. It's almost effortless, and comes together in a snap. Plus the sweet and sour flavor is just right.

Quick and easy-- but the flavors seem to suffer from a lack of time to meld together. I think the apple-onion vinegar mixture might be a better base for braising a pork roast over a low flame.

I used bone-in chops, very thick... it worked out really well! You just have to cook them a little longer. I also served stuffed baked apples on the side. Delicious!!

This was a very nice, straight-forward recipe. The pork was practically falling apart it was so tender (I let it simmer in the sauce a little longer, which may have been part of it..), and the apples and onions had a very nice flavor. Very fast, too- great for a weeknight dinner.

I found the pork took a little longer to cook than the recipe called for, but other than that, it was quite tasty!

This dish was really easy to prepare and quite good. If I could I would have given it 2 1/2 forks. I followed the recipe and my only comment would be that next time I will use less onion and vinegar and a bit more apple and apple juice to make it sweeter. I will make this again and truly enjoyed it.

Quick, easy, and I had all the ingredients in the house (we had gotten pork chops because they were on sale, then came home and looked for a recipe to cook them). My husband and I both liked this. The vinegar was strong, but we like strong flavors. I wouldn't have wanted it any sweeter.

I would give this 2 1/2 forks if I could. Not bad. I didn't have apple juice so I used calvados but that could only have helped matters. I don't mind the "vinegariness" but I know some of my guest would have objected to it, so I added a tiny bit of sugar. Served with boiled potatoes as suggested. Easy, low fat, not bad. I will make it again only because I must do more low fat recipes.

Easy, low fat, and very tasty! We loved it.

All I can say about this recipe is YUCK! The vinegar was too overpowering, the pork was not tender, and the sauce was too liquidy! My first disappointment for epicurious.com

I am a newly wed that was trying to impress my new husband with a delicious new dish. When he took his first bite his eyees lit up and said "this is really good!". It's the first time he's actually complimented my cooking. I'm thinking I should make it for my mother-in-law to impress her. :-)

Easy and yummy! Used fresh thyme instead of oregano. A really nice change from chicken, and relatively low fat.

My sister n law made this for dinner for a family get togethor a few years back, I knew it was a Bon Ap. recipe and with this web site I now have the recipe and can make it myself. It is simple and very good.

The flavors in this dish are subtle and quiet. It's a nice quick dish for autumn.

This was easy to make but tasted like bland cooked fruit on top of the chops. Overall flavor lacked any dimension. I added 1/2 of a red pepper which added nice color. Both the chops and the fruit/onion required longer cooking time. Won't make again.

Excellent choice for those busy week days. I didn't have any golden delicious so I substituted granny smith with wonderful results. I also increased the oregano. Even my 5 year old loved it minus the onions. Simple is best with this recipe. I served it with roast potatoes, steamed green beans and warm buns.
