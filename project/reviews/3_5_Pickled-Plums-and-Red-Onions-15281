This recipe was originally printed to go with the Grilled Spiced Double Thick Pork Chops. I've made the pickled plums to go with the pork chops and the dish is divine. You must try it!!

I love this recipe. I have made it a number of times, as it is beautful and a surprising (and delicious) combination of flavors. This is a great accompaniment to any grilled meat, polenta, and a salad. You do want to make sure to use fairly firm plums -- and ideally plums of different varieties -- as soft plums tend to fall apart.
