A wonderful salad! I substituted regular oranges and a smoky Spanish paprika - the winning ingredient in my opinion. I've made this many times, it's so good!

This is an excellent salad--not bland at all. The sweet and salty go together so well, and that little bit of heat from the cayene adds a lot. And it looks pretty, too.

I took another reviewer's advice and upped the spices by 50%, and also used mandarin oranges. Good salad. I served it with the spice-rubbed butterflied leg of lamb from epicurious and got raves.

The butter lettuce really makes this salad because the texture offsets the spicy zing of the dressing. So simple - a great salad to accompany a spicy or rich meal. The tangerines had a lot of seeds which was fun my guests to pick out...

I really liked this salad. I think I would use oranges though as it was really hard to get enough segments out of a tangerine. I didn't have any white wine vinegar on hand so I used rice vinegar and it was fine. I also added a little sugar to the dressing. Left it to marinate at room temp for about 3 hours. Guests loved it, served with Moroccan chicken with eggplant, tomatoes and almonds. Very good and interestingly different meal.

I'm glad I made this salad in spite of the other reviews -- I took it to a dinner party and it was a great accompaniment to the grilled meats that were served. I used a jar of mandarin orange segments and oil-cured black olives, which went together very well. I bumped up the spices by 50% and that seemed to address the "blandness" complaints -- at least for me. Also, I usually add a little sugar whenever I make a salad dressing using vinegar and I did it this time, too. I will definitely make this again.

My fiance and I did eat all of this salad; it didn't taste awful or anything. It was just horribly boring. The flavors neither blend nor compliment each other. There are better recipes to spend my time on.

Not a particularly inspiring dish, but it was tasty. I served it with pan-fried scallops in a beurre blanc sauce, and the citrus and lettuce was very nice to balance the richness of the seafood. Next time I would toss the olive-tangerine mixture with the lettuce and parsley rather than putting the mix on top as suggested in the recipe. The flavors would be more integrated that way.
