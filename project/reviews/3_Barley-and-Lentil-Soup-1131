This recipe is great. Has gotten great reviews from kids, husband, and foodie friends. It does not have an overwhelming flavor, which is part of what makes it great. Very filling, and healthy. Substituting veg broth for beef works well. Agree with other reviewers, this recipe makes A LOT of soup.

After following this recipe to a T (except that I halved it), I found this soup to be flavorless. I thought the beef broth and sun-dried tomatoes would kick it up a bit, but they didn't. I'll keep looking...

I thought this soup was fantastic. I did modify a bit by adding 1 lb of browned ground beef to the mix before simmering for 1.5 hours. Curiously, the recipe has you cook everything up in a 4 qt sauce pan, but I ended up moving everything into a much larger pot; it makes a LOT of soup.

First off, as someone already mentioned, this recipe makes way more then the stated 8 servings. I would say about 15. I made this with vegetable stock instead of beef and it still came out good. Only thing is without the beef stock it requires a good amount of salt. On the positive side this soup is very filling. I gave two stars because while it is good, the flavor is not amazing- I might make it again, but I might not. If you are so inclined the addition of sausage would probably go very well with this

Hearty and filling. I had 1/4 of hamburg in my frig. and added that, which enhanced the flavor just a little more. I used roasted tomatoes (probably 10-12 in all- a combination of paste and plum), from the garden in place of the canned and sun dried and tomatoe paste. As are most soups, a great recipe to play with and add or subtract from, as suits ones tastes.

My finicky husband has been asking for this again. He actually ate almost the whole thing himself, which is especially amazing since he rarely eats leftovers. From what I read, the people who didn't like the recipe had made adaptions that didn't work, which shouldn't become the recipie's fault. Use the sun dried tomatoes because they have more intense flavor and sweetness than canned diced tomoates. The barley and lentils needs the robust beef broth instead of chicken broth. It's a great winter stew recipe based on staple items.

after reading the reviews, i chose to add sausage, more spices and more broth. i did not use the tomato paste as the soup is thick enough without. it is a delicious soup thought and wonderful for the chilly fall weather. will freeze to take to work. MEW, nebraska

I used pearl barley and beluga lentils (which are a little milder than green) and it turned out a gem! I cut the final simmering time by half to 45-50 min and did not fully dilute to a soup at the end. It became a sort of chili with very delicate flavors. !!! It is very important to use good tasting tomatoes (I used stewed) and sun dried tomatoes!!! As a vegetarian I used veg. cubes, instead of beef.

I agree with Austin: not bad, but also not good. I used diced tomatoes and chicken broth (with a can of beef broth for depth), and while we all ate it, I have a feeling I will be throwing out the leftovers. The Lentil with Brown Rice soup on this site is much better.

I loved this! It does make a ton - probably enough for 12 at least, and I served it as a main course with bread, salad, fruit and cheese. I wouldn't refer to it as lentil soup though - I'd call it vegetable soup. I used diced tomatoes which might be a plus for the one reviewer who thought everything was overwhelmed by tomato sauce, and chicken broth instead of beef. I also added some crushed red pepper when sauteing the onions. I will definitely make this again (but not for a while because of all the leftovers!)

This is an excellent vegetarian dish. Adding some mushrooms makes it even better. And if you're not serving vegetarians, a handful of cubed salami is also delicious.

This is by far the best lentil soup recipe you will find, trust me, I have tried them all. When I have serve this to friends they always request the recipe. The only thing I do differently is to substitute the beef broth by using beef soup base. I also make a spread/dip using the last bit of soup left, cooking it down very thick and using the food processor to make a medium paste. Also a hit with all.

We thought that this was very good. I hope it freezes well - it makes an enormous amount. It is a perfect cold weather dinner with some fresh bread and a salad. My kids didn't love it - they liked it - and they ate it. That is a miracle worth recreating.

Delicious dinner soup, well really it's more like a stew. Very filling. Served 8 with lots left over. Will make again often.

I wouldn't make this again. It's not awful, just not very special: the lentils are overwhelmed by the tomato sauce and the texture was gummy. You'll definitely need the extra can of broth for thinning the soup. It's edible and, as I keep reminding myself, healthy, but I'm not looking forward to slogging through the whole batch myself this week.

This is just excellent! Very flavorful--without adding salt and pepper, although I did add a bit more tomato paste than called for. Superb!
