I've made these sandwiches 4 times now...a hit once again! This time the bread I baked was a little dry so I spread a thin layer of softened butter on one side -- delicious! Either way, a winner. And, yes, the parsley will get caught in one's teeth. During service, I simply joke about it -- "green tooth sandwiches"...everyone gets the joke...and tells each other if they have parsley in their teeth. No big deal. Its just parsley!

I have a quick question about this one -- will people eat them at a cocktail party? I would probably find them tempting but worry that I'd end up with parsley in my front teeth unless the sandwiches were small enough to make one bite. So to anyone who has experience with serving these --do people eat them? Does the parsley end up in your teeth?

Loved this recipe. I also added a little salt and instead of dipping the sandwich in mayo I painted it on with a knife. Very pretty and elegant and a big hit with "the girls".

These are lovely, and taste more complex than you'd think. I would recommend sprinkling a little good quality salt on top of the onions, but James Beard really knows his stuff.
