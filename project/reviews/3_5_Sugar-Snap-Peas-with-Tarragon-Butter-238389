Quick and easy, quite delicious! Used dried tarragon and lemon peel, this recipe is a keeper!

I made minor modifications (onion instead of shallot, salted butter rather than unsalted, and added coin- cut carrots for color) and was very pleased with this recipe. It was also a hit at the "pot-luck". I could easily finish the recipe just before serving so that it was warm.

Loved this...so simple and pretty. The high heat in the last few minutes burned my shallots however and browned the peas a bit. Next time I'll use med-high instead. An extra pinch of kosher salt really brought out the flavor.

very good, even if you have to use dried tarragon.

Simple and tasty. Since I was making a dish that also used tarragon and shallots (the superb Chicken Louisa from this site), I thought I would make further use of both fresh ingredients and this recipe fit the bill. Will definitely make again.

My husband can go either way on sugar snap peas. I love them so I like to make them different ways in an effort to win him over. This one he liked - perhaps my searching is over. My two deviations from the recipe as written were using olive oil in place of butter to saute the shallot and using 3/4 teaspoon dried tarragon. I'll make these again and wouldn't hesitate to serve them to dinner guests.

I must disagree with the first review. I found it delightful. The lemon and tarragon melded well with the tender peas. Like any stir-fry, everything must be done quickly and lightly.

This recipe looks like it would be good, but we found it to be a little bland. Seems like the flavors didn't make it into the peas. Or maybe lemon zest doesn't go well with sugar snap peas.
