This recipe was fine as written for the entree that was suggested to go along with this. Gourmet should have linked this recipe along with one other within the recipe for the seared scallops. This would save the need to save all three recipes to your recipe box.

Heat a little olive oil with a LITTLE butter, add a dash of balsamic...when all is hot, add spinach. (add garlic to the oil if you wish)

Try olive oil and garlic- makes a much better dish.
