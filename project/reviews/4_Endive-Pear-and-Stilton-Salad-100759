This salad is elegant and very tasty. Note however: do not use the amount of shallot recommended. Halve or quarter the amount. Otherwise, the undertone of onions is overpowering and defeats the nicely melded complexity of the other ingredients. Also, I suggest making it the day before because it truly improves with time.

Terrific! I saw this on the Epicurious show on the Travel Channel the other day and HAD to make it. I was a little dismayed at first that the dressing seemed so bland -- I ended up adding an additional tablespoon of OJ and put a total of 1TB of port in it, as well, to make it taste like SOMETHING. On tv, they sauteed the pears in butter, and I did that instead of baking them, and added a tablespoon of brown sugar, just because they're not in season right now and I thought they'd be a bit tart. It was perfect -- the pears were sweetened just slightly, and the tanginess and creaminess of the cheese went fabulously with the crunch and bitterness of the endive. The anise in the dressing gave it all a nice contrast, and I understood why the subtleness of the dressing worked so well (I would still keep the additional OJ and port changes, though). This is one of those dishes where you want to make sure you get a little bit of everthing -- pear, cheese, endive, and dressing -- in every bite so that you can taste how the flavors go together and play off of one another. I gave it a twist of fresh ground pepper, and when I make this again, will probably include walnuts or pecans. We were having a casual dinner, just my boyfriend and me, and he slurped the juices from the plate (gauche, I know, but we were alone, so it was okay!). Definitely a keeper recipe, and undoubtedly a good one to "wow" company. Simple, too!

We have some pears leftover from Harry & Davud at Christmas and tried this receipe. It is marvelous. My husband throught it was the best salad he had ever tasted and begged me to make it for comany. It is perfect just the way it is written, but I would slice the endive crosswise and wash and spin it dry first.

Demure, refreshing. I didn't quite get the use of endive, though. I will try again with other greens.

We loved it! Served it for Christmas dinner with standing rib roast. I saw Michael Lamonica make this on Epicurious tv--he sauteed the pears in about 1T of butter rather than roast them in the oven which is what I did. Also, as did a previous reviewer, I used less shallot than recommended

The success of this salad depends on the ingredients. If you have nice fresh pears that are just ripe enough and the best Stilton, you will be much closer to a great salad. This is nice with wine because there is no vinegar in the dressing. Good for a party as a first course.

I don't normally leave negative opinions, particularly on epicurious.com where the recipes are always so amazing, but I have to say, my husband and I were both quite disappointed by this salad. The dressing was fairly bland - even with all the interesting ingredients - and neither the pears nor the endives provided enough flavor to make up for the plain dressing. The stilton cheese obviously provided more zip, but overall, we just thought that there were several salad recipes out there with mixed greens, pears and toasted nuts that were far superior.

My guests and I loved this salad. I made the dressing the night before and tasted it after seiving it, right before serving. I found the shallot taste way too overpowering so I only drizzled a bit on the endive and left the pears and stilton naked. Next time I will only use about 1 T of shallot. Added homemade candied walnuts, too.

This was served at a dinner party and everyone loved it. It made an attractive presentation and the roasted pears were ever so sweet.

This is a fantastic salad. I followed the recipe for the dressing as written, substituted mixed greens for the endive and added toasted walnuts. I was serving eight and the recipe is easily doubled. The pears can be done ahead and refrigerated, which makes for a really easy assembly when ready to serve. This is a keeper!

I made this for a friend and it was wonderful. Baking the pear makes for an interesting texture against the other ingredients, especially the creaminess of the cheese. I didn't change a thing first time and, for once, see no reason to.

This was a fantastic salad. I used romaine lettuce instead of the endives and for the dressing used 3 tablespoons of OJ, 6 Tablespoons of olive oil, 1 teaspoon of port, 1 minced garlic clove and fresh ground pepper - a keeper!

This dressing is outstanding. Very light, yet with a complex taste. I added toasted, sugared pecans and simply cut up my pears because I didn't have a chance to roast them. Excellent. Will make this again and again.

The roasted pears are such a refreshing taste - my only advise is to be careful with the shallot. If your shallot is too big - it may make the dressing too strong. What I did was I had to triple the liquid ingredients to get it to a taste I thought was good. The roasted walnuts was a great idea.

This was a big hit when I made it on Mother's Day--everyone loved it--but I agree with other reviewers that shallot flavor was too strong--and I already added extra oil to compensate! Half the shallots next time.

This salad is outstanding. Made it for Christmas dinner with a rib roast and it was delicious. Used a mixture of endive and baby greens and added toasted walnuts, as suggested by other reviewers. Recommend it highly for a special dinner.

Nice salad, we served it at christmas dinner. I added dried cranberries for color, they are a nice compliment to the stilton cheese. I think that I need to work on the dressing, the shallot flavor was a little strong.

This is an excellent salad! I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it. The toasted walnuts were a great suggestion and I would use them again for sure. If you don't have time to make the dressing, I tried using a raspberry vinegrette and it was great with it too. Mixed greens worked well too in place of the endives.

i had trouble finding belgian endives, so i instead used a mixed green salad. also i sauteed the pears in a TBS of oil and a little sugar. the pears turned out very well, sweet and grainy. i left the dressing in the middle of the stove with other things cooking around it, the heat will mingle all the flavors together.

This is a fantastic salad. I didn't use endive but substituted baby greens and crunchy romaine. Took another cook/reviewers suggestion of adding toasted walnuts and I had a masterpiece of a salad. Guests raved and raved. Served it with the Crown Roast of Pork and Cider Gray (Epicurious. My family has requested I make the dressing on a regular basis. It is delicious. Worth the little bit of effort to make it. Have to use Stilton. Don't just substitute a regular blu cheese -- it deserves the Stilton. So smooth and creamy -- fantastic.

This recipe was great as an appetizer on a summer evening diner. Add some toasted walnuts and it's even better.

I brought this to a party and altered the recipe by cutting the endive by half and using a mix of greens. Everyone loved it. The flavors are vibrant and interesting.
