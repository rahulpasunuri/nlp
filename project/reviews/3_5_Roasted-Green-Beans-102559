I was on vacation last week, and some of my green beans grew too big while I was away. I was unsure what to do with them, as they were not suitable for steaming. I tried roasting them for the first time using this recipe. They were great! Roasting them gave them a new flavor and texture. My kids loved them and said they were like french fries. I'm glad I gave it a try, and will never throw overgrown beans away again.

I tried this using sun dried tomatoes in their oil. Just dumped a bunch out, stirred with my cut green beans, added some salt and roasted. Took about HALF the time - done in 25-30 minutes (my oven is convection, and pretty darn fast! - and everyone asked for the recipe! Talk about easy... Ate the leftovers cold with a little red wine vinegar and cracked pepper. yum.

I'd actually give this 3.5 stars, based on taste and how easy it is, especially around the holidays when it's so nice to have a dish that can sit a bit while others are finished. Taking others' advice, I baked regular green beans for 20 minutes at 425 degrees. Tossed in a dozen cloves of garlic with the oil for 2 lbs. of beans, along with a generous sprinkling of salt and ground pepper. The garlic carmelized nicely. Finished it with the zest of a whole lemon and some fresh parsley. Yum.

I roasted them for ten mins and then stirred and switched for ten. I did not add any seasoning, but I did add roasted red peppers that I roasted earlier and the flavor was insane. Like crack. OMG!

Great alternative to steamed, sauteed, etc. After I remove from the oven I toss them in a little balsamic and some romano cheese. Can serve as a snack or a nice side dish also.

The recipe is good except the cooking time is obviously wrong. It only takes about 15 minutes or less to roast the beans. I did not follow recipe time and judged it on my own. It was fine.

These were great! Unlike some other reviews, I found they did still taste like green beans (didn't blacken them,just browned nicely)....yet, they tasted roasted. Yummy!! Added about 5 cloves of garlic and finished with a drizzle of balsamic vinegar as suggested by other reviewers. Just great, would do again certainly.

This dish intrigued me enough to try it for the first time with Christmas dinner. A total disaster. They burned to a crisp. But I will try it again!

I make these weekly. They really are like green french fries. Try them! I have foudn that balnching them, patting dry and then pan roasting them (about 15 mintues in a skilet with olive oil and salt) works really well for getting a crispy texture.

What vegetable DOESN'T taste good roasted? Unlike most others, however, this doesn't really resemble the original, so if you love steamed beans and are just looking for a variation, this isn't it. Oddly enough these really do become a crunchy, almost nutty snack food. They even reminded me of some Japanese geen bean-shaped potato-based snacks I had once. For that reason I'm going to try them with soya sauce next time... you just never know. I had something else in the oven at 425 and threw mine in for 20 minutes or less. They could have been more roasted but were enough so that I got the idea.

This is one of our favorite recipes. Definitely roast with whole garlic cloves and splash with balsamic vinegar afterwards. Chewy, flavorful, and fun finger food. Probably not a lick of nutrition left in them after all that cooking though. A little like green french fries.

Did not like this, it took the flavor out of the beans.

Have made this recipe many times with changes: use green beans - haricot verts are a waste - toss crushed garlic (can add crushed red pepper, or hot oil, and/or Hoisin sauce too) with olive oil, spread beans on baking pan in single layer and roast at 425 for 15-20 minutes, longer if you want them more crispy. Have used asparagus with great results too!

We make a variation of this dish all the time, from another cookbook - DOESN'T make any sense to use haricots verts for this!! Use fresh, regular green beans, mix in some onions and or whole cloves of garlic (do not be afraid.) Top with a dash of balsamic vinegar just before serving- yum!!

YUK! I love roasted vegetables, so was really looking forward to trying this. I used regular green beans and did not roast as long as the recipe called for and they were still shriveled up strips of burned beans. I had added a small amount of crushed garlic to the olive oil, and even my old friend garlic couldn't help this one. A waste of a good vegetable!

The finished product looks awful, all shriveled up. The taste is not so great. I prefer them steamed. It's all a matter of what you like and obviously many others like this recipe.

This is so simple yet so delicious! What a terrific vegetable dish to serve and so easy. The added bonus to this recipe is that it is low in fat and yet so flavorful.

It is just so funny how good these are! Sometimes the basics do produce the best results.

The green beans were so fresh and of uniform small size. I added red bell pepper strips for color and taste and it was delicious. Such a fun way to serve "good old green beans" Will definitely try what others did in the reviews.

I make a version of this all the time. I don't use any oil and I don't turn the beans. It's still great. I sprinkle salt and nutmeg on a baking sheet, arrange the beans in one layer. Then roast at 425 for about 30 minutes, maybe more. Don't let them turn all black, just a few spots. Great texture and concentrated flavor. Easy! Dock loves 'em. Thanks for the recipe, Kimmy RdeP!

This is fabulous - and they are just as good at room temp. I have made green beans this way for non-green bean lovers and converted one and all. I toss them with fresh ground pepper, in addition to the salt, and stir/toss them half way through the cooking process.
