These are surprisingly light. They make an elegant and excellent after dinner cookie. For the rolling sugar, you can get away with making about 1/2. The amount they tell you to make is ridiculous. These have become a Christmas cookie staple in our house.

These came out delicious and were a snap, based on all the good tips in the previous reviews and a little ingenuity. Grind your own cardamom. Grind the walnuts fine in the food processor. Sift your flour and use 2 1/4 cups. Make the cookies smaller; I used a 1 1/4" scoop, maybe two teaspoons-worth. Yielded about 5 1/2 dozen cookies. Unlike the last writer who sized down, I cooked mine for 20 minutes until just barely golden and they were terrific. I made only the cardamom-sugar coating and had plenty with only maybe 2/3 or 3/4 cups sugar. Don't "toss" them, just put them in upside down and swirl them around until they're covered. Both my six-year-old and my husband loved them. Must be onto something!

These cookies are fantastic, though I would like to see the cardamom flavor more pronounced. Make sure you cookie them the full time -- after reading previous reviews I made them smaller and thought that cooking them for 20 minutes would suffice. The batch that I forgot about that stayed in for 25 minutes was the best. Also, my family isn't huge on very sweet desserts, nonetheless our camp preferred the powdered sugar variety. But both are great.

I have made these cookies twice. The first time the generous tablespoon of dough was a much too large cookie. I found that a mellon baller produces a perfect size cookie! And it is VERY easy to do.

I love to make six or so varieties of cookies and candies every Christmas to hand out as gifts. This recipe is always at the top of my list and draws the most positive reviews. However, I much prefer the granulated sugar coating and that is now the only one I use.

These were pleasant, simple cookies. Made with whole-wheat flour, increased the cardamom to compensate for the stronger flavor of the wheat dough. Nicely not too sweet, but hearty with the nuts, and slightly spicy. Rolled only in powdered sugar with cardamom and they were tasty!

Very simple recipe that produces excellent cookies. Unless I read something wrong, it seems you don't need all that granulated and powdered sugar to roll the cookies in after they have been baked. There was a lot left over.

These are a hit with both kinds of sugar coatings. Thanks to the cook who suggested looking up the proper way to measure flour. I found a PBS cite that had video. I re-measured the flour I had already set aside for this recipe, and found I was over by a half cup because I had used the wrong method.

These were fantastic. The tricks are to grind your own cardamom, chop the walnuts very finely so they just blend into the cookies (I used my food processor) and measure your flour very lightly (don't pack it!). I only made the granulated sugar topping and I had plenty of leftover sugar. My cookies were very light and delicate. I've been looking for a cardamom flavored cookie and these are it. They just taste like Christmas.

Nice. I substituted the lemon zest with orange zest and quite liked both sugar coatings.

This were rather plain and not nearly sweet enough or delicate enough. A disapointment considering all the rave reviews.

I made these without cardamom and with European butter. I rolled the dough into a log, then cut it into very thin slices after refrigerating. Sifted powdered sugar on top. They were rich and delicate, a very big hit at my party!

The only trouble is that I have five kinds of cardamom. (white, green, brown, black, decorticated) Hmm... guess I'll have to try it all five ways, won't I? I'll let you know how that comes out.

What a great change from the traditional holiday cookie! I prefer the granulated sugar version. They have become a regular on our holiday cookie list.

I thought it was great. I ground my own cardamom seeds and the favor was wonderful. I also used pecans for the first batch and amonds for the second batchsince I did not have walnuts on hand,

I made these again this year, I think they are great! I, too, prefer the granulated sugar coating, and I only used that one, and I still had extra of the mixture. These cookies have become a holiday tradition for me.

A very delicious, different kind of holiday cookie. I'll make them again. Next time I would use less sugar for the coating, there was a lot left over but otherwise a great success!

Elegant, flavorful and easy. Flakey and light, these turned out so well I plan to make another batch today and these will become a holiday staple around my house, for sure. I used a brand new jar of organic ground cardamom and it was nice and pungent. The house smells heavenly. The only unfortunate thing is that there is so much dusting sugar left over (of both kinds)... it's really not necessary to make all that just to coat these and now I'm left having to find another use for it, rather than toss it out. Also, I agree with the reviewer below, be careful about your flour! Follow the rules. Look up "how to measure flour, online, if not sure. Otherwise, these are fantastic.

(1) I suspect the tough cookies below may be result of too much flour. For years I've dismissed the "flour rules" as unnecessary. Then recently I read that scooping compacted flour directly from the bin can mean as much as 25% (that's alot!) more flour than specified. And since following the rules, several things (a new scone recipe, a much-made cracker, another cookie, and THIS cookie) have turned out light and lovely. I'm convinced! (2) Still, what was unusual about this recipe was the cardamon, which I love. But the flavor didn't come out as strongly as I'd hoped, so in the end, while light and enjoyable, this cookie was nothing special and won't be repeated.

I love these cookies. I prefer the ones with granulated sugar and cardamom, but like the ones with powdered sugar too. I must admit many of my friends do not like them because they are very dry and crumbly. If you like soft cookies, these are not for you. But the cardamom flavor is fantastic and different.

These were just awful, hard a little rocks. I'm keeping them in the back of my car instead of kitty litter in case I get stuck in the snow this year I can use them for traction.

These were too dry for my taste. Some of them acquired a slightly bitter taste. I don't know what went wrong? Any suggestions.

Super: fairly standard rich butter cookies, but the cardamom adds that extra touch. The two toppings are unnecessary; I would just use the powdered sugar and skip the other. I ground cardamon nuts with mortar and pestle, and amount seemed just right. I can't comment on whether the results of other cooks might have depended on whether they used fresh or not.

These were good cookies, but not as good as I was hoping for. They are great with coffee or tea. As for the cardamom, I bought some in NC, triple bagged it, and it still stunk up everything it came in contact with. My spice drawer still wreaks of it, yet it was not that present in the cookies. Perhaps I have become inured to the smell/taste.

CJ is right about squashing them - i thought they'd just ooze down into disk shapes... i found the cardamom to be a bit shy too. fresh is best?!

Cardamom is one of those spices that looses its kick once it has been ground. I bought some cardamom seeds and then ground them myself... boy were the pungent! This was a pretty easy straight forward recipe. The only thing I would add is that because there is no levening in these they tend to stay what ever shape you make them into. For regular cookie looking cookies I squashed them into disks instead of leaving them balls. These probably would be good for cut out cookies too (since they hold their shape). I got the best compliment on these... just as good as grandma's!

I thought these cookies were just pretty good, but everyone else thought they were excellent. I like the amount of cardamom in the recipe, I think anymore would be a little overwhelming.

I will definately make these cookies again. I baked them only until set, and they were tender and delicious.

I must have done something wrong. I cooked one batch for 25min, they were hard, especially on bottom. Second batch for only 20 - still hard. More lemon than cardamon taste. Maybe I used too many nuts(rounded cups) or chopped too small.

One of the best new cookie recipes I have tried. Just delilcious. Agree with review that would add more cardamom.

These cookies are going into the book for next year! I think I could have just eaten the dough by itself. I'd definitely add a bit more cardamom, though.

Wonderful Christmas cookies...easy, with a delightful cardamom taste. Am making another batch rigth now.
