This is all wrong. Tabbouleh is all about fresh parsley; so refrigerating it overnight is not a good option. Besides, the food processor is the wrong tool. Use a knife!

Pretty good, and easy to make. Was a little too liquidy.

This is a great recipe, but other tabouli recipes are calling to be explored (that's the only reason i won't make this again)...if you're familiar w/ bulgur at all, you'll know that the amount called for will feed a lot of people--the 6 servings would be generous main-course portions.

This is a delicious tabbouleh. I love to prepare dishes to set overnight. They are so much tastier when the flavors have melded. Thanks!
