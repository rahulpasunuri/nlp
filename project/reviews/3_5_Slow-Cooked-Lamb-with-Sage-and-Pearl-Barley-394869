I thought the recipe was delicious and I followed it exactly. One major issue was that the pearled barley took way way longer than 15-18 minutes to cook. I also used up all of the sauce from the lamb cooking the barley and then had to heat up additional chicken stock to add to the barley before it was finally cooked al dente.

This picture is gross; it makes me think of how victims of a mass burning would look. The recipe, however, sounds delicious; can't rate it as I haven't made it.

For Passover I substituted Barley with Quinoa and it turned out great. Also the color was much better then it would have been with the barley. I only had the meat in the oven for about an hour and a half because we had 2 medium size pieces of shoulder with bone. Next time I may make more of the sauce because it was delicious.

This reminds me of how my mom used to make lamb stew. I loved it. I bet you could make a ton of variations if you like.

Gorgeous to eat, not to look at. I pretty well followed the recipe, though I halved it (and cut down on the cooking time to have pink lamb), and served it with the Roasted Garlic Souffle here. It all takes on a grey, unappealing look, but the lamb was tender, and the barley ended up as a sort of a creamy, rich risotto. I kind of expected it, and the vegetables that were in with the lamb were thoroughly spent, so I captured their juices and discarded them, serving only the freshly cooked ones.

Made this recipe tonight with some healthy changes. Pearl barley is not as nutritious as hulled barley, which takes longer to cook. I soaked 1-1/2 cups of hulled barley overnight and added this to all the vegetables and lamb, with an additional cup of chicken stock and an additional 1/4 cup of Merlot wine. I also added one dried habanero pepper because I like a little heat. I cooked everything in the oven as per the recipe. I defatted the broth, and omitted the almonds, which seemed unnecessary with the nutty barley. The stew was delicious.

This recipe should not be in the Passover section as it contains barely: chametz.
