We will never make a turkey another way!

Made this as my first Thanksgiving turkey and it was fabulous! I did two twelve pound turkeys. I made the brine 48 hours ahead. Strained and brined the turkeys individually for 12 hours. I mostly followed the recipe, but didn't have leeks or anise. I increased the amount of fennel to make up for the anise and just skipped the leeks. The flavor didn't suffer for it. I trussed the turkeys and cooked both in individual roasting pans on the grill at the same time. I did one breast side down and one breast side up. The breast side down one was definitely more tender all around, but so much so that I couldn't flip it upright to brown the too; it started to fall apart! I also covered both pans to keep the juices in for almost the whole time, pulling the tin foil off for just the last 30 minutes. There were great juices left in the pans to make gravy, but the turkeys were so juicy we didn't bother. I'll definitely make these for Thanksgiving next year, if not every year. I don't see any reason to try another recipe! My whole family said this was the best turkey they'd ever had. An added bonus is that it kept the heat outside and freed up the oven for other things.

Wow! Didn't do the barbecue part, because I wanted a roasted turkey with stuffing and gravy. But everyone was blown away by the brining results. Absolutely the juiciest, loveliest turkey anyone at the table had ever eaten. The flaors were subtle, not overwhelming. The only change I made was to omit the star anise. I was afraid we'd taste it, and it's not my favorte. Added the turkey without straining out the solids just because I was in a hurry. This is now my go to turkey recipe.

We were first time briners last year and we all agreed this was our NEW way of preparing our turkey. Last year we used the grill and the indirect cooking method but this year we will be using the rotisserie, can't wait. We also used our cooler with a trash bag for the brine process. I guess my one tip (or 3) is to prep, prep, prep. It makes life so much easier and you end up looking like a PRO. This is the simplest way to prepare the turkey for the best results imaginable. I think the only drawback to rotisserie cooking is that you still need to put a turkey in the oven for that awesome stuffing that it creates. Don't over think it just enjoy the process. Get that turkey on the grill and have a nice beverage.

This turkey did not turn out well for us. After just an hour or so on the grill, the skin was black and the meat was almost done. Not sure what we did wrong, but we almost had to order pizza. Sad.

This is a great recipe and the star anise gives such a subtle taste--it's a great addition. My husband is the turkey expert in our family and he loved this recipe. He followed the recipe as written except he roasted it in the oven and he didn't discard the veggies. He rinsed them a bit to take out some of the salt and then made soup which was also delicious. He also did not baste it every 15 minutes--that seemed unnecessary.

This is a winner. Simple and easy. We used a cooler and trash bag to contain the brine and our two turkeys. This will be our go-to on Thanksgiving. We prepared our turkeys on a propane grill, be sure to have enough gas to finish the job. We added traditional stuffing to one and stuffed the other with fruit. Both turned out great including the stuffing. The turkeys were done to perfection in a little over 3 hours. Plenty of time to let them fully rest covered with foil. In fact the turkeys were still very warm after resting for over an hour. People will think you are an incredible daring chef preparing their turkey in this manner. Good Luck and have some fun.

Wow! We used this recipe for 2008 Thanksgiving -- best brined turkey ever! I made one change in the recipe -- I added the vegetables and herbs and spices and simmered for 2 hours, then cooled and strained the brine. Followed all other instructions exactly. Much better flavor than the "deconstructed turkey" recipe we used last year. While I'm always open to try something new, I actually think we will use this recipe forever.

I used this recipe for Thanksgiving, and my guests told me this was the best turkey they ever had. Moist and flavorful. I used fresh organic herbs and spices in my brine, and added more black pepper than the recipe calls for.

This brine was a lot of work and the end result of the brine was no different than far simpler recipes. I found the overwhelming use of vegetables required and then suggesting they be discarded was a horrible waste. I saved the vegetables and herbs for other uses. I used some of the vegatables with the turkey gizzards to simmer and make my gravy. I simmered the remaining amount in 1/2 no sodium chicken broth and 1/2 water (about 6 cups of each) and then made a great turkey soup with one-half the stock and a vegetable soup with the remaining one-half.

Thank you Traci!! I did the brine exactly as written, except I didn't strain, and I didn't have star anise. I brined overnight, dried it off, rubbed it with a dry mix of salt, pepper, sage, rosemary and paprika, threw some aromatics in the cavity and roasted in the oven. What raves!! The moistest, most flavorful turkey any of us had every had - I even converted some white-meat only eaters to dark meat with this one. I've found my Thanksgiving brine from now on.

It was a bit of a challenge working with 2 gallons of water and all the other ingredients in a home kitchen, but worth it. My only complaint is that, like several other recipes in this Traci Des Jardins menu, the instructions were poorly written and/or edited. In this case, just exactly how do you baste every 15 min. AND not open the lid often to keep the heat in and temperature constant? I opted to skip the basting and rely on the brining. It was the right move. I accidentally mis-timed my 15 lb. turkey and got it up to over 180 degrees, but it was still plenty moist and the subtle flavors from the aromatics in the brine made the meat taste wonderful.

Note: we just used the brine for a roasted 18 pound turkey rather than BBQ. We doubled the recipe to have enough brine for the brining bag we had, and some left over for an additional turkey breast which we fried. We soaked the brine in the fridge for a bitr longer than the recipe suggests, overnight plus a work day. The brine worked wonderfully. It was probably the best turkey we have ever made. It is aromatic yes, but don't let that deter you. For the brine, we did add quite a few cloves of garlic. We will be using this one again.

The brine was fabulous and the turkey was perfect, although cooking time was almost three hours for a twenty pound bird.

baste every 15 minutes and avoid opening the lid too often to maintain temp...right

I've prepared the brine ahead of time and I have to say it smells REALLY bad. Honestly I am worried about putting my bird in it. Has anyone used this recipe yet and have any advice?
