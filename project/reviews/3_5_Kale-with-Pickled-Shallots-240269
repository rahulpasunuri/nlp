This is a simple, very healthy and very tasty kale recipe. I use rice wine vinegar and let the shallots pickle while I make other parts of the meal to bring out the full flavor. Highly recommended!

I made this for a dinner party. Because I was focussed on other things, I let the shallots sit maybe 40 minutes before adding them to the kale. It was tart, but delicious, and got rave reviews from our guests. Strongly recommended.

I really liked this recipe. I didn't think it was too vinegar-y -- it might depend on what kind of red wine vinegar you are using, the quality, etc. You could perhaps sub half red, half rice wine vinegar for a milder taste. I also added a few whole allspice to the mixture which gave it a nice flavor and sliced the shallots very thin on a mandoline so the marinade would seep in more. Also, the shallots are really better after they've marinated overnight. I also tried them on a chicken salad sandwich and that was delicious as well.

This is good but I would cut back on the red vinegar. Cut back and you've added half a fork to the rating.
