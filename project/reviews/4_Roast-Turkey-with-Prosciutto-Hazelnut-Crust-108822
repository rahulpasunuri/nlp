I thought this turkey turned out well - very moist and full of flavor. However it was definitely on the salty side and I didn't feel that it blended with the other dishes I made for Christmas dinner as well other turkey recipes I've tried previously (the honey brined in specific). I think I would probably make this again, but I'd leave out the extra salt from the butter and use no salt chicken broth.

With so many ingredients and so much writing it looks like a difficult recipe, but as a person who knows next to nothing in the kitchen I can say this isn't true. I made it for Thanksgiving while living in Italy for all my non-American friends and it was a huge hit. I can humbly say it was the best turkey I'd ever eaten.

This was easy to make and made a great presentation. The meat was extremely tender. I took the advice of a previous poster and made my butter a few days in advance and froze it. When the time comes to make this again I will be sure the butter is closer to room temp. I had it thawing but it was still a little hard to spread. Overall my guests really liked it. Very cool recipe to make TY Epi.

WOW - Fantastic flavour and the butter under the skin kept the turkey super moist while still being cooked through. While the preparation was labour intensive, it was worth the effort. I pushed the butter under the skin as directed, but left the outer layer off at first. We rubbed on the outer layer about an hour before the turkey was done. It is much easier to push the butter between the meat and the skin if it is really cold, so I would recommend keeping the butter really cold until you are ready to go. I used the leftover butter on steaks the following night and this was a great success as well. Next time, I am going to double the butter recipe and freeze half so all the hard work is done for next time. All the guests agreed it was one of the best turkeys they had, and the gravy was sensational!

I make a different turkey every year out of principle... I have a reputation to uphold you know. But this is one of the best ever, very rich, a little time consuming, but fantastic. used the brine from the "cider brined and glazed turkey" recipe before hand. Also looks fantastic with browned prosciutto and nut bits adding texture to the skin. The gravy is pretty superb too. Traditional- tasting, but also really well worked out. Might have to make it again.

I've made this recipe 3 or 4 times and everyone loves it! It's extremely moist and flavorful. I always make sure to brine the turkey overnight and I think that makes a big difference in how moist it is. The gravy has a wonderful flavor as well.

Definitely the best Turkey I have ever made. All the extra work is definitely worth it. I have made it 4 times, all to rave reviews. I even impressed my mother!

This was an amazing recipe, I used it for a stuffing actually and added one can of chopped black olives. I also used epicurious recipe "Sausage fennel stuffing". The two recipes complemented each other into the best stuffing I have make in a long time with the exception of my mother (Portuguese) who has made a similar stuffing recipe for a couple of generations. These two were pretty darn close.

I have made this turkey for many years. However, I replace the hazelnuts with pinenuts and serve an itailian sausage dressing. Yummy

I make this turkey every year and it is wonderful. However, a note to the last reviewer - Frangelico is made from hazelnuts!

I made this a few years ago and it has been requested every year since. I follow the Alton Brown method and do not baste. I open the oven only when absolutely necessary. Always turns out tender and delicious. This is my family's favorite turkey each year. (We always have at least 3!) This year, as I'm cooking for someone with nut allergies, I'm going to substitute Frangelico for the hazelnuts. I'll let you know how it turns out.

This turkey was AMAZING! My entire family loved it and begged it to be part of our Thanksgiving traditions forever. Only thing I did differently was brined turkey overnight for 10 hours. Cooked turkey upside down for first 1 1/2 hours then turned over. Turkey was perfect and by far the juciest turkey ever.

This turkey turned out moist and delicious. It was the best turkey I've ever had in my life! We tented the breast for the first two hours and then roasted it uncovered for the remaining time. The gravy base was well worth the effort, although we did not chop up the neck and gizzard into the gravy. Fantastic receipe!

This is a staple dish at Thanksgiving. I have family members who wait all year to have this turkey. Make sure you brine it to make extra juicy. Gravy is good enough to drink from a glass.

I made this for my first turkey ever and it was fantastic. The second time was even better since I butterflied the turkey, so it cooked evenly, and had the pan of stuffing catch the drippings. Amazing. Make sure you use unsalted butter and low sodium broth or it gets too salty from the prosciutto. Also added hazelnuts and chestnuts to the dressing. Left overs did not make it a day!

I have made this a few times already and it's become a tradition. This year I forgot to purchase prosciutto so I used bacon. I cooked it just until done but not crispy and then chopped it. The turkey still had a wonderful flavor. I may use the bacon again since it's less expensive than prosciutto.

This was only the second time I've made a turkey but after the disaster I had the first time, I never thought I'd try again. I had to though when the family decided to come to my house this past thanksgiving. I used this recipe and everything turned out fabulous! Absolutely will make again.

Best turkey ever..... will make again next year.

I also brined the turkey and it was delicious. The pan drippings had the most complex, deep flavors from the prosciutto. Didn't add any salt to the butter since I brined it. Everyone loved it. Also grinded the hazelnuts in a coffee grinder.

I made this last year to rave reviews and will make again this year. I used a boned, rolled and tied turkey breast.I usually brine my turkey but decided that with the proscuitto it might be too salty,so I omitted the brining. The breast was moist and perfectly flavored. The gravy was delicous!

I cooked two turkeys with this Prosciutto-hazelnut crust for 22 people. Two turkeys was a little overkill (I had never cooked for so many people) but I wasnt sure how much everyone would eat. Despite preparing too much, it was most certainly fun, and there was not much left over, everyone grabbed seconds or thirds. Everyone raved about the crust and how good it was. It was easy to follow, and prepare in my opinion. This was my first time cooking a Thanksgiving Turkey, and I plan on using this recipe a lot more!

i have made the prosciutto-hazelnut crust for the past two years and we are not going to get sick of it any timem soon, i can tell you that! this year, i brined my turkey first to get it that much more moist, and i felt that the combinaiton of the incredible butter and the brining made this turkey positivily melt. i used my family's traditional stuffing, but incorporated some of the butter in both that and the gravy. i did not grind the hazelnuts, but left them coarsley chopped. one caution: this bird can get salty very fast, so go light on extra salt and heavy on the fresh herbs.

Great recipe to have over the holidays. I tripled the prosciutto butter recipe as my husband loved it before I even put it on the turkey. That way I had enough to go around!

The procuitto butter was delicious! It would taste good on just about anything! The crust was great. I made easier gravy out of the pan drippings and 1/2 cup procutto butter. I just added flour until I got the desired consistancy and it was fabulous!

Followed the recipe exactly and WOW! What a wonderful and different turkey recipe! Didn't have any trouble keeping the crust on - thought it might slide off but it stayed right where I put it. Also didn't really seem like much extra work then a usual turkey - but did prepare the prosciutto butter two days ahead. We all just wanted to keep eating that crust - it was amazing. But with all that butter how could you not have a moist delicious bird? Will absolutely make again. And going to try the butter crust on other cuts of meat too.

We all liked it, but I thought it was rather a lot of work, and I had a terrible time getting the "crust" to stay on the turkey and not on my hands. That said, how bad can anything be if it's got prosciutto and hazelnuts? I really did like it, but I'm on the fence as to whether I would make it again.

This was very good. White meat seemed to be the most tender and moist of any turkey I've done. While we all did enjoy it, it's a lot of extra effort that I'm not certain is worth it.

I made this with two turkey's this year. One I used my regular oven and the other I used my smoker. I smoked it over apple wood. I had my guest pick which one they liked better and a large majority picked the smoked one.

I made it last night for Thanksgiving. Absolutely delicious. I took a couple of shortcuts. I ground the hazelnuts in a coffee/spice grinder to save time, and I omitted the white wine from the gravy because I didn't feel like opening a bottle (just added extra stock to compensate for the liquid difference). Also, I used bottled savory instead of summer savory because I couldn't find it in the stores. I also stuffed the turkey with homemade stuffing (very simple, just fried up some onions, bacon & proscuitto with white bread and chicken stock to moisten). I also added a sprig of rosemary inside the turkey. Instead of using canned broth, I made my own chicken broth (very easy, just boil soup bones with thyme, chicken bouillon cube). I cut down on the butter, using just one stick of unsalted organic butter in total with an 11lb turkey.

WOW! This Thanksgiving was a BIG gathering with about 25 guest this year, and this recipe was a Big hit. One suggestion is to brine your turkey before hand. This was the first time I brined the turkey, and I think the combination of the recipe and the brining was beyond compare! I call it my 'send the turkey to the spa the night before' recipe. The gravy was outstanding as well. I also made the stuffing from the Stuffed onion recipe and just baked it in a pan separately. I would definitely make this again without specific ocassion. Desert was Baked Pears with Gorgonzola also on this site. Really simple, prep in advance. Served with vanilla ice cream and chocolate raspberry drizzle....excuse me while I let out my belt buckle.

I liked the turkey alot and it had nice flavor. I am allergic to nuts, so I omitted them from the recipe. My gravy was a bit salty too. I brined my turkey, that may account for salty pan juices. The stuffing was the best! A good turkey, but I liked the porcini rubbed turkey from last year better.
