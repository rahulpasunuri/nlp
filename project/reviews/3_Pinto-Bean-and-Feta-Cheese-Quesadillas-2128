I just finished making and eating this dish. It sounds really good, but I must admit that I did NOT really enjoy this recipe. It was not very fun to make nor was it exciting to eat. I am going to let other people try it, but it definitely needs something on the side such as salsa, nacho cheese, or guacamole to make it anything special.

We didn't like this at all. We thought it was unexciting. We will not make this again.

The cilantro is a must-add. My only complaint is that I don't have a food processor, and the mixture was very hard to mash in the blender. I don't know if I'll bother next time. Still, the results were delicious, and we couldn't get enough!

I followed others' advice in replacing the parsley with cilantro. I used only 1 can of beans, and decreased slightly the amounts of the other ingredients to match. Tried it with feta, but found it a little dry. Next time I used Monterey jack and it was delicious! I thank this recipe for getting me to try whole wheat torillas as well--very yummy and full of fiber, they're a keeper. I think I'll try the recipe with my favorite bean next--black beans.

I had wanted to try this for a while...it was my first "snow day" meal during our big storm down here in DC. I thought the bean mixture was yummy, and I used goat cheese instead of feta because that's what I had on hand. It was good, but the ones I made with a colby-jack cheese mixture were better. A good basic recipe to play with, though.

I printed the receipe out ages ago and only made it last night. It would have definately been better with cilantro. Also the taste of the onion was very harsh. Perhaps I just had a strong onion, but I think next time I will saute the onions first. I was really disappointed, but I like the concept enough to try again with a few changes.

I too have been making this since it first appeared. Great as an app or as a vegetarian main course. Loved by my family and all guests who have ever had it. Easy and healthy - what more could you want?

Loved the ease of preparation. I followed the recipe exactly and thought the results were very tasty. Kept the extra filling and made more for lunch the following day. Good midweek supper with a salad.

Easy & healthy, filling and satisfying. We omitted the jalepenos, and used cilantro as other readers recommended. Plus, guacamole is a must, made with avocadoes, tomatoes, diced red onion, chili powder, cumin and lime juice. Yum!

Was a tasty and easy dish. Have made it twice already. It's a nice change from broring cheddar cheese and veggie quesadillas. I used cilantro instead of parsley. This adds more of a kick than parsley. Would be great for casual entertaining.

I've been making this since the recipe first appeared 7 (yikes!!) years ago. I started making it as an after-school snack; and the kids nick-named them "beanos." Kids have grown and left home and we're still eating them, with soup, for supper. You can really play with the recipe, perhaps that's why it's such a keeper. It's great as it is, but also fun with cheddar, black beans, green chilis, etc.

I made it for some friends for the first time. I used cilantro instead of parsley, extra spices, added salt, pepper, and cayenne. I then processed it to a paste-like consistency. I also added more feta than the recipe called for. And served it with chopped avocado. It was yummy, but certainly not outstanding. The filling had a nice zip. We think it would improve with the addition of a *bunch* more cheese. These people who rate it four forks? Absurd.

These quesdillas have become a favorite in our house. I took the suggestions made by the Cook from Cambridge -- cilantro instead of parsley (definitely), increased chili powder and cumin, and a tortilla "sandwich" -- and we love it.

WONDERFUL!

I agree, this was just so so, almost bland. I added jack cheese to leftovers which helped (though not the fat content) and I might possibilty try this again with black beans since they have more flavor.

I am only giving this a two fork because my husband actually liked it. I thought it smelled terrible and tasted worse. I won't be making this again. He can have it when I am traveling. I thought this sounded like a great recipe... blend the ingredients together, add the cheese, grill the quesadilla... what could go wrong? The flavor. That's what was wrong. Yuck!

Mighty tasty! I agree the parsley needs to be substituted for cilantro. Goes great with Margaritas.

MMMMM... This was delicious. I made this for my boyfriend tonight and it was fantastic, way better than I expected from tasting the pinto bean mixture. I made a few alterations -- for two people I used four whole wheat tortillas, a can of pinto beans, three scallions, cilantro instead of parsley, no jalapeno (unfortunately I was out), and a little extra chili powder and cumin. I recommend substituting cilantro for parsley. This was quite enough for a meal, along with quartered oranges, but this was so tasty that it left us wanting more! I was a little skeptical of feta in a Mexican dish, but it was perfect. I served this with diced avocado, which was fantastic -- as far as I'm concerned, the avocado is mandatory. This was a great, quick, healthy vegetarian meal that I will make time and time again. One note: use good quality canned pinto beans -- I like westbrae organic best. I actually made this with cooked dried organic pintos, and, believe it or not, it was much better with the westbrae; I guess canned beans have their place. I can't stop thinking about this recipe! This is the best recipe that I've found on Epicurious, and I don't expect to find anything to top it. Do yourself a favor and try this.

This recipe has become a "stand-by" for me. It is healthy, filling, and VERY tasty. I have passed it on to all my friends - it's wonderful !

These were tasty for something different (we eat burritos, enchiladas and veggie chili A LOT, so I'm always looking for variation). I didn't care for the crunch of the raw ingredients within filling. I might do a light saute of peppers and onions next time.

Love! Absolutly wonderful. I've tried it with and without the jalapeno pepper, I prefer without. Seved it with a fresh tomatoe, basil and olive oil salsa, it was delicious. Makes a great lunch. Must try this one!
