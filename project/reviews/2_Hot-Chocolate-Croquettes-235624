I'm going to choose not to rate the recipe, because I think I did something very wrong at the end. Like the previous reviewer, the chocolate was very soft, no matter how long I refrigerated it. The bottom reviewer must not have done something right, as I had no trouble piping my chocolate after 8 hours. Perhaps the freezer would be better after doing the egg and corn flakes? I think the issue is lightly brushing with the egg yolks...I think, in retrospect, that you need them well covered in egg or else they will disintegrate and become a charred ball of cocoa which happened to me. I think you would be better served to roll each "log" in the egg yolks, and let the excess drip off. Also, I found that either this made way more than indicated, or the logs need to be much bigger, hence my suggestion to freeze them before the battering and before the frying. I hate being beating by a recipe...perhaps I'll try this again with a much smaller amount and see what happens. The concept sounds good, the mass of expensive, burned chocolate, however, wasn't.

This recipe was a disaster for me. The chocolate was very soft and very, very sticky. It was very hard to work with or near. During frying, the pieces started coming part and were mostly just a hot mess, literally. Disclaimer: We managed to salvage a very small portion of this, and that portion was very good.

Pipe chilled ganache? Sorry, but this was a stupid thing to suggest unless you have a power piper and a metal piping bag. and to think, I only chilled it for 5 hours. DO we think it would have gotten softer after a couple more? and use a 1/4 inch piping tip for a 1/2 inch wide log? I'm a pretty good cook and I made adjustments, but these was very poor directions.
