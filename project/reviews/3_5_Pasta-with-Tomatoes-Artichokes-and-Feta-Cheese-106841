This was unexpectedly delicious and a great dish to throw together with whatever is on hand. Luckily I had all the ingredients, plus I added some, cleaning out the fridge at the same time. I used canned artichokes not frozen, added some beet greens into the saute with the onions, as well as some chopped chicken sausages that I had previously cooked. I only had a little bit of feta but it made a nice garnish on top. I don't think it needs parmesan - it was nice to have the vegetable flavors come through.

Loved this! I used baby bella mushrooms, couldn't find my artichokes so left those out and left out the olives also. Used 16oz of pasta so added an extra can of diced tomatoes (with oregano, garlic and basil). Also, I only had about 5oz of feta so I added a decent amount of parm-added a good flavor! Will be making this again I'm sure

Great quick weeknight recipe. I deglazed the garlic and onion with a little red wine. Subbed capers for olives and added a few mushrooms. My husband loved it and went back for seconds.

This was really good and easy. I thought the feta cheese made the dish. I added mushrooms and capers (I add capers to almost everything!) which were a good addition. I will definitely make it again.

I pretty much followed the recipe except that I used canned quartered artichoke hearts, tri-color gemelli pasta (nice touch!), and cut back on the feta by half. It was really good -- I loved this. It's easy, pretty, and completely tasty. I forgot to pepper and that would probably have been nice, but oh well. Definitely four fork enthusiasm.

I made a few changes to this. Whole wheat spaghetti (try it - wonderful texture), subbed the feta with some good parmesan. Feta just didn't sound right in this to me, the parm is great. Adds the right amount of saltiness, pecorino would work too. I could only find olives and 'choke hearts packed in oil, so even after rinsing they were still oily and added a bit more oiliness to this dish than I would have liked. I omitted the toasted pine nuts I was planning to ad because of this. Overall, it was really good. Great with some pinot grigio, reminds me a lot of the whole wheat spaghetti with swiss chard on the food network site. Definitely a quickie-dinner keeper!

This was excellent. I used dried herbs instead of the fresh rosemary, a yellow bell pepper instead of the sundried tomatoes, and I nixed the olives. Other than that followed recipe exactly, and it turned out great. The fresh basil is essential. Our guest for dinner that night had three helpings!

I would make this again. I liked the sun-dried tomatoes, but probably because the ones I used were fresh and not oil-packed. The ingredients in here are such a classic combination, that it is hard to mess this up. I would use less onions next time, but a definite keeper.

Made this dish tonight. It makes a great weeknight supper as it is quick (and even tasty enough to serve to company). As you can read from many of the reviews, the recipe can easily be adapted to suit your taste. I cooked the onion slowly for longer than indicated (prefer the taste and texture), and used dried rosemary (didn't have fresh), canned quartered artichokes, and a light touch with the sun-dried tomatoes. We added a bit of freshly grated parmesan at the table. A salad with balsamic vinaigrette and a whole wheat baguette completed the meal. Just great.

My vegetarian teenager pronounced this dish exceptional. I made this as written with the exception of using canned quartered artichoke hearts. Even more remarkable: I had every ingredient on hand and the recipe could not have been simpler. Everyone in the family raved.

This was a big hit for my dinner party. I think if I make it again I would increase the amount of artichoke and either cut back the amount of sundried tomatoes or possibly try replacing them with red bell peppers. The sd tomatoes were good but kind of took over the flavor of the dish.

This was delicious! I, too, used canned artichokes and they were great. Like some other reviewers, I will leave out the sundried tomatoes next time. In my opinion, they did nothing for the dish. Also, I cooked the onions and garlic for about 10 mins on med-low as I like my onions really soft in sauces. This recipe is a keeper.

This turned out great. Tastes like something from a good Italian restaurant. I used some frozen pesto I'd made this summer instead of the fresh basil. I left out the sun dried tomatoes, used about half of the feta cheese and used diced tomatoes with chilis (the chilis were accidental but added a nice bite.) I didn't have oregano and used dried rosemary. I also used canned artichokes. Wow. Love it. Can't wait to eat it for lunch again tomorrow.

Since I needed to use up some fresh tomatoes, I used them instead of canned--added a bit of leftover tomato sauce as well. Used marinated artichoke hearts instead of frozen. WONDERFUL dish! Will be making this again!!

This dish was excellent, a nice twist on tomato pasta and great veggie dish, I made it as is.

I too did not make this recipe as stated. But I first sauteed some shimp and took them out just before they were done. In the same pan, I added the other ingredients but omitted the artichokes. It was full of flavor in every bite-the feta, kalamatas, the tomatoes and the shrimp were delicious, it is part of my monthly rotation!

Okay, I confess, I didn't make it as specified. I followed the reviews and doubled the canned tomatoes and artichokes, and left out the sundried tomatoes because I didn't have any. It was delicious (I'm not even that fond of pasta), and my husband raved.

This is wonderful w/ orzo pasta. Toss w/ a bag of prepared salad greens for a different twist.

Taste was great, modifications were that I used Romano instead of feta and left out olives. When making again, I don't think I would use the sun-dried tomatoes. As much as I love them, the taste just didn't come through when competing with the artichokes and fresh tomatoes. Definitely will make again.

We tried this recipe while my in-laws were in town and it was a hit. Not only did the adults LOVE it, my finicky children did as well! If you have leftovers, they are just as good reheated the next day or you can eat it right out of the fridge as a cold pasta salad. WONDEFUL!

My Dad and I make this recipe when I go home while sharing a bottle of wine and a loaf of french bread. The fresh herbs, Walla-Walla onions, and good quality olive oil sauteed together make the house smell great! Increasing the fresh tomatoes, salt, and artichoke hearts combined with fresh herbs brings out the full flavors of the dish. Decreasing the feta cheese or using another milder cheese takes care of that "stinky feet" problem other cooks shared about. And above all, the colors of this dish make it the perfect dinner party center piece...I've had nothing but rave reviews!

Made this dish Sunday for some friends who are vegetarian. Everyone enjoyed it, we hardly missed the meat. If I made it again for non-vegetarians I think I would saute some bacon pieces with the onions to add some flavor & I would also use more diced tomatoes next time. Easy dish & tasty.

I'm not sure what happened. This tasted like feet. If I ever make it again (and I don't think I will), I'm cutting the oregano way back.

I decided to make this dish based on the two other good comments, and it turned out absolutely wonderful!!! The flavors in the dish were great and it did not take very long to make. The only modifications I made were due to not having the right ingredients - I used spiral pasta instead of linguine and gorgonzola cheese. I also added some mushrooms because we love mushrooms. It made a bunch. Great dish!

It was pretty easy to make, but, unlike the previous reviewers, I thought the dish was pretty bland myself. The flavors didn't seem to mesh very well. You taste the tomatoes, or the artichokes, or the cheese, but not really the combination of everything together. I won't be making this again.

i have made this dish several times for dinner guests and have gotten rave reviews i also used canned artichokes followed the recipe exactly but doubled the amount of feta cheese, used 2 cans of flavored diced tomatoes,and 1 cup of sundried oil packed drained tomatoes i also used fresh basil, oregano and rosemary and found these herbs enhanced the flavors

I HAVE MADE MANY RECIPES FROM THIS WEBSIGHT AND THIS DEFINETLY ONE OF MY FAVORITES.I USED CANNED ARTICHOKES INSTEAD OF FROZEN AND LEFT OUT THE OLIVES, THIS HAS A GREAT FLAVOR AND WONDERFUL PRESENTATION. IT WAS SO EAST TO MAKE, EVEN MY HUSBAND MAKES IT BY HIMSELF!
