Cipolline onions are more traditional for Italian dishes, but this is a really time-intensive recipe! I used frozen pearl onions the second time and got a very comparable result. I wasn't able to find the Trader Joe's prepped onions like the previous viewer said.

Trader Joes had a package of ready to go cipollini onions so I used this recipe and everyone raved about it. It was super easy since trade joes did all the prep work on the onions.

A whole lot of onions to boil and peel (did a double batch for Thanksgiving) but a good bonding experience with my soon-to-be son-in-law, and a great crowd pleaser. Nice change from the traditional creamed pearl onions!

Wonderful! I just used two sliced sweet onions and served this with beef brisket, garlic mashed potatoes and cooking light creamed spinach. I must have gotten 5 kisses from my husband thanking me for a terrific meal.

AMAZING!! I made this for a family dinner and everyone LOVED it! Couldn't get enough. I'll definately make this again and again. (I don't give four forks very often!)

Amazingly similar to braised baby carrots with oj and balsamic vinegar (May 05). Excellent product, I've seen versions containing kalmata olives, I'll try that too.

Very good. Added more OJ and cooked onions lot longer in pan.

This was a very good side for a dinner of roast chicken with gravy, potatoes with sea salt and roasted bell peppers. Just tasty and a perfect texture - the onions were pert without crunch. I did add a little more basalmic, though.

A bit too much balsamic....will reduce next time and increase oj as previously recommended...got rave reviews at Thankgiving dinner. Cipolline onions are more expensive than shallots, therefor I would use either shallots next time or stick with basic vidalias. Also, have made similar with sherry rather than balsamic and added sage for a spice.

I would make this again but using thickly sliced spanish onions. It is painstaking to peel the little onion. I used the juice of a real orange and doubled the quantity of juice called for by the recipe. Very tasty!
