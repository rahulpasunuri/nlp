your typical passover sponge cake...dry, bland & cardboard-tasting...

Very good passover cake. Plan on making it again.

Maybe it tastes good, but I like a nice presentation and a cake that drops in the middle does not do it for me!

Tasty, and my children liked it. Directions say bake for one hour; after 70 minutes I finally took it out of the oven, and it fell. Had an almost pudding-like consistency in the middle. Needs to cook at least 1 hour and 20 minutes, maybe even 1.5 hours.
