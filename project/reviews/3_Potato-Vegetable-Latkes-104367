Many recipes that are made by European Jews are also made by other folks in Europe. That would explain why you have a recipe that is similar. It may indeed be both Polish and Jewish.

i don't know why these recipes are called "jewish". I am polish-Catholic and this recipe is not jewish but polish.

This recipe definitely needs a little more kick (i.e. more spice than s&p) for adults. I added some garlic for a little zing and served with tzatziki (which made the dish and I found a faboulous recipe for on epicurious). Next time I will peel the zuchini (let a little bitter flavour with skin on) before grating and add some spices (probably corriander or cumin).

Change the potatoes to yams, add a red bell pepper and change "2 zucchini" to 1 and 1 squash. We also added fresh coriander, nutmeg, cinnamon, chinese 5-spice, red pepper, cardamom, and of course, lots of fresh ground pepper and salt to taste. I agree with the other reviewer that they are greasy, and might try broiling with a little butter on top next time.

This was very good and a great way to get kids to eat their vegetables. Like all latkes, they are quite greasy. I don't know if it will work, but next time I will try to bake the pancakes as an experiment. Regardless, my kids aged 2, 4 and 6 loved it.
