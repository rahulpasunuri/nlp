Excellent recipe!! The mushroom stuffing is fantastic and quite easy to prepare.

I'm not sure if I would make this again. I thought that this recipe was poorly written. First off... It should be only one half ounce package of dried mushrooms. Not 1.5 ounces of dried mushrooms. Secondly I would reduce the size of the cubed bread to a normal size (.5" or so). And finally... the giblets should probably be cooked before adding them to the stuffing. This is not mentioned, and should be common knowledge, but I would hate to see someone get sick from under cooked giblets. This may be reason for the one review that mentioned the overpowering taste. I personally left them out all together.

This dish was savory and tasty, but not outstanding.

This was a pretty cool recipe. Instead of thyme, I used rosemary. The difference was sharp and yummy. The chicken was tender. However, the next time I make this dish i will probably use duck or cornish hen. The stuffing received rave reviews from my husband.

This recipe leaves me with a mixed review. My husband and I liked the flavor of the dressing and of course the roast chicken was good but I can't call the sauce a sauce. It is sauteed mushrooms with chicken broth = very thin and bland. What you end up with is way too many mushrooms on your plate no matter how much you like mushrooms. A gravy-type sauce without mushrooms would work well with this recipe. Also, I would recommend making smaller than 1" cubes of the baguette.

Excellent dish and the stuffing is outstanding. You can substitute a few extra white mushrooms to save a little money and it would not be highly noticed.

This recipe was decently easy even for a novice cook like myself, and if you're a mushroom fan, I would highly recommend it!!

I normally don't like stuffing at all, the fact that I liked this one earns it 4 forks in my book! I plan to make the stuffing again for Thanksgiving.

I doubled the stuffing recipe and used it for a turkey, so I cannot say I followed the instructions word for word, but... I can't say I liked the stuffing. Even though I doubled the rest of ingredients, but only had one set of giblets, the giblets flavor predominated, and tasted far too strong. I thought that they would enhance the stuffing, not completely overpower it, so much so that it tasted only of that. It was also not very visually appealing... kind of ugly, actually, with all that black and mush sitting in a pretty white bowl. I won't be trying this one again.

It was a very nice and different stuffing recipe. Even the children liked it!

This recipe is delicious. I used portabello, oyster and cremini mushrooms for the stuffing and it was great! We baked the chicken in a clay pot and it was very moist. My entire family loved it!

This dish was a success! The chicken tasted superb and the mushroom stuffing was moist and delicious! Served with garlic mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts, it was a great Sunday dinner.
