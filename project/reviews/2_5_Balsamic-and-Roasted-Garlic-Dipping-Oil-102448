I love this recipe. It is better to serve warm, with warm bread. Be careful not to burn your garlic. 45min seems to be a bit too long.

This recipe was way to vinegary. I added additional garlic and proceeded with the recipe. The vinegar was too much.

I love this recipe. Incredibly simple to make, and a hit everytime I've made it. I love garlic, so I usually put in a little more than they recommend. Its best for me on rustic Italian or semolina bready. Good, good.

I can't rate this recipe as I haven't made it, but I had to point out that fresh garlic stored in oil does not "create" botulism. Nor does this recipe call for "fresh" garlic. It's cooked!! With *raw* garlic, if there are botulism bacteria already on the garlic it can grow in the oil (a no-oxygen environment) to where it can harm you. Simply store *raw* garlic and oil mixtures in the refrigerator and use up quickly. Also, the addition of vinegar in this recipe creates an inhospitable environment for most bacteria (too acidic).

YUCK!!! I did not like this at all. All I could taste was the vinegar.

Caution! Do NOT store this garlic oil for longer than one day: you can get really sick! Fresh garlic in olive oil, when stored, creates botulism. I can't believe that the recipe did not mention that.

Being a garlic lover I thought it was very good. Especially when dipping hard Pita Bread in it wraped around an olive.

I have had this at Grappa's many times. The chef told me it was made with canola oil not olive oil. I think that is the biggest difference in this recipe and the one the restaurant gave me. They have put together a video tape on how to make it and they say they never gave it to the magazine.

No way, this was gross. I had to throw it away before my dinner party. Very disappointing.

I liked this and some of the people at the party I took it to loved it.
