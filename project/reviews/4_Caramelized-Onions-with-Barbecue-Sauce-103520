made this a couple of times along a recipe called CHEESE SAUCE . Big hit and It's a nice variation from regular burgers

Loved these onions. They added a touch of panache to our burgers. They blend very well with the cheddar cheese called for in the linked burger recipe. I used Hunt's Original BBQ sauce, which worked very well. Made these in Germany and our German friends enjoyed them very much. Will definitely make again. Note, my sauce did not thicken. Perhaps I needed to increase the heat. This did not appear to affect the bold taste, however. I made these the night before and they kept wonderfully well.

Made this to go with the Barbecue Cheddar Burgers - everyone raved. I used the Beer & Molasses Barbecue Sauce recipe from this site for both dishes.

Yum! Yum! Same as for the cheddar burgers. Secret for success is to use your favorite bbq sauce.

These are excellent with the Barbeque Cheddar Burgers. No need to worry about the vinegar, it just makes a nice tangy topping for a burger.

I used regular brown onions. I used a scant tablespoon of vinegar and I'm glad I did becuase I think the vinegar could have over powered the recipe. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. We had the onioins with BBQ sausages. Will be making this dish again for sure! It was a great side dish.

Simply loved it. My brother who normally avoids onions, heaped so much on his plate that I had to make another batch.

I used this on top of a Boboli thin pizza crust. I added pork tenderloin and cheddar/jack cheese. I did cut back just a bit on the vinegar. Very good. I will make it again. The kids even ate it.

This was delicious and a great change of pace from the usual condiment tray items! Many people liked it so much they ate it plain as a side dish as well on their burgers & bratwursts! I had many requests to e-mail this recipe to guests.

I didn't give it a four, cuz, well, it's just a topping. But it is wicked easy to make and tastes great. A super way to spice up frozen vegie burgers!

The onions were tasty and very simple to make. I did not change a thing...I made them with Barbecued Cheddar Burgers and they were wonderful.

This is a great recipe. I am just sorry I didn't start making it in June when the recipe first appeared in the magazine. For looks,try to get the onions sliced fairly evenly--but no big deal if you don't.

MADE THIS LAST WEEK AND IT WAS DELICIOUS - VERY EASY AND YOU CAN ALSO USE THESE ON CHICKEN OR EVEN MEATLOAF TO JAZZ IT UP A BIT

Spectacular!! So easy to make and full of flavor. I used as a side with steaks and it was devoured in no time! I'll have to double or triple the recipe next time!

These are excellent....to die for!! Great for serving over hamburgers, steak or used just as a condiment. Next time, I will try in my slow cooker; definately will free up time and one less thing to worry about.

We made this using a major brand name barbecue suace, in the roasted garlic variety. We let it simmer in the crockpot instead of on top of the stove and by the time we were ready to use it the neighbors were stopping by to ask what that delightful aroma might be. This has since become what we all (my husband, my stepson, and I) all bring to a potluck, either with short ribs or brisket.

Bold addition to HO-HUM summer BBQ fare. Serve as condiment for chicken and grilled salmon. Add a small amount of your garden tomatoes (1/2C.), or add raisins.

MAKE THESE THIS WEEKEND! These are so easy to make and so delicious on hamburgers or hotdogs. Make in advance!

A friend gave me this or an almost identicle recipe a few years ago to use as a sandwich filling all by itself. Amazingly good! It never even occurred to me to use it on hamburgers. My husband loved it, too. I haven't made it in awhile. Thanks for the reminder.
