I love oranges/pomelo with olive oil so I thought I would love this; in the end it strikes me as something someone put together from leftovers in the fridge. I will try again (my pink grapefruit may not have been sweet enough), but somehow I think this is not a winner in our household. Also, a note to anyone making this, be sure to remove the membrane from the grapefruit sections before adding grapefruit to the mix.
