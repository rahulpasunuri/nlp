Worth the time and effort. Just a couple of changes: used neck bones, roasted celery along with other veggies, and deglazed roasting pan with 1. of sherry. Next time I make this I will double the recipe and freeze. Would be great to have and ice cube tray full, for quick pan sauces for steak! Can't wait.

Excellent recipe. I used all beef shanks and followed the rest as directed. Very flavorful, beautiful color - excellent recipe.

Excellent basic recipe. Particularly wonderful made with beef shank and oxtails. So good and much less messy than chicken broth. Freeze in servings, heat, add spinach and serve. Simple, light AND stick to your ribs. (egg noodles are really yummy in it too). Be sure and cook it at least full time - and longer if necessary. With the oxtails I cook it until the marrow comes out. Using a slow cooker makes it easier to just set it on in the am and let it go.

This is a very good beef stock recipe.Its the way I do it/But if you dont have veal shanks, the beef will do just fine.Also, you can use any beef bones like ribs,or whatever the butcher wants to throw away.ask him to give them to you.I get all these from my butcher, and make excellent stock.I also add a tomato or so and a tiny piece of fresh ginger.This gives it an excellent flavour.
