This was great for a Sunday night dinner after a late brunch. Instead of thickening with a corn starch slurry, I used a garlic goat cheese instead and served it on top of a toasted potato foccacio. It was really good.

Pairing of mushrooms and sage is delicious! However I found the combination of soy sauce, vinegar and sherry to be too acidic. Next time I might try making this with less vinegar.

Really simple and sophisticated. I might reduce the soy by half especially if using dark. Due to inventory issues I used brandy rather than sherry, and shallot instead of onion. It was still verryy yummy.

This is scrumptious and quick! I omitted the cornstarch - it was unnecessary, and served on toasts. Elegant and easy first course, worthy of company.

My family loved this recipe. Next time I would serve this over steak or chicken. The toast was flavorless and just soaked up the liquid. The ragout was salty enough with soy sauce, no need for extra salt.

My rating of 3 forks depends on the following modifications: Forget the toast, forget the water and cornstarch, and decrease the soy sauce by about half. Then you have a nice easy and low fat side dish of mushrooms to serve with any kind of meat - quite tasty, and you don't need to add any additional salt either, because the soy sauce provides plenty.
