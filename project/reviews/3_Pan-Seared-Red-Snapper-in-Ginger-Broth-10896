I was really looking forward to making this dish for a light dinner, but the ginger overpowered all of the other flavors. We didn't care for this at all.

Really nice, but it definitely does need some cayenne pepper. Thanks to those who suggested it. It needs that little extra kick.

We enjoyed this easy, healthful recipe, but found the ginger a bit overpowering. I'll cut it by half next time and reduce or even omit the sesame oil as I found that the taste disappeared under the ginger flavor. I made it with some lovely salmon trout and served with rice for a delicious, simple meal.

I agree with you guys. This is a great recipe, and subtle with its flavors. As a side dish, I served Jasmine Rice Timbales with Black and White Sesame Seeds, and we drank a Riesling. The tastes matched up perfectly. If you have any trouble finding the rice timbale recipe on Epicurious, feel free to email me.

I didn't have much hope, but this was WONDERFUL! I have made this recipe 4 times now. It works with any of the 'delicate' fishes. I used perch, too. I add an additional teaspoon of powdered ginger, and use Chinese cabbage instead of bok choy. The broth is good as a soup; try it without the fish!

I followed another reviewer's advice and added fish sauce and plenty of red chili pepper flakes, and it was delicious! I cut out the carrots (I find their flavor can sometimes dominate a broth) and added extra ginger. My husband and I couldn't get enough of this simple but fantastic dish.

I thought this was really excellent. A did make a few changes: I used fresh, french cut green beans in lieu of bok choy; I added half a large clove of garlic that I sliced to the broth while cooking; and because I am a spicey Louisianan, I added a couple of shakes of dried red pepper flakes. Also, I had fresh grouper instead of snapper which was excellent, I just had to cook it longer since it was thick. I slurped up my broth and my husband's leftovers too!

Needs more "Oomph!" I would add some fish sauce and maybe some chili oil. I used panaeng curry. I was not sure what "curry" powder I was to use.

I couldn't get red snapper, so I used striped sea bass. Excellent!

Great flavor. It had something you didn't expect and can be married well with other ideas for snapper. Be sure to keep the pressure on the fish when cooking.

Very good dish. I had no bok choy so I substituted jullienned red pepper and chinese pea pods. I also thought the fish could have used a little more flavor so next time I will put curry on both sides. I added a little red pepper to spice it up. The scotch sounded weird but the broth is delicious. Don't overcook the veggies!

Delicious light, ginger-flavoured broth. I added mushrooms with the bok choy leaves. Served with crusty beard and a fresh green salad, perfect for dinner with friends.

Red snapper can be expensive for regular meals, but this recipe does it well, and quickly.
