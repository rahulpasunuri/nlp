Excellent. Extra browning time. All 20 cloves mashed in. Perfect.

Also... I thicken the sauce with flour to give it a better consistency for dipping.

My home's favorite chicken recipe. I always add more cloves than the recipe calls for, and fry the chicken a little longer too. Minutes before it is done I add extra minced/crushed garlic to give it an extra kick. European-style crusty bread is perfect for dipping into the sauce.

This was just okay for my family. Tasty, but not very interesting. I won't make it again.

this recipe is great... except i use chicken breast and i double the liquid ingredients to make more sauce.this is great over rice or pasta... this is a frequent flier at my house

This recipe was amazing. I used about half the garlic because 20 cloves is too much for me.

My husband and I just don't get all the rave reviews of this recipe! Made it last night. I bake and cook a lot and am considered "gourmet"by friends and family but this dish just didn't wow us at all. Not worth the effort. I even added sauteed mushrooms and dash of lemon juice to try to flavor it up more. Not really very good at all in my opinion.

Added extra broth and this was fabulous! I actually smashed all of the garlic into the sauce, my family loves garlic. Simple, fast, and great to entertain with.

I make this recipe often as it's delicious and simple. One caveat: I find that making the recipe as written leaves too little sauce left over - so I always increase the amount of broth and add it (as needed) when the chicken is cooking.

Fantastic recipe! Fairly quick and easy to make. I used skinless chicken and I added more wine and broth in order to have more sauce. I also added mushrooms and a little butter and flour to thicken the sauce. I served it over a brown rice medely with steamed green beans. Next time I will chop the chicken into smaller pieces and add more garlic and some onions too. This dish will become a regular meal from now on!

my boyfriend said this is the best dish i've ever made. after i took the chicken out the first time, i baked it instead of cooking it back on the stove top. i made the sauce per the recipe and poured it over the chicken while it baked. so good!

This was really quite good. It reminded me a lot of a chinese garlic sauce I used to get at a takeaway back in NY. I served this with broccoli and white rice, which only heightened the memory.

I don't think I browned the chicken enough, but it still turned out delicious. This gave me the tender, flavorful chicken I wanted.

I have to make this dish again and give it a second shot. My garlic ended up burnt and there wasn't really any sauce to speak of, not sure why. It was still tasty though, so I can only imagine what it would be like if it came out right!

Simple and delicious. Made this according to the recipe. It just could have used a little more sauce.

I've made this a couple of times, and each time we like it better! Most recently, for my family of four (all boys but me!), I made these changes: 4 leg quarters, probably closer to 30 cloves of garlic, a 14.5 oz can of redcued fat/low sodium chicken broth, and about a cup of wine, and I omitted the parsley because I didn't have any. When I removed the chicken from the pan to make the sauce, I used my potato masher and mashed up all the garlic, let it simmer a little bit, decided I wanted it a little thicker (like gravy) and stirred in some flour. Simmer a little longer, and voila! This would also make a great chicken & rice dish -- shred the chicken, layer over rice, smother with sauce............. My mouth is watering already!

This is delicious! I cooked the chicken in the oven and made the sauce in the skillet like another person suggested. The chicken was juicy and was crispy. I also added 1 tbs of butter to sauce towards the end, a little water/cornstarch mix to thicken the sauce just a tad, and a squeeze of lemon to add another layer of flavor. Will definately make again!

Amazing wine pairing with Edna Valley Chardonnay, made the wine and food taste that much better!

Great flavor and very tender chicken. I used thighs instead of breast and such because they seem to hold their texture through the cooking. I would love to have added mushrooms as one of the other people suggested. Next time!

oh man was this delish. i will make this over and over again. i made this for my impossible-to-please grandmother, and we actually got into somewhat of a fight about it, and she STILL ended up raving about it, and insisted on getting the recipe from me (a first for her!!). i can't wait to eat this again.

This recipe is hard to screw up, and can be done a dozen different ways - all delicious. The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly, and though the flavor was lovely, it did not produce enough sauce for my taste and it was too greasy. So this time, when I made it, I used four chicken breasts (no skin), dredged them in flour and seared them on both sides for color and flavor in a bit of olive oil and butter, and kept them warm in the oven. Then, I used more garlic, and lots of homemade chicken broth and white wine. Lots and lots. You pretty much can't over-do it because you can boil off the excess after simmering for a while and at the end add a touch of cornstarch to thicken the mixture up a bit. Oh, and I added a bunch of sliced mushrooms, because they go with the sauce perfectly. After I did all that, I poured it over the chicken (after checking to make sure it was cooked through), spooned the sauce over the chicken and whole wheat couscous. The whole meal was very low fat and had incredible flavor. I love it, my husband loves it, and my cat loves it.

This is a fabulous recipe, the chicken came out perfect. This is a MUST in your collection!

Excellent...moist and tender! I used chicken tenders, omitted the flour, sprinkled the tenders with salt and pepper. Fried chicken tenders in 2 TBSP olive oil until slightly brown. Removed from pan and placed in a 9x13 dish. Put in 350 degree oven while I made the sauce. Poured sauce over chicken and then sprinked with parsley. My husband and four teenagers requested I make sandwiches from the leftovers...I will have to double the recipe next time I make it!

Do you ever wonder why chicken is floured and fried? It gives off more brown tidbits at the bottom of the pan to flavor the sauce. Do you know why the skin is kept on during cooking? It flavors the sauce. I am in favor of flavoring the sauce and then removing the skin from the chicken after cooked. Also if possible, cool the dish and then skim the grease. I guess I am tired of repeated reviews where the flour and skin are removed from the recipe. This recipe is a great basic as is or can be altered with herbs, cilantro, hot sauce, etc.

i skipped the flour, just browned in olive oil, crushed the garlic and used more of it. also used more wine and less stock (what was in the fridge!). added the accumulated juices from the plate back in with the chicken and a bit of crushed oregano. served with twice baked potatoes and broccoli. yum! got rave reviews from the husband :)

I made this for my family the other night, it was quick, easy and FABULOUS! The only changes I'd make (to be more health conscience) is I'd use skinless chicken breasts. Using chicken with the skin on made everything a bit too greasy. But overall, this dish was mouth watering great! I served with orzo with artichoke hearts--another epicurious recipe--delicious!

This dish is very similar to an old standard in my household. I recommend bumping up the amount of garlic. Everyone loves to smash up the extras in the rice or potatoes... yum.

I liked this chicken. I used thighs and took off the skin before browning. Also used a garlic/pepper blend spice on it. I also baked the chicken in the oven after browning it. The sauce was a bit too runny, so I just added some corn starch to thicken it a bit. Didnt have any white wine either, so I used a Hornsby's draft cider I had laying around. Will definitely make again, was easy and good with mashed taters!

Loved this recipe. Very easy, very flavorful.

I usually try a recipe as written before fine-tuning, but the other users' comments convinced me to make some changes right off, and it came out fantastic. I used organic chicken thighs. Dipped 'em in flour and seared them in 1/2 cup olive oil, 'til the skin was nice and crisp, then baked in the oven at 350--never put them back in the skillet. After the garlic cloves had been cooking in the wine (vermouth) and broth about 10 minutes, I added 1 tsp fresh thyme. Then I mashed/pressed the garlic and put it back into the sauce. 5 more minutes over low heat, then I swirled in a little lemon juice. The meat was done perfectly, still moist, and I just spooned the sauce over it. It was magnificent, and the husband loved it! Crisp skin, moist meat, perfect sauce.

...I mean to say that it doesn't TASTE garlicy. I guess that's what happens with cooked garlic.

This recipe was... ok. Here's what I'd do next time: I wouldn't use any flour, I'd take off the skins of the chicken and, I'd fry the chicken longer and let it cook in the wine-garlic-stock mixture for 18 minutes. I'd also use more garlic. The sauce was very gooey and not garlicy at all, and made the skin gooey too. It would be nice to have a lighter sauce.

...also: next time I'll serve with rice or some crusty bread to soak up the delicious sauce.

Just made this tonight- excellent. The steps and simmering take time, but this is very easy and delicious, and even though it seems like an insane amount of garlic, it cooks to a mild sweet final product; I'd even add more next time, really. Also: I needed to add more olive oil for cooking than the recipe suggests, and would add some white pepper next time. Aside from that, perfect.

We love garlic chicken and this recipe is a good bit healthier than our other versions, so it will probably become our recipe of choice for this dish. Still, the browned chicken did not stay crisp once cooked covered for so long--more of a "smothered" effect. I may play around with how to keep it crisp. The whole, roasted cloves in the sauce are wonderful spread on french bread slices as an accompaniment.

This dish was easy to prepare and tasted delicious. I was concerned that the garlic would be too strong and opted to crush and add only two cloves (rather than 8) in the final sauce. I also added a squeeze of lemon to the dish once plated, which enhanced flavors nicely. It's not particularly appealing in terms of presentation -- basically an off-white garlic-colored sauce on similarly colored chicken -- though the fresh parsley helps a bit.

Absolutely fantastic......I will be making it often.....I added a little extra wine, and the sauce is dynamite. GREAT RECIPE
