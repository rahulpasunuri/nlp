This recipe was far more simpler than I could have imagined. I didn't have duck breast, but I did have a duck to roast, so I used the same ingredients here so I would have the same flavor. Note: NEVER boil mung bean threads (cellophane noodles) in boiling water as described in this recipe. They will get very soggy quickly and have no flavor. I just pan-cooked them with leftover juices/duck fat that was in the roaster untl they were done -- about three to four minutes under close watch. Then the noodles soak up these wonderful flavors!
