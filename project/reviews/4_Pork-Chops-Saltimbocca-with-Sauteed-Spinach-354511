I brined the pork in 2 cups of milk and 2 tsp of salt to keep the pork moist. I didn't add an extra salt. I didn't do the spinach. My husband loved it. It was easy and the results were great!

This was good - but I'm not sure I will make it a staple in my house... Just wasn't for me I guess.

Definitely a keeper. It worked well with thin pork chops and I look forward to trying it with thick. Served with roasted finger potatoes and my wife dubbed me the pork chef from now on.

Yummmmmy and easy. I didn't have sage but I added oregano, which I thought was great. Also I substituted parmesan for fontina and sprinkled some on the top, too. Delish. Enjoy!

Very tasty and easy to prepare-used dried sage instead of fresh

It's the GO-TO. Have made this multiple times to rave reviews. I always brine my boneless Costco chops: 8 c water 1/4 c. kosher salt, some crushed garlic, pepper- for between 1/2 hr-2 hrs. Makes them super tender This time Trader Joe's was out of Fontina, I subbed w/Raclette and got raves raves raves. Served with sauteed arugula from the yard + mashed potatoes with garlic & olive oil.

THE best pork chop recipe!! I used canadain bacon for the prosciutto because I had it on hand. Even the spinach was outstanding. I wouldn't change another thing. I'll make it again with prosciutto.

Very easy recipe and very tasty. i took another reviewer's suggestion and used a pork loin sliced and pounded thin, which allowed me to cut deep pockets. Great to throw together on a weeknight. I served with couscous sprinkled with lemon juice.

Easy and tasty. My pork loin chops were a bit thin and so pockets weren't as deep as I would have liked. I therefore wrapped in prosciutto after browning in skillet and prior to placing in oven, to prevent cheese etc. from flowing out. Quite satisfied with result (though adding to saltiness) and I probably could have increased the cheese for even more flavour. Suggest not salting pork separately with this prep.

Another great Epicurious recipe that is a keeper. I am not big on pork chops but love pork tenderloin. I cut a couple tenderloins into 3" sections then pounded them to about an inch thick. I then proceeded with the recipe as if I were using a chop. I served with t he spinach and garlic roasted potatoes. It was delicious. Definately will be making this again !

The pork chop is a winner! I had thin chops, so I placed the Fontina and prosciutto on the chops after they came out of the oven. The sauce makes this dish. The lemon really perks up the pork. I used Smart Balance in place of butter.

Great recipe - simple to prepare but looks like it took a lot more effort when it is on the plate!

This is an amazing recipe and highly recommended. A few comments, I would purchase the pork loin chops at the Whole Foods (I think they carry the best meat). Pairings: couscous. I would also go easy on the butter/lemon sauce at the end. I doubled the prosciutto and cheese and went easy on the sage. I ended up baking the pork for 10 minutes after frying it for about 5 minutes on each side.

Absolutely wonderful! I sprinkled the chops with a bit of lemon zest and it was delicious! With the spinach I served baked sweet potatoes and got rave reviews! Definitely one of the best ways to eat pork chops.

This is THE best way to prepare and serve a pork chop. The spinach is a perfect side!

One of the best recipes on Epicurious! It is as easy as it is delicious. As suggested by another reviewer, we used boneless pork chops. We also used Black Forest Ham which worked well. The fontina cheese, more expensive than other varieties, and the sage leaves elevated this recipe from very good to outstanding.

Quick and easy...and fantastic. A new favorite.

Very easy to prepare and with delicious results. Husband loved this. I used bone-in, 1 inch think center chops, and needed more cooking time. Next time I will brown both sides, maybe add a minute or two in the oven as well.

great! and extremely easy! a bit salty so be weary when seasoning your meat. the spinach (which i'm normally not a fan of) was simple and delicious.

Rating: 3
Quick & easy indeed! I salt my food a little more aggressively than most, but next time I'll cut back when seasoning the chops as the fontina/prosciutto combo provides quite a bit itself. The sauce couldn't be more simple, but still finishes the dish perfectly. A great weeknight option!

Very quick and easy. The sauce is what really makes it. I cooked the directed time and next time will cook less.

This was a hit with the sigO. True to its name it was certainly a bit salty for me. Next time I'll pair it with rice to perhaps cut the salt a bit.

This was very tasty, but the Fontina has a really strong taste that overcomes some of the other flavors. I will make this again, but next time use less cheese.

Agreed-absolutely delicious,quick and easy. Also used boneless chops and cooked about 2 minutes longer in the oven. Perfect!

This was so delicious. I used boneless pork chops and it turned out great. I also cooked it for a minute or two longer than the directions, and it was unnecessary. Next time I'll follow it exactly.

Made this last night. Easy and very tasty. I used good quality, thick chops. The sauce and the spinach compliment each other nicely.

I made this exactly as the recipe is written. It was delicious! Deglazing the pan with lemon was perfect.

Made exactly according to recipe, except I cooked it longer which wasn't necessary. Next time I won't change a thing. Quick, easy, and really good. The spinach is very straightforward but is a nice accompaniment.

Very good, but I think I used too much cheese. Keeping it subtle is key here.

Outstanding!! 6 hungry Poker Players, + 18 Pork Chops, equals 6 empty plates and 6 stuffed Poker Players!!
