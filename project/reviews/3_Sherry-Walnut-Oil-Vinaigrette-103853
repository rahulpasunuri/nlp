This is a delicious vinaigrette to lightly dress your salad greens. Serve with goat cheese toasts - yum.

I used La Tourangelle toasted walnut oil. A nice change from the usual vinaigrettes.

Mustard, sherry vinegard and walnut oil are salad dressing ingredients. When I combined them the results were chaos. The sherry and mustard fought over which would pummel the deliacte earthy walnut oil. It was acidic and chemically. The instructions are easy, and the oil and mustard make a great consistency. It shoud work, but I threw mine away. The consistency and potential earned two forks. If you happen to have these ingredients on hand (and those for a back-up dressing) give it a shot.
