This is a sound dish but not fantastic. The recipe bothers me in that it says to add salt and pepper "to taste" in 3 different places in the recipe. When I spend that much money and time making a dish, I would like the chef to go ahead and denote the amount of salt to put in so it's not under or over seasoned! And the chicken is to be cut into 1/2" strips which is way to big and clunky. It instead would've been better cut into cubes or coarsely shredded. I tasted no basil whatsoever in the dish so I might add more next time. Overall, the lasagna tastes like mediocre alfredo from a corporate restaurant.

Recipe works; however, I NEVER use no-boil lasagna. I NEVER BOIL my lasagna! I make sure there is always sauce next to the noodle layer. That's all. With bechamel,I make it a little looser to compensate( not a problem with tomato sauce). It works perfectly and saves TONS of TIME. This also works with other pastas used in casseroles. I don't buy into the no-boil gimmick.It's the same stuff, just costs more!

Yum! Died and gone to heaven! Possibly make the sauce with half the butter and flour for a thinner sauce. And cover with foil the first half hour of baking.

The sauce is fantastic, simple, but restaurant elegance. I did a different variation that was meatless, with bell peppers, roasted red peppers, and broccoli and it was very good.

After reading all the dire warnings about dryness, etc., I added my own changes to circumvent some of the issues. I was sure to season along the way, used fresh herbs when possible, dried chipotle flakes instead of hot sauce. I made 5 cups of bechamel by adding 2 extra T of flour and 1 extra cup of milk (I was using 1%) I reserved 2 cups of the sauce, spreading one on the bottom and one on the top, only I added some parmesan to the last cup before spreading it out, just to flavor it all... Another little trick I added was to briefly soak the noodles in hot water until pliable before layering them. Final change: I used a nice chicken sausage in place of the chicken and baby bellas for the mushrooms..... I was just using what I had on hand! Sorry! But I would say that I was very pleased with the result tastewise and in every other sense.

The first time I made this, I didn't have any chicken in the fridge, so I substituted spicy ground sausage. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. My family loves it so much I still haven't gone back to try it with chicken. (We call it "light brown" lasagne).

Delicious--I'll definitely make it again, but will lighten up on the thyme (a bit too strong flavored for me). Also, used fat free half/half and skim milk and low fat ricotta to lighten it up. Still came out great.

I wish I had been more generous with salting throughout the preparation as indicated in the recipe. I did shred the chicken because of a review of the chicken falling out and the lasagna held up great. It would have been perfect if I had salted it more.

In the middle of making this, it started reminding me of those dishes made with cream-of-mushroom soup. But it was really good anyway. Needs lots of salt and pepper at every step, inc. when you sautee the chicken. I felt there was too much chicken and not enough veggies, though, and the chicken strips were way too big and awkward. They basically tumbled out of the lasagna as we ate it, leaving it a veggie version with chicken on the side! Also, I used fresh basil with the ricotta and it was great. Would be fine with mozzarella added, but even richer and fattier... Really a delicious recipe as is with the precautions of enough salt and chopped-finer chicken. Does create a lot of dishes, though!

Rating: 4
My family loved this even though I managed to scorch the bechamel sauce. I used fresh herbs and added nutmeg and parmesean to 1 1/2 recipes of sauce. I included some fresh mozzerella with the ricotta layer. My young sons who have NEVER eaten mushrooms or cooked spinach had seconds and want to know when I'm going to make it again. I will soon!

Rating: 3
I made a vegetarian version of this dish. It came out pretty good, but I think next time, I'll add nutmeg to the bechamel sauce... it was lacking a bit of depth. I'll also use more spinach next time to make up for the lack of chicken. The pan was scraped clean though, by my tablemates! Thumbs up!

My husband LOVED this recipe! It was really flavorful and easy to make. I look forward to making it again. I used a local habanero sauce instead of the tabasco and regular lasgna noodles.

Rating: 2
Made it once as specified and found it lacked flavor. Because there's not a lot of sauce, everything came out pretty layered and not as "cooked together" and soft as I like my lasagna. Hard not to modify this--added layers of fresh mozarella, axed egg, increased garlic, decreased amount of ricotta and subbed in half mascarpone, used fresh herbs rather than dried, added Parmesan to sauce mixture and decreased butter amount in roux, which tended to make the sauce oily. But in that case, it's hardly the same recipe any longer.

I was hoping I'd love this, but it was just okay. Not sure why it didn't 'wow' us. Maybe should've used fresh or more herbs?

I poached the chicken the night before (had planned to make something else) and lightly sauteed next day with spices and butter. The lack of juices I'm sure accounts for the dryness in my lasagne so I can't fault the recipe really. Otherwise, nice comfort food. My one and half year old dug in before I could get his bib on! Based on previous complaints of glue and dryness, I kept a cup and half of the white sauce for the bottom and top and kept in some of the liquid from the spinach/shroom saute. Open a nice bottle of wine for the two tablespoons the recipe calls for, and you have a tasty dinner. (I do recommend "TURKEY SAUSAGE-SPINACH LASAGNA WITH SPICY TOMATO SAUCE" also from the site.)

I omitted the chicken altogether and added broccoli and carrots along with the mushrooms (portobellos) and spinach. I also topped with mozzarella and parmesan. Adding a few tablespoons of fresh basil or pesto to the ricotta mixture added an extra boost as well. Loved it, but VERY rich!

This is wonderful!! I made it vegetarian style using MorningStar Farms Mealstarters Chicken style for the chicken. Also added more mushrooms. I used blended tofu for the ricotta cheese and added about 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese in the layering. Very good. Thanks for a great recipe

Increase the 1/2 lb of mushrooms to 1 lb. and the spinach to 1 lb. Add some kind of shredded cheese like Fontina to the sauce.

Nice dish. The white sauce(bechamel) should be used in place of, or with ricotta cheese in ALL standard lasagne recipes. It makes it lighter and smoother, and is only a fraction of what ricotta costs. This is a typical Italian peasant style of making this classis dish. Enjoy!!

Rating: 2
It was pretty good, but I wasn't blown away or anything. I had to make some minor adjustments - my husband has an aversion to spinach, so I subbed a thinly sliced zuch. It just needed more...zing! More garlic or salt or cheese or something. I'll probably experiment with other lasagnes before I'd make this again.

Rating: 4
I made this in triplicate for a big party. I used low fat dairy when possible, and cooked the chicken a day ahead on a rimmed baking sheet sprinkled with the herbs and covered with foil. Instead of spinach, I used arugula as the honoree at the party loved it when she was in Italy one month prior. My female friends all cook, and asked me for the recipe. I would definitely make this recipe again.

YUM! My picky-eater daughter liked this so much, she insisted on having it in her lunch 2 days in a row, even after having had it for dinner twice in a week! We left out the mushrooms and Tabasco and used less chicken, and it was delicious. A bit time-consuming, but definitely worth it given the rave review from a tough critic!

I made this for a family gathering and everyone thought it was the best. Not your traditional tomato sauce lasagna, but this was very good. I told the children that I used shredded broccoli thinking they wouldn't eat it if they knew it was spinach and shrooms (which I shredded because of the kids). They had second helpings. One thing I did differently was that I boiled my lasagna first, the traditional way. I also added thinly sliced mozzerella to one of the layers. It was a bit time consuming to prepare, but for special events, it was great.

Use raw, hard, uncooked lasagna for the rest of your days. Just make your lasagna as usual with the sauce on the bottom, then pasta, then sauce, then cheese, then sauce etc... and just add your dry hard lasagna as if it were cooked, when you get to the top, add your sauce as usual but OMIT THE CHEESE. Slowly add a lightly seasoned stock or just plain old H2O to a corner of your lasagna until the liquid comes just level with your last layer. Make a tight seal using first a layer of plastic wrap, then a layer of foil. This will NOT BURN OR MELT!!! Bake in a 350 deg oven till done! TILL DONE??? Yes, till done..,.depending on the depth of your dish, times vary. I have found it takes about 1-1/2 hours @350 deg F for your basic everyday lasagna. As SOON as the pasta comes out of the oven, uncover it and then add your cheese. The cheese will melt beautifully. Let the dish relax for 1/2 hour and DIG IN!!! I make all my restaurant lasagnas this way in 2 in. hotel pans (aka 200 pans), no matter WHAT the ingredients (there are "delicate" exceptions). Works like a charm. No more expensive "no-cook" lasagna sheets and certainly no more pain in the butt cook lasagna :(

I first made this recipe for a group of vegetarians and I used zucchini and onion in place of the chicken. That must have helped, because even without doubling the sauce, this lasagne was delicious--not dry at all.

This can be a bit complicated, but overall is worth the effort. It's a little bland (we like spicy foods) so I through in some red pepper just to give it a small kick. I've served it at dinner parties and gotten rave reviews.

I hade this recipe when the 1997 issue came out, and on occasion since then. I think the no boil lasagne noodles are a must. (I have had great results with Barilla.) On my first try, it was a bit bland so on the next tries I added heaping (rather than exact) measurements of the tabasco and herbs. Other than that, I didn't alter the recipe and the result is wonderful. My dinner guest always rave about it. Enjoy!

Bland. Bland bland bland. Just... lacked something. Even with all the herbs. So... given that lasagne takes some preparation and there are many absolutely fabulous recipes on this site, I would not make this again.

This was very good. My guests loved it. I did tweak it a bit since so many of the reviews suggested it. I made 1.5 times the amount of white sauce and reserved 2 cups for the top. This was enough to prevent the top layer from becoming crispy. I added 3 times the amount of garlic to the chicken and spinach mixture and also doubled the amount of ricotta. I didn't think I'd have enough to spread over two layers. I also added an additional 1/2 cup of grated parmensan to the chicken mixture and 1 cup of grated provolone to the ricotta. I was quite pleased with the end result.

I wanted something other than a traditional lasagne so I looked this up, read the reviews and followed by adding extra herbs and sauce. I also used regular cooked lasagne, I don't trust the no boil kind. It turned out rather well. I liked it but I think it was missing something. I will add red and green bell peppers next time. My husband loved it.

My family loved this. HOwever I did spice up chicken and spinach mixture and cream sauce. Also I added mozzarella cheese on top of ricotta mixture. I substituted sour cream for ricotta cheese. I also doubled sauce so the mixture would not be dry like other readers said. Great the next day and maybe even better. The nice thing about this recipe is there is no cream in it but it tastes like it because of sauce made with flour and milk.

I'm not sure why, but I wasn't crazy about this dish. However, my husband and kids, and our guest that evening, were wild about it. My husband even asked me to make it again for a work thing he was doing. I didn't do it, but I will make this again for my family.

After reading all the so-so reviews, I was leery of trying this one. However, I went ahead with it, making the following changes. We are a small family so I scaled it down to fit an 8" square pan. I doubled the amount of dried herbs, and made 3/4 the amount of white sauce, adding a generous 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan after cooking it. I cut the chicken mixture in half, as well as the mushrooms and spinach, but added in two zucchini, sliced and steamed, and two bunches of sliced scallions. Kept the ricotta mixture at the full amount, but added in about 4 oz. of grated mozzarella. The results were moist, rich and very herb-y. I'll play around with this one some more.

The first time I made this recipe according to the directions I found it rather bland. The next time, I sprinkled a "little" red pepper flakes on the chicken while cooking and used about 1 1/2 cups of left over ham (salty)shredded or cubed in the ricotta mixture. I also margarine and skim milk. Overall, the ham made it an incredibly tasty dish that received raves from all who tried it.

What a great party dish...my guests loved it and we gobbled up the leftovers for lunch the next day. I followed the recipe and had excellent results, although as other comments suggest, this is not an overly "saucy" lasange. I did add 2 cups shredded mozzarella (layered in) and maybe twice the parmesan the recipe calls for, but I'm sure it would have been great as is. I will definitely use this one again, as it seem a bit more elegant than traditional red sauce lasagne. Next time I will try fresh herbs instead of dried.

I made this with regular boil noodles and about half the chicken called for and it was great. Next time I might add another layer of parmesan in the middle to up the cheesiness. No problem with dryness.

Definitely follow previous tips to double the white sauce - I used chicken broth to make the second half. Also, quadruple the herbs - at a minimum! Next time I'll try roasting and shredding the chicken rather than sauteing it.

I found this lasagne to be quite dry. The chicken was dry, the top layer was crispy and very dry. There wasn't enough sauce to go around. Neither was there enough ricotta cheese to make any difference. No boil noodles didn't help. They didn't get moist enough, especially the top ones. I don't think anyone in my house liked this. This needs more sauce and more ricotta to come anywhere close to being edible. I was expecting something cheesy, this wasn't it.

Like some of the other reviewers, I'm torn about this one. I thought it was tasty, but not good enough to warrant the amount of fat in it. My husband, on the other hand, sucked down half the pan. I think I'd like it a little spicier...it needs "something" (although I'm not entirely sure what).

I'm afraid I have to differ from some of the reviews here. I didn't have a problem with dryness at all and my husband, who I thought might object to it because it wasn't the meat and tomato version, loved it and said how flavorful it was -- the taste of the herbs really came through. In fact, loved it so much am taking the recipe to England so I can make it there and my family can enjoy it on Boxing Day.

This is apparently my "signature" dish for large gatherings--my friends always request it. From my experience, dryness will not be a problem as long as you made sure you reserve enough sauce for the top layer. I once tried to make this for a vegitarian group; doubling the spinach and mushroom and deleting the chicken--yuck.

I have made this dish several times, and while the flavours are delicious, the problem is dryness. I doubled the quantity of white sauce and added more milk to make it thinner and also omitted the egg in the ricotta mixture and added milk instead. Make sure the top is completely covered with thick white sauce to keep it moist, and use fresh herbs when possible. The lasagne sheets can also be dipped in hot water to make them more pliable and easier to assemble.

Rating: 4
Yes, I found the basic sauce receipe a bit bland but jazzed it up with smoked mozzarella and more tabasco. The real secret to success I found was parboiling the no-boil noodles for about four minutes before assembling the dish. It comes out perfectly and I have had many requests for the receipe.

Rating: 1
After SO much prep, the result was disappointing and bland, bordering on geriatric. Thanks to all for suggesting 50% more sauce; I also recommend using regular lasagna to avoid the dryness many encountered. I would, however, not make it again without the following changes: (1) substitute 1/2 lb parma ham or prosciutto for 1/2 lb of chicken, (2)add two shallots, 2 to 6 TBSP chardonnay vinegar, porcini mushrooms, and perhaps nutmeg to filling, and(3)substitute smoked gouda for parmesan.

I made this for company last night. The preparation was quite time-consuming, but the resulting dish delicious!
