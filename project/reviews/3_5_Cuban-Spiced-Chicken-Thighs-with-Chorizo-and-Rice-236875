Taste is OK. There are better similar recipes out there. Not worth the effort.

OH, I did use long grain white rice and the cooking time was fine. Didn't overcook the meat. I also used smoked paprika.

My whole family loved this. I used skinless thighs and was glad I did as any more fat would have been a negative. I don't know how the skin would stay crispy and yummy if it was braising in the rice liquid. I added garlic to the marinade too. Very spicy and delicious. I'll make it a once a month-er in my house.

This was very tasty. As another reviewer commented, not sure as to how Cuban it is, as it reminded me more of a more flavourful paella minus the seafood. I would add some prawns at the end of cooking next time. I used smoked paprika to perpetuate the smokiness of the chorizo. All in all a nice recipe that can be cutomised to your taste and one I will probably make in some variation again.

I used brown rice and this resulted in overcooking the thighs. Next time, I'll simply add them in later, when the rice is further along. Loved the flavor. I subbed kielbasa for the chorizo and it was fine.

For all the spices and effort (as written, you have to babysit the stew/have to do something every 10 minutes or so), the dish turns out lacking in flavor and eye appeal (the entire dish ends up shades of beige and brown--OK, there are little red and green accents, but still, the rice and chicken end up the same color). The chicken definitely needs salt and pepper. A squirt of lime juice at serving time is the best thing one can do to help perk up this recipe. By the time my arborio rice got cooked, my chicken was slightly overcooked.

Very solid recipe, though not quite unspectacular. As others have mentioned, it is terrific comfort food. The recipe can be adjusted in all sorts of ways, which makes it fun. Well worth making again.

I think the spice level of this dish is too high. Not that I don't LOVE spicy foods, but there are so many potentially delicious, subtle, and expensive (saffron) flavors in this dish, and the spice just cancels all of that out.

This was quite delicious and original. I would add garlic to the marinade and salt and pepper the chicken after taking it out of the marinade next time. Also, I found the combination of seasonings could be adjusted to your taste. I would use more allspice and keep some of the jalapeno seeds next time and a squeeze of lime juice before serving was an enhancement. I will definitely make this again.

Can anyone tell me the best kind of chorizo? We used deli sliced, which was good, then raw sausages which we cooked in advance (not very good at all) Is there a pre-cooked deli version we should be using? Thanks

This was great - the flavors were wonderful. I agree you want to stick with the original bone-in thighs for flavor - but I am wondering if the skin could be optional. Oh, and you can find the piquillo peppers (jarred) at Trader Joe's.

This is tasty. I like jasmine rice so we used that. I'm not sure this is really "Cuban", but the flavors are very nice. Regarding the cook's review on 6/10/09 from Florida who is concerned about the reserve marinade--the marinade is added to the rice and cooked to a boil.

How can you you reserve marinade from raw chicken - never heard of this

I used Basmati rice rather than short grain/Arborio. It took longer to cook the rice and was not creamy. But still very tasty, I will make it again.

I wrote a review about this dish before but wanted to add something. Some of you said it's time consuming. Well I did this dish in 20 mins flat. I browned the thighs for 10 mins total turning once. I skipped the sausage all together. I sautéed the onions and added a can of diced tomatoes and all the seasonings. I used garlic, pepper, paprika and parsley only. Then added the rice and broth and then added the chicken back and cooked for 25 mins more. So it took about 20 mins for the whole prep and 25 mins to cook.

I'm becoming famous for my one pot chicken dishes. This one was a hit at last weekend's dinner party. The flavors are intense and complex and the dish has great eye appeal. On the downside, it is time-consuming to make and somewhat expensive, but worth it for a special occasion.

I love this recipe. It's great comfort food on a cold day. To make it healthier, I use boneless, skinless thighs and chicken chorizo. I don't bother with the saffron. Near the end I add frozen sweet corn. Sometimes I also add cubed yams. I serve it with sprinked parm. cheese and avocado (or guac.) on top with a lime wedge. Fabulous!!!

Made this without the sausage and some of the other ingredients and used boneless thighs. My family loved it. Will make again.

P.S. Saw note from those who used boneless -- BUT the bone-in keeps the chicken more tender, plus gives more flavor. It falls off the bone when simmered 45-50 mins. Re the "skin / soggy" comments, I browned skin down in the chorizo drippings, on med-high so it really, really sizzled, then turned for same -- this worked beautifully, and it draws a crowd!

Made for company, New Year's Eve. Very, very tasty. Need to simmer longer than called for; about 50 mins. Not as spicey as I thought it would be, so was good for teens who may not like real spicey dishes. I also squeezed out the uncooked chorizo from casings, discarding casings, and browned that: more even chorizo taste.

Yummy! This dish had great flavor, reminding me a little of cuban paella. I added a bit more spice and my guests loved it. I also braised it on the grill as it was too hot to start my oven - worked like a dream!

Fantastic meal, husband loved it. Made it without the Chorizo and still went well! Will make it next time with the Chorizo, however, would think it would quite salty.

Made this for guests and it turned out to be what we all thought was restaurant quality - excellently spicy and deelicious!

I made a half recipe and it easily served 4, so it seems like the full recipe would be 6 very very large servings. I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the fresh ones (a whole can for the half recipe) and I still had to add a little extra water as well. The chicken skin got soggy and I don't think that having the skin on was essential to the flavor of the dish, so next time I would try using boneless, skinless thighs instead.

More like 3.5 stars. I love one pot meals like this one. Lots of flavor with the chorizo and you can make it as spicy as you want by altering the amount of jalapeno. The rice would be yummy on its own. Definitely increase the liquid though and I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh. Great for a casual dinner with friends. Served with artichoke, romaine and cherry tomato salad from bon appetit, which is delicious.

This was a pretty good recipe. Not sure what made it "cuban" other than the lime and garlic...more like a paella really. Lots of bold flavors going on in it but it worked and was tasty. I used more liquid and cooked for 25 minutes and the rice cooked perfectly.

Rating: 4
Wow. Definitely worth marinating overnight for tender chicken. (I also used skinless/boneless breasts) Added double liquid but careful not to lift lid as rice will not cook properly.

Rating: 2
I made this with skinless and boneless thighs. I thought the dish was not pleasing visually, but good tasting. But the leftovers were awful, don't know why? Perhaps next time I would not press the meat down into the rice, so it keeps it's browned look, and use bone in instead.

We really enjoyed this. I can't believe others thought it lacked in flavor, it was layered complexly with intense flavor. One thing that doesn't work with the recipe is the proportion of rice to liquid. It is always one part rice to two parts liquid. This recipe is very short on the liquid. I only put in one cup of rice to 2 cups of broth and added a 14 ounce can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh. I too used jarred roasted red peppers instead of the pimentos on top, it turned out great and there was alot of rice while still using only 1 cup. I ended up using long grain rice because that is what I had on hand. Cooked it about 5 extra minutes. Will make again.

We love spicy, saucy chicken dishes and this is a good one to add to the file. I used half cilantro and half parsley. We primarily use brown rice these days, so cooking time was a bit off (requires almost double), but other than that the recipe is good as written. In winter will substitute canned diced for the fresh.

This was a very tasty & aromatic dish. I'm lazy, so just smooshed the marinade ingredients around in the plastic bag, then added the chicken.

Made this last night and my group is leaning toward 3.5 forks. I added lime juice at the end and a different chili (how could two stores be out of jalapenos?) but it was spicy and delicious. Easy enough for a weeknight dinner but a possibility for guests, too. Definitely worth repeating.

Even if it is not Cuban, I loved this reipe. Made it twice, second time I used more broth, took the skin off half the chicken thighs to cut on the fat, cooked it a bit longer, and served it w/ lime wedges. All my dinner guests wanted the reipe.

I boned the thighs and substituted parsley for the cilantro, since I am not a fan of cilantro. It was delicious, but I also had trouble with the rice not cooking in the stated time. Next time I cook the rice about 10 minutes, then add the chicken, etc.

Whether or not this is authentic Cuban didn't matter to me or my family. Everyone absolutely loved this dish! Unlike some of the other reviews, we thought it was incredibly flavorful. It probably helped that I doubled some of the ingredients (garlic, and other seasonings). The type of chorizo also probably makes a difference, the kind I get is absolutely delicious.

I thought the chicken would be more flavorful than it was. I marinated the chicken overnight and it still lacked flavor and salt. Next time I'll add more lemon juice and seasonings. This dish did not taste Cuban, it was more Spanish with the smoky flavors of the paprika, saffron and chorizo. It wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Probably won't make it again unless I seriously adjust the recipe.

Cubans do not use hot peppers of any kind. This is Mexican-style

This was very good - similar to a jambalaya but with a more complex flavor. Instead of the piquillo peppers, I used roasted red peppers from a jar. This is great - either for a family supper or a casual dinner with friends.

Thought this dish was good, but not great. Not as spicy as I thought it would be (although I did not have the type of pepper that was supposed to top the chicken--not sure how that would have affected taste/heat). With so many interesting chicken recipes, I probably won't do this one again.

This was delicious, although more labor intensive than I originally thought when I first read the recipe.

I thought the flavor of the dish was delicious. And I loved the chicken, sausage, rice combination. However, the food was not finished cooking after the stated time. I had to finish the thighs off in the oven while I added more broth to the rice and cooked for another 10-15 minutes because the rice was still crunchy. I will try to make again, because I really liked the flavor, but with some alterations.
