If you're making the Lime Sugar Cookies (and you should!), you don't need nearly the amount of sugar this recipe calls for - I just use 3/4 c. sugar and 1-1/2 limes. The microplane is perfect for this, just like the previous poster said.

I haven't made it yet but I would suggest using a microplaner to "zest" the lime, they work remarkably well (beware your fingers)! Then throw the zest into a food processor/blender with the sugar.

Very hard to peel the lime rind off without any pith. I would use a knife instead of a potato pealer. This sugar is great with the cookies! It is also great to dip strawberries in!
