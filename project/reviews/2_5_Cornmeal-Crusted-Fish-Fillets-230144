This was very good, I added some spices of my own. My wife liked it very much. For those who could not keep the cornmeal on while cooking, I first coated the fish in baking powder, then egg, then cornmeal. Worked fine. I used olive oil to fry.

This was just fine. Not bad, but not great. I added extra paprika and red pepper, and I salted and peppered the fish right before cooking, but I had a hard time keeping the batter on the fish while it was cooking, and when it came out, the cornmeal thing didn't really seem worth it. I prefer floured whitefish to this cornmeal thing, but I think I'll borrow some of the spices into my recipe for sole.

this came out perfectly for fish tacos! added some freshly ground, toasted cumin seeds, spicy hungarian paprika, freshly ground coriander. used talapia fillets that were 1/2 to one inch thick. they may not have stood up on their own, but were excellent with salsa etc in tacos. i would add salt to the mix next time.

Very bland, easy enough, just no flavor to speak of.

This recipe was really easy and really delicious! I enjoyed the crunchy-ness of using the cornmeal instead of just flower. I added garlic and some other spices to the batter, which was helpful, i think. I used Catfish, and it turned out excellent, although i did have trouble keeping the corn meal mixture on the fish while cooking.

This is a great alternative to battered & deep fried fish. The paprika and pepper flakes should not be left out ... they give this recipe some depth and interest. This isn't a "WOW!" recipe, but is tasty and health-concious.

I agree with the Connecticut review. Not much taste, dry crust. Would not recommend it, would not make it again.

Did not care much for this recipe...not a lot of flavor, and definitely nothing special. I'd recommend making another dish if you want to impress someone with something

I make this w/o the egg, and it is a family favorite!

I did use the entire egg rather than just the yolk, but this is a light, easy, very tasty way to prepare any type of fish fillet.
