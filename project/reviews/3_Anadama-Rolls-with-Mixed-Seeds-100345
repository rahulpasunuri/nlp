I've been making these rolls for Thanksgiving for a few years now and they are the best. I always make them a few weeks ahead of time and freeze them and they come out perfectly. They always get rave reviews and my guests are always amazed that they are homemade and not store bought! Love these rolls!

I thought the molasses flavor was too mild. Next time I make it I will use a stronger molasses.

These rolls were very sweet right out of the oven, but the ones we froze for a couple of days later were just perfect. The one thing about this recipe is that the end of the second paragraph is a little ambiguous -- I put the yeast and water into the milk mixture after the yeast dissolved and that seemed to work okay. I also used skim milk and cake flour and they tasted fine.

Okay, so I DID use skim milk, and the rolls were still great ... next time I would cut the molasses in half - it was a bit too sweet.
