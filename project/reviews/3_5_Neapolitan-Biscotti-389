I love this recipe, but have substituted hazelnuts for the almonds. I roast the hazelnuts for a few minutes in a skillet and remove as much "skin" as possible. I find that cooking the biscotti for 35 minutes at 350 seems better. These make great holiday gifts.

I love this recipe. During the Christmas Season, my family always makes an old Italian recipe called Struffoli, that has similar ingredients and flavor, but is very difficult to make. Having this Biscotti recipe allows our family to enjoy the flavor combinations without all of the hard work.

With all the great reviews I thought this would be a winner. But I was soo disappointed. Although it tasted good, I did not like the texture, they were WAY too flat. I followed the recipe to the letter but my biscottis came out flat!! Yuck.

Very good combo for biscotti, and a nice variation with the honey and cinnamon while still remaining simple. I don't know why a previous reviewer found the orange flavor overpowering, because I found it too subtle and barely noticable. I would consider adding more orange peel or even orange oil next time. I dipped some in dark chocolate with good results.

Happy 10th anniversary, Neopolitan Biscotti! I have been making this biscotti for 10 years and absolutely love it, as does everyone I've made it for. It has become a staple of the annual Christmas cookie trays (I can't even THINK of not including it). This recipe is ammendable to modifications which have included: 1) using 1/2 the amount of almonds and 1 tsp almond extract; 2) add 1 cup dried cranberries; and 3) when doubling the recipe, use 1/2 the amount of oil and the other half orange juice. I also add a little nutmeg and allspice (1/2 tsp ea.) The baking times given were spot on. This is the best biscotti recipe ever. Thanks Bon Appetit! Keep up the good work.

This was an excellent choice of ingredients for biscotti. The recipe was very easy to make and turned out very well. However, the orange was a bit overpowering and may it may be better to use 1/2 tsp. instead of 1 tsp. orange peel. Alternatively it may be better to use 1/2 tsp. lemon zest and 1/2 tsp. orange peel. Nevertheless, the texture and flavor of these biscotti is excellent!

I wouldn't say these were the best biscotti I ever tasted, but I did like them and so did those I served. I added an extra 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon because it did seemed to ask for enough. It was a little crumbly, but that biscotti. Very tasty!

I have made this recipe many times and have had many compiments. Some people say it tastes better than any they have ever had before!

These biscotti were delicious, "true" biscotti - hard & made for dunking though dunking is not necessary. I found them very easy to make, a "keeper"

These are good biscotti if you are looking for a recipe without butter. Everyone was right about the cooking time. I shortened it and still found that they were overdone. I didn't like the texture of the batter, found it too dry and crumbly; however this did not negatively impact the final product. I prefer other biscotti recipes.

One of my favorite cookie recipes, and a lovely & sophisticated snack with tea or coffee. Definitely shorten the first cooking time.

Wonderfully crunchy, not too sweet. We found that toasting the almonds first gives them a nuttier, fuller flavor.

As the description states, this is a full flavored biscotti and a nice, unusual cookie when you are looking for something light and non chocolate. Agree with previous reviewer that shaving 10 mins off baking time does improve things.

Of all biscotti recepies, this one is the very best. It cuts the best and has a great flavor. The only thing I wouldn't do is leave it in the oven for so long, it turns a little too brown. Just take off ten minutes or so and see if it fits your liking, you can always bake it longer.

This biscotti is very tasty and fills the house with a wonderful aroma when it is cooking. It lasts for weeks and can be frozen easily. You can even dip part of it in chocolate and it is outstanding.

I have made this one many times with success. The only change I make is to melt some chocolate chips and spred them on one cut side of the finished cookies. Whenever I make them, they don't last long. I've shared this recipe with my Italian mother-in law who now keeps a constant supplie of them in her kitchen for grandchildren and friends.

I've made this recipe several times. It is quick and easy to make. The combination of cinnamon, orange zest, almond with a hint of honey was superb. Everyone loves them and I am asked to make them over and over again.

i dont know where i went wrong... my dough turned out to be too sticky. i may have worked in more flour to make handling easier leaving the biscotti rather cakish in texture. the aroma/flavour was delightful. but im afraid to try and make it again. i prefer a lighter biscotti.

Delicious and easy. Only, it would be better to specify whether the almonds should have the skins on.

This is absolutely the best biscotti I've ever tasted. It has a wonderful deep nutty flavor that perfectly compliments the honey, spices and orange peel. It emphasizes texture and flavor over sweetness, which is a better companion to good coffee.
