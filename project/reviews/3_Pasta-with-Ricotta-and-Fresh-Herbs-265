I used whole ricotta. Yum.

Made it again, this time with spinach and sliced chicken sausage and it was delicious! Even those who were skeptical the first time were won over big time.

I thought this was pretty good. I added some spinach and made sure it was well seasoned with salt and pepper. Plan to make again.

This isn't a bad recipe, but it is very bland. I might use this recipe as a base for something more flavourful, but probably won't make it again as written

I had this last night. I used 150z fat free ricotta and 1c fresh grated Romano cheese.I added 1-1/2lbs fresh blanched chopped spinach and 1 can rinsed black beans to the recipe. Everyone loved it

Yum! And easy! I used whole ricotta and reduced fat milk.

give a pasta a chance! it was great, i would definitely make it again. I did use more garlic and shallots instead of onions. I used ricotta from the Italian grocery store and had a 1 1/4Lb and so I used a 1Lb in sauce and used extra to sprinkle over finished pasta. It was great to use the herbs from the garden. A very fresh but comforting meal.

It was so bland that by the time that you add enough ingredients...it's no longer the same recipe!

I took some of the advice offered by other reviewers: I used a shallot instead of onion, whole milk ricotta instead of low fat, and added 3 slices of bacon while I sauteed the shallot and garlic. A little salt and pepper flavored the dish pretty nicely. I would definitely make it again; it was very easy to make and the leftovers were good.

This is a classical Sicilian dish. The blandness is due to the low fat riccota cheese. My grandmother used to make this with full-fat riccota, but I use part-skim. Also, instead of the milk, she would add water that is used to boil the pasta. Since the water is salted, it adds more flavor than skim milk.

I love a good challenge. Reading the prior reviews, I wanted to find the "missing" ingredient. After taste-testing the sauce, I went for the nutmeg. Why? The sauce tasted like a basic Bechamel and nutmeg is a great addition. If I were me, and I am, I would make this again but also substitute the sweeter shallot (minced) for the onion, and also add two minced carrots to the saute (again, for sweetness). For a heartier version, I would also add ~1lb of ground white meat (pork, veal, or turkey) to the saute.

It was definitely a more bland recipe. I added more garlic (mmmmm) and seasoned with fresh ground pepper at serving time. I think more basil and salt, with maybe some grilled chicken cut in strips would fill the void in this recipe.

It was okay. I added 1 cup of spinach, along with the herbs. Next time I may try adding a little bit of crisp bacon - more salt helped, but it still felt like it needed a little something.

to give this rather bland recipe some zip, try substituting feta cheese for the riccota

A good, light, summer recipe for a hot and humid night. A little bland, but using good parmesan and plenty of salt helps.

This recipe was a bit disappointing. It lacks a certain something to give it kick.
