Although I'm not a vegatarian, I made this recipe for company.It turned out fantastic! After reading all the reviews here's what I did. I doubled the spices and added 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I also added approx. 1/4 cup feta cheese in between the layers. That's it. I didn't find it bland, there was a lot of flavour. I think adding too much hot or strong spice might take away from how a moussaka is supposed to taste.

I am giving this recipe a low mark because the flavor was quite bland. I believe it could be improved by using a sharper cheese in the sauce such as Romano. The vegetable mixture didn't have a pleasing taste as well. I wonder if a different mix of vegetables could have helped-zucchini and potatoes instead of the celery and carrots? The recipe is very labor intensive and makes a huge casserole. I really wanted to like this dish, but I will continue searching for a better version.

Delicious. I did make a few changes. I didn't use all the oil. Instead, I sprayed the cookie sheet with canola oil and sprayed the eggplant. I added 1/2 cup uncooked bulgur wheat to the tomatoe sauce and doubled the cinnamon. For the bechamel, I used all skim milk. I liked to reduce the fat content of all recipes. My husband loved it and said it was worthy to have for guests.

I am giving this recipe a high mark, simply because it sounds like it will be delicious! Eggplant Parmesan is a staple in our house, especially now that we are vegetarians. Also, I want to share the trick that my mother taught me, for extracting the liquid from eggplant: slice, sprinkle both sides with salt. Then place on paper towels. Cover the slices with more paper towels, and then put a cast iron skillet on top to press, for about half ad hour. Then rinse and pat dry. Works like a charm!

I enjoyed this recipe a lot. There are lots of reviews so I will just chime in with a few areas of agreement with others. 1. I cut the bechamel in half and found it to be adequate but I could see how people who like a thicker topping might want more. 2. I took the advice to add some feta and wish I had added a bit more. 3. Definitely can cut the oil on the eggplant a bit. And now my big comment: I am not a big cook in general, but didn't find this overly labor intensive for a recipe. I used a food processor to more shred the carrots and celery and slice the onion. What did people feel made this such a high intensity recipe?

Rating: 4
Fabulous! My clients loved it! I subbed out the whole milk for 3/4 cup less of skim. I also used pecorino-romano instead of parm-regg for the sauce, but I still put parm-regg on top. Absolutely delicious, thanks!

Boring! I love vegie moussaka but the work involved in making this did not pay off! I use cooked potato with fresh dill (the way I always had it in Greece). There was too much bechamel. It needed a sharper cheese like a feta. I agree that baking the eggplant is just so much more healthy,but this recipe is not worth the effort...sob!

This was a success when served to my book group. I cut back on olive oil and butter and used 1% milk and it was still great (I can't help but adjust any recipe to be lower fat). No celery or parsley (didn't have and don't particularly like). Cinnamon flavor and aroma had the greatest appeal to my guests. Prepared, chopped or cooked over a few days to keep the labor time more manageable.

Made as written and it was divine!!!! I think I may be able to cut down on the eggplant prep time a little. My paper towels were not really that wet so next time I'll just slice and roast. Not sure how that topping is going to freeze. We'll see.

Will add this to my list of things to make when eggplants from the garden are plentiful. I doubled the spices as suggested and added nutmeg. I may try cubing the eggplant next time just because it makes for easier dishing out of the pan.

I absolutely hate eggplant, but I'm forcing myself to eat more vegetarian meals and decided to give this one a try. Super delicious! Husband thought it was lasagne with meat in it! I "accidentally" doubled the cinnamon but turned out this was a happy accident. Also, I rinsed the eggplant and patted them dry after letting them rest 30 minutes with the salt sprinkling. The only changes I made was to the bechamel sauce. I used cornstarch instead of flour (trying to eliminate gluten from my diet), 2% milk and completely omitted the egg yolks.

Amazing! I followed the recipe exactly and could not have been more pleased - served it last night at a dinner party to wonderful reviews. Yes, it was labor intensive with the steps involved in roasting the eggplant and essentially making 2 sauces but totally worth it. Make this dish!

Great flavor!. I made this for a Greek themed dinner party last night. I was a little hesitant becasue of comments of how much work was involved. I think the results were definately worth the effort and did not feel it was that much work. Raves for all the guest including one gentleman who does not eat/like veggies. I made only a few slight changes. I cubed the eggplant to cook faster. I used skimmed milk for the sauce and I cut it in half. Otherwise followed the recipe as written. It was great. So glad there are left overs for today!

This recipe would have been great, if only it said whilst cooking to rinse the aubergines off before cooking them, as some of us didn't know that! Ruined £35 worth of ingrediants. Kiiiiiinda sucks. Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/notes/Vegetable-Moussaka-102153#ixzz0rzM9SyqR

Make any modifications you like; however, I would highly recommend CUTTING the sauce in HALF, unless you want a heavy dish that drowns the wonderful vegetables!

A really great dish, vegetarian comfort food at its finest. Some additions (and a major subtraction) that were necessary to make this dish really shine include: 1. Use cooking spray instead of the copious amounts of oil suggested for preparing the eggplant. 2. Omit the carrots. 3. Be sure to remove the gills and stems from the mushrooms before adding to the sauce. 4. 1 package Quorn crumbles makes a nice addition, an option to be added with the mushrooms if desired. 5. Double the oregano and cinnamon. Add 1/4 to 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper and 1 tsp chile powder. Sweeten the tomato sauce to taste with a little agave nectar (1T) or sugar to round out the flavors. 6. 3 egg yolks in the bechamel using whole wheat flour (or WW pastry flour) is plenty. I also added crumbled feta to the layers, which is a nice option, and used dried parsley instead of fresh because that's what I had on hand. This recipe makes a huge casserole that provides wonderful leftovers or a crowd pleasing, rich and substantial dish that can be made a day ahead. I will definitely save this recipe for future use...it's a keeper! OPA!

Fabulously yummy! I made this for an international dinner with a Greek theme, and it was the hit of the evening. The only change I made was to use crimini (baby bella) mushrooms instead of the portabella, and it was scrumtious as written, although I'm sure adding nutmeg to the bechamel would be lovely. A bit time consuming, but definitely worth the effort!

This dish was just terrific. Had a meat and potato crowd that is anti veggie food, and they all were asking for seconds. Don't forget the nutmeg!

This was delicious. The consistency was great, the portobellos added just the right flavor, and the sauce on top was the right amount. I added 1/4 c of red wine and heaping tsps or 1/2 tsps of the spices; I also added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg from the other reviews. Very tasty, completely finished at dinner!

My daughter said she wanted to eat healthier, and with the economy the way it is, we've gone meatless a few times a week. Also, I've craving eggplant, so I thought I'd give this recipe a try, and am I glad I did! I followed the recipe with the follow exceptions: I do not like carrots or celery except for making stock and then I strain and toss. So I used chopped frozen spinach and marinated artichoke hearts instead. For the sauce, I used 2% milk, although, when I make it again (and I will!), I'm going to use feta cheese to cut the carbs and fat. Also, I'll cut the eggplant thicker and use more onion, if only to bulk it up a bit. I made a half recipe, and there is just an itty bitty square left the next day. My daughter, who prefers fast food, loved it. I call it Greek lasanga. Also, a Greek friend of mine, who used to run a Greek restaurant asked for the recipe. Now if that isn't an endorsement, I don't know what is!

My bf was flipping through some old cookbooks and excitedly said, "moussaka, mmmm!" Well, I don't read french and had to look it up here, on Epi. I did not make any subsitutions for the ingredients. Since a few of the previous reviewers said their moussaka turned out runny, I baked my eggplant and simmered the tomato sauce 15 and 10 min longer than stated, respectively. The amount of bechemel sauce -looked- like it would be too much, but I thought it was the perfect amount on the final product. I found the process to be quite similar to making a lasagna (in case you're wondering about the effort it will take since others thought it wasn't worth it.) My moussaka-loving bf and two dinner guests thought this dish was delish! Served with crusty bread and sausage. I will probably add ground meat to the tomato sauce next time.

Rating: 4
Made this for dinner, along with couscous, an Italian Greek salad I found on Epicurious, and Baklava (2004 Gourmet version) for a weekend dinner with friends. I probably should have left the moussaka in the oven for slightly longer to achieve a firmer Bechemel on top, but it tasted great. I did add some red wine vinegar, hot sauce, and upped the cinnamon in the tomato sauce, as another reviewer did. It made the right proportion of each layer (a little too much eggplant, but my dish was slightly smaller than 13x9) and it cut and served nicely.

I made this dish for Christmas dinner for the first time. i'd never had moussaka before but one of my vegetarian friends reccommended it. took a while to prepare but it was well worth it. so delicious! everyone at dinner loved it and i have to say i was impressed with myself! :D

I have made this dish many times - my husband and even my kids love it (so do I!). Yes, it is time consuming and I have been known to make it in steps (prepare the tomato sauce in advance and freeze it, for example). To save time I also use crushed tomatoes and leave out the carrots. The dish is otherwise perfect - I have never had problems with it being watery or having too much or too little bechamel sauce. Highly recommended.

A great dish! You won't miss the meat, the portabello mushrooms make a delicious subsitution. Watch how much salt you add to the tomato and milk sauces; they may taste like they need it, but remember that even though you wipe off the eggplant they still will keep some of the salt.

I really wanted to love this dish. I absolutely love all of the ingredients. My husband and mother-in-law thought it was really good, but for the amount of work and the ingredients list, I was expecting stellar. I thouht it was good, but just not GREAT. It definitely lacked something.

I am a very inexperienced cook, but this turned out perfect (and looked just like the picture). The only change I made was to add an extra 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon (and I think I'd add even more next time - it's part of what makes the dish so fabulous!). I might add more mushrooms too, or cut them larger. I didn't find it made too much of a mess, but there was also ample time to clean up as I went. Although I eat meat, I'm married to a vegetarian, and I didn't miss the meat in the least! I'll definitely make this again (it took about 2 hours, and I'm a very cautious cook). Oh, I found the bechamel sauce to be the perfect amount (there's supposed to be lots!).

This recipe is fantastic. My husband and I share an equal distaste for eggplant, growing up in households where our mothers liked to slice it and fry it - blecchh!! This recipe makes the eggplant into something divine. Yes, it is a lot of work, and it definitely clutters the kitchen, but it is well worth it, and even more delicious the following day.

I thought this was pretty good, and my company all seemed to really enjoy it too. I found the topping to be not as firm as I had expected. Maybe too runny? It didn't look at all like the photo. Also, the moussaka had a lot of liquid in it. I kept the recipe almost the same with the exception of adding a little nutmeg and some red wine to my tomato sauce. I will make it again.

I thought this was awesome! I did add a few things (pumpkin and zucchini) and instead of can tomatoes I just added some chopped tomatoes and then simmered the vegetables till they were all tender and the mixture quite thick. The cinnamon and oregano are a must. Loved it!

I thought this was an excellent recipe. I agree that only half (if that) of the bechamel need be used. Feta is a nice touch. If I prepare this dish again I woul add pine nuts and perhaps some baked garlic cloves... maybe even some spinach, arugula, or chard!

fantastic recipe! we made only about half of the bechamel which was perfect. being a Greek dish I felt it needed feta, so we sliced/crumbled thin pieces for the layers - one on top of the tomato veggie filling and one on the very top, on top of the bechamel. it brown perfectly and the saltiness compliments the other flavors. Might try making one with ground lamb, but this is extremely filling and delicious. Now to find a good chocolate cake recipe...

I suppose there was a lot of prep work, but it is well worth it. We absolutely loved this dish-e and my husband. Added raw spinach to the dish too. But, the lamb sounds like it would be good too. Have to try it that way. It is a one dish meal that is delicious!

My wife makes this when ever I nag her about how long its been since she made this dish. I do alot of the prep work and she does the cooking. The only changes that we have made to the basic recipe is that she adds a # of ground lamb and cuts back on the bechamel sauce by 1/3 or more. The first time she made it she followed the recipe, but added the lamb. It was soupy and to rich. My parents keep hinting that its time that she makes it again and I agree

This dish is ALOT of work, and yes my kitchen looked like a disaster area as well. But, it is truly worth the effort.

Rave reviews, and several calls over the next couple of weeks for the recipe.

I thought this was wonderful. My partner is a devoute meat eater and even he really liked it. While I'm sure you could modify this recipe, I see no reason to do so. Also, I really didn't find it to be alot of work. It was an enjoyable dish to create and even more enjoyable to devour!

I've made this recipie a few times and it's great! It is definatly worth going to the trouble of roasting the eggplant first, that's what makes the difference between a regular dish and something divine. If you don't have eggplant, use zucchini instead. A word of warning though, the eggplant absorbs a lot of the salt, so go easy on the salt for the rest of the dish. Last time I made it, I got creative and added some spinach to the mushroom mixture and used feta instead of parmesan, and it was great. This one is definatly staying in my collection!!

So I doubled this recipe because I had friends coming over that day and had to bring something Greek to the next day's potluck where they're vegetarians. It took me two hours to prepare (including cleaning up my kitchen which looked like it was hit by a tornado, not including baking time). The result was delicious but I'm not sure it's worth all that work--everybody loved it and I didn't tell them that I slaved for two hours making it. Anyway, I peeled the eggplant and sliced it thinner (1/4 in.) and broiled it on both sides. In the veggies mixture I also added vegetarian crumbles for a more meaty taste. I added a lot more garlic, some cumin, and marjoram to make it more tasty. In the end, I didn't have enough eggplant for a top layer, but I covered everything with the bechamelle and it looked great!

This was delicious! I must say that I never, ever salt, dry, wash, and pat dry my eggplant. It's ridiculously fussy and it makes no difference besides the final product being just a little bit more watery. It tastes just as good. I know from experience because I've made eggplant curry and eggplant parmesan both prepping and not prepping the eggplant. No difference in taste. Promise!

I have not made this recipe, but I do have an utterly fabulous recipe for Veggie Moussaka that sounds like it might be a little bit less work (and less fat!): Preheat oven to 350 deg. Slice an eggplant, sprinkle some salt over the slices, and place the slices in a colander with a weight on top. Let the eggplant sit for about 1/2 an hour, and afterwards fry them in a little bit of olive oil & arrange them evenly across the bottom of a casserole dish. Meanwhile, take a can of green lentils and a can of garbanzos, toss them in a pot with some veggie broth and a bay leaf and simmer for about 15 - 20 minutes. Next, saute a couple of shallots and cloves of garlic for about 5 minutes. Add the lentil/garbanzo mixture (bay leaf removed), a can of diced tomatoes, two tablespoons of tomato paste, and two teaspoons herbes de Provence (dried). Season mixtrue with salt and pepper to taste, and spread over eggplant. Beat 1 cup yogurt, 3 eggs, and a little salt together and spread evenly over dish. Sprinkle with cheddar cheese and bake for about 45 minutes. YUMMY!! PS - easily modified for vegans - tastes great without yogurt/eggs/cheese.

We love this recipe. All, or parts, can be made up a day in advance also, so it needn't be so labor intensive. I have made it 3 times, to rave reviews. Only problem is that it makes us both "gassy".

I have to agree with the cook from Salt Lake City - I just wasn't impressed. In fact, we ended up throwing out two-thirds of it. I was really surprised too, because I love all the ingredients and had high expectations. The sauce just overpowers the eggplant mixture, and my husband thought it was just generally too "mushy" in texture. There are probably some modifications that could be made to make it a bit more palatable, but given that the dish requires an absurd amount of work, I'm sure I wouldn't bother.

I too had problems with the bechamel sauce: it came out rather runny and unappetizing, further cooking did not solve the problem. Maybe it's just me. The rest of the dish came out good, although I still prefer the meat variety of moussaka. I wasn't thrilled with the leftovers either.

gosh, i feel bad, but i just didn't seem to like this dish as much as most of the reviewers. don't get me wrong, it's OK, but i probably won't make it again. one suggestion: wait more than the recommended time from the oven to the serving table. if you cut into it too soon, it's liquid-y and falls apart. i liked the left-overs better.

Excellent! Afraid that it would be too bland for me, I added a teaspoon of cumin with the oil for frying the onions and sprinkled some garam masala on the ingredients as they were cooking on the stove. WOW! I also cubed the eggplant (after peeling it) and baked these in the oven. The first time I tried it using eggplant rings as specified in the recipe and I found it too time consuming. Cubing imparted the same taste w/less effort. Also, the peel on the eggplant did not have a good mouth feel so I removed it the second time. EVERYBODY I served this to--my 5 year old daughter, my sisters, my parents, my meat-loving husband (he took three helpings) loved this. It is also a nice looking dish which would be impressive a a casual dinner party.

I don't think you'll ever find a better non-meat moussaka adaptation than this... rich and hearty. The white sauce is superb (four forks!), especially with a lot of Parmesan. I would reduce the number of eggs to 3 because the sauce had a very custard like consistency. Oven temperature seemed quite high, so I reduced it to 350 and baked for 30 minutes and it was already browning. I also increased the cinnamon to over 1 tsp. Next time, I I'll used a can of whole tomatoes (sauce not so thick), and maybe add zuchini. It's worth the 1 hour prep. time. Enjoy!

Very delicious. I was concerned that this would be very rich based on the ingredients in the bechamel. However the comments from our dinner guests was how light and flavorful it was.
