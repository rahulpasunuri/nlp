Great way to make the swiss chard my neighbor gives me! You need a TON of swiss chard to make a little because it reduces so much, but it is very good!

Recipe was great. My wife actually ate all of hers and she can be quite picky with her food. I will definitely save this one.

I lived in Italy for four years and am married to an Italian. Americans tend to like their vegetables lightly cooked or 'crunchy'. That is not the case in Italy. Vegetables are cooked until very soft, this includes greens, string beans, zucchini, peas, you name it! They are absolutely delicious cooked this way,especially when dressed liberally with great olive oil! Maybe if Americans cooked their vegetables like Italians we'd be eating more of them and so would our children!

Very good, with some severe cooking time modifications, because I like my swiss chard quite al dente, not mushy. I kept it in the first pot just until it began to wilt, then transferred it to the second pan until it was just how I like it. Used a pinch of red pepper flakes and salt and pepper. Very tasty, simple, and quick.

I purchased fresh swiss chard during the summer from the Farmer's Market in CA and it took approximately 10 minutes to be fully cooked. The stems do become somewhat "grey", though I would describe them as translucent. This is key. Italians may like their pasta al dente, but they do like their vegetables fully, not over-cooked. Also, swiss chard is chalky and bitter when undercooked, but sweet and tender when properly done.

I think 25 minutes of cooking time "until chard is gray" + another 20 minutes after that is better labeled "British-style" Swiss Chard. I cooked it for about 7 minutes, then added it to the golden garlic for a minute or so. I used about half the EVOO requested by the recipe. Finally, there's nothing wrong with the green portion of the garlic. It is just a bit milder and I'm guessing this recipe asks for it to be cut out for aesthetic reasons alone.

I too used less cooking time on this dish for the same reason the previous reviewer stated and less olive oil. It turned out to be a fabulous side dish.

I made this without cooking for so long! I like some texture left to my greens and it turned out perfect (to me at least). This is also the same way I cook my beet tops and spinach.

We loved this recipe for swiss chard. Would use a little less olive oil next time, and didn't need to steam the chard for more than 20 minutes.

Very good. I like the ideal of cooking the chard a little longer than normal. Seem to give it a slightly softer texture. This is a recipe I will share with other chard lovers.

The pepper flakes and olive oil are a good idea, but who cooks swiss chard for 45 minutes?

This is exactly the way my mother makes swiss chard. A very delicious and homey recipe. I recomend it to everyone.
