This sauce came out OK, especially for a "simple" mole recipe, but I wanted more complexity. The flavors of the nuts (especially peanuts) stood out over all the other flavors. I will try a different recipe next time.

I couldn't find dried ancho chiles so I used two rounded tablespoons of ancho chile powder and it came out great--and required no prep time. Could have used more heat, though, if you're into that.

I made this to use in tamale filling and loved it. Very easy, very delicious, and makes enough for a crowd.

For a simple mole, it was tasty, but because of the few ingredients it lacked depth of flavor. I added some cinnamon and extra raisins. Poached a chicken (cut up) and then poured the prepared mole over the chicken and braised at 300 degrees for 35 minutes. I then strained out the braising liquid and skimmed and reduced the sauce, resulting in a more complex mole.

This is simple, delicious mole.

I modified this recipe because it didn't have much complexity. To the recipe listed I added 3T Ancho Chili Powder (available at specialty grocery stores) and 1 t dried red pepper to add a little underlying heat. It was probably dried poblano peppers. I wouldn't use cayenne as this would only had heat and no complexity. Much better after the additions. It also makes way more than you would need to use for any given recipe! I froze some and gave some away.
