Definitely a Do Again. I did make a few modifications to give the chutney some depth. Along with the onion, I used some minced shallot. Also added about 1/3 tsp. dried thyme. For the preserves, I used the Polaner All Fruit, which does not have chunks in it, and TJ's modestly aged balsamic. We'd just picked luscious fresh tart cherries, and these were delicious as the fruit.

Delicious. I made using bone-in rib chops and substituted frozen cherries and some dried cherries. Served with mashed red skin potatoes and sauteed spinach.

Have made this 3 times in the last 4- 5 weeks. Used pie cherries from our own tree. Has been well liked each time. Not having cherry preserves on hand I substituted some simple syrup and added a few extra cherries. Hey what are the big ingredients in cherry preserves anyway? Cherries and sugar. At the end of cooking time I used just a hint of water and cornstarch to help thicken the sauce, placed a small portion of the sauce in a blender to puree, then added back to the sauce in the pan. Cooked the tenderlions on the gas grill each time until medium well (about 145-150). Disappears like crazy. You bet we'll have this again.

I made this exactly as written, and while it was tasty, it was hardly outstanding. If I do this again, I'll puree the glaze in a mini food processor before brushing it on the meat. That's because the pieces of cherries from the preserves dropped straight into the fire. That said, the glaze on the finished product was delicious and had a nice chewy texture to it. As for the cherry chutney, I thought it had a bit too much cayenne, and I'd cut it back a bit. Also, the chutney never did thicken; it was more like a sauce.

I was disappointed with this recipe, which came out much too sweet despite the peppery taste of the allspice. Also, the method of cooking the tenderloin, over medium high heat and then low heat, didn't give very good results. I get much more flavorful meat by cooking the tenderloin on the grill over medium-high high heat for the entire cooking process. In any case, if I am in the mood again for a pork tenderloin with a fruity sauce, I will make Pork Tenderloins with Balsamic Cranberry Sauce, a truly outstanding recipe found on this site.

This dish is SUPER easy (a beginniner cook should have no problem), but is so elegant and delicious, it can be served for a "special" occasion, or just for a quick, easy evening meal. I used Trader Joe's frozen Bing cherries, since fresh were not in season, and it was every bit as delicious as I'm sure it would have been with fresh. If you don't have a Trader Joe's near you, I'm sure you can use any brand of frozen cherries - just make sure they're not sweetened since the preserves will give you all the sweet you need! OUTSTANDING RECIPE!

Made this twice now. It is just spectacular. I marinated the pork in a little extra balsamic with the chutney. I made sure not to overcook the pork and let is finish cooking in its own heat. Guests loved it.

I liked the simple elegance of this dish. Though it was weeknight-easy, it could be served at a dinner party. I was unable to find cherry preserves in supermarkets, and so went to a local specialty foods store where I found some cherry spread. I also found cherry jam later on at a farmer's market. I write a blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins, and this is one of the recipes I featured on it.

I bought a whole pork tenderloin and had the butcher cut a very large roast from it for this recipe to serve 8. And,after browning on the grill, put slices of bacon on top to keep it moist. SOOOOO good! We dont like our pork cooked to death so turned grill off when internal temp was around 120. Just kept the lid down for a while and it was perfect inside. Made the chutney several days ahead-gotta love that time saver! Served a Malbec with this. Raves all around!

Tried this recipe with girlfriends last week and it was a hit! Followed the recipe exactly and the pork could not have been better- the meat ended up very tender and the cherries were the perfect accompaniment. I'm making this tomorrow night for my boyfriend and expect to get rave reviews again!

This is one of my absolute favorite recipes. Since we have such abundant cherry harvest up here in the Pacific Northwest--and since I love this recipe so much--I make extra chutney and can it to be used during the winter.

I must recommend this recipe. Like other reviewers, I added rosemary and I think it was a good addition. I served with french bread and grilled aparagus seasoned with salt, pepper, cayenne and allspice. The chutney is so good that I was glad to have the bread to sop up all the left over juice!

This is a wonderful dish!. We prefer spicer toods so I doubled the cayenne. Delicous!

I added a teaspoon of cumin to the chutney for a more Indian flavor and served it with oven roasted potatoes and asparagas. Really a fine combination. This is a good rescue for cherries that have gotten a bit soft. They have a rich flavor.

Really delicious. My husband used soaked wood chips along with the charcoal to grill and smoke the meat - the smoked flavor really was a nice addition. Company worthy.

This recipe was divine. Guests went back for thirds! Glad I read the previous comments and added the fresh rosemary to the chutney. Served with sweet corn pudding, also recommended in comments-recipe found on this website. Excellent accompaniment! For dessert-fresh mint chocolate chip ice cream.

I wasn't too thrilled with this. The chutney really needed something else to it, maybe some fresh chopped rosemary? It also needed a lot of salt. There are better pork tenderloin recipes for the grill out there and a better way to use fresh cherries as well.

I thought this was fantastic. We went light with the glaze on the meat knowing the chutney was going to be sweet enough. The combination of pork and cherries is outstanding.

I didn't have onions, allspice or cherry preserves and had rushed home after a long day of work. I used shallots, a jar of traditional chutney, ginger and four cardamom pods. Everyone loved it, kids and cherry-hating husband especially. It was easy, and everyone got involved in cooking: my kids pitted the cherries, husband grilled the pork and I prepared the cherry chutney. I served it with a leftover curried wild rice salad with currants and Coppola Bianco mixed white.

This recipe is awesome! I sprinkled the pork with garlic powder and cracked pepper and cooked it to 150 degrees, removed it from the grill and covered it for 10 minutes, then sliced and served it. It was perfect! I had to boil the sauce longer than the recipe said to thicken it, but it turned out great. Everyone loved this, I will make it again!

I'm making this recipe for the third time in three weeks... by request. Well worth the effort, especially since the chutney can be made in advance -- perfect for dinner parties. The allspice definitely makes it special, good quality balsamic vinegar is a plus, and I took a previous reviewer's suggestion and added fresh rosemary to the chutney. One previous trip to the store netted no fresh cherries, so I substituted dried apricots (which I reconstituted) and apricot preserves... delicious, too! I'm thinking any compatible fruit/preserve combination, fresh, frozen, or dried, could make for interesting chutney for this and other meats, like duck and chicken.

even with the cherry chutney and marinade, the pork was bland. I made the recipe using very good cherry perserves and fresh cherries, it lacked the rich flavor I expected. Cooking the pork to 145 is not a good idea, cook it to at least 160.

My husband did the actual grilling, he wanted more of the glaze. We couldn't find a tenderloin so we asked the butcher at the meat market to suggest something. He picked out a nice lean roast (I can't remember what cut it was but next time we will cut it in half because it took almost 3 hours to cook). My 2 year old had been falling asleep waiting for dinner but woke up fully alert when he tasted the chutney. All three of us loved it. I will probably play with the recipe as a previous cook mentioned, adding peaches and trying different meats. I'm still pretty new to all this, thanks for the comments and the recipe.

I made the recipe exactly, so as to be able to blame the magazine in case my wife and son didn't like it. It certainly was worth the effort as both took seconds. Note that in the first few minutes of browning on the grille, you must turn the meat very frequently, or the natural sugars in the cherry chutney will burn quickly. Be sure your grille is very well oiled for this. As for the rest, and as I used the gas grille, I did a convection job, placing the tenderloin on the side opposite the flame. I really enjoyed the chutney, and likely will experiment, combining cherries with apricots or peaches. I also added a few fingers of fresh rosemary, which marries well with the allspice. On the side I served a quick corn pudding with a package of thawed creamed corn, a big corn muffin crumbled, chopped scallions and fresh chopped basil --- which provided both veggie and starch against a salad and a fine Merlot. The real appeal here is the chutney, which, given the allspice, is reminiscent of the Scandinavian fruit sauces which enhance the flavor of reconstituted cod. You could even increase the allspice half again. Overally, a very enjoyable experience.

This was good, but I'm not sure it was worth the expense and trouble of fresh cherries. Since the cherries ended up mostly cooked in the "chutney", I'd say frozen cherries would have worked just as well, with much less effort.

This recipe was outstanding and worth the bit of work it takes to pit cherries. I used a high grade balsamic vinegar and a vidalia onion which gave the sauce a very rich taste. I think a sprig of fresh rosemary added to the sauce while reducing it would be a nice addition. I served a Cabernet/Shiraz which complimented the dish nicely.
