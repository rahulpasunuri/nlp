Always delicious and a family favorite. I use petit peas instead of sugar snaps.

This is a wonderful recipe that I have made several times. It is hearty, heart warming, crisp and fresh all at once -- a difficult combination to achieve in a beef stew. I used a can of chopped tomatoes instead of the 4 plum tomatoes, and added more beef broth, and it worked well.

This was thin for a stew, and although the sugar snap peas were good with the meat, the dish as a whole was kind of disgusting.

This was not an enjoyable dish at all. I followed the recipe exactly, and doubled the sauce as suggested by others. It was still gross.

Well, I thought it was good, since im only 11 and I am kind of picky the herbs were a little much for me but my parents loved it! I agree that it shouldn't simmer too long because you lose too much liquid! Would make it again!

Simple and delicious. Have made this several times.

This was such an easy receipe to make. I forgot to let the wine reduce but that didn't seem effect the flavor and I had to use pea pods as I couldn't find snap peas. I have an 8 year old who thinks Kraft Macaroni and Cheese is a culinary treat so when he ate this, I knew it passed the test.

Excellent consistency and flavor. I used a good Saint Emilion, which I think made the difference. I had no rosemary, sugar snap peas, or beef broth. I added green beans (great with the thyme), bay leaf, water for liquid, and potatoes. Sure wish I'd had a fresh baguette.

My husband loved this stew while I was on the fence as I tend to like spicier foods. Since it was quick to make, if I made the stew again I'd add some zip for myself. The sugar snaps were great.

Fantastic stew for a stew making novice and for everyone else. It was delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and it was great. I served it over mashed potatoes. I would simmer less next time as I lost most of the liquid following the time lines given in the recipe.

Very good. Easy dish to make. I might cut down on tomatoes next time, just to make it more to my taste, but everyone loved it. Also added a few yukon gold potatoes and increased other veggies. Agree that snap peas are a must... adds color, crunch and flavor.

I made this for my family tonight and everyone thought it was fantastic! The sugar snap peas are a must, they really make the dish. Go heavy on the fresh rosemary and thyme, the flavors are wonderful. I added 2 Yukon gold potatoes, cubed. Served over couscous. Best beef stew we've ever had!

I made this dish for my family at dinner one night it was delicious. Its a great balance between beef and vegetables. Not too much of each. I would definitely reccomend it!!!!!!!

Made some changes to suit picky children and what I had in the pantry. I added potatoes with the carrots and a bit of sugar earlier. Even considering the fact that I didn't add the herbs or the tomatoes, it came out wonderful and I will definitely make it again. Very thick and hearty for a lower fat dish.

I added potatoes, celery and also a little bit (2 TBSP) of flour to thicken it up a bit. It's a hearty, fairly healthy way to enjoy this comfort food.

With my substitutions this becomes my all-time favorite stew recipe that I lost the recipe for years ago. I replace the rosemary with dill (2 - 3 tsp dried) (I sometimes add basil too), added potatos and mushrooms with the carrots and added pearl onions at the last 15 minutes (and I didn't add the sugar snap peas).

I was not impressed with this recipe. I ddi add carrots and celery but I found that the flavor of the stew really did not taste good.

This is a very good recipe. I appreciate that it doesn't contain any butter or flour. I added cubed potatoes along with the carrots, which resulted in a hearty, well-balanced meal. I will definitely use this recipe again.

I love this stew! It tastes great, it makes the kitchen smell like rosemary, and it's not nearly as heavy as I remember my mother's beef stew being. I made it a few nights ago and my husband and I both wondered why we havent' made it more often.

Thought this stew was wonderful especially since it uses so little fat and absolutely no flour yet still manages to produce a rich broth. the vegetables where a nice change of pace from the usual stew ingredients. A very pleasant lowfat surprise and one the will be one of my regulars from now on.

A nice alternate to "mom's" beef stew. I would serve it next time with boiled new potatoes instead of noodles.

Had never made a stew with snap peas before and it prooved to be wonderful...definitely recommended.

This recipe was easy to make and very tasty. It was definitely better to use fresh herbs. Also, I cooked it for less time than the recipe said. It is important to watch the pot so it doesn't overcook.

This is a very good recipe and my family just loves it. It's one of my regular recipes I pull out in a pinch.

This stew was very easy to prepare, and my 11-year old picky eater daughter had 3 servings. It was her favorite stew. This one's a keeper.

This was a delicious recipe & I will definitely make it again! We used Merlot (from Italy), and served it over roasted red potatoes--YUMMMM!

Excellent stew! Not too heavy. I found the cooking times skewed a little on the long side, so I would keep an eye on your pot and adjust according to how you see the dish progressing. And don't worry about the beef toughening up, as long as its seared, it'll be fine. Mine turned out great. Excellent for summer or winter!

Wonderful stew for a cold day! Fresh thyme is so much better than dried. I cooked the stew an hour longer to really tenderize the beef. It's important to use a very flavorful beef stock - I added more undiluted.
