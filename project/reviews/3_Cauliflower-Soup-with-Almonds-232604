Wonderful soup. We liked it with and without the almonds. Flavors were great together. Found that it really made 6 servings rather than 4. Only changes I made were to double the leeks (just had two) and used 2% milk.

I really enjoyed this soup. I added an extra leek, 4 cloves of garlic, a TBS of Coriander, and equal parts half and half and lowfat milk. a very satisfying soup!

there's a way to simplify and at the same time enrich the flavor. cut down the aromatics to just onion and garlic, then try different nuts. tried one version w/walnuts and then one w/brazil nuts--totally different flavor! http://onehotdish.blogspot.com/2012/02/when-temperatures-drop-so-low-that.html

What a delicious recipe. I couldn't stop eating it. I didn't think the almonds made much a difference, but it was nice to have some protein in the dish. Definitely will make again.

Loved this recipe - and very easy. I used additional leeks (3) and a little less cauliflower because that's what I had and it turned out great. Also: I used veggie boullion instead of chicken, and I added a swig of sherry at the end (so good). Lastly, transferring to a blender sounded risky so I used my immersion blender and it turned out great. Don't leave out the almonds!

I really enjoyed this soup. However, I agree with the folks who said that you should add some onion, an extra leak and garlic. That made it perfect! It is a really nice and light, creamy soup.

This recipe was fantastic. Post- holidays it was a welcome, light change. It didn't taste low fat. I let the cauliflower simmer for much longer than it said - the flavors cooked in & were just delicious. You may be tempted but do NOT skip the roasted almonds - they made this dish.

Inspired by other reviews I made the following changes which added to the flavour: used 2 leeks instead of 1; added 1c chopped onion and 4 cloves garlic; increased coriander to 1tsp. I also significantly increased the pepper. Lastly added cayenne pepper which added some much needed punchiness to combat the bland cauliflower.

This is a great recipe, if you make some changes...2 leeks instead of one, at least 1 tsp of coriander. I used soy milk instead of regular milk, which added a subtle nutty taste to the soup, good complement for the almonds, and used home made vegetable broth..creamy, healthy ( vegetarian) delicious..

This was way easier to make than I thought it would be. I topped the soup with blue cheese crumbles instead of almonds just because that is what I had and it was a really nice compliment.

NOT delicious - very bland and I love the subtle earthiness of cauliflower. I will not be making this again.

This was delicious and well received by guests. I used cream instead of low-fat milk and homemade stock instead of canned broth. We enjoyed the flavor combination of coriander and cauliflower as an excellent first course for an Indian-inspired meal.

Skip this recipe and make the Cauliflower Soup with Truffle Oil instead. I had to add ground toasted cumin seed as a garnish to make this palatable at all. I've made so many other cauliflower soups which were good and didn't need cream. Just say no.

After reading the reviews about the dish being bland, I increased the leeks to 2, added a chopped onion and 3 cloves of garlic to the saute. I also replaced the milk with additional chicken broth. The soup was excellent. Some unique garnish and a beautiful serving dish would make it an excellent first course.

This recipe was disappointing--was very bland.

I gave this recipe four forks because of the simplicity of the ingredients and the recipe and the very tasty and satisfying outcome. (Healthy too!) I do like cauliflower, yet this was even better than I expected. The leeks imparted a sweet pungency that truly enhanced the dish. I followed the recipe exactly.

This recipe is a definite keeper. I used sweet onions instead of the leeks and home made soup stock. It was delicious!

I thought the leek would give this soup a nice flavor but unfortunately the end result was quite bland. Unless you absolutely love cauliflower, I'd recommend against making this soup.
