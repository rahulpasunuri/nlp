These could not be easier. put sauce and wings in container with lid and shake them around... evenly distributes the sauce. I made my own blue cheese dressing as well. 3/4 C sour cream, 1/3 C crumb-blue cheese, 1/3 C milk, 1/3 C mayo, 1 t salt, 1 Tbsp red wine vinegar. ENJOY!

Fantastic and easy to make! Used the recommendation to add spices to chicken before frying. I only had enough hot sauce to make half the sauce recipe. I used Frank's Red Hot with a dash or two of Tabasco This recipe made me happy because it was SO easy. And my family liked it too.

Who knew wings were so easy and delicious to make at home! I deep fried them for about 10 minutes, then tossed some with Frank's wing sauce and some with Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce for those that don't like the heat. I kept them warm in the oven, which also allowed the sauce to thicken and stick to the wings better. They were devowered...I wished I had made more!

Everytime I make these they receive great reviews. To add a slightly different spin, use chicken tenders, dip in egg, roll in panko bread crumbs and fry 10-12 minutes. Sauce to include Franks Original Hot Sauce, garlic and margarine. Serve with Marie's Blue Cheese Dressing. These freeze great, take from freezer and pop into oven, they retain their texture and crisp, pour sauce over. Always a hit!

better than most of the wings we get eating out! we used Frank's Louisiana hot sauce and it wasn't too hot either. for those a little cooking impaired, we found the butter mixed in much better when the sauce was a little cooler, but it still tasted good! would reccommend!

Who knew Buffalo Wings were so easy! I cut the recipe in half since there are just two of us. I used and electric Fondue pot to deep fry the wings. I served the wings with a Blue Cheese Dressing and a Waldorf Salad. The salad was a sweet counter point to the spicy wings. BTW, I wouldn't cut the recipe in half next time.

You can't worry about the nutrional value when you are making or eating wings! Go with the butter in the sauce; that's the correct recipe. No flour, no fancy ingredients, no honey barbeque sauce, etc. Just wings, Frank's Louisiana hot sauce, butter, and oil.

I made these last night for dinner and they were AWESOME! My husband loves wings & so do I, so it's so nice to know i have a great receipe to make at home now (soo inexpensive). I used frozen wings rinsed them, pat them dry, deepfried them for about 10-12min, covered each batch with the hot sauce & butter mixture, and then baked them at about 300 for 5 min, so they weren't so slimmy. They were perfect! Definitely recommend!

These are just like the wings I would get in Chicago from my favorite wing joint - I had no idea that they are so easy to make! I used the Louisiana brand (I had a 6 oz bottle, so ended up using a little less than the recipe calls for). A good Super Bowl party food.

What really makes me angry is how pretentious people can be on this website. Just because a recipe is simple and doesn't include "exotic" ingredients does not mean it is "not a recipe". I went to culinary arts school, and I met so many people who thought along those same lines. My best Bruschetta recipe has 5 ingredients-olive oil, garlic, basil, tomatoes and toasted bread. Does that mean it's not a recipe? Come on people, if something tastes good, like this recipe does, then admit it. Even if it's not as "sophisticated" as some recipes on this site.

Rating: 4
This is pretty much the recipe I've been making for years (found on the back of the Frank's bottle.) I add Tabasco to the sauce to spice it up more. Frying of course tastes better, but baking is so much easier and neater. Classic upstate NY wing flavor!

Rating: 4
Some things are not meant to be tampered with too much and buffalo wings definitely fall into this category. Great pure wing recipe - sprinkle with adobo seasoning before frying for better flavor. You get very different results depending on the brand of hot sauce you use - by far I've found Texas Pete's with just few dashed of tobasco to be the best.

Rating: 4
This is the most basic of wing recipes and great start. For those who slamed it, you clicked the link, read the recipe and took the time to reply... please. Couple things to remember. 1. Add butter to the "slightly" preheated sauce right before dumping it on the wings, otherwise the butter will seperate and wont stick to the wings. 2. Get oil to 375F, add wings and keep oil ~375F for 8 mins (thawed) 12 mins (frozen) cooking times. Cripy guaranteed. 3. This is a base sauce. Other additions you may like include (not all at once): american hot sauce, cheapest salsa picante you can find (Valentina rocks), smashed garlic cloves, viniger, italian seasoning, worchest, teriyaki, your fav BBQ sauce, celery seed, honey, Dijon, etc... My fav combo is 3:1 picante:butter, plus a touch of celery seed. Game ON!

We love hot wings!! I do NOT flour them. Just toss them with seasoning salt and black pepper then drop them in a deep fryer until extra crispy. For the sauce, I add loads of garlic and a dash of vinegar. We love these with ranch dressing instead of the normal blue cheese. Delicious!

Rating: 4
This was great. I modified slightly by soaking the wings in Buttermilk, rosemary, salt, pepper and some Franks overnight, then drained them, tossed in a mixture of flour, cornstarch, salt and pepper, I was debating deep frying, had just boought a waring-pro professional deep fryer and was going to take it back, for health reasons, but was actually incredibly amazed, I got back almost the same amount of oil I started with. I think having a better deep fryer made a big difference. I made the blue cheese dip as well and it was a big hit. It made a lot, we used about 1/3 the recipe tonight with dinner for 3 of us, will likely use the rest as a veggie dip for Christmas day. My son exclaimed that this was the taste he enjoys from his favourite wing place and that I have finally got all the components right, coating on the wings, Frank's hot sauce and the blue cheese dip!

Rating: 4
OK - I've made this recipe at least 6x. Its great. I've baked them, flour'd, soaked, fried them etc just to compare all the reviews. Truth is it's easier to order out but not by much! Skip the flour, don't salt prior (if using salted butter), don't soak. Just drop 'em into hot oil (I use a dutch oven) for about 12 minutes. Use the wooden spoon handle upside down in oil - look for bubbles to know when oil is hot enough. Recommend using the "wingettes" from market and you won't even need to cut them before frying. Drain on paper towels, roll 'em in the sauce and keep 'em warm (put them directly on the sheet pan in a little pool of sauce) in the oven (325 or so) until all batches are fried.

So far the best hot wing recipe I've tried. I took some reviewers' advice and dusted the wings with flour, salt and pepper and then fried them. I didn't want to deal with frying them up when guests were here, so I fried them early in the day until they were not quite done, doused them with half the Frank's sauce, refrigerated them in the sauce until I was ready to use them, and then baked them at 400 degrees for 20 minutes and poured the rest of the sauce on them. Turned out great.

Fantastic. As usual, it was tempting just order a batch of wings from the local wing joint...but went ahead and made these along with homemade blue cheese dressing, and they were incredible. Go with Franks for the sauce.

I used lightly salted butter and Frank's Hot Sauce. The wings were fantastic. I made them for my neighbors a few days later & they had to have the exact recipe!

Rating: 4
This recipe is excellent and easy. I do take it one step further by baking the wings after coating with the sauce but that's only because we don't like wet, messy wings, but to each his own. But to comment on the last review about not using butter and adding more vinegar, that makes no sense to me as all recipes for true Buffalo Wings calls for butter in the sauce. We also "Kick it up" by adding one very finely chopped habenero chile for the heat if you can stand it!

Rating: 3
Would definitely make this again, but without the butter in the sauce and with a little vinegar in the sauce. The butter makes it a bit too rich. 1 cup of hot sauce is great for people who can't have it too hot! The frying method is great and will be trying the baking method next time. It's a very very easy recipe!!

Rating: 0
I didn't rate this recipe b/c I use it as a base. I marinate my wings overnight in salt, pepper, garlic powder (it seems to taste better than fresh in this case), and a splash of vinegar. I sometimes even prepare the wings (remove tips and cut in sections) and freeze them, marinade and all. Then they're ready when I pull them from the freezer. Make sure you dry them pretty well before dropping them in the hot oil. They brown better and are crispier. Add some vinegar and garlic powder to your sauce and you've got it made.

The sauce is wonderful, I did not fry the wings, I mixed 1Tbsp paprika, 2tbsp cayenne,1 tbsp kosher salt for 36 wings(drummettes)- tossed the wings in that mixture and then baked at 425 for 55 minutes turning 2-3 times, then we just dipped the wings, but I have also tossed the wings in the sauce at that point.

I'll never go out for wings again! I've tried frying and baking, and I think I like baking the wings the best. Even my fiance liked the baked way better and he fries everything he eats!

I agree with others that you definately need Frank's hot sauce to get that authentic flavor. I also tried it with some chicken breast pieces baked in the oven, then coated with the butter/hot sauce mixture. Not exactly traditional, but at least the 'buffalo' flavor was still there and it was less fattening then deep fried wings.

I made this for a party, everyone who likes very spicy wings loved it, I made it with the Blue Cheese & Pecan dip features on this site. It dissapeared long before the party ended. Caution... this recipie is really hot!

Yes! This is it! Dont change a thing, and those who tell you they do not care for bleu cheese dressing, press them to try it on the wings. Maybe 90% of that type that i get to try it wont use another dressing with these wings (though most of them still say they wont use bleu cheese any other way). I have been making these for ten years, though i usually add a couple extra splashes of Louisiana Crystal, but the 2:1 ratio is standard.

Great basic recipe. I deep fried in a stockpot with a gallon of canola oil at 180 degrees, batches of 10 wings (so the temp didn't drop too much) for 10 minutes. Not as hot as I'd made them for myself, but definitely not boringly mild either. Perfect for a mixed crowd. Used unsalted butter. Everyone raved; you can't go wrong. Don't forget to make a nice stock with the chicken scraps!

Perfection!! Plain and simple.. I did follow the direction on Frank's (definatley Frank's!!!)bottle and cooked them for about 50 mins @ 425, smothered them with the sauce and put them in for another 10 mins. Amazing!! Husband raved-"best wings ever ever"!! Don't salt the wings before cooking if you're using salted butter-a bit too salty. Served withMarie's chunky bleu cheese-yummy!!!

Rating: 3
I toss the wings in seasoning salt and pepper before deep frying. To the hot sauce butter mixture I add at least a tablespoon of minced garlic. The jarred garlic is fine. Never have made homemade dressing so we use bottled ranch dressing to cut some of the heat for the kids. Good base recipe but try with the garlic, makes it so much better!

Rating: 4
Yes!! These are just like the ones I used to have in New York, and SO easy to make. Make sure the oil is hot enough so the wings don't get soggy when you fry. And the homemade dressing is a MUST- store bought doesn't compare.

Finally, I have a recipe where I can make great wings at home that are just as good, if not better, then bars and wing joints. We could never get good wings for out superbowl parties, but now we can! I dipped the wings in flour like previous reviewers for crispiness. My wings were on the large side so I fried them for about 20 minutes, turning once. I also used Franks hot sauce (awesome!) and next time I will use margarine and use less then 1/2 cup. I did think the sauce was a touch buttery. Game 6 of the '03 world series is tomorrow, GO YANKEES!!!!

I lived near Buf for 30 years and these are the real deal. I don't like Anchor Bar wings that well; in a cook off, BJ's in Fredonia, where we lived, beat out Achor Bar and these wings taste like theirs--But I use Frank's hot sauce as does everyone in Buf. You may reheat in the broiler but- Put sauce on just before serving or it will separate and look greasy. Sauce goes a long way.

Good wings for Superbowl Sunday. Make sure to use unsalted butter in the sauce... otherwise they come out too salty. I did a hybrid cooking method of those mentioned here... I fried the wings for approx 10 mins pre-party, then baked them at 400 deg. with some sauce to warm them up, then tossed them with remaining sauce at the end.

We throw in some garlic powder as well, just a touch. Adds depth of flavor. For the people in Germany, if you know someone with an APO or FPO box, the Anchor Bar sells the sauce by the gallon for $15.00 plus shipping (note: I haven't bought the sauce so this isn't an endorsement :-) Go to www.buffalowings.com.

This is the classic recipe for perfect chicken wings. However, I have been living in England for the past 5 years, and can't get Frank's hot sauce here. Whenever I come home for a visit, I buy a few gallon bottles of it! I actually dream of these wings, they're so good.

I've made these before (it's a pretty standard recipe)...but the other night I made them and they were the best I'd (and my friends) ever had! I used 4# wings, 1 c of the same sauce...but added some soy sauce. I fried the wings, coated them in sauce (save a little bit), then baked them on a metal cookie sheet at 400F. Wait until they are *almost* dry and a little carmelized on the bottom (about 20 minutes). Then toss in the remaining sauce.

Buffalo wings are my favorite dish! I love them so much, but alas, since I live in Germany, I can only get them at a TexMex restaurant in a town nearby.

My husband yearned for the kind of wings he'd had at his bachelor party, i.e., the perfect DRUNK FOOD! This is definitely it. I made them according to the recipe exactly.We only had one beer with them, but they were just as good sober! I'm just thinking whoever thought up this recipe must've been bombed too. Why else would you fry chicken, and then coat it with butter and hot sauce?

Rating: 2
The sauce is good, but I agree with some of the other reviewers that adding celery seed,garlic powder, etc., definately brings out a better taste. Margarine does work better than butter. To ensure crispiness, rinse the wings in cold water the day before, pat dry and leave in the fridge uncovered to dry the skin out. They turn out much better. I also use 100% canola oil (only once) when frying. They come out crisp and not oily in the least bit. My neighbors ask for them when we have our outdoor get-togethers.

suggestion for those of you in a hurry. Try boneless buffalo wings. substitute chicken tenders for the wings. bread the wings. cook for 8 minutes in 425 degree Fahrenheit oven. Apply buffalo wing sauce. Cook for another 8 minutes at same temperature as above. Serve with Ranch or Blue Cheese dressing.

Sorry for all you folks that did not find these wings great. Purest form of Buffalo wings. No muss, no fuss:Butter and hot sauce.

Nice if you like hot and spicy. For a change of pace try this version: cut the tips off of the wings, and bake in the oven at 350 degrees until done. Mix 2 tablespoons of Mayonnaise, 1/2 cup of grated parmesan cheese, 2 drops of chili oil, salt and pepper to taste in a large bowl. add cooked wings and cover and shake to coat. serve with celery or carrot sticks. My wife loves them this way.

Excellent recipe! If you love extra hot wings, just substitute Tabasco Sauce for the Louisiana hot sauce. Wow, what a kick you'll get from that! Also, I cook my wings on the grill until they are almost cooked, cut them apart when slightly cooled, and then let them soak up the juices in a frying pan on low heat until fully cooked. That's when I'll add just a small amount of Frank's hot sauce, make the blue cheese dressing and oh, what a meal!!!!!!!

As an American living in England, this is my salvation since you can't find good Buffalo wings here, except perhaps in London. (most wings come with barbecue sauce, not hot sauce, concept of "hot sauce" is confusing to Brits, and my husband is a Brit!) But, since I can't get Frank;s or Louisiana Brand, have had to make do with what I can find at local stores (did find some Ass Kickin Hot Sauce, only ok). Does anyone know if you can get Frank's or Louisiana Brand in England? If not, have to wait till I go home! Anyway, recipe is good but butter tends to separate and still not on the mark for the real thing I've had in States. Pretty close though but need to find the sauce. "The secret's in the sauce"! :)

Good basic recipe, but as far as wings go, I've had much better. My suggestions would be to use margarine instead of butter (it's better for texture. This is the only time I use margarine in my cooking.) Add about 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and 1 tbsp of yellow mustard plus 1 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce. Deep-frying in peanut oil gives it a nice texture.

We have been experiementing with this recipe for a while now. Deep frying is the best for crispiness. I dredge the wings in flour seasoned with salt and pepper. When using Franks hot sauce I add 1 teaspoon additional vinegar and a few shakes of Tabasco for extra spiciness. (I usually use my homemade sauce) Also, after tossing the wings in the sauce we will put them on the grill and baste with the remaining sauce. What a special treat these are but you need to like spicy food!

I live in Fort Erie, Ontario across the bridge from Buffalo. This is the standard recipe and therefore if you alter it, it would not be the traditional thing. It is missing the celery sticks to go with the blue cheese.

As was said earlier this is the standard recipe. I like to suggest a couple additions to the sauce, which compliment the chicken nicely. Add 1 tablespoon celery seed and a teaspoon of garlic powder and simmer the sauce for a minute or two before service. Also, frying the wings may increase the fat content but they definitely taste better fried than they do when baked and since you're only having them on occasion go a head and splurge!

This is a pretty standard recipe. In order to make it a little less fatty though I prefer to broil my wings. The result is that the wings are just as crispy, but less oily. Also, after having melted the butter and hot sauce together, I transfer the wings to the sauce pan and stir carefully so not to break up them up, letting it sit over very low heat for a few minutes, then serve.

Add some freshly ground pepper to the butter sauce for a little more depth. Although it's true that baking cuts the fat quite a bit, 1) the skin won't get crunchy enough, even if you broil it; and 2) come on! You don't eat these every day!

Really like the ease of preparation of the recipe- and it is quite good! However, the fat quotient is way too high, even for this yummy snack. One way to cut down the fat is to half the coating sauce, use it to bake the wings at 400 for 20 minutes, then dip them again when they are done and then serve with bleu cheese dressing.
