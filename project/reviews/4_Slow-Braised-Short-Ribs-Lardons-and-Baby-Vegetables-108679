this is a fabulous recipe. make it all the time and freeze it for wonderful, comfy dinners on worknights i completely disagree w/those who omit the lardons. i use applewood smoked bacon. great flavor. DRAIN them -were's the fat? I agree with cooking the tomatoe paste to develop flavor. this is a go-to and can be dressed up in so many ways--more veggies, including mushrooms. i tend to cook this longer than directions so it is melt in mouth tender.

Well this recipe is fabulous. Made the recipe pretty much as noted. I used homemade stock. I used pancetta lardons which I do think added something but could be optional.Only problem I had was judging how small baby turnips were so got very small ones and halved them. Everyone licked the bowl clean. Short ribs trimmed by my butcher were perfect and very cheap.

This was just OK, I wouldn't go through the trouble of making it again.

This has become my signature dinner party dish for the holidays. Everyone "expects" it to be on the menu.

This was fantastic! As other reviewers suggested, I omitted the lardons. I also added the tomato paste before the vinegar and wine so I could cook the tomato paste a little to develop some more flavor, and didn't bother reducing the wine and vinegar (don't really understand the point of reducing it when you add water on the very next step, anybody else know why?). I just skipped the reduction and didn't add any water.

Have made this four times, a hit every time. Skip the lardons - makes the recipe greasy and salty. I browned and braised a veal shank with the short ribs to add flavor. Definitely made a big difference, and a nice treat for the dog. Also - quadrupled the amount of vegetables. Used butternut squash, parsnips, turnips, and red potatoes. Cooked them all ahead of time, tossed them in at the end.

This is a great recipe, however, omit the lardons--who needs the extra fat; and when you're taking out the bones trim off the gristle!

I served this to four hockey players and they scraped the bowl clean

This recipe takes a while but I still do it often. I want to get the veggie cook times down and add them to the pot because cooking them all seperately is a bit of work. I think the cook who says you don't need teeth to eat it may have over cooked the veggies. The meat should be very tender, falling off the bone but the veggies shouldn't be mushy. I think this and the mascarpone cheesecake are my 2 favorite recipes here (so far...). Check out the dessert if you can afford the calories.

Have made this four times-I used Veal demi glace and it was superb.

I made this last night for my very picky friends and they loved it. Served with a tart salad and baguette to mop up the sauce. I've been using epicurious recipes for years, and this is the first time I've wanted to add a review.

I don't understand the hoopla. This was okay, but nothing special. It would be a great thing to serve someone who doesn't like to or can't chew very well, as you really don't need teeth to eat it. But I was disappointed, given all the enthusiastic reviews.

Absolutely delicious. I added a few thick slices of bacon back to the pot, and used fresh veal demi-glace base mixed with beef broth. I think the veal stock gives it a real richness...a very French country-Provencal flavor. Did not use turnips; served w/mashed potatoes, (carrots, butternut squash cooked in later). Great company dish. Mixed plate short ribs with boneless short ribs which are leaner. Very tender. Yummm

Excellent beef stew. I found adding lardons at the end to be a bit too salty. Next time, I think I will skip that.

Instead of using turnips I would use either potatoes or kohlrabi.

I substituted a chuck roast for the short ribs. My husband does not care for bones in his food. My two guys (gluttons) cleaned their plates and fought over the leftover vegetables. This is a great meal for the slow cooker. I used boxed stock and it was good.

Now this is a 4 star restaurant dish. Try it you will love it.

This is a winner! I did use canned beef broth because that's all I had but it still came out great.

Made this dish for a couple of very "finicky" friends and they asked for seconds. I reduced the sauce a little more than the recipe indicated and it made it even richer. A definite keeper!

I made this for a dinner party. Put it all together the day before and had plenty of time to enjoy my guests. I added fresh beets and served it with crusty SF sourdough bread. Everyone loved it!

This is delicious! Very good the first day, yummy the second, and even better 3 days later. 'Couldn't find baby turnips so subbed a medium size one..a mistake I won't make again, as they were a bit bitter. I have a Staub cast iron pot which cooks much faster, requiring only 1hr 20 min in the oven to cook to perfection. We'll do this many times again.

We thought this was delicious. Left it to slowly cook in the oven through the afternoon. I only wish I would have made it the day before to allow it to set and make it easier to remove the grease. We'll definitely make it again.

Very nice and easy. Didn't make the mash. This dish is great for a weekday dinner and also suitable for a dinner party.
