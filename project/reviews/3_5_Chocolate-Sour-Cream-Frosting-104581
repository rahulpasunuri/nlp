this is delicious but I had to add a little powdered sugar - it was just a little too tangy from the sour cream. I probably added about 1/4 cup sugar but I also used only bittersweet chocolate. also added about 1T of corn syrup to smooth things out. Love it!

Best chocolate frosting ever. I cut the recipe in half and it was enough to cover a double layer 8 inch cake. I also only used semisweet chocolate and added about an 1/8 cup confectioner's sugar to give just a tiny bit more sweetness. It was very fudgy and delicious.

I love this frosting! It tastes like chocolate cheesecake. I used semisweet and dark chocolate and it was delicious.

This is my go-to cake for birthday parties. It is incredible! and very easy. I use all purpose flour and it works fine. I will never use a cake mix again!

I wasted a lot of money on good chocolate. I am so glad that I tasted this before I spread it on my beautiful chocolate cake. It was like brown sour cream- and I like sour cream- but NOT on chocolate cake. Yuck.

I had tired over the regular tasting chocolate frosting taste, so decided to try this recipe. It was absolutely delightful! I used it with Martha Stewart's 1-2-3-4 lemon cake recipe and put it between the layers instead of lemon curd and it was just absolutely delightful.

Truly easy with a wonderful spreading consistency - I only used about 1/3 of the batch to cover a round, 12 inch, single layer cake. Great recipe. Will make again and again I am sure.

delicious frosting. I used this for the buttermilk cupcakes and they were a hit at our picnic. Only problem was that I had 30 cupcakes and icing for about 100. Also very easy to make, I had no problem with it getting too thick,

Totally simple and a great taste. I used mainly dark choc.and spread it on the raspberry and blueberry cake which is sweet and it was fabulous.

Super easy and a good alternative to buttercream. It is less sweet than the usual chocolate frosting.

The frosting spread very well and looked fabulous, however was bitter from the sour cream even using the two chocolates as in the recipe.

I liked this frosting, but it was not really as sweet as I tend to like it. However, this is likely due to the fact that I used all semisweet chocolate. I can see now how the milk chocolate would add too the sweetness of the frosting. I was really surprised to see how the frosting set up as I was sure it would just harden and seize with the addition of cold sour cream. In general, it was good, but I like sweeter...

The most delicious icing i've ever made. My friends keep asking for this recipe.

This has become my absolutely favorite chocolate frosting. The combination of milk and dark chocolate gives it the perfect amount of intensity and sweetness, the sour cream gives it a delicious tang, and the whole thing somehow manages to seem much lighter than a traditional ganache made with heavy cream. Try it with the double chocolate layer cake!!!

This is a *great* frosting! I had to stick it in the fridge for about 10 minutes because I was in something of a rush to get my cake frosted -- presumably had I let it sit longer at room temperature it would have thickened enough to be spread without the refrigeration, but that worked perfectly. The only change I made was to omit the vanilla because I didn't see the point of it with all that chocolate. Delicious, thick and oh-so-chocolatey!

So easy and a huge success. Can't go wrong and the better quality chocolate you use, the better it will taste! It goes so perfectly with the sour cream golden cake because the tanginess of each complement the other.

This is the best frosting in the world! At least in my opinion. It's dark, glossy, delicious, rich, it's got a bite to it, and it spreads like a dream. I don't see how you can go wrong with this one -- unless you just don't like chocolate!

tried this with only bittersweet chocolate (trader joes "pound plus" cheapie brand), but it still came out great. i'd agree with the earlier assessment that it's very similar to a ganache. highly recommended if you're looking for an alternative to traditional frostings that, in my opinion, are too sweet.

This is my fav easy forsting. I came upon it when visiting friends who did not own a mixer (how is that possible!0 and I wanted to make a b-day cake. I had to use chocolate chips and sour cream and it still came out fabulous. It sets up almost like fudge on the outside of the cake. YUM YUM!

This is a fabulous twist on traditional chocolate frostings. The sour cream adds a unique flavor and provides a basis to transform what could be an average frosting, to something more of a ganache. I used this frosting on a devils food cake recipe found in an old issue of Cooks, and added a simple raspberry filling (home made raspberry jam combined with frozen berries and boiled with a bit of arrow root for thickening) between alternate layers of a 4 level cake. The result was a beautiful concoction of flavors, all complimentary and none too sweet as to overpower.

The best chocolate frosting I have ever had. It is rich and chocolatey, and still tangy and mellow.

Very easy to make, rich and chocolatey. The sour cream makes it a little tangy, so if you don't like tangy flavors for dessert I wouldn't recommend it.

I do not recommend making this frosting. I found the taste to be unpleasant. None of my children liked it either.

I love sour cream, and I use it frequently in my desserts. This frosting was a lovely and refreshing change from the standard too-sweet choclate frostings I've encountered in the past. The sour cream cuts the sweetness a bit. If you don't like sour cream, don't bother with this recipe. But if you do, you MUST try it!

I used this frosting for the devil's food cake and, although it was very simple, the flavor of sour cream was too dominant. I used european milk chocolate, which seems less sweet than a standard milk chocolate, and that may have been the problem.
