Great chutney. I served it with a basic vegetable curry (red curry base). I will likely use less vinegar next time though. Also, I used half apricots and half figs for the fruit component.

I had several chutneys to go with lamb, and this by far had the best flavor (on the day I made it). I also made it with golden raisins instead of currants. However, upon tasting it the next day, the mustard seed and garlic are over-powering. So eat it the same day.

Very delicious...I served it with this mushroom and goat cheese phyllo pastry I made as an appetizer. My guests loved it!

So easy and delicious. Served it with a vegetable curry. Used golden raisins instead of currants. It made about 2 cups. Maybe the discrepancy has to do with how small you chop the apricots.

Must have been a type o, because the receipe yielded about 1 cup, not 3. Other than that, it is a well balanced sweet/sour chutney. Could possibly be enhanced with a touch of heat, maybe a dash of cayenne. I served it with a roasted chicken - would also be good with pork, turkey, on cold chicken/turkey sandwiches and maybe even mixed into a mayonnaise based chicken salad.

Wondering what these reviewers served with this chutney?

This chutney is very flavorful, but I was disappointed that it didn't yield the 3 cups stated, only about half that. Next time I'll double, or even triple the recipe and add more ginger.

Very tasty. I added 1/2 cup of onions and sauteed them 5 minutes prior to adding the garlic which I doubled (we like garlic). Also used dried cherries in place of the currants.
