Excellent! Made as stated except used 2% milk as forgot to get whole milk--I'm sure that is why it was not as firm as I like. However, perfect ending for our Thanksgiving meal of fish tacos!

I made this for a dinner party. It was devoured by all. Suggestion: put plastic wrap on the surface of each ramekin (or whatever you use to serve pudding in)so the top of the pudding is skin-free. I also added 1/4 cup of brown sugar to the whipped cream.

Made this for a Cinco de Mayo party and it got rave reviews. Required a little attention with all the stirring but was well worth it. Instead of sprinkling cinnamon on top of the whipped cream, I added a couple of chocolate covered espresso beans.

Just so-so. May take a lot more time to boil than directions say. Just not as elegant as I had hoped...

This is fabulous! I made it for two parties super bowl wkend - everyone raved! I had to double the recipe and added slightly more kahlua to the cream and a bit of confectioners sugar. Other than that, no changes. served it in shot glasses for perfect portions. Cant wait to make it again!

This was a very rich dessert that was simple to make. I think the amount of cinnamon in it is adequate because it gives it that distinct mexican chocolate flavoring. I made it for my family who loved it but I think it would be great for guests since it is so simple to make.

This was one of the easiest and most impressive desserts. I decided to make this recipe a few hours prior to my dinner party and I couldn't be happier with the outcome. I put the pudding into separate ramakins, adding the whipped cream at the last moment. Perfect. My guests went nuts over them and I even broke my no sugar diet to enjoy one. Worth it. I did not sprinkle extra cinnamon onto them however, since I wanted a more subtle cinammon flavor. You may even be able to do without the cinammon altogether if need be. Otherwise, the recipe works out very well.
