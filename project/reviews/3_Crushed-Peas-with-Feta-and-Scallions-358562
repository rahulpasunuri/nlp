This is a fantastic recipe. The sweetness of the peas perfectly balance with the tang of the lemon and saltiness of the feta. The addition of yogurt not only proves a great binder, but deepens the flavors of all the other ingredients. Don't skimp on the green onions or mint. Both are needed to round out the palate.

wow this was great - loved every bite, and so did my guests - totally worth the effort of shelling the fresh peas

i thought this was pretty good. i imagine it requires the very best ingredients. (i used peas picked five minutes earlier, excellent olive oil from france, ricotta i made this morning, cabot greek yoghurt, mint and scallions from the garden.) maybe the other people who have rated the recipe used bland ingredients. you also need to carefully taste for seasoning--i added extra lemon juice and a lot more salt than called for here. anyway, i substituted some homemade ricotta for some of the feta. otherwise, prepared as written. very good way to enjoy fresh peas.

I agree this was easy to make, but it's kind of boring. If you happen to have these ingredients sitting around, go for it, but I wouldn't expect anything spectacular.

Loved this! Left out all but a bit of the mint...I just think it is odd. This was great with toasted pita. I'm not a humus fan and this very much matched my palate. We did add a dash of hot sauce and the scallions were very nice.

This was easy to make, but it didn't blow me away. The flavors and the texture didn't really mesh well.
