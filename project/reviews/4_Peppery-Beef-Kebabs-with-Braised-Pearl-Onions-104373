This was a hit at a cocktail party i hosted. In the interest of saving time i bought pre-cut meat (similar to stew beef), but next time i'll cut my own, as they were not consistant in size. I also substituted cubed pieces of yellow onion for the pearl onion, and they were sweet and delicious. will absolutely make again!

It's just not worth the trouble to add the pearl onions so I just leave them out and everyone still loves the appetizer. I use the same rub on pork loin roasts and get the same raves.

Fantastic as a dinner party meat dish! I cooked the meat a little too long and still the recipe was delish!

I made this for a wine tasting party and it out shined all the other appetizers. Take the time and cut the rosemary spears for a fantastic presentation. As a side note, I spent 1 hour peeling baby onions only to find out that they come in a jar pre peeled. Don't make the same mistake I made. This recipe is a keeper to be sure.

This was the hit of the party, the rosemary really brought an excellent flavor and presentation to the sirloin.

This is really a fabulous presentation with raves from all. I also made some with scallops for the non-meat eaters, and they were equally delicious. I used sea scallops and quartered them (they were enormous). Just don't over cook!

Wonderful recipe for entertaining guests. The rosemary flavor penetrated the beef and was exceptional.

Made these for a party and everyone loved the presentation using the rosemary stem skewer. I preferred more color so I used purple pearl onions instead of white. Next time I'll use both. Choose your meat carefully not all sirloin is tender. I like the idea of using pork tenderloin for this as well.

Great recipe! Served this at our annual New Year's Eve party last year and will definitely make it again this year. I did make a little extra spice mix to go on the beef, but other than that followed the recipe to the letter.

These were a big hit at our Christmas party! I followed the recipe to the letter and they turned out perfectly. Also made some with pork and broiled them a little longer.
