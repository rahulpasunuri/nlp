Moist to the point of falling apart and altogether too sweet. Not a keeper in my recipe box.

My husband loved it; I hated it. If you get your grass-fed beef from a local farm, the butcher usually adds fat to the ground beef so it's not dry. This recipe had too much moisture, which is hard to do with meatloaf. Too much egg, too many bread crumbs, too much milk and really not a fan of carrots in meatloaf. Generally, I was really disappointed. I'm glad my husband will eat the leftovers. I will not make again.

Loved this! I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, using grass-fed beef and pork from a local farmer. The only changes I made were to cook it in a meatloaf pan, and used less breadcrumbs than the recipe called for. I don't love really smoky-tasting things, but reduced the smoked paprika only slightly and did not find it overwhelming!

This was a real winner in our house! We don't eat pork, so we left off the bacon and used all beef, so it was slightly on the dry side (I imagine pork would help). The smokiness really came through. Yum!

If you don't eat pork, what kind of bacon did you use?

Very disappointing. The whole thing burned to my sheet pan. I think from the bacon grease that dripped down? I don't know, but the result was burned to a crisp bottom and mushy inside. We don't eat pork, so the only thing I did not follow was the pork ingredient in the recipe. Also, I am a big fan of smoked paprika, but the amount in this dish was completely overwhelming. Another odd thing, the breadcrumb/milk mixture when cooked, separated itself from the ground meat. The whole thing was mushy interspersed with little balls of meat. I would definitely not make this again. Thank goodness there was bacon on top- that's basically what we had for dinner. What a waste of expensive meat.
