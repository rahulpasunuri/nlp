Very tasty recipe. Like others I was forced to cook in the oven, and it still worked great. I can only imagine that it would be sublime when prepared on the grill. The added banana was an inspiration, though agree with others that less cream and butter (and even sugar) is needed.

This recipe was excellent. I didn't even use the heavy cream. I used milk instead. I put in a more banana, and a little more cinnamon and brown sugar.

I have discovered heaven and it tastes like sweet potatoes! I made this ahead for Thanksgiving and agree that, depending on the size of the sweet potatoes you use, you may not need all the cream. I used 1.5 cups and may add a bit more before serving when I reheat them. The banana flavor is subtle (I used one as called for) but I could tell it was there- I wouldn't want it to be too obvious. I also added 1 t of ground cinnamon in lieu of the cinnamon stick, and roasted it all in the oven. Even my husband, who doesn't love sweet potatoes, loved this. I can't wait to serve it and see if anyone notices the banana!

I made the recipe by roasting the sweet potatoes in the oven and grilling the banana on my indoor grill. Other than that I made as written and it came out awesome. He does specify large potatoes so if you are not using ones that size it may be why people are saying there is too much cream. I hand mashed the potatoes as he calls for and added the cream in 4 batches and the consistency was perfect. I thought the flavors nicely balanced.

Quite delicious! Fairly sweet, but terrific flavor. I had made a half recipe and used a full banana because other reviews had commented on how they couldn't taste it. It was a little overpowering. I think 1 1/2 bananas for a full recipe would be perfect. I did not use all of the cream, but did use almost all of it. Wiped the potatoes to make them pretty fluffy to use most the cream.

I prepared this recipe using the oven. I made adaptations along the way. I agree with the previous reviewer. One cup of cream is plenty. Also, I added 1/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon, no salt or pepper.

This came out just OK. The amount of cream specified made the dish too moist. (I wish I had thought to add the cream very gradually, or read the prior comment suggesting no cream at all!) The banana flavor was completely lost.

I skipped the cream, just added some milk and a dallop of butter, along with the grilled banana and some ground cinnamon. Really tasty, almost tastes like desert. Will definitely make this again.
