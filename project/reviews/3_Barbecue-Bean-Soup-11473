Made this last night. A pretty straightforward and tasty recipe. The only substitution I made was to use olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and I also used a hand blender at the end to make the soup a little smoother but still a bit chunky. It was good, but I had higher expectations for it. It was a bit too heavy on the tomato and not particularly barbecue. I think if I were to make it again, I would include some ground beef or steak chunks, a little less tomato (I used 4x 14.5 oz cans and next time would use 3 instead), and I think it would benefit from the inclusion of some Worcestershire sauce and/or a dark beer like Guinness to balance out the flavors a bit more.

good only when served with corn bread. By itself, it's way too spicy.

Terrific, healthy, and filling. Enough said.

Exceptional. I too have been making this since 1993. Roast the red peppers yourself and make the soup a day ahead to allow the flavors to develop. The original menu paired it with cornbread sandwiches having meunster cheese and a thin slice of prosciutto. The combination is excellent. Cannot be improved upon.

We made this when it was first published in 1993, and many times since. We then lost the recipe, and are thrilled to find it here. Definately outstanding if we remember it for 15 years!

This recipe was great. I added a can of golden hominy and chopped up 2 celery sticks. My husband really liked it. I don't feel it needs meat, you get great flavor and protein from the beans. Will definately make again. very easy to make

I would make this again, but mainly because it goes superbly well with beer. I tried making it with half pinto, half black-eyed peas, but I wouldn't do it that way again, as the pintos were far more flavorful.

Don't believe the hype. I was dissappointed in this dish. I found that the Battle of The Strong Flavors (ie, Tobasco vs. Molasses) seemed to cancel each other out. Even with some grilled chicken tossed in, I was still less than thrilled. There's loads of great soup recipes out there, and I'm moving on to 'em and leaving this one behind.

I loved this soup but the second time, I will add grilled chicken as my husband missed having some meat. He thought this soup might be too sweet with molasses, but to his surprise, it was not sweet.

I liked this soup. But I kept thinking "Where's the beef?" The soup is suggestive of chili, which is usually thicker and more substantial. On the other hand, if you want something lighter but with full flavor, this is the soup for you! Served with corn biscuits (or something like that), it will certainly please your family and friends.

This is a yummy soup that the whole family liked--even fussy teenagers! I recommend making it the day before so the flavors can blend.

I also had a leftover grilled chicken breast that I included. I cut the amount of oil in half as well and used olive oil. This soup seems to be a cross between soup and chili, but it is one of the best of either I have ever had. Nest time I am going to include 1-2 lbs of ground turkey.

This was one of the tastiest soups I've ever made. I added a couple chopped chicken breasts I barbecued on the grill, and substituted hot bbq wing sauce for the tabasco. Nummy.
