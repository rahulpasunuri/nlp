P.S. I serve the hoisin-glazed green beans of course with a different entree!

This was a super star dish with rave reviews all around and will definitely make again. Made for a meat lover and he couldn't stop complimenting it. (I also use a similar glaze for green beans. Delicious!)

I made this with venison steaks--and increased the marinating time to 8 hours. Both my husband and I loved the staeks--but the salsa just seemed weird. I would make the marinade again--and use it on other cuts of meat. But not the salsa.

I made this for my elderly parents, and they loved it, as did I. Very very easy. I could do without the nectarine salsa, and just go with some fresh pineapple or mango.

Review from a 9 yr old epicure "OMG this is delicious; sweet and tender and juicy" Marinated a sirloin for a family meal and it got rave reviews.

the quality of the beef is crucial to this recipe. get the best filet you can from a trusted local shop, marinate for a little bit of extra time, and this will be fabulous. when i made it with local beef, it was a 4 forker, but even when i made it with mass grocer filet, it was a 3 forker.

Actually, I wasn't very impressed with this one. My Thai wife and (more importantly) mother-in-law, however, LOVED it. I guess I will be making it again.

I actually only made the salsa - it was great! I'll certainly make it again.

The salsa in this recipe is to die for. I have made it repeatedly through the years and everyone has loved it. I have also substituted mangos for nectarines and it too is fabulous. As for the filet mignon, the sauce overpowers the wonderful flavor of the beef, and I now know I prefer my beef without sauces.

It tasted sort of like barbeque sauce and it left a bad taste in my mouth. I'm glad I didn't bother to make the salsa.

Like another reviewer, I was hesitant to marinate expensive filets - but oh, I'm glad I did! They were heavenly - wonderful taste, and very, very tender. We liked the marinade so much I made another batch to use on chicken tonight. Since there were neither nectarines nor mangos to be had, I used a nice, just-ripe pear in the salsa, and it was fine. This is going to be one of my summer standards!

Great marinade!!! I added a litle sugar to the salsa as my nectarines were not very ripe. Quick and easy keeper.

This was wonderful! I didn't make the salsa because I had neither the ingredients nor the opportunity to shop for them. The beef was abolutley delicious, though. My husband asked me to make it next week for some dinner guests. This would be a regular meal for us if it weren't for the price of the tenderloin.

Oh my yes. Wonderful. I use mango in place of the nectarines for the salsa.

I was a little hesitant at first to make this disch because of the nectarine salsa -- I've never had a salsa that used fruit -- but it sounded like such a pretty dish. The salsa came out wonderful (I used a jalepeno pepper and it worked fine) and the different ingredient flavors came together nicely. I used rib-eye instead because I thought that tenderloin was too nice of a cut to marinate. The rib eye was fine although it was a little tough -- I might try the tenderloin next time. Very good dish overall and a choice when entertaining guests.

Loved this! Yes, the salsa was time consuming, but very good, it would be great with swordfish on the grill. The taste of this was excellent, a little reminiscent of fajitas only much better. I didn't have habanero chili peppers, so I used one whole fresh jalapeno, and that was fine. Even my six year old loved it, (although he didn't have the salsa). I used filet mignon steaks that melt in your mouth. This will be made again, and again. The marinade was a cinch to make and only needing an hour for marinating maked it even easier!

I made the salsa with peaches instead of nectarines and added 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro which I felt was a necessary addition. We used the best quality tenderloins with the marinade which yielded a melt in your mouth steak with a sweet but not overwhelming flavor that pared well with the salsa.

Used Black Angus filets and was fearful of "ruining" them with a marinade. Was I mistaking. Every bite was delicious. The salsa to die for. Luckily we had the forsight to increase the salsa recipe, grilled chicken or pork and salsa wraps for lunch today!

So delicious!! Make sure you buy a great cut of beef - well trimmed and marbled... Also make sure you marinate the meat for the recommended length of time (or longer in the fridge, just make sure it's room temp when you put in on the grill) and do NOT, under any circumstance eliminate the salsa from this recipe. It is simply divine! Plus, you can put it over lots of dishes if (big IF!) you have leftovers.

This is the most amazing recipe! My boyfriend and I made it for 4th of July. We marinated the steaks in the fridge for 2+ hours and made the salsa about 1 1/2 hrs. before we ate so as to really get the flavors mixed. What can I say - the flavor of the steaks is unlike any other I've ever tasted. AND THE SALSA!! We doubled the recipe (we needed a heap of salsa on each bite of steak)and my boyfriend was eating the salsa straight out of the bowl. Really beautiful to look at too - lots of different colors. We actually used peaches - nectarines weren't too nice looking at the store. UNBELIEVABLE!! I will definitely make this again and again! Really impressive looking and tasting - and the salsa would be awesome with other meats, like grilled pork chops. :)

The marinade was divine. I used striploin steaks which worked well. The nectarine salsa is a great compliment to the incredible marinade.

Made this with rib-eye steaks--super! I made the whole salsa recipe for just two steaks. I only used 1 tomato in the salsa, used chilli sauce instead of a chilli pepper, and added a dash of sugar. With those changes, the salsa was excellent--I loved pouring the thickened juices over the steak. The marinade was wonderful too, though I omitted the worcestershire sauce (personal aversion) with no ill-effects.

The nectarine salsa is great!

A great recipe! I used it to marinate a roast that I oven-grilled. For the salsa, I doubled the recipe, and used one small jalepeno to lessen the spiciness - a real keeper!

YUMMIE. I suggest adding cilantro and shallots to the salsa.This is a great steak recipe when you are looking for something different and quite tasty.

Forget the slasa, the steak alone is amazing! Grill pan or grilled this is the best steak I've ever made. Mam, what a marinade!

This is now my favorite way to prepare filets. I have passed this recipe out to numerous other budding chefs and they have all loved it. It takes a while to prepare...but worth every minute!

I used a cheap beef roast and marinated it overnight. We then roasted it in the oven till medium rare. The whole family loved it.

We too tried it with asparagus. It was delicious! Personally, I don't like a lot of hot/spicy food - so we only had 1/2 a habanero pepper and it was terrific. The combination of sweet and spice in the salsa was lively.

Well....I thought this recipe was delicious. We served this with grilled asparagus and it was wonderful combination.
