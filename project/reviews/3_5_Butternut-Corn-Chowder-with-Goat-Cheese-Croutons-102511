One of my favorite recipes found via Epicurious. Easily adapted to vegetarian, non-dairy, non-onion-atarian (sub equal parts chopped celery) or gluten-free. I use Better than Bouillon instead of broth and tend to skip the goat cheese croutons to cut down on labor. Always rave reviews from dinner guests!

My family loves this creamy, savory, smokey chowder. The croutons are a little "fussy" but they add so much to this that I wouldn't make one without the other.

I have made this soup twice in the past month and altered the recipe just a bit. Instead of adding the chipotles which I have tried before and made the soup extremely spicy, I used red pepper flakes which still gave the soup a kick. I also added extra corn at the end so it wasn't all pureed as well as some shredded rotisserie chicken to make it more hearty. Quite tasty!

Soup seemed a little bland but was delicious once I added the crispy bacon and feta cheese. Followed advice of other reviewers and roasted the squash (what a difference rather than peeling/cubing raw!), added garlic with the onion, and leaving the corn kernels whole. DH liked the texture of the soup rather than just a bisque. No chipolte chiles at our local grocery store so I added chopped green chiles for a little heat. Family is NOT that into spicy foods. All in all, nice comfort food. Quite different from a butternut squash sweet bisque I made the week before but equally good!

I absolutely loved this! Chipotle added a nice heat to the soup. Substituted bacon for pancetta, regular low sodium chicken broth, added minced garlic to the onion and skipped the sage and cheese croutons. I thought the soup was a little thin, might add a potato next time and reduce amount of broth.

This was great. Had to use Trader Joe's fire roasted corn (all we had) and dried Chipotle (one large chili). Our store had polenta flower so we used that instead of corn meal, not sure much different. Was 1/2 cup short on broth so used white wine to make up. Added garlic and used plain broth. Excellent dish.

Yes...delicious. Added fresh garlic into regular chicken broth.

Love this recipe but found the chipotle chiles to be too over powering. I used New Mexico green chiles instead.

This soup was fabulous. I followed all of a reviewer's suggestions and roasted the squash, along with a head of garlic and then deglazed the pan with white wine after sauteeing the onions. I didn't bother with making the goat cheese croutons but simply added a bit of the cheese to each serving. Finally, I used applewood smoked bacon instead of the prosciutto. The soup was a huge hit.

we really enjoyed this soup! like others, i didn't make the croutons and just used some fresh goat cheese on top. also, added a few cloves of garlic with the onion. it's a warm, wonderful, cozy fall meal!

I found this soup to be very bland. Maybe it would be better with roasted butternut squash? I agree with the others its a bland tasting but spicy so-so soup. I'm sure I could do much better. Don't waste your time with this one.

I've been making this soup now for years and it's one of my favorite soup recipes ever. My modifications: 1. I just put a sliced round of the goat cheese on top and found it was every bit as delicious and looked beautiful melting into the soup. I love the croutons but didn't have the time last night, and now I'm not sorry! 2. Roasted the squash halves at 350 for 25 minutes which made it MUCH easier to peel and added a nice flavor. 3. Deglazed the onions with 1/2 cup dry white wine before adding the stock. 4. Squeeze in a head of roasted garlic along with the squash. 5. I agree with other reviewers, puree the amount of soup you want to before adding the corn. Remember you can adjust the amount of chipotle to suit your taste, but I think it's a key component here.

very very good. Had it for a weekend family lunch with a nice bottle of Viognier. My mother can't eat wheat so she was pleased to see that the crutons were breaded with corn meal. Thick enought to eat as a one-dish meal but not overly heavy. Nice subtle level of heat from the chipotle (which I upped slightly).

Really good. We like it thick, so I added 3/4 of a boiled potato while pureeing which produced just the consistency I was looking for. Plan to use the potato from now on. I thought the sage might be a little overwhelming, so substituted fresh rosemary instead.

My brother-in-law makes this recipe everytime I visit - It is a favorite of their household. I do not eat pork, so he uses turkey bacon instead - excellent. He also uses Feta cheese crumbled on top instead of the goat cheese croutons; easier to make, and we all prefer the feta taste to the strong musky goat cheese. He purees the soup without the corn, and then adds the corn later to the pureed soup - lovely combination of textures. The chipotles add the perfect kick of spice to this delicious ensemble of flavor - but can easily be adjusted for milder or spicier tastes.

This wonderful chowder has become a Fall staple. Don't change a thing! The croutons are great but dollops of goat cheese on top are an easy, terrific substitute.

great soup and well loved by my guests, however, the croutons were a disaster: even though I froze them for an hour prior, the cheese melted before the crust was completely fried. What did I do wrong? Anybody???

We absolutely love this soup. The combination of the spice from the chipolte chiles and the crunch from the corn is an excellent addition to a traditional butternut squash soup.

Spicy and Wintery! My mom and I made this for a pre-thanksgiving dinner and it was a huge hit. I bit spicy, rich , and delish with bacon crubles. My husband, who prefers food that is hearty and satisfying, loves this- its the only one he'll eat.

Very nice soup. Made for an elegant autumnal dinner party. Prepared the night before - so the flavours blended really well. Easy to make - ensure the pancetta is crip - adds depth to the soup. I will make again.

It was okay. There are alot better soup recipes on the website. Check out the Roasted Butternut Squash and Garlic Bisque soup recipe instead, it is much better.

We really enjoyed this soup at my house although next time, I think I'll cut out the chilis. They didn't do much for us.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year. It was excellent and really easy to make. I was praised at the gathering for the soup--people asked for more. Like others, I didn't blend all of the soup--just about half. And I took out some of the chipotle peppers after tasting how spicy it was (wanted the kids to be able to eat). I just had last of the leftovers and it was delicious few days after as it was that night.

The flavor of the squash and chipotles didn't blend very well. It managed to be spicy and bland at the same time. The corn helped tie things together, but didn't save this soup. The goat cheese croutons would be wonderful on something else.

This soup was really good. I blended everything but the corn and thought the texture was nice. Our family likes spicy foods and the chipoltle peppers add great flavor, however I may back off them a tiny bit next time.

I've made a lot of corn chowders before, but to me this is the best. My husband bypassed the entree to have another bowl of this soup, while my 10 yr. old kept saying what a great cook I am between slurps. Used leeks instead of onion. The chipotle seems to be a necessary ingredient.

One of the few recipes given 4 forks in my book... I also used bacon and added about 1/2 tsp. garlic powder (used chicken broth, not roasted garlic chicken broth). Substituted feta cheese, because my Mom *despises* goat cheese. Other than that, did everything by the book. I think the texture is much more interesting when only part of the soup is pureed. A festive, balanced, interesting, delicious and satisfing soup!

This is one of my favorite recipes in the world! I know the recipe by heart. It's easy to make and everyone I've ever made it for has loved it. It's often even better the second or third day. I prefer to make a bunch of little croutons instead of a few big ones.

I, too, blended the whole recipe (except for the corn). The corn I used was the white petite....VERY tender. And I used bacon. I did not make the goat cheese croutons because of time. Also, I took the suggestion to micro the squash after halving, and then peeling. I would think peeling the squash without cooking it first would be a BEAR. So the micro, then scooping out the squash worked for me. GREAT SOUP.

This is a wonderful recipe! The smoky bacon, spicy chipotles, sweet corn, and smooth goat cheese provide a very pleasant and complex taste. I puree the entire batch for a smoother soup.

THE hit at Thanksgiving, even my father-in-law raved. I pureed the entire amount briefly with good results. Simple to prepare but has that gourmet feel about it. Love the chipotle.

Rating: 3
This was excellent. The chipotle added a nice layer of heat. The goat cheese was a good touch, but instead of hassling with the croutons, I'd be more likely to serve it with baguette toasts spread with the goat cheese, or dropping dollops of goat cheese and crouton cubes on top. I especially like it because all the ingredients are easily kept on hand. Next time I'll try a vegetarian version.

I have made this several times and served it as a meal with a simple salad for supper. It is delicious and quite filling. My guests love the goat cheese croutons!

This is a terrific recipe and pretty easy to prepare. Everyone raved about it, even the picky eaters! I made soup one day in advance without seeds as suggested because our guests didn't like things spicy at all. Next time, I'll include the seeds because we do like spicy meals. I'll be making this again and again.

This was one of the highlights of Thanksgiving! Spicy and sweet, crunchy and smooth--it was wonderful.

I made this soup for a dinner party and it was very well received. I would warn people to use high quality corn though. After pureeing I had tough little kernel husks in the soup - so many that I actually strained the soup to eliminate some. It still turned out fine - the croutons really add to the flavor and the presentation.

What amazed me about this soup was that my husband, who likes neither squash nor corn, really liked it! The toppings and the chipotles add a lot, I think. Thanks for the seeding tip--the soup was plenty spicy even so!

This was, by far, the biggest hit of Thanksgiving...it's absolutely delicious, with or without the croutons and bacon. (I prefer it with, of course) Even better the next day, although there wasn't much left over, I would give this recipe way more than four forks if I could!

The soup was divine; sweet and spicy, and easy to prepare. I prepared it a day in advance and it reheated very well. My guests loved it. Next time I prepare this soup, however, I will be sure to clean out the pepper seeds from the chilies. The soup was a bit too hot, but still delicious.
