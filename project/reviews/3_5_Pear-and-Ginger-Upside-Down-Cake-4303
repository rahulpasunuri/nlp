This was great! I made it for a fall dinner party and the flavors were spot on. I sliced the pears and arranged them carefully in the pan with brown sugar and butter, as recommended in previous reviews. It made a beautiful presentation. I served it with a dollop of whip cream and a bit of dark chocolate. Perfect! I may make it for Christmas dinner, it was that good.

One of the best cakes I've ever made, and so so easy! I followed others advise and arranged the pears on 1:1 creamed butter and brown sugar (1/4c each). I replaced the light molasses with treacle which gave the cake a lovely rich but mild burnt caramel flavor and a great crumb. I replaced the allspice with cardamon and nutmeg, and PLEASE PLEASE don't leave out the pepper!

Pears didn't caramelize because the recipe didn't instruct to melt butter in the bottom of the pan before layering pears. Also, too dry. Otherwise, tasty.

I made this for the first time for a dinner party and received rave reviews!!! I added 1/2 stick butter and brown sugar to the pan and put in the oven to melt before adding the pears and the batter, made a wonderful topping. I didn't have light molases so used half what the recipe called for - perfect! Used the pepper and it added a wonderful subtle layer of flavour. Also I made in a spring form pan which worked beautifuly. Yummy, and leftovers still good 2 days later. Will definitely make again!

This was the BEST cake I've ever made. It was better the 2nd day, after it had a chance to settle in.

My group of 8 loved this. I thought it might be too spicy but was wrong. It was excellent. I made it the day before and served it at room temp with real whipped cream...yummie!!!

The cake is beautiful, with a soft texture. The freshly ground pepper adds a bit of zing. I had to substitute maple syrup for the molasses and the cake seemed fine. I put a tbsp of crystallized ginger on the pear layer but didn't feel it was necessary as the cake is very spicy to begin with. I baked mine in a 9 in springform pan because my regular cake pans do not have 2" sides. It took a bit longer to cook than the recipe indicates.

Every time I make this cake, it gets rave reviews; it's delicious with unsweetened, or very lightly sweetened, whipped cream, and I usually add a generous handful of chopped crystallized ginger to the pear layer. mmmmm...

This was delicious. The liquid sugar used was golden syrup, popular in NZ. My friend made it first, and served it with thick unsweetened yogurt. It is a good marriage of sweet and tangy! Enjoy.

I really did not like this cake. I made it for my family of 10 and nobody else did either. I really dont think I messed it up either. It was way to strong of a flavor. The moasses overwhelmed it.

De-lish! Would like to try the butter/brown sugar with the pears as suggested by another reviewer to get the gooey effect, but this was terrific as is anyways. I drizzled some store bought caramel over the top - perfect fall dessert without huge effort.

The version I have of this recipe calls for a 1:1 butter and brown sugar topping, that you cream and spread onto the pan before placing the pears and walnuts. The topping is really crucial I think, it is all gooy and caremlized afterwards, and helps get the cadke out of the pan.

Fabulous and easy cake. Very sophisicated flavor. Definitely keep the black pepper. It adds a bit of mystery to this delicious cake.

Absolutely fabulous. Make sure you let the cake sit before you turn it over. The pears will stick if you don't! Wonderful spicy flavour. Don't leave out the pepper!

This is fabulous! I usually like to try a recipe a few times before writing a review but this was so good last night that I just had to speak up. I didn't have cake flour so I used 2 TBSP cornstarch and rest all purpose flour to make a cup of cake flour. I also omitted the blk pepper. Just didn't sound right and some reviewers suggested it. I actually baked mine in a bundt cake and I put the sliced pears all over. Served it warm with vanilla ice cream and freshly whipped cream. SO GOOD! I'm having it cold now for breakfast!

This is a wonderful gingerbread type of cake with pear on top... be careful and use a pan with high sides (springform?)

We needed something for Thanksgiving dinner that could be made in advance but not refrigerated, and travelled well. This fit the bill. Nice flavors, and easy to make. Were I to make again, I'd carmelize sugar and add this in before the pears to give it some color. I took the advice of another reviewer and omitted the black pepper. Great the next morning.

This was easy to make and delicious. I sweetened the whipped cream, and added a little bourbon. I also sprinkled some chopped crystallized ginger over the top, which made it extra good. Next time I think i will incorporate the crystallized giger into the batter itself. Used parchment and had no trouble getting the cake out of the pan.

This is a very easy and wonderful dessert. I baked in in a spring form pan and it was perfect. I served it warm with whipped cream and one of my guests ate it again for breakfast with his coffee....a big hit.

One of those incredibly easy but sophisticated tasting recipes. Definitely best if it's served slightly warm. Don't change a thing!

This cake is quite easy to make, it tastes and smells fantastic and it looks great too. I lined the pan generously with butter to solve the problem of the cake sticking to the pan. Would definitely make this again!

My boss gave me some yummy pears from Harry & David so I searched Epicurious and found this recipe to try out on my family for Christmas dinner. The only alteration I made to the recipe was to use full flavor molasses instead of the light flavor since it was all I had. It definitely made the cake dark and rich and probably a little more spicy than it was intended to be but everyone still really liked it. I didn't use parchment as some other reviewers did and I didn't have any problems with the cake sticking to the pan. I would definitely make this recipe again, although next time I might try it with the light molasses and see what a difference it makes.

I used parchment paper as another reviewer suggested and felt it worked well. In fact the parchment didn't cover the entire bottom of the pan, and where it wasn't, I did notice the pears sticking. I, also, could only find regular molasses, but felt it wasn't too over powering. A definite make again, and might even try adding walnuts next time.

Loved this cake! It was easy to make, not too sweet, made for pretty presentation, tasted great. I did use parchment on the bottom. Didn't change one ingredient. Baking time was right-on target for good finished product.

This cake is fantastic. I wouldn't change a thing. Serve it piping hot from the oven- we had ours with apple cider sorbet.

This cake was a little spicy for my taste. I will leave out the pepper next time. I used a nonstick cake pan and sprayed with Pam and still some pears stuck to it. Maybe parchment paper on the bottom next time. I will make again though.

Definitely a four-forker! I sweetened the whipped cream with maple syrup and sprinkled cystallized ginger on top. A beautiful dessert, especially if served a bit warm.

This is a real treat! I used all-purpose flour, 2% milk and the only kind of molasses I could find which looked pretty dark. It turned out perfectly. Enjoy!

I re-read the reviews on this cake and I'm convinced I used a different recipe. I found this cake to be very dry and unappealing. I used fresh ginger but kept everything else the same. I'd rename this one Mediocre Gingerbread with Pears. I tried it again the next day without the benefit of the whipped cream and it was insipid. Bright spot--it was easy to make and the kitchen smelled heavenly!

A real keeper. Used a Tablespoon freshly grated ginger instead of the dry. Not too sweet, but delicious with the whipped cream sweetened with a little sugar and vanila. Would definately make again.

This is an excellent example of a very creative update of an old classic. The heat of the ginger and the mild sweetness of the pears compliment each other beautifully. It has become a family favorite.

I thought this cake was terrific! The black pepper gave it an exquisite kick. I have to admit I used skim milk as that is all I ever have around. Also my boyfriend likes things SWEET, so I added the syrup from the bottom (top?) of the plum upside-down cake (B.A. 6/95) It was great, a terrific balance with the spiciness of the cake.

This was really good. I had no problems as cited in other critiques. Next time, I might split the batter and make two cakes and add some walnuts and brown sugar in with the pears just to make it extra sassy.

This is delicious. I've made it several times and it was a big hit. Not too sweet. I left out the black pepper.

I have made this several times. It is easy, travels well and delicious. Not too sweet, would be a nice winter brunch dist. Take your time arranging the pears and pour the batter carefully.
