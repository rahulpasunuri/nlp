I have made this recipe many, many times over a period of several years. I have always had a problem with the latkes falling apart during the cooking. I keep trying again, because the latkes are so delicious. Does anyone know how to keep them in one piece? I tried, as one reviewer suggested, addong an extra egg, but that didn't help.

This is the holy grail of all latkes recipes. It keeps well and you can have a nice breakfast for a couple of days without too much effort. I use Cynara brand Artichoke Hearts (in a jar- Costco) and serve with sour cream. The recipe is very forgiving: use green onions instead of leeks, goat cheese instead of feta - it doesn't matter, it always tastes great!

I made this last night for a Chanukah dinner and got rave reviews, including from die hard traditional latke makers and kids who don't usually eat feta and artichoke hearts. I found I needed an extra egg to hold it together. They also held together better when I used my hands to shape them into pancakes before putting in the pan. I otherwise made them exactly as per the recipe except for the mint, which I didn't have. I like to use French or Israeli Feta which isn't as salty. Delicious!

For all the work and delicious ingredients, I really expected a lot more taste. I'm not in a rush to make it again, but would have no objections if someone made it for me!

These cakes were delicious! I used only 2 Tablespoons of Olive oil, and egg substitute...they were crispy, hearty, and satisfying. A must-make for latke lovers everywhere.

I made these last night and had plenty of the mixture to make 10 extra-large latkes. The feta was SO good! They were a WELCOME twist to the original that I enjoyed during my years in San Francisco from Russian-Jewish delis and friends. While I defiantely respect those who wish to honor their heritage and religion, I found NY Chef's remarks to be absurd. A modification of a traditional recipe is not an attempt to inflict "suffering" on an ethnic group. In fact, I love modifications of traditional recipies almost as much as I love authentic products. As a person of mixed heritage, I am proud that my mother was able to creatively combine foods from her background as well as my father's. Purists have their place in the culinary world, for sure, but some people have obviously missed the point.

added hearts of palm into the mix and these were great. crumbled a mild stilton on top while warming in the oven and skipped the feta because there was none in the fridge. AMAZING

Yum! Just an aside to New York reviewer. It is not required that anyone eat Latkes for any Jewish holiday (my Sephardic father never had a latke until he came to the US). It is merely traditional to serve fried foods (because of the miracle of the oil). Just because someone's Polish, German or Russian grandmother made latkes, it doesn't mean that they have to be made that way. In fact, the "Jewish Tradition" of latkes was borrowed from the Eastern European countries Jews settled in the Diaspora.

Along with traditional latkes, I make this every year to RAVE reviews from all. I really appreciate reciped like this for my kosher mostly vegetarian (dairy) home!

This was so yummy! I love this recipe but what I love even more is the banter going on in the reviews. I agree that the cook from New York is INSANE. If you don't experiment with recipes (even traditional ones), what's the fun in cooking? Every culture has had their traditional dishes experimented with and changed. Get over it!

If they had called it a potato pancake instead of a latke, no one would be squawking at all. You don't have to be Jewish to make or like latkes, and this Polish goy grew up eating potato pancakes - the modifications in this recipe are fun and tasty. If cooking didn't change with the times, we'd all be eating with our hands, among other things. People need to keep open minds to be good cooks - I don't suppose the Cook from NY wants to give up her blender or food processor or any electric kitchen appliances because they're not 'traditional'?

Well, I admit I tried this recipe almost as much for the controversy as the food (see other reviews, below) but I'm sticking with it because it is so good! I've served it twice so far, and everyone thinks it's great!

i was looking for a way to use leftover mashed potatoes and found this. we don't care for artichokes so we substituted spinach instead. we both really liked it!

The "not-insane" new yorker seems to have missed Bon Appetit's first-line mention of this being an appropriate dish for VEGETARIANS. Surely he/she is not going to suggest that all Jews must eat meat in order to be truly Jewish?!? I think not. I've enjoyed latkes since childhood -- the traditional potato/onion variety, and don't recall ever having had them with meat, "brisket" or otherwise.

Sounds so great, but I don't like the taste of feta. Has anyone tried this with a different cheese, like Manchego or Parano?

Such a tasty variation of Potato Pancakes or Kartoffelpuffer as hey were called in Germany. My whole family loved these. Definately a 4-forker!

I beg the Cook from Washington, DC's pardon, but I am not, in fact, insane. Rather, I am aware that part of the beauty of the latke is its simplicity and its combination of the most humble ingredients available--potato and onion--with large quantities of oil, which for most of human existence was a luxury item not readily used so lavishly. Furthermore, it is traditional to serve potato pancakes with a hearty meat or poultry dish, and I respect the fact that Jewish law forbids taking dairy (feta) together with meat. I doubt Bon Appetit would suggest hamburgers for a lovely Friday night Catholic repast or shawarma roasted with pork fat for a salute to Islam during Ramadan. Besides, brisket is as good as it gets...

These latkes were fantastic! I, too, substituted matzah meal for breadcrumbs (you have to on Passover), but be sure to add an extra egg when doing so since matzah meal is drier. Also, I boiled the leeks with the potatoes for the last three minutes of cooking. Awesome! PS Is the cook from New York truly insane? Why would someone who likes tough brisket and boiled chicken come to Epicurious for recipes? Strange...

This was absolutely scrumcious, especially the next day when I warmed the leftovers in the microwave. The idea that latkes are somehow "holy" is bogus. Check your Bible--only manna was sent from heaven--the rest is negotiable. This Jewish chef would make this recipe again any time...

This recipe is to die for...Our neighborhood has a progressive holiday party every year, and last year we made these in honor of the Jewish Holiday. I'm going to make them all year long, they are so delicious. How wonderful it is to grow and be creative and adventurous while still adhereing to tradition!

I am Italian/American, not Jewish, but the Cook from New York sounds like a person after my own heart. Out of deference to and admiration of him or her, I wouldn't consider trying this recipe!

This is a preposterous recipe, and I am saddened by Bon Appetit's having published it. In the worst tradition of chocolate-chip bagels and broccoli knishes, it is an unwelcome addition to traditional Jewish cuisine. Not every culture needs culinary twists to make its food delicious, and I therefore beg you not to publish brisket recipes with roasted tomato-cilantro purees or feta blitzes with balsamic vinegar-raspberry reductions. Leave the food of my ancestors out of this! Haven't we suffered enough?

This non-traditional latke recipe was a major hit at my family's Hanukah this year. I am making them again for Pesach this week. (substituting matzah for the breadcrumbs, of course)
