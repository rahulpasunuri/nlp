I first made this bread for a small cocktail party. It was very well received and quite a few people asked me for the recipe. It is a great recipe to include when you are preparing several different things because it is a snap to make. This is also good as a simple dinner with an arugula salad.

I love this recipe! It is so simple to make, and absolutely delicious! I didn't have canned figs, so I stewed four extra dried figs in a simple syrup the day before, and refrigerated them in the syrup overnight. I'm making this for a party again this Saturday, and I can't wait to eat it (worth breaking the diet for...).

I used my homemade pizza crust dough. Some prosciutto on top would probably be nice.
