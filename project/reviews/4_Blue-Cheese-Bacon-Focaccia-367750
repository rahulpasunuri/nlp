As an experienced bread baker, I found this recipe made enough dough for two pans IF you like the focaccia thinner and crisper. The toppings got too done (the cheese foamed into nothingness) so I would add them much later in the baking process, although a thinner crust might work better. I also added some carmelized onion as it sounded good with the bacon and cheese. The rosemary didn't stick very well, so I might knead it into the dough next time. Took it to a neighborhood playoff party and everyone liked it, even using it to make sandwiches.

Great bread. I love the topping, but my wife doesn't like blue cheese. I made 1/2 with olives and parmesan / asiago. Very nice both ways.

I made this in my KitchenAid mixer with a bread hook and it made the job really easy. The second time I made it I also added some very thinly sliced, seeded tomato to the topping for a bit of color. Do not overcook the bacon in the first step or it will be dry at the end. It's a very good recipe and everyone loved it!
