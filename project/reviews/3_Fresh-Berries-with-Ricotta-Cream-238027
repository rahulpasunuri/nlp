This was really tasty and a good summer dessert. I used raspberries and blueberries instead of strawberries, but I think you could probably make this with any fresh summer berries.

I made this as it was written, except I used sugar water instead of apple juice. It was delicious! And with in-season strawberries, it's just the best. Since I love creamy desserts, I thought the proportions were perfect.

I made the recipe without reading the previous reviews and was happy that I did - I thought it was fantastic. Very summery and refreshing. I agree with one of the previous reviews about quantities: the puree should be doubled in quantity and the cream should be halved. The strawberries I used were sweet and juicy. Cmbined with the apple sauce it was quite refreshing. Recipe took about 5 minutes to make. I will definitely make it again.

OK, I made this tonight (scaled down for 1). The only sub I made was water for the apple juice as I had none on hand. This was tasty, I mean, fruit puree and sweetened ricotta. Personally, next time (oh, and there will be a next time) I'll reverse the proportions. This creates about 3 times as much ricotta cream as strawberry. I think I'd like more strawberry so next time I puree 1/2 cup strawberry, but only 1/4 cup ricotta (and reduced maple syrup, cinnamon, extract). This would also cut a lot of the calories out of this dessert.

This recipe was really gross. Obviously the puree was fine, but the cheese concoction was just bad, and I love ricotta. Too much cinnamon and the maple syrup is so weird. I couldn't finish my serving.

Loved this. I made the cream and served in glasses with unsweetened apple sauce. My kids really liked it and it took 5 minutes.

I couldn't care less about low-fat-ness in desserts, and I still thought this was a great recipe. The apple juice is really not enough to sweeten the berries sufficiently, but the combination of ricotta, lemon, maple, cinnamon, and vanilla is terrific. After making this recipe, I really enjoy just scooping some ricotta cheese out of the container and sprinkling on some maple syrup, cinnamon, and vanilla extract, and then just mixing it all together with a spoon. It is great at breakfast, instead of yogurt, or if you just want something sweet but not too sweet at the end of a meal. Of course, it tastes better with whole milk, not reduced fat, ricotta.

This is pretty bad. Admittedly, I used non-fat ricotta instead of reduced fat ricotta because the reduced fat ricotta had 3 grams of fat instead of 1gram of fat per oz. Being the health nut that I am, I opted for the less fat While producing a thinner cream, this did not affect flavor. The berry sauce is too sour and the ricotta cream isn't very pleasant. While tasty in theory, it is not in production. Fiddle with the recipe if you feel so inclined, but really it doesn't seem worth the effort: there are plenty of other tasty low-fat desserts out there.
