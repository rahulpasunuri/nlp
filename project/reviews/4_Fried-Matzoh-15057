This is not fried matzoh, this is a savory matzoh brei. Real fried matzoh uses half the eggs (I let them soak for a few minutes); add to a moderately hot pan with oil (not butter, it will burn) and it fries (hence the name "fried matzoh") for about 7 minutes a side, then lower heat and let crisp for another 10 minutes. It should cook for a total of 20-30 minutes.

Next time I'll add an additional egg (as I like it eggy), but besides that, just a nice, basic, matzoh brie recipe.

I've made matzoh brie scores of times, but without the salt & pepper. I add honey, (lots of it), while eating.

Thank you so much for the recipe. This has always been one of my favorite dishes. Ever since my mother died I have been wanting this recipe. Thank You again.

This is impossible to mess up. My daughter loves it with a little sugar and cinnamon sprinkled over the top instead of the pepper.

It's good- what could be bad?

Delicous! Made it for Passover breakfast and it was wonderful served with strawberry preserves. My 86 year old mother, born and raised in Europe, said in Europe they soaked the matza in warm milk (as the previous reviewer stated), so I made a second matza brei using her version --it was delicous too. My husband loved both versions, but when it came down to a vote, he chose my mother's version using milk as best. Either way, this is really good!

Just like bubby used to make! Except that my bubby soaked the matzoh in hot milk (more nutritious for her skinny grandkids?) and also added fried chopped onions. Truly a classic!

I am so happy to find this recipe! I loved this as a kid! So easy and filling on a Sunday morning! My mother used Streit's egg and onion matzoh instead of plain and added a bit of cinnamon! The best!!

I use this recipe myself every year now that I have kids. A nice variation is to add chopped onions. Talk about your comfort food!

Matzoh brei is my favorite breakfast food year-round. It's especially good with cherry preserves (the kind with whole cherries in it). YUMMY!
