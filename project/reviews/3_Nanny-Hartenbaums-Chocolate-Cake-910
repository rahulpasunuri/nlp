as a pastry chef in new york this has to be the worst cake recipe i have ever come across....the measurements are all wrong and and the cake comes out as brownie rather than an actual cake batter....use less wet and increase the dry by at least 15%....better yet look for a new recipe

I'll definitely make this cake again! Yum. All my guests really love it too. I would make a different frosting though - this frosting is fine, but I think i personally prefer something less sweet. I'm a big fan of cream cheese frosting on chocolate cake. But no matter, this was fine frosting, and the cake itself is REALLY good.

I've added this recipe to my perminent repitoir. The first time I made it I ran into the dryness problem. Every time after that I've made this slight adjustment: After the cake comes out of the oven, poke tons of holes in the top of the cake and then I drizzled Khaluah all over the top of the warm cake, then I frosted the cake with the frosting recipe given. The last time I made it was when my parents were out here... my Dad asked me if I had to get a license to make it... very very yummy!

Easy to make and delicious. If you don't like this cake you don't like brown sugar chocolate cake. I used my own frosting recipe and next time I will make it a layer cake.

With a name like "Nanny" I expected this cake to be the ultimate. Instead, the frosting was dry and crumbly. I had to add whip cream to smooth it out which then made it too lightweight. I undercooked the cake by 4 minutes to guarantee a moist cake but it was still disappointingly dry.

I would definately not make this cake again. It stuck to the pan (and yes it was greased) and broke in half when it finally did come out. Very disappointing considering the reason I was making this cake was for my son's first birthday - what a disaster!

My children said"You've outdone yourself, Mom"! they loved it. Some of my friends thought it was too much chocolate. I would definitely make it again. (and easy too)
