Safety note!The light-bulb must be removed from cold oven before use(water spraying during baking will cause the glass to shatter/explode).

This bread's recipe opened a door into the whole new world of Extroodinary Bread's Art; and thus, changed my life, my book-shelf, and turned my kitchen into artesian bakery.Guess, what my boyfiend thinks:))

My hat is off to the Madrid cook. Using the iron to mist the oven! That is creativity! And is inspiring me to try this, simplified as needed.

Ok, so sounds complicated when you read it & maybe you don't have a Pizza stone, or thermometer, or a squirty bottle of water to mist from, don't let that put you off & be imaginative ! I used a earthenware flat typical spanish dish instead of a Pizza stone, I don't have a thermometer & just guess everything, and here's the really imaginative side to me, I used my iron to mist the oven before putting the bread in !!! The result was excellent, looked like the picture and lasted about 15 minutes. My brother thought I'd bought it in the bakery !!!

We have made this several times. It makes a great sandwich when sliced across the middle. We have substituted plain yoghurt mixed with a little fresh goat cheese with success.
