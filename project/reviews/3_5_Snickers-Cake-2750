Yes, this recipe is very time consuming. I followed the recipe exactly and would make the cake part of the recipe again; however, I agree with one reviewer that the buttercream was NOT GOOD. There are much better buttercream recipes out there! Yes, there is a lot of butter in buttercream frosting, but this recipe had 1) unnecessary steps and 2) tasted WAY too buttery and not enough chocolate flavor. I actually added 6 more oz of melted chocolate to the batter to try to salvage the frosting.

So let me start with the only negative I have. This recipe is TIME CONSUMING! That being said, if you know this going in you will not be disappointed. I made this cake for my mother in laws birthday. She is the baker in the family and makes themed cakes for everyone (even made our wedding cake) so I thought it would be nice to make one for her. I followed the steps to the letter with the one exception that I had two 9 inch cake pans instead of three 8 inch ones. About four hours later I was looking at the first cake I had ever made from scratch and it looked pretty good. Delivered it the next day and it was a hit. Everyone has said it tastes great and I think its pretty good if I say so myself. It tastes like snickers and really how can that be bad. I could eat the buttercream icing by itself (and did). If you ask me if I would make it again, I would answer emphatically, "YES! But only for special occasions." ;)

Yes, this cake did involve a bit of time but it was worth every second. The buttercream frosting was fantastic! Definitely not too sweet which is something I look for in a buttercream. The cake is heavy as a previous post stated but the frosting was not heavy and it made for a perfect balance. I will definitely be making this again.I was thrilled to find this cake as my husband requested a "Snickers Cake" for his birthday this year. Delicious!

First off, I am terrible at following recipes. So I can't quite review this exact recipe, but instead my spinoff, which to me better mimics the snickers bar: I made german chocolate cupcakes (from cake mix, didn't have time to do it from scratch), then cut them in half (vertically). I pasted the delicious buttercream frosting, from this recipe, on the bottom of the top of the cupcake. On the top of the bottom half, I laid down some caramel and chopped peanuts. To decorate the very top of the cupcake, I put more buttercream frosting and a piece of sliced snickers bar, cut in a way that exposes the layers. Looks beautiful and tastes delicious...ALMOST too rich, but not quite :)

I'd never made real buttercream frosting before and I wasn't disappointed. Yes, it was a lot of butter, but I didn't think the frosting tasted like a pound of butter as a previous reviewer did. Perhaps that reviewer didn't cook the sugar-water to the right temperature. My co-workers said the frosting was great but the cake was too heavy (I personally don't think a cake can be too heavy).

I felt like Martha Stewart after I finished making this cake. This recipe is not for the faint of heart -no quick and easy steps here. Be prepared to make a few hours time commitment and NO SHORTCUTS! Having said that it was a pretty darn good cake. Not the best, but very good and looks impressive too.

This was the largest disappointment I have ever made! It was extraordinarily time consuming, expensive, and tasted terrible. My guests were far too polite to complain, but I could tell by their expressions (and the wads of icing left on their plates) that they didn't approve either. The icing was the worst part-- a whole pound of butter is exactly what it tasted like. My rating is 0 forks, because it wasn't even so-so.

I made this cake for Easter. After reading all the reviews, I couldn't wait. Sorry to say I was greatly disappointed. It was VERY time consuming, it took the better part of a night to prepare. The finished product looked terrific, but unfortunately didn't taste as impressive. It was bland, blah & our guests really couldn't taste a definite chocolate taste. After all of that work I was expecting a "show stopper" but this cake was not even close.

A lot of work... but WOW! Definitely agree with the comment is a "special occasion endeavor"! Outstanding!

It was UNBELEIVABLE!! Very rich, so serve very small peices or people will not finish them. Really good choice for a special occasion.

I made this for a shower I gave for a dear friend of mine 8 years ago and people still comment on how great this cake was!!!!! It was the hit of the shower
