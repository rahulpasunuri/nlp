I used wild King Salmon with the special mayonnaise and it was fabulous! Be sure not to overcook the salmon. Check it before the suggested time for cooking. I substituted regular paprika and a healthy pinch of chili powder for the piment.

I wish you could give 3 1/2, but almost a 4. I used a fillet and grilled on cedar plank. The mayo is awesome. I made my own, but had to use smoked paprika and regular as substitute for the piment. Black beans are a little plain, but go really well with the fish.

My husband made this for our dinneer tonight. A few minor modifications and he forgot the cilantro. Didn't have the piment d'Espelette so he mixed some hot and sweet paprika that we brought back from Hungary. A delicious dish that we will definitely make again.

This is one of my all time favorite recipes. We cooked it in the big green egg on a cedar plank and used cherry wood to smoke. We served it with Spring Vegetable and Quinoa Pilaf. It was wonderful!! The "next day" recipe with the sandwiches is also delicious!

Will definitely do this again and again for company as well as ourselves. Lovely, subtle combination of flavors and textures, and quick and easy to prepare, too. I didn't have black beans so I used white instead and exchanged fresh rosemary for the cumin. We also do not like mayonnaise so I completely omitted it and we didn't miss it at all. Yum!

Fabulous, easy recipe! I loved that it was prepare ahead so I could enjoy my guests. I've already made it twice, both times to rave reviews. The beans are incredible. Instead of the tomatoes & jalapeños I added a can of Rotel after the other vegetables had been cooking for awhile. I served it with the chilled avocado soup with shrimp and chives. (On Epicurious, Bon Appetit 2001.) It was a perfect summer meal!

It's a keeper. Loved the beans and combinations of fish. beans, and mayonnaise. Found the spice at amazon and while expensive with shipping, a little goes a long way and it was worth the investment. Added some lemon juice instead of water to the beans while reheating and it was a nice addition.

Outstanding meal. Can't wait to make it again.I added fresh corn to the beans and a squeeze of lime and a pinch of chili powder. Used salmon and char.Both were great.Placed it on a bed of arugula.Used chili powder instead of the piment d'Espelette. Definately could serve to company.

Great recipe! I could take or leave the beans, but it all came together nicely with the mayonaise. Instead of grilling the fish I preheated a baking stone in a 400 degree oven, brushed with a little olive oil and baked the fish skin side down for about 10 min (check for flakiness at about 5 minutes) Also, if you can't find piment d-Esplette you can use a mixture of chili powder and paprika in a pinch.

Excellent; dried ground ancho chili worked as a great substitute for the piment d'espelette. Will love to try as written if I come across this spice.

a fabulous meal. i used spanish paprika instead of the piment d'Espelette, it may have tasted different but it was delicious. The combination of the black beans, mayo, and marinated salmon was wonderful, will definitely make again.

An amazing recipe. We used Copper River Sockeye Salmon which notched it up a bit. No time to make soup so we sliced an avocado on top, delicious! Served with a cold salad of honeydew (chunks) and jicama (large dice) with mint, lime, and grey salt. Planning to serve for Father's Day. A perfect summer evening.

This was delicious, even worth the $14 I spent on a jar of Piment D'Espelette. It does carry some heat, so everything else should be smooth. I left the celery out of the beans, and they were scrumptious.

This was very good. Per the recommendation of another reviewer, I served it with a cold cucumber/avocado soup for starters. We also had margaritas which complimented the dish well. Will do again.

the mayo was AWESOME with Trader Joe's sweet potato fries.

This was AMAZING!! I used hot paprika instead of the piment d'Espelette and it was delicious. I was told this is the best meal I have ever made. As a starter I did avocado and cucumber chilled soup and I served the main with ciabatta bread and basil and sundried tomato butter. Perfect match! Am definitely going to make this again.

I suggest using lime instead of lemon and serving the beans cold. Prepare them a day ahead to let the flavors penetrate. DMK

This was DELICIOUS! I used fresh halibut as I did not want farm-raised salmon which was all that was available at my market. I also did not have piment d'Espelette for the Mayonnaise, so I substituted an Urban Accents spice called Mesa Rosa Chipotle. It is probably a completely different taste, but it was excellent. The black beans are a great addition.
