I really enjoyed this vinaigrette -- it's something that you might see dressing the salads at "Asian fusion" restaurants. At one point I was tempted to add some sesame oil and ginger and make a basic oriental dressing -- esp. since this salad was the starter for a grilled ahi tuna dinner -- but I'm glad I refrained. The lemon and olive oil make this dressing unique. I didn't think it was sour at all. Just be sure to use fresh lemons and garlic and a good quality EV olive oil. Simply adjust salt, pepper, and even the soy sauce to taste.

WAY too sour. We've enjoyed other citrus vinaigrettes on this site but not this one.
