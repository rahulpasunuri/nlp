Maybe I did something wrong but I followed the recipe and thought these were awful!

I was able to use less butter and 1% organic milk. They were great!

This is basically best recipe but I changed some of the ingredients. I added 8 0z. of shredded mexican mix of cheese (in stead of the blue cheese) you can find in grocery store. I didn't steep rosemary in milk. I added 3 TBS chives into cheeses. Next time I would use 3/4 cup milk as was a tad dry!

Replaced rosemary with fresh chives. Used about 1/2 the butter. Replaced roquefort with a mix of gorgonzola and fontina and topped potatoes with emmentaler instead of gruyere. Great! PS: used the discarded tops for potato skins with cheese 2 days later - also great.

This recipe is great!!! Made a few mods though. Instead of throwing away the tops I added cheese, bacon and chives, baked until melted and used as an appetizer!!! Husband doesn't like Roquefort or Gruyere, so I used the Mexican Mix Shredded Cheese bag. Turned out wonderful!!! Thanks for the recipe

this makes really nice potatoes! i was running out of time so i half-cooked them in the microwave before i convection baked them and it worked perfectly.

Overall this was good, but I might use more milk next time because mine were a little bit dry. That could also be due to the fact that I cut back on the butter, though. Next time I think I'll use the full amount of butter. These are perfect for company since you can have them fully prepped before people arrive, and then they really do cook in about half an hour.

Made this tonight, biggg hit. Used cream instead of milk because I happened to have cream which made it even fattier. I was not a big fan of twice baked potatoes before this

This was a great dish, although (like most Bon Appetit and Gourmet recipes) the butter called for is easily twice what you really need. I used 1-1/2 tablespoons and it was fine.

These are so easy to make. I love cheese and these hit the spot. The grocery store I went to didn't have Roquefort so I used Noble Blue Cheese. Made the full recipe even though it was just me and another person. So good I had two!
