I have made this potato dish numerous times, definitely a family favorite. The combination of flavors between the olives, mint and feta is just incredible. I recomment using good quality feta and olives for this as well as fresh mint. They will produce flavors that are better pronouned in this dish. Also, I cut back on the olive oil and just drizzle a bit in. A quarter cup is a bit much.

Used to make this recipe and it was always a favorite of my family and at parties. Over the years the recipe was lost and I stopped making it. Am so happy to have found it again! It is a real crowd pleaser and oh so easy to make! I highly recommend it

Loved this recipe! I made a couple of changes. Roasted the potatoes, with a bit of olive oil, kosher salt and pepper, rather than boiling. Added a squeeze of lemon juice and a bit of dried oregano to the dressing. I have received many requests for the recipe.

a winning recipe -- I boiled the potatoes in plenty of sea salt -- drained, then tossed in olive oil, chopped mint and feta, then sprinkled with mint, feta and seedless Kalamata olives. truly divine. a crowd pleaser.

This is absolutely one of my favorite recipes ever. I got the recipe from my brother-in-law when it was first published. I often wonder if he loved it as much as I did. I long since lost the paper with the recipe, but the great things is that it has few, easily remembered ingredients, so substitutions and approximations are easy to do!

One of my favorite receipes. I make it all summer. I usually use about half the feta the receipe calls for and don't bother with the garnish. Yukon gold potatoes work as well.

I made this for friends last weekend and it was a big hit -- enough that the cooks want the url for this.

Wonderful and a big hit. Feta and potato and olive oil worked together well.

Yummy, but not outstanding. Good for a quick picnic or summer dinner, but not gourmet fare.

Easy, delicious crowd-pleaser. If you have any picky eaters in the crowd, just don't tell them what's in there, and they'll probably end up liking it anyway.

Wow! We really liked this. Great with grilled lamb chops. Don't change a thing.

I served this at a party when it first appeared in the magazine. I had not thought about it in a long time, but I have had two requests for it within the last month from people that I haven't seen in years. It's delicious.

This was a very easy dish to prepare and was great paired with a roast lamb!

Excellent! I would just slightly decrease the amount of feta and olives, if the feta you are using is especially salty.

Served this with Mustard and Rosemary Game Hens. It was great. FRESH MINT makes this a great dish.

I added juice from 1 lemon and several garlic cloves to spice things up. Good accompaniment to grilled lamb.
