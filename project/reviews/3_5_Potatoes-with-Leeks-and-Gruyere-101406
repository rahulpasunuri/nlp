These were outstanding; made them easter sunday. I used a 1 lb, 14 oz bag of frozen shredded hashbrowns and let them thaw enough for frozen chuncks to seperate; when i sauteed leeks in the butter i added 2 cloves of garlic...made them in the morning and covered with foil and reheated them at 4pm. 4 stars!

My husband and I did not care for this- the flavor was acceptable, but the texture was somewhat unappetizing.

Not as well-melded flavors as I'd have liked. The gruyere was lost in the dish. Definitely edible, but I wouldn't make it again.

Followed a suggestion to use frozen shredded potatoes. Sooo easy and sooo good.

A great, simple potato dish that can be used any time of the day. I also sauteed a red pepper just to add some color to the dish and added some fresh thyme. I made it for Easter so it was nice to be able to make it a day ahead. The taste is pretty much what you would expect given the ingredients. However, my guests all raved about it.

I have made these potatoes for my family many times, and we love them everytime. I do, however, always use Yukon Golds.

This dish was average at best. The ingredients sounded so great, all things I love. But I was disappointed. The texture was a bit gummy and the flavor was nothing special. Much better recipes for potatoes on this site.

Loved, loved, loved it. Wonderful flavor and texture. Using the white potatoes is key, as is choosing a nicely-flavored gruyere. A definite keeper.

I think I may have found the 'flaw' in this recipe....I made it again but with russets adn was not nearly as good....I know it doesn't sound like rocket science, but I think to most people a potatoe is a potatoe is a potatoe. In this recipe, that isn't th4ee case. You must be sure tod use a superior quality potatoe of good flavour an texture to begin with, like a sweet red skinned or a nice yellow-fleshed variety, that will hold it's own against the leeks and integrate nicely with the other ingredients. Assure that you are using superioir potatoes to begin with, not just what you might have on hand, and it may affect your results. Good luck!

I know I'm in the minority, but I didn't care for this at all. Neither did my family, most of whom are potato lovers. It was flavorless and unattractive. Perhaps I did something wrong, but I can't figure out what it is.

I made this to take to my inlaws' for Easter dinner, and it was perfect for our needs. Since my mother-in-law was planning just a simple ham, she requested a more substantial side. Since I was transporting it, I needed to be able to prepare it in advance. It reheated beautifully, and the flavor was fantastic. I used neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese with no ill effects, and 2% milk instead of whole. Still very rich without being over-the-top (needed to save room for dessert, after all!). MIL requested the recipe, and I will definitely make again.

Decided to try something different from the traditional scalloped potatoes with this year's Easter Ham (you must try the Balsamic and Dijon-Glazed ham on this site--amazing!!) and the fact that this was a 'make-ahead' dish tipped the scales in favour of this recipe, despite some reviews of failures from previous readers. My experience was that his is a verrrry tasy dish, and one that will be made often in our home. All my guests had seconds, and in some cases thirds! I modified the recipe somewhat, as I prefer a healthier diet and found this recipe a bit too high in fat. I used low-fat cream cheese, 1 cup of evaporated skim milk, 2 large eggs and 2 cups of shredded gruyere. It was still delicious, and I didn't feel guilty about having seconds!!

This has become a family favorite. We always make it ahead of time without it turning colors on us- maybe because we use the refrigerated packaged shredded potatoes. Very easy and delicious.

oddly enough I love all the ingredients, but together it was nothing special. NEXT!

This recipe has become a family favorite ever since it first appeared. The flavors of this dish marry very well together and are the perfect complement to traditional spring entrees such as ham. One caveat: Do not assemble this dish ahead of time with the intention of baking it later. The shredded potatoes will turn dark yielding an interesting purple casserole. Bake ahead and reheat, as the recipe suggests.

This is a great side dish for lamb, filet, ham or any hearty meat. Nice flavors especially from the leeks. I add a little garlic also.

I actually made this twice in a week for 2 seperate christmas dinners. It worked out great, because I could bake it ahead and freeze it, then just rewarm it in the oven. I made sure to use plenty of pepper to keep it from being too bland.

WOW...This is the way potatoes should taste. I would hate to try this without a food processor, but using one makes it almost a breeze

Excellent ! Especially a big hit with the men. Have made several times - can make in advance, freeze and thaw & heat to enjoy.

I lost track of which magazine (out of my hundreds) contained this recipe, so I was thrilled to find it online. Definitely worth 4 forks; I love it, and everyone I've served it to can't wait to have it again. Leftovers warm up beautifully on a cookie sheet in the oven. If I'm not having a crowd, I like to cut the recipe in half and cook it in a 10-inch glass pie pan. I like the presentation better when it's cut into wedges.

Great make ahead recipe! I made it for Easter and everyone loved it. It is very tasty, similar to a potato pancake. I would definately make this again for a family function.

This dish was delicious and everyone loved it. It was perfect for Easter dinner. The cheese makes it a little rich but it browns nicely on top and makes a great presentation. I gave this recipe to several who asked for it.

I had originally picked this recipe to teach my mom to use her new food processor, since it would definitely use all the attachments. It was a huge hit!!! The six of us at Easter dinner ate nearly the whole pan! I would definitely make this for another dinner party.

Very good and very easy to prepare. Be sure it's really hot when serving. To lighten this a bit, I've also made it with 1/3 fat cream cheese and skim milk and it was very good. This is the perfect dish to serve with a time consuming main dish.

This was a great potato recipe and got wonderful compliments from my Christmas dinner guests. There were 13 of us and I did have a little leftover. I loved the fact you could make it the day before. I did omit the nutmeg (on Mom's behalf). I served this with the Beef Tenderloin with Roasted Shallots, Bacon and Port that is also on this site. This recipe will definately be repeated in our house.

I made this as a side dish for a family dinner. Everyone loved it, and my stepdaughter, who is a vegetarian, has repeatedly requested that I make it for her. As a main dish, we serve with a Pinot Grigio, which compliments the subtle flavors. Enjoy!

I gave this 4 forks not only because it has wonderful flavor, it's sooo easy to make, and it can be made ahead. I used the food processor to grate the potatoes and cheese. I used reduced fat cream cheese and non fat milk to lighten it up. Don't skimp on the leeks or pepper.

This is one of the best recipes I have found for potatoes to serve with rack of lamb. It goes together very easily, and holds well for the time needed to cook racks. I would highly recommend this recipe!

This is a tasty change for potatoes and makes for good leftovers if there are any. Can be made a day ahead and reheated.

I'm planning to make this for Easter tomorrow, so I tested it on my family last week. It was delicious! I liked the souffle quality the eggs gave the dish. I used 1 lb. of frozen hash brown potatoes (thanks to LaVerne for the hint) plus 2 fresh grated Idaho potatoes. The hash browns added a chunkier texture, which improved the dish.

Made this last year from Easter, and everyone raved. Am repeating this year.

I made this for a dinner party and it was a big hit. I simplified by using frozen grated potatoes for hash browns. Worked great and made the job much easier. But be sure to get plain ones without any seasonings or added ingredients

thought it was time consuming (especially the grating of the potatoes) and the flavor was bland. It was quite moist, so I liked the consistency-perhaps a different(and more)cheese. Crumbled bacon might improve it as well.

I made this dish for Easter '99. It was a hit so, I made it again for Thanksgiving. I used the shredded pototato method, which made it interesting. I don't know if it would be quite as good if you sliced the potatoes, as other cooks have mentioned. Great flavor! Bake until brown, but don't over bake. It burns easily. Very easy!

I made this for Easter for 9 people. Since it serves 12 I thought I might have a spoonful or two leftover. HA! Everyone went back for seconds and someone even scraped out the remains with a spatula! I'll double it next time so that I can at least have a little the next day. Yummy!!!!

I made this for Easter and everyone loved it. The recipe says it serves 12 -- however, unless you're having a rather large buffet, I wouldn't plan on more than 8-10 servings from this dish.

I made this dish as part of the Bon Appetit Easter supper. The entire meal was delicious. I'm making this dish again today to go with roast pork.
