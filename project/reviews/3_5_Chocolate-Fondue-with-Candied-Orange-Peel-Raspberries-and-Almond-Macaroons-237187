The macaroon recipe was incredible. Those are one of my favorite types of cookies and it's hard to find a good almond macaroon cookie. I cheated and bought candied orange peel. The chocolate fondue was just so so - nothing special. The beauty lies in all the flavor combinations, which were brilliant.

I made only the macaroons from this recipe, since I love anything with almond paste! They were delicious--not like a typical macaroon since there is no coconut. They were very easy to make and I had no problem with any part of this recipe- -except my husband loved them so much that they didn't even last for 2 days!

I made this fondue (complete with the macaroons and candied orange peel) to share with my husband on Valentine's Day. It was absolutely fantastic -- no changes were necessary. I had doubts about the macaroons (the dough was softer and wetter than I was expecting), but it worked fine once I realized that I needed to spoon the dough into the sliced almonds instead of trying to shape it into round balls first.

I confess--I only made the macaroons. But 4 forks to them as they were so easy and so delicious that I've already made them several times again; it's a real plus that the macaroons are made from simple ingredients, easy to stock in the pantry. Two tips: a dusting of powdered sugar at the end aids their aesthetic appeal. Also, surprisingly, after making a vegan version for my vegan daughters, I now regularly substitute 1/4 cup silken tofu for the egg white. It makes them a tiny touch sweeter and vegan-friendly.
