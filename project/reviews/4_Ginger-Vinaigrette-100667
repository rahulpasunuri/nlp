This has become our go-to asian style dressing for salads. It is really delicious and easy to make. The only change I made was to dial down the garlic, and I also used a blender rather than a food processor which made a very smooth and creamy dressing. I blended it for a good minute after the oil had been slowly drizzled in.

I love love love this vinaigrette and so does everyone else who has had it at my house. I use white onions if I don't have green. It is also really easy to make.

This is the best Asian style salad dressing I have ever made! I put it on a salad od chopped romaine, cabbage, red bell pepper, and grated carrot. Chopped roasted peanuts would have made great addition.

Very tasty but I agree with the comment that there is too much garlic. Next time I will do one clove only. In place of 1 Tab. of the rice vinegar, I used Yuzu juice, which gave it a nice citrusy tang.

Excellent for dressing all kinds of raw veggies. I think it would also be nice as a substitute for peanut sauce if you were cooking for someone with a peanut allergy. I used it to dress some very plain chicken salad - it really kicked it up to meal quality as far as tastiness goes, though I will not win any awards for food styling: http://www.whatihadfordinnertonight.com/?p=6564

We really enjoy this dressing with stir fry's etc. It is easy to make and stays well refrigerated.

This was delicious! I will definitely make this again. I'd recommend using the vinaigrette sparingly, it is quite strong. You can also use half the garlic, green onions, and sesame oil. But i love garlic and onions.

I have made this recipe many times and it is always a big hit. You can adjust the garlic down if you are sensitive to it.

Excellent salad dressing. Restaurant quality. I used ginger paste for convenience.

I've been making this same recipe for years since it first came out in Bon Appetit. It's a staple in my recipe box. It's just the right amount of flavorful. I usually slice green onions and add it to the salad dressing or to the salad I'm making.

This was very tasty and a perfect dressing for the sesame seared scallops salad I made. I used one large garlic clove and sauteed it first in a little olive oil. Followed the rest of the recipe to a T though.

made it without the canola oil for a lowfat variation - superbe.

This is one of my all-time favorite vinaigrettes and a staple in my collection because it is so versatile. I marinate fish and chicken (shrimp, too)in the dressing, grill, and lay over a bed of greens also tossed in the dressing. If the garlic is too powerful, just add less. I love garlic, so it's just fine for me. Yumm!!

I enjoyed the spicy ginger in this dressing. But unfortunately the dominant flavor was sesame oil and hot, overpowering raw garlic. The combination was so strong that it completely wiped out the scallops...I might as well served cheap pieces of whitefish in its place and saved ten bucks. If you LOVE sesame flavor and you ADORE hot, raw garlic - you will be impressed by this vinaigrette.

Honestly,not impressed.Tried it with the scallops as mentionned.Scallops are too delicate for the strong taste of the vinaigrette.Overbearing...

GREAT! I added 1 fresh jalapeno (chopped and seeded) and 1/4 cup fresh cilantro to the dressing and prefer red wine vinegar (and more ginger). Put over salad greens, celery, cashews, red bell pepper, avocado, purple onion and dried cranberries. Salmon on the side or crumbled on top. (Heat salmon both sides with olive oil and chili pepper.) I have made this for guests two times and everyone raves about the dressing.

Fantastic. I used it with the scallop recipe the other night, but I just finshed a bowl of rice with it drizzled over top. Really, really good.

An excellent, thick and creamy dressing - not a typical thin vinaigrette. Love it on coleslaw - red and green cabbage, shredded carrots, sliced spinach, red onions, fresh bean sprouts, fresh cilantro. Such a healthy and fresh tasting salad and a great change from ordinary coleslaw. Give it a try - you will be pleasantly surprised!

I have made this dressing a few times and everybody loves it and asks for the recipe. I just made it again over the weekend for a potuluck and I can't get enough of it. I made a salad of mixed greens, cucumbers, diced red and yellow pepppers and some sliced green onions. When asked for the recipe, I tell everyone about epicurious and the many great recipes that are on this site. I especially enjoy reading other's reviews and any recommendations that they have. Keep up the great work!!!

This is a great vinaigrette recipe! I've had many, but this is the best. Loved the fresh ginger and garlic - and cut down the sesame oil to 1 tablespoon. Will make it again - often!

I used this dressing at a dinner party, last evening, and everyone raved about it! I, too, thought it was superb, and I am sure I will make it many times in the future.
