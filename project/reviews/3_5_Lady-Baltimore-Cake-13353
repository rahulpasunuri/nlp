While the recipe is relatively simple, this is the best cake ever. I'm not fully confident in the 248° syrup. I always use the seven minute icing variation, putting the egg white-sugar mixture in the top of a double boiler and whipping it with a handheld mixer until stiff peaks form. Then transferring the mixture to the bowl of a stand mixer and beating it at high speed until cool.

I live in New Mexico @ about 5,000 ft. Maybe that's why, but I never could get the sugar syrup to boil at a temperature above 210 degrees F. Without the icing, the cake was only ordinary.

I only bake one cake a year, and since it is for my Wife's birthday I make anything she asks for and this year she asked for a Lady Baltimore. This cake was so good that I have asked her to make it for my birthday. If the directions are followed exactly this cake should turn out great for anyone.

So I just finished serving my first ever Lady Baltimore Cake for a birthday dinner. Every part of the recipe worked fine and the frosting was impressive and plentiful but I must say this was a VERY labour intensive cake, and I own every possible modern culinary convenience and have a great deal of experience with cakes. I'm not sure how anyone without an industrial stand mixer could ever make this icing. My biggest problem was then, transporting it, which I managed by the grace of god. (It cant be wrapped) and it was too tall for any carrier I own. I followed the recipe exactly and put the excess frosting into a piping bag and piped a nice border around the bottom. I was concerned about the cake because I didnt see a single photograph in which it looked truly beautiful. I was able to smooth this icing to perfection but I wouldnt suggest it for a novice. I might make this again if I had a specific request but its definitely not going into the regular rotation. I dont doubt this cake was enjoyed in the finest homes of the time as it may well have needed a staff. The cake was impressive, both visually and had a very distinct taste, I have no complaints about the cake.

This cake received great reviews at a party I attented. The frosting wasn't my personal favorite but I enjoyed the experience of making it. I added dried cherries to the filling for an extra punch of flavor. For a picture of my cake please check out my blog: http://dozenflours.blogspot.com/. It's under the month of March 2007.

To the other cook from Charleston - I, too soak my dried fruit before adding to the icing. This is an easy Lady Baltimore recipe and well-received by the dessert afficianados at our tea room!

I recently made this cake for a Client who wanted a White Lady Baltimore Cake for her wedding cake. I omited the dried fruits in the Icing. As a professional Pastry Chef and cake decorator I HAD no problems with the cake or the icing. I will gladly make this cake again.

I have made this cake for a church tea room in Charleston, SC (which, by the way, is where the cake orignated - Owen Wister's story is based on a fictional tea room in our Holy City). The one difference is we traditionally soak our dried fruit and nuts in 1/2 cup of sherry overnight before adding it to the icing mixture!

This is the classic recipe. I have never had it fail. To the one person from Baltimore who had a problem with white boiled icing the recipe must be followed to the letter. The hot sugar syrup must be added to a running mixer of the steff beaten egg whites in a thin stream and must continue to be beaten until the bowl is at room temperature. That's it. To "pour" it into the beaten egg whites will of course deflate the whites as there is no time to be properly incorporated. The cake is rich and therefore reserve it for large dinner parties of 10 or more. But please, don't blame one's lack of technique on the recipe. Jay of Baltimore

Everything about this cake was problemmatic, and I'm a frequent baker! The frosting did not work for us--pouring in the hot sugar made the egg whites deflate--and we ended up with a soupy, sticky mess. The taste was good but so rich that no one could eat an entire slice. This cake was a waste of my time and my money.

I've searched for years for this recipe. This version makes the exact cake that my Grandmother so dearly loved and that was so popular in the 50's. The cake gets its name from the novel, Lady Baltimore, written by Owen Wister, in 1906. If you're going to make this cake, don't mess with the ingredients - everything about it is perfect, offering a taste of "history".

I had 4 egg whites left over from an other dish and made half the cake recipe and not the filling. The cake was great with a nice texture kind of a cross between a sponge cake and a pound cake. I just put a simple caramel coconut frosting on it but I think it would be good with stewed fruit and whipped cream.

This is a wonderful dessert to serve for a "Preakness" party. It is light and airy and pretty. I have served this receipe on numerous occasions.
