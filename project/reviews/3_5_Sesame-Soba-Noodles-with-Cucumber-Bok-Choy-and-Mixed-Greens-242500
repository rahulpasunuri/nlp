Bland with, as my husband put it "a long lasting weird aftertaste." This was a lot of effort for terrible results.

Loved the dressing. I changed up the veggies a little: lightly sauteed zucchini, baby bok choy and snap peas (I'm not a fan of raw bok choy) with a little olive oil, sesame oil and soy sauce. Served the noodles and veggies hot. Threw in watercress and scallions to top it off. Yum!

This was so good.... *so good*. I changed a bit, but kept the sauce as it: zucchini instead of cucumber and I sauteed the veggies in a bit of sesame oil. I added some water chestnuts for crunch. Delicious!!!!!

Made this to a T except used one head of regular bok choy, as my store didn't have baby. I planned on adding the mixed greens but, with the regular bok choy, my salad kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger, until I even left out some of the bok choy because my large salad bowl was full! BUT this recipe is a definite keeper. My husband LOVED it and he's a real meat and potatoes kinda guy. I thought the dressing was to die for. I think I'll play around with the ingredients a bit next time but, great summer dinner for sure!

Okay, this review is basically for the dressing, because i made a lot of changes to the other ingredients  but this was the bomb! made the dressing exactly as written except more peanut butter , used cabbage only for the veggies because that's what i had (but used a lot  maybe 4 cups) and much less udon, since i wanted it to be more of a slaw. it was incredible, and the leftovers will still be great tomorrow, as cabbage holds up much better than salads with lettuce!

I've made this dish twice now and am already looking forward to making again. The first time I made it, i forgot the bok choy. This time I made it with bok choy. I like it better without the bok choy. Other than that, I really love this dish. Great way to get your vegtables in...

I made this exactly except I left out the mixed baby greens. It was delicious but only served 4 not 6.

This recipe was the source of the most serious argument my husband and I had ever had. His problem with the recipe is that it is too green, not enough contrasting colours. I liked it at the time but now, well...Who knew a person could feel so strongly about green noodles?

This was good but not great, it seemed to be missing something so we tried adding soy sauce at the table and that helped a lot. Next time I would use more peanut butter as I thought the sauce/dressing was kind of thin, and probably a vegetable like broccoli instead of the bok choy. I also added some bell pepper for color. I will try it again as it does make a nice vegetarian warm weather dinner.

So good I dreamt of leftovers all night! And then ate them for breakfast. I followed the recipe exactly, which is unusual for me, but there were so many flavors contending for attention I figured I'd try out the recommended ratios first. It was close to perfect. After having done this once I agree with the comments to perhaps add more peanut butter and some red bell pepper for color would have also been nice. My boyfriend said it was a "10 outta 10" and he's a meat eater. It was a perfect meal with a little sake. I'm looking at my calendar to find an opportunity to make this again soon!!

I pretty much stuck to the recipe, except for adding some suggested nam pla, and enough extra peanut butter to thicken the dressing. (My first measure of peanut butter was the HOT kind from Surinam, the additional was ordinary creamy.) I also threw in a handful of haricots verts that I had steamed. I served coriander, toasted sesame seeds, and the chopped peanuts as optional toppings, and everyone loved it.I will definitely make this again!

The sesame soba noodles were really good. It worked well with the substitution of grapefruit juice for the orange juice. I thought the sesame flavor lacked dominants. More peanut butter in the sauce would probably make it thicker and richer. Next time, I might forego so much lettuce.

A "chic" dish -- the women loved it, then men were lukewarm about it. Good -- PERFECT for a ladies lunch or dinner...

I generally agree with the previous reviewer from Boston. This dish was a nice try but not great or even really very good. It was wet and a bit bland and we also threw away the leftovers.

Rating: 1
I was not a fan of this at all. I've made much better peanut-type sauces with other epicurious recipes. The proportions were all off, not enough noodles. The flavor of the sauce was too many ingredients fighting for superiority, in my opinion. I threw away the leftovers.

Our red pepper flakes are on the mild side so I added a half teaspoon of chili oil. I took the suggestion of an earlier reviewer and added a fresh red pepper to the julienned vegetables and also skipped adding the canola oil. This is on our list of regulars!

Yum. Great recipe. Added red pepper as suggested... it's a MUST. Also par boiled the bok choy. Lots of sauce left over. Will probably use to marinate and as a dipping sauce for grilled chicken (like a satay).

Ths turned out great and the sauce was wonderful! I also used a thin spaghetti and added a red pepper as other reviewers. I may add a bit more peanut butter to the sauce next time, as I love the taste.

This sauce is stellar! So so good. Well worth the effort - I will definitely make this again. I did make some minor adjustments - omitted the baby greens and mint, added some stir fried tofu, sugar snap peas, & red bell pepper. It's a lot of chopping, but then comes together really quick.

Yummers! The citrus/ginger/peanut butter combination of flavors is delicious! Extremely tasty. Makes more dressing than you need but you could reserve some and use it as salad dressing. My modifications: used less crushed red pepper since I can't handle spicy food all that well but like a kick; used 2 T canola oil instead of 1/3 cup; diced 1/2 red pepper and sugar snap peas instead of cucumber; sliced one head of bok choy and parboiled it for 30 seconds; served dish on bed of greens instead of mixing them in (didn't want leftovers to have wilted greens). This can handle more veggies so chop 'em up and toss 'em in!

Super yummy, and oh my gosh, healthy too. Husband made this for me, as is expect for omitting the red pepper for the kids. We added it later to the adults. Even my 2 and four year old ate this. Super refreshing and sprightly.

I thought this dish was a fabulous vegetarian dinner option, and perfect for summer when you don't mind chopping but don't want the stove on for long. I agree with another reviewer that for color purposes, adding in some matchstick slices of red pepper would be a nice touch. For protein I added sauteed cubed tofu. I used about 1/2 the dressing which I thought was more than enough. P.S. I only had almond butter on hand and it worked as a fine substitute

omg! so good! now for the confession: I substituted spaghettini, and I omitted the cilantro. but, it was still so good. it made a ton of dressing and I used a pound of pasta (reading the reviews, i thought I could make the entire box of pasta and was glad that I did). i still had leftover dressing the next day that i marinated with some pork. this dressing has such potential for uses elsewhere. it's so good. just get out your microplane and grate-- it's totally worth it. and as others have mentioned, it was the first thing gone at the bbq i brought it to. totally a keeper!

My husband and I loved this citrus take on soba noodle salad. We got most of our fresh ingredients from the outdoor farmers market including the sweetest oranges. For an alternative to bok choy, we used lightly steamed broccoli and freshly shelled peas. It was great to have these cool green left-overs in this 90 degree heat.

I loved the greens mixed in with the noodles and other crunch vegetables. The dressing was a little out of balance. It was a little too tangy from the lime juice. Next time I would add a little brown sugar to counter balance the lime juice. The dressing for "Super Slaw" on this website would be perfect.

Whoa. That dressing is awesome. I actually did not expect much of this recipe, but it was delish. I added a chopped red pepper to the veggie mix.

Wonderful flavors! I made a stir fry version. Kept close to the recipe and added red peppers and spinach(skipped the cukes). Add the sauce (yum!) after 5 minutes and a little cornstarch. Used rice on hand instead of soba noodles. Next time, I'll toast some chickpeas, fry up tofu, or try the cold version.

My family, including my three-year-old daughter, love this recipe. It can also be made with cashew butter for those with a peanut allergy in the house.

I thought this salad was very good and easy. Used thin spaghetti as I didn't have soba. Increased the ginger. For veg used bok choy and some fresh peas. Certainly would make again.

Very tasty! The dressing was to die for (I actually used my finger to clean the bowl) and the greens give it a healthy, refreshing feel--perfect for summer. I used the soba noodles but any pasta would be fine.

You could do a lot better. I don't think putting it all on salad does much good.

I thought this was good - my husband thought it was great. I liked the dressing but I think it could benefit from a dash of fish sauce, as others have mentioned. I left out the mixed greens because the two heads of baby bok choy resulted in a lot of greens. If I make this again, I will add sauteed extra- firm tofu.

Rating: 3
Don't be afraid of the number of ingredients! Making the dressing means just dumping a bunch of stuff in the blender, so it's not as hard as it looks. I added the fish sauce, as suggested by one of the others. Personally, I found the dish a bit rich, and might scale back on the dressing next time. But the salad was popular at the picnic I brought it to and the leftovers were scarfed up at home.

There seemed to be an excessive amount of dressing. I'll probably up the amount of noodles or veggies or both next time.

Great for summer. I blanched the baby bok choy in the pasta water, which I'd recommend.

Made exactly as written. Very nice! I'd increase the mint and soy by half and may try adding a red bell pepper to the mix next time. The baby bok choy was excellent, but in a pinch, baby spinach would be fine.

I thought this was kind of bland. I followed the recipe except used broccoli instead of bok choy. Other similar recipes seem more flavorful.

I made this just as written with fresh bok choy and mixed greens from the farmer's market. It was delicious and very fresh tasting. Will become a regular in our summer recipe line up. The only thing is that I would say this amount only feeds about 4 or 5 as a main course.

This made a refreshing and delicious meal for a hot summer's evening. I used spaghetti since I didn't have soba noodles on hand, and I found it easier to break the pasta before cooking rather than cutting after cooking. Next time, I will use less garlic in the dressing and only the green parts of the onions, as I found the recipe as written to be a little heavy on the sharp garlic/onion flavor.

Rating: 3
This was tasty and easy to put together (make the dressing ahead of time). When I made the dressing and tasted it, it seemed like it needed something(even after adding some salt and pepper). I added a tablespoon or so of fish sauce which gave it what I was looking for.

made this for a party with my vegetarian friends in mind but it was a big hit with everyone. Not a single bit left. Easy to assemble too.
