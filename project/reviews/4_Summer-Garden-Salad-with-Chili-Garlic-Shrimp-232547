Yes, this has a lot of (easy) steps, but it is so worth it. What a flavorful, interesting and healthy salad! I ate leftovers (without the lettuce) for 2 days afterward and they were even better the 2nd day. If you have a little time, it's well worth the effort.

One of the worst salads I have ever made. Flavors did not meld together and it was an enormous waste of plump, perfect shriimp. 0 forks

This salad was amazing! Ideal dinner for a warm summer evening. I agree with the other reviewers---the dressing needs tweaking. I added 1 tsp. white balsamic vinegar, 1 tsp. honey and a pinch of salt and freshly ground pepper. That made a huge difference. I also blanched the corn, as the recipe indicates, then grilled it for extra flavor. Lastly I added a ripe mango, thinly sliced, to the other veggies. It added some sweetness and is a great compliment to the fresh mint. I admit, I was a little afraid of the chili-garlic sauce but the amount of heat was just right. In fact, I may add another tsp. next time. For a wine pairing, I served a nicely chilled bottle of Macon Villages chardonnay. Superb!

OMG--I came home very late, thawed some shrimp, asked Epicurious what to do with shrimp and lime--this recipe was IT. I made only the shrimp & dressing, served it with (leftover) brown rice and some boxed baby romaine. I used 1/2 the shrimp/marinade mixture for 3 of us, deglazed the pan with the juice from the unused half of the lime, dumped that on the shrimp with the full amount of dressing (only used 1 T olive oil). Again--OMG. Will definitely make it again and again, and I'm sure I'll make the complete recipe sometime soon. BTW-- Sriracha, which is WAAAYY too hot for my family out of the bottle, is perfect in this--just warm enough, and the flavor is nicely evident. Yummmm! : )

This was excellent. I sauteed the corn in the same pan I cooked the shrimp and doubled the marinade as suggested. The dressing was perfect as anything more flavorful would mask the other flavors in the salad. Definitely use mint as it compliments the chili marinade on the shrimp. Will make again!

I agree with others who say the salad dressing is too bland. I jazzed it up with a splash of white balsamic vinegar and some minced garlic. I also used arugula in the salad green mixture. I pretty much doubled the spices in the shrimp coating and used a spicy Indian chili paste instead of the chili garlic sauce. Lastly, I plated the salad first and topped it with the shrimp mixture for a nicer presentation. Next time I might grill the corn for a touch of smokiness. This was a HUGE hit at a dinner party as a first course.

Excellent! The shrimp is tasty and all together makes a wonderful combination! Used 1/2 of chili-garlic sauce since my husband does not like spicy food -- it was still very tasty.

I added one mango as previously suggested and used one small English cucumber. Delicious!

Yumm, Yummm. This is a gorgeous meal worthy salad!! I followed a previous tip and did not boil the corn, but sauteed it in on fairly high heat in the same pan as the shrimp (after I finished cooking and removed them). The asian style dressing seemed to conflict with the otherwise mexican tone of this salad, so I made my own out of sour cream/mayo/ fresh lime juice/garlic and balsamic vinegar. I also added a few crushed corn chips on top. Not necessary, but gave it a nice crunchy touch. I will make this again and again.

A nice light salad with a little kick to it. The dressing is wonderful

I thought this recipe was really tasty and a great refreshing summer salad. I tripled the shrimp marinade and added mango which complemented the salad really well. Next time I will also add a litlle more mint.

This has become a real favourite in our family. I could not find chili garlic sauce, so I substitute a tbsp. of Thai red chili paste and a couple of tbsp of olive oil in the marinade. I let the shrimp sit in the marinade mixture for an hour or so. I also leave out the corn and just serve the marinated/grilled shrimp on a bed of salad greens, avocado, mint leaves and whatever fruit is good - mango or papaya. Then I drizzle the dressing over the whole thing. Easy and delicious.

A great blend of many flavors. I added extra chili-garlic sauce to the shrimp and I too sauted the corn instead of boiling it. Wanted to spice it up a bit, so I added caribbean jerk seasoning to the corn. Just enough kick. I served it with french bread sprinkled with butter, garlic and cheese and broiled in the oven. The avacado was served on the side since 1 guest didn't like avacado. All in all, they loved it.

One of our favorites, we can't get enough of this. Asian but not too exotic, uses fresh ingredients in abundance in August.

I made this as a side-dish for a friend's BBQ and it became the most popular part of the meal! Even the kids were eating it! I followed the advice of cooking the corn with the shrimp (good call) and added more of the spices. In the dressing I added some honey and more garlic-chili paste. DIVINE!! I would make the shrimp sometime as a main course as ALL of us couldn't stop picking at it while the rest of the meal was cooking :) Would probably be AMAZING on the BBQ!

This was great! I upped the chili-garlic sauce a bit and threw in the whole avocado.

This was OK, but nothing special. Actually, I liked the shrimp (I doubled the coating sauce) but thought the dressing was really mediocre. It definitely needed something more.

My husband said this was his favorite salad ever! Cut the corn off and saute with the shrimp, spicier and crisper than boiling (yuck). I made a half batch but kept the same spice amounts so lots of flavor

My mistake forgetting the mint. Even so, I thought this dish needed too much doctoring, even though many people liked it as is. The dressing needed more jazz and there just seemed to be too much liquid.

this was delicious as is, but were i to make it again, i might add vietnamese fish sauce in place of the soy and cilantro in place of the mint. but, as i said, it was delicious in an untampered with version!

A nice, light summer salad. I added a little purple onion and used heirloom tomatoes, but otherwise followed the recipe. Next time I'll try giving the dressing a little more zing, not sure exactly how? The salad has a very nice presentation, looks beautiful with all the colors.

Chili garlic sauce is a pre made sauce that you can get at most high end grocery stores or Asian food markets (I recommend the Thai brands). It is absolutely fantastic stuff and my husband puts it on almost everything....

This salad recipe works because it definitely becomes more than the sum of its parts--I would suggest following the recipe pretty closely. I made it to go along with steaks ( a sort of modified surf & turf) and everyone loved it. It's colorful, flavorful (but not overflavored), & the textures all mix nicely. Worth the effort!

Fantastic! I am not a big fan of mint but decided to make the recipe exactly as is. I am glad I didn't leave it out...gave the salad a special taste and zip.

Great tastes! Garlic chili sauce is a spicy Chinese chili sauce with pickled garlic added. One highly recommended brand, if you can get it, is Lan Chi Chili sauce with Garlic (I use it and I've seen this particular brand mentioned in cookbooks as well).

Sounds Great.....But sorry, I must have missed something - what is chili-garlic sauce?

This is a fantastic summer salad. I add just a tad more chili-garlic sauce to the shrimp but beyond that the recipe is perfect. The flavors are delicate but with just enough kick to make this salad a summer dinner staple.

Excellent recipe! Easy to make in advance and goes well with pasta. The only change I would make is the salad dressing. But the shrimp marinade is fabulous.

Loved this salad, and we are not big shrimp fans. I added mango nectar to the chili-garlic, cumin mix to make a thin paste. I b-b-q'd the corn and then cut it off the ear, I used whole grape tomatoes and added grilled red onion. Tasted like summer!

Wonderful! Used Szechwan chili sce., since that's what we had on hand, and will add a bit more next time to up the smokiness and heat. I also made about 1 1/2 times the dressing. This was quick, fresh, easy, and there wasn't a bit left when dinner was over!
