I hate it when people change a recipe than blame the recipe that they changed. I made this last year and it was good. While cutting the bread a little smaller would probably be a good idea maybe you should keep your bacon to yourself.

There was nothing drastically wrong with this recipe, but it just didn't have that much flavor. I added some chopped Nueske's bacon, and that was really the only flavor that stood out. Overall, I think the recipe is too bland for me.

Would definitely make this recipe again. Might cut the apples and celery into slightly bigger pieces (the apples got a little lost in it). But the rye had such a nice, surprising presence. Of all the things on the table, this is the one people keep mentioning!

This was a great stuffing and complimented the Cider-Glazed Turkey. I followed the recipe in all ways except I cut the bread into smaller cubes and it worked out well. This was from the very last issue of Gourmet - a real shame.

Delicious - I am keen to make this again. The flavours blend well. Next time, though, I'd make the cubes of bread a little smaller - 1/2 to 3/4 inch instead - as the big cubes make a mouthful on their own and you don't get the other flavours as much. Also, I might dry toast the caraway before adding the butter next time - the caraway flavour is good but is not as strong as I'd have expected. But these are merely suggestions to improve - it is lovely as it is.
