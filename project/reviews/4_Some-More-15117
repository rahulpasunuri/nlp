I can't believe that they had to describe how to make these. Nor can I believe that they called then "some more". Maybe that's what they called them in 1927...

S'mores are a tradiiton in my house, and have been since I was a child. We don't wait for camping, either! We have them whenever we want to have quality family time, and no matter the season, we roast marshmallows over fire. This means the grill, fireplace, or even the front burner on our range.

Back to my summer camp days in New Mexico...horses tied up for the night, sleeping bags set out, everyone cold as could be by the camp fire roasting marshmallows for our traditional s'mores! I'll never forget those s'mores!
