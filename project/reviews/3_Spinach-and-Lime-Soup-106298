This soup was wonderful, simple and quick. I used whole grain tortillas. I also added one 15 oz can of black beans, rinsed and drained.

An interesting base but, yes, rather bland on its own. Added 1 T. peanut butter, and the same of creamed coconut, then finished with a good home made garam masala (heavy on the fenugreek).

Although the soup is easy to make, eveyone in my household agreed the lime flavor was overpowering and the texture distasteful. The flavors had mellowed a bit by the next day, but the dish was still only marginally edible.

I just want to send a recipe out there that I just invented. I had to make do with what was in my kitchen-- you've probably been there before! I had chicken broth, leftover roasted chicken breast, lemon, frozen spinach, and 2 eggs. I boiled the broth with shredded chicken and added the juice of 2 lemons. (I used about 6 cups of broth with the meat of 2 small chicken breasts) I simmered it until the chicken was nice and tender. Then, I added the thawed, drained frozen spinach. I let water come back to a near-boil; then I added two scrambled eggs that had been tempered with 1/2 cup of hot broth. It was delicious!!!! Just an idea for a busy night.

Decent is all I can say for this soup, neither spectacular or awful. Although tortilla strips were nice to snack on. It just didn't have enough flavor

I love this soup and have made it many times. Sometimes I skip the tortillas and just add cheese to it. Delicious and easy!

This soup is wonderful! I make it very often. It is definitely better the second day. It is very soothing on a cold day too. I have passed this recipe on to very many people who also love it.

Loved this, with some adjustments. I added much more lime juice than was called for and threw in some lentils, too.

Sorry, I thought this was a really boring soup. I love all the ingredients, but this was dull.

Very tasty and very simple to prepare. A special dish. I blend the soup to a smooth consistency with a hand blender, and skip the chips.

Perhaps the flavour combination isn't to everyone's taste... but I just served this soup at a dinner for a friend, and she immediately asked for the recipe. I did add about twice as much lime juice and coriander as was called for, though.

Nope. Not very good at all. Don't bother...

I made this because the ingredients sounded so good. I ate it, but my husband took two bites and made a frozen burrito. But even if I were cooking for myself, I don't think I would make it again.

This was an outstanding hit at a dinner party we hosted this past Sunday. Personally, the cayenne was the perfect ingredient for my cold. Everyone remarked at how tasty and healthy this side dish was -- a rare combination for the crowd I was hosting.
