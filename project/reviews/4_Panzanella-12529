Toasting the bread gives this salad a lovely warm note - a perfect balance for the bright basil and acid of the tomatoes. I'm shocked that anyone has leftovers of this dish - My kids will sit around the table until the last morsel is gone!

This is a fantastic panzanella recipe, especially with summer tomatoes. Just be sure to have a crowd on hand to eat all that it makes! Next time I'll be reducing the recipe by a third to a more manageable size for 2 people!

Um, hello, toast the bread and then mix it up and let it sit with wet stuff for 40 minutes? That was a bad idea. Panzanella should feature toasted bread, mixed in at the last minute. Don't think I'll try this version again.

I used some leftover ciabatta (actually 2 days old) and added some capers for a little extra bite. Also used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar. I let it sit for about 40 minutes before serving to let the flavors blend and bread soften a bit. It would've been too dry if the bread was toasted.

Made this for dinner with homegrown tomatoes, and Nicoise olives. It was absolutely delicious. I'll be making this all summer long!

This is a fantastic recipe I have made over and over. I lightly brown the onions and the bread on the stove top with some of the olive oil, salt and pepper before tossing it with all the ingredients. The onions get sweet and the bread holds its shape after soaking up all the oh-so-good dressing. Have also added in whatever salad greens are in the fridge and sweet bell peppers that needed to be used up. Gets rave reviews every time.

Delicious! So light and refreshing for a late summer evening. Great use of day old La Brea bakery bread. Added shallots, ricotta salata cheese, hard boiled eggs and parsely and did without the cukes. A great base recipe that can be modified to what's on hand. I agree with the comment that the bread shouldn't be toasted and should be allowed to soak up the olive oil. Yum!

I used fresh, ripe, organic & locally grown heirloom tomatoes, and oh man. It smelled and tasted amazing. I also added 1 clove of garlic. Next time I will probably use a little less onion, just enough to add flavor and some crunch. 1/2 cup was was a bit overpowering and we left most of it on our plates. And I'll chop it rather than slice it. If you don't plan to eat it all right away, mix everything together except the bread. Store the cubed bread in a separate container and mix the desired amount into the salad just before eating.

I made this for a baby shower and everybody really enjoyed it. My mom even requested the recipe which is always a sign that it turned out well. I subbed balsamic vinegar for the red wine vinegar since I didn't have any on hand and sprinkled some Parmesan over the salad. Pretty simple to make and was perfect for a summer lunch.

This is exactly what I mean for panzanella! I usually soak the onion in a mix of water and vinegar before adding it to the bread and other ingredients. It makes it softer and a little more delicate in taste.

What a nice way to use tomatoes, basil, and cukes from the garden. I had some sourdough in the freezer so used that. This is almost a whole meal. Hubby loved it and it will be a summer staple.

YUM! YUM! YUM! Instead of balsamic I used champagne vinegar for a lighter, less tart taste and combined it with a clove of crushed garlic. I also added sliced yellow, red, and orange bell peppers. Nice light healthy dinner!

great basic recipe, but it needs something extra. I added some crumbled feta and it added a lot more flavor.

The nice thing about this recipe is it's versatility. You can add or delete ingredients as you wish. Personally, I prefer to use chiabatta bread, lightly toasted, rubbed with a fresh garlic clove and brushed liberally with extra-virgin olive oil. I also like to use a combinatin of tomatoes..heirloom, yellow, grape, cherry..whatever looks freshest at my local farmers market. If I have artichoke hearts on hand, or olives from my favorite gourmet market I throw those in. I like to use a little garlic red- wine vinegar along with balsamic. I often make this a dinner salad by adding a good quality Genoa salami and tiny balls of mozzerella cheese or shaved parmesan.

I actually learned to make panzanella in Italy, with a recipe very similar to this. I feel compelled to comment, though, that what makes panzanella so special is that the bread is soft and the olive oil kind of permeates the dough. When I made it in Italy, we worked the olive oil into the soft bread cubes with our hands before adding the other ingredients. So I think that toasting the bread cubes into crouton-like form is missing the point.

This was delicious!!! I used balsamic vinegar, as others suggested. I omitted the cuc, toasted the bread with some fresh garlic and olive oil. i added some chopped provolone cheese! YUMMMMM

I toasted the bread with garlic-flavored olive oil to make croutons instead of just mixing the plain bread into the salad. It was excellent and I will be making this again.

I made this with fresh bread, which i toasted and then rubbed with a cut piece of garlic - that gave it just enough garlic flavor. I also used balsamic instead of red wine vinegar, and I topped it with crumbled goat cheese, fresh ground pepper and kosher salt. Oh - and i heated the tomatoes for about 5 mins on the stovetop with the olive oil. Too delish!

This recipe has "KEEPER" written all over it. The simple dressing will knock your socks off! I preferred my bread tossed with olive oil, minced garlic, and salt & pepper, then toasted in the oven. Even better the next day. It's a meal in itself, and a healthy one at that! Don't pass this one up!

Excellent. Omitted cukes, but added crushed garlic, buffalo mozzarella and Nicoise olives. Served on a bed of baby arugula on a majolica platter-beautiful and enthusiastically consumed by neighbors.

Delightful! I toasted the bread cubes, minced the onions, and added 2 minced cloves of garlic, 2 mashed up anchovies, cubes of mozzarella di bufalo, and a very generous sprinkling of fleur de sel. I served it at a wine tasting party last night, and it was gobbled up!

This bruschetta-turned-colorful-salad rates 3.5 forks. Fresh basil, freshly ground pepper, ground sea salt, and high-quality olive oil make this dish addictive! Next time, I will reduce the amount of bread somewhat.

What an awsome recipe. For such a simple one it sure packs a punch. I am 14 and new to the cooking world and even I could make it. My brother is very picky and doesn't like day old or moist bread so I took the peasent bread a made croutons out of it and put it together last minute!

This is the perfect August bounty salad recipe. Everyone always loves it. I have also added tuna with great results.

Delicious and different. This must be made with all fresh ingredients! I added salt and minced garlic to the dressing before tossing. I also used more basil then suggested and added fresh parsley, mint and Mozzarella. Olives would be a great addition.

This was so tasty. Friends actually took leftovers home. Since it's the winter I didn't have a great selection of tomatoes. I used cherry tomatoes, cut them in half and added sea salt to draw out the flavor. The sea salt gave it a very nice edge.

We loved it at home and also at the potluck at work. Didn't have red wine vinegar so I substituted balsamic - yumm!

I just made this, I haven't even served it yet but I can tell it's a winner. I had this type of salad at David Wood Foods here in Toronto years ago. After he closed I tried a number of recipes with no luck. I'd forgotten about it until I stumbled on this recipe. After reading the raves I had to try it. Well, it's right on. I used parsley i/o basil because David did and I love the parsley/cuke/tomato combination (kind of like tabouleh). Also added garlic. It tastes great now but I know David's just got better. I used to buy it towards the end of the day because the bread soaked up the tomato juices and oil and YUM. Make this before you start the rest of dinner and let it sit. I promise I'll try it with basil next.

This is the best salad I have ever made. Everyone loves it and requests it at every dinner party, no matter what else I'm serving. You might try grilling the bread as well, with adds a nice flavor.

I made this as dinner yesterday because it was 90 degrees and humid. I just bought a crusty baguette from the store. I cut it into chunks and sprayed the crusty bits with a little water, because I used storebought tomatoes that were ripe but not very juicy. I also added some assorted olives from the deli, and used the olive juices and balsamic vinegar in the dressing. Made a big bowl of it, and the two of us polished it off in no time. Definitely a good place to use random bits of stuff - sundried tomatoes, roasted peppers, mozzarella balls.

This is a good start on traditional panzanella, but check out Marcella Hazan's recipe for the BEST version that you'll find. Garlic and salt are an absolute must...and you might even consider adding a touch of anchovy, instead of the salt, for an extra dimension. A terrific summer first course, especially for patio/deck/potluck entertaining!

This was fabulous and will now enter the high recipe rotation at my house. I made a few changes. I skipped the cucumbers (don't like 'em) and added hardboiled eggs (2-3 work nicely), 2 cloves of minced garlic and some capers. I was too impatient to try this to wait for my bread to get stale so I toasted it and it worked fine, I also used a bit more olive oil and used balsamic instead of red wine vinegar. What a fantastic dish! Great leftovers too, we had it as a side dish with pasta the next night and packed it in our lunches as well. PLUS, my 8 year old loved it, that's as good as it gets.

Around our house we love grilled red peppers, squash and/or zuchinni. When I have leftovers (of couse kept cold in fridge) I love to add any combination of them in my panzanella along with the tomotoes, bread, etc.

This recipe was sooooo yummy and easy to prepare. I ate the leftovers the next day for lunch and it was even better then. I forwarded this recipe on to a colleague of mine.

I love this recipe! Not that it is the "classic" Italian panzanella, which has no cucumber and is made with a particular Tuscan Italian Bread that is first soaked with water. Still, I adore this recipe. I've been enjoying it almost every day. I too substitute good balsalmic vinegar for the wine vinegar. I use a fresh baguette for the bread. In addition, I've taken to adding 1/2 pound of mozzerella chopped into bite-sized bits - preferably buffalo milk mozzerella, and when I'm feeling especially happy, I use 1/4 cup virgin olive oil and 1/4 cup white truffle oil to 2 tablespoons great balsamic vinegar. This is heaven:-)

I only wish I had found this recipe years ago. It has become one of my favorites. ...BUT IT NEEDS...1 clove of garlic... mashed with 1/2-1 teas. Kosher salt...then it really comes alive! The perfect summer solution for using up that leftover/day-old French or Italian bread.

Loved it and have been trying to find the receipe for it since I was in Italy. If I had my way, I would make it every night. It is also good as a soup in winter, made with the tomatoes cooked and then poured over the bread along with parmesan cheese. Wonderful food!

Very good recipe and quite true to authentic; however, I use more tomato, no cucumber, and I also add freshly grated Parmesano-Reggiano cheese...and add chopped hearts of romaine lettuce. I know it sounds like a substantial variation, but it really isn't. True Panzanella is for using the bounty of summer tomatoes and day-old bread. Extra-virgin olive oil and good red wine vinegar make a big difference, too.

Found it!! Thank you. Years ago, when my husband was a Marine, a young lady from that wonderful country introduced me to this salad. I loved it then and now. I now raise a big garden and I see those hot summer nights, enjoying this wonderful dish. Try it you'll like it!

This was a delicious and different salad. It was easy to make and used up half a loaf of some day old crusty french bread.
