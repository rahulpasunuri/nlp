These were tasty and looked great on my cookie platter. I used other reviewers suggestion of adding a couple extra tablespoons of butter to make the dough a little easier to handle. In the end they were beautiful but I can certainly see how this dough could be a bit tricky right out of the fridge. It helps to let them warm up before attempting to roll. Even the cracks in the dough were easily smoothed out on the baking sheet.

This is one the favorite cookies at our house and is very yummy! I make the recipe as written, except our resident cookie monster doesn't like walnuts. So I leave them out. Have never had a problem with the dough being too dry. I do slice them more thinly sometimes though. They are very pretty and a lot of fun to make.

My family loves these cookies! I have made them several times and have always had many compliments. They are relatively easy to make yet have such a festive look about them. It is one of the first cookies I go to when I have to make cookies.

Dough was too stiff first time around - I reduced the flour to start to 1-1/2 cups and added a little more when forming ball.

I followed another reviewers suggestion and added an extra 1/4 cup of butter when I was making the cokies. The dough wasn't to dry and I liked the end result.

I agree with the previous reviewers, I made recipe as is and the dough for these cookies was too dry. I have a similar shortbread type dough recipe that calls for double the butter in this recipe for the same amount of flour. I will make this recipe again, but I would try it with at least another 1/4 cup of butter, and maybe unsweetened coconut to make it a little less sweet. And these cookies don't flatten out at all when they're baked, I'd slice them 1/4 inch thick instead of 1/2.

There is a MUCH better cookie recipe on this web site -- Oatmeal Coconut Raspberry Bars -- that has the same flavor and is easier to bake and serve. Try that recipe instead to save time and aggravation.

These cookies were a bust--literally. The dough seemed suspiciously dry from the get-go, and when I tried to roll it, it just crumbled to pieces. With nothing else for my Valentine :8(, I shoveled up the pieces, placed them in a baking dish, baked for 20 minutes at 375. It came out very tasty, if not very presentable--but this is SWEET. Whipped cream helped cut the sugar.
