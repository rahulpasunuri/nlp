This was pretty gross and flavorless. It sounded delicious and had all ingredients that I liked but it was very bland. I would make a peanut sauce to put on it instead. Also, it was even worse the second day. It's a lot of work for nothing.

We've made this dish twice. The first time, I thought it was quite bland. I understand that rice noodle prepared like this should be light and spare, but I think they were too devoid of flavor and spice. The second time we jazzed it up by doubling the herbs and adding a lot of our own spices--a lot of flaked red chile, and some nice slightly flavored soy sauce, which made ALL the difference. It's a lot better now, but I'm still not crazy about it.

There was definitely something lacking in this dish. The fresh herbs are absolutely a must, because they, along with the marinated onions, are the primary source of flavor in the dish. I was expecting something with more of a sauce--this is basically just plain noodles with a few fresh ingredients thrown in. My boyfriend liked it, however, and it is a very light dish, if you're looking for that. I needed more integrated flavors.

I used prepared vermicelli for the noodles. Marinating the red onion really mellows the flavor. This is a great side dish for an Asian summer meal.

I have been making this dish since it was first published in BA in 1996--seven years! This is a wonderfully fresh, light noodle salad that has great flavor. The onions can be left out with more green onions added for a milder flavor.

This was a nice complement with the chicken breasts with curry, my husband and I loved all the fresh flavors it had to offer.

Takes a bit of work. I combined this and the two pepper shrimp in the same menu (without the lettuce/radish bed of the two-pepper shrimp, but putting it on these noodles instead). Fabulous.

Excellent compliment to Thai-spiced Pork Tenderloin with Orange Curry Sauce. April 1996

This recipe was terrible. The lime was overpowering and the flavors did not meld at all. It looks nice if you want a centerpiece - but don't eat it!

A great and quick dish, and great cold as leftovers. I added a bit of fish sauce to the lime dressing as suggested by others, as well as some diced jalapeno--and kept all the vinegar/onion liquid. I wondered whether some chili sauce might give it even more spice--will try that next time.

This is a fabulous recipe. I rated this a 4 because I added a soy honey sauce that I passed around at the table. It needed a little kick. This dish went very well with salmon baked in the soy honey sauce.

Great recipe and super easy. I added sauteed shrimp and fish sauce too and it tasted great. My only complaint is that it ends up too dry so next time I'll add more liquid.

I added sauted prawns and used all of the onion marinade.....I liked it, but expected a bit more intensity of flavors. I would probably add some fish sauce next time.....I'll bet a diced fresh jalapeno would give it some kick!

Excellent flavours....but maybe a little too much cilantro for my liking. I also sauteed some shrimp with garlic and ginger. The presentation was beautiful--instead of mixing everything together, I placed the shrimp, vegtables (I subbed snow peas and carrots) and the noddle salad seperately on the plate. My boyfriend was beyond impressed!

This was great! I rolled up the salad in rice paper rolls and served with hoisin sauce - quick, easy, and delicious!

yummy! i would be a little more generous with the lime and the red pepper, and a little less generous with the green onion. this is a great summer dish - cool and light but flavorful and tart.

This dish was fantastic! I added about 3/4 lb. of shrimp which I had halved lenghtwise and boiled before adding to the dish. I also added about 2 tablespoons or so of fish sauce which really gave it a great asian flavor. This is also wonderful as a leftover cold dish. Very refreshing!!

This recipe has become one of my children's favorites. It goes very nicely with the Taste of Thai's Spicy Peanut Bake.

I loved this dish. It's got a very light, clean flavor to it. I started eating vegetarian 6 months ago and I think this makes my top 3 out of the many new dishes I'm now eating.

We loved this light and tasty dish. Next time I'll add a little more peanuts :-)
