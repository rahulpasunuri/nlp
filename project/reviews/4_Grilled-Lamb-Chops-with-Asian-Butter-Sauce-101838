This recipe provided a great marinade formula for the lamb chops. However, I wouldn't make the Asian butter sauce next time b/c it was an odd taste combination for me.

I made this with a rack of lamb and my 8 year old daughter said it was the best thing she ever ate. I generally don't like 5 spice powder but it was pefect here. I had to swat my husbands hand when he tried to lick the plate. I had to be carefull grilling due to the honey, but they turned out perfect.

This was fabulous and I thought very easy. Our side dish was Basmati Rice with Raisins, Nuts and Peas, Sept, 1995 but left out the peas, almonds and raisins and substituted fresh mango and roasted cashews.

This recipe is so worth making it exactly as written. I served it to Asian guests and nothing was left over. Definitely a keeper!

This is amazing. I've made it several times now, always for special occasions. I usually use chops but have also done it with a leg of lamb on the grill which also came out great (although chops are easier). And please make the sauce, it's fantastic.

Pure deliciousness! I used a leg cut instead, it's a truly versatile marinade/sauce combo.

Excellent recipe. I have been making this recipe for almost 3 years. In the past, I was using about 1/2 of the butter for the sauce, but this time I decided to try it "as is", that means, with all the butter, what a difference!!! The sauce is very really rich and creamy when you use all the butter. Yes, it is a lot of butter but,,,you won't be eating it all the time.

I just made this over the weekend and it was fabulous! I didn't have cognac or brandy, so I used white wine. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. The marinade was flavorful and the lamb chops came out very juicy! I never cooked with oyster sauce before and I was hesitant to pour the butter sauce all over the chops after we grilled them, but the sauce was amazing and just made the already wonderful chops taste even better! Try this!

I bought very good lamb but marinated it as directed. The chops were perfect, delicious. I did finish them in the oven after the outside started to char and used a thermometer. I thought the sauce was a big nothing and the butter unnecessary. I'd do the chops the same way again though.

I pureed the marinade ingredients and spread the resulting "paste" over 1" thick lamb chops and marinated them for the day. The grilled chops were delicious and the flavors were not overpowering. For the sauce, I substituted vegetable broth and reduced the butter by half and it was very tasty. I served this with grilled asparagus. I'm going to try the marinade with a pork tenderloin next time.

This is my husband's new favorite. I don't care for lamb, but I love this recipe. Every person I made this dish for asks for the recipe so that they can impress their friends. Highly recommended.

Even people who don't like lamb have devoured these chops! They are especially good served with the suggested apricot/cashew/basil rice.

This was an amazing dish! The mariande was flavorful without overpowering the lamb - perfect for early spring Sunday dinner. Even my children (8 & 11 yrs.) loved it and asked for seconds! I substituted a boneless leg of lamb (remove all the fat!) and served it with grilled asparagus and a dry white wine.

loved this recipe! so easy to make. i'm sure the longer you marinate the better -- i marinated for a full 24 hours. the meat was infused but not overwhelmed with the marinade. AND the carmalized crusty outside once grilled was the perfect match for the juicey tender inside. i improvised a jasmine rice pilaf with fresh basil, mangoes and scallions which went perfectly. and i roasted apsaragus with garlic and an olive oil/sesame oil mixture. everyone raved including myself. highly recommend.

Wonderful! Used less butter, as suggested, and served it with an Asian pear and kiwi salsa, also on Epicurious, which was a great combonition.

I have made this recipe several times and have found a variation we love even more. We replaced the honey with some toasted sesame oil and used rosemary instead of the cilantro. It was served to rave reviews!!

Rating: 4
Amazing! I've made this dish over and over again. The Asian-butter sauce is a great compliment to the lamb and marinade. I don't use quite as much honey as the recipe calls for, and add a bit of freshly grated ginger to the marinade. I also liked serving it along with the mango/basil basmati they suggested. This dish will impress!

Kudos to Epicurious for one of the very few dishes that actually deserve the "Asian" label.

I made this at one time and thought it was "the best." We don't even like lamb and this was fabulous! I couldn't wait to make it again and it was another hit! The sauce is most delicious and I used a well trimmed rack of lamb. This past time I made it with 5 racks of lamb--wonderful.

The flavours blended very well and complemented the lamb nicely. I gave it a one fork because it was far toooooooo sweet for my liking. I guess I just prefer lamb done with garlic,lemon juice, olive oil and rosemary. Glad I tried it though!

In a word, suberb. I didn't think that the marinade overpowered the flavor of the lamb as others have compained. Sauce was surprisingly resilient despite the amount of butter (sauce didn't break even after making it ahead and re-heating.) Served along side grilled vegetables... great combination. Will make again, for sure!

What an incredibly easy recipe for something so incredibly delicious. An almost no-miss recipe. Definitely fitting for a weeknight dinner that tastes like a special weekend entree! Would suggest an accompniment of fresh sliced tomatoes sprinkled with a bit of oregano & perhaps a nice pinot noir.

I tried this dish because it was the first I had seen on this site that rated 4 forks from everyone. I'm sorry to be the party pooper but it just did not impress us. The lamb was marinated 24 hours as instructed and the marinade flavor completely overwhelmed the lamb. Not overly crazy about the sauce either. Try this - an early 90's recipe from Martha Stewart: Trim a rack VERY well, rub room temp lamb with a paste made of crushed garlic, cracked black pepper, olive oil. Sear in a hot skillet being careful not to crack the crust. Finish in a 500 degree oven for about 5 minutes for medium rare. We have made this repeatedly over the past ten years and IT ALWAYS gets rave reviews even with ordinary supermarket lamb. New Years Eve 2000, when I made it with lamb from the market with the ungodly prices, it was out of this world.

Delicious! I marinated this and intended to serve the next evening. Our plans changed so it marinated two days instead of one. It was delicious. My husband and I practically licked our plates clean. This will become a staple in our repertoire!

Wonderful taste! A big hit with at our large family party. We realized, 2 weeks after the party, that we didn't even make the butter sauce to serve over the chops! Obviously we didn't even miss it -- the marinade (overnight) was that good. We served this simply with saffron rice and blanched green beans.

Fabulous flavors, very easy to make. I only used 2 Tbs of butter, and used cabernet sauvignon (instead of the brandy)for the marinade, but the flavors were still wonderful! Everyone loved it. I served honey mango chutney mixed into a vegetable risotto for a nice complimentary side dish.

Rating: 4
Exquisito & delicioso...and really easy to make. I also cut the amount of butter on the sauce and it was still great, only used 2.5 tablespoons butter and wine instead of brandy. Next time I'll try the brandy or cognac. My husband is already asking when are we having them again, and I used the oven, just used a roasting pan with a rack. This one goes to my recipe files for the years to come until I can make it without thinking!

One word, FABULOUS! We used this recipe for company and it was a huge success. We also cut the butter in half (and probably will cut it more next time) and the sauce was still superb. The rice mango combo was terrific too! I finished the dinner off with a simple raspberry brulee'.

I used dried cilantro & shaoshing wine in the marinade, halving the marinade and the sauce and using it on 2 shoulder chops, which I then sauteed quickly in olive oil. I made the sauce as specified, except I mixed in the remains of the marinade and added a little chilli sauce, lemon juice, and brown sugar to taste. I only used 1/8 of the butter called for, and it was still great. A really tasty and different lamb chop dish. Addendum: I've since used just the marinade on a boneless New York steak, broiled till rare, and it was amazing--excellent flavor, and the sauce became completely unnecessary. I will make this again and again.

WONDERFUL!!!!!!! Flavors were all perfectly balanced and complimented the lamb beautifully. We will make this again! Another reviewer's suggestion about cashew, mango, & basil basmati rice was excellent - we made that and the asparagus. They were perfect accompaniments.

My husband and I made this rack of lamb for Valentines Day and FELL IN LOVE! The sauce was as delicious as it was unique. We served the lamb with a cashew, basil, mango, coconut milk rice (out of this world) and asparagus with garlic and ginger (see receipe file). It was a fantastic meal for a fantastic evening. The best lamb we've ever made. We highly recommend this dish to everyone.

Excellent! Now that I have tried this I'm planning on serving it to our gourmet group next month. Substitutions: I used 1/2 the quantity of butter and used 'reduced fat' - it was still excellent. I served the lamb chops with a honey/dijon whipped sweet potato (Cooking Light) and Endive & Pear Salad w/Gorgonzola Cream Dressing, BA 5/99. Everything went very well together.
