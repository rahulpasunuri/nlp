This is my absolute go to recipe for baked potatoes now. I would not bake potatoes any other way.

I have been trying to figure out a healthy way to get the salt to stick. In the past, I used bacon grease. I feel much better with this method. It makes a terrific baked potato.

I always wondered how to make a salt baked potatoe like I find in restaurants. This is simple and works well leaving a slightly crisp salted skin on the potatoe.
