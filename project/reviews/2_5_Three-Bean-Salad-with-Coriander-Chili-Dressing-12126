I made this w/ canned & rinsed black beans and yellow corn, diced fresh red peppers, half of a fresh jalapeno, and added a tiny bit of sugar, and it was just lovely.

This was a great, quick dish to bring to a get-together. I loved the dressing, but I botched the black and white beans. Instead, I used 1lb canned chickpeas with the green beans, and added diced orange bell pepper and pimentos for color. Added plenty of salt too- great summer side-dish!

I whole heartedly disagree with the previous comment. This was an excellent bean salad. The only changes I made is that I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and I added salt (it needs it). Other than that, I followed the recipe to a tee and loved it! I'm not normally a lover of bean sald, but this one was great!

THIS SALAD HAS ABSOLUTELY NO CHARACTER! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.I COULD TELL YOU HOW TO FIX IT BUT I WOULD HAVE TO START ALL OVER! DD
