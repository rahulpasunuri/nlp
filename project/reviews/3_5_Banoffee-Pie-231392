This is a great recipe, but it is so much easier to cook the milk using a double boiler. When you bake, it tends to come out unevenly cooked from the top down. I also use a graham cracker crust instead.

Having been introduced to Banoffee Pie while in London following my friend's funeral, I was instantly in LOVE! We had it 3 more times before we came home, and then I searched high and low for a recipe. Having found this one, I have made it many times. We love it!!! It is sweet, so drink some black coffee with it.

Courtesy of my sis-in-law: An easier and tested way of making toffee - just put the condensed milk cans (remove paper label) in pot of water and boil for upto 2 - 21/2 hours - your toffee will come out perfect.

Rating: 0
Important note on how to make the toffee: Fill the base pan of a double boiler (or a medium saucepan) halfway with water. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to medium for an active simmer (just shy of a boil). Pour the sweetened condensed milk into the double boilers top insert (or into a stainless-steel bowl that fits snugly on top of the saucepan) and set over the simmering water. Every 45 min., check the water level in the pot and give the milk a stir. Replenish with more hot water as needed. Once the milk has thickened to the consistency of pudding and has turned a rich, dark caramel color, 2-1/2 to 3 hours, remove from the heat, cool, and cover.

This recipe is more sweet than it should be. First, I suggest a graham cracker pie crust. Once the condensed milk has turned to toffee, spread immediately on the pie crust because it is rather thick. Refrigerate until ready to assemble as it is best if eaten right after assembling. Next cut the bananas lengthwise and layers the crescents in the pie shell, you may need to cut a couple in half to fit nicely. Prepare the whipping cream without the brown suger, but use a couple tablespoons of white sugar or confectioners sugar and add a splash of vanilla. Dollop (with a large spoon) the whipped cream over the bananas making nice little peaks and round shapes. Last, sprinkle instant coffee granules on the top of the cream, very lightly and grind it up really fine first. You just want a very subtle coffee taste, barely there and the granules are really strong. That's it! If you make a few minor changes, this is an incredible desert!

This was a hit with my guests. I don't like to make dough, so I made a crust with shortbread cookies (couldn't find the digestive cookies).

I come from a British family, and, according to my understanding, there are a few things wrong with this Banoffee Pie recipe. This is absolutely one of my favorite desserts in the whole world (after trifle, of course!) ~~First of all, turning the condensed milk into toffee is way easier than this recipe suggests! All you have to do is put the can straight into a pot of water and bring it to a very gentle simmer. Let it simmer for about 3-4 hours and you will have toffee in a can. Just keep an eye on it to make sure the water doesn't all simmer away. It keeps for quite a while like that, too. ~~Next, you only need one can of toffee per pie. ~~I personally prefer this pie in a graham cracker crust. Easy to make and not too sweet. ~~Finally, to cut down on sweetness and to add a new element to this pie, try making coffee-flavored whipped cream with little to no sweetener in it. All you have to do for this is add some instant coffee to the whipping cream while it is still in its liquid state. Let it sit for a few minutes for the coffee crystals to melt, then whip it as normal. It works great and is absolutely delicious!

I gave this a 1 fork rating based on personal taste. This dessert is sickeningly sweet. So much so that after eating a few bites I got ill. As I love both toffee and bananas I think that I may give this recipe another try but this time use only 1 can of condensed milk, wait for it to cool, and then fold in unsweetened whipped cream.

Rating: 0
just to add my own quirky thought. I have yet to try this version of the pie, however, I will say that i've had it served without the bananas cut on the top. instead the banana can be left whole, or in larger pieces in the pie crust, just place the banana's in the pie in half moons/circular pattern. Add some pecans to cut down on the sweet, then pour the gooy filling over the banana's and pecans. When slice through the banana looks great from a side view. Add your cream at the very last minute. Perfect presentation for a very sugary treat!

Easy, but the culinary equivalent of a twinkie. Sweet, lots of empty calories and sticky. The bananas are nice, but it's really nothing to get excited about.

Rating: 3
Delicious, simple and a big hit every time I've made it. Two suggestions: First, definitely use digestive biscuits in the crust (McVitey's brand is good, becoming more widely available in US supermarkets). It adds a nice flavor and texture. Second, try the whipped cream without sugar. The bananas, crust, and toffee are VERY sweet, and plan whipped cream cuts the sugar nicely with a pure creamy taste.

Banoffee pie is a long-standing family favourite, and gives my British husband a taste of home now and again. We always just boil the cans, and 2 hours on slow simmer is enough. Let them cool before opening. Putting a sheet of tin foil under cans pevents them from staining your pot bottom. Just make sure the cans aren't dented and the water level is always over the cans. We use a cookie crumb crust, so it doesn't get soggy the next day. you don't need to add any sugar to the whipped cream, as the toffee and bananas are more than sweet enough.

sorry - 397g = 15 oz - so if one uses 1 14 oz can Eagle Brand sweetened condensed that should be close enough

OK, I gave it 4 forks even tho it uses a regular pie crust which is so UNauthentic! We can get digestive biscuits now in the regular supermarket here in Pittsburgh (not all stores, of course) and they make it better. BUT here's the Banofee Pie revolution - I just came back from the UK where I stayed with friends & made Banoffee Pie using the recipe on the back of the can of Carnation condensed milk purchased there - it now totally skips the whole cooking forever thing and instead says: 4 oz butter 4 oz dark brown sugar cook over low, stirring till sugar dissolves - add 1 can (397gE) CArnation condensed milk & cook slowly stirring till it boils. This takes MINUTES, not hours, and was very good. Brits also use a Cadburey candy bar called Flake which - if you can find it - you just crumble over the top. canestive biscui ts

I rate this recipe four forks because the result, when compared with the effort involved, is beyond compare. I've been making this pie for many years, and it's always a winner. People love it. I am not fond of banana pies, but this is definitely a winner! You'll have to look far and wide to find another dessert with so much crowd appeal for such a little fuss!

I made the toffee exactly as per instructions and it came out perfect. I made my own pie crust by crushing plain butter biscuits and whole, unsalted hazelnuts, then mixing in melted butter and refridgerating for at least an hour before adding the filling. Must admit the end result was a bit mushy when serving, but it tasted fantastic and very rich. My boyfriend is English, so he absolutely loved it, will definitely be making this again.

Rating: 3
This recipe was good. I made a few additions: I sauteed the bananas in butter and added rum, brown sugar and vanilla until they were soft before adding to the pie and also added a layer of banana pudding to enhance the flavor. I know they recommend baking the toffee out of the can, but I just boiled the sweetened condensed milk in the cans for 3 hours over medium heat and the taste was phenomenal!

I have made this twice in the last week. It is very sweet, but wonderful. I have a 10 inch deep dish pie plate, so I increased the ingredients. About 2 1/2 cans milk, 4 bananas and 2 cups cream. baked the I used a pastry brush to apply some beaten egg white to the pie crust when it was hot (a la Rose Levy Birnbaum). This moisture proofs the shell without adding the sweetness of chocolate. Yum!

This is a fabulous recipe, I've made it twice now using the boil in can method watched vigilantly. 2 and 1/2hrs of boiling time produces a nice golden caramel. I use Carr's HobNobs with butter and healthy pinch of sea salt for the crust, utterly divine.

Banoffee is a favorite in both Britan and Ireland. The crust in the original recipe is made out of digestive biscuits. I did not have any on hand so I prepared a graham cracker crust (an oreo crust may be my next experiment) as I did not like the idea of using regular pie dough. The pie turned out great and the teens I am working with on the Ulster Project loved it!

Hmmm love all the components, but it didn't quite work for me-I think this was my fault, though, so will try it again. I cooked the milk for 2 hours in boiling water (fully submerged, of course!) and then cooked it awhile longer on low in the microwave, stirring every 2 minutes. Overcooked it, I think, so the flavor was wonderful but it was reallllly chewy and made the pie impossible to cut without complete destruction.E

I've made Banoffee pie dozens of times - from Jamie Oliver's cookbook. Condensed milk boiled in the can is no problem, and I usually do two batches as the cans have been keeping for months. Just keep the cans covered in boiling water. I spread a thin layer of toffee on top of a thin short-bread crust - so its crunchy, and the one thing that makes this desert fantastic is sugared nuts on top. I use peacans, washed with water, then tossed with about a 1/2 cup of icing sugar, then bake in the toaster over - watch it, since it will burn if left. I don't put any sugar in the whipped cream, but have been known to add a bit of Kahlua. Once I added a tbspn of Turtle Hot Chocolate mix - that was probably the best yet. The nuts, and crumbly icing sugar bits on top make this truly fabulous.

I also had a curdling problem, but once the pie was assembled, you couldn't tell much. It was mind-numbingly sweet(though yummy) even after I added almost no sugar to the whipped cream. To give the dish a more finished appearance, I sifted about an eighth of a teaspoon of instant espresso powder onto the cream. Loved how it looked.

Made this tonight to rave reviews used slivered almonds toasted in butter as a garnish which really worked well. I only put about 2/3 of the toffee filling called for into the pie shell, extra bananas, and whipped cream with just a touch of sugar so it wasn't overpowering in it's sweetness. I will definitelymake this again!

Thanks for writing us a novel, Nashville. Cool down before you too explode. Safety issues aside, how can toffee, bananas and whipped cream be anything BUT goodness? And Edmonton, if someone rates a recipe without trying it first, does it really keep you up at night?

to:A Cook from Edmonton, Alberta; I am NOT rating the recipe, just commenting on the method. There is no other place to do this that I can find. I have used the simmering pot to carmalize SCM for many years with no 'blow-ups' as a prior poster noted the trick is to 'simmer, not BOIL!! The producers of the milk have to put the warning disclaimer on the can to ward off 'frivolous' law suits by careless people.. ALSO: the statement says 'Potential danger'; Any cook knows that there is Potential danger in sitting a skillet of grease on a hot burner or open gas flame to fry-IF the cook isn't diligent... Boiling an egg can be 'potentially' dangerous-IF you put an egg in a small bit of water and go away and leave it--the Egg will explode and make quite a mess, similar to what would happen if you put an egg in the micro-wave without piercing.. The 'catch word' here is potential and the answer is "Common Sense" which most GOOD cooks have... just had to throw my 2 cents worth in. I would like to try this for friends, but as a diabetic, I probably won't-- too tempting and way too many carbs..

The first time I overcooked the condensed milk and it became very chunky. I had to start over. The second batch was good and the pie turned out very well. The one leftover piece did not hold up well in the refrigerator (filling and whipped cream start to ooze) so it really does need to be served shortly after assembling.

I`ve done this recipe for over 10 years an i DO NOT go over all the process of baking the condensed milk. I simply put the cans in a pressure cooker for 25-30 minutes and let them cool COMPLETELY, then i go on with the recipe. This makes the preparing really enjoyable.

Haven't made it yet... question for those who have... why does it note that "toffee-filled crust can be chilled up to three hours"??? What happens after three hours? What if I store overnight? This does not seem like a filling that would make a crust soggy.... any experience? Will leftover pie be horrid a day or two later?

Put the condensed milk in a 1-qt Pirex pitcher and microwave on medium heat (watching like a hawk) until the desired color. Stir whenever milk threatens to bubble up over top. This is really quick and foolproof, but you MUST watch it!

Have not yet made this recipe, but I usually just open the can, pour it into a bowl, and nuke it until it's the color/consistency that I want. I was also raised on the "boiling can in water" method, and ours never exploded. I think it has to do with keeping the can covered with water.

Rating: 4
As a prof. pastry chef, this is one of our most sought after desserts. The easiest method that I have used for years is to simmer the condensed milk sealed (un-opened) in the can for about 3 hours. just simmer and make sure that it is always covered with water. Cool then refridgerate until you need to use it ( up to 2 weeks).

The recipe says "2 cups sweetened condensed milk, (21 oz)". Well, where *I* come from, 1 C = 8 oz, 2 C = 16 oz. So, which is it? Two cups, or 21 ounces? It can't be both... If someone could clarify from their own experience / recipes, please!!

Hah! Brings back memories!!! Thirty years ago my Mom would take an unopened can of sweetened condensed milk, drop it into a big pot of boiling water, and leave it in there for 2-3 hours! On the Eagle Milk website they say this is HIGHLY UNRECOMMENDED...and you know why!!! (BOOM!!!!) I guess it was a housewife thing from the 50's or something...I'm suprised Mom didn't blow up the kitchen with us in it, but it never exploded on her back then. If you don't want to go the "pie pan in water in the oven" route, try putting the milk in the top of a double boiler over boiling water, cover, and stir every 20 mins for 2 hours. The longer you cook it, the darker the toffy gets, it will turn into a thick deep golden brown caramel sauce if you leave it for 3+ hours. Mom used to use it as a filling in the middle of two layers of white cake, and she used a lighter whipped cream or buttercream frosting for the outside of the cake. Very delicious, in spite of her dangerous method.

cans I make the same pie using a different method to make the toffee which I think is much easier. All you do is put the unopened can of condensed milk (or several as it keeps well in the fridge) in a large pan of boiling water and let it boil for 5 hours. Open the can and you have delicious toffee inside. Just don't let the pan boil dry. I find I only have to top up the water a couple of times. The easiest alternative is to just buy a jar of dulce de leche because that is basically what you are making! I only use one can of condensed milk and about 3 bananas sliced fairly thickly, then top it with unsweetened whipped cream and grated chocolate. I used Rose Levy Beranbaum's flaky pie crust recipe. Everyone in my book group swooned over this delicious dessert and wanted the recipe.
