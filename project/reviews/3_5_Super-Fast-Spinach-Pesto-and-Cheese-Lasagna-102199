Very good. I used fresh spinach. Great base recipe that can be tweeked and changed.

Rating: 4
Everyone loved this! I followed the advice about mixing the spinach and pesto in with the ricotta... worked great. The pesto I bought turned out to be very mild, so I used the whole 7oz package. It was even a bit bland, but after adding the cracked peper and salt it took on a nice flavor. I can see being careful about overdoing the pesto. When I make my own pesto it's 1000x stronger. 7oz of that would make my guests pass out. I also made sure the spinach was drained really well to keep the lasagne from getting watery, and I didn't use a full cup of sauce each layer, just enough to cover. I love this sauce called Rao's. It's pricey but it went so perfectly in this lasagna. I also mixed the Fontina with a little mozzarella. This was a big hit and not hard at all. I'll be making it again for sure.

I've made this faithfully. Other nights, I've made modifications based on what's on hand. Either way, it's a big hit at parties. Great way to feed a crowd and have them feel cherished that you made it from scratch.

I had a large crowd of x100 and this recipe really delivered! It was fast to put together, pleased the non- vegetarian's in the crowd as well as the vegetarians. I may try some of the suggestions in the future, but I made it per the recipe & I thought it was perfect.

This was a tasty, super easy lasagna. Just be sure to drain all the liquid you can out of the spinach. Also, taste your pesto before you add it. I bought an unfamiliar brand because the one I like wasn't available. It turned out to have a very strong flavor, so I only added half as much as recommended. I think the full amount would have been overwhelming. I threw in some dried herbs--a mix of oregano, basil, marjoram, etc. And I subbed mozzarella for the fontina, since that's what I had. I'll definitely make this again.

I made this twice with regular whole wheat lasagna and mozzarella and was pleased with the result (I always mix the spinach and cheese fillings together too). Much more flavorful than veggie lasagna often is. Today I made the recipe with fontina and no boil noodles, as written, and I actually think it's better with mozz. Fontina is too soft to stand up to the rather mushy filling. It absorbed some of the liquid from the sauce and became slimy. I think the recipe works better with the chewiness of mozzarella. I also found the no boil noodles to be thin and quite soft as well. The result was more cohesive than with sturdy whole wheat noodles but also less filling and texturally interesting. Kinda like eating a bowl of lasagna pudding. Also, since the noodles aren't boiled in salted water the lasagna was a bit bland overall. I would recommend oversalting the filling a bit to compensate.

Great stuff..I followed the other reviews suggestions and mixed the spinach, ricotta and pesto together...I used a blend of mozzerla and fontina...and I used very little sauce...I also topped the final layer with slice tomatoes, chopped garlic, some thyme and sprinkled locatelli romano and drizzled some olive oil over it...as I wanted a fresher taste than tomato sauce...next time I will chopped the tomatoes instead. Smelled great and tasted fabulous...maybe next time I'll used fresh tomatoes instead of sauce for the entire dish....was really good.

I agree with a previous reviewer who said that there is way too much pesto. I didn't change any of the ingredients, but combined the spinach and pesto with the ricotta mixture, as many people suggested. I used Trader Joe's basil pesto (6.7 ounce jar) and the pesto flavor was overwhelming. I had leftovers, but threw it out. As my grandmother would have said, "It's not fit to eat!"

Rating: 4
I had low expectations but this was really very good. I made a few changes suggested by others: mixing the spinach w/ the cheese, using 2 eggs instead of one, squeezing out the water from the fresh steamed spinach before adding it. I also threw in some chopped broccoli. It's a great basic recipe that will probably become my standard lasagna. I was worried it would be too liquidy b/c I pre-cooked the noodles instead of using no-boil but it still held up well without totally falling apart.There was a nice balance between cheese and sauce and it was much more flavorful that other lasagnas I've made.

This is a great basic recipe for lasagna that you can play with safely. I use A LOT more spinach and make my own sauce. Sometimes I pour creme fraiche mixed with a little freshly grated parmesan over the top. Toasted pine nuts are another alternative topping. The more fresh ingredients the better.

This is really yummy and interesting. Also very easy to make substitutions. I had only about 1/2 cup of ricotta, so I threw in fat free feta. I didn't have fontina so I used mozzarella. I also didn't have enough pesto but I just used what I had, and had only fresh spinach, so I microwaved it for just a bit and squeezed out the water. Turned out terrific.

This is a pretty bullet-proof recipe; a huge hit. A few modifications: Trader Joe's pesto works well; def mix spinach/pesto mix with ricotta and mix in a tbs of italian spices; top ricotta mixture with morz/parm cheese mixture (I substituted 2 cups fontina with 2cups morz mixed with 2 cups parm), and RELAX about using bottled sauce, frozen spinach and no cook noodles. Do what works for you! This version is super-cheesey so have some extra sauce on hand. The pesto-spinach mix is "zesty" so a milder sauce (like marinara) is recommended. Manga!

I've made this a few times for large groups, especially as a vegetarian option, and it's gotten rave reviews. Always ends up a bit soggy, I will try using less sauce next time. Easy crowd-pleaser.

I really enjoyed this recipe, and it was a perfect recipe for a Friday Boardgame Night, as I had very little time to make anything between getting off work and when the guests arrived! I can understand why some had such bad experience with the Pesto, I think pesto sauce varies widely on ratio of basil to oil. I used pesto paste mixed with olive oil with about a 1 to 3 ratio, and was happy with the results. I used frozen spinach as well, because I think the frozen has more concentrated flavors than fresh.

I thought this sounded good but I just don't like pesto combined with tomato sauce. My husband loved it though, and its a very easy recipe. I used homemade pesto, which still didn't help the flavors.

Rating: 1
I was so disappointed in this recipe! Especially given the great reviews and rating. Instead of using frozen spinach, I used two 9oz bags of fresh spinach, which I chopped by hand. I love spinach and was really hoping that the fresh flavor would come through. But you know what? I not only couldn't taste the spinach, but couldn't taste much of any ingredient because of the PESTO! I like pesto, the the amount in this recipe is overwhelming and disgusting. Pesto, pesto, pesto was all we could taste! The kitchen even still smelled like pesto this morning when we woke up. Yuck! If this recipe called for only a 1/4 of the amount of pesto, it might have been okay. I made a full tray, thinking I would freeze individual pieces to enjoy as leftovers. Instead, after my husband and I ate one piece each for dinner, I ended up throwing the rest away. What a total waste of my time and money to make this. Like I said, very disappointing.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe at least 6 times. The one change I make to the recipe is that I make my own marinara so I always have this on hand rather than a bottled brand. I do as others and combine the cheeses spinach and pesto, works out beautifully. the last time I failed to but the fontina so I used some lowfat mozzarella and some feta with mediterannean spices. It got rave reviews. In fact, one of the regular recipients of my experiments said that this one far surpassed the last. So tonight I'm making it again but now I've deliberately used the feta. Try it you'll enjoy it. Oh and I always have extra sauce on hand just in case.

Rating: 4
Really great and versatile recipe. I did not have any pesto or fontina on hand, so instead I chopped up some basil and mixed it into the ricotta-parmesan mixture, topped the lasagna with fresh mozzarella and sprinkled it over with minced sundried tomatoes. I reduced the baking time by 3 minutes and slid it under the broiler to caramelise the mozarella. It still turned out great.

Rating: 3
For the making, it's a good compromise between making all from scratch and having a ready-made lasagna. But the difference in taste in huge!!! I sometimes did a similar lasagna of my own, but the pesto gives a good "oompf" to the cheese / spinach layers.

OH MY! so delicious! I made this using 2 16oz containers of ricotta and 1 10oz container of prepared pesto. Used mozzarella instead of fontina. Also, I mixed the pesto/spinach into the ricotta mixture and used 2 eggs. So perfect! Served for a St. Patrick's Day dinner with friends. Called it "Green Lasagna"!

I expected great things from this based on reviews, but my husband and I were both disappointed. The big problem: spinach. I love spinach in things, but it wasn't good this time. I suspect the problem was that I used a store-brand frozen spinach, and it was tough and stringy; hard to eat and hard to cut through. It overwhelmed everything else, and the pesto flavor was absent.

I rated this recipe a 4 after having read the reviews of others and following some of their suggestions as well as some of my own. I used two eggs instead of one as suggested, I made my own pesto with a little extra garlic, I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and I placed some spinach leaves ontop of the ricotta mixture and then sprinkled some Mozz. and parmesan in each layer. I also finely chopped some spinach and mixed it into the ricotta mixture. The meal was a big hit with everyone (even my husband who is the one that usually does all the cooking and can be a tough critic!!)

I made this for the vegetarians at Thanksgiving dinner, but it was a hit with everyone, including the carnivores! Very very easy to make (also used 2 eggs instead of 1, as did others) and to prepare in advance and bake just prior to eating. The leftovers are long gone! Spinach tomatoes and pesto....ricotta cheese, what could possibly be wrong with that! Will definitely make again.

This was good but nothing special. I think it would have been better with homemade sauce, pesto, and fresh spinach. I may try it again with homemade or at least better quality sauce and fresh spinach and no pesto (one too many flavors). Also, I used mozzarella (matter of preference). If I try it with the changes, I'll report back.

Great, easy recipe. I followed a lot of previous reviewers and used 2 eggs, mixed the cheeses and pesto all together and used fresh mozzarella on top. I also added a thin layer of pesto on the top at the very end. I made more layers, putting a thinner layer of filling between each as I like a firmer lasagna with more noodles. I also used canned cherry tomatoes seasoned with salt & pepper instead of pre-made pasta sauce. Lastly, I added a pinch of nutmeg like someone before me suggested to the filling. Delicious!!!

This was delicious! I followed earlier commentors' advice and used 2 eggs and mixed the pesto (after pouring out the excess oil) and the cheeses all together. I also added a couple of layers of fresh sliced mushrooms, and substituted one of the packages of spinash for frozen chopped broccoli florets. This fed 3 grown meat-loving men, 2 meat-eating women, and one vegetarian to rave reviews. I will DEFINATELY be making this again.

I thought that this recipe was excellent. I also combined the pesto and spinach with the cheese, and I thought that it worked just fine. I don't think that the lasagna was at all dry, and in fact, I would maybe next time use less ricotta cheese. The pesto part is easy if you grow a lot of basil and then at the end of the summer make a lot of pesto and then freeze it. It defrosts easily and stores well. I used fresh egg pasta sheets, and they worked perfectly (I didn't bother cooking them for the 2 minutes that the directions suggested.) I would definitely recommend this recipe to anyone who wants a vegetarian lasagna.

Delicious and rich lasagna - I made it for a dinner party and 6 of us polished off the recipe. I made a few changes though: 1) Basic homemade pasta sauce (garlic, crushed tomatoes, basil) instead of bought. 2) Ricotta is too expnesive where I live so I made a béchemel sauce instead. It made the lasagna quite runny (messy to serve) but still tasted delicious. Order of layers = tomatoe sauce, noodle, tomatoe sauce, spinach mix, béchemel, parmesan, noodle,etc etc. The homemade sauces made it a little more time-consuming but even more budget- friendly.

Such an easy lasagna and so tasty. I used a 10-ounce container of pesto and added some chopped artichoke hearts, a dash of cayenne and a grind or two of nutmeg. Used part lowfat cottage cheese and part ricotta, also whole wheat lasagna, to make it a little healthier. A huge hit.

I've cooked this so many times I barely need to look at the recipe! Love it. I tend to use a little extra sauce. I don't know if this has been mentioned earlier, but I combine the spinach/pesto blend with the cheese blend and then spread onto the lasagna. Another way to cut down on time. And there's no such thing as too much pesto, so use to your heart's content.

This was an excellent dish! It's a quick and delicious week- night meal. I used skim mozarella instead of fontina because that's what I had on hand. I also cut the recipe in half since I was cooking for two and it worked out beautifully. I would add extra pesto next time and maybe some red pepper flakes or fresh garlic to give it a little kick. That being said, my carnivorous husband said it was the best lasagna he's ever had!!

This recipe was amazing. You don't even have to change anything about it -- it is literally aMAZING. I don't even cook. In fact, this was my first time ever making anything NEARLY this involved, and both I and my roommates are all addicted to it. I added fresh basil to the top of the lasagna simply because I'm a fan of basil and saw someone else use it here...though that's really the only adjustement I made. This recipe was, hands down, fantastic. I'd definitely make it again. I'm having to stop myself from overeating.

I love lasagna, but it always seems like such a huge production. This one cuts down the prep time considerably. I agree with other reviewers - if you have a favorite homemade marinara, by all means use that. I also made a homemade parsley-mint pesto, and that was just amazing with the spinach. Tons of flavor! I prefer fresh mozzarella to Fontina, so I made that substitution. Also, a little-known trick is that you don't need special no-boil lasagna noodles, nor do you need to pre-cook regular noodles. Just layer the raw noodles with the sauces and cheese as usual, and really and truly, the liquid in the sauces will cook the noodles. Take that leap of faith, and I guarantee you won't be disappointed. :)

I rated this recipe a 2 because while the concept is good, the product isn't. I made several substitutions that made this recipe a hit at the party to which I took it.

With these modifications, this recipe was delicious!

Made this several times, it really is crazily easy to make. A big hit, with vegetarian and meat-lovers alike. Have used both no-bake and regular noodles and it worked out fine with each. If you use regular, just make sure pasta sauce touches both sides of the noodles, the moisture will cook them just fine. Added artichoke hearts and fresh basil in the layering and generously sprinkled dry basil over the fontina in the end - adds flavor and makes it look very pretty.

Was my very first time ever making lasagna. Both my vegetarian and carnivorous guests thought I'd slaved in the kitchen for hours and loved it! Really very fast and super easy. For some reason though I had extra ricotta and pesto... so I made a second batch of lasagna the next day. (First batch allllll gone!) Second batch I speeded up the process by mixing the ricotta with the pesto and spinach first. That way, it was sauce, pasta, RPS mix, sauce, pasta, RPS mix, etc. Mmmmmm!

I need a vegetarian recipe to serve my niece for Easter...since we are all having roast leg of lamb and ham...which she does not eat. Decided that this lasagna would do the trick. Did a trial run this evening and it was really really good. I made my own sauce which was a marinara with crushed tomatoes, onion, garlic and crushed red pepper flakes and of course olive oil. Followed the recipe exactly, except for the Fontina, using pesto purchased at Costco (their own brand). The flavors from the olive oil and garlic in the sauce and pesto really made this dish so good. I substituted whole milk mozzarella for the Fontina. Can't wait to serve it on Easter.

I also used 1 10 oz pkg of frozen chopped spinach and about 6 oz of spinach from our CSA that I had sauteed with olive oil & garlic and then froze. I sauteed an additional 4-5 cloves of garlic in olive oil and added to sauce. Also took others' recommendations and stirred pesto and spinach into ricotta mixture - made assembly that much faster. Used mozzarella as that's what we had, but might try 1/2 fontina next time. Even my 22 month old loved his first lasagna AND ate spinach happily! Will certainly make again!

I made this for my notoriously unvegetarian mom and she took home leftovers. I intend to add the ingredients to my pantry so I can make it on short notice without a trip to the store. I made the following modifications: 1. I used DeCecco regular noodes (uncooked), 4 per layer so 16 for the recipe. 2. I needed a whopping six cups of vodka sauce. The result was not overly moist, so I would definitely use that much again, but I must find a lower-fat substitute! 3. As per recommendations from an earlier reviewer, I mixed the pesto sauce with the ricotta/parmesan and used 2 eggs instead of one. 4. The jarred pesto came in 4.5 oz jars, so I ended up using two of them, pouring off the extra oil. 5. I used mozzarella for the top. 6. When I took the foil off after the 35 minutes, the contents were barely warm, so I gave it 20 minutes uncovered before adding the cheese and finishing it off. 7. My only 13x9 is one of those insulated metal jobs, so that's what I used. Possibly this explains the slow heating I noted above.

After reading many of the reviews and looking at other pesto lasagna recipes, I made the following modifications: sauteed "baby" portobellos, onions & garlic. Combined cooked vegetables with thawed spinach. Add salt & pepper to taste. I chose to make my own pesto but, if prep time is a factor, store bought would certainly be fine. Beat the pesto sauce together with the ricotta, 2 eggs (instead of 1), grated parmesan (approx. 1/3 cup or as desired). I used tomato vodka sauce from Trader Joe's, reducing the amount to approximately 2 cups. Put 1 cup sauce into baking dish and proceed as directed in recipe. I used mozzarella cheese, but will try fontina next time - just to vary things. The result: the pesto cheese combo was very light, flavorful and distinct from the taste of the veggies. I think this is a great make-ahead dinner appropriate to serve for any occasion from elegant dinners to Super Bowl parties.

This dish fed 6 women and 4 BIG men and was a huge hit with everyone. Even meat-lovers who were skeptical! I added more sauce too and was thankful for that tip. Also, I used mozzerella/parm shredded cheese on top instead of Fontina and thought it was delightful. I did not bother separating the pesto mixture from the rest, I just made one bowl of filling, and it was still quite excellent. Reheating was a cinch and I am already anxious to make it again! Perfect for a dinner party or a dish to bring to someone's house.

I think this is a great "potluck" recipe. It is delicious and easy. Below is a list of changes I made per other's helpful suggestions and I had great results: 1) Combined the cheese and pesto/spinach layers for easier assembly 2) Substitued soft tofu for ricotta cheese 3) Used regular lasagna noodles without cooking them first. I just used extra sauce and coated the dry noodles with sauce before placing them in the pan. 4) I used half Fontina and half mozzarella for the top. I liked the Fontina but I don't think the flavor is so different from mozzarella that it is worth it (as a soft cheese it was hard for me to grate and disperse on top of the lasagna). I think next time I will take the easier routeand use only low fat mozzerella. 5) I think the recipe really needs 5-6 cups of sauce as others suggested 6) I added onion, mushrooms, and sweet peppers to Classico Tomato & Basil Pasta Sauce to make the chunky pasta sauce. 7) I drained off some oil from the pesto to make it less oily. Used the refrigerated pesto from Trader Joes.

I make this stuff all the time. Made it a few nights ago for my meat-eating (picky) little sisters and they loved it and scarfed it down. Have made it also for friends who like it as well. I use 15 noodles instead of 12 and spread out the given amount of filling between them, adding a bit more sauce, because I think that 12 noodles isn't quite enough. Great stuff that gets better every time I reheat it.

Considering the very little effort needed for this recipe, it really gives you a lot for what you put in. Not the best lasagna I've ever had, but I didn't expect it to be. I used Barilla oven-ready lasagna noodles and it wasn't enough noodle: if I make this again it will either be with more noodles or cooked ones.

I have made this several times, and I was always asked for the recipe. Many spinach lasagnas have a white sauce; this version is much lighter, I think.

I make this recipe all the time (with the Tofu substitution). With the tofu, it's great for the health conscience family, and ends up being a much lighter meal.

I use regular noodle and don't cook them. I'm sure I use more than the 4 cups of sauce the recipe calls for, I make my own sauce and use that. If you assemble the lasagna and cover it overnight, the uncooked regular noodles turn out fine. I use only one pacakge of spinach and have tried to cut out the pesto (didn't have any) but won't do that again. I use mozzerella instead of fontina as well. I freeze the rest in individual portions since it makes so much.

Rating: 4
I have made this numerous times for company and everyone always loves it. My only modificatons are with the cheese - I use smoked dubliner (a very mild smoky flavor) and feta cheese. I don't put the fontina on top because it is flavorful and cheesy enough without it. Try it, you won't be sorry!

This was a hit at a dinner party I hosted where I needed a veggi and meat lasagna. Made some changes: sauteed garlic, onion, portobella mushrooms and spinach first. made homemade sauce with fresh plum tomatoes, fresh oregeno and basil. I went to an Italian grocery store and bought egg lasagna noodles and pesto sauce. It was better than the meat lasagna and my guests were impressed! I would definately use the fontina cheese again it gave a great taste to the lasagna (I also added some mozarella to the ricotta mixture ).

Very easy and tasty. Freezes well so we make two at a time. Could use more spinach. Easy to substitute mozzarella for the fontina to save a bit of money. The no boil noodles work great too.

I used regular uncooked lasagna noodles and the recipe worked great. I would recommend letting the dish sit at least one day before serving -- as it is quite runny the first night.

This recipe is really easy to make and tastes better and better with each re-heating. It makes a ton of lasagna so I would definately freeze a portion of it. I used a little less fontina cheese and instead mixed in about half part skim mozzerella for a slightly lower fat and less strong taste, it was still great. Great for feeding the ENTIRE family!

I really liked this. At least one person though found the fontina a bit funky, so if I made it as a crowd-pleaser, I'd probably use mozzarella instead. Some of the other reviews said the pesto was really strong, but I didn't find that to be the case at all; it was mild if anything to my tastebuds.

Try making this with ARRABIATA pasta sauce. This type of pasta sauce is hotter than the normal pasta sauce and is available in jars. I used 3 cups sauce, 1 cup diced tomatoes, aged provolone for the topping cheese and was amazed at how good it was. Keep Sam's Club Pesto in my freezer all the time for recipes.

Rating: 3
Made this recipe using Barilla Marinara sauce (required two jars) with homemade pesto and fresh spinach that I lightly wilted. Divided the recipe into two 9x9 pans, baked one and froze the other for later. Recipe freezes beautifully and is actually better leftover or after freezing. Next time would probably chop the spinach quite a bit finer, maybe even give it a few bursts in the food processor, as the larger pieces were a bit offensive to a couple of my friends. Otherwise great recipe, as it tasts like it was a lot more work than it really was!

Rating: 2
I felt a little guilty "making" this recipe, since it really doesn't involve any actual cooking! But, I needed a fast vegitarian lasagna recipe and this fit that bill. It was a lot better the next day...the pesto seemed to mellow out. We were at a bike race in a small town -- so no fontina was too be found, I had to substitute, but I bet it would have tasted more interesting had I used it. I think I'm too fond of good old fashioned meat lasagna to make this again -- unless vegetarians are in the mix, then I may try it again with the fontina.

Rating: 4
This was my first lasagna and it's a keeper! I had homemade pesto on hand and used that with Classico basil and tomaot mixed with one large can of diced tomatoes. Also per other suggestions I used fresh spinach and put in middle layer of sauteed mushrooms and onions with garlic and a splash each of red wine and tamari. I also used the silk tofu instead of ricotta, added a little feta on the cheese layers and topped with mozza as I couldn't find fontana. My boyfriend is a meaty pasta lover and he loved this one even better (didn't tell him about the tofu until after - he couldn't even tell it was in there). Will definitely make this one again and again.

Rating: 3
I brought the lasagna to a potluck and it was a great hit. I didn't have fontina cheese, so I used mozarella for the top layer. Per other reviewers' suggestions, using fresh spinach and Classico traditional basil pesto also worked well. The Classico pasta sauce wasn't chunky enough so I added a little bit of fresh tomato and that worked great. Didn't try the soft tofu for ricotta substitution but I will next time!

This lasagna was SOOOO good!! And easy. I love the pesto flavor, and I've never had lasagna with any cheese other than mozzarella; the Fontina was delicious. I did buy a chunky pasta sauce, but I think next time I'll doctor it up with even more vegetables. My husband loved it as well. YUM!!

HELP! I made this the first time and the flavor was excellent, but it was DRY (with a capital D) and then I made it again but I added 1 more cup of sauce and it was SOUP ! Again, flavor was great, but had to serve it in a bowl! I did let it rest, and I did squeeze the spinach dry! Anyone else have the problem. What am I doing wrong?

Rating: 3
This lasagne is delicious, and I've made it for several parties and potlucks and everyone loves it. But... it takes longer than "speedy" would imply, especially since it tastes better when the spinach is pretty dry (so if you're using frozen spinach, it needs to be thoroughly drained and squeezed dry).

Rating: 1
I did not like this recipe at all, and I was surprised cause so many others loved it. It may be the brand of pesto. I used Bellino and it cost 4.99. I will stick to my spinach lasagna recipes without the pesto, and perhaps add some fresh basil leaves to the spinach the next time. The extra oil and salt from the pesto...not necessary in my opinion.

Really enjoyed the 'fast' aspect of this recipe. I use this as a base recipe and add veggies, different cheeses (parmesan, feta,...),etc. I love the ricotta and pesto combination.Found the no-boil noodles no problem to find, which surprised me, and have them in the pantry all the time now.So easy,...

Rating: 4
This is the best lasagna recipe I've tried, although no-boil lasagna noodles weren't available at my local grocery store or a specialty italian foods store nearby. I especially liked the flavors from the pesto added to the spinach, and may add toasted pine nuts next time. I thought 4 cups of pasta sauce was plenty. The Fontina cheese worked well, but I'd consider a combination of other cheeses, perhaps parmesan to create a light crust on top.

I followed another reviewer's advice and used soft tofu (which was surprisingly hard to find) instead of ricotta. It was less rich, but absolutely no one would know it was tofu unless you told them. (Even my boyfriend, who HATES tofu, gobbled this down.) I made this to bring to work for lunch. The ingredients weren't cheap, but it made two weeks worth of lunches, so I froze one week's worth. This has a very strong pesto taste, and it was good, but next time I might omit the pesto and make the sauce much spicier. You also need a LOT of spaghetti sauce to make this work. I made my own and four cups was not enough so I had to run out and buy a small bottle of sauce. I also used half the fontina (seemed totally adequate), and next time might use low-fat mozzarella, because I have to watch my cholesterol!

This has to be the fastest lasagna I've ever made. i used a powdered packet of pesto mix, a 48-oz bottle of chunky marinara (paul newman's, i think), and chopped up some portabellas to add to the spinach. i also combined the ricotta and spinach mixtures, and used the no-boil noodles; also used Egg Beater (or similar) for the egg (what corner DIDN'T i cut for this recipe?). I did opt for the fontina cheese for the top (along with some shredded mozzarella), and loved the taste (i sprinkled the last of the parmesan on there, too). This is definitely going into my recipe file!

Rating: 4
Great dish! Took me thirty minutes to assemble. But it could go even faster with fresh sheets of pasta. Also whenever I am supposed to use riccotta I always substitute soft tofu and no one ever knows. Once you mix in other cheeses and seasoning you can't tell the difference. So the dish becomes much healthier and cheaper.

Quick-grilled some onions, garlic & red peppers to throw into a store-bought can of spagetthi sauce - turned out great. Used grated mozzerella & grated parmesan instead of Fontina on the top - worked well.

This was delicious and very easy! I had read some of the reviews of this recipe before making it and had noted that some people found that the prepared pesto made the dish too oily. I used instead a packet of Knorrs'dry pesto seasoning that I just mixed in with the spinach. Pesto flavor, no added oil! I would also use more tomato sauce next time around. But, all in all my family enjoyed it!

I definately thought this recipe was simple and easy to prepare, however I would alter it a little next time. I didn't care for the pesto and spinach combination. I think next time I will eliminate the pesto (the brand I bought was to oily). I used mozz. cheese instead of the fontina and it was delicious. I will make this again, but probably change the veggies a little.

What a nice (and extremely easy) recipe. It has just the right amount of sauce - not dry.

My husband--who is a great cook--is not usually a fan of vegetarian lasagnas, but he raved about this, eating it for three meals in a row! We used Dececco noodles which we cooked (couldn't find the no-cook kind) roasted garlic and tomato Classico canned sauce, fresh spinach (but I don't think you need to at all) and the one change I made was that I thought the fontina's stronger smell might freak my 13 year old out so I made the top 50% fontina and 50% mozarella. I actually think I liked it better that way myself, and after smelling the fontina she claimed there is no way she would have liked it if I hadn't made that change! What my husband and I loved about this lasagna was, as he kept saying, the balance was perfect between the elements. Personally I thought it was much better the second day, more solid and the flavors more melded. Thanks for a keeper! M. Brandt

I've never made lasagna before I made this recipe. I made it several weeks ago for some vegan friends. I checked with them first to see if they would eat it and they said sure. I did alter the recipe a little. I made my own sauce which I think made a big difference over jar sauce. The only complaint I have is not about the recipe, but the jar pesto I used. If I could have found basil I would have made my own, since the jar stuff I used was super fattening and not very good. I also mixed the spinach mixture and the cheeses together. Overall, a great recipe that is definitely a keeper.

I agree with all the other recommendations to mix the pesto and spinach with the cheese mixture. Much easier to spread on. I had no problem using "No Boil" pasta. I use Barilla and it seems to work out fine. I recommend more sauce than in the recipe. It tasted a little dry to me.

Funny, I skimped in some places, but extrapolated others. Definitely agree with combining the ricotta, spinach and pesto all into one. And what's the problem with one egg? I think it keeps the mixture from being too runny. But when it comes to sauce, I much prefer to make my own. Just a little sauted onion/garlic/oregano and 2-3 cans of good quality whole tomatoes with their juice. Finally, it's my opinion that all lasagna noodles are the same. If you don't want to cook them first though, make sure you add plenty of sauce to the casserole and make sure each noodle is coated as they will absorb a lot of moisture. It's also a good idea to cook it a little longer and a little slower than you would with cooked noodles.

I followed the advice of previous reviewers, and 1) boiled regular lasagna noodles instead of using the no-boil type, and 2) combined the spinach/pesto and the cheeses into one mixture. I could hardly taste the pesto, though! I also used mozzarella instead of fontina. Tasty and very easy to make.

Delicious and the fastest lasagna recipe I've ever made. I used my own pesto sauce as I had some in the freezer and fresh spinach as I had that on hand as well (I just heated it in a pot whole leaf with just the water clinging to the leaves, drained then chopped it). I substituted 1 percent fat cottage cheese for the ricotta and used only 1-1/2 cups mozzarella on top (trying to cut fat). I was sceptical about the results as I dislike the taste of store-bought pasta sauce but the pesto really makes this dish.

I used fresh spinach, and it was wonderful! If using fresh spinach, one bag (about half the weight called for in the recipe) works wonders.

Just too easy for such a wonderful dish. I added a layer of fresh garden veggies to really pump up the nutrition. Needs more garlic and pesto than the recipes called for though if you like FLAVOR!

This was a great, simple dish. I used red and green pesto. The no boil noodles are twice the price, so I boiled regular lasagna noodles while I chopped the other ingredients. Next time I try it, I'll add some zucchini too.

We've all eaten our share of pretty lame lasagnas. This one's a good one. Try it! (And if you use fresh, homemade pesto it's even better. )

Excellent!! I made this the other night for a few friends and they also raved about it. I made it the night before because it takes awhile to put all the layers together. I added eggplant to mine based on someone elses response and the fact that I love eggplant, and I'm glad I did. I brushed it with olive oil and salt and pepper and grilled it until it was aldente. It added two extra layers to the dish but was well worth it. I also used sauce with mushrooms and garlic for added flavor. Definetly needed more sauce too. Yummy!!

This was an excellent dish! And it was fast and easy. I added some sauteed portabello mushrooms to the mixture. Fantastic! Next time I'll add more pesto (I'm a big pesto fanatic) I will definitely make this again.

I doctored store-bought mushroom pasta sauce with some chopped red onion, red pepper flakes, and roasted garlic. This was very easy and tasty. Great for when you're short on time.

A big hit! I mixed a cup of very spicy puttanesca sauce in with the marinara for extra flavor.

This was great for a weeknight meal. It did need more sauce than called for. Everyone thought the fontina cheese was a good addition - more tasty than mozarella. Next time I might add some sauteed mushrooms.

It WAS simple and fast, but the no-boil noodles were difficult to find and expensive. I did need an extra cup of sauce that I luckily had handy. It looked great, held together very well, and smelled fantastic, although it didn't taste quite as good as I thought it would. But my husband pronounced it "excellent" so I'll look for fontina cheese & those noodles on sale, and make it again!

I served this to 125 people and they all loved it. It was so easy to make. It was hearty enough that no one really cared that it was vegetarian. It was very easy to increase the recipe for a large group.

My husband and I both thought this was great. I couldn't believe how good it tasted for how simple the whole preparation was. I used half fontina and half mozzarella. Even my two year old liked it.

I've always been leary of trying to make lasagna since it's usually hard to make and the outcome is sometimes a watery mess of unccoked noodles and runny sauce, however I needed a dish to serve at a baby shower I was throwing for my sister in-law and decided to try this one. It came our perfect! Everyone raved about it!! It was a delicious alternative to traditional lasagna with meat sauce. After the party, all the guests were asking for the recipe. This is definately a "keeper" in my house!

We weren't crazy about this dish. It was o.k., but I wouldn't make it again.

This was very delicious. I used six cups of sauce (I find that more sauce usually needed with the no-boil pasta); I also used a combo of regular pesto and dun-dried tomato pesto (bought both at trader Joe's). I found the flavor to be fantastic. This is an easy recipe that I plan to repeat.

Incredible recipe! It has become our staple lasagne. I should note, however, that my fiancee doesn't care for fontina cheese and, therefore, wouldn't necessarily beg for more. No matter... it's a healthy, different-tasting dish that I will repeat again and again!

I agree with those who said to cut back on the spinach - I'd probably use a package and a half next time - but even so this was a yummy, easy to make lasagna. The pesto was a great addition and the fontina cheese added a nice taste.

I made 3 of these for a dinner party. It was my first time making lasagna and so I was surprised how well it came out, it was delicious. Everyone raved about how good it was and many went back for seconds.

This was an absolutely fantastic recipe! I took the liberty of adding sauteed crimini and button mushrooms by layering them in with the spinach mixture. I think it added some depth to the overall flavor, not that this dish was lacking in the flavor department. I highly recommend this for those times when you don't have the energy to create a delicious feast, but would rather your in-laws think that you did!!

This dish doesn't taste bad, but I'd prefer to make the effort for lasagne from scratch.

We love it. I used about half the amount of spinach and pesto, because that's what I had on hand. My husband says it's the best thing I ever made--even better than his mother's steamed dumplings.

Wow, what a great lasagna! The "no-boil" noodles and purchased pesto were a GREAT time-saver. My husband and I finished off the whole pan in 2 days! I would definitely make this again.

We loved this lasagna. I would most certainly make this recipe again. and is probably going to become a "standard" in our household.

I made this dish for a party and I think it will become my new easy to bring dish that tastes like you spent a lot of time working to prepare. Easy to make and the pesto gives it a great kick. Moist and flavorful plus easy to make! What more could you want?

Delicious! I made my own pesto, and also added slices of cooked eggplant. YUM!

My husband and I liked this very much, and it reheated very well the next day.
