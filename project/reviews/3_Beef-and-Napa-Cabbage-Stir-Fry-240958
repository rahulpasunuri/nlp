added garlic scapes and pearl onions from my CSA. Doubled the sauce as suggested and also added more ginger. The long thin slices are a nice touch.

Very good flavor and easy for a mid-week meal. I followed the recipe to the letter & it turned out very good.

Would make again, but would leave out the cabbage. I opted to go with mushrooms, onions, bell pepper, snap peas and shredded purple cabbage. I enjoyed the sauce, but like another reviewer suggested, I drizzled with sesame oil to tone down the sharpness of the rice vinegar.

Simple and subtle, I liked this recipe. I used way more cabbage than was called for. Next time I plan to add shitake mushrooms, but otherwise I thought it was an easy, fast, and relatively healthy weeknight meal.

This was delicious and really easy to make! Both my husband and I wolfed it down. As others recommended, I doubled the sauce, except, I did not double the corn starch. When I make this again, I also plan not to double the vinegar. Doubling the vinegar gave it a little too much tang. Otherwise, great little weeknight recipe!

Great weeknight quick dinner. A few more veggies w/double the sauce would help.

While this was good, and I would probably make it again, I would not go out of my way to do so. I had napa cabbage that I needed to use and all of the spices/sauces, and pre-sliced flank steak for stir fry was on sale. Like others, I doubled the sauce and made it in a separate sauce pan, then poured it over the stir fry. For a weeknight quick meal, it was good and fairly healthy, with plenty for lunch for the next couple days.

Good point from which to start. Used thinly sliced skirt steak (briefly frozen to aid slicing), added sliced mushrooms, red pepper flakes, doubled sauce as others suggested. Light drizzle of toasted sesame oil for depth; A pretty standard stir fy recipe.

I don't know what kind of bizarre nutritional calculations are being employed here, but the numbers are way off. If the grams of fat, protein, and carbs as stated were correct, a serving would have 388 calories, not 287. However, I think the carb-count is in fact entirely incorrect; by my calculations, using numbers from the USDA database, each serving has about 8 grams of carbohydrate (no fiber), which makes sense, since the only high-carb ingredients (oyster sauce and cornstarch) are present in just tiny amounts (less than 1 tsp. each per serving).

meh. I doubled the sauce as well--there was no way there was going to be enough. Still, I thought it was kinda flat. Snow peas would probably be a good idea. It's important not to overcook, and doesn't make for very good leftovers.

I thought this was a very easy and tasty quick meal. I made just a couple modifications, adding a little sesame oil and chili garlic paste to the sauce. I think the chili sauce added a great touch and some spice. I also added snow peas and used savoy cabbage, since I couldn't find napa cabbage at the store. And I almost doubled the sauce. When I make it next time I'll probably thicken the sauce separately, then add the veggies and meat.

Bought a new chef's pan so wanted to make a good stir fry and this recipe was wonderful. Flavors were wonderful with a nutty brown rice. I used 1 tblspn less then called for of oil and it was fine.

No one liked this as much as we did, apparently. We liked it a lot! It was easy to put together, tasted great with rice, and made nice left overs the next day. I substituted bok choy for the cabbage, but other than that wouldn't change a thing and will make it again!

I added some thinly sliced carrots and served with brown rice. I thought the dish was pretty good but no one else was too impressed.

1 Tbs. of cornstarch was waaaay too much thickener for the small amount of liquid in the sauce! I also found the sauce too vinegary. Had to really add some extra ingredients to enchance it. Added chicken broth, a little sugar and more oyster sauce. I was better, but just so-so. Will not make again, there are much better recipes out there.

This was a nice, quick weeknight dinner.

Not bad for a quick and easy dinner, but it needs something else. The red pepper I planned to slice had spoiled, so I threw in a can of drained straw mushrooms. Scallions would have been a perfect addition. I liked the sauce; very silky texture and I made double.

How does this get a rating of four forks when I am the first to review? I was ok but a bit bland. I added carrots and mushrooms for colour and interest, but it needed a kick. I also added 1/2 cup water with soy mixture since it was too dry without.
