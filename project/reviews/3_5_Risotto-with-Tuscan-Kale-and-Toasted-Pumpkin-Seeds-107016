Made this with the following modifications: Replaced liquid with some cooking liquid I had in the freezer: about 3 cups beet cooking liquid which probably had other things too (chickpeas, carrots...), about 1.5 cups fish stock which had some vinegar in it. Added water to this to make 7 cups, and replaced the wine with water. Used regular (curly) kale. Did not measure oil and used all avocado oil (used leftover oil from frying some tofu). Guessed there was more than needed so ommitted all butter. And I don't remember what kind of cheese I used but it is a hard salty cheese but not parmesan. The rice turned a pleasant peach color from the beet liquid. I didn't really toast the pumpkin seeds but I'm sure that would have made them more flavourful. Served some tofu with it as I feel like this by itself is lacking in a protein source. Yummy. Overall a bit time-consuming due to having to watch and continually mix the rice, but worth it.

Although some of the reviewers suggested stir-frying the kale, I really enjoyed it when I quick boiled the kale as suggested. When I stir-fried it, the texture didn't really match the creamy risotto and it didn't integrate as well.

This was some of the best risotto I have EVER made! I will be making this again. I added mushrooms as suggested. I really think the mushrooms made the dish. So good!

I realy enjoy this recipe. Tossing the puffed pumpkin seeds and tossing witha bit of oil and sea salt is a great twist to a small add in.

I also added cremini mushrooms per other reviewer's suggestions, and they really made the dish. I also substituted unsalted pumpkin seeds for pepitas. Next time I make this, I won't pre-boil the kale. I think it destroys the texture and flavor of kale, which I prefer crisper. So I'd add it raw and chopped in the last 5-10 minutes of cooking time.

Delicious! We also vegetable broth and added creminis just after the onion.

This recipe only gets three forks because of how much work it was. However, I loved the end result. I felt like the instructions helped me make my first successful risoto. Also, the kale texture and flavor worked really well with this recipe. Perfect use of the tough winter/fall greens! Next time I will take the advice of others and add mushrooms as well. Mmmm...

I just made this for dinner and it was very delicious! I didn't have any Parmesan, so I substituted a couple tablespoons of soft goat cheese. Extra creamy and tangy!

I am confused, it sounds like the rice is just added to the onions and garlic without any liquids. Do you mean the rice was precooked? I thought rice needed alot of liquid to cook

I decided to make this recipe because I had a lot of leftover kale from another dish I made recently, and was pleasantly surprised with the results! I substituted bacon fat for the olive oil and butter (plus added the bacon bits to the risotto with the kale and parmesan) and it was delicious! The cook time was longer than what the recipe said, but I generally find that to be the case with most risotto recipes. I also used toasted pumpkin seeds from the grocery store (not shelled) which I would not recommend. But apart from that it was a really great dish!

I used Organic Arborio Rice that called for 20-25minutes cook time. After 18mins of cooking it was still too al dente. I cooked it for at least 23+mins total. I ended up using all the broth and needed about 1 cup more of plain water to make the right consistency. I probably added 1cup of grated parmigiana. I used frozen chopped kale, which saved a lot of time! And since I didn't have any pumpkin seeds, I used sunflower seeds. It turned out amazing! My whole family loved it.

It's rare for me to give a dish a 4, but that doesn't mean this wasn't delicious and something I will surely make again. I made it in the spring and didn't have pumkin seeds, and didn't necessarily want to use them either. I don't think it took away from the dish one bit. I thought about using toasted pine nuts instead, which I may try in the future. But I am more inclined to actually throw in some mushrooms. I love mushrooms in risotto. Also, I would taste before salting. Depending on the stock you use, it may not need anymore salt.

This recipe was recipe-quality. I did, however, use regular kale and it took me about 30 minutes to really cook the risotto.

This is a great way to use kale - we have a bunch growing outside and I am trying to find ways to use it! I followed the recipe exactly (except I used veggie stock), though I did find that it needed to cook for about 25 minutes before the rice was "al dente". In addition to the pumpkin seeds, I garnished it with extra Parmesan. My husband is not usually crazy about greens and he loved it also. I will definitely make it again!

I didn't really make this recipe so much as concoct my own Tuscan kale risotto based on a standard risotto formula that's similar to this one. However, I can suggest a change to the recipe: Chiffonade a large bunch of Tuscan kale and saute it in olive oil for a few minutes along with about 4 oz. chopped chorizo and a few sliced garlic cloves. You don't need to blanch, boil or braise the kale -- just saute it on decently high heat to get it crispy, and then set it aside and fold it into the risotto at the end. Also, I suggest using a shallot in addition to the onion in the risotto.

Really great! I changed a few things, like used vegetable broth instead of chicken to maintain a vegetarian dish. And, I think making risotto is a pain in the butt, so I actually just made brown rice and added the cheese in the end to make it creamy risotto-like consistency. This is a great dish to use up kale when fall harvest is in full swing! I also added mustard greens! My crew really liked it!

I made this using a veggie stock, and it was really good! The recipe is written well and it was easy to follow, and I had never made a true risotto before. The toasted pumpkin seeds added a great crunch and the flavors were perfect for a fall dinner. My only note: I don't think the yield was enough for 4 main-course servings, perhaps if served as a side dish there would be enough for 4 adults.

My kids actually ate kale! (hint: it's also known as "dinosaur kale", which my 7 year old son was very excited about!) Not only did they EAT it, they LOVED it and tried to barter for the leftovers! This recipe was definitely a winner in my house and I will make it again. (the grown-ups loved it, too)

A nice introduction to cooking with/eating Tuscan (black) kale. I love the vibrant green color, "crunch" & overall flavor of this type of kale. The recipe itself, however, was a bit bland for my taste. It is a good solid risotto, but did not have the "wow factor" I was expecting.

Tasty! I added a bit of sausage as others suggested and was very happy with the results. I was wary of the pumpkin seeds, but loved them!

this was delicious, used regular kale and it was great, not sure how tuscan kale would have changed it. made it as written except for the pumpkin seeds, has plenty of subtle flavor

We didn't expect much from this recipe, but had a surplus of kale on hand plus all of the other ingredients, so gave it a try. Boy - were we pleasantly surprised! Tonight is the third time we've made it, and so long as you read the recipe thoroughly and realize that you'll be standing and slowing adding stock and not really able to prep other courses, all is good. LOVE this recipe!!

Totally amazing! But it requires too much cheese.

Rating: 2
ehh -- the result was good, but it was certainly a lot of time and effort. Next time I might consider making a similar version using orzo, but cooked risotto style (quicker). Also, I added sausage to the recipe: I sauteed it, set it aside, then cooked the onions & garlic in the rendered fat -- yum!

This recipe is fabulous - I've made it several times, and sometimes substitute shallots for onions, but the main thing is to only make it with TUSCAN KALE - no substitutes. I've tried it with other greens and it was not as satisfying.

my homies just made this dish for me and o.m.g. it was delightful. so good that i'm looking it up *and* writing my first epicurious review. i was shocked to see others weren't excited!... felt like i should set the record straight for other folks- just try it; it's delish.

I absolutely disagree with the other reviews of this recipe. My grocery store didn't have tuscan kale so I used a flat leaf kale instead and it was fantastic. I also used two red onions in place of the 1 + 1/2 cups of onion the recipe calls for. And since I'm allergic to milk, I used a kind of shreddable, creamy goat cheese, instead of the parmesan. This was a fantastic and filling meal. Well worth the effort. I will surely be making this one again!

Better to use the tuscan kale for an Italian swiss chard or spinach recipe. Saute garlic and onion or shallot in olive oil. Wash kale, remove ribs from kale and tear into pieces. toss into pan, add a bit of chicken stock (or not, depending on amount of liquid desired,) toss in raisins. Cook until wilted or desired doneness.

Too much time for an okay risotto--I suggest using frozen spinach and toasted pine nuts, more garlic, and a sprinkling of red pepper flakes.
