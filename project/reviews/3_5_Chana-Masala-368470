This recipe is a nice guide but I found I had to triple the amount of dried spices called for to approach a more authentic level of flavor...in this case it was awesome

This recipe was easy, quick and delicious. I am definitely going to make it again.

A fantastic dish! I made sure to saute the garam masala and turmeric with the onions for 1 minute prior to adding the tomatoes, ginger and lemon juice. This lent a nice, toasty depth to the spices. Even my husband (who rolls his eyes at the mention of vegetarian/vegan dishes) liked it. A wonderful and light meal when served over rice.

Delicious! I made this in a crock pot, and set it to low for 4.5 hours. I used 2 cans of tomatoes rather than fresh, powdered ginger, and dried cilantro leaves. Served over jasmine rice.

Yum! Easy dinner. I sauted onions for awhile, added spices (garam masala, cumin seeds I toasted and ground, tumeric), then added garlic and ginger at the end of that bit. Next tomatos and lemon juice (to help scrap up the juicy brown bits). I let everything meld together for a bit and finally added chickpeas. Served it on top of brown basmati rice with salt and ghee and it was yummy.

Overall, the recipe was a good base. I fried the onions, garlic and ginger with the curry powder and garam masala, adding water every once in a while to ensure it didn't burn. I also added 1 1/2 tsp of whole cumin seeds. Once the onion and garlic were soft, I added the chickpeas, tomato and cilantro. It's important that cilantro cook down, as this will give the dish a fuller flavor. I saved some cilantro (about a tablespoon) for garnish on top. I definitely recommend this dish with brown rice; the nutty flavor of brown rice really complements the spices.

I like it with 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper & 1/2 cup cilantro instead of 1/4 cup. I use 1 tsp garam masala & 1 1/2 tsp curry powder

Very good! My husband thought the lemon juice was a little overpowering, but otherwise I would make it the same way again.

This was good, but not great. I didn't have tumeric, so I just left it out - maybe that was the key ingredient because while this was an easy, healthy dish it was lacking in flavor. Like I said, it was good, but I wouldn't rush out to make it again.

We really enjoyed this as a quick lunch. Simple to make, complex and interesting flavors. I didn't have any cilantro, which according to the previous reviewer was not to be skipped, so i improvised a handful of chopped fresh spinach. That turned out to be a nice touch.

Recipe was simple. Strong, warming flavors. Results were a satisfying, authentic tasting meal to be enjoyed by both vegetarians and omnivores alike ;o) The cilantro was a nice final touch that shouldn't be skipped!
