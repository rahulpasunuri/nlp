We used suasage rather than hot dogs and I liked it plently. I went to alot of effort to find the beers listed, two different stores, and I think a dark beer would have been acceptable. We had way more sauerfraut than we needed.

Wow! Used a blackberry beer to braise the hot dogs with, and Guiness Stout for the sauerkraut (as husband would drink the rest), and even the 2 non sauerkraut/mustard people went back for more. Can't wait to make it again with cherry brats!

This was really tasty, but not because of all the beer. It pretty much just tasted like hot dogs and sauerkraut. I recommend drinking the beer and not wasting a delicious lambic on cooking.

Best dog I've ever had. However, I am not much of a hot dog lover but more of a wurst girl, so maybe this is why I adored this recipe so much. I carmelized a sliced onion in butter and caraway seeds and added it to the sauerkraut. Delicious!
