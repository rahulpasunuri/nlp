I made this twice last week. Initially for a scallop recipe, and after having it with that, we decided to make it again with a roast pork. It's a really nice alternative to mashed potatoes, although don't expect the exact same creamy consistency. I wasn't too strict with the cream and butter quantities listed, just added and tasted until it was right. I didn't find this too sweet, and loved the rustic, root-vegetable texture.

I used whipped cream (fresh w/ a little sugar). I also threw in an extra sweet Kennebunk potato that survived our winter so the sugar content was high. Yummy!

What a fabulous recipe! I halved the cream and butter. I don't think I'll ever touch a white potato again! No need to with this!

Yummy, but not very creamy at all - definitely not the texture of cauliflower mash or mashed potatoes.

This is a wonderful fall dish and so easy. The cream and butter are almost unnecessary; one or the other would be fine, or half the amounts of each. You could skip the chives and add a little nutmeg for a less savory version. Larger parsnips are sweeter.

This was delicious, simple, and different from the typical veggie or starch. It was a little sweeter than I anticipated, since I hadn't had a lot of experience with parsnips, but really tasty!! We served it with roasted chicken and caesar salad. Yum!!

Very tasty alternative to mashed potatoes or roasted parsnips. The cream is unnecessary, I did use a little butter but I don't think it added all that much. Reheats well.

what's a tamis?

Loved the parsnip mash, but this is what I actually did: boiled parsnips and potatoes, drained, added sea salt, passed them through the tamis, heated buttermilk, whipped in the potatoes. Lovely subtle sweet flavor. Didn't want bouillon touching my terrific CSA parsnips. Didn't want my cholesterol touched by the butter and cream. Didn't need it. Served broiled fish with fennel orange salsa on top of potatoes. (recipe on this website) Garnished with cilantro. Very, very happy. M-L-C
