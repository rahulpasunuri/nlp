Made this today. I thought it was delicious even with an ever so slight burnt taste.My thermometer shows hard crack at about 305* but this recipe shows it at 295*. It started smelling a little burnt before either of these temps but I may just cook to 295 next time. The addition of the molasses really cooled it off. Not sure if the stove needs to be hotter (less time on the heat)or cooler to prevent the burnt taste. Anyway the texture was great, a little softer then peanut brittle, with a good crunch.I don't make a lot of candy so I was pleased with the results.

Love this. Going to try tonight with Tupelo Honey instead of Molasses. Also thinking of adding a bit of nutmeg...maybe next time. Chemistry question, if I double both the cream of tartar and the baking soda will I get more lift, or will it still just collapse down to the same size?

I loooooooooove this recipe. You can do this so it tastes a couple different ways. You make it the same, but it's all about the storage. If you want to keep it crisp, put it in ziploc bags as soon as they're cool. If you want them to get a little gooey, let them sit out, uncovered, in your kitchen, right by your stove for a couple days, and the heat and humidity from your cooking will make them soften. Either way, these are AMAZING. I made them for all my family and shipped them out two years ago, and will absolutely be doing it again!

Recipe worked out perfectly for my needs... A note to the previous poster about chewy candy: sugar is very tempermental in humid environments and will end up chewy or sticky if it is even slightly humid... I would recomend trying this on a very dry day.

This candy is fabulous! Any idea on how to cut down on the relatively 'bitter' aftertaste? I thought that I either burnt the molasses mixture or did the baking soda addition at the end wrong.

this is very easy to make. i have always loved this stuff and bought it at every opportunity. the only difference between my homemade and the bought stuff is that mine is not as "big" as the bought(mine only raised about an inch and half or so). does anyone know how to get it to raise higher?

Wonderfully crunchy candy. If you like the flavor of molasses cookies, you'll love this candy. Very easy -- proper boiling temp is crucial for the crunch! Gave some as a hostess gift for a molasses fan.

I substituted lemon juice for the water and thought it was a better candy. The juice of one lemon and a little water works fine.

Wonderful crisp texture and molasses flavor. Very unusual and good.

Followed the recipe to the letter and still ended up w/ chewy (!), non-crunchy candy. My husband is a molasses fan and I still threw out most of the pan. Will make peanut brittle instead of this next time.

Wonderful candy recipe! A hit at holiday gathering. Everyone enjoyed the molasses flavor and crunchy texture. My Grandmother Lorraine in St. Paul used to make a similar candy. Delicious!
