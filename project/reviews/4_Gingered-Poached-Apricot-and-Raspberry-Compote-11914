I am reviewing this again because I now make this regularly and I think it's the best apricot compote after trying several others. The primary adjustments are: 1) Be careful about the amount of ginger or it overwhelms the apricot flavors - I use 3/4 teaspoons of grated ginger 2) cut the sugar in half and 3) use blackberries instead of raspberries since the raspberries tend to dissolve 4) almonds are nice, but optional. We eat this all by itself, over yogurt or vanilla ice cream, or serve at an "apricot shortcake" over Cardamom Biscuits on this site (a real crowd-pleaser). I usually triple the recipe since it keeps very well.

Like the previous reviewer, I like to use this as an alternative to strawberries for shortcake. Last year I purchased a 4-5 lb flat of apricots when they were in season and made up a large batch that kept in the refrigerator for 3 weeks! You can also see Blackberry and Apricot Compote for a variation - also excellent.

This is a truly excellent recipe; I used it as a shortcake filling and have never had a better.

I was a little worried that the flavors wouldn't be complementary, but they really worked well together. The flavors are surprisingly elegant and complex, and this is so easy to make. My husband doesn't like fruit compote, but he liked this!
