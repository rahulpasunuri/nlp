Looking for something to cook and I had all the ingredients....and LOVED it! I only used half of the pepper and half the cream, but it was wonderful - and even better the next day as leftovers!!

This is really good, and not difficult to make. I only used 2 chicken breasts and omitted the peas (don't like them). I reduced the sauce a little too far, so be sure you keep some pasta water just in case you need to add a little liquid back at the end. Yes, it's rich with the cream, but I'm not going to serve it 3 nights a week. As Julia Child said - all things in moderation!

I have used this recipe since I first found it (Oct '95 issue). My husband (not a big chicken lover) loves this recipe!! I make enough to last a couple of days---the leftover(s) is wonderful--all that flavor sets in!!

I thought this was way too bland. I was surpised after all the glowing reviiews. My family thought it was OK, but not on the list of things to make again. Adding some ham/bacon or more cheese might help.

Absolutely wonderful... I also experimented, using fat free evaporated milk in place of cream, and while the appearance changes (or perhaps I cooked it too long), the taste doesn't. Delicious!

This is an incredibly rich and flavorful pasta dish, perfect for a romantic dinner. As always, direct attention when finishing the sauce with the cream is essential to getting the consistency just right. Also, remember to toss the pasta with the sauce in the pan while the pasta is still warm.

This was a great flavor! I did think it a bit to spicy for my 6 year old daughter! But as always Epicurious came through again!! Thanks!!

This is one of the favorite dishes in my house. My husband just LOVES it. I have made it for guests about 3 times now and each time I get nothing but the best compliments (and I'm not a very good cook). I use 1/3 cup chopped walnuts and 1/3 cup ground walnuts. I sometimes add more than 1/2 lb. pasta if I need to feed more than 4 people. Great flavor and consistency! Enjoy - TINA

Great recipe, nice presenation, although I would add the peas at the end so they maintain their color. They got too dark because the peas cooks too long. Two-three minutes tops cooking the peas before serving.

My husband and sons loved this recipe - although I made some changes to lighten it up. I substituted walnut oil for the olive oil, but halved the amount, and replaced the whipping cream with evaporated skimmed milk. I boiled it a few minutes longer to thicken it. I also used penne instead of linguine because it's easier for the kids. I know that "light" is not the goal of this website, but it's nice to know that some of the recipes can be modified.

I must have extra hot cayenne on hand or something because I halved the amount and it was still too spicy to serve to my kids. Adults loved it, though. Very nice presentation and great taste. Will try it with half and half next time.

I'm not a picky eater, but I really didn't care for this. My husband thought it was "o.k.".

I thought this dish was very tasty and easy to prepare. The blend of nutmeg and cayenne pepper made for an interesting taste. I will definitely make this again - Kitty

I added asparagus and used fat free half and half - always looking for ways to make a recipe healthier. Still excellent.

Really yummy with shredded prosciutto ham and asiago cheese as garnishes. That gave this dish the zest it needed.

We loved this dish! My husband & I made this for New Year's Eve & had lots of fun preparing it together. Loved the walnut flavor! Will make this again soon!! We liked the sauce & might consider making a bit extra.

Great dish, easy to prepare, nice blend of flavors - the nutmeg, cayenne and peppers are a fabulous compliment to chicken. Only thing to consider changing is cutting down on the quantity of walnut - a bit overpowering. Regardless, this one definitely goes in the make-once-a-month-file!

Delicious! My whole family enjoyed it. Nice blend of flavors.

The mix of nutmeg and cayenne gave this dish a very interesting flavor. It was not, however, "bowl-me-over" incredible. Not something I would serve for a formal dinner party, but great for close friends and family.

I'm adding this to my list of Epicurious favorites. Just yummy! It's very easy to prepare, comes together quickly, and the taste is delicious. I never would have thought to put cayenne and nutmeg together, to be honest. I think I might notch back the cayenne next time. Substitutions: Used half n half instead of whipping cream, and used romano cheese instead of Parmesean.(sp) I think the romano gave this a nice kick! Definitely try this.

This is one of the few dishes that I make over and over again and is the one most often requested by my husband. I always use half-n-half instead of whipping cream and usually make a little extra sauce.

Very interesting flavors and textures. Makes a nice presentation with the red peppers. My husband loved it.

This dish has become a staple. I have used sour cream and cream cheese along with the whipping cream and chicken broth with very nice results. I have also used more cayenne pepper when I was looking to make a more spicey dish. It is easily doubled and is just fantastic with home-made pasta.

The walnuts are a nice crunch and they add alot of flavor.

It was a nice blend of spices for an interesting flavor and of course taste.
