Best Greek salad I've ever tasted!

Have made this 3 times in the last 6 weeks (for different groups of people!). Delicious - big hit - lemon zest mingled with olive oil makes it. Used Vidalia onion and sweet grape tomatoes.

I've served this over and over, and have passed on the recipe to many. One change that makes a difference is to marinate the veggies in the dressing for a few hours, then arrange them on the platter just before serving. The marinating takes the sharpness out of sometimes strong onions. Red onion is good too.

I made this the other night to rave reviews from my family. I'd made a few changes based on other reviews: I roasted both a yellow and red pepper, used a red onion slivered over the top of the salad,and added marinated mushrooms. I also used homegrown cukes. Delicious! Will make again!

I was medium on this. I made it in Feb., so that may have made a difference, but I used baby cucumbers and tomatos, and both had a good flavor to me. Frozen artichokes (the kind I bought) didn't add much. Dressing wasn't that great- oregano didn't come through, and usually they say dried is better than fresh. For this, I would try fresh. Also added some pita chip croutons. Overall, kind of tasty, but nothing special.

I just used the dressing and it's delicious. I added the feta cheese in the dressing to add some consistency, then I used it to add some flare to salads and chicken pite sandwiches.

All I made was the dressing, but it was quite good. Be sure to use well-flavored oregano and don't skimp on the lemon rind, or the dressing will be ordinary.

I can't get enough of this one! After the first time, I did it again three times in 10 days! The key is the dressing. I used the very best olive oil I could find and fresh oregano from my garden. Sheer heaven!

Great dressing - got lots of compliments. The artichoke hearts were an unusual, but popular addition.

This was on a greek themed progressive dinner menu and was a HUGE it. It served plenty, was easy to prepare following the recipe and was very delicious.

Really easy to make and my guests really enjoyed it. I omitted the artichoke hearts because I knew my guests weren't big fans, but I will put them in next time.

I loved this salad! It was easy to make (could even prepare ahead of time) and looked great for guests or for a casual dinner. I have had many requests from my table for the recipe. I would agree the key is the lemon zest. Also for variation think of this as an antipasta platter you could add other ingrediants such as marinated mushrooms, roasted peppers, fresh small mozzerella balls etc. Might be a different change of pace!

So simple and yet so good. The lemon zest is the key.

This was an awesome salad. I reduced the onion to about 1 c. I used a tapenade in place of the kalamata olives. Also reduced the olive oil to 1/2 c (8 tbsp). Took previous reviewer suggestion and used marinated artichokes in place of the frozen. Will make this salad again. Would be perfect in the summertime to go with anything bbq.

Incredible salad. I strongly reccommend that you skip the frozen artichoke and use marinated artichoke hearts. Great with marinated leg of lamb.

Since I wasn't making this for company, I just sliced everything in bite-size pieces and tossed in a bowl with the dressing and it still made an impressive salad and tasted great. I think the key is the lemon zest - it perks up the salad, but isn't overpowering.

This recipe is easy, tasty, and very appealing visually. I used marinated artichoke hearts (and drained off the marinade). I used a red onion and a yellow pepper for visual diversity. I used a garlic basil feta for extra flavor. Impressive.
