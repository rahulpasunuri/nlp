Sauce came out way salty, trying to figure out what I did wrong. Used low-sodium chicken broth though Veal Demi Glace instead of beef broth. A mixture of dried Bing and tart cherries. Otherwise to the letter. Had a boneless leg, which made for a lovely presentation, sliced on a large oval white platter with the dark sauce & cherries napped down the center.

Amazing sauce. Like the rest of the reviewers I loved this. I used it with a leg of lamb. I added Veal Demi Glace and substituted dried crannberries and currants because I had them in the pantry. I will definetely give it a go with the dried cherries. After I served this I had friends ask for the recipe. Worth the effort.

Fantastic sauce!!! The lamb was Excellent!! I made this for a dinner party and received rave reviews. To avoid having to brown my chops when guests were here -- I coated the chops with a paste of minced shallots, marjoram, salt and pepper early in the day. Thirty minutes before serving, I was then able to put them in the oven (400F for 25 min, 500 for ~7 min), cut, pour on the sauce and serve. The chops were excellent!!!

Made for Thksgiving dinner. Family loved it,including kids. Sauce is worth effort, make sure and double it. Used dried cranberries as I didnt have cherries and worked great. Added minced garlic to the herb paste on the lamb. Also made sauteed haricot vert recipe with pine nuts found on this site.

Excellent sauce wih lamb. I added some breadcrumbs to the herbs for the lamb, sticking it on with stone ground mustard. I had halved the recipe to serve two and was careful with the dried cherries. The green peppercorns added a welcome dimension and this was a pleasant discover of marjoram. Looking forward to making it again.

I made this recipe twice now and most recently served it for a dinner party of nine. It was fantastic! I used two large legs of lamb, removing all fat. I tripled the sauce recipe using all ingredients listed accept I substituted red tart cherries for the bing cherries and added pomogrante juice to taste. I made sauce two days prior. In addition and importantly, I added a couple inexpensive lamb shoulder chops to the sauce while reducing to deepen the lamb flavour. Perfect!! Just as another reader suggested, I rubbed olive oil and garlic cloves over the lamb before pressing in the herbs. I braised the lambs on the stove stop, then roasted in the over at 425 degrees for about 35-40 minutes (give or take), marinating the lamb with the cherry sauce. I allowed the lamb to sit an additional 20 minutes to distribute the juices and continue cooking outside the oven to acheive the perfect medium rare. Don't forget to add the pan juices to the sauce. I sliced the lamb and drizzled the sauce over and around, then served the remaining sauce as a side. I sprinkled chopped parsley over lamb for presentation. To accompany the lamb, I made the white bean recipe from the "Braised Lamb Shanks with white beans from this site" and a butternut squash polenta out of the december 2005 issue of Gourmet magazine. I also blanched haricot vert beans and then sauteed them on the stove stop with olive oil right before serving. The perfect wine match was Ridge Vineyards Pagani Ranch Zinfandel, 2003. I made everything except the lamb 1-2 days before and simply heated before serving. I received so many compliments over this meal but my favorite one was when one of the guests who was moaning with every bite said, "this meal is simply an organism for the taste buds!" I will definately make this again.

I think the one thing to remember with sauces, especially when you are dealing with dried fruit and herbs, is that you must taste as you build the flavor. I believe that this sauce is perfect if you don't follow the amounts to a "T" but improvise with your palate - a wonderful dish that I have served numerous times with rave reviews.

This recipe is so amazing! I have made this many times and I love the sauce. A party I hosted for a large group made many yum noises as they started in and the sauce became the topic of conversation. I had to write the recipe down and run it through the copier for everyone. The sauce is just incomparable! This one is a "must try"!

I have made this recipe many times and it is always a huge hit. Usually I am serving a large group so I butterfly a leg of lamb, completely removing any fat. I then cover the lamb with a very thin layer of olive oil and press the chopped herbs all over, as called for. I let the lamb marinate for at least 4 hours. Remove from the fridge and grill the lamb untill med- rare. I always make the sauce a day or two before, and double it.

Labor intensive (especially the sauce) but well worth the effort. I don't like lamb at all, but served this dish at a dinner party for my husband's birthday and decided to try it. It was a great hit, even with me and everyone asked for the recipe for the sauce. Served the lamb with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and fresh asparagus and 2 days later I'm still getting compliments on dinner. Thank you!!

This recipe is so amazing! Despite the prep time for the sauce, it was fairly simple to prepare. I followed the sauce recipe exactly, but I substituted pork tenderloin for the lamb and served with mashed potatoes and parsnips with carmelized onions. The lamb would have added another dimension in flavor, but the pork turned out to be a good alternative.

WOW! This recipe was absolutely fabulous... It necessitates good technique, but that sauce is just wonderful! I didn't have brandy or port, and decided that it was too much effort to obtain, so I used 1/4 cup white wine + 1/4 cup dry red + 1 tblspoon Maple syrup. This was just great! I had it for Thanksgiving Dinner, along with a good Bordeaux and mashed Sweet Potatoes (recipe from Cook's Magazine)... I was alone this Thanksgiving, unfortunately, but the Lamb made it a much better experience!

This turned out to a spectacular lamb dish, rivalling any I have had at any 4 star restaurant anywhere in the world. Out of necessity, and quite fortutitously perhaps, I had to make a number of substitutions. I used dried black currants in place of the cherries and Sherry in place of the Port. Also, and most importantly, only at the very end did I strain the sauce, pressing some of the liquid of the currants and shallots back into the sauce through a fine sieve. The downside: my husband said there is no point in spending a king's ransom to go out for dinner any more....we can eat like kings at home!!!

Takes a bit of time to make, but if you don't mind killing an afternoon to prepare this is a very good meal. Sauce is alsome, great early fall dish, looking for what others have used as sides.

I agree with the cook from Hilton Head. The cherries were way overpowering. I have made many sauces in my life and this was not worth the effort. It is more appropriate for game, I agree. But too many cherries! Flavors of herbs did not blend well. The port and shallot idea is always good, when in doubt.

This sauce is making me famous! It also works very well with pork tenderloin, seasoned same as the lamb in the recipe.

I make this often. It rivals the finest rack of lamb I have ever eaten at the finest of restaurants. Lots of preparation time but so well worth it. Serve it with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus.

Again another 4 star recipe (see the Rack of Lamb stuffed with feta cheese and a pumpkin seed crust) Really worth it. Our friends Dusty and AnaBel from Palm Springs classed it as the best Rack of Lamb they have ever had. This is one that I will surely make again and again.

Very delicious sauce. The reducing takes longer than the recipe states, I had to really bring it to a rolling boil to get that reduction going. Nice earthy flavor. Nice with scalloped taters, and asparagus.

What a great recipe! We thought the sauce was an excellent match to the lamb. Not overpowering at all. Without a doubt the best rack of lamb I've ever made. Helped that I had a great meaty rack of young Australian lamb. The herb coating is a wonderfully simple way to prepare the lamb. Also, I don't understand the eariler reviewer's comment about taking all afternoon. I'm notoriously slow in the kitchen and I brought this dish to the table in just over an hour. This is a definite do over!

Great sauce...another reviewer also used cranberries, which are a great substitute for the cherries. The sauce complements the lamb very well.

I wanted a green peppercorn sauce to serve with caribou backstrap. Since caribou isn't strongly flavored, I decided to try the sauce in this recipe, since some of the reviewers said it was a strongly flavored sauce. It complemented the caribou beautifully. I substituted dried cranberries for the cherries, and cabernet for the port. With mashed rutabagas and steamed asparagus, it was a delicious meal!

This dish was "mouthwateringly" good. It was not that difficult to make either, which is always a plus! I would definitely make this dish again. The sauce is very rich, but not overpowering.

This is a very rich sauce. I used dried cranberries instead of the cherries and red vermouth in place of the port and brandy. This would be very good with venison. I agree that it was a bit overpowering with the mild flavour of young lamb.

I served this sauce with duck breasts, and it was fabulous. The sauce can be made well in advance (I did it two days ahead), making preparation a snap.

The sauce was overpowering with the whole dried cherries in it. Too many great sauces to make this again

This transcends any lamb experience I've ever had. Excellent holiday meal.
