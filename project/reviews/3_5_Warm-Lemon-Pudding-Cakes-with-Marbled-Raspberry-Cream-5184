Had to cook for a total of about 45 mins, and the top was a nice, light texture, but the bottom was very runny and curdled. I thought the flavor was just okay as well. Got compliments on it though...

This recipe was a huge hit! Contrary to what it said in the recipe, it took me over 45 minutes to cook, and the cakes didn't get too, puffy, but got pretty stiff and crispy on the top. When I took them out and turned them over, they had a custardy lemon look on the top. It was excellent with the marbled cream, as well.

Lemon yummy and maybe the best dessert I have made. Not like a cake more like a souffle so puffy and lite with smooth pudding on bottom. Hard part was getting dishes out of water bath, I dropped one so had to eat right away - poor me! Liked it more warm from the oven because the cake part didn't sop up sauce and get soggy like when it was cooled down. No berry creme put blue berrys on top in stead. Soooo good so make it soon.

An old-fashioned, but charming and elegant dessert with an airy texture. Not overly sweet with a good balance of tangy lemon. There was ample batter for 8 ramekins, likely because I put a layer of fresh raspberries on the bottom before topping with batter - many thanks for this suggestion from a previous reviewer. This was a delicious addition that was like a wee surprise with every spoonful. Found I had to bake an additional few minutes until set with lightly golden tops, but may be my oven. Served at room temp with the Raspberry Cream - pureed the berries earlier in the day, then whipped the cream/folded in the puree just before serving so had no problems with it separating/getting runny as others have remarked. Garnished with a few perfect raspberries and a scant sprinkling of lemon zest. Think it would also be great with blueberries as they pair so well with lemon. Attractive and very pleasing dessert, so please do give it a try. Cheers!

Yum! These are sooo lemony and light, but make sure you serve them right away! I did not make the sauce and did not think the dessert needed it.

made without raspberry cream these desserts had good lemon flavor, but they were not a wow. There was no cake texture, just a spongy pudding with lemon liquid at the bottom. There are better recipes for the lemon pudding cake idea.

These are amazing. They are like lemon bars in a cup. I also tried them with lime and it was even better, like key lime pie. Didn't follow raspberry cream recipe, I just added fresh raspberry puree to whipped cream and sugar. Really really good. Sold out at restaurant.

I didn't like this as much as the other reviewers. I made mine with the raspberry creme which I didn't like at all. As one of the other reviewers noted, the raspberries made the creme flat and it diffused into the creme into an ugly pale pink color. Eating the pudding without the creme was much better, although, even though I baked longer than recommended and the tops of the custard was brown, there was some liquidy stuff on the bottom which bothered me. The pudding did however have a very nice fresh lemoney taste.

I baked for 35 minutes in ramekins and served it chilled topped with raspberry dessert wine-spiked whipping cream and fresh raspberries. Glass of raspberry wine on the side. Perfect! I'm not a fan of cake, but I'd eat this again & again.

This is a delicious dessert. Lemony without being too tart. I used chambord instead of sugar with the raspberries and didn't sweeten the whipped cream very much. I think this balanced out the sweetness of the cakes. Made this twice and found it too runny the first time. Be sure the cakes cook a tiny bit past golden brown. I had more success that way.

This was so light and the texture was like cloud. The taste was also very light and perfectly lemony. I had different sized dishes, and I like the smaller ones best because they cooked the most. The larger ones were a little too runny. Really great for after a heavy meal

Hello At first when i was making the dish it looked a little strange and i wasn't sure how it was going to turn out.But in the end it turned wonderful. I ended up combining the mixture into a large pan instead of individual ramekins. This was pretty easy to make and i am 14 years old and i encourage you all to try it!!! Christina

Wow, is this good. The perfect combination of flavors and textures. Light and creamy, lemony but not too tart. This was delicious warm, but I preferred it after it had cooled to room temperature. A little denser, but still light from the meringue in the batter. I will be making this again and again. It is easy enough to make for a family dessert (I made mine in a glass pie plate), but elegant enough for more formal dinners. Try it and you will see what all the raves are about.

I just made this dessert tonight and was so pleased with the results! The little cakes looked so beautiful and tasted scrumptuous! I did not have time to make the raspberry swirl cream, but will do so tomorrow to put over the leftover cakes - I can't wait! The only problem I had was that the recipe said to put the batter into six individual souffle cups, which I did, and then found that I had enough left over to make yet another six or eight cakes! Perhaps my idea of an individual serving is much more conservative than the authors of this recipe:)

Delicately delicious! Even good re-heated in the microwave the next day. I topped with frozen raspberries instead of the marbled whipped cream. Just as good.

Scrumptious dessert. Substituted seedless raspberry jelly mixed with a little chambord in lieu of the raspberry recipe. Turned out perfectly. I made this a few hours ahead of time so I was the only one who got to taste it warm. It was wonderful, but so was the room temperature version. My guests really, really loved it.

Superb taste and easy preparation. A hands down winner in my book! The lemon zest was the key to this recipe. Nice for casual dinner, or special occasions.

I won't rate this, because after I put them in the oven I discovered I had forgotten to add the milk (long day!). However, despite that, they turned out wonderfully and we devoured them. Like LA, I made 1/3 recipe for a weeknight treat - it worked perfectly. Like another reviewer, tossed in a few blueberries, just because I could.

Yum! I'll never make another souffle (well, maybe)... It also scales well - I cut the recipe down to a third (one egg) for a quick after-work dessert, and it worked great.

This was phenomenal and super easy. I served the cakes upside down, so the pudding was on top, with a chambord whipped cream and fresh raspberries. My dinner guests raved, and more importantly, ate every last bite, even after a heavy meal.

I have made this several times, and it is always a crowd pleaser. Delicious and so easy.

I have made these many times and am always amazed at how consistently outstanding they are. Have never tried the raspberry marbled cream recipe, but simply adorn each little cake with fresh raspberries. A delicious treat particularly in the middle of the winter. Perfect for a light end to a heavy meal.

Wow! I added blueberries to the ramakin before adding the batter - delicious.

I have made this several times: great warm or cold, but best if done in the souffle dishes (verry pretty). I add white chocolate to my whipping cream, melted first: it stabilizes the cream and is VERY yummy! This is a family favorite!

I made this for my husband the other night as a test for a party next weekend. It is a keeper. It was so easy. I served with fresh raspberries, raspberry sauce and whipped cream.

A great, simple recipe for an elegant dessert. Highly recommended, though I would add a little less sugar next time; it was a little sweet for me...

I've made this dish twice now, for groups which included non-dessert people. Even the non-dessert people loved this dish and wanted more. I would definitely make this again. It's simple to make, and receives great results!

I made this desert for our Mother's Day dinner, so naturally, I wanted to treat Mom right. It was a hit. Everyone at the table loved it and commented on how "different" it was. No question about it....this one's a keeper!

YUM!!! I made this as the ending to a thank you dinner for a couple of guys who helped me move. It was to-die-for! I just used plain sweetened whipped cream and topped it with raspberries. Also, lacking custard cups, I made it in a loaf pan and served it in slices. It worked just fine!!!

Very good. Whipped cream didn't stay whipped after folding in the raspberry puree. Next time I'll try stabilizing the cream first with a little gelatin.

I discovered this recipe early today while web-surfing, and decided to prepare it as the grand finale to an indoor-outdoor barbeque we attended late this afternoon. The cakes were fabulous--moist, light, but not too rich--even with the raspberry cream. Since I did not feel like using souffle dishes, I baked them in a pan with extra large cupcake molds. Perfect! Some of the partygoers preferred the cakes without the powdered sugar--myself included. Yummy!

I have made this dessert more than once and always have rave reviews. I found that this dessert is much better chilled rather than warm or room temperature. Also, I make it in one large souffle dish and cut to serve instead of baking and serving from the six 3/4 cup souffle dishes as the recipe suggests.
