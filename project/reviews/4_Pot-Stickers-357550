These were delicious. I used store bought frozen won ton wrappers and they worked out very nicely. There was some filling leftover and I fried it in a pan with a scrambled egg and put it over rice with shoyu sauce....made me want to use it all for rice and egg topping!

Great recipe. For the reviewer that mentioned not adding the water: the water is just for blanching the bok choy. The bok choy is then strained, so the water doesn't stay in the recipe. I made this with turkey and spinach instead of pork and bok choy (not authentic, I know), as they were the ingredients I had on hand. Everything turned out great even with the substitutions. My only other note is that I browned the turkey before putting it in the filling mix, because I really didn't trust having raw meat in there. A great recipe and I would make it again for sure!

Dont add the 4 cups of water to the filling ! Seemed a little odd but I did it then ended up draining it out. Awesome recipe ! Very delicious.

I made these for an Asian themed dinner I hosted over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. They were well received. I used store bought wonton wrappers because I don't have the patience to make my own. It was hard to tell when the pork was done because it stayed pink and I feel like I cooked them 'forever.' I didn't make the dipping sauce because it didn't sound appealing to me. I made a few without the bok choy and they were fine without. I also made these in advance and froze them. If you do that, make sure they are coated with a little flour and not touching...I didn't do that and I had some problems getting them to separate. Quite tasty. Will definitely make again. Regretting not making the dipping sauce.

Delicious! I am just about to make this for the second time. I should mention that I don't eat pork, so I substituted ground chicken thigh meat that I got from a mexican meat shop (they still have real butchers there). I also used store bought dumpling wrappers in the interest of time, but I can imagine the recipe would be out of this world with homemade dough.
