This was really delicious and easy to prepare. I added twice as much lemon juice and extra salt for more zing, and it was very tasty. Without the extra lemon juice it was a little bland, but overall really liked this recipe and will make again.

this was truly delicious- I upped the cumin, and did the beets in the microwave (Mark Bittman's recipe- Scrub and quarter beets, microwave with 2T water with salt, with a lid/cover for 6 min then test for doneness with knife- usually takes 8 minutes). All told, about 15 minutes, not bad for great beets.

This is a simple recipe with unexpectedly delicious results! The tartness of the dressing contrasts nicely with the sweetness of the beets and the cumin and mint are a fabulous combination. I used half red and half golden beets and will definitely be making this again.

Very tasty and simple preparation. Served with a little crumbled feta and Spicy Indian Orzo from this site also.

I doubled the recipe and it made a fair portion for two people with a salad on the side. I peeled & cut the beets into 1.5" cubes and roasted at 450 F for 30 minutes, turning halfway through. These were really amazing! This was my first time making beets, my second time ever trying them. My husband loved them as well.

Possibly the best roasted beets I've ever had. Ideal balance of flavors. I used golden beets.

I love roasted beets and loved the flavors of the cumin,lemon juice and mint with the beets. I used 9 small- ish size beets, a mix of red and golden. I only used 1 TB olive oil and 1/4C mint -- which was just right. I had both ground cumin and cumin seeds and was debating whether to be lazy and use the ground, but decide to use the seeds -- glad I did - the flavor is much better than the ground cumin. This is definitely a keeper and the recipe I'll reach for when serving roasted beets.

I didn't find that the flavors combined well, the cumin and mint were overpowering. I would definitely skip this next time.

This is such a great change of pace from the usual roasted beets with vinaigrette salad. Love it!

I accidentally peeled the beets before reading this recipe, but otherwise made it as instructed. They were delicious, though I wish I'd noticed much earlier that this takes so long to cook.

This has become my standard beet recipe. All of my friends love it. I even have converted people who swore that beets were something that they would never eat.

I've made this now 8-10 times over several years, with our garden beets. It's a recipe that always pleases, even people who don't (think they) like beets, like my son. In a pinch I've used boiled, or even our frozen (garden) beets, though roasting is better.

Excellent recipe. We roast on BBQ in double foil for 1 hour or so; toast cumin seeds then add olive oil, sliced beets and saute, then add mint and serve hot as a side dish.

A great and easy recipe. We love beets anyway but I'm always looking for new ideas. I think next time I'll shred the beets and serve them over bruschetta with some toasted pistachios.

so, so, sooo delicious! takes a bit of planning with the roasting time, but overall, totally easy! first time i've ever made beets but hubs loves them so why not, right? after roasting our farmers market golden beets were so delicious on their own my husband didn't want the dressing. but the dressing has a nice little tang dancing around with the smoky cumin, yummers!! next time i will only use 1 tablespoon evoo b/c 2 was a bit too oily IMO. and actually, i don't even think you need the mint. but yes, its good with it, i just thought it got a little lost. try it!

Awesomely zesty! I followed exactly, and was most happy. I can easily imagine, though, in some instances, wanting only about 1/2 the recommended lemon, cumin & mint, especially if you want a whole salad's worth, as opposed to a few mouthfuls.

This recipe is great. I used 6 small-medium red beets and 3 small-medium golden beets and the amount of dressing in the recipe was perfect, in my opinion. I did add maybe an extra teaspoon of lemon juice but that's it. I think the amount of dressing would be way too much for 3 beets. I used this as an appetizer for a vegetarian tagine I made and it was a big hit. Will definitely make again - very different from other beets dishes I've had.

Neither my husband nor I have ever been fond of beets but we got a bunch from the CSA farm so I made this for dinner last night. Yummy - Hubby and I both loved it.

Great recipe. I only used 1 Tbsp of oil and served the beets over greens. Delicious!

Great flavour! I think I ate most of these before serving!

I made this last night using cumin powder instead of cumin seeds, and fresh mint from my garden. It was good, but too oily. I'll halve the oil next time, and add more mint!

I agree with other reviewers that this is a delicious recipe. The only surprise was how wet it was because of the olive oil and lemon juice, which might make it more appropriate for a salad.

This is my favorite beet recipe! It is also delicious served as a salad with nice greens and goat cheese.

Delicious. I didn't have cumin seeds so used cumin powder, which still made it a great dish despite it's less powerful state. I had gold beets so used that and thought they were great. Will definitely make again.

I was looking for a basic beet roasting technique. Since I had all the ingredients I tried this. I needed more beets for a BBQ and doubled the recipe, which was too much olive oil I think. That said, my neighbors and their guests at the BBQ were so complimentary and everyone wanted more. WILL make again with our garden beets.

really good, but I doubled the recipe and it was way too much salt; ended up adding more lemon and cumin to counterbalance

Excellent. The cumin and mint really compliment the beets to perfection. Will definitely make again.

I made this dish last night for a group of 8 people as part of a Moroccan-themed meal. My husband and I thought it was delicious, although not everyone at the table was a beet lover. I will definitely make this again, and will add more lemon juice.

I had two beet- despisers at the dinner table and they both proclaimed they adored this dish. Incredible flavors and such an easy preparation. Foiling is a grand way to roast; the beets virtually slipped out of their skins. Recycle that foil! Amazing dish - and beautiful colors, too. Would be great on a holiday table...but double the recipe!! Delicious!!

I will reiterate also about the roasting. it may seem at first that wrapping them in foil is an unnecessary step, but that method really added something nice to the flavor of this dish. roasting the cumin seeds also added a significant, yet mild punch of roasty flavor. the mint gives it a nice, fresh finish. I highly recommend this dish to any beet fan!
