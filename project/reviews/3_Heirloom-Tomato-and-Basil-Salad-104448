I also use Balsamic vinegar in this and add slices of FRESH mozzarella cheese. Fresh mozzarella comes in water and tastes nothing like the usual mozz. you buy in the grocery store. Fabulous!!

If you would like to make an excellent fat free tomato basil salad...chop fresh tomatoes, slice fresh basil and drizzle with seasoned rice vinegar. This is a summer favorite of my whole family.

There's nothing like fresh tomatoes. This recipe obviously depends on how good the tomatoes are. I made it countless times last summer and can't wait til my tomatoes are ready this summer. Yum!

to decrease oil I used 1/4 cup oil, 2 t cider vinegar and balance water.

This recipe is so-so, but I have some suggestions that you MUST try! Try steaming some fresh green beans, 3 or 4 red potatoes (skins on and sliced into small chunks - careful not to overcook - they should still be a little firm - just not raw), and chopping some red onion and adding that. Use MUCH LESS olive oil - way too oily in this recipe - and add enough balsamic vinegar to form a little puddle at the bottom of the bowl. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours - mixing with a wooden spoon occassionally - and THEN eat this salad. I'm not gonna lie - it's unbelievable!

I made this for company and it okay...however a little bland and too oily. The next time I added a little garlic and cut the oil in half and replaced with balsamic vinegar. That was delicious!
