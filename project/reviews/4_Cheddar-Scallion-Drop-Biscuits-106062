Chives and dill added instead of scallions, 1.5 C buttermilk, sprinkle with cornmeal for extra crunch. This is THE BEST biscuit recipe I've made yet!

These were excellent with a few tweaks. Firstly, added an additional 1/2 cup of buttermilk and doubled the scallions and the cheese. I used a mix of extra sharp cheddar, smoked cheddar, and gruyere. Then because (unless you are a veggie or vegan ;) everything is better with bacon, added homemade finely crumbled extra crisp bacon bits. Made the dough beforehand and chilled it for a few hours before dinner. Like others, only cooked for about 16 minutes- make sure you grease the baking tray. Also- reduced the salt to a 1/4 teaspoon bc of the extra cheese and bacon. I know these are more decadent this way, but they are fabulous!!!! I do not have biscuits on a regular basis so they are worth the splurge. Acnd they freeze well!!

This was a delicious way to use an abundance of scallions. I made my own buttermilk too. We scoffed these up quickly!

I made this with a good quality smoked raw milk cheddar. New heights, I tell you!

This is the easiest, most flavorful biscuit recipe on here. I make these whenever I make soups in my crockpot and people beg to take the leftovers home. Extra Sharp Cheddar really makes a difference. I always chop an extra scallion too. The recipe is simply perfect.

This is the easiest biscuit recipe on here.....AND THEY ARE AMAZING! I make them everytime I make soup or something fun in my crockpot. I sprinkle a little kosher salt on them before I bake'em. Delish!

I thought these biscuits were just ok, but the people I served them to liked them a lot. I thought they were bland, even after dding more cheddar and scallions per the suggestions of other reviewers. I think if I made these again I would add some kind of extra spices - garlic powder, onion powder, sage, not sure. A bit of cayenne would have been good, too.

i really like these biscuits, so i was really exited when my mom said we would have them for dinner, until she told me was going to make them. i am only ten!!!!

As others have said, these are amazing and super easy. I used 8 oz of cheddar and some emmental I had and added extra onions, as others had suggested. I think next time I will add even more cheese. I made these for Thanksgiving dinner (tomorrow), but I'm not sure they'll survive until then!

made these and my family wants them again. Cooked on parchment paper for only 16 minutes because if they were cooked longer it would have burned. They need more cheese and scallions which I will add the next time.Used 1/4 cup to make each one the same size.

Whoa. These biscuits are seriously killer. I used the smoked cheese blend from Trader Joe's (close to 12 oz!!) and tons of scallions, and the dough still came together nicely with just 1 cup of buttermilk. I almost burnt my fingers and mouth shoving pieces of piping hot, fluffy, ooey gooey goodness into my mouth and it was totally worth it. Oddly enough, it tasted as if there bacon somewhere in there which I attribute to the smoked cheese. My life is now complete.

I love this recipe. I had to add more buttermilk as the dough seemed dry. I used Old Bay seasoning and garlic powder since my kids don't like scallions. I baked them in my cast iron skillet at 450 for 10 minutes. Perfect.

I made these as directed but using White Lily flour and Rumford aluminum-free baking powder, and they were light and magnificent. They're best while still warm from the oven.

Really a simple biscuit recipe! I added an ounce extra cheddar cheese and about a 1/4 of a cup of parm grated on the microplane. Instead of scallionI used about a table spoon of chopped fresh rosemary. Perfect for my mother's day brunch! Puffed up big and beautiful flaky delicious biscuits!

Very easy and tasty. I recommend sharp cheddar so you can get a true cheesey flavour. I added an extra scallion. They are best consumed on the day of baking. They didn't really hold well into day two.

Damn near perfect when you take other cook's advice and double the scallions and cheddar. Bulletproof happiness.

Yum... quick, easy and delish. I took the advice of other reviewers and added more cheese and scallions. I'm going to try variations (like rosemary & olive or gouda & cranberries), because the base recipe is so quick & easy. Also, I cut the proportions in half to make 6 biscuits and it worked fine.

Great biscuits. I baked them at 425 instead, and for 15 minutes. I substituted nonfat evaporated milk for the buttermilk, a combo of mozzarella and parmesan for the cheddar, and Lawry's seasoned salt for the regular salt. They turned out great. Very savory. Husband said they were the best biscuits he's ever had.

Excellent (made exactly as written)!

Delicious and a nice way to use up extra buttermilk. I doubled the scallions and used 2 cups of extra cheddar cheese. Make sure to check them toward the end, mine only ended up taking 15 minutes, not 18. Another minute and they would have been burned.

These are delicious. I doubled the number of scallions based on a previous review. And I put in about 2 cups of cheddar. Very very easy to make. Next time, I would maybe add even more scallions and maybe mix up the cheddar with some parmesan. Will definitely make again.

We love these! Used extra-old "real" Canadian cheddar cheese & they had lots of flavour! We find they taste even better the next day...heated up in the toaster oven.

I didn't have scallions on hand, so I used fresh rosemary instead. They were fantastic.

fantastic drop biscuits-- so light & delicate (yet mysteriously filling- because you can't stop eating them!). Use an extra-old cheddar & you will have so much flavor you won't need butter. These are almost like the biscuits from Red Lobster restaurants, but better.

Fantastic! Easy and quick. Had to make a buttermilk substitute (milk,cream of tartar)and still these were light and fluffy, perfectly browned.

Although admittedly I overcooked these a touch, I would agree with the review above mine that says they need a little more flavor. Triple the scallions!

I make these for brunch or as an accompaniment to soup dinners. They're very easy and delicious, basically fool-proof. I usually use chives instead of scallions, because I prefer their flavor and extra-sharp cheddar is a must. They reheat well, too.

Rating: 4
Fantastic, and so easy! I used a very sharp cheddar, which was perfect for this recipe. They were great the first day, but even better reheated in the oven for the next few days. I made them without the scallions because I was making them for breakfast -- if I try them along with lunch or dinner, I'll try adding the scallions and maybe some roasted or crushed garlic.

Rating: 3
these were yummy, but need a little more flavor. next time maybe a little more salt or a sharper cheese will help. Had to add more buttermilk, and pull out before the recipe called for. still, pretty good.

Absolutely PERFECT recipe....yummy result!

EXCELLENT! These buscuits are easy and oh so tasty. However, I used half the cheese, and only one scallion, to suit my personal taste. These would be greta with raisins, a cinnamon/sugar ribbon in the middle, and powdered sugar glaze on top.

I made these biscuits from my new GOURMET COOKBOOK, & we loved them! I too used milk & vinegar instead of buttermilk, & chives instead of green onions. Bacon would be a lovely addition. I was tempted to leave out the sugar, but it made the biscuits beautifully golden brown in 15 minutes. The batter seemed a little dry when I was dropping them, but I decided to trust the recipe, & they were lovely.

Eh... These biscuits were only okay. I was hugely disappointed mainly because another review noted that these biscuits were similar Red Lobster's Cheddar Bay biscuits, which they were NOT. In comparision, these were dry and tasteless. But without expectations, they looked good and tasted okay. Needed more salt and buttermilk, which I'll add next time to see if they can be improved.

Rating: 3
I enjoyed these and the baking time is about 15 minutes, 18 is way too long. However, I didn't feel that there was enough scallion and cheese. Next time I will follow another reviewer's idea and add a touch of bacon bits. Very easy and overall, excellent. I will make these again.

I wanted to make these biscuits for a brunch I was throwing, but had two guests that refused to eat anything with any sort of onion flavour (how boring must there life be!?!) So instead of scallions I minced 3 cloves of garlic, I also added some dried parsley for color - they turned out just like the biscuits from Red Lobster. Very tasty. Wouldn't recommend making the batter the night before, I think mine would have been even better if I just tossed them in the oven the night before and re-heated the following day.

Made these to go with a beef stew - delicious! Added a little more buttermilk (1/4 cup) than called for because batter seemed too dry for drop biscuits - came out great. Also baked for less than recommended time based on prior reviews - biscuits came out just right.

Rating: 4
I don't do much baking so I was nervous -- but these came out perfect (and delicious). I made them the night before and reheated prior to serving with brunch. I added a little less than 1/4 cup of real bacon bits to the batter (inspired by a prior review), and everyone loved the results.

This is a simple and attractive recipe. The biscuits are large and if you pile the dough high enough you can split them and put eggs and bacon beween the halves and make breakfast sandwiches. Next time I am going to add 1/2 cup of crispy crumbled bacon to the dough just before adding the buttermilk. I used more buttermilk than the recipe suggested and just like everyone else said 15 minutes is enough baking time.

These biscuits are an excellent alternative for vegetarians who eat dairy, as they provide plenty of rich savory flavor, without having to rely on a meat product to do so. I cut down the cheese just a little, with no discernable impact on the flavor. The batter can be done a day ahead, which is a great time saver!

These biscuits tasted better the second day. I would use sharper cheddar next time, and I found the batter too dry. I had to add more buttermilk to achieve the right consistency. I agree with the other cooks- the cooking time is a little long; mine almost burned. But they come out of the oven looking quite impressive nonetheless.

Attractive and tasty biscuits. As with another reviewer, mine were definitely done at 15 minutes, rather than the 18-20 minutes recommended. Another minute at 450-degrees might have burned them. I made half of the recipe, and it gave me 6 very large biscuits. I'd make them slightly smaller next time. The cheddar I used was quite sharp, but the biscuits didn't have much of a cheese flavor, in my opinion. Really good though.

These biscuits looked far better than they tasted. I think they need more flavor.

Not impressed with these at all. Where is the flavor? Used all my butter milk to marinate some chicken so I did the milk and vinegar mixture. Maybe that was it. Next time will try true buttermilk or make some sort of sour cream substitution. Also, watch your baking time, @450 degrees, mine burnt on bottom. Next time taking out at 15 minutes.

These are excellent. I needed quick biscuits to go with a corn, chicken and potato chowder. I didn't have buttermilk so I substituted a milk and vinegar mixture and it was fine. If you are making a full batch, use 1 cup milk and 1 tablespoon vinegar for the buttermilk substitute.

We loved these little biscuits. I keep the extras in the freezer and pop them in the oven when I need bread. They are different and it looks like you went to alot of effort to make these biscuits. But, you didn't!
