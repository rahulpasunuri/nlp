This recipe really works well as a side dish with a Mediterranean themed dinner. The flavors are subtle and the scallions add a nice crunch to the orzo. Plus it's quick to prepare just before dinner is served. We paired it with the spinach salad with eggplant and feta.

I liked the idea of doing orzo with an Asian influence, but this recipe tastes too strongly of sesame and has no dimension. It's OK if you need a very simple side dish, but I would go with something else.

Tolerable, if you double the scallions, but barely. Orzo just don't work with Asian; go Greek.

THIE IS A VERY GOOD RECIPE, THE BLEND OF SESAME SEEDS AND OIL GIVE IT A NICE ORIENTAL FLAIR. I WOULD, HOWEVER, CHAR THE GREEN ONIONS ON A HOT GRILL!
