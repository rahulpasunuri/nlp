made this for a christmas party, but since it was not too fancy of an event and i was running out of time i made these into wraps. they were devoured in about 5 minutes. i am allergic to nuts so i left out the almonds and threw in some golden raisins...it was great!

I followed the recipe exactly and I'd make these again. They were great for guests considering the make-ahead options. The recipe was somewhat time consuming, but worth it. This was something different to make for guests.

With the adjustments suggested in previous reviews, the final result is good. However, preparation is very labor intensive. Start to finish was about 2hrs for me. Previous reviews are spot on- the basic recipe needs more aggressive seasoning. I doubled the original spice quantities and then added 50% more spices to the shredded chicken to arrive at a non bland filling. Since Phyllo is so difficult to work with, I started with 2 sheets, rather than 2 separate sheets. I generously buttered the top of the 2nd sheet, sprinkled with cinnamon and then cut the sheets in 2. Instead of filling and rolling from the long end, I used the short end. Then I baked the uncut rolls for 10 min. The final result was very tasty. I don't know if I would prepare these again due to the amount of labor involved.

SO so delicious! And pretty easy to make, also lends itself to improvisation. I had some left over puff pastry and used that instead of phyllo dough, just made little pies with the mix and the dough... the other changes I made were omitting the turmeric since I had none, and omitting the eggs (I forgot them!!), I also used chicken breast cut into chunks since this is all I had around.

i have a suggestion, a friend of mine uses spray butter, like Pam, instead of melted butter between th phyllo sheets in her spanakopita. Tastes great. I used it in the b'stilla recipe and only used butter on the last layer and everything turned out beautiful and flavorful. And fewer calories leaving more for wine!

These are amazing!! This was my first phyllo effort. I didn't think it was difficult until I realized that if one layer tears... you can't simply cover it with another one. Thus, some of my rolls were less than perfect in appearance, but I'm trying it again tonight. I made it with 2 thighs and 2 legs, which totalled 3lbs and I quadrupled the seasonings. Its such a small amount of chicken, that you really want it to pop! I made the tomato sauce, but didn't really measure anything, which resulted in a lot more spice. It was great, as well. I did add raisins, powdered sugar (at the end) and subbed black sesame seeds for mustard seeds.

used pre-bought phyllo cups (can't deal with phyllo sheets!) and froze for weeks. put them straight from freezer into a 350 oven for about seven (?) minutes, then topped each with a dollop of the spiced tomato sauce (which had also previously been frozen). guests positively devoured them. not too dry at all. excellent for making ahead!

great! skipped nuts in filling due to allergies and still had great flavor. did not have enough filling for all of the phyllo dough in the package. would double filling and pack them a little more than suggested. rolls were beautiful with the seeds on top. sauce was great, used stewed tomatoes to hurry the recipe up. don't skip! impressive addition to any cocktail/ dinner party. would definitely make ahead, did take long time.

Rating: 3
The filling for this recipe was very tasty. I would definitely suggest preparing ahead though, as working with phyllo is time consuming and can be frustrating...too much to deal with on the day of the party. Most people at my party didn't use the sauce. I may work with it next time to make it a little more flavorful...I think it was missing something.

very delicious appetizer, everyone loved them. The ingredients list looks long, but it's mostly spices to flavor this dish. I made these and cut them up and froze them, then coated them with the egg wash and mustard seeds before broiling them, so they proved to be a perfect do ahead party appetizer. I didn't even serve them with sauce, they were so flavorful on their own. One tip: while rolling the phyllo with chicken, make sure you keep the ones you already rolled covered with a damp cloth, not just the untouched phyllo. I noticed the ones I made first got very crispy and cracked when I tried to cut them. So either cut immediately or keep covered.

I have made these many years for a holiday party. I made 4x the recipe this year and tey were gone within minutes of serving. Each year get rave reviews. two years ago I tried using the filling in store bought phyllo cups, but they came out dry. I do not use the sauce. I spent some time in Morocco and loved b'stilla, which is also known as pigeon pie. I sift some powdered sugar on the phyllo leaves before rolling, as I recall the pigeon pie has that in it.

This recipe is fantastic. I used bone-in chicken breasts instead, and would probably omit the eggs next time as they didn't seem to really add much to the dish. I also added some Sriracha hot sauce to the tomato sauce for an extra kick. The rolls are slightly greasy from all of the butter that is brushed on to the phyllo dough. But, otherwise this is a winner!

To A Cook from Boston: yes - you can freeze with egg. The egg is cooked already, and it will not weep or break down when you bake.

made this twice, first time it was plain and underseasoned. Added 1c chopped dry figs to chicken while it stewed, 1 diced sauteed eggplant after chx was cooked, and tripled the spices (fresh toasted/ground). Added juice of 1 lemon to pan reduction, and sprinkled phyllo with blend of all spices before rolling with chx. Client I made it for was very pleased, and her guests came to me during the party to comment on much they enjoyed it. My tomato sauce was very simple - 28oz crushed tomato simmered for one hr with 3 stix cinnamon , 1T salt, and 3T ground coriander. It is delicious!

This was fabulous. Make twice as much as you think you will need. The only deviation from the recipe was that we used whole spices where possible and ground them.

This recipe is excellent, but it is definitely time consuming. Made as directed, but it took longer than suggested. Got rave reviews...

absolutely delicious! I definitely think that cooking the chicken with the bones makes a favorable difference in the flavor. In addition, the texture of phyllo is preferable to using phyllo cups.

Rating: 0
I would recommend placing the phyllo cups inside a mini muffin pan or something to stabilize them. I used the phyllo cups to make mini caramelized onion and manchego tarts with a egg custard base for a party. I started with frozen cups and added the onions and cheese and egg mixture then baked them. They were delicious but looked very messy when I served them.

My gourmet club loved these. I made them several weeks in advance and froze them. When I heated them I did one batch with the mustard seeds and the second batch without. There was no appreciable difference in the taste.

Great appetizer! Made it for a Christmas party and received rave reviews. I used 1 1/2 cups of shredded chicken breast, eliminated the water and almonds, and substituted sesame seeds for mustard seeds. Working with phyllo can be time-consuming. Next time I will make in phyllo cups and see how it turns out.

I, too, had forgotten just how much work phyllo dough is (despite all of the comments below saying precisely this!). This dish tasted good, but it didn't knock my socks off - tasted a little bland for all of the work. If I were doing it over again I would use more filling per piece and maybe go heavier on the spices.

Unless you have a delicate touch, working with filo can be tedious. Moreover I found the hors d'oeuvres to be safe-tasting, nothing really popped. But served in a square vase with the tomato sauce nearby, these went like hotcakes and impressed everyone who saw them. It's all about presentation with this one.

I made this last night,with the spiced tomatoe sauce. One word...FABULOUS

to answer aud1: I took them straight out of the freezer, brushed with egg, and popped them in the oven last night. they came out just perfect -- my guests devoured them. excellent make-ahead party food. (I also near-doubled the garlic, ginger and spices in the tomato sauce, and it came out nicely sweet and spicy.)

not giving a fork rating yet since I only made and froze the rolls (will make spiced tomato sauce in time for party in two weeks). just wanted to post that I'd forgotten how annoying working w/phyllo can be -- I've done it before, and I didn't really have any trouble w/sticky sheets, but even so it was VERY tedious and time-consuming. next time I may just put the yummy chicken filling in pre-bought phyllo cups w/a dash of cinnamon, then top them with a dollop of spiced tomato sauce when they come out of the oven. we shall see. I will say, however, the couple phyllo rolls my husband and I sampled last night were great!

Just a note after reading the reviews for this recipe... the sauce isn't "SPICY tomato sauce" but "SPICED tomato sauce". A lot of people seemed to wonder why the sauce wasn't "spicy"... that's why.

I had never worked with phyllo before and it was QUITE the learning experience! I did enjoy the taste of the filling but felt that these would be better used for a special occasion than just a regular dinner, as I had done, due to the labor-intensiveness.

Not fast food, but well worth the time involved. Interesting spices and a different taste. Important to have experience with phyllo dough before making this.

These were handsome and yummy, and while I love any kind of crunchy pastry, my guests went wild over the sauce--started spreading it on bread, crudites, anything handy. I found the sauce a more sweet than hot and would add some harissa to it next time.

This was very good. I will make this again. The tomato sauce was very good and necesary to the rolls, added moisture. I did not use any mustard seeds and i do not think it needed them. I also made them very thick, next time they will be thinner.

The spicy tomato dip was actually very good - not spicy but very flavorful. The rolls themselves just did not have much test to them. I might try making it again but using the phyllo cups or put more filling in them. Perhaps that would make a difference. Otherwise for the work they are not worth it.

Absolutely amazing. My guests were beyond impressed, making the lengthy prep time worthwhile. i did spice up the sauce just a bit, and made the rolls entirely the night before. just brushed and popped them in the oven as needed. if you can find larger sheets of phyllo, it's worth it.

These looked beautiful and guests devoured them. I made the chicken filling the night before (minus the egg and nuts--added them just before rolling). It was my first experience with phyllo too; it was tricky at first but once I got the hang of it, not too bad. I did what someone else suggested and added the cinnamon to the butter--good idea. The sauce, though delicious, wasn't spicy at all--not sure why. Would have liked a bit more spice. I wonder if the whole thing could be made in advance (baked too) and then reheated. Overall a great recipe.

This is one of the most visually appealing appetizers that I've prepared, and it was a big hit with the party guests. The sauce is a must, it got as many raves as the rolls. Phyllo can be difficult to work with, this time I put a sheet of freezer paper (wax paper would probably work just as well) between the damp towel and the phyllo and this helped a lot. This phyllo recipe was actually easier than others I've tried because there is less cutting of the phyllo involved. I also used 9x14 sheets so I didn't end up with as many rolls as the recipe said because I needed more filling per roll, so you may want to increase the amount of chicken. Next time I will probably replace the 1/2 cup of water with more chicken broth, and will increase all of the spices in the filling.

Rating: 3
Have made this twice and found that adding the cinammon to the butter before layering the phyllo made a more even distribution of the spice. Also doubled the amount of nuts. Note: I have found that thawing the dough in the fridge 24 hours before use, makes separating the layers much easier. Quick thaw may result in soggy layers that are stuck together. My guests loved the spicy tomato sauce.

These were absolutely delicious. They came out of the oven and were just perfect and the texture was great! Like buttah. HOWEVER: this was my first experience with phyllo, and it was INCREDIBLY frustrating. Most of the dough went in the garbage (a box of 28 sheets) as half the sheets were stuck together after defrosting and kept ripping, and most of the rest dried out despite the towel & plastic wrap, and kept ripping as i slathered butter on them. A really great dish, but I don't have the room to work with this dough, and my apartment is too dry. That, and I threw a cutting board halfway across the apartment in utter frustration and almost killed the cat. No more phyllo for me. :(

Very well received at a party. While the recipe seems time consuming, it can be made in stages. I used phyllo sheets that were 9x14, so I didn't cut in half. Also, I used more chicken.

Each stack of two sheets are halved making 8. Each roll is then cut into 4 pieces. 4 X 8 = 32.

Can anyone explain the calculations of this recipe? 8 sheets = two per 1/4 cup fillng, cut in half to make 7 rolls? 7x4 pairs of sheets yields 28 rolls, not 32 I don't get it
