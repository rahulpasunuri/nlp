Great recipe. Used 1% milk and think it would even work with skim as long as the cooking times are adhered to. Needs a little jazzing up. I added some gorgonzola and a little crushed red pepper. Even the kids loved it and it didn't feel sinful.

This creamed spinach recipe is classic and timeless. Make sure to use good quality parmesan (NOT the stuff from a can, if you can help it!). It makes all the difference.

Rating: 2
This was ok. My husband loved it, I liked it - hence the 3 stars. This was my first time eating Creamed Spinach - so I didn't have anything to compare it with. I thought it was a little bland - although I don't think I would make this again, if I would I would add garlic, peppercorns, maybe some chili flakes. Not sure...

Delicious. Followed the recipe exactly. Served it on pan roasted ribeye steaks. Nothing better!

Simply delicious! restaurant quality recipe. Goes great with steak! Make sure that when you are whisking the cream you get it really thick and that you squeeze all of the water out of the spinach. Goes great with the blue cheese crusted steak recipe on this site!

Rating: 4
I have an excellent, if not unique variation on the theme, for the more adventurous cook. Add a 1/2 tsp of vanilla, 2 tbsp of blue cheese (or something similarly strong) and omit the nutmeg. You may have to add extra salt to balance the vanilla. Absolutely delicious, probably the best dish i've made in months.

I love creamed spinach! What has stopped me from making it myself is that there were so many recipes to choose from I ended up unable to decide which to use and always ended up moving on to something else. This Thanksgiving I tried this recipe because the reviews were so good I figured how could it be bad? It was just awful and tasteless. I added more parmesan cheese, it didnt help. Tried more salt and pepper¬ any better, added butter&nothing made this recipe taste great. I couldnt throw it out after cutting up all of that spinach so I went and bought a Stoffers spinach soufflé and mixed it in. May be awhile before I try another creamed spinach recipe.

I've made this before cooking the spinach beforehand. This time I followed others advice of just adding to the cream sauce but found that I had to reduce the liquid, which overcooked the spinach. Would go back to the original recipe.

This recipe was pretty good. I would say that it's not as great as the creamed spinach where real cream is used but it also doesn't leave you feeling as guilty afterwards. Made it exactly as the recipe stated.

What I loved about this was that you don't have to cook the spinach first. Just fold it into the sauce until it heats up. We love shallots, used that instead of onion and added garlic.

terrific! used up some light cream, the rest was skim milk, and was generous w/the cheese and nutmeg (and a little cayenne). like other reviewers, I just wilted the raw spinach in the sauce -- you really can fit it all in there! came out divine. will make again soon.

Very good. Used the leftovers to make a delicious cream of spinach soup - added some chicken broth, a litte more milk, and some sour cream.

Rating: 4
This was delicious, creamy, and quite low-fat compared to other creamed spinach recipes. I even used 1% milk and came out with a very thick sauce. Like others, I wilted the spinach in the sauce rather than pre-cooking it, which worked beautifully. Will make many times.

We didn't add quite enough spinach to the recipe (we ended up buying stuff and looking up a recipe later), but ended up with a fantastic spinach cheese dip with some Blue Corn chips. We'll definately be making this again.

Really delicious as a layer in the braised lamb shanks shepherd's pie. I doubled the recipe, as other reviewers recommended to make more, and also tried to add the spinach uncooked to the sauce. It did not take as much spinach as the recipe called for; however, probably due to the uncooked spinach having more surface are to cover. I also may have cooked the sauce a little past the recommended time, making it extra thick. Would recommend making a bit more sauce or using a little less uncooked spinach, which really is a time saver. Plus the spinach held up really well when it was layered between the roasted carrots and the mashed potatoes in the pie. Heavenly!

very tasty. i did not find it necessary to boil the spinach first- i just made up the white sauce and added the raw spinach to it and then wilted it right in the sauce. the next day i heated it up in the oven with a little more parmesean on top and had a great spinach dip.

This was delicious! I made this as a side to a steak dinner. I like that it's simple, because sometimes food tastes better that way. But, because it's so basic, you can also dress it up any way you want.

I would definately make this again with some variations included. I sauteed onions and garlic before hand and wilted the spinach in chicken broth instead of water. Added cream instead of milk. Also added more parmesian than the recipe called for, as well as fresh bacon bits.

The best part about this dish it that it can be baked, so it isn't as labor intensive as some other creamed spinach recipies I have made...which is perfect for entertaining (..that is, if you are a host who likes to spend as much time out of the kitchen once guests have arrived)! I prepared my spinach a day before and just kep it in the fridge, and then just put the ingredients together 30 seconds before I baked it!

Will definitely make again. Cooking for two so I cut the spinach in half and used the low fat cream of mushroom soup. came out GREAT. I have to think that two packages would just be too dry.

Rating: 3
This was tasty, and eaten happily by a bunch of non-vegetable-eaters. I thought the spinach taste got sort of lost here, however. Next time I will make it by just wilting the spinach briefly in the water clinging to it from washing. I also would reserve the squeezed-out cooking liquid and substitute it for an equal amount of milk in the sauce.

I'd give this a 2.5. It's a nice quick side dish. It's tasty, but nothing to garner rave reviews. I used 1% milk and it would probably be much better with whole milk.

This was nothing to write home about. Very bland even adding twice the amount of cheese. I also think there's too much onion in this. I made two separate batches of this on Thanksgiving, using fresh spinach for one and frozen for the other. The frozen was better.

Rating: 4
Terrific dish and received great reviews at Thanksgiving dinner. I tripled this recipe to make it and used 1/2 frozen chopped spinach and 1/2 fresh baby spinach. I also followed some of the previous suggestions and substituted about 1/4 of the amount of milk required with sour cream and also added a little more parmesan than was called for. Don't forget to the add the salt to the cream mixture just before combining it with the spinach, without it it may be very bland. Delicious.

Rating: 3
Cleaning and preparing fresh spinach was an unnecessary hassle. Frozen spinach would work well. Use a potato ricer to squeeze out excess water after cooking; it works great! I'd add more Parmesan, but this is excellent

I am a big creamed spinach fan, but found this version to be very bland and unappealing. It tasted like one of those flavorless "light" versions that unsuccessfully imitates the real thing. I had to do a lot of doctoring to get the dish to be palatable.

I thought this side dish was very good. I did add a few different ingredients. I added mushrooms to the onion while they simmered. Then I took about 1/4 of the milk and subsituted it with sour cream. My kids even liked it. My husband doesn't like spinach and he commented on how good it was! Will make it again!

I made this as a green side dish for thanksgiving. It was a huge hit! Second only to the butter-laden sweet potatos with pecans. I followed suggestions and cranked up the fresh cheese (romano worked well), used a little more onion, and sprinkled a "healthy" amount of bacon on the top. I also (unintentionally) cut down on the amount of spinach. I tried to triple the recipe (there were 13 adults in attendence), but by the time I got to 6 out of the 8 bags of spinach, I had more than enough.

This creamed spinach was wonderful. It worked great in the sheperd's pie as well as on its own. I made it a day in advance and tasted it before putting it in the refrigerator -- I had to hurry up and put it away so I wouldn't eat it all before making the pie! Next time I'll try Paul's advice and see how it is with the bacon, but it was still delicious "as is."

I am not sure why this recipie received so many rave reviews. This is the first time I had cream spinach. I would make it again but I felt it lacks something. The cream sauce is a little bland.

I have never tasted creamed spinach better than this one. I wouldn't change a thing. The other reviewers mentioned some nice additions which I am sure would make for a pleasant change, but this recipe stands on its own very well. I used the pre-washed baby spinach found alongside pre-packaged salads sold in most supermarkets. A very quick, easy recipe.

It's amazing to see that people can still be so judgemental and blind based on packaging and not look past it to the message within. Please stop looking down your noses long enough to possibly see that 'Paul' DOES offer a variation on the recipe at hand. So he explains it in a different and, frankly, more creative way. Isn't what this area is for? Offering suggestions? If you're so afraid to think out of the box, what are you doing on a website whose purpose is to give and share new ways of doing things?

I'm with the people who think "Paul"'s reviews are more obnoxious than most that appear here. However, I have to believe that they're a joke--possibly by a linguist or psychologist who wants to play with our minds! No one could possibly write the things "Paul" does with any degree of seriousness.

Listen up, Epicurious, y'all gots to understand... Bacon. That's right, y'all. That sweet, sweet meat from our friend down the street. My moms made the BOMB spinach when we was shorties and she added bacon in there with the onion. Hell, even use da same pan. Use it and never lose it. This is Gina's favorite thing Paul makes. Well, this and something else. What up, y'all!!!! Try it with da bacon and I agree, don't skimp out on da' cheese at the end. Take my advice, don't stop to think twice just make the spinach nice.

I tried to rate this recipe the other day, but I must have goofed up because I don't see my review -- so I will try again. This recipe is great. For those who have panned it, you either made it wrong or you just don't like creamed spinach. I thought the recipe really brought out the flavor of the baby spinach and the touch of parmigiano reggiano really set it off beautifully (don't go heavy on the cheese, though, just follow the recipe). Each of my guests commented on how good this dish was. I made it with half and half, which was incredibly rich; next time, I am going to use just milk as described in the recipe.

I didn't find this creamed spinach to be any better or any worse than any other similar recipe I've tried. I do think we can take previous reviewers comments on simplifying the recipe one step further and avoid the par-boiling or par-steaming all together. Just eliminate the entire first paragraph of the recipe. Baby spinach will "melt" down and cook in the sauce within minutes with a few good turns using a set of tongs. I also liked the idea of adding a couple spoonfuls of asiago cheese at the end.

Rating: 2
This recipe was not as good as I had hoped based on the many positive comments. I did have to use regular spinach, as the grocery store in my VERY rural area did not have any baby spinach available that day. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I will try this recipe one more time using baby spinach in the hopes that it will turn out better.

I made this dish from memory after reading it on the site. I was not too sure of all the measurements but since I usually cook by taste and touch it did not matter too much. Going back and looking at the recipe I was pretty right on. I added a little extra cheese (Asiago) and used less milk,substituting some sour cream (about 1/2 a cup?) It came out delicious! I served it to my husband along with a simple omlet and some potatoes sauteed with mushrooms and peppers.

This is a versatile recipe. It is easy to prepare, tasty to eat. With half the recommended amount of spinach on hand, I made it anyway but added extra cheese to balance the white sauce.

Will try the recipe again as it is written, but would not hesitate to make the cheese version again.

this was great, easy and not as fattening as other creamed spinach recipes i have come across -- i would definitely NOT cook the spinach as the recipe indicates. i put it in the microwave in a bowl with 1/2 cup of water in the base, covered with plastic (that the spinach came in) and "cooked" for 1.5 minutes. i hate overcooked veggies.

I didn't have anything but frozen spinach on hand and it worked just fine. I added a little extra parmesan because I like that cheesy flavor. Even my husband, the wilted greens hater, ate it without complaints. I enjoyed it a lot. I squeezed the moisture out of the spinach pretty seriously. So, the sauce didn't seem to thin out much at all when I added the spinach. Very yummy and kinda elegant, don't you think?

Agree with the saving of vitamins to wilt the spinach, but for a time saver, can't I just use frozen spinach? Baby spinach is not what I find in the market. Wilting and chopping the spinach takes more time than I want to spend. This recipe is what I've been doing anyway, but I use a thick white sauce because the spinach seems to thin out the medium sauce.

Instead of milk, use the liquid that you get from steaming spinach. Do not rinse in cold water. You are washing away all the nutrients. If you use the steam water, you'll preserve most of the vitamins.
