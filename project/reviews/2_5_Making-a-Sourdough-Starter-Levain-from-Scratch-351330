A cook from Phoenix: try leaving your starter in a wide-mouthed container or bowl, exposed to the air for a couple hours when you first make it. You might just be getting unlucky and the natural yeasts haven't fallen in your starter jar.

This is a good recipe for a starter. Kristin: In my opinion it IS necessary to use Organic ingredients. Wheat that isn't Organic is POISON. All of your bread making ingredients should be Organic. I made my Levain in July 1974 from Organic Rye that I grew and harvested the previous year. My Starter was made using only Whole Rye Meal (Pumpernickel Flour) and water. It was made with freshly ground Sprouted Rye that was purposely left quite coarse. My Levain has "tasted" Wheat, Spelt, Barley, Oats, but because I mostly bake Pumpernickel, it most often tastes Rye. A Cook from Phoenix:I have found that a Levain is much easier to get started during the summer. There is an abundance of wild yeasts during the warmer months. (Your Monsoon Season is the perfect time.) Needless to say, my starter turned 36 last July (2010) and has it's own unique qualities that make it my own signature taste. I prefer using real spring water. I always bring home 10 gallons or so from the Catskill Region of upstate NY when I go home to visit friends. There are an abundance of excellent springs throughout that area. Incidentally, my "wild yeast strain" was born in Fredonia N.Y. has lived in California for 10 years and has been living in Virginia since 1986. Peace!

Wondering if it's crucial to use organic flour's?

I read elsewhere that the white flour should be added gradually, so that on day 3, the first feeding will be 1/4 c. bread flour and 1/4 c. rye, with each successive feeding containing less rye until the feeding is all bread or AP flour. This worked for me. I also aerated the starter by stirring it a few times each day, especially when it was looking dead. That seemed to perk it up. Also, mine started to ferment quite nicely at 65 to 68 degrees, which was good because that's the range of the temps in my house this time of year. It was harder keeping the starter in a warmer environment after the initial stage.

Are you using sink water? I just tried this using bottled water, and it's going pretty well. On the fourth feeding now.

I've made several of the bread receipes with great results, but making this starter has completely stumped me! I think my troubles lie in how I'm mixing in the daily additions of flour and water (days 3,4,5). Can you give a bit more detail as to how this should be added? Stirred carefully, dumped in and left alone? Mixed carefully? Any help would really be appreciated. Otherwise, I've tried making this starter four times now with no luck.
