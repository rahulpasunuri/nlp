This recipe was delicious! I was forced to change ingredients a little: instead of onion I used anise. I also had to use 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper in place of chili paste. It had just enough bite, and the flavors mixed perfectly. The recipe served four peo0ple easily. I put this dish in my recipe box right away.

I only rated this recipe as 3 forks because I felt that it benefited from some modification. Adding cranberries instead of raisins was perfect. I added more serrano pepper than recommended. I also added a habanero pepper to the mix. It adds some smouldering heat to balance the punch of serrano. I used red bell pepper instead of green and Kalamata olives instead of green olives. I also omitted the cloves (which I didn't miss). I also recommend using a portion of the serrano pepper and garlic (planed,not just peeled) while browning the chicken (otherwise, it could be bland). Truly flavorful!

Delicious recipe! The rice turned out so flavourful. The chicken was pretty good too, but the rice took top spot, for me anyways. This recipe minus the chicken would make an excellent side dish if you happen not to have any chicken on hand. For some heat I just used a few splashs of peri peri sauce and it gave it the perfect type of heat. Will make again forsure.

Very good. Didn't have bell peppers but didn't miss them. Added cubed sweet potatoe per another cook's review. Used Calrose rice which was good but took more broth. Used boneless skinless thighs. Heat from the sambal omelek was perfect. Will make this again for sure.

used garlic chili sauce since that's what I had, added sundried tom's, currants since I didn't have raisins, baby bell peppers along with some roasted red peppers, and cut the olives down a bit so my husband wouldn't complain. I also tossed on some ancho chili powder across the top. really flavorful I thought and I'll make again.

I like this one, but I use chopped, dried apricots instead of raisins and boneless skinnless chicken breasts. I also usually omit the peppers and it's still a hit!

I LOVE the rice, so I always double the rice and then just have rice for leftovers. I omit the olives, use dried cranberries instead of raisins, and use three scotch bonnets because I like it hot! I also often use water instead of stock because I don't usually have stock on hand and I find this works fine.

I was pretty disappointed by this actually. I used a low salt chicken broth as suggested, and think maybe needed more seasoning.

Although this recipe is easy to throw together and can easily use whatever you have on hand, it is very bland and fairly greasy if prepared as written. With 2 teenage boys in the house, I can get away with almost anything, but even they refused seconds on this!

Excellent! Used 1/4 of the hot chili paste. A keeper - my husband really likes it.

I know this is going to sound crazy...but I love this dish and have made it a bunch of times. But recently, something happened that took it to the next level. I was over at a family member's house and she made baked sweet potatoes for me to take home (have no idea why, but I was appreciative). They came home with me became a side dish for my Spicy Chicken and Rice leftovers. And soon...they creeped into the dish. It was an amazing contribution. One of those things that shouldn't work...but somehow elevated the whole thing.

I've made this a few times now, each time slightly different. Doubled the sambal oelek, added a few more cloves of garlic (they're really nice!), and included some green peppers. Good, easy, one pot recipe!

Rating: 3
I would agree with earlier reviewers that this needs a little boost. I made it per the recipe and my husband and I loved the flavor but thought it needed more of it. Next time I will double the vegetables and seasonings while leaving the rice amount the same. I will also add some chopped dried apricots to the vegetables and sprinkle some slivered almonds on before serving. I think this would make this recipe fabulous.

So good and easy to make. I love a one dish meal. I doubled the recipe but shouldn't have doubled the rice. It makes way too much.

This was excellent, very good. Used boneless skinless chicken thighs with great results. Thanks to other reviewers, cut the rice down to 1 cup and adjusted the broth. Plenty of rice. Left all the seasoning intact, adding a little more hot chili past because some like it hot. Closer to 3 1/2 forks than three...

Excellent recipe and very tasty. Used Italian rice for risotto and it turned out perfect. Substituted dried chillies and added a few sun dried tomatoes. And at the very end crumpled some blue cheese on the now risotto.

Not bad at all, and very easy. I roasted all of my peppers, so used those, and had some Paella rice and used that instead as well. I used about 2 Teaspoons chili paste, and held the olives out until most of the stock had cooked off. I did end up adding quite a lot of water as the stock was cooking off quickly and the rice wasn't cooking along with it. Turned out quite nice, spicy and sweet.

This was excellent! Fast and easy to make and unique flavors that were unexpectedly good! I used 6 boneless chicken thighs and the chicken to rice ratio was okay.

This was very good. Recipe makes too much rice for four people. I made recipe with ingredients as called for except I only used 1 cup of rice but doubled the chile paste. It was not too spicy and the chicken and rice was perfectly flavored.

I have made this multiple times and just love the complex flavor from so few ingredients. You could actually use twice the amount of chicken and still have a good chicken/rice ratio.

Fantastic! I substituted chinese five spice for the cloves, and doubled the garlic. My husband, who usually thinks chicken with rice of any kind is boring, absolutely loved this dish.

Quite good and not too much work. The rice was really tasty. I used red curry paste and spicy olives from my stores "olive bar"...I still maybe would make it spicier next time.

This made a TON of food for two. You could probably, easily, serve 6 to 8 with this! My guess is that it would even be crockpot or pressure cooker friendly!

Very good and really really easy. I used a serrano chile, but would use two next time. The cloves were a great touch. I also will add more raisins and perhaps a bit of the olive brine next time. Yum!

This is a good weeknight dinner - - I've made it 2x now and made a few changes to suit my family's tastes, like quadrupling the garlic (some minced, some sliced) and also browning the chicken with some of it; and used about 2x the olives (moroccan cured was all I had) . Also used boneless skinless thighs + chicken drumsticks instead of whole thighs. I think the tastes of the dish are wonderful. What I don't like about the recipe is that it takes about 40 minutes to cook, b/c the rice grains get unevenly cooked - some are mushy and some are too hard. Maybe next time I will just place the chicken on top of the rice instead of "pressing" it into the rice, so the grains get the maximum contact with the broth. Oh, I added about 1 1/2 tsp. of the sambal - - I thought 1 tsp would be too tame and I was wrong! Good thing we can take it hot.

My husband and I love this dish -- I'm making it tonight for the 4th time. I use my Pampered Chef chopper, so it's especially quick and easy. A generous amount of Sambal Ooleek means I don't have to deal with prepping chilis and the dish has a nice kick. I also use quick cooking brown rice to make it a bit healthier, and 6-8 chicken thighs. It does need to cook longer with brown rice, but the chicken thighs are still juicy.

Rating: 2
One word - boring! For all of the spices/additions, this meal came out totally plain and not spicy at all. The chicken was good, though, and it was a fast easy way to prepare chix/rice. Next time I might just use pre-seasoned Spanish rice with saffron.

great recipe! I've made this multiple times now and i love the flavors. I'm not a very experienced cook (i'm from new york and trying to eat less takeout), so one dish recipes are great. I added some more olives because I love the flavor and I used 2 serano peppers instead of chili paste because i couldn't find it in the grocery store. Lots of chopping, but well worth it!

So simple, yet so good! My husband (who cooks) couldn't believe how few ingredients were in this. The flavor is relatively complex.

Rating: 3
This dish was easy and tasted really good. The flavor of cooking the rice with chicken stock really adds an extra layer of flavor that stands up really nicely to the heat of the chili paste. My husband and I love spicy foods, so we added way more of the chili paste. The combinations of the olives and raisins gave the dish a moroccan feel. Great dish for a weeknight dinner...and great as leftovers!

I thought this dish was great. We went to Morocco last year and as I was cooking this and smelling all the flavors it reminded of Morocco and it's wonderful food. I used 1 serrano chili and it gave it just the right kick. I don't understand how people can call this mediocre. It is a wonderful recipe to "tweak" in different ways.

I like spicey foods so the only change I would consider making is adding more of the chili paste. Otherwise a FANTASTIC and easy dish.

One of our favorite quick chicken recipes. My boys love it and ask me to make it all the time. I usually double the recipe so they can take some home since it reheats beautifully in the oven.

ya'll in Dallas are hysterical and not very smart. If you had read carefully the recipe calls for ground CLOVES! Duh! If you read my review carefully it said I DID NOT HAVE ground cloves so I smartly substituted another non-weird spice, ginger, for the cloves. Smart cooks know how to tweak a recipe including using 3 cloves of garlic instead of 2 because I like garlic. Also Dallas if you want to leave a comment make the dish and then rate it. ya'll must be crazy! I am making this again this week.

ya'll are so funny. The recipe doesn't call for "cloves" but 2 GARLIC cloves. And ya'll are substituting ginger and other wierd spices for the "cloves". how funny. Read carefully.

My husband ate almost all of this himself. Easy preparation. Used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and substitued unchopped capers for the olives. Capers provide a better flavor. Didn't have ground cloves, used ground ginger instead. Veru good. I used 3 large cloves of garlic, smashed, and 1 tbsp. of chili paste.

Chicken and rice. Yeah, that's about it. Nothing special -- certainly no "kick."

Rating: 2
Eh. This wasn't great. There was certainly no kick, as in the description, but I like spicy food. I couldn't find golden raisins, so I used black. The chicken had a weird, greasy flavor. Maybe I did something wrong...it just wasn't great.

I was really looking forward to the combination of olives and raisins, but the brininess cooked out of the olives, and the rest of the dish was pretty much just arroz con pollo--okay, but far from interesting.

This was a terrific combination of flavors - I used sriracha in place of the chili paste (it was what I had in the fridge) and it was delicious. It's not quite special enough to serve to company, but it's a perfect weeknight dinner.

I have enjoyed the unique combination of green olives and raisins before, so was interested to see how the sambal oelek would combine with them...we were very impressed. I was out of golden raisins so used currents instead and a little more garlic than called for. Put extra sambal oeleck on table for my heat lovin hubby, but he didn't use, so guess it had plenty of heat plus flavor. Served with steamed sugar snap peas with a tad bit of butter and a crisp sauv blanc.

The olives and raisins take this from a mundane chicken and rice dish to borderline gourmet! Watch the rice closely - I had melted raisins in the bottom of the pot...

Actually, I am delighted to be the first reviewer of this marvelous recipe. So simple, so scrumptious. After a full week at work, I prepared this dish in roughly 20 minutes, then it cooked on its own for about 30 minutes, which gave me time to unwind before settling down to Friday night dinner with a good movie and a bottle of Dombeya, a fine South African cabernet.
