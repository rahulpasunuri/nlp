Everyone loved this at Thanksgiving sans the squash (we were already having a butternut squash soup). I added a chopped shallot to the pancetta fat and sauteed for a moment before adding the cranberries.

I had to subsitute hazelnuts for the chestnuts. Two differnt stores were out. (I'll plan ahead next time.) I made this reciepe (sub hazelnuts) for three holiday gatherings in 3 days. I selected it on the advise of the other cook who made the components and then transported it piecemeal. I served it for a luncheon at my home with a squash soup instead of adding the squash. It was also big success. Great for the holidays.

Really delicious and unusual, this salad was a perfect addition to the Thanksgiving meal. I made the components and then transported it piecemeal to my mother-in-law's and it was a big success--elegant and not heavy.

This was well worth the effort. The colors, textures and flavors were unusual and interesting. It was an excellent accompaniment to the bold flavor of a smoked ham.
