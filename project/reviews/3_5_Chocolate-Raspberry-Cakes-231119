Made this cake many times. Always a crowd pleaser. I use high quality chocolate bars, and the dark chocolate taste is great. Top it with good vanilla bean ice cream. Simple enough that my son has made it many times!

These wowed my book club, and everyone thanked the member who can't eat wheat. They took about 10 minutes longer to cook. Next time I'll try using convection.

Not impressive! Maybe a previous reviewer is right & I did something wrong, but this is a pretty easy recipe & I am pretty experienced baker. The chocolate flavor is strong, the texture is just off. Mine was not smooth, more eggy, I don't know, but it wasn't good. The raspberry flavor came through in the batter but not at all in the final product. Oh well. I will not repeat.

I divided this recipe to a fourth of its original size and used a dash of almond extract. The only chocolate i've got lyin around is ghiradelli's 60%, all wrapped up individually. So I broke out 5.5 little packets. I think a little less butter would've worked out just fine. perhaps a little more raspberry preserve to bring out the flavor, if you so desire. otherwise, i poured it into four little cupcake cups and it made a spectacular little dessert with some vanilla bean ice cream. Though i think some freshly whipped cream might be have made a better partner.

I followed the recipe and had no problem with it at all. Very delicious and easy to make. I used glass dishes from Pampered Chef which worked perfectly. Anyone who had a problem with the recipe may have overmelted the chocolate which can burn easily if not careful. One of the best ways to melt chocolate is to put it in a bowl over a pot of simmering water to melt without burning.

For those who are true flourless chocolate cake lovers, this is heaven! I made this for a co-worker's birthday, and tweaked it just a little bit. Instead of making individual cakes, I poured the batter into a 9-inch cake pan, and baked it for 35 minutes on 325 degrees. That was the perfect amount of time. But a word of advice for anyone else who wants to make 1 large cake: cut out a circle of parchment paper that will fit into the bottom of your pan! Eventhough I buttered the pan, I couldn't get it to flip onto a plate. So, I had to serve it right out of the cake pan. Apparently no one seemed to mind; 4 of us polished it off before lunchtime! (I felt kind of bad because someone else made cupcakes, and I think they're all still in the fridge!)

This is a quick delicious recipe. They are great for a impromptu dinner party. I cooked them on convection @ 325 for suggested time and they turned out perfect.

I have known Larry to create nothing but delicious entreés ever since I met him in 1974. This is a fine example of his work. Glad you're still using those talents, Larry!

These are easy enough, but the fudgy raspberry bars on this site are way better.

Very easy. Made it non-dairy, using margarine, and still liked it. Needed extra time, added about another 10 minutes at 360, as was completely liquidly still after 20 minutes at 325. My daughter who professes not to like chocolate ate hers entirely.

Very easy. Found it was way too soft baking at 325 for 20 minutes. Increased temp to 360 and baked another 10 minutes. Inside was still soft. Made it non-dairy, using margarine, and still very nice. For real chocolate lovers, very rich. However, my daughter, who professes not to like chocolate, ate her all up.
