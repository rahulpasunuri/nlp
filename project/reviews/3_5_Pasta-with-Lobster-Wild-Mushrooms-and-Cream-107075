This was a simple and elegant dish (and expensive). I used fresh lobster tails, and just sauteed them a bit in butter and continued with the rest of the recipe. Personally I will double the amount of mushrooms next time.

This was very good. It does not need added thickener as previous reviewer said. If you use good quality heavy whipping cream and don't skimp on the amount of cream or butter, it thickens just fine (took about 10 minutes). I did simmer the mushrooms in the clam juice until it was reduced by about a third before adding the cream. I did take other's suggestion to add freshly grated nutmeg, also some fresh lemon zest. It needs salt and fresh ground pepper. But otherwise, the pasta was good. I don't think it needed a whole lot more. I used grilled shrimp. I will make this again with my changes.

I made this dish, It was excellent but had to spice it up a little. I used 1.5# of 10 count shrimp, red pepper flakes, parsley, sun dried tomatoes, 1 garlic clove minced and a spalsh of lemon juice. I did not use the 8oz of clam juice, instead only about 2 or 3 Tbls.The parsley was added on top of the cheese just before serving. Use the pepper to taste. Being a pepper head myself I did use enough to give this some kick. OK I know I made more than a few changes but it was great this way. The next time I think I might try adding just a touch of nutmeg to the cream sauce?

I made a few changes that ended up working out really well. I steamed the lobster and used the remaining broth instead of the clam juice. I used tequila for flavor. Corn starch to thicken the sauce and added some pecorino romano cheese...delicious!

Rich but bland. I added some red pepper flakes to kick it up a bit. And, I can't believe no one else said this in prior reviews, the sauce needs a little thickening. Way too soupy so will make again but incorporate a roux into the cream.

An excellent recipe - I made this with shrimp rather than lobster. Also I subsititued tarragon for the basil based on other reviews that the recipe was bland - the tarragon was excellent in the recipe. Also I substituted shallots for green onion (what I had on hand) and dry white wine for the clam juice. I was only able to get fresh oyster mushrooms and they worked very well in the dish - an excellent recipe that impressed my guests - this is definitley a keeper!

Substituted shrimp for the lobster, excellent results. This is my wife's favourite request for special occasions when I cook for her.

We really loved this! The only changes were that I used parsley instead of basil and button mushrooms instead of shitake. I did throw in a pinch of red pepper flakes. It took a little longer than suggested to thicken the sauce. But I will make it again and send the recipe along to friends.

As suggested, I used 1/2 cup cream sherry (that's been in my cupboard since who knows when!!) instead of the clam juice, and 1 2/3 cups 2% milk instead of cream. Received RAVE reviews, and I loved it, too!

Easy and flavorful. I used white wine instead of clam juice, shallots instead of green onions and crimini shrooms just 'cause that's whay I had on hand. Turned out with a beautiful flavor that didn't overpower the delicacy of the lobster meat. Yummy. Will definitely make again.

I made this recipe the night I proposed to my newly aquired fiance and we loved it. I did make a few changes however and it was good beyond compare. First change, I used Shrimp AND Lobster. I bought a half pound of shrimp and shelled them, deveined, and then cut them into cubes. Just have the shrimp follow the lobster throughout the recipe, also consider the precooked bagged shrimp so that they will get done at the right time. Also, an hour and a half before cooking I added the shrimp (already cut) to a baggy, marinated them with one lemon and one lime hand squeezed into the bag in the fridge. When the shrimp is added make sure that it is spread evenly around the walls of your pan with the lobster in the middle. Give a second lemon and lime a squeeze into the pan, gives it a really good flavor in the end. Now some ingrediant changes: I increased the butter to 6 1/2 tablespoons. I changes the mushrooms from shitake to regular mushrooms in a jar (drained before putting in). On this one just follow the recipes time limit of 5 minutes. For the Seasoning, I used regular off the shelf italian seasoning and about 2 tablespoons of basil all adding up to 1/4 cup. I reduced the whipping cream to just one of the shelf carton. and for the rest just follow the recipe, it came out fantasic and I will make it again and again. Many thanks to the original creator for helping me out with my very special night!

I will make this again, but next time I will eat the lobster tail whole and have the mushroom sauce on the pasta as a side dish. Why waste your time picking around in sauce looking for the lobster? I want my lobster and eat it too!

Love it! Made this for our anniversary, so we splurged for a jumbo lobster tail and it was so worth it. Very rich, but hey, that's what special occasions are for. The butter looked really black after I'd cooked the lobster (don't know if I had the temp too high?), so I wiped the pan down and used fresh butter. I also subbed some sherry for half the clam juice, but other than that followed the recipe exactly. It was pretty easy considering how great the result was. Thanks.

I made it with shrimp and it was Fantastic. This is one of those recipes that tastes like you've been working on it for hours, when in reality, 30 minutes tops ! It could not have been easier! Made it just as written - I didn't/don't see a need to change a thing!

Rating: 4
Outstanding! Like several others, I chose to omit the clam juice, and instead used very dry sherry. I made it for Christmas Eve dinner, and my six-year-old (who rarely eats a meal without complaining about some part of it) loved it. The only down side is that it's too expensive (not to mention too rich!) to make regularly, but this will definitely be a special-occasion mainstay at our house!

Made this with slipper lobster meat (Trader Joe's is the best!) and shiitake mushrooms, reserved a little of the mushroom "water" for the sauce, I love the flavor of shiitakes. Very close to a dish called Lobster Garlic Noodles from my fav restaurant. Didn't add the green onions though, just didn't seem to fit well with this.

I didn't have any clam juice, so I made broth from the lobster shells and used that instead. Also, I used both crimini and shitake mushrooms, substituted tarragon for the basil, used 2% milk instead of whipping cream, and used one chopped shallot instead of the green onions. This was a scrumptious dish!

I made this last night for my husband and I and we absolutley loved it. I halved the recipe and it was still enough for 3 generous servings or 4 average servings. I used more lobster, green onions, and garlic than called for and substituted fat-free half & half for the cream and it was wonderfully flavorful. Although the result is VERY entertaining worthy, it is a last minute recipe so it would be difficult to pull off and still enjoy your guests. I served this with a simple salad.

Let's ignore the lunatics and they'll go away. Frozen lobster tails... I purchased what they had in the first store, two 16 oz bags which was a bit of work, but I wasn't sorry. I did spot sets of two larger tails in a second store, for 50% more per pound. I rate this 4 forks because my picky eaters went for seconds and thirds and, hello, isn't that what we're trying to do?

My husband loved this dish! I made it with the lobster, which is a little expensive, but I'm also going to try next time with shrimp. The only complaint was when the leftover sauce was reheated, the lobster was tough. Since there are only two of us, next time I may try halving it.

While cooking this dish, my live lobster grabbed my finger in his claw, and threatened that he would snip it off unless I got onto the internet to spread his message. He wanted everyone to know that being boiled alive is a cruel and painful death, and to please stop. I let him take the finger, then I threw him in the pot -- I really love lobster!

To the cook from Boston: From http://www.wineloverspage.com/wineadvisor/tsfl020124.phtml -- "Bear in mind that seafood risotto should remain a bit of liquid at serving time ... Also note that, although Plotkin suggests grated cheese as an option, Italians generally don't use cheese on seafood dishes." No need to call me a "food snob." LIKE I SAID, take it with a grain of salt. I was just trying to explain where the idea may have come from.

Well, I thought this was a great recipe! I've never heard of such silly things as "no seafood with cheese" or "no seafood with cream." My goodness--many wonderful dishes could not have been created if we all thought in such a manner. And even though my frozen lobsters had their little lobster mouths contorted in pain when I thawed them (what brave soul first thought of eating these things?), I did not have an ethical crises when I ate them later: I had seconds. Also, to the cook who heard her lobsters screaming: I always thought that was the sound of the boiling water whistling through their bodies, somewhat like a teapot. Not that that's much better. Perhaps next time I will try shrimp. In my experience with shrimp (fresh and frozen), I have yet to hear a peep out of them.

Lobster tails are indeed NOT cray fish, but lobster! I used to live in Pensacola, Florida where the lobster they brought could be upwards of 4-5 pounds. On occasion, I saw lobster tails topping out at 1 1/2 pounds. Oh, and to the cook who would have been deep fried for putting dairy with seafood... get over yourself and open up to new things. Some of the best shrimp, fish, etc. I have ever had have had cream or cheese in it. I bet you refuse to drink red wine with fish too, huh.

We often work lat and seek out "quick and easy" recipies that have "substance' to help us relax at the end of the day. This is definitely a keeper as it took only 30 min from the door to the table (assisted by a nice cold Martini) we substituted the lobster with raw devined large(not jumbo but larger than the "cocktail" variety)shrimp and added some brandy to the sauce. As I said, a keeper and will make again this weekend for some guests!

I made this recipe in Maine this past weekend using 2 whole fresh lobsters (drop them head first in a full pot of BOILING water, or put them to sleep first by holding them upside down and then drop them in). The recipe was excellent! Very easy to make once you had the lobster meat, and simply delicious.

It took awhile, but I finally got to the source of all the griping. I didn't think the cook from Stowe Vt. was trying to make trouble. I for one am glad to hear how they handle lobster, so I will be sure to ask that they don't do it in front of me. I wouldn't consider going to a slaughter house, or chicken ranch either. Just stuff I don't need to witness. Get on with cooking!! Oh, and I do plan to try this recipe.

Lobsters have a chain of nerve centres running down the central length (longitudinal midline) of the animal. For sashimi (raw) and broiling (grilling) methods these centres should be destroyed by rapidly cutting through the longitudinal midline (lengthways) of the lobster with a large sharp knife. Two cuts should be made: start in the midline near the tail/chest junction and cut towards the head; from the midline near the tail/chest junction, cut towards the tail. A mallet should be used to force the knife quickly through the animal. After cutting in half (lengthways) the chair of nerve centres at the front end (chest and head) of the lobster should be rapidly removed

Right. And infant boys don't feel circumcision. I'm no PITA fan but I have had live lobster literally scream when stabbed in prep for broiling. That rattled me enough that I simply won't prepare a meal w/ live lobster. Too bad for my husband, right? As for this dish, I like a bit more zest so I added wine and green onions prior to serving.

This will keep me from even trying the recipe and yes, I think it's important to mention such insensitivities.

I thought this was very good - I made it for an anniversary dinner for my husband and me. My only issue was the lobster tail part. I have a seafood store in town, but they wouldn't sell me a tail, only the whole lobster, so I had to have them kill it (since 1) I wasn't going to do it and 2) the recipe called for a non-boiled tail). So, they did (the man at the store literally ripped the tail from the body, leaving the lobster alive and moving, then he ripped off the claws and threw the body in the trash) - it was such a creul, disguting thing to witness, it almost made the recipe unedible. Next time I'll go with frozen tails or shrimp!
