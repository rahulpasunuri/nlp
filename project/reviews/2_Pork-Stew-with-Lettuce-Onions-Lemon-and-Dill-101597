I made this in a crockpot (too hot for the oven) and assembled it the night before, thus marinating the meat and onions overnight. Being diabetic, I substituted Splenda for the sugar. The onions absorbed it, making a delicious contrast with the lemony pork. The lettuce was an interesting touch. Satisfactory but not a family favorite. Fun to make, though.

This was okay, but not worth repeating. I don't want to be too harsh because it's a matter of taste and I don't like cream in this stew. I prefer it with avgolemono - egg and lemon sauce ( BTW I'm not Greek). I also like to add a lot more lettuce than called for and to cook it in strained liquid until tender before adding cream (or whatever) and returning cooked pork to the pot.
