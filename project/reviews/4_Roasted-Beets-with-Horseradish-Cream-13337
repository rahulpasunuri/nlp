This was delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I pulled the large stem out of the leaves and chopped them before cooking.

We didn't like beets much - they taste like dirt to us (yes, I washed them off & peeled them!) But the horseradish cream is exceptional. It tastes like more than the ingredient list would suggest. I plan to use it with meat, fish, baked potatoes, other veggies...

Made with 3 tblsps fresh horseradish, but might try a little bit more to spice it up. I found it a little too sweet and would try it next time with the sour cream instead of the creme fraiche, or a combination of the two. Served with pork tenderloin and my guests liked it on the meat as well as the beets. The greens did not do much for me, I found them tough.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was the surprise hit of dinner. Four people asked me for the recipe. It is now a T- day staple.

This dish was so simple but so delicious. Baking the beets really intensifies the earthy sweetness. I had mexican crema rather than creme fraiche but the result was grand. I could not have imagined by reading the recipe how wonderful it would taste. I was just looking for a sauce for my beets that I baked the day before and I had all the ingredients on hand. Marvelous!

I made this last year at Thanksgiving, and I've been asked to make it again this year. Even guests who thought they did not like beets liked these. This recipe is well balanced and results in a subtly flavorful mix of beets, horseradish and cream. The sautéed greens provide complementary taste, texture and color; don't omit them. A great side dish.

I love beets and this was a great way to prepare them. I increased the horseradish cream by a third and used it as an accompaniment to the Standing Rib Roast on this site, as an option for those who didn't want the au jus. One addition - a little mayonnaise to the cream as the sour cream mixture seemed to need something. I also quartered the beets rather than slicing them. The greens added a nice presentation and were delicious.

Amazing flavours! Unfortunately, my beet leaves were badly wilted and far from nice, so I subbed with rainbow chard which yielded a colourful dish. Loved the horseradish cream! Think it would be a tasty topping for baked potatoes too, especially if served with beef. Instead of chives, I liberally garnished with fresh minced dill as it pairs so well with both beets and chard. Mmmmm, such a delicious and attractive way to make and serve beets which are so often overlooked and underused. Enjoy!

You can roast the beets in foil on the grill if you don't want to heat up your kitchen. Medium beets (or large beets quartered) take about 40 minutes on my gas grill, at the lowest temp. setting (tho I do preheat the grill at the highest temp. for about 5 minutes).

Excellent! My husband is squeamish about purple food but he likes this. The combination of greens and beetroots looks beautiful on the plate. This is a keeper!

This was such a refreshing dish. Beets and horseradish are a wonderful combination. The beets and cream can be made in advance so it makes a great entertaining recipe!!

Who knew beet greens were so tasty? This is a superb recipe, easy and delicious. Definitely a keeper. We'll be eating more beets in the future with this recipe.

I never knew beets could taste so good. The recipe was easy. I substitued plain nonfat yogurt for the sour cream/creme fraiche. Yummy! My husband thought these were the best beets he had ever eaten... even better than his mother's-- and trust me, my MIL is a superb cook.

I made this using beets (no greens) that I had roasted the day before. I sliced them, sauteed in butter, and served with the horseradish cream. Delicious! I served them with the Grilled Garlic Lime Pork Tenderloin, also available on Epicurious.

I made this for Christmas and got rave reviews. Some guests came back for seconds in the beets alone. The sauce makes alot, so scale to your needs. Wonderful!

I made this into a cold salad by skipping the steps with the greens. I combined the sour cream with the horseradish and lemon pepper (instead of lemon peel and pepper) and combined it with the roasted beets. Yummy!

What a great way to serve beets! The beets were tender and firm and the addition of greens and the zippy sauce were perfect!
