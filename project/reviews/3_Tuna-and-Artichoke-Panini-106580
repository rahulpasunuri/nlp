flavors were good, and i would add at least 1/2 tsp of lemon juice. could also add some purple onion or shallots to enhance the flavor. used sourdough brused with olive oil and it turned out fine.

This is my new favorite tuna salad recipe. The marinated artichokes and tuna are a great flavor combination. The only change I made was to add a little lemon juice to the tuna/artichoke mix, which I think brightens the flavor a bit and takes out any fishy taste. I made this for a large family gathering and everyone wanted to know which Italian restaurant catered it. (Even my super-picky NYC fashionista sister-in-law law liked it.)

I just served this to my boyfriend for lunch with a side of fresh pink grapefruit segments drizzled with honey. We both loved it! It was quick, easy and delicious. You'd never guess by tasting it that it only took 15 minutes to prepare.

I substituted grilled salmon for turkey. Preferring a chunky salad for the ciabatta, I did not blend the caper-olive, and lemon zest with the mayonnaise, rather combined them and then added the mixture to the artichokes and fish. I topped the sandwich with fresh spinach leaves. Since the ciabatta was huge, I used one roll for one half the salad and made a tall, overflowing sandwich ample for two to split. I'll make this again some time when I have leftover salmon. I think a juicy tomato slice would add to the effect.

We weren't excited about this as a sandwich, but it makes a fabulous potato salad. Don't buy the bread- instead cook 6 red potatoes. Put the rest of the ingredients into a food processor using the mixing blade. Mix for about 1 min. then stir gently into cubed pototoes and chill. Makes a great lunch all by itself.

I know that this recipe is not a culinary masterpiece but the ease of preparation, and because of the delicious results, I rated this 4 forks. Believe it or not I prepared this entire recipe with Trader Joes products. The olive tapenade, marinated artichokes, solid albacore white tuna in olive oil, TJ's mayo, franchese, and an addition of red pepper spread w/ eggplant and garlic. I toasted the franchese, then layered as follows; red pepper spread, tapenade, tuna/artichoke mixture, kosher salt, and freshly ground black pepper, and coaresly minced parsley. I served it open-faced to reduce the carbs. That being said, I know that there are those who would "poo-poo" about not making it from scratch, but believe me, I am a caterer by trade and have worked in the food service biz for years and there is nothing wrong with using prepared products if they are of excellent quality. It's a common practice. Try it my way, I'm certain that you'll enjoy it like I did.

This is my favorite tuna sandwich. I love the flavor combination. Sometimes I leave out the mayo and use straight tapanade. Everyone I've served this to loves it.

Good mix of strong flavors, a very interesting and flavorful combination. It does become a bit too strong as leftovers.

Good but not great. Very filling. I also used Kalamata olives and added some oregano and Greek Feta. Will make again but perhaps as canapés rather than a whole sandwich.

I think if you add a preserved lemon or lime (sold in specialty stores)to the tuna it gives an interesting zesty taste to it!

This looks like it would be very good if ONLY I could save it to my recipe box which is NOT working!!! HELP!

I have made this twice. I think it is a great recipe. I am able to buy hand-packed canned tuna in its natural juices. After draining the tuna, I combine it with the drained artichoke hearts and a splash of olive oil. The color of the mayo was a non-event for me. I used nicoise olives and the mayo appeared the way I thought it should.

This was good. I enjoyed the taste of the tuna & artichoke combination. The color of the mayonaise, however, wasn't appealing. It was very purple, due to processing the olives with the mayonaise. Will mix chopped olives in next time.
