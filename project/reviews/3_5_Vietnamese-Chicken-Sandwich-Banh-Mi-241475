Yummy! Each year I look for new recipes to use the Daikon from my CSA. This one will go into the keeper file for sure. I used ciabatta for the bread,added the veg oil, fish and soy sauces to the slaw (as suggested by other reviewers)and used the leftover pepper from my hot sauce making (master hot sauce on this site) in the place of the jalapenos. The only change I would make in the future is to add some siraycha to the mayo and maybe try some other types of pate (loved the liverwurst by always looking for a new twist).

I loved this! I've only had (many) banh mi from two different restaurants, so I don't have much to compare it to. However, this recipe completely satisfied my cravings. And, while I've generally shied away from liverwurst in my life, it was a great addition to this sandwich. So refreshing and perfect.

Fantastic Banh Mi! Wouldn't change a thing.

No no no! Why would this recipe use liverwurst when it's just as easy to get tinned pate to use (which is the authentic ingredient)? And why would one put fish sauce and soy sauce on the bread? At least the mayo and cilantro are spot-on. As someone married to a Vietnamese man, I'll just keep making them the authentic way, or I'll go get some for $2 each!

I have had the real thing, and I thought this was authentic. The person who criticizes it for having liverwurst in it is being silly. There are banh mi made with liverwurst all over SF, and they are good. In any case, I used some leftover roast duck meat rather than chicken and liverwurst, radish leaves instead of cilantro, and kewpie mayo. This all worked out great. I agree with others that the amount of fish sauce is too much. I reduced to about 1/2 T. I think the kewpie mayo makes a pretty big difference.

Excellent and easy. I would use different bread. Will make it again.

As someone who has never had a Vietnamese bahn mi and therefore was not comparing this to anything, I found it to be an amazingly delicious sandwich! I love all the flavors and the spice of the jalapenos was perfect.

This is a perfectly fine sandwich, but it's nothing whatsoever like a real banh mi. It's as close to a real Vietnamese sandwich as chop suey is to real Chinese food. Why not make the real thing? It's just as easy.

Not even close. Where's the garlic? What's with the liverwurst - so you can use chicken instead of pork? Try the recipe at recipezaar dot com #26412. Just serve sliced jalapenos on side for those who don't like heat.

This was a decent tasting sandwich, however, it did not compare remotely to any Vietnamese sandwiches I have had "out." Also, the daikon/carrot/vinegar combination had a VERY unpleasant, unappetizing odor. I couldn't put my finger on it as none of those ingredients separately smelled bad. I will not be making this again.

We had a Vietnamese sandwich at a little carry-out restaurant in Boston, which we loved and when I saw this recipe I had to make it. It did not disappoint! Yum, yum, yum. We did skip the liverwurst.

Tasty but missing something. Since the Vietnamese takeout has the same thing for less than $3. I wouldn't bother to make it again.

This isn't true recipe, living in San Francisco where there is one on every block, it doesn't taste truly the same. To fix that, make you own mayonasie, make sure all vegetables are picked, and you a sourdough roll.

We had a sandwich similar to this in Boston at a small Vietnamese storefront. We had fond memories of it so I was thrilled to find this recipe. I made it without the liverwurst and it was still excellent - definitely going in the regular rotation.

This tastes exactly like the wonderful Vietnamese sandwich shops (although the traditional Vietnamese version uses roast pork, not chicken - I think the pork tastes better, certainly more authentic). I have loved these sandwiches for years. Don't be tempted to skip or substitute ingredients, especially the cilantro - you will miss the authentic taste that comes from all these flavors blending together. Many people add Hoisin Sauce as a condiment in the restaurants, an addition I strongly recommend!

As has been said, you can leave out the liverwurst, but I always add some siraycha (red vietnamese hot sauce) it was always on these sandwiches when I lived in Hawaii.

This was a great change of pace. Asked my husband if he wanted a sandwich, didn't ask what kind, but I know he loves Braunschweiger. Kept trying to tell how great it was with his mouth full. Bad manners, that boy, but excellent taste. Asks me for it all the time now.

Interesting mix of ingredients. All do-able but had to leave the May(?) out, just seemed...wrong. Great slaw for the sandwich, cut the amount of vinegar, seemed to be a bit much, added cilantro to the slaw. Overall a great idea, workable/tweakable

Don't let the liverwurst or pate turn you off from making this dish...simply leave off that ingredient and you will still have a FABULOUS sandwich. Exceptional copy of the sandwiches I get at my corner Vietnamese deli!

I followed the recipe exactly. An unusual but tasty combination! I found that the liverwurst over- powered much of the other ingrediants so next time I'll use a little less. I may also add the fish sauce & soy sauce to the slaw rather than spread it on the bread as I could not taste either. My whole family loved the combination of textures & flavors so we'll be making this one again.

I didn't think my family would like these but the combination really worked and they are delicious! We often have leftover chicken so the only thing I had to buy special was the liverwurst and daikon. We will make these again.

Tasty recipe! The only modification I made was to decrease the fish sauce to 1 1/2 teaspoons. Also drained the slaw by squeezing it thoroughly with my hands 'til almost dry. Great sandwich with and w/out mayo.
