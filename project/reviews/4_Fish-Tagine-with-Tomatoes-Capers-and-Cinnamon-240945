While it was easy enough to make, I found this recipe extremely bland. i enjoyed the soft scent of cinnamon and the cumin. I added extra of both and also a good squeeze of lemon... but if I make this again.. I'll have to find a way to really amp it up. Much much too soft and mild for my taste.

I can't believe how simple but exceptional this recipe is. Wish I had sultans on hand to throw in as other reviewers recommended. I did add about a 1/4 cup of sliced green olives. Served over couscous. Delicious.

THis was phenomenal. Especially so, considering how quick and easy it was! I made some tweaks, adding grapes, raisins, scallops, and substituting some Moroccan argan oil for the olive oil. i wrote about in my blog, here... http://www.baker-maker.com/2012/01/stovetop-moroccan-fish-tagine.html

This was exceptional. My boyfriend loved every bite. The fish turned out so moist and tender. I added some fresh lemon juice on top, and served this on a bed of quinoa with some rosemary chopped in. Amazing dinner, and so easy to make!

Wow! So easy and such a huge hit for dinner tonight! Like others, I doubled everything in the sauce and I cooked for half an hour rather than the 10 minutes suggested in the recipe. Good enough for a dinner party.

I messed this up as much as one could possibly mess up a recipe. I tried to make it with tofu, and only realizeed that the tofu had frozen after I had already started. I thawed it for 1 minute in hot water and threw it in somewhat soggy (didn't manage to dry it well). I accidentally bought curshed tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes. And it was STILL delicious. Perhaps not as good as when I did it properly, kudos to a recipe that just can not be messed up, no matter how hard you try!

So easy my husband could make it -- and he did! All I did was taste the sauce and say, "Hmm, I bet a sliced preserved Meyer lemon would enrich this." Since I happened to have some in the fridge, we made the experiment and it was eminently successful. We also used the reduced oil and raisins suggested by other reviewers. And we used swordfish because there was no halibut available. I had never cooked fish this way and will certainly do so again. Next time I will try adding a little bit of harissa!

This is my new "go to" recipe for entertaining. I use a tagine, add currants and lemon and cook the sauce longer than called for here. Then I add various kinds of fish or skinless, boneless chicken breast. It is delicious and very elegant. Nobody believes how easy it is.

Delicious! I took others' suggestions and added a handful of raisins and a squeeze of lemon and cooked the sauce a little longer for the flavors to combine.

Do it with mussels! I doubled the sauce, added some white wine, and put the mussels in to steam just until the shells opened. AMAZING. And the leftovers were even better, so I recommend doing the whole thing the morning of or the day before, then reheating.

This was straightforward, easy and delicious. As suggested in other reviews, used less oil, added 2 T raisins, a handful of carrots and simmered for almost an hour before adding the fish (talapia, in this case). Served with rice.

An unusually easy recipe that used mostly things I had in the cupboard. Tasted great with couscous. I was trying to keep it light but I can see myself trying lots of variations on this, like adding garlic or pitted olives or raisins or experimenting with different kinds of fish. Wow.

I made 2 different versions, one with fish (cod, tilapia) and the 2nd with chicken thighs (cooked fish in seperate pyrex dishes---not combined with chicken). Hands down, the chicken version tasted better to me. I also added in some currants (2 TBSP) and golden raisins (1 TBSP). I'd reduce the amount of oil next time, 1/4 cup is too much. the cumin/cinnamon combo is really nice. I served it over quinoa. My dinner guests liked it! Easy to do ahead and keep warm for a dinner party.

This is a fantastic and super easy meal to makee even for a week-night supper. I used cod since that's what swims in my backyard. Any frim enough white fish will work. Might try with Mahi-Mahi next time. I used a can of chopped tomatoes with "sweet onions" instead of stewed tomatoes. I served with rice and green beans.

Love this recipe. It's so simple and flavorful. The only change I make is using less oil.

I made a deconstructed version of this, because I didn't have stewed tomatoes. I sauteed the olive oil and cumin with chopped yellow tomato, olives, capers, some grated lemon peel, bay leaf, and cinnamon, and then threw the hake in there on the oil, covering it after turning the fish. Yum.

Rating: 4
My husband and I really enjoyed this. I did add one preserved Meyer lemon (just chopped up the peel, as usual), which added a layer of flavor. I also made the sauce about an hour ahead of time and let it sit so the flavors could meld, then added the fish at the last minute. Very good, healthy, and easy.

Love this recipe, it's become one of my staples. I server it over the fat Israeli style couscous, and also tweaked it a bit to include either fresh or preserved lemons. Good lemons (Meyers when in season) and good green olives are the highlights of the dish. Here's my version: http://greencockatoo.wordpress.com/2010/03/22 /moroccan-fish-tagine-with-meyers-lemons/

Cooked this in an actual tagine instead of a skillet. Doubled the sauce, added green beans and carrots, and cooked for a while longer before adding the fish. Adding lemon juice at the end is a must - makes this dish a delicious repeat!

This was easy to make and simply delicious! I don't care for cumin, but I like to get out of my safety zone and thought I would see how the cumin tasted when combined with the cinnamon. It was phenomenal! I will be adding this recipe to my catalog. One point, however, I found the dish a bit too salty for my taste, I would either omit salt from the fish before adding to sauce, or use salt-free stewed tomatoes. Good one!

this was easy. this was excellent. used good quality stewed tomatoes/no salt based on reviews. good taste, although pretty mild. used talipia, about a pound and a half for the recipe and it was perfect. I would recommend this without any question and definitely will make it again.

Per the "too much salt" comments. You must learn that all spice and seasoning amounts in a recipe should be ignored. All depends on stir and sip. Any use of shelf products (here canned tomatoes and capers) could over load the sauce with sodium without a grain of kosher salt added. Salt in the exact amount is a catalyst to bring out flavors in other constitutes. Salt is alkaline. Lemon juice is acidic and also has the marvelous purpose of a catalyst to bring out other flavors - and bringing into balance too much alkaline salt. Lemon juice is not always intended to make something taste lemony. Stir and sip and always have lemon near by.

Rating: 4
This was a very tasty, easy dish. I only made enough fish for two but kept the amount of sauce the same which was great with plain couscous. I used fresh ground cumin and added a couple of tablespoons of harissa. The capers were salty enough that I only added a little extra salt. Will definitely be making this again.

Rating: 4
Liked it a lot. Too much salt though (if your stewed tomatoes are already salty). Great combo of spices, gives it an exotic twist.

Halibut fillet was great, but I guess Im not a fan of cinnamon, I'd go with a more Italian style next time--no cinnamon, no cumin, keep is much more simple.

A great quick treat! I followed the other readers' suggestions, to add more spices and 3/4 can stewed tomatoes instead of a full can. It took me 25 minutes the first time around, and that's including the time it took to make couscous.

This is such a quick, simple dish. A friend made this for us once with chilean seabass, and I loved it so much that I went and found the recipe. I have made this several times using different fish, and always adding more spices than the recipe calls for. I have found that adding the juice from half of a lemon gives this recipe the final flavor it needed.

Rating: 2
It's always nice to find a quick and tasty meal. I'm not a huge lover of fish and this didn't knock me out. My husband liked it a lot. On the issue of the quantity of sauce I would say this: if you are the kind of person that likes a lot of additional toppings (as is my husband) then double the sauce. If you are ok with a meal that is more about the fish than the sauce, then it is perfectly sufficient to flavor the food and serve with a few tomatoes on top.

Easy, yes, but I agree with lfmayer that the can of tomatoes was overpowering -- and I even doubled the spices. I might try it again using fresh tomatoes.

This was a great recipe. The halibut came out incredibly tender. It goes well with both cous cous and quinoa. I agree with the other reviews that you should double the tomatoes and capers. I also increased the cumin and cinnamon by half. Definitely don't double the oil though. About half way through cooking, cover the fish with the sauce so that the flavors infuse more. Lastly, we cooked this with a real tagine and it came out exceptionally well. We did most of it on the stove top but once it was time to add the fish we covered the tagine and put it in the over on 150 F for about 15 minutes. Delicious!

This was a MAJOR disappointment. Cook from VA, I'm right there with you. I had such high expectations from the glowing reviews and all I can say is "eh". Not bad, but certainly not worth all of this hype. If this is the best Epicurious recipe some of you have found, you aren't looking or cooking enough. It tasted like a can of tomatoes with a few seasonings. Certainly not the restaurant quality some oohed and ahhed about.

Rating: 4
This is absolutely one of the top epicurious recipes I have made. First, it's easy. Second, it's fast. And third, it's delicious! I used slightly less olive oil. I also used talapia instead of the halibut. Otherwise, followed the recipe. Wow! I made it for a family dinner, but would make for company anytime. If you're short on time, looking for an easy,great tasting entree, this is a definite. I served with salad and rice pilaf.

Rating: 4
This was wonderful! It went together quickly, and was just as good with chicken (I made 2 separate tagines, one with fish and one with chicken). As some reviewers noted, doubling the sauce is a must, and it could do with a bit less olive oil, although I loved it with the full amount. Served over couscous, had some cold, sliced starfruit on the side, as well as some fried plantains. Used halibut, but any firm white fish would do. You could even substitute lentils for the meat/fish and it would still be wonderful. The aroma as it was cooking was almost enough to warrant 4 forks!

Try this recipe with beef or lamb (more Moroccan) to balance off the robust sauce (doubled) better. Fish is great, but the flavor can get lost if it is too mild.

This was simple, healthy and yummy. We used cod and cooked it in our Le Creuset tagine, which we don't get the chance to use very often. We used extra fish and still had plenty of sauce, so I'm not sure why some of the others reviewers ended up with not enough...

Very good flavors and very quick and easy. The only thing is that the amount of salt and pepper that the recipe calls for is too much. I'd cut it in half. Since the flavors are so strong, I served it with brown rice pilaf and sauteed zucchini.

This dish was absolutely delicious - one of the most flavorful dishes I have ever made. I used a generous dose of white wine in the sauce, as well as some lemon juice to give a little contrasting tang to the earthy flavor of the cumin -- delicious. Like other reviewers have said, I would definitely double (or triple) the sauce - I made the prescribed amount for only two filets and it still wasn't enough to satisfy! Had to add a bit of water while the fish was cooking to prevent the sauce from drying out. Served with orzo. All-around an amazing dish (event prompting me to write my first review!)

Rating: 4
An outstanding recipe for the time invested. I used cumin seeds and cinnamon bark and hand ground them both, which made the flavours that much more rich. I also used the fresh Pachino tomatoes we get in our markets here in Italy rather than the canned variety. Added some white vermouth for additional body.

Awesome. My husband said it was one of the best things I ever made. I almost fainted. It took 10 minutes! I have spent hours on recipes that didn't get such a good reaction from my family. I used half the oil and doubled the sauce. I also threw the fish on the grill real quick and cooked it for about five minutes before I put it in the pan with the sauce.

I read all the reviews before heading out to buy a beautiful piece of halibut for this recipe. I followed the recipe without making any changes or substitutions. The fish was wonderful but the recipe was "eh." Served with couscous and broccoli. Nobody in my family enjoyed it, and we are all gastronomically adventurous. Everyone ate the fish and left the sauce. The only thing I'd agree with the reviewers on is that this is a quick and simple dish to prepare.

This recipe fit the bill because all ingredients (except I used four tilapia filets instead of hake or halibut) could be found in my kitchen. I was a little skeptical when I first read it, but the ratings were awesome so I had confidence in this recipe from the start. Sauteing the spices in some oil before making any tagine is the key to getting the most out of dried spices - I've used this technique in numerous other recipes. I also cut back on the oil and still found it wouldn't hurt to use even less. I used a large deep skillet with a lid instead of breaking out my tagine, let the fish go the whole ten minutes and it came out perfectly cooked! might even suggest taking the fish out and adding some tomato paste to give the sauce some more body as it was a great addition to the taste of the fish rather than just a cooking vessel. Served with steamed broccoli and some good crusty bread. I'll definitely be making this again!
