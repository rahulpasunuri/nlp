Wow! I hate to go against the crowd here but we LOVE this brittle. Hulled pumpkin seeds are readily available in our area - most Trader Joe's stores carry them - and though the brittle has an unusual prep method, it has turned out deeply delicious each of the three times I've made it.

Hi friends and fellow comestibles cultists, I tried this recipe and it fell pretty flat. I didn't like the flavor combination of the plain hulled pumpkin seeds and the very basic caramel. I did however find a delicious recipe(which I posted on my profile) that offered a much stronger, almost nutty, flavored caramel and carefully toasted pumpkin seeds with the hulls intact. The resulting brittle had a similar flavor to crunch-n-munch popcorn and the hulls were flaky and easy to eat. They ended up offering another layer of texture to the dish. I tried it twice and the second time added just a pinch of ground sea salt to the seeds whilst they were toasting with some palatable results. One thing however, this is a lovely recipe for candy beginners (easy to do with limited tools and expirience) but be very careful to keep pets and kids clear of the kitchen during preparation. I have a nasty burn on my pinky due to tripping over an overzealous border collie. Happy Halloween everybody and happy caramelizing!

I ended up with sugar coated pumpkin seeds. Hard as a rock. Nothing like the recipe stated it would be. My kids did not even like them.

Well, I gave it my best effort, but ended up with sugar-coated pumpkin seeds. The sugar never really developed any significant color, and thickened to the point where it just crystallized. I think next time, I'm going to try another recipe.

You can buy hulled pumpkin seeds in hispanic food stores. They are called pepitas. I would not imagine trying to hull them. I agree with one of the previous reviewers that when you bake pumpkin seeds they don't need to be hulled. I bake pumpkin seeds that I salt in a 400 F oven for just a few minutes. I would recommend buying hulled seeds for this recipe.

In response to eating non hulled pumpkin seeds...In my area, this is the only way we eat them! Ive never heard of hulling them...if you bake them for an hour or so, they are so flaky crispy, that theres no need to hull them. they are NOT like sunflower seeds in this way. try it, maybe you'll like it...in the mean time...Im gonna try them hulled too ;-) zira

We doubled the recipe and the ratio of water to sugar needed to adjusted. I saw one of the cooking shows do this same recipe with much more sugar. I am inexperienced in carmalizing sugar so I carefully added small amouts until I got a thicker consistancy which worked very well.

Would like to make this dish, but first would like an easy way to hull pumpkin seeds. I have roasted them, but find it to time consuming to hull. At this time of the year we have lots of pumpkin seeds, please help.

I, like the previous review, didn't make this yet but have to say this in response to Julie Flanders comments. It is obvious that you have to use hulled pumpkin seeds. I don't know anyone who eats the hulls (yet)!

I haven't made this, but here's a response to Nicole: 1) when a recipe doesn't specify, it's generally safe to use white granulated sugar; that is the default, and anything else (powdered, dark brown, light brown, or "sugar in the raw") would have to be specified; 2) sugar and water are the basic ingredients in all caramels/brittles/pralines, and if you cook them properly, they will harden (sometimes too much so, if you don't watch it carefully); be sure to follow the recipe exactly, invest in a candy thermometer, and read lots of candy/praline/caramel/fudge recipes to learn more about cooking sugar.

I tried to make the brittle but found it odd that the ingredients were only sugar and water. First of all, there is no specification of what kind of sugar (brown, granulated, cane, etc.), and second there is nothing in the ingredients that would make the brittle harden. I found the sugar and the water did not harden at all. Quite a waste of good pumpkin seeds. If you could tell me of another ingredient to add to the brittle to make it harden, I would definetely like to try it again. Disappointed member, Nicole!

Too many seeds, not enough brittle. If I were to do it again, I would double the amount of sugar and water.

If I were doing this again, I would use hulled pumpkin seeds--starting with fresh unhulled seeds leaves you with a lot of husks in each mouthful.
