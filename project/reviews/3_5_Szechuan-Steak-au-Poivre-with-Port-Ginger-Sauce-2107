I didn't have any Szechuan peppercorns, and used black, white, and green peppercorns and some red pepper flakes. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written. My husband and 14-year-old daughter pronounced it the best steak they'd ever had. This was fast and wonderfully flavorful!

Ambrosial! And this coming from someone who usually avoids red meat. Szechuan peppers are nearly impossible to find these days because of some sort of agricultural ban on them, but I used a a mix of white, green, pink, and black peppercorns, and it tasted fine. I used Fonseca Bin No. 27 for the port and found that it made for a delicious sauce. Next time I might double the sauce it was so tasty.

This was terrificly easy and delicious. I had bone-in rib steaks on hand, so I seered them as best I could in the pan and finished cooking them in a 400 degree oven while I made the sauce. I also did not have Szechuan peppercorns and so I substituted reg. black peppercorns -- still quite good. The steaks were wonderful and the sauce was spectacular. I would have liked more sauce so next time I'll double the sauce ingredients.

If you love rare beef and pepper, this is a great recipe! I simmered the port longer than called for to make the sauce a bit thicker.
