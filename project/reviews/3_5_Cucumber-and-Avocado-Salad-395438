Lots of raves with this salad. Really refreshing

Really loved the flavors of ginger, garlic and coriander together. The first time I made it I followed the recipe. Now I substitute the avocado with whatever I have at home. Tried it with mango and loved it as well.

This is a very good salad. A strong garlic-ginger flavor (that we like) offset by the freshness of the cucumber and avocado. The first time I made it I followed the recipe perfectly except I used some crushed red peppers in place of the chiles and I diced the avocado and mixed it in the salad. It held up great for leftovers the next day (the avocado didn't get brown or too mushy). The second time I made it I didn't bother with the plastic bag. I finely diced the garlic and ginger then mashed them with the red pepper flakes and cilantro springs in a bowl using a potato masher. I macerated the cucumber in the same bowl and mashed it a bit with a potato masher. Stirred it up well, covered the bowl, and let it sit (stirring once or twice). Turned out perfectly. I love serving this with cold sesame noodles- a great combo. Will make regularly!

Loved this. Didn't have the chiles, so used crushed red pepper instead. Delicious combination of flavors - even my 11yo loved it.

Loved the strong flavors of this salad. It was much better the second day and I found out that the basil is essential in balancing the flavors. Next time I will do a fine mince of the garlic and ginger.

My ginger was bad, so I left it out. Despite my shortcomings, it was the perfect spring and summer salad as I was able to pluck several of the ingredients from my garden! Oishii desu!

This was ok not great. I made as written except for removing the skin from the cukes. I guess I expected more with the combination of ingredients.

This recipe is a little heavy on ginger and garlic. I cut the flavor by serving it in a pita, and that turned out to be a very good solution.

I was not so thrilled with this salad. I found it a bit bitter having left the skin on the cucumber. If I make it again, I would dice the veggies and serve on a small portion.

YUMM! Followed the recipe (except for the chilies - omitted) and it was sooo good. Also great the next day for lunch.

Served this at two functions one day apart and everyone enjoyed the unique flavors. It is important to finely dice the garlic and ginger. Used 2 tsp Sriracha because I could not find the chiles noted in the recipe and substituted lemon juice instead of lime juice. This is a great summer side salad, unique contrasts of veggies! B.J.

Okay, since when is it okay to serve cucumbers with the skin on? Even the English ones are a little toothsome with the skin on. I liked the recipe though....with the skin off.

Apologies in advance for being one of those annoying people who review the recipe but didn't make it as written. I had to adjust based on what I had on hand and it was soooooo AMAZINGLY GOOD that I thought I'd share the info. All I had on hand were cucumbers, celery, avacados and limes. I added garlic powder since I was clean out of the real thing and tossed in about 2 T of chopped chives I had in the fridge. I mixed everything but the avacados in a bowl and let it sit for about 1/2 hour then added the avacados. I will definately make this again and since I really dislike Cilantro - I think I'll just keep things as I made it today. IT WAS DELICIOUS! Everyone in my family loved it!

These flavors combined beautifully! I also used red pepper flakes instead of the chile. The celery gives a refreshing crisp!

This was easy to make and it tasted wonderful! The only thing I changed was I used crushed red pepper instead of the dried chiles de arbol. This will definitely be a staple in my house.
