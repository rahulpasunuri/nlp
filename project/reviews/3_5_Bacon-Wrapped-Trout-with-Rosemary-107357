When using whole trout, I ended up ditching the rosemary. The leaves come off the rosemary strip during cooking forcing the diner to pick them out one by one. I don't think that the rosemary flavor is worth that effort when some rosemary flavored oil will do the trick just as easily. Now I just insert lemon slices. I also serve a variation of this. I place one or two slices of thick cut bacon on a trout fillet and broil it. Delicious -- and if I use a preheated griddle instead of a broiler pan I get crispy trout skin as a bonus.

Followed the recipe but also inserted thin lemon slices inside the cavity, and used 3 rosemary sprigs. Excellent and easy.

DELICIOUS fish! Found that the strong flavors of bacon and rosemary balanced perfectly with the stronger fishy taste of trout. The whole family loved it. Served with fresh green beans sauteed with caramelized onion & bacon dice and toasted almond slivers. And some roasted baby red potatoes. Super yummy and SO easy! Great way to use fresh-caught trout.

Amazing. Instead of bacon wrapped, for 2 trout I use about a pound of thick cut bacon diced and add it to the compote. I fry it, transfer to a bowl and then sautee the onions in the residual bacon fat.

I make this all summer long on the Big Green Egg. It is outstanding and our favorite trout recipe. Yum!!

Believe the hype... I made this "en paillote," and it was excellent. The 2 sprigs of rosemary were not too much, and didn't overwhelm the fish. I'll be making this again soon!

This was wonderful. Used the outdoor gas grill instead of broiling, and placed the lemon slices inside the trout during grilling. Very easy.

I tried grilling instead of broiling. I also used some dill sprigs and just a touch of rosemary. VERY nice!!!

This has an excellent presentation and is very easy. Next time I will put extra lemon slices inside the fish to add flavor, plus a bit more sea salt. It was somewhat tricky to get the bacon to brown evenly while wrapped around the fish. Overall, though, this is a terrific way to prepare the boned whole trout that is available at Whole Foods for a relatively sane price, compared to other fish.

I tried this wrapped with pancetta instead of bacon, and stuffed with cilantro instead of rosemary. Wow.

When I make this again, I'll use a little less rosemary. Our trout were small and were overpowered by the rosemary. Otherwise, this came out great! Of course, freshly-caught fish helped a lot.

Easy and delicious. Trout is one of my favourite fish and I jumped at the chance of presenting it intact. Served with asparagus broiled alongside the trout. Will definitely repeat.

Excellent flavor, beautiful presentation. Everything except the broiling can be done hours ahead of time. If you're going to add some fat and calories to trout, this is the way to go - forget attempting to flip nut -encrusted fish in a frying pan. Cleanup's a breeze if broiled on a foil-covered sheet.

This is a great recipe for trout, i followed the recipe to a t, but next time i might add more bacon(nice combo between the tender fish and the crunchy bacon) also maybe i'll add the lemon slices before baking. Nice with grilled or steamed veggies. Overall a great recipe for a quick and simple meal!

This was sooo fast and just fabulous. I prepared it three hours in advance and let it sit in the fridge until I was was ready to stick it under the broiler. I'm not a big fish fan in general, but this was very, very good.

I actually made this dish as a tin-foil dinner while I was camping. I cut the lemon slices very thin and included them inside the trout with the rosemary and salt and pepper. The bacon was a nice touch. It was delicious and was the envy of my fellow campers.

Being a lazy cook married to a gourmet, I'm on a constant look out for easy but delicious recipes that meet his standards and this one does. This recipe will become a standard in our home.

We were so happy to find such an easy recipe for trout. Fortunately, I have a huge rosemary bush in my garden, so I really stuffed it. The trout I used was about 14oz. so I broiled them for the full 7 minutes and then after I flipped it over I followed the instructions and let the bacon cook thouroughly. They were succulent and very flavorful. When I buy fresh trout again, this is the way I'll make it.

A very tasty way to do trout. We usually grill it outside, but I think this came out terrific using the broiler. Our trout was big enough for 2 portions, but the cooking time was the same.
