I'm not sure if this is better than the cracked pepper foccacia on this site but it is a nice change.

This came out very, very well on the first try! I divided the dough in half ... one half completed with the toppings in the recipe, the other with caramelized onions and rosemary. Both versions were excellent. I cannot fit both my baking pans in the oven at the same time. 20 minutes was sufficient for cooking 4 of the breads.

Yes Fifi, you can make this without a kitchenaid. Making bread of any kind is wonderful to do by hand. The machine is less messy, but it also must be cleaned! Made this recipe(without machine) because I lost my favorite focaccia recipe. Very good. Like the goat cheese, but mine didn't melt. Next time I will add most of the green onion & some of the goat cheese to the dough before shaping. Everyone loved it.

Can this be made without a mixer? I'd love to try it, but the author sounds quite foreboding toward those of us too poor or too stubborn to buy a Kitchenaid.

This was my first time making bread and it was fantastic. I also got impatient and didn't wait for the final rising but it still came out fantastic. Will add more chevre next time I bake; the toppings spread out while bread bakes. Will definately make again...

I'll admit, I got impatient and eschewed the final rising step. The focaccia rose while baking, and the result was still fantastic!

Just spent the summer in Italy eating focaccia every day. I really wanted to recreate it and this was a wonderful recipe! Mine came out thinner than some of the thick focaccia I had in Italy but still a great result! My husband's eyes lit up as he bit into it. I used this recipe for the dough and didn't use the toppings suggested. I opted for what I saw a lot this summer which was onions and rosemary on top.

The bread is incredible. I've never had such an easy experience with bread baking before. No kneading and it comes out full of texture and taste. I can't wait to try it again and use different toppings, or make breadsticks out of it.

Delicious! I did mix the garlic and olive oil and let it sit while the dough was rising. The cook from Canada is correct. It is easier to spread. A great recipe!!! I increased the amount of red pepper flakes to add some heat.

This bread was great! I would soak the garlic in the oil and spread with a brush (oil and garlic) as opposed to sprinkling the garlic - wasn't uniform. Delicious!!!!!!!!
