I probably won't make this again, because only because I really think you need a deep fryer for it. I just used a saucepan, and I'd recommend using a much larger pan if you don't use a deep fryer, and make sure you have an accurate thermometer to make sure the oil is hot enough. If the oil isn't hot enough, it doesn't seem to fry correctly and the tempura can get too oily. I used Sapporo for the beer, and it was great. Used sweet potato, onion, peppers, and cauliflower. The onions might have been too moist, because the breading didn't stick very well to them. If someone else tries onions, I'd recommend blotting them dry with a towel or paper towel before dipping them in the tempura.

Like many of the other reviewers here, I take exception to the comments made by the reviewer from Bloomfield Hills, MI. This looks like a fantastic tempura recipe, and I look forward to trying it. This past May, I read a fantastic book on Japanese food and cooking, and, of course, it included tempura. Though the people in Japan may use shoyu and a bit of grated daicon as a dipping sauce; the book suggested that the true tempura afficionado needed nothing more than a pinch of sea salt to appreciate the light scruptous flavor of great tempura. I tried a pinch of salt on some tempura, while at my favorite sushi place, and found that to be true; though later I used a few dipping sauces as well, to kick up the flavor quotient, ie: shirachi sauce, and eel sauce.

If you're gonna fry... this is the batter to use! Doesn't get any easier. Much lighter than most tempura batters. I wanted to fry everything in sight and did; shrimp, artichokes, plantains...

Yummy. I also added some fish sauce. So easy to make - I expected this would be a production, but just takes a few minutes and looks super fancy.

I agree that this isnt tradional tempura, but it lends more flavor than most tempura recipes. I did butterflied shrimp, onions, inchiban eggplant, and dipped it in a Thai fish sauce. Fried it in my wok and the whole thing was so yummy. Too bad deep fried foods cant be a more common meal anymore. This rocked.

This was a terrific batter! I deep-fried eggplant, onions and peppers. I WISH I'd had a sweet potato around! I added a dash of Japanese pepper blend. Delicious! Light and crispy.

We liked this alot; I used cake flour and a Tablespoon of Madras Curry powder - served with Satay sauce. Yum!

Basic , but Very good.Lemon sauce a must with this.

Skipped the cake flour and used plain flour... while prepping for the deep fry, placed the batter in the freezer to keep cold.... once done w/ the slicing/dicing, removed batter and then used... excellent.... as for sauces - we used an assortment of dips 'watered' down w/ tonic water (it's all that was on hand).... dill, champagne, dijon mustard.... soy, brown sugar and toasted sesame seeds.... and then chili jelly.... delicious!!!!

Made it with rice flour as per the suggestions of many reviewers. Really nice, light, crisp tempura, very tasty. My local food co-op only had amber beer except Sapporo. Sapporo, fittingly enough, was great in the batter!

I've been looking for a good Tempura recipe and FINALLY found one! I used rice flour, as well. I made this recipe with sweet potato and it was light, crispy and delicious...not to mention easy.

Tempura is always so light and crisp in restaurants; it's hard to get that result at home. I have found that using supermarket tempura mix is fine if you eat the vegetables right away. Then within minutes the coating gets soggy, the vegetables limp and oily. Take the other reviewer's advice: Use rice flour instead. I wasn't sure what would happen (rice flour traditionally being used as a thickener I think....) but I was pleased with the crispy light coating. I froze the extra vegetables (I like potato, sweet potato, carrot, zucchini, onion, long green beans) and after reheating in a small amount of hot oil, the results are fantastic.

This recipe is bone-head easy and delicious. The asparagus was particuarly tasty - I'll probably use this as a side dish sometime. Mushrooms turn out nice too! I used a deep fryer, and won't use the basket next time. The food sinks at first and the batter fuses it to the screen. It's tough to free the food with the breading intact - not good for presentation!

I've never had tempura at home before. This is a great recipe with lot's of freedom to adjust according to one's own taste. I laugh at "food-snobs" such as the world traveler from MI, as everyone should. The art of cooking is subjective. Your palate for food is your own, others' are bound to differ. It's what makes the world go 'round. Deal.

This was easy and fun! I borrowed a deep fryer to make it easier to monitor the temperature. We added Vidalia onions, zucchini, and halibut to the mix. They all turned out great. Our son even ate vegetables for once! Next time I will add some Mirin sweet rice wine to the soy sauce.

Was OK, but needs quite a bit more flavor if using on meats (might be OK for vegetables as written).

This was good but I probably wouldn't make it again for the weird reason that I can enjoy eating this quantity of fried food in a restaurant but not at home when I've prepared it myself. I added onions and scallops and also tried swiss cheese cubes in this batter. All were good. Served with lemon, soy sauce and cocktail sauce. Incidentally, to the bragging world traveler who got bent out of shape because this wasn't authentic "Japanese" tempura, where in the title or recipe does it claim to be? Tempura can be any dish of vegetables and shrimp or other seafood dipped in batter and fried in deep fat. Also, some Japanese reviewers have stated that this is the way their families made tempura. I believe it differs regionally. There is no definitive right or wrong way to prepare it.

Try frying thin slices of Daikon. I've only seen this in one place and it was delicious.

I "kicked up" the batter with cayenne, garlic salt and Old Bay seasoning. We added mushrooms, onions and green beans also and included chunks of seasoned cod. It was great. A note to Bloomfield Hills; in Ohio as well as Michigan, this tempura doubles in the summer as "county fair food"!

I add one teaspoon of seafood busster,some finely chopped italian parsley,and alittle wet yeast to the batter and the result is great.

This recipe worked very well on bite-size pieces of fish and sliced zucchini. While not exactly like the tempura you get in Japanese restaurants, the batter came out very crisp and light. Make sure your beer is well chilled and let the batter sit for at least 10 minutes after mixing.

My wife also travels to Japan extensively like the Bloomfield Hills, MI reviewer below. She also loves tempura and loved this recipe. I believe on a recent visit to Japan she had tempura made with Sapporo beer. Of course upon returning we get to compare the culinary delicasies of Japan to those in San Francisco, and not Detroit.

I think the recipe gives a descent version of tempura. I don't think there's anyting wrong with using beer in tempura batter (that's done in Japan, my native country.) Other than shrimp, you can make tempura using so many different ingredients -- different types of fish,octopus,squid,sweet potato, pumpkin, brocoli, califlower, onion, green beans, lotus root,asparagus, eggplant, parsely, or mix of vegetables, as long as they aren't too watery. It depends on what you have fresh on that day (At least, that's how my Japanese mother made it). As for the sause, nicer restaurants in Japan often serve tempura with soy sauce, broth, mirin (and/or sake) mixture, but cheaper places often serve it plain and customers pour whatever they like. It is often soy sauce, but I have seen anything from worcester sause to salad dressing.

I hope the know-it-all from Bloomfield Hills, MI, can fit in another 100 trips to Japan, because then maybe he/she'll meet someone who can tell him/her: a)beer in the batter is fine, in fact there are plenty of variations (i.e., ice in the batter, no egg yolk, potato flour, etc), no hard and fast rule, and b)If he/she is going to point out the fact that daikon is grated into the soy sauce, then mention that ginger is also in there and it's not just soy sauce but a mix of dashi, mirin, sugar and soy sauce - though here again there's no one rule - many aficionados just dip the tempura in salt!

Really very good. Not sure how to test oil to see if it's at 375, but I seem to have done OK! Would love to hear about other dips for the batter tho! The curmudgeon below really needs to realize that those of us from the States, may not really know all about authentic tempura. All I know is that this was way cheaper and just as good. Be great for fondue too!

It's a shame that the cook from Bloomfield Hills below wasn't able to see beyond his/her culinary experience and just rate a recipe for what it is. It can't be called Tempura Shrimp simply because it also calls for vegetables, and note that it is not called Authentic Japanese Tempura. The ingredients that they speak of are or can be difficult to obtain all over the country, and I assume that the recipe is an adaptation of the authentic tempura of which this person speaks. Thank goodness we are provided recipes that are similar enough to those authentic ones that we love so much. It would be difficult to nitpik every name of every recipe and to carefully scrutinize each recipe to ensure that it's ingredients live up to the exact "authentic" recipe name from which many are adapted. Also we should note that many, many recipes are made differently from one region to the next, yet carry the exact name.

Although there are people who find a compulsive need to categorize, this shrimp just tastes good. I would add, however, that the yams should be cooked a bit before battering and frying em up. Mine were a little tough. Yum and easy too.

This isn't Tempura. It's beer batter shrimp. I have travelled extensively to Japan (more than 100 trips over a pperiod of 20 years) and find little similarity between this recipe and authentic Tempura. Even a Tempura batter mix from the supermarket makes Tempura closer to real Japanese Tempura. Also, the Japanese typically dip Tempura in soy sauce (shoyu) with grated Daikon (a mild white radish). Other than shrimp, the course, as it is called, typically contains Tempura fried lotus root, crysanthemum flower, small fish (similar to smelts), sweet potato, ground shrimp mixture and squid. This might be good beer batter shrimp, but it's not Tempura.
