We really enjoy this dish. It was particularly easy to prepare while camping. The only change I make is to add the garlic after the potatoes have cooked for 10 minutes. Adding them earlier turned them a little more charred that I care for.

This is a great, simple and lean way to cook potatoes etc. Tonight I will add some squash. My husband loved it.

I used a regular skillet and found this took less time.

Wonderful simple dish. Nice to have pan-browned potatoes without a lot of fat. The red pepper adds great color. I made the dish for two, so I used two potatoes and half a large red pepper, but didn't cut the garlic.

My husband and I enjoyed this dish very much. I added some salt and pepper to taste but wouldn't add anything more. This side dish was served with Cajun Rib-eye steaks and made a delicious meal.
