I made this exactly as directed and it turned into a sticky mass. Couldn't rescue the grapefruit peel. If I were to make it again, I would have taken the peel out of the syrup immediately, cooled, and rolled in sugar. It didn't make sense to me to cool in the liquid... I should have followed my intuition.

I follow the recipe exactly and get great results. This is a marvelous snack and a nice addition to a table of desserts at my annual winter party.

Now that we are at the height of Citrus Season, I make candied citrus peel often - can't bear to throw out all that lovely peel. I have found it works best to boil the peel 3 times, 8 minutes each time, draining and using fresh water with each boiling. This not only softens the peel, but takes away any bitterness. Not really necessary to let peel cool in the syrup - when done, cool for a few minutes only, then using tongs remove peel to a wire rack to cool/drain for 15-20 min, finally toss in granulated sugar and spread on waxed paper to dry completely. All types of citrus works beautifully except limes - lime peel is thin and tough and it just gets hard and leathery. Have even done it with Christmas Mandarins which are not quite as flavorful/tangy. Be sure to remove as much white pith as possible. Enjoy!

I have been searching for this recipe and plan to try it with limes and lemons too. I will also roll it in granulated sugar after it cools, and then store if after it has dried a bit. This is perfect for Christmas treats!

Very easy (I used them in the tea brack, also on this website). But for munching, I prefer the ones that are rolled in sugar.
