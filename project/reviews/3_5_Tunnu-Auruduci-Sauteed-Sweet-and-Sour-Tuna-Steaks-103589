The big advantage of this tuna recipe is that it is both kid friendly and grown up delicious. Very good sauce. I cooked the tuna to medium rare.

Excellent recipe with the following modifications: 1. Cook the tuna for 30 seconds on each side for rare/medium rare. We had 1" steaks and cooked on the short side of the recipe and they were medium rare. 2. Double the liquid recipe. The sauce is delicious but there was not enough of it. 3. Following substitutes work: Dry Red Wine for Dry White Wine, Honey for sugar and add a little dried wasabi to the sauce for some "zip" 4. Some sauteed garlic with the onions worked well for those who like garlic

Excellent I agree with others, will cook slightly less next time, but was still delicious

Excellent recipe! I used spring onions which enhanced the taste and balanced nicely with the vinegar. I served it with asparagus seared in garlic infused olive oil and wild rice. An excellent 2003 South African Meritage was the perfect wine to complete the meal. I will serve it again.

We thought this we pretty good - we seared it as directed but reduced the end cooking time to 1 minute per side and we felt it came out overcooked. The sweet and sour onions were really tasty but the dish would have been so much better if it was cooked less. Will def. try again though!

Dill's Seafood in Bridgeton NJ first told me about this yummy way to make tuna. They use brown sugar and mint as a garnish. Delish!!

we enjoyed this dish but we've made several better tuna recipes from this site, like ginger shiitake, adobo rub, tuna spiedini for example. won't make this one again.

This was excellent and easy... One sugestion would be to deglaze the pan with just alittle white wine scraping up the onion pieces and getting all that flavor. Remove the onions and you can turn the heat up to very high and get a nice sear on the steaks. If you don't do this the onion remains burn and you loose the flavor of the carmelized onion flavor. Also, we used a Bermuda onion... very delicious.. My new favorite tuna recipe and also fabulous room temperature... Don't over cook.. It must be purple in the middle..

This was SUPER simple and quick to make and the taste was fabulous. I served it with Parmesan Couscous and golden raspberries on the side. I bought tuna steaks that were 3/4 inch thick and was able to get it cooked properly (rare in the middle).

Incredible. Easy and tasty and different. I can't wait to make this again.

Easy preparation with common ingredients created a very uncommon taste! By far one of my favorite tuna recipes. The sweet with a hint of sour was divine.

This is by far the most requested fish recipe by my husband, a huge tuna fan. I have made this dish a dozen times now and it never gets old. Fresh fish and a good bottle of wine make this dish a great meal.

Made as directed. The best meal I've had all year. The onion mixture was exactly the right sweetness to go with the tuna. I was worried that it would need a sauce to compliment the tuna, but the sweet and sour mixture was perfect.

My husband went fishing in Mexico and we have tons of tuna. This recipe was fabulous. The sweet/sour onions w/ the tuna was heaven on a plate. I served it with Italian white beans and salad. Lovely presentation and mouth-wateringly good.

Sorry, Ruggiero, but this is essentially Marcella Hazan's recipe for the same dish; she published it many years before your's came out. It is, nevertheless, very, very good. It is, however, almost impossible to make the tuna rare. In order to make it rare, you would have to cut it way too thick. And I'm not even sure it would be as good rare. Don't overcook it, but hoping it will turn out rare, even with very brief cooking, is unrealistic. As with many tuna dishes, a light Sicialian red wine, instead of white, is a fine accompanyment.

Quite tasty. I tweeked it a bit to kick it up a notch. I used garlic infused olive oil, two kinds of onions (yellow and purple), and cilantro with the parsley. And, of course, a generous squeeze of lime in the sauce and then over the finished product. The extra flavors really jazzed it up nicely.

This is quick, easy and very delicious. The sweet and sour flavor is a perfect compliment to the fresh tuna. If you are a fresh tuna lover this is a must.

My husband is a sport fisherman so I'm always looking for new ways to cook tuna. This recipe has very good flavors and doesn't make the tuna dry. It's also different from the usual seared tuna. I would highly recommend it.

This recipe is a quick,unique way to prepare tuna with common ingredients. Very Good!

This was delicious. It needed a pinch more sugar and it was a bit overcooked. My boyfriend and one of my children love sushi and I was hoping to present them with at least a rare tuna steak. Didn't come out that way but very tasty anyway.

I have to agree with an earlier reviewer - it was ok but nothing special. I probably wouldn't bother making this one again. It was very quick to prepare but then again, most tuna recipes are.

This is truly a devine combination, but I added 1/2 red chopped tomato and 1/2 tsp. of toasted and coarsely chopped fennel seeds (per steak) to the cooking of onions with liquids at the end.I also used balsamic instead of vinegar. In this way they can cook a little longer and vinegar is not so overpowering. I would cook steaks a little rare, about 1 min. per side.

Really good, quick.

Not bad, not great either. Lots of other better recipes so I won't try this again.

Everyone loved this dish, although I will make more sauce next time. I served it with basmati rice and asparagus. Easy and quick.

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this dish. However, I think the "sour" overpowered the "sweet". Next time I will add more sugar and let up on the vinegar.

Oh my gosh! This was so good! We are trying to eat healthier and this was the perfect dish. We don't like onions so I just didn't add them-they weren't missed. In fact I think with this recipe, less is better. Since I used Ahi Tuna the flavor was allowed to take center stage. I served couscous with garlic and red pepper and some fresh raspberries on the side. You definitely have to try this!

This was very good. I too added mushrooms. Next time I will make more "sauce". Do not overcook fish!

This is so easy and so yummy! I had some leftover mushrooms in the fridge so I sauteed them with the onions, too. It tasted fabulous. I will definitely make this again!

This recipe was a hit with my wife, I twisted a bit by adding osyter mushrooms, rosted garlic and wrapped it wih genova salami it tasted great good luck and cheers!!!

We have prepared this recipe twice and it was a hit both times. Relatively simple to prepare and an entirely different taste for freshly caught tuna. This is a keeper.

I was in Taos, NM without any of my cookbooks and wanted to serve Tuna for some guests who don't eat red meat. After an evening of showing some friends how the internet worked (and of course epicurious site) it reminded me that all I had to do was type in Tuna and wallah! I found this recipe that can be made probably with the ingredients you have on hand. I could see it was relatively easy to prepare (important when cooking in someone else's kitched) and very surprised at how wonderful it was. Everyone raved about it - the flavors were excellent. I am making it again at home for my family. Thanks David!
