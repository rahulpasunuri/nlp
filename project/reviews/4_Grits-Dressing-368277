I made this exactly and people loved it!

We make this every Thanksgiving and Christmas... but we make it in addition to cornbread dressing at Thanksgiving! It's a family tradition, and it is sooooo good. Occasionally, we use cheese logs from the deli section in place of the grated cheddar, and we add ample garlic.
