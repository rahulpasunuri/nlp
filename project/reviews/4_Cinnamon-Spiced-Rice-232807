This is r-e-a-l-l-y delish! I used coconut oil and garam masala instead of the individual spices. Very unusual and flavorful.

Fantastic. The flavours were amazing. I used jasmine rice and cooked it to the recipe's instructions rather than what was on the bag and it turned out perfectly. Aside from using jasmine rice, the only other alteration I made was to throw in a bay leaf. This was a great pairing with tandoori chicken. So good!

Flavors were right on, but I think it is key to check (and defer to, if different) the cooking instructions on your rice.

I just happened upon this recipe while making the curried okra with chickpeas and tomatoes recipe also located on this site. I decided to try making it while the okra was cooking. What a good choice. This was so delicious! The flavors are different than I usually associate with rice. This is going to be a regular at the dinner table at my house now. The only change I made was to use ground cumin (I didn't feel like biting into seeds)..I'm not sure how much I used I just shook it in..I would say I used a healthy amount (more than a teaspoon but less than two?) Next time I make this recipe I'm going to try it Woodward17's way. That sounds really good.

Needs some slight tweaking, but very good basic recipe. This is more like how my Indian family and I cook it: 1 medium onion, chopped 3 garlic cloves, chopped 3/4 teaspoon cumin seeds 1 (2 1/2- to 3-inch) cinnamon stick 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 1/2 cups long-grain white rice 2 1/4 cups reduced-sodium chicken broth 3/4 teaspoon sugar 3/4 teaspoon whole black pepper corns 1 teaspoon salt 3 cloves 4-5 pods green cardamom Cook cumin seeds, pepper, cloves, cardamom, and cinnamon stick in oil in a 2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat for 30 seconds then add onion and garlic, stirring, until onion begins to soften, about 3 minutes. Add rice and cook, stirring, until grains become slightly translucent, about 2 minutes. Stir in broth, sugar, and salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, 10 minutes. Fluff rice with a fork and discard cinnamon stick if desired.

I made this rice tonight to go with the Potato and Chorizo-stuffed ancho chiles (also in this issue). It was fabulous. My husband and guests raved. This one's a keeper.

This recipe was very easy to make and tasted quite good. I will make it again, but next time I will have to leave out the cumin, as we have just discovered that my sister is allergic to it. I may replace it with turmeric, but I'm not sure yet.

The rice was delicious and I will definately make it again. My boyfriend complained that the cinnamon flavor was too strong, but I thought it was perfect. I did not have broth on hand so I simply diluted part of a chicken bouillon cube in almost boiling water. I would modify this by adding the garlic a little later since it does not take as long to cook.
