These cookies were a hit with my family and friends. Refrigerating the dough is a must and be prepared for a flat, round cookie. I used a butter substitute and they were just as delicious!

I'm at a loss to explain how a recipe with 2 sticks of saturated fats (oops, I mean butter) might be considered a healthy and nutritious snack! It must be the adition of a bit of wheat flour...

Just like the other reviewers - cookie fail. If refrigeration is required pre-baking, the recipe should say so. My first batch was awful, hopefully they will be better after the dough refrigerates, but it's not looking good from the reviews. Very disappointed.

I used about a stick and a half of butter instead of two and refrigerated the dough for 10-20 minutes before baking. They turned out perfectly.

Cookie fail. These spread out way too thin and fell apart when cool. They have no crispness at all. Those cookies in the picture with the nice thick round edges? I don't know where those cookies came from, but the these have edges so sharp they would cut you. Except that they crumble into crumbs first.

absolutely dreamy, the perfect cookie for the chewy cookie enthusiast. FYI they flatten and run quickly. Helps to make small scoops and stick them in the freezer (8 min) before putting them in the oven. watch Watch WATCH then eat Eat EAT, YUMMY!

take the recipe name seriously; these things are flat, flat, flat and spread like crazy. this is not a "thick and chunky" (or chewy) chocolate chip cookie. make sure to bake only six to a sheet or they'll run together. for me, it was frustrating since i like to bake fewer batches. that said, they were well-received for their good taste and crispy texture.
