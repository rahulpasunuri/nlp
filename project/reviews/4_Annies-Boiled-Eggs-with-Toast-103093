You can leave the eggs out overnight. I worked at McDonald's in high school and we would leave the eggs out overnight to bring them to room temperature for the AM shift. The eggs would be out from 1 a.m. until as late as 10:30 a.m. That was over 20 years ago, so I don't know if they do it now. But I'm assuming McDonald's (and this was a corporate-owned store so we did everything as corporate said it would be done) would only do that if it were safe.

Perhaps a silly question: but how long should you cook the eggs if they have been refrigerated and are not at room temp? If I did these for breakfast, I obviously wouldn't have wanted to leave the eggs out all night to get them to room temperature.

In answer to the question of how to take the top off the egg, there is a device which is designed specifically to do this. It's hard to describe. When you put the metal ring over the egg top and squeeze the handles, little metal teeth emerge from the ring and top the egg quite cleanly. We use this receipe and the egg topper when we want to really have a special breakfast. There is something ceremonial about the whole process. Our chickens lay great eggs which makes it even better.

This was a regular meal at our house whenever Dad was in charge. We'd always have his specialty: "breakfast for dinner". In response to the last review, we used to serve the eggs in egg cups and would use the sides of our spoons to tap the shells open and lift off the "lid". Open the egg at the point it will be wide enough to dip in your toast sticks or a spoon. My favourite part was always the bit of egg white left in the lid! Gotta love Dad and his "breakfast for dinner".

This may be a silly question (most of mine are!) but, how do you cut the top off the egg? Through the shell? Is this done at the table? Or is the shell removed first?

British?! ridicule! This is a FRENCH dish, and should be enjoyed as late day meal, NEVER eggs for breakfast! That said, this dish is as simple as it is outstanding. Très merveilleux.

We have this recipe every weekend as the family shares breakfast and great coffee. We have found a couple of enhancements that seem to improve the experience. The first is that we boil the eggs for 4 minutes 15 seconds for large size US eggs which seems to give us the right level of "doneness" and second we use a small needle to prick the thick end of the egg to stop the egg bursting while boiling. Enjoy this british experience.
