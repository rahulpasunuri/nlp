This is easy, summery and delicious! I did cut back on green onions, olives & anchovies by half after making it first time and liked it even more. Also--use FRESH basil. It makes the salad along with the tomatoes, eggs & capers. Definitely a winner!

This was great and easy to make. It was really salty though. I used Ken's French Dressing. Next time I will whip up my own balsamic vinegar dressing. It is a great summer recipe.
