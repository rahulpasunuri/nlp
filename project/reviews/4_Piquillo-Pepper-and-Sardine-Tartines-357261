Wanted to love this but found it just so so. Despite the intensity of the ingredients, I found the overall effect to be somewhat mild - not the super pungent lunch I'd hoped for. I used fire-roasted red peppers, didn't have piquillo - perhaps that was the fault? I agree that it's a really healthy and easy lunch to have along with a salad. Great for someone trying to save money or to eat better.

Great recipe. This makes the best small lunch. So good.

YUM!!! So delicious and satisfying! I also have used this same combination of ingredients in a salad (minus the bread, of course) and it was delicious, filling, and super healthy. Give it a try!

This is such a simple and easy recipe. I made it for a Ladies' gathering, and everyone just raved about it!

Made this as as app for my husband and I. He expressed concern several times about the inclusion of sardines, but it was absolutely delicious! We both loved it. Very easy to make, good flavors. A nice light app. It paired well with a pinot gris. The sardines I used had both skin and bones, but were very good quality from Spain, packed in olive oil, and absolutely delicious. I will definitely make again.

I suspect, jazzybelle, that you served your guests sardines farmed in barrels instead of the "preferably wild caught" variety. Even "preferable" snobbery on a sardine sandwich makes a world of difference.

I thought these were pretty good, but my guests were not thrilled at the prospect of eating sardines. Several of them fish, and they were put off by eating "bait"... maybe in a more food-snob setting nice sardines would work.

Excellent made just as is. My kids even loved them and they were definitely not fans of sardines before this. Yum.

Delish and easy to make. The lemon juice and capers were a great contrast to the bold sardine and peppers flavors. Plan to make this as an app for next party.
