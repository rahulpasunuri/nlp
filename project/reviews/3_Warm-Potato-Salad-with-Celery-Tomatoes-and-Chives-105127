I think it was just okay. The tomatoes OR potatoes with the rest of the ingredients would probably be better; I just didn't care for the combo, and apparently neither did my guests. Nothing special.

This was disappointing after all the rave reviews. It was okay, and certainly better than deli potato salad, but it was nothing to get excited about. There were plenty of leftovers, so I think my guests shared my view.

I thought this was one of the best potato salads I have ever tasted. I used new potatoes, red wine vinegar and deleted the tomatoes. I would definitely make this for guests.

This is tasty, simple, and not overly dressed with mayonnaise. The garlic and chives helps a little dressing go a long way.

This was so good. I really liked the garlic and chive in this potato salad--they gave it a kick you don't usually expect in a potato salad. And the combination of flavors (sweet tomatoes) with textures (celery against the creaminess of the dressing and the potatoes) was really superb.

Interesting medley, making for complete vegetable accompaniments. Quick, easy, tasty. I served the salad with a breaded pork chop. The moistness of the salad counterbalanced the dry chop.

I've also served this salad cold, and it's always received lots of compliments.

This was a hit at our 4th of July barbeque! I made it exactly as directed and I received requests for the recipe.

This was a fantastic salad. Not too creamy, and the tomatoes add a great touch! I now make it for all potluck dinners and get rave reviews!

This was a pleasant change from the usual potato salad or others. I will make this again to bring to a BBQ at a friend's house - definitely will be a crowd pleaser.

Good eating, especially when made with cherry tomatoes fresh from our garden. The leftovers were good cold too!

Great recipe. I omitted the tomatoes though and still had rave reviews from friends and family.
