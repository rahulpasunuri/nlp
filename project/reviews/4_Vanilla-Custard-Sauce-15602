Great recipe! The only thing I changed was to add 2 pieces of cooked finely chopped bacon, gave it an amazing flavor!

Yum :) Don't buy the vanilla bean- it's just not worth it. I put about two tsp of vanilla extract in and there was enough vanilla flavor.

This sauce is totally delectable! It's yummy warm, it's delicious chilled, you can taste every ingredient. I added some cinnamon to the cream at the beginning, and like someone here suggested, I just used a couple of capfuls of vanilla extract in place of a vanilla bean. (In addition to saving the expense, I didn't have strain it, either.) It's so easy to make, and people I served it to (as a dip with the delicious banana raviolis) LOVED it.

So stinkin' easy and so stinkin' good. This sauce was so creamy, light and flavorful. It was like a party in my mouth and it went so great with the banana ravioli's, which were also so amazing and easy to make. You have got to try them together!!! It's such a fun and different dessert to have when company is over.

This is a keeper! Made cinnamon custard by steeping cinnamon in the cream for 20 minutes and then added to the eggs. Served with spiced honey cake and carmelized apples for Rosh Hashanah. Everyone loved it!

I made this sauce to go over baked apples. The apples were yummy, but the sauce was killer! We finished our apples then went and ate the leftover custard sauce by the spoonful! DELICIOUS! Also, this was a suprisingly easy recipe to make. This recipe is going in my recipe box because I know I will be using it again and again.

This was an excellent vanilla custard sauce. I didn't make the raviolis, but needed the sauce for another dessert, and it was perfect. If you've never made a suace like this, be careful when you add the hot cream to the egg yolks. Do it very slowly so the eggs don't cook and get lumpy.

As I wrote on the accompanying recipe of banana ravioli, this sauce is perfection! There are no words to describe the taste sensation. Even though I didn't have a vanilla bean (too expensive) and used 2 capfuls of pure vanilla instead, I can't imagine any way it could have been better.

Sauce is delicious.Made it to go over the banana ravioli and it is superb.Sauce could be used for many other desserts.I'm thinking of something like berries etc.But once when I made the sauce I accidentally left it on the burner until it just started boiling so it turned out thicker than it should.It was still very good and again could be used on other desserts where you wanted a little thicker sauce.Excellent!
