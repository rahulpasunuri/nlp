One of my all-time favorite side- dishes. Try roasting the pecans for a few minutes before hand to really bring their flavor out.

This was fantastic! I made it with my Christmas prime rib roast. (Without the arugula)To do ahead I put it in a casserole smashed with nuts and cheese and about 2/3 cup of lite sour cream with just a drizzle of EVO to cut the fat, (I have to creatively cut fat due to health concerns) Then I topped it with more cheese and pecans, dusting with smoked paprika... at that point just held it (I think this helped to blend the flavors too) until I was ready and popped it in the oven with the Yorkshire puddings to re-heat and brown the top a bit.... Awesome! Great compliment to prime rib! The pecans and cheese give it that real "holiday" flavor.

I loved this recipe! I used it for one of my lunches that go with a spa package in my dayspa. I highly recommend it. I ground the pecans, I think it makes a better texture.

we didn't have pecans so we omitted them in this recipe - i think this was a mistake, because the gorgonzola completely overpowered the potatoes. still, i think the pecans would have added the touch of sweetness to balance out the cheese, and the arugula was a nice touch.

This was delicious, especially after it had sat for a while and the cheese taste blended in. I don't generally eat potatoes, but the is definitely a great way to serve them.

My local grocery store didn't have a good variety of potatoes, so I ended up using red potatoes. It still turned out wonderful. I served it with grilled pork chops and everyone loved it. I'll try it again with different potatoes next time.

I really want to make this recipe but I don't know where to find heirloom potatoes - anyone have a suggestion for an alternative - would yukon golds be appropriate?
