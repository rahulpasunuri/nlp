This pie is awesome! Made it for the first time today with a mix of frozen and fresh blueberries and it turned out great. The topping is crunchy and the berries are not runny. Wonderful taste with just a hint of citrus from the lemon. Will make this again. I'm thinking of trying this recipe with a mix of raspberries and blueberries or just raspberries. I'll let you know how they turn out.

I used Pillsbury refrigerated pie dough, which I often do, but if you do, DO NOT blind bake it as long as this says. The original 20 minutes with weights (I use glass vase fillers) would have been enough. My crust was too dark, and I had to rim it with foil to bake with the filling. The filling is the best part. It has perfect consistency. Next time I will halve the lemon and omit the cinnamon in the crumble. Otherwise, we loved it.

Excellent recipe for blueberries! I am not a big blueberry pie fan, but this was delicious! It's very easy to make, not too sweet, and the blueberries don't dominate the recipe too much. The crust is very good. The only problem I had was that the crust stuck to the dish - but I think that was because some of the filling overflowed around the crust. So I'm not sure how to solve that for the future, but it still beautiful and exceptionally tasty. I will make this again. I don't recommend changing anything about the recipe either.

Excellent blueberry pie recipe; I made it exactly as written. Typically I am not a blueberry pie fan - I make it for others in my family who love it at this time of year during blueberry season. This was the first blueberry pie recipe that I really enjoyed eating! The filling is not gooey like so many blueberry pie recipes - the berries stay whole and do not become too jam-like. Since the recipe does not specify, I chose to use a deep dish pie plate and would recommend this size to others - the filling did not boil over in the oven and the fruit filled the dish. Next time I would wait at least 2 hours before serving to allow the juices in the filling to fully set. A great recipe!

Following the directions for the crust made it a cinch to roll, in fact the easiest pie crust I have ever made. YUM YUM

This is such an easy and incredibly delicious dessert! I keep frozen mixed berries in my freezer so that I can throw this together easily without any trouble.

This is a fantastic recipe. I have never made a "pretty pie" because the top crust is so elusive; the crumble topping solves this problem. I used 2 lb of frozen blueberries and followed the recipe as written except for the addition of 1/4 tsp of cardomom to the filling. Great flavor. It was the best blueberry pie ever. This recipe is a keeper.

Yum!!! This was the best pie I have ever made! From now on I think I will just use a crumble instead of pie crust on top of all my pies. It had a nice balance of sweet and salty. Delicious.

Loved this recipe!! It was easy to use, and I've already made it twice! Both times, I followed the other reviewers' suggestions to only use half the sugar (white and brown) for the topping. That was a great call. The second time I made this, I put a little more sugar in with the berries (maybe 1/8 cup) and about a teaspoon of lemon zest. That was a great add! I had used 2 cups blackberries (fresh) and 4 cups blueberries (frozen) and the berry part was a little too tart the first time. The extra sugar and lemon gave it such a nice flavor! I will definitely make this again. Super easy and a big crowd-pleaser!

Outstanding recipe! My mom said it was the best blueberry pie she's ever had - and husband had seconds! Used frozen Wyman's berries and added 3 tbs instant tapioca. I also used a store-bought crust since I'm terrible with pie crust. Yum - Yum - Yum! Served with vanilla ice cream.

Fantastic! I chose this recipe when I wanted to make a blueberry pie because of the accent of lemon in the filling and for the hint of cinnamon in the crumble topping--delicious!! Great recipe that I'd easily make again.

It turned out better than I expected. Smelled perfect. Time consuming the first time around, but it was a treat to have.

Everything about this pie is delicious! The crust, although kind of pain to make, turned out perfectly. I did 2.5 cups of blueberries and 2.5 cups of blackberries for the filling, which worked out fine. I didn't have to leave it in the over for nearly as long as recommended, though.

Fabulous! My filling was perfect. It had great flavor and great texture, which I attribute to the awesome blueberries I bought for this pie. The topping is delicious, too, and complements the blueberries wonderfully. So far, my favorite pie of the summer!

Something was missing with this pie. I wanted to love it, but I just couldn't. It looked beautiful, and the crust and crumb topping were fine, but the filling just fell flat. I'm wondering if my berries just weren't that great. In any case, I won't be rushing to make this again.

First pie I ever made. Fantastic! Received rave reviews from dinner party friends.

Have made this twice so far and with rave reviews. Did not need to cook as long as stated and it did flow over th crust a bit. Served with homemade vanilla ice cream. One of our favorites.

What a delicious and straight-forward recipe. Made it for a summer birthday dessert party and took home an empty pie pan. The hint of lemon is a wonderful compliment. A good reminder about chilling the crust, I actually chilled it in the freezer and had zero shrinking.

This was excellent. Like janetlebeau, I used the Cook's Illustrated Foolproof Pie Dough, but otherwise followed the recipe. The filling has great flavor and the bake time was spot-on in my oven. I found that the pie needed to sit for ~1 hour after baking before I could make a clean cut (certainly you could eat it before then, but the filling would be more runny). Gorgeous and delicious!

I have made this pie twice. I used my own recipe for the piecrust, (Cook's Illustrated Foolproof Pie Dough). It is very important to chill the pie shell before you blind bake it as it will shrink if you don't. The filling is amazing and the crumble very tasty. Be sure to let the blueberries sit in the sugar and cornstarch mixture as instructed so that the berries begin to release their juices. A bit hit with everyone in my family.

My husband asked me to make this pie as he was flipping through the new bon appetit and it was FAB-U-LOUS! Super simple and not very time consuming. The little hint of lemon... mmmm, so good. It's got an excellent taste that compliments anything he's grilling up.
