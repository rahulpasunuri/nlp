So easy, quick and tasty. I cut sugar in half and substituted Splenda for 1/2 the brown sugar. Also used whole wheat pastry flour. After 2 minutes, caked were far from done so I microwaved another minute, but this was too much. 2.5 minutes may be the sweet spot. Also a little dry from overbaking and perhaps too little brown sugar. But these were so good even with my failures I will make again and continue to tweak. BTW even with half the sugar they were plenty sweet for me (I don't like my chocolate very sweet.)

I've made this three times (always omitting the raisins) and it takes less than 15 minutes start to finish. (I had to microwave it for an extra minute or so.) I frosted it with cream cheese frosting and turned it into a mini birthday cake.

This cake turned out great! And I can see potential to make it richer by using cream instead of eggs, or maybe melted chocolate rather than chocolate powder. However, there is one mistake in the recipe, in the ingredient list it calls for baking powder, but in the direction it says to add baking soda. I went with baking powder and it turned out okay.

Super-easy and comforting, has that lovely gooey texture. Not fancy but always turns out. I've made this with raisins and rum, and also with dates and craberries. Works with whole wheat pastry flour as well.

We substituted razzcherries and amaretto, then cooked at 60% power (had to choose between 40% and 60%) . We didn't make glaze because the cakes were a little saucy anyway. Real cake texture, quick preparation, and chocolate satisfaction all without heating up the kitchen!
