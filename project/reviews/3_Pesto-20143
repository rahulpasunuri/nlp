I use parsley (not Italian parsley) instead of basil because it is so much cheaper and more available. I must prefer the flavor. You have to "strip" the leaves of the parsley from the stems otherwise the pesto will be "woody". I also add grated parmesan cheese. Also, I use toasted or raw walnuts instead of pine nuts. Walnuts produce a much better flavor. Kay Schroeder Addictive!

I tried this recipe recently using a stone mortar-and- pestel and loved it as-is! Perfect pesto. As for salt, I let everyone add their own. However, I would add salt to the mixture beforehand if serving guests, about 1 tsp or to taste. I would not add it if making this for the purposes of cooking the accompanying turkey recipe, however. I also tried it as follows, for pizza: I boiled one very small yellow onion and one serrano pepper (until they were soft) instead of the parsley. After removing them from the water, I ground everything with a mortar & pestal, which was a bit of work, but everything was left a little chunky. I used a store-bought pizza dough in a can and rolled it out, on top of which I added the pesto mixture. I topped that with shredded mozzerella and placed in the oven at 400 degrees for about 10 minutes, until the cheese became a golden brown. It was fantastic! Glad to have the recipe!

Add salt and parm cheese. I like mixing this with pasta, steamed broccoli and grape tomatoes.

I make this and freeze a huge batch divided into small containers every summer after I harvest my home-grown basil. I increase the garlic (at least double) and add the parmesan after I thaw it out when I'm ready to use it.

This makes perfect pesto, you can add 1/2 cup of grated parm cheese for more flavor.
