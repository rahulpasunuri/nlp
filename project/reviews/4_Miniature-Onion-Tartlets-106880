Delicious! I usually keep the anchovy paste a secret from guests...and tell them after they've raved about how good they are. I've already made it for a couple of parties and never have any left.

Very good, simple recipe which you can make ahead of time and then assemble at the last minute before guests arrive. I would recommend (as another cook suggested) doubling the onion--using perhaps 2 medium onions instead of one large one. Overall, very tasty and impressive. You can't go wrong with this one if you need to serve fancy appetizers or amuse bouches.

Just hopped on to double check a recipe I am using today..and figured I would rate these while I am here. They were wonderful! Served them at Christmas Eve and everyone, even the picky eaters, raved about them. Easy & impressive. Definately worth a try.

This takes a bit more time than the recipe indicates. I thought it could use much more onion than was called for. Very nice flavor but not quite as good as I expected (though I think mine may have been overshadowed by other appetizers at a tapas-style New Year's party). I'll make them again for a wine tasting party.
