This was a terrific dessert. Made the cake recipe exactly as given. It would be great for guests who don't want flour (or butter!) It certainly could stand on its own, or with a raspberry sauce, or with oranges. Made a slight change to the creme anglaise - I didn't have any cream so used 3/4 cup milk and a teaspoon of cornstarch - otherwise the same. I loved its delicate flavour - glad I resisted the urge to add vanilla or orange extract. And I used an apple instead of a pear, only because it was all I had. It was still fabulous, but I think a pear would have been even better.
