This was great for my whole family as a complete meal with artisan sourdough bread.

I used the recipe in the actual cookbook, which had a huge error in the quantity of chicken broth used to cook the potatoes. Thank goodness for Epicurious, which corrected the error! I liked the texture of the soup, but the taste was way too bland. It needed lots of salt and pepper, just for starters. Not sure what else could be added besides bacon.

Based on the reviews for this recipe, I had my reservations going in but wanted to try it anyway. I seriously modified it and think it turned out awesome. I used 6 red potatos, peeled and cubed. Added a bit more of the chicken broth initially to compensate. Chopped bacon, cooked it and set it aside to dry. Then in the bacon grease I cooked half a red onion, some scallions and 2 cloves of garlic. Dumped that mix into the crock pot. Rather than blending or using our pitifully small food processor, I used a ricer on the 2/3 potatos. Mixed that with the remaining chicken stock and put it back in the crock pot. I increased the cheese a bit; 1 1/4 cup extra sharp cheddar and 1 1/4 cup smoked gouda. Also, 1/2 cup sour cream. For seasoning, I did salt and pepper to taste and eyeballed some paprika (maybe like a tbsp or 1 1/2 tbsp). Skipped the chives. Let people add bacon and extra cheese. It turned out very yummy (and probably very bad for you). Good texture, nice amount of tanginess, not overly rich or cheesy. All the work is in the chopping and grating, really, but there's a lot of it. It's a fun meal to make if you have a friend helping you out. I'd totally do (my revised version of) this recipe again.

I love this basics of this soup, and didn't find it to be bland one bit. Adjustments...I used garlic powder instead of fresh, a pinch of salt, and cut the recipe in 1/2. I left out the cream and cheese topping. I think it's rich and flavorful.

Excellent! Easy and everyone liked it.

This was just too bland for me. Someone recommended maybe adding bacon and I could see that helping out, but for now, I wouldn't recommend this recipe.

Not bad! I used Yukon Golds and green onions instead of chives...followed other reviewers' advice and sweated a yellow onion and extra garlic to blitz in step 2 with the potatoes. I agree that it still needs a little something (bacon? ham?), but with a salad for a light dinner, it was nice.

I made the southwestern version of this soup. I added come Tapatio and I was pleased with the results. Next time I may not use to slow cooker though. My idea of a wonderful slow cooker recipe is just adding all the ingredients and then forgetting about it for 4 or 5 hours!

After 2 hours in the slow cooker my potatoes were barely cooked. I put them in a pot and cooked them. Flavor is so so, kinda bland. I added extra garlic too. Won't be making this again

I cooked 1 onion and 2 cloves of garlic and added it to the potatoes and stock as another reviewer suggested. I also added a few dashes of hot sauce at the end and omitted the chives. I think the soup has a great consistency and tastes great.

I def. listened to other reviewers - doubled the garlic and sauteed it with onion before adding 3C broth & the potatoes. I'm not sure why you would make this in a slow cooker...it's much faster on the stove (probably should be in the quick meal section!). Didn't have chives, but added more cheese, lots of fresh ground black pepper and Sherry (magic!) and also some crumbled bacon on top w/ the extra cheddar cheese. With changes, a keeper on a cold night with a loaf of bread!

It was just okay. A little bland for my tastes. I did use a lot more garlic, added cream, extra chives, some thyme...still it needed something. Onions and bacon, probably.

I thought this recipe was really good and very easy. I used two cloves of garlic. I used 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 smoked gouda, and I stirred in about 1/2 cup sour cream, instead of the heavy cream. Clearly, the 1 2/3 cup chicken stock is a misprint. I used the 1 cup for the first step, and then added the remaining 3 cups during step two. I heated it in the slow cooker on high for 2 hours.

This is a great soup. Did a double batch along with some chicken burgers. Really something. Takes a bit of prep slicing all the potatoes and such, but totally worth it.

bad, really bad. no, it was awful.

I made this on the stove, steaming the potatoes in the broth only took about 15 minutes. I pureed the potatoes in my blender which left me with a glue- like consistancy, I should have known better than to do that. Even after adding the additional stock & half-and-half, I was still left with watered down glue. It was a quick dinner, with potential so I will try this again, but next time I will just mash the potatoes with a masher or ricer.

soup is delicious, recipe needs editing. Place atleast 3 cups of stock in slow cooker at the beginning, not one cup.

I pulsed approx 10 slices of turkey bacon in the food processor and sauted it with the garlic then added it to chicken broth before I added the potatoes to the slow cooker. This gave the potatoes wonderful flavor and much needed boost to the end result. I followed the rest of the recipe as dirceted except I skipped the milk/cream and just used broth to thin the puree instead.

I made this tonight. The potatoes took longer to cook than 2 hours (I think it took closer to 4 hrs) so its in the fridge for tomorrow. I used a 5lb bag of golden potatoes which might have contributed to the extra time. I was pleased with how it turned out. It has a mild flavor, but not in a bad way, though I did double the garlic and use about a cup of chives. If you like flavor  you might want to add even more. This is a method of making potato soup that I hadnt tried before. Ive never cooked potatoes with so little liquid (they were almost baked / steamed). The small amount of liquid combined with putting them in the blender made an exceptionally thick soup. I was pleased with this b/c it solves the common complaint in my house that soups are too thin w/o having to use a ton of cream. I added the cream this time because I had bought it  but next time Ill probably just add whole milk. As several people have mentioned  you dont need to use all 4 cups of broth  just the 1 2/3 c plus how ever much it takes to thin it to your liking. Also, the potatoes really strained my blender. I havent had any other signs that it might be dying  but by the end of the blending  it was hardly able to turn the blades. Once the potatoes were out- it didnt have any problems. Next time, I think Ill add the 2/3 c broth to the blender instead of adding it after returning the blended potatoes to the pot.

While I loved the flavors I doubled the garlic and chives. I also like my potato soup to be really chunky so I doubled the amount of potatoes.

The first pass at this was not so great. Doctored the left over with a few chopped green onions, parsley and 4 chicken bulion cubes... then the following day, after the flavors had time to meld, it was certainly worth eating.

This dish is easy to prepare but not the most flavorful. However, I did not add milk or cream because I wanted to keep the dish from being too rich. I found the texture to be good after using a blender. It does taste better with some crumbled bacon on top and fresh chives are needed as garnsih.

I borrowed the cookbook from the library and notice 2 ingredients are different in the book than online - the book says 6 potatoes and 1 2/3 cups chicken stock (plus more as needed). Everything else looks consistent. Hope this helps.

I made the recipe with the chives and the sour cream. The flavor wasn't too bad, but I cooked the potatoes in the slow cooker for 3 hours and they still weren't completely done. I used most of them in the puree and we just picked out the undercooked chunks. The recipe calls for 4 cups of chicken stock, but after reading the recipe 4 times, I could only find where to use 1 2/3 cups. I added most of it at the beginning and used just a little bit in the puree. I probably won't make this again, but if I do, it needs something else. It tasted like something was missing.

I use a crockpot so I don't have to babysit the meal, so I can walk away for a few hours and come back to a meal. The first step is to cook the potatoes for 2 hours in the crock, which makes no sense to me since they can cook in a skillet in 15 minutes. So that's how I started out. Once that was done, there was no more point in finishing in the crock either so I did the whole shebang on the stove top. The recipe calls for "4 cups stock plus extra", but it only tells you how to use 1 2/3 cups... so I wasn't sure what to do with the rest and probably ruined soup by guessing what to do. In the end, I added the cilantro instead of the chives, but it really didn't give it any flavor, so I sliced up some hot italian sausages I had in the fridge and put those in. Eh. My family ate it all and didn't complain, but it was a really weird concoction. I won't make it again.
