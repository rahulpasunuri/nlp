Not sure what happened tonight...nothing I made turned out. How can you screw up aioli? Maybe my smoked paprika was no good...bought recently from the bulk barn. Or maybe too much garlic overpowered the smoked paprika flavor. I omitted the tomato paste maybe shouldn't have.

This is great! I used half sweet and half smoked pimenton, and half Greek yogurt and half Saffola (safflower oil mayo).

Forgot to mention that I added a bit of harissa (from a tube) to the mayo mixture, which had the Spanish smoked paptrika and tomato paste. Excellent.

I made these tasty little cakes with halibut and loved them, but am anxious to try them out with a less expensive fish next time. I was also rather wary about the amount of garlic due to many other comments, but wound up using only one less than the six called for and didn't find it overwhelming in the least. A great alternative to gefilte fish, which I love, but this is definitely worth making. As others have mentioned the aoili is a must too.

I cut the recipe in half and used two instead of the recommended 4 garlic cloves. I think maybe I should have used more cayenne pepper to make it hotter, but it was delicious with the mahi mahi just the way it was. I will definitely make it again.

Sauce was good but I would reduce the garlic next time. I used the Tunisian fish cake recipe but made them crab cakes instead. For the rest of the sauce I used it as a dip for fresh veggies - very good!

Delicous as is! We've used with the Tunisian fish cakes as well as crab cakes. Fresh, quality paprika makes all the difference.

Made this with salmon cakes. Delicious, just a little spicy. Would make again. This would be great with calamari!

I give this recipe four forks because it definately has potential. It needs some revision and this is what I did. The previous reviewer was correct that 6 cloves of garlic is too much. Definately use no more than four. It also needed something besides mayo as a base. I added low fat half and half,some dry white wine and dijon mustard to cut heavy mayo taste. I also blended in some capers and added a bit more lemon. After the revisions, the sauce aioli was fantastic.

Nice and garlicky. I used hot Hungarian Paprika and it worked wonderfully.

great sauce, i used it for frito misto, we love garlic but a little too much cut it down to three cloves and used the cayene pepper not paparika.
