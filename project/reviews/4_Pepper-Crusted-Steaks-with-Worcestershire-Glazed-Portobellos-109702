I made this for a post Christmas family dinner - OH SO GOOD!!!! I used two 1-pound rib-eyes and 8-ounces of white sliced mushrooms that I didn't grill. I sauteed the mushrooms with butter, worcestershire, etc. until they were done and used the mushrooms as a topping on the steak along with the butter. I grilled the steaks on high for about 3 minutes per side - excellent:)

The mushrooms in such a simple sauce tastes SOOOO GOOD it turns a 3 fork into a 4 fork!It may be that butter tastes good with mushrooms, but hubby loved the sauce, he says I have to keep this on file, served mushrooms on grilled steak and raw baby spinach warmed mushrooms softened spinach just enough.Turned into kinda a warm steak salad. Try it and see.

This sounded much better than it tasted -- the steaks were great but that is because they were quality meat to start with. The whole point of this recipe for me was the mushrooms and I found them very ho-hum. Unlikely to make again -- I'd rather do them with brandy or sherry.

Excellent and easy to make. Used angus steaks and they were fabulous.

This is excellent! The mushrooms are so good that I have made them several times with other things. They are super on burgers.

This was exceptionally delicious. I am not a huge lover of beef but this was tasty. Of course, dry aged steak from Whole Foods Market didn't hurt! Great flavors and very simple.

Wow! Made as directed but grilled on the George Foreman, 7 min per steak and 3 min with open lid for the mushrooms and it was fabulous!! Definately a keeper.

I tried this recipe strictly because of all the wonderful comments i read regarding the mushrooms, and, seeing as how i never really cared for any type of mushroom, i decided to give it a shot for exploration's sake. I can, without a doubt, say I will never turn back. They were outstanding... I had heard of mushrooms described as "meaty" before, but I never really understood until cooking them in worcestershire quite how "meaty" a vegetarian item could taste. I am truly a changed man. Cheers, from a carnivore.

I've made the mushrooms on several occasions, and they are an awesome and so simple way to accompany a steak. I purchased pepper crusted steaks from my butcher, and topped them with Gorgonzola Butter (Look it up, also on Epi). As a side, I serve with potato salad, and it makes for a delicious and rich dinner, that doesn't heat up the whole house on a summer night. Yum!

WONDERFUL!!! thanks for the time and criss-cross tips, they really helped this first timer.

I was expecting more from the mushrooms. General concesus was not to bother next time. Reduced butter by half, thankfully as it was still a lot. Will stick to a simple brush of olive oil with salt & pepper next time.

Outstanding recipe. The mushrooms are great with any dish.

This is an incredibly rich and meaty dish. The mushrooms can stand alone as an entree, yet they compliment the steaks well. I used high quality New York steaks and they were divine! My guests raved and raved.

the mushrooms steal the show in this recipe. i used very expensive, very high quality steaks, and still found myself neglecting the meat and wishing i had more of the mushrooms. they are so flavorful. i did make this recipe once in the broiler, however, and the mushrooms did not have the same charm, so they really need to be grilled.

This is my favorite dish to make for company, as we have our own beef always available. Try it with different cuts of choice and prime beef. The mushrooms are fabulous - I've made grilled sandwiches with the mushrooms for vegetarian guests.

This is one of our favorite dishes-the mushrooms are beyond compare! The only difference is I don't slice the mushrooms before grilling, and lots of black pepper is a must. Try it! It is great!

The steaks and the mushrooms were fabulous...will definitely be making this often!

Wonderful flavor with the pepper and salt rub. Our gas grill gave out after the steaks were done, so we turned up the heat on the skillet on the stove top, with the portebella's, and added a couple tablespoons of red wine to the pan to reduce the liquid. Wonderful!

Great taste. Only complaint way to much butter. Would make again, but with less butter or leave it off the steaks.

Only made the mushrooms (kids won't eat peppercorns on their steak) but they were OUTSTANDING--husband said best Portobello mushrooms he's ever had--so rich...will definitely make for guests!

This dish was delicious and the portobellos were scrumptuous! Would absolutely make for company.

This was absolutely delicious! The steak is good, but it's really the outstandingly scrumptious mushrooms that make this dish, in our opinion. I would double the mushrooms just to have more on hand to top mashed potatoes or toss with pasta.

Awesome! Served to company and was a hit - the mushrooms are fantastic. I will definately make the mushrooms again as a sidedish at many meals. Great recipe!

I made this last night, used ribeye steaks, seasoned them with garlic, monteral steak seasoning. Made the mushrooms exactly as the receipe called for. This was a great mead everyone enjoyed it. Will make this one again and again......

Even our baby loves the mushrooms! We've made this several times this summer. Easy and delicious.

Mnay grocery stores now have vegetarian Worcestershire sauce without the anchovies. Even though it's a statement, some vegetarians just plain don't want meat touching their food. I don't see that as a problem. Cook the portobello in foil on the grill.

I did not use New York Strip Steaks. They came in large portion size that I know I couldn't consume. Instead, I used small, round rib-eye steaks and added a teaspoon of Worcester and soy source, along with some red and black pepers to marinate. Afer I grilled the steak, I just threw the mushrooms in (no need to have them sizzle with the source first, as the recipe indicated). To expedite the process of making the source, I melted the butter in the Microwave first; mixed it with worcester source and balsamic vinegar (portion indicated in the recipe); and putted it back to the Microwave for another 30-second. voilà, poured the hot source on top of the steak, it's delicious! Definitely will make this again.

The pepper-crusted steak was pretty good but I think there are better pepper steak recipes out there but the mushrooms were wonderful!!! Everyone at our 4th of July dinner raved about the mushrooms!

I am a vegetarian, but I would not freak out if somehow I ingested a few molecules of meat because someone touched my grilled mushrooms with the fork used for flipping the steaks. For most people, vegetarianism is a statement - a statement made by the "action" of not eating animal products and/or byproducts. That statement is not lost if you accidentally consume trace amounts of someone else's hamburger, etc. Besides, we are ingesting all kinds of living organisms on a daily basis, without really being aware.

We use 1/2 of our grill for the meat eaters and the othe 1/2 for us. We also have 2 sets of tools

Great recipe.. basic and difficult to goof. For the veggie folks and with regard to substitutes for anchovies... go capers. Yup.. might be a problem for you with curdling in some sauces but otherwise, an acceptable change for the same flavor.

I only made the mushrooms from this recipe, and served them with grilled whole tenderloin and grilled zucchini & eggplant. I used regular old button mushrooms, but rather large ones, and left them whole. They were fantastic, I should have alotted more than 3 per person! Definitely the best way to grill mushrooms, yum!

This is a very good recipe-I have used other cuts of meat also-It's real good with the filet migon!!I add a little lemon zest to this too.

You both make excellent points. I am a vegetarian, so I use reduced sodium Worcestershire sauce - it doesn't have anchovies. It can be found in most regular grocery stores.

Just thought of something else regarding the previous poster's comment about preparing this for a vegetarian. It also wouldn't be a very good idea to grill the mushrooms on the same grill after you cooked the meat if you were going to offer the mushrooms to vegetarian friends.

Rating: 0
I haven't made this, so just a question. I read a suggestion to double the mushrooms if you're expecting vegetarians. Well, the mushrooms are cooked in Worcestershire, and Worcestershire lists anchovies among its ingredients. Is there some vegetarian substitute for Worcestershire that I'm not aware of? I've been wondering this for a while, and this recipe just reminded me to ask. Thanks.

I thought this was extremely easy. Everyone loved it. I wouldn't change a thing.
