There are much better steak salad recipes. This was so-so.

I thought it was great, but I did do the previous suggestion of marinading the steak. I thought that the flavor of the marinaded steak would be overpowering if I used all of the dressing that the recipe called for, so I poured on the dressing afterward to taste.

I made this dish as part of a buffet for a big party (mulitplied quantites several times!) and it was a big hit. I followed other reviewers' advice and marinated the steak overnight before preparing the dish. The steak itself was delicious. Used regular mustard rather than dry mustard in the dressing. Also, I didn't think the idea of dressing the salad hours before sounded good (I thought it would "cook" the watercress too much) so I just dressed it right before serving. But I'm curious if anyone else has an opinion about this. Anyway, I think this is a great way to serve steak for a party because it can be all prepared in advance.

I thought this recipe was okay as is, but when I made it again with major variations my family thought it was much better. I marinated the steak as suggested by the previous reviewer. Instead of dry mustard however, I used a small amount of dijon mustard (in both the marinade and dressing). I heated the olive oil for the dressing over medium heat, then added the garlic, stirring for about 5 to10 seconds; then added the dijon and vinegar, whisking to blend. Instead of red onion, I added roasted, carmalized shallots (peeled and halved; tossed with olive oil and salt; baked @ 450-degrees for 30 mins). I also tossed the cherry tomatoes with a bit of olive oil, then "blistered" the skin under the broiler. Additionally, I added crumbled blue cheese. I also used baby spinach leaves instead of watercress and served the salad warm. The changes made it a more "hearty" meal. Serve with crusty bread and you'll have a wonderful dinner.

This is the basis for a great summer meal and our whole family enjoyed it. I marinated the flank steak in red wine, garlic, mustard and olive oil for several hours before grilling it and I also left out the tomatoes because I thought there might just be to many competing flavors.

I love meat! So when I had to bring a salad to a salad dinner, I used this recipe. Everyone loved it! It was easy and lends itself to fast Italian cooking.

This was a very good picnic salad. A nice change of pace from all the pasta salads people usually bring. I added the steak to the grill one night after I finished grilling another meal. Wrapped the steak and chilled to use the next day. Big time saver!
