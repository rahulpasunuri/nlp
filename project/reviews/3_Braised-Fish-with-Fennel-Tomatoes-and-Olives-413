This a great basic recipe. I like to add a bit of saffron, some grated orange peel and a lot more garlic than the recipe calls for. I've tried all sort of fish fillets but I think the tastiest version was using sea scallops, brushed with some olive oil and topped with panko breadcrumbs before baking.

I harvested a lot of green tomatoes which tasted great in this dish. I chopped up a finger-sized leek, used white wine instead of clam juice and added a couple of TBS of finely chopped Moroccan pickled lemon to give more depth of flavor. I braised the combination in a small le Crueset oval oven which transferred easily to the cook top without over-cooking the Turbot in the 450 oven. It was quick, easy and delicious and helped use up those green tomatoes!

I made this recipe last night, but made a few changes which added a lot more flavor. I used 1/2 cup of dry white wine instead of the water/clam juice. I also added a teaspoon and a half of Herbs de Provence to the vegetables and sprinkled the fish with the herbs as well. I used baby grape tomatoes which added a burst of sweet flavor, and added haricot vert to the sliced fennel mixture for a bright green contrast. I also salt and peppered the veggies before baking. Try it this way and you will be much more pleased with the flavor, and the juice is great for dipping pieces of French rustic baguette.

We loved this. Used halibut, because...well, just for the halibut. (rimshot) Yes, it's much easier to transfer the veggies after brazing and reduce in a sauce pan. The fennel gives the whole dish a light aromatic flavor, and you can add just enough kalamata olives to give it a salty punch. Very healthy and tasty.

A good light and healthy one for after the holiday feasting. I substituted one can of diced tomatoes in juice for the chopped tomatoes and water/clam juice. Used talipia because it was what I had in freezer. I baked in a glass dish and then transferred the veggies to a skillet for the reduction (much easier than trying to use the baking pan and the fish stays nice and warm in the baking dish-so no increased number of dishes to wash. It makes the list of easy fish meals to repeat!

The fish was bland and the veggies were overcooked. Plus, I found it awkward to use the baking pan on top of the stove to reduce the liquid. A better approach might be stove-top braising or cooking in parchment paper or foil.

This is a fantastic, fail-proof recipe. I used a combination of fennel and celery and cod as the fish. Served it Sat. night at a dinner party for 8 and received raves reviews - everyone wanted a copy. The taste is so very bright and healthy as well. Because the dish is tightly covered in foil, the vegetables as well as the fish come out perfectly braised.

Nice dish. We liked it alot! It's an easy way to serve veggies. I used celery, as the fennel bulb we get here is much too strong. I upped the fennel seed and the sauce indredients a bit and used grouper, as that is what we had. I served it with al dente pasta mixed with good olive oil and chopped basil, and had sliced tomatoes on the side. A very healthy meal!

This was quick and easy. Next time I will add a bit more crushed fennel seed and maybe some oregano and garlic. I agree that it is good, but could be a bit more flavorful.

I thought this was pretty boring. The olives and basil had a nice flavor but I couldn't really taste the fennel.

I thought this was good, easy-to-prepare recipe. The fennel was wonderful. However, it's hard to tell when the fish is done, and mine ended up being over-cooked. I'll have to be more careful next time!

I would add a few more herbs and some orange peel, to give more character to the dish., Basically, it's a good idea, it just needs to be intensified.
