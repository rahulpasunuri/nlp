The recipe from the Seattle reviewer is great, followed it with just 2 minor changes: used 3 bay leaves for extra flavor and added 10 whole cloves. Everybody loved i! If you live in New York, Schaller & Weber is a great place to go for the sauerkraut, ham and sausages.

Hooray for the reviewer from Seattle!! I used her recipe with no changes. Used beef brats and regular knockwurst. HUGE hit at an Alsatian wine tasting. Everyone is demanding the recipe and my family wants more, more, more. The recipe given may be great, but I think I will stick with Seattle.

I like this recipe. It's easy. My son cooked it today for my birthday, he was home from school.We can't find knockwurst here, so we use polska kielbasa.He put it in the crockpot at noon and it will be ready for supper at six.

Following the receipe of the cook from Seattle above, I omitted the bacon and cooked the onion in olive oil. I added 5 chicken legs with thighs to the slow cooker and the next morning added 5 diced apples and 2 pints of apple juice. This gave me the sweetness I desired, and I had to stop tasting this sauerkrant/chicken/apple "soup" (the chicken had become quite macerated in the cooker overnight, and I of course removed all the bones I could find) and turn to breakfast fare.

I love Alsatian style sauerkraut. This is NOT Alsatian sauerkraut. It's missing several essential ingredients. If you want REAL Alsatian sauerkraut here's what you do - exact measurements are not needed: Dice about 1/4 lb bacon. Add it to a large skillet with a large chopped onion and a large chopped cooking apple. Add 6-9 dried crushed juniper berries, a bay leaf and about a teaspoon of caraway seed (pepper to taste if desired). Cook over medium heat unitl the onion is soft and pale yellow. Stir in about 1 to 2 lbs of deli style sauerkraut (don't use canned or ANYTHING soured with vinegar, read the ingredients!). You can drain the kraut or not - it's personal taste (Alsatian French tend to drain and rinse; Alsatian Germans tend not to drain it). Add about 3/4 cup of Rhine/Alsatian dry white wine and enough chicken stock to keep the kraut moist while cooking (maybe 1/2 cup). Add a smoked piece of pork (such as a ham hock). Cover and either simmer on very low heat for 3 hours, or bake for 3-4 hours at 300, or transfer to a slow cooker and cook 5-6 hours; stir ever now and then. About 30 minutes to an hour before eating, add sausages - anykind, but knockwurst, farmer/polish, bockwurst or weisswurst are pretty traditional. Serve with boiled potatoes and rye bread.
