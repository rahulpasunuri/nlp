These were amazing. Like perfect pecan pie in a bar. I froze the leftovers and they were great too. I made them with gluten-free flour.

For the nut lover, this is a dream cookie. Very easy, as long as you are attentive to the clock.

I was verrrry disappointed with these cookies. The whole square melted and spread all over the pan. I'm cooling them now, but they certainly are not bars.

I am an experienced baker, not often fooled by a recipe, but this one got me. It sounded great and the reviews are so good, but I found these greasy and one dimensional--really a waste of time. There are so many excellent shortbread cookies out there. I am being generous giving this 2 forks. blah. Was baking to freeze them for a big holiday party, but I might just leave them in the office break room tomorrow. They don't really merit the freezer space.

Wow! Simple, but yummy. They were the first things gone from the dessert buffet table. I didn't read the reviews before making them, but knew that 375 was just too high. 350 at 18 minutes was just right. I used the mixed nuts as stated and also used salted butter...tasted great! I got lots of requests for the recipe.

I agree with cook from Mississippi and wished I had checked reviews before I made them. They are very tasty, but mine were brown at the edges at 18 minutes. I took them out & let them cool before I cut them and they weren't done in the center. So this needs some tweeking.

Delicious flavor; but I think, after making this, that there are two mistakes in the instructions. My shortbread was burned on the edges after 18 minutes--I think 375 is too high. I'll try a lower temperature next time (and I wonder if it was a typo and should be 325). Also, I don't think the pan should be greased. I think it made the edges of the shortbread spread.

Is a great recipe but would like to know the calories, sodium, fats, etc. of this recipe.

It was very easy and delicious! Looks very sophisticated, also :) Only one thing I would say is that all the toppings are easy to fall traveling between from a plate to you mouth. But, it's still good!!!

Yummy! So quick! Will make this often.

Thought these cookies were very good especially considering how easy they were to make. Added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 cup of nuts. While there are many nuts to choose from we liked the combination of pecans, cashews and macadamias best.

Salted cocktail nuts dramatically improve standard shortbread recipe. Be sure not to roll dough too thin or press nuts in too far-- otherwise it all falls apart when you try to slice it. Next time I will score the shortbread before baking to be sure to get nice squares.

I made this using coconut instead of mixed nuts - super easy recipe and very delicious!!!!! I drizzled some of the cookies with chocolate. Yummy.
