The most amazing thing I've eating in a while! I put orzo on the bottom and it was great. I also used white wine instead of champagne...YUM!

Made this as finger food to be passed at a holiday party: left the tails on the shrimp so they could be lifted from the tray and put the sauce in bowl in the center for dipping, omitted the green beans. It was a big hit, very festive and lovely with a glass (or two) of Champagne

A fairly easy recipe, and a good way to use up leftover champagne. Most of the work goes into preparation. I would make certain to use large shrimp (I was careful to get 13-15 count shrimp), as smaller shrimp might get overcooked too easily. I would also pay close attention to how your oven usually heats. I roated the shrimp at 400 instead of 450, since my oven tends to run hot. Next time I make this I'll probably be more conservative with the salt when I toss it with the shrimp, but other than that, the flavors were delicious. The sauce was wonderful!

While the sauce is a treat, recently I have omitted it completely and simply served the shrimp, orzo and beans - even without the sauce, the meal gets rave reviews everytime!

I also cut down the butter and it worked great. Maybe a variation on scampi, but it was plate licking good regardless. The green beans were great too.

Loved it - didn't reduce the sauce quite as much and added only a half stick of butter and it was great.This was the first dish my 2 y.o. has demanded more of - go figure!!

I substituted white wine for the champage and reduced the butter by half and the results were great. The key for me was roasting the shrimp. I've always sauteed shrimp or baked it in combination with other ingredients,and the simplicity and speed of roasting (6 mintues!) was a revelation to me. This is an easy recipe--deveining the shrimp is the main work.

perfectly good shrimp, and the sauce is fine without the butter, so why complain?

Those who thought this was "Just OK" are crazy!!! If you read the recipe, cook regularly, and know you're not keen on a lot of butter, you can adjust it to your own needs. I also added garlic and served atop asparagus and it was simply exquisite. Would DEFINITELY make again!

Just OK; not worth the buzz this recipe has generated. It is a fancier scampi recipe that requires extra steps and prep time.

Totally agree with the cook from Dallas. There is way too much butter going on with the entire entree. The roasted shrimp came out great, but the overall recipe including sauce took a lot of time and I don't think the result was worth it.

This recipe, while fairly tasty, was extremely heavy on butter. There was more prep work than I anticipated given the short list of ingredients and the many comments of its being a simple dish. It was definitely not complicated, but there was a lot of chopping involved. I did not make any of it in advance; that might have made it seem less time-consuming. I'm unlikely to make it again, but if I did, I would use much less olive oil in roasting the shrimp and cut way back on the butter in the sauce and green beans. The sauce was delicious, and the dish did make a pretty presentation. Perhaps my expectations were too high or I've grown accustomed to enjoying lighter fare.

This was amazing. We made the whole "A Party with Fizz" meal. Very simple to prepare and rave reviews! I am making it for my husband's company tomorrow night.

I made this using large sea scallops instead of the shrimp and used a grated grapefruit lemon peel mixture and replacing the thyme with about 2 t. of fresh tarragon. I also used asparagus in place of the green beans. Fabulous!

We had dinner at a friend's home and she prepared this entire meal for us. It was so delicious I am here looking for the recipes. Not only delicious, but a beautiful presentation. Dinner was outdoors under the stars and candle light. Thanks Tammy!

This was amazing. Instead of roasting the shrimp we did kabobs on the grill with some peppers, mushrooms and onions.

Simply delicious! My daughter prepared all dishes but the pizza from the "Party with Fizz" menu as a Mother's Day gift. Prepared as written all selections were a big hit. I will definitely be serving this again.
