This is a decent chutney as others have noted but the 7 1/2 cup yield is a huge waste of good ingredients. Divide by seven and you get the amount needed relative to the ham recipe this chutney is supposed to be used for. Not the first time recipes here demonstrate no respect for proportions.

This is a delicious recipe that everyone I've made it for loves it. Great balance of sweet and spicy. I've made it with canned & fresh pineapple, both have turned out well. Yes, the kitchen will smell like the chutney for a few days, but I happen to love the smell!

I thought this was disgusting. And as other reviewers mentioned it stinks up the house for days. Even my 9 month old daughter's hair smelled like curry the next day. I like curry dishes but think a plainer pineapple chutney would have tasted better with the ham.

Turned out great! I cut the recipe in half. Since the other reviewers commented on the looseness of the chutney, I only used 1/2 c. OJ and 1/2 c. cider vinegar. I also prepared it in a skillet which allowed the chutney to reduce faster..25-30 minutes. Texture and flavor came out great. Will definitely make again.

Truly excellent chutney. A little on the loose side, but great.

BEWARE - I made this for Easter and my house smelled like curry and onions for 2 days after I cooked it. My sister made it for another party at Christmas time - and when she saw it at Easter, totally unprompted said, "Oh, is that recipe from Epicurious? I made that once and my refrigerator and kitchen smelled for days." As for taste, it was OK - I was tired of it by the time I served it - and no one really talked it up one way or another - just that it was "good". I used fresh pineapple but I think canned would be fine here.

Incredible! Made this two days before Christmas and the house smelled just fantastic! This was an unexpected and wonderfully delicious addition to our holiday ham. Just enough zing to spice up a holiday meal. And don''t forget leftovers! The next day with leftover ham....what a treat! My husband hasn't stopped raving about this yet!

i have made this a number of times, each time using whatever tropical fruits are available in addition to the pineapple -- mango and papaya are naturals for this dish. i serve it on a platter thickly covered with cream cheese, to be dipped with crackers. like the cook in new jersey, i learned the hard way about using rubber gloves to do the peppers!

The chutney was alittle watery; however it was very tasty with ham. It was a great hit with the family at Thanksgiving. BUT you have to wear gloves when handling the jalapeño chilies, I learned the hard way making this recipe.

Wow! This chutney is great. Just the right amount of hot and sweet. I'll eat it with chicken and seafood. Yes, easy to make too.

I tried this for Easter dinner and, because I was on vacation, I used canned pineapple as per one reviewer. It was . . . okay. Everyone else really loved it, though, and it was remarkably easy. I will rate it again after trying fresh pineapple.

I made this to go with the Easter ham. It was a big hit for those who like curry. This recipe is a keeper. Extremely easy.

Made this for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it. I didn't have fresh pineapple so used canned chunks (in own juices) and it was fine.

This is an incredibly delicious chutney--the best I've ever had. It's excellent with ham and not all that hard to make either.

Fabulous! Worth the effort. I halved the recipe for 14 adults and there were leftovers.

Made it for Easter! Great flavor! We don't like curry,so I substituted 1 teaspoon of allspice. I,also,added papaya with the pineapple.
