A very good, everyday meal that you can make just for yourself. Just cut the ingredients in half and add low-sodium soy sauce to your liking when ready to eat.

This recipe sounds very interesting. My class is doing a foreign foods lab on Chinese food. I'll talk to my teacher and see if I can make this for the class.
