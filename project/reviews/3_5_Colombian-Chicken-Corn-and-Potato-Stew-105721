Although I haven't made this soup, I'm compelled to ask why on earth anyone would put corn on the cob in a soup? How the heck do you eat the corn? Just a really stupid idea in my mind...how about if we take the corn OFF the cob and THEN put it in the soup????

I used homemade chicken broth for this, and I found that the flavor was wonderfully subtle. I left out the Yukon Gold potatoes, mainly because the prep had already taken so long I was too lazy to prepare them. This tastes a lot like a soup served at the Chinese restaurant my family has been going to for years, but even with that compliment, the prep took me so long that I just don't think I would make this again. The fault is entirely mine, but two hours is just too time and energy consuming.

sancocho is similar and contains green plaintains and yuca. You may want to try that if this was close but not quite what you expected.

I agree with many of the reviewers that this stew has a lovely subtle flavor and I've made it several times to rave reviews. Our Colombian friend makes a rendition of this stew to which he adds pork, beef, yucca and a dozen eggs which cook in the broth and take on a wonderful chicken flavor. Each person then gets a piece of corn, potato, chicken, beef and pork in the broth along with an egg which is then peeled and eaten. Yum!

It's very sad that people confuse the subtle taste of this national dish for "bland". This is for a more refined palate and I applaud those people who enjoyed it. This is a simple dish with very sublet and simple flavors. There really is no need to add anything else than required. If you want to spice it up add capers, aji and avocado, and half & half (not yogurt, cheese, or any other strange concotion.) The corn on the cob adds to the tradition of the soup. Just add some corn cob holders to the ends of the piece of corn and eat it last. That way you can enjoy the taste of corn with the flavor of the soup. Or you can also just shell the cooked corn and dump the corn into the bowl. That doesn't mean use canned corn because the flavor will change the soup and not in a good way. Just enjoy it with some arepas and hot chocolate!! I love this dish and hope others will too.

I was disappointed in this, it was very bland. We had to dump salsa into it, we were really hoping for something more spicy. We made the accompaniments, which helped a little. The corn was difficult to eat, on the cob in soup. While the texture (thick, gloopy, and stick-to-your-ribs) was interesting, and maybe worth experimenting with, there are a lot of more flavorful things out there.

This soup is FANTASTIC! I have made this about 5 times since publishing. It is bland until you do this... 1. Pour in a good amount of caper juice. 2. Add some heat! I use an Asian chile sauce (tobasco has too distinctive of a flavor and competes with the flavors of the soup). The brand that I use is Bali Spice. www.peaceworks.com If you can find it... you will love it. 3. Definitely use Mexican Crema (not sour cream). It's less tangy than regular sour cream.

I've made this a few times now, and can't wait for the next opportunity. Quite time-consuming for a slow prepper like me, but worth it. When serving company, use frozen corn kernels instead of cobs for neatness--just stir them in with the shredded chicken. Don't forget the additions--the capers & cream & cilantro make it exciting. A really great stew, and fabulous the next day.

I think ajiaco is a dish that could become popular outside of Colombia if done correctly. I was happy to find this recipe given how difficult it is to find good Colombian recipes anywhere. As another reviewer mentioned, this recipe greatly differs from the original primarily in the browning of the chicken and the shredding of the potatoes. I think these changes can be blamed for the gumminess other reviewers have described. To remedy this, toss the chicken parts in the broth as it cooks and cut the potatoes into chunks. Also, use guascas and papas criollas if you can find them and blend the heavy cream with a bit of sour cream to make it thicker. To those Colombian cooks out there, please submit your recipes! To future reviewers, please keep in mind that Colombia is never spelled with a "u".

Disappointing. While in Venezuela, my uncle's cook (from Columbia) made this savory soup almost daily as the first course of a large lunch. I made this dish just as listed, without attempting any substitutions of cassava or other more authentic vegetables to see how this basic recipe fared. I found it bland, colorless, and nothing like the "real thing." I didn't even keep the leftovers, in spite of time invested in it.

Yummy! Used fresh oregano and cubed leftover turkey. Forgot about the cubed potatoes, so only used shredded. Used all broth. Took corn off ears for neatness factor. Added a good bit of hot sauce to it. Didn't serve with cream or capers, but did enjoy it with a dollop of yogurt and sprinkling of cilantro and avocado bites.

Although it lacks the superb flavor of guascas and papas criollas, this is a good rendition for those who are unable to find these traditional ingredients. In Bogota, the maize (corn) is typically skewered with wooden skewers to make eating easier. The skewers are propped up on the side of the bowl, allowing diners to eat the maize from the cob by holding the wooden sticks. As for those curious about guascas, it's a common weed found also in the U.S. known as Gallant Soldier or Tridax parviflora.

An excellent dish that was a hit in my house all around. Very tasty. I took the corn off the cob for easy eating and added a minced jalapeno to the broth as my group loves spice. Now that my husband has tasted the lime juice in the broth I have to put it in all the soups! (almost) I make this often even in summer.

Very good, the avocado on top makes it even better! But I would ommit the pepper altogether (my family didn't like it so spicy). Next time I make it, I think I'm skipping the browning the chicken part... It takes time, and adds calories.

Just exquisite. Wondering if all Colombian food is as delicious. I once met some very cosmopolitan Colombians who cooked this for me and this is just as delicious!!!!!!!

I've made this several times and it has been dependable, replicatable and luxuriously delicious. This provides a warm, hearty meal for a cold winter day. Using the little yellow potatoes seems better than the Idahos, though both are good. Lots of cilantro and extra pepper make it very tasty.

Rating: 3
Although my stew came out thicker looking from the pic,it still tasted good.I used regular Idahos for the baking potatoes.I didn't have any of the accompaniments on hand so I left them out. The pepper in this really came through.Overall I would say this is a homey comforting kind of dish,perfect for a chilly day.

Love this and have made it many times since first published, including for Colmbian friends and long-time residents. They agree Guasca and papa criolla would make it authentic, but also agreed with us that it's great as is. One question--any suggestions to keep cooked ajiaco from acquiring a grayish color?

Rating: 2
I read alot of the reviews and some I agree with and some not. It's very true that Guacas are needed. The can now be found very easily in any Latin Food Store. They are dried and give great flavor to this recipe. Also something that we as Colombians add to this soup is Papa Criolla. They can also be found in the Latin Supermarkets and they are almost always packed frozen. These potatoes literally melt in the soup and are what gives this soup a rich and thick consistency. If shredding the chicken is too much just cut the chicken into small pieces. I would also add a little bit more of Cilantro.

is pretty close to the original recipe. Considering we cannot find the real ingredients in united states. The original recipe shold have "Guascas" insted of oregano and "papa Criolla" Those are hte small yellow potatoes that i have never seen in united States. So anyway is pretty close and is really good.

I've made this dish several times. It's a lot of work to pull the chicken off the bones, but worth it. I am amazed that some reviewers didn't like it. Also, my kids went crazy over it.

This stew had a unappetizing texture, and it was very bland. I added some cilantro (one of the recommended garnishes), and it still lacked flavor. I couldn't finish my serving of it.

Rating: 1
I agree with one of the former reviewers that this dish is a slimy, gummy concoction, due to the gelatine of the chicken bones and the grated potatoes. If I would make it again - of which I have no intention - I would use boneless chicken breasts and less grated potatoes. I would also add some red chilies to give it some colour, and some cumin and ground coriander to give it some extra taste.

Although some reviewers below have written critically of Epicurious's "lack of research", etc., in defense of them -- and all cooks who attempt to share other cuisines with Americans, thus enlivening their meals -- recall that many people reading these recipes have little experience of overseas cultures and food. "Italian", for example, can mean merely spaghetti and meatballs, rather than evoking something like panzanella. If a recipe is different from the way your family cooked it, that doesn't make it illegitimate. Every family/region is different...even in the U.S. Try asking people here about barbeque: got a couple hours?

Ajiaco originated in Colombia. It is a dish native to this country (Colombia). Just because a country makes a variation of a dish they borrowed, does not mean that it came from that country.

Rating: 0
Another cultural note: Ajiaco is a 'dish' that is made throughout Latin America. It is a soup/stew made with ingredients native to the area it is prepared. For example, we made Ajiaco in Cuba with Malanga, Yuca and Boniato (instead of potatoes) and seasoned with Cumin and typically contains beef, pork, and chicken. It is sad that Epicurious doesn't do more research and attaches names (i.e. Columbian to this stew) to recipes without regard to its authenticity.

To Doris from Colombia; it's great to hear from cooks who can give us the true roots of a recipe! I'd love to try this your way, but is there any U.S. (midwest) substitution for the guasca? Or is it available under a different name? Please advise. Thanks!

My family loved this - even the kids! I use leftover chicken so I skip the boiling chicken part, and I throw in frozen corn five minutes before serving. I have made it with the Yukons, but also just used all russets, which was actually better, not to mention cheaper. Adding some cilantro during the cooking time rather than after gave the stew a nice flavor, too.

This is a travesty of our delicious, real AJIACO, which is a corn, chicken and potato chowder. We NEVER use butter -- we drop a whole free-range chicken into a large pot and boil with some onion (long onions) and GUASCA, a native herb that I have found in Central Park (NY), in the late fall dried flower beds of Amherst (Mass), in the highlands of Kenya, in Tibet..... When the chicken is tender, we remove it and shred the meat to make eating and serving easier..... then we add the chopped potatos and the corn in pieces to the broth, and boil until soft. The absolute MUST for taste is the guasca -- without it, this would just be a potato-and-corn chowder...

This was a bland, greasy, gummy concoction that rivalled my worst university cooking experiments. At the very least it needed some garlic and chiles. Also, my guests found it hard to navigate the stumps of corncob floating in the quagmire. I would use niblets next time to ensure that the corn's actually edible in stew format.

This is a crowd-pleaser. Great for dinner parties because everyone can alter thier dish with the toppings. If you think you need to feed 6-8 people there is no need to double the recipie. If you do, quite a large pot is needed. Very good one dish meal.

This is a grea version of the all-American 'everything but the kitchen sink' stew. Its Colombia's national dish, but I think the recipe here has been 'modernized' a little. In rural Colombia, you will find the addition of whole red chillies to the broth - they like eating them whole, apparently. Also, green beans and green peas are occassionally added. This dish reminded me of a broth they serve in Southern India, made of cubed potatoes, turnip, chicken, peas and stewed in spicy coconut milk. Divine.

Very good. To cut down time, I bought an already cooked rotesserie chicken from the butcher, cut some of the corn off the cob to add more texture to the soup. I also went ahead and added the accompaniments right to the soup as we love cilantro.

My husband and I enjoyed this soup in Bogota.We both enjoyed making your version.It brought back great memories of our visit to Colombia.We changed nothing.We invited some friends over and they all asked for the recipe.
