I feel badly about this, but my review is also for Boston's recipe. Which I will save forever!! I've had avgolemono in several restaurants, and this recipe is a dead ringer for my fave restaurant's rendition. I put the chicken on the side to satisfy the varying degrees of vegetarian to carnivore around my table and everyone LoVeD it. Thanks Boston!

I tried Boston's recipe after craving avgolemono for days. I must have overwhipped the egg whites (was whipping by hand and clearly overcompensated) because what I got tasted like foam, egg, and lemon, in that order :-( I'm giving it another shot tonight. Thanks, Boston, for posting your recipe!!

I have never had this type of soup before, and found this recipe when trying to find a use for 8 egg yolks. So, I don't know what authentic avgolemono is supposed to taste like, but I liked this! Not as rich-tasting as I was expecting, but very nice. I actually used pre-cooked brown rice, which I added after the stock boiled. I also like how this recipe is a little healthier than some versions, since this uses no milk or cornstarch. My two daughters liked it, too.

Review is for the Boston recipe, found several times below. It is exactly right, with these additional comments: 1) adding oregano and dill to the stock adds lovely flavor; you can skim it out before using it for the soup if desired. 2) If you are using Jumbo or even Extra-Large eggs you can get away with three instead of four; 3) I prefer rice to orzo, mainly because I like this soup thicker, more like porridge, and the rice continues to absorb liquid as it sits. In fact, i try to make this soup the night before the day I want to eat it, so it has time to thicken up and merge flavors. 4) I always add three or four pats of butter to the stock when the rice is cooking...it seems to bind to the egg/lemon mixture and help prevent curdling, a la sauce Hollandaise (plus it tastes good) 5) In porridge form (that is, the next day if you use rice), it makes a STUNNING breakfast, especially if you have added the shredded chicken. BTW, many here may not know that avgolemono is a Sephardic Jewish dish from way back, under the name agristada. So, in a sense, this IS Jewish Chicken Soup!

Last night I made reviewer Boston's Yia Yia's recipe, and my husband said it was one of the best things I've ever made (I cook a lot!) and one of the top two soups he's ever eaten in his life. I admit I used store brand organic culinary chicken stock instead of homemade stock, and it was still amazing. Don't add anything, don't change anything, make this recipe!!: Soupa Avgolemono: 8 c. homemade chix stock, 1 c. orzo, 4 eggs/ separated, juice of 3 lemons, fresh ground black pepper. This recipe will make a perfectly balanced salty, rich, filling, comforting soup. Boil broth, add orzo and simmer until tender 20 min. Whip whites until medium peaks, add yolks beating continuously, add juice, beating. Temper eggs with 2 c. broth, adding in constant slow stream while continuing to beat furiously so you do not curdle the eggs. Add egg mixture back to remaining broth and serve. When reheating, do not re-boil - heat slowly until very warm or you may curdle the eggs. Garnish with thinly sliced lemon. I sometimes add more than juice of 3 lemons, as the sourness is the best part of the taste! You should taste lemon, richness of eggs, salt of chicken, and starch of rice, in that order and you've made it perfectly.

I worked at the best Greek restaurant in LA for a while and their avgolemono was DIVINE. Addicting. Anyways, I have to give you kudos, Yia Yia's recipe is the closest I have found to that soup at my restaurant (keep in mind, the owner is from Greece and all his recipes are his and his mothers. Next time i'll add carrots and chicken and i know it will be PERFECT. Thanks Yia Yia!!!

For all of our benefit... and let me add my voice to the 'thanks', Boston, it was great. Except I thought I'd put in more orzo to make the soup more filling and it almost took over the broth. That's my fault, though. 1/4 for this recipe, 4/4 for this: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Terrible adaption of a Greek classic.

I used six egg yolks, long grain brown rice (rice required 45 min to become tender), and a mix of chicken and garlic stock. This recipe remained light but was very filling. Best Avgolemono I've had! ~ It was also good chilled! Alternatives include lime juice or Orzo.

Hi everyone - Here's the mysterious cook from Boston again! Glad to see everyone is enjoying the recipe. If you are greek, you know that this ends up exactly the way it should be. If you've never had this before, know that this soup is supposed to be tangy - it's all about the clean flavors of the broth (homemade is a must), bite of lemon, spice of pepper and richness of the orzo. It is a light soup, not meant to be full of veggies, tofu or other items but I can understand why folks would want to add them :) FYI that it is great chilled on a summer day as well!

Rating: 0
I made Boston's recipe. Some people loved it and others thought it was too tangy. I have had this soup before and thought it lacked a slight butter taste, for richness. However, the soup was creamy and light, very smooth. I would recommend using less lemon and using a touch of butter in the broth. Definitely a do-over.

I made "Boston's" soup too and it tasted just like the one a Greek landlady I used to rent from made. And she was the best cook I ever met, so that's a big compliment.

Yet another vote for the 'Boston' recipe - it is almost identical to the version I've had for Christmas dinner every year since I can remember - my mom makes my grandmother's recipe, who makes her mother's recipe, etc... Our only difference is to use rice instead of Orzo. There have been some complaints that it is 'foamy' - to the best of my knowledge that is how it is SUPPOSED to be! Am looking forward to soup later this week!

I was looking for an approximation of Patricia Wells' Quick Chicken-Lemon Soup. This isn't it. For those who are looking, the Boston cook's highly praised recipe is dated 11/02/02, and it's on page 5 of these comments (if this is page 1, go back 4 pages). It sounds more like what I was looking for.

This recipe is a TOTAL disaster. Add a little teragon and you've got bernaise sauce. 8 yolks with four cups of broth? After throwing this version down the drain, I've been looking at others, and its clear the measurements on this one are WAY off. Many others have 3-4 times the brother amount with 2-4 egg yolks. stay clear!

Rating: 3
This is, hands-down, my favorite soup! I usually add grated carrots, leeks, celery, and onion to the stock,along with shredded chicken, parsley, and a bit of nutmeg at the end. Excellent! I give three forks for this recipe because I find it just a little light on flavor without the add-ins.

Rating: 3
3 forks for the Boston version, plus Quincy IL's blender suggestion-- an excellent time saver, and very little foam! I used rice, because that's classic -- I've worked a few in Greek restaurants. It needed a little something beyond peppr, so I swirled in some butter and added finely chopped italian parsley.

Rating: 2
I made Boston's version as well...the flavor was excellent but I can see how one might end up with "foam" soup if they beat the eggwhites beyond the ideal point. I was able to skim the foam off the top without sacrificing the entire pot of soup, but next time will make it a point to beat the eggyolks to a lesser point. I also added a little silken tofu in small cubes to add some extra substance and make the soup a meal in and of itself, and it worked nicely as the tofu is mild enough in flavor and compatible in texture that it did not take away from the creamy lemony experience that this soup is supposed to be.

This review is for Boston's recipe -- what a disaster. . .after spending all day on the homemade stock I got to making the avgolemono. . . she said to whip the egg whites until peaks form. And she said "beat" - so I used an electric beater - BIG mistake. The end result was FOAM soup. What a waste of time today. . . and I was so looking forward to trying this recipe. Next time I will try the epicurious recipe. . . it sounds like it makes much more sense.

The BOSTON recipe is very close to one I've been using for years, EXCEPT instead of beating the whites, then the yolks, etc., just buzz the eggs in the blender a couple of pulses, add lemon juice, buzz again. Temper the eggs with some of the broth, and add back while stirring. Same effect, and much easier!

Whereas this recipe makes a tasty soup, I agree with one of the other reviewers that the recipe Boston submitted within his or her review is preferable. I'd give Boston's three forks. Separating the egg whites and yolks, beating the whites and incorporating the yolks, tempering them with the broth and adding them back to the mixture make a very creamy soup. Also Boston's version uses the whole egg so one doesn't have whites leftover to deal with. Both versions are lowfat and dependent on the quality of the broth. I used orzo but think dieters could use brown rice to be legal on the South Beach diet.

I've made both this recipe and the one from Boston and I have to say that Boston's recipe is fantastic while this one is terrible.

My husband was sick and was craving chicken soup. Thought I would try this recipe, but after reading reviews, decided to make Boston's instead. RAVE REVIEWS AND FOUR FOURKS FOR BOSTON'S RECIPE. Do yourself a favor, scroll down and find Boston's "Yia Yia" recipe. You will be very glad you did. It was even better the next day when the flavors melded. I did add shredded chicken (I poached a whole chicken in the homemade stock and then set aside to cool while making the soup). It made a meal with the chicken added to it.

These comments are for BOSTON'S recipe. I made half of the recipe and it was wonderful. I added the lemon juice cautiously because of all the warnings, but ended up using 1 1/2 lemons(about 3TB. juice.) It was creamy,eggy,lemony,and just right.

I loved this soup...it's almost a 4, but it's so simple and everyday that it feels like it cannot attain the status of "a dish beyond compare." I of course made a couple of changes. First, I used organic, free-range chicken broth from Whole Foods, and I boiled a chicken breast (w/bones and skin) for about 45 minutes in the broth. I used egg beaters instead of real egg yolks-- it's too healthy a soup to add all that gratuitous cholesterol and fat. I wound up making a mistake- My eggs weren't tempered enough when I added them to the soup, so they clumped a little, but it didn't matter! I am going to try again today for lunch. I served this with tomatoes stuffed with ground buffalo. Perfect dinner!

I made Boston's version as well and loved it so much that I have made it many times. I'm so glad I found that review!

Another vote of confidence for Boston's version. I used a carton of Whole Foods chicken broth (32 oz), 2 eggs, a handful of rice and the juice of one lemon. Creamy, salty & nourishing, and much better than what is offered at our local Greek restaurants. This would be a great dinner when there's seemingly nothing to eat in the house.

I made the version provided by Boston, since it was recommended so highly by so many...it is great, but just a bit frothy! Next time I make it, I won't beat the egg whites so much! Also, here in California, we grow excellent football-sized lemons, of which I used 3...next time I will use ONE! I think Boston lemons must be small..as my soup was lemony like crazy!

I didn't bother with Kafka's recipe and used the one posted by the cook from Boston instead - that's what the three forks are for. I used basmati brown rice instead of orzo for the fiber and added shredded chicken and it came out great. Even reheated well for lunch the next day!

This was my first time eating avgolemono. I used Boston's recipe, but given that I was making an I-have-a-cold soup, I constrained myself to what was in my kitchen. I substituted low-sodium canned chicken broth and arborio rice, and had only half the lemons. The soup was good, very thick and creamy. Next time (and I fully understand that this may make the soup less authentic), I plan to halve the rice/orzo and use 1.5-2 lemons.

I won't rate this recipe because I didn't, and wouldn't, try it. I make avgolemono soup often as a comfort food. In fact, I'm making it today for my husband who has a cold. The problem with this recipe is the number of egg yolks. I use two whole eggs whisked and tempered carefully into the soup. Since lemons are different sizes I start with the juice of half of a lemon and keep adding more until it tastes "right." Also add salt and pepper to taste and parsley. I got my recipe from a Middle Eastern cookbook given to me by a Lebanese friend.

I really used to love Avgolemeno, but this is just not good at all. It's too eggy, and that doesn't match up with the excellent sourness. I added more broth, some dill and some oregano, and still too eggy. Perhaps I should've just cut back on the eggs. But interestingly, after I left the soup in the fridge for leftovers, it tasted much better the next day. I was very pleased, but I'm not so sure if that's an accident.

This is to the cook who used my recipe but with the "garlic broth". I use Swanson Low Sodium Chicken Broth that comes in a can. On occasion, I also use College Inn Chicken Broth.

The recipe sounds delicious, but I was disappointed. I made it with homemade chicken stock and used riso pasta instead of rice. The consistency was wonderful -- thick and creamy, but I was underwhelmed by the flavors. The sourness didn't cut the richness, the richness didn't balance the sourness, salt didn't enhance any flavor, and fresh cracked black pepper got lost. I thought about making it again with a little garlic, but probably won't go to the trouble.

I guess by the look of the soup I was expecting a creamy or cheesy soup, instead of the intense sour richness that it did afford. Although I love lemon, the 1/4 c. of lemon made it way too sour. Perhaps I can't temper eggs and lemon yet (although my soup did not curdle or separate). I will not be making this again.

One of the great things about this recipe is that you can make it as simple or as complicated as you want. Surely you can make homemade stock, but it is entirely satisfying if you use a good canned broth. Also, it can be made without meat at all by substituting a vegetable broth for the chicken broth. I recommend Imagine Foods No-Chicken Broth.

Blech. This was just awful. My boyfriend and I couldn't even eat it, it was so overwhelmingly eggy tasting. We ended up throwing away the entire pot. I even tried adding dill, and taking some of the recommendations of the other reviewers, but it was still so eggy tasting as to be inedible.

Greek Lemon soup is one I have used for years, acquired from a Greek friend. I modified it with my Jewish mother-in-laws recipe. I like the idea of garlic broth but would lace it with chicken broth and increase to 5 cups. Simmer your favorite chicken parts in the broth with onion & celery chunks till chicken is falling off bone, remove & debone. Add one cup rice and deboned chicken, simmer, covered one-half hour. Do the egg/lemon juice thingy and 5 minutes before serving add a 16 oz pkg of favorite frozen mixed veggie chunks, or peas, or cut beans. This is an Eatin' Soup and cures anything that ails you, bad cold, the blues, tiff with Significant Other (feed it to him!). NOTE: Dont forget a dash of dill and salt/pepper to taste.

This recipe is a permanent favorite in my kitchen -- fairly quick, few ingredients, very easy, and excellent flavor!

This soup was perfectly wonderful with a beautiful delicate blend of flavors. Everyone totally loved it -- of course no one knew how many eggs went into it. For such a delicate soup I highly recommend making a stock from scratch. Well worth it. I took a good quality range chicken for the stock (8 cups) and added carrots and celery -- no onions, plus the rice. Then pick out the chicken and vegetable hunks when you're done. I would recommend only half the rice, as mine got too thick and I had to thin the stock. A great soup for special occasions.

A great "fix" when we can't get to a restaurant for it! I used low salt broth & egg beaters for a healthier version. It worked. Maybe next time I'll do 1/2 eggs and & egg beaters. I added some fresh garlic but not too much to overpower the lemon. YUM!

I agree with the idea of using carrots, celery, and onions in the broth. I also put some of the chicken meat in the soup as well, along with the rice. I prefer rice to orzo when using Uncle Ben's brand only because it stays firm. A little extra lemon can't hurt either.
