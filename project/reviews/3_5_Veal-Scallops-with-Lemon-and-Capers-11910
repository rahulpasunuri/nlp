When I made this recipe, I followed the advice of others and made more sauce. It was extremely easy and excellent! Perfect for a weeknight meal!

Just made a test batch for a special evening dinner & glad that I did. The sauce was WAY too overpowering and not sure if it was from the lemons (I think so) or the wine. I followed the directions exactly, but did squeeze the lemons in Part II of the recipe and maybe that was just too much. At any rate, the sauce was way too strong. Other recipes similar to this call for using chicken stock instead of the wine base, and I think I will try that variable before I make this recipe again. Ended up ruining perfectly good veal. On the plus side, I served it over bowtie pasta and decorated the plate with lemon rinds and it was very pretty!

This was absolutely delicious. I use twice the amount of wine and really let the meat sit in the sauce at the end to thicken the sauce up a bit. It is a family favorite, even with my 5 and 8 year old. I serve with pasta and freshly grated pecorino.

I made this when we were on holiday in Tuscany. It was fabulous and my sister (who is very cautious with new food) loved it. We used cornmeal - the corner store had no 'farina' but they did have polenta. I plan to keep using the cornmeal.

Great dish--easy and fast to make. The only tweaking I do is to mix a tablespoon of softened butter with a tablespoon of flour and whisk it in at the end to thicken up the sauce. On occasion, I will toss in some artichoke hearts (yummy!) I also add more lemon and capers to the recipe--but that's just a matter of personal taste. Also good with thin chicken cutlets.

Awesome and easy. A gourmet meal in 20 minutes. I added extra lemon pieces for taste and decoration. Yummy.

Very good dish. I used veal scallops that were a little bit thicker than the recipe called for - and then cooked them for one minute on each side. I would try this again with a cream sauce or seasoning in flour.

If the veal comes out "tough" with this recipe, it most surely is not the result of a recipe calling for thin veal that is cooked for a minute and a half. This dish gets raves every time we make it - the veal never requires more than a fork to cut once cooked.

Served this over a bed of fettucini as suggested by another reviewer. It looked beautiful but I thought it was a little bland. My husband loved it though. Great with artichoke as a veggie. If you are in to visuals, this looks fantastic together.

Excellent and so easy! First time, I served homemade bruschetta as an appetizer and spinach & chive pasta to accompany the veal. Second time, I substituted chicken for the veal and served with fresh lemon-pepper fettucine (from freshpasta.com). My family loves this dish!

I made this dish and laid the veal scallops atop a bed of angel hair pasta with herb and butter sauce. It was so easy to do and went great with a nice chardonney. Plus, it made for an attractive presentation. I will definitely be doing it again soon!

I add lemon pepper to the flour mixture. It adds that little extra tang.

Excellent, simple classic. The veal was exquisite and was anxious to try with chicken. Easy to prepare, if you organize yourself a little bit. When I tried this with pounded chicken (get the butcher to do it at the market), it was equally outstanding. Considering the price differential (4 to 1), chicken is the way to go for larger quantities, saving the veal for special occasions. Try this one, you won't be disappointed.

Easy & delicious - we have subsituted pounded pork tenderloin, sole fillet and pounded chicked with GREAT sucess. Makes the dish less expensive which means it can be enjoyed more often!

I loved this dish. I made it again with pounded chicken 2 nigths later. So good. I put a very little bit flour in the sauce to thicken it. Love the lemony flavor. My husband enjoyed it alot. It cooks quickly so it helps to have the side dishes ready to go before you put the veal in the pan.

One of the better dishes I've tried. I like more sauce, so I added ~1/4 cup fat-free, low-sodium chicken broth. I also made a roux from 1T flour and the juice of 1/2 lemon to thicken the sauce a bit. My boyfriend said it was one of the best veal dishes he's ever had! Defintely will make again.

Very tastey - I added creme fraiche to make a creamy sauce.
