Only use 4 eggs. Skip the frosting. I had to bake mine for 40 mins but I have a crappy oven. I've made these 2x and my family loved them both times. I find it very helpful to always read reviews before trying a recipe for the first time.

Worst brownies ever!!! I doubled the chocolate and it still just taste like cake that's too sweet :(

I have no idea why this didn't work for people. I had a major chocolate craving and only had unsweetened baker's chocolate in the pantry, so this was a good fit. I took the advice of a reviewer that had success and made these with 4 eggs instead of 5, and cooked for 25 minutes, checked it and it wasn't completely done but only needed 2-3 more minutes and was PERFECT. My coworkers were absolute vultures for this recipe and it was gone in record time, even for them. These are sweet but not too sugary. A very good recipe!!

I was not happy with this recipe. A little to cakey for my taste. The frosting was good though!

OMG! These brownies totally satisfied my chocolate craving! I don't know what the negatives are about - almost didn't make them. I did use I less egg and baked @ 25 minutes. Totally fudgy & awesome!

I made it without the frosting and think it is great. I made it with semi-sweet chocolate chips and it turned out fine.

I had 6oz of unsweetened chocolate, so I thought I'd give this recipe a try. The brownies are on the cakey-side...not fudgey at all. They are a tiny bit bitter, so the frosting or some kind of topping is needed. I still prefer the "triple-chocolate" brownies on this web site the best.

used semi-sweet chocolate instead of unsweetened, so i decreased suger by 1/4 cup in mix. left frosting alone. turned out great, of course i like really sweet things.

I've used this brownie recipe for years but cut down on the sugar by half cup. Did anyone else have trouble with the frosting? Mine came out like a ganache...I made two attempts because the first time it coagulated and separated because I took if off the heat. Make sure you keep the chocolate on low heat when mixing in the powdered sugar. This is one for the dentist chair...good luck!

I was looking for the perfect brownies recipe ´cause last time I made them with my old recipe I got really depressed and I decided to make these,I think that they are perfect too sugary but well I loved the sugary crust so it worth all the sugar.I didn´t use walnuts but they wre great anyway.I agree with those that say they are better next day And ´til I found a better ones these are the best I have tried.

okay, very fudgy certainly, but a bit of an unpleasant almost salty aftertaste and not a pleasing finish- hard crust with crystallized sugar... which baked over the sides of the pan anyway...

I've made a lot of brownies, and this is by far my favorite. Must be the 5 eggs!

I have been making these brownies for a few years. ALWAYS get raves and requests for more. The only people who didn't like these brownies also don't like chocolate... go figure. I will make them again and again....

These were OK, but when I read "fudgy" I expect dense and moist and these were definitely more cake-like. Tasted better the next day. Perhaps a few less minutes in the oven would have helped, but at 30 minutes, the knife did not come out at all clean, so I think I baked them for about 35. I'm moving on in my search for the perfect brownie, though.

These are wonderful...sort of a cross between cake and fudge. In my oven they needed a few more minutes. I baked them for 35 minutes and they were a little dry around the edges. 33 or 34 minutes would be just right. I'll definitely make these again; they are easy and delicious. The frosting is excellent too.

The worst brownies that I have ever had. They tasted more like dry Texas Sheet Cake than brownies. Definately a disappointment.

I think I am a good baker, but I thought these brownies were dry, boring,and definitely not worth making again. I have made much better brownies than these!

In a word - outstanding. They have become my trade mark dessert. I am reducing the sugar however because they are so sweet my husband can't eat as many as he wants...

Best ever! Don't make them if you're on a diet- you can't help going back for more!!! Definitely good idea to double the walnuts.

Delicious! So rich and moist! This recipe is very easy to make and the results are incredible. I doubled the nuts as suggested by an earlier reviewer and was so happy I did.

I've been making these brownies for co-workers for the past 8 years and have always received rave reviews. They may have even advanced my career. Be sure to double the amount of walnuts (2 cups)

These brownies are delicious. They are moist, cake like and not too sweet. Each time I make they them, they turn out great!
