Both the Waffles and pineapple topping delicious!

These waffles are delicious! Made as directed. This recipe serves more than six people (or should) but they'll freeze well for another day. Be sure to make the brown sugar syrup recipe that accompanies this one. It's worth the extra step and it makes good use of the pineapple peel.

This was easy and delicious! Preparing the night before gives you more time to prepare the rest of breakfast in the morning. These are by far the lightest, crispiest, and most flavorful waffles I've made yet. My son said it would be hard to eat any other waffles now.

These are a good alternative to your average waffle. The flavor is so different you can't really compare it to any other. I thought they were good, but not wonderful.

Very nice! It was great to have everything prepared the night before and ready to cook the next morning. It makes A LOT. But leftovers are nice, too.
