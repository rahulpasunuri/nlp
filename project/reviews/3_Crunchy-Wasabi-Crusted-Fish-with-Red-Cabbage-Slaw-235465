I read all the reviews first so tweaked the recipe a little. I doubled the wasabi and only spread it on the top of the fish then added the panko - worked perfectly. I baked for 12 minutes and 10 would have been perfect. For the slaw, per suggestion, I used whie balsamic instead of the white vinegar. I whisked in some low fat mayo so that the result was more creamy. I only added half the cuc. My husband loved it.

Was very excited to try this recipe, however was quite disappointed with the slaw's taste; pungent without flavor. I also followed a recommendation to use more Wasabi and would strongly warn against this, as it masked the flavor of this fish.

I have to admit that I didn't do the best job with this recipe but I still thought it was a little disappointing. The panko just didn't work for me and the wasabi (I used sour cream like the comments suggested) was a little bland. I could see making this good but it would take some work.

I made the slaw with a steak and it was delicious! I added some cherry tomatoes and used white balsamic vinegar. I also mixed red and green cabbage together. Great to bring for a pot luck or to accompany a barbeque.

Delicious and EASY! Forgot to read the reviews before cooking and hubby said, this is great, but next time, let's use more wasabi! Wonderful, wonderful recipe, I will definitely make again. I served mine with stir-fried cabbage from another Epi recipe and some steamed green beans.

I love this recipe. It's quick and easy. I ended up buying a jar of powdered wasabi and mixing it with an equal part of water to make the paste. and omitted the mayonnaise to give it a bigger kick. Like the other reviewers, I would triple the amount of wasabi used as the flavor easily gets lost in this dish.

Delicious! I only made the fish, and used mahi mahi. The recipe was right on except that I ended up using 3 times the amount of wasabi called for. The boyfriend loved it even though his face was burning as he took the last bite. I thought it was the perfect amount of spice. Served it with broiled asparagus and mashed potatoes, which were not very complementary. Perhaps I should have gone with the slaw... Will definitely make it again. The only warning I'd give is that it is very obviously green-ish under the panko. Might set off a finicky eater.

I tried this with Tilapia and red snapper. The fish was a hit. I used a teaspoon more wasabi in the mayo to give it more kick. I highly recommend garnishing with the pickled ginger- it really enhanced the flavor of the fish. Next time, I plan on mincing the ginger and topping the fish with it right before serving. Unlike other reviewers, I enjoyed the slaw. True, it wasn't packed to the brim with flavor, but that's not what this savory fish needs next to it anyway. A fish with such interesting flavor works well when accompanied with a light slaw.

I picked up some Chilean Sea Bass and some panko bread crumbs...came home and searched for a recipe...found this, and am I glad I did! I had wasabi powder, mixed it with the sour cream (based on other reviews) I seared the bass skin side down for a few minutes and finished it in the oven...it was delicious! We were very pleased with how it make out. We like spicy, so I added more wasabi powder. Can't wait to try it on salmon. YUM.

Didn't make the slaw, I served it with mashed potatoes and blanched green beans. The fish took longer to cook, but that could've been my oven. It was delicious and the wasabi was an interesting flavor that married well with the fish. I seasoned with salt and pepper before adding the wasabi sour cream mixture. I probably would not put panko on the underside of the fish next time; it got soggy and stuck to the foil.

I made this before reading the reviews, and agree with many comments. I didn't make the slaw, I used sour cream instead of mayo (actually, it was even light sour cream) and will definitely double the wasabi next time. It did add a nice flavor, but had no heat. I used tilapia loins which took an extra 5 minutes, but were delicious.

I used halibut, as called for, but increased the wasabi to 1T, and didn't make the slaw, following the advice of other reviewers. I will make the wasabi crust again and plan on incorporating this technique into other recipes.

This worked well. I used sour cream in place of the mayo, added more wasabi, and used fresh wheat bread crumbs from a slice of bread. Didn't do the slaw-hate red cabbage.

Tilapia worked very well on a college student budget ;o) I would double the wasabi... The slaw was boring, but was remarkably better 24 hours later, a close approximation to the Japanese "sunomono."

Needs a little more wasabi. Otherwise, it's a good weeknight dinner recipe.

I used cod as another reviewer suggested. The fish was good. I would also use more wasabi. The coleslaw was a waste. Boring.Needed something else to make it interesting.

The fish was fabulous, very moist. The slaw was beautiful...just a little strange as an accompaniment. I used halibut and since I didn't know where to find Panko, I just used regular italian bread crumbs...was still very tasty! I will make this again and again. It was a hit!!

I would pass on the slaw in favor of another recipe, but the fish was great. I used cod, and it turned out better than most fried fish I've had - and it's quick which is nice during the week. Don't be afraid of using extra wasabi - this amount is fairly conservative from my experience.

I used halibut for this as suggested. The fish was incredibly moist being cooked under the mayonnaise. I will make it again but next time add more wasabi. We really like some zing. I served it with the slaw and pickled ginger. Delicious! I would love to see more recipes using Japanese ingredients in new ways.

This dish was so yummy, even I couldn't believe how good this came out. I didn't make the slaw since I didn't have any of the ingredients but I'm sure it would have gone together perfectly. I used chilean sea bass and wasabi powder (reconstituted with water) and it was great. the mild buttery flavor of the sea bass was such a nice compliment to the wasabi. And the crunch was outstanding. My husband went on and on about how delicious it was with every bite but the most important review came from my 15 month old who managed to eat a huge chunk of both of our pieces. next time, she gets her own! will make this again and again.

This was tasty and very quick/easy. I used the wasabi mayo from Trader Joes and skiped the slaw. It needed to cook longer than stated, but was good and the Panko on top had a nice crunch. Bottom side was a little soggy, but overall the fish was good. Next time I'll try seasoning the panko for a little more flavor.

I really liked this dish. Except for using a different fish (tigerlip) and using wasabi powder reconstituted with water, I made it as is. You definitely what to use a fish that is fairly thick, cod, grouper, tiger lip, seabass (alhough I am not a big fan of the texture of seabass), etc. Tilapia and catfish fillets are just too thin for this type of dish.

It was good, but I would add more wasabi, change the fish to Tilapia, and add some more lime and olive oil to the slaw

I thought the fish was pretty good, not great, my husband didn't like it much, and our au pair said it reminded her of coconut. I want to try panko again, but I think I'll try another recipe. Also, I like slaw but this one didn't do much for me. So, two forks -- like it, don't love it.

This fish is great! The first time I made it, I made the whole recipe verbatim. The second time, I ditched the slaw and served haricort vert and pesto mashed potatoes. If you're using wasabi-in-a-tube, you can double the amount listed- it's pretty tame.

The fish was really great! The slaw was nice but not fantastic. Beautiful presentation.
