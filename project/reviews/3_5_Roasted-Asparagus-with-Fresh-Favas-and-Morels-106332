I started with 1/2 cup of fava beans (shelled and peeled) and maybe a pound of asparagus, but the result turned out great! Next time I intend to try edemame. The pancetta was very subtle in the blend, as was the sherry vinegar. I'm not sure how other mushrooms would fare, but the expense of the morels gives me pause, so I may experiment with other dried shrooms. Also, you don't need 20 minutes to roast the asparagus; 15 should be fine.

I've made this recipe several times and it is impressive - and, indeed, expensive - so it's great for special occasions. It is both decadent and delicious! As one reviewer said, use fresh morels if you can find them; there is no substitute. That being said, I have used dried morels in a pinch and have been satisfied with the result. I have also substituted, at various times, lima beans and edamame for the favas, but when favas are in season, they're definitely worth the splurge.

This was very good. I would use another mushroom next time, though, or keep them but remove the asparagus. Morels are so good, and so expensive, that they're best where they're the focus. Here they're just a sidebar.

This was really wonderful. I substituted shelled edamame beans (available in most grocery stores now near alfalfa etc.) for the fava and the recipe was fantastic. Also used a different combo of dried mushrooms and shitake and kept the nice complex flavors. Even the people who "hate mushrooms" in my family liked it.

I came upon this recipe a year ago and it has become a favorite whenever fava beans are in season. The only change I made was to use dried porcini mushrooms and I skipped the part that says to remove the skins after blanching. Too tedious and the slight bitter flavor works just fine for us.

There is too much going on in this dish - all these terrific ingredients get overwhelmed with all the others. It looks impressive but tastes messy.

This dish is extremely expensive to make, especially if you spring for fresh morels ($50/pound) instead of using dried. I can't say the flavor was worth the price, so I'd substitute less expensive mushrooms in the dish the next time. After 20 min. in the oven, the asparagus was well cooked. Even though I usually prefer vegetables on the "just cooked" side, they were surprisingly tasty - almost sweet and melt in your mouth soft. The favas and pancetta balance the mushrooms and other ingredients really well. Definitely a great spring time treat.

I made this for company. The flavors were not as strong as I expected and I had a lot of morels left on the serving plate but it was quite attractive.

Please, Please, make this at the HEIGHT (even I hate to capitalize) of the morel. fava, asparagus season.Do not use dried morel unless you have too! If you live near a yuppie grocery store, Whole Foods etc... morels are usually available around the begining to the middle of april and the season runs through juneish. Beg them to stock them. This recipe is awesome! Good w/ spring lamb and lentil "polenta". Do not substitute (although white or black truffle oil w/ the spears would be divine.

Have made two years in a row for Easter dinner, always gets raves. Luckily I haven't had to make substitutions - though finding fresh favas is a bit of a challenge.

i've made a variation of this a few times, always to rave reviews. Haven't seen hide-nor-hair of a fava in central mass for a long time, so that hasn't been part of the story, but the cooking method is good, something different for asparagus (we almost always grill them).

This was a real winner! I made a few modifications to use up ingredients on-hand: finely chopped ham replaced the pancetta, xiao hsing and rice vingegar replaced the sherry vinegar. I used pencil asparagusand cut down on the roasting time. I was also lucky enough to have fresh morels in the fridge! I served it with grilled smoked chicken sausage, and it received raves.

THIS is a fantastic recipe. It's going to become a dinner party staple around here. Love it.

This is a great new way to serve asparagus and well worth the price of ingredients. It's definitely a keeper recipe and one that's great for entertaining. I found dried morels at Whole Foods for $8 bucks and then saw them at Wild Oats for $4.

This is definitely a keeper. It did get a bit pricey, so I'll save it for special occasions.

I thought this was terrific, as did all of my guests. I served it with roasted salmon, which was great because it could all go in there together. The favas/shallot/bacon mixture was a great new taste to go with the asparagus. Will definitely make this again. And, maybe I'm just lucky, but I had no trouble finding favas--morels is where I had difficulty. I couldn't find them, so I used porcinis instead.

Definitely a winner. The roasted asparagus had a lovely nutty flavor . I didn't have sherry vinegar, so I soaked the morels in heated Marsala and the shallot in raspberry vinegar. The results were delicious.

This recipe is expensive and a lot of work between the fava beans (which are not easy to find) and the morel mushrooms and pancetta. However, it was worth it. Delicious!
