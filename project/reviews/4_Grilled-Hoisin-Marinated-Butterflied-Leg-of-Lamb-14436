This was my first time cooking lamb of any kind and it was so good. I can't wait to try more lamb recipes. I marintated overnight and the flavor was amazing.

Delicious recipe. I received major praises from my husband for this lamb dish. I definitely would make again and probably will serve at next dinner party. I took previous reviewers advice and found a low sugar hoison sauce to use. Very good...not too sweet.

One of my all time favorites on this site. I make it as is and sometimes use for kebobs instead of whole leg. A delicious marinade for lamb.

This was the best. Followed directions to the tee and the lamb was perfectly done. Simply garnished with scallions. There were no leftovers.

Wow - this was wonderful. Another recipe on this site for "Hunan Lamb Chops" had virtually the same ingredients in the marinade w/the addition of a little sherry, so I threw that in, too. I made a rack of lamb, marinated 8 hours, cooked under broiler. Served w/roasted garlic and rosemary potatoes and buttered brussel sprouts. Any cut of lamb would be wonderful using this marinade. Enjoy!

Easy to make with a fabulous result. Marinate the lamb overnight. I deleted the salt from the marinade with excellent results.

Fabulous marinade, adds depth and sweetness to the lamb that results in a stunning dish. While the ingredients list might lead you to believe this is an Asian dish, the flavor is broadly suited to an Asian-, American-, or Mediterranean style meal. Occasionally we add rosemary sprigs to the marinade and grill coals, adding a Mediterranean taste. PS - check the ingredients on your hoisin sauce - one of the very common brands is almost all sugar; there is much better taste in those with a more soy-based formula.

Followed the recipe and my wife is still raving about how delicious the lamb was. There were no leftovers as we kept picking on it till the lamb was gone.

Out of this world. This is a great recipe to try with people who are not accustomed to lamb. I used it on a shoulder roast and it turned out beautifully.

We first tried this recipe for Easter dinner - it was a hit - even with lamb-shy people - so delicious, but using the leftovers for the aforementioned salad was a waste (ick)!

We have made it with lamb and now with baby back ribs and it is simply delicious. For those New Yorkers who find themselves longing for take out chinese restaurant ribs this is the marinade for you.

I made this exactly as set forth in the recipe, using Austalian lamb. It was excellent. My guests thought it was excellent, and asked for the recipe. I made the quantity called for, I served ample portions, yet I have a large quantity remaining for leftovers. I cooked it over a gas barbeque for about 32 minutes. I believe it could use a little more, but all in all it was wonderful.

This recipe is simple and has fantastic flavor. Be sure and marinate overnight. We had half a leg of lamb and used the whole marinade recipe so if you have the whole you may want to double. Great recipe for a summer BBQ.

Wonderful dish! Marinated the lamb over-night. Grilled in Weber kettle over a foil pan, with coals in a ring around the pan. Grilled approximatly 1/2 hour. Lamb was perfectly med-rare at 125 degress at thickest part, medium/well at the thinner parts. Only let it rest for 10 minutes before carving - Lamb cools down fast.

This is delicious! I would recommend it to people who don't like lamb as it doesn't have a strong lamb flavor. I have also tried the marinade with pork tenderloin and it was just as fabulous. For the pork I increased the hoisin sauce to 1 cup and doubled the amount of soy sauce as recommended by another reviewer. I cut down on the salt by half since pork is saltier than lamb. I served this with Vietnamese Fried Rice, also from epicurious and my young kids loved the meal!

Very good, but not as flavorful as I would have liked. I roasted this,and that was fine; 425 degrees for 45 minutes = medium rare. Making it again, I'd definitely marinate for more than overnight, maybe 12 hours. And, I'd add more than 3/4 c hoisin sauce, which is what I used because someone else said " 1 c". That's probably right. The scallion brushes were a great touch, too.

good fun preparing. large chunk of meat looks good on the barbie, and takes sufficient time to allow a few cleansing ales. the result is worthy of the plaudits of the hoardes. remember, aussie lamb always tastes better!

Excellent. We marinated the lamb in the morning and it was great. Next time start the day b. before. Our guests, great chefs in their own right, thought it was great too. We "wok'ed" sliced veggies with garlic, ginger and cilantro as a side dish to keep the Asian theme.

Unfortunately, I didn't discover this recipe until after I tried another (not-so-good) one. But I took my leftover roast, cubed it & marinated it with this recipe & then did quick stir-fry to reheat. Served over rice; excellent flavor shone thru!

I've made this recipe many times, and my guests always give it high marks. It's one of my favorites.

This was a nice everyday marinade...great for the cook on the run.

I INCREASE THE HOISING SAUCE TO 1 CUP, AND ADD ANOTHER 2-3 TBS OF SOY SAUCE. MARINATING THIS AT LEAST 24 HOURS MAKES IT AN OUTRAGEOUSLY FABULOUS TASTE!!
