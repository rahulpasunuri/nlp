Once I achieved the correct consistency for the dough, this made the most wonderful, light spaetzle. Our Czechoslovakian guest said it was glorious and tasted of home. That was a high compliment. After making my first batch by pressing it through a colander, I recommend investing in a spaetzle press. It makes it so much easier! I found tha making it one day ahead worked and that it reheats well the next day, sauteed in butter.

I finally got around to making this again. I used the recipe as written, except I only used two eggs, and I swapped the rest of the herbs for parsley, because I had a bunch on hand. It made enough for three as a side dish, and it tasted just like the spätzle I ate in Switzerland. The parsley gave it a really fresh taste, but I would love to modify the recipe to include some browned ground lamb, and only mint in the butter.

This recipe only needs about 1/2 to 2/3 as many eggs as it calls for - and as it's written, it also feeds many more people than "2 as a side dish." I read that and doubled it, and my three hungry friends and I had plentiful leftovers. But the biggest problem was the hugely egg-y taste the spaetzle had; basically what we ate was pulverised poached egg bits fried in herb butter. I would make this again, but I would only use about 1-2 eggs per cup of flour. The herb butter was delicious, though. Next time I might try it with fresh basil.

I got a Spaetzle maker for Christmas and tried it for the first time. It was so easy to use and now I'll be making spaetzle regularly in place of rice. Here's my wacky variation: I added a spoonful of garam masala to the batter. I'm serving chicken curry with the spaetzle in place of the same old basmati rice. I think you can make these plain for Chicken paprikash or add any type of herb to complement your main entre. It's worth buying the spaetzle maker.

I used a potato ricer. Just put a small piece of parchemnt paper or wax paper over the openings...fill...and remove the paper with ricer over bubbling water. Works just fine for me. I've used a colander as well...they come in different sizes with different size holes...don't need any special equiptment...and it works fine as well.

I was a spaetzle rookie before yesterday. Now that I've made spaetzle, my life is complete. HA! No, seriously, this recipe for spaetzle is easy and the dish turns out nicely but let's face it, it's only spaetzle. It's like rice - the earth didn't move. I did purchase a spaetzle maker from Amazon.com for $8 and used it successfully. I also dropped the little buggers into boiling chicken broth instead of water - can't say it made a huge difference, as I tried a batch with water too. Maybe a little more savory, but not a big diff. On the second batch I has run out of dill but had some fresh tarragon, so I used that. Once it's all mushed up together in the food processor you cannot tell the difference. I made this as a side to the classic sauerbraten and everyone raved. My German neighbor said "well, it's not usually green" (the herbed butter turns it a nice bright green) but he liked it.

I'll try this again when I get a spaetzle maker. Otherwise, just drop huge spoonfuls in. Passing it through a colander (like I saw demonstrated on a cooking show) is a VERY bad decision. I speak from experience.

This is a wonderful recipe. However, I almost always use chicken broth to simmer the dumplings instead of water. It is especially good when making simple spaetzle with only butter and parmesan cheese. Gives the dumplings a much richer flavor. I would also try beef or vegetable broth.

Very nice for a summer evening. I made this with varkenshaas. I nice complement of flavors.

Very good basic recipe, but it needs more flour. I used 1 1/3 Cups and it was the perfect consistency(very thick but still pourable). I also added the herbs to the batter to give the spaetzle some color. My husband is Austrian and he raved about them!

Very good. I used a colander with large holes in it, since I do not have a spaetzle maker yet. The only thing was that my husband thought the herb flavor was too strong, so next time I will cut back a little. I used fresh herbs from the garden, and they usually have more flavor than store bought, so keep this in mind when you are making it.

These are pretty easy to make. You don't need a spaetzle maker, just use a colander. You can interchange the herbs pretty easily or just leave them out if you want. Great with a little brown butter and fresh sage.

The spaetzle were a bit lighter than I expected, but were good. Would maybe cut down on the egg or add a bit more flour next time.

This is exactly what I hoped it would be! I order these little dumplings anytime I see them on a menu. This was easier than I thought, although it took me a little longer than 30 minutes because I don't have a food processor. I used a blender, which worked, but I spent a lot of time scraping herbs and butter down the sides in between pulses. The little spaetzles didn't need the herbed butter, they would be good with just butter and parmesan cheese. The herbed butter made it more of a summery main dish than the heavy wintery side dish to a gulyas (goulash) or thick stew which I'm used to having. I may try it again with other fresh herbs. YUM!
