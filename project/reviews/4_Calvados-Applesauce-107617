Made this to have with our latkes and brisket tonight. Used the apples I had on hand but otherwise followed the recipe. Tasted it before and after the calvados was added. It does make a nice difference. Easy to make and a nice side dish.

This is a very good applesauce. After reading the other reviews, I tripled the recipe and it still only made about a quart of applesauce. Also, cooked it longer due to liquid not evaporating as quickly as expected. Used the potato masher since we like our applesauce chunky and more rustic. You can also use any other kind of apple brandy if you don't have Calvados on hand. A great side for pork chops or pork roast. Good autumn dish and a good way to use all those apples!

This is a wonderful guide recipe. I very rarely make things exactly as the recipe says, (who really has everything in their house at the same time!)Since this is a dry house I used a splash of essence for the Calvados but I'm eating it right now as I type this and my only complaint is that the recipe doesn't cook up enough applesauce. Next time I'll double or triple the batch. It's that good!

OK, this stuff is seriously good. Made it the first time with the Apple and Calvados Tart. Then made it for my husband on Valentines and topped with heavy cream (not whipped) mixed with a little powdered sugar and Calvados. Nummy, nummy, nummy

This tart is superb. I've made it 4 times now and my guests loved it. Definitely use Plugra butter. It makes all the difference in the world. It's fantastique!

This is a tried and true dessert. I have now made this dessert 6 times. I have changed it a bit using peaches instead of apples and it is truly delicious. I always use Julia Child's butter pastry dough recipe and it never fails. I actually didn't try this pastry dough.

This recipe is so easy I make it fresh every time I'm serving a pork roast -- 4 stars in my book - -I would definitely make it again.

Excellent!

I made this as written except omitted the lemon zest. Very nice, very quick, and very easy! The Calvados is a nice touch- not overbearing at all.

Fabulous! I would definitely agree with the other reviewers that you only need about 1/4 cup of sugar, though.

Delicious. Easy. I modified the recipe somewhat! Gala, fuji and golden delicious in equal quantities. A couple of pears. An inch long piece of ginger. Half a cup of grape juice and a cup of water. Half a cup of sugar per the recipe. A pinch of salt. No calvados because I was making for toddlers. Because of the quantity of fruit, it took longer to cook. Went at it with a potato masher to keep it chunky. May never buy applesauce from the grocery again! Next time, may add raisins to the final product. Maybe a splash of vanilla?

Very tasty and ridiculously easy to make. I agree that the sugar should be cut down; I only added 1/3 cup and it was still a bit too sweet. (Okay level for a dessert, but overkill for a side dish.) 1/4 cup would probably be just right. I didn't have a lemon on hand, so I substituted some minced fresh ginger. Also added a dash or two of allspice. Fabulous depth of flavor!

I canned this sauce for Xmas gifts. Very good and easy. It took much longer to cook than listed in the recipe. I used less sugar and would cut it down even more next time, maybe in half.

Delicious. Comes out chunky if you use a potato masher.

This is great, and super-easy. The Calvados really does add an extra depth of flavor. I like it warm with pork, too.

This applesauce recipe is worth making just on its own! The Calvados brandy really does make a difference. I've also substituted Amaretto, and rum, and it adds an extra depth of flavor to the applesauce. For the tart recipe, which is delicious, I recommend cooking the applesauce until all the water is gone and it's looking a little dry before adding the brandy, and then cook it another minute or two until it's looking a little dry again. Helps keep the piecrust flaky and not soggy, I think.

This is part of the Apple Calvados Tart (Galette de Pommes au Calvados)featured in the 1/2003 GOURMET. I usually don't tackle pastry-type recipes, but this is easy - a definite keeper!
