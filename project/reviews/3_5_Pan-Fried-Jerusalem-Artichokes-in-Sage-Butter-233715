I had a pound and a half of jerusalem artichokes from my organic veggie basket, and I was looking for something new and simple to do with them (in the past I had made them into soup or simply steamed them). I have a sage plant in my garden that I had not used since I bought it in the summer (it's now mid-november) and it was nice to be able to take advantage of that before it snows. Unfortunately I did not have fresh parsley, so I used dried. At first I multiplied the butter, but I didn't end up using the extra when I noticed there was plenty of oil left in the pan after frying the chokes. This is definitely a tasty recipe!

Very good recipe! The lemon sage butter is completely delicious! If you don't know what to do with Jerusalem artichokes, this is an excellent recipe. I also recommend peeling them.

This was the first time I have cooked sunchokes and I will definitely make them again. The recipe was easy and the sunchokes were very flavorful. Even my less adventurous boyfriend enjoyed them!

This was a pretty tasty way to use up a bag of Jerusalem artichokes that I impulsively bought at the farmer's market and didn't know what to do with. Anything fried in sage butter would be good though, and I'm not sure that the Jerusalem artichokes added anything different to the dish than potatoes would have. Either way, it was yummy, if not healthy.

Nice way to enjoy Jerusalem artichokes! You need to cook them until they're done, and you need to get the salt just right.

Taste-wise, these were pretty good and I had always wanted to try Jerusalem artichokes and wanted something other than a puree or mashed with other things. However, I had very small ones from my farmer's market and it was a pain in the neck to pan fry these. It took forever. I did not peel them either, which is totally unnecessary. This does make a nice side and I did like the fried sage bits.

great recipe which we would make more often if it weren't for the after effects of consuming this dangerous little veggie! anyone that has grown them in their garden knows how they multiply rapidly from year to year... we share them with unsuspecting friends when we can't seem to stomach eating any more!

The flavors blended well, a good way to serve jerusalem artichokes. I agree with other reviewers who mentionned to grossly peel them.

I wish there was a 3.5 fork! I really love this dish. I've made it twice and it's so easy and yummmy! I peeled the sunchokes too and it makes them easier to eat.

These were really great! I actually didn't use the sage, just a little garlic and butter. They were crispy and went really well with the tenderloin I was having. I love having a new option for a side! I peeled them as suggested.

I agree with the previous review in that I'd give these a light peeling before cooking. I had sauteed chicken breasts in the same pan before I made this and the chicken fat and juices added a lot of flavor to this(compensate by not adding as much oil). This would be a side dish. It's a little awkward as an appetizer.

Would you serve this as a side dish or could you serve it as an appetizer?

I lightly peel the tubers before cooking. These are delicious.
