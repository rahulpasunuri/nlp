I've been making this recipe since 1991. It is an easy and delicious meatloaf. The only change I make is omitting the pinenuts. I often make this for friends and can't believe it turkey and they all love the herbs and sun dried tomatoes.

Simple to prepare.Very tasty result. I used 1/2 an onion, a celery stalk, a handful of chopped mushrooms. Sauteed all together. I used oatmeal at the recommendation of the previous reviewer great texture and moisture. Added a splash of cream in with the milk.

Loved this, I didn't have bread crumbs, used oatmeal and two eggs b/c some said it was too soft & cooked for 60 min. Turned out great

I loved this meatloaf. Full of flavor! I would recommend it to anyone who loves sundried tomatoes and pine nuts. I used the marinated sun-dried tomatoes. Oh, and I did not use a whole onion, but I did use a red onion.

This is such an easy weeknight dinner. Really good consistency- not mushy or dried out. I added a little fresh basil and halved the pine nuts because my husband isn't the biggest fan. I served it with a nice caprese. Will definitely be making again- it really doesn't get any easier.

My wife, who does not eat red meat, liked this very much. The sundried tomatoes lent a nice flavor without being too pronounced. But I found this recipe to produce a meatloaf that was a bit too soft for my taste. We were unable to get good slices out of it without them falling apart. I prefer a more 'meaty' meat-loaf, and have made a turkey meatloaf with spinach that I liked alot. This was just ok for me... I might try again with less breadcrumbs.

Very moist and flavorful. I used Italian flavored breadcrumbs. Made a good sandwich the next day.

I made this recipe exactly as written, and I'm having a difficult time understanding why it has earned so many high scores. I took the first bite and was completely disappointed with this dish. I thought I should at least try a second bite after which I proceeded to throw the entire meatloaf sadly into the garbage. This was definately not one of my favorites.

This recipe is very good. (I added a teaspoon of garlic powder) Then I combined a cooking technique from a different recipe and had a huge winner! Instead of baking one loaf, I formed the meat mixture into smaller individual loaves. I browned them in a skillet with a little bit of olive oil, then topped them with a bit of HOMADE brand chili sauce and baked them on a broiling pan at 500 degrees (yes, 500) until the internal temp reached 160 degrees (10 - 15 minutes). A yummy keeper!

I really don't like meatloaf, but wanted a dish for a weekday dinner. As this seemed new and fresh, I thought I would try it. It did not disappoint. I now LOVE MeatLoaf!....that is to say Turkey Meat Loaf with Sun-Dried Tomatoes!!! I could not find ground turkey, so substituted for ground chicken. It was full of flavour. I made this dish along with Pototo Gratin with Goat Cheese and Garlic...a match made in heaven!

It's hard to believe that turkey meatloaf could taste this good. I used homemade breadcrumbs. Great flavor and very moist.

Easy and tasty. Both times I've made this to take for lunch at work, I've had co-workers commenting on how good it smells. The recipe also works fine with ground chicken. Note to those of you with gluten issues, or those of you who want an extra protein kick: in lieu of the breadcrumbs and milk, I cooked half a cup of quinoa, drained it and let it cool, then added it to the loaf mixture. The grain contributed nicely to the texture, and the nutty taste of quinoa worked well in the recipe.

Absolutely the best meat loaf I have had. Really moist, which sort of surprised me. I added feta cheese, which eliminated the need to add salt and gave it great flavor. Wonderful- even my boyfriend who doesn't like ground turkey loved it!

My wife and I (the cook this time) agree that this is THE best meat loaf we've ever had. Better than even the "glitz" of local restaurant's meat loaf

The relatively few ingredients makes this a breeze. I added some frozen corn kernels for extra texture. The loaf is moist and very flavorful. Of all the dishes I have made my husband for the first time said he would ask me to make this one again.

This was delicious. It turned out very moist and flavorful...and it was super easy to make.

I used ground lean veal instead. I cut back on the amount of bread crumbs and added approximately 1/2 cup of chopped kalmata olives and 1/4 cup chopped basil. I served it topped with a sauce I made from chopped tomatoes, basil and 35% cream.

I LOVE this recipe. We make it once a week. Makes great meatloaf sandwhiches too.

Different tasting. Very good change from the usual meatloaf fare. Would definitely make it again.

I've had much better turkey meat loaf recipes, on this site, too. A bit dry, bland and overwhelmingly boring. I guess maybe it's just me because everyone has given it such high marks.

I made this tonight for a change of pace. We loved it. Next time I'd decrease the amount of pine nuts.

I loved this. I have high cholesterol so any alternative to beef is a godsend. I used turkey breast, egg substitute and a spicy homemade bbq sauce in place of ketchup with excellent results. As the other reviews noted, it is nicely moist as well. Try it!

This was a really terrific turkey meat loaf! I have made a couple of different recipes for turkey meatloaf and none were a moist and tasty as this one. I used all breast-meat ground turkey and I was a little worried that it would be too dry. But, no problem. I would definitely make it again, and now I'm looking forward to left over's tomorow night.

I had just come back from vacation and didn't have bread so used 3/4 cup of dried bread crumbs and added several generous shakes of cumin... delicious! and very, moist. A very healthy and tasty dish.

Yum! Have made this twice now. This time I added less pine nuts (1/3 cup) and chopped them slightly. Good food!

Wonderful recipe. Best recipe that I've made yet from this website. The Ketchup topping can be doctored up by simply adding a little dry mustard and brown sugar. I also used the sundried tomatoes that weren't packed in oil as another reader had suggested.

It came out delicious and moist! I used ground, dark meat turkey, and fresh rather than dried herbs. The pine nuts add a delightful crunch though I put less then the recipe called for. The sundried tomatos added a nice bit of tang. My husband really enjoyed it too. Lastly, its a very easy to do. I will make it again.
