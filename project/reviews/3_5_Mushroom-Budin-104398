A yummy casserole. The sauce really makes the dish. I made the sauce the night before and then the dish didn't take that long to prepare for dinner.

This recipe was great. I had to make a few substitutions because apparently in the Philadelphia area it is virtually impossible to fine dried chilis on Labor day so I used Ancho chiles for the sauce and it was still really great. I'll definitely make this one again. Everyone loved it.

3.5 forks. I agree with the cook who suggested below that one should wait to add the cilantro -- while I tend to follow recipes more closely the first time I make them, I found myself wondering why I was adding cilantro at the point specified, but dutifully did so nevertheless. Next time I will wilt it in to the cooked mushroom mixture. I would also consider increasing the number of tortillas to 16 so as to create one completely flat layer; instead I ended up with a moat of sauce along the sides of the casserole, though these saucy sides did thicken up nicely. For a sauce of greater complexity (for the non-vegetarian), I would try using some chicken broth instead of exclusively the chile soaking liquid. I am eager to try this dish as a leftover tomorrow night; by then I'm sure the flavors will be better melded. Caution: Be careful when toasting the chiles for the sauce. I ended up with watering eyes for a good hour! All in all a very nice vegetarian dish...

My husband went crazy over this recipe. It was a labor instensive and many dish affair, however the results were worth it! I will double it in the future.

P.S. including the fresh cilantro in the saute is a mistake. it will lose its flavor. either mix it in with the cheese or the mushrooms after they are cooked.

I doubled this recipe for an office party. It was just great and everyone loved it. It took a long time to make though, especially because the sauce is so labor-intensive. But it is delicious. I recommend doubling the recipe because it doesn't add any time to the recipe.
