Despite the other cook's review - I quite liked this recipe. I didn't think it was too clovey, or dry. And the glaze is superb.

I have made hundreds of cakes in my lifetime, including wedding cakes and this is the worst cake I have ever tasted. It actually was worse the next day as cloves intensified. The first day it tasted exactly like the traditional old-fashioned fruitcake, and was inedible the second day. If you want to fool with this recipe, nix the orange peel and use just a pinch of cloves. HOWEVER--do keep the glaze recipe as it is very good.
