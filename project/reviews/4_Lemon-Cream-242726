Like others said, the sugar/egg white step seemed overly laborious so I just whipped 8 ounces of cream with a little vanilla and powdered sugar and folded that into the lemon curd. The result was truly delicious stuff, with a texture in between sauce and pudding.

I had the most delicious lemon cream dessert in Spain where they used olive oil. Has anyone tried that?

I use the first half of this recipe constantly as a super-quick, not too sweet lemon curd...the egg white/sugar step is totally unnecessary if you want a smoother, denser curd. Works great with panna cotta, too.

I love this lemon cream! But I skipped the whole second step of cooking the egg whites with sugar - was too laborious, and the cream still came out lick-your-plate delicious.

My custard cooked quickly on direct heat. It was very good with the Blueberry Pie! I wowed my 4th of July guests!
