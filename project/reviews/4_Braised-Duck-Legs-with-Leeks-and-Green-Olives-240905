Delicious! I used dried thyme since no fresh available. I used spanish olives.

I'll definitely make this again. It's important to use good olives as it really helps bring the dish together. I would definitely shorten the cooking time. I cooked the last part for only 45 minutes rather than 60-90 and I think it was still a bit too long. The only change I would make next time is to add more cooking liquid. I would prefer the veg mixture at the end to be a bit saucier. After removing the duck fat, I had about 1/4 cup of liquid left!

I did the variation with figs and red wine, since I didn't have olives. It was spectacularly simple and delicious, served with gnocchi and a green salad. It will definitely enter my repertoire, and I look forward to trying the original as well as the other variations.

Delicious! The sauce was very tasty and the duck legs looked beautiful and were done just right. We served it with gnocchi and green salad. It was quite easy too.

This is a fantastic recipe. Duck is too often paired with sweet and fruity flavors; here it gets a savory treatment. I followed the recipe exactly. After all, Alice Waters is very knowledgeable. I had doubts about not browning the legs, but they come out brown in the end. Lucques olives were perfect.

A wonderful combination of flavors! This recipe is a definite keeper. I served this with roasted fennel and stewed flageolet beans. The cooking technique yields beautifully tender duck despite a relatively short cooking time.

Excellent. It took me three separate trips to grocery stores to find the duck legs, but well worth the effort (Can you say Uwajimaya?) Though I would imagine chicken would be a fine substitute. Followed the recipe to a tee, and served over fresh wilted spinach. The olives were what made the dish in my opinion.

How can you go wrong with duck legs, picholines and leeks?! I made this for Christmas Eve and it was delicious. Today I'm making it with mirepoix instead of olives and leeks since I don't have either of those ingredients on hand. I'm expecting it will still be super. I may throw in some tapenade at the end to make up for the missing olives.

I was a great recipe when I used quality French duck, mediocre with small frozen duck legs. I left the leeks in bigger pieces so one can enjoy them. I would take at least 45 minutes off the cooking time.

This is easy and delicious! I left out the olives because I'm not a fan, but a fabulous recipe.

Wonderful depth of flavor in the sauce. I used picholine olives, which were perfect with the wine and vegetables. The duck was cooked nicely. Served with creamy parmesan polenta and green beans. Next time will try with figs and red wine instead.

I loved the flavors here but I did change the cooking time a bit with 1h at 325 and 45minutes at 350. The duck legs were tender and well done. The carrots had retained some of the flavors of the herbs, olives and duck and I used them as a garnish for green beans.

I'm in the minority here, but this recipe simply did not work. The duck legs were so tough we could barely cut through the meat, much less chew it. It needs to cook longer. A huge disappointment.

I got a really good deal on duck legs at the market, but the decision to make them was very last minute so I didn't have all of the ingredients. I substituted sliced pearl onions and garlic for leeks, dried peaches for olives, and tarragon for thyme. It came out really nice, even with all of the substitutions. The duck was tender; cooked just right! I would use this recipe again for sure!

A great and easy recipe for entertaining; I didn't change a thing. So delicious; I will definitely make it again.

This dish was fantastic! I used a medium onion and 2 cloves of garlic instead of the leeks, 3 legs rather than 4, and only 1 cup of the chicken broth. Also, per the suggested variations, I used red wine and dried figs rather than white wine and olives. Served with arborio rice. Duck at its best!
