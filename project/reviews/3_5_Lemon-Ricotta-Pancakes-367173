These sounded so good, I was looking forward to trying them. Mine came out tough and rubbery. I won't be making them again.

This requires more prep than the average pancake recipe but the results are almost too good to be put in the same category as a pancake. We used semolina instead of chestnut flour. If you like pancakes, then I imagine you will LOVE these.

If I could give these more than four forks I would. They were to die for. Yes, they take pretty much every bowl in the kitchen, but the results are REALLY worth it. Like the previous reviewers I also substituted regular flour and next time will skip draining the ricotta... I can't think of anything that would improve these, but next time I want to fold some berries into the batter. Oh, and leftovers freeze very well.

These are the best home-made pancakes I have ever made! They're so moist, and with the hint of lemon, it just makes the pancakes even more delicious. I have to say though, it did take me a while to make the batter, but it was well worth the time. It also takes a lot of bowls to make the batter, so be prepared. I also could not find chestnut flour, I looked at Whole Foods and at another high-end grocery store but had zero luck. I just ended up substituting regular flour. I also had some strawberry-blackberry freezer jam that I just thawed and put it on the pancakes... delicious!

These are probably the best pancakes I've ever made. I knew they were good because my husband didn't say a single thing while eating them and cleared his plate in a matter of minutes. Its the perfect slow, Sunday morning breakfast dish because its a little more involved then other pancake recipes. However, the work is totally worth it. Next time I would not put the ricotta in a cheesecloth. I used store-bought ricotta so it was already pretty dense so I could just eliminate that extra work. I also didn't have chestnut flour so I substituted regular flour. I topped them off with a really small bit of pure maple syrup, which was the perfect final touch for them. I highly recommend these pancakes. They are fun to make and delicious to eat.
