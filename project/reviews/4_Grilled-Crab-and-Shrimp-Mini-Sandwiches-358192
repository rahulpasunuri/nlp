I made it as a melt as well with a garlic/rosemary bread and it was wonderful.

This was delicious! The onion was a bit much though so the next time I make it, I'll only use 1/4 cup. I also made it as a melt. Spread one slice of thick sourdough bread with butter, brown on the griddle, then top with the shrimp/crab mix. Sprinkle sharp grated cheddar on top generously, broil for about 5 mins. Sprinkle a little old bay seasoning on top and oh man, it's goooood.
