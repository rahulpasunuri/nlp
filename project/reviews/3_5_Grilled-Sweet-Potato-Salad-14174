This is one of those deceptively simple recipes that surpasses the sum of its parts. In keeping with a more Southwest feel, I added toasted pepitas and chipotle. I also suggest adding more scallion than the recipe calls for--the crisp contrast with the sweet potato is great. I made this recently for a cookout and the bowl was practically licked clean.

This recipe is TERRIFIC..... I did not grill the potatoes, just oven roasted and I did add just a bit of ground ginger. But my goodness - CROWD PLEASER - to both young and old for our holiday bbq.

Just OK. I followed the recipe to a T and my guests enjoyed the potatoes but were not raving about them. I'm not sure what it would take to make this outstanding...

I love the idea of grilling sweet potatoes (because I adore sweet potatoes and grilling brings out the flavors in so many foods). The dressing was a little plain and the salad was good, but did not have as much flavor as I had hoped. My recommendations - careful not to overcook the potatoes during boiling. Cook them until JUST tender so they can finish on the grill. Use a HOT grill so the potatoes char and this will bring out some flavor. Increase the lime and cilantro too.

I roasted the slices, coated with some of the oil mixture, instead of grilling them. Then dressed them while warm, but did not add the scallions until just a bit before serving at room temperature. The dish was very tasty, and really pretty served in a glass bowl and garnished with the limes and cilantro.

My family loved this recipe. I cooked both ways grilling and baking. It turned out great both times. To the cook in Wisconsin, coriander and cilantro are the same plant; however, Cilantro is the name of the leaf and Coriander is the seed which is usually ground and used as a seasoning, as well.

I didn't have access to a grill, requiring me to use my oven. I more than parbroiled the sweet potatoes, then broiled them for about ten minutes or until brown. Noone noticed the difference. They were delicious.

Very tasty. There are several steps, but many can be done in advance. I served the salad at room temperature, which was great. The lime and scallions are the perfect match for the sweetness of the potatoes.

This was delicious - a really tasty (and healthier!) alternative to traditional potato salad! I made this ahead to bring to a cookout, but after reading others' tips, I held off on dressing the salad until it was almost time to serve. It was well-received, and I didn't have any to bring home. P.S. - I also agree w/ the previous post re: coriander/cilantro - it's not called coriander in my market's produce section!

ACTUALLY POSTED TO WRONG RECIPE. SO REPEATING, IF YOU SCREW UP A RECIPE, PLEASE DO NOT REVIEW IT. NO ONE CARES TO HEAR A COMMENT ON BURNT FOOD!

Just a side comment...why specify coriander leaves insted of cilantro? Someone at Epicurious should decide which name to apply to this herb and stick to it in all recipes. My understanding is that Coriander and Cilantro are the same plant...in North America, we call the leaves cilantro, and the seeds coriander.To call for coriander leaves is just plain confusing.

I loved this recipe! I roasted the sliced and peeled potatoes (450 degrees)just until tender on a cookie sheet with some of the oil mixture, then turned on the broiler to lightly brown them. The toasted pecans, cilantro and lime wedges make a beautiful, tasty garnish. These just might be the best sweet potatoes I have ever had. Def. a wonderful company side-dish. I served with asparagus and grilled salmon.

this has become a family favorite. I simply roast in the oven to make life easier - just don't overcook. The lime dressing is fresh and goes great w/ any grilled food.

I ruined this recipe and it still got great feedback...I also broiled, and it took forever, surpisingly. I had guests visiting so after awhile I forgot to check on them and some were way overcooked. However, I picked out the slices that were totally black and served the rest and people thought it was nice. Not too much flavor, but just the right amount.

To make ahead for company: I boiled the potatoes at 8AM and let them cool. Peeled them and grilled around 10AM. Let them sit out until cool, covered with roasted walnut pieces. At 3, I warmed them quickly in the microwave and dressed them for an early dinner. Everyone loved them. Great flavor.

The boiling, peeling, cutting, grilling was way too cumbersome for me. Hard to get the potato cooked through without having the ends too soft. Next time I'll try just roasting them in the oven to see how the flavors meld, but otherwise, I won't make this again. Not worth the effort.

Tried indoor, one pan version --"braising" the potato chunks, draining, and then saute with half the oil and cumin. Finish with dressing off heat. Probably would have gotten more caramelization on the potatoes rather than the pan if I'd used nonstick. Worked well, though.

I roasted the potatoes in the oven instead because I the grill was full with other food. Oven baking worked great. The end result of the simple ingredients is very favorful. A healthy alternative to mayo potato salad.

I hesitated to make these with the meal because I had a hard time imagining how they would come out, but I'm glad I tried them! Excellent surprise twist on grilled potatoes- everyone loved them.

This is a great variety on regular potato salad and easy to make when already grilling. I served with the garlic, lemon chicken recipe from same month of Bon Appetit. Made extra sauce to drizzle. Be careful not to over boil the potatos or they will be harder to wrok with. This one is yummy!

YUM! Have made this dish twice now with rave reviews everytime. To make ahead, I parboil the potatoes, toss the potatoes into the oil mixture, slap onto a cookie sheet & place in fridge, taking them out about an hour before grilling to get to room temp. Wouldn't change a thing!

Easy and excellent. Even my sweet potato-loathing spouse had seconds. A ringing endorsement if ever there was one.

Apparently not a make-ahead dish like basic potato salad. Thought I would take this to a picnic, grilling the sweet potatoes the night before. Does not work. Obviously this is to be served hot off the grill. Will try again, but thought I would share my disaster with others.

While I found this relatively pleasant, it was much more interesting with the additions of brown sugar, ginger and jalapenos.

A definite winner for us. This is faster than making regular potato salad and is a refreshing twist on a old tradition. I recommend putting the sweet potato slices in a bowl and tossing to coat with the olive oil rather than taking the time to brush each slice indiviually. This is a great fusion of sweet and tangy without being overwhelming to the tastebuds. I get asked for the recipe anytme I serve it. Enjoy!

This recipe is a delight for the senses. Perfect for anyone looking for a lower fat alternative to regular potato salad (you can reduce the amount of oil), or just a fresh spin on a tired mayo based tradition. Even my "must be meat and potatoes" Dad gave it a thumbs up when he was over for dinner... so four forks it is.

Excellent dish! As others have said, parboiling is not mandatory. I had good luck roasting these covered in the oven and dressing them warm.

These potatoes were really great. The cumin and coriander added a surprising compliment to the sweetness of the potatoes. I served these potatoes with the Grilled Rack of Lamb w/ Tomato Mint dressing and Orzo Feta Tomato salad. What a great summer meal!

made it yesterday for a 4th of july bbq & it was extremely well received. to avoid dealing with the grill, i parboiled the sweet potatoes & then "toasted" them under the broiler for about four minutes on each side & it worked just fine. very forgiving recipe & would be great leftover.

This dish was excellent. I used a grill basket (so my husband wouldn't have to turn 20 indv. slices) and it worked just as well. Very easy ... and a huge hit.

This dish is great-looking, and my guests loved it. I too think that boiling the potatoes isn't necessary, and my guess is that broiling or even baking the sweet potatoes would be an acceptable substitute for the parboiling routine. The cilantro is wonderful with the potatoes; the limes are beautiful with this dish (to me, the lime taste itself doesn't end up being that distinctive). Great with pork.

I have not made this recipe, but grilled sweet potatoes are a summer staple at our house. I do not par boil them. I simply wrap the chunked potatoes, chopped sweet red pepper and vidalia onions with some olive oil in a double layer of aluminum foil and place it on the grill for about 1/2 hour. This recipe sounds like it could easily be done in this manner and without the fuss of parboiling.

I did this as a side for grilled lamb kebabs with coriander and cumin. My initial assessment was "too much hassle" but I have gotten remarkable positive feedback from my dinner guests. I think the trick is not to over cook the sweet potatoes at the parboil stage. Don't know why they call it a salad, but it is very pretty & a bit beyond the quotidian

This is wonderful! It was a nice counterpoint to the Asian-Flavored Seared Tuna with Green Beans, and we plan to have it again on the Fourth of July with the Grilled Baby Back Pork Ribs with Mustard Bourbon Sauce.

A nice change from baked sweet potatoes, which I also love. I did them under the broiler as it was a little cold out to grill. My husband wouldn't eat the coriander, but liked them without. Delicious and different!

I have made this salad several times and have had better luck with the potatoes under the broiler (they brown more evenly). Either way this is absolutely delicious.

Very unusual flavors. Not the normally "sweet" sweet potato recipe that you see. I served this at a formal dinner for eight people. I grilled the potatos during the day. Appearance was excellent. I kept them on a baking tray and then warmed them just before serving. Also added the marinade just before I put on the plates so the potatos were not soggy. Easy and very nice presentation. Although I multiplied the recipe by 1.5 to accommodate 8 people. There was way too much. The recipe, as is, can easily feed eight or even 10.

Delicious. My husband, who turns his nose up at nearly anything having to do with sweet potatoes, tasted these and swooned. (He did, really.) Not only did he devour this dish, but he has asked me to make it at our next dinner party. (I served these with the Grilled Baby Back Pork Ribs with Mustard-Bourbon Sauce. YUM!)

What a clever way to dress sweet potatoes! My guests (including a 12 year old) loved this. Served with grilled lamb kebabs (recipe on site), and grilled asparagus & red peppers. I simmered the potatoes for 30 minutes (too long). Also, the potatoes could have been grilled longer. They had no grill flavor.

I served the salad with the sausage and absolutely loved it. We will be serving it to guests on our next cookout. I couldn't get the sweet potato to turn golden brown in the grill.
