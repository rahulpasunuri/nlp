Delicious and definitely not ordinary! The bite of the peperoncini and red onion nicely compliment the mildness of the cheese,olives, and red pepper. YUMMY!

I made this for the first time this week, attracted to it by its terrific name, and it's gone directly into my heavy-rotation summer recipe collection. It's delicious and a snap to make. It's the first time I've used peperoncini, and I'm going to look for more recipes that use it! I write a blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins, and this is one of the recipes I featured on it.
