This is a good base recipe. I make the salmon with the rosemary rub, but dont do the parsnips and potatoes.

I was so bummed that I forgot about all the reviews saying that this recipe was too salty as is. I made it pretty much to a T for Christmas Eve dinner and was greatly disappointed. It was so salty that I couldn't even finish my portion. I'm confused how everyone can give this such good reviews when if you cook it as written it is rather inedible. I didn't think that the flavor was that great to make it worth trying again with less salt. Very bummed to have served this dish to my family for a special meal.

I had some concerns about the recipe after reading the reviews about the saltiness. I made the paste exactly by the recipe. If one takes a bite of the salmon with the paste it is a bit too salty but if there are potato or parsnips on the fork, it's perfect. I was able to reduce the paste to one half of the recipe since I was serving less people, it worked fine. Also, even though there are not many brown bits-it's worth using some red wine and reducing it for a sauce. I would recommend for a fall, hardy approach to salmon.

I agree that the salt needs to be cut down. It's too hot to turn on the oven here, so I cooked it in metal pie plates on my grill. I turned one side up to high and placed the food on the other side. Worked great. Cooking times were about the same. Did the wine part on the stove top.

We have cooked this meal a couple of times and love it. Our one issue we are trying to sort out is the salt level. We use coarse sea salt and I cut back the amount the first time by a teaspoon and it was too salty (I figured the sea salt would be stronger tasting than the kosher). The second time we cut the salt in half and it was still a little too strong. But, I also tend to use very little salt while cooking preferring to allow individuals to salt/pepper to their taste. When I try this again, it will be with a single teaspoon of sea salt and I think it will then be perfect. For the veggies, it is always a good idea to check them as they cook to avoid becoming mush. We have a rosemary bush in our front yard that is not treated with any chemicals, and I love using it for cooking. That coupled with some beautiful salmon makes me very happy. Wonderful recipe that just needs a little tweaking to make it perfect.

I made this for dinner tonight. Although I didn't do the rosemary pesto correctly, (dumped everything in the processor at once) it turned out pretty well. My oven wasn't up to 450 when I stuck in the veggies, but were perfectly done after 40 minutes. I thought the rosemary pesto was too salty for the fish, even after cutting out approx. 1 tsp. Next time I'll try just two tsp. of salt. The salmon was really delicious and despite the salty factor, everyone really liked it.

A very good and very easy recipe. I made this for 2 and did not do the 'greens' presentation or the wine/deglazing since there weren't any juices from the veggies.

Served this as well on Christmas Eve and everyone loved it. Not only is it delicious, it's so easy and fast to prepare. I would cut down on some of the salt however, but that's my preference. Will definately make this again.

We served this on Christmas Eve and everybody loved it! The salmon was moist and delicious and the potatoes were yummy too...may be a new tradition!

My four-fork review refers to the salmon, though the greens were also tasty. My father made this for Christmas dinner, and the flavors were excellent.

We prepared this dish for Christmas Eve dinner and were absolutely dazzled. We were a little concerned that the rosemary would overwhelm the dish, but to our delight, the fresh garden rosemary paste was an elegant companion to the succulent flaky Columbia River King Salmon. We followed the recipe au pied de la lettre, but baked the veggies 10 minutes longer in a shallow oval le Creuset baking dish. Instead of greens, we sauteed asparagus in olive oil, a perfect complement to the salmon. Washed down with a bright Henry Estate Pinot Gris, this is a festive, flavorful, easy and delicious dish for any time of year or any occasion.

This was by far the best salmon dish I have ever had. I actually put the rub on the salmon in the morning and let is set for 6 hours. Everyone raved about it. I'm making it again on Christmas Eve and I can't wait to eat it!!

Made this as a trial run for Christmas dinner. Fantastic. Loved the flavor of the rosemary with the salmon and the vegetables. My husband did not even know he was eating parsnip! Can't wait to serve for Christmas dinner.

This is a masterful recipe--now a classic in my repertoire! The salty, crunchy and pungent rosemary paste is a perfect foil to the ultra-fresh and undercooked salmon. I did add some garlic to the vegetable mix and eliminated the mushrooms (too much moisture?). I used the freshest salmon available that day--Norwegian farmed (not previously frozen). The guests gushed with praise! This was for a very important and elegant dinner--for which I did not want to spend much time and effort in the kitchen. It was perfect!

This is a masterful recipe--about to become a classic in my repertoire! The salmon has to be the freshest and best for the crunchy, salty and pungent rosemary paste to work. I used a not-previously-frozen Norwegian farmed side of salmon (suggested by the fishmonger). I did add some minced garlic to the oil and paste-tossed vegetables. I also omitted the mushrooms, not wanting excess moisture. Cooking the salmon until just opaque is key to the succulence. I served this for a very important dinner, also not wanting to spend much time in the kitchen. A perfect choice which each guest gushed over! Don't shy away from the kosher salt in the paste. The undercooked, fresh salmon is a perfect foil. They go together well.

Served this at a Holiday Party and was very impressed. Super easy, quick assembly, only the parsnips to peel and chop, and very moist. I used Convection Bake @450 and this worked a treat. I did not follow the amount of salt required and just added my usual amount of seasoning and it was perfect. Added a tiny bit more to the potatoes as they were half way through roasting.

I made this for a dinner party recently and it got rave reviews. The rosemary rub was really flavorful but did not at all overpower the salmon (which turned out so moist and perfectly cooked). We enjoyed the roasted veggies on the side but I would have cooked them perhaps 2 minutes less.

OK...this one gave me a LOT of trouble. First, the amount of salt in the rosemary paste made it completely inedible. Second, are you sure about 450 degrees? My vegetables were mush after only 20 minutes (no surprise there) but that temperature annihilated my salmon. I'm a big fan of Epicurious, and this is the first recipe to trigger an epic fail at dinner. Did you test this one?

As with the previous reviewer, I thought that the uncooked paste would have been overwhelming and too salty, but was great. I think that the paste can be applied quite thick to the salmon and can probably sit for 30-40 minutes before cooking. The vegetable were rather lack luster for me. I think that adding some herbs de Province or perhaps even some garlic cloves might give the vegetables a more distinctive personality. This preparation for the salmon would be great over a fettucini with a light alfredo sauce.

Fantastic combination! I made this last night - a bit revised for only three salmon fillets - and was amazed to see how well the rosemary complimented the fish and vegetables. I had been worried, as the uncooked paste was quite strong, but some time in the oven and the flavours mellowed out. I'm definitely keeping this one on file.
