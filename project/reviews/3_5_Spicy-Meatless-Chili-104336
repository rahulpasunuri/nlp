This is hands down the best - and easiest - veggie chili that I've ever made. I had to substitute garlic & olive oil tomatoes for the Mexican ones (not available in Canada) so I added in a bit of chipotle to give some more kick. Even my meat eating 70+ year old father liked it. One important note is that it makes far more than 2 servings - I'd say 4 at least.

I made this sans cheese and with a packet of medium-hotness chili seasoning since I was out of chili powder. It was delicious. I love high-protein, low-fat dishes and this one was certainly tasty. If you like processed soy protein and you like the Yves prepared dishes, you'll probably love this recipe. It was perfect with slices of sourdough bread, and I stirred in some small curd cottage cheese to make it even heartier (and cool it down!). It's a great cold-weather dish that comes together in minutes.

this is a really good, very easy recipe. the only changes I made: didn't use stewed tomatoes - just used regular diced. I used the mexican version of veggie crumbles (from yves) and also added diced red and green peppers to the onions. I'll definitely make this again.

This is the best vegetarian chili recipe I've come across...even the meat eaters in the family like it! I like to tweek it a bit. I use Frieda's brand soy taco meat, Rotel tomatoes, add chopped garlic, chopped jalepenos, some corn, black and kidney beans and add chopped cilantro at the end. It jazzes it up!! It's good served over rice. Along with the cheese, add some chopped avocado and dollop of sour cream on top. A meal in a bowl! great on a cool night in Texas!

It might be ok for some tastes, but I would not call this a spicy chile by any standards. It lacks body as well as true taste.

try browning the veggie crumbles in garlic and onion before adding it to the rest of the stuff... it asdds flavor and gives it a better, less chewy texture.

A great basic recipe for chili - I had never made chili before, and had read several so-called simple recipes calling for an outrageous ammount of prep work. This recipe is painless, just combine the ingredients and let it go. I have successfully made veggie, turkey and beef version of this recipe (browning the meat first with the onion and the chili powder)--which is much better after several hours of simmering. Add more chili, some cumin, and some hot pepper.

I would add green bell pepper to this dish. I followed posted advice and added more chili powder, bay leaf. I also added chopped garlic with the onions. Definitely lots better the day after!

The easiest and best chili I have ever made. I did take other reviewers' advice and added a bit of cumin seed and some canned jalapenos for heat. Fabulous.

This chili was a little bland. I was disappointed with the veggie crumbles. They had an odd, chewy texture with little flavor.

Absolutely wonderful- even my doubting boyfriend loved it.

Who would believe that a dish so simple and quick to make would taste so good? I followed suggestion of adding cumin and used diced tomatoes with jalapenos. yum!

I entered this chili in my company's chili cookoff. Not only did it win in the best vegetarian chili category, it was unofficially acknowledged as the best chili overall. I followed the recipe and only doctored it up a little with cumin, extra chili powder, and a bay leaf. Oh, I also let it simmer in the crock pot overnight so the flavors could blend. A definite keeper!!

I make this chili all the time. I almost always alter it a little adding a small can of diced green chili and using the diced tomatoes with the green chili in it. I also let it cook for a much longer time, up to an hour sometimes. The beans start to break up and it makes a nice thick sauce.

This is the best vegetarian chili I've ever had. It didn't have the sweetness that sometimes accompanies vegetarian chilis. It was quick and easy. Everyone enjoyed it. I will totally make it again!

I really liked this recipe. It is quick and surprisingly good (surprising for me because I had never had the veggie crumbles before, and wasn't quite sure what to expect). The texture of the crumbles I used was a bit odd, somewhat spongy, but not unpleasant. This recipe is a good choice when you are looking for a fast and easy vegetarian meal.

Don't be afraid to try this recipie. It is VERY fast, super healthy, and quite good...with a couple additions. I added some dry mustard, cumin (off course, it's chili), a little oregano, and more chili powder. Topped with some shredded cheddar cheese and green onions, it was a nice surprise! Super way to get some soy in your diet.
