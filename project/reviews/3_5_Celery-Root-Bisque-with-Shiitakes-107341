AMAZING! The shiitakes and the black butter sauce give the soup an amazing finishing touch and the mixture of the textures makes it a wonderful conbination... A new favorite in my repertoire!

This is an incredible wonderful soup! Definitely a new favorite for me and my husband. We plan to serve it at Thanksgiving this year. Unlike many of the other reviewers, I stuck to the recipe and simply used water instead of stock. By just adding a little salt and a lot of pepper (to spice it up a bit), the soup tasted great and fatty/salty stocks are not needed. Also, the soup was so creamy and wonderful after I pureed it that the cream definitely wasn't needed. If any of you are thinking of making this soup, please don't skip the sauted shiitakes and brown butter...what an amazing finish to the soup!

This is a family favourite. I don't use chicken broth, but I don't use plain water, either. I make a stock with the peelings of the celeriac, mushroom stems, a chopped onion. I also sweat the shallots, celeriac & celery, and develop a bit of a fond on the bottom of the pot. I strain the stock through a coffee filter before adding it to the sweated veg. That extra hit of celery stock really intensifies the flavour. I don't use the cream, lemon juice, or lots of salt. Usually use more mushrooms, but that's it.

Excellent. Added a pinch of nutmeg, and skipped the cream and lemon juice because the soup didn't need them. Had a more generous helping of the shiitakes that the recipe suggests. Very satisfying, and a great combination of flavours.

New Years Eve dinner party guests loved this starter! Used regular button mushrooms and they loved it. Also used chicken broth over water. Will make again soon.

Served this in small coffee cups during cocktails before Christmas dinner. Use chicken broth instead of water. Excellent hit.

I loved it! I added a few small potatoes and less cream, very good. I also had it with and without shitakes, both ways great.

I love this soup and so do all of my guests! I add a bulb of fennel to add a really nice, subtle anise flavour. The mushrooms are incredible with the soup, too.

Made this soup recently for the fourth time. Best soup I've every tasted. I've doen it with chicken stock and veggie stock. Great both ways

This got raves from everyone, with and without the shiitake topping (personal taste). I, too, used chicken broth, and added acorn squash cubes for fun & flavor.

I don't even like mushrooms, but my husband does, this was delicious, made it last year & can't wait to do it again!!

Elegant. The shiitake/brown butter thing at the end really makes it. If you're not a big fan of celery soup, don't bother, but otherwise a very nice soup. I used chicken broth instead of water.

I thought this was terriffic, but I do confess to making some changes. Most important, I used a full, rich, homemade chicken stock, and I reduced the amount to 6 cups for a little thicker product. While I was prepping the vegetables, I pre-seasoned my stock by adding some leek greens, a small carrot,(actually, I scrubbed the carrot and then peeled it, using the peel for my stock and the carrot for something else) the stems from the shitakes, the cores from the celery roots-- chunked, a pinch of nutmeg, and some fennel fronds (not stems). I let it simmer for about 30 minutes before I sieved it for my bisque. I added the celery root, etc. to the stock instead of vice versa so I could use the same butter to saute the mushrooms, thus eliminating the fat from the soup itself. I also used alot more salt. 2 tspns for 1/2 gallon of stock was definitely not enough for our tastes. At the last minute before serving, I sirred in a pinch of fresh, finely chopped mint. Awesome. Next time I'm adding fennel, and possibly shrimp.

This is the best celery root bisque recipe I have tried. Excellent taste and easy to make.

This recipe i even went out of my way to Dean and Deluca to get the ingredients. But unfortunately, it wasn't worth all that hassle. I thought it would have been. It smelled great, but tasted bitter. Where it went wrong..i am not quite sure?? Anyhow, sorry..this is one that this chef won't try again...esp. with the picky brother-in-law! He disliked it completely!!!

I made this as the first course of our Thanksgiving dinner this year and it was EXCELLENT! I used fresh ingredients from the farmers' market which is very important to a successful cooking, in my opinion. I oversalted the Shitakes but it was a happy accident- they were a pungent complement to the creamy and subtle bisque.

If there was a "maybe" choice in whether I would make this again, I may have chosen that instead of no. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't great enough to go through the trouble again. We did eat just about all of it. I think vegetarians will appreciate it. If I made it again, I'd think about trying chicken stock instead of water for a little more flavor.

A great dish! Unless you have no taste buds and need to over salt....

pretty bland and uninteresting- needed a LOT of salt. Maybe adding dried shitakes in the beginning would boost flavor? Barely enough mushrooms to garnish 3 servings, let alone 10. Browned butter = best part! I added coriander and one small turnip, which helped a bit, but overall not impressive.

I made this dish as a post Thanksgiving recovery meal. I love salt, so I loaded it up. Served by candle light with a nice bottle of Sauvignon Blanc, it was delicious. Looking forward to tomorrow's leftovers.

Tasted like, well, celery. Not very interesting.

I made this for a Thanksgiving dinner with lots of vegetarians in attendance, and it was a big hit. I forgot to add the cream, and it was still wonderful! I wouldn't change a thing.

I served this at my sister's house for a family birthday dinner and they all liked it, but I thought that it was somewhat bland. I will add more salt next time and perhaps some minced garlic. However, the mushroom part was wonderful and the dish was very pretty - much like you'd get in a trendy restaurant.
