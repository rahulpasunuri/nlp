This cake seemed to rely purely on the appeal of lots of sugar and butter and chocolate, and not on any sort of creative or artful combination of them. It's overly sweet--a single bite made my teeth itch. It didn't even go over that well amongst co-workers, who are typically undiscriminating human garbage disposals.

I thought this was wonderful, and not too difficult. And quick enough, if you're good at multi-tasking. I brought it to work for a co-worker's birthday and heaped fresh whole strawberries on top. It was a huge hit!

I brought this in to work and my co-workers loved it. It tastes best if it's been out at room temperature for an hour or so. When assembling, I didn't bother to wait for the caramel to come to room temperature and it worked out just fine. Personally, I don't think this is a cake or candy - I'd call it a torte

I needed a rich and elegant chocolate dessert for a dinner party. This was definitely a chocoholic's dream. I followed the directions exactly, except I doubled the base and used half the genache. For those who like chocolate, they were in heaven. For the rest of us, I made another (and less rich) dessert. Definitely worth keeping the recipe!

Like the cook from Antlanta, I doubled the base portion of the recipe. The resulting product was really tasty. I'm going down on record and calling it a "cake", not "candy."

At the risk of entering a semantic war, I would DEFINITELY call this "candy" in the sense that it sure ain't a "cake" -- the description below is quite accurate. That being said, boy howdy, my husband LOVED this! Every day he would announce, "I'm going to have a slice of candy now." Call it what you like, if you're a chocolate and caramel fan, this will be right up your street. BTW, I used a strongly flavored organic honey in the caramel, and it added a wonderful extra zip to it.

I made this for Father's Day and it was a big hit. The only thing is I would double the base recipe and cut in half the ganache part.

I OWN A BAKERY AND I HAVE MADE THIS FOR MANY,MANY OF MY CUSTOMERS. THEY KEEP ASKING FOR IT-SO IT'S DEFINITELY A KEEPER. I DO ADD DIFFERENT FLAVORINGS-DEPENDING ON WHAT THE CUSTOMER WANTS. I DO DISAGREE WITH THE REVIEWER WHO CALLED THIS CANDY! PLEASE DO NOT CALL GANACHE-CANDY! IF IT'S MADE THE RIGHT WAY-IT'S A GOURMET DELICACY! CANDY IS WHAT YOU FIND DOWN AT THE GROCERY STORE.

Watch out - if you make this cake, you can expect to add an inch or so to your waistline! It's hard to stop at just one slice! I do make a few changes: I double the base recipe so that it is a bit thicker. I also cook the filling a little longer than the recipe suggests so that it is a little less runny. The best part is that this dessert is deceptively simple to make - no one will ever believe how easy it is!

This was rich and beautiful...The addition of the rasberry sauce really compliments the dessert.

This is a very dense and rich dessert -- more of a pie than a cake. Definitely use a fine chocolate -- it makes all the difference.

A chef in IN, I made this cake at work for are grand dessert table after my first attempt i found that the carmel sauce gets to hard after chilling so i poured on top of cake while it was still hot. After doing so this turned out even better.

the cake was terrific, however it had more of a "turtle" texture than a "truffle" texture, with the caramel/nut center.

This is the riches chocolate desert I have ever had. My husband is a chocoholic and loves it.
