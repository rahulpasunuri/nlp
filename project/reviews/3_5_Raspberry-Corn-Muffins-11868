I thought these were great! I substituted whole wheat flour for the regular all-purpose and added just a bit more yogurt (I used plain fat-free Greek yogurt). Delicious, not too dense at all. I also added a bit more raspberries like some other reviewers, but probably wouldn't next time. I'd probably chop up the raspberries a bit, also. Worth trying!

make with white cornmeal for a pretty presentation

These were pretty good but rely a lot on the quality of the raspberries. I would grate the zest finely and mix it with the sugar, my food processor did not do an adequate job. I subbed cornmeal for 1/4cup of the flour. I used a little less sugar since I eat these with jam, otherwise the whole amount of sugar would be better.

I made these muffins EXACTLY as the recipe is written and they were absolutely perfectly delicious! An EASY recipe I'll make again!

It's only cornbread, so I couldn't give it 4 forks, but it is tasty and easy. I used about 2 cups frozen blueberries instead of raspberries, used cornmeal because I like the grittiness, and baked it all in a buttered cast iron skillet to give it a nice crust. This all worked out great, but required about a 30 minute baking time. My boyfriend, who claims to not like cornbread, said it was the best cornbread ever and concluded that he's never actually had good cornbread before this.

I whipped up a batch of these muffins this afternoon in an effort to use up my fresh raspberries. I baked the entire batch in a 9-inch cast iron skillet. I really love the crust I get on my corn bread made this way. I also used 2 cups of raspberries simply because I had them. My entire family really enjoyed this cake. We will certainly be making it again. As a funny side note we had two brothers visiting us today. They thought I had fed them poison they disliked it so much. It was their first time tasting cornmeal...didn't go over well. We loved it!

Awesome! I did not have muffin tins so used a 4 mini loaf pan. The recipe amount was just right to fill all 4. Raspberries are ripe at our house now, I doubled the amount of berries to 2 cups. Everything else I did as written. Husband raved about this one! We did not think it "dense", maybe because of the added berries. Can't wait to make some with blue berries once the raspberries are gone!

Fabulous! I'm too lazy to make muffins, so I just pour the whole recipe into a skillet and bake a big corncake! Works really well with finely ground corn flour, not meal; that takes care of any grittiness.

Quick, easy and delicious! They looked beautiful, too. I used a heaping cup of blueberries in place of the raspberries. My family loved them. Be advised, though: the texture is denser and more cornbread-y than you may be expecting.

These were super quick & yummy. My favorite raspberry muffins are from a bakery nearby and they have a little almond taste to them, so I added 1/4 t. almond extract to my batch. It was a perfect addition and I highly recommend it. Next time I make them, I'll try to make them in advance and pop them into the fridge for a little while/overnight before baking them. It makes most corn muffins puff up beautifully.

The bonus for this recipe is that it is rather foolproof. I accidentally left them in the oven an extra 10 minutes, and they came out just fine! Unfortunately, the end product just doesn't pack a lot of punch. Perhaps the texture of the raspberries and the texture of the corn meal is just too much grit. For the record, I used 1/4 cup yogurt and 1 cup sour cream, as that's what I had on hand, and baked using muffin cups, which may explain why these babies didn't burn!

This recipe is fast and easy to make. My 18-month-old loves these things. It also works with frozen raspberries, but is far better with fresh ones.

I'm not sure what went wrong, I followed directions completely, but they came out a little dense and the yogurt flavor was quite overpowering. I prefer the Blueberry lemon corn muffins on this site.

I really liked this recipe. They are not too sweet, are rich tasting and the berries complement the muffin flavour. I used stone ground white cornmeal and added frozen berries to the dry ingrediants as suggested by the previous reviewer. These will definitely go into my favourites.

Excellent with Blueberries. Made this recipe with frozen wild blueberries - mixed them into the dry ingredients before adding the wet ingredients.

Hmm... not so great. Well they were okay, but I wanted sweet fluffy corn muffins. These were more corn-bready, not muffiny.

Yum!I have 1/3 C muffin pan, made 16 muffins and baked for 16 minutes.

Tasty. Make these only if you like the texture of cornbread. A healthy choice that's kid friendly. I used alot of blackberries and they were very good.

Absolutely Fantastic! Perfect Texture! Moist! I added peach slices instead of rasberries for the other six for fun. It's a keeper.

My kids cannot stop eating these - quick, pretty healthy, any kind of berry is a hit. Would recommend to any time stressed cook looking for home made snacks.

I have to admit that the recipe didn't sound all that appealing to me but I had raspberries on hand and I love corn bread sooooo... These were absolutely fantastic! Even my picky son loved them! I made them in a mini loaf pan that makes 8 and put exactly 1/2 cup of the mixture in each one and they came out absolutely perfect and scrumptious! Will definitely make this again and again! (Didn't have to worry about leftovers... there were none!)

Different and easy - nice because they are not too sweet. I used frozen berries - just let them thaw on a cookie sheet before adding to the batter.

Very good recipe. I agree that they don't store well, though - because of the berries. I was surprised they were good because I don't like recipes that call for yogurt, but you wouldn't even know they had yogurt.

I used whole wheat flour, non-fat yogurt and substistuted egg white for one of the eggs and added more berries. They turned out tasty!

Excellent. They don't store well, though, for more than a couple days, and as I live alone I halve the recipe. Still I usually give a couple away, always to rave reviews.

We liked these muffins - nice tart raspberry taste. I substituted 1 1/4 cups of buttermilk for the yogurt and they tasted good but were flat topped. I guess I should have decreased the milk -next time I'll get it right!

I made these as mini-muffins and they were a huge hit. The raspberries keep the muffins moist and the cornmeal a nice change. I will definately make these again.

Moist and summery, a great recipe. Followed the previous user's advice and mounded the batter in the cups,which worked very well. Definitely a keeper!

I made these muffins for a summer brunch, using frozen raspberries I had on hand. They were just mildly sweet with delicious soft warm berry bites. They were a big hit. I'd make them again for other warm weather events and maybe add walnuts chopped small for some added crunch.

This is a very tasty recipe. The muffins are super moist, and pretty. They don't really rise well, so I tend to heap the batter into the tins so they are quite full.

The combination of yellow cornmeal (I used the coarse stoneground variety) and fresh raspberries is wonderful. A nice change from the regular blueberry muffin.
