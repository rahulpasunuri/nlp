You can make your own dulce de leche by pouring the condensed milk into canning jars and then submerging them in simmering water. That way you can check to see how dark the dulce is getting whereas in a can, you can't. Plus you don't have to worry about the canning jars exploding. I also make it in my crock pot cooking the jars for 8-9 hours.

Yummy! I've made this numerous times and have loved it every time. I like to add banana on top of the crepes too for an added touch and give it a bit of freshness (It is VERY rich, well when you put as much sauce on as me ;) I've also made the delicious sauce just to put on top of ice cream when i have no time for crepes! Love it!

Yum . . . I thought these were lovely! And a word about making your own dulche de leche by boiling cans of condensed milk--as long as you make absolutely sure that the cans are completely and sufficiently covered in water the entire time they're boiling they shouldn't explode. I wouldn't recommend letting kids try it on their own, but I've made it a few times this way (first tried it when making banoffi pie--you can find the full instructions for making the dulche de leche by googling the recipe) and have never had any problems. Don't try it without first reading the full instructions!

So delicious! I always get people begging for more when I make these. Its a great crepes recipe in general, so I often make extra crepes and do up a batch of blintzes afterwards (these freese really well). The icecream is a must, and an easy way to cut down time if necessary is to just heat up some of the caramel that you can buy in the ice-cream section in a jar (or if the nutella is too hard to find). This is a definite must try. SO GOOD!!

Simple, elegant, wonderful dessert. Can make everything ahead of time and assemble just before serving for a dinner party. I think next time I'll try wrapping the crepes around a scoop of ice cream. THanks for the warning - I almost tried the boiling condensed milk thing and wondered why it wouldn't explode! I found a nice simple recipe for dulce de leche sauce elsewhere on this site (made to accompany a cheesecake) which I used.

This is an easy recipe that produces great, gourmet results. However, I would caution all cooks to avoid the last reviewer's suggestion to make your own dulce de leche by boiling a closed can of condensed milk. It's extremely dangerous-a 13-year-old in my hometown got 3rd-degree burns on her face and chest when she tried it and the can exploded. Cook (and share advice) responsibly!

I make dulce de leche by boiling a can of condensed milk, the closed can submerged in boiling water, for at least an hour. Allow to cool before opening. This makes more dulce de leche than this recipe needs, but eating it straight with a spoon is addicting! Or it can be saved for making the recipe a few times.

I didn't make the dulce de leche sauce, but followed the crepe recipe. It turned out really, really good for the first time. The crepes came out crispy on the edges, just the way I wanted, and I served them with ice cream and strawberry preserves.

This is an authentic rendition of a favorite dessert sampled (frequently) in a little restaurant-La Hacienda de Ixtapa- in Ixtapa, Mexico. There it was known as "crepas con cajeta"; anywhere else, it should be known as pure heaven!

Very tasty with wonderful textures and flavors. However this is a very heavy and indulgent dessert. If you're on a diet don't try this one.

Very easy and kids love them with Nutella!
