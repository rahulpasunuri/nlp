Not bad, but also nothing to write home about. The texture of the cake was a bit coarse. The chocolate flavor was nicely strong but it lacked real depth or complexity. I don't know - for the amount of bother I have other recipes I liked better.

I changed around the recipe by reducing the sugar on both cake and frosting by half, and mixing in heavy cream to whip along with the frosting for a less sugary taste and better 'spreadability'. the result was fabulous~i also topped with strawberries.

Was the instruction at the top of the second paragraph supposed to be "sift" instead of "whisk"? It seemed a little strange to me when it told me to whisk the dry ingredients. The cake did come out tasting a little too floury to me. Otherwise it was light and fluffy, albeit a little low on the flavor end of things, due to its flouriness. I can't attest to the chocolate icing because I didn't make it. Perhaps it would make it better? But, alas, I'm out of cream cheese, so maybe later? I used Fry's cocoa, probably the best cocoa to use in this neck of the woods . . .

Decided to make cupcakes instead. The batter produced 18 cupcakes which I bakes for 15 minutes and they were done perfectly. Followed frosting recipe for full amount and was able to generously frost cakes. I like cream cheese frostings, but didn't get much care for this one. Cake was good, very chocalatey, not dry. All in all this recipe was ok.

Loved the frosting (cream cheese all the way) although i always tend to substitute low-fat cream cheese with no problem. The cake was quite good, but not fabulous, I would probably keep searching rather than make the same one again - it was flavourful and moist, but somehow too heavy without being justifiably chocolate-rich and decadent.

The frosting was tremendous, but the cake itself came out dry and coarse, and there needed to be another layer; it looked skimpy. I'd definitely recommend the frosting though!

I would make this cake again but I will try doubling the recipe to make a more presentable cake. It was very tasty and went well with the frosting. Also I recommend baking about 10 minutes longer.

Extremely rich and decadent. Not an incredibly easy recipe, but worth it for something special.

I was expecting the cake to be slightly more moist than it turned out. The frosting couldn't have been more of a success! I ran out of UNsweetened cocoa, so I substituted with sweet cocoa; I'm glad I did! I will, however, be trying out another recipe for cake the next time I have a request for Devil's Food Cake.

Excellent chocolate flavour, very tender and moist. I like the fact that it uses cocoa. My only quibble is that 20 minutes is nowhere near long enough for the layers. It would be closer to 30 minutes.

love this cake for a not-too-sweet chocolate moment. used soy milk (lactose intolerant) and it worked just as well. love the low egg/no butter ingredients.

Maybe I did something wrong, but I just don't think this cake was any better than we've had from a box mix.

Fantastic and easy to make. Wasn't overly sweet and the mayo in the cake & cream cheese in the frosting gave the cake a great tang! I made this cake for my father-in-law's 63rd birthday. He was thrilled at the effort I put into a cake made from "scratch" for him as he was used to getting "box cakes". AND IT WS SO EASY!! I've already been nominated to make the cake for his 64th!!!

My 10-yr. old son wanted a chocolate cake for his birthday. I was concerned that he wouldn't like the cream cheese frosting. It was a hit! He loved it along with our guests at his dinner party.

The combination of the buttermilk and mayonnaise made it supper moist. Whenever I want chocolate cake, this is the recipe I will use from now on. No need to experiment with other recipies. Took two pieces of this cake to friends and accidentally sat on them as got into car BUT they raved about the taste, moisture and the frosting and it had nothing to do with my sitting on it.

A delicious and moist chocolate cake that travels well. I made this for friends, and they raved about it - one of them said it was the best chocolate cake she'd ever had. The cream cheese in the frosting gives it a wonderful (and addictive!) tang. Both the frosting and the cake were easy to make.

I made this cake for a birthday celebration and what a hit. Everyone raved about it. The cake was so very moist and the frosting was chocolate cream cheese. An absolute dream!
