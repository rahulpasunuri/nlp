If we could give half-stars, this would be a 2 1/2. I made the recipe as written, using the best curry powder I could find. I thought the flavor was quite good (though a little ginger certainly wouldn't hurt), but the color was downright ugly. It's good enough for everyday meals, but you wouldn't serve it to guests or anyone who's very picky about presentation.

I would've rated this higher if not for all the doctoring up. I used about half the suggested amount of broth since I prefer a thicker soup. I roasted the cauliflower with some cloves of garlic. Omitted the sugar and mint but added fresh ginger. I also added fresh spinach but it gave the final pureed soup a weird color-- but I do think it added a nice flavor. Maybe next time I'd stir the spinach into the soup after pureeing. Overall a decent soup and I agree with others that the ginger really adds something nice!

This soup is good, but not great. The flavor was rather bland so the other reviewers have the right idea about adding additional ingredients (I followed the recipe exactly as written). Also, I prefer a thicker soup. All this being said, this is a good soup for starters but it needs to be tweaked.

Method is important in this recipe. Keep yogurt cold. Add one spoonful/dollup of yogurt, swirling out edges. Cold/hot contrast is nice.

this recipe is a great starting point. very quick and easy. i decided to add many more things b/c i had more time and felt like experimenting. these are my additions: chopped fresh ginger, chopped fresh garlic, frozen peas, more onion, crushed dried red pepper, garamasala, ground cumin, ground coriander, ground cinnamon, cayenne pepper powder and a container of FAGE greek yogurt. i don't know how much i put in.... just kept tweaking until i liked how it tasted. i didn't follow the suggested ratio of ingredients in the recipe b/c i wanted to make a lot of soup, so i had b/t 4-5 cups of potatoes to start.

Added about 1/2 tsp of salt and 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of Garam Masala to recipe. Also rather than puree all the soup I only did about a 1/3 of the batch and poured it back into the soup. I prefer a chunkier soup and the puree made it creamier. I used "Indian Curry" in my recipe rather than a typical off the shelf curry powder (durkee)...not sure where I got it but it had a little more kick than regular I think. Yummy soup!

This was really tasty!I used Jamaican curry, a touch of tamarind, some garam Marsla, a little old bay and a splash of picapeppa. Totally delicious!!

While it's simmering the house smells delicious. It needs lots of kosher salt, pepper and crushed chili peppers- maybe even garlic too. As it is, it's lacking spices. If you play around with it, it is very good- not delicious!

Wonderful mild curry flavour. The only changes I made was to add some chopped celery (about 1 rib) and some light cream after blending. Would be easy to kick up the spice if desired.

I would rate this 2.5 stars--meaning it was good to have on a cold night, but not anything I'd serve during a dinner party. I sauteed ginger, jalepeno, and garlic along with the onion. I also added a shredded tart apple to give the soup a tangy/sweet taste. I served with cilantro in place of the mint.

I did not have enough cauliflower, so I added broccoli to get the 8 cups. Also kept the skins on the potatoes for added health benefit. Turned out just fine.

The yogurt and fresh mint garnish make this soup. If you want to skip that then make the Cauliflower Soup with Truffle Oil on this site it's great even without the garnish. I thought this lacked flavor (even with salty broth and doubled curry powder) until I added the garnish and then it was really unique and boldly flavored.

Very easy and quick to make - perfect meal for a weeknight in the winter. I added a diced sweet potato for color and flavor (and added thickness) and used extra spicy curry as I like my dishes to have a little kick.

I just made this and it is delicious. I used sweet potatoes and added a handful of carrots (about 1 cup) and it turned out very well. I cut the amount of sugar in half as well as the salt because chicken broth tends to be quite salty.

I thought this was good. The strength of your curry powder is probably very influential - I ended up adding more curry plus some garam masala at the end to bring up the flavor - plus more salt. But once you tinker with the seasonings, it is great. A stick blender makes this a very easy soup.

I was surprised at how boring this was. Maybe I needed zingier curry.

This is the first Epicurious recipe for which I've given only one fork. I followed the recipe exactly, except for using a hand blender instead of a processor, and I found it to be very bland, and lacking something significant, though I can't decide what. My four children who love my homemade dishes agreed it was bland.

Yummy - healthy, easy and tasty - what more can I ask for. Will make again soon.

I found myself without curry powder so used Tandori spice mix (from Penzy's) instead. Also used Splenda instead of sugar. It was delicious!

We found this recipe to be quite delicious. The subtle flavour of the curry masks the sometimes strong flavour of cauliflower. I did not have plain yogurt on hand so served with a swirl of whole cream and a mint sprig.This received compliments from my husband who is a chef. I will be making this again in the future.

This turned out great - I served it at a Mother's Day Brunch and it was a big hit. I did boil the cauliflower separately but ended up using the cooking water to have enough liquid to blend with and it turned out fabulously. It was easy and delicious and I'll be making it often. I used a stick blender which worked well.

Quick, healthy, fantastic. I was a bit worried after reading the review about the cauliflower having a bad taste and texture. However, after I pureed mine (just added garlic with onions but otherwise followed the recipe) the consistency was incredibly creamy...just like hollandaise sauce. I prefer to add a bit of heavy cream at the end or a drop of sour cream. I will make it again and again.

made this according to the directions using hot curry but as my friend and i looked at it before serving, a mad thought came over us and we stirred in some half and half. it was amazing! you lose the healthy part when you do it this way, but my guests raved about it and ignored the other soups. and isn't that what counts?

I was so tempted by this recipe because I liked all of the ingredients, but found that when cauliflower is pureed it has a simply miserable texture and taste. When I told my boyfriend's grandmother (who is French, and makes potages to die for) about the disaster, she said that if she ever uses cauliflower in soup, she always drains the water after cooking it, and adds fresh water before continuing. Otherwise, the bitter water contaminates the flavor. I won't bother to try her method with this recipe though. The recipe isn't worth a second try, even with modifications.

Very quick and easy. To kick it up a bit, I added a tsp each of fresh ginger and garlic during onion cooking. I then used 5 tsp of hot curry powder (instead of 4). At the end it needed quite a bit of kosher salt and 1 tsp of white pepper to bring out the curry flavor. Delicious and my husband and 7-year-old agree!!

I thought this was SUPER easy and very good. I added carrots as suggested and extra curry powder. After pureeing I added more cauliflower, potatoes and carrots...yum, perfect for our frigid New England winter!

Very easy and great tasting, although our family prefers thicker soup (I followed the recipe exactly, and had to remove 2 cups of broth before pureeing it to get the consistency we like.)Every one liked this! I would increase the amount of potato or decrease the liquid next time I make this.

Great tasting soup that is easy to make. I also added two carrots, as was suggested by others reviewing this recipe.

Something different than the old meat and potatoes, I thought it was great and so did the people I shared it with at work the next day! I used jalfrezi curry and it was perfect! I'm going to try it again with garam masala curry. For those of you that don't know, there are several formulas of curry powder, great fun to experiment!

Not enough curry, not enough flavor. I added hot oil to perk it up and even then it wasn't much of anything. I love curried califlower but this isnt' the taste you get.

Bleaugh! This was the WORST. I agree with Dayton Ohio, that it was a waste of time and effort though I'd add, too, a waste of money. I followed the recipe exactly. It will now coat my garbage disposal rather than our tummies on a cold February night. Not sure what the other folks rating this were eating, but I'm certain it wasn't what was cooked up in my kitchen.

This soup was so easy and so good. I whipped it up after work one night without a thought and it was delicious. I added a touch more sugar. I thought the mint added a lot.

If you like curry, you'll love this soup. I added a couple carrots and 1 tbsp. garlic when I cooked the onion. Also added an extra 1/2 head of cauliflower and only pureed half of the soup. Served it with french bread and a salad with walnut raspberry vinegrette dressing. Excellent!!

While my husband loved this recipe I thought it was too strong. I used a curry powder from India and it was to bitter and hot for my tastes. I did add a little more sugar than the recipe said to help balance it a little. definitly the type of curry you use will make or break the recipe. The yogurt and mint at the end are definitely needed.

My family is not a big fan of cauliflower or curry, so I substituted them with chicken pieces and noodles. I didn't use any potatoes or yogurt, and I don't have a blender. For color, I added some diced carrots, and some celery. All in all, this was an excellent cauliflower soup!

This soup was delicious - so easy, I had it simmering in 20 minutes! I added some extra vegetables (broccoli, carrots) I had in the fridge, and used my hand blender to puree it right in the pot. I might add another potato next time for a thicker consistency. A great winter comfort soup for a crowd - it makes tons!

This soup was delicious! I added three cloves of garlic when I sauteed the onions and my potato weighed about 18 oz which made the soup quite thick which I liked. The quality of curry will also make a difference...I use Sharwoods. A very comforting soup.

I made this last night and it is so good and surprisingly easy!! I didn't puree the last cup and 1/2 to give it more texture - so there were some cauliflower and potato chunks in the soup. You can probably also substitute veggie broth for chicken broth to make vegetarian. (I couldn't find low salt chicken broth so I used regular chicken broth, which added a nice flavor - and I didn't need to add any extra salt.) Also, I used small red creamer pototoes instead of Yukon, which added nice red flecks to the soup. The red potatoes cook faster than the Yukons though, so I let the cauliflower cook for 10 mins before adding the potatoes.

i haven't tried it; sounds good. but i would blenderize maybe half of the vegetables, and leave the rest whole.

This is a great recipe - so simple that you can't believe it will be this good. I used a stick blender, which I think is more efficient than batching into a blender.
