I did as a lot of other people said and added a bit extra flour and it was perfect. I was expecting the cookies to flatten a bit more than they did. I did a bunch of really really tiny ones and they're great. For the frosting, I added a splash of vanilla and substituted a bit of the honey for a pinch of confectioner's sugar and it turned out better than I expected. Ended up doubling the recipe and ate them ALL.

Holy cow. These are killer. Made em just like written. They did spread a bit on the pan. In future I will make smaller and space them even further on the pan. Killer.

WOW... amazing cookies. I followed others advice and upped the flour to 1 1/2 cup, mixed whole wheat and white flour. I also upped to 3/4 tsp. baking soda. Used maple syrup instead of honey. Used cranberries instead of raisins. These are to die for!

These cookies were divine! I had no troubles with the consistency, but the measured out cookies turned out a little on the big side. Maybe just one tablespoon (no joke!). The icing would NOT thicken, so I had to add a lot more creamcheese, but it ended up alright.

This recipe was...alright. Not the best carrot cake cookies I've had. I agree that the consistency of these (very sticky, crumbly, cake-like) would make better muffins. I also wasn't thrilled by the flavor; for being so cake-like, they could have been much denser and richer. A couple things: mine did not brown very much (didn't look like the picture), and I even used dark brown sugar instead of light. Also, they are not stackable and will stick to other cookies and fall apart easily. I baked for 12:30 and they seemed to be getting too brown around the edges - probably could have left them in a little longer, so don't let this browning deceive you! I substituted pumpkin pie spice for half of the cinnamon (delicious, and I added extra) and used a regular cream cheese frosting with maple flavor added in - I think without the sweetness of regular cream cheese frosting these would have been even blander. Overall: liked the idea, loved my version of the frosting, but will probably find a new cookie recipe for next time. Perhaps adding in another egg and some rolled oats would help them stay together better...

Truly exceptional! And so much less intimidating than a three layer carrot cake. I do take the traditional route with the cream cheese frosting, however, and add powdered sugar. But, to make up for it, I use 100% whole wheat flour in the cookies.

Rating: 4
Fantastic! Everyone in my family loved them. The cream cheese and honey frosting was incredibly easy and balanced out the sweetness of the cookie so well. The cookies were nice and soft but with such great texture, I would be afraid to leave anything out! I accidentally made the cookies too big, so instead of sandwiching them, I iced each one individually and refrigerated them immediately to keep the icing from sliding off. They were fine that way, but the sandwich cookies look much cuter so I'll definitely be more careful portioning out the cookie dough next time.

I love this recipe. I substituted 1 tsp of baking powder for the baking soda because I prefer my cookies chewy. I also blanched the shredded carrots for one minute to soften them up and soaked the raisins in boiling water.

Rating: 4
These are fantastic. Followed the recipe and the sweetness was just right both in the cookie and the filling. The one thing I did extra was to flatten them slightly into patties before baking so they would have less of a dome in the center. The method said to beat the butter, sugars, eggs and vanilla all in one step. My instinct told me not to do this but to whip the butter and sugar first the way you would in any cookie or cake recipe. But I followed the directions and of course the wetness prevented much air from being whipped in. I was concerned at how flat the mixture was, but the cookies turned out fine. I think I'll still do it the proper way next time and whip the butter first. Read More http://www.epicurious.com:80/recipes/food/review/preview/Inside-Out-Carrot-Cake-Cookies-109346#ixzz1ryxw5ERe

I gave this recipe one fork but it should have received negative 4 forks. Seriously this cookie is abysmal. They didn't rise at all and I got a huge SHEET of flat dough like texture. I know what you're thinking... "you changed the recipe." NOPE. followed it to a t-.... baked the cookies for said amount of time. HORRIBLE!!! If I were to try this cookie again.... I would add more flour and more baking soda where the dern things would have consistency. STAY AWAY!

Perfect and delicious. We used parchment instead of buttering the sheet and cooked one sheet at a time. Don't mess with that cream cheese filling. Tis a gift to be simple.

Rating: 4
Yum! Although, I had to do a little trial and error with these to keep the edges from burning. I found that using parchment rather than greasing the cookie sheet helped, as did baking one sheet at a time first on the bottom, then on the top rack, rather than two at once (which is what the recipe has you do). I used a more traditional cream cheese frosting because I worried that it wouldn't be sweet enough for me as written. I was pleased - the cookies are such un-sweet, lovely spice cakes that to me, the classic cream cheese frosting complemented them well (I used a stick of butter, 8 oz of cream cheese, and 3 cups confectioners' sugar, plus a little grated ginger for zing). These were very good and I'll make again.

Loved these cookies. Wonderful. My daughter loves them. I have to comment and call out reviewer garlic4life who made a tremendous amount of changes to the recipe and then had the gall to give it a bad review??? Come on people, use your noodle, if you change it that much, you are giving your own recipe a bad review.

Rating: 2
These cookies were good but not the best. The cookies were very cake-y but they weren't the usual fluffy cake you're used to eating. It's definitely more on the heavy side with a thicker cookie. The cream cheese frosting is delicious but maybe I'll try finding a different recipe that'll give me a lighter, fluffier version than these. The carrots weren't even soft like they should be but overall, it is a creative recipe to even conjure up in your head!

Rating: 4
Total party favorite! I used dried plums instead of raisins and grated 1/2 of the walnuts in the food processor and rough chopped the other 1/2 of the walnuts. The grated up walnuts gave the cookies a subtle nutty flavor all around. The dried plums were a nice surprise!

Rating: 4
Fantastic and easy to make! A great homey treat that I'll definitely make again for family. A general note-- substitutions and experimenting are fantastic and I do it all the time. But I think it's a bit unfair to give a negative rating to a recipe when the reviewer has made substitutions or otherwise didn't follow the recipe directions. It's like panning a movie after you've gone and spliced out some scenes and replaced the ending, no? I rely pretty heavily on the recipe ratings so it dismays me to see some people using what (to me) seems like flawed criteria.

After reading pages of reviews, I gave this recipe a shot, with some suggested alterations for improvement: used 1 1/3 cup grated carrot, 1/8 tsp ground cloves, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, 1/2 tsp ginger, 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, extra 1/4 cup flour. The cookies held their shape well after dropped onto sheet with a cookie scoop, and baked perfectly in 12 minutes. I made a cream cheese, brown sugar and cinnamon drizzle icing for their tops. The taste was unfortunately underwhelming and bland, the alterations did not save the cookie from it's boring flavor, and I love carrot cake. Won't waste my time with these again.

Wow!! Best cookies ever!! How flavorful and soft/crunchy (a beautiful combination!) they are. I added ginger powder, nutmeg, and ground cloves to the recipe, as well as some lemon zest, but Im sure the original recipe was just as spectacular!

I followed the recipe accurately, hoping for something pleasant but instead found a lacking, oversweetened indulgence I could have lived without. Even with fraiche ginger in the filling, I was hit with an extreme sugar rush, would rather just main-line molasses for such stuff.

This is my second time making these. I again increased the flour to 1 ¼ cup, doubled the cinnamon, omitted the raisins all together and saved the nuts until later. With an abundance of zucchini on hand, made one batch with carrot and one with zucchini (make sure to thoroughly wring out the excess water.) So to immerse my taste buds with varying flavors without over indulging, and because I have multi treats I want to make for Easter this upcoming Sunday I thought to use my mini cupcake pan; testing with 1t vs 2t of batter. In creating the right size, the pan itself is perfect, the 2t of batter however, still resulted in a cake like texture. I, like some of the others here, wanted a true cookie crunch this time and found the 1t of batter is best, baking them until the edges turn golden abt 5-7 mins at 350 achieved that. For added flavor I filled the center with the Lemon Zest Cream Cheese Frosting (on this site) and for presentation sake rolled the sandwiched edges in finely chopped toasted pecans. WARNING!! Bite size but addictive.

Perfect. Make exactly as the recipe says. In between making the icing and the cookies cooling, I put the icing in the fridge and it helped it to firm up.

Rating: 4
Everyone loves these cookies! The only change I made is no walnuts because I'm not a fan of walnuts in cookies but other than that the cookies are great! The one complaint I have is that the cookies are so sticky they never stay intact and always have a piece from another cookie stuck to them so if you're planning on stacking them on top of each other for serving or storing, make sure you use wax paper in between the layers! I know that's recommended for all cookies but I never seem to have that problem with the rest of the cookies I make. They also stick to your fingers when you eat them- but don't let any of this stop you from making the cookies :-)

Rating: 3
Love the idea...simple to make... If they're a little runny either add some oats or flour or stick the batter in the fridge for a bit. I'm wondering if anyone else tried to use fat-free cream cheese and got completely liquid filling? i'm going to have to run to the store for some regular cream cheese and try it again before I make all the cookie sandwiches!

This is good but have to warn if you like sweet you are not going to dig this. It needs to be sweeter, maybe I should have lathered the honey cream cheese frosting. I followed others advice by adding oats and I subsituted almonds for walnuts but it still was a little bland (though never encounterd the runniness). I also added cinnamon and ginger to icing (which liked). I may make it again but try to make it sweeter.

I love these cookies! The recipe only gets 3 forks because I made so many changes. I used 1/2 the amount of salt in the recipe, then substituted Craisins for raisins, pecans for walnuts, and old-fashioned oats for carrots. I also added 3 Tbsp of milk to the batter for moisture. I decided not to use honey in the filling, and used a small amount of brown sugar and vanilla instead. Fantastic!

i have made this recipe numerious times because it is such a hit. always great! many comments say the cookies spread too thin. i have found that if you use a tsp to drop cookies, it is the perfect size and they don't spread too much. they are then perfect size. too big may be too rich, with the cream cheese and all

Rating: 4
This cookie is really, really good. Since I read that there had been much spreading, I added about 1/2 c of oats and about 1/4 increase of shredded carrots. Cookie dough actually needed to be thinned out with milk, and I ended up with a solid dough. I chilled the dough for about 1 hour. The cookies didn't spread out at all, in fact, they retained their entire dome shape throughout cooking and cooking. Flavor was nutty and slightly sweet. Did not make the frosting.

I love the end result... but something is horribly off with the ratio. Ive made these twice now and both times the batter is runny and the cookies spread WAY too thin when cooking. Extra flour saved the day both times.

I doubled the recipe but only used the 1/2 teaspoon of salt called for in the single recipe and still found this to be a *tad* salty (but not too much so). I also omitted the raisins and used only 1 cup of walnuts (and it felt like that was plenty for the size of the cookies.) To keep them from getting too flat during baking I chilled the batter in the refrigerator for about a half hour. I used about a tablespoon plus a half teaspoon of batter per cookie and baked them for about 12 minutes and they came out just right -- not too flat, but not "domed" either. I was able to get 21-22 sandwiches (42- 44 individual cookies). I didn't try the cream cheese and honey concoction that was suggested in the recipe. I used this orange cream cheese frosting recipe: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/foo d/views/Orange-Cream-Cheese-Frosting- 102381 I had plenty of frosting left over after generously filling the sandwiches.

YUMMY! This is a great cookie recipe. i did make a few modifications as per other reviewers: (1) added in some rolled oats (2) didn't use the raisins and (3) added in some almonds. I also a Maple Cream Cheese icing (found on Epi). I would like to make a suggestion to those of you who mentioned that the batter was to runny, adding in the oats helps. Also as with other recipes where the dough is a bit on the runny side if you refrigerate the formed/dropped cookies for a brief period prior to baking you'll have better results. Lastly, for those who had issues with the batter sticking - Parchment paper is a bakers best friend no need to grease! Thanks!

I used pecans instead of walnuts. YUM! 2. I don't like raisins so I replaced them with candied ginger. Double YUM!! Make them smaller and you can have more...Right? Oh! I also used parchment paper instead of greasing the pan to cook them on. delish!

OMG OMG OMG... These are dangerously good. As another reviewer mentioned, they serve the perfect function of making carrot cake portable (as in "portable from your hand to your mouth," 'cause they won't make it any greater distance than that). I can't imagine NOT eating these for breakfast with coffee (though I always managed to devour mine BEFORE the coffee finished brewing)... The only downside is they are very fragile/fluffy and can spread like there's no tomorrow, so if you want a normal sized cookie, be quite conservative in how much batter you place on the baking sheet... Amazing with the Ginger Cream Cheese Icing also on Epicurious...

Rating: 3
I would only give this recipe "3 forks" as it is; they were slightly bland and the cookies came too tall to work well for a sandwich. However, I substituted the orange cream cheese icing from this recipe: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/foo d/views/Carrot-Orange-Cake-with- Cream-Cheese-Frosting-904 , added some orange zest to the batter, and added a tiny bit of milk to the batter as well to make them flatter. Done this way, I won a cookie bake-off and would eagerly rate it with "four forks".

Cookies are delicious. I left out the nuts and raisens and they still turned out just fine...did run a little flat so I like the idea that someone else had by using a cookie cutter to make them more uniform. Think next time I will use a traditional cream cheese icing...this one wasn't overly sweet and I felt it needed just a smidge more sweetness!

I made these as printed substituting reviewer JoyBugaloo's cream cheese frosting suggestion. I also made them small for a children's birthday party (about a half teaspoon drop) and used parchment paper. Taking the cookies carefully off the sheet after they had rested a few minutes out of the oven and transfering them to another plate with parchment paper did the trick to curb any stickyness. The ones that wrinkled a bit I could easily get back into shape while they were still warm. The recipe yielded about 20 mini sandwich cookies or 40 plain cookies. I made the cookies and the cream cheese frosting the night before, and chilled both of them covered (the cookies were stacked in single layers on a big plate seperated by parchment paper to conserve space) and didn't assemble them until 4 hours to party time the next day. I still have people approaching me for this recipe 2 weeks later. Very good cookie taste and texture overall.

Very tasty, but I will not be making again. Half of them stuck to the pan and started breaking apart even though I used buttered non stick pans.

These cookies are one of the best things that have ever happened to me! (Or worst, depending on your perspective! Tee hee.) My good friend first made them for her son's birthday, and then again for a party that I attended this past weekend. They were so good that I had to rush right home and make a batch for myself! Of course, I read all 172 comments first and made a few adjustments to the original recipe. As per many reviewers' advice, I made them a little smaller, about one tablespoon of dough per cookie. I got 33, so that made 16 sandwich cookies, plus one "taster." Also, I omitted the raisins (yuck) and replaced the amount with extra walnuts, upped the cinnamon to a full teaspoon, and chilled the dough ahead of time to prevent too much spreading. (I neither increased the flour nor squeeze-dried my carrots, and the texture of the cookies was PERFECTLY moist!) Oh, and they only needed ten minutes to bake (NOT 12- 14!), baking only one tray at a time on Silpat-lined sheets. Finally, I made my favorite cream cheese frosting instead of the (honeyed) one from the recipe: one 8 oz. package softened cream cheese, 4 T softened butter, one pound of powdered sugar (3 1/2 to 4 cups), 1 teaspoon vanilla, and a good pinch of salt. In sum, I cannot imagine why anyone would want to make a proper carrot cake when you can have these flavorful, cakey cookies with delightfully crispy edges! And SO much less work, too! Also, for anyone far away that loves carrot cake, these cookies freeze, pack, and travel well. My friend mailed them all the way across the country for her son's birthday surprise. (Mailing a whole carrot cake would have been...problematic, to say the least. Ha ha.) MAKE THESE COOKIES! --Gina http://lindseysluscious.blogspot.com

These could potentially be pretty good, but I think I added a bit too much powdered cloves. I read in someone else's review that they had added that but forgot to see how much. I guess a little bit goes a long way. Also I used a local buckwheat honey that had a bit of a strange flavour (I thought, but my fiancé thought it was good). I think I would try these again with a different honey, or possibly just an old fashioned brown sugar cream cheese frosting. Still awesome cookies though. Very different! I tried making a few smaller and a few a bit bigger. Bigger ones are definitely more cakelike, but both work.

I thought 1 1/3 cups of sugar was too much! I've been wanting to try this receipe for the longest time and may have been too anzious. After eating my mistake and not before immediately brushing my teeth, corrected my error by adding to the reamining batter, 2x's more of each ingredient (except for the sugars.) The end result was about 4 doz sandwiches, less the 2Tbls of each sugar from the start had omitted. Not only did I do as some of the others and put 1 1/4 cups of flour and doubled the cinnamon but I used vegetable oil instead of butter. I also used a 2 teaspoon sized measuring spoon that made for the prfect sized cookie. Refergerating the batter makes for no mess and may next time, try rolling the batter into a log with plastic wrap, slice and bake from a frozen state in hopes of a flatter more crisper cookie. Preferring toasted pecans over walnuts, I crushed the nuts to evenly sized bits and added them to the filling (or you can roll the cookie in the nuts after filling the center) to help shore up the oozing over the sides. Next time I might think to use a stiff meringue for less fat. Then again the cream cheese (please, no honey)along with the nuts best compliments the cake and is what makes this cookie really pop. Aside from the obivious differance in appearance, there isn't much of a disguise - cake or this cookie, both are terrific

Rating: 4
These really are THAT good!! I give it 4 forks because I want people to try this recipe, but I have to admit I made some changes per other reviewers advice. I ended up using more flour - 1+1/3 C; I added more spice - nutmeg, cloves, ginger and doubled the cinnamon; did NOT need to wring out the carrots; and made my own cream cheese frosting. Word to the wise, do not sub applesauce for butter, it does not work. I had to redo this part entirely; it does not really work from a chemistry standpoint. These were a hit with the hubby and people at work. Will make again for sure!

These were delicious! Guests at a dinner party devoured them. I followed advice of others and made the cookies smaller--next time I'd make further reduce them to silver dollar size.

Lovely! An enduring favorite. We have served it to hundreds at this point, to incredulous appreciation over this delicious little morsel. It is a treat and its novelty is a plus. I recommend trying to get the cookies as flat as possible to allow for better sandwiching with the cream filling, but otherwise the messiness is adorable.

These were truly decadent! I'd definitely make these again. I didn't really like the flavor of the honey mixed with the cream cheese though - it was a little too sweet. Next time I'll try using less sweetener and maybe try with something like maple syrup or brown/white sugar.

GOOD GOOGLY MOOGLY! I'm not a cookie lover but I proclaim these cookies TO DIE FOR! I more or less stuck to the recipe. The only additions I made were a healthy dousing of ground ginger and a dash of ground gloves because I like my carrot cake "spicy." Also instead of grated carrots I used prewashed, pre-cut matchstick carrots, which I highly recommend. I picked up a small bag from my local grocer, chopped the matchsticks down into finer pieces and voila! No shredding and more importantly, no waiting for freshly shredded carrots to dry out. (I long ago learned nothing ruins a carrot cake like freshly shredded carrots because they tend to be quite damp.) Regarding the cream cheese honey filling, I loved it. It was rich and earthy, not too sweet. I thought it made the cookies taste very special. I would recommend first trying the filling exactly as it is listed in the recipe. Though I do admit I briefly considered whipping up a batch of the typical sugary cream cheese frosting. And after I talked myself out of that, I considered subbing light agave nectar for the honey. I'm so glad I elected to stick with the recipe using honey, cream cheese and nothing else. These two simple ingredients made the perfect filling for these cookies!

These cookies are incredible, and easy to make to your taste. For a bit healthier cookie, I cut the butter in half and used a grated apple (or apple sauce) for the rest. I doubled the cinnamon and used a touch of ginger. I made a simple glaze for the top, which made for a perfect single cookie (instead of a sandwich). I will keep this as a personal favorite.

These are very good and unusual. They definitely need more spice though. I added 1 tsp ginger as well as a bit more cinnamon. Like others, I substituted powdered sugar for the honey. I've already made these twice to rave reviews. At least in my oven, it helps not to bake both sheets at once. Cookies that start off too close to the heat tend to spread too much and become fragile.

These are excellent. They have the moist consistency of carrot cake without all of the work. They are very rich so I would make the dough balls small and cut the baking time so that you have 2" cookie rather than the large ones you get by following the recipe. Also, if you like the cream cheese frosting made with powdered sugar, you'll want to add an extra tablespoon of honey to the cream cheese to get the right amount of sweetness.

These are the best cookies. They're a bit of a pain to make, what with the shredding of the carrots and all. However, they are too good pass up. I make them small and bite sized for easier eating.

Following the advice of others, I chose to use a traditional cream cheese filling, which really complimented the flavors in the cookies. The cookies themselves turned out fabulous. There is a lot of room to make them your own - you could add a little grated zucchini, or use pecans over walnuts. I will definitely be making these again soon!

The last time I made this recipe, I continued to get compliments for 2 months. The only thing I would strongly recommend changing is the frosting. I've made it with the honey, and it is pretty good, but you get the sense it could be much much better. The second time I made it I used a sugar based cream cheese frosting recipe. There are tons on epicurious. Or, Williams-Sonoma has a good cream cheese frosting recipe.

My boyfriend and I made this recipe for Valentine's Day. We followed the recipe to the letter....but the the cookies still came out tasting "odd". We were both baffled and think it might have been the baking soda or maybe some 'bad' cinnamon. Not sure... I think I might try them again though. Oh, and the frosting was just delicious. We actually added some pineapple into the frosting, which added a nice taste and texture.

This is a really adaptable recipe that is healthy and delicious. I have little ones that love this and I adapted it a bit to make it even healthier. I use 1/4 c. veg oil and 1/4 c. apple sauce in place of butter (less crisp but delicious and better for kids) and I sometimes use whole or part whole wheat flour. I don't usually use walnuts but I have used canned crushed pineapple sometimes. I don't always sandwich them, but I sometimes drizzle them with a mixture of icing sugar, maple syrup and a touch of water. Great as a breakfast or snack cookie!

Used half whole wheat flour. Added small can of drained crushed pineapple. Used a regular icing in between instead so they are room temp. safe. Yummy!

A delicious and unique cookie recipe. I made these for this year's annual cookie competition and won! I didn't squeeze the carrots, but would consider doing so in the future, the cookies were extra moist. I substituted classic cream cheese frosting for the filling and omitted the nuts for personal preference. Definitely a keeper!

I have a quick question for anyone out there who can help. Do the cookies need to be refrigerated after a certain point because of the cream cheese filling? I am thinking of doing these for a cookie exchange and do not want to make cookies that need to be refrigerated.

Added a few more spices (1/4 t ginger, 1/8 t nutmeg, 1/8 t cloves), but otherwise perfect. Used the recipe for cream-cheese icing from Triple-Layer Carrot Cake on this site (8 oz. cream cheese, 4 T butter, 1 (not 2) t vanilla, 2 c powdered sugar). Freaking best cookies OR carrot cake I've ever made, and boy have I made a lot.

Fantastic cookies. I wanted to find a way to avoid the sandwiches and icing in order to make these a smaller treat. (Feeding two cookies and icing to my little kids in one sitting would be disaster-sugar high!). So, I skipped the frosting, cut the walnuts down to 1/2 a cup, and added about 3/4 of a cup of white chocolate chips to the batter. I'm not a huge white chocolate fan, but it came out great, the white chocolate chips were a perfect substitute for the icing and the single cookie servings were better for the kiddos...

These were great. Be careful with the carrots - it only took me one carrot to get to 1 cup. I would double the recipe next time. I added some cinnamon to the cream cheese mixture and that helped.

Rating: 4
I made this for a family game night and it was a hit! Very easy to make and just the right amount as they are so rich. I used pecans instead of walnuts--just b/c I picked up the wrong nut at the store. It was great and would probably use pecans again. My cookies cooked in 1/2 the time in my Advantium; it was on the standard oven setting and not speed cook.

Make cookies small. When placing two together you get a lot of cookie. Very good flavor and a nice presentation also.

I loved these cookies and so did the rest of my family. I did tweak it though by adding a bit more flour and I also did not really like the icing with the honey, so next time I will probably omit the honey and go for the powdered sugar like some of the other reviewers did.

I should have made the cookies smaller- 1 tablespoon or less instead of 1 1/2 tablespoons. I used cake flour instead of AP flour- they came out very soft. The cream cheese icing was delicious, of course, but the cookie itself was not that impressive.

Rating: 4
these "cookies" are awesome. I excluded the raisins and walnuts and did wring out half the carrots so it wouldn't be overly soggy. for the frosting i used 1/4 lb cream cheese (4 oz), 1/2 stick of unsalted butter, 1 c. confectioner's sugar, and 1/4 tsp of vanilla. makes a perfect cream cheese frosting that isn't too sweet (great for red velvet cupcakes also). everybody loves these!!

Rating: 3
these were pretty good with the following changes that I made. I finely grated my carrots then put them in a few paper towels and squeezed out the liquid. Also, I did not put butter on my baking pan (the second time that is...) because the first time I did my cookies burnt really bad around the edges. A nice non-stick baking sheet works good. I liked the cream cheese frosting, but I thought the honey gave it an off taste, so I did half honey and 2 tablespoons powered sugar. they were really good.

Rating: 3
Enjoyed this recipe. Would make again but would use a traditional carrot cake frosting/icing for filling instead. Found it to be moist despite what others posted. I cooked for 12 mins. and put a little extra carrot in. Not sure if that had anything to do with it.

The cookies, by themselves, are a little dry and boring. Adding the cream cheese frosting helps, but I prefer to make the frosting with powdered sugar rather than honey. It creates a firmer, denser frosting with a slightly sweeter taste.

Based on some comments, I added a little extra flour and probably should not have. They came out more like muffin tops (puffy) than cookies. I barely sweetened the cream cheese since the cookies were already pretty sweet. Overall good flvor, moistness. Will try again, as the SO really liked them.

What a delicious cookie! I took everyones advice and used 1 1/3 cups of flour instead of 1 1/8 and wrung out the carrots to remove the excess moisture. I deleted the raisins but added 1/3 cup drained and pressed crushed pineapple, 1/3 cup of coconut, and ½ teaspoon nutmeg. I used a tablespoon size ice cream scooper to get uniform cookie sizes and only cooked them for 13 minutes. The edges were a little crispy when I removed them from the oven, but they softened up nicely after about an hour. I only cooked one pan of cookies at a time and kept the extra dough in the freezer while the first batch baked. Onto the icing: I completely changed that and made it a more traditional cream cheese frosting. 1-8oz pkg cream cheese, 2 tablespoons unsalted butter; 2 tablespoons honey; ½ teaspoon vanilla; 1 cup of powered sugar. Cream the cheese, butter, honey and vanilla until fluffy then add the powered sugar. After mixing place icing in refrigerator and allow to firm up before slathering on cookies. Yum.

I made these cookies for a party and they were instantly devoured. The cookies as written are enormous. I reduced each cookie to 1 tbs and they were still big. I'd make them even smaller next time since you are really eating two cookies at once. I also made a traditional icing with cream cheese, butter, confectioners sugar and vanilla. Yum!

Rating: 3
These were very good, but the cookies were not quite as crispy as they should have been to put the texture (and cookie) to a true four-forker. I also thought the filling was a little bland, so I added some fresh lemon and a little powdered sugar to give it more body, along with a splash of vanilla.

Have I already reviewed this? I forget. But this recipe is definitely worth it. The measurements are a pain (I omit the 2x 2 tbsp sugar and just do 2/3 cup total- they're sweet enough). My kids love them. I fill them with just plain cream cheese with powdered sugar and orange peel.

Rating: 4
The first batch didn't harden up as much as I'd hoped when cooled, so went the full 16 min. maybe even a little longer. They were darker (not burned) but more importantly a little sturdier and easier to handle when adding filling and transporting.

I have made these twice. I also made them smaller. I did not like the icing. I added 2/3 cup of confectionary sugar and 1/2 tsp of vanilla. That made it taste more like a traditional carrot cake icing. I also used pecans instead of walnuts. The only thing I did not like about the recipe was the odd measured amounts and switching the cookie sheets during cooking.

Just made these two days ago to assist a co-worker with a fundraiser. Sold out! I too squeezed the carrots and added a little more flour. Also I made the cookies on the smaller side and substituted icing sugar for some of the honey and added some lemon zest in the frosting/filling. Really convincingly like little carrot cakes.

Everybody loved these cookies! They were moist and delicious. The raisins are especially tasty.

These are fantastic - once they've been filled and put in the fridge, they're just baby carrot cakes! I increased the flour to 1 1/4 cups and added a good scrape of nutmeg. Wrung the grated carrots out well and swopped the nuts for 1/2 cup of oats. Oh, and I added sifted icing sugar to the c/cheese to taste instead of the honey!

These are absolutely delicious cookies! I took the excellent advice of earlier reviewers and made sure that my carrots were wrung-out and I added about 1 1/3 cups flour instead of 1 1/8 because instead of raisins, I added about 1/3 cup of very well drained crushed pineapple (blame my raisin-hating children for all the substituting I do). My problem came with the icing: I only added a small dollop of honey and added a bunch of icing sugar (per other reviewers) and my icing turned out to be quite runny. (Cookies were messy, but nonetheless delectable.) Next time I will not use the food processor to mix the icing as I think it may have "liquified" the cream cheese and the end result was icing that was a little too sweet as I kept adding more sugar to try to stiffen it up. Earlier reviewers were also right about these turning out to be very large cookies -- I would only use about 1 level tbsp. of dough per cookie (and those will still be a good size, but far from the manhole covers you get if you follow the recipe). But next time, these will be perfect!

Rating: 3
I thought these cookies were better than carrot cake! That said, I did add a lot of spices to the dough (more cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and mace). I grated some of the carrots coarsely and some more finely to generate a kind of "sauce" (because I was out of eggs!). and they were terrific. Definitely much better with the honey cream cheese. Great cookies!

Rating: 3
these were so yummy!!! i wanted to end up with more, smaller cookies, so i used a heaping teaspoonful for each. i ended up getting 25 'sandwiches' that were about 2 inches in diameter. i couldn't really imagine making them bigger. the cream cheese filling was a must, too. out of the oven they're slightly crisper, but once assembled (and refrigerated) they were soft just like carrot cake.

What a great recipe! I doubled it and used pureed carrot for half of the butter. I also substituted drained pineaple for the nuts and it they still turned out great- not flat at all. The cookies at first seemed just okay but we couldn't stop at one. (addictive!) Then... we sandwiched them with the cream cheese mixture and they were AMAZING!

I am in Canada - my daughter asked me to try this recipe for a cookie swap she will be attending soon. I followed recipe exactly and they turned out A1. I used firm/creamed honey, not the liquid honey. I slightly pressed down the cookies before putting in the oven, and used the air-bake cookie sheets. I really found the comments from everyone very helpful. My carrots were not those nice juicy sweet ones we get in the summer, so weren't too "wet" but after grating I did squeeze them with paper towels. I grated one carrot with the large holes, and one carrot with the small holes in grater. Very nice treats, very different. Thank you!

Since I am vegan I used tofutti cream cheese, left out the egg, and used vegetable margarine instead of butter. I also dislike raisins, so I put in dried apricots instead. These cookies are GREAT!! I have never had much success with vegan cookies, but these got rave reviews from vegans and omnivores alike. I would suggest leaving out the egg so you don't have to drain all that tiresome liquid from the carrots. They are still moist and delicious, with less fat too!

If you're on the fence... MAKE THIS COOKIE!!! It's a wonderful cake/cookie that everyone loves. To answer some of the problems of other cooks: Do up the flour to 1 1/4 C... Do squeeeeeeeze your carrots dry... Do omit the honey and use confectioners sugar or maple syrup... If you find that your cookies do spread... first check your ovens temperature with a thermometer. If you're running too hot they will spread. Also, try chilling your dough before scooping and baking. But make these cookies!

These cookies are great! With the filling they are awesome. Not very carrot-y, but with just enough vegetable love to make you think you're eating something good for you. The nuts and the raisins help, too. The filled sandwiches are really quite tasty. I used vanilla and confectioner's sugar and am quite pleased with the results: all the decadence of carrot cake with creamcheese frosting in a neat little package! I will be making these again. My only complaint is that they've already turned a bit soggy, and it's only been a few hours. I browned the bottoms of the first batch, and the extra crunch was quite nice. Any tips for keeping them crunchier for the duration?

I took the advice of the other reviewers and squeezed any excess liquid out of the carrots. The cookies came out light and fluffy. I also added approx. 1 1/2 tsp of orange zest in with the carrots and substituded toasted pecans for the walnuts. I agree with not using honey to make the frosting, if you don't like confectioners sugar (sometimes it can be too sweet)maple syrup adds a nice dimension to the overall flavor. Will definately make these again.

These were EASY. I finished making the batter so quickly I couldn't believe there wasn't more to it. In addition to adding nutmeg, I followed the posted advice of (1) squeezing the excess juice from the grated carrots and letting them drain, and (2) using confectioner's sugar to taste and vanilla in the filling instead of honey. I have a small oven, only one rack, so I put it in the middle. They all turned out perfect, and the final result looks like the picture. And the taste? Delightful! Only change for the future is to make them smaller.

These cookies were great. They taste even better with each day they sit in the fridge. After I grated the carrots, I strained them and squeezed out all the liquid as much as I could. I did not need to add any extra flour. I'm wondering if the reason people have said their batter was runny or tough to work with or the recipe needed more flour is because there is so much extra water in the carrots that needs to be squeezed out. Just a thought. I did not use honey for the frosting. Just cream cheese, sifted confectioner's sugar, and a little vanilla, as other reviwers suggested. yum. Will make them again sometime for sure.

I made some changes after reading the previous entries. More carrot, more flour, and I added some more spices...all I had on hand was some excellent Penzy's mulling spice (mace, cloves, allspice and cinnamon) which worked out wonderfully. I made large cookies and instead of sandwiching two of them I cut the tops off and filled them that way. I also made the frosting with a bit of butter, vanilla and superfine sugar. Like carrot cake they were excellent chilled.

Ultimately these cookies were tasty and fun, but I doubt I will make them again because the cookies were difficult to work with. They stuck to everything! I baked them on parchment, and they stuck to that, then they stuck to the cooling racks. I decided to freeze them on layers of waxed paper to firm them up, and they even stuck to that. Finally, when placed on the serving platter, they all stuck to each other. Hmph!

This was a fun, out-of-the-ordinary cookie to make. I took the advise of others and left out the honey in the filling and used confectioner's sugar and a bit of vanilla extract.

I love this recipe and although I'm not much of a baker, the cookies came out great. I made the first batch; they were puffy, looked just like the picture and had a tender but chewy texture. Perfect! Then I went to put in the second batch and found my egg sitting on the counter! I obviously forgot to put it in the batter so I added it in the 2nd batch and the cookies came out flat and runny. Is this possible that the first batch would come out so good without egg? I'm also cooking at high altitude so I don't know if that makes a difference. Great recipe even if you don't have any eggs.

I have made this twice and was loved by all. Had to add confectioners sugar to the filling but was fabulous.

Great recipe! Following the advice of previous reviewers (thanks -- you're why I love this site!), I added a smidge more carrot and a smidge more flour, and I ignored the honey in favor of a cream cheese/vanilla/confectioner's sugar filling. I used only about 1/3 of a cup of confectioner's sugar (that's all I had, but my lack thankfully resulted in a perfectly contrasting tanginess). And yes, the cookies would even be great on their own, thanks to their terrific crunchy-chewy texture.

Easy, unpretentious and delicious. The best part about this recipe was that I already had every ingredient in the house.

Made these for a group of my husband's colleagues. Everyone went on and on about how delicious they were. They are good and they're easy. I used silpat and added an extra carrot so there was none of the runniness I read about in other comments.

I used one teflon and one metal cookie sheet...the metal came out better. The cookies came out huge despite very little batter used. They spread very flat. The filling is terrible. Do not use honey...it makes the cream cheese too thin...like other reviewers I had to add confectionary sugar to thicken. They are not pretty and not worth the effort in my opionion.

This recipe is FABULOUS. My roommates loved it - doubled the recipe for an event at work, and they all turned out just fine. Perfect for any carrot cake lover, and definitely easy to make!

Yummy! Made these for a group of us and everyone loved them. These were surprisingly easy to make, too.

To the cook from Clearwater: my cookies were soft and puffy. My guess is that your baking soda is past its prime. Another possibility is that the carrots you used contained a lot of water, and more flour was needed to bind the mixture due to the extra moisture and to keep the cookies from speading. Try again; it's a worthwhile recipe. Good luck!

Super! I rarely give 4 forks. I found the frosting to be plenty-I added 2 Tb. of powdered sugar and a spalsh of vanilla. The carrot cake lover will love these!

I loved the taste of these little yummies, however my cookies were flat and fragile. What can I do to make them rise better and be more sturdy?

Yummy! These are sooo good and I cannot wait to make them again. For the filling, I too used a little vanilla and 10x sugar instead of honey, and for the cookies, I had to "play" with the dough. I added extra grated carrots, and I actually doubled everything for a big batch, so my dough ended up runny and the first batch I baked ran off the cookie sheet. SO...... I just kept adding flour until the consistency was right and they were great! Very moist, and flavorful. Loved the crunch of the walnuts and the creamy filling. My picnic companions also enjoyed them!

I really loved the recipe. The first time I made it I accidently forgot to put the granulated sugar in but they still turned out great. The next two times I made them as the recipe indicated but they came out really flat. I'll try half of the granulated sugar in the next batch and see of that makes a difference. I also used two different types of pans but the outcome from the last two batches were pretty much the same. I used the same pans the first time I made them and they came up firm and mounded.

Made them two times. Real crowd pleaser. Better to use regular carrots. Used Sweet Nantes carrots the 2nd time and they had too much water in them.

Absolutely delicious!~ Double the filling in order to fill all the cookies full enough!

These cookies were so easy to make. I would however double the recipe for the filling. They were gobbled up in no time at all.

This recipe was so simple yet so divine on the tastebuds. I substituted the cream cheese with neufchatel cheese, actually by accident. I found the neufchatel cheese to be lighter and made for not so heavy of a cookie. I'd opt for the neufchatel cheese again.

Unbelievable cookies...and I don't even like sweets!!! I also use a silpat to cut down on butter. I used the Sarah's recipe for the filling that a poster suggested, thank you. Wonderful desert, a crowd pleaser.

Yes they're big - but everyone liked them and no one suggested making them smaller. Substituted 10X sugar for honey and added a touch of vanilla to the icing - but other than that followed recipe exactly. Different and delicious!

How did you like these cookies, P-town? Oh, you didn't make them. Please keep your comments to yourself. By the way, the cookies were delicious. :)

I loved the cookies i changed the walnuts to pecans and the filling was nasty so i used sara's cream cheese frosting instead. it is mdes with: For filling (makes enough filling for 3 batches of cookies) 8 ounces cream cheese, softened ½ cup butter, softened 4 cups confectioners' sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract ¼ teaspoon almond extract combine butter cream cheese, confectioners sugar, almond and vanilla. Beat until smooth and creamy

Terrific - a big hit at Easter. Followed suggestion to used maple syrup instead of honey - these taste just like a cream cheese frosted carrot cake.

I liked this but will make a few changes next time. I found the cookies to be too smooth.. a little more carrot and some more nuts would create a more interesting texture. I also thought there was WAY too much honey in the cream cheese mixture... it overpowered the tanginess you get with cream cheese frosting. Next time I will cut it down to only a tablespoon or two.

I doubled this recipe and it turned out perfect. I used a 20 size ice cream scoop (3 T) and baked 6 cookies on a silpat at a time. They were a hit at easter---great recipe!!

I made these for Easter dessert up in Tahoe. I used a 1 Tbsp cookie scoop and the size seemed right for young kids. They baked a little faster, but not much. One sheet came out too flat. I used two identical cookie sheets and think it might have been a result of baking two sheets at once. I baked the last two sheets one (sheet)-at-a-time without a problem. My 5-year-old had fun constructing the sandwiches. The adults all really liked the cookies. The kids ate the one they were served, but didn't ask for seconds (saving up their special requests for jelly beans?) which was a perfect result from this mom's perspective. As someone with 3 young kids (and a slew of relatives in the same boat) I think this is a keeper -- it's simple, neat to eat, and sophiticated enough for the adults to enjoy.

I wasn't too fond of this recipe, I thought it was lacking that "oomph". I won't make this again.

I made these for Easter and they were a big hit. My family said that they looked liked they came from a bakery. Followed the advice of the other reviewers and use some comfectioners sugar and a little honey and made them smaller. - oh and left out the nuts because someone was allergic - still came delicious.

Excellent! More work than I planned for, but worth it. Some reviewers said the cookie was flat. I noticed I used two different cookie sheets, one metal and one teflon. The cookies from the teflon sheet were noticably "flatter" than the metal cookie sheet! As suggested here, I used confectioner's sugar instead of honey and added a little vanilla in the cream cheese.

The cookies were tasty. I had a lot of frosting leftover. I didn't have vanilla but don't think it was really missed. The first batch came out flat, I don't know why. They are very sweet. One is plenty.

Yummy...I just finished making these for an afterschool snack for my kids. I used a different cream cheese frosting because I didn't have any honey. They are really good, even without the nuts, which I left out b/c my kids hate them.

I did have some problems with this recipe because the first sheet of cookies came out totally flat! The dough seemed way too soft and gooey, so after that first flat batch, I added about 2-3 tablespoons of extra flour. They were delicious and cakey. Also used powdered sugar instead of honey to sweeten the cream cheese.

My German husband is very finicky about sweets and when he saw the mess in the bowl he was not impressed. After baking, I force-fed him a piece of one huge, warm cookie (sans cream cheese) and he sheepishly asked if he could have a whole one! The honey overpowered the cream cheese in my opinion... I think a light pure cream cheese might be sufficient. Easy to make and delicious...

These were a big hit! I will definitely be making them again! They are very sweet, soft and cakey, and it really works in a carrot cake cookie. They're also lovely both as filled sandwich cookies and as regular unfrosted single cookies. Instead of the honey I used a little maple syrup, some powdered sugar, and a dash of vanilla in the cream cheese filling. If you would like to make them smaller without changing the texture, just reduce the cooking time--try about 10 minutes or so. Attention vegans! These veganize perfectly with margarine and Ener-G for the egg (I think 1 Tbsp packed ground flax plus 3 Tbsp water would work too, but have only tried the Ener-G in these), and purchased vegan cream cheese and maple syrup (or other syrup) for the filling. Or, in a pinch, you could try looking at the canned cream cheese frostings--sometimes some are actually animal-free, and available at most grocery stores.

Amazing cookies! Very easy to make and such a crowd pleaser. I used light cream cheese and they turned out delicious. Highly recommended.

Excellent. I love carrot cake, but at parties sometimes its easier to have cookies and bar cookies (no plates and forks). These cookies are perfect for that. Also, they are a little different than the cookies you normally see. I would definitely make them again. Also, I think the size is perfect - I took them to my cake decorating class and no one had a problem eating a whole cookie.

Great cookies! I agree with the other poster and would make these smaller next time. I also think they are delicious without the icing, but the icing is nice too! I added about 1 T. powdered sugar to my icing for more flavor.

Help! I made this recipe after reading all the glowing reviews. My cookies turned out flat as pancakes - I practically had to shave them off the cookie sheets, and then they fell apart. I used air-bake sheets. Any suggestions?! Had to throw away half the batch.

My family was wild about them. Two asked for the recipe. My husband told me to make the cookies smaller than recommended for a smaller serving and that made the cookie brittle, but still yummy. It's a big cookie for a child.

Oh Wow! These were great! The only thing I might do differntly is make them smaller. (Not sure if they would bake as cake-like that way though) I ended up cutting them in 1/2 to eat them. This is one of the few cookies that I can eat 1/2 of and be satisfied. I went back an hour later but... really, don't miss these.

Yum Yum! My husband said there among the best cookies he's ever had. Try them, they are deliciously unique.
