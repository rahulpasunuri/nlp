does anyone know why the original recipe in the Silver Palate cookbook uses only pureed carrots but the recipe featured in Epicurious uses both pureed and grated carrots? Which one is better?

This was the first carrot cake I have made. I choose it because of the coconut and pineapple which was a wise choice. The addition of these flavors made the cake more interesting. The recipe is delicious and I will make it again. I should have taken the cake out of the oven at 50 min, because it was a little dry at 58 min. I did not use the frosting recipe because of the reviews. I used one of my own. I will try the applesauce trick to replace the oil the next time I make the recipe to reduce calories.

I made some modifications: The cake recipient requested no nuts/raisins, so I substituted 2 cups of shredded carrot and increased the pineapple to the amount in the large can. I substituted 1/2 c apple sauce for 1/2 c. of the oil. The cake turned out VERY MOIST- and delectable!!!! I could have added the extra raisins and nuts to all of the extra carrot and still would have been moist. I used the cream cheese frosting recipe from 'Triple Layer Carrot Cake'- perfect every time. Overall a hit, and one I'll make over and over (with the extra carrot!).

I did not use as much sugar both in the cake and frosting. It was an absolutely delicious cake. I received top compliments from all members of the family. I will definitely be making this cake over and over again!

Had to try this recipe because of the pureed carrots, sounded so interesting. Then because it also reminded me of morning glory muuffins ended up making muffins. Decreased oil to 1/3 cup and added cup of applesauce (a standard substitution for me). Turned out great.

This was a fantastic cake. Moist, great texture and wonderful flavor. DO yourself a favor and find a better icing recipe. The icing is TOO runny although it tastes great. You have to at least double it, especially if you decide to do a double stacked 9" round cake.

Loved it. I followed the recipe exactly, though I was unsure about sifting the flour and sugar together. (I thought you were supposed to beat the oil and the sugar first...) but it worked and it was delightful. I also used (2) 9 inch round pans and ended up cooking the cakes for 55 minutes. Perfection. Lastly, since so many folks gave the frosting bad reviews, I used the maple cream cheese frosting on epicurious and it was delicious. I'd definitely make it again.

So good. Sooo good. I had a bit of an oven disaster the first time I tried this (the dial somehow got turned up all the way, I left the house for 15 minutes and returned to a charred black lump). I gave it another go the next day and I'm glad I did. I couldn't stop eating it! This is possibly the best cake I've ever made... but I agree that the frosting was too runny. I also substituted more carrot for the sweetened coconut since my husband hates coconut and it was good.

Rating: 2
the cake was very moist and had nice flavor. however, it was very dense and heavy. the frosting was way too runny (though it tasted good). i had made a 2-layer cake and the frosting dripped down the sides/would not stay on the cake! next time i would maybe cut back on the amount of lemon juice and try zest instead...

Amazing. I up'd the amount of carrots and used a light brown sugar from the caribbean. I also added some chopped pecans. There's never any cake left. Good with or without the frosting

Best carrot cake ever! It did seem a little skimpy on the grated carrots, so I added an extra cup of grated carrot and omitted the coconut. (I have a friend who hates coconut.) Very good.

I omitted the walnuts and made cupcakes with these and they turned out great, although maybe there was a little too much going on for a little cupcake (coconut, carrot, pineapple). However, for some reason the carrots turned green - does anyone know why?

I followed the cake recipe precisely and came out with probably the best carrot cake I've ever eaten. I served it to 7 other people who all said the same thing. I used frosting from the Spiced pumpkin Layer Cake recipe (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/240123) and thought it worked perfectly! I will definitely make this again for a special occasion.

Rating: 4
This carrot cake was delicious! Super moist and full of flavor but not too intense, good for making BIG cakes. I made a double recipe and put a layer of frosting between. I halved the oil and added half a cup of cinnamon apple sauce. I also used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon to give a variety of spices. I skipped the walnuts by request from one of the eaters and I used 4 carrots instead of three. I also used whole wheat flour. It was a spectacular cake, one of the best consistencies I've ever achieved. The frosting that comes with this recipe is a disaster. I did 2 8oz pkgs of cream cheese, a stick and half of butter, and a couple teaspoons of vanilla, mix it all together and add powdered sugar to taste, almost a whole box (you can add lemon juice if you want).

Used this recipe for my first ever (from scratch) carrot cake and it was a hit. A bit more fiddly than I've since found other carrot cake recipes to be but then it turns out a moist and texture packed cake. Didn't enjoy the frosting and will consider making it without or using another recipe. Then again, I'm a frosting-virgin so the icing recipe might grow on me over time. I would add more lemon juice to give the frosting a stronger lemon taste.

My daughter and I made this for a 'special' birthday. The best carrot cake we've ever had!

WEll...I followed the suggestion to sub 1/2 of the oil with 1/2 applesauce and added some nutmeg and allspice. I liked the cake itself. I too used two 9 inch pans and layered it as a birthday cake with frosting between the layers. BUT...the cream cheese frosting (which I doubled) was mediocre at best. I followed the recipe EXACTLY. It simply is not that spectacular. I would make the cake again, but not the icing.

I loved this recipe - used it for my son's b-day party and made cupcakes (took about half the cooking time). They were great! I used pastry flour since that is what I had on hand and between that in puree it was wonderful moist goodness. such a wonderful bright color too. I doubled the frosting but had plenty leftover. I then put coconut on top of some of the cupcakes and made fishies out of fruit leather for others. Huge hit - would certainly make it again.

I made this recipe again since I had the extra frosting and pineapple. THis time I made it in muffin tins and baked for about 25-30 mins. For the 1 cup oil, I substituted 2/3 cup applesauce & 1 cup ground flax seed meal. I also used all whole-wheat flour. For the sugar, I used 1 cup + 3 teaspoons of Stevia (natural sugar substitute). The cupcakes/muffins still turned out very moist with a healthy kick.

Rating: 4
This cake was very yummy and several people liked it (brought it to work). After reading all the reviews, I following several helpful suggestions. I did make several substitutions per the prior reviewers suggestions: used half whole-wheat flour, reduced sugar to 1.5 cups, used 4 carrots, substituted applesauce for 1/2 the oil. I used thompson raisins instead of coconut since someone did not like it so much. I toasted the walnuts before mixing them in. Also, as my husband is an Omega-3 fanatic, I tossed in about 1/2 cup of ground flax seed meal. I baked it in a dark metal 13x9 pan at 325 and took it out after 45-50 minutes. I also doubled the frosting recipe but had about 3/4 cup leftover.

I have a bakery business and use this recipe as a basis for my very popular carrot cake. I sub applesauce for half of the oil and I add additional spices, as some others have as well. I even add a little dash of cumin. Everyone raves about this cake! I have used all cake flour, which gives the cake a lighter texture. If I'm making cupcakes I'll use the cake flour. It freezes wonderfully too.

This was a big hit at Easter! Cake was moist and flavorful with all the different ingredients. I made the following tweaks based on previous suggestions: definitely toast the nuts prior to adding and use more to decorate the outside of the finished cake; added an extra carrot, added 1 tsp salt, cut cinnamon to 1 t, added a large pinch of cloves, along with 1/2 t allspice, 1/2 t nutmeg, 1/2 t ginger; I increased the entire batter recipe by 50% to fill two 10" cake pans (for example, the 1/2 tsp allspice became 3/4 tsp) and it made a large, impressive cake! Baked for ~45 mins. I tripled the frosting, which was fresher tasting than most cream cheese frostings but not too "lemony"...great!

This cake was fantastic. Not a huge fan of chunks of walnuts so we ground them down in the food proccessor a bit. Also ended up tripling the frosting recipe as we did a double layer cake. Will definitely make again.

I love this recipe!! I used the cook from Seattles suggestion about using the pineapple juice. Fabulous. I will say that I doubled the frosting and I could have tripled it easily. I also added golden raisins.

Fantastic! Everyone is STILL raving about this cake!! Followed previous tips and used large can of baby food for mashed carrots and substituted 1/2 the oil with pineapple juice. Toasted the coconut and walnuts. Baked in 3 9" pans - took about 20 min or so to bake. Doubled the icing and it still wasn't enough - would make more next time. Decorated top and sides with marzipan carrots from Martha Stewart's Baking Handbook (also on her website). Looked as good as it tasted!

Adore this cake, and have made it so many times that I've changed it and made it in some ways simpler. Following someone else's advice, I use 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. salt, and 1/2 tsp. each of cloves, nutmeg, and allspice. Instead of boiling carrots, I just buy a can of carrots and mash them. I drain 1/2 cup of my pineapple juice into a measuring cup and then do only 1/2 cup of oil. Oh, and I just use the whole darn can of crushed pineapple...what do you do otherwise with that teensy bit of pineapple that's left over? I also do 1 c. of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Lastly, I put the 1 cup of coconut and 1 cup of walnuts into a frying pan and carefully carefully carefully brown them before adding to the recipe--adds lots more depth to the flavor! I always have leftover coconut and walnuts, so when the cake goes in the oven, I carefully brown them, let them cool, and then smoosh around the outside of the cake after it's frosted (2 layer cake, that is!) Of course, gotta double the frosting recipe!

Wonderfully moist and dense. I made some alterations after reading the reviews: used 1 c of sugar, 1/2 c splenda and 1/2 c packed brown sugar. 8 oz. of junior carrot baby food (shortcut for pureeing carrots), 1 1/2 c finely shredded sweet baby carrots, added 1/4 t. salt, 1/4 t. allspice, 1/4 t. fresh grated nutmeg, 1 T. finely minced crystallized ginger, and a pinch of finely ground clove, 1 c. of golden raisins. The canned crushed pineapple was unsweetened. The sweetness was perfect on this cake. I knew the icing would be easy (I would just do a regular cream cheese icing) and concentrated on getting the cake to where I thought it should be. It arrived. Rich and aromatic. I baked it in a bundt pan. It didn't last long enough to get iced. A very well traveled neighbor who frequents upscale restaurants said this was the best carrot cake they ever had ..with the exception of one they had in Amsterdam 15 years ago! Rave reviews from everyone! I question whether the crystallized ginger was necessary, but this was outstanding!

A delicious, moist cake. I was skeptical when I saw the batter (it's thick, gloppy and extremely sugary) but the results are very good.

I also baked this recipe as cupcakes instead of a flat cake.

I have made this as cupcakes (cooking time is only 30 min and makes about 26) and altered the recipe slightly. I steam the carrots to maintain nutritive qualities, I use 2 carrots cooked and 2 shredded raw. When pureeing I add some of the pineapple juice to aid blending, I add 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp. salt, 1/2 tbs vanilla and 2 tbsp wheat germ for added fibre. The kids love it and no icing is necessary.

Made this into a 9" double layer cake. Baked for 50 minutes. Came out perfectly. Left out the walnuts. Like other reviewers, I added 1/4 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp allspice, delicious. For the frosting, had to quadruple the amount of butter and cream cheese but only doubled the powdered sugar (it was already too sweet for my taste) vanilla, and lemon. Served this cake for guests tonight and cake was met with rave reviews. First time baking a cake and can't believe how easy it was. Definitely a winner.

This was fantastic! It tastes like classic carrot cake, but is just the right texture and very moist. I only made the cake and used a different cream cheese frosting recipe. The cake didn't taste like coconut or pineapple, but the addition of the two ingredients made this cake very moist. My only change was to use 3/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce with 1/4 cup of canola oil to cut down on the fat. I also baked this in two 9" round pans, which took 30-35 minutes.

You can say what you like about Mother Berta but the lady knows carrot cake. I've made this cake twice in the last month--once for a birthday and then for Thanksgiving. I added 1/4 tsp of salt and a cup of raisins and I pureed 5 carrots. This cake is incredible!! The icing is good but really unnecessary, if you make this cake in two loaf pans, you could serve the icing on the side. The high sugar content gives this cake a lovely chewy cosistency on the outside. It's great, best carrot cake recipe I've ever used. 5 stars!!!

This is really the best tasting carrot cake around because it has FLAVOR. It is absolutely delicous. I've been making it for 5 years, but recently, on the last 3 times i've made it, my cakes are falling in the center once i take them out of the oven. I cannot believe it and do not know what the cause is?? Does anyone know? Also, the frosting is great but i've learned a few tricks: double it, leave the cream cheese out on the counter overnigiht as well as the butter, and whip it for about 8 minutes. It makes the best frosting. Also freeze your layers the night before or (whenever) and frost it frozen...yes it does cover up any imperfections. Another great substitution in the frosting is orange zest instead of lemon juice...it is tasty. People will love it. Now if i can just solve my baking issue i'd be a happy camper.

I made this cake in a bundt pan. It was very moist and delicious. I omitted the coconut and added golden raisins. I thought I had forgotten to add salt because it tasted a bit flat but when I checked the recipe, it didn't call for salt. The frosting kind of masked this though. You must double the recipe for the cream cheese frosting to have enough for a bundt cake.

Fantastic. I used recipe exactly except cut oil by 1/4 cup and added raisins, then made into cupcakes. 350 degrees for about 18 minutes is perfect for regular sized cupcakes. The frosting is so easy to handle I made an orange batch and a green batch, then made carrot decorations on top of each one. Fabulous, moist carrot flavor and not too sweet.

This is a very nice, very moist carrot cake. I made it in 2 8" layer pans and cooked for around 40 minutes, I think. Then I doubled the frosting recipe (although that still wasn't quite enough for a layer cake). I don't normally like canned pineapple, but you really cannot taste it, and it makes the cake very moist. I was worried about the lemon juice in the frosting, so only put half the amount, and it was great. Next time I'll put the whole Tbsp. It's a very nice, very simple cake. Everyone loved it.

I did make a few changes to the recipe; I replaced the coconut with rasins(half golden,half dark) and instaed of 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, I reduced it to add some clove, ginger and nutmeg. I also added 2 additional ounces of cream cheese to the frosting. I didn't feel it was thick enough or tasted very cream cheesy. Also, BEWARE OF TIME! My cake was done in 40 minutes...that's a hugh difference from an hour. I noticed many reviews back that others had the same experience. All that being said, this was very delicious, not too sweet and very moist cake. I will definitely make this again.

Definitely the best version of carrot cake I've had. Never fails to get compliments, and it's so easy to make.

Guests are still raving about the cake weeks after I made it (except one rude friend that said she "wasn't impressed" with the icing. Everyone else was so I choose to ignore her negative feedback.

Everybody loved this amazing carrot cake. I did, however, halve sugar quantities for cake and icing. I couldn't find crushed pineapple in Paris so I just cut pineapple rings into small slices, used 3 grated carrots and not purée. Less butter and flaked coconut for the icing is good. Easy for novice cooks like myself. Cook on a low heat for about an hour.

This was sooo easy with wonderful results. Like a previous reviewer had stated, it's not spicy. The cake is very moist and light. Definitely not one of those heavy carrot cakes, nor is it overly sweet. Great for any occassion but simple enough to do just because. I will have to say watch your baking time. It only took about 40 minutes in my oven which is usually pretty right on.

I made this cake last week for a friend's birthday and it was a huge hit. One friend at the party said he hates cake but really liked this one- he said it tasted like a muffen. I followed the cake recipe exactly but made a double layer cake using two 8 inch pans (cooked for about 35 minutes). I realized early on there wasn't going to be nearly enough frosting for a double layer cake. I used a total of 16 oz of cream cheese (egad!), 1.5 cups of powdered sugar, 6T butter, 1T lemon juice and 1t vanilla. To keep the frosting crumb-free I recommend spreading a thin layer of frosting over the cake to catch all the loose crumbs, putting the cake in the fridge for 10 minutes to set, then putting on the final frosting layer.
