Exceptional. First, you can make the chocolate leaves days in advance; keep in a sealed container in the fridge. I used a combination of Camilla leaves and fresh Bay leaves. Put the chocolate on heavy and put in the fridge for at least 45 minutes. For a second serving I used a watercolor type paintbrush and "painted" chocolate Christmas trees onto parchment paper. When cooled they'll slide right off. I had to cook the custard several minutes longer than the recipe calls for. Dipping the ladyfingers: quick dip only. You want them to still be crisp in the middle after you dip them (it helps to let the dipping sauce cool some). As the tiramisu sits the ladyfingers will continue to absorb some liquid and will continue to soften up. You do need to make extra dipping sauce (I doubled mine). A memorable dessert, both presentation and taste. And not that hard to make at all, just measure out everything before you begin and you'll be fine. Alcohol: When I was making it I thought it tasted a bit "boozy" but once the custard sat on the ladyfingers it was perfect. Make this at least the day before serving and I would consider doing it two days before. It does get better with a bit of time. I would absolutely make this again.

I WOULD GIVE THIS RECEPIE 5 FORKS. IT WAS FABULOUS. USE A VERY LARGE BOWL FOR THE EGS TO AVOID ANY MESS AD BEAT THE CREAM IN A BOWL IN THE SINK TO AWOID SPLASHING. I RAN OUT OF LIQUID TO SOAK THE CRISPY LADYFINGERS,SO I HAD TO AD ANOTHER 2/3 CUP OF COFFEE/SUGAR/WATER MIXTURE. EVERYONE LOVED IT.

This was the best tiramisu I ever made. Although called "Eggnog" it didn't really have an eggnogginess about it---just yummy tiramisu. Rave compliments, nothing was left, people were licking their plates. I cut the recipe in half and put in an 8x8 pan---had some ricotta mixture left over, but that's OK. Also forgot (!) to halve the alcohol in the whipped cream mixture and worried about too much alcohol---but it was great and I will definitely make that same mistake again! I couldn't find ladyfingers, so used Stella Doro Margherite cookies and they were fine.

I find this to be an excellent choice of desserts to serve for Christmas parties, however I substitute amaretti for the ladyfingers.

This is a scene stealer at any dinner party. The chocolate leaves make it truely spectacular. We received complements from EVERYONE on this dessert. My only negative comment is that the eggnog flavor gets lost in the coffee flavor. I have made this several times and it's always a hit!

I made this twice over Christmas--goes faster with practice. Second time I made only 3/4 of the whipped cream/custard mixture which made it exactly fill the 14-C trifle bowl. Otherwise you will have a lot of that filling left over. Instead of the leaves, I made the chocolate Xmas trees painted on parchment paper suggested by another reviewer. I dusted the trees and the top of the dessert with a little powdered sugar and created a snowy chocolate forest on top. At the table I spooned the finished dessert into martini glasses to serve, with a chocolate tree on each. What a SHOWSTOPPER and not nearly as hard as it looks.

I've been making this recipe every year since it came out in 2003. It now a required dessert at any of my parties that I throw or go to. I don't typically follow recipes to the tee but this one I do except for the chocolate leaves, I just used a nice chocolate and crumble it on top. I highly recommend this recipe!!

My original intention was to half the recipe but my bowl didn't look full enough so I did as follows: Cut the custard and whipped cream recipe in half - I made the recommended 3 layers and added 1 tsp of almond extract to the whipped cream portion. Then, to keep my trifle from looking inadequate, I put another layer of soaked lady fingers on top and made a layer of just whipped cream (not the custard) to top it with 1 cup of whipped cream, 1 tsp of vanilla, and 1 tbsp of almond extract. So in the end, I cut the custard part in half; split the whipped cream into two portions - one that got folded into the mascarpone custard and one to top the bowl (and added almond extract); and followed the soaked lady fingers as directed. The almond extract was a really nice addition to the whipped cream topping - it blended well with the rest of the dish rather than making it taste like a trifle topped in whipped cream.

This is always a crowd please at my house. I don't include the chocolate leaves, but just sprinkle ground up chocolate on top. I prepare the custerd a day before to let it set well, then assemble the night before.

very easy and delicious! I don't recommand to put the chocolate leaves on top it would be to much chocolate and the taste of the cake is good as it is. I just put some ground good quality chocolate on top and decorate with whip cream. Next time I will also won't put that much amount of kahlua it was a little bit to much to my taste.

I made this recipe for our Thanksgiving feast and it made a fantastic end to a great meal. I did not make chocolate leaves and was fine without them. I subbed kahlua for the brandy+rum (and then subbed godiva liquer for the kahlua in the whipped cream). I ended up doubling the espresso part of the recipe because I accidentally over-soaked the first two layers of lady fingers, resulting in running out of the espresso and having to make another batch. The bottom layers ended up a bit strong because of it, but still tasty. I was prepared to spend 15-20 minutes making the custard, as per other reviews, but it truly took only the amount of time listed in the recipe (roughly 5 minutes). This was a surprisingly easy recipe and would make a great show-stopper type dessert for any kind of party.

Rating: 4
I thought this recipe turned out very well; the flavors seemed to blend together nicely on the second day. I would make it a day ahead of time to allow that to happen. I didn't bother with the espresso powder, just used espresso from Starbucks. The dipping method was awkward. I ended up just using a small pitcher to drizzle the espresso over the lady fingers, and that worked great. I topped it with whipped cream, and it was a hit at Christmas. We would definitely make this one again.

I made this recipe last weekend for a party that was canceled due to snow. It completely filled a 14C trifle bowl. I had enough of the eggnog filling left over to use as a sauce to accompany the Spiced Apple cake on this site. Because of the mascarpone cheese, the filling had more substance than the suggested store-bought eggnog. The two recipes worked well together. I'm hoping the trifle will keep in the fridge - I want to serve it at on Christmas day - I know it will be soggy, but it's just going to be the two of us -- we'll cope!

I made this recipe to present at a Holiday dinner last night. I have never been a fan of tiramisu but this was fantastic! All of the guests loved it as well. And the presentation was incredible --- even better than the picture on the website. Since there were some guests who are not found of brandy or rum, I simply added Kahlua to the Marcapone mixture and Godiva chocolate liquer to the whipped cream. It resulted in a yummy combination. This is a welcome addition to my repetoire of holiday desserts.

I've reviewed this before several years ago, but as an ingredients tip, Trader Joes, if they exist in your area, has hands-down the best price on a very tasty mascarpone, usually $3 a container. I've found the cheapest lady fingers to actually be the Whole Foods store brand, a couple bucks a box. It makes the dessert a lot more affordable.

I've made this dessert about a dozen times and each time my friends and family have raved about it. The tiramisu makes an elegant presentation with or without the leaves and everyone loves it! Thanks!

Delicious, like many have said. The chocolate leaves on top are completely unnecessary and detract from the flavor of the dish, though they do look nice for presentation. The recipe was much less time-consuming than I thought. I had it all together and chilling overnight in about an hour. The recipe was enough to fill my 14c trifle dish as well as a 4-5c crystal dish I had. It went over very well with my Christmas Eve guests. The only downside was its cost. It's truly a VERY expensive dish to make. I spent 30 bucks alone on the mascarpone and the ladyfingers for the dessert.

This dish was the standout of a great New Year's Day dinner! My restaurant owning friend pronounced I had outdone myself! Beautiful presentation- another friend paraded it through the house, and photos were taken by all. Could not find "crisp lady fingers", but used Pepperidge Farm Pirouettes, 1 can of Vanilla and 1 of chocolate hazelnut. Perfect texture, and looked fabulous lining the dish. Used orange leaves for the chocolate. Worked well and looked wonderful. Do try this, you'll love it!

Very delicious. I followed the recipe, but made it in a 13 x 9 glass baking dish instead of a trifle dish. I omitted the chocolate leaves on top but dusted the top with ground chocolate. Served it for Christmas dinner 2008 and got rave reviews. Nice change from our usual cheesecake.

Rating: 3
I gave this recipe 3 forks instead of 4 because the eggnog flavor in the custard didn't really come through in the final dish. However, it's a very good tiramisu recipe and everyone enjoyed it very much. Many thanks to the reviewer who had the idea for the chocolate christmas trees. I didn't have a trifle dish so I made it in a rectangular pan, put a layer of confectioners sugar for a snowy winter scene and put in chocolate trees. I made the trees by spooning melted chocolate onto wax paper in the form of a triangle, then dragged the end of a toothpick from the center outward to make the branches. Everyone thought this easy thing looked so great that they insisted on taking pictures of it.

I made this trifle for a wine tasting party I hosted for 100 people and it was so spectacular my guests were taking pictures of it! Had to drive 30 miles away to find gold dust and champagne cookies (would use plain ladyfingers next time). It was truly impressive looking and very tasty. Very festive for the holidays but I made it in the summer. Thank goodness for air conditioning or those chocolate leaves would have melted into chocolate sauce. Paint the chocolate on thick or they'll break and you'll have to redo, like I did. Worked out fine though. I froze them and stuck them in the refrigerated trifle at the last minute and them randomly painted them. Much easier than trying to hold the leaves individually and paint them. Try it, it was FUN!

Rating: 4
This was excellent and a huge success. I don't like coffee, so I substituted a chocolate liqueur (Godiva) for the Kahlua and the espresso. I already had a box of chocolate leaves that I'd made weeks ago in the freezer, so decorating was easy. I beat the mascarpone thoroughly before adding it to the custard, so the custard came out completely smooth - none of the graininess that another reviewer disliked. My trifle bowl is full-sized, but there was custard left over. No complaints - it turned out to be an excellent sauce for chocolate cake. I agree with others who say this takes longer than advertised to make (20-30 minutes sounds about right), but it's well worth the time. I'll be making it again, even though we're well out of the eggnog season.

This tiramisu was a big hit. I made this with my boyfriend and it definitely was a 2 person task! The filling definitely takes more than the 5 minutes indicated in the recipe...more like 15-20 minutes. We halved the alcohol because we didn't want it to be too overpowering. We might try using 3/4 instead next time. There was plenty of ingredients leftover...enough for another 8x8 baking dish. This is a great dessert to make for a special occassion. Note: We used 2 cups of Starbucks espresso and added 4 tbsp sugar. We got our marscapone from Whole Foods (warning: pricey)

Made this for a holiday potluck at work and everyone raved! Didn't make the chocolate leaves (ran out of time), but crumbled a few extra cookies on top and sprinkled with more fresh nutmeg. Fattening and rich, but what great dessert isn't?

Everyone raved over this...fabulous flavor, smooth consistency (missed & had only 3 masc so added 1 container light whipped cream cheese), time consuming but not all that difficult, and even without the chocolate leaves or as many layers as I'd have liked (need a deeper bowl than I had), this was the hit of Christmas dinner! A keeper for sure.

This was simply to DIE for. I brought it to a holiday party and everyone ooo-ed and ahhh-ed. Will definitely make it again. My tips: 1) Brush the coffee mixture onto the ladyfingers instead of dunking. 2) Brush the leaves with chocolate as thickly as possible. 3) The filling takes MUCH longer than 5 mins - I would say at least 25-30 mins.

My daughter and I used this recipe to create individual trifles in dessert glasses. They were truly exceptional! We followed the recipe as written with one minor exception - used fresh brewed espresso instead of water and espresso powder. We layered the soaked ladyfingers in the glasses, topped with the mousse, chocoate shavings and garnished with fresh whipped cream, chocolate curls and another ladyfinger. They were easy, beautiful and delicious!

This is a great recipe, but definitely one that you should plan on doing in steps. The chocolate leaves really do add something special presentation wise. I used a basic white cake instead of cookies it really did soak up the flavor just wonderfully.

This is the best tiramisu I've ever had and I'm a real fan of the stuff. You do have to be careful not to overwhip the cream as I did the second time I made it. It will gve the filling a very lumpy, gritty consistency and it won't be anywhere near as good. But when done correctly, I could sit with the bowl in my lap and just keep eating. Beyond fabulous!!

I have to say I did not care for this tiramisu. There is nothing wrong with the recipe but I did not like the eggnog and coffee flavor combination and neither did my guests. No one asked for seconds and in fact the first helping was barely eaten. The dessert looks fabulous but that is about all I can say.

I made this for Christmas because of the numerous 4 forks. I made exactly as written except for needing to make two batches of the espresso mixture for the ladyfingers. I was not impressed with this recipe. I am known as the neighborhood and family gourmet cook. NOBODY liked this. I have made trifles before as I grew up with them as my mother is from England, but the custard is silky. This custurd was silky until the mascarpone was added. The ingredient cost and the time this takes to make is excessive for the quality of this dessert.

Rating: 4
This was absolutely unbelievable! I am very picky when it comes to tiramisu and this one ranks as my #2 favorite of all time! The only thing I changed about the recipe was I doubled the espresso mixture (as recommended by others) and spooned it over the ladyfingers instead of dunking them in. I do not like my ladyfingers soggy, and this really worked out just right. This will definitely become a staple dessert in our house!

Wonderful dish with a great presentation. Making it again, I would make 1 1/2 batches of the dipping liquid. I took the adivse of others and made a double batch, of which I used it all, but it was a little too much. Maybe break the liquid into 3 batches so that you don't use it up on the bottom and not have enough for the ladyfingers toward the top of the trifle. I also cut down on the rum a little, as we do not like it to strong. It was a hit!

I made this for Christmas and it was fabulous. Everyone is still talking about it! I agree with one reviewer regarding using more liquid for soaking the lady fingers, I made 2.5 batches of espresso. I think that this one might become a Christmas tradition as my family is still asking for more!

Rating: 4
This was definitely the hit of our Christmas desert table. It was decadent. I did not feel like dealing with the leaves so instead I melted the chocolate and then painted little Christmas trees (surprisingly easy)on parchment paper. Once the trees were hardened I dusted them with white dust (to look like snow). I then arranged the trees around the top. A little chocolate winter forest. Also, I think the amount of alcohol was perfect. I wouldn't change it.

Rating: 4
This was great! It made much more than fit into a 14c. trifle bowl, which was fine because we liked it so much and were happy to have a second, smaller leftover the next day. I did end up using a lot more liquid for soaking the biscuits because I like them nice and soft (about 3 c. liquid vs. 1 c. as called for). I agree with the last reviewer, too. The ground chocolate was great.

Rating: 4
This was a showstopper! In fact, I made it for a party last night and am going to make another one for a party tonight! I cut the recipe in half and it still served alot of people and kept the cost a little more reasonable. I ground up Sharffen Berger chocolate in the food processor and was a little skeptical about the texture vs. the Pernigotti cocoa powder I normally use in tiramisu, but think now I will only make with ground chocolate! The chocolate leaves with the edible gilding were easy and beatiful. Make sure not to soak the ladyfingers too long or you will end up with the dessert being watery on the bottom layer. Dip in and count to about 10. If you break one in half at that point the outside will have absorbed the coffee mixture but the inside will still be white (it will absorb all the way through as it stands in the refrigerator)

Absolutely stunning! I brought this to three diff. parties. Photos were taken by guests because they thought it was so gorgeous. Many rave reviews about the flavor and quality too! The chocolate leaves were fun for my girls to make and peel, that is the easy part. It IS time consuming with a lot of steps, but i have always made it late at night after everyone else is asleep. I think it is a personal preference whether you want it to have more of a coffee, alcohol or custard taste. These are all things that are adjustable in this recipe. I would personally cut down on the amount of custard between layers. Yes, it's expensive, but you get a big bang for the buck!

Rating: 4
I've made this dessert several times. I agree that it easily is the center of attention due to its grand presentation. The presentation and the taste will both overshadow anything else on the dessert table. I have found that I frequently do not have enough of the kahlua-espresso liquid mixture for soaking all of the ladyfinger cookies. If you run out midway through assmebling the dessert, it's really hard to stop everything to make more. So I recommend doubling the amount of this liquid mixture so that there's plenty on-hand while assembling the trifle.

Rating: 4
A major crowd-pleaser. People said it was "light"--ironic considering one bite could curtail the life of anyone with cardiovascular issues. Do not bring the trifle to an affair where more desserts are served unless you want the other dessert makers to feel inferior and inadequate. Only real caveat: could be vastly improved by using real espresso (or very strong coffee) instead of instant+water.

Also, be careful about over whipping the whipping cream!

Delicious and extremely rich! I agree with doubling the dipping liquid for the lady fingers, especially if you want to make them soft enough to curl around the outside of the dish. The eggnog portion took the most time and 12 egg yolks made my arteries clog just thinking about it. Next time I may skip this part and use store-bought egg nog to cut down on the time.

Boozy, but fantastic! I don't usually like to make desserts, but I can't stop making this one. This year I halved the recipe and made individual servings in martini glasses (laid the lady fingers out in fan shape, put 3 chocolate leaves on top). Just stunning! Beware, though, this has a lot of alcohol in it. Don't serve to kids or alcoholics. Also, double the ladyfinger-soaking liquid. I never have enough to soak them all the way through, and its one of the main features of the dish. I agree with previous reviewer that the cream part takes more than 5 minutes to thicken. Also - MAKE IT THE DAY BEFORE! It keeps very well overnight, and it's pretty time consuming, especially the first time you make it. Enjoy!

I have made this recipe for three Christmas's in a row, on request, for our family get together. The kind of lady fingers REALLY make a difference. I like the crisp "fingers" that Whole Foods sells. Last year I couldn't get them and got some so-called "ladyfingers" from the freezer case at the local grocery store. Like many I had to double the soaking liquid and trifle was a bit boozy and soggy. This year, same problem with lack of finger supply so I made my own. Turned out MUCH better and had a little soaking liquid left over. Used the recipe for lady fingers on joyofbaking.com - pretty easy. Have not had any trouble with eggs curdling; am really careful about not letting water boil or bowl touch. It takes WAY longer than 5 minutes!...20-25? I use a bowl, not a double boiler. Don't know if that makes a difference.

This is a really elegant dessert that is more tiramisu than eggnog. I layered the whipped cream instead of folding it into the custard and my family all agreed they liked the custard layer.

Incredible presentation and taste! Got lemon leaves at a local florist. Couldn't find the gold dust, but brushed the tips of chocolate leaves with melted chocolate and sprinkled with Christmas colored sprinkles, and it looked very festive! This was faster to make than other tiramisu recipes I have made, and the taste was better. I was afraid the taste of liquor would be too strong, but after the flavors had time to blend, it was perfect!

The chocolate leaves make this recipe unique. We had never ventured into the chocolate molding realm before this recipe, but it was surprisingly easy. Unfortunately, the catch is you have to have the leaves, and enough to make the number of chocilate leaves you want. We actually had a lemon plant that had the perfect size/shape leaves for this recipe. I think some specialty gourmet shops will sell leaves just for this use, but this is uncommon. This is a large recipe, and very "rich", so realize you could easily feed 10 people.

I made this last night and it was a BIG hit. I made the chocolate leaves because of the insistence of the other reviews. I am glad I did. I used Grand Mariner instead of brandy. I also used Lindt Intense Orange chocolate between the layers. YUM! Thanks also to the reviewer who mentioned getting the crisp Italian ladyfingers at Longs. They were perfect! I think the people who have tried this recipe and ended up with soup didn't thicken the egg mixture long enough. (I think the recipe said 5 minutes.) It took me about 15-18 moving the top part of the double boiler on and off the simmering water. Try this recipe! It is the BEST!

Absolutely fabulous......I triffled (No pun intended) with the recipe a bit. Used pound cake instead of lady fingers. After baking the cake in a loaf pan I sliced it in two pieces horizontally and then cut them into pieces like a biscotti. Then rebaked the pieces for 20 minutes. These are great by themselves. I din't use all the liquor as I took this to an Easter potluck where children were attending. I didn't use the allspice since it wasn't Christmas time, but will use it for that holiday. I layered it in the triffle bowl per the recipe but added a layer of sliced strawberries before each layer of the pound cake. Did not make the leaves but instead put a layer of unsweetened whipped cream on top. I ringed the center of the top layer of whipped cream with sliced and whole strawberries, then sprinkled the top with chocolate powder. Made it a day ahead and everything set up well. This recipe takes a hugh triffle bowl, which I didn't have, so I had a lot of basic topping left over that I will use to make individual tiramisu's. This would acutally be a very quick and easy recipe if you bought the pound cake.

The other reviews led me to believe that this would be super super difficult. The custard took longer to make than I anticipated, but the rest was pretty easy. Ricotta just costs too much, so I did a mix of cream cheese and sour cream instead. I also reduced the liquor as suggested by others (but could have probably left it alone) My family LOVED it! Many of them don't eat desserts, and it took awhile for people to break into it at Christmas, but as soon as people tasted it, it was soon gone, as rich as it is. i'd make it again!

I make the dessert for our family Christmas gathering every year (approx 20 people) and this year i served this as well as the triple chocolate peppermint cake. unfortunately the chocolate cake was the hands down winner (adults and kids alike). The trifle is good, simple to make, and very beautiful, but it has a very light flavor and texture - it mostly tastes like cream. the other downer is that it is expensive. I'm not sorry that i made it, but I probablly won't make it again.

thsi was ok. I makde the mistake of using a trifle bowl that was only 7 cups. Another problem was that I was away from home and used a fork instead of a wisk (not availbale in the kitchen). Some loved it, some said it was average. A lot of work for an ok dessert.

This recipe was very delicious and very easy to make. For the standard trifle bowl, you should only do half the recipe--it comes to within one inch of the top of the bowl. Should use slightly under 2 cups of the custard per layer--my top layer was short about 1/2 cup. Used exactly 30 hard ladyfingers, which I dipped quickly.

I followed other reviews and toasted the ladyfingers prior to dipping and left out some of the alcohol (strange for me), however, the ladyfingers were mushy at the bottom when I had more espresso mixture. Next time I will not dip them completely. Still, the taste was delicious and I got rave reviews from my guests.

This was a very elegant, delicious, and easy to make dessert. We halved the recipe and layered it in a regular glass bowl. Ran a little short on lady fingers since I, too, lined the sides of the bowl, but we cut the remaining fingers in half and it worked out fine. Didn't bother with the chocolate leaves, but it was still a very pretty dessert and a wonderful end to a tasty Christmas dinner.

This dessert was both delicious and glamorous. The chocolate leaves are really simple to make once you get started and they make the dessert a real eye opener(make them thicker than you might think at first as they can break when sticking them into the top). This was a hit at the New Year's Eve party to which I took it.

This was not nearly as difficult to make as I thought it would be. I had no problems with curdling and everything came together smoothly. As others suggested I cut the alchahol in half for a less boozey taste and did not use any in the whipped cream. I made this dessert because I loved the presentation, the leaves are really beautiful, however Tiramisu just isn't my ultimate dessert so for me this is a three star dessert.

I made this for last night's New Year's eve party --- and it was the hit of the party! The presentation, including the gold dusted leaves was magnificent. I left out the nutmeg from the recipe. I also made the mistake of lining the bowl with the ladyfingers standing up against the side of the bowl, and then layered about 5 laying across each layer of the cream. The look of the cream flowing down between each of the standing ladyfingers in the glass bowl seemed to add even more elegance! I used lemon leaves and regular semi-sweet chocolate bits. Truly a memorable dessert!

Definitely four forks! I made this for a Christmas buffet I was catering, and I caught one guest scraping the sides of the bowl after the trifle was gone. They were oohing and aahing. I had to do the chocolate leaves twice -- the first time I didn't put the chocolate on thickly enough, and they broke when I tried to peel the leaf off. It was definitely worth the trouble, though. The leaves make it look SO impressive.

Wonderful dessert...I cut in half to serve 8- 10. Also used Starbuck espresso and made the leaves. Leaves are a must!!!! Presentation was a "10" along with the taste!!

This was fairly easy to make and was delicious. A big hit on Xmas eve. I did not do the chocolate leaves..just dusted with cocoa and the chocolate. I loved the crunch the chocolate made when you bit into the dessert. I also very lightly dipped the ladyfingers in the espresso mixture...definitely did not soak them. I also did not cook the custard for 3 minutes at that temperature. I found that the temp kept rising and when it started curdling I took it off the heat. If you want the mascarpone/custard mixture to firm up, just put in the fridge. I also left the tiramisu out for a couple of hours before eating to get to room temperature. Yum! Making it 1.5 days in advance also helped the flavors!

I don't need to add to so many reviews that this dessert tasted great and had a great presentation. Just thought I would add that, after buying regular ladyfingers for this recipe and planning on not soaking them much to avoid the mush some reviewers wrote about, I happened to be at Longs Drug Store and I found crispy ladyfinger cookies there under the name of vicenzovo by Vicenzi. They seem to be exactly what the recipe calls for, crispy with a sugared side, and they did not get mushy in the finished dish. Hope this helps someone!

This was a smash hit at our Christmas dinner party and I would definitely make it again. The trifle was big tiramisu flavor and only suggestive of eggnog. One could get away with a bit less rum, kahlua, and brandy if you like a less boozy taste. I skipped the chocolate leaves and opted for putting fresh berries on top for color. One must be careful not to oversoak the ladyfingers when dipping into the coffee/kahlua. The recipe made more than enough to overflow my standard trifle dish, so I had extra cream leftovers. A super indulgant dessert!

This was the hit of my Holiday Party last week! I'm making it again for Christmas Day dinner! Easy to make with major presentation! I did not make the chocolate leaves, maybe next time. I still received oooohs and aaaahs before they even tasted it!

I halved the recipe and took note of the previous reviews - I cut down on the alcohol (just a little), took care not to soak the biscuits. It was delicious! And, to my surprise, my 5 and 7 year-olds loved it. A very nice Christmassy dessert!

I made this for my Companies cooking contest. It was fun and pretty straight forward to make. It also had a wonderful presentation and flavor. However, I made a couple of changes. I used 2 shots of freshly brewed espresso rather than instant when I dipped the Lady Fingers. Plus I did not use Brandy at all. I used Spiced Rum. Lastly, If your in to superior presentation, make the chocolate leaves. However, if time is short, make "Chocolate Galciers"...Meaning, make fun shapes on a cookie sheet with the chocolate rather than painting the leaves....

I made this for a neighborhood Thanksgiving get together and everyone was extremely impressed. It was relatively easy to make and the presentation is amazing. Most definitely a dessert I'd make again. The only minor complaint I had was that it tasted a little bit too much of the alcohol. Might reduce the brandy and rum next time.

I made this for a winter dinner party and it was fabulous. The chocolate leaves with gold dust were fun to make although it took me two tries to get the leaves thick enough. The first time I did not put enough chocolate on the camelia leaves and they broke when I peeled them off. I bought gold dust from King Arthur's baking catalogue and they added the perfect finishing touch to a beautiful, decadent, delicious dessert!

This was time consuming, but very fun to make. Well worth the effort. I would definitly make the chocolate leaves to go with it. They really make the presentation come together.

I made this trifle in lieu of a birthday cake for my mom's birthday party. This dessert was a HUGE hit! I omitted the nutmeg and used my own fresh esspresso to quickly dunk the ladyfingers making sure to cool it to room temp. I was cautious not to oversoak the ladyfingers so they wouldn't get mushy. I used mascarpone from an italian market in town which was quite expensive, about $18 just for the cheese....but worth it! This was suprisingly VERY easy to make.

Made this for Christmas. Got rave reviews. I also had to at least double the espresso/liquer. The ladyfingers soaked up too fast, some were to soggy to use. Great presentation though. Had to strip down my camilla plants, but worth it!!

I MADE THIS FOR AN ANNUAL NEW YEAR'S DAY PARTY FOR WHICH I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR DESSERT, THE RESPONSE WAS AMAZING. IN FACT ONE OF THE GUESTS WAS A CHEF FROM SWITZERLAND WHO SAID THAT THIS WAS BY FAR THE BEST TIRAMISU HE HAD EVER TASTED.

You can find lemon leaves at almost any florist shop. You have to wash them well because they're treated with a pesticide. Wipe each leaf with soapy water and follow with a vinegar/water rinse. Can't wait to make this again! I, too,had to double the amount of liquid to "dunk" the ladyfingers. And the gold dust was a very nice touch.

Rating: 4
Not being a dessert maker, I was surprized how easily this came together. The presentation is impressive, and the flavors are devine. I served this New Year's Eve, and, because I wanted to move away from the flavors of Christmas, I omitted the nutmeg and substituted several layers of fresh raspberries. The berries were a refreshing touch to a very rich dessert. My guests loved it.

Rating: 4
I also made this for Christmas and everyone loved it. I also made too much cream and agree that the ladyfingers should NOT be soaked. The leaves were difficult and I could only use 4. I could not find the camellia leaves. Could someone tell me where they found the leaves? I would definitely make it again.

Pretty good. Made the mistake of taking the excess coffee/liquor mixture and pouring the leftover down the sides. Way too much alcohol, overpowering the custard. And don't oversoak the cookies or they turn to mush.

used cream cheese with little whipping cream instead of marscapone, flavors were great but needed to be a little lighter tasting, I'll use less cream cheese next time

This is a visual delite as well as delicious. Be careful not to soak the lady fingers in liquid because everything will turn to mush. I learned the hard way and started over with the ladyfingers. The custard was straight forward and so was the chocolate leaves.

This dessert was a huge, smashing hit at a New Year's Eve celebration! Not only did it LOOK amazing, but it tasted fabulous as well. I will definitely make this dessert again!! I found that I had to make 2 batches of the coffee mixture for soaking the ladyfingers. The chocolate leaves added a stunning touch to the top. A wonderful recipe!!

I never give 4's but this one is a real winner. Made it as part of a New Year's eve progressive dinner dessert buffet and my neighbor's are still raving about it (some even came by the next day to trade leftover's because of it. Instant espresso is becoming hard to find, so made my own and did need a second batch. Soak time for the ladyfingers changes dramatically as the coffee cools (first biscuit almost disintegrated as I turned it over in the coffee - was able to salvage and enjoy on the spot!). What a fun dessert to make and eat. It will definitely go on the repeat list for spectacular desserts!

This dessert is rich, delicious, and has a beautiful presentation. The chocolate leaves are not as hard or time consuming as they seem. I melted the chocolate in the microwave; paint the leaves with a THICK layer of choc., so when hardened and you peel away the real leaf, the chocolate one won't break.

Very special. I used bittersweet Ghirardelli chocolate and ground it in the Cuisinart. Also used regular ladyfingers, but toasted them in the oven so that they would not get too soggy with the coffee/liqueur mixture. Did not make the chocolate leaves and it was still very pretty and so delicious. Worth the effort!

Bleh! I agree with the writer from Japan.... too rich! I prefer regular Tiramisu that uses only yolks and marscapone (and sometimes whipped egg whites). I also prefer regular trifle that has a "looser" custard/pastry cream. I thought the custard in this recipe was too dense although that may be my fault for not letting it sit out long enough before serving. RE: curdleing... this happened to me too, but I was able to save it by putting it over warm water and hand whipping it with a whisk. Next time it will be traditional Tiramisu or traditional trifle.

I love this recipe..but I have made it twice and it has curdled both times...each time when mixing the cheese and custard. I have let the custard cool and the cheese warm...anyone out there know why does this happens?

Not only would I make this again... I did! I was asked to make it for a friends Christmas Party (and it was THE hit!), but I made it again for my own family for Christmas. It is as spectacular as it is delicious! One thought in my house was to do half milk chocolate and half bittersweet leaves the next time... and I think I will.

Served this at a Dessert Party over the holidays - it was a hit. You need to double the espresso mixture and melted chocolate for the leaves. Takes at least a day to firm up.

Fantastic! My guests loved it. The chocolate leaves add a beautiful finishing touch, and they were so easy. I'm not much of a dessert maker, so I was a little intimidated, but it came out perfectly. (I did have to double the espresso mixture.)

Why grind semi-sweet chocolate chips when you can substitute Scharffenberger bittersweet instead? Also, be sure to really thicken the egg yolks, and make sure your 'fridge is very cold or it won't thicken well.

I was not impressed with this Tiramisu. I have been making the Tiramisu with Brandy for years now, and it is better. It is less time consuming and cheaper to make. I felt that the alcohol took away the coffee flavors. The Tiramisu with Brandy is found on this web site.

This is not a recipe if pressed for time but is well worth the effort. I didn't have time to make the leaves so I put Creme de Pirouline (wafer tubes filled with cream) sticking out of the top like a celebration. Everyone wanted the recipe.

Rather an ambitious project, but well worth it. I made it exactly as written, except for the chocolate leaves. It was a beautiful presentation even without them. I made this 24 hours ahead and it was outstanding. Even better the next day. I've always loved Tiramisu, and this recipe will be my base, even if I make it with variations (minus the nutmeg, marsala instead of rum, etc.). Your guests will be impressed!

Since I don't have a trifle dish, I used a big ramen bowl and came out with enough for 6 people. I cut the recipe in half. I used miniature baumkuchen pieces (castella cake would have worked too) and chopped up the choc. chips by hand since they got stuck in my grinder. This is terribly rich. Maybe I've been in Japan too long.

The chocolate leaves are edible. You peel the real leaf off after the chocolate hardens so only the chocolate in the shape of a leaf remains.

I made this for my boyfriend and it was a terrific hit. Since we were just, I cut the recipe in half. I used Bailey's for coffee liquor. I did use some semi-sweet chocolate but gave it a shake of cocoa powder so it wouldn't be too sweet. Fantastic!

This is wonderful, and surprisingly classic considering the unusual additions of rum and brandy. I did use Marsala instead of Kahlua, which may have tipped the flavors toward the traditional, but people adored this and it looked gorgeous. I'll certainly make this again whenever tiramisu is called for.

This is a fabulous recipe! I also made it for Thanksgiving as one of 3 desserts. Everyone wanted a scoop of this one! I made and assembled it at about 3:00am the morning of Thanksgiving, but I thought it tasted better the day after Thanksgiving. So next time I would make a full day or day and a half before serving. Usually I make tiramisu with cocoa powder instead of chocolate, but the crushed chocolate chips added a nice hint of crunch. I found 7.05 ounce packages of Vicenzovo ladyfingers at a local grocery for only $2.49 each. The chocolate leaves were much easier to make than I thought and greatly added to the presentation. This is not a cheap dessert (about $25 as I already had the alcohol), but it is beautiful and delicious. It will impress even the most discriminating guests!

I made this as one of 3 desserts for Thanksgiving. It was abolutely amazing and the first dessert eaten. I'm around sweets often and don't often think of eating them, but I was dreaming of this for a week after trying it. I made the custard three days ahead, then assembled the whole trifle two days before serving, letting it rest covered in the fridge. Skipped the chocolate leaves and it was beautiful on its own.
