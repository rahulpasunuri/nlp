This recipe was a disappointment, especially w/ the work involved. I purchased the whipping cream and 1/2 & 1/2 at the grocery store which unfortunately was ultra-pasteurized. If you could make the ice cream w/ organic pasteurized cream I have a feeling it would turn out better. I substituted peach schnapps for the essencia in the compote and it turned out well.

Can't rate it because I didn't make the whole thing. But did make the compote with one serious change. Didn't have the wine they suggested so used Triple Sec. Freaking awesome. Served it over vanilla icecream. Will try the entire recipe soon.

I tried this recipe using frozen blueberries instead of peaches--I did not cook the fruit--I blended the fruit, corn syrup, and sugar then added the cream and vanilla. Then I added it to the custard. The taste was wonderful--creamy, fruity--excellent!!! Not at all greasy or buttery. I can't wait to try other fruits!!

To the last entry-- I haven't made this recipe, but if you had globs of butter in your ice cream, you overchurned it. This is called "sanding." Any time ice cream is overchurned, it turns into butter. Try churning it for less time. It'll probably work out better.

I am very disappointed in this recipe... too much cream was not a good thing. Eating this ice cream is like eating a stick of butter... in fact there were globs of butter on the paddle. The peach flavor was excellent so I may try it again using half and half and milk rather than heavy cream. I am tasting it now and my spoon is all greasy.

It is the best peach ice cream that I have every tasted - very rich & creamy. This is my second peach season in making it.
