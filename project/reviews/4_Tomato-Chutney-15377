Made w/ ingredients as listed, but took 3 - 31/2 hours as other reviewers indicated. Served with baguette, roasted garlic, cambozola cheese and chutney. This has excellent flavor. I wish I had more summer tomatoes!

It took way longer for my mixture to reduce. Something closer to the neighborhood of 3hrs. But WOW! It is possibly the best thing on a burger.

Really good, cant believe I just found another recipe for an excess of tomatos ... only thing is, I had to simmer for at least 3 hours instead of the 11/2 it recommended.... but well worth it..

This recipe that has been a staple in my holiday/B'day gift baskets for 16 years! I put up large batches and always have on hand for such occasions. It's wonderful on everything from toast to tuna salad. Also makes an excellent BBQ glaze Just emulsify in the food processor and you're off and grilling!

A friend brought this by for a gift and it is really great. Nice heat from the ginger and hot peppers complimented by the sweet of the sugar and raisans. It was a great topper to baked halibut, I added a few olives for garnish. Mmmm!
