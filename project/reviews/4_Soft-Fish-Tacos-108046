A perfect battered fish. Not greasy. Flavorful! This beats many restaurant fish tacos. Just stay away from the sauce. It ruins the taco. Made it tonight with homemade salsa. Yum! I just made 2 changes. I used a pale ale and fried it in pecan oil instead and it still came out great!

What a great recipe. We made it tonight in honor of our trip to Key West. I don't eat wheat so I used spelt flour instead and used Cut Throat Porter for the beer. It gave a depth of flavor unmatched by tamer beers. I also do not eat milk products, so I made an aioli of sorts using 1/3 cup of canola mayo, 2 cloves of garlic pressed, juice of one half of a lime, a pinch of salt and 2 tsp of hot sauce. It was excellent! I also did not have an oil thermometer and used an old trick of putting a chopstick in the oil. When bubbles formed around the chopstick, I waited 2 more minutes then put in the fish. It worked like a charm!

Delish! Beer batter rocked, we dipped raw onion in the leftover batter. Very tasty onion rings. Oil was heated to a perfect fry & tortillas fresh from the oven with the sprinkle of water came out perfect. Didn't go with the ketchup sauce, topped with sour cream, lime juice, smoke Chipotle Tabasco as suggested from the experienced. Primo Pescado!

Wonderful recipe! Took the advice of a reviewer below and omitted the sauce, making it instead with sour cream, lime juice, and Smoked Chipotle Tabasco sauce. Delicious!

This is such a great batter for frying fish! I'm usually a really healthy eater, but this is a worthwhile exception. I used whole wheat flour and canola oil so I didn't feel quite as guilty. The sauce is kinda gross. It tastes exactly like mayo and ketchup mixed together (imagine that!). It got a little better when I mixed in lime juice, but I'd try something else next time.

I love, love, lOVE fish tacos! Since finding this recipe a few days ago, I've made them three times (even though my boyfriend doesn't share my enthusiasm). Changes I made to the recipe were NOT to include ketchup in the sauce (like so many other reviewers). Also, I grilled the fish instead of deep frying (tasted better, easier, and healthier...). Also, I pre-mixed the sauce with the cabbage, tomotoes, lime juice and hot sauce for equal distribution of the sauce. Next time, I'll try adding minced chipotle in the sauce as well as red onions. Served with black beans. YUM! Incidentally, the sauce, cabbage, tomato, lime combo tastes great mixed with rice and black beans.

Another San Diego transplant here. These were great--very similar to Rubio's. I didn't even bother with the mayonnaise sauce--sounded too sweet and greasy. Instead I diluted some sour cream with lime juice and spiked it with tabasco.

Lose the ketchup in the sauce and substitute chipoltles in adobo instead. The batter is delicious for both halibut and shrimp. And be sure to add shredded cabbage to your tacos. These are great!

Really fresh, tasty, and easy. We'll definitely make this one again. We made the fish as instructed, but substituted chipotle-ranch for the sauce (2 teaspoons ranch seasoning, 1/4 cup buttermilk, 1/4 cup mayo, and a couple chipotle chiles blended together). Topped with the cabbage and tomato, plus some avocado.

Changed a few things, as the other reviewers suggested: No ketchup, but substituted a bit of sirachi, chopped, seeded jalapeno, and used plain yogurt instead of mexican cream. For fish, I used swordfish and marlin and marinated that with 1/2 lime, juiced. I also substitued red cabbage for green and juiced a half of lime with sirachi and chopped cilantro in cabbage mixture. Delicious!!

I just used the recipe for the sauce part - was making my own version of tacos with marinated salmon and shredded cabbage. For the sauce, I did use the equal parts mayo and sour cream (instead of the crema,) and 1/2 as much ketchup, plus juice of 1/2 lime and about 1 teaspoon chopped chipotle pepper. It was awesome after the chipotle was added!! Truly different and yummy. Husband and kids loved it!

Quite delish. I didn't have any Crema so I used sour cream, mayo, (no Ketchup!) and lime, then I added serrano pepper chopped up. I had some extra pre-shredded cabbage from a coleslaw I made for a bbq, so I used that, tomatoes, diced onions, salsa verde and more lime as my toppers. They are super messy, so we did them as flat stacked "enchiladas."

Made this for my cajun mother-in-law. Went over great!!! Used Tony Chacheres instead of salt, and a lot of it in both batter and sauce. Non-fat sour cream worked instead of crema mexica. Only prob was the batter started falling off of the fish. I have since invested the $10 in the fry thermometer (candy thermometer with a clip), and expect that to fix problem.

these fish tacos are now a favorite of the family. however, i leave out the ketsup and mayo, and just mix sour cream with siracha chili sauce and it is great, also adds a bit more spice to it.

I made these last night with some homebrew, and it was amazing. My only suggestion is to leave out the ketchup, as others have noted. Use either lime/lemon juice or vinegar and hot sauce to taste instead. I also added a pinch or two of hot curry to the batter for flavor and kick. These are also excellent with salsa verde on top.

Made these for my boyfriend and we both loved them. Used mexican crema, Tapatio hot sauce, cilantro and lime juice for the sauce. Topped with shredded cabbage, tomato, and more cilantro. Will make again for sure.

Delicious meal. Followed reviewer's excellent advice & subbed taco sauce for the ketchup. But I did have a problem keeping the coating on the fish (prior to frying)-it didn't diminish the flavor, but would love to hear from the experts out there why this happened. Used highest quality ingredients & followed recipe carefully. Thanks.

My husband and I absolutely loved this recipe! I think next time, however, I will try adding salsa (instead of ketchup) and maybe some green chiles to spice it up a litte bit as was suggested by some of the other reviewers, but I would definetely make this again.

I join the folks who say, "Loose the ketchup"....please! We make fish tacos similar to this recipe....my husband's favorite meal...after HE perfected at home the dish he often eats at a Deming, New Mexico restaurant. The mayo gets its "heat" from an addition of chiptole powder. We shred some green cabbage a-la-cole-slaw size, and blend with the mayo mix. Then we "short-cut" the process with frozen filets of battered fish, which only take about 20 min. to cook. Some grated sharp cheddar and red salsa, medium, are the toppings. I like the hard taco shells, which we use at home, just a taste preference on my part. Hubby likes the two layers of soft corn tortillas as this recipe suggests....which is more than likely the "original" way of serving fish tacos.

This was fantastic! Great for a group (though would need to double or triple). Worth the trouble (and fat) of frying the fish, but steamed would be fine too.

What is up with the mayo, catsup & crema Mexicana? It made a nice pink flavorless goop. I don't know where this one came from but it just is'nt right. Try adding lime juice & fresh tomatillo sauce to the mayo & crema for the true Baja experience. Oh and leave out the catsup.

I made this recipe for Cinco de Mayo - it was a major hit with my family. I used Halibut and Seabass (from Trader Joes), cut it into cubes, seasoned with lime, sea salt, pepper and cayenne. Used Negra Modelo for the beer (one for me, one for the batter.) I skipped the sauce - we're a NO MAYO family. Served with warmed corn tortillas, shredded cabbage, mexican cheese blend, homemade salsa, guacamole and sour cream. The batter wasn't too oily which can ruin fried food. Very tasty!!

I was craving some San Diego fish tacos and happened to find some fresh Red Snapper, and thought, "hey, I could make fish tacos with this." Everything turned out tasty except for the ketchup in the sauce. It threw the whole reminiscent flavor off, it cheapened it somehow. If I were to do this again, which I will, I will just mix some Crema, mayo and lime together. For condiments I offered diced onion, tomato, cabbage(green), shredded cheese, cilantro, salsa verde (the one from Trader Joe's is great!) and some hot local salsa. As a result it was delicious, but it was super messy so I had to eat it with a fork and knife!

I'm from San Diego as well. I recommend the following condiments for fish or other tacos: Minced and mix fresh onions, cilantro, serrano pepers. I am used to the hot stuff though so I add a pepper medley with serrano, jalapeno, and a touch of habanero. Also I find warming the corn tortillas on a comal or griddle and using two to wrap the tacos works better.

I made this tonight and it is totally EXCELLENT, even though I only loosely followed the directions. For the cream sauce, I had about the right amount of left-over H/M tartar sauce, so I used medium-hot picante sauce to replace the ketchup. Couldn't find dark beer, so I used Miller's Lite. Also used pollack instead of halibut, and oven broiled/baked the fish on the center oven rack at 475 degrees until done. Used the suggestion from "A Cook from Long Beach on 6/25/03" about the cabbage marinate, except that I used green cabbage instead of red--it was very bitter, so I added some apple cider to the balsamic vinegar marinate. The last thing I did differently was to use hard taco shells. THIS IS A RECIPE NO ONE CAN SCREW UP!!!

My husband was stationed in San Diego and also missed Rubios for it's Fish Tacos. I scoured the web trying to find a recipe worthy of his taste buds. My grocer didn't carry Halibut so I used fresh Mahimahi (which is like Swordfish and is abundant here in Hawaii). The fish was delicious nonetheless. I took the advice from other reviewers and made my own version of sauce by combining mayo, buttermilk and sourcream all in 1/4 cup measurements w/ some drops of fresh lime juice, I kicked it up by adding some roughly chopped cilantro (also set some aside for the taco). In addition to the hot sauce we used green tabasco for that added kick. I served with the easy to prepare Spicy Rice from Mahatma, and ice cold Coronas and lime. My husband's craving for Fish Tacos were satiated and the cook got a well deserved KISS. -j

I made this recipe "as is" and I think that although it is tasty, it needs a little kick (spice). I'll follow the other reader's ideas next time. In Alaska, fish tacos are very popular and are made with Halibut or Salmon.

Great taste, easy to make, easy to eat. The sauce with Crema Mexicana is a must and was so popular I had whip up extra. You can't know what you are missing unless you try the sauce.

These tacos are great, used striped bass just caught. The batter is great, but the mixture of different toppings as recommended by all other reviewers made the dish. Don't forget to put fresh cilantro out, it was a great topping combined with fresh lime juice-also made marinated red cabbage and tomatoes (balsamic), an additional white sauce, green salsa, all excellent. I diluted sour cream with lowfat buttermilk instead crema mexicana-worked out fine. This recipe is a keeper.

Delicioso! Having moved to Montana it is not easy to find good fish tacos and this was a huge hit! We used halibut my husband had caught in Alaska and "Pride of the West" brand fish batter with beer instead of the flour mixture in the recipe. Served with a light romaine-cilantro-jicama salad on the side and mojitos to drink. A perfect summer dinner.

Oh, how I miss San Diego! Rubios was always my "morning after the night before" food - but since I moved to Cananda I haven't be able to enjoy one of my favorite ways to eat fish. This saved me. Don't substitute lettuce for cabbage, it really adds to the flavor. And to those in California... know how lucky you are!

I live in the Baja and these rival the stands. I did change the sauce a little. I eliminated the catsup and used minced chipotles in adobo instead for some kick. I also used green cabbage, more authentic.

Better than any restaurant fish taco, in my opinion! A little tip for your red cabbage garnish, add some sliced cherry tomatoes to it and marinate both in some balsamic vinegar with salt and pepper. My husband loved it and it was a great addition to the taco. Be sure to serve your tacos alongside the toasted garlic rice with herbs and lime (Bon Appetit, March 2003).

If you can't find "crema" dilute sour cream with butter milk or half and half, also use green cabbage and don't forget to use a "tomatillo" based salsa if you can find it, if not any good hot sauce will do and also a squeeze of fresh lime and ofcourse, a nice Corona cerveza! I'm also from San Diego and this is a GREAT recipe if you can't go to mexico or have a "RUBIOS FISH TACOS" near you.

I have been making this recipe for years and just love it! I make a different sauce than the one noted though. I use sour cream, lime juice, rough chopped cilantro & a little cajun seasoning (such as Tony Chachere's...if you can't find that Old Bay will do fine). This sauce is delicious. You can add some of the cajun seasoning into the batter as well. I have always made them with green cabage as well, but think red would be comparable. I usually heat up some black beans with this (mashing about half), adding garlic & finely diced hot pepper for a kick & top it off with some of the same cilantro-lime cream to cool the spice & balance flavors. Grill or broil some whole scallions (removing most of green top)and you are in for a real treat!

Very good recipe. Nice change of pace. As suggested, I used plain yogurt, and I also added some hot sauce to the dressing. I had to use Orange Roughy, as my grocery store didn't have any fresh halibut. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. For me, it didn't matter how I cut the fish.

fish tacos are my favorite, but skip the catsup. Use a blend of mayo and crema. I also use green cabbage. Real crema is easy to prepare. Add a TBS of butter milk to a cup or more of room temp heavy cream. (Not sterilized whpping cream) Cover with a clean towel and let sit overnight in a warm place. It is heavenly.

Ahh... one of my favorite things in the world... FISH TACOS!! *grin* Growing up in San Diego and making lots of trips to Baja, Mexico, these were pervasive in my childhood, and this recipe is one the money. Creme Mexicana can be hard to find; plain yogurt works great. I'm always a little amused at my East Coast friends' reactions to the 'fish taco', which usually ranks right up there with raw sewage pipelines bursting within 2 meters. But, discard your learned food aversion, and dig in! These are VERY GOOD!

After living in San Diego, I'm a fish taco afficionado and I have to say that this recipe is nearly right on the money. If you don't mind deep fat frying, it's very easy! Only thing I'd change next time is the sauce -- I like "white" sauce, in keeping with my favorite fish tacos from San Diego, and this one is more of a "pink" sauce, but it captures the spirit of the traditional topping.

Rating: 4
Awesome! I offered plain yogurt instead making the crema sauce because I really wanted the fish flavor to come through. I've used the batter recipe for other fish dishes. Easier than I thought! The secret is to make sure you let your oil heat up to temp. between batches.

First, I did change a couple of the ingredients, so I'm rating based on that. Only minor changes. I couldn't get any halibut at the time, so used catfish. No Mexican crema, so used sour cream. And used green leaf lettuce since I had it. So, with all that, these were really great tacos. I wasn't sure about "fish" tacos when I heard about them, but so glad I tried this recipe. Will make this again!
