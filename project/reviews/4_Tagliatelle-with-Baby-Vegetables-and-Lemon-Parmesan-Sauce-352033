I used 5 cloves of garlic, and switched out beans for bell peppers, but this was pretty good. And simple. Given previous reviews, I was wary of using the pasta water, but, in my case, adding it was what finally turned the sauce light and creamy. Good recipe to use up veggies in the icebox.

Delicious summer meal! I used frozen baby peas instead of beans, and it turned out quite well. Will definitely make this again!

We really enjoyed this meal! I added alot of pepper and red pepper flakes which made it tangy and peppery. We really liked it!! Only used about a cup of the pasta water and simmered it for about 15min to get it a bit thicker. Didn't have Tagliatelle noodles so used Egg noodles. Can't wait to make it again!

Hmmm. I wanted to love this. But the cream and water with lemon juice was runny and the cheese clumped all over the veggies. It never really became a sauce, ultimately and I think it needs more flavor than just cheese and veggies. Fresh herbs and/or garlic maybe. I'm going to check that I wouldn't make it again, but I may do so with a LOT of alterations to this recipe.

As other reviewers have noted, this is fresh and bright. I used fresh haricots verts instead of frozen, adding them in with the zucchini and onions. I also used half-and-half instead of heavy cream to try to lighten it, and it worked nicely. This is a great basic recipe that could be changed to suit the contents of your fridge - the best kind of recipe!!

This recipe makes you forget about the weary winter. I used a Mandolin to slice small zuccini and substituted 2 handfuls of petite peas for the beans & added fresh mushrooms. I finished the dish with additional grated fresh lemon peel on top. Light, with definition of the delicate flavor of each ingredient. A keeper for sure.

Absolutely delicious. The flavors were clean and simple. I made home made pasta and added fresh shrimp I tossed with a little salt and pepper and lemon juice. Cooked until just pink and added last.

I actually left the pasta out and made zucchini "ribbons" with asparagus pieces in the lemony cream sauce. Very nice for spring.

This is a great tasting weeknight recipe. I made it exactly as described. The baby zucchini cook up very fast as I sliced them thinner than just halving them. The lemon makes this perfect for spring. Next time I will add other veggies I have on hand as I think the sauce goes well with just about any veggie.

This was fantastic! It was satisfying but not too heavy and had a fresh, Spring-like flavor. I didn't use baby zucchini, I just sliced 2 regular zucchini into 1/4 in. thick slices. Otherwise, I made as written and was very pleased with the results.
