We really enjoyed this one. I made a few changes: 1) cubed the tenderloin, tossed it with the spice-oil mix and threaded on skewers 2) thought it over decided thyme was the best choice of herb and color, and 3) since my homegrown tomatoes were pretty ripe and juicy, I added about 2T tomato juice. All worked great and will do again. Served with couscous - which was great with tht tomatoes. Oh, I also took out the slivers of garlic after the tomatoes had cooked down, chopped a few, and added some of them back in. Perfecto.

This recipe has become a staple -- I've used the rub on a variety of meats and the garlic tomato sauce a number of different ways. I occasionally sub in cherry or grape tomatoes for half or all of the tomatoes and it give a different, interesting texture. This is easy and delicious!

Simple and delicious recipe. Made this on a weekend camping trip with friends. Grilled the pork over an open campfire and cooked the sauce in a cast iron skillet alongside. Everyone loved it.

Quick. Easy. Delicious. This dish has become a part of the regular menu in my household. I double up on the spice mixture for the tenderloins simply because we like it spicey. My 5 year old even enjoys it. Sauce mixture is lacking slightly in presentation, but the taste, once the flavors are combined makes up for any shortcomings.

Easy and bursting with flavor. The pork stayed moist. The sauce was a nice compliment to the pork. Everyone liked it even the family's adult fussy eater.

We were very disappointed with this dish. Very bland and boring.

Very tasty and easy to make. Good enough to serve to guests but easy enough to make for a weeknight meal. Served with rice & brocolli. The sauce is good with the rice, too. I agree with a previous review ... sauce could use improvements visually.

Very tasty! I made the dish exactly as the recipe was written. Next time, I will add some fresh basil to the tomato mixture -- to give a little more flavor and better visual presentation.

YUMMY...WE WILL CERTAINLY MAKE THIS AGAIN! Since it's still winter tomato season, I used 2 cans diced recipe-ready tomatoes instead of fresh and it was delicious. My tenderloins were also over 1lb each so I doubled the seasonings and grilled longer. My husband cooked on his Weber charcol grill as follows: Split grill...coals on 1/2 nothing on the other. Grilled 3 1/2 min. a side on direct and then 12-15 min. on the indirect side tented with foil. Internal temp @150 deg. Let stand covered for about 10 min.

Quick and excellent. I will cut back on the cayenne for the kids tenderloin next time; they still enjoyed it, just not as much as they could have. The cinnamon adds nice depth and makes this dish much more interesting. We always add additional garlic, but I will toss it in the chopper if I'm making a quick family dinner; for guests the slices show beautifully in the sauce. It's a wonderful recipe that has authority (zip, zing, punch) without quite going over the top.

A lot of flavor for such minimal effort and few ingredients. Served with green beans and roasted sweet potatoes.

This is a very delicious preparation for pork tenderloin. We loved the spice rub combination with the tomato garlic sauce, it was a great balance. It was wonderful with the Orzo with Everything recipe also on this site.

I made this for a dinner party, exactly as written. Everyone loved it! Used garden tomatoes. The leftovers the next day were even tastier!

I have made this a couple of times and it always gets raves. I used twice the amount of rub and twice the amount of sauce (with extra garlic and canned diced tomatoes)for a package of two tenderloins. A very easy dinner to make after work.

I made this with the recommended cinnamon and thought it was delicious--my whole family raved about it. Even better the second day!

Very easy and absolutely delicious. I followed other reviews and reduced the amount of cinnamon - I used 2/3 the amount suggested and it tasted perfect. Also, when I heated up the left-overs, I added a bit of brown sugar to the sauce, which really gave it a nice flavor.

I made this for my husband and I using boneless center cut pork chops and we both liked it. Next time I will reduce the amount of cinnamon and add more garlic. If using 2 tenderloins you will need to double the rub ingredients.

I made this a couple of nights ago. The rub on the meat was fantastic. But even better was the tomato sauce that goes over it, I left out the cinnamon, just seemed wrong and didn't measure the other spices but just added to taste and whoa!! did it turn out great. Gonna use the sauce today as the tomato sauce in a dish of lasagna, should prove to be wonderful.

This was easy and delicious. The spices were perfect for me and my family but if you prefer really spicy, you'll probably want to use more cayenne. I didn't have enough fresh tomatoes on hand so I used a can of diced. It was still good, though I plan to use fresh next time. My teenagers loved it!

I have to agree with those who thought it needed more salt, but that's easily remedied. This was easy, delicious and tender. Just be sure you don't overcook it. The quality of the tomatoes makes a big difference for the sauce. I used fresh, locally grown ones.

This is a great recipe, except the cinnamon throws it off to me. I subbed oregano in the sauce, keeping the rub part the same to make it more of a Mexican flair. Browned the pork in a grill pan and threw it in the oven for about 10 minutes.

3 1/2 forks! Easy, quick, and delicious! I agree with the other reviewers when they say to add more spices, especially salt. I served this entree with brown jasmine rice. My boyfriend and I loved it!

This was so easy and delicious. The pork turned out tender and flavorfull. Served it with spagetti w/parmesan and steamed brocolli...

The spices are great - just need more of them, a touch more salt in the sauce too. There is also a Tomato Chile Jam on this site that works great with pork too. Either are terrific with this meat.

Quick and simple. Our first thought was "A taste of the Caribbean". We substituted w/boneless loin pork chops and one can of petite diced tomatoes with all other ingredients the same. Side was, believe it or not, Chicken Rice-a-Roni which was a perfect complement. Add a small green salad and voila'! Definite keeper!!

This dish was very nice. I doubled the spices and oil for the tenderloin since I had two relatively large pieces in the package I purchased. I used gorgeous tomatoes from the farmers market but added more salt at the end to boost the flavor, which, despite the spices, turned out a bit bland. A very easy, satisfying cooking experience.

SOOO simple and good - can't wait till we have fresh tomatoes from the garden. We like spicy food, so I would double the amount of cayenne.

This was incredibly easy and quite tasty. My husband loved it! I substituted canned tomatoes, and I'm sure fresh would have added a bit, but the flavors were great. Definitely recommend it for an easy meal. I used half the recipe amount for a small 1lb tenderloin, so I think the recipe should work well as written for 2lbs.

This is actually receives 3 1/2 forks! This was extremely quick & easy to prepare, and it was surprisingly delicious as well. I followed the recipe precisely this time around, although the rub for the tenderlion only coated one, not two tenderlions as the recipe called for. The tomato garlic sauce was spicey, with the cumin and cinnamon addeding a unique flavor. I served this with a rice pilaf. I will definately prepare this dish again! My family loved it.
