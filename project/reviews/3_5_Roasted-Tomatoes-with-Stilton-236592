I made this recipe with some trepidation. The cheese was unfamiliar to me and we have a few who don't eat tomatoes. Couldn't believe how fast these got eaten up, by tomato lovers and NOT! Everyone thought they were lovely - and would be a nice addition to an antipasto plate.

This is so delicious! I'm so happy that I have this exceptionally easy and no-fail vegetable side for these chilly winter months. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.

this has possibilities - but the oven temperature and the cooking time - had my tomaoes burnt to a crisp - will try lower temp and less cooking tine and review again

Divine. We roasted with skins on and seeds in which made these a cinch to prepare. Really festive on the Christmas table. Unfortunately no leftovers! So easy to make though, like others have said, will make often just to have on hand to add to sandwiches, pasta, on a baguette...

Used all of the ingredients except the Stilton cheese, because we had Scalloped Yukon Gold and Sweet Potato Gratin as an additional side and I didn't want the Stilton and Gruyere competing with eachother. I added Balsamic Vinegar to the marinade and before roasting added fresh basil leaves to each tomato half. These came out absolutely delicious. Served at room temperature as suggested. Today with leftovers we had them as a garnish on sandwiches. I'm going to make these again to have on hand because they will add some zip to salads, sandwiches and omelettes.

This was really simple and just great. I would make this any time of year, but it was nice little bit of summer in the cold of winter.

My Mother and I made this for Christmas - the flavors are fantastic!!! It's a little time consuming to make but well worth it with a holiday meal.

I have made this several times, using fresh summer tomatoes, and awful, hard winter tomatoes. It is amazing what slow roasting can do to bring out the wonderful tomato flavor, even with bad tomatoes! This is a dish that can be used as a side with casual BBQ, or with a dressy dinner like prime rib. High recommend this recipe!

Fantastic. Made these with Campari tomatoes from Sam's and even my none tomato loving son thought they were great. The long cooking gave a great caramelized flavor even to tomatoes in December in Ohio! I didn't remove the seeds and membranes. It was a great side to roasted rack of lamb. The rest of the family wasn't greatly impressed with the watercress even though it was great stuff from Whole Foods. Next time I might use baby spinach leaves for the same color contrast and much lower $$. I did use less Stilton than indicated-just crumbled on what looked good. Will definitely be making again!

Great mix of flavors.

Wow. I made this for Christmas dinner. It was simple and elegant. It is a little rich and as another reviewer noted, you don't need as much cheese. I'm going to make it again for New Year's Eve.

I've made these tomatoes dozens of times since Christmas, 2006. I've used various kinds of blue cheese, and they've always been wonderful. A nice change for a winter vegetable.

I forgot to add -- had some leftover from the second time I made them. Cooked up some pasta, chopped up the tomatoes and tossed with the pasta. EXCELLENT!

Excellent! Made this for a Christmas in July dinner since tomatoes are plentiful this time of year. Used arugula instead of watercress because I have it growing in the garden. 4 ounces of cheese is WAY too much for just 12 tomatoes. I did about 40 tomatoes and don't think I used 4 ounces on all those! Great make ahead dish and served at room temp. Looks pretty, too! A keeper recipe for sure!

I thought these tomatoes were delicious. The second time I made them I added a little white balsamic vinegar to the marinade, and after roasting, sprinkled some chiffonaded fresh basil on them. Easy and delightful!

I did not see this recipe as special at all. Kind of a waste of time. Made it exactly as printed.

Something different to liven up you tomatoes on your table. Makes an excellent side dish or salad course. I used these as my salad course (with lots of watercress) in a 7 course meal for New Years Eve. I would definently make again!

We made this dish to add color to our Christmas table (main dish was rib roast). It was the hit of dinner, I used about 1/4 of the called for cheese because some guests were not strong cheese fans but they and everyone else raved about them. There were no leftovers, plan on at least a tomato per person.

These were spectacular! I really had my doubts that store bought winter blah tomatoes could taste so great! But they are more like a marinated, carmelized version of sun-dried tomatoes. Outstanding. I didn't tweak the recipe in the least. Evryone raved about them.

Simple and a great addition to a dinner plate for color and interest. The flavor is a hit too.

These are a delicious and attractive accompaniment to prime rib roast. The marinade is perfect and really gives a great flavor to the tomatoes.

I have made this recipe four times in the past month; everyone has loved it. Personally, I prefer the tomatoes warm, but they were still quite good at room temperature. It is very important that the oven temp is correct, the olive oil will burn any higher (I learned that my oven was actually 450 when I set it to 350!). It is not necessary to drizzle the remaining marinade over the tomatoes, either, which can significantly reduce the amount of olive oil that you need.

This recipe was so-o easy and tasty. Served with grilled steak topped with oregano and olive relish (this site). Together with roasted asparagus, made a delicious Christmas eve dinner.

Super easy and super good! I have served these warm and at room temperature. The stilton adds a great punch and the color makes for a beautiful presentation this time of year. I like the amount of pepper and even added a little more rosemary than called for. I was surprised by the roasting time .. but it works!

Not impressed at all. Plus I think there has to be a mistake in the directions. How could anybody use 1-1/2 tsp of pepper on 12 plum tomatoes without calling the recipe "pepper roasted tomatoes"? It seemed like way too much for me and I used less than half the amount specified. The resulting roasted tomatoes were alright but nothing special.

An extremely tasty and attractive side-dish. Made this last evening to accompany a standing rib roast. The marinade adds a much needed flavor boost to ho-hum off season tomatoes. I loved the addition of the stilton, but you could easily substitute any other blue-veined cheese. My only regreat was having to spend so much at the market on supposed vine ripened tomatoes that in reality had zero flavor. Had it not been for the delicious marinade and slow-roast, they would have been an utter waste of money. Will definitely be making these again and can't wait to try them on the grill as well. anncancook
