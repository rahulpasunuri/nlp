I was looking for a high-iron recipe to combat anemia during pregnancy. What a hit! I loved this, and so did my husband! I followed the recipe, except that I made my own pizza dough in the bread maker (should be the same as the store bought stuff) and didn't need to warm it up first because it came out warm. Based on other reviews, I made sure to cook down the juices by removing the chard after it wilted and reduced the juices in the pan to a couple TBLS. and then added that to the chard; also didn't need extra salt with the clams, cheese and bacon. Pizza came out moist and flavorful, leftovers were good too. Now that I know how to make it, it should be a pretty easy recipe to go to for a weeknight meal as well.

Although I have never made this recipe as specifically written, the dough and preparation method form the basis for a multitude of options since you can easily change around the toppings. I have taken the base recipe and used things like: - Pan-seared shrimp, collard greens and crimini mushrooms - Crimini mushrooms, kale and caramelized red onions in balsamic vinegar I have made this in a couple of pans, but my favorite is a heavy 13" cast iron pan with high sides. If you have picky kids, you can always make 1/2 or 3/4 of it what you want and do simple mozzarella cheese on the other part.

Absolutely wonderful and sooo easy!! We substituted chicken for the clams. We will definitely make this again, perhaps with cheese and pepperoni. LOVE IT LOVE IT

We modified the recipe a little with what we had on hand. Like using spinach and onions, we added some spicy vinegar to the greens and substituted Spanish chorizo for bacon. We also used pecorino cheese and made it with thin crust on our pizza stone. It was very tasty and we will make it again.

This recipe could have been very satisfactory if the proportions of ingredients are accurate. For pizza lovers everywhere learnaboutpiza.com is always there

This is an excellent recipe concept. However, I am not sure the developer 'made' the recipe. The clam juice amount is too much. It needs to be cooked down to a concentrate, to perhaps 1 Tbsp. There is NO need for Salt&Pepper as the Clams & Parmesan Cheese are salty enough. If you are using less than a 12"skillet, you will need to pinch off some of the dough and perhaps make another pizza style. I will adjust and definitely make it again.

Cooking times on the recipe are much too short, make sure to cook down the clam juice for some time so you don't have pizza soup. Also it helps break down the kale more so its not so chewy. Also this is a legit pan pizza which means it takes time to bake in the oven, not the 10 mins it states so make sure to let it bake and not just pull it out per the timing in the recipe. You will have a doughy pizza! But its a great recipe for flavor!
