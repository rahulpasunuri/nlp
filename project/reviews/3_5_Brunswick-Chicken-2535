One of my favorite recipes for when the weather turns cooler. I make and serve the recipe as written for dinner the first night, then shred the leftover chicken and add more chicken broth to make a great stew for the next day and night.

This is a great winter stew--hearty and filling, yet not heavy like cream soups. I made a few changes since I wanted it between a soup and stew in terms of consistency. I added an extra can of tomatoes, a half cup or so of chicken broth, and I shredded the chicken. Sometimes I like to add potatoes which is a nice touch as well.

My mother-in-law first introduced me to Brunswick Stew including having it with squirrel meat, in Dundus, VA, in the late 60's. Since retiring back home to Sacramento I have fixed it a couple of times for friends and it has always been a big hit. Additional ingredients she always used were Okra (1cup diced), celery (2 or 3 stalks diced), Hot sauce or red pepper to taste. She also insisted on frozen Butter Beans/Baby Limas instead of canned Limas and fresh or frozen corn instead of canned. Being lazy I substitute boneless chicken breast and thighs, half skinless, got'ta have a little of that chicken fat.

My husband was cooking and found this recipe. It was great. He also used boneless chicken breasts I think around 1 1/2 pounds or so. It is suprisingly tasty. I came back on line so we could make it again. A keeper for everyday dinners.

This is definitely a keeper! Preparation takes no time at all and it was a hands down success. I used two cans of tomatoes instead of one and served Jasmine rice as well.

This was a very tasty dish. I used 1-1/2 lbs. of boneless skinless chicken cubed (too lazy to mess with the whole bird) with no loss in flavor.

So easy to make and my 3 year old ate it! Definitely give it a try.

Good basic recipe. I used thighs instead of breasts for the texture and to give a sweeter taste. I also used frozen corn which worked nicely. I splashed about 1/4 c. white wine before simmering which added flavor, and a pinch of chipotle powder to make it interesting.
