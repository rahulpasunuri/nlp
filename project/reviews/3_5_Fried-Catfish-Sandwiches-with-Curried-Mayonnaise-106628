This is my go-to recipe for fried fish. The curry mayo is of course the key, very nice and about as easy as it gets. I've used a variety of different fish, even boneless trout, and it's always good. I add a spoon of curry into the flour mixture and make half the amount of flour mixture because it's always way too much. Once, I used buttermilk instead of milk but honestly I couldn't tell the difference.

It was good, curry brings out great flavors in the catfish. Everyone in my family loved it. I used a lot more curry, fresh catfish (soaked in milk for 1/2 hr.) and a softer bun. Next time I would double batter it.(dip fish in plain flour, then in a beaten egg -not milk- then in the flour/cornmeal) because as it cooked, most of the coating fell off. Over all good meal.

This was extremely tasty and super easy. I used a bunch more curry than was called for in the recipe and that turned out to be a good movie.

Not good... The fish was excellent; I liked the crust. But the sauce was strangely bland - the curry and mayonnaise didn't seem to work; they were mixed together but flat, and the lemon didn't do anything.

Although I love fried catfish, I've never attempted it until today - this was delicious! We are cutting down on carbs, so I skipped the sandwich portion of the recipe. I would definitely do this again, and look forward to a carb "splurge" day when I can have the sandwich!

I am very picky about catfish. We happily ate this for 2 nights. I also took a sandwich for lunch. My fiance was unhappy when we finished it. I used a dill sauce found on this site instead of the curry. Delicious!

This is a WINNER!

I followed the recipe except I used onion hamburger buns and fresh cilantro instead of the lettuce. The curried mayonnaise makes this sandwich sublime. Don't skimp on the curry powder - it really makes a difference. Will be making this again and again. I've fried catfish before but really liked the half cornmeal, half flour texture. The fish itself was so good I was eating nibbles of it while I assembled the sandwich - when does that ever happen?
