This is a very easy delicious version of applesauce. The lemon juice gives the apples a nice tart finish. I followed the recipe as written and did not find it to sweet with the amount of sugar called for. I used fresh ginger root and cut it into little pieces. I also let the apples cook on low until they because sauce on their own and did not puree it.

simply excellent. I made it exactly as written, several times. I'm not sure what savory is, so I used fresh sage from the garden. I also didn't puree, just mashed with a potato masher.

A light, flavorful recipe. I did adapt it some, to make it less sugary. The changes were: instead of 1 cup of sugar, 1/4 cup; instead of 3/4 cup of lemon juice, 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar. The additions were: a cinnamon stick, a bay leaf, and about a teaspoon of ground allspice. Instead of putting in a chunk of ginger, I chopped it into small pieces. When the apples were cooked, I fished out the cloves, bay leaf and cinnamon stick, and left in the ginger, while mashing the apples still in the pot with a wooden spoon. No ricing or straining was required.

So simple, but so good! Made it for two different potlucks to accompany pork, and it was a hit both times. Straining didn't work well, and I don't have a food mill, so I simply removed the cloves and ginger and used a potato masher. You have to peel and core carefully to use this technique, but it works.
