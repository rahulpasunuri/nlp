Simple. Delicious. Loved it. Obsessed with Anchovies right now. Glad to work them into a salad like this. We used a whole 2oz can. Yum.

A lovely refreshing summer potato salad. We have an excellent fishmonger nearby, so I used their house-made white anchovies. Otherwise I followed it to the letter.

Best potato salad. Omitted the anchovies and added chopped parsley with the other herbs. So good and easy. Even better the next day. Everyone always raves about this.

So good and SUCH a better alternative to the potato salad with mayonnaise. I doubled the amount of anchovies and did not need to add any salt. After I chopped the anchovies, I smushed them with my knife blade to make it more of an anchovy paste, that mixed in nicely with the rest of the ingredients.

This reminded me of the French potato salad served with a salad Nicoise. We enjoyed it while still warm with dinner last night, and found this afternoon that the flavors hold up beautifully when it's chilled. Rather than open a tin of anchovies, I used a few squeezes of anchovy paste. Next time, would probably go for mincing up a whole tin, as I'd like this even more with more anchovy flavor.

I have made this several times and I have highly enjoyed it each time, as did others! Sometimes I omit the cilantro and use parsley. I also use a combo if fresh peppermint and spearmint. Finally -I love anchovies but I usually made this for an event that precluded that use of anchovies, but it was delicious without. I won't make the kind with mayo again. This is much fresher, tastier and easier!

Best potato salad I've ever had!

Got rave reviews at a picnic. The anchovies work very well with the herbs. I sliced the potatoes unpeeled because the bit of red is nice with the greens and I like the skin.

yummy, easy -- yippee I used vidalia onions instead of green onions (no green onions in the house) this is tastey, no mayo!, & satisfies the potatosalad yen. I'll add this to my salads for the rest of the week!

This was a nice change to traditional potato salad. It thought it was very tasty and did not change the recipe at all.

Yummy and simple. I dissolved the anchovies in heated olive oil first as I love the flavor but am grossed out by seeing big pieces. I also used sweet red onion rather than green onion just as it was in the house. Will make again!

What a nice combination. I used the small, dutch yukon golds which I think added a buttery note. I agree, add more anchovy, the potato eats up the saltiness. Great with grilled foods.

If you like a nice vinegary potato salad like I do, this recipe is fabulous! Very flavorful and interesting. The anchovies add a nice depth of flavor but are not overwhelming. Two suggestions: 1) cut the potatoes into chunks rather than slices, and 2) hold off on adding any extra salt, as the anchovies are pretty salty already. As I read it, the recipe called for only 1/2 oz. tin of anchovies. But a typical tin is 2 oz. I started with 1/2 oz, but decided it needed the whole 2-oz tin. To my taste (I love anchovies), this was the perfect amount.

I made this and gave the recipe to everyone when it was in the magazine - basically a great combo - any large quantity of chopped herbs (parsley, basil, chives, etc) and some nice salty anchovies and you have a very refined potato salad - nice for the mayo haters
