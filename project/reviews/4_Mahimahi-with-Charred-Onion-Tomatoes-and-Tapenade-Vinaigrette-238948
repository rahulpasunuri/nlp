I reveiwed this receipe a couple of years ago - my opinion has not changed - it rocks! I must say I always have prepared this with Sea Bass. Broiled Sea Bass is a gift from God - so easy - so good!

I used tilapia... Which didn't really work with the vinaigrette. Also the parmesan couscous overpowered the dish. Overall, it took an extra 10 minutes to roast the veggies. Could be a good dish if I had used the right fish... But the surrounding items needed some tweaking too.

FANTASTIC and a total crowd pleaser. A very very easy recipe that tastes great and impresses easily. I will make this again and again. The mahimahi was amazing, but I'm excited to try it with other fish as well. 4 forks

holy mahi. i rarely give 4 forks but this was just so darn easy, beautiful and tasty that it deserves it! i did make basically ALL of the changes that other reviewers recommended--adding garlic and zucchini to the veggies, using balsamic vinegar and adding lemon zest to the tapenade (and doubled this), and serving with some parsley/garlic/feta angel hair pasta and it was perfection for our little al fresco dinner last night. the only thing i would change next time is to make sure i have some crusty bread to dip in the extra tapenade!!

I used Halibut otherwise followed the directions. My husband rarely gives anything a 4* but he did this recipe and has mentioned it a number of times. I'm going to try it with chicken tonight.

Easy and delicious dish. I used store bought tapenade. Served w/angel hair pasta tossed w/garlic, evoo, parsley and feta. Was a big hit among my friends!

I thought this was a great recipe. Very fast and easy and quite flavorful. I used halibut rather than mahimahi because that's what I found at the Farmer's Market. I've actually made it twice, once with a mixed olive tapenade that I had on hand and once with black olive tapenade, and it was definitely better with the black olives. I like green olives but it didn't seem quite right with this dish.I used a lemon olive oil to toss with the veggies and drizzle on the fish, and I also didn't cook the fish for anywhere near as long as the recipe calls for. I put the veggies in the oven to cook for a few minutes before adding the fish to make sure they would be done before the fish was overcooked. Yum!

This had very good flavor overall- I made the recipe as directed but used leftover olive oil from the veggies to drizzle on the fish. However, the recommended Parmesan couscous really overpowered the rest of the flavors. I'll try it with garlic olive oil couscous next time!

Delicious, VERY quick and easy. I used sole for the fish and it turned out great. Also added zucchini and used balsamic. Easy weeknight dinner!

Yummy!! This was ridiculously easy to make (I used Trader Joe's Black Olive Tapenade), and absolutely delicious. I used sea bass, but I'm sure it would be wonderful with any firm, white fish. Can't wait to make it again at a dinner party next week.

Very tasty, nice presentation, very easy to prepare. Changes included using a balsalmic vinegar, parmesan couscous, ahi tuna, added zucchini and mushrooms

This dish was quite palatable to say the least. I threw in some bell peppers to add some color and volume to the entree. Parmesan cous cous is a must.

I made this recipe recently and it was fantastic&extremely flavourful. The Parmesan Couscous was a perfect match for this dish. It was quick and easy to prepare. I will make it again and again.

A lovely refreshingly tasteful dish. I added some lemon juice and the sauce that resulted from baking was so flavoursome that everyone finished it by dipping the fresh ciabatta into it. Loved it and will do it again and again!

Double or triple the Tapenade. If the fish is thick I would cut a slit and add some of the Tapenade inside before cooking. I used Salmon as Mahi Mahi wasn't available. Also I added some of my trail mix (nuts, raisins, dried cranberries) to my Cousous and it was pretty good. I rarely makes things twice so not sure if I can say I would cook it again. But it is very easy.

Well, I hate even reviewing this as I used Talapia and not Mahimahi, but the true issue was the vinaigrette. The flavor was a little dramatic from the plain fish. The veggies were great. The fish was a little too bland. I think putting some seasoning in the oil that you brush on the fish would spice it up. Even the vinaigrette on the fish before cooking could jazz it up a notch.

Wow! This was the easiest dinner party meal I've ever made and it was a huge hit! I prepared everything before our guests arrived and then just popped it in the oven 20 minutes before we were ready to eat. Beautiful "crust" on the fish from the broiler. Rave reviews! I served it with a spinach and strawberry salad.

Delicious. Substituted rice pilaf for couscous as none of us like couscous. Husband and young sons loved it.

Well, I forgot to buy any couscous and substituted grits instead and it was still wonderful. This one is going into the rotation list and I'm sure will stay for a while. Easy to fix and easy to clean up and tasty, too. What's not to love?

Wonderful! I added sliced zucchini and mushrooms cut into quarters to the veggie part. It was fantastic and so easy to prepare and clean up!

I made this last night and my husband absolutely loved it. It was one of the quickest and most delicious meals I've ever prepared. This will definitely be on my keeper list. I made one revision to the dish - I added balsamic vinegar while tossing the tomatoes and onions with olive oil, and also added balsamic to the vinaigrette. It gave it a real depth of flavor that was wonderful!

Made this with Tilapia...Outstanding...Simple and delicious....I also increased the amount of tapenade... The couscous salad listed below in the review sounds wonderful..thanks for the idea...

Rating: 3
As advertised....tasty, healthy, quick and simple to clean up. A great meal for a hot summer evening. The vinaigrette is very good; I increased the tapenade to 3 tsp. I served the fish with couscous salad (added red onion, red peppers, chickpeas, Italian parsley and yogurt/mayo dressing with cumin).

This was delicious and very easy to make. As an added bonus, there is very little mess to clean up afterwards! I have to admit that I substituted salmon for the mahimahi because that is what looked good at the market. It was delightful!

I made a modified version -- cipolini onions and wedges of an heirloom tomato -- as that was what I had on hand. So good! We skipped the couscous (no carb diet!) and it would have been good to have a mixed green instead to soak up the dressing and juices.
