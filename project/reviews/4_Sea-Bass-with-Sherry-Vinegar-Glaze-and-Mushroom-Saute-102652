Both my dinner guests and I highly enjoyed this dish. I used filleted gilt-head bream instead of sea bass and served it over chive & parsely mashed potato (see recipe on this site). Some mushroom saute remained to be eaten the following day and I found that the oyster mushrooms had by then thoroughly absorbed the apple flavour and tasted wonderful.

This recipe was average. Can't afford average with such an expensive fish! I much preferred the recipe on this site with shallots, garlic and marsala. I grilled the sea bass in this recipe but otherwise followed it exactly. It was okay but not mouthgasmic!!

This was delicious. All the flavors came together better than I expected.

This is a terrific dish. It goes perfectly with the grilled mushroom with frisee and hazlenuts recipe.

I used 2 tablespoons butter and sauted apple and onion for about 20 minutes until carmalized for a wonderfully enhanced flavor. Also added 1 tsp. Worcestershire.

I doubled the sauce and added some sherry to it, and it was delicious. Extremely fast and easy.

This is a delicious and very easy to make recipe. The combination of apples,onions and oyster mushrooms works great with the sea bass. This one is a good one!
