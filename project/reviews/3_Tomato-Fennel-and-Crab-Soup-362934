I've learned that it's a good idea to read comments on a recipe online, and I'm glad I did. Thanks for the help, all. I was sure to use this recipe as a base rather than doing it according to the recipe. Though, I really liked the idea of combining these 3 things. Props for the creativity on the title. On that note, here's what I did: As suggested in the comments, I added some fresh lemon juice, cumin, celery salt & paprika while sauteing the onions, garlic & fennel. I didn't chop anything very fine because I knew I was going to use a blender on everything right after I added the tomatoes, which I did. I blended it to about gazpacho consistency, and it was still a bit watery. If you are blending it, don't add as much vegetable broth. I quit reading the recipe after this. Here are the 2 big things I learned about this recipe if I make it again: (which I will! ...in my own way...) - Quality tomatoes. As suggested, organic, good quality tomatoes. Maybe try fresh heirlooms to minimize the sodium and make it more gardeny? Tomato is the main flavor here, so make it count. - Not quality crab. I live on the coast. Crab is everywhere. I'm not and never will be at a place in wealth where I can use real crab for anything other than a main dish, not an ingredient. I love crab. Very much. But being a poor kid, I actually really like the taste of imitation crab meat. And for those who think it was "too fishy"...maybe you shouldn't scoff at it either. I sauteed it separately in garlic, olive oil and wine and used it as a topping. Added to that a good, whole wheat loaf to use to dip, it was an amazing dish. Then again, I'm someone who likes fake crab. Maybe my taste buds aren't as refined as yours. Good luck, and definitely make this dish your own!

I took the Bon Appetite advice and added half a lime's worth of juice to it, plus some white pepper and this came out great for me. My only comment is that while it tasted great, it smelled fishy (and not in a good way) - I'm going to go ahead and agree with some other reviewers that unless you live near the ocean in crab season, you should probably skip this recipe. I found that even the "premium fresh" crab from the supermarket is not good enough for this recipe, and is a waste of a lot of money's worth of crab.

This was a huge disappointment and such a waste of expensive crabmeat. I tried modifying it to improve the taste by it could not be salvaged. I will not make it again.

the soup was OK. I used homemade veggie stock. But, the fennel overpowered the crab meat. While I like the taste of each ingredient (tomatoes, fennel, fresh veggie stock & crabmeat), they did not marry well. because some of our diners are not crab eaters, we split the batch of soup and only added crab to part. I am glad we did. Otherwise, it would have been a waste of expensive crab. I will take the left over soup and add some spice and see if it can be improved. I hate to throw out good ingredients. I came to this site to see the reviews and gather any ideas for improving the left overs.

Delicious, easy and quick. Now for all the bad reviews, my comment would be that this is a perfect example where you want to showcase the ingredients. A good recipe is made with top quality ingredients and does not need much else that a cook with decent cooking techniques. In this case buy small size fennel; organic canned tomato (Muir Glen is the best) and freshly picked crab meat. Fresh crab does not stink (as some reviewers mentioned) if it does you should return it. It should taste sweet. Don't overcook this soup, add the crab right at the end, season properly (salt pepper maybe some paprika and lemon juice for a little kick). You are done in 10 minutes and it will be delicious.

Very good with 2 tablespoons of heavy cream just before you add the crabmeat. It becomes a chowder of sorts.

I would have to agree with a lot of the comments about the soup, as written, needing ... something. I think using really good stock is key. I also added quite a bit of Old Bay, until it was tasting zesty, as well as some fresh parsley. Also, I really like thick, creamy soups, so I used an immersion blender prior to adding the crab. It was not fully pureed; there was still had a lot of texture from the fennel, but it was a lot thicker and richer. From there, I folded in the crab and let it simmer to warm the crab through. We had it with a warm baguette and thought it was great. Note: I could not find fresh crab at the market and ended up using canned lump crabmeat. For those concerned about the cost of the soup, I think the canned worked well as a less expensive substitute here, much to my surprise.

I made this before reviewing the comments. Agreed - it can use some oomph. I added celery and Creole seasoning and that made significant improvement. It's still quite easy and I'd definitely make it again with the adjustments.

This was easy & fabulous! I'm honestly surprised by all of the negative reviews. I made exactly as written (no Old Bay), and I thought it was flavorful, filling, and - importantly - really healthy. I'm not even sure it needed the crab - am passing the recipe on to vegan & vegetarian friends.

This was decent, certainly edible, and very easy, but it was missing something. I can't put my finger on what it needs...it might just be the rare Bon Appetite recipe that's a dud. I doubled the crab and ended up feeling like it was a waste of crab.

My family loved this soup but we added Old Bay as suggested and my big time heat seekers added Sriracha sauce to their bowls.

This was less than nothing special. I too found it to be a waste of good crab and fennel. The vegetable mixture after simmering was OK, but needed something. A little more salt and a bit of lemon juice to brighten things--slightly better. Then add the crab and at the end of the simmer was this incredible inedible pot of fishy smelling and tasting stuff. We tossed the WHOLE pot and had omelets.

I am with cook from Atlanta - this was nothing special and a waste of good crab. I love fennel in just about everything but in this it was just overpowered by tomato / fishy taste. I threw out at least half of it.

I thought this recipe was pleasant and healthy, but not memorable. Definitely needs a kick to make it better...will try the suggestions of cayenne and cumin with the leftovers. I love Mark Bittman but there are better healthy soups out there.

I thought this soup was very tasty. I took some(but not a lot)of extra time to make my own veg stock, and as other reviewers have hinted at I think this boosted the overall flavor of the dish. My only other deviation from the original recipe was some Old Bay and cayenne pepper at the end to spice it up a little bit. I served it with some toasted multi-grain baguette slices smeared with roasted garlic. It was a hit.

I love the combination of favors here.In the summer I would add some diced zucchini or yellow squash.Also add a teaspoon of Old Bay or other seafood seasoning to add a little zip.

This recipe was simple but delicious, I think the main ingredient to make this soup great is a good vegetable stock. You don't puree anything, it is nice to feel the pieces of tomato, crab. It was a great way to present crab. People sometimes think that the more the put in the better, and they don't let the flavors speak by themselves. That is the skill of a good cook.

Just finished making this recipe; based on other reviews, I roasted the fennel, sauteed the onion with minced garlic, then did a rough puree with all the vegetables, including the can of tomato. I then added them to a reduced lobster shell stock(made with the discards from boiled lobster). Then added the cooked crab. Tasted great without additional spicing.

I have over 250 recipes in my recipe box and this is the only one I've ever deleted. Fennel + crab = major fishy taste. My husband, who would be that contestant on Survivor who would eat live bugs with a smile on his face, told me to throw it down the garbage disposal. Crab is too expensive to waste on this recipe...sorry.

I made this for lunch yesterday-- relatively quick and easy. I made a few changes, based on the reviews. I added a 1/2 teaspoon of cumin, and a dash of cayenne. Also pureed the vegetables a little with an immersion blender, just to make the soup smoother. At the end, I stirred in a little half-and-half (I like crab bisque, and just a tad of half- and-half gives it that feel). Also, to kick up the spice a notch, I drizzled in a tiny bit of chili oil.

great and easy recipe. i actually thought the amount of onion was a misprint, but it was right. like the previous reviewer, i also felt it needed spice, so added tobasco sauce. and i used a blood-orange-infused olive oil to drizzle over the top, which finished it off perfectly!

When made as written, my husband and I felt that this recipe was missing something. We added cumin and cayenne and thought it was perfect. Maybe we just prefer a spicier crab soup than most.
