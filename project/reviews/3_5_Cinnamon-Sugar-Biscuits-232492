These were wonderful! I made them for Valentine's Day in pink heart shapes. It's good dough for cutting shapes in for sure! I rolled the dough a little thin and they ended up a little well done, but it's obvious that I was the problem, and not the biscuits!

I made these for breakfast and they were delicious! I used the leftovers for a mixed berry "shortcake" in the evening (sliced the biscuits in half. layered fresh slightly sweetened whipped cream and mixed berries and served with another dollop of whipped cream on top - mmm mmm good!).
