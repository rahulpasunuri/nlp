Wow. Would not make this again. Followed the recipe as written except for the bread crumbs (had a gluten free dinner guest). I bought the fancy olives, roasted the peppers & eggplant as instructed, etc... First recipe I've made with 3+ forks that I actively disliked and was a bit embarrassed to have served. Flavors made me grimace - too much anchovy, olives overpowered veggies. No one wanted the leftovers. Tossed them. Would consider making again with just garlic & herbs between each layer. Do not recommend this recipe. (Haha! I bet you already knew that.)

As I have lots of tomatoes from my garden, I was more generous with those than roasted red bell peppers. Both my husband and I love anchovies (I grew up eating them on crackers)and they were great in this dish. I can see where other vegetables would work well and look forward to making some version again. Other than omitting the bread crumbs and changing tomato and bell pepper quantities,I did follow the ingredient and cooking instructions.

This is amazing! Tastes great and looks so pretty :) I made some adjustments, so the 4 fork rating is based on that-- ommitted the anchovies and breadcrumbs altogether, and used dried thyme.....also, b/c roasting peppers is so time consuming, and the jarred ones are hit or miss with taste, I just cut up the peppers (had green, not red) as directed and then sauteed them until super soft while the eggplant was in the oven.... it worked perferctly. The dish is so flavorful, and btw, refridgerated great.

I loved the flavor but the breadcrumbs did not come out crunchy, more powdery. If anyone has a suggestion, I would appreciate it.

I love this recipe. In 4 months, I have already made it 6 times. It does take a lot of time particularly if you make your own roasted capsicum but I like the dish so much, I do it anyway. The trick here is not to try to reduce the amount of the herbs. My guests and I have loved it every time I have made it.

This was good, but it takes forever to make, so unless you love it, I don't recommend it.

Served this at room temperature and it was not very nice at all. Heated it up again the next day and it was a taste sensation. Moral of the story: serve it HOT...

It's a light, very delicious, and easy-to-make dish. I make it very often, changing the mixture of vegetables. I also add some mozzarella/parmesan cheese on top. Bellisimo!!!

This was wonderful! Using a jar of roasted peppers would cut the work a lot. I used chopped green olives plus black and liked the flavor.

This dish came out great, but it is alot of work to make.

This dish is really wonderful, particularly with a roast. I've made it several times and it gets rave reviews from gourmet cooks. It is labor-intensive, however, so make sure you have enough time for preparation.

Very disappointing. My house still smells wonderful, but the flavor of the dish didn't live up to the promising smell. The flavors didn't come together, and I'm tormenting myself wondering if I could have changed something small to make the whole thing taste better. If I were to make this again, I would skip the bread crumbs, use the oil from the anchovies in place of some of the olive oil, and add some parmesan.

This was quite good~ I had it plain with bread, but I can see how it would be amazing with roasted meat!

I made it exactly as written and everyone raved. I would try adding more olives and maybe even some mozzarella next time, but there definitely will be a next time, it was tasty!

Although I modified the recipe a bit with jarred roasted red peppers, olive paste, and no anchovies, it was an absolutely amazing combination of vegetables. The flavors go wonderfully together and the dish just screams "Je suis Provençal!!" I'll make it again for sure!
