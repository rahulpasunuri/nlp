Nothing special. The caramel filling was totally lost in the chocolate cake. The cake needed frosting to bring it together.

This cake is delicious! It was a little too rich while it was warm but AWESOME after it cooled. I used a larger amount of chocolate chips and pecans than the recipe called for and had cool whip for a topping. I have made it twice now and the recipe is in my book of keepers!

I saved some of the caramel, half of the chocolate chips, and half of the pecans and topped the cake with them after it was done cooking and still warm. This made it much more "turtle-like". We loved it.

I will never make this recipe again...unless I can take it somewhere else and leave it. THis was the best cake I have ever tasted. I even iced it with pecan/cocunt icing. I did the recipe the exact way the directions state...I didn't have that many pecans, but this is one cake I'll always make to take somewhere else!

I expected that somehow the caramels would not melt completely, and become almost a filling between the chocolate layers. Mine melted into the bottom layer, which certainly made it moist and rich, but otherwise were unnoticeable. Is this the way it is supposed to be?

Has anyone made this cake to compare with the cream cheese turtle cake?

I've used a recipe nearly identical to this for years called Snicker Cake. Yes, it's very rich, pretty decadent...I like to make it more so by substituting 1/3-1/2 cup of Kahlua for the same amount of water in the mix, and 2 tsps. of vanilla extract to the caramel filling. Honestly, sometimes the layers just kinda run together (it's almost brownie-like) but it's to be devoured, not praised for beauty. VERY YUMMY. It always gets compliments, and now when people ask for the recipe, I'll call it Turtle Cake - much more fitting. (And I almost forgot - if you can't find KRAFT Caramels, wait to make it til you can. The Brachs just don't melt well).

Sorry to disagree - this tasted like a mix with a glop of caramel in the middle. Stick with homemade German chocolate cake - same amount of time and money. With great results. My son eats everything and was hard pressed to say something nice about this one.

Of course this isn't a gourmet cake but boy, did everyone like it! I served it at my 3-yr old's birthday party and everyone asked for more. I put all the nuts on 2/3 of the cake only - for those who don't like them and instead of adding the chocolate chips in the middle, I added them on top of the cake as it came out of the oven and it melted beautifully (although harder to cut when set)

This is a great cake and so easy to make. It IS extremely rich, but decadence at it's best...total self indulgence!! We did not taste the cake mix at all.

Let's just put it this way, I've got two teenagers that manage to keep our house loaded with their many friends, and the three-quarters of this cake left over from when I made it 4 days ago, is going down the garbage disposal just as soon as I push the send button here. It was too rich, and definitely not worth having more than a few bites of.

This cake was very rich (which I see as a benefit), but it would be far more interesting if there were actually additions to the cake mix batter before it was baked. It did have that "cake mix" taste, but with the chocolate chips, the caramel sauce, the toasted nuts, etc. nobody was disappointed. It was very easy, too...

Yum, yum, yum!!! I will definitely make this again. I like serving it in small brownie size pieces, rather than cake size pieces because it is really rich. It's an easy win! :)

It still tasted like cake-mix cake! It was too rich and heavy.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday and it was really yummy. It was really good with ice-cream because it is quite rich. I also made separate carmel and chocolate sauces and drizzled them over the top.

I made this twice last month, and planning on making it again on Friday for a dinner party. It was that good. My girlfriend who NEVER eats a cake unless it's from scratch actually asked me for this recipe. Great served with vanilla ice cream.

I was so excited about the rave reviews that I was eager to taste this awesome culinary treat! Big disappointment. To be fair, we were too dinner-stuffed to eat the cake on the day I made it, so it was a full 24 hours before it was eaten. No one in my family liked it. I ended up throwing it away.

This cake is perfect. It is espeicially great for people who like simpler and less frou-frou cakes. I made it for work and everybody loved it. I make a lot of complicated cakes and everyone told me this is the best cake I have ever made. It would be perfect for kids. Very easy.

Excellent! Made this for my four year olds birthday. I left out the nuts and frosted it with chocolate whipping cream - 2 cups whipping cream whipped with cocoa and sugar (it was more than enough for top and sides of cake).

A scrumptious cake that's simple to make deserve's four forks from me. If you like German Chocolate Cake this one is for you.

i don't bake--too much effort for too little reward. this recipe is simple and wonderfully rich! i used a chocolate cake mix, but otherwise followed the directions exactly. my office-mates RAVED about it and kept teasing me--come on, tell us who really made it!

I made this cake and did not wait until it had cooled to turn it out on the wire rack. Not a good idea, the weight of the hot caramel forced the cake down through the wire rack, so there was lots of little squares of cake to be reassembled on the serving plate. Nevertheless it tasted wonderful.

I made this cake for someone who HATES cakes made with cake mix. She said it was absolutely the best birthday cake she had ever had and asked three times for the recipe. I sent it to her and soon she will know it was not a scratch cake! Everyone loved it.

I made 2 mistakes when I tried this recipe. The first was that my grocery store did not have German Chocolate mix, or even regular chocolate. Instead I used Devil's Food which made it too rich. The second minstake was that I made it in a bundt pan as I was bringing it to a dinner party for 4 adults..BIG MISTAKE! It was too thick and barely cooked all the way through. The weight of it was incredible and it collapsed completely as I was trying to transfer it to the plate. Other than that it was really delicous. Next time I make it I will make it according to the exact directions!!!!!!!!!!

I served this cake at a recent dinner party and it was a massive success! Even my husband, who does not like chocolate cake, loved it and is begging me to make it again. I ommitted the nuts and used regular chocolate cake mix and many of the people who have had it made with both german chocolate cake and then the palin chocolate cake liked the plain chocolate better. This is the BEST cake I have ever had!

I've made this recipe several times and it is just wonderful. Very, very easy and delicious! No one in the world would ever imagine that it starts with a cake mix! Tastes very homemade. Kids and adults both can't get enough!
