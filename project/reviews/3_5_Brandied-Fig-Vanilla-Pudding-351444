I just made this with a 12oz. can of evaporated milk and 1/2 cup water. I have to say that it was delish!

This was really nice without being too sweet. Both my husband and I liked it, so I will definitely make it again. The fig and brandy topping really added some zip. I don't like puddings made from mixes, but I liked this pudding.

I made the vanilla pudding recipe x7 for a wedding this weekend and everyone loved it. I halved the vanilla extract and added a vanilla bean to make it pretty. It took a long time to cook in that quantity, but it was well worth it!

Who knew it was so easy to make pudding? Now it's part of my repertoire with all sorts of toppings...raspberries with framboise liquor, yum.

I liked this recipe quite a bit, though I would cut the amount of sugar in the pudding, maybe by 1/3. The brandied fig topping is very sweet, so the pudding needs to be less so, otherwise the whole thing is too sugary.

A perfect, simple and quick dessert. Prepped for a last minute "comfort" luncheon and it won raves for simple, classic taste. Fig topping was simple (i usually have a jar of fig paste on hand for cheese) and made the difference. A winner!

Used my own topping (fresh raspberries). Pudding without topping is a little sweet and one dimensional.

I substituted apricot preserves and amaretto for the fig preserves and brandy. With a few sliced almonds on top, it was delicious!

I made this to go with the pork chops with sugar snap peas with mint julep glaze ((BA March, 2009) and it was perfect. I was so excited to make my own pudding without the box! Definitely a keeper - next time i would double the fig perserve mixture just to make sure I had enough. My wife already wants me to make this again for her Bunko group in March.

Delicious and easy! Whipped this "ersatz panna cotta" together for a last-minute dinner party, let set while eating the main course, and was perfect for dessert. I had no fig jam on hand, but used blueberry preserves instead. Added lemon zest and extra (fresh) blueberries to it, heated for a minute in the microwave, stirred in the brandy, and let sit in the fridge. Turned out perfectly, and everyone loved it! This is a keeper for sure. Can't wait to try it again with the fig jam.

Even though I managed to burn a small amount of the pudding, this recipe tastes great and is super simple to make. The fig topping really adds a fantastic flavor to the dish.
