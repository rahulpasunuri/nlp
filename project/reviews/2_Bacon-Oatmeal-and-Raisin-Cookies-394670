I really wanted to like this cookie. I followed the recipe exactly and it all looked like it might make it. Noting the previous reviewers, I baked for 7 minutes and then rotated and baked for 7 more. 6 more, instead of the 7, would have been a better texture, I think (I like a chewier cookie). I used Wright's bacon which is delicious and not too smoky. The cookies were just ok. I don't think any of us ate a whole cookie (and they are big) or would ever even consider eating another. They are definitely not worth the calories - nor the time and ingredients. BA - you need to redeem this recipe or remove it. It's just not worth it.

I used a silpat and it makes baking very efficient so I had to cut down on the bake time to 15 min or less. Otherwise, they were too crunchy. However, overall they were very bacon-y. I added another 1/4 of raisins because I didn't think there was enough sweet to counter the bacon. This recipe could be improved.

Good but not great. I was very excited to try - because bacon makes EVERYTHING better. Cookie was kind of dry. Just a really average oatmeal raisin cookie recipe with an addition of bacon. The recipe cooking time is way too long. I made them smaller and reduce the cooking time to about 14-15 minutes.

I don't know what other people experienced, but I thought these cookies were FABULOUS. If you don't like the sweet+savory combo, then you probably won't like the bacon in these, but I loved it. I DO agree with a previous reviewer - start checking these at 15 minutes, especially if you make them any smaller than the recipe recommends. Also, the second time I made them I accidentally used all-purpose flour, and I think I liked the texture of the cookie much better (although they spread much more!). BASICALLY: ignore the bad reviews, cut down the cooking time, and make these cookies!

I don't know what other people were experiencing, but I thought that these cookies were FABULOUS. If you're not somebody who likes something a little outside the box, or you don't like the sweet+savory combination, then these aren't for you. But I think they were like breakfast in a cookie, perfect for a snack! I do agree with a previous reviewer, however, that the recipe calls for them to cook too long (definitely check them at 15 minutes, especially if you try to make them any smaller than the recipe recommends), and the second time I made them I learned to take them out when the cookie looks soft, and even a teensy bit "wet" through the cracks, to ensure it stays chewy once it cools. Also, the second time I made them with all-purpose flour by accident instead of cake, and I think I actually liked them better. These are also really easy to make ahead and freeze, and just pop straight in the oven from the freezer. BASICALLY: ignore the other reviews, cut down the cook time, and make these!

Here's my critique of the recipe. Not enough oatmeal. This one calls for one cup. My standard oatmeal raisin recipe calls for 3 cups of oatmeal. This really is more like a chocolate chip cookie recipe. Next, it called for 20-22 min. at 375 degrees. I should have checked them at 15 or cooked at a lower temperature. They should have been softer. These were very hard and dry if you follow the recipe as printed. I will use my regular oatmeal raisin cookie recipe next time and just add the 8 oz. of bacon, diced. The concept is great. This recipe is not so much.

Too dry and hard, might try again with the addition of banana

I made this as described with craisins instead of raisins. The end cookie was way too salty and bacony. This overwhelmed everything else. I would not make these again.
