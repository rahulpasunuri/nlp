This is the nastiest crap I've ever tasted in my life.

If you like Blue Cheese your taste buds will love this recipe. Simply divine. If you want to turn it up a slight notch, modify by using herb butter in place of regular butter. In one word robust and flavorful!

I was very happy with how these potatoes came out. I followed the other reviewers' suggestion and added both the blue cheese and rosemary gradually to taste. I also used 2% milk instead of regular and it still worked well. Because of the strong flavors in the dish, I would suggest serving with a mild-flavored main dish.

The combination of rosemary and blue cheese is divine. Use a sweeter potato, such as Yukon Gold for best flavor. The cheese is rich enough that you can easily get away with 2% milk. I wonder how I could have been cooking for all these years and not have discovered this simple, wonderfully complimentary flavor.

I found this recipe when looking for one with blue cheese and sun dried tomatoes. I will use the recipe as the base and substitue 1/4 cup chopped sun dried tomatoes for the rosemary. My family LOVES this flavor combo. It is best served with richly flavored meats.

Yummy! I was cautious with the amount of blue cheese based on others' comments, using about 3/4 of the amount the recipe calls for, but I think it would have been fine to use the full amount. I'm certain that a lot depends on the age of the blue cheese you use - younger cheese has a milder flavor, while an older cheese might have been overpowering. Speaking of overpowering: I was stingy with the rosemary and after tasting, was glad I didn't use the full amount the recipe called for, as I think it would have been a bit too much.

Very good. Loved the blue cheese, wasn't crazy about the rosemary - it just didn't really "go" with the potatoes. Would make it again with just the blue cheese and cream. Between the cheese and rosemary, the potatoes wound up looking slightly green, which freaked out some of the guests - but everyone who tried it liked it.

I served these potatoes last Thanksgiving and everyone loved them! No one complained about too much rosemary, like some other reviewers have noted. I think I used slightly less blue cheese than the recipe called for, so maybe that's why no one found the blue cheese taste overpowering.

This was good, but not the masterpiece I was hoping for. After reading previous reviews, I was very careful about both the blue cheese and the rosemary, used half as much of both, and was very glad I did. I LOVE blue cheese, but I can't even imagine how overwhelming the taste would have been with 2 cups! I served it with beef tenderloin, and the flavors went well together. Be careful what you serve it with, though, because this could easily overwhelm something subtle like poultry or fish.

The key to this recipe is modifying the amount of blue cheese - a little goes a long way - I used a COUPLE OF TABLESPOONS and still enjoyed plenty of flavor. I can't even imagine using two cups - that must have been a mistake!

Was a tad wary about the reviews of this recipe, and approached this with some ounce of anxiety. Didn't follow the measurements recommended in this recipe, as i was cooking for one, and i substituted with dried rosemary leaves, added in butter, sugar and pepper. Had to pair it off with some seared beef medallions, with a thick chicken-stock/mushroom sauce. Its winter in Australia now, so i thought it paired well with the beef. Its definitely a dish for cheese lovers ONLY, and good comfort food for cold weather!

Very disappointing. The consistency of this dish is runny and the taste is not good. I am deleting this from my recipe box.

These tasted awful! My entire family felt Thanksgivng was nearly ruined because of these funky potatoes! The only person who found them remotely edible was my Grampa...he was raised during the Depression, so he eats ANYTHING!

I agree with the last post. Luckily, I knew from bad experiences in the past, that a little fresh Rosemary goes a long way. I used about 1/3 of the Rosemary, and it was perfect. Of course, Rosemary's pungence varies greatly, so just add a little at a time and taste. Don't we all do that, anyway?

This recipe made for super-creamy potatoes with a great texture, and the blue cheese was a lot subtler than I thought, but unfortunately the rosemary completely overpowered the dish -- though perhaps this is because I used fresh rosemary or should have used less because of that? (It was so overpowering that only half a serving was eaten and the rest was tossed, which was sad because I was really looking forward to making this dish.) I'm refraining from a rating because this may be the reason, but would definitely advise anyone who makes this to add the rosemary VERY gradually with lots of tasting in between. Other than that, as far as I can tell from tasting it along the way, it seems to be OK... though I followed advice from other reviewers about salt and pepper, which it needed. All in all, I think the best thing I got out of it was the suggestion of a brilliant cook earlier in the reviews... I did end up working blue cheese into some hamburger and grilling it up (stuck some sauteed onions, mushrooms and garlic in the meat, too), and that was DELICIOUS -- I'm definitely hanging onto that idea for the future. Thank you so much!

I like blue cheese and rosemary, so I thought this dish sounded real interesting. I served it for my dinner guests and although they complimented my other dishes, they did not rave over this one. I even had plenty left over.

Although this dish is lovely as is, I suggest adding in some Spanish Tetilla cheese (if available), whose soft creamy texture melts and mashes well.

This recipe was very yummy. But it needed salt, butter and a lot of extra milk. I used yukon gold potatoes. The consistency was so grainy, I had to cream them up with the butter. The bowl was empty qucikly.

Ease up there Napa Valley! Not everyone cooks as a way to create... some of us ENJOY just following a recipe & using cooking as a way to relax with a glass of wine at the end of the day!

I did not make it...my daughter in law did...and though it was a bit too 'wet'...it was outstanding...I would use a bit less cheese.

Excellent variation of mashed potatoes!!! The blue cheese added an addition layer of flavor that turned out incredible. This was one of the first things to go on the table. I will make this again for regular dinners, not just special occasions...

This recipe was the big hit of my Thanksgiving Day dinner. All of my in-laws are not fond of blue cheese--I was able to sneak the blue cheese in while preparing the potatoes without them knowing. After dinner--I announced what was in them--they could not believe it! They loveed them!

I loved this recipe and very much enjoy reading other's reviews and suggestions....particularly their suggestions. The cook from Cleveland needs to go back to the sign on page and read the paragraph on rating and sharing recipes.....the object of this part of the site is "a great way to pass on cooking hints, recommend ingredient substitutions and offer serving suggestions"! I am a caterer with a good success record and a very active business but I can ALWAYS learn from someone else! Thank you for this valuable service!!!

I thoroughly enjoyed this dish as did two of my three dinner guests. I didn't make it ahead of time and reheat it like others and it came out just right. I used a hand mixer and it only required 1/2 a cup of milk. Pretty simple for such a different dish.

I used the suggestion at the top of the recipe that said you could make this up to 8 hours ahead of time and then reheat. The potatoes were perfectly mashed and yummy when I finished mashing them (I used the exact ingredients and amounts in the recipe). However, later that day I moved them to a serving container and was appalled to find something more like potato pudding. I thought reheating them in the oven without a lid would evaporate some of the liquid. Unfortunately, by the time I served them the consistency was more like that of potato soup. Soupy mashed potatoes are very unappealing to me.

Be careful when adding the milk. Do not over do it. I don't think I gave the cheese enough time to melt providing the creamy consistency I was looking for and added too much milk. I ended up with soupy potatoes. 50% of the people at my dinner table liked the flavor, and 50% didn't. All are blue cheese fans. I think I can find better.

This seemed so-so to me. Definitely heating the milk (also I used 1 1/4 c of milk) is crucial so that helped. I think it needs butter but I am loathe to add butter, plus the cheese and the milk. There are other recipes on this website which are better than this one.

I disagree with the cook from Cleveland - I like to read people's comments. If you're not interested just don't read it. Besides - hellooo - your contribution was not a review either.

I love the recipes and just wish you would not print reviews that are NOT reviews. Why are people so eager to try to impress others with their supposed culinary skills? Review the recipe, fer pete's sake, and just say if you liked it or not, not how YOU would do it differently!

Don't hestiate to try this. I went with the suggestion to steam the potatoes. If you boil, add your salt to the water. I *had* to add some butter to mine. The rosemary could overtake the flavor of the cheese, so don't add it all at once. As a pairing suggestion, work some of the bleu cheese into ground beef with chopped green onions and fresh ground pepper. Form patties sprinkled with soy sauce and California-style garlic salt. Grill 'em up and serve with the potatoes. Oh yeah!!!

I am a bleu cheese fanatic, and I made this the other night and loved it!!! I was out of whole milk or half and half, so I used soy milk instead.....I was a little worried at first but it actually turned out pretty good!

i like this version of potatoes with blue cheese,and it is very easy to prepare. If you love bleu cheese you will like this .

Much better (and less risk of potatoes falling apart into a watery mess) if you steam them; have the bowl and milk ready warmed -makes mashing much easier.
