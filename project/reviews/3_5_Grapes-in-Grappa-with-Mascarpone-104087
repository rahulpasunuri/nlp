It's a good recipe, but a little too much mascarpone flavor on the whole, the second time i used the grated skin off 2 medium lemons and added the lemon juice from one of the lemons. It offsets the heavy mascarpone flavor and makes it a much lighter dessert.....

It was very refreshing. Could almost be used in place of yogurt for brunch.

I love this recipe and have now made it twice. Not being a fan of Grappa I was a bit doubtful, but the combination is wonderful!

This dessert is very tasty and elegant, and my guests all claimed to think it was fabulous just the way it was, but I myself found that the grappa made it taste a little too alcoholic. I will probably make it again, but this time I won't soak the grapes in grappa. I suspect this will make it perfect for my taste. I also added a little more sugar than was called for to the moscarpone.

I was served this dessert at a dinner party and it is delicious! I haven't had a chance to make it myself yet, but definately will.
