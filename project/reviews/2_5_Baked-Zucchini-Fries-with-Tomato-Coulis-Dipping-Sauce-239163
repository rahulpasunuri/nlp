It was pretty good. My family liked it. I would say bring up the heat to 425 at least to get the fries in less than a half hour. Instead of cutting them in lengthwise slices, I cut them in circles, just chopping the zucchinis, and that baked faster. they could be like zucchini chips.

This coulis is wonderful as a pasta sauce with some diced tomatoes; a sauce for salmon and anything else creative. My family absolutely loved it! And the farmer's market tomatoes are SO good right now.

Terrible recipe. The "coulis" is little more than warm tomato puree, the "fries" need temperatures much hotter than 350 to become fries (a deep frier would be ideal), and the whole thing is a mess to prepare for a very, very disappointing result. The idea is good, but the execution is bland and insufficient.

even with modifications this is still pretty bland. I added parmesean cheese, italian seasoning and garlic powder to my breadcrumb mix and it still taste like blah! (thats the sound my baby makes when he spits something out :)) definitely need to raise temp to 425 to ahieve crispiness.

Another suggestion to simplify things. Put the flour in a ziplock or brown paper bag. Toss in all the zucchini fries, close the bag, and toss. Then you can take out the fries as you need them to continue with the coating.

This rating is due to the fries that I made with all of the suggestions from previous reviews. They were wonderfully crispy and slightly addictive :) Thank you to everyone who contributed! The only thing that I found was that it took quite a long time to coat all of the pieces in flour, then egg, then panko.

Oh yeah, and bump up the heat to 450.

This is actually a four-fork recipe but only with modifications. First of all, to keep from having severe clumping problems and ending up with a glove of breadcrumbs, try this. Prepare yourself with the three plates (flour, egg, breadcrumbs) and two forks (one for the egg and one for the breadcrumbs). Drop a few fries at a time into the flour, toss, and tap off the excess dropping them into the egg after you've tapped them off. Use the egg fork to toss them in the egg and use the fork to drain off excess egg. Once they stop dripping, drop them into the breadcrumbs. Use the breadcrumb fork to toss them in the breadcrumbs and put them on the cookie sheet. You'll still end up with some clumps but a whole lot fewer and you won't end up using all the breadcrumbs on your fingers. Secondly, spiff up the breadcrumbs by adding a generous amount of salt and whatever seasonings you like (garlic powder, onion powder, etc.). Using this method, I guarantee, this is a four-forker. We use pounds of zucchini cooked this way (with or without the coulis although, during tomato season, the coulis is yummy).

One of the worst recipes I've ever tried. The egg doesn't stick to the flour and the only things the bread crumbs stick to are your fingers. Then either the temperature is not high enough or the time is not long enough. Either way, they were not cooked all the way through. The fries were bland and the breading had clumped together on them and in the bowl so even if I'd made the second half, I'd have had to use WAY more bread crumbs. There was a TON of flour left over and I used 4 eggs, not two. I didn't make the coulis, but after what happened with the fries, I'm glad. DO NOT TRY THIS!

First off, kudos to the reccomend of 425 degrees. The crispiness was awesome! Very happy kiddos! I didn't serve the coulis, because I was making this at the last minute, although next time I will. You will go thru about 3X as much eggs and panko crumbs. Make sure you have extra of both. Also, it absolutely needs punching up. I added ground garlic, parm, and oregeno. It was still "eh" for seasoning. A definite picky kid healthy snack keeper!

I made 2 batches (I had a lot of zucchini to use up).The first I made as instructed and the fries were very bland. I don't understand why you are instructed to use unseasoned bread crumbs just to have very bland fries. I will say, though, that my 2 year old thought they were just perfect. He couldn't seem to get enough. I do also like that they are baked and therefore, quite a healthy snack. So the second batch I added a lot of seasoning and nutritional yeast to the breadcrumbs which was a big help. At the end of 2 batches, however, I think I used up about 6 eggs and still has most of my original 1 cup of flour left over. Another reviewer had problems with the breadcrumbs becoming to sticky and clumpy..I avoided this by letting the clumps pretty much stick to my fingers and just wiping them off periodically. I did waste a LOT of breadcrumbs though and had to keep adding more and more to the bowl. But it was the only way to do it. Oh, and I cooked them about 5 minutes longer, which was necessary. So I would make this recipe again but only with modifications.

This one was kid-approved! We ran out of breadcrumbs so ended up doing 1/2 with breadcrumbs and 1/2 with ritz cracker crumbs. Both turned out well. We convection roasted at 400 degrees. They turned out crunchy and tasty, allowing our kids to add a veggie to their limited veggie repertoire.

Soo disappointed. I followed instructions and ended up with undercooked zucchini that just about none of the breading stuck to. I also needed a third egg, had lots of leftover flour and a bowl full of breadcrumbs sticking to themselves in clumps and no longer sticking to the zucchini. I put the 'fries' back in the oven so at least the squash was cooked but then it was just baked zucchini with a side of bread crumbs.

My coulis turned out waaaaaaay too watery, and I kept trying to reduce it down, but no luck. The zucchini fries will be made again-- they were quite crisp and I think my toddler will love them too.

I had one of those "I can't eat these slow enough" experiences with the zucchini fries. So delicious! I cut them thicker than recommended somewhere closer to 1/2 x 1/4 x 2 inch pieces and next time I'll cut them a little thicker as the thicker fries were just butter creamy soft in the middle and that will also cut down a little on the prep time. Reading other reviews it seemed most folks loved the coulis, I wasn't a big fan and thought the fries were wonderful on their own. I'm really looking forward to making this again for friends.

The coulis is fabulous, no doubt. The fries definitely need flavor enhancement and plenty of salt. I grated in some parm but it was not nearly enough to coax much flavor out of the zukes. A wonderful treatment for healthy snack but add cayenne and/or lots of herbs to the flour.

My significant other, who does not cook well, followed this recipe and was very disappointed that the fries turned out wet and soggy. We bumped up the oven temp to 425 and bingo! Crispy fries. Only about 7 minutes one side, 5 minutes on the other. Used a little spray of canola oil.

I found this recipe when searching for something to do with the zucchini in my CSA box. It turned out really well, even though I made some modifications. I only had Italian seasoned bread crumbs on hand, so I used those (and didn't add the salt and pepper), and the fries turned out really well. I especially liked how crispy the breading turned out, which was a surprise, since they were just baked in the oven. I also didn't have the ingredients for the tomato coulis, so I served the fries with ranch dressing instead, and that was really yummy! My toddler even liked these fries, which definitely makes them a keeper.

The tomato coulis was wonderful. I made a side salad using the meat of the tomatoes; used the end pieces and a couple of more tomatoes for the coulis. Did not go through the hassels of peeling and coring. Turned out fine. I followed the fries receipe and right before I placed the fries in the oven, sprinkled with olive oil. Made them really crispy.

I took the most recent advice, put fries on a rack, lightly sprayed with oil, and baked at 425 for 20 min in top part of oven. They browned nicely and were crispy and not soggy at all. Greatr suggestions, and fabulous results!

Based on some earlier reviews, I changed the oven temp to 425. I used Panko bread crumbs and mixed in a little garlic powder/salt/pepper. I put the fries on a wire rack placed inside the baking sheet (something I always do when doing baked versions of fried foods) to prevent sogginess and sprayed the tops of the fries with a little olive oil. I was really pleased with how they came out and my husband liked them too! They were very crunchy. I don't know if this is weird, but my husband requested ranch dressing for dipping instead of the coulis.

The first time we made this, we were out of eggs so I used olive oil instead; the second time we used the eggs. Much to our surprise we liked the olive oil version better. Also don't skip the coulis - we found it to be quite special and have used it on halibut steaks, tuna and a NY strip steak to great reviews.

Drowning in zucchini from two little plants in my garden. Running out of things to do with it. This recipe popped in my head as I was contemplating yet another zucchini on my counter. Wow! Turned out really good! Would've been better if fried in oil, but some of us have to give up those things. Didn't remember recipe exactly so put oven to 425 and baked 7 mins one side, 5 mins other. Gave fries a little spray of canola oil to help it brown. Used seasoned breadcrumbs and a jar TJ's marinara sauce. Fabulous. Will make again tonight.

Knowing zucchini can be pretty bland without a lot of help, I modified the recipe in several ways. Oven to 400. Sprayed the baking sheet with cooking spray. Put the salt and pepper and 1 teaspoon of garlic powder in the flour instead of the bread crumbs. Used 1/2 cup of SEASONED bread crumbs mixed with 1/2 cup of finely grated parmesan cheese. They came out crispy and full of flavor. The dish was met with rave reviews from the family, and I'd definitely make it again.

I used a 15oz can of tomato sauce and skipped the blender action. Loved the Coulis. Zucchinis ok, but not great.

Not really worth the effort. The sauted zucchini I made with the remainder of the zucchini I had was far superior and way easier.

Saw the first review, so I upped the temp to 400, which resulted in crispy fries. Overall, this was very bland. I even used Italian bread crumbs for extra flavor, but it did not manage to make the zucchini exciting.

Hubby and I are on a health kick as of late and bought a ton of yellow squash (which according to this recipe, is a suitable substitute for the Zucchini). I made this recipe despite the discouraging review prior to mine. I was actually pleasantly surprised. I did skip making the coulis and used store-bought (heated) marinara sauce for dipping the "fries", and it actually was a delicious combination!

I've been using epicurious for years, and this is the first time the outcome has been inedible. The "fries" were mushy and flavorless and the "coulis" was watery and didn't taste unique at all. Pass on this one!
