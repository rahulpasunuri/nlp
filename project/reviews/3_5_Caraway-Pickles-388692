Made these on Sunday, and today, they are really just ready to eat- although, we have been picking at them. I will most definitely make these again, however I would use less salt- found them a wee bit too salty.I also would bruise the caraway seeds some in a mortar and pestle before adding them to release a bit more of the oil, and flavor. Overall, a very EASY preparation with good results. I think these would be dynamite on grilled burgers.

These pickles are absolutely addictive. You will find yourself venturing to the fridge every 30 minutes for another taste. My 2 year old loves them. Give them 3 days, they are still a bit young after 24 hours. I used a little more salt, sugar and water the second time around for a milder finish, as written they are a bit tart. I was also a bit heavy handed on the red pepper for more spice, and I ran the caraway seeds a couple rounds in a mortar and pestle to release the oil from the seeds, otherwise the pickles dont really taste like their name. Really good with the Peach-Bourbon Brisket they were paired with.
