I followed the recipie exactly. The Quessadilla itself was good. The asapargus and onion are a great pair and the flavor is unique. But I just wasn't impressed by the lime cumin cream. I love both lime and cumin. But it was boring and needed some other sauce to really bring out the flavor of the quesadilla. Also, on high and within 3" of the burner, one of my quesadilla's caught fire. That is way too close.

Add some fresh manilla mangos inside the quesadilla to balance out the spice and it becomes a homerun.

When we sat down to dinner, I was surprised at how bland and boring this meal was. I can usually plan a whole weeks worth of meals based on high ratings like this. Very let down. Will not make again or try to reinvent. Waste.

Quesadillas are great because you can add just about anything to them and they will turn out great. What I love the most about this recipe is the cumin lime cream. It really made the dish.

My family loved this recipe! I made one modification, I used a griddle to toast the quesadilla with a small amount of butter...yummmmmmy!

3.5 Forks!! I didn't exactly follow the directions, but I used the ingredients. I added chicken and sauteed the veggies in a pan. It was a delicious appetizer and I will definitely add cumin to my sour cream going forward.

Easy, delicious recipe. Everyone loved it as an appetizer. As suggested, I added portabella mushrooms. Next time I make it I will cook asperagus and portabellas for 10 minutes and onions for 15 (25 for onions was too much). 2 that were broiled were burnt, the other 2 heated at 400 then flipped. This worked much better! We forgot to use the sour cream mixture in the fridge, but they were great without. Except for the assembly, I made everything in the morning.

Very easy to make & asparagus with onion is a delicious combination. I added some roasted chicken breast seasoned with salt & cumin and served with roasted tomatoes and cumin lime cream.

I didn't make the sour cream, but the quesadilla was delicious! I will definitely make it again.

We loved this recipe! Made for friends and everyone raved. Do NOT leave off the cream sauce as some others have said. I found I added the cumin and lime juice to taste..which meant I used more than the recipe called for. Also salt in the cream sauce brings it altogether. It is a must! Tonight I made these as a main course by adding grilled chicken. Also since it was too hot to heat up the kitchen by roasting the veggies, I grilled them in a grill basket. So Yummy!

This was wonderful and very easy to make! I loved them! I followed the advice of previous reviewers and roasted the onions for 25 minutes and the asparagus for only the last 10. I also sauteed some mushrooms and minced garlic in 1 T. butter and olive oil. I will make again and probably add shrimp or chicken so my husband will have a little more filling.

10 plus. Served with some fresh salsa on the side. Would maybe add mushrooms, good idea! nyc

I grilled these this past weekend and served them with the Spicy Grilled Skirt Steak (also on this site). They are excellent! The cream sauce is a waste of calories, the quesadillas don't need it. Garnish with some lime wedges and sprigs of cilantro!

I made this at a dinner party and it came out absolutely delicious. I added shitake mushrooms and served with corn salsa along with the cumin lime cream. I found the cream to be so-so. I would definitely make this again.

Everyone loved these, even my wife who doesn't like asparagus. As many others have suggested, I added the pre-cut asparagus to the onions after 20 minutes. I wasn't blown away by the Cumin Lime Sauce, but it was a nice touch.

I love this site! With the added suggestions of other reviewers, I added chopped portabellos and grilled shrimp and made this an excellent entree. As others have suggested, I cooked the onions for 15 minutes then added the already chopped asparagus and mushrooms for another 10. Don't think it would be enough filling for me without the added mushrooms and shrimp. The lime sour cream sauce was good too.

Rating: 4
These are excellent! I impressed my guests. I made half the recipe to accompany drinks before dinner. The half recipe made enough for three quesadillas, which was a bit much for four people. I plan to make these for dinner next time for my husband and me, with soup. Yum!

Love this! My company loved it too. Easy and quick to prepare if you roast the onions and asparagus ahead of time. I discovered I didn't have any cumin, so used a bit of taco seasoning for the sauce. Everyone loves this.

Love it! Have made this several times. I've added Portabella mushrooms and experimented with other cheeses ....feta, goat, both good. I'm going to make it for a cocktail party this weekend and add shrimp as recommended by others. Thanks. This is a great web site, I use it all the time.........so much easier than pulling out all the cookbooks.

I have made these quesadillas several times as an appetizer for parties and even men who curl there nose when they find out these are "vegetarian" quesadillas always come back for seconds. Skip the cumin lime cream though.

Marvelous! Everyone in our Gourmet Club raved. I, too, followed the former reviewers advice and cut the asparagus before roasting. These are very easy to make.

Easy and delicious. I roasted the onions and added the asparagus (like the reviewer before me). It worked out well. I will make it again adding mushrooms and experimenting with cheese.

Rating: 3
Scrumptious! I took another reviewer,s advice and roasted the onions for about 20-25 minutes, and during the last 10 minutes put in the asparagus already cut up. I also added brown mushrooms cut in thirds in one half of the pan alongside the asparagus. My boyfriend agreed that it was a good combination. A definite keeper!

I made these a year ago for a cocktail party that served as a school fundraiser; they disappeared quickly. Next week is another cocktail party/fundraiser so I wanted to make them again. Delicious.

These are wonderful and so easy to make. I added some shrimp which went well with the other ingredients. Going to try it with the goat cheese next time, I'll be making these often!

We really like the cumin sour cream that was served with this recipe. I used jalapeno havarti cheese but next time I might try goat cheese as well for a more sophisticated taste.

These were delicious and so easy to make. I substituted Mexican cheese mix for the pepperjack cheese but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I served them with the Grilled Garlic Skirt Steak, which went very well with the quesadillas. The steak recipe serves 2 "generously", and the combination of the two dishes was more than enough to serve as dinner for my husband ,teenage son and myself. I'll be making this many times during asparagus season!

Awesome! When I told my husband what I was making tonight, he expressed disgust. After the meal, however, he said this was one of the best "Mexican" dishes he ever ate. Very simple to make. I used habanero jack cheese, no cilantro. Sour cream sauce was great -- don't skip the lime juice, though. It makes the sauce. Also used a fresh salsa on top of the quesadilla.

I used a Mexican Cheese mix instead of the Pepperjack, and I added some sliced black olives. Everyone loved it.

We made this dish as an appetizer for a NYC crowd visiting our house on the Delaware this past weekend, and it was a huge hit. Instead of roasting the asparagus and onion, we grilled them a day ahead, and then, just in time to eat them, we built the quesadillas and grilled them, too. We, too, substituted goat cheese -- worth the extra expense!

I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe. It was fantastic. I served it with corn and a green salad with mangos, toasted almonds, and a slightly sweet raspberry vinaigrette.

I made this recipe with several substitutions/revisions. I used goat cheese instead of Jack Cheese, and prepared the onions as directed in the recipe. However, I didn't use the asparagus because I didn't have it on hand. For extra falvor, I spread some pesto on the tortillas before the goat cheese and onions. Also, I didn't have lime juice for the sour cream sauce, so I used lemon juice (fresh) instead. Very delicious! Company loved it.

I would make this again, but maby use less asparagus, or substitute with bell peppers and olives. Very delicious

These were delicious! The cumin lime cream was a nice touch. We made the quesadillas the next day and the asparagus and onion had even more flavor than the first time around.

I made this several times during asparagus season and loved it. I skipped the cilantro as well, and it still had a ton of flavor. The cumin-lime sauce is delicious and we practically licked the bowl clean!

These are the best quesadillas. We absolutely loved them. I roasted the onions for 25 minutes, stirring every 5, and added the asparagus, already cut up, for the last ten. The onions take on a carmelized flavor -- awesome! The quesadillas were great paired with the Mixed Green Salad with Jicama, Mango and Cashew...

I served this dish as an appetizer at our monthly supper club. It won rave reviews from a very discerning audience. Roasting the vegetables was a little tricky -- the smoke kept setting off my smoke alarm! Once they got a little brown, I gave the vegets a quick toss in a saute skillet to make them tender. I used 10 inch tortillas and folded them in half. To serve, I sliced the half-moon tortillas into quarters. Would suggest making a double batch of the sauce -- it was a real hit.

Rating: 3
Skipped the cilantro.....was still excellent. Instead of broiling I baked at 450 for about 10- 12 minutes. After oiling the cookie sheet, I as- sembled the quesadillas, then brushed the top tortilla with oil.....worked just fine.

even without the sauce this is a winner! roasting the vegetables is the key.
