It's great. But of course I didn't follow the recipe exactly... then again I never do... I did a persian inspired twist. Rather than adding a little parsley at the end, consider adding a lot at the beginning. It'll cook down and become an amazing main ingredient, and it tastes incredible. I used cilantro, too, about a full bunch of both. Also the stew needs fat! I added a few TB butter and took the cayenne suggestion from another reviewer. Added a full lemon's worth of lemon juice. Skipped the vinegar. Couldn't be happier with the results!!! The recipe is a great starting point; I'll be making my version again for sure.

We've loved this soup for years. I always add about a half pound of sliced kielbasa. If I have them on hand, I add a handful or two of grape tomatoes. Everything else is the same as written except sometimes forget the vinegar and parsley and still love it.

Definitely a good post-holidays winter soup -- filling, but not overly rich. I find that the lentil-brown rice combo a little bland, and in need of a kick in the pants to make this yummy, tho, which the andouille provides. One thing: I found that the amount of liquid suggested was totally inadequate for stew, much less soup. I added eight cups of broth, and about 1/4 cup of water to the bowl I just reheated for lunch.

A bit dissapointed with this, especially after reading some of the more glowing reviews. The addition of balsalmic certainly gave it a much needed kick, but it was nowhere near as good as simple lentil soup. For some reason, the "beefy" flavour of the lentils did not come through, and the brown rice nearly dissolved by the time the lentils were thoroughly cooked.

Last night I held a small dinner party made only of food from my kitchen cabinet as I prepare to move. It was a pretty random menu (this soup, lychee fruit cocktails and chocolate pound cake with strawberry sauce) but that was what i had in my cupboard and I was determined to use it all up. With that I had some substitutions: tomato paste for the canned tomatoes, champagne vinegar for cider, veggie broth for chicken broth, and I added about a cup of barley and some wild rice (since I was cleaning out the cabinet...). It turned out wonderfully. It was so good that everyone had two hearty bowls, even though it was a hot July night with no AC. This really is a versatile recipe and I will make it again and again. Stirring in the parsley and vinegar at the end really take it from slop to delish.

Perfect. I added low-fat chicken sausage (with sun-dried tomatoes in it) 10 minutes before the end. I will try a different low-fat sausage alternative next time.

Healthy and easy to make. Because of this I'll make it again. I didn't add sausage.

Very yummy! Much less of a soup since it was so thick. Very substantial on it's own, but I can imagine it would be awesome with sausage added, as other reviewers have mentioned. However, for health's sake, I'll stick with it as is. I used balsamic vinegar instead of cider, and it was perfect. I'll definitely make this again. Perfect for a cold winter night.

This is cheap, easy, healthy, great flavour, and my boyfriend loves it. Used home made chicken stock which gave a boost to the flavor. Try balsamic vinegar with this, very good. I added kilbasa as well. Freezes very well

I liked this soup, but I have to say that it is not my most favorite lentil soup of all time. I added a pound of sausage, but surprisingly, I'm not sure if it added anything but fat to an otherwise healthy soup. I used a little bit more chicken stock than was suggested because I didn't like the idea of a dish that could be served as a "soup or a casserole." I do have to say that this soup was incredibly easy to make, and was one of the least time-consuming soups that I have ever made.

I add cayanne to this -- lots of lentils and rice to absorb the heat. I sometimes also add browned italian sausage. Does all this make it the same recipe?

I discovered this recipe by accident while searching for a lentil and rice pilaf and tried it last night. Sometimes simple can be best. Those who said this recipe is boring probably don't take the initiative to season to their taste and make adjustments for personal preferences. I altered the recipe by subbing barley for half the brown rice and by adding cayenne pepper and lots of chopped fresh dill to the finished soup. I also added rehydrated dried mushrooms and topped each serving with a drizzle of truffle oil-it went really well with the earthy flavours. Today I had a bowl for lunch and it was even better!! Quick to throw together, hearty and healthy-highly recommended for the chilly season ahead.I will be making it throughout the winter.

We make this all through the colder months. I use Muir's fire roasted tomatoes which really gives it a great flavor. Use chicken stock instead of water. Excellent. It's a cool fall day, so I immediately thought of this recipe.

What a disappointment! I've been hearing about this recipe for years, and I am a huge fan of all the components: lentil soup, brown rice, and kielbasa. B O R I N G. Mine took a very long while to cook/soften up, probably because the acidity in the tomatoes affected the lentils. The rice just washed the whole thing out, imo. I'll be back to making my own lentil soup recipe henceforth.

Rating: 3
Wonderful. So it's thick: add water or eat it like a casserole. I halved the recipe, substituted barley for brown rice (equal amount barley and lentils), made it in a crock pot. When it was done, I turned the pot off, stirred in the spices and 1/2 lb keilbasa slices, cover it and let it cool.

This is a winter favorite of ours, ever since discovering the recipe on this site. I always add about a half pound of sliced kielbasa. Sometimes I forget the parsley and/or vinegar, and we still love it, but I think they do add overall to its savoriness.

I'm trying to be true to the rating system here. I thought this soup was "just so-so" and so it gets one fork. The parsley and vinegar took it from boring vegetable sludge to almost inedible for me (and those are both ingredients I enjoy!). My husband and I ate it and saved the leftovers.....lots and lots of them....which will get eaten out of a desire not to waste food. I did not take any shortcuts and did everything as written. In the end, the only saving grace was a horrific amount of salt. There are wonderful, flavorful, and simple recipes on this web site -- this ISN'T one of them!!

Not quite "a dish beyond compare" but an excellent winter soup. I have mande this many times, and make a few variations: Slightly less tomato and less rice than called for plus I add more celery. I slice and brown kielbasa in the soup pot first, then remove and add veggies for a few minutes, then the liquids, etc. Return sausage to the pot just enough to warm through at the end or you lose a lot of flavor. I also refresh with a bit more herbs for the last 10 min. or so. Parsley after I remove from heat, and cider vinegar at the table. Puzzled by the mention of adding cheese to this one. Family and guests like this one very well as it is. Thick (very), hearty, filling, healthy and great on a blustery day.

I have long been a lover of and advocate for lentils, and I found the combination of the lovely legume with brown rice to be just great--and the vinegar is the perfect final touch. i threw in a handful of raw sliced mushrooms at the beggining of cooking, and also added chopped raw spinach and curly endive at the very end: delicious. oh and a touch of parmesean cheese is just the ticket.

I have been making this recipe since it first appeared in Gourmet in March 84. I use 8 cups of broth (made with water and a few boullion cubes)- It is easy--I start the rice and lentils cooking while chopping the vegetables. It does get very thick, and I always have to add even more tomato liquid or bouillion.

I made this dish as is (with veggie broth though) and gave it three forks, then made a few changes and gave it four. I added more garlic, used eight cups of veggie broth and no water, halved the tomatoes, left out the celery, and left the soup in the fridge overnight so the flavors can blend. The recipe makes enough for me for six lunches, but I generally make more and freeze it. Delicious served with hot buttered toast on a cold day.

This recipe is excellent! Made it for family dinner, took 5-10 min to prepare, and the kids loved it too! I added 1 lb of kielbasa at the end of cook time to heat up. The vinegar gave it great flavor. Simple and delicious--can't wait to have leftovers for lunch!

This is a good dish, but not spectacular. I added turkey smoked sausage and followed the rest of the recipe to the letter. My husband really liked it as well as my 1yr old, so I will make it again. I'm not a fan of tomatoes in bean soup for some reason, so maybe that's why it just didn't wow me. It is good, though. I like the thickness, wouldn't thin it a bit.

This recipe is one of our family's standards. I first saw the recipe in the Jane Brody Good Food Book, and it mentioned that it is from Gourmet Magazine. The soup is thick, and adding the cider vinegar in the end is wonderful. This soup makes such a large batch, that I put it in ziplocks and freeze the remainder (it freezes great)! I usually serve it with cornbread.

Yum, yum, Add sausage as suggested (we used kilbasa--it was on hand--but I think andouille would be MUCH better). Also, browned slightly the onion, celery and carrots first to deepen flavors. OTher wise, it was great as it. And yes, the husband loved it.

This is a great recipe! I've made it several times this winter and it's always gone in just a couple of days. Considering there are just two of us, this is quite an accomplishment. I always add just a little more cider vinegar than the recipe calls for and use grilled chicken chunks instead of sausage. And we don't mind it being a bit think-it's more hearty and filling and the ingredients have blended better at that point.

Rating: 4
absolutely amazing. one of the few recipes i follow exactly (okay, well, sort of). this soup may seem rather blah and unspectacular when you read the ingredients, but don't be fooled - it may just be the most comforting, bone warming dish i've ever tasted. this is what i eat to remind myself how great life really is - i'm not kidding. a few tips - use FRENCH green lentils if available (they add a nice slightly peppery taste), do add sausage as suggested (i like andouille), health valley chicken broth is the best base imo (doesn't overwhelm the flavor with sodium and additives), and don't tamper with the vinegar (cider vinegar MAKES this soup, but don't add more than called for or it will obliterate all other flavors). i adjust proportions tho - double the herbs & veggies, use fresh tomatoes and nearly 3x the amount called for, reduce brown rice and lentils by about 1/4 and toss in an extra can of broth. these proportions should also address some of the complaints in these reviews about the recipe not calling for enough liquid (and it doesn't) as well as boost the flavor and texture of the soup.

I guess lentil soups really just need some time to sit. I first tasted the soup after it'd cooked for about 50 minutes, right after adding the vinegar and parsley, and was not just underwhelmed but sort of put off by the taste, and really wondered why the soup got such rave reviews (especially since I really followed the recipe closely, which I usually have a hard time doing - except no celery and 1 T. balsamic instead of cider vinegar). An hour later after letting it sit on the stove, I tried it again and it was quite tasty. I added some chopped boca veggie smoked sausages (hadn't planned on it but figured it couldn't hurt), which made it even better. Looking forward to leftovers for lunch! I also used a blend of different kinds of brown rice put out by Lundberg, which added a bit of different texture/color, which I recommend. The batch of soup was HUGE for our 2-person household though - I'll halve it next time and have lots to freeze this time.

I've made this recipe lots of times, it's a failsafe winter standbye. Everyone I've shared it with has always asked for the recipe. I always add the sausage, but have never tried it with balsamic, maybe I'll risk it, but why toy with perfection?

This is a great soup. Have made it many times. I add more carrots, as I like the sweetness, and use balsamic vinegar. And definately use smoked sausage. It does thicken up, but so what? Add more broth or water! And it's even better the next day, and the next...

Burrrrp. I just finished this for lunch today. I've been making this for ten years now - ever since it was first published. It is my family's absolute favorite soup. Even my 5 year old daughter begs for more. I usually use balsamic vinegar, go heavy with the garlic and I add an extra cup of water. I drizzle some extra virgin olive oil on top just before serving. If I feel like it I'll throw in some italian sausage or kielbasa but it doesn't need it. Nice crusty bread and a salad and you've got an awesome meal. Every time I serve this to someone new I'm asked for the recipe.

This is a great soup! It's very easy and it is even better the second day! I also cut down to 1 tbsp on the cider vinegar and added a lb of turkey kielbassa. It's great to take to lunch. Serve it up with a fresh green salad! Totally Healthy!

I liked it a lot and am preparing to make it again. I soak my lentils in water for two or three days (changing the water once or twice a day) and have not had trouble with farting. (Well! It is a BEAN soup!). I prepare it up to the point where you add the vinegar and practically live on it for a week or so. (I add vinegar and parsley to each serving instead of the whole pot.) It's pretty good by itself, and delicious beyond compare with a smokey sausage.

This is a great recipe, but maybe some people missed the 3 cups of water added with the broth. I used 1 can chicken broth & 2 cans beef broth. I had no celery, but added extra tomatoes, and used 1 pound of turkey sausage. It was wonderful. No problems with it being dry or overly thick. I would absolutely make this again

Surprised at the mixed reviews as I and weekend guests thoroughly enjoyed this lunchtime meal. It is light and filling at the same time; the kielbasa(a must) adds richness while the cidar vinegar adds a brightness at the end. I tend to be a tad heavy handed with spices so use your own judgement. Crusty bread works well with it.

I've made this soup twice and I highly recommend adding extra virgin olive oil at the end. It really adds a lot to the flavor. Also, I substituted Balsamic Vinegar for cider vinegar, but not quite 2 Tbs. b/c it will take away from the other flavors in the soup. I am thinking about trying the cider vinegar though next time. This soup is very good tasting and good for you.

I have to say that I don't quite understand the rave reviews for this soup. I found it to be pretty average. I will make it again because I love the fact that it's so healthy, but it'll certainly never be among my favorite soups. In fact, it's really more like a rice dish since all the liquid is absorbed by the rice and lentils. If you want true soup, add considerably more broth.

After reading the reviews of this recipe I was really looking forward to trying it out. I was very unimpressed. The recommended 6 cups of chicken broth and 3 cups of water are not nearly enough. I had to add 2 additional cups of broth and a cup of water and mine still turned out too dry. I didn't even eat the leftovers.

I made this almost fat-free soup based on the rave reviews it received. It sounded all wrong. Garlic and onions should always be sauteed in something ... and surely the ingredients should be added at intervals. Wrong!!! Just put it all in the pot & simmer gently. The best soup I've come across in years. I used the French dark green/gray lentils, and balsamic vinegar. I might try adding some olive oil next time, although it holds it own just the way it is.
