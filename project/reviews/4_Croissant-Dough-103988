There's a good deal of art to croissants, which my teenagers have learned by trial and error. We've made at least two dozen mistakes we can identify. Pay special attention to these two groups of errors: A biscuit-like consistency can come from problems with rising and with temperature control. We've learned to proof the yeast and not to let the dough spend a second night in the fridge. Biscuit-like consistency can also happen if the butter layer gets too warm when the layers are too thin. If you do a final rise, try the fridge. If the dough is not sufficiently thawed after time in the freezer, the butter will break into small chunks. Thaw this dough and knead it into biscuits, it can't be rescued for croissants. Any chunks or thickened areas of butter melt during baking, making the croissants greasy and frying the bottoms black.

Truly fantastic. I used this dough for pain au chocolat, and the end result was better than what I had in multiple French bakeries (having just returned from France). The only change I made was to follow the suggestion of 20 minutes in the freezer versus an hour in the fridge between turns. Total fridge-chilling time once all turns were done was six hours. Will definitely make again.

I don't know why, but as another reviewer mentioned, both times I made this recipe, I came out with something that had the texture of dinner rolls (nothing at all like croissants), and I followed the recipe exactly. Given how time consuming this was, I don't think I'll be giving this another try.

The dough hard to work with not as pliable even after cooling. The layers after the croissant was baked was great, tasty, flaky, just like in the restaurant or better. I was able to make 12 big ones, some I stuffed with cheese, some I make au chocolate mouse with cinnamon by Lindt Chocolatier. Great taste. Simultaneously I made the recipe from Metropolitan Bakery using a starter. This recipe is more pliable, did not have hard time rolling, dough is more softer, layers great, great taste as well. Overall , I will use the recipe by Metropolitan Bakery cookbook.But for quick croissant fix I will Nancy's recipe since it does not require a starter.

These are delicious, though a bit time-consuming. I'm embarrassed to admit I always spread butter on my croissants before I made these because I had no idea how much butter they already contained! I used the dough to make the princess ring and the pains du chocolate: both were fabulous and well-received. All in all a fun and rewarding baking experience.

I decided to make these on a whim one Sunday morning. I happened to have all the ingredients, and they came together so easily. I cut down on almost all the chilling times just because of impatience. They turned out fantastic! I filled some with almond paste and others with chocolate. None of the filling oozed out as I expected it to. I felt like a pro after I turned out my first batch. Great recipe!

This was my first time making an kind of pastry, and although I can't say it was easy, these croissants turned out beautifully, *almost* as good as any that we had on a recent trip to Paris. I don't have a mixer so I kneaded the dough by hand for five or six minutes. I also didn't refrigerate between folds 2 and 3, and when I did refrigerate it was in the freezer for twenty minutes, as opposed to an hour in the fridge. I omitted the salt as I used salted butter, but next time I might add a wee bit. Crispy, buttery, golden... Gotta go eat another one!

I made vegan croissants using 2 sticks of vegetable shortening and 1 stick of vegan margarine, and I substitute the whole milk for rice milk. The only change I had to make was chilling the rolled croissants for an hour before proofing and baking or they collapsed. They are as flaky and delicious as any butter croissant I have had.

I have made Julia Child's croissant recipe for 25 years. When I saw that this recipe made 2 dz at a time, I decided to try it. These a great. My whole family loved them. I made some adjustments in the method. I don't have a standing mixer with a pastry hook so I mixed the ingredients in the bowl until well mixed, didn't take long, and then kneaded until it was smooth, 2 minutes max. I did folds 2 & 3 one after the other without cooling in the fridge in between. Even my mother who first taught me how to make croissant with Ms. Child's recipe is going to try this recipe.

This was soooo good. I don't have a stand mixer so I just hand kneaded for around 10 mins. After folding the butter inside I made 2 turns before the first refrigeration to save some time and took another reviewer's advice about 20 mins in freezer instead of an hour in the fridge. I used the dough to make butter croissants and it was met with raves from all.

This is an amazing recipe! So flaky, and full of yummy goodness. I used a little too little salt, but otherwise perfect. I made 22 croissants out of this recipe. Be careful to put the last snip underneath the croissant or it unrolls itself when it starts to rise. The person who detailed how to roll out, and bake the recipes in other comments had it right on. I cant wait to make these for Christmas morning. It wasnt nearly as difficult as I thought it would be.

Can I just say WOW!! I have always been intimidated by the whole croissant making idea. But I decided to take the plunge and try my hand, and I am so glad that I did. They were fabulous on my first attempt. It was a time consuming process, but since the dough is in the refridgerator for most of the time, it was easy to get on with other things in between rollings. My husband and children managed to devour the batch within hours. I will certainly be making these on a regular basis.

My daughter decided to try her hand at making croissants during our recent cold snap (she's 17) and she made this recipe. The croissants were WONDERFUL -- the only change we would make is to decrease the oven time at each cycle since these came out a little more golden that we'd like.

Coming from along line of french bakers (Family owned bakery in France from the 1800's) I am pretty fussy.Overall I did not care for the flavor or texture or rise of the croissants. I ended up finding a recipe on about.com. It calls for cold milk with the yeast.I believe this is what ultimately led to a better product since croissants really depend on the many layers you create for the puffiness and not for the rise with yeast as a typical bread does. I also prefer to use salted butter for the flavor instead of added salt to the recipe.I would not make this again;however I have made the other many times with rave compliments!( Even from my French uncle the current owner of the bakery in Paris!!

This recipe is absolutely delicious! I got rave reviews from all my family and friends and they could not believe that I had made these from scratch, much less that it was my first time making croissants! I did read lots of recipes online and I used some tips from each. For instance, when I shaped the butter block I sprinkled 3 Tbs flour over top and then pounded it into shape. When rolling the dough for the last time make a large rectangle of about 10" x 30", pull on corners to maintain a rectangular shape, then use a pizza cutter to cut it in half lengthwise (making two 5" wide strips), then cut into triangles. Place triangles flat onto cookie sheets and chill in the fridge for 15 minutes before rolling into croissant shapes. After rolling the finished dough into croissant shapes I brushed them with an eggwash made from 1 whole egg and 1 Tbs warm water and then let them rise for 1 hour, this gave them a lovely color and made for the lightly dimpled surface that croissants are known to have. When I baked them I set the oven for 375 degrees and let them bake for 4 minutes at 375, then I dropped the temp to 350 while they were in there. I baked them for a total time of 15 minutes and they seemed to just come out perfect! Don't touch them or try to transfer them off the cookie sheet until they have cooled completely or they will fall. THis includes brushing them with melted butter, let them cool first. Even the one that fell was delicious though! I ended up with about 20 large (6") croissants and I think I will make this recipe again this weekend because they are all gone! I did start the process the night before and let the dough rise in the fridge overnight. I see no need to try to crank this out in one day :-) People have an added appreciation for your efforts if they know it took two days to make!

Just made these. Made half the dough into croissants tonight and will do the princess ring with the other half in the morning. I rolled the croissants too thin and they seemed to deflate in the oven. The thicker ones were puffy and had beautiful layers. I don't think it's too much work, especially if you live in the middle of nowhere and can't purchase decent croissants. I do other things around the house while the dough is chilling and don't worry too much about being exactly on the hour with the rolling. Bottom line, good croissants, very light, very buttery, look professional.

I forgot to say in my last review that in my opinion, the butter you use is the key. No Land O' Lakes here - I use unsalted Danish Lurpak butter which is so creamy and sweet I think I have to get away from this PC to go and make some more! Also, I do another fold or two when I make them depending on my mood and time frame. Yep! It takes all day but well worth the time! Really!!

I have had a tried and true croissant recipe that I have used for years. I never ceased to impress my family and friends with it until I made these the other day and everybody said "these are really the best you have ever made!" Although I do take some liberties with the preparation, I can say I now have a new recipe!!

fabulous!My first time attempting pasteries and it was very time consuming but they ended up perfect. I made 1/2 filled with dove chocolate,some w/ dark &some w/ milk (because I had it) and 1/2 of the parma braid. Rave reviews from friends and family. I too wish I would have had a few pictures along with written instructions but after reading it a few times I got it. Followed recipe exactly up to baking time then went 8 min. before turning thanks to other peoples comments....they would have been over baked at 10.

I have used other croissant recipes in the past, and found the dough a little difficult to shape rectangular, but this dough was much easier to work with. I made butter croissants with half the dough and parma braids with the other half....excellent!

I lived in Montreal when this recipe appeared in Gourmet. My house was a ten-minute walk from 4 excellent bakeries, so I never had need to make croissants. Now I'm in Zambia, previously Northern Rhodesia in southern Africa, and while the natural beauty and wildlife are spectacular, I cannot say the same for things culinary. After trying a croissant from the my corner bakery that was really just bread in a crescent shape, I tried this recipe with success. I double it and freeze the finished product so I don't have to do it so often. The Montreal newspaper did a "best of" series and the croissant honors went to a patisserie called Le Duc de Bourgogne. The patissier there said he used salted butter in croissants so that's what I did rather than add salt to the dough.

Don't be intimidated by this recipe, it is much, much easier then it sounds. I didn't even use a dough hook, I just kneaded the dough together until it was smooth and slightly sticky. I only used 3 1/2 cups of flour in total. The dough was soft and it rose a lot in the fridge in between folds. Make sure to wrap it tightly in plastic wrap!

I answered my own question. You CAN freeze the finnished dough and let it thaw about 9 hrs ( or over night in the refridgerator). They came out perfect and absolutely deliscious!

Was a bit skeptical of this recipe. Wasn't sure brown sugar was the best choice but followed the recipe to the letter. After taking a few liberties with the technique I made some of the best croissants I've eaten, France not withstanding. I did not refrigerate the dough after the fourth turn. Instead, I let it warm to room temperature, and then rolled and shaped. I placed my croissants in a cold oven and heated it to 450. They baked beautifully--the tops were crispy and the insides buttery and flaky. Impressive if I do say so myself.

It is a wonderful croissant recipie. I had never made them before, but I found that by reading the recipe a few times and being armed with measuring tape as well as following the tips to freeze in between folds I was able to make some wonderful croissants. The only thing I wonder is if a couple of extra folds wouldn't have helped create even thinner layers? On some of the croissants the folds were very apparent.

For the cook who complained that the recipe didn't have cooking directions--the dough is an 'ingredient' in other recipes, like the Parma Braids.

Having studied Danish pastry in Paris, I should note there are some deviations from the traditional croissant preparation. First, you should always let the dough rise for an hour at room temperature, never in the fridge, after you first make it. Then, once it has doubled (usually an hour), you punch it down to get out the gases formed in the dough by the yeast. THEN you wrap it up and put it into the fridge. But the standard croissant recipes I learned in france all call for letting this dough rest for 20 to 24 hours, not longer, before making the folds. It's this process of warming and then chilling that gives the dough its texture. Also I don't think they have a temperature or time because that generally varies with what you're making iwth this dough. It's hugely versatile and be used for a number of pastries. Another major factor that distinguishes croissants in France is that they are made with what is known as "dry butter," or butter with a very low moisture base. To make these well, look for the very best butter you can find that doesn't have a lot of fat or moisture content. You can sometimes find dry butter at restaurant supply markets. Or ask a local baker where she gets it if they do Danish pastry. For croissants, you typically start them in the oven at around 375 degrees and shift the heat down to 350 degrees. Watch until they rise, but they are usually done after about 10 or 15 minutes. Let them set before you try to eat them, although it's tempting to try to eat them right out of the oven! Finding a cookbook or site with the "folds" would be helpful if you've never done turns. It's a bit confusing at first but a relatively straightforward technique to master.

I cut this recipe out 5 years and never had the guts to try it! I am currently a culinary arts student and having to make puff pastry in pastry class gave me the nerve to finally try this! The croissants came out flaky and delicious! I had friends over for croissants and they loved them. They pronounced them excellent - and they have eaten croissants in Paris! (Parisian croissants are better however.) So yes, I do recommend this recipe, especially if you have worked with layered doughs like croissant or puff pastry.

This is another attempt at croissant dough, and although this recipe is better than others I've tried, I don't think it's very good. I followed the directions word for word and the result were flat croissants. The butter DID form layers, but the dough didn't rise much when ready to bake, which is strange because the yeast flavor overwhelmed the pastry with a tart, almost sour, aftertaste. It was a major disappointment after a weekend's worth of work. I do not recommend this recipe.

Came across this recipe in the Oct. 2000 Gourmet magazine, but didn't make it until 2004! For my first attempt the results were great! I followed the recipe exactly and made parma braids w/ ham & cheese and also did choc chip fillings. I rolled them a bit thin, most ended up the length of your index finger. But they were so buttery and flaky, I ate at least 6! Whether from a bakery, grocery store, or coffee shop (at least in my neighborhood), store bought croissants don't come close to these! Thank you!

This is a really good recipe. My step-daughter really liked them and ate 3 in a row. I'm a pretty inexperienced baker so I made a 10 x 16 and 10 x 15 colored template, placed the template under a roul'pat and rolled the dough out onto the roul'pat. This made rolling the dough to the right size much easier (and faster) and the dough almost defaulted to a 1/4 inch thickness when I got it rolled to the right size. Also, when the dough was folded into thirds, it defaulted to the 10 x 5 size. I used a french rolling pin most of the time because it really made squaring off the dough much easier. I, like many who made this recipe before me, cut down the time between folds by chilling in the freezer and folding every 20-30 minutes. Ya'll enjoy!

A triumph! My first attempt at croissants and the results could not have been better--just like the ones I remember eating at the French patisseries in Morocco. I followed recipe exactly, and used Plugra (higher percentage butterfat). Determined croissants did better at eight minute intervals in the oven after a few burned bottoms.

This was my first attempt at croissants and they turned out beautifully...crisp and golden on the outside, buttery and tender inside!

This really does make the most light and delicious croissants. You haven't had real croissants until you've made them yourself. Not at all like the flat rubbery things you buy at bakeries here. I made them using organic spelt flour which has a nice nutty flavour and brings out the yeasty smell beautifully. Very easy to do even for a first time baker just takes a little time.

I never thought I'd have the patience to make my own croissants. This was fun! I made the dough for my niece's shower. Then I got creative with fillings, and made minis. Ham & cheese, fig & gorg, chocolate, raspberry & cream cheese. This dough, although time consuming, is very versatile, relatively easy, and makes a lot. If you have time for this before the holidays, you have it made!

I had never made croissant's until this recipe. I thought this recipe was very easy, and did produce wonderful croissants (I recently vacationed in Paris, so the comparison was fresh in my mind). I also live above 3,500 ft, and tried increasing the oven temp. by 25F - but would not do again - wound up burning some of the pastries. Oh well. . .

I have found this a most reliable and delectable recipe. I to like many of you have shortened it up a bit to get it done in one day. But I find it just as easy to whip it up before I go to bed at night then bake in the morning. Will try to make turnover out of it next.

I made this recipe and served the Croissants with Christmas dinner and they were fabulous! I used half of the dough for the croissants and the other half I rolled out a 10x15 sheet, cut then lengthwise in 2inch strips, spinkles them with cinnammon sugar and rolled them into sticky buns. I put 1 tsp melted butter in the bottom of a mega-muffin tin and added about 1 tblsp sugar mixture to bottom and sides of muffin cups. I then put the rolls into cups and baked them at 400degrees for 25 mins. The sugar/butter mixture made a nice caramel crust around the buns and they were delicious!!!

I like that this recipe uses dried yeast, and the results were superlative so far as texture and taste. The techniques are solid and bashing the butter until it's mallable is really good for stress-reduction. I made two changes. One was letting my dough rise for 20 minutes before the first chill and I cut the 8 hour wait to just 2 hours so I could do everything in one day. Two was that since I'm above 5000 ft, I raised all baking temps by 25 degrees. It turned out wonderfully.
