I just have to add, my daughter has been asking for this for her birthday cake every year since I first made it for her for her graduation in 2008 :)

Do NOT make this icing unless you don't care how your cake looks. And let's be honest, anyone who makes a torte cares how their cake looks, otherwise you would just put it in a 9x13 pan and be done with it... I made this cake for my daughter's birthday and could not get the icing to stay on the cake. I even added more powdered sugar and cut the lemon juice. It was a mess. A delicious mess, but still a mess.

I made this for my daughter's graduation party. It was easy, beautiful, and delicious. It got rave reviews from eveyone! This is a keeper.

This cake is truly decadent. Used 9in cake pans and that worked fine, and also used frosting from recipe but needed to refrigerate it from time to time because it is a bit gloopy. The cake also deflated and shrank from sides of pans, so the layers weren't perfectly uniform in diameter and looked a bit odd when the cake was put together. Regardless, this is now my husband's official Birthday Cake. For the cook below, the lemon curd is in the frosting.

This was truly excellent! I am definetly not the greatest baker (I usually find a way to mess up desserts, but this came out great) everyone had seconds! I used another recipe for Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting from this site- at another reviewers suggestion- but kept the raspberry presserves as well. Everyone raved about it. Thanks!

Excuse me, Where does the lemon curd come in? I see it mentioned several times in reviews.

Yummmm!! I made this last night for a coworker's birthday and served it today at lunchtime. It was a huge hit!! One of the prettiest cakes I've ever made as well. I'm thinking of making it for my daughter's upcoming baby shower.

Made as cupcakes and it was pretty good but 6 eggs?! I thought it tasted a bit 'eggy' and dense, especially compared to the "Old Fashioned Coconut Cake" cake-mix-modification receipe I used to make my coconut cupcakes. (On this site) I followed the reviews modification and it was much better than the lemon ones I made. Next time I want easy lemon cake I will follow that reciepe and just substitute lemon cake and lemon for the coconut.

This cake is so good and great for hot summer days. I used lemon curd between the middle layer instead of the preserves and it was delicious.

I made this cake along with the Tropical Carrot Cake and the Double Chocolate Layer Cake (from this site) for my mother's 75th birthday party. All three were hits but this one was my favorite. Just enough sweet and sour. I did, however, have to tweak the frosting by adding more powdered sugar to get it to thicken.

Yummy & easy. I used the lemon cake mix and followed all other directions. To avoid overmixing the creamcheese I used a potato masher to mostly mix in the lemon curd. I then let it sit for a few hours to bring fully to room tmp. The frosting was very thick w/no refrigeration. Highly suggest extra jam & letting it sit overnight. To avoid jam showing on side, stop 1/4in from edge.

Fabulous! I read all the reviews prior to making the cake. I decided to make it with the yellow cake mix first and am glad I did. I think the lemon cake mix would have made it too lemony for my taste. I also made it with half blueberry preserves and half raspberry. The blueberry made the cake a little sweeter whereas the raspberry made it more zippy and sour. Frosting: I used room temp. regular cream cheese and it was still a little runny. I chilled the frosting in 3/4 cup batches before using and that seemed to help. It was still a little 'loose,' but that got covered up by the almonds! What I will change next time: 1. Use all blueberry preserves 2. Experiment a little more with the frosting 3. Definitely make it the day before- much better the second day Enjoy!!

A simple, delicious, and rewarding recipe! I made this for my mom's birthday, and am no kind of baker...everyone loved it and called me the next day to swoon over it some more. Light and custardy, almost wedding-cakeish. I added a little almond flavoring to the batter. Make sure to read all the comments on the icing...it can be problematic and I can imagine a different icing might work better and taste as good.

If it weren't for the fact that the cake it self comes form a box (it's usually against my religion), this cake would be/is flawless. My best freind who is not usuallty a fan of sweets askd for this cake year after year and for any special occasion. We now refer to it as "Heather Cake".

I love this cake! I made it for my great aunt and uncle's 65th wedding anniversary and actually skimped a little on the frosting just so I could have some leftover to enjoy later. I will definitely make this again and again.

I tried making this cake yesterday to take to a birthday today. I used a lemon cake mix but other than that followed the directions exactly. It pancaked after removal from the oven. I tried it again this morning with the same result. Off to the bakery I went...

I have gotten nothing but non-stop raves when I have made this cake. Just wonderful; tastes like it is from scratch. Can be tweaked with orange instead of lemon and any jam for the layers. I haven't used the almonds, but have put strawberries or raspberries on the sides/top. Both times, I made the cake one day, iced it the next and refrigerated it until I brought it to work. Highly recommend it.

Great recipe! My son and husband aren't big cake eaters and this one dissapeared. I have a lemon tree full of lemons and am trying to find ways to use them up so I made my own lemon curd for the frosting. Also used a little less cream cheese and a little more powdered sugar in the frosting for a little more body, other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I liked the almonds on the sides, it looked nice and added a nice flavor.

WONDERFUL AND EASY. NO NEED TO GO TO THE BAKERY FOR A BIRTHDAY CAKE ANY LONGER. MAKE IT YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY FOR THIS ONE...

I have made this cake several times. ALWAYS a hit. I use only 1 tbsp of lemon juice in the frosting ~ it turns out thicker that way. I also make the cake several days in advance, slice the layers and then wrap them individually & freeze them. I put the cake together with the frozen layers. Works great every time!

This is my first review of my first epicurious recipe. I made it to impress my and my husband's parents who were meeting for the first time - for four days in our house. This was my "Look! We're all grown up and doing fine!" cake/visit. It was loved by all. Made it the night before everyone came, and served it 24 hours later. Used lemon cake mix and added extra zest and juice to cake and frosting; rest was as is. My father-in-law thought for sure it was store-bought. Very lemony. Cake was dense, but preserves kept it almost 'cream cake'-like. The frosting was the consistency of pudding (& great tasting!), so I left the whole bowl in the fridge, taking out just 3/4c at a time in a measuring cup to do the layers. Then promptly put and left the frosted cake in the fridge when not being "used". Oh, and I sprinkled fresh blueberries (store was out of raspberries) and lemon zest on top and around the sides. (Left out the almonds.) Yummy!

This was a beautiful and delicious cake! I took other people's suggestions and used lemon cake mix, dark rum instead of water, and after baking sprinkled the layers with brandy to keep them moist. I also added juice from one lemon to the batter and juice and peel from two lemons to the frosting. I didn't use the almonds on the sides and it was still great. It looked beautiful when sliced and the lemon frosting was refreshingly tart - definitely a keeper! It's one of those cakes that makes you look like you're a professional baker =)

'Followed this recipe exactly as written and it turned out great! I made this for a my bunco group of 12 women and they loved it! Tasty and easy to make. Made it a day ahead and the flavors combined nicely. Was a little leary of the frosting with all the reviews of the "sloppy frosting" but beat it less then the two minutes required and it was nice and thick. Would definately make again, makes a nice "elegant" dessert!

This cake was very easy and tasty. I did'nt have raspberry jam so I used kiwi jam instead. It went well with the lemon. The layers were attractive & cut beautifully .This is a great recipe for a good cake in a flash.

I made this cake for my daughters Birthday as she loves anything made with lemons. Wow!!! What a hit this cake is with the moist cake and the beautiful layers as you cut and serve this treat. I too added LOTS more lemon zest to up the lemon flavor. I also chose a different lemon frosting, made with cream cheese and no lemon curd, from this sight as I was scared about the consistency of the above frosting. This cake is SOOO easy and beautiful AND tastes better a couple of days later because the raspberry layer soaks a bit into the cake layers. Is your mouth watering??? Make it tonight, you won't be disappointed.

I served this cake for Christmas Eve dessert decorating the top with lots of fresh raspberries and sprigs of mint - turned out very pretty. While not quite beyond compare, it was very good (and so easy). I wouldn't hesitate to make it again.

Rating: 4
Is this truly a cake "beyond compare?" Probably not quite, but it being so quick and easy to prepare pushes it into the "beyond compare" category (4 forks). It is always a big hit, and tastes like a truly labor-intensive dessert. One thing to watch out for--don't overbeat the cream cheese for the frosting or you end up with a soupy (albeit delicious) mess that is more sauce than frost[ing].

Rating: 4
This was a big hit with my co-workers. I too had problems with the frosting, so refrigeration is a must - as is doubling the lemon zest in both the cake and frosting. In fact I refrigerated the cake to set the frosting between the layers before frosting the top and sides. I had wondered why the almonds needed to be added, but found out they hide the jam/frosting mess on the sides of the cake. I thought coconut flakes would be a good substitute for the nuts next time.

This is a great recipe that always receives rave reviews. Only advice is to not be shy with the lemon peel--adding more will really help the icing.

Fabulous cake with a very nice presentation. My husband, who won't even eat cake, loved it! Next time I'll try the chambord sprinkled over the layers that another reviewer suggested.

Gee, did I miss something? I was really looking forward to this cake because of the reviews and found it mediocre. It was heavy and wet. I had no trouble making it (be sure your cream cheese is cool not room temp.). Can't recommend it.

This cake, although it calls for a box cake mix, is superb!!! The only alterations I made were using walnuts in place of almonds and adding white chocolate shavings to the top. It was definately the topic of conversation and a great way to end the evening.

Wonderful lemon flavor! I deviated tremendously from the recipe but it still came out great. I didn't have 2 9" sprinform pans so i just used my large 10" pan and made 2 layers instead of 4. The cake came out very dense but very yummy. I also decided to try store bought cream cheese frosting instead of making it from scratch. I made my own lemon curd and then added it to the frosting with some lemon juice. Yum Yum Yum! Next time I'll try using two 9" pans and see if there's any difference in consistency. Over all, this was a fantastic tasting cake immensely enjoyed by everyone at my work (made for a coworker's b-day).

Delicious and easy. However,I always substitute Rum for water in box cakes, dark or light works equally well. The alcohol bakes out, leaving the flavor in the cake and prolongs the moisture without being soggy. It keeps it from getting stale as fast. ....Before frosting, sprinkle cake layers with Chambord or Cognac; again, alcohol evaporates leaving flavor. Alternate cake mix suggestion, Duncan Hines Butter Recipe Yellow Cake Mix, on the side try the Sock-it-to Me Cake.

I took the suggestions that others mentioned (used lemon cake mix, added more lemon peel to the cake and to the frosting) and the cake turned out beautifully. This is a marvelous recipe that I'll use again and again!

My daughter and I made this cake together for her 8th birthday. We decorated it with fresh edible flowers - it looked so beautiful and tasted delicious, our guests just loved it. It's a perfect blend of home made and easy (the boxed cake mix).

This recipe was easy to make and elegant to present. Previous comments were greatly appreciated. I did chill the lemon curd and made the cake the night before needed. I substituted a lemon flavor cake mix - terrific! Since I had three spring-form pans, 3 different sizes, I substituted 4 8" cake pans to make the four layers. I baked them for 20 minutes. Easy and it turned out great!

The sentence about what to do with almonds was accidentally omitted, but it has been fixed. Using them as a garnish (as the Sacramento cook did) sounds like a great idea as well!

Terrific! A little patience with the frosting, and you'll be fine. I let it chill first and it was much easier to work with. My family LOVES this cake! A real winner!

Very light tasting, despite all of the cream cheese in the frosting. The recipe calls for a cup and a half of toasted almonds, but doesn't tell you what to do with them. I ended up sprinkling a few on top as a garnish. The frosting is very soft. I have made it several times now and have a few tips for success. 1) Make sure the cake is stone-cold before you fill and frost it. 2) Chill the lemon curd and only bring the cream cheese to cool room temp. 3) Also measuring is critical. 4) Cool room temperature MUCH better than warm or hot rooms (e.g. make it during the spring or fall, or with the A/C on). 5) If still a tad bit too soft to spread, chill in refrigerator for a little bit (15-30 minutes?), and it will stiffen up some. Don't allow to get too stiff, just to proper spreading consistency.

This Lemon Torte was excellent. I had to add some extra powdered sugar to make the frosting thick enough to stick to the sides (don't thicken it too much as it sets in the refrigerator). I was a big hit with Easter Dinner.

This cake was amazing! So rich and lemony and it was a nice presentation, too. Made it for a birthday cake and everyone loved it. I used two 9 inch round pans instead of the two springform pans and it came out fine. Defintely would make again!
