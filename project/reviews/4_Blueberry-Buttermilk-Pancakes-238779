Warning ratings purists: I am rating the recipe according to my alterations. :) Alterations: added vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon juice and zest; subbed coddled milk for buttermilk. I am rating while eating said pancakes with my mother. Overall, good flavor. The lemon compliments the blueberries nicely. The texture is fluffy and somewhat spongy, but this is probably helpful given the blueberries. I think these would be tasty with toasted pecans mixed in. We halved the recipe and it made 5 pancakes using the 1/3 c. measure for batter.

So this is a good recipe but it doesn't really pop until you add lemon juice/zest. This makes a huge difference to the pancakes. Add sour cream too to make even fluffier.

This has become favorite, go to pancake recipe. It is also one of the few recipes I don't tweak. In an early rookie mistake I thought the batter looked too thick and I thinned it out a bit. Wrong! They tasted fine, but lacked the fluff and richness of the unadulterated batter. No one in my family particularly likes blueberry pancakes, so I just make them plain with REAL maple syrup. I do want to try this recipe with huckleberries some day. Just a few suggestions: -If you don't have buttermilk on hand, coddled milk works fine (I read somewhere that the buttermilk in the stores is actually just coddled milk, anyways). To coddle the milk, let regular milk come to room temp and mix in a tablespoon of distilled vinegar or lemon juice, wait about 15 minutes. -Like any pancake recipe, don't over beat or mix! Mix just enough to let the dry ingredients become wet. -I have never read this in any pancake recipe, but from experience, the batter seems to increase in volume when it sits for a bit. I suppose it's just raising from the baking powder reacting to the gluten (or whatever the scientific explanation is...ask Alton Brown). What I do know is the pancakes are lighter and fluffier if the batter has sat at least 10 minutes before cooking. -I seem to have better results cooking on a slightly cooler griddle than I normally would. To the "one fork" reviewer who complained that your pancakes were burnt on the outside and mushy in the middle; you were rating your cooking method, not the recipe. I'd lay odds that your griddle was just too hot. Terrific recipe that I will use for years to come!

I have been making pancakes for 20 years and this is the best recipe ... I always throw cinnamon in and the combination of all the ingredients was perfect. Try this recipe, you won't be disappointed.

Brilliant recipe-- light, fluffy, delicious. The perfect pancake. I prefer it with a tsp or so of vanilla extract, and with the blueberries added to the pancakes as they cook on the griddle rather than to the dough. Also, if I'm cooking with butter, I turn the heat down to a smidge below medium to prevent unsightly overbrowning.

Rating: 1
Decided to try this recipe since I had some buttermilk on hand. Won't be doing this one again - they wanted to burn and not cook inside and were way too dense and "mushy". I did not overstir the batter and don't know what my problem was, but won't be making these again.

Rating: 4
This is one of the best pancakes recipes ever. They are light and fluffy every time and are good even without blueberries added. I have used sliced bananas dropped in them as they cooked in the pan before flipping and that was a nice change as well. Easy and quick, doesn't get any better.

Who says you can't have breakfast-for-dinner on a Tuesday night? For whatever reason after my run, I had a hankerin' for blueberry pancakes, and thanks to my blueberry purchase/splurge at the grocery store over the weekend, had everything I needed to kick some blueberry pancake butt. I added a bit of lemon zest, a healthy drop of vanilla, and a dash or two of cinnamon. These were spectacular, and are my new spoil-myself treat when I can't get enough breakfast in one day.

Oh... I forgot to say that I think there were too many blueberries... some of them were like two layers of pancake with all blueberry filling... so keep if you like a LOT and lessen if not. I only used 1 1/2 Cup of berries.

Excellent recipe for light, fluffy pancakes. First one came out of pan rather flavorless, though, so agree that the addition of vanilla and cinnamon helped much. Next time, I'll add lemon zest from the lemon used to make buttermilk (only had whole milk on hand) and consider subbing some of the flour with buckwheat.

Eating them right now. Yum!!!! I made a few modifications, which gives the pancakes a little more taste: 1) 1/2 tsp vanilla extract 2) 1/2 to 1 tsp lemon zest 3) 1/2 tsp of salt (Not 3/4 tsp) 4) 1 T of dark brown sugar in lieu of the 3rd T of regular sugar (Make sugar the brown sugar is not too clumpy) 5) 1/2 cinnamon

I love pancakes. For this recipe I swapped out 1/3 cup of flour for wheat germ. I also didn't have fresh blueberries and just through in frozen wild blueberries into each pancake and in the pot to warm up the maple syrup. Would definitely make this again. Maybe with a dollop of sour cream.

I just made these pancakes and they are AWESOME! I read some of the previous reviews and took their advice. I used half whole wheat flour, substituted brown sugar, and added some vanilla. Also, because I didn't have any buttermilk I mixed Greek yogurt, milk and a little lemon juice. I added a dash of cinnamon towards the end of the batch to see how it tasted and thought it was really good as well! I'd definitely make these again.

I wasn't impressed with this recipe in the least. I thought the pancakes had very little flavor without butter and maple syrup. Based on the reviews, I expected more. Yes they were light and fluffy, but I'll stick to my Spiced Pumpkin Pancake recipe for a more interesting breakfast treat.

Absolutely light and delicious and laden with blueberries. My partner, who normally dislikes blueberry pancakes, said it restored his faith in them. In response to the comment that the pancakes were grossly salty, please check your buttermilk. Many buttermilks contain added salt and would make a recipce far more salty than expected. Make sure you buy buttermilk with no added salt.

These are excellent. We use Saco brand dry buttermilk blend powder, which is easy to always keep on hand. When used according to the directions (5 Tbsp powder + 1 1/4 c. water = 1 1/4 c. buttermilk) the consistency of the batter is perfect. We've made these plain, with frozen mulberries (our local berry), and with chocolate mini-chips, but using only 1 1/2 c. of whatever - 2 c. seems too much. Using butter to cook them rather than oil or oil+butter seems to keep the griddle temperature in the right range - if the butter starts smoking, the griddle is too hot and is going to burn the pancake.

I'm not sure what went wrong here... but the pancakes came out very dense, heavy and bitter! I even attempted the recipe twice.

This is a great pancake recipe. I didn't have any buttermilk, so I straight up used only plain nonfat milk and worried the lack of acid and increased water content might ruin them. But no! They were great. I think so much baking soda makes them exceptionally light.

I make a lot of pancakes and waffles from scratch, and these are excellent. I used 1/3 cup whole wheat pastry flour (rest of the flour unbleached white) and decreased the sugar to 2T. It is best to cook these as soon as possible after mixing the batter. With time, even just a few minutes, the lightness decreases.

These were fast to throw together and tasted great, and I must say that I'm so glad I finally started using my electric griddle that I got for Christmas--so much better than making pancakes in a skillet.

These turned out perfectly. Beautiful fluffy pancakes. The buttermilk makes all the difference. I used frozen wild blueberries, as that's all I had, but I defrosted them by putting them in a sieve and running warm water over them. I let them drain a while (and shook out extra water) and that did not affect the consistency of the batter.

I should have used fresh blueberries (like the recipe says) or dropped frozen ones in after adding the batter to the pan. Instead I added too cups of frozen to the batter which may have thinned it out making them difficult to flip - most fell apart. In spite of this they were still very good. The sweetness is just right for me (not too sweet).

Family loved these (I'm not a berry fan so didn't try them). I followed the recipe exactly except that I substituted black currants for the blueberries (not knowing that they weren't berries - only after looking up the translation in French did I realize that what I thought were blueberries were actually black currants!) Doubled the recipe as well. Found the batter quite liquidy (surprised as other reviewers found it rather thick) so the pancakes were a bit on the thin side but this detracted from them in no way. A keeper!

These were amazing! To the cooks who thought the batter looked too thick: take a chance! I thought the batter looked a bit thicker than the pancake batter my mom used to make at home, but I didn't alter the recipe, and ended up with delicious fluffy pancakes. The problems other cooks had with over or under-cooking the batter are due to temperature regulation. You don't want your pan too hot or not hot enough. Adjust your burner temp if you seem to be getting bad results. I started on a medium-high head just till the pan was hot enough, then switched it down to medium and later medium-low so the pancakes wouldn't get over-browned. Instead of adding blueberries to the batter, I made a blueberry syrup to go on top. I brought a half cup water and one cup sugar to a boil, then added a 1 lb. package of frozen blueberries, brought the heat down and added a tablespoon or so of corn starch to thicken the sauce. It was so yummy served on top of these excellent pancakes. Will definitely use this recipe again!

I love this recipe! I make it for breakfast every time we have people stay the night. The last time I made it, I didn't have buttermilk so I used plain greek yogurt that I had in the fridge. The batter was a bit thicker than normal but worked like a charm and was delish!!

These are amazing. I had never made pancakes before, so I think I made them too big, as I was only able to turn out five, instead of twelve. However, they were a huge hit, despite the fact that they were the size of your face. Also, I used 1 1/3 cups of buttermilk and the batter didn't seem too thick at all.

Don't be daunted by the thickness of the batter. Pour using a 1/2 cup measure, and use the bottom of the cup to spread each pancake into a circle. I found that these did not keep very well for the 10-15 minutes I left them in the oven while the others cooked. Better to use two pans at once on the cooktop so as to avoid reheating.

I just tried this recipe and it was a real challenge. The batter was so think I couldn't even imagine putting it into a pan, so I had to add at least 1 cup more of buttermilk-it was still too thick so when I poured it I tried to flatten as much as I could with the spatula. It ended up taking forever to cook and the inside was too moist while the outside was almost burnt. The family told me to stick with Aunt Jemima and I have to agree. I have made scratch pancakes many years ago and I added 1 Tb vinegar to 1 cup milk and let stand 5 minutes..(Instead of buttermilk) for the recipe. I seem to remember thats how I dealt with the "buttermilk" and they always came out great. I think buttermilk is too thick to use and won't use it again. Very disappointing recipe-

Made these with frozen blueberries, since fresh were outrageously expensive. Also, made the mistake of not sticking to the recipe the first time out, and followed another's suggestion about increasing liquid (1 cup buttermilk, 1 cup regular milk), and batter was WAY too thin. Also, if you're using a nonstick griddle, the butter isn't necessary; just heat to medium high and that's when you'll get that lovely even golden brown that you get on restaurant pancakes. Despite having to thicken the batter considerably, my spouse and I enjoyed these with a side of bacon and lots of maple syrup. I'll be making these again...............this weekend. And that's high praise, coming from someone who's not a pancake fan. ;-)
