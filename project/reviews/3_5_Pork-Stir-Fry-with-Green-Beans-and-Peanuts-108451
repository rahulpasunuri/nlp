This gets a 4 forks for being SUPER EASY, SUPER QUICK and really flexible. When we don't know what we want for dinner, I thaw some pork and throw all our extra veggies into the pan with these sauce ingredients. It NEVER disappoints.

Very good recipe. Doubled sauce and used cornstarch as suggested. Next time I'm thinking just different coloured peppers would be good. Was borderline for too spicy, but great taste.

Great recipe! I doubled both sauces, one for pork marinate and other to add at the end. Would recommend serving this over rice or noodle to make a little hearty for 4 boys. My picky boys loved the flavor. Definite keeper.

Apparently this recipe induces swearing, as my bf also said, "This is f-ing awesome!" I pretty much used the recipe from the reviews: I doubled the sauce and changed the cooking order of the ingredients. I stir-fried the pork, then the veggies, then took everything out and threw in 2 T of ginger and 4 cloves of garlic and put everything back in, with the sauce mixture (soy sauce, some cornstarch, a bit of honey, and some chili oil and rice wine vinegar, for kicks) and heated it. I would make this modified version again.

100% KEEPER! Yum, so much flavor! Based on previous reviews, I used more soy, garlic, ginger, chili pepper.. Didn't measure exactly, so I think we wound up a tad on the salty side, but still terrific. Used one tenderloin, next time might trim it back a bit. Also found 'shredded' carrots in my store which seemed matchsticky enough for me. Beats the heck out of matchsticking carrots for this mandoline-less girl. DEELISH!

Used chicken breasts instead of pork. It came out great for a weekday dinner.

I thought that this recipe was very good for a healthy recipe. My boyfriend usually does not like asian-style dishes, but he described this dish as 'f---ing good.' Per other people's suggetsion, I tripled the amount of soy sauce, and garlic. I also used more honey and red pepper flakes. I can see how without these changes, some may find the recipe bland. As it was, I felt like it was still missing a tiny something. Maybe it could have benefited from a drop of fish sauce or something. It's true that while some have called this a 'weeknight' dish, it does require a good bit of prep. If I make this again, I might try not boiling the veggies beforehand--it added another tedious step to an already rather laborious process. Overall, this is a good recipe.

Made recipe as written except for the last 1/2 T. honey. Even so, the recipe was overwhelmingly sweet and lacked depth, although the collection of vegetables and peanuts with the pork was good. It is the basic salt and sugar sauce that is the problem. We have an extensive collection of Asian recipes, and this one does not make the cut.

Not bad. Quick and pretty healthy too. Realized I didn't have ginger (fresh or ground) and used a few sprinkles of my Essence of Emeril "Asian" mix instead. Thought it might be lacking, but we didn't miss it.

My husband and I loved this...he asked me to try it with shrimp in the future (which he said would make it a four fork meal!). Did double the sauce...and not paying attention while cooking mixed all of the sauce ingredients together...split up the results between the marinating bowl and the later addition and it worked out just fine. I swapped mushrooms for the carrots as suggested. Served over rice. Most delicious...competes ably with our local chinese place. Now must buy some chopsticks...

This was a terrific and easy workday meal. I substituted snap peas for carrots and because I had run out of honey, used maple syrup. I was worried about this latter substitution, but it turned out great! My family had thirds!

I thought this was good but alittle bland and my husband agreed. Reviewed the recipe and realized I had forgotten the other 3T of soy sauce along with the 1/2 t of honey. Will try it again making it properly. I knew it had good potential!!

This is one of my favorite stir fry recipes. I vary the veggies according to what I have - today it was carrots, red pepper, snap peas and spinach -just use about 3-4 cups. It always looks good and the taste is very appealing.

Wow, this was a very tasty dish! I made changes and it still was fabulous. I used Jimmy Dean hot pork sausage, put it in Ziploc baggie with the other marinade ingredients, and mashed it around. Stir-fried long Chinese green beans for 3 minutes, then added pork mixture and stir-fried it till the meat crumbled, then added the rest of the ingredients. No need to pre-cook the beans if you use the Chinese kind. I also made extra sauce using the marinade ingredients, adding chicken stock to cut the flavor of the soy sauce. LOTS of fresh grated ginger in the sauce was an essential ingredient.

Rating: 4
Especially delicious with a doubling of the ginger and garlic. I use about a 1 pound tenderloin and increase soy and honey by 50%. carrots I neglect. nice color add but not much flavor in my skillet. peanuts are a great crunchy counterpoint and dry roasted salted give it a good extra salt kick. a little time consuming but worth the trouble monthly.

Rating: 4
excellent recipe! i grow green beans in my garden every summer and this recipe has been wonderful! the only thing that i do differently is that i use honey roasted peanuts. when i first made the recipe i didn't have "regular" peanuts, only my husband's honey roasted. it was so good with the honey roasted nuts that i've always make it including them. i also use my home-grown tomatoes.

Rating: 4
Nice, easy and nearly impossible to mess up. I increased the marinade, as suggested by others. Everyone loved it, and I'm making it again tonight. I used haricot verts, so didn't parboil as long. If you like spicy, you might increase the red pepper flakes. It's pretty subtle as written.

Really nice stir fry, I left out carrots and doubled the sauce! Super yummy.

Rating: 4
Didn't have peanuts, so used cashews; also substituted venison for the pork, so I marinated it for a couple of days, and cooked the meat first. Then just added all the veggies to the wok, add'l sauce, and voila. I thought the carrots were important. Served it over brown rice--delicious and attractive.

Rating: 4
A hit -delicious, easy, healthy. The ginger makes it taste so fresh. If you prefer "sauce", triple the marinade as other helpful reviewers have suggested. This was a last-minute meal, so I substituted Karo syrup for honey.

My husband loved this. And, he doesn't even like stir fry. The cracked pepper, ginger, and peanuts really made the dish. Very, very tasty! Followed the recipe exactly. No need to change unless you like more spice.

I made this for the second time this month. Some changes I made the second time around were: 1) ommitted the carrots - they weren't worth the effort of cutting up; 2) skipped blanching the green beans. Instead I threw them in along with the bell pepper and sauteed everything for a litle longer, even throwing some water into the pan to steam them a little; 3) added yellow bell pepper as well to give it some more color and flavor; 4) added corn startch to the sauce at the end to make it a little thicker. It's such a great recipe, and you can easily substitute the pork with chicken or beef or tofu. Will make a third time very soon!

I loved this dish as did all my guests. I used french beans (easy to get here!) and cut carrots up into fine Julienne so I didn't boil veggies first. Used my wok (for the first time in ages) and stir-fried to everyone's delight.

I made this recipe exactly as written (but used peanut instead of canola oil) and it was very good and I will definitely make it again. Those who were concerned with the dish lacking flavor were probably expecting a thicker sacue; this sauce was more watery than thick. Next time I will leave out the carrots - they're more work than they're worth. I will also add a little corn startch to the soy sauce and honey mixture (the one that you add to the stir fry the second time around) to thicken it up a bit.Also, be sure not to cook the pork over a minute (as recipe states). If you're concerned it won't be cooked enough, know that it cooks a little more in it's own heat after you remove it from the stovetop. Overall, a keeper!

This is the first stir-fry I've made and it came out great. Tripled the sauce, added a teaspoon of cornstarch, and substituted chicken breast and snowpeas, Also skipped boiling the veggies, just stir-fried them for a few minutes with lots of garlic and ginger (we like them crisp). Overall, great flavor and pretty easy...only wish I had a dishwasher for all those little prep bowls!

Made this last night, and it was delicious! My husband absolutely raved over the veggies, and pork was very tender and tasty. I found the veggie chopping a little tedious, but we were in no hurry so that was fine. I doubled the sauce and would probably increase it again. I doubled the ginger, which I love, and next time will also double the hot pepper flakes or chop some jalapeno into the red pepper slices. It's a keeper! We're looking forward to enjoying the leftovers this evening. I made it with a blackened onion rice pilaf since I had no jasmine rice on hand, and the flavors were awesome together.

Crazy over the flavor! Cornstarch! Why mess with perfection. Even my friends requested I pass along the recipe. I used beef instead, and actually cooked it first until tender(I have a thing about eating 5min meat), then followed the recipe. FANTASTIC!

Rating: 3
I added a little chili bean sauce to the recipe just to give it a little more zing! Husband loved it. And yes, I also used a little cornstarch in the sauce. Thickens it slightly and makes it shiny and pretty. Almost all Chinese recipes call for a little cornstarch, either in the meat marinade or in the sauce.

I used a mixture of sesame and canola oils, and it really added some extra zip to the dish. I also marinated the pork for a few hours in the fridge, which made it even more tender and tasty. Do double the sauce!

I thought this was very good and easy to prepare (I did various chopping throughout the day). I think however that just about EVERYTHING needs to be doubled. Even my kids (7 & 5) ate it all. I tripled the sauce mixture (mixed with cornstarch to thicken) and that still wasn't enough, next time I'll triple it. I also used pure maple syrup in lieu of the honey since I didn't have any on hand and we're currently in the middle of a large snowstorm. I put the pork in the marinade first thing in the morning and it sat (in the fridge) all day. It was delicious. I'd definitely tell people to try this one.

Very good. I also used mushrooms as suggested.

Rating: 3
Very flavorful and I only marinated the pork for about 30 minutes before cooking. I added fresh mushrooms as someone suggested and it was great but they needed to saute by themselves a little longer. I used a lot more garlic in place of the fresh ginger I thought I had in the fridge and substituted in pickled ginger---as said, it was very flavorful and delicious

You can buy bags of shredded carrots (like for cole slaw)...probably wouldn't need to parboil them, though, since they are probably a little thinner than "matchstick".

YUM! My husband went nuts for this recipe. We love pork because it's a fairly lean and quick-cooking meat, and this is a very inventive and delicious way to incorporate it into a recipe (you can only eat so many pork chops!!) I would definitely make this dish again -- perfect for a weeknight meal.

I love this dish. I've been making it at least once a week. I usually add more fresh sliced red peppers and, to give myself a break, I buy thick shredded carrots (god bless Trader Joe's!) I usually add a little more soy sauce at the end and last time I added Hoisen sauce. It rocked!!!

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but I'm planning to---just wanted to respond to Ellen regarding the "match-stick" carrots. If you have a mandolin, it may have a blade that will do it for you in a snap...I think they're also worth the investment for using to slice carrots, cucumbers, onions, etc., to the thickness you prefer.

Rating: 3
Very good. I used leftover pork tenderloin. I had it marinating, and then realized that I had forgotten to buy ginger. Consequently, the meat marinated for 24 hours, which made it extra tasty. Next time I make it, I will omit parboiling the vegetables. I think it would be easier, and probably tastier, to stir-fry them, with just a dash of water added to facilitate cooking. Does anyone have suggestions for cutting "matchstick-size" carrots? A bit time-consuming!
