This was a perfect end to our Mexican dinner and the crisps are sooo good and make the dessert. The sauce was really good as well...but I think next time I would add a little more cinnamon and some spice to it to get a little more Mexican zing

I made this for Cinco de Mayo. Got raves.

I gave this recipe 4 forks not because it is outstanding, but because it hit just the right note for the end of the meal. It was cool to the palate (after some spicey food) and while the presentation was a bit fancy, it was not too fussy to be eaten outside at the base of a fire. The tortilla chips added just the right pizazz.

This was OK...I wanted to taste more coffee and cinnamon. Without coffee ice cream, there was little coffee flavor at all. I added some cayenne pepper, about 1/4 t, which was wonderful the next day. I will try this again,with adjustments. Don't skip the crisps, they're easy and delish!

This dish was so incredibly easy to prepare and the presentation was beautiful. My dinner guests were blown away! And I've had the pleasure of enjoying the leftover chocolate sauce (it makes A LOT!) in the days following.

Made only the sauce, for a homemade touch to vanilla ice cream being served after a Mexican dinner. Used only 1 tsp. espresso powder, and it was perfect.

This is my favorite treat; it's my special request each birthday dinner. The sauce is incredible on other things, too -- allow yourself to get creative!(...even in coffee the morning after the celebration -- yum!)

Quick, easy and delicious! My guests loved it, especially the tortilla crisps which I have made by themselves when craving a little treat.

This was a great dessert for our Mexican dinner. It was easy, quick, and delicious...everyone was impressed; especially with the tortilla crisps.

Very simple but elegant and delicious! I used half dulce de leche ice-cream since it is a classic Mexican flavor as well. And there was a lot of sauce left - I sent it home with one of my guests. And for the tortilla crisps - the easiest way to make them is to spread butter over the entire tortilla then sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar.

Served as a last course to a Mexican dinner party. The presentation had people in awe. Very easy to make. I served with whipped cream. Used margarita glasses instead of martini to go with the Mexican theme.

This recipe was a big hit and a great way to finish off my Mexican-themed dinner party! It does make LOTS of sauce, though, so I would recommend halving the recipe if you don't want to blow your diet for the week after! I scooped the ice cream into martini glasses, drizzled the sauce over and garnished with the tortilla cookies - great presentation. The cookies weren't quite sweet enough for my very sweet-tooth, though. Maybe next time I'll cover both side in the butter-sugar-cinnamon mixture?

I made this as the finale for a Mexican Dinner. For something of such ease, people seemed to really enjoy it. The cinnamon in the sauce really stands out and the chips make it fun. This proves that things don't have to be elaborate to be delicious.

This was extremely good! I will make this again real soon!

Really great. I especially like the tortilla crisps; it's so easy to make and they go very well with the chocolate sauce and (home made)coffee ice cream. Next time I'll make 'chocolate crisps': just use cocoa powder instead of cinnamon! I also put some vanilla sugar over the crisps before baking.
