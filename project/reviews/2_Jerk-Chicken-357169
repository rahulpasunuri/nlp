there is no way that 10 minutes of marinating is sufficient. Every other jerk chicken recipe calls for hours, up to a day, of marination.

THIS SUCKS BAD! I took a risk in making it with only two reviews-- one good and one bad. Not only does this taste rather bland, it's very unappealing visually. There ate many jerk chicken recipes so look for a different one unless you like gross looking bland food.

This is incredibly easy to make and delicious. I used a habanero chile in place of the scotch bonnet and ended up marinading the chicken for more like an hour, but otherwise followed the recipe. Served with baked sweet potatoes and collards. This will become a staple in my kitchen for sure.
