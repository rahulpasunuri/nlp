We did not like these. They were way too sweet even though I used less sugar. I added cinnamon as suggested-it did not help enough. There was too much crust and too llittle fruit and the essence of the summer fruit just did not come through. A berry crisp with its way larger proportion of fruit to crust is way more delicious. On a positive note, the recipe 'worked' just fine and I was able to cut attractive(larger) squares. Also, if you like this recipe there is no need to use 2T extra butter-1 stick is fine.

Easy and delicious. I made them even more nutritious by using whole-wheat flour and cooking spray rather than the extra 2 Tablespoons of butter. Maybe I'm greedy, but cutting the pan into 16 bars gave nice, reasonable size pieces(rather than the miniscule 36 bars called for). The recipe is messy--definitely use foil in the pan.

I have made these bars since the recipe was first published. I make them every year for extended family. I used to make half blueberry and half rasberry and the clear preference of the family is for the rasberry--everyone loves them. Even the very young kids--

I thought these were good, but not good enough to make again (there are too many other things that are better!). Everyone liked them and liked the surprise of the orange zest. My filling was a bit too runny to arrange so that it stayed within 1/2" of the sides--it just ran to the edges. I don't think it affected the taste, and I have a feeling the author knew this would be messy (hence, the foil lining!).

I made this recipe using frozen blueberries, and I strained them before preceding, and they hold together with no problem at all. Also I quadrupled the recipe, baking it in 2 13 x 9 inch pans, sprayed the pans first with a no stick spray, and got lovely reviews. No one asked if it was from canned filling.

I've made these many times and everybody loves them. When I use raspberries or blackberries, I strain the cooked berries before adding them to the base. The extra step makes them much better. I always cook my filling a little longer than the recipe says, and then leave them at room temp for a few hours before trying to cut them into squares.

I made these with all blueberries and found them Ok, but sweeter than I would have liked and lacking the intense blueberry flavor I was hoping for. I would try lemon juice and zest next time instead of the orange, or try rasberries. The crust and topping are nice. I found chilling them first allowed for neater cutting without the filling oozing out.

I love these berry squares, and to the earlier reviewers, no, it doesn't taste like canned pie filling (although I don't know, since I've never used canned pie filling), but I do find it a bit too sweet. Next time I think I'll use a tiny bit less brown sugar in the oatmeal batter and and maybe add lemon zest to give it a bit more of a sweet-tart balance.

Personally, I loved these bars. They taste like a piece of blueberry pie! The taste was yummy! I sliced the whole dish and then carefully removed them with an offset spatula. They are tricky to transport. They tend to fall apart. To my disappointment, some of my guests thought I used canned blueberry pie filling. You couldn't really tell the difference. They were super easy to make. I will make them again because I enjoyed them!

THIS RECIPE WAS PRETTY GOOD. THE SWEETNESS WAS JUST RIGHT (DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU LIKE). BUT IT WAS VERY MESSY TO CUT, THE FRUIT OOZES OUT. SO I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND CUTTING IT BEFORE YOU TAKE IT SOMEWHERE. ALSO THE RECIPE ASKS FOR 9 INCH BUT 8 INCH ALSO WORKS.

I made these for friends at a cookout, and we each had 2, even though we were stuffed. They look homemade, not like store-bought, which automatically impresses people these days. . . . I used just blueberries, and would like to try raspberries next time. They are dense and chewy, a substantial dessert.

I can't understand what all the fuss is about. My berries look and taste like canned pie filling (don't get me wrong, I like pie filling well enough, but for this I didn't have to go out and spend money on fresh blueberries)and the bars are awfully sweet. Also, I don't understand what one reviewer said about the bars travelling well. I haven't even tried packing mine away yet, but they sure look like they're going to stick to each other and to everything else. In short, they taste fine, but I don't see myself trying them again.

Loved it! A delicious, simple dessert. MUST be served warm with vanilla ice cream!

I made these for a trip to the beach. They travel well and a great way to use up extra berries. The cookie base is rich and buttery! Yum! I skipped the orange zest and used bottled OJ and all blueberries. Next time I might try a spash of almond extract to replace the orange zest.

This was incredibly easy and works well for a warm weather snack. However, I found it a little sweet for my taste, and didn't think the orange added much. Next time, I will reduce the sugar and/or add lemon. Will also add cinnamon to the base.

These are great! My husband and I took them on a picnic, and they hit the spot. They were super easy, too!

These bars are awesome! I used 2 cups raspberries with 1 cup bluberries as another cook suggested and it was delicious. I thought the orange zest/juice was an excellent addition to the bars and wouldn't skip it!

These didn't work out that well for me. I followed the recipe exactly, and they seemed to work fine, but I just didn't like the end result as much as I thought I would. I didn't expect them to be as "rustic" as they turned out. My topping tasted like just a super-thick layer of jam. However, they do smell wonderful baking, and they are better after a couple of days in the fridge. Do try them - they are easy, and it seems most everyone else had great success.

I made these for my husband and father for a camping trip and they went hog wild for them. My husband asked me to make them again the following week! I used lower fat margerine and only used 7 T of margerine and it turned out great!

Just when I was longing to make the amazing berry squares at our cottage bakery, I found this recipe! I've made it so many times and everyone loves it. Works equally well with fresh or frozen berries - 2 cups raspberries and 1 cup blueberries is our favourite combo. I skip the orange zest.

I used blackberries and they were quite popular at the party I took them to. My husband said he'd never tasted ANYTHING in his life as good as these!

This is a very delicious recipe using other fruit as well! Good texture and sweetness which compliments the tartness of the fruit. I made this dessert 5 times already this summer!

I was really disappointed with this dessert, especially after I had read the other online reviews that raved about it. The crust was good, but the berry filling was just not very tasty... I think it may have been the orange zest and juice or something, but the filling just tasted very unpleasantly odd.

I served these at a family gathering with vanilla ice cream - a great combo and pretty presentation! The only thing I'll change is not using thick-cut oats (which I had on-hand because we make home-made granola). I think regular oats would have made for a cruchier (rather than chewier) texture.

Just delishhh, my daughter said...mom this is my favorite dessert forever. I made it with all blueberries and left out the orange. It was very simple to make and vanished in 24 hours.
