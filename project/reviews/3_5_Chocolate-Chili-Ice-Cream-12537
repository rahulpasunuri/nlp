I made this last night for the finish to a Mexican dinner a friend was making. I used very good French dark chocolate, along with some Ghiradelli bittersweet. I used 1/2 and 1/2 and 2% milk, as that's all I had. I cut the kahlua back to 1.5 tsp, used a heaping 1/4 tsp of powdered chipotle, and skimped on the cinnamon, probably 1.5 tsp. It was delicious and not to heavy on the palate. The texture was a little crumbly; maybe due to the lower fat dairy. But, leaving it at room temp for a while rendered it creamy as it softened. the flavor was excellent,the heat subtle and warming. Might leave out the almonds next time, or grind them in the food processor. I didn't like having bits of almond in the finished product. Also, in retrospect, I think grating the chocolate added at the end, on a microplane, would save time and afford the ice cream a nice texture. Will make it again!

This was fantastic. I didn't have pequins on hand, so I used a jalapeno, cut into 1/2 inch strips which I boiled in the milk and custard and strained out. I also added a 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper to the mixing process. Big hit at my dinner party. Can't say enough. The spicy just crept up on you, not overwhelming.

I tried a chocolate jalepeno ice cream in France that was amazing-deep chocolate flavor and then BANG! a pop from the chilis. AWESOME!!! A note to someone who thought chipotles would be a good substitute for pequins-they wouldn't- pequins are much hotter and chipoltes are smoked... might be a good flavor combination anyway....

I actually got pequin chilis from Penzey's for this recipe and it ended up being too spicy. It was fun to try, but not the kind of ice cream I would want to have often. It was good, but not great. I think it would have been great without the chilis!

Will definitely try this! Can't get enough of the spicy or the chocolate, so this is perfect! Piquin Chilis are available from Penzy's Spices...www.penzeys.com

I don't know about this recipe, but I do know you can get pequin chiles from Dean & Deluca. I think, just based on the smell, chipotles would be a good substitute.

I'm a So Cal native and I've never heard of "pequin chilies". My local gourmet grocer didn't have them either. I substituted Spice Hunter chipotle chile flakes. This recipe needs a little heat to balance the dense, rich chocolate, but alas, the chipotle flakes got lost in the dense, rich chocolate flavor. It's still a terrific ice cream, got rave reviews, but I wanted that pinch of heat. Next time I'll double the chipotles. I recommend cutting the cinnamon in half - it creates a powdery aftertaste at the recipe strength of 2 tsp. Used half & half in place of heavy cream, added 1 cup 2% milk, came out great.

This was a big hit. I upped the sugar a tiny bit, got some 'warm' chili flakes and soaked them in Kahlua before adding. Also, I added 1 tsp. of cayenne powder, a few dashes of Asian red chili oil and cumin - to taste. Believe it or not you can 'to taste' something like this. It took a long time to freeze, but was well worth it! Just make sure whatever chili you use is a 'sharp' rather than 'sour' or 'bitter' tasting one.

In Adelaide (australia) pequin chili are not available - can we use plain chili flakes from the asian grocer instead? Please send me an answer. Thankyou
