I used a similar recipe as a base to make a kosher adaptation of the traditional clam chowder. It was the first time I had one, even "fake". I also made bread bowls and THAT made the difference ! http://www.196flavors.com/2012/11/20/usa-kosher-clam-chowder/

This recipe is not a complete recipe because it puts a lot of the final touches in the hands of the cook. That is not necessarily bad. To bring this recipe to completion, you need to know how you want it to taste. I followed some advice here adding fennel (excellent touch) and two cloves garlic for stronger flavor. I also decided to simmer the broth with the half & half adding more flour to thicken the chowder up a bit. The thickness is also a personal taste. My chowder was silky not too heavy, not too thin. IMHO, clam chowder can be bland unless you live near the coast and use very fresh clams. I always add lots of black pepper and tabasco to restaurant chowder. The art is how you finish the chowder with the sherry (always good with seafood chowders and bisques), tabasco, worcestershire, salt and pepper.

We used canned minced & whole belly clams. We rinsed the salt & chemical water off the clams. We cooked the bacon first, then chopped it up. Added half a fennel bulb, minced garlic, celery and cream sherry to taste. Cooked the potato in clam juice, then added the clams cooked in the cream and sherry. Used chicken broth to thin as required. Excellent.

We have made several clam chowder recipes over the years and this is absolutely the best. Rich, creamy, a flavor unlike any other. It is the only recipe I want to use now.

I made as directed, except substituted celery for some of the onion. I think that was a nice addition. Great flavors! It might have been a little thin but I think it's better thin than gummy. Fresh clams would rock in this. The people we made this for said it was "a symphony in a bowl"!

Well, obviously clam chowder made from fresh clams is the best, but this one is pretty good also. I keep the ingredients on hand and make this often as a pantry staple as I always have bacon in my freezer and an herb garden just out the back door with fresh thyme and bay. I find the quality of the canned clams and juice makes a huge difference, I use the Bar Harbor brand I find at Whole Foods. I don't thicken it further as some do, I don't like overly thick chowders.

All I can say is that any clam chowder recipe that starts with canned minced clams is not a chowder I want to make! Not worth it!

Rating: 1
The good news is, there is not much left over. I followed this recipe to the T, and is still tasted strange. For starters, I added a little more bacon. Also I added a bit more onion. The soup as too soupy, so I added more flour (that is what you do to thicken soup) then, when we were done, my family did not like it one bit. I do not know what I did wrong, but I am not going to make this ever again. I'm sorry, I wish it was good, but it just wasn't :(

I love this clam chowder. Yummm. I have made it multiple times; today was the best. I found that thickening the broth for about twentyfive minutes does the trick. I used 4T sherry, 1T worchestershire, and 5 shakes of Franks. I used heavy cream. 3 cans of chopped clams and one large can of steamer clams. This provided exactly 2 cups of clam broth. Excellent recipe!

Excellent creamy New England chowder. I added chopped celery to the base chowder and celery leaves into the cream and clam mixture while it came to temperature (discarding them before adding to the main chowder). I think celery is a key flavor component to this classic. I omitted the sherry because I didn't have any...didn't miss it.

This was delicious. My girlfriend is a pescaterian so I omitted the bacon (can't wait to try it with bacon), used a little more thyme, and only half the sherry. When I make it next time I will use slightly less sherry.

You know it's gonna be good when the recipe is from the CIA...so easy and delicious. There are always leftovers since it makes 2 quarts, and is even better the next day. When my 14 y/o daughter asks for "her" clam chowder, I know it's a keeper! Thank you!

it's ok, not enough bacon, and seasonings, such as thyme. I used fresh clam and their juices, maybe that's why it taste a bit bland?

Rating: 2
I have to say that I agree with the minority of reviewers here, and that this recipe was just OK. I made it as directed, halving the recipe though. Thought this was very bland, and added fire roasted red pepper, capers and garlic, added basil instead of thyme, extra sherry, and STILL, it only scored an OK/pretty good. Bummer. Oh, I used baby clams instead of minced, but they mostly deteriorated during the extended simmer time anyway. There must be better recipes out there, I love clams!

I can't believe how good this recipe is. I some minor modifications by using salt pork instead of bacon, frozen clams rather than canned, adding 2 stalks of celery and a few cloves of garlic, omitting the tabasco and worcestershire sauce, and reducing the sherry by about half.

Absolutely fantastic recipe. While it does take some effort to prep all of the ingredients and time to let everything muddle together, it is well worth it and surprisingly easy to prepare. This is one of my "go to" recipes when I want to impress others and showcase my cooking abilities.

This may be the best clam chowder I've ever made, and I've made quite a a few. To make this a bit lighter, I subbed evaporated milk and coconut milk for the cream (about 1 1/2 C each). I think the coconut milk added a really nice element. Did not peel the potatoes, added several cloves of minced garlic and left out the sherry (forgot it, but we didn't miss it) Used a Penzey's blend called Parisienne Bonne Herbs instead of thyme. I've noticed that sometimes when a recipe does not include salt specifically in the recipe - having the cook salt to taste instead - several reviewers comment that it's bland. I think that might be the case here. This was absolutely delicious - not bland at all. Make sure to use enough salt. :)

I made alot of modifications cause I had leftover seafood from the night before....I used the leftover seafood as a base...so that was wine, broth with garlic, crushed chilipeppers and basil mussels clams and scallops....otherwise followed the recipe as shown. I imagine it would be bland as written....mine was great!

I have made this a few times - but have found that it was a bit bland. I leave out most of the sherry (cut it back by 2/3) double the fresh thyme and add smoked salmon. It's quite good with these modifications.

The key to this soup is the clam juice. After trying several brands, the best of the lot is Reese's bottled clam juice (8oz/bottle) found in tuna fish aisle, etc. Not every store in my area carries it, but the difference it makes is amazing! I think this is why another reviewer said it was flavorless. I used a combo of fresh commercially shucked clams and canned. It was a little loose at first so I added a butter/flour roux to thicken and viola it was great. After one serving, I added some frozen corn to the rest of the pot and made corn clam chowder.

I'm from the Great Pacific North West, where clam chowder is a big deal and this is the best recipe out there, IMHO. I do it as written with just a few modifications. First, I use frozen clams instead of canned and lots of 'em. The potatoes have to be Yukon golds and I use potato soup mix for thickening as needed instead of the flour. This chowder is a guaranteed hit.

I chose this recipe because of 4 stars & I trusted the Culinary Institutes creativity. I made it as directed, except I used 3 cans of clams. I did use the 3 cups of broth as directed, as well as all the other ingredients. I had high hopes, but again, NO CLAM FLAVOR. This tasted kind of like "cream of nothing soup"......I'm shocked so many people raved about a soup that had so little taste. I added more hot sauce, and 2 tablespoons of tomato paste @ the end to try and help it out. To be honest, if I didn't tell my husband it was clam chowder, I don't think he would have known. My quest for the ultimate clam chowder goes on!

I didn't know how to do three-and-a-half forks or that's what i would have given it. We had some leftover cod with a light sauce and I added that omitting the sherry, using skim milk and some half-and-half. It was plenty rich and thick, though not thick the way it might have been if I'd made a thicker roux or mashed the potatoes against the side of the pan. Long way to say, very, very yummy. And yes, I did stand alone in the kitchen cleaning up, eating a little extra soupcon!

Oh. My. God. Easily one of the best soups I have ever made, and an easy recipe too! Dressed it up with plenty of Tabasco and Worchestershire - thought the sherry amount was perfect. A complex, creamy, decadent treat, exactly what I've been craving. Took about 1.5 hours to make. Well worth it!!

Best New England Clam Chowder I've ever had. Period. (And I grew up in NY). I used Cholula for the hot sauce instead of Tabasco.

This recipe calls for way too much sherry. Use 3 or 4 tablespoons at most. I also thought the heavy cream made it way too thick, so next time I'll do 11/2 cups whole milk and 11/2 cups half&half. Other that that it was pretty good.

I love this recipe. We have made this a couple of times now and it is consistently really good and easy. This last time I actually slightly burned the bacon but cont. through the recipe and it didn't make a difference. I also removed about half the potatoes when they were completely cooked (about 25 minutes) and blended the rest with an immersion blender. I added the cubed potatoes back and the results were perfect.

This recipe makes a great chowder. I thought I would try using fresh clams, steam them, then add them to the mix. This turned out to be an expensive venture. Determining clam weight by pound with shells also provided difficult. If you want to make this soup, use canned clams. You won't be able to tell any difference.

I used 3 cans of clams, which gave me 1lb of clams and 2 cups of juice. I added another cup of chicken stock. I did not use the bacon, so added 1.5tbls olive oil and 1.5tblsp unsalted butter to onion (1 large red) and I added 1 stalk of chopped celery. When I added the flour, it was quite thick and gloopy so I wasn't sure how it would turn out. I used 1 bay leaf and 1/2 tsp fresh thyme. I added 3.5cups of diced potatoes (2 large yukon golds) which took about 25 minutes to get tender. When potatoes were tender, I pureed the soup base then added the clams and milk. I used 1 cup of cream and 2 cups of 1% milk. The pureed potatoes made it nice and creamy I would try all milk next time to reduce fat. I added about 1.5 tsp sea salt and 1/4 tsp fresh cracked pepper. I didn't add any other seasonings as my kids don't like spicy, although I think the sherry and tobasco would be exceptional. The soup is delicious even in its mild form - creamy, rich, salty and just amazing. This will become a new regular in our rotation with a nice loaf of bread and a salad.

I had some heavy cream to use up (leftover from some truffles I made for friends - not typically a staple in my fridge) so I picked up some clams & clam juice to try this recipe today. Unfortunately I didn't pick up dry sherry, tabasco or worcestershire sauce! No worries - I read some substitutions online and used some fresh lemon juice to bring out the flavor (instead of the worcestershire). I also axed the bacon (prefer it without). I didn't do the onion-roux. The potatoes were starchy enough to make to give it a great consistency if you don't want it super thick. The bay leaf, fresh thyme, salt (I used himalayan pink sea salt), fresh ground pepper (I used white pepper) and fresh squeeze lemon I added gave it the delicate flavor it needs. The thyme is what I never realized gives it that flavor! Making New England clam "chowda" has always intimidated me but it was easy. I made it and ate it during my lunch hour working from home.

I know it's not genuine but it sure was gerat! My whole family liked it and I think I will double it next time. Based on the reviews and the fact that I don;t have any sherry at the moment, I left it out, but the taste was still great and the consistancy was very creamy.

Oh, my! This soup was so delicious! We ate the whole thing in one sitting. A bit much but we couldn't help it! I used 3 slices of turkey bacon and added 1 tablespoon of butter when I added the onions. I used 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme, about 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce, and 10 drops of hot sauce. I used 1 cup heavy whipping cream, about 1 cup regular half and half, and about 1 cup fat free half and half (I was using up things in the frig.) Before I added the cream and clams mixture, I used my emersion blender to puree the potato mixture. One of my kids doesn't like potatoes, and this fools her into eating.

This chowder was a terrific hit- gone in thirty minutes by 6 hungry souls from my wife's book group. I tripled the amount of clams and used fresh mahogany clams from Whole Foods- four bags-I used the broth from the fresh clams for the clam juice. I did not add any sherry but used a spot of Melinda's Habenero Sauce which I find less intrusive than other sauces like tabasco-- yummm!! Thank you CIA!!

Rating: 2
I would strongly suggest eliminating the sherry. I used only 1 T and it tastes way out of place for NE chowder. Sherry is great in seafood sauces but it's best left out here. I was hoping for more clam flavor as well. I used 4 cans plus 1 8oz bottle of juice. Also no need to cook the clams separately. They are already cooked as part of the canning process. A short simmer of the chower at the end is adequate.

What a perfect dinner we shared to herald in the New Year! Epicurious and the CIA have done it again! This recipe was excellent. I enjoyed watching the prep videos... just a little more encouragement which was a plus. My husband and I like spicy food and usually would have added Tabasco to our chowder or soup before eating it. The video showed Chef adding a good bit of both Worcestershire and Tabasco. I added 40 shakes of Tabasco and about 1 1/2 TBS of Worcestershire. My husband is an international airline pilot and loves New England Clam Chowder. His vote... this was by far and large the most delicious chowder he'd ever eaten, with the perfect balance of richness and robust flavor. I served it with a fresh baguette, green salad and Napa's Merryvale 2006 Sauvignon Blanc. My New Year is off to an amazing Epicurious start.

It's winter, it's snowing... what could be better than clam chowder on a day like this? This chowder was everything I hoped it would be and more! I've never made clam chowder before so I didn't expect much but this really was amazing. My husband and I don't eat meat so I omitted the bacon and sauteed some leeks in nonsalted butter instead. This was delicious. Also, my husband doesn't do alcohol so I looked up some substitutes for sherry. I saw that some chefs recommended apple cider. I tried it in a portion of the soup and it made for a very interesting and delicious twist on clam chowder but I didn't use either sherry or or the apple cider in the end. Finally, instead of tobasco sauce I prefer to use fresh black pepper. Don't hesitate to give this a try! It's simple, delicious and so satisfying.

I made this for Christmas Eve and it was superb. I only put in 2 Tbsps of Sherry, any more and it would have been overpowering. My grocer had chopped fresh clams in the seafood deli and I added more than the recipe called for. This will be my "go to" clam chowder recipe in the future.

this soup was delicious! I made it for a book club dinner, and everyone raved and had seconds... in fact, one of the women had vacationed on Cape Cod over the summer, and claimed that this was better, hands down, than any she'd had there! I made with 1/2 whipping cream, 1/2 half-and-half, and a little extra clam juice. Also added a generous amount of Worcester and tabasco (since the recipe states "to taste"). Finally, served it w/ homemade croutons (found it on Epicurious -- it was with the ceasar salad w/ tapenade croutons -- I just didn't use the tapenade). Anyway, highly recommend!

I made this precisely as advised using the cream. It tastes good but it needs a little more. It's clam rich which isn't a bad thing, just a bit overpowering for the soup as a whole. Next time I'll use a bit less clam and double the onion and bacon as well as use half and half in place of the cream. For the leftovers in the fridge, I'm going to steam up some corn and add that to the soup with a cup of milk, see if I can put a smile on its face.

I think the taste is delicious but it seems a bit too thin. I have made it today and will be serving it tomorrow coz I always think soup tastes better the next day.

Yikes! If you really want traditional New England clam chowder, look up Jasper White's recipee from "Summer Shack" cookbook. Also, real chowder is made with salt pork. I can't image skipping that step. We New Englanders mash some of the potatoes on the side of the pot to make it thicker. If you can get your own clams and steam them open---the liquid you steam them in becomes your broth! It's really pretty simple.

It can't be! This recipe calls for 'canned clams', no REAL clams? Next it'll be powdered milk and canned broth. No thanks. Take it from a 50 year New Englander, this is far from the real 'thing'. Also, how many does it serve?

I LOVE sherry and I believe 6T would be a bit much so I reduced to 3T and thought it was a pretty good rendition...though not what some in my family have experienced for decades as New Englanders. Added one small can creamed corn..maybe that was the problem? Subbed pancetta for bacon. I think I should of added a bit of chopped celery as another reviewer suggested. Overall, worth the try.

This recipe is wonderful. I did not add the bay leaf even though I love the flavor (my husband a physician states that it is carcinogenic) not did I add the W. sauce. I made this to get rid of some half and half that was getting close to its use by date. The sherry and tabasco sauce add a definite new layer. Wonderful.

Great recipe - so easy. I skipped the bacon and used olive oil to saute the onion, to which I added fennel, celery and carrot. I think it needs a bit more thickening and next time I'll add extra flour. I was heavy handed with the tabasco and worcestershire; I also used all the sherry and loved it. I added some shrimp. Definitely a keeper.

This was good, I followed the recipe except for adding celery with the onions and only adding 3 tbsp sherry. I don't think the separate step for the cream and the clams is really necessary unless you;re intent on boiling the chowder after adding the potatoes.

This was delicious! I lived in New England for 4 years,and this is THE BEST clam chowder I have ever had - seriously. The only modification I made was to substitute 1.5 cups whole organic milk in place of all the heavy cream. Less fat,but still rich and delicious - I just let it thicken an extra 5 minutes. I was skeptical about the tobasco and worcestershire sauce additions but a few shakes of the bottle really gave a great depth to the taste!
