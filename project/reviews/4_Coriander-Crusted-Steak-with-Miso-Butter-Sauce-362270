This was pretty tasty, the sauce was nice but something something in the tastes was a bit off. In the future I will try other recipes that marinate the steak with miso or have a simpler sauce. I think what bothered me about this might have been that I only wanted the tastes of steak and miso.

I made this for my husband for Father's Day recently, and he is still raving about it weeks later. I made the recipe exactly as written, with the exception of slicing the steak at the end. I also made a tofu version for myself and our toddler, and it was a big hit with us too. DH declared the sauce better than his beloved Worcestershire sauce - which is a pretty big deal since he prefers it over just about everything else for steak.

Quick and delicious. I almost skipped the green onions, figuring who needs green onions, but they are key. I will make this again, maybe tri tip next time.

We really liked this a lot, especially given how quickly it came together. Served it with steamed veggies and rice. This will definitely make it into our weeknight rotation.

this came out quite tasty. Couldn't find red miso near me so I bought a red miso soup packet and just sifted out the extras and it came out great.

while this was quite easy, and tasty enough, the flavour combination sounded a lot more promising than the final result, which was kind of dull and uninspired. I have made far better miso sauces following recipes from Elizabeth Andoh, this one is quite unremarkable -- and I was underwhelmed with the dish.

Quick, easy, and very flavorful! I've made this three times now on my boyfriend's request - twice with flank steak and once with chicken. Used crushed cumin for the crust and made the sauce exactly as instructed. It's come out beautifully every time. Served with plain basmati rice which worked well because the miso is strong and salty.
