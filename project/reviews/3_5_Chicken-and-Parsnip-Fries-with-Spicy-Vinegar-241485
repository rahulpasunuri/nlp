Honestly, I can never get a recipe right, but this is the first time it actually turned out delicious! This was the best chicken I've made, and the parsnips were oh so good. Never tried them before. I added some dried rosemary to parsnip seasoning, and used a mix of apple cider vinegar and pear infused white vinegar for the sauce, but I'm sure it would be delicious without changes as well.

Easiest epicurious recipe I've made. Parnip fries were delicious. Chicken is simple, and kid-friendly.

We had this last night, I used half raspberry vinegar and white, the raspberry added a good flavor. The parsnips are great, sweet and earthy. Nice simple and easy dinner.

This was honestly the first time I've ever had a parsnip and was wary. However, roasting them with the chicken really brought out the natural sweetness. Also made the spicy vinegar and thought it was a nice pairing with the sweetness of the "fries".

Maybe I'm just not a parsnip girl. We love heating up the apartment with the oven, and we love eating new veggies, but we didn't love this. It was edible... but sweet potato fries are so much better.

This is a great marinade for any light meat, but the fries are really the star here. I make them with almost every meal now, and they never get old - plain or with BBQ or other dipping sauce. Yum!

I made the recipe as written and I thought it was a quick, healthy and tasty weeknight meal. I really liked the vinegar sauce with the chicken but the parsnip "fries" while delicious never did get crispy. Even still I would make it again. It went very well served with a side of wilted spinach.

This recipe was quick and easy with great results. I picked up parsnips at the grocery store without having a plan in mind for their preparation - this was perfect! I think I cut the parsnips a little thin as they baked up quicker than expected. I also substituted peanut oil for the olive oil for baking the parsnips because of the high roasting temperature. We had pan roasted pork chops rather than the chicken, so we sauted the pepper flakes for a few seconds before using the vinegar (we only had cider vinegar on hand) to deglaze the pan. The result was amazing! We'll definitely be making this again!

Like others, we thought the Parsnips were great, and the chicken was just a sideline. Will make the parsnip 'fries' again.

I made this recipe as is and it was really easy, quick and tasty and was a big hit. Even my 20 month old daughter loved it! The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because it created so much smoke in my house that the fire alarms kept going off. Maybe it would have been less smoky if I used vegetable oil instead of olive oil. But, even still, I will definitely be making this again.

Tasty and easy. Took about 5 minutes longer than the recipe said, but that may be from opening the oven a few times to stir the parsnips.

I am with those who loved thiis recipe. I just made the parsnip "fries" to go with curried rice and grilled lamb chops and they were wonderful. Next time I will make the full recipe as written.

Wow, these parsnip fries are delicious. And I loved the simple chicken with them, all doused in vinegar. I will make this again. So easy to make too.

White truffle oil goes really well with these fries.

We loved this dish. We have made it a few times since we received this issue. We loved the taste of the chicken and the parsnip fries were wonderful. We made this dish with balsamic vinegar as well and loved them both. We will make this dish many times again.

I did not care for the vinegar sauce. The chicken was also nothing special. The parsnip fries were delicious so those at least I will make again.
