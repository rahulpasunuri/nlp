I thought this was delicious, easy and quick. I did saute some shallots and mushrooms before adding the shrimp. A good quality wine is a must. The tarragon has such a wonderful flavor and if you can't eat shellfish substitute salmon or chicken.

I thought this was delicious, easy & quick. I also sauted some shallots before adding the shrimp and mushrooms. Good quality wine is a must. For those who can't eat shellfish try a piece of salmon or chicken. The tarragon flavor is great.

This was a very satisfying dinner. I sauteed shallots before adding the shrimp which gave it a nice flavor. I also used thyme instead of tarragon (not a fan). I'll definitely make it again.

This was indeed easy. I used petite frozen peas instead of the pea pods. In general it was a bit bland, but like others I enjoyed the fresh tarragon flavor. When my husband tried it, the first thing he said was, "Do we have any feta?"

This is such a quick and easy meal. Perfect dinner for a busy couple. I doubled everything since I was cooking for my boyfriend and I. I substituted asparagus for sugar snap peas, and I used cooked shrimp from my fish market and just tossed them in with everything at the last minute. I only used a tbsp of butter to cook the tomatoes, wine, etc. and didn't add any additional to try to keep it healthier. I also used lemon pepper to season instead of black. Works well.

I thought this was delicious, especially considering how little work it was to prepare. Just a quick substitution though. I used chicken stock instead of wine and used the rest of the stock to boil the couscous. A very useful recipe!

This was simple to make and delicious. You do need to add salt and pepper at a number of points to really bring out the flavor in the ingredients. I made the recipe as written (plus extra snap peas), except that I pulled out a portion of couscous and shrimp for my kid who doesn't like sauces. What amazed me most of all was how quick it was. This will become a regular weeknight staple in our house.

I was surprised by how tasty this was. And easy to prepare to boot! I agree that the tarragon really carries the dish, but the quality of the white wine is also extremely important to how this recipe turns out. I used an Italian Pinot Grigio.

I was worried this dish might be a little bland, but the only thing we changed was the couscous into quinoa, and it was delicious. The fresh tarragon really carries the dish. My husband is already looking forward to eating it again.

So good especially considering the effort. Mmmmm. . .We made no changes except for using extra snap peas.

This was a great couscous dish, prepared in no time! The flavors really mixed well together and I would recommend this for any dinner party because the effort/outcome ratio is quite good for this recipe!
