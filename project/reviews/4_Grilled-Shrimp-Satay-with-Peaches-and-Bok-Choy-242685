Can I give it 5 forks?! What are the odds that you have this combination of ingredients two days before grocery day? I made this with gross, crunchy peaches and orange juice, and it was incroyable - unbelievable. The heat of the barbecue made the peaches taste perfect, and I don't think the type of juice you use makes much difference. Mr. Wonderful had to work late, and he was lucky I saved him a portion. I could have eaten the whole thing by myself!!!

A bit disappointed with the dish - my family did not enjoy it (although it was edible). Too sweet.

This sauce is fantastic! I subbed the peach nectar for apricot, which added a nice tangy flavor. Also, I more than doubled the chili paste (Sriracha). The bok choi was so-so, but the shrimp and the peaches were amazing! I will make this again and again.

Reduced the sugar and peach nectar; still found it a bit too sweet for my taste. Would probably increased rice vinegar, halve amount of brown sugar and reduce nectar by a 1/3.

It's really the SAUCE that steals the show and gets the 4 stars. The combination of the bok choy and peaches with the peanuty sauce seemed a little disconnected but the way the sauce tasted with the shrimp made up for that. Made brown rice with this and my husband and I kept drowning our rice in the sauce since it was SO good. Next time, I might make different vegies on the side but will keep the sauce!!!

So delicious! Served it over rice, didn't change much, except using nectarine nectar in place of peach (all the store I was at had, weird I know) I will surely make this again!

My boyfriends hates fruit with meat, but I thought it might be different with seafood and gave it shot. He loved it! He keeps telling me that we have to make sure we have it again. Awesome.

the satay sauce is by far the best i have ever tasted. I am a private chef for a family and this recipe got Rave reviews. the only substitutions i made because i cook for a small family and peach nectar although sold in most grocery stores comes in a much larger quantity than the recipe calls for so i bought a 6 pack of pineapple juice cans and used that instead.. the flavor from the pineapple juice really added an element of sweet and of tangy.. and i did not use hot chilli paste i used a bottle of Thai sweet chili sauce which was more of a duck sauce type consistency and i added a small sprinkle of red chili flakes to make up some of the heat.. texturally and flavor wise this sauce was OUT OF THIS WORLD..

I would really like to make this recipe for Fathers Day tomorrow but don't know exactly what peach nectar is or where to buy it? What form does it come in? THANK YOU!

This was delicious for the whole family, including my 8 year old, which is what earns it four forks. I made a couple of adjustments based on what I had in the house - including throwing a half-cup of canned, light peaches in the blender for the nectar, and adding chili powder to the peanut sauce instead of paste. In the future, I will make a little batch of the sauce with less chili for my son's taste. Overall, this was an excellent family meal!

I followed the recipe exactly. I scratched my head at first. Visually I had no idea how this was going to work. It really was a delightful dish. A good all around satay sauce for any dish. I used the extra sauce on chicken the next night. Definitely worth making.

This was an interesting one. I was excited about it as I bought the ingredients. Intrigued as I mixed the satay. Hesitant as I cooked it all, and surprisingly pleased as I served it. I don't have a grill so I did it all in a dry cast iron pan on the stovetop. I can see how the grill would do wonders for this dish. Also, natural peanut butter is a MUST. I used commercial Kraft peanut butter and it was way too overpowering for the satay. Probably a 4-fork dish if done to the letter, but unfortunately, my modifications made it three forks, at best.

this was a really nice really quick dinner. We didn't do the bok choy but instead served with some sauteed snow peas and jasmine rice and it was a great combination.

I made the Satay sauce with fresh in-season peach juice (not nectar). It was fabulous, about 10 times better than some stuff I bought in a jar off the shelf. Will never buy pre-made again.

I served this at a lunch party and everyone raved about it. Definitely falls into the keeper category. I used apricot nectar since I could not find any peach nectar. It was definitely the hit of the party.

I made this last night and loved it. I used canned peach syrup for the "nectar" and since their weren't any peaches or nectarines at the neighborhood market I subbed in fresh organic mango. I served with coconut thai rice. I will definitely make this again!

Grilling everything together makes this recipe really easy. I enjoyed the flavor of the satay sauce and the peaches and bok choy held up really well to the heat of the grill.

Loved the sauce. It was really great on gulf shrimp(avoid the farm raised asian shrimp - it tastes like card board). The peached are fine for the grill, however I'm not sure about the baby bok choy. The bulb part did ok but the leafs burnt to a crisp.

The recipe was tasty and unusual. I did substitute chicken for the shrimp and almond butter for peanut butter, and used less hot chili paste.

I've made this twice already and my whole family loved it. My husband generally does not eat seafood but he really enjoyed these shrimp. I followed the recipe and would not make any changes. We liked the sweetness mixed with the hot chili paste.

We made it exactly as written and it was delicious. The bok choy and shrimp were the stars.

Very good, easy and so flavorful. I marinated the shrimp for a couple of hours a a bit of the sauce (I added more hot sauce for our taste). Grilled with zuchini (no bock choy on hand) and didn't bother with the peaches given other's reviews. Served with the remaining sauce over sobo noodles. Yummy.

Well,let me start by saying that I do collect recipes that have weird combinations. This is a go-to recipe when you can get peaches. I served this with a beautiful Trimbach Gewuerztraminer! If you don't make this dish you are really missing out on one of the best fusion recipes! Please enyoy this dish this summer while we have those beautiful peaches. C

This dish is great for a quick and easy weeknight meal. I skipped the bok choy as I have a thing against warm greens and grilled red pepper strips instead. Served it all over brown rice . . . fantastic!

My sauce ended up a bit thick so I couldn't "drizzle" it - I ended up just tossing the ingredients and some of the sauce together. Not pretty, but it tasted fantastic. We've never grilled bok choy before, and my husband loved the grilled flavor.

Great sauce, which I will make again, but I didn't care for the meal that much, especially the bok choy. The meal ended up good but not something I'd make again. If the recipe had been for just the sauce, I'd give it 3 or 4 stars.

I made this according to the recipe but did not have baby bok choy so used quartered mediium- large bok choy - delicious. The grilling brought out a different ta ste to the bok choy - I kept it quite crisp.

Simply Gourmet!! This was a yummy entree!

I have made this recipe with a few variations and each time it has been a hit! I have never had the chili sauce on hand so I have substituted red curry paste or cayenne pepper with success. I have also tweaked it by adding a bit more peanut butter, a few more dashes of soy sauce, etc. until it tastes perfect to me. I have served it with the peaches but not the bok choy - yum! And lacking a grill I have always pan sauteed the shrimp. Great served over quinoa or rice to soak up the great sauce. As a private chef, I will definitely at this recipe to my repertoire!

I'm not going to rate it because I didn't make it exactly as it appears. I made the sauce as written, except I used mango nectar in place of peach, and I would rate it 4 forks. I agree with other reviewers, however, that you cannot taste the fruit nectar in the sauce. I used it on grilled shrimp and chicken breast skewers, both threaded with red pepper pieces. No peaches or bok choy. The chicken in particular was outstanding. I served it with rice and fresh mango slices. The fresh, cool mango was a wonderful foil for the spicy sauce.

With a considerable amount of tweeking this was pretty good: cut back on sugar and the sauce is rally good. Skip the peaches - they really dont add a thing to the recipe and make the whole thing way too fruity -- I stir fried some asparagus with a little lack bean sauce as a counterpoint to the sweetness of the shrimp. Bok choy was okay

I loved the flavors. I used apricot nectar because I could'nt find peach. I didn't think the peaches did anything for it. Imade it with rice, next time I'll use noodles. I used the peanut sauce to make a sesame noodle Yummy.

Wow!!! It just doesn't get better than this :D I didn't have the Bok Choy so I was going to grill some Iceberg. After I drizzeled the sauce on the lettuce I realized that this was also an amazing salad dressing. I am going to go make it again right now w/ the bok choy. I am dumfounded by the 2 negative reviews. They must not have made it right.

Yummy. The only thing we would change next time is the sugar we would cut back on it a wee bit. Overall a great recipe easy yet gourmet. We will make it again.

I used a total of about 10-12 tbsp. of the peach nectar and a little extra chili sauce, then mixed all of it in with the other ingredients, skewered the shrimp and marinated them overnight . After grilling, they were incredibly moist and were a huge hit at a BBQ. I've already had half a dozen requests for them again.

We loved this recipe so much we've made it twice in one week...our three teenagers can't get enough of this dish (and we feel the same way!). We also use chicken for the non-shrimp lovers in the family and have added in more chili paste but otherwise stay true to the recipe. We serve this with pad thai and naan. Yum!

This recipe was really not very good at all. None of the peach flavor came through and the peanut butter sauce was just too overwhelming to be served over everthing. The sauce was actually really good though and would be excellent with a chicken satay. Just skip the shrimp, peaches, and bok choy.

Rating: 4
Made this last night without any changes. If was terrific. Natural peanut butter must vary, as my sauce was not too thick to drizzle. Served it with the Curried Rice Pilaf with Cashews and it was a hit. To 'A Cook' recipe calls for teas. of hot chili paste, not tbls. I ended up using 3 teas. and found just the right amount of heat. Definitely a keeper.

Lovely recipe, VERY tasty. I gave it three stars simply because the sauce was too thick. Also, the recipe could have used a bit of line and the end product could have been sprinkled with fresh chopped parsley. I did those things, and I also added water to it to make the sauce more of a pourable sauce, and made some rice, and then place the dry ingerdients over the rice along with the sauce. Perfect

we really liked this recipe, although the sauce was really hot with just two tablespoons of the hot sauce. I recommend tasting after 1 tablespoon - I am sure different brands vary.
