Why are people cooking their tenderloin to 120 degrees? That is not carpaccio. If you want medium-rare filet, then eat medium-rare filet.

This is an amazing dish. Everyone raves whenever I make it. I let everyone appreciate before I mention the lavendar. It is very subtle but I think it is part of what makes the dish unique. The salsa complements everything perfectly!

I made this for New Year's eve and it was a great hit. Parmesan for gouda was the only change. The lavender blossoms produced a nice aroma during the searing step, but were too subtle a flavour to impart much taste to the final result.I knew the peppery flavour or arugula would go well, but the the excellence of the orange salsa was a surprise.

I made the salsa and carpaccio the day before and served the whole thing on one large platter. People raved and the whole batch and a half was gone in about 10 minutes.

Followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious! 12 Minute searing and letting it rest 15 min to finish yielded a 1/2' brown ring with a rare interior. The presentation was beautiful. I was skeptical about the salsa but it turned out to be the icing on the carpaccio! This was a gorgeous presentation and simple to make.

This was great. I took the advice of the person from Chicage and roasted the beef for 10 minutes at 350 after searing it. It came out at 120. I used 1 pound of beef and made it into 8 salads. I agree that the salsa and arugulla are not enouogh for 10. I also skipped the blossoms.

This was outstanding. I served as first course, and even the 7-year old among us had seconds. The presentation is beautiful and the textures and flavors made for an incomparable beginning. Everyone is asking when I'll be making this again.

This was great!! I would definitely make it again. We had it as one of our appetizers for our gourmet dinner group. After searing the meat, I cooked it on a low flame until a meat thermometer registered 120 degrees. This left the middle rare instead of raw. For 10 people, I increased the meat to 2lbs. I made the salsa according to the recipe. Next time, I would probably double it.

Wow! Unique combination that goes beautiful together. I served this recipe to an important dinner party. Got the WOW in prensentation & taste. I followed the recipe exactly except for the optional lavender blossoms & kalamata olives because I picked out the wrong ones (Similar in taste, but not as strong), but work just as well. Well worth the effort. Absolute keeper!

This dish is fantastic. We made this is as an appetizer and the Provencal Fish Stew with Rouille as the main course. The dishes complemented each other wonderfully. For this recipe, I did not use the optional lavender blossoms. I also accidentally bought smoked gouda rather than aged gouda. We were both a little hesitant over the cold meat (especially after a bad experience with steak tartare in Orleans, France). Needless to say, we got over the hesitancy very quickly. Great recipe!
