I almost moved on when I saw no reviews. This is a delicious treat! So easy to make and perfect in every way. The taste and texture was awesome. I made it for my staff and they raved about it. A perfect balance of peanut butter and chocolate. If you want something outstanding and don't have much time this is the item for you!

I only used 2 1/2 tablespoons of butter because I didn't want my pie to ooze. After chilling, it cut into neat slices.
