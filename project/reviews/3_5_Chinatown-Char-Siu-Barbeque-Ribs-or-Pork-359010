Wow! My husband and I each bbq'd our own recipes Oscar Night. He used a tradtional K.C. BBQ rub and I made this recipe. Guess what!! We ate ALL my ribs that night and very few of his. This is SUCH a winner recipe. I also cooked them for an extra 30 minutes. I cooked them in foil the last 30 minutes which kept them moist. You will not be disapointed.

Finger lickin' good! I added a little more cooking time, only about 10 min more, to ensure the pork ribs were cooked through. Otherwise, the recipe is great as is!

You might be put off by the strong flavour of the 5-spice powder when you initially taste the marinade, but don't worry. It mellows out and blends with the rest of the the flavours once its cooks. Like others, I cut the rack into riblets with a lot of success. You may want to consider basting the ribs with honey instead of the marinade to give it a more authentic char siu flavour

This is my husband's absolute favorite rib recipe ever since the first time I made it. I cut the ribs into individual riblets before I put them in the marinade (more surface area to soak up the goodness!) It is the perfect Asian pork flavor -- tastes like they are from a great Asian restaurant. I use bourbon in the marinade.

Turned out great. Had company over and they were literally licking their fingers.

The sauce was ok. A little on the overly sweet side. The cooking time for the ribs was WAY off. After the hour and twenty minutes the recipe called for, they were only half cooked. I had to put them in for another 30 minutes. The family requested that we not make this again.

I wanted to make char siu bao (Chinese pork buns) from scratch, and found this recipe for the char siu portion. (If you want to make your own char siu bao, the LA Times has a good recipe for the dough and filling). I used pork chops instead of ribs and cooked my meat in the oven. Other than that, I pretty much followed this recipe. The results were amazing. For the hot sauce I used sriracha "rooster sauce" and while I was hesitant about the food coloring, it really gave the meat that restaurant look. If you don't have Chinese 5 spice powder, I would strongly recommend finding some because it really gives the meat that extra kick that you're used to with restaurant char siu. While I used pork chops, I think this sauce would be amazing on ribs. Then again, the sauce is so good you could probably put it on anything. I'll definitely be making this again.
