I loved this recipe because of it's ease and simplicity. You could vary this sweet cake in SOO many different ways! I made a sauce from the raspberries I picked that day, with lemon, Chambord and a little confectioner's sugar. I added a second cookie to the middle layers with the sauce in between the two chocolate wafers. It is a sweet dessert but also delicious!

This was so good! We don't have chocolate wafers here so I used some brownie cookies that I had baked before. I put some mascarpone in with the whipped cream just to liven up the cream a little. This dessert was fantastic.

So Good! I made it with slices of banana instead of rasberries, and it turned out beautifully.

This is just a variation on the 50 year old recipe that's on the box of Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafers. But an excellent variation it is. Instead of making individual servings, I made this in a 8" springform pan, using a package and a half of wafers and 1 pint of whipping cream. I put a row of cookies on end around the edge. 3 layers with berries included in the middle layer. Finished to top with a layer of whipped cream. Then just before serving I arranged raspberries points up all over the top. It was gorgeous and tasted even better.

I just love recipes like this that are shamefully easy, but impressive in appearance and taste. I cooked this for Valentines dinner, and as the rest of the meal was going to be time consuming, I opted for this one b/c of it's simplicity. After husband scraped up the last of his cake, he asked "I don't suppose you've got another one hiding somewhere" I haven't one clue how they made the "frosting" look so smooth in the picture...mine was a bit scary looking and couldn't get it smooth at all with my cake knife or silicone spatula. I finally shaved up alot of dark chocolate and pressed it into the sides.

I never thought that my late grandmother's recipe could get any better, until I found this! This recipe is a great combination of chocolate, whipped cream, and the subtleness of raspberry. My only suggestion is to garnish with shaved chocolate, as my grandma did. I would definately make this recipe again!

This was so easy! Though, mine didn't come out looking nearly as pretty as the picture and it kept falling over while I was trying to stack them, but it was still so yummy! I made it as directed, but I bet you could use already made whipped cream too.
