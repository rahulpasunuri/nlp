So I made the below recipe addition three times, each time to perfection. Basically after the cream was absorbed, I started going to town with the nutmeg. The toasted pumpkin seed oil was also a wonderful addition. Try it for a nuanced taste at breakfast!

I am going to make a suggestion on jazzing this recipe up based on another recipe from Bon Appetit that I made, the pumpkin seed spaetzle. Just like eggs, spaetzle needs a little something at the end to give it a jolt of flavor, so now I quote: "Melt butter in large skillet over medium heat. Add spaetzle; sprinkle lightly with nutmeg and stir until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer spaetzle to large bowl. Drizzle pumpkin seed oil over and serve." So, just substitute the word "eggs" for "spaetzle" and start adding nutmeg when the eggs get to your preferred level of doneness! I am totally going to try this tomorrow. To the person talking about the shell being unpalatable, I really hope you are kidding. Even then, I feel you are just spamming the ratings with false negatives. If you're not, then perhaps you should go back to trying to boil water.

Have to disagree with the reviewer who said the crunch of the shells was unpalatable. The texture is far more interesting with the shells included. I have taken the concept to include crab shells in creme brulee and it is out of this world!

Interesting, some people do not seem to realize the huge difference that makes very slow cooking and constant scrambling. Did these eggs look like the ones they serve in your corner's coffee shop? Yes!! Then you got it all wrong.(Add some chives and finely chopped yellow pepper, close your eyes, you are at Maxim's. It doesn't get any better than this!!)

What do scrambled eggs have to do with lobster? These were good for what they are.

Well, scrambled eggs. It needs no introduction nor review really. It was OK. Nothing to write home about.

Really easy and delicious, but a little heavy on the butter. This Eater recommends 2 tbsp butter.
