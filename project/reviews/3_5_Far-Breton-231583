Very easy to make. I didn't light the brandy, just let it soak with the fruit.

I've made this at least a dozen times, easy and forgiving. I also upped the vanilla and use any dried fruit I have on hand. In fact I had forgotten about this recipe and was thinking of doing a custard pie for Christmas Eve. Then I remembered the Far Breton! Easy easy easy! and so delicious!

I made this with rum and a day in advance as stated in the recipe and it was perfect. Not too sweet but tasteful. Next time, I might try not remove the alcohol next time, see how it influences the taste :)

This is spot on. I recently returned from Bretagne, where I was introduced to this dish. Can be a bit bland if you don't make it with the prunes. It is so simple, yet very good.

Good but not great. A little bland -- may to well with a little lemon. Also, too many prunes.

This was fine. There were too many prunes (and I like prunes), but the Armagnac flavor to them overwhelmed a bit (and I like Armagnac, too!). It was easy to make, came out of the pan easily and was a pleasant texture (it is not good after being refrigerated), but I won't make it again because it was just "good." The Tart au Sucre from this site is much better and another one that would be great as dessert or breakfast. It, too, is easy, pretty, different, etc., but way better than this recipe.

My mother's best friend is from Belgium. When she made Far Breton for us, it was wonderful. But as an interesting twist she use tropical trail mix instead of fruit. She also substituted 1/2 cup of the whole milk with 1/2 cup of half and half. How indulgent and addictive and a great holiday breakfast treat! Best, Eve

Excellent, must be tried. I used prunes simmered with triple sec (nothing nicer in the house) and sauteed 2 apples with very small amount of butter, brown sugar & cinnamon...and used a whole vanilla bean and touch of vanilla extract. Otherwise followed it to a t. My cooking time was only 45 min at most. Not too sweet but fantastic and excellent with lots of vanilla. I used a square Le Creuset dish and one big parch paper to line the whole thing. No problem removing the paper from the dessert. Rustically beautiful.

Love this recipe! Try it with dried cherries and kirsch for brandy.

The taste was great. I used golden and dark raisins and only added cinnamon. But please don't make the same mistake that I did. I followed one reviewer's suggestion to use a spring form pan. So much batter spilled out even with the aluminum foil. Such a waste.

It's wonderful! I have made it four or five times since the recipe appeared. I have varied the dried fruit and spirits, my favorite being cut up dried apples prepared with Calvados. Great!

Rating: 4
Superb for both dessert and breakfast. Rustic flavor, not too sweet. I omitted the brandy/armagnac and simply poached the fruits in water. Turned out fine, though the liquor will certainly add a richer dimension. Remember to work with all ingredients at room temperature. Also be sure to use a pan deep enough, my batter rose so much in the oven that it spilled a little. Otherwise, this made for an impressive presentation. Love it!

I've made this several times. It's great as a breakfast food too. The greatest compliment I got from this came from a super-picky Frenchman, who just loved it.

I spent 3 summers in Britanny as a kid and I used to eat quite a bit of far, as it seemed the family matriarch made some every day. I can say that this recipe yields a far that is pretty damn close to what I used to it in Bretagne. Kenavo!

Followed recipe exactly. The brandy wouldn't light, probably too much water left. Baked up great, soft and custardy texture but holds up on your plate and your fork. Delish! If you don't like these fruits, try other dried ones.

WONDERFUL. Substituted dried apricots for prunes. Poached in a mix of water and grape juice - teetotalers. Followed other reviewers and used one teaspoon of vanilla paste. Not overly sweet. Smooth, creamy, delicious. Delicate flavor.

So easy and delicious. A very simple kind of recipe that you could adapt in anyway you like. Either have it as written (but I added a full tspn of vanilla) which is very subtle solid custard, or add extra flavours (cinnamon, brown sugar ... do a brulee top!) and make it extra special. I made mine using dried apricots soaked in brandy instead of prunes, and it was just delicious. "Cake" is also solid enough to be a picnic type cake (wont fall apart in your hands if eating without a table!), I wrapped up pieces and took them for lunch at work and it travelled really well.

Yum. Very french. On the eggy side, so if you're not a fan of that kind of thing, skip this recipe. I followed others' advice and used a full teaspoon of vanilla, but other than that followed the recipe exactly. I liked it very much.

Used dried tart cherries with the prunes. Agree with other reviewer that this recipe could use a little extra something to make this more interesting. Maybe next time I will sub grand marnier for the cognac and add some orange zest. the custard sets up nicely and has a good texture.

Rating: 2
I agree with previous reviewers that this is very easy. I made it in a deep dish ceramic pie dish, buttered and floured, and served it in wedges, like a pie. It didn't stick. I found the flavor bland, though (used prunes, raisins, and dried cranberries) -- pleasant enough, probably a little more like breakfast than dessert, but not distinctive enough to make again.

I made this recipe with dried apricots for a family get-together and it was great. It was very easy and everyone had seconds. It made a good breakfast the next day, and I actually liked it cold better.

I do not have Brandy on hand but used rum, and it was very good. Very interesting texture. I would make it again, but I would love to try different fruit cominations. Very easy to make.

I've made this again and again, in different variations. It is an easy, elegant addition to any menu, functioning equally well for breakfast, brunch, dessert, or afternoon snack! I heartily recommend it to even those who don't normally bake.

Lovely creation which I will make again and again. I love biting into brandy soaked fruit, the flavor distinct from the lucious cake/custard. I made it as written as well as with a bag and a half of Cascadian farms frozen cherries and preped these with corvossier brandy. Both are fab. I upped the vanilla to 1t. They were beautiful and delicious. Enjoy all!

Easy to make and foolproof. I doubled the recipe and made one one day, the other the next. I used dried Turish apricots and sultanas and brandy. Three of us ate 2/3 of it for lunch.

I have made this recipe twice this week. Once with dried apricots and once with dried pears. They were both terrific. Like everybody else, I increased the vanilla to 1 teaspoon. My family enjoyed it more when it was completely cooled down.

A comment to some of the earlier posts - if you use a butter with a higher fat content (like Plugra, or some of the European butters), you may find it helpful to adjust the baking time. The higher fat content requires a longer cooking time. just a little food science fun!

This was exactly what I was looking for to bring to our family brunch. The recipe works like a dream--I did follow other reviewers admonitions to increase the amount of vanilla in the recipe. Everyone loved it!

I thought this was a nice change to normal breakfast fare. It was incredibly easy to make and delicious. Perfect just as written with one strange occurrance. My parchment paper dissapeared! Do you think it desolved into the cake? We couldn't find it at all.

Made with Dried Apricots instead of rasins/prunes and absolutely loved it! Great for breakfast the next day, as well.

This was very nice. I thought the brandy would be overpowering but it isn't. I will add more vanilla to the batter next time and maybe serve it with a dollop of whipped cream. I regret that I didn't use parchment paper; should have; When completely cooled, I had problems removing it from the pan.

One of the easiest desert recipes I've made, great base for trying out new ideas. I used a cup of toasted coconut instead of the fruit, and added a 4 tbs of amaretto to the batter. Don't leave out the parchment paper on the botton.

Very tasty and not too difficult to make.

Definitely worth working on but wasn't as good as expected, perhaps because of changes made. Dropped sugar to 1/3c, but wouldn't again. Six ounces prunes (soaked, simmered, halved) seemed like a lot (skipped raisins) even though used a dish w more diameter so end result was thinner. The dish was Corningware, needed more than just greasing for custard to release. Next time will add bit of lemon zest for brightness in contrast to prunes. I mention all these things that didn't work in case anyone else is similarly tempted and now would think better of it!

Easy and excellent.

Really Good! Bumped the vanilla up to 1 tsp. as previously recommended. Didn't have any prunes so we used dried pears, dried peaches and some dried cherries along with the raisins and it was delicious! Next time I'll use more dried cherries both for color and a hint of tart. Didn't butter the pan but sprayed an 8 inch springform pan and the cake came out very easily without all the other fuss but the springform does need to be wrapped in aluminum foil as it does leak a bit. This is going to become a real regular in our house --- just a light dusting with powdered sugar for looks made it very pretty and super delicious. Can't wait to make it again.

I have use Epicurious' recipies for years, BUT this is the first one I am reviewing to let others know what a terrific recipe this is. It was easy, unusual and my family loved it. I used cooking brandy not Armagnac. I've made it twice. Both times a big hit!!

Delicious! Try this recipe as written, with a full teaspoon of vanilla, then experiment with other fresh/dried fruits. Made twice this week and it's only Tuesday!

I adore this cake because it's not too sweet and seems to go over well with sophisticated and picky eaters. I have made this 6 times already and it's a standard now. I think the prunes make it more unusual than cherries. Butter does rise to the top after baking (used Plugra butter)but I just soak it up with a paper towel.

I made this the other night. it is wonderful. A little too much fruit. I might try different combiations of ddired fruit such as pears and appricots. It's a keeper for our house.

I thought it was delicious for either dessert or breakfast. I used a springform pan - luckily I had the foresight to wrap it in foil because it leaked.

Next time I'll omit the butter as I found the end product collected a puddle of oil on top. I didn't have any prunes so I substituted dried apricots with good results.

I, too, added more vanilla, and I plan to experiment with other flavorings (citrus, almond) at a later date. I also used dried cranberries instead of raisins. Lastly, I used a springform pan, which simplified the de-panning process.

I agree with the previous reviewer that you don't need to use the parchment paper and make this recipe any harder than it needs to be in the first place. I also used half & half instead of milk, used a little bit more vanilla than called for, and used 1/3 of a cup of brandy for the raisins and prunes. The prunes are nice but not necessary, a good handful of plum raisins will do nicely. Perfect dessert or brunch treat!! I will definitely make this one again!!

I followed the recipe closely, except for the unnecessisarily complicated unmolding technicques at the end. I didn't have any problems; the amount of batter fit the size of pan specified. However, I am not a fan of prunes and would likely substitute cherries next time, which would make it a more a traditional clafouti. Making the batter and/or the fruit prep the night before ensured assembly was a snap the next day. However, I would suggest that small amount of batter be poured in first, then the fruit arranged, with the majority of the batter poured in after. This helps insure an even distribution of fruit, which can't be done if it is all poured in first. A very nice dish in my opinion.

I followed the recipe closely, except for the unnecessarily complicated unmolding technique at the end, and had no problems. The amount of batter fit perfectly within the pan specified. However, I'm not a fan of prunes but thought the dish overall was quite good in taste and appearance. I'd probably switch to cherries, which would make it closer to a traditional clafouti, next time. Making the batter the night before, made assembly a snap. But I would suggest pouring a small amount of batter on the bottom of the pan first, then arranging the fruit before pouring in the remainder of the batter. This will help assure even distribution of the fruit, which really can't be done if all the batter is poured in first.

I followed the recipe, except for the unnecessary steps for unmolding, and had no problems. The amount of batter was perfect for the size pan specified. I am not a big fan of prunes and would change over to cherries, which would make it more a traditional clafouti instead. I liked the overall texture, taste and look of the dish and didn't think it was overly complicated. Making the batter the night before was a snap, and then dealing with the fruit the next morning couldn't be simpler. I would suggest laying the fruit in first to ensure it distributed evenly and then pouring the batter over it. Or you could put a little batter in first, then arrange the fruit and pour more. Once the batter is in, you can't really see how well the fruit is arranged.

We made this at work and it was awful. The instructions were long and involved more steps than necessary. It was very bland. It was not worth all the work and ended up in the trash.

Rating: 3
Although I deviated quite a bit from the original recipe, I enjoyed it very much. I love custardy things and even though I don't care for prunes and wasn't intending to flambe or add any alcohol I figured it would still be tasty as is. I just made it as a custard and added dried strawberries for a little added flavor - no prunes or liquor. I baked it in a silicone pan on a cookie sheet (to give stability to those floppy silicone pans)and didn't need to butter or flour. It just popped right out.

I thought this was fabulous. Taste and texture. It takes a while to make but worth it if you plan ahead. I used currants and prunes which worked out very well. The only thing puzzling to me was that it seemed to be too much batter for the size pan recommended. Even when I went up a size, it was still too much.

Brought this to a dinner party where it went over very well. The recipe is easy, although it didn't contain nearly enough brandy for ignition. I also found this to be a little bland for my palate, but it's still good enough that I would make it again with a few minor changes - I'd double the vanilla & the brandy. I used pitted prunes & white raisins, & half & half (rather than milk) for added richness. The texture was smooth & delicious. This would be great as a brunch item. The final instructions are also more complicated than necessary. I buttered & dusted the entire pan with flour, rather than using parchment & the finished cake came out cleanly w/o sticking, after it had thoroughly cooled. Loosening with a knife also wasn't required. I simply dusted the top with confectioner's sugar, rather than using the intricate wax paper method. Why make a recipe more difficult than need be?
