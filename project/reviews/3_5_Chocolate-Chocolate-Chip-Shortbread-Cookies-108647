Excellent! They melt in your mouth. I started off with the cuisinart, however butter bunched up, so I continued the recipe in my regular mixer. I also watched them closely, otherwise would have burnt.

Tastes great when modified, like everyone said, but what is a recipe worth if there are flaws and it needs to be modded? My problem wasn't the same as others had, like the Cuisinart (mine is one of the most powerful on market), it was BAKING: 18 minutes?! for cookies?! Yet I trusted this recipe which said 18 minutes, thinking maybe as "shortbread" (which I've never made into cookies before...) there was perhaps some need for 18 minutes...they came out burnt. Not just a little burnt; I spent the next half-hour scraping this into the garbage-disposal. It turned out better when I modded it so severely that it's now no longer the recipe you see on epicurious. First e.com recipe that went badly for me after making dozens over the years.

In the past two days I've made this recipe twice, and I love it! However, I only get 16 tbsp of dough out of it -- am I doing something wrong? The first time I made it as written except I forgot the walnuts; the second time I wanted the batter less chocolatey so I reserved the chips and mixed them and the walnuts in as chunks before baking. Still, I don't think that should affect the volume quite so substantially, especially since I included the 1-1/2 cup of chips in the dough the first time. Otherwise, though, a total keeper! Definitely bake only about 14 minutes -- I also find using a silpat and a stainless-steel heavy gauge cookie sheet helps prevent burning.

These are good, but I neglected to read all of the reviews, so had real problems w/ the dough in the Cuisinart (the consistency of the dough did turn out fine in the end) & burnt the bottoms on half the batch. 18 min. is far too long...14 worked well. Not sure if I'd make again, given the difficulty w/ food processor. Will wait for the verdict to come in from the end users.

Great recipe, great taste and very easy. Gave them out for X-mas presents everyone loved them.

This is one of my favorite cookie recipes. The trick, for me, is to make the dough like I would for scones. First I add the dry ingredients then I add the butter - ice cold. After the butter, I pour the mix into another bowl and then grind the chips - adding the egg and extracts. Then I mix the flour and chocolate together in batches. It works. I find no difference in the yumminess of the cookies and it is much, much easier on my processor.

I didn't freeze the chips and had no problem mixing even with my cheap little processor. Hard to say if that was due to the slightly softer texture of room-temp chips. They did sort of fall apart after baking, which could be from either over-baking or possibly from using unfrozen chips? Next time I'll chill the dough slightly before shaping and see if that helps. I also used milk chocolate chips at the end instead of semi-sweet which I used in the dough... yummy!

The cookies were quite yummy, however my food processor was not at all happy with the dough. The chips and butter coagulated above the blade and no amount of frequent scraping them down made them stay down. I eventually had to move the dough to a regular bowl. Also, 13 minutes was good for baking.

The tricky part is getting the oven time right, first batch got burnt on the bottom, the second i baked for much less time and they came out great.

My son, the 13-year-old kid who's going to grow up to be the world's toughest food critic, loves these. My food processor was not yet unpacked, so I made these in the traditional way with a mixer. It took a while, but boy, was it worth it. After reading the other reviews, I baked these on a double cookie sheet that was made for Swedish butter cookies. They still were done before 17 minutes, but were not burnt. I will make these again and again.

I don't know what I did wrong. It started when I tried to mix the frozen chips with the butter. I got a very cold unmixable mass. My Cuisinart couldn't handle it. Switched to mixer. Ended up with a dough that was either over- or undermixed and not user friendly. The cookies are edible and will go to the office party, but never again (unless someone can figure out where I goofed).

Loved the taste of this cookie but the bottoms of the cookies were burnt! I only left the second batch in for 17 minutes but they still were pretty black on the bottom. Has anyone else had this problem? Should I reduce the cooking time or temperature? Would love to hear some of your thoughts...thanks!

These were crunchier than I expected them to be, although I suppose that reducing the cooking time would probably solve that. They were fabulous nonetheless. I made them for my Godson's potluck-style baptism reception and they were eaten up immediately. They were the only dessert that was completely gone by the end of the night. I overheard people talking about them and getting others to try them. Everyone complained that they could not stop eating them!! My five year old Goddaughter said they were the best cookies she's ever had.

These are intensely chocolatey--so much so that I was really worried about the intensity when I tasted the cookie dough before baking. They bake up nicely, though, and are very crisp and crunchy all the way through, which really works with the rich flavor. These come out nicely with Ener-G egg replacer for one egg instead of the egg yolk, should anyone need to know. I like them both with and without the nuts, but I don't think the chocolate bits (the ones left whole I mean) add anything to the cookie, and I will leave them out next time. I don't care for almond extract so I left it out, but I would definitely make these again. They keep really well too!

Yummy!!! I only used 1/2 cup sugar and followed the other reviewer and baked for 13 minutes. Perfect. I didn't have almond extract, but they still turned out great. Will definitely make them again.

Pretty good and easy - very little clean-up invovled. I did think perhaps the suggested cooking time was a little long - mine were much better at 13-15 minutes (this could just be my oven, though). Very chocolate-y and not for a shortbread purist!

This recipe was great. I mistakenly added 2 teaspoons of almond extract. I do like the almond flavor, so I thought it worked well. I did not add the walnuts. These cookies were a hit with my children. The texture of the finished product was slightly crumbly. Perhaps I overmixed the dough in the Cuisinart, I'm not sure.

These were delicious, easy and melt in your mouth. They disappeared in a instant. I ended up putting all the sugar into the recipe and just dusting a glass with a little sugar and pressing the cookies down. I didn't have walnuts so used peacans instead.
