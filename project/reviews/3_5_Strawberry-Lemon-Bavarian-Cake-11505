I have made this recipe annually when strawberries are in season. It is always a hit and frequently requested. It presents beautifully and even earned a charity silent auction $50. I do watch the baking of the crust carefully making it the day before generally.Otherwise, I just follow the recipe. The sweetness of the strawberries in season and the tartness of the fresh lemons is (in my opinion) divine!

Ok, I have read over the reviews on the recipe and was very nervous about the crust being to hard and the Bavarian cream being to tart. So the recipe calls for the crust to bake 20-25 minutes you really need to watch it when the timer hits the 20mn mark because you could over bake the crust and that would make it hard to cut. As for the Bavarian cream I found the cream to be just fine and not tart. I think it also depends on the sweetness of the strawberries to balance the sweet and the tartness of the lemon juice. So now the moment you all have been waiting for...I served this desert for Easter dinner and it was a HIT!! I will make this desert over and over again everyone love it.

Just made the filling (no crust) and with meyer lemons (no strawberries). It was quick and very rich/creamy dessert. Was liked by everyone but even a small slice was very filling.

It was delicious, especially the crust, which I made with Splenda for baking, instead of sugar. I served it the next day, and the crust was not at all difficult to cut or serve. My husband did think the Bavarian was too tart, though. I used Splenda in the Bavarian, not Splenda for baking, and it turned out very well, but I do think I might use less lemon juice the next time, just to cut some of the tartness.

Made this for Easter. I held up well and everyone seemed to enjoy it, but I found it to be a bit too sweet.

Since I needed two cakes I doubled the bavarian cream filling and increased the crust by only 50% (1.15 x recipe). I used one 8" and one 9" springform pan. The crust was delicious and easy to cut. I also cut the sugar in half. The first day it was a bit tart, but after that the flavors had blended nicely and mellowed out.

Just made this past weekend for a baby shower and it was a hit. So many requests for the recipe. One note about the shortbread - do not overbake and make sure to use a 10-inch pan so it is not too thick.

Jeez that shortbread was hard. The bavarian was tasty, the lemon played well with the strawberries... but the shortbred was as hard as a rock, especially after refrigeration. If I'd scored it, would it have absorbed the cream better?

This is the third time I've made this cake. It is delicious! Everyone loves it. The only problem I have is slicing through the shortbread.

Made this for my g/f's son's first birthday party and it was enjoyed by one and all. The kids loved it! Looks impressive and it was easy, despite my trepidation about working with gelatin. Tastes good, but not *great*, which is why I only gave it two forks (those Jello comparisons are too true, unfortunately). Nevertheless, a simple, attractive and tasty way to use up strawberries when they are in season.

The Bavarian looked beautiful when brought to table but the taste was totally bland. Too much work for too little taste!

Very pretty dessert. The crust is difficult to cut being refrigertated, I think I'll score the shortbread crust next time

This recipe was great! I made it as Easter dessert ... it was a very creamy but light dessert. I even substitutes raspberry liquer for the orange liquer, and it was amazing! I would definitely make this again ... as a matter of fact, I'm thinking about making it for when my boyfriend comes home from Operation Enduring Freedom!

I made this in my cooking lab that focused on gelatin. This cake turned out to be wonderful! Light, fluffy, and the focus of the class! Our teacher was thoroughly impressed because the group before couldn't get it right. I will make it again most definitely whe strawberries come in season.

Very light, very pretty. Beautiful, actually. But I did think it looked better than it tasted. Everyone seemed to enjoy it though. And it was nice to having something so light and fresh after the heavy Easter meal. The crust was very hard and difficult to cut. Worth making though -- because it's just so light and lovely.

I made this the day before Easter and served it after Easter lunch. I had a lot of strawberries and was searching for a good dessert to use them up. This was a nice light cake that the guests appreciated. It looked pretty but I wasn't that crazy about the taste. It reminded me of jell-o cakes that were the rage in the 70s. I guess I'm not that big a gelatin fan and didn't realize that the texture would come through so strongly. Also I found the cake difficult to cut b/c the shortbread crust was so hard.

directions were great. Never cooked w/ gelatin bofore so had a little trepidation but all worked out great. Ran out of lemons so used half fresh/half bottled lemon juice- no problem. Company raved about how light and refreshing it was. Definately a keeper- will make again (probably next week now that strawberries are in season.) My kids ate the best straberries I held for garnish so used chocolate curls instaad. Also a great addition.

I've made this before, using raspberries when available. It's an easy, delicious, and pretty dessert. For special dinner parties, I divide the bavarian among small souffle dishes (without shortbread bottom), invert on plate, ladle creme anglaise around base, top with a little raspberry puree and mint leaf, a few fresh berries on the side. You can also use the puree to create a pretty swirl effect on the creme anglaise. Everything can be done ahead of time, allowing a few minutes for presentation. Lots of oohs and aahs.

Delicious cake that is a nice light alternative to regular cake with frosting. I made it the night before Easter and decorated it with the strawberries the next day. Looks and tastes wonderful, and very easy to make!

I made this dessert for Easter dinner and it was a big hit -- just the right combination of sweet and tart. Everyone raved, even people who said they weren't that crazy about strawberries. The only thing I did different from the recipe as written was to sprinkle the diced berries with a little sugar, as they weren't very sweet, and let them sit for ten minutes or so. It's beautiful, impressive, festive, really delicious and easy. I took a previous reviewer's advice and decorated it with a large, fanned out strawberry. Couldn't have been simplier or prettier.

I made this dessert when it first appeared in the magazine and it was a hit. Since then I have tried it on different people and they all love it.

This dessert was quite refreshing, but I doubt I will make it again. I was expecting a lemon mousse consistency - light and fluffy, I thought the texture was a little heavy, I found it very easy to make. There are lots of other desserts on this site which are far lighter and more pallatable

This makes a really impressive presentation. You'll get lots of wows and was really quite simple to make.

It's a great recipe would make this again. My friends said it was like a dessert from a fancy restaurant. I'm going to try this recipe with blueberries next, I think that would make a good substatution for summer berries.

Made this for the 2nd time. So simple, so delicious, so impressive. Will be making this many times in the future. Great spring/summer dessert.

I made this cake for Easter dinner dessert and it was a big hit with everyone. It was suprisingly simple to make too. I substituted about half the lemon juice for orange juice and it was still delicious.

Yes it was light and had a nice presentation, but I agree with the 'jello instant mix' comment. It reminded me of a store-bought jello/whipped cream cake. Next time I want a light dessert, I'll make a lemon meringue pie.

This is a great dessert after a rich meal. It's lightness makes it perfect. I need a suggestion as to how to more easily release the shortbread from the base? thanks

Love it! Made it a number of times and it always impresses the guests. It's easy to make but presents like you've slaved over the stove for hours!!

Fairly easy, yet VERY SHOWY. Nice & light for summer. You MUST use FRESH lemon juice to achieve the intended flavor. To avoid having the bavarian stick to the pan sides when unmolding, just run a sharp knife around the perimeter in between the cake & the pan side before releasing the springform. Much easier than the hot towel route.

The recipe was okay. In the end it reminded me of a Jello instant dessert mix. Since you dice up 3 cups of strawberries I suggest frozen for those as a time saver and cost saver. As for decorating the cake one large strawberry sliced as a fan in the center is decoration enough with whole strawberries around the perimeter of the platter. When removing the ring around the bavarian I suggest wrapping a hot towel around it for 5 seconds to loosen the bavarian then pop the springform ring. Mine started to crack when trying to loosen the ring. I went to the warm towel and saved it.

This is fabulous! I've made it so many times! It makes a wonderful presentation and it is delicious. Of couse I made some changes in the original recipe. Use 2/4 cups of orange juice and 1/4 cup lemon juice to balance the tartness. Your kids will love it!

This cake was somewhat easy to make - and it was great that it can be made ahead. Just remember to boil the gelatin mixture. I didn't, and it fell!!

This is a great recipe for spring or summer - tastes great, looks great, and is pretty easy to make. I've made it three times.
