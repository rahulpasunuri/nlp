Not sure why everyone loves this recipe. It's edible, but I would never make them again.

This is a good recipe, but when I tried to fry them, they completely fell apart. So, I baked the other half and it turned out well. I'm giving it 3 forks because although they are delicious, I'm not sure it's worth the effort.

This is a delicious variation on latkes. I always put the sauce in the food processor to make a smooth sauce. Everyone who has tried it has loved it!

These were pretty good but could use some more spice in the fritters. Increasing the cumin would help. I threw in some lemon juice to add some moisture to help it hold together, which worked nicely.

I used yukon gold potatoes and had no issues with the patties falling apart while frying. I made enough to freeze and keep eating throughout the week!

I have been making these every year since this recipe was published in 1996. They are a great twist on an old favorite and certainly spice up Hanukkah. The red bell pepper harissa is worth the work - you'll have plenty left over for sandwiches, dips, etc.

The flavor was excellent but they tended to fall apart while cooking.

I make these at least once a year, and they disappear fast! Instead of the harissa, I serve them with a sweet/spicy onion and pepper relish purchased from Harry & David. It really complements the dish nicely,

These fritters will be a part of every Hanukkah celebration! My family has renamed them "Felatkes". Kind of like a cross between felafel and latkes.

I made these when the recipe was first published in 1996. They were VERY tasty. My husband nicknamed them "falafelatkes" and asks for them every year!

I made this for a new's year's celebration. The harissa itself was excellent but my fritters kept falling apart. Tasty nonetheless.

Great alternative to latkes. The sauce was good!

The flavor was excellent, however I had trouble with the fritters falling apart in the oil. I'm going to refrigerate them before frying next time.

I made this recipe along with 2 other types of latkes for a group of people and this one was a big hit, particularly because of the Harissa sauce which everyone loved. Hint: don't try making them too thin, they'll fall apart.

It is an exciting recipe to make and to eat. Delicious on the hot side. Did not have to make any changes.

I came to this site specifically to look for this recipe. I made the entire dinner included in the 1996 issue, and found these fritters to be absolutely fabulous! They were easy to make, and less messy than latkes. Instead of the red pepper harissa, I substituted a red pepper chutney from a gourmet store. The slight sweetness of the chutney was a great compliment to the flavors of the fritter. I will be making these again this year.

This is very good, even if you don't typically like potatoes or garbanzo beans. The Harissa is also excellent, but the fritters can be eaten without it.
