The concept of pears infused with citrus and complemented with caramel sounds lovely, but this recipe fails to deliver that combination. The pears are beautiful, a lightly rosy color, but almost tasteless, and the caramel overpowers what little flavor they have. The time involved to pare and juice 4 oranges and a lemon, peel the pears and core (a step not mentioned in the procedure--are we to leave the seeds for diner to remove?), then make the sauce, which requires careful watching, is far more than the 30 minutes quoted. Active time was closer to 2 hours--not anything like what one would expect for poached pears. What would I change? I might try baking the pears with an orange glaze, or poaching in 1 cup juice, 1 cup water, 1/2 cup sugar. I would use a more traditional caramel sauce, and spice the nuts instead. I would not make it again as written, but would happily borrow the concept.

This was great. I brought it to a dinner party to accompany a pound cake. Served with vanilla ice cream. The pears and sauce would be a nice dessert on their own. I had some trouble initially with the sauce. My organic raw sugar just got really hard in the pan and didn't really melt. So I just added the heavy cream and cooked on low for longer, constantly stirring. It ended up being divine.

Loved this recipe, the pears were very good (I forgot the nuts somehow) and the sauce was amazing. Leftover sauce will definitely do well over ice cream or baked apples. While the whole pear presentation was elegant, it was actually less elegant and a b it of a challenge to eat; next time I will halve and core the pears before poaching. I love the idea of another reviewer to stain the poaching liquid and use to spark up a champagne cocktail! I also like the idea of adding some fleur de sel to the caramel sauce. A keeper recipe!

This is a wonderful recipe. Elegant and very delicious. I add a touch of salt which complements the ingredients well (similar to Fleur de Sel Caramels)

This was a delightful dessert that I served on Christmas. I overheated the caramel sauce but it ended up adding a richer flavor. The spicy flavor balanced the syrupy sweetness of the caramel. And this dish presents so well. I will definitely make this delicious dessert again! :)

This was a delicious dessert that I got many compliments on. I did as other reviewers suggested and combined the spices and cream ahead of time. I used toasted almonds, and it was good. However, I think that toasted hazelnuts would be even better.

Quickly becoming another Jenkins family favorite! The spices added to the caramel give it a rich depth, and leftovers go very well with vanilla ice cream. My next batch of homemade caramel candies will be similarly spiced. Strain the leftover poaching liquid and you're left with a thin, citrusy simple syrup. Fill champagne glasses just under halfway with the poaching liquid and the rest of the way with dry champagne for a great, fruity champagne cocktail.

This was such a yummy recipe, and as I was pouring the caramel sauce over the pears everyone got pretty excited. I took other reviewer's advice and infused the cream with the spices first. Since the caramel sets up so fast (faster than 10 minutes for me) I can't imagine that it would have time to soak up all those spicy flavors. Added star anise to the poaching mixture which was a nice addition. We're trying to figure out if there is something we can use that for after the fact. So yummy!

I would give this ten stars if I could. Amazing!!! We used seckel pears, toasted almonds and dark brown sugar. Apart from that we stayed true to the recipe. Simply the best dessert I ever made, and we had caramel left over and so made caramel apples with the rest of the spiced caramel, then rolled the apples in walnuts. Heaven!

It was a little tricky to make the sauce, keeping it hot enough to ensure the sugars remained dissolved while not so hot as to burn. Served at a dinner party for 6 and it went over very well. My only substitution was to use Bartlett pears.

this is fantastic, easy to make and great flavor. good with the sauce in the recipe or with a store-bought caramel. Looks gourmet, but easy to do.

Made this for my family & parents this evening. Everyone loved it. I didn't have whole cloves and cardamom on hand so I just added a tsp & 1/2 of 5spice which worked out really well - and no straining needed. I put the poaching liquid in canning jars and we plan to use it as a citrusy martini mixer. Will definitely make this again.

I made this today as a dessert for my class. My lecturer commented that it was the best dessert he had this month or from all the classes he tought. It was very simple to make. However, I did add some lemon and orange zest to the caramel sauce and it was great! It gave an unusual tinge on the tongue besides normal caramel sauce. I would certainly make it again.

Had this or very similar recipe at a B&B earlier this year. Even my fruit hating- ok he will eat apples- liked it. Elegant presentation and easy. Followed other reviewers idea of infusing cream with spices - seemed to make more sense than to strain hot caramel- worked well. I used smaller sized bosc pears and used it to dress up high quality store bought pound cake with a creme fraiche whipped cream.

I didn't try the caramel sauce yet, but the pears where awesome. A big hit.

This recipe is great but I hope everyone will read the reviews so that they'll know to USE LESS SUGAR WITH THE PEARS. I have found that 1/4 cup is great whether or not you're making the (scrumptuous) caramel sauce. Poached pears are a new favorite treat. Great way to work more fruit into your diet.

This recipe was a nice alternative to other poached pear recipes, which are usually in some kind of wine-based liquid. The citrus in this poaching liquid kept my house smelling good all afternoon. Like others said, this caramel goes fast, so don't walk away. The white sugar on top hadn't even melted by the time the bottom was deep golden--the whole thing melted as soon as I stirred. I felt that if I'd waited 5 more seconds, it would have burned. So, just keep an eye on this!

I burned the caramel on the first go around (watch carefully), but luckily I had plenty of time to redo. It was a smash hit. It looked and tasted fabulous! My guests have already asked me to make it again.

I had to add almost a cup of milk to keep it creamy. And what about simmering the spices in cream/milk before adding it to the caramel, would that make the flavors of the spices stand out a little more? I made this because I always poached pears in red wine and needed something new. I also tried a chocolate sauce so guests could pick. They loved this one. And it was my first time making caramel. I also loved it but thought it could be a little less sweet and more spicy.

Pears take much longer time if you want them to be tender unless initially quite ripe. I rewarmed the pears before serving, but they were also excellent as cold leftovers the next evening.

The whole family loved this dessert, including our 3 and 6 year old children. I substituted powdered cardamon for whole, using 1/8 teaspoon.

Ugh. I love caramel more than chocolate, and was really excited about this recipe - I was totally disappointed. The pear was bland, and the caramel was too spicey. What a waste of time!

My guests absolutely loved this. I particularly liked the way the orange flavour infused the pears and the decadance of the caramel. yum!! btw, I used mascarpone instead of heavy cream which was perfect as it followed risotto. highly recommended.

I think the pears are okay, but the caramel sauce is heavenly. The cardamon is not expensive if you buy it in bulk at an Indian food shop. I've used the sauce as a dip for fresh apples and pears, and as a topping for vanilla ice cream, the uses are endless. It's much easier to make using regular heavy cream, not ultra pastuirized.

I actually liked the slightly burned sugar taste of this sauce (reminded me of a plum pudding sauce my mother used to make). In fact, I think I will use this sauce as Christmas. I agree the spices could be stronger. The pears were delicious.

This was delicious. I slightly crushed the spices before adding them and let the sauce infuse for a few minutes before straining. The tastes really came through, especially the cardamom. As I am not fond of desserts that are too sweet, I used only half the sugar for the poaching syrup and it came out great. Garnished with mint leaves for final touch.

I give this dish 3.5 stars. I agree that the spices did not seem to do much for the dish - next time I will try crushing them - that should make a difference. Also, I used only 1/2 cup of heavy cream and one cup of half and half, and it turned out great. It certainly cuts the fat content down! I will try using even less heavy cream and more half and half next time to see if it works.

I made this recipe as a grand finale to a tea for 20. I hade to triple the recipe and it turned out great and recieved rave reviews. The only thing I didnt like was that all of the spices didnt seem to impart too much taste in the caramel and cardamon is wickedly expensive! The pears turned out great. I sprinkled mine with toasted crushed almonds. I would add more spices next time for sure.

I've made this twice and the sauce four times (I burnt it two times) and it always gets rave reviews from my guests. I don't actually like the spiced caramel sauce much and it's very easy to burn but I keep making it because I'm the only one who doesn't like it.

the only hairy part of this receipe is watching the caramel sauce so that it doesn't burn my company went wild for this dessert and it will definitely be repeated..besides it can be made in advance.
