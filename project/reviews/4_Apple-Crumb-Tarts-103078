The topping is just dust mixture of Flour etc... I would add a 3/4 Cup Water and 1& 1/4 Teaspoon baking powder... another 1/2 cup Brown Sugar --- split up between the topping and filling a Cinnimon mixture of 3 & 1/2 Tablspoons Cinnimon mixed to taste in 1&1/2 cup sugar and a pinch of nutmeg with a tblspoon Cornstarch stirred in... the water should be added after the dry ingreedients add the water to bring to either a Crumbling mix or a cake texture depending on your preference another thing is a tblspoon Lemon Juice to the Topping..I really didnt like the topping that this recipe used it was too powdery...

This recipe made a great tart. It is similar to the apple betty recipe I used on this site, but much prettier and tastier! This recipe is really easy and showcases the great apple flavor. I didn't use any spices because I wanted to make sure the apples (not to mention the butter!) really shined through.

Outstanding! Based on other reviews, used Granny Smith apples, added 2T of cinnamon to the apples, and used 1 cup of oatmeal ground in a food processor instead of the breadcrumbs.

This is delicious. Was a tad dry so I'll add more lemon or apple juice and flour next time. I used oats ground in the processor instead of breadcrumbs. Looks great too.

Outstanding! My favorite new apple dessert. I added a hint of cinnamon to the filling, but otherwise love it as is! Rave reviews from my guests.

Absolutely delicious! The only change I made was using Granny Smith apples to make this a sweet tart desert. I've made it 4 times already and continue to get requests for more.

Has a light delicate flavor as contrasted to the heavier flavors of the cinnamon-apple pie spices. The crust is going to be a favorite of mine-both for flavor and ease of making. I would recommend painting the crust with melted apricot jam before adding the apple mixture to keep the crust from becoming soggy-also the use of pie weights during the blind baking step.Definately a keeper.
