I've made this salad twice, once with baby eggplant and once with regular sized eggplant just as written. I made it a few hours ahead and served it at room temperature. So simple and delicious! Everyone loves it!

Wow. I am not an eggplant fan, but felt challenged by my CSA to use one up. This was delicious. I used lime instead of lemon, and served at room temp. Really, really good. Will definitely make again.

Made this as part of a Sept Barbeque. Menu included Ribs, Spicy Grilled Shrimp, Potato Salad. Looks good and tastes good. Easy to make, too.

This was even more delicious than I'd hoped. The amt. of dressing is right for one eggplant. There was enough dressing on the bottom of the platter for soaking up with a good country French bread. I waited until the eggplant was cool before scattering the basil leaves over it on the plate. I also scattered about a cup of diced tomato over it for more color because everything in the meal was mainly brown. This end-of-summer Jersey tomato added another dimension of flavor too. Beautiful and delicious. Fresh mozzarella slices on the same platter made this a main course.

This dish is excellent! It is perfect for a party or for a simple, yet exquisite, side dish. Prep was easy, but I cut back a bit on the oil. There wasn't much dressing to "toss", so I put the slices in a ziploc and worked it on. Cut back a few minutes on the broiling as well. Just excellent all-over flavor! A bit hit!

Love this recipe! I have made it several times to rave reviews. Top it with crumbled goat cheese. YUMMY!

I really liked this recipe - though I think I put a little too much dressing on my eggplant. The dressing was a little lemony, I'll use less the next time around. I think it would be just as good served warm as at room temperature. I will definitely make it again, a new and tasty way to prepare eggplant!

I love eggplant, especially when it's not fried, & this is now my favorite way to prepare it. I served it to a group of friends & even the eggplant-avoiders loved it. I also doubled the dressing, reserving about 1/3 cup for drizzling. I think brushing on the dressing before broiling might be simpler than mixing it with the eggplant slices.

The vinaigrette is excellent . . . try with grilled shrimp! However, the eggplant salad itself is rather uninteresting. There ARE better uses for eggplant.

Really easy to prepare. Didn't use pine nuts, but added roasted red, orange and yellow peppers for flavor variety. The colors looked so bright and pretty. Next time might add sauteed portabella mushrooms. Definitely double the sauce for two eggplants.

I've made this recipe a number of times, and have always had rave reviews, even from people who claim that they don't like eggplant. In fact, I've had guests fight over the last few pieces.

This was very tasty. I liked the pine nuts.

This dressing is so good. Instead of tossing the eggplant, I brushed the dressing on and grilled the eggplant. I layered the eggplant on a plate with heirloom tomatoes and roasted peppers, and then sprinkled some goat cheese on top. Served with good bread and it's a meal loved by all!

I liked this but my family did not. The marinade/dressing is wonderfully vibrant tasting.

Wonderful recipe - tastes delicious and presents well. I also used dried basil, and was pleased. Even my mother in law liked it - doesn't get much better that that, does it?

Got rave reviews at a wedding shower. I doubled the receipe for the dressing, and it was sufficient. Took about 1 hour start to finish, all active time.

This may be the best eggplant recipe I know, and I know a LOT of them because I love eggplant and cook it probably once a week. I made it as part of my Easter dinner, and didn't have fresh basil, so I used dried. That seems like a major substitution, but it was mouth-watering good. I am making it again tonight as a main course for my vegetarian son who is visiting. Maybe with just three of us eating, we will have some left over.

fantastic. totally easy, and crazy good. the only complaint i had was that the dressing was a bit salty. i also only had one eggplant on hand, and the amount of dressing seemed to be just enough, so i'd probably make more of that if i used two eggplants. i would even eat this as a main with some greens on the side.

I almost gave it a 4 because of how easy it is. Not only is this dish simple and tasty but it SO pretty! After I drizzled the dressing and tossed on the nuts, I wanted to take a picture of the plate!

This was delicious - probably 3 forks in terms of taste and I gave it four because it was so easy to prepare. I had only one eggplant on hand, but used almost all the dressing. It may not have been enough dressing for 2 eggplants. My eggplant-hating husband had thirds. I'll make it for a buffet for 100 I need to do next month.

My family loved this dish. I will definitely make it again!

More than fabulous!!!! The sauce is the answer to what to do with vegetables. I make many batches and freeze to enjoy the fresh basil flavor year round (decrease salt). The sauce, the sauce, the sauce!!! It is incredible on fish and vegetables.
