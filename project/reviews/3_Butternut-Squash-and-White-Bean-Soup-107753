I used dried white beans; prepared them with 2 cloves garlic and bay leaf; added bouillon to their water near end of their cooking; started main pot with bacon; took it out, threw some butter in, sauted onions & garlic; added beans and their water and canned tomatoes; roasted the butternut till browned and added it, threw in some cheese rinds and some summer savoury (didn't have sage), cooked for about 10 minutes, and, having removed cheese rinds, am now pureeing all but bacon bits, pumpkin seeds and parsley, which I'll add as garnish. It's going to be good - but all those extras give it the flavour.

Easy to make and very healthy. As written, only 3 stars, because the flavors are ok, but nothing special. I've tried it 3 times (first time as written) and have finally made a couple tweaks that made a big difference. I saved time and used frozen cubed squash and threw it in the oven till it started to darken. While it was browning, I sauteed two shallots in my pot, adding the garlic at the end. The combination of lightly browned shallot and squash gave it a much richer flavor depth that added a lot. I also doubled the sage and was heavy handed with the tomato for some extra acid.

This was exactly what I thought I was looking for, but I really did not care for it. I found it bland, and the texture coarse. I ended up putting it through a strainer and liked the smoother results better, but I will not bother to make again.

This soup was fast and easy to make, and the results were surprisingly great. I blended about 3/4 of the soup, so it had a comforting, creamy flavor. I also added some quinoa for some crunch.

My husband and I both thought it was delicious and not lacking in flavor at all! The only changes I made were using fresh roma tomatoes, "better than boullion" instant vegetarian "chicken" broth and dried beans that I'd cooked before starting the recipe (added 1 or 2 tsp salt to compensate). Also, instead of adding grated parm, I threw in some cheese rinds with the beans, etc, and just grated the cheese over the soup at the end. Like many others, I pureed about half the ingredients. Forgot to do the pumpkin seeds, served with veggie sausage. Great fall meal!

I made this recipe exactly as written. It was just okay. Not much depth in the flavors. Probably won't make it again

This was good, the flavors were solid and it was pretty satisfying. I ended up pureeing half of the batch and mixing it in to make it more creamy. I'll try it again with all broth and some of the modifications mentioned by other reviewers. I do have to say that my 10 month old loves this (lightly pureed) and I feel great giving it to her - very healthy.

I achieved a rich delicious taste to this soup with very little alteration to the recipe. I wonder if the result was in part due to using dried legumes (baby lima beans) and replacing the water called for in the recipe with the cooking liquid from the beans (although only half). I also doubled the recipe, using a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes but less than a 1/3 cup of Parmesan cheese. (I sprinkled more on top of each serving.) The only addiion to the spices was cracked pepper, a sprinkle of crushed red chile peppers,and thyme. The result was a soup that retained the distinct flavors of all the vegetables while harmonizing them beautifully.

This soup is okay, but nothing spectacular. I added some hot sauce to my bowl before eating for a kick. I also added about a cup of coconut milk to make the broth barely creamy. I don't think it was enough to add flavor. I would probably leave the tomatoes out if I made a version of this again. I also added corn toward the end of cooking; nice crunchy texture and sweetness. In fact, it might make more of a nice chowder if I upped the milk or cream and added more corn. I just thought of adding shrimp...interesting. I would probably try a seasoning other than sage. Maybe just salt and pepper. And mash everything a little more, maybe puree part of it. I used 4 cups vegetable bouillion instead of chicken broth, no water. Sauteed the garlic with diced yellow onion also. I mashed up the vegetables a little for rough chunks while it simmered. I seasoned with dried sage and a little salt and pepper. Did not use pumpkin seeds, but I bet they would be really good now that I've had this.

This is my go-to soup recipe. Every time I make it people love it (and I do too)! After cooking I puree it all with an immersion blender. Use all stock, no water to enhance the flavor. I also add rosemary.

Rating: 3
Very good, though I made some substitutions based on what I had on hand. Doubled the recipe (except kept oil at 2 T), roasted the squash first, subbed 1 tsp. dried thyme, all stock instead of water, peeled red potatoes instead of beans, and no cheese. Also added a sprig of fresh rosemary to lightly infuse the soup then fished out later. I oversalted a tad and added less than of cup of milk to make up for it in the end. Served with a sausage, carmelized onion, and goat cheese pizza (no red sauce). Turned out great - obviously a soup that can be tailored to what you have on hand. I imagine it would be great with sage and beans as written - will try next time!

This soup was incredible! It made too much for 2 people and it was just as good as leftovers. I think we had 5 servings at least.

Great use of a butternut squash! I roasted the squash alone, then pureed and added it to the already simmering broth mix (I also added a sauteed onion, as the reviewer below did). Very tasty.

Rating: 4
We loved this. I did make some changes. I added an onion in the beginning, did not add the fresh sage but instead added some marjoram, rosemary, thyme and savory when sauteeing the garlic and onion in the beginning. I used S&W brand seasoned white beans and 1 can of diced chopped tomatoes. I pureed most of the mixture leaving some chunks and then added some more tomatoes and beans after I pureed it so there would be some texture. I did not add the cheese but just served it on top. The pumpkin seeds were EXCELLENT and well worth the effort. Great soup!

I made this recipe for my book group and they loved it [as did my 9YO daughter!]. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth to be vegetarian friendly, and it worked out great. Loved the pumpkin seeds. Will definitely make again!

This recipe has become a staple for me. It doesn't have many ingredients or require a lot of cooking time, but is really delicious. It's fine on its own but I get better flavor using a fresh tomato instead of canned, and all broth instead of broth and water. It also tastes good with some fresh thyme.

I added a few rehydrated sundried tomatoes that I chopped fine and also a tablespoon of lemon juice. It lifted the soup nicely.

Rating: 3
Used a squash I got from the local farmer's market, not sure what kind it is. Also used a drained can of diced tomatoes instead of going to the effort of chopping up whole canned tomatoes. The soup is a nice, easy, quick, and healthy one. Sweet from the squash, hearty from the beans. Next time I'll add more beans, though.

Rating: 3
I did not have any problems with the cheese clumping either... it just needs to be added gradually. I also added a parmesan rind and removed before serving. Added quite a bit more pepper and a dash of nutmeg which added to the flavor a lot. Will definately make this one again we all loved it.

Rating: 4
To the previous rater, regarding the cheese clumping - I do have a suggestion. At it slowly, a shake or two at a time, and blend as you're adding. If you pour in the cheese all at once and then stir, you're likely to get clumps. On that note... this is a delicious recipe - very healthy and light. I wouldn't change a thing! This has become a staple for me - make it all the time.

Rating: 2
This seemed promising, until I added the cheese and it formed big sticky clumps in the soup, which then had to be picked out. Not sure if I should have let it cool more (I did remove from heat as instructed) and/or stir it in VERY slowly. Anyone else have this problem?

Rating: 4
I made this as instructed, but pureed about 1/3 of the soup after it was done cooking. And served with shaved parm. A hit.

Rating: 3
Very good! Had a surprising amount of flavor--loved the combination of creamy beans, sweet pumpkin, and autumnal sage. I thought the toasted pumpkin seeds was a delicious and unusual addition. Just a few suggestions: to enhance the butternut squash's natural sweetness, try this: Heat 1T olive oil in a pan over med-high heat until quite hot. Add all the squash pieces and cook (without stirring) about 5 minutes, until nicely browned on one side. You can stir them a bit and brown more sides, or just add them to the soup at this point. As far as liquids, I used just 1 cup veg broth, and then added enough water to almost cover the vegetables. I also added 1 small shallot with the garlic to increase the savoriness.

Rating: 3
As others suggested I added a few things: cumin, cayenne, onion. I upped the garlic and just used chicken broth and added the sage while sauteeing the onion and garlic. It was delicious, easy, and a definate will make again. Wonderfully filling.

Rating: 4
Wonderful! I'll be using this recipe a couple times a month during the winter. It's easy, healthy, and delicious. I added half of small onion (minced), and sauteed it with the garlic and sage, as well as four minced sliced of "fake bacon" (Morning Star Farms, comes frozen). I used a whole delicata squash, half of a butternut squash, and omitted the tomatoes. I simmered the soup until the squash was melt-in-your-mouth consistency. My family and I loved it! (Including my 7 year old and 3 year old!)

I made a huge pot of this soup for a New Year's Day party - used fresh tomatoes, added cumin and shallots as a couple of people had suggested, and got raves all around and people asking for the recipe. A helpful tip - you can use an immersion blender to blend and thicken soups like this. It makes it very easy and neat.

This was fantastic; would definitely make it again. The blend of beans and butternut squash was creamy-smooth, with a hint of sweetness from the squash. Fresh sage from my garden...mmmmm..

I say I would make this again, but I would have to add a few more ingredients to give it more flavor. I thought it was kind of bland and watery. I followed the directions and my version looked nothing like the picture. I think onions would go a long way to giving it more flavor and I might roast at least some of the butternut squash.

As it is (minus tomato) it's very good, fast, and easy! Val's Friendly Version: I made it without the tomato. Added ~ 3 tblsp minced onion with 2 minced garlic cloves, and 1 heaping tbsp fresh sage to the end of the browning of the garlic and onions - about 15 sec. I used a whole butternut(3-4 cups cubed)and added cooked chunks of baked ham to the simmering process(imagining that cooked chicken, turkey, or smoked sausage would be good too). Then added 2, 15 oz cans of beans AFTER I cooked and mashed a good portion of the squash. Used the same liquid measurements. When I first tasted I thought it was 'bright' and very good - but kindly could be better! So I added 3/4 - 1 tsp ground cumin and cayenne peppered to taste. Wow! This made a huge difference! Was it ever great and that was the FIRST day! Respectfully, 4 forks for the revised version. Yippeee-yummeee!

OK, first thing to know is that it's two tomatoes, not two cans of tamatoes ... looks like there may have been some confusion. And, actually, I used fresh tomato, and I think I'd recommend that (if you use tomato). I took Val up on her advice and fudged it a bit with some shallotes, upped to 2 cloves garlic, too, and also sauteed the sage a bit as she recommended. Oh! And I also added cumin at the end as suggested ... yum. Thought it tasted fresh and rich. Definitely going in my recipe box.

This makes a great vegetarian soup if you used veggie stock. I was confused by whether the recipe intended for two cans of tomatoes or two tomatoes; we just used one can of diced tomatoes and a little more squash than called for and it turned out great!

The recipe for Tuscan White Bean, Chicken, And Pumpkin Soup is much, much, much, better.P.S.--The recipe for Tuscan, white Bean, Chicken, and Pumpkin Soup calls for Turkey, and can be found on "butterball.com. I make it quite often in the colder months.

This is really a vegetable soup which happens to include squash. The tomato flavors overpower the gentle taste of the squash. A better recipe would enhance the flavor of the butternut squash. I do not plan to make this again, but were I to do so I would omit the tomatos entirely.

This was a wonderful soup that delighted two teenagers and my husband. I added some chopped onion and almost twice the squash and we all wished that there was more when we finished it the next day. Also, it got better the second day! Very delicious and low fat too!

My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this soup. It was easy to make and delicious. To reduce prep time, I used canned diced tomatoes instead of whole. Good homemade stock pulled all the flavors together. I also went crazy with a potato masher, mashing all of the butternut squash and much of the other ingredients to a near puree. The pumpkin seeds were a nice addition for crunch and color, but not a must. The soup easily passed the critical test of tasting fabulous soaked into crusty French bread. And a lovely Pinot Noir rounded out this tasty light dinner.
