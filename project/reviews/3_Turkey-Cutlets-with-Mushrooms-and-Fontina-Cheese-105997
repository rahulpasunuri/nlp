This is wonderful and easy to make. I omitted the allspice and used a cheddar and jack cheese combination. The sauce was perfect!

Our family has been enjoying this recipe for years and everyone always loves it. We found we like to double the amount of mushrooms because they are so delicious in this sauce. We found it is great to make this dish ahead of time and leaving it in the fridge prior to baking. When we are ready, we take it out of the fridge and throw in the over. Serve with mashed potatoes -- a must!

I agree that the thyme and allspice were too overpowering. If I do make it again I would use much less.

I really liked this. I used Italian cheeses instead of fontina, and sherry instead of wine (didn't have white on hand) delicious. I didn't find it runny.

Tasty, yet time consuming. If you make this ahead and refrigerate it, it will take far longer than 10 minutes to heat through and melt the cheese. I had it sitting at room temperature for about half an hour before baking and it took about twenty minutes for the cheese to even begin to melt, whihc unfortunately overcooked the turkey cutlets. The allspice gave it a kind of strange flavoring, so I'd leave that out next time.

This is a very nice recipe for a weeknight. I used chicken breasts and instead of thyme used tarragon...I just think it is a better flavor match with the allspice. Also, I didn't use all the chicken broth, just 1/2 cup and so the sauce was not as runny. The family liked this recipe very much and I will make it again.

My friend made this for me after the birth of my daughter (now 7), and I've been making it ever since. (It's a great do-ahead dish!) The only thing we do differently is add a bag of baby spinach: once the sauce is ready, pour half of it over the cutlets and then wilt the spinach in the remaining sauce & spoon over cutlets. Looking forward to it for dinner tonight...

Made this last night and it turned out WAY too soupy. The sauce did not thicken properly. Could this be because I subbed Portobello for the Shittaki mushroooms? The taste was very good, even though the cutlets and cheese wound up buried under the sauce. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

This was great! My husband and I both loved it. I used dried thyme, and that flavor was a bit strong - so maybe next time I'll try fresh. It was easy, and just totally delicious. I served this with roasted red potatoes (olive oil, garlic, & rosemary) and steamed asparagus (in chix broth and Tarragon) - and the combo of flavors and spices was excellent. This is a keeper!

This was delicious! It wasn't hard to make, but it tasted like I slaved in the kitchen all day! I'm sharing this recipe with all of my family and friends!

My family did not like this at all. The flavors just didn't seem to go together.

I did not want to rate this because I did not follow the exact recipe, but I did want to comment that the proportions are perfect, and very adaptable to other cheeses and poultry. I used thin sliced chicken breast and mozzerella, but otherwise followed the recipe. Only other change I might make is to use regular (not pounded or thin sliced) poultry, as it was easy to overcook these, what with the sauteeing AND baking. Overall, a really, really good recipe, and one that I would make again and agian. Served with parmesan rice, but will try mashed potatoes next time to soak up more of the wonderful sauce.

My husband LOVED this dish, but I wasn't that crazy about it. (My husband declared it "good enough for guests.") I really didn't like the next day's leftovers--the allspice flavor overpowered everything else after a night in the fridge.

My family really enjoyed this recipe and it was very easy to make. I added more mushrooms to the sauce and it was fab!!!

My family didn't care for the turkey taste even though I thought it tasted same as chicken but I will try chicken next time. I had some leftover Asiago cheese so I threw that on there instead and did away with the allspice- still very yummy.

Nice recipe... I used Feta cheese instead of the Fontina.. Very tasty dish and easy to prepare ahead.

This dish is has some promise. I didn't care for the allspice flavor, so I will leave it out next time. The mushroom sauce is very tasty.
