Delicious and simple. I usually make Creme Fraiche without Vanilla Beans, but it works well for sweet applications of creme fraiche. Do not skip the stirring steps, they're crucial! happy souring!

Delish! Reminiscent of the wonderful creme fraiche found in rural France. I will definitely keep this recipe within easy reach!
