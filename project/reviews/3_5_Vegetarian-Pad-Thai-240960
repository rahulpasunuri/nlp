I make this vegan by omitting the eggs (and subsequently, it cuts back on the amount of oil you need to use). This is a delicious recipe that rivals many take out pad thais.

Really great recipe! Everyone loved it. The only thing I would change is to cut the tofu into much smaller pieces, it was pretty dry. Other than that, just delicious!

I made this recipe exactly as it is written. I found it to be much too bitter. The tamarind was overpowering all the other flavors in the dish and I believe causing the bitterness. I like tamarind, but would reduce the amount to 1 tablespoon - or less. The fried shallots were disappointing as well - they were very bland. They would have been better with a little seasoning - as well as the tofu. I will not make this recipe again.

I like my pad thai a bit sweeter, so I used about 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup of brown sugar.

This was great! I love pad Thai and I've tried making it at home before but I guess it's the tamarind that makes the difference which I did not use in previous attempts. I only used 2 Tbsp of oil in my version though and I skipped frying the shallots (that's not authentic anyway) and just threw them all in with the scallions. My one criticism is that I could not tell the difference between the eggs and the tofu in the finished product, so much so that when I said that to my husband he said "There are eggs in this?" I know eggs are traditional in pad Thai but next time I will skip them and make it vegan.

This was. Amazing. AMAZING. Although I guess I didn't do the part with the shallot oil. Even without that it was incredible. I also couldn't find tamarind so I made a substitute by reducing pure pomegranent with lime juice and a couple dates. Asides from that I followed it exactly and I will probably make it again (which must make it great, because I never make the same thing twice).

Pad thai seems simple enough but this was kind of time consuming. Nothing hard, but just a lot of prep work. Definitely worth it it though. Very delicious.I followed the recipe exactly.

Rating: 4
This was terrific, though I did make a few changes which made it non-vegetarian. For the sauce, I couldn't find Tamarind Paste, just a liquid concentrate. I used about 1/2 cup of that and mixed in another 1/4 cup of water. I also added 2 tablespoons of fish sauce to this, which I think gives it a little depth. For the noodle saute, I added minced ginger to the garlic, and sauteed half of this mix with the tofu, then half with a sliced chicken breast, and used just 3 eggs. I say saute because I came nowhere near the 1 1/2 cups of oil, that sounded insane! Instead, I just used 1-2 tablespoons for each step of sauteeing. To serve, I just placed the sprouts, some shredded carrots, and cilantro on the side of the noodles, and then sprinkled with the peanuts and green onions. While this did seem a little labor intensive, the end result was way better than many of the Thai places in my unhip neck of the woods, so I will definitely make this again!

Beware or modify. This is not a vegetarian dish. It contains EGGS! So why does the recipe say it is vegetarian? Curious.

Rating: 3
Interesting flavor combination. We don't have any Thai restaurants or speciality markets in our area so it was a project collecting the ingredients. I'm glad I followed the recipe, although I could not use the crispy shallots they were burnt and bitter. This did not have an effect on the rest of the recipe. The only other tweek I made was 1/2 less sriracha. I made this for my kids and they were at least willing to try the dish. This is a success because they are very picky eaters. My husband and I really thought the dish was well balanced, delicious and a treat from the ordinary.

Rating: 4
This recipe tasted wonderful! Rave reviews from the friends. With prep and cooking, it definitely takes more than 1 hour. I cut back the oil to 1 cup and threw in some carrots, but followed the other directions exactly. You might skip making the crispy shallots? Mine didn't crisp that well and I'm not sure it added enough flavor to the dish to justify that step.

Rating: 0
I had to modify the heck out of this because I forgot I threw out my old tamarind block and I didn't have ground peanuts. My bean sprouts went bad, too. And I had no shallots. And no wok. So...fresh squeezed orange with some lemon and some extra brown sugar, plus julienned carrots in place of sprouts, plus slivered onion in place of shallot, plus half a cup of chunky peanut butter added to the sauce in a well-seasoned cast iron skillet, and holy cow. Yum. This recipe appears bomb proof. Read a couple former asian restaurant cooks on a forum say that you can keep rice noodles from clumping by soaking them in tepid water for about 10 minutes and throwing them in the pan still barely flexible. I'll try that next time. Mine clump.

Rating: 4
Loved this recipe. Slightly labor intensive, but worth it. I did use less oil then called for and added more veggies, I shoe-string cut carrots and blanched them ahead, then threw them in with bok choy at the stage you add the scallions. I also used 4 eggs and not six, and it was perfect. My guest were raving that it was the best Pad Thai they have had. The health food coop had the tamarind in a frozen paste for 99¢ - and it worked perfect and not need to strain!

Rating: 3
Very good with a couple changes: added julienned carrots, added chilies (instead/addition to sriracha), 1/2 eggs. Good flavor, & I would not sub the tamarind for anything else, it was easy to get at an Asian specialty store nearby or even order online.

Difficult to make but worth the journey. Best pad thai I have ever had. Truly makes 6 servings but is also good reheated the next day. I might dial down garlic and maybe dial up Sriracha next time. First time I have used tamarind from the block... tastes great.

I have made this recipe about 4 times now. There are a lot of steps to it... so give yourself some time to prepare. I actually make my own tamarind instead of buying it. Grind equal parts dried apricot, dried prunes, dried dates with some lemon juice... only add enough lemon juice to make a paste. I would say this recipe is missing a thicker sauce. maybe a little coconut milk would help.

My boyfriend and I are vegetarians and he LOVES Pad Thai. It's hard for us to find vegetarian Pad Thai so I made this recipe. It was awesome! The only changes I made to this recipe were to use less oil and I added Thai chillies because we like things very spicy. I also didn't use eggs because we don't eat them. It is not necessary to use all the shallot oil, but it is very nice to make the shallot oil and have the crispy fried shallots as a garnish. I loved those! I would suggest following the recipe for the sauce using actual tamarind. It really isn't hard to make the sauce and the fruit pushes through the sieve really well. My boyfriend told me I have to make this at least once a week now! :-)

Rating: 0
I've made this many times now. Delicious! My only change is the amount of oil. The 1.5c at the beginning would only be necessary if you have a very wide wok. Otherwise, 1c or less is enough to cover the tofu. At the end, 6T will leave your dish oily, so reduce to 4-5T. I usually also increase the amount of sriracha for a kick

Rating: 4
Incredible! Not being familiar with Thai cooking, I followed the recipe nearly exactly - only adding a bit of chopped ginger with the garlic and a T of fish sauce to the sauce. I sub'd out Nama Shoyu for the soy sauce and also added some carrots and onions to the veg saute. Could use some broccoli and even a bit more sauce for reheating the leftovers. I only had about a T of peanut oil so used mostly canola oil with a splash of sesame oil. and add more peppers if you want spice! And definitely top with plenty of fresh lime and cilantro. YUM!

I did not try this recipe but I cook Padthai a lot. I choose a very firm, hard toful, cut it very small, pad dry and bake it in toaster oven, until crispy. In Thailand, the tofu they use are mostly deep fried or very very dry. The original version of Padthai sauce doesn't call for Siracha chile sauce. Made sauce ahead and keep in refrigurature, last more than a month. This way, you can just soak noodle and stire fry with any veggies you have in kitchen but never skip roasted peanut and lime and if you love spicy add chili flakes before serving.

This dish was fantastic, but it's a bit time-consuming. You could eliminate the fried shallots and not lose to much, imho. Also, I found tamarind paste and you need use only a teaspoon or two to get the flavor you need.

Rating: 3
We liked this at first... got a nice kick at the beginning... But the second time round, I was disappointed with how greasy it was and I only used about half the oil. Next time, I'll skip oiling up the wok every time, say "no" to the tofu, and maybe toss in a few other veggies or make a side of something. We'll try it again with less eggs and go back to the chicken/shrimp theme... and way, way less oil. We also used about a tsp of Tamarind Concentrate.

Rating: 2
It's decent but not what I was hoping. I've made it three times and and while it makes decent comfort food it's never really blown me away. If you are going to make it be sure to add some more veggies to it (peppers, snow peas, carrots).

Our Daughtor loves Pad Thai and said it was as good as any she has ordered out. We used chicken, halfed the eggs and Sriracha. We also used tamarind concentrate and 1 Tablespoon of fish sauce for the sauce. And like the other reviewers comments we used 3/4cup of peanut oil and that was plenty.

Rating: 4
This recipe makes enough to feed 6 well so ignore the 4-6 it says it serves. Mise en plas is a must for this as you need everything organized ahead of time for very quick cooking intervals as to not overcook parts. Those complaining about mushy noodles etc. have overcooked them. Tamarind is lightly sweet and slightly bitter so if you can't get to a health food store or Asian specialty store in your area your best bet is trying to create a sort of syrup with those flavor profiles. Easy way- 2 tbsp molasses 1 tbsp rice vinegar (regular vinegar works but will be more pungent). Allows you to skip the whole boiling water straining etc step. If you are not vegetarian. 2tbsp molasses 1/2 tbsp vinegar 1/2 tbsp fish sauce I've found to be a tad better. Harder way- Dates and lemon juice. Tamarind are actually Indian dates so you are essentially doing the same thing and just bittering them up a bit with lemon juice. Change up this recipe by using rice vermicelli noodles making it Pad Woon Sen

Rating: 4
Wow! Yum! I have made other Pad Thai recipes before, but this was awesome. Turned out I didn't have tamarind, so I used lime juice instead. Otherwise made it just as suggested plus added steamed broccoli at the end. I loved that it was spicy. Most Pad Thai I have had was not as spicy, which is why this one was great. The recipe makes a large quantity. We cut it in half and had enough for 4 servings.

Rating: 4
It`s tastes like restaurant pad thai, which was an important factor for me. I made it for a group, and even those who had never heard of pad thai were going nuts. It was all gone!! A tip for reheating: Undercook the noodles a bit, and it actually reheats quite well in a crock pot - believe it or not!

This recipe is the bomb!!! Just difficult...but it's okay cause I enjoy a good challenge. I've made it 3 or 4 times now so I know what I'm getting myself into. This recipe is fun to do as a team.

Awesome! My husband applauded me at the dinner table. I made all the sauce (although I used only one tablespoon of Sriracha) but pretty much cut everything else in half. Like other reviewers I added mushrooms and snow peas, cut in strips. But I cooked every element separately and combined it all at the end to avoid the "steamed, mushy" consistency, and used much less oil in the process. I also used small banh pho (forgot about the 1/4 inch designation when I was standing in front of the store display) and think they were probably easier to handle and keep from sticking together. Not a fast recipe, but one I look forward to making again!

I usually like recipes from epicurious but this one let me down - after more than an hour of prep and cooking time, this dish tasted terrible. Rice noodles disintegrated and sauce did not have the correct "pad thai" flavor or consistency. The final product was watery and bland. I will not be making this again.

This was a good dish! I hadn't used tamarind before, so I was excited to try it in the sauce--it's really good! The recipe is a bit fussy and time consuming, and I'm sure I'll try to streamline it bit next time I try it. I must have overcooked the noodles, too, because they somewhat disintegrated during the last stir fry part...but it still tasted great =)

The only word to describe this was "excellent". It had a very authentic flavor and was not too peanut-y, which I find sometimes happens with pad thai in restaurants. My only suggestions would be to add more vegetables (I added mushrooms, carrots, and red peppers) and to double the sauce.

Very good recipe. I never have tamarind on hand so I just use fresh lemon or lime juice. I also stir in chopped cilantro right before serving. And don't do all the switching in the pan. And it still came out great. The tofu is easy to switch out for shrimp too.

This is funny... I'm a vegetarian and this is ALWAYS how I make pad thai! However, I usually like to add some veggies and tofu to make it a whole meal. I like carrots, sugar snap peas, peppers, and red cabbage... and onions, with the tofu. But I really think this is a great dish... I might make it for dinner, unless there is something else I need to get rid of.

Was looking for something different when my vegetarian friends were over and decided to try my hand at pad thai. I'm so glad I did- I made this for 10 and everyone raved!! Even at the H Mart, I was unable to find tamarind in block, so I used the paste, and it came out fine. I also used less Sriracha (didn't measure it, but approx 1 tbsp or so), otherwise followed the recipe fairly closely. The dish requires a bit of effort but is well worth it!

Rating: 4
OUT OF SIGHT! I made this without the shallots (I didn't have any) and it was fantastic. I also used more peanuts, close to 1 cup. Delicious. Next time I make it, I'll cut the Sriracha to 1 tablespoon and put the Sriracha on the table for those who like it hotter. My kids love Pad Thai and will generally eat anything with fried tofu in it but thought this was too hot. A good recipe for company- it makes a ton of food. Really tasty.

Excellent recipe. The tamarind and Sriracha are a must! I used tamarind from a block, and yes, it's a pain, but worth it. I substituted a yellow onion for the scallions and shallots, didn't bother with transferring things in and out of the pan, which sped things up. I will make this again!

Very good, but way too complicated as written. I cut down on the oil and just sauteed the ingredients in the order directed, taking them out with a slotted spoon and putting in the next one. Tamarind seems essential to making this taste authentic.

I made this with chicken breast instead of tofu. I also had tamarind paste, so I didn't need to soak beans, etc. I just added it to the hot water. Being short on time, I only soaked the rice noodles for the duration of putting the rest of the ingredients together, and it worked out great. I didn't fuss with the cooking of things separately either; I sauteed the onions & garlic together, then I cooked the egg with it, and added the sauce etc. If I had the time, I would separate it though, for presentation purposes. My family really liked it too, so it's definitely in my recipe box now!

I have tried many Pad Thai recipes and this one was the best by far. I still have tweaking to do, but it certainly turned out closer than other recipes I've tried. I agree the vegetable oil seemed a lot. I sauteed the shallots until crisp in a healthy amount of oil, then sauteed the shrimp and tofu in the same oil. Next time I'll try to bake the tofu as one person suggested. I could not find Tamarind paste or block in my small town, so I researched and discovered Worchestershire sauce has tamarind in it as one of its main ingredients. As we like Worchestershire here, I substituted a mixture of 3 Tbsp Worchestershire and 1 Tbsp lime. I'm looking forward to trying this recipe with tamarind.

Rating: 3
I'm still working on the prefect Pad Thai but this one is a good starting point. Agree that this one is a bit over complicated and there is no need to waste 1 1/2 cups of vegetable oil. I just sautéd the shallots in a little oil and then the tofu in a bit more and then some shrimp. Like many I used tamarind paste instead of pulp from a block. Also added a little fish sauce. Good but still not perfect!

Rating: 4
This recipe is great and full of useful info, like how to handle rice noodles correctly. However, I made some changes: 1) I wasn't able to find the block tamarind, and honestly, straining and sieving sounded annoying anyway, so I just used tamarind paste. Worked fine. 2) Shallots are super expensive right now, so I used yellow onions and bumped up the garlic by a few cloves. It tasted great. 3) I cut well-drained tofu into small chunks and baked it until golden, bubbly, and chewy the night before making this. Then, rather than standing in front of a wok for 20 minutes waiting for tofu to cook, I was able to just toss the baked tofu into the mix. 4) I did everything in the cooking directions as directed, but when it came time to add the noodles to the wok, I divided the scallion/garlic mix in half, set half aside, and only cooked half the noodles at a time. This helped keep everything hot and moving and well-seared without turning into a glue-y blob. I also only drizzled on enough of the sauce to stain all the noodles, not the full amount called for by the recipe. Too much sauce in the wok made one portion of the recipe wet and sticky, and that's not right for pad thai. I suggest using tongs to pull the noodles through the sauce and coat them quickly. 5) Did I mention I added 1 tbsp sriracha to the recipe? That stuff rules. Lastly, because I feel the recipe doesn't emphasize this enough, keep that wok smoking crazy-town hot. It's not going to taste like your favorite take out if it's all steaming instead of searing.

Excellent taste but fussy as written. Used one tablespoon of the chili sauce and that was plenty.

I have made this recipe several times; it's great but unnecessarily complicated. The shallot oil is unnecessary. Just halve the shallots and add them to the stir fry at the end, then use regular oil. The sauce was a little bland for some reason. I added some extra sugar, which helped.

We used about 1/2 cup oil and couldn't find tamarind close by (we used some lemon juice instead), but this recipe tasted fresh and delicious. It was great for "date" cooking. Truly one of the best dishes of Pad Thai I've had; out or in. . .

Great Pad Thai recipe! I followed the other reviews and cut down on the oil to 1 cup, and even then I had a lot left over. I'd recommend reducing the oil to 3/4 cup or even 1/2 cup. It took a long time to make this recipe but it was worth it. The sauce is authentic and tasty.

My friend Shannon and I tried the recipe together for a dinner party with an Asian theme. It was the first time we made this dish, although both of us have done a lot of other Asian dishes. It turned out great and all the guests loved it. We cut down on the Sriracha so the kids would enjoy it. The shallots did not come out crispy so next time we'll try a higher temperature for the oil. We had about a cup of oil left which will be used for stir fry tonight.

It was very good. I've never had pad thai made by someone from thailand, so I can't rate its authenticity, but it tasted wonderful! It isn't something you'd want to eat the leftovers though, because the flavors bland out if it sits. If you have any of the sauce leftover, save it, then you can put it on the leftovers when you heat it up, to add flavor back again.

This dish tasted so amazing. I had to use the drink concentrate tamarindo from my Hispanic grocery La Michoacana, and I did not use brown sugar as this was already sweetened drink mix. I don't know if I would choose half the shallots to fry... maybe a quarter of them. Otherwise this dish was so awesome. Next time I'm going to make this with a few more veggies.. broccoli etc. I added mushrooms to this one which turned out great. I will definitely make it again!! One more note ... I used 1/2 cup oil and turned out great.

I generally agree with the comments but have a few helpful suggestions. I fry all the shallots at once, then pour off the oil and add it back as necessary. I use about half the tofu. I only use two eggs. I cannot find a block of tamarind so have used tamarind paste. In the step where you cook the scallions I add cut up broccoli that I parboil (actually, 3 minutes in the microwave). All in all, a very tasty weeknight dinner, though could use a little more heat. Personally, I don't like sweet main courses so the alloted sugar is more than enough.

Measures up to our favorite Thai takeout. Cut down on the oil for frying the shallots and the tofu, but used the called for 6 tablespoons for stir frying the rice noodles. Would add a little more brown sugar next time because I like it sweet. My husband tells me it's even better the next day!

I agree that the recipe calls for too much oil. I used just a few spoons and that was enough. Also, I used pre-fried tofu bought from the Asian store and that worked well. I also had to put almost double the amount of sugar they asked for because it was too tart with the tamarind- but add sugar slowly to your taste. With the additional sugar, it was a great dish!

So, we cut this recipe in half (it still made a LOT!) except for the sauce. also added extra siracha, because we like things 4-star spicy in this house. the only changes I would make again are to cut the tofu into thinner strips and eliminate all the in-and-out with the oil. It was a bit fussy, but the flavors were excellent, right on the mark. Thank goodness they didn't call for catchup! Tamarind makes the dish.

This was great! I followed this exactly, except added carrots. My comments: 1. way, way too much oil - I threw away a lot; 2. I was confused at the end when they said to add 1- 1/2 cups of the sauce, when i only had about 1/2 cup to begin with so I re-read the recipe. I think you are supposed to keep the water your soaking the tamarind in - I didn't, but just addded water to the pan; 3. I did not find the block of tamarind, but did find the pods (looks like big, brown pea pods). It takes about 6-8 to make 3 tablespoons; 4. I fried my own tofu, but never again. I recommend buying the pre-fried tofu - not worth the hassle of frying it up yourself. This recipe is a keeper!

This recipe is great! The word "painstaking" in the description is a little too true; it takes a long time to prepare all of the components and put the whole thing together. But it is well worth it. This tastes like a restaurant version! I usually add broccoli and red bell peppers for a wider vegetable variety.

So, first of all, I couldn't find tamarind, so made the recipe without it, and it still was delicious. The recipe as written is messy and is not a quick weeknight dinner... (if you want quick Pad Thai, order takeout). However, the results were fabulous. With a bit of planning, there's probably a way to simplify using pre-baked tofu and simplifying the steps in the recipe.

My boyfriend made this for our anniversary dinner and it was amazing. He made some changes such as not using nearly so much oil; I think he used 2/3 cup. Unfortunately we couldn't find tamarind or sriracha, so we used a Thai chili sauce that worked fantasticly, and he added peanut butter to the sauce to give it good peanut flavor besides only the crushed nuts. Also, instead of tofu he used Morningstar soy chicken strips that worked very well. We recommend adding more vegies. A frozen Asian medley worked well for us. The recipe was a great success, and it makes a lot so the leftovers are a bonus since it does take a bit of preperation. I'm sure it will be made again!

The sauce seemed really one dimensional, and the soy sauce flavor overpowered the delicacy of the shallot flavor. And, even with the reduced oil, we felt it was far too greasy. We loved the tang of the tamarind, but rather than making this recipe again, I'll be adding tamarind to my old pad thai recipe.

Nice, but not exactly vegetarian with eggs in it! If you can't find a block of tamarind pulp in your Asian or Mexican grocery, look for tamarind liquid concentrate. If the liquid contains sugar, leave the sugar out of the recipe. Palm sugar (red sugar) is better than brown sugar.

my husband and i are no strangers to the traditional thai cuisine so i was really excited to see when this recipe was featured on my favourite website. the flavour of the sauce is bang on!! i made some changes to the rest of the recipe though. i completey agree about the oil, and i only used about 1/4c. in the end. i also thought it was strange to see a vegetarian recipe with no vegetables so i did add some stir fried brocoli florets and shredded carrot. i didn't use nearly as much sugar, maybe about 2tbsp. since we're not vegetarian i put some chicken it in too. my husband's on his second plate as we speak. yummm! next time i'm gonna try it with some lump crab meat!

This was terrific, though I did make some changes. I also could not find a block of tamarind, so I used tamarind paste - 3 T. Instead of eggs, I added steamed broccoli. I also used far less oil. Finally, instead of roasted peanuts, I added raw peanuts to the oil at the same time as the scallions. I would make this again in a second.

Please, if you enjoy Thai food, you MUST make this recipe! It does require significant preparation, but it is worth the effort. And thanks to the reviewer from Freehold, NJ: I reduced the oil to 3/4 cup, and it was perfect. I would suggest, however, that tamari is no substitute for tamarind -- two completely different ingredients. I will make this recipe again and again!

Very good, but, like many vegetarian recipes it was excessively greasy. Next time I will cut back the oil to max 1C. Also, I could not find a block of tamarind, so I used 3/4C tamari sauce and still had sauce left over!
