Fantastic recipe. I have made many truffle recipes in the past (a dozen or so) and this is the first time they turned out so very, very well. Thank You!

Yum. After reading through the recipe I was a little nervous about the possibility of things going wrong. But all went well, and the results were great. Ended up using a darker bittersweet in the ganache and a regular bittersweet for the enrobing, and it was a great combination. We did plain, toasted coconut, and ground walnuts, and the toasted coconut was our favorite.

These truffles were amazing! I brought them in to my class and everyone loved them. I did not follow the recipe exactly though. Here is what I did: I cut the recipe down to half the amount but I made two separate ganches-one bittersweet chocolate and one milk chocolate. I put baily's irish cream in the milk chocolate as a flavoring and vanilla in the dark. Then I put them both in the fridge/freezer to save time. Though I would recommend adding a little less cream if your using milk chocolate. I enrobed some truffles but did not with the others and they were equally great. Great recipe but time consuming. Note-very helpful to have a friend help to roll them in the garnish.

These were delicious and everyone loved them. I made 3 kinds, with raspberry vodka, amaretto, and grand marnier, rolled in cocoa powder, walnuts, and coconut. Note: don't try to replace the dark chocolate with white chocolate; it doesn't set enough to roll into balls. Made for pretty tasty white chocolate dipped strawberries though!

They were really great. But, I was a bit worried about the flavor if they would be similar to one of the finest kept secret truffles I love. They tasted more like the liquid use than the chocolate truffle itself. Can anyone help me learn how to make truffles like Chocolates JOHFREJ, C&V makes? You can see their website here www.johfrej.com to learn more. Saludos! Betty

For chocolates this was pretty simple to make. I added other liquors such as; lemon, raspberry, and espresso to create a variety of flavors. The chocolate powder covering was a little too much for my taste but the toasted coconut and the crush nuts were delightful. I will be making this for years to come.

My Ganache broke in the melting/mixing stage. The trouble seemed to start when I busted out the immersion blender according to the directions... I went back to the whisk, added some cold cream and stirred it for a good 10 minutes and it cooled down and came back together. I added some Kahlua coffee liquor to deepen the chocolate flavor. It's cooling now, but it's going to be delicious. How could it not be?

my truffles were delitous! i mixed this recipe and another one (accedently) so it took 4 ever to refridgerate because i put 10 oz of chocolate (that was called for in the other recipe) and 2 cups heavy cream. Big mistake! but it's ok they were good anyway.

absolutely fabulous...messy, uneven, but heavenly!! i use callebaut and valrona semi and bittersweet; also made a batch using valrona hazelnut milk chocolate. a big hit and a great gift! A perfect snowy day activity.

I previously had a hard time making truffles (although that was when I was in high school), so I was nervous going into this. I actually only made 1/4 of the recipe today because I don't need a lot of these.. and even that made 20-30 truffles. Rolling them was a little hard. I had to stick them back in the fridge once, and keep my hands cold. I used Vodka and vanilla for flavoring, and they taste good. I dipped mine in 1/2 semisweet chocolate 1/2 white chocolate (it melts well that way) and sprinkled nuts on some and crushed peppermints on others. They are very smooth and rich and remind me of Lindt truffles. So far my family agree they were a great success. I'll be trying some other variations tomorrow

I was really frightened to try my hand at making chocolates-- but these were super easy and taste great (even without the liqueur). The thing I recommend doing differently is the enrobing process. I used a toothpick to dip the ganache balls into the melted chocolate. When you roll them in cocoa powder the toothpick holes disappear, so don't worry. Overall a great recipe.

This is the first time I have made truffles and I have to say the recipe is easy, time consuming, but easy. They are really to die for! So rich! Especially the ones with white chocolate rolled in nuts! I just have to learn how to enrobe them and garnish without ruining their shape!

These didn't work out for me. The ganache broke, and I did everything I could to bring it back together, but nothing worked. This recipe has a much higher cream-to-chocolate ratio than anything else I've seen--almost twice the cream of other recipes. I'm pretty sure that was a huge part of the problem...

I must just not be talented enough to make these right. These were really hard for me. The chocolate gobbed up on the balls and so they weren't round although I like how the chocolate stays hard and they don't need to be refrigerated. They taste good but don't look pretty and the cocoa clumped up on the chocolate too. Maybe I rolled them in the cocoa too soon? I've never had trouble with truffles before... Even the coconut that I put in the oven burned a little but I followed the instructions with everything exactly.Oh well, I'm on to another recipe.

These are amazing! This is the second year I have made these truffles as gifts for friends and family. They were recently described as "dangerously delicious."

These truffles are both labor intensive and really lovely. I tweaked the recipe in two small ways:I added a tablespoon of butter to the tempered chocolate to enhance gloss, and I dipped my hands in cocoa instead of ice water when rolling the ganache. Both helped to expedite the day-long truffle project and helped me get to my holiday party on time.

Even tho' the ingredients are basic to other truffle recipes I have made, this was by far the best! Maybe it was the chocolate--I used 3 bars of dark chocolate from Aldi's (Choceur, I think). Anyway, since it was not the correct amt., I reduced the cream to 1 1/2 cups. Also, I'm a klutz, and had trouble with the fork when dipping, so I dropped the truffles into the entombing chocolate and rolled them around the "clean" sides of the bowl. This took off the excess. Anyway, they were a hit.

These were absolutely amazing. I didn't want to make so many for the first time, so I cut down the recipe by 1/4. This translated into 1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream and about 5.25 oz of semi-sweet chocolate for the ganache (I used the Baker's brand and it was great). For the amount of coating chocolate, I used 9 oz. I noticed some of the comments indicated that the ganache did not harden. My guess was that they added the Grand Marnier in the beginning. I opted not to use the Grand Marnier (or anything else for that matter) and the texture was quite workable. After putting the ganache in the cookie sheet and covered with plastic, I put it in the refrigerator for 15 minutes. If was perfect to work with. I simply sliced the ganache into 2" x 2" squares after taking it out of the refrigerator and rolled each square into a ball. A great suggestion here is to keep your hands cold, so wash in cold water every 2 or 3 rolls so they don't start to melt. The balls actually come out pretty round. After I was completed I put them back in the refrigerator. Although it doesn't state the temperture of the chocolate to enrobe the ganache. When melting the chocolate, make sure it gets at least over 105 degrees F, but don't start working with it until it gets down to about 88 degrees F. I used many different garnishes. For the cocoa powder and confectioner's sugar I rolled the truffle right into the garnish, but I also used orange zest, lemon zest, chopped dark chocolate. For each of those, I simply drizzle over the top which provided a lot cleaner look. The absolute favorite garnish was Grey Sea Salt. Definitely will be making this one again!!

Absolutely amazing. I made a champagne truffle and a cognac truffle. The tempered chocolate coating makes all the difference in the world. Very soft centers that melt with a nice shiny, crisp outer coating. I dusted the cognac truffles with some sweetened cocoa powder to help cut the bitterness. Worked very well. Truffles are always a ton of work to make, but these were absolutely amazing.

For all the trouble and expense involved, these really aren't amazing. They came out as anticipated, but just didn't taste that great. I recommend just buying the convenient Lindor/Lindt truffles at any major retail store. They taste way better & I eat at least a few bags of em a month for less money and hassle

These truffles are truly decadent! It does require one to excersise as decent amount of patience, but the results are rewarding! I made sure to really seek out fine bittersweet and white chocolate which makes a world of difference. I found fantastice chocolate sold by the bricks at Whole Foods. Once you get the hang of piping the smalls balls of ganache, the rest of this becomes a breeze. Make sure that you keep your chocolate in the precise temperature range in order to achieve the best results. Also, make sure that you have some fun with the coatings and flavorings, cocoa, nuts, coconut, liquer........Be creative!

As I have worked with chocolate before I was rather nervous of making truffles in case the chocolate 'seized up' and became unuseable. But given the detailed instructions, this recipe was surprisingly easy to make. Having used a 70% cocoa European dark chocolate, we found it wasn't sweet enough- even though we are fans of dark chocolate and not-too-sweet desserts. So I added some powdered sugar after rewarming the chocolate and it still mixed well and maintained the shiny ganache texture. Next tiem I will use bittersweet rather than dark chocolate. I divided the mixture into 3: I added 20g Frangelico to one, 20g Kahlua to another and a Mayan mixture of cinnamon, nutmeg and ancho chillies to the third portion. The Mayan one was incredible! But be careful not to overspice it! The Kahlua was pretty good but I needed to add far more Kahlua and a some espresso to get a decent moka taste. The Franglico was barely dscernible. I'll experiment more with flavours next time.

Ghiridelli makes bittersweet chocolate chips, which I find work great for making truffles. They always melt smoothly, and they are super easy to measure. I love the Grand Marnier in this recipie, but next time I will use a tiny bit more, you could hardly taste it in the finished truffles. I also skip the pastry bag and chill the ganache in a bowl overnight. I use a spoon to scoop out balls, chill them, roll them in my hands to make them smoothe and then dip them in chocolate. They turned out beautiful, and everyone wanted the recipie!

When do you add the Grand Marnier? I seem to have missed that step in the recipe? Do you boil it with the cream?

Very straightforward, detailed recipe. I let my ganache sit overnight, and found the ganache too hard to pipe. I just cut it into squares and rolled the squares: it worked fine. I found it easy to roll each truffle if I washed my hands in cold water frequently, as the recipe suggests. I tempered white, milk, and dark chocolate in the microwave to enrobe the truffles - so easy. I found using a skewer to enrobe them worked fine, but was really messy. I ended up just dunking each truffle into the bowl of melted chocolate and fishing it out with a spoon. Much easier and cleaner and made a prettier truffle.

Does anyone know how many truffles this recipe makes? It looks like the perfect truffle recipe. I make them every year for the holidays and I'll try this one.Thanks!

This recipe is great! I made only half a batch, and used a generous 2 tablespoons Absolut raspberri vodka which I could definitely taste in the end product. I chilled the ganache in the refrigerator for an hour or two, and then scooped it out with a melon baller. The size was perfect. I then refrigerated the mounds for a while before rolling them into balls. I rolled some of the enrobed truffles in cocoa, some in toasted coconut, and the rest in finely chopped dark chocolate. Lovely presentation and so delicious! I can hardly stop eating them.

I halved this recipe, then use Grand Marnier in half and port in the rest. Next time, I will add more alcohol, as it was barely discernable. I did not do the enrobing (no time), but using the pastry bag made things go very quickly. Popped the tray in the freezer for a few minutes, then rolledin nuts or cocoa. Guets loved them...very rich...and I'm not one who likes chocolate.

I used about a Tbsp. of orange zest which turned out wonderful. I used, very finely chopped toasted almonds, ground cocoa, and chopped pistachios. I'll probably make them for one of my cookie exchanges at Christmas time. put them in small boxes (fit 5 in each box) and took them to an Easter Dinner. They were quite a hit. I'm taking the rest (it did make a LOT of them) to a ladies gathering tomorrow evening, I'm sure they will be gone quickly.

Like every truffle recipe that I have ever tried (this was the third), my ganache would not set properly. I'm not sure if this was due to the temperature of my house, but even when I put them in the freezer, the ganache would not set. In order to get it to set, I had to half the amount of cream that was recommended. That worked really well, however. I'm pleased that I have finally been able to successfully attempt truffles.

Instructions were great and detailed. I used chocolate from Trader Joe's. I didn't feel lost at any part of the process. I combined a couple recipes and ended up with four varieties, and all taste wonderful and look wonderful. I mixed some balsamic vinegar 1/4 of the batch and coated those with toasted hazelnuts (Bon Appetit). I added raspberry puree to another 1/4 of the batch (Fine Cooking). With the remainder of plain chocolate, I coated in either cocoa or toasted coconut. I will do these again sometime.

I had no idea it was so simple to make truffles! Well, sort of: I only made the "insides" as I didn't have the guts to try tempering chocolate in which to enrobe them. I just scooped them out into little dollopsm which hardened up nicely, and ate them w/o a coating. For my second batch I mixed in some praline paste before turning out to cool, to make them even more decadent. Truly delicious, and a great little gift for people you like.

Everyone was impressed with the presentation of these truffles. Although I spent an HOUR finely chopping my chocolate for it, my ganache was not perfectly smooth. Next time, I will consider purchasing shaved chocolate, or enlisting help to do the chopping. (In the end, I didn't really notice any chocolate "lumps" in my truffles). I chilled my ganache overnight, and it was too rich to force through a pastry bag. I simply used a teaspoon to drop the ganache centres on the parchment paper. This worked well, and I really don't see what the need for a pastry bag would have been. In rolling the truffles, I added bing cherries to the centre of the ganache, which was a great addition. Tempering the chocolate in the microwave was super easy, and the dipping and rolling was definitely messy.
