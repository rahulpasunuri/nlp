This was a great way to use leftover ham - Black Forest I received from the Gourmet Food club...yummy! Not your boring ham sandwich!. I followed the low fat version and baked this open face. The only change was that I used Pam Butter spray to crisp up the bread nicely while it was baking.

This was so good! I used fresh rye bread from the bakery. Also I used one pound of ham for five sandwiches. We like ours thick. Smoked gouda is one of my favorite cheeses so I especially liked this.

I made a lower-fat variation on these, and they were a big hit!! I made open-faced sandwiches -- marble rye, dijon mustard, either black forest ham or regular turkey, and then grated cheese on top, and then baked them at 400 degrees until the cheese melted. Plus, easy to make for a crowd -- I made 64 in no time.

This was a very efficient sandwich. It's tasty and is ready to eat in minutes. Good for cold winter days.
