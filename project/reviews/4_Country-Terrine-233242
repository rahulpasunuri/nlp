Great recipe for a pate. Followed recipe exactly except added some ground veal and shallots to the mixture. I also added a little cayenne pepper as I like a little spice. If you are doing this for the first time, this is a great recipe to follow. Start to finish is around 36 hours.

this was absolutely spot on, I did however add some dried cherries

Really outstanding and easy too! It made a really huge amount and I baked it in a long terrine...and baked somewhat less than 1 3/4 hours. Be careful to check the temp. I didn't use the veal but actually had about 2 1/2 lbs. of pork plus the chicken liver and adjusted the other ingredients a bit. Then I froze 1/2 of it for another party...a real keeper!

This was excellent. The flavor appealed to everyone at my party, even those that usually do not like pate, because of all the other meats involved. A little time consuming, but worth it!

Best Terrine ever. Made exactly as recipe first time. Second time, ommitted chicken livers. Added two tbs pink peppercorns (whole) and a jar (3.5 oz) capers. This is now a staple in our home served with Honey/Butter French Bread, Cheese and what-ever pickles and French Onion Soup for supper on a winter night.

Excellent!!!! I used a dash of cloves instead of the allspice. Everyone who tasted it said that it was wonderful. I will definitely be making this one again.

I found this to be a little on the bland side, despite using duck livers instead of chicken. It's nice that it can be made in advance but for all the ingredient-hunting and prep I just don't think the pay-off justifies the effort.

I am in my last year of culinary arts school, and made this recipe for a final presentation for one of my classes. It was a huge hit, my chef loved it, and the judges ate half of it. (I won 3rd place out of the class for my display) I didnt change a thing.

Wasn't expecting my guests to eat the ENTIRE THING as part of a large charcuterie setup, but they did, to rave reviews. Served with toasted baguette slices, cornichons, mustards, etc. Tasted very light & fresh (esp. considering what goes in) compared to a purchased one. Not something I'd take the time to make often, but will definately make again. Also, I substituted caul fat for bacon lining - probably made it a bit easier to unmold.
