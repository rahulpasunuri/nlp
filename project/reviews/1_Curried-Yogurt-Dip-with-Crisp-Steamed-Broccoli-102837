Agree with the other reviewer. I only used 1 cup of yogurt and ended up with more than 2 teaspoons of curry (good quality too) as well as some cayenne. Really bland with the original ingredients and too much of a yogurt taste.

Bland and boring. I had to add so much to make it taste good it may as well be a whole new recipe. Don't bother with this one.
