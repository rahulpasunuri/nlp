Have made this quite a few times. It's always flavorful and aromatic. To me it tastes better WITHOUT the chicken (or tofu). I know chicken is in the title, but it's sooo good without it. Love the kumquats in it.

This does take a little bit of front-end prep time, but then you get to sit back as all the delightful Moroccan smells float through the house. I love the use of the sour kumquats and the sweet prunes, and the chicken cooks beautifully in the broth for moist and flavorful chicken. This is relatively easy, healthy and delicious meal. The only thing I'd change is to add more cumin and cinnamon. Delicious (and so easy) over whole wheat couscous.

Delicious and easy to prepare. I couldn't find kumquats - maybe it's the wrong time of year - but I subsituted an orange, which wasn't necessary. I cut the butternut squash in half and roasted it in the oven until partially cooked in order to make it easier to peel. I also followed another reviewer's advice and floured the chicken before browning. I toasted pumpkin seeds and sprinkled them along with the cilantro on top of the dish. I do love the "sweet meat" dishes and this goes into my file of wonderful cool weather meals!

I was looking for ways to use kumquats in savory dishes. This is a great way! The kumquat rind makes a great, quite thick, sauce with no need to add flour and the citrusy taste is just right. I did not have prunes, so replaced with dried apricots and loved it.

This was delicious! I have made it twice and it will become a permanent staple in my home. I followed another reviewer's advice and coated the chicken in flour before browning. The first time this worked out well, the second time I coated the chicken a little too thoroughly - so watch this because it can get a little gluey. I served this with the incredible date couscous from this site, as well as some grilled zucchini. Highly recommended!

I just discovered cooking with kumquats earlier this year and was pleased to find this delicious chicken recipe. It's very similar to another recipe I've made for years, SPICED MOROCCAN CHICKEN WITH ONIONS AND PRUNES (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/4503), so I basically combined the two recipes. I didn't have the squash so I substituted celery root, which worked out fine. Next time I might dredge the chicken in flour before the initial browning just to help the sauce thicken in the end. Kumquats are now out of season but I certainly look forward to making this again next winter!

I love this recipe-it's my favorite to take to pot-lucks. But I make it in a crock-pot. I just throw everything except the oil into the crock-pot. Then, when the chicken is almost cooked, I fish it out, cut the meat off the bones into bite-size pieces, throw these chicken bits back in and cook it awhile longer. It's delicious!!

fabulous and easy. You could also vary it with other winter vegetables. Next tiime I will double the veggie amounts. Two of us ate nearly all of them.

I made this recipe because I had some kumquats to use and I'm always interested in spicy dishes. I was a bit skeptical but it turned out just great! I'd never eaten kumquats before but they added just such a nice contrast to the sweet prunes and squash. I used 10 chicken legs instead of a whole chicken. The latest issue of Bon Appetit says that kumquats are one of the next hot topics for cooking. I'd recommend others try this.

This recipe smelled fantastic while it cooked, but the taste didn't live up to the smell. The squash and prunes just didn't seem to mix well. However, the chicken was fine -- just not something I'll make again any time soon.

I loved this recipe when I made it last winter. I've literally combed through dozens of cookbooks and on-line recipe files to find the recipe again. The recipe is great for a make-ahead meal as the flavors enhance as they mature. I'm preparing it as a welcome home dish for my brother and sister-in-law who are bringing home their new baby.

A friend of mine made this and as soon as I tasted it, I asked her for the recipe. Great flavors, unusual combination that really works together. Delicious. I plan to make it later this week.

This was one of those dishes that tasted good at the time, but I really didn't feel like eating leftovers the next day. Maybe I just don't love sweet meat dishes.

gag me! The chicken itself was good once I scrapped everything off it. I like the ingredients, but the combination is not good.

This simple recipe is absolutely delicious! It looks very attractive, too, and would be a great meal for guests. Tastes wonderful reheated as well. This is an absolute keeper.

Wonderful, very tasty. I added coarsely ground pepper and some grated fresh ginger. By the way, real couscous is not a grain shaped pasta, it is actually cracked grain. Israeli couscous is a grain shaped pasta.
