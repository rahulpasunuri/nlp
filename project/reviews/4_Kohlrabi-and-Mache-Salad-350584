Surprisingly good! My first encounter with kohlrabi and loved the flavor. Good crunch, a bit of peppery spice, but milder than radishes. I mixed the kohlrabi and dressing together, and saved the greens for last-minute mixing so the salad would keep for a few days. The kohlrabi lasted great in the fridge and my husband munched on it all week. This is a keeper when kohlrabi is in season.

This salad totally surprised me--I had relatively low expectations, having been underwhelmed by kohlrabi in other salads. But this salad was so fresh and delicious, I hope I get kohlrabi again from my CSA! This is definitely a salad that would look impressive at a dinner party. I made the recipe with yellow instead of red onions, and some redleaf lettuce instead of mache.

Not terrible, not great. I think I just don't like kohlrabi in salad.

Make this salad! You will look like a genius. It was very easy and tasted great. This is definitely going in the regular rotation. I used less mache, just a personal preference.

Great summer salad. I added 2 tsp dijon mustard and finely chopped parsley which cut some of the tartness of the lemon. Delicous to serve with anything grilled.

This recipe is delicious and so easy to throw together. This is the first time I have cooked with kohlrabi and it is so good.

I've eaten this salad at St. John and I can confirm that it is delicious. It inspired me to buy a fresh Kohlrabi and I'm delighted to find the recipe.

This really was a delicious salad! Light, crunchy and yummy. I had never worked with kohlrabi before and this was a perfect starter dish. This is elegant enough for a dinner party but simple and quick enough for every day.

We love this recipe; we get local kohlrabi and red onions delivered in our mystery weekly box when we're lucky. We take this on picnics because we can dress it early and the ingredients stay crisp.

I made this with purple-skinned baby kohlrabi from an organic farm, so I did not peel it. I had never had it raw before, but it was really delicious. The dressing is perfect for the featured veg, and the capers add a wonderful contrast and salty bite. This will be a favorite way to enjoy the little sputniks.
