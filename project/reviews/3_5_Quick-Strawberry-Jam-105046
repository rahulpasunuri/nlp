This was quick, but I wasn't very impressed with it.

I have been making this jam since the recipe first came out. I usually cut the sugar a bit if the strawberries are sweet. This is very easy to make and tastes better than any jam in a store. I can't wait for strawberries to be in season so I can make it again! (Also makes a great gift)

Mine didn't set - even though I cooked it for a lot longer than 5 minutes. It will certainly be good on ice cream, cake etc, but makes your toast a bit soggy. Perhaps I can redo with some more pectin and see if that will help it set....I'm not very experienced making jam but after all the great reviews, I didn't think I had to be :)

This recipe is so easy and makes a very fresh tasting jam that's not too sweet. My family loves it. This is a great way to use up any extra fresh strawberries you may have on hand.

I had never made jam before so I carefully sellected this one from the list. 100% would make it again and I agree. Delicious! I impressed my future mother-in-law with my homemade jam! Delicious and easy!

What a terrific way to enjoy strawberries all year long! The 2/3C of sugar was just right. However, it took me considerably more that 5 minutes of cooking to get it thick. One batch is spreadable; the other batch, cooked only 5 minutes,is pourable. Not bad for ice cream, etc. It won't go to waste.

We went strawberry picking this weekend; there were so many I had to do something so I found this recipe. The consistency was a little runny I might add more pectin or let it cook a little longer the next time. It does taste wonderful though and works well as a topping for ice cream.

Very Quick, very easy, very fresh tasting! Made this with a class of 12 students(I did the cooking part) as a follow-up to a lesson. Will surely make it with them again when strawberries are in season and they can each bring a jar home!

Very easy to make. The result was a very fresh and delicious tasting jam. I started with 2/3 cup of sugar and did not feel the need to add more. This recipe is a keeper!
