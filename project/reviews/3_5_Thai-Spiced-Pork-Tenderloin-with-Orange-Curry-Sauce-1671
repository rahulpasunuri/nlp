Fantastic! The best pork tenderloin recipe I've encountered. Added some extra marinating liquid throughout the baking, it is just great!

Bought a pork tenderloin on sale and was searching for recipes based on the ingredients on hand. Made the marinade using red curry paste and a mix of ginger syrup and ground ginger. Marinaded a few hours, grilled & cooled, then covered and stuck in fridge. Made the sauce using same ginger subs, fresh clementine juice/zest and red curry paste, skipped the butter. Stuck in fridge. Next morning blanched broccoli and carrots, cooked some fresh noodles, ice shocked all of it then drained veggies & noodles separately. Tossed the noodles in some sesame oil, chilled it all in a big bowl, veggies on bottom, noodles on top. After work sliced up the pork, some red bell pepper, scallions and cilantro and tossed the whole thing together with the noodles, blanched veggies and sauce. Let stand about an hour and had an absolutely sumptuous Asian-themed noodle dinner. Excellent!

This was truly wonderful. Based on reviews, I made some changes...I used 6 oranges and fresh squeezed to just over 2 cups. That was perfect and not to much liquid. Also used half half can of coconut milk instead of butter. Used curry paste since I could not find the base. 1/2 t for sauce and 2 T for marinade. Very pleased...quite delicious!

After reading other reviews, thought I would say that I fresh squeezed the orange juice, and considering the other comments, it must make all the difference in the world.

I don't eat pork and was making dinner for my mom who is a vegetarian. So I made it with pressed tofu instead of the pork. The sauce is to die for! My husband loved it, my mom thoroughly enjoyed it, and my grandma ate several slices. Highly recommended! Next time I'll probably make it with chicken.

a winner in this house! sauce WAS worthwhile, but i think i'd also go with 1/2 coconut milk 1/2 butter next time.

I made this exact recipe. I had read the reviews but I wanted to try the OG recipe before tweaking it. The flavor of the meat was amazing! The marinade wonderful. The sauce could have used a little help. First, there was WAY too much. You could easily half the recipe. I actually really like the flavors within the sauce, but with out anything to really soak it up , it was just left to pool on my plate. Next time, I would take the other reviewers advice and make the sauce with a can of coconut milk and serve the whole thing over rice. I also would have added some green onion or ramps for a flavor boosting garnish.

I read through a ton of reviews before deciding to finally make this dish. I took the suggestions of the other reviewers and made the sauce with coconut milk and half the amount of butter. I also boiled the marinade with coconut milk. Then me and roommates tried both the sauces side by side. The marinade won hands down. While the sauce is ok, it just can't hold its own next to the marinade, especially considering how labor intensive it is. Don't waste your time and money like I did, skip the sauce all together and stick with the marinade. On a side note, I used brown sugar and a little water as a substitute for molasses in the marinade. I will definitely be making this dish again. It was great over rice.

Rating: 1
the sauce was horrible and a waste of time, energy and ingredients. the tenderloin itself was no better or worse than a dozen other. not outstanding enough to make again, not good enough to recommend.

Rating: 3
This was a wonderful dish and not difficult to make. I didn't have time to do an overnight marinate and it didn't seem to diminish the intensity of the flavor - ti was full of flavor. I had to do a few substitutions: orange/banana/strawberry juice instead of plain orange and maple syrup for molasses. I only used 2 cups of juice for the sauce (because I didn't have a lot of juice in the fridge) and it wasn't enough sauce - definitely use the full 3. Or even more if you like extra sauce.

Truly terrible. An awful waste of time and ingredients. The sauce recipe makes a large amount (we even went to the trouble of fresh squeezing juice) and it was so gross we just threw it out.

excellent, flavorful and different. I am not an experienced cook but followed the directions - turned out beautifully, very moist pork. I made two 1 1/2 lb tenderloins - had plenty of marinade. Surprised by the amount of cumin in the sauce, but it really worked! i did use just a bit less butter to finish out the sauce and that was fine with my family.

Rating: 3
DELICIOUS! The combined flavours in the sauce was very tasty and complimented each other quite well. Yes, the labour of the recipe was time consuming but definitely worth it! I started our meal with the Thai Cucumber Salad with Roasted Peanuts (found on this site) and it too was complimentary. I paired the pork with a cocunut/cilantro rice. I gave this recipe 3 forks - I would make it again! Thanks for the great recipe!!!

I love this recipe. I emailed Thaikitchen to ask what was the difference between paste and base. My response was for 1/4 cup base, use 2-3 tbsp of paste. Hope this helps.

My husband and I really enjoyed this! The sauce is definitely something that can be made ahead of time if you are having company over. A definitely bonus. We weren't sure what Thai red curry base was, so we just used Thai red curry paste...it seemed to work! Also, we used the measured amount of ingredients for the sauce, but added a half a can of coconut milk. It may have made it too liquidy, but we really enjoyed the flavor! We will definitely make this again!

The sauce, as suggested, with chix both for 1/2 the OJ and coconut milk for 1/2 the butter, and less curry paste was pretty good, but not worth the work (chop all the ingredients, puree it, strain it, plus another recipe for the marinade). I probably wouldn't go through the work to make it again. I wouldn't recommend skipping the straining either, since the carrots are chunky in the puree and that's not a nice look. The marinade was surprisingly not very tasty & I left it on the counter over an hour to really get the flavors in there.

Rating: 3
(3 1/2 forks) If you're looking for a new way to "do" pork, try this one. There is no way this dish is bland. It has a wonderful heat to it that is not overwhelming and works perfectly with pork. I only marinated the meat for 1 hour. Next time I'll marinate overnight for added depth of flavor.

Rating: 4
This was wonderful, and worth the effort. Both the marinade and sauce make enough for two 1 1/2 pound tenderloins in my opinion. It seemed like a lot of cumin, but that did not overwhelm the other flavors.

Rating: 4
Some of you said the sauce was bland. I made the sauce when I started to marinate the pork. It gave the flavours in the sauce time to meld and for the heat of the hot pepper and red chile paste to come through. Very good. I served simply with basmati rice and snap peas.

Rating: 3
This was quite tasty. I used thin-sliced pork cutlets and did them in a frying pan. I finished cooking them in the sauce. I found the sauce too fruity, I would substitute chicken broth for half of the OJ. I added some coconut milk at the end (instead of butter) before pouring it over the cutlets to finish cooking.

Rating: 4
I make this every summer without the sauce. Just use the marinade and then grill it on the barbecue. Even better if you marinade the pork all day. It is one of my most requested recipes.

I was looking for something different to be the focus of my Memorial Day cook-out and this was perfect. I was delighted that one guest - an excellent home chef himself -- couldn't wait to sample the pork and ate while standing, oohhing and aahhing over the taste. Others, both children and adults, were also thrilled with the meal. In case there were non-pork people, I marinated and cooked a few boneless chicken breasts and they were also a hit. To offer two distinctly different tastes, I made the Orange-Curry Sauce as directed with butter (skipped the straining step) and then followed other readers' suggestions and added a can of light coconut milk to the marinade to create a second sauce. My guests were hard-pressed to pick a favorite. Most actually liked combining them! I served it with a Cucumber-Yogurt Salad and a medley of roasted veggies: white and sweet potatoes and red, orange and green peppers. The combination of flavors and colors was appetizing and tasty. I look forward to using the leftover sauces in my dinners this week. I know this recipe will be used over and over!

This was one of the greatest tasting pork receipes I have fixed. Yes do us the coconut milk in both the marinate and sauce. I served both along side and let the company use what they wanted. The pork was wonderful by its self. Will be using this again and again

Yum! I took the other reviewers advice and subbed coconut milk for the butter. Also, I didn't bother to strain the sauce. Seemed like a hassle for not much benefit. This was really good. I'll definitely be making it again.

I'm quite surprised at the amount of negative reviews of this recipe. I have made it several times and find it excellent. I use 1/2 cup less of orange juice, and only half a jalapeno, as I don;t think it needs the extra liquid and there is plenty of spice with only half a chili. Be sure to really let the sauce simmer and reduce, to make the most of the flavors. When marinating the pork, poke little holes in the tenderloin, to really let the marinade permeate the meat. Also, be sure to remove the membrane on the pork with a very sharp knife. Serve with pad thai noodles/rice sticks...really delicious.

Rating: 2
First off, I usually sort my recipe requests by fork rating. This was 4 forks so I was quite confident that it would be delicious. Surprise, it was just OK. My husband and guests liked it, or said they did, but I found the sauce to be very bland. I did grill the tenderloin and the meat was great. Also, I didn't really have the time to read all the reviews suggesting adding coconut milk. That might have helped the sauce a bit.

Rating: 3
Not similar to anything I've eaten in Thailand, but very tasty indeed. I grilled the tenderloin, so nice crispy exterior without the mess and hassle of browing and baking. I took the great advise of the other reviewers and substituted a can of coconut milk for the butter in the sauceand did not strain the sauce. The Thai Cucumber Salad with Roasted Peanuts on this site was a great side dish. This along with some steamed rice makes for a great dinner with equally great leftovers.

Rating: 2
I didn't think this was all that extraordinary, but it was OK. Heating the pork over high heat kind of burns the molasses it has been marinating in, but not terribly so. Cooking it to 160 degrees and then letting it rest kind of overcooks the meat. The sauce was good, though, and the snow peas I made with it from Jim Peterson's recipe were really good. Not sure if I'd ever make this again.

Rating: 4
I really enjoyed the meat without the sauce, but I made it a little differently than the recipe. I didn't have molassas, so I used about 3/4 c. of brown sugar and caramelized it in a saucepan with the other ingredients before putting it on the meat. It was much like a barbeque sauce. I also didn't marinade long...only about 5 minutes. I think it would be too strong I had let it marinate a whole hour. It was very nice. Sweet and spicy. I made the sauce, but opted to not eat it as the meat itself was so tasty. I made it in my non-stick caphalon grill pan and it turned out great and cleaned up fairly easily. I will rate the sauce later... when I have this again tomorrow night.

Orange sauce -- blah. Tasty meat, but not as good as other recipes I have used with pork loin.

Rating: 4
I made this recipe as printed with the exception of adding the coconut milk instead of butter (as suggested by others) and cut the chili paste back to 2 T instead of 1/4 C. Also used the marinade as a sauce by boiling and adding coconut milk. All was very good and everybody liked both sauces. Added a little orange sauce to some rice and made it very flavorful. This makes enough meat for exactly 4, but orange sauce is plenty for more people. Next time I will cut down on the chili paste a little more. It is very spicy, but good.

Rating: 4
This was delicious with the addition of coconut milk per other reviewers suggestions. Be sure to allow the sauce to reduce sufficiently, mine was too thin after adding the coconut milk. I also cut back on the red curry paste. Will definitely make again.

Rating: 3
This is really good, but in no way can I see ever needing a full 1/4 C. of Thai curry paste! I used a hefty 1 Tbs. and let it marinate for a few hours and it was very zippy. We live in California, we like our food spicy, but I would absolutely draw the line at 1-2Tbs of curry paste (I used Taste of Thai brand). I think the Honeyed-Ginger marinade is equally good -- if not better -- and also very easy, using always-on-hand ingredients.

to the person from ashland.You can buy the prepared red or yellow thai curry paste in thai grocery shops.the yellow is milder than the red.I make thai curry all the time especially with pork.But I tend to simplify all my cooking.Here's my version.1 kg cubed pork neck. 1 can of coconut milk I small can of red or yellow thai curry paste. 1 tbs grated fresh ginger,1 large tsp grated fresh garlic or passed through a press 2to 3 medium onions sliced not too thin fish sauce, and light soy sauce Ground pepper. 1/4 cup chopped fresh coriander 1/2 cup fresh mint leaves 1/2 cup thai basil leaves(these are stronger flavour. Place the pork cubes in a casserole with the coconut milk. Bring to a boil and cook for about 10 min. Now add ground pepper,fish sauce and soya sauce approximately 2tbs of the fish sauce and 1tbs of soya.or to taste.NO SALT add the small can of curry paste red or yellow doesnt matter.if u like it very hot then use the red. add the ginger and garlic mince add the mint,corriander and basil and last of all the sliced onions. simmer till meat is tender. check for seasoning.if not enough salt add more fish sauce. This is a recipe I created from some lessons of thai seasonings I got from a thai friend. I make this recipe for the lunch where I work, and it is always a hit/clients always ask when I will make it again. Hope you will like my version.if you need further questions you can always ask me at gina1139@yahoo.com

I have not made this, but have thought about making it several times, and plan to finally try it this weekend. To the previous reviewer, from KC: My Mom always soaked pans with a thick solution of baking soda and water ~ almost a thin paste. I don't have calphalon, but it works for burnt on baking dishes and also on my all-clad stainless cookware. Hope that helps....sometimes I soak overnight for really thick burnt on "stuff". Good Luck.

Part of not making this dish again is that my wife doesn't care for orange flavored food. Knowing that, I occasionally can't resist trying an otherwise interesting sounding recipe, and there are a couple of other asian-influenced pork recipes with orange that she does like. This, alas, didn't turn out to be one of them, though the meat minus the sauce was a hit. My main reason for commenting here, though, is more of an inquiry. This molassas based marinade wreaked havoc on my calphalon pan after browning the meat (golden brown, HA!, more of a burnt umber...tasty though) then roasting in the oven. After much soaking and scrubbing, my wife was able to resusitate (sp?) the pan, but there has to be a better way of dealing with a recipe like this, either to avoid having such a clean-up problem or a secret cleaning solution...any help?

I need help! I am preparing to make this recipe but can find neither red curry paste or red curry base. Taste of Thai's web site has only Red Curry Paste, but I can't imagine using 1/4 cup of it. My supermarket''s Taste of Thai section has neither. What can I use to substitute for this? Also is it liquid or powder? it calls for 1/4 c., which makes me wonder. I have Penzey's Tandoori Seasoning and Vindaloo Seasoning. Would either work? Need to know by Thursday! Many thanks!

This was wonderful! Made two whole loins and will have to make an extra next time for sandwhiches (baguette w/ mango chutney).

Served w/rice, to which I added a can of coconut milk I heated on stove w/ 1/2 C. golden raisins and 3TBSP pine nuts.

Great recipe overall but I would really check the type of red curry paste that you buy and adjust the amount of paste based on its heat intensity. When I made it, my mouth was burning (I mean seriously on FIRE!) for hours afterwards. I ended up adding a whole can of coconut milk to cool it off!! Yikes!

Based on other reviews I decided to make both sauces. The marinade was great as a marinade, but as a sauce it tasted too much like molasses. I even added some coconut milk. However, the orange sauce was delicious. I had never boiled leftover marinade, I had always heard to throw it out. I should have. I will make this receipe again and just use the yummy orange sauce.

I chose to go with just the marinade instead of the orange sauce. When I boiled it down a bit to use it for sauce it was too sweet so I added the juice of 2 limes, that gave the sauce a less sugary taste. Everyone enjoyed it.

Great Thai dish. Definitely a keeper. Didnn't seem too HOT to us. I'll bump up the amount of Red Curry Paste the next time. The other change I made was to rduce the amount of butter in the sauce. 6 TBS of butter is way too much (IMHO)- I only used about 2 TBS. Like a previous cook, I didn't strain the sauce. The texture was perfect after puree'ing it. A nice side dish with this is the Veggetable Green Curry.

Used an extra carrot in the orange sauce and cooked a little longer than recipe says - it was perfect consistency. Thanks for the tips! This is a keeper at our house.

A great receipe. I also substituted the OJ with lite coconut milk. It made for a very creamy sauce + added some cayenne which came through when the sauce cooled. Per an earlier comment, jasmine rice with raisins and pine nuts compliments it will. My fiance raved about the dish as a top 3.

This recipe is awesome. Simple ingredients, easy prep and excellent flavor at the end. I made this for the second time last night and used the left-over sauce we had from the week before. My only comment is that the sauce is way more than you need and it's pretty thin. So, next time I make it, I'll probably use less juice and maybe one more carrot to make it a little thicker. Otherwise, wondeful recipe and great served with a fresh steamed veggie and some curried cous cous...

I have made this twice. Once with pork, and once with chicken. Both times I skipped the sauce (as many have), and I just used the marinade. I roasted the pork. It was great. I barbequed the chicken (after marinating for about half an hour), and it was wonderful! I also saved all the marinade both times, added a can of coconut milk, and I added fresh chopped basil, boiling all ingredients. I would say to anyone that wants to try this that they should really try it the barbequed way. It is very easy, and it turns out perfectly. This will be a recipe I will make over and over, and I will make sure to barbeque some chicken for friends! This is great. And I used red curry paste also.

This was fantastic!! I took the advice of other reviewers and skipped the orange sauce. I made the marinade the night before and used a stick blender to make it smooth.

What a great recipe.. and all the ingredients were on hand. I cut the recipe in half (there are only two of us) successfully. I sauted the pork for about half the time and baked it for the full time. The pork was perfect. I was to conservative cutting the curry paste for the sauce. I would have used exactly half the amount. I scantd a little too much. This one has been added to my regular rotation of after work dinners. PS ... I think the curry base is typo.... its curry paste... I used my prime thai curry paste and the recipe worked fine. I have never heard of curry base... although my own Indian curry powder is esentially that.. a base curry and I augment it for different heat levels. JIm

Excellent! The sauce was awesome and spicy. Others who said it was mild must not have used the correct curry base. We found it in an envelope type package, with a plastic pouch inside. We did have a large jalapeno and added extra curry base, so that could have made a difference too. It was heavy on the orange flavor; I liked it yet could see mixing it with pineapple. We skipped the step to strain the sauce. And added cilantro leaves on top of the dish when served; added a great taste.

I made this dish for my husband before making it for a dinner party and it was DELICIOUS. I followed the recipe for the sauce exactly (except it too much longer than 12 minutes to reduce by 1/2). Before serving, I split the citrus sauce into two portions and added 2 tbs. of pnut butter (as suggested)to one portion - this way the guests could have their choice. Both were delicious, all plates were clean and everyone has asked for the recipe!!!

I loved the pork tenderloin. You could actually cut into it with the side of your fork. I will definitely make it again. I will skip the citrus sauce next time though. It was a little time consuming for the end product. It was good but not good enough. Next time I will reserve some of the pre-marinade for the sauce. I served this dish with Basmati rice pilaf and Asian braised green beans.

We did a Thai thanksgiving this year and replaced gravy with the sauce for this dish. We used butter as the original recipe called for and used a 50/50 mix of orange and pineapple juice. The sauce went very well with turkey, esp. white meat, giving it a nice tang that was not too hot.

I followed the advice of other cooks by using pineapple juice with the orange juice(I used 50/50 orange and pineapple)and also the coconut milk. I still found the sauce wanting so I added 2 T peanut butter and that did it. Very tasty.

I used a turkey tenderloin, grilled it for about 20 minutes on medium, used 2/3 pinapple juice and 1/3 orange juice, and coconut milk instead of butter. WONDERFUL!!!!!

It was the bomb. And tasted like ginger, too. And orange. MMMMMMMMMMMMMM. Make this, you won't regret it. Use the leftover sauce for something too. Not sure what, but I bet it would be good.

My boyfriend and I thought this dish was very good, however, I apparently used a very large jalepeno and a dash of hot curry---WOW. TOO hot. Other than that, delicious!! Will make again!

I made this easy entree for a cozy Saturday night dinner with dear friends and it was a hit! I followed most of the previous recommendations, but the key to this recipe is grilling the meat! We used our Weber kettle, charcoal-indirect method. The pork (3-3/4lb. boneless loin) became deliciously encrusted with the molasses marinade. Cooking time on the Weber was 1 hour, 15 minutes to reach meat temp. of 155 degrees. I served sugar snap peas and fried Basmati rice with scallions and pineapple. YUM!

took many reviewer's suggestions - 50/50 pinapple and orange juice, Cointreau in marinade, substitute coconut milk or butter in sauce. Turned out great. Only two things I'd like to improve next time (1) use spicy red curry paste (could NOT find red curry base and ended up with very oily, mild red curry paste) (2) boil the sauce to thicken after adding coconut milk.

Made this for the second time for a dinner party, to rave reviews. The pork was melt-in-your-mouth tender (I used a 3 1/2 pound boneless pork loin both times). As I didn't have carrots on hand either time, I just left them out and prepared the sauce only by cooking, and left out the straining stuff. Was a bit watery, so I'll try the coconut milk suggestions made by others. Wonderful with plain rice (the sauce is great over it!) and 3-cabbage slaw with ginger-soy dressing. All the pre-meal prep work makes this a great party recipe, so you can enjoy your company. A definite keeper.

I followed the previous recommendations and used part pineapple juice (or pureed pineapple) and coconut milk in lieu of butter. Very, very good and the heat factor did not overwhelm the one diner with the tender palate. Also, grilled the tenderloins and the molasses caramelized beautifully and really enhanced the pork. Recipe was very simple and required minimal work at the end.

Delicious, tender, flavourful. Made a thai salad and wild rice with it. Thoroughly enjoyed it.

We really we're pleased with the pork but I missed the advice to doctor up the sauce which seemed a little shallow -- I'll give it another try with coconut milk and we'll see what happens but the recipe is worth trying for the tenderloin alone

Rating: 3
Absolutely loved the pork ..... jury is still out on the sauce. Took suggestion and used half pineapple juice but still found it too citrus-y. Unfortunately we thought it took away from the incredible flavour of the meat. Next time I'll half the amount of juice and see how it fares. Butter is not necessary, but coconut milk makes for an interesting substitution.

I took previous advise and used 1/2 pineapple, 1/2 orange juice. I also used full amounts of red curry. The result was wonderful...a real treat!

The marinee for the pork was great. Really tasty. I stupidly did not follow the advice of others and have the oj with pineapple juice. The sauce was not so great. Next time I will try the pineapple juice and I think it will be the adjustment that it needs.

YUUUUMMMM!!! I made this for a date who challenged me to cook as well as his mother....take THAT, mom! (Now let's see if he can cook as well as I!) I just loved this. The flavor is awesome, and the dish itself is simple enough to prepare. The orange-curry sauce is just wonderful. I only used two tablespoons of butter, tho, and I think that is enough. Made jasmine rice and steamed some broccoli, also got a Thai salad dressing recipe for the salad that started this whole deal. For dessert, do the coconut-lime sorbet that is floating in this archive somewhere. Try it!

We loved this recipe. It was tender and the sauce had a lot of tang. I followed the advise of previous cooks and substituted pineapple juice for about half of the orange juice. I also used very hot Indian red curry sauce in place of the Thai red curry base. The sauce was definitely hot. It was so good, I froze what was leftover for future use.

Sauce makes the dish. I added some thai red chili paste for a little extra kick - seemed to work well (nice slow burn). Also used 2 cups of oj and 1 cup pineapple juice to tone down the prange flavor a bit (per some suggestions from other responses).

The marinated pork was just wonderful. We thought the sauce was OK - a little too sweet, too strong on the orange flavor.

This is a wonderful recipe, the melding of different tastes did a dance with my taste buds. i made a sticky rice to accompany this dish so as to capture all of the essence of the delicious sauce. this is an elegant, tasty dish worthy of an intimate meal or dinner party. it's a hit at our house.

I cut up a boneless leg of pork and used the marinade as a stir-fry sauce along with pearl onions, snow peas, and julienned carrots. Along with the sauce, the dish was a great success.

The sauce was too orangey (is that a word?) tasting. I may try it with pineapple juice for a more mellow taste.

A fantastic dish - sure to impress. Great flavor and spice. The sauce is also great on just about anything, including scrambled eggs!

Although the marinade for the pork is very good, the sauce is much too "citrusy", and adds vey little to the dish, in fact, detracting from the sweet, smoky flavor of the pork marinade.

Excellent!! Sauce would be good with chicken also. Will definitely make this one again!

I saved the marinade and basted the tenderloins several times in the skillet on the stove (turning them). I turned them once in the oven and basted them again. The result was received with great acclaim by my family and guests.

The marinade makes a tender & juicy pork, delicious sauce! A keeper that's sure to impress guests

This was a simple and delicious recipe, and is good for dinner parties because the sauce can be prepared ahead of time. I only used a quarter of the amount of butter the recipe calls for in the sauce. I substituted coconut milk for the butter and got a smooth creamy sauce with some pleasant sweetness. An excellent dish!

Delicious. Sliced mangos go well on the side. An update: Substitute three tiny Thai chilis (seeded) for the jalapen(y)o. Add 1/8 cup of Cointreau to the marinade. Wheeeeeeee! Try it yourself. Comments please.

This receipe was fabulous! We especially liked the marinade. It was also very easy to prepare. I took others suggestions and served the pork with Basmati rice with currants and pine nuts, and roasted red, yellow, green peppers. It was a great meal. I didn't find anyting called Thai red curry BASE so I used paste - it must have been the right ingredient.

The marinated pork alone was perfection. Even without the sauce you could use it for anything - it was just so juicy and delicious. My husband and I are not real fans of spicy food either so the sauce itself was an odd experience. It was spicy but, I can't say that I would change a single thing. It's definitely a keeper in my file.

My husband and I thought this recipe was fabulous. Good and spicy, though I might have thrown in extra base! I loved the mango suggestion, I fanned my slices out on the plate then placed the sliced pork over the base of the fan and poured the sauce over the pork. Excellent presentation and wonderful flavour!

I've done this over and over again. It's one of the best recipes I've ever made. What I like about this is I can prepare all ahead of time and then half an hour before the guests come I whip everything together. Be sure you make enough - everything will be gobbled up! Very good with Basmati Rice. And I add more butter than the recipe calls for (1 and a half sticks) - you got to sin every now and then!

Wonderful! Marinaded the pork for 24h and made the sauce (with only 1 T of butter) the day before. BBQ'd the pork for a crisp outside and a melt-in-your-mouth juicy & tender inside. Didn't realize 1 guest was a "pork-hater"...he loved the dish so much, he went home with the reciepe! Really goes well with asparagus.

This recipe was very flavorful and easy to make. I served it with steamed asparagus, and the sauce was fantastic on the asparagus as well as the pork. I would only try to reduce the amount of butter in the sauce - too much!

This recipe is simple and delicious. I served it with steamed Basmati rice. You can marinate the pork the night before and also do the sauce ahead of time. I did it several times, and the sauce is a bit sweeter when using baby carrots. Great recipe!
