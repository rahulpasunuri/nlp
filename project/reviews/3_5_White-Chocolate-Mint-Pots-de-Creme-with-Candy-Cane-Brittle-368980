I really wanted to love this, but I didn't care for the savory flavor that the fresh mint gave the custard. If I make this again, I plan to rely on peppermint extract, or even creme de menthe, for the mint flavor.

I loved this, and found it easy to make. Everyone raved. I also had lots of the brittle left over, but that doesn't seem to be a problem!

I made this recipe twice over the holidays and it was delicious! Everyone loved it. The bark was especially amazing. I loved the texture of the chocolate wafers in the bark. I found it didn't make quite enough custard for 8 ramekins but it is quite rich so small portions are fine. The recipe also makes more white chocolate ganache and bark than is needed so you could reduce the recipe if you don't want left overs (we loved the extra bark). This recipe does use a lot of white chocolate but I think it's worth it for a special dessert. The fresh mint is key. I added some creme de menthe liqueur for some green colour but it's not necessary. I will definitely make this again.

I made this for my annual ladies' luncheon and it was a HUGE hit--everyone was saying it was one of the best desserts they'd ever had. A couple of minor adjustments--I skipped the mint steeping step and simply upped the peppermint extract to about 3/4 t. Also, I only brought the milk/cream to a simmer (not a boil) once, then added chocolate, then eggs. Worked just fine. I sprinkled the dust from the crushed peppermints on top before serving. The bark was super-easy to make. I omitted the chocolate wafers because I couldn't find them, but I will probably try them sometime in the future. And unlike the other reviewer, I guess I just didn't think having extra peppermint bark around was a big problem!

The custard was very smooth and creamy and surprisingly, the dessert was not overly sweet despite all of the white chocolate. The fresh mint provided an interesting herbaceous flavour but even in combination with the extract, the mint was still very subtle. (I would have preferred it stronger). You need less than 1/4 of the brittle recipe for the 8 servings....the rest is extra. The recipe tasted just okay, was very expensive to make and yielded a lot of dirty dishes. I think there may be better white chocolate mint recipes out there.
