All in all this was a delicious pie but because we like a higher filling to pecan ratio I followed the advice to double the filling while keeping the pecans the same. I had almost 2 cups excess that wouldn't fit into my deep dish crust! If you follow the recipe and take it to the ribbon stage it expands in volume and makes enough filling to not have to double the recipe.

If I don't make this pie for Thanksgiving every year I get in big trouble with my family. It is delicious and more complex than traditional pecan pie. It is very sweet and rich, not for the faint at heart. I recommend doubling the filling to make for a deeper caramel center and toasting the pecans prior to baking.

Most unusual. I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. It's much less gooey than conventional pecan pies, and surprisingly less rich than dark chocolate pecan pies I have made. And it looks great.

I made this for Thanksgiving. There was not enough gooey filling, I even doubled the filling. It was too dry.

I printed this recipe to prepare for Thanksgiving 2004 and got too busy. I made it for the first time the following week. I was amazed at how delicious it was. I had never been much of a pecan pie fan, but I wanted to try something different. I have baked it for several occasions since then and have been told to name my price for baking it for a friend. On one occasion I used white chocolate chips instead of premium white chocolate and it was a bit crunchy. I remedied that by placing it in the microwave for about 10 seconds. It became caramel-like and was perfect. I did not think that it was as sweet as traditional pecan pies.

I made this for Christmas Day. Everyone loved it. I served it with Bryers natural vanilla ice cream. But I made changes to live up to a 4 fork rating. Made my own german deep dish pie crust. Added more chocolate. (ghirardelli white chips). Baked it less for 30min. then 15min. covered. Did not drizzle chocolate on top. We liked liked that it wasn't as rich, and liked all the pecans. Make more filling,add less pecans if desire is to be richer. We thought it was perfect.

This recipe was just okay. I doubled the amount of filling per recommendation of other reviewers. It tasted very much like a regular pecan pie. In fact, I have had better traditional pecan pie. You could not taste the white chocolate at all. I have had an excellent white chocolate pecan pie at a local restaurant and I guess I just expected it to taste too much like that one or something? Would not make this again.

I can't believe this is the same recipe! I'm a pretty good baker, but when I made this it was hard as a rock, and we couldn't tell there was any white chocolate in it. I followed the recipe to the letter, so I don't know why it turned out so different from the other reviewers'. I can't even give it one fork - we threw it away!

As a non-cook, this recipe was VERY easy to follow, and was absolutely delicious. Was praised as the best pecan pie ever consumed at my Thanksgiving dinner.

This is easy even for beginners. I took the advice of previous reviewers and doubled the "goo." I didn't double the nuts or the white chocolate. I used a store bought crust and it turned out perfectly. Chewy, gooey, and so festive!

I have made this pie every year since I first saw it in the Nov. 1999 issue. Even family members who don't like pecan pie love this one. It's a staple in our family now.

my husband said it was the best pecan pie he had ever tasted! this is delicious..I thought it was a but nutty, I will prob decrease the amount of pecans next time. It is great if you like a very sweet pie.

I double the filling on this recipe and it is fantastic. Each time I make it someone asks for the recipe. Never enough left for seconds, unfortunatly.

I would make changes the next time I try this recipe, including making more filling (we like the goo inside a traditional pecan pie) and serving it warm. At room temperature, the "pie" was more like a big chewy candy cookie.

This was one of the best pecan pies I have ever had. Not the Mrs. Smiths variety, but crunchier and more solid, like a torte almost. Very dense and full...this is a keeper for the rest of our lives. Everyone loved it so much, the pie was gone in one night.

I love pecans; I love white chocolate; I did not love this pie (nor did any of my family). The problem, I think, was that it was incredibly dry. My family prefers a "gooier" pecan pie than this recipe created.

I loved this pie. As a rule, I am not wild about traditional pecan pie. The white chocolate changes the pie just enough, that I truly enjoyed it. I will add this to my holiday repertoire.

I followed the directions exactly (except I used only light corn syrup) and the pie was a bit dry. It was delicious though and the presentation with the drizzled white chocolate and the pecan edging was beautiful.

Great pie. It cooked very quickly though, and I just saved it from being overdone. Start checking it early. It the best tasting pie at Thanksgiving. Especially good for people who like a firmer pecan pie.

I have made this Pecan Pie every year since I saw the recipie in Bon Appetit in 1999. It is a huge request from my family members every holiday. It is not too difficult to make.

Rating: 3
The ease of this recipe deserves 4 forks, and overall 3-1/2 forks. The 2 changes that I made to this recipe was to use all dark corn syrup, and white chocolate chips. I also skipped the chocolate drizzles and additional pecans around the edge. Another very good pecan pie recipe on this site is with Kahlua and chocolate chips. After making both I'd have to say that I prefer this one. The white chocolate doesn't make it overly sweet. I don't hesitate to recommend both.

I am soooo happy I found this recipe on your website. I have made it multiple times after discovering it in your magazaine, but had since misplaced it. This is a very simple recipe, easy ingredients to have on hand, easy to make on short notice. It is my husband's favorite pecan pie by a large margin. He tells everyone about it and now, once again, I can back up his rave reviews with the real thing.

Very easy to make and a very nice presentation. I used a prepared pie crust instead of making from scratch. Everyone that tried the pie said it was really good. I've already had one request to make this pie again.

Fabulous! Everyone raved about it, and it disappeared faster than a regular pecan pie that I made.

I used a 9" and it cooked too fast, therefore was a little dry. The white chocolate is difficult to melt for topping. Next time I will use an 8" and I am sure it will be delicious.

Very sweet. Very rich. Very good We all loved to eat this one with a cup of warm coffee, or tea. Reminded me of the things my grandmother would make for the holidays.
