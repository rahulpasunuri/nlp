Made it for Christmas dinner and everyone really loved it. Will be making this roast again.

To respond to the timing concern, I used this recipe for timing a 6 lb boneless rib roast (tho used the herb rub from the "Herbed Rib Roast" recipe - Gourmet, Dec 2000). The timing worked for me (350, 1.75 hours). I let the roast stand at room temp for 1 hour before roasting, put the roast up on a rack in the roasting pan and let the roast rest for 30 minutes before carving. The recipe doesn't specify all these things, but they likely make a difference. Also note, this is a boneless roast recipe - try the Herbed Rib Roast recipe mentioned above if you have a bone-in roast. Hope this helps! Our Christmas roast was fabulous!

While the recipe is delicious, the timing seems to be off. We've made this twice in two different ovens. Each time the meat required substantially more cooking time. Last night I put the roast (5 lb, smaller than the recipe)in a 350 oven (internal temp 39 degrees) After 1 hour it was at 66 deg, after 1.5 hours, 88 degrees. In order to get dinner out, I upped the temp to 400 Convection and the meat finished cooking--too hot for the garlic on the outside, but I kept watch so the garlic didn't burn. In a previous attempt, we had two 4.5 lb roasts which took well over 2.5 hours. Great flavor, will make again, but at least for me, the times were way off.

Made this last night for dinner and it was delicious! The whole house smelled so good! I halved the recipe; still need to work on the proper amount of cooking time (is it 15 minutes per pound? for med. rare?) This dish is a winner! Also used olive oil instead of margarine.

Excellent and it makes wonderful leftovers.

My husband and son really loved this roast! This roast is so easy to make that I prepared it while I was cooking dinner the night before. We had Caesar Salad to start followed by the roast with baby red potatoes and a spring vegetable mix and some fresh warm homemade bread. Yummy! How yummy? After dinner (where he ate thirds!), my husband went to the living room, put in a classical CD, and enjoyed a glass of some sort of foul-smelling after dinner drink, and he usually NEVER does this!

This was suprisingly delicious, it also looked beautiful once it was done and made the whole house smell wonderful. I shoved garlic chunks into the meat prior to cooking also so you got garlic in every bite.

Having a smaller roast I cut back on the spices called for and it turned out just fine. I don't usually cook roasts because the meat is so dry, but this turned out great and I will try this recipe again. Easy to follow instructions for a good dinner!

Delicious and impressive for party. An 8 lb. roast was just enough for 10 people.

This is a great meal for guests! It's easy and I'll be making this again in the near future.

I made this for our pot luck group in Madison, Wisconsin, and was it a big hit with all 18 people. It is perfect for our Wisconsin winters, and a good main dish for a pot luck group, as it is easy for people to choose items to go with it. I then told everone about epicurious.com.

This roast was delicious and impressive-looking, yet simple to make. We only marinated the roast for about 2 hours due to time constraints and the flavors were still fabulous.

An absolutely wonderful roast. I basted the roast with Cabernet Sauvignon while roasting. My husband wouldn't share the leftovers!

Made recipe 11/28/99. It was made precisely as directed. The family raved about it. Of course, using prime rib didn't hurt matters any. I plan to duplicate again this coming New Years day.

Have made this recipe several times and it's always a hit. Have used both rib roasts and ribeye (boneless) roasts and both are delicious. Going to try one cooked on indirect heat on the grill next! Great served with garlic mashed potatoes or double stuffed baked potatoes and horseradish sauce. Yummm!!!

I made this as the main course for Christmas and it was absolutely delicious! I made it with the Cabernet Jus from the Prime Rib with Cabernet Jus recipe that I found here also. Wanting leftovers, I bought too much, but had nothing left over!!
