This was absolutely outstanding and withstood a finicky French dinner party on New Year's day. They were all swiping up the sauce on their plates with bread (an ultimate French compliment to the cook!) I put this in special plates and added salmon eggs to the center with a dolip of extra caviar. It was gorgeous! I'll definitely make this again - but for special holidays only.

I thought this dish was excellent, I tweaked the recipe just a little, with the addition of Saffron, a touch of a sweet german white whine, and a little orange zest for color, and a bit of a sweeter flavour than the lemon called for in the recipe. that is enough to compliment the natural flavours of the scallops and caviar.

Although the scallops were creamy, the sauce was boring. No real flavor to mention. For the work, the end result was not worth it. I would not make this again.
