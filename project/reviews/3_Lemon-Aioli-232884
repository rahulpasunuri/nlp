I love this recipe--it may not be the authentic Aioli but its still awesome--I make a 1/2 recipe and use 1/2 c OO and 1/2 Grapeseed oil --I use Meyer lemons when in season worth the effort!

Well, the name of the recipe caught my attention, but frankly, i don't see what in it could allow it to be called Aioli. It coudl be more like an olive oil hollandaise... It looks like it could be delicious, but you see, I am provencale, and I don't know of any real provencal person who would use mustard in Aioli. This sauce is a traditional dish in South East France, where I am from. Since this sauce is an emulsion based on oil, it often mistaken for a mayonnaise the way it is made in the rest of France. The traditionnal way of making it is without mustard, without cooking and sometimes, without egg yolk. The trick is to make a very fine garlic puree in a mortar and flow the olive oil very slowly. This is the emulsion that will make the aioli. It pobably is good with some lelom zest added at the very end, but without the cooking, without so much egg yolk and without the mustard. It will be lighter, easier to digest and closer to the olive tree and the cicadas with the pastis.

Tasty aioli. Didn't cook on stovetop, just blended the heck out of it in my food processor.

I made this in the food processor and then cooked it in a double boiler until it thickened. I'm planning on using it as a sandwich spread. I also added a bit of sugar and oregano.

Very, very nice! Drizzled over toasted baguette slices rubbed w/garlic, but could use this in many different capacities. Cheers!

Good stuff. I love aioli in any form, but the lemon really gives this an extra zing. I made it with poached salmon. Would go well with veggies, or as a dip for chilled shrimp.
