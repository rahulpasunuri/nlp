I've made this many times and guests always love it. I generally use blackberries rather than cherries because their flavor is more reliable, they don't have to be pitted and they're available pretty much year- round, at least in Southern California.

I made this recipe with walnut oil and walnut and pecans. If you put the nuts in a food processor or blender, the smaller the pieces the better. They adhere to the cheese very well. The salad was a real hit, the taste is wonderful. If you want the cheese rounds to cut well, use thread.

Next time, I think I'll try smashing the almonds a bit - perhaps if they were in smaller pieces they would stick better. And the dressing is a bit thick - I'll try the balsamic vinegar suggestion next time.

since we're not fond of goat cheese, I replaced it by aged asiago toasts and added the toasted almonds to the salad. Even my four-year old thought it was fabulous!

Delicious salad, but I had trouble getting the almonds to stick to the cheese rounds. Does anyone have hints for overcoming this??

Great salad, very impressive. Served it with a simple herb-roasted rack of lamb for a dinner party and everyone loved it! Simple, elegant dinner.

I've made this twice now for guests and both times have gotten rave reviews. The warm goat cheese is a really special touch - not hard but very impressive to guests!

Overall, quite tasty! Didn't think that the fennel was necessary and the cherries made it interesting...but in So. Ca. the cherries are juicy but not very flavorful? I think this salad would be exceptional with sour cherries!

Fabulous! I added extra olive oil and used sweet baby greens. Would be perfect for a dinner party. Lovely dressing. Straight out of a fine restaurant.

Cheese was great, greens were perfect with cherries and fennel, dressing seemed too sparse and a bit dry so I added a little white balsamic vinegar and a little extra oil. Got rave reviews!

I made this salad with spring greens and bing cherries. It was a real hit. I found the dressing a bit skimpy so I added more oil and lemon juice.

I have had these goat cheese rounds on a spinach salad, only they were crusted with toasted pecan pieces. Delicious!

I sent this recipe to a friend of mine for her dinner party, which I fortunetly got to attend. And it was a total success. I think this salad would also go very well with dried cherries! I love those. Or dried blueberries.

Also meant to say that I only had macadamia nuts and used those for the goat cheese. They were delicious. Keep a close eye on the cheese rounds, the bottoms of ours were almost too brown. We used the leftovers the next day, crumbled on a salad. Very rich but if you like cheese....you'll like these!

I thought it was a weird sounding combo of items but they really, really worked together. I only had corn oil and that worked fine. Grapes would be good with this, too, as pitting cherries is a pain! But they tasted yummy.

Served this salad at a dinner party last night. As suggested, prepared the dressing and goat cheese ahead and kept in fridge until needed. Used the juice (2 tablespoon) and zest from a Meyer lemon as they're less acidic and I love the flavor and olive oil. Don't have roasted almond oil in my pantry. Every one loved the salad!! I'll definitely make it again while cherries are in season. Might also try other fresh fruit.
