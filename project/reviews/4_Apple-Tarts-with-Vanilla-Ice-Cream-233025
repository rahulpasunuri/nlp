So simple and delicious! My boyfriend loves apple tarts and was delighted with this version. I used an all butter puff pastry, which made a huge difference. Last time I made an apple tart I used Pepperidge Farm puff pastry which is made with oil rather than butter. My boyfriend could tell the difference even though I didn't say anything. The crust was crisp, flaky, and had that wonderful butter taste. I topped the tart with homemade vanilla ice cream, which made it all the much more amazing. Mmmmmm!

What a beautiful and delicious treat! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. Wouldn't change a thing... except maybe I'd make double the syrup so we could spoon some on top of the ice cream! I'm trying this with pears next.

Great tarts, I make them often. I like them even better with a few little tweaks. I add a layer of sweetened cream cheese and a little pomegranate juice to the syrup for extra flavor and color. For the details on that, check here: http://www.spoonlicker. com/?p=8

This dessert was a hit with kids and adults because it was so delicious and a hit with me because it was so easy to make (I like to cook, not bake, so this recipe was super). Because of other readers' comments about burned pastry edges, I brushed the pastry with butter only (not the syrup) and baked the dessert at 400F for 15 minutes then 350F for 15 minutes. The crust was beautifully golden - no charring at all. Also added some cinnamon (as suggested by others) which gave it a great aroma when baking. Apples, cinnamon, ice cream and easy to make - how can you go wrong?

This was delicious on its own (I had leftovers for breakfast), and was perfect with vanilla ice cream. It was incredibly easy to make for something so good. The edges did get too dark in places, but I used a small hand-held grater to gently scrape off the burned parts and you couldn't tell the difference.

Good idea but needs work. First, the timing/temperature seem to be too high and too long. Second, brushing the edges with the syrup made the edges black and, even with tenting, there was no saving it. We cut the edges off and had it for breakfast. It was okay, but needs more flavor (cinnimon, allspice, nutmeg, etc.).

This was beautiful, delicious and fairly easy to make. A HUGE hit at a recent dinner party. I did sprinkle some cinnamon on top before baking. Would definitely make again.
