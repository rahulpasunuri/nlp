I must add my voice to the cooks who rave about this gratin. Every time I make it, I am asked for the recipe, so now I always have a few extra copies available. Simply scrumptious! P.S. Also good with chard.

I LOVE this recipe! I always look at recipes like the pirates code... more like guidelines! The first time I made this I had spinach and butternut squash so I looked for something new to try use the ingredients. I didn't follow the recipe too closely as I used what (the amounts) I had etc. It was FABULOUS! So, I made it for Thanksgiving hoping I hadn't strayed too far from the recipe the first time to repeat the delicious dish. It was to die for good! I used butternut squash chunks rather than the slices but oh so good! Enjoy!

My Secret is Out! I have been making this recipe for 6 years now. Every Thanksgiving my family has one demand. That this dish is on the table. The Great thing is that the kids love it as well. A quick tip is to cut the squash the night before to save on time and space. It's easy and fun to make. Give it a shot and be the crowd favorite at Thanksgiving!

I thought this was super tasty and very easy to make! Like a few other reviewers I added cheese between every layer of squash. A small change to start: I sauteed garlic and onion in the butter on low-med heat, added only 1/2 cup heavy cream (pantry was sparse!), a flour-water mixture of about 3 tbsp each, then stirred in the raw spinach and killed the heat after about 1 minute. The texture was a little thick at first but once the spinach released its water it became super creamy. I was very generous in the seasoning and thought the dish quite flavorful.

I opted out on boiling my fresh spinach and put it in at the end of the cooking of the onion and garlic to wilt (why not?) one less step. My spinach:squash portions were off & I used sour cream combined with coconut milk creamer to substitute for heavy cream and it was still amazing! The point I would like to convey that I haven't seen in other reviews is how much the squash simulates a lasagna texture. It was hard to decifer that it was squash, it seemed like a pasta. I will keep making to perfect it....very lovely combination of flavors and textures.

This is so good! I made this for a potluck and it was the first thing to go. Really yummy as written. I made it again and didn't have enough spinach, but had a bag of frozen artichoke hearts. I coarsely chopped those to replace 1/2 of the spinach, and it was incredible. I also used more cheese, because everything is better with extra parmesan! Next time I am going to sprinkle some panko and maybe a handful of toasted pecans on top. I will definitely make this repeatedly all Fall.

I took this to neighborhood pot luck and brought home empty dish! I did not have quite enough heavy cream so added combo of sour cream and milk to have enough liquid to make juicy enough and it worked fine. Used thawed squeezed dry frozen spinach-don't think there is any need to use the fresh for this type of preparation unless you just have some on hand. Used a mix of parm and very sharp cheddar for the top-delicious!

Sorry, but we were disappointed, as we expected more flavor given the past reviews. Will not be making again.

4 stars because as far as gratins go, this one's a keeper! I tried this recipe for Christmas and got excellent feedback from my guests! A few notes: The recipe serves 10; I made the recipe twice (for 14 as part of a buffet), and there was almost an entire gratin left over that everyone wanted to take home. I used a total of 5 pounds fresh spinach but frozen would work just as well in this case. The butternut squash was very tough to peel/slice. I made slices using a de Buyer mandoline and found it more attractive to cut the squash into rectangular blocks before slicing, which made arranging the slices easy and neat. Also, I prepared the gratins covered in parchment and then tin foil 1 day in advance and let them return to room temp before cooking. The parmesan seems to be missing from the recipe, but I sprinkled the top layer generously to create a bubbling crust. I recommend and will make again.

Rating: 3
I used frozen chopped kale in place of the spinach, just because thats what I had on hand. This was very good and easy to put together, I cut enough long strips to make the top look nice..the rest I put through the cuisinart. I assembled it in the morning and baked it before serving. I would definitely make this for Thanksgiving.

Rating: 4
i made this for a movie night with friends. everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. i didn't have a slicer so i just cut the squash with a knife into noodle-esque strips. i used 3lbs of spinach from the farmers market. next time i'll probably use more and might even use frozen since it doesn't loose it's nutrients.

I got fresh butternut squash at a local farmer's stand and made this for my vegetarian daughter in law and granddaughter. I also made it for a church potluck. Everyone was very impressed and wanted the recipe. I did use more Parmesan and sprinkled between the layers. I also used frozen spinach and it works well as long as you drain it. Whomever suggested micro-waving the squash for 3 minutes before peeling and slicing is a genius! Thanks!

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe twice, and it was delicious both times. This time I added chopped, roasted hazelnuts to the parmesan (and increased the parmesan) to make a crust. I also threw in some sharp cheddar below, to make it more like a lasagne. When sauteeing the onions and garlic, I added some chopped sage and three habaneros from the yard. That was two habaneros too many! But overall, the chiles, sage and hazelnuts added good flavor, and the extra cheese made it more fun.

I just made this last week for Thanksgiving and it was amazing. My family absolutely loved it! I actually had to slice the squash by hand (which although time consuming, I don't mind too much)and used frozen spinach. I managed to do 4 layers and had A LOT of squash left over. Maybe I should have used more or used extra large squashes? I didn't do cheese in between the layers and didn't really think it needed it. I pretty much followed the recipe to the T, and it was delicious. I may be making it again for Christmas this year, any potluck and many times again. It is amazing!

I've made this for two Thanksgivings in a row and it has been a big hit both times. The cheese and spinach perfectly compliment the flavor of the butternut squash. I followed this recipe exactly but added a little extra nutmeg which helped boost the flavor a bit more.

My husband and I made this one together, and loved it! Glad to hear the suggestion to microwave the squash as that's the most onerous part of the recipe. We didn't add extra cheese or cream and still loved it -- found it so delicious to almost be a dessert. So...if you're watching calories, the recipe as written is terrific.

Made this for the first time and got rave reviews. Used 4lbs of fresh spinach since other reviewers said the spinach mix was too scanty. Used an aged parmigiano reggiano on every layer, also as recommended by others. Microwaved squash for several minutes to make slicing easier. This was fabulous. Next time I will use frozen spinach though. Took me an hour to pull hard stems off 4lbs of fresh! spinach!

So good. A great filling side. The recipe doesn't call for cheese but i used some Parmesan and shredded mozzarella on each layer and thought it was a good touch. i thought the 1 cup of cream wasn't going to be enough but it turned out perfectly.

Despite the name, this dish was not creamy at all, and tasted fresh and light compared the the other dishes (I made it for thanksgiving dinner). I used a food processor for the squash, and frozen spinach. Also, I think I cooked it longer than the recipe said. Everyone loved it and requested it again for next year.

I brought this to a dinner party Saturday and got raves; it was served with a ham and was a good change from the usual potato side dish. Instead of fresh spinach and cream, I used 3 packages of frozen creamed spinach: Cooked them for about 6 minutes in boiling water, then added the onion and garlic (cooked in butter) and the nutmeg. There was more than enough spinach and sauce to layer in between slices of two squashes. It came out of the oven very creamy.

Rating: 0
I've made this twice in the past two months, both times to rave reviews. I'm also going to make it this week for Christmas. For me, the slicer blade on my food processor makes quick work of thinly slicing the squash. Unless I'm missing something, the recipe only mentions the parmesan cheese in the "forward". I've added a bit between layers in addition to the topping, about 3 oz. in total. Also, it worked great as a "make ahead". I assembled two days before T-giving and waited to bake until the day of; it turned out perfectly.

This dish received rave reviews at a recent holiday potluck. I added about 3/4 cup grated romano, which I sprinkled over each layer of the spinach mixture. I've also made this dish with sweet potatoes instead of butternut squash and had great results.

This is my second year making this, and we LOVE it!!! It will be a staple on our Thanksgiving table. I use a mandolin to slice the squash and yes the spinach may seem a bit sparse, but you don't need that much between layers...I made two and kept one in the fridge uncooked for 3 days for when we had our second Thanksgiving and it was just as good!!! Everyone at our tables raved about this dish

Big hit on Thanksgiving. Family loved it and requested for next year. I will make more of the spinach mixture next time. As others mentioned had to spread very thin, only made three layers. Also, used some Gruyère that was on hand as well. My husband helped me cut the squash by hand, pretty sure I am now getting a mandoline for Christmas!

This is the best squash casserole I've ever had. It was a hit at Thanksgiving. I made a half recipe. I had a package of frozen creamed spinach and used it in combination with some fresh, and it was fine. I also used more parmesan cheese on top and sprinkled some on each layer.

This is a great recipe. I made it for Thanksgiving Dinner that included at least one vegetarian and everyone loved it! I used fresh baby spinach and did not think it was necessary to blanch and chop it first. The most challenging part was slicing the squash into the 1/8 pieces. Next time I will use a slicer of some kind. I added more cheese in each layer and Highly rcommend doing this! Other than that I didn't alter the recipe at all! We will definitely be making this again for Christmas!

Re: PYREX question.....I didn't know the answer to this either, but when I went to purchase a "non" glass dish in order to make this recipe (yesterday, I am making it now - it's in the oven!) - the glass pyrex dishes specify "NO BROILING" - which is one of the options at the end of the recipe.....so maybe if you choose to bake it longer as opposed to broiling, it will be ok....just a thought....good luck!

to A Cook 11/21/08: the parm amount comes out if you print the recipe. It says 1/2 oz finely grated (1/4 c); however, many reviewers encouraged using more. Now: can anyone tell me why the instruction not to use a glass 13x9 baking pan? The only ones this size I really ever use are Pyrex. I would think that would be ok. I want to make for Thanksgiving side--please help quickly!

This was excellent... It will be a perfect addition to any fall meal. Didn't have lemon pepper so just used salt and pepper for seasoning. Also did use sherry rather than wine, it added such a nice full flavor. Skipped the cream all together and the sauce was still wonderful. I had about one cup of shredded Gruyere type cheese and sprinkled a bit of it between each layer because I could! Served this with Chicken Bacon Roulades also from this site. I'm planning on making this again for Thanksgiving.

Thanks to previous reviewers I microwaved the squash for 2 minutes which made peeling and slicing so much easier. Also followed others' suggestion to grate extra parmesan and sprinkle after each spinach layer. I increased baking time slightly and consequently didn't need to brown the top. This is delicious and going into my rotation of go-to recipes.

I have now made this dish many times for dinner parties. Each time it receives lavish praise. Use fresh loose baby spinach leaves for the best taste. It seems like you're buying a lot of spinach but it boils down to a very small volume. It pays to really squeeze out the spinach or else the dish comes out watery. The one drawback of this dish is that it is a bit time consuming. Peeling butternut squash is a chore, and even with a cuisinart, the dish does take a while to prepare. I only make it for special occasions and I make it ahead in the morning. It takes much longer to cook than the recipie says - allot about an hour or more. You don't want the squash to come out tough.

This was sooo good. I had some butternut squash that I had grown and needed to use. I halved the recipe, used bagged fresh spinach which I blanched for 5-7 minutes. I used whole cream and beat an egg and nutmeg into it and poured over. Baked about 45 minutes. Like other reviewers I added the cheese between layers and on top. This was so so good I will make it again and again. I'm thinking potluck suppers when I need to impress!

Made this thanksgiving with Ted Allen's Thanksgiving menu. The gratin was delicious. I too added parm in between layers based on reviews. Are you kidding about using a mandoline??? I started this way and quickly switched over to the food processor. Food processor on smallest slice mode was immensely faster, easier, and produced more uniform slices. I also used frozen spinach in the bag (not the block of spinach) which needed very little squeezing to remove water. I'd recommend this if you have bags instead of boxes of frozen spinach available. When making the layers, I'd recommend very light layers, mostly of 'globs' of spinach with space between them. It's the squash on squash action in between layers which allows the gratin to set and not slide all over the place because of a large spinach layer. I prepared the day before, let sit at room temp about an hour before cooking. I also used a convection oven, so cooking time was less, not more, than recommended. I loved it, but if you have some folks who just don't like sweet dishes, you might want to have some mashed potatoes on hand just in case. Will DEFINITELY make this again.

I halved the recipe and cooked it in a 9x9 pan. The only changes I made were to sprinkle a light dusting of Parm. cheese on each layer and I used half and half. It was delicious! I served it as a main course but probably wouldn't do that again since it wasn't terribly hearty. It would make a great side dish. I also had to bake it about 10 minutes longer than stated for it to be tender, based on reviews I am guessing the cooking time as written is off in this recipe.

This gratin was the bomb!! I served it at an elegant dinner party alongside the Beef Tenderloin with Red Wine Sauce and instead of serving just plain creamed spinach. I loved this dish as much as the tenderloin. One of my guests who didn't eat red meat was so grateful that this dish was served. She had thirds and raved about it all night. I would definitely serve this again probably at thanksgiving. My 7 year old daughter gave it a try and said it tasted so good it was like candy. I followed the recipe exactly except I sliced the squash in the food processor to shorten prep time. I used two bags of fresh spinach and one box of frozen and it worked fabulously well. Definitely squeeze the water out the best you can! Good luck and give this one a try!

Just made this for Thanksgiving. Wow!! I was completely taken by the flavour and richness of this dish. I used buttercup squash, cooked it whole in the microwave and scooped out the flesh for the layers.(makes this dish less labour intensive). As all the others reviews stated, I also added extra cheese after each layer of spinach. This is a keeper! My guests raved about it and guests that didn't like squash even had two helpings. A must at every gathering!

I "weight watcher-ized" this recipe (and changed it a bit), with fantastic results. The same unique, delicious taste with a fraction of the calories and fat. (Note: I also halved this recipe, so the quantities are for ½ the recipe). First, I sautéed the onions and garlic in Pam. Second, I cubed the butternut squash and par boiled in vegetable broth. I then steamed the spinach in vegetable broth. Then for the creamed spinach, I used all the recommended seasonings (plus a dash of splenda, I like sweet vegetables). I then substituted ¼ cup fat free half and half for the heavy cream, and added 1 tablespoon parmesan and mixed well. I then stirred in the butternut squash and placed the entire mixture into a casserole dish and sprinkled with 1 tablespoon grated parm and cooked as directed. Delicious, and I dont miss the butter or heavy cream or fat.

We don't get fresh spinach where I live very often, so the other day I bought three large bags. This was a great way to use it. I didn't have cream, in fact fresh cream is not optainable here, however I mixed in a little flour with my slightly cooked onions and made a roux, then added chicken broth and whole milk to make a light white sauce. I then followed the recipe as written. The sweetness of the squash really does something to that spinach! We all loved it. This would make a great Thanksgiving side dish.

This is an excellent side dish - easy, delicious and just says 'eat me' the minute it's out of the oven. I made it exactly as written (but probably used a bit more cheese). A sharp carving knife worked fine without a mandoline. Next time I make it I plan to try substituting the cream for low fat ricotta cheese ;-)

I have to give it 4 forks because it is so delicious and so versatile. Made it for the third time last night - have added a touch of jalapeno, and extra garlic and cheese. Last night I added some sliced almonds on top. You just can't go wrong with this one! A yummy keeper.

What a pleasant surprise! Like an earlier poster, I was concerned that I didn't have enough spinach, but once the squash cooks down, the spinach takes over. I also sprinkled Parmesan over each spinach layer. This really does take two foods you might not think twice about and, putting them together, makes something truly excellent. (I did use a glass baking dish, although I didn't broil it, so perhaps that is not a concern as long as it doesn't go under the broiler for long.)

Although my rule is not to deviate from the receipe the first time I make it, I did this time. I roasted the squash in the oven then mashed it--seems less labor intensive then slicing. Layered the mashed squash with the spinach mixture. Didn't have parm so I used swiss cheese instead between the layers. Turned out perfect! Will definitely make this again.

SENSATIONAL!!! I, too, added parmiagiano reggiano to the spinach mixture to give it a little more flavor. I wasn't able to get four layers out of it because there wasn't enough spinach mixture.

I thought I had regular frozen spinach instead oI only had creamed. So, I didn't start out right. Then, I had purchased precut butternut squash in chunks instead of slices. Didn't matter. This was delicious. I still cooked garlic and onion, then added creamed spinach with about 1/4 of cream. Layered the spinach and butternut chunks, topped with slices of acorn squash. I served in on top of polenta made with milk instead of water with about three tablespoons of shredded fresh parmesan cheese. I used one cup of dry polenta to four cups liquid. Better than dessert - which doesn't mean it was sweet, just delectable.

Too bad there's not a zero fork option! I adore Epicurious but this was hands down the biggest dissapointment. I made it for Thanksgiving and only 1 out of 8 had anything positive to say about this dish. Next time I'll try the ROASTED ACORN SQUASH WITH CHILE VINAIGRETTE.

I'm supposed to eat a low-fat diet, so I substituted soy milk instead of heavy cream and olive oil instead of butter. I'm sure the butter and cream would have made it much better! I cooked the dish the night before, and reheated it before serving. That was necessary because the actual cooking time was more than an hour, twice as long as the recipe indicated. If you use frozen spinach, be sure to leave extra time for it to thaw.

Extremely delectable. Really Really Good. I used half and half instead of heavy cream, and maybe a bit extra parmesan (I added a little to each layer) . No need to go buy a slicer...a couple of minutes in the microwave made slicing the squash very thin as easy as pie. I also assembled it the day before and baked it right before the party. It is now requested for christmas dinner. Also great for the vegetarians in our midst at holiday dinners.

This was, suprisingly, very good. The nutmeg is a must. I caramelized some onions and garlic and then I added some cream amd the chopped spinach and then reduced the cream a little to thicken it. The cream soaked into the pumpkin when it was baking and it turned out wonderfully.

I was sceptical because I couldn't see how the spinach and butternut squash would work together, but everybody else rated it 4 forks so I thought what the heck I'll try something new. I made it for dinner tonight and it was SO GREAT. I used a cheese sclicer for the butternut squash and 4 boxes of frozen spinach and a bit more heavy cream. I made three layers of squash and two of spinach. I can't wait to host a dinner and show off this creative recipe.

Love this recipe. I've mutiplied it for a big T'day group and halved it for a small, homey setting. Didn't have cream once so used evaporated milk instead; not quite the same, but no one really complained. As to the mandoline; attend your next state or county fair. I picked up an orange plastic one for $20 bucks years ago at the local state fair and it does a great job. It's not a real, watch-your-knuckles peice of equipment, it does a fine job for this recipe and others which require slicing.

This colorful dish was the winner at Thanksgiving! With no mandoline, I painstakingly sliced the squash. Time-consuming, but successful. I, too, ended up with extra squash(I'll be looking for a soup recipe). Using frozen spinach resulted in somewhat thin layers. However, the balance of the finished product was good. With cheese, more is more, so I doubled the parmesan -- great result!

Not only would I be happy to make this dish again exactly as the recipe has it; I'm scheming for the next opportunity! Everyone aged 4 to 80 loved it. The mandoline is important, and all you need is to spend $20 max at an Asian market to get one that works great. I use mine almost daily for slicing vegetables. The only improvement I would suggest is that the proportion of spinach to squash is inaccurate--I had tons of squash left over and will only use 1 squash to 3 boxes spinach next time. I anticipated wanting extra cheese but this was rich and piquant without it.

Rating: 1
I would not make this recipe if I did not have a mandolin to slice the squash. Though I microwaved the squash for 3 minutes in order to slice it thinly, the squash never really got soft and tender. It evidently was not thin enough and we could not eat it. The creamed spinach portion was wonderful.

I'm not a squash fan and this was great. I used frozen spinach, half the butter required plus a little olive oil to saute the onion/garlic. Also sprayed a nonstick pan with olive oil instead of greasing a pan with butter. Used about 2 Tb butter to dot the top.

I thought the gratin might be too dry so I added some half and half after assembly, before baking -- mistake. So soupy and loose. I might try a different type of squash too, the butternut was very sweet- but that might be a function of the season, they get sweeter as it gets colder. All-in-all, there is potential but it needs work.

I made this with a couple of variations. I'm not so into heavy cream so instead made a classic bechamel (4 tbs butter + 3 tbs flour in a heavy bottom sauce pan; add 2 cups 1% milk gradually while wisking, salt, white pepper, pinch of nutmet) and stirred the onion/spinach mixture into the bechamel. i then layered the butternut squash slices (pre-roasted for 20 min. in a 450 oven to bring out the sweetness) with the bechamel to make a "lasagna" type structure. it was delicious!

Very nice dish! We'll probably do this again for the holidays. One note: if you didn't see the picture, the recipe was a bit tougher... let's just say, the next time we do this, the presentation will be better. Thanks!

really tasty! sweetness in squash is a nice balance with the creamed-spinach mix. added ricotta for texture. delicious, will make again.

Great for Thanksgiving. Easy to prepare. I added thinly sliced fontina in one layer since there just aren't enough calories in creamed spinach. ;)

Got raves. Do it and don't change a thing!

The adjustable blade slicer is not a common item. I tried to slice with a knife and found it difficult.A food processor did not give elongated slices. However, microwaving the peeled squash 3-4 minutes at high power and checking the texture each time made the slicing much easier.Not soft, but just pliable to slice with a good knife.

I assembled the dish the night before to bring to my friend's house for dinner. They are both vegetarians so I thought this dish was perfect. Since I have a cheap imitation of a mandolin, I had to 8th my butternut squash (instead of quarter). The next day, I only let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes and ended up increasing my cooking time by 10 minutes. This dish looks exactly like the picture when cooked. The delicate flavor of the squash is not overwhelmed by the spinach but it is not as creamy as you might expect in an au gratin. We paired this dish with a salad for a meal but I could see this as part of a large feast. If you know anyone who thinks squash is bitter if not cooked as a dessert, this is an excellent example of how this vegetable can shine. Overall, an excellent dish.
