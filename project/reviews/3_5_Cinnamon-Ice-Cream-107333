We thought it was fantastic and we left the cinnamon sticks in overnight. It may depend on the quality or freshness of the cinnamon. If you don't freeze it it makes a delicious creme anglais.

Having read the previous comments about this ice cream, I wanted to avoid a disappointing cinnamon-y flavor when making it for the first time. So after gently simmering the milk mixture, I let the cinnamon sticks steep in the hot liquid for about 90 minutes. Then I continued by adding the egg yolks and finishing the ice cream. It was definitely worth the wait. The cinnamon flavor was outstanding.

This recipe is perfection. To those who feel that there isn't enough of a cinnamon flavor, I have to wonder at what point in the recipe you removed the cinnamon sticks. I keep mine in through the whole process, only removing them right before I put the custard in to my machine. Thanksgiving wouldn't be the same in my house without this ice cream!

I made this last summer as printed, and I am about to make the base again --without the cinnamon of course-- as a base for peach ice cream. I've made a lot of ice cream over the years, and this is the silkiest I've ever made, without the cloying feel on the toungue of all-cream recipes. Just superb, if you're OK with breaking a dozen eggs.

I agree with the people who said the ice cream lacked cinnamon flavor. I used six cinnamon sticks and that wasn't enough. As recommended by another reviewer, I added 2 t ground cinnamon. That boosted the flavor but had a mild negative impact on the smooth ice cream texture. Still, I got loads of compliments and only one complaint. I disagree with the reviewers who complained about fat content. The mixture of three parts milk to one part cream made the texture a little like ice milk instead of ice cream. Next time I would double the amount of cinnamon sticks or possibly crush the sticks and steep the pieces in cheesecloth. That would increase the surface area of the cinnamon without affecting the texture. It's difficult to know how fresh cinnnamon sticks are when purchased. Even "new" ones could have been in warehouses for months or years.

I prepared this for a New Year's Eve gathering as an accompaniment to an apple pie. Having read the previous reviews, I bought a new jar of cinnamon. We still could not really taste the cinnamon flavor which was a disappointment. The custard base is delicious, if not cinnamon-y, but when frozen it's very bland and too fatty/ creamy for our tastes. I suppose changing the milk and cream to lower-fat versions would adjust the texture more to our liking, but the flavor is not wonderful enough to warrant the experimentation.

We made this ice cream to eat alone. This was a mistake. I imagine it would be great with a peach cobbler or other fruit tart, though.

I might have used only ten yolks (but it was still plenty). I enjoyed the ice cream - next time, I might make the same base with vanilla bean and a bit of vanilla extract instead of the cinnamon...it was rich and eggy. We also used a couple tablespoons less sugar as per other reviewers' comments.

I have made this a number of times now and it is to die for! I can never get the custard quite thick enough, but it doesn't seem to matter. I'm telling you this will be some of the best cinammon ice cream you've ever tasted!

I thought this was a very good ice cream. I made it for guests to accompany a homemade apple pie. Everyone loved it! Excellent texture and flavor. Although for creamy and rich, nothing compares with the recipe for Butter-Pecan ice cream found on this site.

Wow! I am surprised at all the raves this recipe received. It didn't turn out at all well for me. Due to the high fat content, it was difficult for this to begin to freeze and was very crystallized. Save yourself the immense amount of fat and calories - make something else.

This made an excellent ice cream. Very rich and creamy. My company loved it served with homemade apple pie.

I bought mexican cinnamon sticks and I thought the ice cream came out with an incredible cinnamon flavor (and it was so deceiving since there was no visual evidence of cinnamon!). I did not chill the custard overnight but only a couple of hours and then proceeded to the ice cream maker. It still turned out perfect!

I made the recipe as written but tasted the mixture before I put it in my ice cream maker, and thought that it wasn't quite cinnamon-y enough, perhaps because my cinnamon sticks were too old. I added about two teaspoons of (fresher) ground cinnamon to the mixture, and it came about beautifully -- just the thing to go with pumpkin and pecan pies at a festive holiday dinner.

Everyone loved this ice cream, although I added an extra cinnamon stick. I also added some jarred caramel sauce just before the ice cream hardened in the ice cream maker. The ice cream was very rich and delish!!

This was delicious! We put in three more cinnamon sticks, and used only whole milk, replacing the cream. It was delicious, and just the perfect amount of creaminess.
