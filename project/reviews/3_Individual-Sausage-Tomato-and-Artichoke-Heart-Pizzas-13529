This pizza was great! I used habanero and green chile sausages to add some spice and it was terrific! I would make these whenever a quick and yummy recipe is is order (great for an appetizer, cut into small triagles).

A great pizza to make on a weeknight or any time. The pizza dough was great considering you don't have to let it rise for an hour+. I added sun-dried tomatoes for a little zing!

This was very very easy for those of us who are dough impaired. We added some sun dried tomatoes and roasted garlic to the toppings.
