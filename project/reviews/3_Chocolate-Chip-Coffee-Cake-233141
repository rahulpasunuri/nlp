Love this recipe! So simple, and the cake turned out light and fluffy! Will definitely be making this one again. Maybe with cinnamon and chopped apples next time...?

The cake was dry. I used light sour cream so maybe that was it. I took it out of the oven at about 52 minutes also so I was surprised it was dry. The walnut topping is yummy.

Good cake, but not a prize winner. Nothing special.

One of my all time favorites. I can't wait to make this for company. This is more of a dessert, not a coffee cake, in my opinion. I made this twice, this is what I learned: 1. mini chocolate chips make a much better cake than regular size chips. 2. walnuts are better than pecans with this cake. 3. a chocolate chip glaze is much better than the vanilla glaze. 4. a plain tube pan is better than a bundt (or not-plain) pan.

Not bad but not great either. Simple and quick. Wouldn't serve it to company.

I would make this again. However, this definitely is not what I think of when I think "coffee cake". I guess I'm more of a streudel girl. The topping is yummy, I'm still just trying to adjust to the idea of chocolate chips in a cake. I would say I should have taken it out a little before an hour to keep it moist like everyone said it should be.

I have made this recipe many times. The only time it flopped was when I tried whole wheat flour with it (I don't recommend it). Every time I make it I get rave reviews. I love this recipe.

OK. I used the wrong pan, forgot to add the chocolate chips to the batter AND put the topping mixture on the bottom. And it was still delicious! Moist and yummy. Homely to be sure, but great. Will make it right next time!

Delicious! This coffee cake is very moist and spongy. I made this for a spontaneous get together and everyone raved. It maintains moisture days later. Despite the chocolate chips, it is not overly sweet. I will try freezing next time.

I found the cake dry and tasteless. I think I made the mistake of using whole grain pastry flour, when I should have used plain white pastry flour. My fault, not the recipe's. I would make it again, only, this time i would use the right type of flour!.
