A bit of work, but very yummy. Be careful to seal the logs well--mine ended up oozing apricot preserves everywhere, but the resulting cookies were still delicious if not so pretty.

This is a terrific recipe. All my New York jewish friends tell me it reminds them of their grandmother's rugelach!!!! I am from NYC and I could not find a place down here that sells rugelach, so I had to search for a good recipe. This is it! Very easy to make and it freezes really well.

Rating: 4
I've been making this since it was first published. I make it every Christmas for one of my cookies. It freezes perfectly which is good because they stale after 2-3 days at room temperature. They are the greatest and my favorite. I had made Maida Heatter's pinwheel style version from her 1981 cookie book, but this version is better. One thing the four step process to fill them always takes the greatest concentration and a concerted effort not to forget a step. I have to stop and double check just before each time I roll each strip up.

Anyone who knows me, knows "my" rugelach...and I'm always trying to convince people how EASY it is to make. (takes a bit of effort, but still easy). I have forgotten to add things, added new things (like chocolate chips) and dried cherries, and all sorts of other combinations and it never, ever fails. This is a holiday and year long recipe that I'm so happy to have found. Try it and you'll be famous for it! (and add chocolate chips!)

The inside dough did not bake enough when rolled tightly and was still doughy when the outside was done. I recommend rolling it loosely, and that completely fixed the problem. This rugelach is a winner. Huge compliments whenever I make it.

Rating: 4
Really yummy and so much easier than traditional rugelach shapes. I didn't have a problem with them splitting but perhaps this was because I put them in the fridge overnight after rolling and then baked them? I didn't enjoy working with this very sticky dough but it was worth it for the melt-in-the-mouth taste

Rating: 4
These are the best and I make this recipe often at the request of friends and family, including a friends wedding! The dough is simple to make and freezes well so that you can make the rugelach at a moments notice. I use many different fillings. Some of my favorites include: Fig preserves, apricot, or date. When I have finished making the dough I divide it into 4 equal pieces and pat them into rectangular "brick" shapes and wrap them individually. This make it easy to roll them into the appropriate size for filling and rolling up.

These cookies were just fabulous. I followed the recipe exactly, the only thing I changed was the filling using guava preserve and walnuts, and the results were awesomw. They also freeze very well. I will make it again. Everyone loved it.

I have made several batches of these wonderful cookies. The only item I added to the dough was 1/3 of a cup of sour cream. It is easier to work the dough and it tastes great. It is a keeper

OMG! Very easy recipe. I put the dough ingrediants in the Cusinart and quickly had the dough. I can't keep them in the cookie jar for long. The whole family now wants these as part of the repetoire.

Today, I made this recipe exactly as written with mixed results. After reading other reviews, I think I baked the cookies too long in an attempt not to have underdone dough in the center. The taste was great, but they were a little dry. Secondly, my filling leaked out of the bottom seam. I did pinch the ends and no leaking there; but was I supposed to pinch the seam on the bottom as well? I did not spread the filling all the way to the edge of the dough, but that did not seem to help. I would like to make this recipe again, and any suggestions would be welcome.

Wow. These were just awesome, first time making them, even. I added a little sugar to the dough, but it wasn't necessary (and it didn't ruin the overall flavor). I added the butter and the cream cheese as if making pie dough--using my cuisinart with the sharp blade. I used butter still cold, cut it into 8 pieces for each stick, and added it to the flour mixture, blending until it was pebbly, and then I added the cream cheese. I didn't want to overblend and make the dough tough, so I took it out before the cream cheese was entirely incorporated and integrated it using the trifold method. Good golly the dough was awesome! Flaky, tender, rich. Loved the apricot filling, although next time I will try raspberry because I prefer it generally. I took them to a dessert buffet and had the delight of seeing several people pop one in their mouth, widen their eyes and go for a second one. (Yes, I do stalk my buffet contributions to see if they are enjoyed, doesn't everyone?) Definitely will make these again.

Good recipe. Rolling them out as logs ensures that you get plenty of filling and can really pack it in there. It is very moist. Now I need to research some ingredients to make different flavors. I will experiment with this recipe.

Rating: 4
This is the best rugelach recipe - Making them in logs is so much easier than the circle. I do this recipe in batches - one day I make the pastry and refrigerate it - next day or two, I roll out the rectangles and separate them with parchment and cover well and refrigerate - another day I gather all my ingredients for filling and make an assembly line and fill each rectangle and roll them up in parchment and re-roll in plastic wrap. I find they can be frozen and then baked when needed - sometimes I only need one roll to bake and other times the whole recipe. I've had so many compliments - my golf league thought they were from a bakery and all want the recipe. Thanks Subbe Sarah! M.D., Oceanport, NJ

These were wonderful--we couldn't stop eating them! This was my first attempt at rugelach and I was really happy with how easy they were to make and how picture-perfect and delicious they turned out. I used apricot jam and a combination of chopped dried apricots and golden raisins for the fruit. I can't imagine what I could possibly change when I make them again . . . as soon as this batch is gone!

Rating: 4
These are remarkable! The dough comes out flaky and rich-tasting... just like my grandmother's rugelach. I did use sugar-free jam and I must say that the cookies didn't taste as sweet, but I didn't mind because there's plenty of sweetness in the cinnamon sugar. Excellent recipe!

Rating: 4
When I first read this recipe, I thought it may be time consuming with the dough. I was surprised this was easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly and it was excellent. It was flaky on top with the sweetness of the jam and walnuts throughout. These were better than any rugelach from a bakery. Yum!

Rating: 4
Awesome. I made these as part of a holiday spread that included homemade truffles and gingerbread men, as well, but the rugelach stole the show. I will respectfully disagree with oldpompous (below) about needing the dough to be formed into near-perfect rectangles; I tried to do that and failed, but found that the imperfect edges disappeared when I pinched and tucked them underneath - and once they were finished, those edge pieces tasted just as good as the middle ones. I WILL say that I let my dough chill overnight and after cutting it into quarters, I had to knead each one with my hands a bit before I was able to roll them out. I did two logs with apricot jam and two with raspberry jam - I think my favorite was the raspberry, but both were exceptional. I will definitely second oldpompous about the need to let them bake until they are very golden; that's how you get that perfect flakiness. For presentation, I put each piece in a mini cupcake liner; they looked very sharp, indeed!

Nice recipe, but the directions need some work. 1) When youre rolling out the dough, its very important to make sure that the dough is almost exactly 12x8 inches and a perfect rectangle. How? Continually use a ruler to square the dough, manipulating the dough with your fingers. Why is this important? Because when you roll up the dough into the log, if the dough is not rolled out close to a perfect rectangle, the log wont roll up correctly. 2) The most important thing when baking the rugelach is that they come out a rich golden brown. In other words, if they arent done at 50 minutes, dont stop baking them or the dough will be undercooked. Mine took an additional 25 minutes!

Rating: 4
Delicious recipe - I used Solo brand cherry pastry filling then sprinkled with walnuts and it was killer. The only problem I had was that one whole side of one of the logs cracked and blew open during the baking process. I didn't overfill them and I don't believe the dough was rolled too thin. Any suggestions on how to keep this from happening again? Didn't affect the flavor at all, but since I was packaging them up for a gift basket I wanted them to be nice looking as well.

This was outstanding. I also made for Christmas-some with Raspberry Jam and Chocolate, another with Brie & Apricot-but the Apple was by far the best and I am not even an Apple fan....easy to roll, I did it will saran-wrap, just make sure the dough is really cold. I have already made them again with the leftover fruit and ingredients I had in the fridge.

OMG! This was the best thing I made for Christmas. I had never heard of this treat before, but saw it in a catalog and decided to find a recipe. This was the one I used. I made the dough and left it in the fridge for a few days because I misjudged when I would see everyone for Christmas. It was still wonderful. Half of the batch I used blueberry preserves and walnuts, the other half I used peach preserves and pecans. I used golden raisins w/ dried cherries instead of dates. OMG! My mom called me half way back to her house to ask me if I made them from scratch. She thought I had used philo dough! Flaky, crispy, chewy, yum! I want to make these over and over again. Yes, this recipe can be time consuming, but it is so worth it. Also, keeping the dough chilled is key.

Perfect rugelach - not too sweet or too doughie. MUST work quickly and keep it cold. Parchment is a must. Used pecans and dark raisins instead. (chopped the nuts and raisins in blender) Recipe made exactly 44 cookies as stated.

Rating: 3
The cookies are delicious. Only thing i'd be careful with is the pastry. It's quite fragile, and i discovered that if you have any tears (other than the intentional ones you wil make), they will open up in the oven and destroy the shape of the log. Be sure to have a clean piece of dough. I cut the amount of cinnamon sugar inside each cookie by about 1/3, and i like it the results (you get enough sweet from the raisins, methinks).

Rating: 4
I had never made rugelach before, and found this recipe incredibly easy. I got a little creative on the dough, as I didn't have any cream cheese. Instead, I used a mixture of ricotta cheese and creme fraiche that turned out really well. I put the full recipe here: http://krampuscooks.wordpress.com. I also used bittersweet chopped chocolate and pecans for the filling. Delicious!

FOUR stars for the dough, but ONE star for the rolling out method, which is rather stupid, and not like the rugelach I know or have ever eaten. Here is the proper bakery way to do it: Divide the dough in 4 pieces, and flatten each into a 4-5" disc. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate overnight (or at least 6 hours). The next day take one piece out at a time and roll out into a 10-12" circle as if you were making a pie crust. Be sure to work quickly and use flour as needed as the dough gets soft very quickly. Brush off any excess flour and spread jam with an offset spatula--then sprinkle with nuts, raisins (chopped slightly), mini chocolate chips or whatever else you like. Finish with a good coating of cinnamon-sugar (at least 2 Tbsp. for each batch) Using a pizza cutter, cut the dough like spokes of a wheel into 12 portions or so. Starting from the outside, roll each "wedge" inward like a crescent. Curve slightly, and place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet with the tiny tip end down. Sprinkle tops with more cinnamon-sugar. Bake at 350 for 15-20 minutes depending on the size of each piece. That's the way I did them yesterday, and everyone is still raving (and eating them) today. This way of doing them makes at least 60 pieces.

Rating: 4
This is the first review I'm writing, so this should give you an idea about how much my friends and I enjoyed the cookies. First, it's not as hard as you'd think given a lot of the reviews before me. Take the advice of prior bakers and refrigerate the dough overnight. It's a must. Second, throwing the flattened quarters into the freezer while your flattening out the other pieces really made filling and rolling a cinch. Finally, throwing the logs into the freezer before cutting was a help. It was pretty obvious how sticky the dough could get when room temperature, so use your fridge to your advantage!

Rating: 4
Yep, definitely worth 4 forks. These turned out perfect - absolutely like my mental image of what an ideal rugelach should be. I used homemade strawberry jam for one batch, then low sugar "simply fruit" apricot on the other. The dough turns out nice and flaky, and is forgiving (I added double salt accidentally to one batch). The only annoying part was rolling out the dough, but once I got the hang of it it was worth it. To make it easy, I did what another reader suggested: combine raisins, walnuts, sugar, cinnamon in a food processor. Made a really nice uniform texture. Love these, will absolutely do again!

these turned out great, I made 4 different fillings, I used different types of jams and also melted milk chocolate chips and and pecans on one role. Next time I will x3 or x4 the recipe, it's to much work for just a small batch.

These turned out WONDERFUL. I made them with Apricot Habanero Sauce, Blueberry Jam, Cherry Jam and Seedless Blackberry Jam. All from www.Uttersdelights.com I am not a big raisin fan, so I left them out. I took them to work and they were ALL gone in about 2 hours.

I love rugelach, but this was a pain and didn't come out well. I might not have cooked it quite enough, so the middles weren't as firm as I'd like. Also there were far too many raisins. Won't try this one again.

Oh my. These are unbelievably delicious.Absolutely unbelievable. So glad I tried this recipe! I did half with raspberry and the other half with the apricot/peach/passionfruit "Triple Fruit" spread from Wegmans. I can't decide which I like best! Now I can't wait to make them again and try other fillings. And now that I think about it, they're not all that time consuming. But even if they are time consuming, they are well worth it!! I chilled the dough overnight and kept the pieces I was't working with in the fridge, and it was no trouble at all to roll the dough. So, definitely chill your dough thoroughly and generously flour the work surface and rolling pin. This recipe is most definitely a keeper. We can't stop eating them.

Rating: 4
Perfect rugelach recipe, especially the dough. Key is to definitely keep the dough cold-- overnight chill, and working with only 1/4 at a time, and it becomes a snap. I also used a food processor and just threw butter & cream cheese in first, then dry ingredients pulsed just until it clumps. Perfect and easy. I used dried cranberries as I didn't have raisins, and it was a great twist. I also added some chocolate chips just to take it completely over the top.

Rating: 4
these turned out really well. I'm not a fan of raisins so I kept those out. the dough was a little difficult to work with. I rolled it out between two sheets of wax paper and put it back in the freezer for 5 minutes - just enough for the dough to firm up and pull the wax paper off with out ruining the dough.

Rating: 4
these are amazing...and very adaptable. I made them for my diabetic grandparents and substituted splenda for the sugar and used splenda-sweetened raspberry jam, and the rugelach still tasted unbelievable. Moreover, I substituted currants for the raisins, which I found improved the recipe.

Help with dough. This took me hours! Dough sticking to everything (used parchment and silicon rolling pin - could not get 2 passes w/wood). Had to run back and forth to refrigerate every couple minutes. Any suggestions for getting it off the bottom of the parchment paper? used offset spatula, but it was really stuck. In watching the videos (after the fact) to try to figure out - most of them are using a yeast dough. Looking at the photo, I may have rolled a bit thin - but was trying to create the dimensions as specified in the recipe. I have never made anything like this before, so have nothing to compare it to - but this took hours!!! Your suggestions would be most appreciated, as if it is that good in the rugelach world, would like to try again. Will have to rate to post this, and as more knowledgeable bakers think this is a great recipe, will give 4 stars.

This is a very good recipe, however, it stresses to work with the dough while cold. It's better to let the dough warm up a bit, or it will crack while rolling. Also, put the dough in a gallon zip lock bag, it's easy to smash into a square.

Whoa! these were so sweet, overly sweet in my opinion. Next time I will cut back the sugar in the dough to 1/8 cup and inside the log to one tablespoon. I will also reduce the mount of preserves as, in my opinion, it is overwhelming. The dough was easy to prepare and work with, the log rolling is the way to go! I think 40 minutes would have been enough in my oven. I will be making these again and adapting to my own tastes.. All in all, a great, easy to follow recipe.

This is a fantastic rugelach recipe. The dough was very easy to work with. I kept it cold and put each roll in the fridge while I worked on the next one.

For the filling I made two rolls with cherry jelly and combined dried cherries and raisins and it was delicious.

This is my new favorite cookie recipe. Do put the rolled up log in the fridge/freezer for a couple of minutes before baking. A couple of my logs were a little flat because the dough was too soft. Also try with mini chocolate chips and dried cherries/cranberries .

I agree that these are better than any bakery!! I used apricot for two rolls, and raspberry for the final two rolls. I liked the apricot better, and my husband liked the raspberry. The recipe is also forgiving - it doesn't matter if you don't roll the dough into perfect rectangles. I also intentionally skipped a step as it was late - when I rolled out the dough, I put the preserves etc. right on, instead of putting it back in the fridge to chill while rolling out the other dough rectangles. They were amazing!!

Rugelach is one of my favorite desserts, and so easy to make.For the person who had trouble w/sticking, try a Silpat or remove them from the parchment immediately after they come out of the oven. I actually grind my nuts, sugar, dried fruit and cinnamon in a food processor before spreading over the jam, it makes rolling and cutting easier. For a fabulous filling, try Nutella,just warm it slightly in the microwave before spreading on the dough.

Just made these for Rosh Hashonah and got rave reviews. I found that it was easiest to roll the dough out on the parchment and refrigerate each log while you were making the next one to keep it firm. The rugelach was flavorful, flaky and so much easier than doing the crescent shapes. This is a a keeper and a repeater no doubt!

Guests at a Rosh Hashanah dinner last night couldn't inhale these fast enough. I could have lied and said my grandmother taught me to make them, but honestly, I'd only maderugelach once before (the individual roll-up type)and these were absolutely beautiful looking, not difficult to make, and tasted wonderful. Using the parchment paper made rolling easy, and the log approach meant no spilling out of raisins and nuts!

This is fabulous rugelach recipe. The dough was very easy to work with, especially if you make it a day ahead. The only thing I changed was instead of rolling the dough into a log, I rolled it into an 9 inch circle, about 1/8 inch thick, spread out jam, sprinkled nuts and sugar and then cut the circle into twelve triangles using a pizza cutter. Then rolled in from the wide side, like cresent rolls. To finish, I did a light egg wash and sprinkled a bit more cinnamon sugar on top. Absolutely perfect!!

Oh, yes! My exhusband and I gobbled up these rich tastey cookies warm from the oven. I'm not Jewish but my middle name is Esther and I like to try new things. I took them to our Methodist carry in Christmas dinner. The Methodists didn't know what they were. Didn't take them until after the brownies were gone. Then they went fast. Easy to make. The dough was easy to handle after being left in the refrigerator overnight. Loved the raspberry version. My exhusband says to make both apricot and raspberry versions next time. We are good friends.

Boston, you probably could make it without the cream cheese, being that kosher bakeries do sell rugelach that are non-dairy. That being said, Im not exactly sure what you would do. Maybe use Tofutti brand fake cream cheese? That's what I usually do when a recipe calls for a dairy ingredient when I want it to be non-dairy, and the recipe almost always turns out great. Hope this helps!
