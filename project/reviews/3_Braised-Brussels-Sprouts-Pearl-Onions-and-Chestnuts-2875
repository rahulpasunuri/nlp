I made a couple of changes (gambles!) but they seemed to pay off. I cut all of the brussel sprouts in half, and I also added chopped dried dates (figs would work too) to add a touch of gourmet sweetness. I threw everything in a casserole dish once it was all mixed and broiled it for a couple minutes so that the veggies would be a little browned. The whole family loved this - no left overs whatsoever!

I really didn't like the chestnuts. They were mushy and off. I used jarred onions, which I drained and rinsed. They worked well and saved a ton of work.

I couldn't find prepared chestnuts so I had to buy them in bulk, roast them, and peel them myself. This added considerable time to the recipe, which is already quite time consuming. However, family members that wouldn't touch brussel sprouts if they were the last food on earth went back for seconds. Truly delicious.

Ok, in taste but not worth the fuss.

This excellent dish was a great hit at our potluck Thanksgiving dinner. The flavors melded beautifully, partially because of my "problems" with the chestnuts. I found roasted chestnuts from Italy at Trader Joe's. Although I followed the direction on microwaving them; they were extremely difficult to peel, and I ended up with many broken chestnuts. Therefore, I cut them all up into pieces before adding them to the onions. I believe that added to the flavor of the sauce. Made the dish in two stages (1 the sprouts, 2 the onions/chestnuts/sauce) and just before dinner combined and reheated them. This is a keeper: even those who professed not to like brussels sprouts expresed appreciation for the dish.

I tried this dish this Thanksgiving. It was an unparallelled success. I used bottled, steamed chestnuts which took the nail-tearing bother out of using fresh. It was useful to be able to prepare most of it ahead of time.

Well, it's the first recipe on this site that I haven't liked AT ALL. This was really not worth the effort.

I made this dish last year and even people who normally don't like brussel sprouts loved it.

This was absolutely wonderful. It has a rich flavor, that makes it very holidayish. I will definately make next Thanksgiving. I literally wanted to lick my plate when I was done (I would have had I been eating alone).

Absolutely excellent. I made it for Thanksgiving and way more people ate it than I expected. I made it with vegetable broth to make it vegetarian, and it still had a very 'meaty' flavor. Had to skip the chestnuts, though, since I couldn't find them on Thanksgiving-eve.
