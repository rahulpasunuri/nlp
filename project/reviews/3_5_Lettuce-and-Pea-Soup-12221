I thought this soup was "nice'. Nothing brilliant but alright. It was a pretty small serving for 2. I probably wouldn't make it again as there are so many recipes to try!

This soup turned out to be excellent. Made a few minor modifications: 1. added scant 1/2 cup white wine during the simmering. 2. substituted scant 1/4 chopped dill for the marjoram. 3. added more salt than I thought it would need and then still needed a bit more after the blending. We served this with toasted croutons with boursin cheese and ate it on our back steps for a perfect work-night evening.

This was easy and tasty, but I think maybe I will add garlic and experiment with other herbs next time - maybe fresh dill.

I made this soup in 1995 while living on a boat in Cape Cod. It was delicious then and I am making it again in 2009. By the way it is delicious just following the recipe exactly!

Boy, was I surprised by how yummy this was. Used the other reviewers suggestion of garlic chives and basil for flavor instead of marjoram. Used 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 safflower oil. Also, used slightly less chicken broth.

I liked this way more than I expected! I made a few changes. I omitted the marjoram and used about 1/2 cup chopped fresh basil and around 1/4 cup chopped fresh garlic chives. Thanks to the previous reviewer for that suggestion. I also used garlic olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I made sure to puree for a long time and the texture came out perfect. Silky and very attractive. Good flavor.

I enjoyed this soup. Quick to make and very tastey. I had read some comments about the texture, so I made sure to cook the lettuce enough and pureed a bit longer than I normally would. I thought the texture turned out very nice.

This was pretty strange. It might be that marjoram is not the best herb to use; perhaps basil and chives would work better. I blended for quite a while but still had slimy bits of lettuce in the soup.

Absolutely wonderful! I misted my non-stick pan with olive oil spray when sauteeing my onions. I also added some dried Thyme leaves for additional flavor. I had intended to serve this as a cold soup, but after tasting it (I also added 1/2 cup fat-free sour cream) my husband and I had to eat it while it was still warm! So easy to make and definitely fit for company!!

A lovely light delicious spring soup. I used whole milk yoghurt rather than sour cream, and it was plenty rich. Also at the end I added one spearmint leaf, finely chopped, rather than the marjoram. Next time I will use leeks instead of the onion.

This is super easy (esp. when using frozen peas) and super delicious. The pureed lettuce somehow makes it taste very creamy and sinful when it is not at all. Don't even need the sour cream. I used water instead of chicken broth and it was great. In fact, chicken broth seems like it would detract from the fresh taste, which is the best part. Tastes fancy but is cheap and easy!
