I've made this recipe multiple times for guests, and everyone always loves it. It's easy and tasty.

This barely gets one fork from me--my husband ate it willingly, so it had something going for it. My dad, on the other hand, took one bite and asked what it was again he was eating. I, too, made this in a pie plate. I covered it with foil once it browned and gave it an additional five minutes in the oven. It was still runny in the middle. But even the outer ring, which had set, was nearly inedible.

Easy and quick to make. I would cut the apricots into more than 4 pieces, they were a little large. Because I opted to use the single pie plate rather than the individual gratin dishes, it took longer than 20 minutes to cook the center, which meant that it got VERY brown in the oven. Perhaps the individual dishes are a better choice.
