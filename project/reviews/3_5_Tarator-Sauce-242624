I've been making this for years as a sauce for falafel and veggies, I didn't know it had a name! This is delicious, I add a lot more garlic when I make it. We use it as a salad dressing, a sandwich spread, a sauce over veggies and any other excuse we can find for using it. Love it.

To finish the thought... Tarator is plain yogurt, cucumber, dill walnuts and garlic, thinned with water if necessary. Delicious in the summer when it is hot outside.

I don't know where did you find this name but, Tarator is a very popular cold bulgarian soup made from.
