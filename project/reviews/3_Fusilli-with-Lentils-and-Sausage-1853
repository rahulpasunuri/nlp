Great weeknight supper. It does seem more of a hearty soup than a pasta dish, but that's not a complaint. Best of all, all of the ingredients are staples in my kitchen, so I can make this whenever the mood strikes!

I broke up the sausages into pinches. I removed some of the broth before adding the pasta (about a cup) so that when the pasta had cooked, it absorbed most of the excess moisture and avoided the dish becoming a soup. I also added salt and black pepper. I topped it with some freshly grated romano cheese and olive oil. It was delicious!!! but I would advise everyone to buy good quality sausages to begin with. This dish is easy and only used one pot. The removed broth was also delicious.

I added a can of tomato paste (instead of chopped tomato), 2 bay leaves, and lots of salt (probably about 3 tsp) and pepper. They seem to have omitted the "season with salt and pepper to taste" line. Makes a huge difference. I also crumbled the sausage as it was cooking which also helped distribute some flavor.

It was okay...nothing too impressive.
