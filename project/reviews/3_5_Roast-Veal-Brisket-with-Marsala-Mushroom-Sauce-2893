I made this recipe based on its "fork" rating and what I had on-hand (that says alot when living on an island). I used beef brisket and veal bones. I added a Cubano pepper and a stalk of celery to the bones and onions. I also added green peppercorns to the mushrooms. I'm not a big fan of pot roast and I thought the Marsala and mushrooms would move this meat out of that category. Although the flavors were excellent - the texture is what it is. I didn't read the reviews untill after eating and thought it was careless of Epicurious not to correct the mistakes in the recipe already noted within a few of the reviews. One of the reasons I stopped getting Gourmet as a novice cook years ago - was I would line-up ingredients for a recipe only to find my masterpiece in the oven and one or two ingredients on the counter (never having been instructed to use them).

Very good, but, my butcher (I have gone through this twice now) insists that a breast of veal weighs at most 3 lbs., anything larger is not veal. The net of two of these cuts is three pounds of meat, enough to feed 8 light eaters if you serve enough side dishes. Go for it, this is really delicous,

I made this dish with beef brisket...it was alot of work and tasteless. If I attempted to do it again I would possibly use different spices and a different wine other than Marsala.

This was absolutely delicious although quite a bit of work. Followed the recipe exactly. There is a missing line in the recipe however. The mushroom mixture is added to the roasting pan before it is covered.

This is a great dish, especially if you like mushrooms.

Delicious. Melted in your mouth. Only change I'd make is to use more marsala, and less stock.

I'm completely confused. Do the mushrooms get added to the roasting pan? Or do they get added later? HELP!!

This recipe was wonderful. I have made it several times and when inviting guests for dinner, quite often I am asked, "Are you making your Veal Brisket?"

The sauce was excellant! However when I made this dish I thought it was much easier and more convenient using veal cuttlets.

This has become a family favorite! I make it for many holiday dinners.

Found out I was out of Marsala when it came time to add it. Substituted sweet vermouth. It was really good, but way improved the second day.

how can this be a passover recipe with flour in it? Does it work with matzoh flour?
