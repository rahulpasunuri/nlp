This is one of the most versitile coatings for fish ever. I have made it with olive oil in place of butter and using standard breadcrumbs. I have used dried herbs and fresh. Spicy brown mustard goes well with Halibut filets (use 1 TB) Sometimes I omit the garlic. Whatever I do, it comes out fantastic ! I LOVE fish with this coating (any version)

Oh my gosh, was this good! I used tilapia, as that was what I had on hand, but I will definately use this on any fish! The only change I made was to substitute 1/2 c. grated pecorino romano for most of the panko (I halved the recipe)as we are low carbers. I did use 2 Tbs. of panko for a crispy texture. I didn't pile the topping on the fish too thick, as I wanted the delicate flavor of the tilapia to come through. I baked 10 minutes @ 400 and it was deliciously perfect! I had enough topping to freeze for the next time, and there will be a next time, soon!

Great recipe. Easy and delicious. I've made this a couple of times for a large crowd, a hit both times and easy on the chef too!

This recipe has good return for almost no effort. So easy, and most ingredients you'll already have in your kitchen even if you haven't shopped in a while. I made it with mahi mahi and it didn't overpower. Had leftover topping, which I stuck in a ziploc in the freezer and used again a few weeks later.

This is great! I've been making it with just kalamata olives and the tomatoes and it's delicious. I originally tried it on salmon, but have also made it with mahi mahi and, because my mother doesn't eat fish, I've tried it with chicken and it has always been a big hit!

Made this last night with kalamata olives (no green olives on hand) and while I agree with other reviews that Panko is a strange substance, it is delicious in this recipe. We ate every bite! I served it with a fresh green salad and basamati rice. I will definitely be making this again (lots of summer salmon in the freezer!).

My company LOVED this!I think next time I will add a little more melted butter as it was hard to keep the bread crumb, olive, tomato mixture to easily stay on top of the fish. I served it with roasted red potatoes and butternut squash that I roasted with garlic and finely chopped fresh thyme.

Excellent. Great easy recipe. Used fresh COHO Salmon fillets served over a bed of 'mashed sweet potato/russets."IT'S A KEEPER!"

Wow!!! My partner pretty much only eats sea food- particularly Salmon and this recipe was such a delicious diversion from the typical sweet salsas and sauces you usually find for Salmon. The extra topping I froze and used again- so no waste!

We love olives, but in this recipe, they overwhelm all the other flavors. If I try this recipe again, it will be without the olives.

Restaurant quality. I made the breadcrumbs from a French baguette and left them coarse. They browned up beautifully. Garnished with roasted asparagus that made the presentation very colorful. Can't wait to try the topping on pork chops.

I would like to cook fish more often for health reasons (and because I love it), but it's been difficult finding recipes that make fish palatable to my husband. This one worked! It incorporated many things he loves, so I thought I'd give it a shot. He ate it and even enjoyed it. I love the way the topping encases the fish and holds together. Very flavorful, and fairly fast.

We recently had a dinner party and this dish was a huge hit. I spread a tsp of Dijon mustard then spread a tbsp of Cream Cheese, then added Olives / Sundried Tomatoes and dusted with Panko Crumbs. It was perfect!!!

We made this as written with fresh king salmon. Very easy, and very delicious...a nice variation from the many asian recipes we do.

Rating: 1
Not one of my favorites, less than the sum of its parts. The olives, sun-dried tomatoes, mustard and herbs were fine, but the panko is unpleasant looking (think coconut flakes or maggot strips), it's made with partially hydrogenated oil, and it's not very tasty. If I ever do this again I'll use regular breadcrumbs and hope for the best.

We really like each of the ingredients in this recipe but didn't enjoy them all mixed together. We did not find that the topping enhanced the fish at all. Will not make this again.

Just used frozen salmon from Costco. Very flavorful and easy to make. Twelve minutes in a toaster oven was perfect.

My husband brought home 60 pounds of salmon from a fishing trip....I have tried more than a few recipes form this web site for salmon and this one was terrific. Perfect for a dinner party as you can prepare it ahead of time and pop it in the oven while you are having your first course.

This was wonderful! Even if I didn't have panko crumbs (made whole wheat crumbs in processor)and used heart healthy butter substitute instead of butter. Also used spray on pan instead of more butter. In other words I made it so I could serve it without apprehension to a heart patient!

I fixed this dish for 70 people (4th of July party) and it was a HUGE, HUGE hit!! I made the topping the day before and added the panko crumbs just before I baked it. I only used a little panko though. Just enough to give it a crunch. The flavor was amazing!!! So simple! The non-fish eaters came back for seconds!! I'm definently making this again!!!!!!!

This was without a doubt one of THE BEST salmon recipes I've ever tried. It's a beautiful presentation, the combination of flavors is exquisite, and always a real hit with company. I did not change anything in the recipe, aside from slightly cutting back on the butter, and it was perfect.

This is one of the most amazing Salmon recipes ever! I've made it over and over again and it's definitely something you could make for a dinner party. Don't listen to the negative reviews! I agree with the people that say it's delicious. It is very flavorful

Rating: 4
Don't let a couple previous reviews prevent you from making this- This is an AMAZING recipe! I have to disagree with the comment that the flavor of the topping overpowers the salmon; if you like multi-layered gourmet flavors, yet relatively easy preparation, this should be the next dish you serve when you want to impress! Also, if you have a good quality salmon there is no way it will tast fishy, especially as a result of the topping. Our salmon was so delicate and fresh tasting and perfectly complimented by the Jasmine rice and grilled native asparagus we served it with. Pop open your favorite wine and you have a meal that you will want to make part of your permanent repertoire!

This was so delicious! I only had Kalamata, so I used those, but made it exactly as stated and it was so good! I am not even a fish fan but it was probably some of the best fish I have ever had in my life!

The flavors of the crust overwhelmed the salmon. Maybe it would be better on another type of fish. I'm always looking for new salmon recipes but this is not one I will repeat.

Rating: 4
This was fabulous! I followed everything, but mixed all the mustard into the topping. My oven is going, so it took 20 minutes to cook and was probably more like 375 than 400. I purchased the salmon the same day and it was extremely fresh. This was our Christmas Eve dinner and was a huge hit.

Rating: 2
Yes the salmon turned out very moist and the breadcrumb layer was nice and crunchy, but I didn't find that the flavors in the crust went well with the salmon. They made the salmon smell way too fishy. I may try this topping on halibut or red snapper, but will not use it for salmon again.

Rating: 4
Great taste and so easy! We eat fish quite often so was looking for something new. This preparation is easy and delicious. The panko crumbs make a nice crispy topping and the combination of flavor is wonderful. Will definately make this again.

Delicious and easy to throw together. The salmon was just a touch dry, so I took the suggestion of a previous reviewer and baked the fish longer (16 min) at a lower temperature (350F). The topping was so flavorful that the salmon was somewhat masked; next time I'm going to try this with a milder fish (cod or pollock) so as not to waste yummy salmon on a dish where I can't taste it. The topping was a tiny bit salty, although I decreased the black olives to 3T. I made the mistake of mixing all of the mustard in the topping, so I didn't spread any extra mustard on the individual fillets. Can anyone else tell me whether this would have made the fish moister?

Liked the olive mixture but salmon was dry. Nothing spectacular, won't make again.

Looks sophisticated, tastes good, and the salmon was so incredibly moist and tender. (Don't know if that's related to the recipe or if it was just fortuitous). I omitted the butter and didn't miss it at all. The first time, I forgot to get green olives, so I just substituted more black olives. But then I thought the dish had way too strong of an olive taste. The second time, I used the specified amount of green olives and black olives. Much better. Next time, I plan to rinse all the salty liquid off the olives, reduce the amount of black olives just a tad, and increase the tomatoes just a tad. My fillets also had a raw center after 12 mins and needed several more minutes of baking. Next time, I plan to reduce the temp and increase the baking time. Finally, as always, I love panko breadcrumbs :)

This recipe will be in our top ten for cooking salmon. I was concerned that the olives might make the topping too salty, but it was fine. I took the advice of some other reviewers and doubled the butter, and baked the salmon a little longer, 4-5 minutes, especially since I had a thick slab. I can't believe I forgot to slather the salmon with the remaining Dijon mustard before piling on the topping! Still, it was excellent.

Great recipe, and I am a new fan of panko! I, too, had a "raw" center, and believe that it needed additional cooking time. Other suggestions: I think this would be enhanced by a sauce of some kind, or jus. It was great, but perhaps a little dry. We served it with the spinach gnocci (this site) and the peperoni imbottiti (stuffed bell peppers)

I made this for my mom and we both loved it. I have always been afraid to cook seafood myself (just didn't grow up eating much of it so it intimidates me), but this was so easy and impressive enough for company that I will be making it again and again. I did have to bake it a little longer as it wasn't quite cooked through the thickest part, but I think that may be because I used one large fillet instead of several smaller ones as called for. Great recipe!

Made this dish for hubby's boss. It didn't disappoint. He had seconds! Used tomato-basil sauce (from another recipe on here) blended and put in a squirt bottle to decorate the plate, then the lemon rosemary orzo in the center, a layer of wilted garlic spinach with pine nuts on that, & salmon on the top. Served with fresh asiago cheese bread. Yum!

This recipe is excellent! A few suggestions, though: I used lots more butter on the baking sheet to ensure that the salmon did not dry out. Also, the topping is a bit dry, I would suggest mixing in some melted butter with the topping before putting it on the fish and baking it. Overall, though, loved it!

I was expecting more out of this dish. I have better recipes for salmon that I would make ahead of this one, but this does have interesting flavor, it's easy to prepare, and it looks fancy on the plate. I would add more butter next time.

It was great served with a nice Australian Merlot. I recommend making a merlot sauce for under the fish before serving to guests as it really makes the salmon come to life with richness.

This is an excellent dish. I was wary at first about piling on the panko topping, but it mashes together nicely and holds its shape. I served this on top of Maftoul, a Moroccan couscous dish from Pasta & Co. The salmon is very moist and this dish looks beautiful. Restaurant quality presentation.
