This soup was missing depth. There wasn't a layering of flavors that I love in a soup. I also didn't like the texture of escarole leaves. Would have been better with cabbage. I'll skip this one...

Very satisfying and very tasty. You won't be able to stop at one bowl. I used a piece of left over ham instead of ham hocks. Yum!

Delicious! No need to change a thing, except to add a little fresh rosemary.

This is one of the very best soups I've ever made. No need to change a thing, but adding some fresh rosemary made it even better.

I look forward to Fall so I can make this soup - it's just so delicious! I add more carrots for extra sweetness and also double the garlic.

My husband really liked this soup, but I thought it was just okay. It needs something--maybe doubling the rosemary would help. Still, it's healthy and very comforting. I'm sure I'll make it again.

11 of us get together regularly to enjoy a feast we collectively prepare. At our last gathering one couple brought this soup... wow! We ALL asked for copies. It's great!
