A very tasty and very simple way to make beets. I would give it 3 1/2 forks if I could.

Used this for Christmas dinner alongwith wonderful beef tenderloin. Loved it.

This was a good recipe, sweet roasted beets are absolutely delish! My poor cutting board is going to be stained maroon for a while though!
