Great dish served with grilled meats. I added a little more balsamic which got very syrupy. So good.

Very easy and good. The balsamic vinegar really makes this.

This was easy to make and I thought it would be a pretty color and delicious but, in the end, the dish was all hype. No one at the table really enjoyed the salad...kind of boring. Next time, I hope to make better use of all those cherry tomatoes.

For some unknown reason I haven't added my two cents worth earlier. This is easy and good: try it. No changes needed.

Superdelicious! With the leftovers, I reheated them in a pot to a simmer, and smushed the tomatoes gently with a potato masher. I dumped the whole glorious delicious mess on top of my penne pasta. GREAT dish.

Very good and an excellent way of using all those cherry and pear tomatoes that just don't want to quit. (Come January, we'll all be thinking back fondly on the overabundance.) Even my fourth grader (who prefers almost every vegetable raw, even asparagus and winter squash) loved them.

This was really nice for its simplicity; I served it with the Basil risotto recipe from this site, it was delicious.

Very good and very easy. The warming of the tomatoes really brings out the flavor. I also added a little bit of chicken, pasta and cheese to make a main course, but just as is, it would be a great salad.

This was wonderful. Might even be 4 forks. I added parmesian cheese to it and next time would cut all the tomatoes in half. It was great on bread too.

Excellent, classic flavor. A great side dish. It's also good tossed with grated parmesan, penne, and cooked & diced chicken breasts (I used leftover chicken from the mustard-tarragon saute recipe on this site that's superb).

I loved this dish. I served it with steak and thought it went perfectly. It took no time to prepare and was a great, simple side dish. There is nothing like the taste of warm tomatoes.

Delicious! I brought this to a barbecue and it was a big hit! I did not expect it to be gone as quickly as it was

Yes!! Simple to prepare and simply delicious to eat... A wonderful side dish for any plain beef, pork or chicken. I think it would work well on some grilled fish steaks as well. Can't wait to try! KIMBER

Oh, this was excellent!!! We had a combination of cherry tomatoes: Sweet 100's, Red Grape, Yellow Pear, Snow White, Pink Quartz, Sweet Gold, and Isis Candy. This recipe brought to light all of their unique flavors. We poured the salad over fresh mozzarella and soaked up every last bit with fresh bread. Oh, it was quite a delightful experience! I think everyone should give it a try.

Beautiful and absolutely perfect! I used "cherry berry" (grape) tomatoes and fresh basil. Very easy and fast and a good ego-booster for the cook, too! Such color!

Simple, elegant, and delicious. Hard to believe a recipe this sophisticated takes only a few minutes to prepare. It even works well with dried basil, if you add it right at the beginning so it softens up. A must-serve side dish with steak. Even better if you can get your hands on some nice grape tomatoes.

Wow. Really easy and so, so good. The vinegar, oil and garlic made a thickish sauce that was amazing. A great use for those cherry tomatoes that all seemed to ripen this weekend.

This recipe is quite tasty and is a good one to use if your vegetable garden has an abundance of cherry tomatoes. It works well as a second vegetable/salad along with a meat course.
