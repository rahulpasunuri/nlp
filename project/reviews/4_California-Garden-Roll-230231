The recipe is great. Instead of cabbage I put in cilantro and chopped jalepeno peppers. I am definitely recommending this recipe to everyone. This recipe already make it into my recipe box.

The wrap was delicious and remarkably hearty for what basically amounted to a salad wrapped in a tortilla. I didn't include the cabbage, but instead used thinly sliced red peppers. Very tasty.

This was excellent! Mashed the avocado with lime and used a bit more then the recipe called for. I rolled it up tightly, sliced and secured with toothpicks for a lovely summer appetizer.
