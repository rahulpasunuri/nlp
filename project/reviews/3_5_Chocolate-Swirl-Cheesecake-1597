Very rich, very tasty... took it to a bbq and it was devoured in no time flat. I had some issues with the recipe, though. The crust was WAY too much for a 9" pan. The vanilla filling was much thinner than the chocolate, and I had nothing handy to thin the chocolate with, so I ended up not able to actually marble it. Nobody else seems to have had this issue, so I assume I goofed somewhere. :) The topping was also way too thin to pipe, so I just spread it on top and garnished with shaved chocolate. It was a hit!

Delicious - took this to a party and everyone loved it! It was gone with people asking for more... Tweaks - Filling - added 1 1/2 c choc chips as some reviewers said it wasn't chocolately enough; also added 1 TBSP lemon juice instead of grated lemon peel Topping - didn't use the Frangelico and used 1 TBSP lemon in its place

I don't have much experience making cheesecakes and was quite worried that it was going to be another flop all through the preparation process so I want to share my fears in case any one else has problems. I didn't make the topping as I didn't have frangelico nor cognac handy. For the crust, I wasn't sure what was meant by cookie wafers and I found a chocolate chip cookie for dipping in the supermarket from Bahlsen. Followed instructions and pressed crumbs into tin. The mixture wasn't really firm and crumbled easy if I pressed too hard with the back of the spoon. I thought it would disintegrate once I poured in the filling but it didn't. For the filling, I used a cream cheese with 4% fat. No problem with that. Then I ran out of sugar and substituted brown sugar. Was also ok except that the white batter was not so white. This didn't affect the end look. Couldn't notice it. Nutmeg amount was ok. Lemon peel added a nice slightly lemony touch. The batter was quite watery and I thought that couldn't be right and that it would wash my crumbly crust out of shape. So I was too afraid to swirl the two batters together. In the end, it came out with a brown batter at the bottom and white batter on top. Looked very nice too. With my oven the baking time was perfect. The cake was sooo good.

Anyone who actually expects this cheesecake to have a chocolate flavor will be disappointed like I was. It would more appropriately be called Hazelnut Cheesecake. The only real chocolate flavor is in the crust, and for a chocoholic like me, that's just not enough. Also, I found the nutmeg flavor to be distracting. It did, however, bake up beautifully, and the topping was delicious.

"About an hour" was way too much for my oven. The cake was already brown on top at 45 minutes and the outcome was nothing so special. I might give it another try for all those raving reviews though.

Made this for a potluck pool party last night. Two guests told me it was the "best dessert" they had ever had! The recipe says skip the topping if pressed for time - DON'T. It is easy to make and it is delicious. For those who don't want to cover the swirl pattern, I covered the whole top with a thin layer of topping and then melted a couple of ounces of semisweet chocolate in about a 1/4 cup of cream, let cool and then drizzled on top and swirled with a knife. Piped the topping around the side as called for and it looked beautiful!

As a european, I found myself dissappointed with the American cheesecakes I've sampled until I tried this recipe!! However, this cheesecake isn't too sweet or light. It has the characteristic flavour and density of traditional cheesecake. My family was elated with this dessert and said that it was better than any cheesecake they've ever bought. This was my first home-made cheesecake. The recipe is simple and well worth it. I'll never buy cheesecake again! :0)

I made this recipe twice...The first time following the exact specifications of the recipe, the second time without the added sauce and with a graham cracker crust instead. Both times I made the cheesecake it was a hit. I would suggest; however, of maybe substituting half of the vanilla with another exract - almond perhaps?

This was very easy to put together for a cheese cake. It looked beautiful and my husband rated it four stars. My company ate every bit though it was extremely rich and served after a big meal.

Delicious and beautiful! I left off the sour cream topping, and you could see the beautiful marbelized top. So pretty, that when I make it again, I will not do the topping, although I'm sure it tastes yummy! I also did a graham cracker crust rather than the chocolate wafer, because that is what I had. Probably great with either. What a great recipe, and not TOO TOO sweet!

I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and lite sour cream to cut down on calories. I also cheated and used 2 prepared 6 oz keebler crusts (chocolate). I divided the batter and chocolate into 2 pies and baked at 350 for 45 min. Yummy!

Great cheescake! Followed this awesome recipe pretty much to the letter... I used Oreos in the crust, to a nice effect... Either way, give it a try, you'll be impressed!

Kudos to everyone who tried the CHOCOLATE-SWIRL CHEESECAKE. I experimented many times to perfect this recipe for you. My then 1 year old daughter, Molly, became the official "taster" and learned how to use a spoon by the time this recipe was complete! I enjoy reading your comments and appreciate your time. Here's a few additional tips: s l o w l y and gently pour the plain batter over the chocolate batter. Be careful to not over swirl the batters together--I suggest trying mini folding motions. Quite a few of you have called me with some questions, and I hope these tips help. --thanks, Basha

I thought this cheesecake was good, but it just tasted like a chocolate cheesecake. The topping is amazing, though. I decided to frost the whole cake, even though this covered the pretty swirls, because I wanted a bit of the topping in every bite.

This was the yummiest most irresistable cheesecake I've ever tasted!

I made this cheesecake for a Christmas party and it was a big hit. It looked and tasted great. I thought it was a little dense, especially the bottom layer (the chocolate), but I think I may have overmixed it. I will definitely try this recipe again.

An excellent cheesecake, easy to make and a beautiful presentation. I made it for a Christmas brunch today and was asked by a guest, "Which bakery did this beauty come from?". I smiled from ear to ear.

I had entered a dessert competition for my husband's annual Rotary barbecue cook-off June 3, and I couldn't find my chocolate cheesecake recipe. So I got this one from Epicurious the day before and made it . . . and I won the contest! It's absolutely delicious, and pretty easy to make. The topping recipe could be cut in half, I had a lot left over. But thanks for the recipe, I won a great prize!

Everyone loved this. I recommend using neufchatel cream cheese, which has less fat and calories than the regular cream cheese - I don't think you could tell the difference.
