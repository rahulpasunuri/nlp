Incredibly aromatic.. fresh rosemary is a must and the juniper berries set this off especially well. Next time I will buy a roast already deboned.. I struggled with getting the bone out without macerating the meat, so the final product was a bit in pieces.

This smells so heavenly once the spices hit the spot, and all throughout the time that it is cooking. Fresh Rosemary is a must and the Juniper berries set off the tone. I wish I had gotten a boned roast instead of having to bone it myself, as I made a bit of a mess.

The recipe certainly has potential. I read the other reviews and doubled down on all the spices, aromatics, and herbs. Despite this I still found the sauce and the pork itself lacking in flavor. I would like to do it again because the texture of the pork was wonderful but the "flavor problem" really needs to be addressed.

This has become my go-to recipe for a port roast! Simply wonderful. And the sandwiches afterward...

Mine is in the LeCreuset right now, and this is a repeat and much loved meal for my family. Incredbile tenderness, and flavor. We like it with spaetzle! Fresh herbs are really essential for this recipe in my opinion. I have interchanged evaporated milk for whole milk many times. Truthfully, you won't have any "curds", and the gravy is so silky delicious. And, I say this, hating and despising evaporated milk's flavor! I add handfuls of fresh mushrooms to the sauce. It is great on it's own, but we love mushrooms, and this is a perfect recipe for it!

Fairly easy to make, and the sauce is divine - those who say the sauce is bland must have had their taste buds removed! Strain the sauce and reduce for a syrupy glaze from heaven. The left-over curds will be infused with herbs and porky deliciousness. Too good to share, the cook should snag them while the sauce reduces. Definitely double the herbs, and whole milk is a must. Perfect recipe for your Le Creuset 5-qt Dutch oven.

So I used a boston butt(good fat to meat ratio) & pretty much followed the recipe. Did take advice and use more juniper berries. Had a tough time reducing the sauce but added a bit of cream and a dash of butter and it was good to go. DId wisk in the curd. The pork was so blasted tender and the sauce on the boiled taters(with skins on) were very good. Would love to have had the sauce on gnocchi. This is a keeper as far as my husband is concerned.

Very moist and tender, but I think the Pork Roast with Leeks has a more defined flavor, even though I doubled the garlic and herbs per the other reviews. Sauce was bland and not worth the trouble.

My father, who was Italian, used to make this for me all the time. This came out wonderfully, but I did make some adjustments: 6 juniper berries, handful of fresh sage sprigs, handful of fresh rosemary sprigs, 3 cloves garlic. I also rubbed the roast down with salt before browning and then skipped the oven part and cooked it in the crock pot on low for 4 hrs. PERFECT!

I make this recipe tripling the herbs and garlic. After de-greasing I had less than a cup of juices--so after straining I added another cup of milk to the remaining juices and cooked down a bit. It was a much nicer presentation to strain the herbs and curds. Everyone loved it.

I have made this roast several times and it is excellent. Pretty much stick right to the recipe, but I may try some of the other suggestions next time.

Delicious comfort food. Braised the pork in slow-cooker on low for 4 hours. Increased all herbs to 1 x large handful for each. Added thyme. Used 3 x garlic cloves. I followed cook's note to braise it one day in advance and chill. Easier to skim off fat. Added 1 x TB butter to sauce. Used immersion blender to incorporate milk curds back into sauce. Pork was extremely tender and literally pulled apart.

Fantastic. I ended up serving the curds and next time won't separate them.

I found this recipe to be everything I expected. I used more Juniper berries, as mine were rather old,and didn't have fresh sage in my garden so used rubbed sage. I also used some half and half as the only milk I use is 1%. The flavor was superb and I will definitely use it again. Perhaps at Christmas for my husband's large family, where I supply the meat. I have done pork tenderloins previously, but I think they will all love this.

Good, but not great. I prefer the Hazan method of milk cooking, and will try that again with the addition of juniper, which was the best touch in this recipe. Don't strain the curds, those are the best part, and are lovely on potatoes!!

This is the best pork roast I've ever made. I couldn't find the juniper berries but it was still wondeful.

This was fantastic. I have made it twice and both times it was perfect. It came out extremely tender and flavorful and we even enjoyed the curds.

This was a fun and easy dish. Wished I had some juniper berries, as the pork did lack a "bottom note." Essentially, it was a good pork pot roast. Loved it and would make it again.

I agree with another reviewer that there are more dazzling pork recipes out there, but this was still quite nice and easy to prepare. I was intrigued by this milk method and decided to try it. I used a smaller shoulder roast(about 2-3 lbs), boneless end- cut. After about 45 or so minutes of cooking, I thought it looked a bit dry, but at the end of the total time (1.5 hrs) it was very tender and moist. I followed the recipe almost as is, only leaving out juniper berries and adjusting the amounts for my smaller sized roast. The sauce, although a bit oily (I was a bit heavy with the olive oil) was a nice finish. I would make this again and would maybe try (with some adjustments) using this method with chicken pieces or maybe a lamb or veal roast.

many other pork recipes are better.

Not a bad recipe. I added a ton more spices than the recipe called for and salted the pork before browning. The milk made for an interesting sauce.

This definitely made the meat super tender and tasty, although I did use more herbs and salt then called for. I'm not sure how this could be overcooked. Next time I'll add S&P before browning, and then use a thickener with the sauce. But all in all a great way to prepare pork.

After such a wonderful smell when you start the recipe, this turned out to be bland (plus I overcooked it). Nothing special.
