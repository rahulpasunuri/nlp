This is a quick, relatively healthy and tasty recipe, but its not a memorable one.

Loved this, and it was easy despite the number of different steps. Use the biggest apples you can find: by the time a half apple finishes baking, it's gotten quite a bit smaller.Otherwise, you might want to use 2 halves per serving.
