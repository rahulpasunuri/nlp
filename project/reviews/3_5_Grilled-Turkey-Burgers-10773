This is a nice recipe, but I've had way better ones.

I am not a fan of turkey burgers but this is the best turkey burger ever!! Easy, tasty, a kids' favorite and the best non-beef burger I have ever had! I think I would put some egg in it next time to help it "hold together". It was difficult for me to turn the burgers on the grill as they are so tender!

Delicious. Best turkey burgers I've had. Definitely use way more of the onion/caper/garlic/Worcestershire than the recipe calls for; I use close to the stated amount in the recipe with only 1.25 lbs of turkey. I've also subbed red onion for scallion and it's just as good - maybe better.

I just didn't find this recipe anything to write home about. It was easy to make and good, but I can only give it 2 forks. Just too bland for my taste. There are too many other flavorful recipes that need to be tasted.

This is best recipe I have found for T burgers yet..Most add to many ingredients making for a confusing combination of flavors. This is simple, very complimentary to ground turkey. I have also made when I didn't have scallions and that was also delicious, the capers make this burger shine. I would recommend the 93/7 turkey, not the no fat one. You need a little fat to make the burgers juicy and brown nicely.

This recipe was so simple! I often don't get home to start cooking until almost 8:00, so quick easy meals are a life saver on weeknights. I followed the other reviews advice, and using 1.25 lbs turkey cut the other ingredients in half. Even my picky boyfriend LOVED these burgers!

We love these--even my 5 & 7 year olds eat them up! I'm usually working with one and a quarter pounds of turkey and I cut the rest of the recipe in half. Seems to work well! A great change from regular burgers.

These are SO good, I am going out on a limb saying they are the best I've ever made. Like other reviewers I added more of the ingredients (other than turkey) called for in the recipe and thought it completely rocked!

I followed the recipe exactly and loved it. Very good turkey burgers!

I agree that it's crazy good! The key is using more Worcestershire/scallion/caper mix proportionally than called for in recipe. I used about 1.5 lb turkey to 3/4 the mix and chilled the patties for about an hour. Served on onion rolls. We're beef burger fans, and this killed any we've had in a long time!

Very good.Easy and healthy too.I made it on a grill pan, as outside temperatures are in the twenties.

I doubled the recipe... but not the turkey. It was crazy good. Go for it, all compliments from my guests.

So simple, yet so tasty. I made it with chopped white onion... look forward to trying it with scallions.

Great recipe. We just finished our barbeque and have no leftovers! Some burgers we made exactly as the recipe states, and I put boursin herbed cheese in the middle of a few. Our guests liked both styles.

Subtle flavors really enhance the turkey. I used red onion since that was what I had on hand and it tasted fine.

Fantastic way to flavor (bland) turkey! Will definitely make them again. Enjoy.

I added some finely minced onion and a hint of ceyenne pepper...perked them up a bit...served on onion rolls, with lettuce, tomato and mayo.
