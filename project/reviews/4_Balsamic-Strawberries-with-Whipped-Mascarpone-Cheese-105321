Like the others, I also am adding this to my dessert repertoire and plan to serve it often. However, I would like to know why, upon chilling the vinegar/sugar/juice, it became too hard to drizzle? I left it out about an hour prior to serving and that helped. Can anyone provide an explanation? My balsamic is very high quality-does that affect it? No one else seemed to experience this problem. I served it over vanilla gelato, a dab of the marscapone mixture, and a sprig of mint. Butter cookies on the side.

I love this light, sweet summer dessert. It's easy to make for a big dinner party, and my guests ask me to make it over and over again. One critique of the recipe: I find that the balsamic takes MUCH longer than the stated "3 minutes" to reduce. I let mine simmer until it's a syrup... I make triple the recipe and sometimes it cooks for 30 minutes or longer. Additionally, I have found that it keeps for a month or longer.

Exceptional. Like others, I doubled the amount of mascarpone cream and also topped with mint. The addition of fresh mint really took this over the top -it was delicious. The balsamic taste was very minor (may be due to my cheapo vinegar, or the fact that I probably used too many strawberries). A lovely, simple dessert.

My new favorite go to easy recipe for dessert! Love the consistency and flavor of the whipped mascarpone cheese with the strawberries. I used another balsamic strawberries with ice cream recipe from here and now love this one even more! Love the idea of shaved chocolate over the top!

I can't really be bothered about making the syrup. I like to toss strawbs with a couple of TB of sugar and the same of a good balsamic vinegar. In Uruguay I was served this (prepared at the table) with liberal grindings of black pepper. It's remarkable. I do it like that and serve it over ice cream. Heaven!

One of the best and easiest desserts I have ever made. I served them in crystal goblets and my guests raved about both presentation and taste. Easy to make ahead, then put together at the last minute. Great recipe and I will use it often.

I used the berries and cream along with the balsamic reduction in a strawberry shortcake trifle. It was a HUGE hit. I made the individual shortcakes and broke them up in a layer on the bottom of a trifle dish then added the berries, vinegar and cream and then kept layering till it was done. It was awesome.

A phenomenal take on strawberries and cream. You will never again want to eat strawberries without balsamic vinegar (they are great with sugar and balsamic sprinkled over as well as the cooked sauce given here.) I left the lemon juice out of the sauce and increased the mascarpone to cream ratio in addition to using a vanilla bean in the cream and it came out great. I might just have keep the components all prepared in my fridge throughout the summer to snack on...

I brought this to my writing group for dessert after an Italian lunch. My friends loved it and asked for the recipe. I've made it several times since. Definitely use a slotted spoon when scooping the strawberries out of the balsamic reduction.

Rating: 3
The balsamic reduction was definitely very tart - to me, it still tasted like the balsamic vinegar straight out of the bottle, even after boiling and adding sugar. (This could very well be because I used the cheapest brand of balsamic that I could find from a large, chain grocery store). The strawberries themselves soaked with the syrup and served with the mascarpone topping are delicious. If you have excess syrup in your bowl of marinated strawberries like I did, definitely serve only the strawberries (avoiding the syrup). Also, the volume of syrup and cheese generated from this recipe was 1.5 times more than what I needed for 32 oz. of strawberries. A friend suggested adding fresh mint as garnish.

I doubled this recipe and served this tonight for 12 people. It was fantastic. There were also 3 folks who are diabetic, so, I took the liberty of making just a minor change. I used Stevia instead of sugar. This can leave a little aftertaste, but, I figured that I could hide it with all the other things in the recipe and I was correct. I have made this 3 times-the other times I used full octane sugar and it is just a great summer dessert. It is also very good over poundcake or vanilla ice cream. Everybody loves this!

I made this last night with blueberries and strawberries and served with a store-bought cheesecake...it was excellent and I will definitely make again! I might consider adding ribbons of fresh basil on top next time and less sugar on the berries themselves.

Two words: oh MY. Perfect combination of fluffy, deep, tart, sweet, yum, yum, yum. Served piled on Bittersweet Chocolate Mousse from this site at a bridal shower, brought the entire crowd to a frenzy. I'm sure this is equally delicious on its own.

Yummmm!!! I doubted all the reviews that I had read but thought I'd try this dessert anyway and it was outstanding! The mascarpone cream went so well with the strawberries and balsamic. The only thing I did differently was add some more sugar to the balsamic reduction, as I found it too vinagery with just 2 tsp, but I didn't add any extra sugar to the strawberries so it may have just evened itself out anyway. A great dessert!

Keep in mind that if your balsamic vinegar is the wonderful syrupy, 10 or 20 year old stuff like I bought in Modena, Italy, you will not reduce it any further.

OH. MY. GOD. I am not a huge dessert fan, but I often eat some berries or melon after dinner, especially in the summer, just as a nice way to finish a hearty meal. I LOVED this combo. The mascarpone and balsamic were both surprising and welcome flavours in the classic strawberries and cream combo. I served it parfait style in a champagne glass, and not only was it beautiful, but delicious. I also liked it because it was low-maintenance. I made all the parts before making dinner and cooled the glass in the freezer. When I was done with my dinner, I just assembled the parfait and ate!

Martini glass suggestion is five years old. It pays to read those old reviews!

This is an excellent dessert for summer or after a hearty meal - helps to bring down the fullness. For presentation purposes I recommend serving in a martini glass, it looks superb. Also I used good old vanilla ice cream and it was a hit so if you want to save some money its a good way to go. Finally, the strawberries can have a heavy balsamic taste if marinated too long so I recommend pouring the syrup on no more than 1/2 hour before serving - some guests might not have high vinegar tolderance. All in all a great dessert.

I have made this several times. Everyone who has had it raves about it, and I have given the recipe out countless times. I love the density and subtle flavor of the whipped cream/mascarpone cheese mixture. Way better than plain whipped cream! One addition I have made is to melt good semi-sweet chocolate, spoon it onto waxed paper to form little disks, and let it harden. Put some of the strawberries topped with the cream on a plate, add a chocolate disk, top with more berries and cream - YUM! A mint leaf on top makes it very pretty for company.

The berries were very good, but no one could taste or detect the mascarpone cheese, so I considered that to be a waste. The berries would be wonderful with a stronger cheese, maybe a baked brie.

I'm not sure what went wrong, but none of my guests liked this. I used premium quality ingredients. They all claimed they could taste the vinegar, and didn't like it. I found the mascarpone cream to be rather bland and tasteless.

I live in strawberry country, which makes me really happy, cuz I adore strawberries. This recipe is one of my favorite ways to serve them. Fast, easy, delicious.

I made this for a family dinner during the holidays, and because I read an earlier review that people might ask for seconds, I made extra and it was all gone. The topping is great, but the sauce makes the strawberries come alive. It's easy to make ahead of time, a great presentation, delicious and unforgettable.

I followed the instructions exactly, and the results were astonishly delicious. My guests devoured their servings and groaned when I said that there wasn't enough for seconds. I had made enough for one serving apiece. I received an e-mail the next day from one of my guests who told me that when she woke up that morning, the first thing she thought about was the strawberries. I think that the mascarpone cheese/whipping cream combination is 10 times more satisfying than regular whipped cream--I am seriously considering using that combination from now on whenever a dessert calls for whipped cream topping. The amount of the whipped topping allotted by the recipe is just right--any more and it would overpower the strawberries' balsamic tang. My guests debated about whether the strawberries could have been marniated longer in the sauce before serving, but I think that the hour the strawberries spent in the fridge while we ate dinner was just right.

To the Boston starter chef.....chilled is just as it sounds....add it the mixture in "its chilled state...out of the frig.". As for "siffed flour",this process blends and breaks down any clumps of flour into fine "grands" which will mix better when added with other recipe items. Hope this helps

Unbelievable! I've made this dessert 5 times in the past 2 months for dinner and party guests. I got rave reviews each time! The last time I made this, I experimented a little bit and added cream cheese and creme fraiche to the mascarpone. I also mixed in a bit of brown sugar, too. It was just as heavenly, and would make a good base for fruit salad. Absolutely WONDERFUL! Ten forks!!

I made this dessert for a graduation party with 50 people. Everyone loved it and couldn't believe that it had balsamic vinegar. Quite a few had more than 2-3 servings.

How luscious can you get? The smooth, heavy cream and cheese is the perfect complement to the tart, juicy berries. I was lazy and mixed the cheese up with some Cool Whip (2 parts Cool Whip, 1 part cheese), and it was great! Next time, I'll jazz it up with a liqueur -- give it a kick. BTW, I don't understand the previous comment about the smell. I thought the fragrance of the reducing basalmic vinegar was delightful, even when I accidentally got a full blast of the vapors that brought tears to my eyes. And the next morning, the faint lingering tang in the air made it smell like there was an industrious chef in the kitchen preparing a sumptuous meal for me!...sigh...

I've made this recipe several times now. Each time everyone has absolutely loved it! The vinegar seems to intensify the flavor of the strawberries, and the mascarpone cheese mixture is just a complement without adding too much. Whenever I make a special dinner which has so many different flavors and levels of richness, this is the dessert I serve -- it's light enough, but absolutely delicious

My first impression was that this was a disaster-in-the-making. The smell of the balsamic vinegar cooking was almost nauseating, leading my guests to ask "What the H--- are you cooking?" But then the finished product was served, and they could NOT stop raving about it. So next time, I'll work on ventilation -- and I'll double the amount of the sauce. One of the guests was allergic to strawberries, so I also made a small batch with peaches. Phenomenal.

Great summer dessert. The vinegar syrup is a brilliant touch--not at all what I expected. It serves to further elevate the strawberries' tartness and sweetness as opposed to masking their taste. The cream is the perfect counterpoint to the bold flavor of the strawberries. I couldn't find mascarpone anywhere, so I used neufchatel instead and it was great. Cream cheese would be even better (and more caloric). I served it parfait style in chilled martini glasses with sweet basil leaf garnish. Very elegant.
