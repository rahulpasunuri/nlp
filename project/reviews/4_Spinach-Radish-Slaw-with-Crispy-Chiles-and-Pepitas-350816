Excellent, but did not serve it with chiles since it would be too spicy hot for us.

I like the salad, but I would do a different dressing. Experimented with greek yogurt/fage and lime and cumin and it was good. I would make the chiles and pepitas alone for a cocktail snack.

A good salad to go with Mexican cooking. But be careful, the chiles can burn in a New York 45 seconds! I had to do them over.
