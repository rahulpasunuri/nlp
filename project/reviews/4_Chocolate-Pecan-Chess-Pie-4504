Good but a tad dry, will try some of the adjustments suggested by other reviewers for the next Derby Party!

This is a very rich (and delicious) pie! I pulled out my traditional 9" pan and made the recipe as is. With whipped cream on tiny slices, it was more than enough. And I did not think the batter was too scant for the pie pan (not a deep-dish). Thanks to all who warned about the amount so I did not use the deep-dish pan. This pie will become a yearly tradition--it is THAT GOOD.

This pie is no-fail. I've made it several times without exact measurements and have had great results every time. Everyone likes it. I currently have three in the oven for an event tomorrow.

Delicious! Very rich and very chocolaty - it would work well with any type of nut. Will definitely be making this again and again.

I used Marie Callendars crusts (didnt have time with making several pies for Thanksgiving to make pate brisee) I went ahead and made the 1.5 ingredients and it was just the perfect amount. It is a chocoholics paradise. even with the small amount of alcohol you can taste it btw. Everyone raved!

Wow! For such a simple recipe, this was a huge hit. It was very rich- I recommend serving small slices. Like the other reviewers, I used a 9" deep-dish pie crust and so made 1.5x the amount of filling (it barely fit.) I toasted the pecans first. It was delicious. Everyone asked if it was an old family recipe! I can't wait for an excuse to make this one again.

GOOD BUT BETTER AFTER SOME ADJUSTMENTS.I USE 1.5 STICKS OF BUTTER,6 OZ CHOCOLATE.3 EGGS WITH 1 CUP OF SUGAR. 2 TBLS OF KAHLUA,2 TBLS VANILLA.THIS FILLS A REGULAR 9" PIE.BAKE AT 325 FOR 40 MIN. THIS YIELDS MORE OF A TRUE CHESS PIE TEXTURE.

Delicious, easy and a total crowd pleaser. I made 1.5x the filling and it was just a tiny bit more than I needed for a regular 9" pie. I think most any liquor will do in place of bourbon (I used whiskey). 45 min in the oven, 1 hour cooling and 2 hours in fridge = perfect results.

My guests complimented this pie, but I thought the texture was odd. It's a fudgy brownie in a pie shell. The recipe as written doesn't make enough filling for a homemade 9 inch pie shell.

This recipe is easy and the pie tasted delicious. Everyone at our thanksgiving dinner was very impressed!

This is a simple easy recipe. The chocolate you use is what it will solely taste like, so use a good quality chocolate, and let it cool COMPLETELY. I didn't, and it was kind of runny, but once it chilled, it thickened.

This pie is the hit of the holidays. EASY and delicious. It is a huge crowd pleaser especially warmed. I make at least 4 for each family gathering. It WOWs them every time.

Very rich, satisfying but not overly sweet. I toasted the pecans before mixing. Used 1.5x recipe for filling in 9" deep dish pie pan. Next time will use 1x recipe in 8" pie pan. A small slice is plenty!

Delicious and easy. One guest said it was the best pie he had ever had.

An easy and delicious pie! Based on other reviews, I decided to make 1 1/2 recipes of filling and used a 9-inch deep dish pie crust. It needed about 40 minutes bake time because of the additional filling. It was wonderful!

I doubled ingredients and made two pies for a large party. I made homemade pie crust, and even with doing that the delicious outcome of this recipe is one of best quick and easy desserts I've ever made.

So far I have made this twice. First time I could not taste the bourbon and found the filling not so filling. But the overall taste was very rich and pretty good. Second time around I added 1 cup unsalted butter, 6 oz semi sweet chocolate chips,2 tablespoons of bourbon (just enough), 1 1/2 c of sugar, 3 eggs, 2 teaspoons of vanilla, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1 cup pecans, and 1/2 cup walnuts.I served this at a family event and everyone loved it! It was gone within mins.

Fantastic--chocolaty, nutty--and very easy. Rave reviews. I blind baked the crust as others suggested. I also made 50% more filling like many suggested and it was way too much for a store bought 9 inch regular [NOT DEEP DISH] pie crust. The specified quantities would have been perfect. Also, the cooking time is perfect for this shallow 9" pie and the center was not gooey or liquidy at all. Maybe the others used a deeper dish pie form. Now, I did omit the bourbon. I also substituted hazlenuts for pecans b/c I love the chocolate-hazlenet combination. It was fabulous and doesn't need the liquor if you don't want it.

This is an excellent pie - like a soft brownie in a crust. It is so much better than a corn syrup based pecan pie. I will make this over and over again for family, friends, potlucks (it does pack well!)

I made this just as the recipe states and the pie was gone nearly before it was out of the oven. Tasty and easy and made with things usually on hand in my pantry.

Rating: 4
Fantastic! Tastes amazing and is SO easy. It's so versatile. I had semi-sweet chocolate so I just cut the sugar a bit and I only had whiskey so I used dark kaluha instead - came out tasting amazing. This is now my go to recipe for a quick/simple WOW!

Rating: 4
Very yummy and so easy. I actually made this as a tart instead of a pie with a very buttery tart crust. It was perfect. The bourbon adds a wonderful Zing! to it. It's a nice counterpoint to apple and pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving. Of course, I served it with whipped cream which made it even more fattening.

Rating: 4
A chocolate lovers pie for sure! I made this for Thanksgiving. The combination was great! Unfortunatley, I was out of bourbon and had to use whiskey. I think the bourbon would have tasted better, like the recipe says. Even orange liquer may be nice. We will see, I am making it again for Chritmas!

I have made this pie several times for special occassions to receive raves for it. I adore chocolate, pecan, and chess pies and this was a lovely combination of the three. I probably would not make it for every day eating, but it is perfect for special occassions such as Christmas. Also, the filling for this pie is extremely easy to prepare, which was fabulous. Our only concern was the extra time that it took to bake. We kept looking for it to have "set" and it took far longer than the recipe suggested. Since then, I know what I am looking for and it goes quite smoothly. If you are looking for a special treat or a rich dessert to serve for a special occassion, then I'd highly recommend this pie.

This is so yummy and so easy. What's not to like?? I'll definitely make it over and over again. Served it with cinnamon whipped cream. Yum.

The first time I had pecan pie in New Orleans, I feel in love. I had never tasted anything that had tasted quite like it before. Since then most places don't make a pie that lives up. This recipe is the best I have found (not traditional, I know!) Yes, it is fudgey, and chocolately, so if you don't like the sound of that, don't make it. I'm a chocoholic so it suits me fine. I've made this with a variety of liquors including bourbon, rum, and kalhua and have included and excluded the vanilla. Always comes out well though I do prefer it with vanilla. Use good vanilla, not that fake extract stuff! Sometimes I use less sugar as well to decrease the sweetness.

This pie tasted very good, and I will make it again. But... it turned out resembling a fudge brownie with pecans. Did I do something wrong?

Rating: 4
Yummy!!!! I made this in an oblong tart pan. The filling amount for the tart was perfect. If I were to make it in a pie dish, I would double or increase by 1/2 the filling. Also...the crust did not get cooked. Next time I will blind bake the crust.

Excellent and ridiculously easy. I used Kahlua instead of bourbon, and 30 minutes in a convection oven was perfect timing.

I made this pie at Thanksgiving. I used 3 tablespoons of rum and 1 1/2 cups of walnuts, and the recipe came out wonderfully. I could really taste the rum. I recieved many compliments on this pie, and will definitely make it again.

I'm partial to homemade crusts, so I used my own recipie (1c. flour, 1/8tsp salt, 1/3 c. shortening, 4 tbsp water) for that, which worked v. well. Loved this pie so much I made it twice in 2 days (hooray for Derby time!). 1st time I made it exactly as directed, but sub'd walnuts for pecans (personal preference), which worked great. Second time I made it I futzed: I used 3 tbsp bourbon instead of 1; added 1/2 c. more walnuts to make up for the more liquidy nature of filling (due to additional bourbon); added 1 tsp chipotle pepper for a kick (i love chipotle pepper w/anything chocolate). Turned out fabulous! This recipie is v. easy to adjust to one's tastes, and still turns out great. For best results, be sure to use good quality chocolate (I used Callebaut brand 60% bittersweet). I'll be making it again no doubt.

I haven't made this particular recipe, but have made "derby pie" i.e. chocolate pecan pie frequently in the past. I use chocolate chips instead of chopping of solid chocolate. I also never melted the chocolate before baking. The time in the oven is more than enough to melt the chocolate and the result has always been excellent. Again, as I've never made this recipe, I can't compare, but the simpler method I have used has always gotten raves from family and friends.

I'm from New England but my family lived in Southern Georgia when I was a teenager. We all remember the delicious chocolate chess pie we ate 30 years ago at the Bainbridge Hotel. That pie had a firm, well set, rich almost fudgy filling. This recipe was rich and flavorful, but the filling was runny. I extended cooking time to 40 minutes and omitted burbon and pecans because we remember neither in the chocolate chess pie we had in Georgia. The pie filling appeared undercooked and runny even extending cooking time to 40 minutes. Are there any REAL southern chess pie recipes out there?

This pie was really easy and really good. Also I made it exactly like the recipe and could really taste the bourbon. I would not add more than recommended until you try it by the recipe first. Very chocolatey. Do not omit the whipped cream. Lots of flavor for very little effort.

I have made this pie 3 years in a row for Thanksgiving. It has replaced our regular pecan pie and my husband will not let me return to the regular recipe. Everyone loves it, especially chocolate lovers.

Rating: 3
This was so sweet that I couldn't finish my slice, but if you like desserts that are ultra-rich and intensely fudgy, try it. You definitely need whipped cream (just barely sweetened) to cut the richness. I didn't think the bourbon flavor really came through in the pie, so I suggest adding a teaspoon or so to the cream before you whip it.

Rating: 3
This is a great pie to make when you're in charge of dessert for a casual evening with friends. Nothing too fancy or showy, but delicious and different enough to still get rave reviews. At first, I wasn't sure how it would present - it didn't look particularly great in the pie pan, but once it's sliced and served - wow (don't forgot to add a dollup of whipped cream to each slice). Also - I used Amaretto instead of Bourbon. I considered using Buttershots...maybe next time! Definitely a recipe worth repeating.

Great pie and easy to make with minimal ingredients. I baked the pie crust in a removable bottom tart pan for better presentation. May try Grand Marnier for the next one.

Very yummy! We did not have pecans, but it was wonderful without them. I wish we had had whipped cream. We made this as a last minute addition to our menu christmas day because we did not have a dessert planned and the grocery stores were closed. Very simple to make with ingredients you have on hand!

I love this pie! I've done a few experiments with it. Grand Marnier is a nice substitute for the bourbon as a change of pace. I also made a graham cracker/pecan crust that went very well with it.

My husband loves chocolate chess pie and asks for it on his birthday every year. I found this recipe and decided to surprise him with this version. He loved it as did our guests. I would make 50% more filling tho, as this amount didnt fill the crust very well. I served it with carmel praline ice cream. To die!

Super easy and delicious! I added more pecans the second time I made this pie and it was absolutely perfect. I made the pie crust, and then blind baked it by mistake - but it worked out great, did it the second time also. Everyone loved it and I wouldn't tell how easy it was to make!
