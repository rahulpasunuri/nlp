My Bad. I tried Jazz'n it up a bit and failed. I had to work with 16oz Phillips crab claw meat from the can and I twisted the recipe along the following lines: I failed to double the tomatoes and onions, No Lemon or Orange goodness. Instead, crab meat rinsed/drained and let to sit in one shot Herraduras White tequilla with the juice of half a lime and 1 tsp sugar. Lightly sauteed onions with clove of garlic in a splash of olive oil. Added crab mixture and jalapeno. Cracked pepper over top. Cooked over low-med until dry. Enjoyed a shot of Herraduras. When finished, folded mixture with 4oz goat cheese (Presidents) letting the heat of the meat melt the cheese. Added tomatoes and cilantro, and 10oz shredded cheese. The plus to this method was there was no need to seal the tortillas. This mix was thick enough on its own. End result was cheesy and crab goodness, lacking the exotic flavors I was hoping to capture during preparation. Strike one NCF ~ This is a work in progress ;-) PS ~ Shame to neuter the jalapeno. This needs to be corrected.

These were ok, but the flavor of the orange peel was too strong. Worth making once just to try something different, but I probably won't make these again.

Following other comments I sustitute lime for orange then add fresh sweet corn and red bell pepper. I also use fat free cream cheese. I make it every week in the summer.

This recipe is fabulous. I made it for a weeknight dinner and may serve to quests as an appetizer next. I think frying the quesadillas adds to the result.

I've made this twice now with shrimp; the citrus really elevates the recipe into something special. Reading the reviews that said the filling came out too wet, I gave the chopped tomatoes a good drain in a colander before adding. Substituted manchego cheese second time around, which was delicious.

This is a great recipe, but like others mentioned, it is easy for the ingredients to become over-wet. I've substituted a smaller amount of orange juice concentrate in place of the OJ, and I always use plum tomatoes that have been seeded. Fire roasted corn also makes a great addition, and gives them a bit more heft.

I love to make this dish. I always double the cream cheese. It might be better to go a bit lighter on the orange and lemon zest, but keep them in.

Rating: 2
The mixture is too soft for a quesadilla. If the mixture isn't dry enough, it just oozes out while you are cooking and makes a mess. I think this can be a super quesadilla by omitting the orange juice. Perhaps just diced roasted sweet peppers and real easy on the cream cheese. It does need some revising.

Great for a summer starter. I left the tomotoes out as they caused the first batch to be soggy and replaced them with chopped grapefruit segments

we loved this recipe. I made it 2 nights in a row...both for different groups of friends and everyone loved it. i only used lime rind and juice....the orange just didn't sound good to me....i alsoleft out the jalepenos...i am sure they would have added another dimension but we really didn't feel we missed anything by omitting it....loved these....

My Family and i love this recipe, it is quick and very taisty, also great for a finger food at parties.

I brought this to a casual get-together and received lots of praise. I accidentally mixed the zest with the crab - no big deal, but next time I'll mix everything except the two cheeses together, then just thinly spread with cr. cheese and top with jack. Very easy. The zest/cilantro/jalapeno combo was great.

Forget lemon and orange and use lime juice and zest instead. Put quartered mandarin orange slices over crab before folding. Gives a nice hit of sweetness with every bite.

This is always a crowd pleaser, as an appetizer or as a light lunch with a salad. The citrus is key. One can lighten up on the cheese.

I have made this recipy for over 4 years now and it always turns out great. It is easy, not too heavy, not too expensive and guests love it. Fantastic for the summer. Following some of the reviewers examples, next tiem I will try it with shrimp.

This was a nice dish. subtle crab flavor - kind of mexican fusion. We served it with the jicama and pineapple salad from August '95 and a lightly oaked chardonnay. Great bistro supper.

These are very good, I used shrimp instead of crab and more jalapeno, definetely in my do again recipes list

This has been our special tailgating recipe for the last 4 years - from Jimmy Buffett concerts to NASCAR races - everyone loves it. I have used imitation crabmeat, and its still a great recipe. I just mix everything up except the crab, throw it into the cooler, and mix the crab in at the last minute.

I made this up with shrimp instead of crab, and used the filling in puff pastry turnovers. They turned out great! I'll definitely make this again.

Very good. Used imitation crab since I'm cheap and had never made this before, and added minced bell pepper with the tomatoes and onions, eliminated the orange juice and peel, kept the lemon. My husband liked it and that's saying a lot.

I left out the citrus but I was still disappointed. I used what I thought was good canned lump crab, but the end result just didn't taste good. Using crab legs might have made a difference, but I'm not going to bother trying.

Absolutely fabulous! Easy to prepare on a work night. The combination of flavors is out of this world. This recipe has become a "staple" in my house. Darned if I can figure out the rare negative comment. Must be something wrong with their taste buds. Perhaps they're the basic baked chicken and potatoes type. My hubby and I can't say enought wonderful things about this recipe.

What intrigued me to try this recipe was the unique addition of citrus to the ingredients. I agree that it was too strong of a flavor. It wasn't bad...just wierd! Glad that I tried the recipe but honestly don't think that I will make it again. Very easy to prepare.

Rating: 1
A one-fork rating is partly my own fault -- I substituted low fat cheese, which liquified when cooked and ran out of the quesedillas. However, I felt the citrus was too strong and really distracted from an otherwise good dish. I tasted one quesadilla as I prepared others, and after tasting it I eventually I threw out the citrus cheese mix and saved the rest of the ingredients to make again with regular cheese. I knew it was a flop when my husband (who normally eats anything I cook) took a few bites, made a face, and put the rest back in the fridge.

I made this with fresh caught crab that a friend brought over. I would make it again, but with light cream cheese and light cheeses. The meal was VERY rich, but VERY delicious! To further reduce fat, I also sprayed the pan with PAM instead of using oil or butter and it worked great!

We made these for our supper club appetizer and they were great. Easy to make ahead and do at the last minute. We will use them as a light summer meal. The citrus was pronounced but not overpowering. I left out the cilantro also.

I don't know whats going on in Chicago and Seattle, but if you like crab and mexican food you will like this. We've made it a number of times. The only draw back is prep time -- lots of chopping. But it worth it.

Rating: 1
I totally agree with the cook from Chicago. Way too heavy and wierd. It sounded so good but my family was repulsed and the whole thing got tossed out. Perhaps it would be better in a different setting, at a summer party with cocktails sort of thing.

Awesome and Easy! I will use this recipe again and again.

I've made this dish again and again. Everyone loves it, and they assume you spent a long time preparing it. I always make the cheese mixture a day ahead, so the prep time is very quick the day I am serving it.

I liked this recipe's combination of crab and orange zest. It definetely needs the kick from the pepper. I made it once with Monteray Jack, but liked it better the next time when I used Gruyere instead. It had more flavor.

I made this for a father's day BBQ, and it received more compliments than any other dish. I used lobster instead of crab, and made a fresh tomatillo salsa, too. The citrus gives it a light, Caribbean taste. I was the only one who didn't think it was fabulous, but I liked it.

We Love these Quesadillas as an appetizer. They are delicious with shrimp as well. We always add a little something different every time we make it like fresh roasted green chiles.

I thought the citrus flavor gave it a nice zing. I thought that 1 whole quesadilla was plenty big of a serving.

This dish was just ok...it sounds delicious, but I don't think I would make this again. It was too heavy and I didn't like the flavor from the orange juice and rind. I would suggest omitting that from the recipe.

This was a killer dish. I,like kristin,baked the quesadilla's instead of frying and they were delicious. I also just used flat leaf parsley instead of cilantro, I just don't like the taste of cilantro. I would definitely make this again and again.

I actually made this recipe about 9 months ago. It was delicious! I used fresh crab from the east coast and served it to some special guests.

I made this dish just the other night, but with a couple of modifications. The first is that I baked the quesadilla, rather than frying it. Nothing was compromised in my opinion. Second- I added fresh, cooked corn scraped off the cob. A VERY easy addition that improved the dish exponentially.Give it a try!

Very tasty! I didn't have time to chill the cheese mixture,but it was great anyway. My kids thought it was so so, but the rest of the family raved. Great with a salad. Easy too.

This was a crowd-pleaser on a summer night of leisurely drinks and grilling. To have something for everyone, I used the basic cheese mixture recipe and made crab/tomato, shrimp/garlic, plain cheese, and chicken quesadillas. It is a very flexible recipe and I will use it time and time again. It was very easy, but looks very creative and fussed over.
