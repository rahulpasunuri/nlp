Excellent. I made it as per the recipe except that I added the zucchini at the halfway mark.

This was refreshing and delightful. I served it over frisee lettuce on a large platter and it looked lovely, and accompanied it with a red onion tart. I added the zucchini when the beans were 2/3 cooked, and doubled the sauce.

I prepared this for Thanksgiving exactly as written, but cut in half. The sauce takes a little effort to prepare, but it can be done ahead of time. As others have said, start the beans ahead of the zucchini, or the zucchini will be mushy. The result was really delicious.

Have made this sauce with grilled salmon several times and it's a perfect combination.

in France many of the sauce vertes may include, depending on availability, fresh spinach, watercress and /or arugula. I find the sauce at its best when used on cooked, cold or room temperature fish and meats, such a s lamb/beef roast, porkloin, tuna, shark...even salmon ... this particular sauce verte was based on basil as a keynote, but it is precisey the wonderful combined flavors of the above mentioned greens with the capers, garlic, lemon juice and mustard that are fabulous on cold roasts. i would use this sauce also over grilled vegetables such as in the presentation of the provençal "Grand Aioli"...

I'd call this recipe a good sign-post toward a decent dish, if you're an experienced cook and are looking for ideas. If you're inexperienced in the kitchen and need step by step recipes that will turn out brilliantly, look elsewhere. 1) As many cooks have observed, you should cook the green beans twice as long as the zucchini or the zuch gets mushy. SOLUTION: add the zucchini after the beans have been cooking 3 minutes. Cook an additional 1-2 minutes depending on how crisp you want your vegetables to be. 2) The savory ingredients completely overwhelm the fresh green ones. SOLUTION: substitute fresh orange juice for the lemon juice. Double the cilantro (better yet substitute curly parsley). Increase the basil to 1/2 cup. 3) You can't put that tiny amount of ingredients in a domestic blender and get a sauce, much less one that is slightly runny. SOLUTION: Double the recipe for the sauce and add 2 tablespoon of distilled water.

Had high hopes but turns out I am not a fan of the dijon mustard flavor on veggies. It was worth a try, though. Guess I'm a purist - back to the steamer!

A nice recipe although, for my taste, the beans and zucchini need to be cooked longer. I initially tasted the sauce from the blender and found it very salty/tangy, but when it was stirred into the vegetables it was fine, a great flavor. I'd certainly use the sauce again, substituting it for pesto on pasta but cutting down on capers or mustard.

We loved this. Did use the leftover salsa verde on brown rice the next day and it was delicious.

I enjoyed these flavors with the veggies. I did not though, cook the zucchini with the green beans from the outset anticipating that the zucchini would be mushy...glad I did so. I added them half way through which was perfect. I'm thinking this would be a good sauce over potatos - maybe a warmed potato salad.

so easy and fresh for summer. I took a suggestion and used 1 tsp of dijon instead of 2 and thought it tasted great. Would definitely make again. I over cooked the veggies and will keep a closer eye on them next time.

I am trying to eat more vegetables and this dish makes me want to have more than one serving! The sauce is very similar to pesto, but not as concentrated. I look forward to using the leftover sauce in quinoa or rice! YUM all around! I made this a side dish for citrus tilapia.

Simply, healthy, yummy. Easy summer salad to accompany grilled fish or chicken. Will be eaten again in our home!

Simple, healthy, tasty, easy. Used basil instead of parsley bc that's what I had on hand. It's probably yummy w any fresh herbs you have on hand. A definite do it again!

Made this with stuffed pork chops. It was a great compliment. It was a little mustardy so next time I may cut down the dijon to 1 tsp instead of 2. I also used sugar snap beans instead of green beans (because they were in the fridge) and it turned out great.

Had some of this sauce left over, I mixed it with mayo to use as a dip for my artichoke. It was pretty amazing.

Sauce was delicious! This will be a new standard, especially since my basil is growing out of control. You can put this sauce on anything. When the veggies were warm the basil flavor was the star, when they cooled the grilled veg stood out more and the basil flavor came in after. Light, healthy and delicious.

Excellent green sauce. Try it on any grilled veggies; I used zuckes, yellow squash and patty pan. The sauce was a welcome and not over powering accompanyment to the squash.

This was really good and easy. I used asparagus rather than beans as our beans are not ready yet (Summer hasn't really started in the NW yet). The other change I made was to simply roast the vegetables in a little olive oil and salt. That worked well.

This was a great way for me to use garden fresh herbs and veggies. I like my vegetables on the crisp side, so I watched this recipe carefully so I didn't over-cook. I cooked the green beans for a few minutes, before adding the zucchini as suggested by another reviewer. This was a tasty recipe and I will make it again. I'll stir tofu in with the leftovers for lunch tomorrow...yum!

This recipe was delicious! Used freshly picked zukes and green beans from the garden... cooked the beans longer per previous reviewer. Accidentally browned the zucchini, but turned out be very yummy!

I didn't need this for 6 servings and creating the sauce was hard with halved ingredients. What I tasted still felt "heavy" for me on a summer night.

Im having a lot of fun with Bon Appetits June 2010 issue because they dreamed up all of these mix and match combinations for main and side dishes. Today I tried Green Beans and Zucchini With Sauce Verte which I am going to pair with Salmon With Coriander Rub and Lime Cream tomorrow. With a tablespoon of capers in the sauce, the green beans and zucchini was rather salty. I doubt if this side is going to make the Bon Appetit Hall of Fame. It will probably work with the salmon though. http://michaelbeyer.wordpress.com/201 0/06/16/green-beans-and-zucchini- with-sauce-verte/

This was just ok. For vegans, the sauce verte would make a great pesto substitute. If your green beans are not skinny, start them at least 5 minutes before the zucchini.

The sauce was delicious. I don't like green onion so I omitted them from the batch I made. I concur - cokkthe green beans before the zucchini. Fast healthy and delish!

Both me and my sweetie loved this! I also roasted the zucchini and steamed/sauted the green beans. It tasted divine and used all things in season right now. Can't wait to have leftovers for lunch!

The sauce verte is delicious! The lemon juice and the capers give it a tangy kick and while I followed the recipe and served it with green beans and zucchini, it would be great over any vegetable and over couscous, rice, pasta, fish, etc.

This is a fabulous spring/summer way to prepare vegetables. I blanched the green beans ahead of time and rinsed them under cold water to make certain they were still crisp. The day of prep, I used a wok to quick stir fry the zucchini separately, then added a small amount of water to let them steam for about 1 minute, covered. Then I mixed in the green beans and covered again for another minute or so, just to warm. Turned off heat. Just before serving, I tossed in the green sauce, and served at room temp. Got rave reviews from my dinner guests. I'm keeping this one on file.

We made this alongside grilled jerk chicken and it was awesome. I didnt have any basil so only used a large amount of parsley. I steamed the vegetables and they were great. The capers really added a complexity to the sauce. Next time I'll try the veggies roasted as the other poster suggested.

The first time I made this recipe I found that the zucchini was very soggy but the sauce was delicious. The second time, I roasted the veggies and had a much better result and the sauce was even more delicious.

This was great. Had no problem with soggy vegetables. Perhaps the previous reviewers did not allow the oil to get hot enough before adding vegetables. I did saute/steam the green beans and zucchini separately for better control. Served this at a dinner party and everyone thought it was excellent.

I agree with the first reader that veggies did get soggy, I poured off the water that stemed them before adding the sauce. I think I would decrease the mustard by 1 tsp. I also would use only 1 if the two veggies, we did not think that the two complimmented each other.

I made this last night and it was pretty good. Next time I would grill/asute the veggies, as opposed to cooking in the water (they got soggy). Also, the sauce is very flavorful and the capers give it plenty of saltiness, so I do not recommend salting the veggies. I will make again with these changes
