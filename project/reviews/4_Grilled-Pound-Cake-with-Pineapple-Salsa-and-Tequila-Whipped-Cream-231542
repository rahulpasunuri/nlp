LOVE this recipe! Don't be afraid of it, everything melds together nicely. Do yourself a favor and get the Sara Lee frozen pound cake for ease. Don't omit a thing, it's all needed and comes together in the end.

Great! Made this for my BUNCO group and everyone raved about how much they liked it! It is a pretty dish too. I love when food looks pretty and tastes great! :) I used the Sara Lee frozen pound cake. I also sub'd Vanilla for the Tequila. I will be making this whipped cream for french toast and other dishes too.

Voted 3 forks for 6 out of 7 diners (seventh was not that fond of the mint in the salsa). I used the cornmeal pound cake from this site which worked well as it is quite sturdy, withstood the handling that the grilling takes and has a nice crunch to it. Great end end to a southwest themed summer barbeque.

Fixed it for a couple of friends. They had fun trying to figure out all the weird ingredients that was in it. I really liked the grilled pound cake. I would cut the pineapple into smaller chunks next time.

Holey moley was this good! Don't omit a thing, no matter how crazy it sounds. Used Sara Lee frozen pound cake (as it is easy and dense) and it grilled perfectly. A definite keeper in the recipe box!

Served this at a fundraiser picnic; everyone was delighted and one commented that it was like eating a pineapple mojito. Served it without the cream on a vegan pound cake and it was perfect.

I made this the other night and the reviews from my guests were fantastic! I was complimented by saying the dessert was restaurant quality. Fun summer bbq dessert.

Served this last night for a patio birthday celebration and everyone loved it. The flavors blended so nicely. Very different. Only request or comment was for more tequilla in the whipped cream! As people were leaving they were still thanking me for the great dessert!

A unique and incredible blend of flavors! I used Costco butter pound cake and a pineapple that was perfectly ripe. Green jalapenos worked fine,2 sounded excessive but are definitely needed for balance. This recipe will be at the top of my summer dessert selections!

A new family favorite. The unique ingredients make it fun for the chef too! Use a real grill and don't be afraid of the jalapeno-- that's what makes the dish!

I grilled the pound cake in advance, which worked okay but probably would have been better if they were still slightly warm. Diced up 2 jalapenos but then chickened out and only added one...wish I had put them both in. left the tequila out of the whipped cream - still good. Fast, easy, fresh, different, yummy.

I wanted a "grown up" cake for a birthday party, so I made the ingredients into a layer cake. I grilled the pound cake slices under my broiler, made the whipped cream and salsa, and layered them in a big cake pan. I decorated the top with drizzled dark chocolate syrup. Everyone loved this unusual cake and the flavors were perfect.

I cannot wait to make this one again- it was fantastic. I made this with green jalepenos, used a little less than suggested, but the recommended amount would be fine. I drained off the pineapple juice after chopping the pieces. Also, I suggest adding a little extra brown sugar as needed to taste.

My guests really liked this. The combination of flavors was excellent. I could not find red jalapenos so I used green. For color I added minced red bell pepper. I blotted off the liquid with paper towels to keep the pineapple from turning pink. I had some trouble with the pound cake sticking to my outdoor gas grill; so next time I'll use lower heat and spray with Pam first. (I used "Aunt Rose's Pound Cake".)

Oh yes, oh yes, ooohhhhh yyeeesss!!! I've made this as it's written -- amazing. I've also adapted it for the benefit of some chocolate lovers. I candied pecans and chunk dark chocolate together. Spoon regular whipped cream over pound cake, top with nut/chocolate "brittle" and a teensy tiny drizzle of chocolate sauce. Lordy! Yum.

I made this for the Super Bowl and There were absolutely no leftovers! What a combination of flavors. I would highly recommend this recipe. This could be served for a casual dinner dessert as well as in a more formal setting.

This was FAN-tastic!!! I made it a couple weeks ago and my hubbie is still raving about it! Friends were "MUCHO Impressed" too! The recipe is so easy and quick, but with the grilled pound cake and tequila whip cream, it just really elevates it to a different level! I'll be making it again this weekend! A definite keeper!! YUM-YUM!!~: )
