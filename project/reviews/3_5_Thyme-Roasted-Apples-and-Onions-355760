We made this last night with a roast pheasant, and with the haricots verts recipe that follows the apple recipe. The taste was really delicious, but I share the views of others commenting: my biggest complaint was the texture of the apples -- too mushy. I had hoped they would be crisp. So, I may try another kind of apple and less and lower cooking time as suggested. I also agree with cooking in one pan, both for simplicity and clean-up. My kitchen was a bit of a mess this morning!

I simplified the directions as per the recommendations of others. Make the glaze, then combine with all ingredients and place out on pan and cook at 475 oven. I cooked in the oven just for 35 minutes, turning every 10 minutes or so, then placed in a chafing dish warming on low for the next few hours, because I needed the oven at 350 - 375 for all the other dishes I was making on Christmas day. I thought the dish was excellent and would make it again, exactly the same way. Apples were crunchy but still done. Onions were very soft, but it was a good contrast and they picked up the cider taste. But I gave it 3 stars because there were some left overs, so I think perhaps the rest of my friends & family were not quite as fond of the dish.

This was actually quite amazing, but I only gave it 3 forks because of the weird cooking instructions. The chef that created this must have an oven that never burns anything. I carefully monitored the temperatures and placed the baking sheets as directed, but everything started to burn before they were nicely carmelized. So, when it was time to switch the pans around, I lowered the temperature to 400 and moved both racks closer to the center of the oven. I also reduced the cooking time by at least 10 minutes. It was quite delicious served as a side with roast pork loin. We used the leftovers to make an amazing brie en croute for Thanksgiving even! I'll definitely make this again with my cooking modifications.

The taste was amazing but it was too soft and soggy for my liking. So we ended up serving it on top of camenbert and that was a hit.

Very tastey

I made this and hated the texture of the apples. In my opinion, granny smith would probably work better than braeburn apples. Sounded like a great recipe, but I did not think it was all that great. I ended up using the apples in a red cabbage recipe and that worked out great.

Tried this yesterday as the main course with lemon honey salmon for dinner. It was fantastic though next time i will use a pork chop to balance out the sweetness. I am making it again next week, it tastes really good.

Loved this recipe. Went perfectly with Thanksgiving dinner. Next time I'll simplify and use one pan. Two pans are too much work!

After looking at the reviews, I simplified the directions. I mixed the apples and onions with all of the glaze and thyme, roasted at 450 for 45 minutes stirring every 10 minutes or so, and topped it off with some extra thyme. Sweet-savory and very yummy with Thanksgiving turkey.

Hi, I have not made this yet but want to make this for Thanksgiving this year. I just wanted to know if possible to pre-make a couple of hours prior to eating and keep warm? Do you think will get soggy? Or should be ok? Thanks

Delicious. I added rutabega's becuase we are bursting at the seams with them in the garden. Use our own unpasturized cider. Everyone loves it.

The flavors are really delicious, but, as the other reviewers, I didn't follow the cooking temp/time. After roasting both apples and onions for 20 minutes and pouring the glaze over, I returned the pans to the oven at the same temp (425). After 10 minutes I removed the apples, but roasted the onions 10 more -- perfect.

I followed the recipe exactly and must admit, after the fact, that the previous reviewers were correct. Either too high a temp or too long in the oven. Whatever, this was a lot of work and, in the end, didn't feel the final product was all that.

I agree that the recipe was incorrect. The cooking time was much too long and there was not enough of the glaze. Maybe the oven was too hot too--the glaze burned rather than caramelized. It was delicious, though, and I would modify it and try it again. I used herbes de Provence instead of just thyme.

I cut the roasting time by 20 min... agree with the first reviewer that the time seemed too long... the apples were soft enough after the first 20 min after drizzling the final amount of glaze... then just needed to be caramelized, and it was delicious!

Great potential but the instructions seem off. There's not nearly enough of the delicious glaze and the cook times or temps were too long or too high (not sure which). The flavor was good but I can't imagine the dish turning out like the photo without revising the recipe. I hope that others will have better luck!
