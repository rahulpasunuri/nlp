Please don't laugh at me as I am basically learning how to cook from scratch. What kinds of juices are you supposed to use with the raspberries? Thanks!

This is so easy and delicious! I use with chocolate flourless cake recipe from this site. I recommend straining twice to fully remove seeds.

A quick, easy, and versatile dessert sauce. Make it a day or two ahead of time and use it on a variety of deserts, especially with lemon or chocolate flavors!

This was a very easy, quick sauce that I used with Angel Food Cake. The one BIG difference: I added amaretto liqueur to the sauce. Raspberries and amaretto are a winning combination!
