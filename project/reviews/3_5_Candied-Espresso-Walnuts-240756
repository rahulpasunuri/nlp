I made these to have around for the family at Christmastime and several of us found them wonderfully addictive. A tiny bit more salt might not be bad but we loved them without any changes to the recipe as given.

Very good concept. I made as directed except for using a silicon pad instead of spraying a sheet tray. A couple of refinements are needed. First, double the amount of salt; 1/4 tsp isn't enough for 4 cups of nuts which may lead to the blandness some reviewers noted. Second, don't cook them until they're perfectly dry. Use the recommended cooking times; they'll dry out quickly as they cool. Third, as other reviewers have noted, this method lends itself nicely to experimentation. Next time, I'll add a pinch of cinnamon or cayenne to see what happens. Last, I highly recommend using a silicon pad. Clean up is so much easier.

While these are good candied walnuts, like other reviewers have noted, they do not have much coffee flavor - next time I would perhaps triple the espresso powder. Another tip, after I tossed the walnuts in the whipped egg whites, I salted them and tossed that BEFORE I sprinkled the sugar mixture over to be sure that they got an even coat of salt.

Just made these and they turned out great. They're a big hit with all my coffee loving friends. I did add in 1 Tbsp cocoa powder to boost the flavor profile. Also, they turned out a little on the sweet side, so I'll be reducing sugar next time.

A real hit with friends and family. I'm on my 3rd batch and my husband doesn't usually like nuts!

To Les Moore: You don't add the espresso mixture to the egg whites. You have the espresso mixture in a small bowl. Then you have the egg white in a large bowl & whip it frothy. Then add the walnuts to the egg white in the large bowl, and toss to coat. Then take the espresso mixture from the small bowl & sprinkle it over the walnut-egg-white mixture in the large bowl.

How do I "sprinkle walnuts with espresso mixture and toss to coat," when I did the "Add walnuts; toss to coat" already? Do I mix the walnuts with the eggwhite mixture, that HAS the espresso ingredients mixed in or sprinkle it on afterward?

Made these Saturday evening as a test run for potential Christmas snackies. Tasted batch #1. Yum. Immediately started making batch #2. These are addictive once you start snacking. Rave reviews when I took them to a Sunday get-together. To those who say this is bland, I understand there isn't a real "ESPRESSO!" flavor to speak of, nor any other truly strong leading tasting note - I thought cayenne would be a little obvious, but did add a little ground cloves to batch #2 and sprinkled both batches with additional coarse salt as they came out of the oven. I feel this brought out their cinnamon/coffee flavor, but I also like being able to still taste the nuttiness, not just spice.

Made these this afternoon using pecans instead. Think I didn't grind the espresso beans as fine as they should be so they look a little rustic. The flavour, though, is excellent so another couple of batches will be packaged up for Christmas Gifts. Simple and quick and I wouldn't change any of the spices.

Easy enough to make, but rather bland. Would definitely add a pinch of cayenne pepper to mix.

Wonderful! I added 1/4 tsp of Chinese 5 Spice; 1-1/2 TBSP. Ghirardelli sweet ground chocolate; and used 3 TBSP of Medaglia d'Oro because I did not have ground espresso. It is hard to stop eating these.

these were fantastic, the best and easy. I would do it again, again, and again.

These are absolutely fantastic!! I made them last year to give out as gifts to rave reviews. I decided to make them again this year to have on hand for the holidays - and they're even better than I remember! So fast and effortless, yet they look and taste great! I think I might have digested a few too many of these...hence all the exclamation marks! ;)

Very easy to make; even easier to package up as gifts. This recipe is going straight into my Christmas binder so I'll remember to make at least one batch every year. Like some other reviewers have mentioned, be sure your ingredients are more or less exact. I found the egg mixture to be perfect for 4 cups of walnuts - no more, no less.

These were the best. Made them with Starbucks espresso and gave them as gifts in little decorative bags. They were adored by recipients. Simple to make.

Excellent. Not too sweet. Great hiking snack since it has the kick of coffee.

Made with Illy Caffe and added extra Siagon Cassia Vietnamese Cinnamon from Denver's Savory Spice Shop, sprinkled with sea salt after they were out of the oven. Easy and Delicious - a smash hit with everyone who tried them. I will continue to make each year!

Huge hit at my recent Christmas party. I received so many compliments I didn't dare say how little effort it took to make them! It did take a little extra cooking time, though I suspect this might be due to the egg issue as below. Either way, highly recommended!

These were very tasty and my friends gobbled them down. I did a test run and made a mistake I want to warn about. The amount of egg is just right for 4 cups, but if you make a smaller amount, make sure and reduce the egg. I didn't and my walnuts ended up way too eggy. They took longer to bake and the sugar burned with only three extra minutes of cooking time. But I could tell what went wrong and tried again. All three other batches I made were extremely quick and easy and came out great. The nuts may be slightly tacky when they come out of the oven, but will dry as they cool. Resist the urge to increase baking time.

I made it with 2 cups of walnuts and 2 cups of pecan nuts and it came out really good! All my friends love it! I'll make it with macadamia nuts for Hawaiian party next time.

Had excellent results with these and they were so easy it's difficult to understand why some reviewers had problems. Possibly needed to use a larger egg? They are even better the next day! For the person requesting help in finding espresso powder; it's never been carried at my 'regular' grocery store but I can find it at Whole Foods.

Second recipe I used from the December issue that did not live up to my expectations. I noticed when mixing that the mixture was very granular, so I added another egg white. Flavor was a little lacking after they cooled so I sprinkled them with a mixture of cocoa powder and confectioner's sugar. I won't make this one again.

Hmmm...maybe I did something wrong? My sugar never "melted", so I have a bunch of walnuts with a very granular sugar and coffee coating. They also never stuck to the pan (as the directions imply they would). Any ideas what may have happened? My batch is less than excellent as other reviewers have suggested.

Excellent. Made several batches and gave them away to customers who raved. Has anyone tried using almonds?

I'm having trouble findind espresso powder - any suggestions of stores that carry it, or is it mail order only? Any substitutions?

Just spent the afternoon making 36 cups of these addictive treats! I'll be giving them to co-workers for the holidays... that is if they are not all eaten up before that!

I agree. These are very addicting and delicious. Next time I will use a pound of nuts since there was leftover egg white/espresso mixture.

Addictive!!! Loved this recipe as did everyone else I served them too at our church soup supper. My husband however, prefers my other nut recipe much better...too much espresso he claimed. I bought the espresso freshly ground from our local coffee shop where they roast it. I used one pound of pecans and it worked perfectly.
