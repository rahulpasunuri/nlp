I just made this last night. This is a great recipe and yes, it is labor intensive - but totally worth it. I used fennel pollen instead of seeds; and left out coriander seeds as well as the carrot, which I think that other than adding color to the dish it does not do much else. At the end, I also did not add the remaining lemon juice and oil , just simply reducing the liquid and it was great. I definitely will make this again.

This was REALLY delicious....but A LOT of work. Not to say it wasn't worth it (because it was) but this is not a quickie. I would say to make this for someone you love and they will be happy. I left out the fennel because I do not care for that and used ground coriander instead of seeds...sauce was YUMMY. I would definitely make this again and make double for leftovers!

I have made this many times. I add a bit more fennel and coriander because I love their flavors. I have also put the artichokes in the food processor and made an artichoke "tapenade" which is great as a bruschetta. Every time I have this I can't get enough! Yum!

Sounds tasty! Lucky, I have fresh artichokes, got to plant some more. Took me a while to figure it out, but the little ones taste delightful, and are perfect for braising & saute.

I've tried a lot of similar recipes, and I think this one is the best so far. The coriander and fennel are a beautiful compliment to the artichokes. Nom nom. It's labor intensive, yes, but that is the nature of the beast.

Very, very tasty. This was my first experience making artichokes and I was quite pleased with the result. I'll make them again tonight for guests.

I have been searching for almost this exact recipe since having one very similar at a great restaurant nearby. This was outstanding -- nice, tender leaves, flavorful all the way through, very good. I did not make the sauce at the end, as my husband is not a fan of sauces, but I did saute the braised artichokes in olive oil and some sliced lemons at the final stage and the outcome was really good. Look forward to trying this dish in its entirety sometime.

I enjoyed the lemony flavor of this dish. A bit labor intensive, and I didn't cut the chokes exactly as directed (not sure I understood--I left on more leaves because I like them) but it still came out well. Made a nice compliment to a veggie feast.
