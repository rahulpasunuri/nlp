This was the best potato salad I've ever eaten. I've already made it twice for company, and heard from two different people, "I don't normally like potato salad, but this is great!" Of course, I did make some modifications. I'm not that crazy about radishes or green onion, so I omitted them. I added green onion, chopped dill pickle, and a couple hard-boiled eggs. I even used half fat-free mayo and half regular, and it was still great! Looks pretty, especially with cracked black pepper.

I hate to be the one person who didn't think this was great but I have to be honest. Maybe I didn't cook the potatoes long enough or maybe I just don't love potato salad! Anyway there were plenty of leftovers so the next day I sauteed it with some onions and that was great!

The second time we made this it was better than the first. It will now be a standard with us. (BTW, it makes enough for an army!)

This recipe has it all flavor, texture, and color. Plus it's very simple to put together, I added a couple of cut-up hard boiled eggs to add more color and flavor. Great!!!!!!!

For the Potato Salad category, this is the best recipe I've found so far...4 forks for being the best tasting, easiest, etc...

A delicious potato salad. I particularly liked the blend of different colours given by the peppers, radishes and celery. I put a good dollop of wholegrain mustard in the mayonnaise to add to the flavour and look of the dish. Overall a great success!

To the cook in Connecticut ~ Every person (100%) who reviewed this recipe said he/she would make it again. However, not everyone rated it "a dish beyond compare", which is four forks. Three forks signifies "delicious".

This IS regular potato salad! This is how my grandmothers cook made it, my mother, and now me. I realize that it's hard to believe but, We were making this before Martha even came on the scene. It's delicious! You don't want to fool around with a good thing!

Delicious! I have made it several times and it always gets rave reviews from my family and friends. A super alternative to regular potato salad! Highly recommend.

I was just curious. If 100% would make this recipe again, why does it only have 3 forks instead of 4???

This recipe is a nice alternative to regular potato salad and I don't have to go to the deli and spend an arm and a leg for it. All you need is a little time and TLC.

Love the addition of radishes to otherwise basic potato salad. Gives a different texture and taste.
