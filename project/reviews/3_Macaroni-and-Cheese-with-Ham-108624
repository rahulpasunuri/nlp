I have made this to rave reviews multiple times. I have even made it without the ham for a vegetarian friend who loved it. My only change is that I leave out the lemon because my hubby doesn't like lemon in savory foods.

This was delish! Very rich, and the lemon gave great flavor. We followed the directions as listed and used quality ingredients. No need to season this...the cheese and ham lend plenty of that. I agree that this is best as a side dish...we served it with a bowl of roasted tomato and basil soup, and have plenty of leftovers.

I've made this several times and never had any issues. I can't imagine how it was "bland" for any of the reviewers, there's an entire bulb of roasted garlic and other delicious things! It is, however, very filling and rich, so don't try to make it for just two people or you'll be stuck with delicious leftovers. Oh no!

Absolutely disgusting. Will never make again. Bland and blech. I've had better out of a box, and I don't like boxed Mac 'n Cheese

I love to cook different varieties of Mac and Cheese. I cooked this one exactly as described. I didn't have a problem with curdling. I just didn't like it. It tasted like Spam and Cheese. Maybe it was just me as everyone else seems to like it, but this was a real disappointment.

I made this recipe exactly as directed last night and it was absolutely wonderful. I was a little nervous, because there was no thickening agent in it (Mom always used flour and butter) but this came out as thick and creamy as hers. I think the secret to keep it from curdling is patience - I stirred it almost constantly while it was reducing and it came out smooth as silk. The ingredients (including the lemon) blended for a unique flavor. I will definitely make this again.

This is really good. I used white cheddar and 3 cups milk + 1 cup cream. I did not add lemon peel until the end because I was scared of curdling. I can't wait to make it for company.

This is great but very rich! My husband and I ate it as basically a main dish, but it would be better as a side, really. I didn't use the type of ham called for in the recipe, but it was excellent anyway. I thought it reheated well, and I continued eating it for days.

Amazing! definitely not a substitute for boxed mac & cheese, it's far too rich for a main course, but it was an excellent side dish to a filet. reheats beatifully if you add just a little milk. truly gourmet.

I make this dish all the time. My husband and kids love it.

Yummy, I made this for a huge party that included lots of children. I was disappointed in how it reheated, especialy since we tried it right after I made it. The only reason I wouldn't make it again is because my children are just as happy with Mac from a box.

I was also looking for an alternative to boxed macaroni to feed my kids. This was a complete hit - the whole family loved it! I had no problems with the recipe - made it exactly as written and the sauce turned out smooth. I froze the leftovers and they reheated just fine. I'll definitely make it again!

My grandaughters and I made this, and it's a fun experience to see how to make Macaroni & Cheese that does not come from a box. p.s. - if you dislike it when people skew the ratings by giving opinions without testing the recipe, send a gentle email to the following reviewer, Pam (kraemercreative@san.rr.com), asking her "please, no opinions, just results feedback."

I HAVE not made this and even though this is presumptuous of me, I do have an opinion about this recipe; I was curious to find a "new" recipe for an old family favorite and ran across this one. I just have to ask one thing... Why lemon peel??? Who has ever heard of putting something into a white sauce that will curdle it? The lemon will fight with the other flavors (I'll just bet.) I make mine with smoke-cured bacon, onion, red pepper and 4 different cheeses including 8 oz of cream cheese. After looking at several recipes here I was sort of disappointed. I will stick with my home-style, Southern recipe that everyone raves about. If anyone loves this, please email me to let me know why.

This was my first time making Mac & Cheese from scratch and it is wonderful. I was a little nervous after reading some of the other reviews but I know there are many factors into making any recipe good. This is a fine dish and should please anyone who follows the directions closely and uses quality ingredients (cheese). I will make it again and again.

Very rich. My kids did not like this dish. I'll be walking on the treadmill for a very very long time!

We really enjoyed this recipe. I was looking for a way to use up some left-over smoked picnic I had on hand and decided to give it a try. I cut the recipe in half for the two of us, and other than using a different ham, didn't change a thing. I baked the garlic and made the sauce early in the day, then SLOWLY reheated the sauce at serving time, at that point stirring in the cheeses. Nothing curdled, and we thought the texture was perfect.

This was a disaster. I made this in September before it came on website. Perhaps Luxembourg cook's advice would have helped me. I make macaroni & cheese from scratch a lot, and often squeeze on a little lemon at the table. I was intrigued to see how The Federalist made theirs. But this curdled horribly. Tasted fine and everyone ate it. My family didn't realize it was supposed to have a creamy sauce, thank goodness. I wonder if the lemon peel should not be added till end? Or perhaps I didn't stir in cheeses "gradually " enough, or didn't turn heat off in time? It's probably worth trying again; loved the garlic and ham. But beware.

Creamy and delicious-the first time, I used ditalini and baked it after putting on the sauce, which gave it a firmer texture. The second time, I used wagon wheel pasta and didn't bake it-it was excellent both times. :-)

My family loved this dish. The sauce is so creamy and delicious. I'm making it again tonight!

My son, now a young man, frequently requests mac and cheese. My challenge is finding a recipe that is a bit more sophisticated than nusery fare. This is one. The roasted garlic gives a marvelous depth to the sauce (not sure what the grated lemon peel does, though) as does the thyme. I used prosciutto rather than Westphalian/Black Forest ham as both are "cru" and the former was half the price where I shop. I also, rather than add the ham directly to the sauce (which destroys the "cru" characteristic) topped the pasta with it as a "chiffonade". Finally a word of warning: once you add the grated cheese and it melts, do not inadvertently continue cooking the sauce. It will still taste great but not look so nice.
