Made these for the first time today and they were great. I was skeptical about microwaving the potato rather than boiling, but the rolls weren't gummy at all. I riced the potato right away to let cool. I replaced 1 of the TBS of caraway seeds for poppy seeds. Might add some black pepper next time. I also replaced 1 cup of the flour with white whole wheat. I baked them in oiled muffin tins and they were beautiful. That way I used only one rack for baking.

I have been making these Potato, Onion and Caraway Cloverleaf Rolls since the 1995 Bon Appetit edition was released. It just doesn't get any better than this. Not only do the rolls taste amazing but your house smells like the holidays! I always use my bread machine to have the dough rise, bare in mind, it will overflow slightly - but not to worry. It is a pretty stickey batter so make sure you butter your hands up well when you make the cloverleaves! I hope you enjoy this recipe as much as I have over the years.

I've been making these since the original Our Daily Bread article appeared in 1995. There is one thing that you need to know though and its written in the margin of my magazine. The total baking time at 375 is 20 minutes and the switching of the racks should take place at about 10 minutes.

These are so tender and full of flavor. They've become a Thanksgiving dinner tradition. My whole family loves them - could it be because we're German?!

Too much caraway (I used 2/3 of what recipe called for) for the rest of the family. These also don't rewarm well as many of my roll recipes do.

If you're searching for a virtually fool-proof recipe for fantastic yeast rolls, look no further. These delicious dinner rolls have become a staple at every holiday meal (and some wonderful "non-occasion" meals, too). They are melt-in-your-mouth tender, brown up beatifully, have a marvelous flavor and can be made by anyone who can follow a recipe. Try them -- they really are fantastic.
