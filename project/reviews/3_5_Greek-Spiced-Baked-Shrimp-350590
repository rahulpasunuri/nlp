Easy. Reliable. Satisfying. And a good basic recipe you can change to suit your ingredients. Tonight, I didn't have feta.. so I added sliced zuchinni and mushrooms to the sauce along with the shrimp, sprinkled some Pecorino Romano... it was delicious.

So easy and quick, yet so good! The cinnamon and allspice add such a different flavor than I expect with shrimp. I served with a basmati rice to soak up the delicious sauce.

This was a really good, quick, easy and healthy dish. I omitted the dill and sugar and used San Marzano crushed tomatoes. I served it over whole wheat pasta and kale sauteed with garlic, EVOO and chicken stock. I spritzed it with some lemon and it was amazing. My 11 year old LOVED it, as did DH and I. This will definitely be put into the rotation.

Loved the recipe...same as everyone else. I saved some time and energy by using diced tomatoes instead of whole. I think it cuts down the time you need to reduce and thicken. Not for kids. Too much spice for their taste, but just right for me!

I made this as a vegetarian entree for NYE and it was a hit! Made as written (but forgot the dill at the end) used brown sugar as the "pinch," and served over Israeli couscous. It was easy to make ahead and then just cook right before dinner. Would definitely make again.

Made this last night. The kids weren't too impressed, (they're young) but the hubby and I REALLY liked it. I also followed the suggestion of the previous reviewer to marinate. I had the shrimp marinate while I cooked the other ingredients, about thirty minutes. Usually when I make a shrimp dish it turns out tasting like shrimp and sides; this dish wasn't like that. It all blended together quite nicely. This dish is a keeper!

made this for dinner last night and my family loved it! i made sure to let the sauce thicken as per the directions and could see that if this step were omitted that the dish would be too watery. the flavor balance with the spices was spot on. my only additions to the recipe were to add the zest of a lemon and extra garlic. delicious!

not much work for this tasty dinner

True comfort food, without my usual comfort food staples of tons of butter/cheese/red meat. Halved the recipe, but stayed generous with the garlic. Marinated the shrimp in olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and garlic, per a helpful earlier review. It is *definitely* key to let the sauce thicken and reduce - I was disheartened by my initial taste-test after having just added the tomatoes and sauce, but the final product was warm and delicious. I omitted the sugar and added honey instead. Served over basmati rice. Side was an arugula salad with almonds and a honey lemon thyme vinaigrette.

It's not often that my husband and I find recipes we really weren't fond of, but this one definitely falls into that category. It was a rather exspensive meal that we thought wasn't worth the cost. My husband's review of it was, "A waste of shrimp." The flavor combinations just didn't grab us and I really don't know how we would alter it into something we'd make again.

Rating: 4
Hmmm, mixed reviews, but I think this dish is fantastic! I had no canned tomato, so substituted chopped fresh tomato, and added a small amount of tomato paste and water to create more 'juice'. It worked very well. The spices are subtle and a great match. Serve with thick, warm, Greek pita bread. The tomato and feta mixture acts as a dip.

I have been making another version of this recipe for years as my family loves this dish. the other one uses ouzo and i decided to leave it out this time as i was looking for something easy that my 15 year old son and i could make for his dad for Fathers day..This is absolutely delicious..the spices are different than the other recipe i use, but we all loved it..only thing i added was some kalamata olives..this one is going in my "make again' file. Oh , and we always serve this over orzo, as my son doesn't care for rice..it turns into a really filling meal

Rating: 4
This was great! I'm not sure why others felt the spices/seasonings were wrong-these are traditional Greek flavors. I did prepare it differently from the recipe as I'm vegetarian and my husband does eat fish. I used the suggestion of marinating the shrimp, and made the tomato sauce per the recipe, but added just a bit o f it to the marinated shrimp and baked that separately. I set aside some of the sauce, and mixed the hot, cooked rice with the sauce, topped it with the feta, and baked that. After the shrimp was cooked and the rice/tomato/feta was hot and browned, I plated them separately, and topped with the remaining sauce. We thought this was a great, easy, tasty and authentic dish (I'm half Greek, and make lots of Greek dishes) and I wouldn't hesitate to make this for guests.

This was OK, not fantastic and in my thinking, not really greek. I did not have fresh dill but i added toasted pine nuts, which added a lot. I didnt really taste the feta at all. Expensive ingredients which could best be used in other recipes.

This is really simple and fast. I've been working as a chef for a few years now and no, this isn't an extremely gourmet recipe. It's comforting, healthy, warm and satisfying. I followed it but added salt to the sauce and let the shrimp sit in a bit of lemon juice, salt, olive oil and oregano before draining and adding to the dish. I also used small shrimp, I think this helped them absorb more flavor faster. Skipped the dill.

Always a big hit with guests. If you like a twist to the usual shrimp dish this is a great recipe. You will definitely need some bread to soak up the delicious juices!

Rating: 2
Different, but in no way outstanding. As far as ease of the recipe, why would you start with whole canned tomatoes then drain and chop them only to save the juice? Why not just use chopped tomatoes to begin with that you don't have to "work" on?

I really liked this dish, though I did make a few modifications. I'm not much of a feta cheese person, so I subbed in some plain cheddar, which was great. I think anything that melts well would probably be fine as a substitute. In an effort to cut carbs, I served it over spaghetti squash instead of pasta - not the most absorbent medium, but still tasted great!

I realize there are mixed reviews, but I really enjoyed this dish. I followed the recipe fairly closely but added a bit more chili flakes and garlic. It is a fast and satisfying meal, perfect for weeknights. I used a bit of cornstarch to thicken up the sauce, and used frozen shrimp but defrosted them completely before using. I only let it cook for about 14 minutes and it was perfect. Served with plain basmati rice and got rave reviews from my guests.

Do all of you reviewers consider yourselves good cooks? I have cooked to rave reviews for years -- but this recipe was bland with a very drab presentation. Did someone actually say cut the spices in half? This meal was about as interesting as a Lutheran potluck dinner in Wisconsin. Heaven help us from such boring tastes.

I like this dish. its an interesting combination of tastes. The other 3 people at the table with me didnt care for it very much. I think it was a little too cinnamonny for them.

I have been cooking for 30+ years and this recipe is delicious. The person that rated it 1 spoon (wished she could rate it one) probably doesn't even know how to cook. One person commented to be careful, cook the sauce down and do not add frozen shrimp, this will definately make the sauce too runny. I serve it with Basmati rice, my whole family loves it! I have made this dish several times.

Delicious! I didn't add all of the reserved tomato juice (just about 3/4), and next time I will cut back on the cinnamon a bit, but otherwise I thought this recipe was perfect.

I dream about this dish! The combination of spiced sounded a little odd at first, but once it started simmering, it smelled great!! I didn't have allspice so I used nutmeg and 3 clove spikes crushed in mine. I also didn't have fresh chopped dill so I used dried and I added a pinch of cayenne with the red pepper flakes. Still tasted amazing and it was soooo easy to make! Rice or bread is a must - I used french loaf last time and think I'll be doing white rice this time.

This was the most terrible recipe I've ever made. I wish I could give it 0 forks. It was a somewhat more expensive dish to prepare with the fresh shrimp and feta cheese, but we had to throw the entire thing in the garbage. We're not picky eaters AT ALL, and we eat a lot of experiemental recipes gone wrong because we hate to waste food, but we couldn't even force this one down. I have no idea where the great reviews came from because I followed the recipe EXACTLY. Very disappointing!!!!!!

Rating: 4
This recipe is not only easy but healthy and very flavorful. I have made it a couple of times. I've substituted chicken for a friend who is allergic to shellfish and it was still a big hit. I have also eliminated the dill at times because I didn't have any fresh - still very good! It is definitely in my "it looks like a I spent a ton of time on this but it was really quite simple" bag of tricks.

Rating: 4
I love this recipe, and have made it a few times. One thing to keep in mind is that it can get a bit watery if the sauce has not been boiled down enough. Also, if you're using frozen shrimp, make sure they are fully thawed to avoid adding extra water when baking.

Rating: 4
I loved this but I made it with one huge alteration: I used salmon instead of shrimp. It was fantastic! Cooked the tomato mixture in an oven-safe saute pan, removed from heat, then submerged two 1/2 lb salmon fillets in the sauce. Baked at 375 for maybe 10 minutes (checked doneness with instant read thermometer). If you happen to have a hearty fish lying around but no shrimp, go for it! I used wild Alaskan sockeye, but this would be great with swordfish or bluefish too.

Good recipe but you're on your own when it comes to balancing out the flavors. That is, it can be too acidic with low quality tomatoes and too watery depending on the type you use. I personally had to decrease the sweet spices a little as they overpowered the rest of it. I also had to mix up pureed tomatoes with the whole as the resulting sauce was watery. Diced tomatoes may be a better way to go. Nonetheless, a good recipe. Keep the fresh dill as it adds a lot.

This shrimp bake is delicious! I am definitely going to be making this again soon. I added more sugar than the recipe called for - about 1 tablespoon - and it was really good. I served it with Near East pine nut couscous that I cooked in chicken broth with garlic. I stirred in some cooked frozen spinach and halved cherry tomatoes and squeezed some lemon juice in it. I served vanilla yogurt with cooked peaches for desert. Very good! I recommend this "healthy" menu. It may be healthy but you would never know it!

I halved the cinnamon and used a 29-ounce can of diced tomatoes rather than whole. It was fantastic. And, yes, the fresh dill at the end really does add that extra little something. Trying to lose a few pounds so skipped the crusty bread but will use the leftovers tomorrow over whole wheat pasta.

Absolutely delicious! super easy and quick too!

Great dish. My wife just loves it. I have made this many times  usually a half recipe using a small can of mini diced tomatoes. One major change for some  I omit the red pepper flakes and do not add a substitute. To me, the heat would only get in the way. One minor change, I usually do not add dill as a topping. We have it with angel hair pasta or orzo. I prefer the angel hair.

By way of disclosure, I love to cook seafood, but I haven't much experience with seafood bakes. Of the ten or so I've attempted, as often from recipies as not, this was a standout simply for the flavor combo: particularly, the feta/dill addition to shrimp/tomato. If I made this again, I'd want for a bit more something to balance out the acidity.

This is a wonderfully simply, easy, prep ahead dish that can't fail to please. You just need to buy great quality shrimp...not some bulk frozen shrimp that is on sale. So, woodryn from WI, I think you bought the wrong stuff...don't get me wrong- I am a terrible snobby food critic , but for me this recipe is one of those rare simple but good standby's for a quick great meal. Try it again! I think I used regular store bought tomatoes but maybe try fire roasted or such. I urge anyone to try this, it is worth it!

I got good results making this dish with frozen, cooked shrimp. I just tossed the almost-fully-defrosted shrimp into the warm sauce, let them warm up for a minute, and then poured the whole thing into a baking dish and put it under the broiler until the cheese started to brown and the liquid bubbled. I have no idea if it's as good as the original, and next time I'll try it with raw shrimp, but my family certainly enjoyed it!

I already had bay scallops in the house when I picked this recipe up off the internet. I decided to try it with the scallops instead of the shrimp. I can't imagine it would be any better with shrimp. If I had this dish in a restaurant, I'd be a return customer for sure.

I'm used to cooking with most of these spices in Greek cuisine but the results far exceeded my expectations! Since I didn't have the spices in powder, I ground them and have a feeling it gave it a touch of extra flavour. The house on this cold winter's day smelled wonderful too!

I didn't like the spice combination in this dish, but I liked the concept. I was able to prep it in my cast iron, which I then threw in the fridge when it had cooled. When the guests arrived, I threw it in the oven and then left it in the skillet to serve. So I think that next time I might make the dish in the same manner but with more garlic, and with spices like basil and oregano.

This dish was definitely interesting, but not worth the hour it takes to cook it. I was not a huge fan of the spice mixture with the feta combination.

Didn't have fresh dill, so added dry to to the spices, and topped with fresh chopped parsley at the end. 2. I had very little liquid in my sauce, so added some white wine when I initially added the tomatoes. 3. After cooking the tomatoes & onions for about 10 minutes, I pureed 1/2 of the mixuture (we don't like chunky tomatoes too much) and added it back in with some water - again- my sauce was extremely dry. I then reduced out most of the water. 4. I used canned diced tomatoes with garlic & oregano. I tasted my sauce before baking, and I thought it would be FAR too sweet, but with the feta & shrimp, it was perfect after baking! Oh, and the feta becomes extremely mild with baking, just fyi. Served with Basmati rice - and it was GREAT. Definitely going to go in my "super-easy" dinner file. Enjoy!

I would definitely make this again, withholding the dill. Make sure you make extra bread, as there is a lot of sauce! Also, pair with a salad or throw some more veggies in the sauce, I would recommend.

I mistakenly picked up diced tomatoes with green chiles. I used all three cans since I didn't have any other tomatoes in the house. THIS DISH IS FANTASTIC. We really did pass the pot around and soak up the juice!!

This was a great recipe and super easy to make. I added fennel because I had some on hand and it complimented the other flavors well. Definitely a make again recipe.

Like other reviewers, I was concerned about how the flavors would work together. I loved this recipe!!! It was flavorful, easy, and healthy.

I will definitely make this again. I added in carrots with the onion and garlic and the sweetness of the carrots really came out with the tomatoes and spices. I also used an herbed goat cheese instead of feta and put it over spaghetti squash. A healthy, delicious and easy dish that I will make again.

This was delicious and beyond easy. I made it on the stovetop after work with medium sized, frozen shrimp (yes, dumped frozen shrimp right in the sauce; they were small enough that they thawed within a minute or two and then cooked through quickly) and served it with pasta. It was devoured by my family, who requested I add it to our menu rotation.

Delicious! We still have lots of tomatoes from the garden to we used fresh ones instead of canned tomatoes. The dish was probably not as juicy but was excellent.

Wow, I thought this dish was easy,versatile (appetizer or dinner) and delicious. I didn't change a thing! Make sure you have a great bread!

This was delicious and easy to assemble. I actually made it 5 hours beforehand, put it in the casserole and let it cool. Then I crumbled the feta over the top of it and it was ready to go in the oven. DEFINITELY serve with a great bread 'cuz there's lots of good stuff to soak up.

To a cook from Edmonton....Sorry, but these spices are very common in Greek food.

The Feta overpowered the rest of the dish in my view. I would also use less cinnamon unless you really like the spice.

This was good. But I don't understand why this it's called "Greek-Spiced". Nothing specifically Greek about cinnamon or allspice or dill. Only the feta is Greek and cheese is not a spice.

What a great easy recipe. I didn't have allspice and used 5 cloves of garlic and it was delicious!!! The feta cheese definitely made this dish fantastic!!

I made this as a starter for my husband's birthday dinner and it was a huge hit. I was making duck so I wanted something with a spicy pow to counteract the richness of the duck and it worked out perfectly! Snaps to all of us who stayed with the recipe even though we had our questions about the cinnamon and allspice. But I do agree with those who left off the dill, it's fine with it but I think it would be fine without it. Great Great Great!

This was delicious!! So easy and really yummy. The cinnamon and allspice added such great aroma and flavor. I think my husband's exact words were, "This is really, really, really good." Served it over orzo with some crusty bread and it couldn't have been better!

I would use less cinnamon or leave it out. Otherwise, it was delicious.

OK you had me at Greek, this was a knockout recipe, and i am not a big Dill fan except in the Pickle but i liked this a bunch. The Poker Club critics gave it a thumbs up and it is now on our once a month menu. Good Work on this one !!

I followed this recipe except for the dill, which I didn't have. I was a bit concerned about the combination of flavors, but all I can say after tasting it is WOW! Somehow, all the falvors came together to a wwonderful whole. We had a simple salad and lots of crusty bread with it. A keeper!

Wonderfully spicy! I followed this exactly except for the dill at the end, I can't imagine that taste in this. It's wonderfully without it. I served this over brown rice, great for sopping up the tasty juices. Very easy, too, great for serving a bunch of people.

This was wonderful with some toasty ciabatta, and a sliced tomato and cucumber salad... a little spicy, but a tasty, tasty recipe!

So yummy! The spices and feta blend together beautifully. I was afraid those flavors would be too strong for the shrimp, but they weren't at all. The only change I made was that since I was using medium shrimp, I just stirred them into the sauce to cook. Then I poured the mixture into a shallow baking dish, topped it with the cheese, and ran it under the broiler. I was lucky enough to polish off the leftovers for lunch the next day before my husband came home and asked if there was any shrimp left!
