At first glance I saw a couple of changes that needed to be done to this recipe. First I roasted 5 whole heads of garlic instead of pan frying them, which mellowed out the garlic a bit. Carmelized Maui Onions skipped the shallots, whats the point. Used my version of creme fresh which is sour cream and heavy cream but substituted the heavy cream with buttermilk. Also you must salt to taste as you are cooking, noticed no salt was added at all to this recipe, bland is right. Most chicken stock is low-sodium so you need to add salt. Anyway followed much of the recipe from this point and it came out very nice. I own a restaurant and also a chef there so I am confident this will work for you as well.

This recipe is a big disappointment. Though it sounds as though it should be wonderful it is very BLAH and boring! I made it exactly as written, and planned to serve it as a first course at a dinner party. There was no way I could serve it as it was. I doctored and doctored it and am still not thrilled with the results. I'm assuming this recipe is from the RSVP column in Bon Appetit because of the comment at the top of the recipe. I avoid making recipes from that column as it is my experience that they are often disappointing. Chefs do not like to sharaing their recipes, and I suspect they alter their recipe for publication.

Such a disappointment! This sounded so delicious when I read the recipe and yet it lacked any distinction in flavor. It looked beige and more to the point tasted "beige". I followed the recipe exactly and we are great garlic lovers, but this just did not make any lasting impression other than how very non-distintive the finished product tasted. It might make a good basic "starter" type of soup base and then be improved upon by adding perhaps a good dry cheese, or prosciutto or sauteed mushrooms and a splash of brandy. Otherwise, blah - won't make again.

I served this at a recent dinner party and everyone loved this soup!! They all requested the receipe.I did not add the cream or the buttermilk because I felt that it would mellow the flavours out too much. This soup is at the top of my list for a favourite soup!!

My family (with the exception of my brother who thought it was grainy) LOVED this soup. My 14 year old was dissapointed that there were not more leftovers. Had it as first course this Christmas (madiera prime rib as entree - loved!). Will definitely make again. Easy too.

The garlic wasn't a problem (crushed the cloves with the side of the knife then peel). I would like to try adding a mild cheddar.

Like others who have reviewed this recipe, I found peeling the garlic time-consuming, but I had my 2-year-old at my side handing me pieces one by one so we made a nice little game out of it and she was pleased to be her mama's `kitchen buddy.' But she was even more pleased to eat the finished product -- she loved it as did her brother and sister (5 and 10) and her parents. The aroma as the soup simmer was terrific. I cut the cream by half to reduce the fat content and used the remaining buttermilk for biscuits. A definite keeper!

WARNING: I added too much buttermilk! Pardon the crudeness but it was a steaming bowl of vomit. BE CAREFUL! I wasted 2 hours peeling garlic (my love) and had to dump the whole thing.

I too found this recipe outstanding. As for the work involved peeling the garlic as mentioned by so many others allow me to enlighten you all as to a new, simply marvelous cooking tool. The Garlic tube. They can be purchased online or from Tupperware. I belive I found mine at a gormet cooking store. Essentailly, it is a rubber tube that one rolls vigorously on a flat surface and out pour naked cloves everytime. Effortless. This new tool will set you back $4.95 plus tax and is well worth it in my kitchen as I am sure it would be in yours.

I thought this bisque was very good, indeed. I have a similiar recipe which does not call for the onions, scallions, or buttermilk, and uses a mixture of chix broth & 1/2 & 1/2 instead - delicious in an entirely different way. By the way, a quick tip on peeling many cloves of garlic: Separate the cloves and put them in your KitchenAide mixer on low speed with the flat paddle beater and it does the trick in seconds without "beating up" the cloves (pun intended). Be sure to use the splatter shield. Many thanks for all the wonderful recipes you have all shared and rated!!

Too sweet, not very palatable for everyone.

A suggestion for those who like the soup but found peeling the gat\rlic too time consumming - Try Roasting the garlic(it's fast and easy) and reduce the quantity.

I'd make this again but it's a lot of work, and not just peeling the garlic! Plan to set aside a few hours, and make sure you like garlic. When you cook all the onions, you need a huge pot until they break down. Tastes good.

You must love garlic to enjoy this soup - it was wonderful!

Delicious but not for everyone. My husband found it too sweet. But with a big bowl, a glass of wine, some warm fresh crusty bread and a salad you've got a fabulous meal however to enjoy it you must love garlic! I'll be making this again as soon as fall arrives.

This soup sounded wonderful but I was disappointed in the outcome. Perhaps it's okay in small portions as an appetiser but you don't really want to eat a whole bowl of it. Pity, considering the amount of time it takes to peel 4 heads of garlic.

Brought this along to a big Thanksgiving dinner in November, and it embarrassed the host -- the only dish made by someone else overshadowed the rest of the feast! Delish.

This bisque was pedestrian and not worth the effort that went into it. It could be made better by carmelizing the onions.

I enjoyed the bisque although I would not recommend basing a meal on it. The garlic was potent enough to ward off some dinner guests as well as vampires.

This soup was wonderful! The onions gave it a little "sweet" taste. I own a tearoom and do all of the cooking and my customers raved about it! A dollop of sour cream on the top is good for the garnish!

This is delicious however a lot of work. My husband really enjoyed this soup however our sons with less refined tastes were not as excited. We will definitely make it again.

This is, without a doubt, the BEST recipe I have ever tried. Nothing compares! No complaints--as others have suggested, if you can buy pre-peeled garlic it will save you tons of time. If not, it is well worth it to peel away!

Divine! I served it at a recent dinner party and not only did my friends ask for the recipe but also to take home some leftovers! I am serving it on Thanksgiving and expect my guests to give many thanks.

Nice for a fall evening with a loaf of french bread and a bottle of red wine. I can buy peeled garlic cloves (in 1 cup containers)at my local market, and this saves tons of prep time.

I left out the cream and buttermilk completely and it was very creamy and delicious!

I made this recipe for a dinner party and everyone asked for the recipe. The peeling of the garlic is quite time consuming, but well worth it. Serve it with a hot loaf of bread...

Classic combo. Guests really liked it. Needs a bit of color in a garnish (diced red bell pepper perhaps?). Might also make nice sauce (with a touch of butter)
