I've been making this for years. Rib-eyes, tenderloins, N Y strips, it doesn't matter,all are good. Try it!

Excellent, can use this on rib eyes or any other cut of meat; very good on filet mignon steaks. Form the butter into a log on top of saran wrap and refrigerate; put a slice on the steak as it rests. You can freeze the log and defrost as needed.

This recipe is as easy as it is delicious! The flavor of the blue cheese walnut butter is amazing. A little goes a log way. We grill the steaks instead of sauteing, which does not take anything away from the taste. I have made this several times and will make it again soon.

This is an incredibly easy and impressive-looking meal. Make the blue cheese/walnut butter ahead and grill the steaks for an incredibly easy dinner party meal. Though probably pretty unhealthy, the butter is delicious when spread thickly on pumpernickel toast.

Very quick and truly fantastic. So simple to put together that I'll make it regularly for anyone who wants the Blue Cheese and Walnut toping on a steak.

Really delicious could probably even leave out the butter and just sprinkle the blue cheese and walnuts atop the steak for a slightly more healthful meal.

Very tasty! I was very close to giving it 4 forks- we'll call it a 3.5. My husband slightly overcooked the steak, but that's hardly the recipe's fault. I love blue cheese- the stinkier the better- so maybe that's the ticket.

I recommend toasting the walnuts yourself, the flavor will be stronger and will not be over powered by the blue cheese.

I was looking for something quick, easy and delish to fix and this just took the cake. We both really enjoyed it. I tried it with black walnuts instead of regular walnuts, my husband said that is what did it for him. I would suggest trying it with the gargonzola cheese if you are looking for a milder flavor because I used danish bleu cheese and there is definately a bold flavor to it.

I haven't made this yet but it is in my recipe box as 1 to make. I love bleu cheese but if you want a milder flavor, try gorgonzola. Same texture as bleu but lighter taste. I'll rate the recipe when I make this.

My finance and I loved this dish. We would be proud to make this meal for our friends and family and are eager to do so! As a note, I substituted beef steak with turkey mingnons wrapped in bacon and it was wonderful!

As A Caterer, I used a filet then pared it with the Baked Stuffed Sweet Potato with Cranberries, Pears, & Pecans and the repeat requests lasted all Winter! To lower cost we once used a strip steak and that was fine to. I reccomend this highly.

We really like this recipe, but be forwarned, you have to like blue cheese (which I do)

I was really looking forward to making this dish, but unfortunately it didn't live up to my expectations. The blue cheese was too overpowering for the steaks, but if you really love blue cheese then maybe this is the recipe for you. I won't be making this again.

Delicious! I combined margarine and butter instead of all butter and it tasted great. Butter mixture is great on veggies afterward as others have mentioned.

Although this dish was a little less tasty than I thought it would be, it still is quite good, and my guests loved it. Also, the butter keeps for a long time and is good on lots of other food, including bread, chicken, and vegetables.

This was not only VERY easy but it tasted PHENOMENAL! I am not a big fan of blue cheese, but the mixture of the steak, cheese, walnuts & butter were amazing. A definite "must make" recipie!

I tried this when the recipe appeared in the magazine. Leftovers are wonderful on pork as well. The flavor combination is wonderful with both white and red wines.

The combination of flavors is an excellent compliment to the beef. Served it to family and they all raved. The best part about it is...EASY!

Very easy and wonderful for a steak craving!

Beyond easy, and quite tasty as well. The walnuts provide great texture, and my dining companion -- who had never had blue cheese and beef together -- became an instant fan.
