These cookies are a mystery. I have made them three times: First time, they were perfect, delicious & beautiful! Second time, the meringue fell after the last addition, never forming stiff peaks, and the result was flat, ugly, sticky (but very tasty) cookies. The third time, I followed the recipe to a T, watched the meringue fall again with the last addition, and ended up with dry, flavorless cookies. I don't understand these cookies, but I think I've been teased enough ;)

Really tasty and hard to resist. I followed recipe -I let the egg whites warm to room temperature to ensure volume- but they turned out very thin and flat. Me and my guests still loved them, but I wished they had turned out like the photo: little fat cookies instead of large and thin. I did add chopped chocolate chips they went well with the pecans and mocha flavor.

I just ate one right out the oven and it was delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, and didn't add chocolate chips. (If I did I would probably get the mini chips. These are so thin and crispy, the regular chips might seem too overwhelming.) I ground the pecans to a pretty fine size instead of chopping them by hand. I'm hoping they freeze well - I'll submit an update!
