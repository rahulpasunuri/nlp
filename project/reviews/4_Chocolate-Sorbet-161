I think I used the wrong cocoa? Is cocoa powder the same as baking cocoa? The sorbet was very strong and borderline bitter. I would use sweetened cocoa next time. Also, I would double the recipe.

This is delicious and unbelievably easy! I started a (almost) no-fat vegan diet recently and have been looking for something to satisfy my chocolate cravings. This is it! A relatively guilt-free dessert worthy of dinner guests.

Very good if you like a coffee flavor in your sorbet. Served with fresh raspberries.

FAB and easy peasy too. I am a huge fan of chocoate sorbet and have tried other recipes but this one has that icy richness that I so crave. Takes no time to throw together. I served it with rasberries and everyone loved it.

Forget Haagen Daaz's chocolate sorbet. Thi is delicious and unbelievably fudgy for dairy-free.

Very rich, intense chocolate flavor with hint of coffee. It's hard to believe there's little fat in this, because it's very decadent tasting.

This is a really good, fudgy sorbet. It reminds me of a Fudgsicle. I have made it a couple of times, and those who I have served it to loved it.
