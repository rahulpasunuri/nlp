I made these for Christmas last year. I got the smallest, most tender and sweetest reds ever. I used part olive oil and butter. Lovely. Delicious and elegant.

I gave this 4 forks because it's so, so simple. It's super fast. It's presents very well and it's so classically tasty. (butter, potatoes, salt and parsley, right?). I used larger pink-skinned potatoes. I will use smaller ones next time. Also...make sure you use a metal backing pan to get that gorgeous crispy, brown color and texture on the bottom. My glass baking pan did not yield the same result.

I give this four forks simply for the idea and how beautiful they turn out! Very tasty. Made with potatoes of various sizes though, and I think it works best with smaller ones. The larger ones got a bit bland. Served with swordfish and green beans...delicious!

Very great preparation! I used small to medium yukon golds and almost burnt them. The took about 25 minutes. Could use way less butter I think. Very good though, creamy and moist with a yummy crust, and so easy.

Beautiful and easy. Works well with redskins. With "flatter" potatoes they are done in 35 minutes.

This recipe was easy to make and received rave reviews from my guests, even from people who didn't normally like potatoes.

Really outstanding. Used Yukon Gold potatoes because that's what I had and they looked absolutely fabulous and tasted wonderful! Don't hesitate to make these for company - they're beautiful. I was worried that the butter would burn (450 degrees for 45 min), but didn't - just a great caramelized color on the cut side of the potatoes.

I have made this four times already this summer! Rated SO highly because its [a] simply elegant [b] has the "wow" factor of a never-before-seen dish for guests and [c] very versatile: I have ventured far afield from using mere parsely. The 3-D herbs don't work [like a sprig of rosemary or basil] because they don't stick. BUT you can use rosemary if you pull the individual leaves off the stem - can arrange in a "starburst" design, etc. Other winners: sage, lemon verbena, summer savory, fennel or dill - mix & match for delightful result.

I thought this was a great way to dress up a baked potato! It was delicious (though not healthy), and I'm sure that cutting the butter is a good idea (I still had excess at the bottom of the pan after they cooked). I served this with rack of lamb and they went together very nicely.

Yummy, buttery potatoes. I used a lot less butter & they were still delicious. If the leaves come off, you can smooth on a fresh one before serving. Will be making for Thanksgiving again today.
