I didn't read the other reviews until I'd already made it, scary, I thought I was going to have to throw it out. The stuff is not to be consumed alone or in big spoonfuls but we used it on the side to spice up a brown basmati rice/veggie casserole, Kids don't like spice. The grownups used a tablespoon or two of this sauce -- it was pretty good. My husband likes it and says it mellows a bit after it sits a while. I didn't have lemon juice so I used rice wine vinegar.

Yech! I've really liked just about everything I've found on this site, but this one....the flavors just do not go together. Too much curry, too much acid from the tomatoes. My will-eat-anything hubby made himself a peanut butter sandwich, and one for me too.

The curry flavor of this sauce was too strong - too much just curry. (This coming from curry lovers).
