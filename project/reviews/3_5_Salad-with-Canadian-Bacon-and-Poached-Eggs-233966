Very good! Breakfast for dinner... I served it with a slice of toasted Ciabatta bread with a slice of home made bacon then a fried egg on top. Country ham would be excellent, too.

My husband won't eat frisee, so I made this with romaine (which was fine). I love this salad when I eat it at restaurants but when I make at home again, I'll fry the eggs instead of poaching them. Love the Canadian bacon sauteed with pepper!

This is a fabulous salad served at French restaurants in New York City. I was a bit reluctant to order but after eating it -went straight to Epicurious.com to find. I substitute the canadian bacon for REAL BACON CHUNKS. I buy a SLAB OF BACON and cut the lean from the fat and dice into 1" pieces. Also, I fry the eggs in olive oil - just to cook through- BETTER THAN THE POACHED (difficult to work poached) TRY IT!!! Our family loves it!
