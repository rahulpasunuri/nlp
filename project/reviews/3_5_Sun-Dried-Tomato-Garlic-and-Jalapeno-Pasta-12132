I made this pasta for a quick weeknight dinner. Added chicken - used fresh jalapeno and whole wheat spaghetti. Instead of Parmesan cheese, I used goat cheese at the end to finish it and make it a little creamy. It was the perfect quick dinner

I have been making this recipe since I read it in Gourmet in 1992. Quick, easy, and satisfying.

I have been making this recipe (or a version of it) since 1992. Friends/family ask for it constantly. I use farfalle, and the sauce nests perfectly!

I will be the first to admit that I am not a superb cook. This recipe is really simple to make and gives off an excellent result. I will definitely make this again! :)

This is such an easy and fresh recipe, it's definitely a keeper for us! I substituted about 1/4 cup chopped, roasted green chiles (they're HOT!) from my brother-in-law's farm in Northern New Mexico and used Penne pasta instead. I don't think the type of pasta matters (as long as it is thick enough to cut the heat of your chile choice), but I DO think the roasted green chiles (if you can find them hot enough) really add a depth of flavor and smokiness you won't get from jalapenos. I'm wondering if subbing cilantro for the parsley might not be a bad idea if you want more of a southwest flavor.

We have been making this recipe for ten years and absolutely LOVE it!!!!! (We typically substitute linguine for the lasagna noodles and once in a while add green onions)

My husband liked it. I didn't think it was anything special. It was easy to make.

Well, I used fresh jalapenos and followed the recipe and there wasn't enough heat or enough of a sauce for me. Added red pepper flakes afterwards to give a little more heat. Next time will try with pickled jalapenos.

This was easy to make and was a nice change from pasta in a red sauce. I used fresh jalapenos and used maybe one or two less that was called for and it was certainly spicy but not too much so. Also, i doubled and it was plenty for 3 people, but i don't think enough for 4.

This is one of our favorite recipes. We have it often.

This was really quick and easy - and quite tasty. We used fresh jalapenos. Fresh sage instead of parsley. A keeper.

I was very pleased with how well this simple recipe turned out. I substituted pickled hot peppers rather than jalapenos specifically because that is what I had and also used a more traditional pasta shape. My friends were impressed!

Quick and easy. I followed the directions in all areas except I used salted butter and eliminated the addition of salt later. Nothing exceptional but good for a fast dinner...... KIMBER

Very unique taste. Quite good. Not overly spicy. I had to watch out not to burn the sun dried tomatoes though. Went very well with a salad using the jalapeno, lime vinegrette found on this site.

This is the best pasta recipe that I know of. It makes original use of lasagne noodles and is absolutely delicious. We have had it at least four times.
