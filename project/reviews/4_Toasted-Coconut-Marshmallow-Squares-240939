I've been making this recipe for a few years now and I really love it. I always get compliments from others and my husband and I enjoy these treats immensely. Yes, it's tricky to get used to working with this messy goop, but it's worth it, so don't hesitate. And yes, I agree, that using a stand mixer greatly reduces the amount of time it needs to be beat.

A wonderful recipe, a repeater every single year for Christmas cookie/candy gifts. The fun thing is, they are so easy yet many people are amazed-- "you MADE marshmallows????". :)

These are really fun and I think I'd like to try them dipped in chocolate.I used the 9" square pan and thought it worked perfectly. However, a couple of them went a long way and I think these would work nicely in a tin of sweets where you could alternate them with other items.

Made exactly as written. WOW! These were as good or better than I had hoped for. I'll be making these again for sure!

I also used my Kitchenaid Monster Mixer for this recipe. I followed to the letter except had to subsititue dark corn syrup for light - it's what I had on hand and was impatient to try this recipe. Amazingly, the finished product was snowy white and the taste, although somewhat "dark syrup" tasting, was quite good. Some pieces received a dipping in good dark chocolate, with great success. My marshmallows were soft and tasty, but not very airy, which may be an expectation from commercial marshmallows. I may have over cooked the syrup a bit, as result of living at high altitude and making adjustments can be tricky.

This is fabulous and very easy to make. I have a profession Kitchenaide so it didn't take 15 minutes to get all puffy, it was more like 10. Also, make sure you are generous with buttering/oiling the pan or it will be very sticky getting it out. Lastly, I definitely understand why they recommend doing this on a dry day as the sticky factor can be an issue. These are well worth making and more!

What a great, straight-forward, and delicious recipe. So simple to make and with fantastic results...this will definitely be joining the holiday and special occasion repertoire. I have already been experimenting with the basic recipe, making mint oreo marshmallows (substitute peppermint extract for the coconut extract, add some green food colouring with the extract, and roll in oreo crumbs instead of coconut) and I'm hoping also to test out a maple pecan version.

Never thought marshmallows were so easy to make. We loved the coconut aroma and I'm asked to make them again and again and again.

Marshmallow Heaven!!! First, I was over the moon with excitement when I was actually making marshmallows. Second, amazing taste. It was a great hit with my Indian friends who come from a State of Kerala in India where Coconut is used a lot. Third, I will be making these every Xmas. Try it - you will not be disappointed.

This such a great recipe. Easy and unbelievably delicious.. I eat them like candy!I made them as Christmas gifts 2 years ago when they first appeared in the magazine and am making again tonight.Most people have never had a homemade marshmallow and can't believe how good they are. Just be sure to use good vanilla and coconut flavoring.

I love this recipe! I have made them each Christmas since it was published. I have made them with and without the coconut. I also made one batch with peppermint extract and another plain vanilla but dusted in cocoa and confectionary sugar. They make great gifts with hot chocolate! I plan on making these again this year, and might try raspberry extract or chocolate.

I made roughly 180 of these bad boys and gave them as favours at my wedding. They were perfect! The are so easy to make (batch after batch!) and basically foolproof. Delicious on their own, in a cup of hot chocolate, but don't try to make a s'more out of them - they melt into a sticky puddle (yummy, but messy.)

Delicious and fun to make! A great and unexpected addition to a selection of finger desserts.

I love this recipe. I was referred to it from Alexis Stewart's blog (www.whateverradio.com) about a year and a half ago. I have made them several times and each time I get rave reviews! Pointer: make sure you run hot water into your sinc/drains for a bit after rinsing the bowl. This will prevent the sugar from coating/clogging your pipes.

Perhaps, Shiloh78, you should have allowed your boyfriend to rate these? Freeze marshmallows for about an hour before (quickly) dipping into warm chocolate. These marshmallows were delicious! I made my first batch of marshmallows a few years ago and was surprised at how easy it is, not to mention being so much better tasting than those you buy at a store. One thing, and I am surprised that nobody else mentioned it-- this recipe will never fit into any pan less than 9 x 13. I had oiled and sprinkled the coconut on a 9 square pan and, when I saw the quantity of marshmallow, I prepared a larger one. Perhaps because, since I was using a KA stand mixer and allowed the mixture to be beaten for the full amount of time, there was more volume? This recipe made beautiful ¾ cubes.

Dipping in chocolate didn't work--maybe there's a trick I don't know about...freeze them first maybe, but they melted! I turned it into fudge.

I only gave it two forks because of the coconut, however, my boyfriend loved it because of the coconut. I'm going to make these sans coconut, add peppermint flavoring and pour them out into a bar pan, use miniture cookie cutters to cut them into shapes, and them dip them into semi-sweet chocolate. I think it'll be a fun new xmas treat and gift and also great with hot cocoa.

I have not made these but just received a batch at a cookie exchange. They are WONDERFUL and totally addictive! They were perfectly soft and squishy. I know my friend had trouble finding unsweetened coconut but definitely go the extra mile to find it. It was nice and crunchy and not too sweet- the perfect foil for the mallow part.

exceptional, because who knew you could make these yourself? fairly simply, on top of that. big wow factor, plus you can make them waaaay ahead of time.

This was a wonderfully easy recipe to make and it was certainly gourmet all the way! They held up great and tasted decadent! The preparation suggests dampening your fingers to press the marshmallow into the baking pan, but I found if you spray parchment paper with non-stick spray and lay that down, you can easily spread the marshmallow into a nice and uniform surface! I made these for Christmas and I'll be making them again for Easter (and dipping them in colored sugar to make "Peeps")!

I don't know if I will ever eat regular marshmallows again! I will definitely be making this recipe in the future.

Noboby could believe the difference in taste of a homemade marshmallow. I will be making them for a New's Eve Fondue Party to dip in chocolate...yummy

This is the third marshmallow recipe I tested and by far the BEST! We loved them and my husband asked me to make more now that they are gone. Texture is perfect and not too sweet. I made them about 10 days ago and they kept nicely.

Reliable recipe. Fun to make and to eat. They are so pretty, just like on the picture !

I made these just as the recipe indicated except I used a hand mixer & I found I only had to beat the mixture for about 7 minutes instead of 15. They turned out delicious, they really do stand on their own. What a novelty to make your own Marshmallows. My guests couldn't believe it.

I love coconut and these marshmallows are delicious. This is the first time I've tried making marshmallows. Homemade does taste much better than store bought. Coating the sides of the pan as well as the bottom with coconut helps the marshmallow out of the pan with ease. Hot water will help with clean up and some cooking spray on the knife before cutting minimizes stickiness.
