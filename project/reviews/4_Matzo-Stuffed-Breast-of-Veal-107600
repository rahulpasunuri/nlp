I've made this two years in a row for Seder. It is delicious, and not too difficult to make. My butcher always gives me the breast with the ribs, so it is a big piece -- I fold it over in my dutch oven and cover with foil. I also don't sew up the pocket: too hard for me. Delicious, but at least for me, not nearly as beautiful as in the picture. Also, this year I cooked it a week ahead, covered well, and froze the whole thing. It defrosted and warmed up wonderfully, and I had the opportunity to defat it as well.

Fab-u-lous! Passover doesn't have to mean dry, roasted chicken anymore! This stuffing is delicious and moist - and doesn't have the overwhelming matzo flavor prevalent in many recipes. Even better reheated!

Made these for a friend in the office who is often left out of the "treats" brought in. NO ONE could tell the difference, everyone loved them and got looks of disbelief when told they were wheat free. Major hit.

Made this for 12 people -- 14lb veal roast with bones -- huge, but marvelous. I doubled the recipe and instead of matzo used a loaf of gluton free sliced bread, cubed and dried, for a guest with a diet restriction. Heartily enjoyed by everyone, just great, held together beautifully and barely any left-overs. More than worth the angst and expense.

Wonderful flavors...accidentally bought a veal breast w/bones, so cooked it in a roasting pan instead of dutch oven. Cooked uncovered for 30 mins., then sealed tightly w/heavy duty foil. Came out perfectly and was marvelous...so good, it almost didn't make it to seder. Would make this yr-round.

I rushed to make this when it was first published, as it reminded me of the stuffed veal breasts my nana made many years ago. She used coarsely grated potatoes in her stuffing. My first effort came out beautifully and brought tears of joy - it tasted like my childhood, only better. The second time, however, was a disaster - probably the butcher's fault, as the veal breast was fatty, tough, and inedible. It all went in the trash. Now that we buy our meats at Whole Foods, I may try this again.

Was a wee bit nervous but it came together so easily. Made as sugggested, 2 days ahead, worked out just fantastic! I too, like matzo. More recipes, I hope?
