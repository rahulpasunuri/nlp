Delicious, holds it's shape well, non-greasy, creamy. What else can you ask for? I did end up adding a few extra drops of vanilla extract and a tablespoon or so more of powdered sugar otherwise it might have been a little too cocoa-y. I made a simple chocolate cake with a layer of this frosting and fresh strawberries. It made just enough to cover two 9in round cakes with a layer in between.

Everyone enjoyed this - The 'extra' icing was served in a side bowl. My adjustments abbreviated the chilling time in step one. I elected to chill the bowl, as well as the milk, while I worked with the dry ingredients. I measured the powdered sugar and the cocoa powder together into a small bowl. Then sifted the two powders twice so they became a fine powder. On low speed I mixed this fine powder and the pinch of cream of tartar with the chilled milk in the chilled mixing bowl until well blended. As the mixture was still 'chilled', I proceeded to step two - the whipping cream. Note: Strawberries are a wonderful garnish as well as a strawberry puree drizzled on top of the cake prior to icing.

Simple, delicious and perfect for angel cake. A favourite.

This is now my standard chocolate icing for everything - I love it! Always gets rave reviews. I was always concerned about the stability of whipped cream icings, but I can make this one hours before, ice the cake, keep it refrigerated and it stays perfectly. It is still good (just not as great) two days later (cake doesn't last much longer than that).

I really loved this, however I also think I may use sweetened cocoa powder as it tasted alot like cocoa powder almost to much so. Great recipe though. Thanks so much.

I have made this cake for years for my son-in-law . His mother made it for him but is no longer with us.... so it is a special cake to make each year for his birthday, Previously I have just added cocoa which was okay but not like THIS!! This makes an ordinary cake into a "designer cake" I do put the cake in the freezer for 20 minutes and then slice it in half so that there is more frosting covering the cake.

I made this for the first time. I pretty much followed the recipe and would do so again as I loved the results. I didn't measure out the whipping cream-- I just poured in a whole pint so not sure if thats 2 cups or not. I also added a drop of orange oil for a chocolate orange flavor. Anyways it was very thick, stayed nicely on my two layer frosted chocolate cake for several hours and it still looks nice on whats left over today. The taste was sooo good, everyone loved it. Nice light flavor, not too rich, very creamy.

I made only the frosting for a chocolate cake. It was yummy and easy. Everyone loved it. One family member is gluten intolerant and had only frosting using it as a dip for fresh fruit. I did add more vanilla than it said, only by accident. One comment from a family member was to add even more vanilla next time (which I will) and I think I would use a bit less cocoa and more sugar. I have also made something similar to a previous mentioned comment using chocolate or fudge syrup instead of the cocoa mixture and covering the cake with crushed english toffee, Heath bars, or Skor bars.

This was insanely good and wholly addictive! I doubt I'll ever make a buttercream frosting again. This was light and fluffy, and even though it's also full of fat, it doesn't leave a greasy mouthfeel. I used whole milk for the milk. I thought it was a bit sweet so next time I'll use 1-2 tbsp less of powdered sugar.

If I were to make this again, I would used sweetened cocoa powder, I think. It was not very sweet, and the chocolate flavor is delicate. I did use this on the wrong kind of cake (a yellow cake that tasted like buttermilk (gross)), and I'm sure it would have been much better on angel food. On the yellow cake, it was too light (ie not dense enough), not sweet enough, and its slight flavor was overpowered by the bold taste of the cake. However, I think it would make a great dip for strawberries.

Excellent and versatile whipped icing recipe. I added 1/2 tsp of instant coffee to the chocolate mixture for a mocha flavored icing.

I made this twice, the first time exactly according to recipe and the second with a granulated sugar/arrowroot powder substitution for the confectioners' sugar. It was delicious both times! I used pasteurized (as opposed to ultra-pasteurized) heavy cream because I prefer the flavor and texture. The frosting stayed cohesive and usable for hours in the fridge before I used it and has stayed mostly cohesive for three days on the cake with very little of the normal whipped cream separation. I think I may make it as a decadent mousse with perhaps some nocello, amaretto, or frangelico to add a hint of nut flavor.

Super easy and delicious! Oh so delicious. I used soft brown sugar and reduced amount to 3/4cup, so the result was just slightly bittersweet. Paired it with a 3-layered chocolate cake with amazing results. My new favorite chocolate frosting recipe!

This is my new chocolate icing recipe! I made the base the day before--it made it so easy to whip up the next morning! I used heavy cream instead of whipping cream. I made 1/2 batch and frosted my daughter's cupcakes with it--the amount was perfect for 18 cupcakes (with a little left over to sample!)

I made this frosting for a birthday cake for my boyfriend. He'd asked for a non-buttercream frosting, since he finds those too greasy. The cake was a dark chocolate-orange cake, so I added some Grand Marnier to the whipped cream. It was a big hit!

I made a half batch to frost a few cupcakes for my daughters birthday. I piled it high. It was a hit with everyone and so much easier to make than any other type of frosting.

I used this frosting recipe to coat a birthday cake. It is very light and fluffy and not heavy like a buttercream. It tasted great with some classic yellow cake! I'm sure it would go wonderfully with angel food cake too.

This is an amazing recipe! It is so simple and such a hit. I have made it countless times. I serve it with some raspberry puree on the side and it gets rave reviews every time. Perfect for summer.

I have made many, many frostings before, but this is one of the quickest, easiest, and most delicious I have found.

This is heaven! I made this icing for chocolate cupcakes and I now stand here dipping my finger in the bowl, savoring the leftovers. It's almost like chocolate mousse. I'm thinking of adding instant espresso, a touch of vanilla extract and using as a mousse type of dessert next time. I used heavy whipping cream and was a bit short on the powdered sugar by a 1/4 cup - more chocolatey than sweet - fantastic!

Made for mom's birthday, served with angel food cake and strawberries. Very rich and chocolatey... very good! Nice and firm consistency. Easy to make even with two screaming kids under foot.

Very nice. The chocolate whipped cream was heavenly with homemade chocolate cake. Later on, whilst eating leftover cream with a spoon in front of the tv, I was struck with idea that chocolate syrup might yield similar results. Eureka. Will post my findings.

This chocolate whipped cream is wonderful! Followed the recipe exactly, except made the chocolate part the day before and kept very tighly sealed in fridge until the time to serve the cake, then whipped in the heavy cream. All my guests loved it. Instead of spreading over the cake as icing, I put it on the side as whipped cream... I definitely plan on using this recipe for a variety of things, not just Angel Food Cake. I had some left over and put it in the fridge and the next day it was firmer, but in a good way -- made it much easier to handle. A nice treat for any time of year! Not too sweet and with a terrific chocolate flavor. I'm thinking of using this as a cookie filling, like with madelines.

FANNNTASTIC!!! A few alterations - double the amt of frosting. Take cake and w/ a bread knife cut off 1/2 inch of top - save. Hollow out insides of cake leaving 1/2 in on all sides. Fill w/ frosting. Replace top - frost all over. Top w/ toasted pecans. Yummy!

This frosting tasted very good. Not too sweet. I used heavy cream rather than whipping and made it and frosted the cake early in the day, then refrigerated it until we ate it later. I am not crazy about angel food cake but this frosting would taste good on any kind of cake.

This was a great cake but next time I would use a little less of the icing as I found it a bit heavy on the cake.

My mother has been making a similar cake for at least 25 years. How fun to see it here. She would slice the angel food cake into three layers, frost each layer with the whipped cream frosting, and then top each layer and the top with crushed Butterfingers. It is awesome!

I needed a lighter Holiday dessert and chose Angel Food cake this year. This frosting was a nice change from using the packaged varieties which always seem tooo sweet. It was a hit with the whole family.
