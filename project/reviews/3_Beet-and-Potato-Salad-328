This was quick and easy but just okay. As a previous reviewer said, I think this has too much vinegar and not the right kind. We added mustard to some of the leftovers and it was vastly improved. In the future, I would substitute dijon mustard for the vinegar (as mustard has a lot of vinegar in it and more deep flavour) and cut the oil in half.

Delicious. My only modification was to use white wine vinegar. This is my new favorite way to eat beets.

This recipe is great. I was skeptical, but it turned out fantastic. Flavors blend very nicely. I will definitly make this again.

I swore I would never mix beets with white absorbant foods ever again. It may tast good but the beet taste and color overwhelms all. Beets like to be by themselves.

We couldn't taste the beets and potatoes for all the vinegar! I will make it again but use less vinegar and will try a white wine vinegar instead of plain.

THIS IS THE BEST BEET RECIPE EVER! My husband hated beets until he tried this recipe. I make it very regularly especially in the summer months and he eats almost the whole thing! It is absolutely fabulous!!! Very balanced, very elegant!
