Delicious! And not that hard to make. I had a really hard time finding peppercorns in the supermarket. I had to ask multiple people who kept telling me they didn't carry them - turns out they were next to the capers. The peppercorns are an essential ingredient - I think capers would really change the taste of the meal, although they might be good too in their own way. I made a lot of extra sauce and now I am eating the leftover with pretzel crisps - yum.

Forgot to mention, I poached the salmon in reserved homemade shrimp broth.... amazing! Will probably try it with reserved lobster broth next time...

Loved it enough I'm making it again tomorrow for guests! And the leftovers were fabulous to add cold as flaked salmon on green salad... or salmon with the sauce over noodles... countless variations! And easy. I substituted the capers cause didn't have the green peppers on hand, used a French Dijon mustard, which is a little less grainy - still, would use this recipe as a base for many many others. And so beautiful to serve! Yum!

The sauce was amazing -- my husband raved about it! I've never poached fish before and I think I slightly overcooked it, but it was still very tasty (just a little tough). I used capers instead of green peppercorns and lemon juice instead of wine vinegar, just because that's what I had on hand. And I made the sauce by taste rather than by measure, because that's what I do. Served with baked potato and sauteed kale w/ caramelized onions. Fantastic meal!

What a fabulous recipe and delicious sauce! The sauce can be made well ahead of time, keeps in the fridge for a couple of days, and is equally delicious on hot or cold poached salmon.

Outstanding. Have made this four times and each time there are compliments from all the guests.

Loved the sauce! Made this for a bridal shower of 20 preparing the day before. (Stored the fish in the poaching sauce until plated). Both the poaching liquid and the sour cream sauce were phenomenal and I got tons of compliments. I used dried green peppercorns that I ground up in a spice grinder but am on the search for the peppercorns packed in liquid. This recipe is a keeper for me. I don't write reviews often, this recipe is worth the effort.

This is a cool way to poach a big piece of fish (I used my turkey roaster). I served chilled, and it was very good and impressive looking on a buffet. I wasn't that enthused with the sauce, could have been my substitutions (yogurt for sour cream, capers for green peppercorns), and likely will do a fruit salsa with orange and ginger next time.

We had forgotten how good poached salmon could be, when served with a great sauce like this. We've been grilling salmon exclusively for the longest time, and were very glad to find this recipe for poaching. The sauce is easy and delicious!

Very pleasantly surprised. Poached salmon is poached salmon. The surprise is the sauce. It was excellent. It livened the salmon and went well with our asparagus. The sauce is a keeper and can be used for may things.

I made the salmon as directed and made the sauce with capers instead of peppercorns. I served it with steamed broccoli, braised celery hearts, and homemade bread for a light meal. The dish was pleasant, but not overwhelming. I prefer a simple mayo "sauce" I make for salmon: mix some grated orange zest and minced fresh mint into mayonnaise to taste. Stir in fresh orange juice to thin it a bit. It is delicious with warm or cold salmon, hard-cooked eggs, and cold cooked asparagus. I often have this as a cold lunch or light supper.

The orange flavor was an amazing compliment to the salmon. Very easy to prepare, yet it looks like so much work.

I really like the flavours in this easy to prepare dish. The green peppercorns complement the ginger which complements the orange... it just blends so well together. I get lots of compliments whenever it's on the menu.

A very elegant meal without any fuss. I doubled the sauce recipe and there was nothing left.

I served the leftover salmon, at very cool room temperature, and the sauce the next night for dinner, and it was every bit as good as Night One. Cooking for two, I poached a one-pound fillet of salmon (adjusting the poaching liquid accordingly) and made half of the sauce recipe. All of the sauce was eaten, so I'd suggest for the full amount of 3 1/2 to 4 lbs. of salmon that the sauce recipe be at least doubled. This was delicious and easy to put together.

This is a very good dish to entertain with. It can be made in advance, served at room temperature. I don't use thier sauce but serve it with pesto-homemade of course. Also I cook up a risotto to go with it.

Once a month my office prepares dinner for 24 at a local womens homeless shelter. The ladies LOVED this dish and I got to take home a small sample. The combination of flavors in the sauce was great though perhaps a bit too rich.

When this recipe was originally published, the last part was a "what to do with the leftovers", which is frankly the reason to make all of the component parts in the first place. The addendum was as follows: 2 baked potatoes, skinned & grated 1 1/2 cups braised onion/celery (from above) 3 T mayonnaise 1 large egg 1 T white-wine Worchestershire sauce 1/2 t dried thyme 2 T capers 2 C poached salmon (from above) flaked flour for dredging 2 T each butter & olive oil Combine onions/celery & potatoes. Whisk together mayo, egg, Worchestershire sauce, thyme, capers, and salt & pepper to taste and add to onion/potato mixture. Add the salmon and stir until the salmon is distributed evenly. Form 1/3 cup of mixture into patties & dredge in flour. Fry in butter/oil 3 minutes on a side or until golden brown. Serve with lemon wedges if desired. Serves 6.

I'm an Epicourious regular! The reviews of this recipe sold me, I made it last night and again I wasn't dissapointed. Quick note, I substituted capers for green pepper corns. I think it was great.

I'm a convert to poached fish! I only came upon this recipe because I couldn't find another good recipe for grilled salmon. This recipe was so simple and the results were so delicious. I substituted buttermilk for sour cream in the sauce. I also saved the poaching liquid for future sauces. Incidentally, if you don't have wine (I used a semi-dry Riesling), I'm sure water would make a fine substitute.

Delicious and easy. Next time, I might use more ginger and replace the sour cream with yogurt. The potatoes are also good.

Delicious AND pretty! I served it with the "Sliced Baked Potatoes and Parsley Butter" (Gourmet 1992) and a simple salad for company and was very proud. Highly recommended.

I didn't believe something so quick and easy could be so delicious but it was! Suprisingly, this dish did not taste 'fishy' at all. My husband loves fish drenched in lemon but with this dish he didn't bother and ate the entire meal with just the salmon and the sauce. I started it at about 8:30 pm and we were eating by 9:15 after only 15 minutes of actual time in the kitchen. Easy and yummy, not too heavy, a must try!
