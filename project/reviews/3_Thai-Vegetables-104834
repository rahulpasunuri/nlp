I added bean sprouts to my recipe and I used the rugular mushrooms which were available. Loved it with the salmon and Thai rice I made.

Agree with others. This is better with another dish or rice.

As others suggested, you HAVE to make this with the Seared Salmon recipe and the dressing, rice, etc. It is a "package deal", and without all of the parts, it just doesn't wow. You also need to SERVE it correctly layering the "parts" per the recipe. It's also good to use a whole can of coconut milk instead of just the 2/3 c. and it does need the salt. My family and friends also like it when I "crisp up" the bottom of the rice a little until it's slightly golden, instead of fluffy. I've made this dish for all kinds of eaters and it continues to please. Great summer dish with a pretty presentation. I don't understand how people can rate this recipe when they don't use ANY of the same ingredients...don't bother if you don't know how it is "supposed" to taste.

easy and good. i adjusted the ingredients significantly, however. since i'm not a fan of ginger and didn't have green onions on hand, i added a large white onion and probably about a dozen cloves of garlic, chopped. i also included green bell pepper, and i used white button mushrooms instead of shitakes. and i added some broccoli. i was afraid it wouldn't have enough flavor with just the salt and pepper, but it's pretty good - and definitely healthy.

I didn't know what to do with my bok choy until I found this recipe which accompanies Seared Salmon with Thai Vegetables. Quick, delicious, and a treat for the eye too!

Decent recipe and a good side dish for the fish and coconut rice I made. It was easy to make, simple, and healthy. The flavor though was relatively unremarkable. I used maybe a cup and a half of frozen peppers in a bag, which was definitely tasty. Again, a nice healthy side dish that is colorful.

Healthful and delicious, these vegetables complement entrees with an Asian flair. I served them with five-spice pork, didn't serve a carb with the meal, and didn't miss it. The veggies are quite filling. They're quick to prepare and lend themselves to substitutions utilizing whatever produce is on hand.

Made this tonight as a side dish for grilled pork tenderloin. Despite the poor reviews we thought it was quite good. I doubled the garlic, tripled the ginger, and added about a tablespoon of oyster sauce. This may not be an authentic Thai dish, but it takes only a few minutes to prepare and would make a delicious side for many meats.

These vegetables are meant to go with the SEARED SALMON WITH THAI VEGETABLES recipe and together they are greater than the sum of their parts. I don't really think this could be a stand alone recipe but with the fish it's delicious.

I first tried this with the Seared Salmon with Thai Vegetables recipe. The salmon was excellent; the vegetables were only okay. But now when I make the seared salmon, I make a simple stir-fry of red & yellow bell pepper strips, julienned carrots and sugar snap peas. It then gets its flavor from the ginger-cilantro vinaigrette in the salmon recipe.

This recipe is part of a Seared Salmon with Thai Vegetables recipe... make that and the 2 forks will all change to 4 forks... see review below. Also, for everyday, we replace the bok choy with tiny whole green beans... easy and delicious!

I agree with the 'pretty dull' camp.

I agree with the suggestion that this veggie dish doesn't stand up alone - it doesn't. But pair it with the seared salmon recipe and it is great. The salmon has the spice this dish lacks. If I were looking for a thai veggie recipe on its own, this would not be it. I marked that I'd make it again, because I intend to pair it with the seared salmon. Excellent combination.

the cook from brooklyn had it right. add soy sauce with corn starch, double the garlic and ginger, add red pepper flakes. otherwise, this is horribly bland...even after the improvements, however, it is not really thai, just oriental.

These veggies go well with the salmon with the following changes: Double the garlic and ginger, add some hot pepper flakes, chopped cilantro & dissolve a tsp of corn starch in 1/4 cup soy/shoyu or tamari & add at end. AND WHY on god's green earth, would one discard the white part of the bok choy? separate it from greens, chop and add to pan when you put in the peppers. especially since i used 2 bunches of choy and the greens still shrank down to nothing.

It definitely isn't Thai but I thought it was delicious. Served it with a soy marinated steak and coconut rice. Nice change from the usual bland vegetables.

I had this at a friend's for dinner as part of the Salmon with Thai Vegetables recipe and it was EXCELLENT!! To all the negative reviewers - maybe the vegetable dish doesn't stand up well alone?

This was bland and boring. It is lacking all of the flavorful characteristics of most Thai recipes!

To Pat, the cook from Bermuda, the thai vegetables (listed in a link) are as follows: 1 tablespoon oriental sesame oil 2 teaspoons minced peeled fresh ginger 1 large garlic clove, minced 1 red bell pepper, cut lengthwise into thin strips 6 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stemmed, thinly sliced 3 large green onions, thinly sliced on sharp diagonal 3 cups thinly sliced bok choy (from 1 bunch; green leaf tops only) Heat oil in heavy large skillet over high heat. Add ginger and garlic; sauté 20 seconds. Add bell pepper and mushrooms; sauté until pepper is crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Add green onions and bok choy and sauté until just wilted, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Makes 4 servings. Enjoy, and let us know how your turned out. :-)

To make this stir fry dish more "Thai" I would add Thai eggplant, Thai basil, kaffir lime leaves and fish sauce. These are the flavors that give that distinctive "Thai" aroma and taste.

Authenticity issue aside, this is a wonderful, healthy vegetable dish. I served it with jasmine rice and sauteed tofu and my meat-loving husband really enjoyed it. I did use button mushrooms instead of shiitake, which were way too expensive. Not bland-tasting, as I had anticipated.

Uh, this is just a typical mediocre americanized chinese stir fry recipe... what is "thai" about this?

Rating: 4
I used 1/2 ingredients and it worked just fine. The second time I added 6ozs baked salmon (flaked) and it was super.Oh yes I did'nt have any Bok Choy the second time so I used Chinese Leaves (Napa Cabbage) and it was just as good

Lately I saw lots of claimed "Thai Cookbook"s in many bookstores. I 'drather like to call them "Thai Inspired Cookbook" because they present food Thai never see and never know e.g. the one by a guy called "Ken Hom". There's nothing wrong with appreciation of other culture's food but if you're really not sure where are they from, better call them "Thai Inspired so and so food" would be more appropriate.

This is a superbly elegant dish that is easy to make. I made it exactly according to the recipe this time, and it was very very good, however, to make it more authentic next time I will probably add some more Thai flavors, such as fish sauce, cilantro, chillies, maybe a little chicken broth. Very good accompaniment to a fish or seafood main course.

This is not a bad recipe as far as vegetables go,however you should not call it 'Thai' vegetables,because it's not thai. Thai food has kick with chillies.fish sauce,cilantro,possibly crisp fried onions. Even cooked or fried vegetable have a light taste. I am german an I worked a lot in the north and east of Thailand and I have never come across such a recipe. I can't say I didn't like it, I made it for mexican friends who had never eaten thai food- to ease them into it-so to speak. But I didn't even serve it. Later I made fried rice from it , using lots of additional things and it turned out ok. Angelika Mexico City doblerang@prodigy.net.mx

We are Thai and never have such a bland dish. T improve flavor add a splash of maggi sauce, some fish sauce, oyster sauce, and a tablespoon of chicken broth. Serve with vinegar & chilies. Still, the veggi combination is off. I haven't ever had an excellent asian dish from a recipe on this site.

Easy and delicious. Goes very well with the salmon. YUM!
