Not being a huge fan of cauliflower, we were a little dubious of this one. The deep frying actually really brought out the taste, with less of the yucky texture you sometime get. As others have said, it doesn't quite crisp us as you would expect. The cauliflower compliments the fish well - an unexpected success!

The star in this recipe is the cauliflower. I'd like it if the "confetti" crisped up a bit more...I think next time I'll bake it after. I can't wait to try this with a cauliflower mash instead of the fish. Also, it was delicious with walnut oil instead of vegetable and olive oil.

I will be making this again, it was very delicious and elegant. However, there should be a simpler method to "shaving" a cauliflower. It is incredibly messy, I even had cauliflower in my hair!

I must have done something wrong because it was not so great, and I read the great reviews this had. Terribly dissapointed

Yum! Will make again, everyone loved it and the kids don't usually like fish. Nice.

Made this last night. The nuttiness of the cauliflower really enhances the sea bass. Looks beautiful, and tastes even better.

My cauliflower didn't have much of a stem for shavings, but I did the best I could. It was a delicious meal anyway - so flavorful and simple!

We loved this one , with lemon butter on it. This is a very good and light meal.

This dish was easy, light, flavorful, and very elegant. You definitely need a slicer for the raw shavings because they need to be very thin.
