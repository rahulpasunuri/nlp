A beautiful presentation, tasty and so easy to make! Per one review, I mixed 1 cup marscapone and 1 cup heavy whipping cream, added sugar to taste (depending on how sweet the fruits are) and added 1-2 tbsp Amaretto to fruit puree to boost flavor. The 2nd time I made it, I substituted berries with 2 mangos by pureeing 1 mango and cutting the 2nd mango into small pieces for texture. I did 3 layers, mango pieces, cream, puree, and cream again. I repeated this one time, then finished with a garnish of mango pieces.

The sauce was very good, use in other desserts but forget the rest, not vey good at all.

This recipe is a great dessert to make in a hurry -and it looks impressive. It is too rich to use straight marscapone - I substituted 1/2 the marscapone for whipped heavy cream..mixed the two together and it was REALLY GOOD!! Put a raspberry on top to make it look really gourmet.

This is a very rich dessert. It would be better if the Mascarpone cheese was whipped first. The berry puree is very good and I will use it in other desserts.
