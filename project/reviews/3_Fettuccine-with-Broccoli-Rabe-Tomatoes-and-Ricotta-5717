I found the broccoli rabe's bitterness too over powering for the rest of the ingredients. It was a complete waste to add spinach fettuccine since it could not really be tasted, which was true for the ricotta as well. With all of these warnings, if you decide to give this recipe a shot anyway I would subsitute the brocolli rabe for spinach and double the amount of tomatoes. Not a keeper for me.

This dish was quite tasty with some modifications. I substituted spinach for the broccoli rabe. I sauteed 5 cloves of garlic in olive and truffle oil, added spinach, sardine paste, chopped fresh basil. After I added the pasta I mixed in a bit of feta and Pecorino cheese with a few pinches of red pepper flakes.

It might not be fair of me to rate this recipe because I did not add the anchovy but it was very blah. I used feta and regular broccoli. Too many other good pastas out there. I would not do this again.

Simple, quick and tasty. I added some red pepper flakes for a little zip.

I did some modifications, mostly to add more protein for my vegitarian diet. I fried some smoked tempeh (Fakin' Bacon) and then added that to a small frying pan in which I had sauteed sundried tomatoes(instead of fresh) with olive oil and 2 sliced garlic cloves. Also I put the whole stems of the raab in the pasta water, then spooned out and chopped. I added some unsalted dry roasted soybeans at the end of the raab sautee and also subsituted sharp goat's milk cheddar for the cheese. I think the extra tang in the goat's milk was a great companion to the raab's bite.

I made some substitutions, like leaving out the anchovies because I am vegetarian, but really liked the recipe. I may try it with kale or spinach next time as I thought the broccoli rabe was a little too bitter for me, otherwise it's in my recipe book for good.

My husband is like Mikey, he won't eat anything! I made him try this and he actually said it was good, and would eat it again.

I usually use Farfalle pasta or Bow Tie pasta with this dish, as it is easier to manage and less messy especially for guests. Also, when broccoli rabe isn't available, an acceptable substitute is kale. I often serve this as an accompniment to sauteed Chicken breasts, it is easy to make and can be made ahead of time. It really is a winner!
