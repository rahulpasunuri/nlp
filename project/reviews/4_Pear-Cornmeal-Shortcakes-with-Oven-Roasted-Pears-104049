This recipe is wonderful. I have used this many times as a consistant staple dessert. I have also substituted peaches (minus the preserves) and it works just as well.

My husband and I made this recipe to take to a recent Gourmet Club dinner. Since the theme was Halloween, we made the biscuits with a pumpkin-shaped cookie cutter. Although we had had a very full meal, everyone gobbled up this dessert because it was so light. My six-year-old son loved the biscuits just to snack on.
