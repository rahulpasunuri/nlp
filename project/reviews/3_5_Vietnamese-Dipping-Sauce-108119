This is a wonderful recipe! I have one similar to it! I would definitely suggest using a lighter colored fish sauce for awesome visual appeal.

This sauce tastes just like the sauce you get in a vietnamese restaurant! I used it in a pork BUN recipe I created consisting of rice vermicelli, chopped red leaf lettuce, basil/garlic marinated pork, mint, sprouts, red pepper (sliced thin), and extra basil (sliced thin). The sauce made the dish!!
