Have made this several times now. Tonight used frozen corn (because it's only spring) and added a 1/4 block of cream cheese and a cup or so of flaked jumbo crab meat. Whipped the cream cheese up with the yolks, then folded in the crab and corn. Girls over for girls night dinner loved it!

Way too much corn in the garden this year so this recipe will come in handy! The recipe is fine as is, but next time I'll try it with cheese - maybe an aged swiss.

Steam the corn. I find this to be the best method and you don't have to waste all that water. Use a tall pot with a rack on the bottom or use a pasta pot insert. Add about 2 inches of water depending. Steam for 15 - 20 mins on high heat. When you start to smell the corn, it's done! We eat this at breakfast using leftover corn on the cob from the night before.

Actually, Vancouver, microwaving food is often a better alternative, as studies have shown that microwaves actually cause foods (particularly meats) to release LESS carcinogenic chemical compounds than in other methods of cooking(yes, there are cancer-causing chemicals in natural foods). The shorter cooking time in microwaves also preserves MORE of the nutrient value of certain foods (particularly water-soluble vitamins...the high heat of the oven would cause more evaporation). The 'nuking' doesn't harm your system because the microwave radiation that heats your foods is completely destroyed by the time you open the microwave door...it's gone in a fraction of a second. Needless to say, you don't eat radiation.

Made it with 8 eggs, increased baking time and served cut in wedges at a brunch for 5. I drizzled the cut omelet with melted butter flavored with smoky paprika. Everybody looked for second helpings.

To the cook from Kentucky: anybody with sense would boil the corn rather than wrap it in plastic and zap it in the microwave. Not only does the plastic leach toxic chemicals into your food when heated, but the microwaves themselves alter the molecular structure of food to the point that they no longer have any nutritional value. So, while it may be convenient, think about your health first before you nuke the food that goes into your body.

Very good and a nice side dish that is easy to prepare. Also good as a main course for a simple meal. I much prefer to wrap fresh corn in plastic wrap and cook on high in the microwave for 2-3 minutes (cook one ear of corn at a time), rather than boiling. The corn tastes fresher and crisper and one does not lose the nutitional value in the pot of water. Also, who wants a big pot of boiling water in a hot kitchen in the summer!

This is a great recipe and the suggested method of cooking the corn (10 minutes standing after adding to the boiling water) has become my standard. But it would be 4 forks if you add goat cheese to the mix.

Wonderful recipe!
