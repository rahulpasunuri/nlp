This is an excellent recipe, both taste and presentation, but there is no way this cooks in 40 minutes on indirect medium heat, unless you get your heat up to 450 or more. I actually had to cut off the quarters and flip breast to finish it all on direct heat, though I did start with a 5 pound bird I used Frank's hot sauce, and pecan wood for smoke.

My family loves this chicken! We serve this with a cucumber yogurt sauce and it is always a favorite. I also make the chicken ahead and freeze it in the marinade until I can pull it out to defrost. Very easy!

Excellent! Used 1/2 of hot sauce.

Amazing! I had doubts going in, the Piri Piri sauce I was able to find at a local Portuguese grocery store was heavy in vinegar and I was concerned about the chicken being to sour/acidic. But the it few through, tender, the sauce killed any off flavors. We served this with a side salad and rice.

OMG, I wrote an earlier review this morning. I prepared the whole chicken and grilled half last night and let the other half marinate another day. When went to light the gas bbq tonight I realized I had not turned off all the burners from last night and ended up with an empty propane tank! So tonight I ended up roasting the chicken in the oven with veggies at 425 degrees and basted it a few times. Honestly I'm not sure which way I liked it better! Roasting it gave you all the beautiful juices to pour over rice! Needless to say it's great flamed over a grill or oven roasted. I can't wait to see how the leftovers are cold!

I pulled a whole chicken over the weekend and decided to brine the chicken disolving 1 tbs each of sugar, salt and pickling spice and enough water to cover the chicken. I hadn't decided how I was going to grill it yet. I found this recipe and I had everything on hand but the Piri Piri sauce, I ended up substituting Sambal for the sauce. To keep things easy I pureed ALL the ingredients together except for the butter. I reserved 1/2 cup of the marinade for basting the chicken and that was when I added the 3 tbs of melted butter. The indirect heat was the key to a nice moist chicken! I am cooking the other half tonight!

Excellent recipe. Couldn't find the Piri Piri sauce so I used Emerils recipe. I used the suggestion of one of his reviewers and included a red bell pepper. It gave the sauce a very slightly sweet undertone that was quite nice. One thing I didn't notice when I started preparing the dish was that you should wait 7 days for the sauce to age and the flavors to meld. I'm not a patient man so that was hard, lol. Finally the time came when I could make the chicken breasts. Careful here, it takes less time than the whole chicken so be careful. In the glaze the 2 Tbsp of lemon juice is too much. I added another Tbsp each of butter and the sauce and it was fine. Next time I'll use only 1 to 1.5 tbsp of the lemon juice. I grilled it on my gas grill and smoked it with hickory chips....mmmm good. Very unique flavor. From now on I'm going to have a tough time deciding which I'm going to make, my own BBQ chicken with my own BBQ sauce which is also awesome or this. Next time I'll try fire roasting the peppers when I make the sauce.

piri piri = yummy yummy we used Mazi piri piri (http://www.mazi401.com/piri-piri.html) and it was fabulous. Will try again with the homemade piri piri mentioned below. We used boneless chicken thighs and marinated overnight. Everything else as per recipe. The glaze looked like a broken sauce but used it anyway and it was fantastic.

Absolutely AWESOME recipe!!!! The one thing I wanted to comment on was the difficulty in finding the Piri Piri sauce. Emeril has an excellent recipe for this sauce of foodtv.com. The modifications I made to his sauce was to add one sweet red pepper and more garlic. Either his way or mine, both are great.

I have been planning on making this for weeks and finally grabbed a sale on some drumsticks, instead of the whole chicken. The marinade was amazing. I did make the glaze the recipe calls for, but in the end, I didn't use it. It just seemed to be a bit much. The marinade seasoned the chicken perfectly and I accidentally ate my leftovers already! I used the Nando's Garlic Medium Sauce in my sauce.

I made this today and it turned out delicious. I made with piri-piri sauce I bought in Portugal. So savory! I'm glad I have more bottles to make this again. Also, I'm happy to have read about Nando's sauce being available when I run out of mine. I marinated a 4lb whole chicken overnight and roasted it in a 350 oven for 75 minutes. Perfectly roasted and juicy.

This is easy to make and soooooooooooo tasty. I had to substitute some lime instead of lemon for the glaze. Made in advance for ease. Awesome all around tastes!!! Everybody loved it!!! I cooked three chickens for a delayed graduation party. Everyone said they loved it! Some said it was the "best" BBQ/Grill they ever had! Will not be disappointed. I plan on making again for a dinner club with an Iberian theme.

Has anyone tried this with flank steak? I'm thinking it would be great! Please let me know what you think!

Loved this dish....chicken was so tender and delicious. The marinade and glaze was so flavorful... I will definitely make again. Did not have piri-piri sauce. Used Paul Pruhomme's Magic Sauce & Marinade. Also, used chicken breast instead of whole chicken. Marinating overnight is key.

Given the difficulty everyone had in aquiring the piri piri sauce I find it interesting that the authors were so casual about it as an ingredient. I used Frank's with great sucess. I took the extra step of spooning the marinade under the skin of the bird for even more flavor penetration. It was delicious, and a big success with my guests.

We just finished this and are in a state of bliss. This was so good. I followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing! I used the peri peri sauce from Nando's. You can order their peri peri sauce online at www.nandosperiperi.com. The medium sauce is a good one to start with. It has a very reasonable heat level. We used bone-in, skin-on thighs and marinated for 8 hours. Perfection. I imagine it would be delicious beyond words if it had marinated for 24 hours. The glaze is a good touch. We served it on the side so you could use it as desired. So good. Try this!! Oh...almost forgot, served it with grilled garlic naan bread and the epicurious Creamy Cilantro-Lime Slaw.

There is no lack of flavour with this recipe, the glaze sauce really is a great finishing touch. I would only caution that you be careful about the piri piri sauce you use. I couldn't find it very easily and when I did the one I bought (unknowingly) was rated a 9/10 for hot. That was too much for for us, it almost made the dish unedible. Using a medium heat piri piri would have made this dish about perfect!

I should add that because of kosher restrictions I actually did the glaze with olive oil rather than butter, don't know how much difference it made but it was still delicious!

Wow! Delicious! I did this with boneless chicken breasts marinated over-night. The chicken was great but the glaze absolutely made the dish spectacular, so don't skip it! My husband was using the glaze on everything, and I think it will definitely be a staple in our house. Yum!

This was absolutely delicious! I had to grill for about 15 minutes longer than the recipe indicated, and the chicken was perfectly cooked, juicy and tender. I bought Piri-Piri sauce at Cost Plus (very inexpensive) and used a bit more garlic than called for. Everyone in the family loved it!

This is a great summer recipe. I used chicken breasts and a mix of Pic a Pepper and Chalupa hot sauce.....The longer you marinate it the better it gets. Family wants it again tomorrow.

I made Marcus Samuelsson's Piri-Piri from his Soul of a New Cuisine cookbook. Simply combine the following in a blender: 8 red birds eye chilies, seeds and stems removed 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice 1 tbs cilantro 1 tbs chopped parsley 2 garlic cloves 1/2 cup olive oil We really liked the recipe and will definitely make it again!

Can't wait to make this one! If you are looking for Piri-Piri sauce, you can order it online at www.nandosperiperi.com. My Father-in- law said it was just like the sauce he fell in love with in Africa, and my husband & I go to their restaurant in DC a lot.

Couldn't find piri piri sauce anywhere-so used Trappey's Red Pepper Sauce (it's fairly mild but with a little kick). Used boneless skinless breasts and added some fresh mint to the marinade. Dee-lish! Will definitely make again--soon!

I used red pepper sauce instead of the piri piri, and cooked over hickory chips. This was wonderful, a definite do-again. It may be easier to manuipulate the chicken in the marinade and on the grill if cut into quarters instead of halves
