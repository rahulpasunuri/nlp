So beautiful, so yummy! I skipped the red onion and added some garlic and a touch of dijon mustard to the dressing. Served with toasted walnuts, feta, and homemade croutons in order to make it a entree salad (it serves 3-4 as an entree). A fantastic use for the massive mounds of beans that some end up with at the end of Aug/start of Sept!

The description is perfect...colorful, refreshing and delicious. It made a beautiful dish especially since we used cherry tomatoes of different colors (yellow, red, orange). We crisp cooked the greens beans and we didn't have wax beens. All in all a definate keeper

Very good. Took to a family gathering and it received many compliments. I added feta as recommended elsewhere. Black olives would seem to follow in this sequence but I did not use them this time. Maybe next.

I've been making this since it appeared in the magazine. The first few times were a little bland, and I'd have to agree with the "something missing" comments. More recently, I've begun to add chunks of good feta, and toasted pine nuts, which contribute a great, much needed crunch. Bingo! Now the salad's perfect.

Love this one. Always asked for the recipe when I take it to gatherings. Don't substitute the basil as it makes this salad.

The flavor will come from the quality of the ingredients. I got the was beans from my garden and used purple basel, since I have that in the garden, too. Unfortunately, my tomatoes aren't ripe yet. If you have yummy tomatoes that will make a huge difference. For this I used some coarse salt from Provence. It adds a light crunchiness and kicks the flavor a little bit. I also used shallots, since I didn't have any red onions in the pantry. I great accompaniment is "Alsterwasser". This may sound terrible to most Americans, but it is very popular in Germany. It is a drink mix of beer and lemonade.

Yummy! I love green beans and never can think of a good way to cook them. This was great: easy and tasty. I used a bag TJ's already cleaned and washed mixed green & wax beans, and I left out the tomatoes. I thought the red onion and the fresh basil where an excellent combination. It looked beautiful with the colors and tasted great. Had it with a steak, and it was an excellent low carb meal.

I omitted the onion and only used green beans. As other reviews had said it was missing something, I added chopped salted and roasted almonds and goat cheese. It was really delicious. The almonds added some body to the salad and the goat cheese added just the right amount of zing.

It was amazing when I added feta cheese and a little Dijon mustard to the dressing. I didn't have any waxed beans, but other then color, I don't think it made a difference.

Yawn. Uninteresting, even after I added a chopped avocado. Not bad, just quite ordinary.

This is good-nice and light. I think adding some cotija or feta and few dashes of hot sauce really makes it taste great. I'll be having it for dinner again tomorrow.

I really like the way this turned out. I didn't have a red onion so I used scallions, all ingredients from the farmers market, and it was delicious!

I've made this a few times when the beans are bountiful at the farmer's market. I agree with other cooks that it's "missing something". Easy to put together for a quick weeknight salad, but certainly nothing special. Instead try "green bean and grape tomato salad with kalamata olive vinaigrette" from this site. Now that one's a keeper!

A good dish to use a bounty of garden tomatoes and beans, but it seemed to be missing...something.

Rating: 2
More of a 2 1/2 really. I enjoyed it, but wasn't overly wowed. While it's good, and looks great, I didn't really find that it brought any particularly new flavours to the table. I also used balsamic (as well as regular tomatoes cubed - both out of necessity) but will try to follow the recipe more closely next time.

Rating: 3
I thought this was a great recipe to start out with - but its hard for me to follow any recipe to the letter. I added a can of garbanzo beans and some fresh parsley, increased the vineger by 1-2T and reduced the oil to about 2T, and left out the sugar. I also added salt and pepper. I noticed other reviewers used balsamic - i want to try it but didnt have it so I used a cabernet vinegar, and it turned out great. I will definitely make it again - maybe for a summer picnic or bbq since it is so easy.

I didn't use the yellow beans just the green. I thought overall the recipe turned out great. It not only looked good but tasted good too. The trick is to not over or undercook the beans.

Great salad; it went very nicely with wild spring salmon and oven-baked polenta rounds! I essentially followed the recipe, but replaced the wax beans with julienned yellow peppers for their more vibrant hue and sweet crunch. I also used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine, as suggested by other posters. Everybody enjoyed this, and my extremely picky nine-year-old actually asked for a third helping!

Thought this went well with marinated grilled chicken I made. I used balsamic as prev mentioned. Skipped the onions since many of my friends do not eat them - I love onions tho. Cut back on the oil then added some pitted kalamata olives to add another dimension of colour and taste. A keeper.

This salad has become one of my favorites. I used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar. The quality of the olive oil can really make or break this dish.

I love this recipe -- I think the key is using fresh, locally grown, tomoatoes. I typically cna't find the yellow beans and just use green beans.

Excellent summer salad choice. Used balsamic vinegar. Fresh basil is a must.

This was a great recipe, however, it's near impossible to get fresh yellow wax beans! I actually substituted some frozen beans here (a bit softer than the green beans, but made no difference taste-wise once salad sat in marinade a while). Also used grape tomatoes in place of cherry tomatoes (I prefer the flavor and texture of grape v. cherry). My guests loved it and -- even better -- I had enough left over for lunch today!

Okay, so I totally remade this, but everyone demanded more and copies of the recipie. I hate cherry tomatoes, so I roasted some regular ones instead. I softened the red onion by steeping in boiling water for a half hour. And I used balsamic vinegar. It was amazing!

This salad was popular with young and old alike. It looked beautiful and tasted wonderful. I used red wine vinegar as called for in the recipe, but tasted the dressing and adjusted for personal taste before tossing. I added a little more basil than called for because we all love it, but otherwise would not change a thing. We already made this several times!

Very easy and tasty summer salad. Great for a gathering! Received great reviews from the crowd!

I've made this for company a few times and I think I like the presentation more than the actually taste of the salad. However, I still think it's worth three forks - it's easy to prepare and it's a wonderful summer salad to accompany a barbecued main course. I'll keep making it but next time I'll use balsamic vinegar as suggested by others.

I made this dish for a dinner party and it was extremely well received - everyone wanted the recipe. I also substituted the red wine vinegar for balsamic vinegar and used a yellow bell pepper (lightly steamed) as I couldn't get any yellow beans.

I changed the recipe quite a bit but I was so happy with the results that I will include my changes. I used blanched green beans and on-the-vine cherry tomatoes cut in half. I tossed them together and added fresh mozzarella cut into large cubes and chopped fresh basil. For the dressing I combined Balsamic vinegar, olive oil and diced darlic and tossed it all together. I topped it with coarsely ground sea salt and pepper. It produced a fresh, flavorful, bright, simple and beautiful salad perfect for a summer evening. I made a large batch and have been eating it for 3 days now and I can't wait to make more. The crunch of the beans and tang of the tomatoes and fresh mozzarella and basil combined perfectly. It left me wanting to add toasted pine nuts which I will add next time.

I made this dish for a dinner party I was invited to. It was so fresh and colorful....it went quickly and everyone loved it! I used balsamic, but think red wine vinegar would be fine too...you just need more than called for...Used yellow bell pepper instead of yellow beans which I liked a lot. .Also, I put the basil in at the very end just in case it would turn brown and ugly as some others said it would. I will make this dish often.

Very bland. I should have taken the advise of a previous reviewer and used blasamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar and it definitely need to marinate longer than 1 hour. It has potential and is a nice colorful presentation but I doubt if I'll try it again.

Prepared this for a catered brunch along with the asparagus frittata recipe found at this site. I used balsamic vinegar in place of red wine. Also, wasn't able to find wax beans so used just lovely summer green beans and a little thin julienne of yellow pepper just for color. Marinated the beans and onion for a couple of hours and added the basil and tomatoes last 45 minutes or so. It looked beautiful on the buffet and guests raved. Also, the serving size seemed rather too generous - at least for this group.

I made this dish based upon the raves reviews and I was dissapointed. The colors were wonderful, but I thought it was bland. I will make this again, but next time I will use balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar that the recipe calls for. It will add the zip that this salad definately lacks.

The first three words of this recipe say it all, colourful, refreshing and delicious. This recipe is just fabulous, I steamed the beans for about 2 minutes, which left them really crisp The dressing is something else. I will be making this one again and again. .

I have always by-passed the bean salads before, ugh, or so I thought. I decided to try this one, and it was just incredible. Loved the flavors, and it is so colorful, a wonderful presentation. I had left overs, and couldn't wait until the next day to finish it off. Guess what? I had it for breakfast. Just couldn't wait until lunch time. It was still excellent. One of the best salads I have ever had. ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!

I doubled the recipe for a larger cook-out successfully. My only "alternation" was that I used "grape" tomatoes vs. the "traditional" cherry tomatoes--more flavorful. I will make this again...

I guess I'm the only one (plus all the people I had for dinner), but I didn't think too much of this dish. It wasn't bad tasting, just rather bland and looked better than it tasted. Of course fresh veggies are always good, but I expected more out of the marinade. I did only have an hour to marinate it, so that may have made a difference. Probably wouldn't use this dressing again without making some major alterations.

I served this to my in-laws, who were very impressed with how such simple ingredients could yield such a great salad. I only marinated the beans in the dressing for an hour, and I don't think they really picked up much of its flavor, so I recommend a generous amount of time to soak the veggies. I used those grape tomatoes that I seem to be seeing everywhere these days in lieu of the cherry tomatoes, and probably would stick to the original recipe next time. The grape tomatoes were more expensive and in my opinion don't need a dressing on them. They're good and sweet to eat on their own, and the cherry tomatoes would have gotten the job done. I also may add another tablespoonful of basil next time. This really was a super side dish to our barbecued chicken and the Sweet Corn and Basmati Rice Salad, which is also terrific. Between those two dishes, my mother in law left with my June copy of the magazine! I guess that's what websites are for!

This was a super side dish and solution to the home gardener. It was crisp and just tart enough to accompany almost any meal. I used smaller globe basil which endures better in salads. It held up very well the next day when I had the leftovers for lunch. I would gladly serve this to dinner guests.

Very nice salad. I agree with the other reviewer that it is important not to make this too far ahead- the basil turns an ugly color and loses its fresh taste. But eaten soon after it's made this is a wonderful summer side dish.

Oh God I love this recipe!!! I too have made it three times in the last 2 weeks! I made a little variation though, I pan roast pine nuts in a skillet then add a spoon full of garlic, sauté for a minute or two, then add the cooked beans to the mixture. Add the warm mixture to the bowl with the olive oil and vinegar, and toss it all together with the onions and basil. The flavors are so wonderful together, and it looks as beautiful as it tastes. I have even served it right away, and it is delicious. I am sure I will go for a 4th time this weekend!

I've made this recipe three times in the last month. It is excellent--fresh, light, easy to prepare and pretty too! At first I thought that the marinade of olive oil, red wine vinegar and sugar would not be flavorful enough but coupled with the fresh basil it really is delicious. Be sure to follow the directions and serve 1-3 hours after assembling it. Although tasty the next day as a leftover, the beans discolor and the basil wilts.
