I've made this recipe several times, sometimes substituting chicken or turkey thighs. This time, I substituted a Boston butt pork roast and just increased the braising time. I am much more pleased with the results using the Boston butt pork roast than the veal shanks. And, it is a much more economical cut of meat.

Very good exactly as written. Chicken thighs or turkey thighs are an acceptable substitute for the veal shank.

I couldn't find veal shanks at the market, and so I made this with lamb. I was afraid that the flavors would be too delicate for the lamb, but it worked out wonderfully. I especially liked the lemon zest, and the green olives mellow nicely under the long cooking time. I agree that the sauce doesn't need to be strained (chunks of onion and caper, yum!), but I did chill it overnight and scrape the excess fat from the sauce before reheating. Served it over a farafalle pasta.

Sorry to say, I didn't like this at ALL. I used lamb shanks instead of veal and maybe that was the problem.

What ever you do, don't try and cook it too quickly. It was good - I added 3 times the amount of lemon to give it a tang. Yum!

I have served this for dinner parties and get rave reviews every time. The large caper berries with stems really dress it up so don't skip them if you have access to them. Serve with a wonderful red wine and you're dinner party is guaranteed to be a success.

I use the recipe ingredients but prepare the veal shanks in my pressure cooker. They cook in 18 minutes and are extremely tender.

This is my favourite way to cook osso buco - the flavours jump off the plate!! I really love the fact that it can be cooked ahead - makes it ideal for entertaining. I generally pair it with saffron rice, and serve a robust red wine. My guests go home happy and sated.

This is a great dish for entertaining...easy-to-follow recipe; can be cooked ahead of time; wonderfully aromatic and different. I especially like the broth/sauce which is plentiful and which goes very well with couscous, gnocchi or crusty bread...I find there is no need to strain the sauce.
