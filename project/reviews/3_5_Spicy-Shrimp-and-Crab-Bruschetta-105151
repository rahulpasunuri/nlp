What a great recipe to have on hand! Taking the advice of wise reviewers below, I made it the night before to give the flavors time to blend, and sauteed the shrimp in butter, the leftovers of which I used to brush the toasts. Wonderful! The fresh seafood is expensive, but it was the perfect treat for a holiday meal!

I followed the suggestions of earlier reviews and agree with using less mayo and saute in butter and garlic but I didn't like the celery seed flavor added by the old bay. Will stick with original spices next time. My onions were a little overpowering, will only use green parts next time. Potential to be great though!

This recipe was a big hit for Thanksgiving as an appetizer this year. I've never made it before but I followed the suggestions in the reviews and it came out greaat(I doubled the recipe for the amount of people). I omitted onions because I am allergic but it was still spicy. Also, I didn't find real crab, just imitation crab, and I was low on time and couldn't go hunt for fresh crab, so I just put in a few pieces of the imitation (yuck), but it was mostly shrimp bruschetta. What I did was boil 1 lb of shrimp with a thick slice of lemon in each batch of shrimp, and then cut off the tails. Then sauteed in margarine and Old Bay for a few minutes. Then I chopped it up and mixed it with 1/3 cup of miracle whip, lemon juice, worchestire sauce, dry mustard powder, more old bay, salt, and pepper, and the few slices of imitation crab that I chopped up. Then I chopped up some fresh basil and mixed that in and added more lemon juice. Then I let it sit overnight. I got raves for it except that people told me I should have chopped my shrimp up more because it was falling off the bread slices...it was more cubed than chopped, but that's because I am an inexperienced cook. Anyway, it was easy and great, my boyfriend said it was better than the crab sandwiches he has at his favorite seafood restaurant.

I have made this for several years to rave reviews from my guests. Recommend reducing mayo quantity by not quite half and I have used lo-fat mayo with no adverse effect. I allow the flavors to meld for a few hours to overnight. I will add chopped basil next time to give a fresh herb flavor. Easy to prepare and trasport. Can serve in bowl with the crostini alongside for a serve-yourself appetizer.

I followed this recipe closely, only adding some garlic. I thought it was lackluster, and evidently so the the people at the party I attended. It was a very expensive mistake.

Very easy to make and everyone loved it! I used canned crab and slightly less mayo than was called for.

I skipped the clam juice and did an olive oil garlic (4 cloves chopped) butter mix for cooking the shrimp as suggested by an earlier reviewer. I used the leftover butter garlic mix to brush the bread. Also, I used old bay seasoning, dry mustard and a dab of worschestershire sauce as also suggested - and only 1/8 t. cayenne, it was still zippy. I used good crab meat and shrimp. And I made the topping a day ahead to let flavors meld.

Due to an unavailability of fresh crab, I used tinned, and was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked. Definitely a crowd pleaser -- I'll be making this again!

I brought this to a dinner party and it was a big hit. Use fresh crab meat if you can. I used Old Bay (in addition to the spices in the recipe) and let it sit overnight per recommendations of other reviewers. Easy make-ahead dish.

I also would cut down on the mayo and I would also use "Old Bay" seasoning instead of paprika and cayenne. Let this meld in the fridge for at least 12 hrs. or possibly overnight. If you have used real crab,the flavor will come through. I'll definitely make this for many parties to come.Thanks AHA

Every last bite was goobled up! Took the advice to cut the mayo in half which was perfect as well as sauteing the shrimp in a wee bit of butter. Doubled the cayene, added some dry mustard and worcestshire sauce. Brought some definite zip to it and was a big hit......we'll be making this one again....easy and yummy

This was a great dish. I did cut the mayo by half and used plain yogert (not low fat) for the other half. I do believe that you can't have too much garlic so of course I added more.

This was tasty but nothing out of the ordinary. I made it as the recipe specified and the only change I'd make is to reduce the mayonnaise a bit (as previous reviewers have recommended). I served this on endive in addition to the toasted bread.

A tasty treat, but the recipe is too heavy on the mayo, and it covers up the crab and shrimp - espcecially if it's good, fresh seafood. Also, I doubled the cayenne pepper and that improved things.

This was excellent! I omitted the clam juice, and sauteed sliced fresh garlic (about 4 cloves) in olive oil and butter, then added the shrimp. I finely chopped the sauteed garlic and added it to the other ingredients. I added quite a bit more cayenne and paprika also. I used the leftover garlic butter to brush the bruschetta before broiling. This is a great app. for summertime. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. Very easy to prepare, and holds up perfectly: I made it a few hours ahead of time, refrigerated, and reheated under broiler (to crisp bruschetta) prior to serving.

I doubled the receipe, using one pkg of cream cheese with the 1/3 c mayo, added a 1 lb lobster and some Old Bay Seasoning and got rave reviews! Never bothered with the toast, served it with an assortment of crackers. Definitely a summer favorite!

This appetizer is a new favorite. Everyone raves and wants the recipe. Have made it serveral times and wouldn't change a thing! Also,super easy.

I found this recipe too salty! Maybe it was the crab, I'll try it with more shrimp instead of crab the next time, also liked the addition of wasabi as suggested.

Fabulous, easy appetizer. Use a "Misto" olive oil sprayer for the bruschetta instead of brushing (too time consuming). Followed prior reviewer's advice & added dried mustard. This was a great, easy, make-ahead, impressive appetizer. Skip the clam juice and just saute the shrimp in butter.

This dish was really great, I did the same with half the mayo but added some waterchestnuts and finely chopped red pepper for some added crunch and color(1/2 cup total).

I made this dish twice, and it was very good both times, but you need to be careful with the onions. If you have very large onions, the recipe could end up tasting of little but them, masking the crab and shrimp. Otherwise, it's a great appetizer. If you don't want to make the toasts, it's also good just serving the shrimp and crab mixture in a small bowl with crackers alongside.

I did reduce the mayo by half and added a bit of wasabe powder- I had 5 requests for the recipe!!! Made it twice for the same crowd and again had quite a few requests. A great hor d'oeuvre and out of the ordinary!

This was a great solution for a summer lunch because I could prepare it in advance. I used about 1/2 as much mayo as recommended, added a dash of mustard powder and some wasabe to add some kick into it. Everyone loved it!

I replaced the crab with more shrimp. It was delicious, and really had a spicy kick! I would reduce the mayo a bit next time.
