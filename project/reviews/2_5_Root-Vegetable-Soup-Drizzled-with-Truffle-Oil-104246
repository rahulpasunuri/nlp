Oops... I also add about 1 cup of heavy cream prior to using my immersion blender...

This is one of my favorite soup recipes now. I don't brown or roast the veggies. I DO use chicken broth though. It's way better that way. I garnish with creme fraiche (or sour cream), truffle oil or high quality olive oil, sea salt, and fresh cracked pepper.

Look, anyone who makes soup knows that some kind of browning of SOMETHING has to happen. Roast the veggies, drizzle with oil, puree, and add some garlic for god's sake.

This soup was really good when properly seasoned. I took the advice of a previous reviewer and used chicken broth, not water. I also sampled the soup with a little bit of sour cream mixed into the final soup. It gave the soup some richness. Be brave, give it a try.

I used an entire bunch of parsnips when making this recipe, so their flavor somewhat overpowered the soup. In all though, it was very flavorfull. I even liked the taste alone, without the truffle oil, although it added another dimension to the layers of flavor.

Just say NO. What was I thinking when I made this soup. Parsnips and water yum. My first clue should have been 5 cups of water. Where is the flavor. This soup was such a let down and waste of good truffle oil. I actually might try it again starting with bacon and using chicken broth. The color after browning the vegetables was a beautiful brown gravy color, but it tasted like it had flour or something in it. I make a lot of good soups and can usually fix a mediocre one, but this was beyond me. No calories in this one, but who cares.
