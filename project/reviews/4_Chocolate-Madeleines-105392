I should add that I chilled the batter overnight as was suggested in another madeliene recipe, which negated the need for chilling everytime I filled the mold.

This was a lovely recipe, if a bit time-intensive. The recipe was not sufficient to make more than two dozen madeleines (unless perhaps the recipe was written for those mini tins?) I added the rind of one orange which made delicious orange-chocolate madeleines - yum! I also didn't fuss with the chilled molds, or with refrigerating the molds after filling - they came out amazing anyway.

Lovely and delicious. I followed the recipe EXCEPT that I substituted 1 cup sugar and 1.5 t vanilla for the vanilla sugar. Also, I baked these in silicone molds (dark orange) and 7 minutes just didn't cut it -- they were still raw. 10 minutes was just about right -- fully baked and still moist.

I bake a lot. These were excellent. I used vanilla extract instead of vanilla sugar (about 2 teaspoons) and a good quality cocah. I also could not find my Madeleine pans so I used tiny cupcake pans. The recipe produced 36 tiny cupcakes which did not have time to cool in my house -- they were gobbled up so quickly. The whole prpject took much less than an half hour!

This was an awesome recipe. I used regular sugar instead of vanilla and a tsp of vanilla extract. They were gone in the hour. Very easy. I baked them on 350F for 14 minutes instead of the 425F and 7 minutes. They were perfect.

These were so delicious! Moist, tender & lots of chocolate flavor! I followed the recipe exactly and got excellent results. Good stuff.

I made half recipe, and substituted Splenda Sugar Blend for baking (only needs 1/4 cup, possibly less as they were still very sweet). They came out great. I have a "mini" madeleine pan that bakes qty 20 - 1.5" cookies, and baked a pan a day over 3 days, storing the dough in the fridge. The quality and taste was consistent each day. With the splenda sub, they worked out to only about 20 calories per cookie - no guilt! Will definitely make them again!

When I got married I made a boutiful tray with an assortment of fancy cookies and these were absolutely yum. Buttery, chocolatey, crispy edges. I drizzled chocolate icing on top just to give 'em a little shine.

The best recipe ever! The best thing about this recipe is that can be done ahead of time. Actually, it is better when made ahead of time. They are delicious and very easy to make. Go for it!

Straight out of the oven these were outstanding- light and airy- but a few hours later they were not so great. They got tough and oddly enough had a bit of a metallic taste. Lucky for me I actually ate most of them when they were still warm :) Oh, I also undercooked one of the batches accidently so that it was crusty on the outside but still a bit gooey inside, needless to say it was also extremely delicious that way as well but again, not so a few hours later.

In response to the other reviewer who said these are not madeleines, just a chocolate cake recipe - "regular" madeleines are just a white cake/lemon cake recipe. I think it is indeed the shape of the cookies that scream "MADELEINES" - now on to the recipe reveiw: These tasted good and had good texture. They did not look as pretty as the standard madeleines because they did not get that nice brown crusty coating (well, they did but you could not see it because these cookies are brown). i dressed them up with some powdered sugar instead. A nice twist on an old standard - i will definitely make these again. I might add some orange zest next time - that sounds like it would be good!

Sounds delicious, but it's just a plain chocolate cake batter. It needs more than the look to be called a madeleine. And be aware, 1/2 cup of unsweeted cocoa weights a lot more than 90g. The batter becomes pretty hard after refrigeration, are we supposed to stir it again?

These are my favorite recipe for Madeleines. The best thing about it you can make it ahead of time. They get better if left in the Refrigerator a few hours or even a day.

ok, i'm giving this a good rating because if made as instructed i'm sure they would be great. however, it's bastile day so i wanted to make something french. i had no sugar, butter, or eggs (i know...) so i used brown sugar, crisco, and an oil/water/baking soda formula to replace eggs. they turned into black craters in the oven. dont do what i did. use real ingredients and i'm sure they will be great.

These were tasty enough but a better madeleine recipe can be found on this website (Bon Appetit January 2000). That recipe makes a lemon-flavored madeleine, but cocoa powder can easily be substituted with excellent results.

I thought they were tasty. They were full-bodied with just the right proportion of chocolate taste, nice texture. Instead of eating them with tea like traditional madeleines, I would eat them with coffee or ice cream. (or coffee ice cream? Hey, there's an idea!)

YUM! Though it took me a couple of batches to get the baking time right, they ended up perfect! Dusted with a little powdered sugar and voila! Is it cake or a cookie? Who cares, they're GREAT! Also, I made the batter a day before and refridgerated it.
