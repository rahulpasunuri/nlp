This is a nice fruity salsa. My only complaint was that it looked pretty yellow/white bland in the bowl. Adding a diced jalapeno and perhaps a diced red-bell pepper would not only liven up the look of it, but the taste as well. I liked the honey in place of the brown sugar, which most peach salsas recommend.

This recipe was ok. It had an interesting flavor, but there was too much liquid compare to the amount of fruit and it was more of an herb salsa then a peach and apple salsa. The flavors competed for attention, with the honey, spices and cilantro being most prominent and overpowering the taste of the fruit.

I thought this recipe was ok. The combination of cilantro and the spices creates an odd overpowering flavor. I wasn't sure what I wanted to taste lessand I didn't even use 1/2 cup of cilantro. I was glad to have tried it, but will not make it again.

This is an exceptional salsa. Can even use canned peaches, leave out the apples but always use the wonderful herbs and spices. Great taste. I used it on salmon, chicken and would try it on beef!!! Judy

Wow! This is so good. I love salsas and this one is one of the best I've ever had. I could eat it alone. Ate it with my own recipe for pan-fried skinless, boneless chicken breasts. Great flavors! Everyone should try this.

This stuff ROCKS. Lakes Region's jalapeno idea gives it a nice kick. I tripled the batch, and have some left over, so I'm thinking of using it on top of chicken quesadillas. It is so good it would go with almost anything...or just spoon it up by itself!

Very tastey. I add some diced Jalepenos.

This was so refreshing and wonderful. I thought the sweet/sour combo was perfect as written. Though, I did cut down on the cilantro a little, just for personal preference. Yummy!

I changed the recipe considerably: I substituted a Vidalia onion for the apple, used just 1 tablespoon of honey, left out the spices, and added a finely minced jalapeño pepper. I served it with black bean quesadillas. Very fresh peaches made it delicious.

I love this recipe!!! I have been making this for almost 10 years now and haven't gotten sick of it yet. It is amazing over honey-lime grilled chicken and I serve it with black beans over saffron rice. To me, this meal is a summer must-have.

This receipe is one of our summer family favorites. Why anyone needed to control "their gag reflex" is beyond me and an exageration. It is sweet but is off set by the tartness of the lime. Highly recommend it!

This recipe was fantastic!! I altered the honey to only 2 teaspoons. I served it over grilled salmon and grilled chicken and it was a huge hit! It was light/healthy and very flavorful!!

I must admit I altered the idea quite a bit. Didnt have lime juice so I used some oj and balsamic vinegar. Also added garlic. Resluts are pretty good but I guess I am not really reviewing this recipe but something new. "Italian Salsa"?

This recipe is way to weet, and I only used 1/2 of the honey. It was more like a dessert than anything. the cinnamon was almost overpowering as well. It doesn't do anything for the peaches either.

Never before has suppressing my gag reflex been so difficult. Had it not been for a 24 hour pharmacy, this salsa would have kept me up all night in agony.

Easy, healthy, and delicious!

Amazing flavor and taste. A wonderful treat. I made it with the marinated and grilled chicken recipe, but in the future, I'd skip the marinade. The salsa with plain ol' grilled chicken would be wonderful by itself.

Delicious. Quick and easy to make. Can't wait to have it again.

This is a great salsa recipe. I actually used it on grilled pork chops I had juiced up with a spicy dry rub. Everyone loved it. I've got a brother who is a chef and he told me he was going to make it one of his specials.

I've been making this for years and I have found that swordfish works wonderful with the salsa (in addition to the original chicken version).

I use frozen Peaches and they also worked well. This was very easy and refeshing. I will be making this for company this summer.

You can even make this recipe with canned peaches if peaches are not in season. Delicious!
