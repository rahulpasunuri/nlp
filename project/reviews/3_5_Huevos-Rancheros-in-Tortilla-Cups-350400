My husband loved them - a bit heavy on the oil. Added green opinions to beans? Easy recipe.

I've made these for Christmas morning brunch the last two years. A huge hit. Used black beans and Mexi-blend grated cheese. Sprayed pans and tortillas with non-stick spray. Cooked approx. 18 min and eggs are always fully cooked but the flavors are divine! This recipe is on the keeper list. I've also made a batch and have them as an quick breakfast for the work week.

I lliked the way the tortilla cups looked, and liked the idea that I can make a lot at one time. But what stopped me from giving it 4 forks was the odd, stale- crunchy texture of the corn tortilla after it came out of the oven. But I'll try it again, but the next time I'll shorten the baking time (it was in the oven for 25 minutes and the eggs were fully cooked) and ensure that I really grease the custard cups because mine stuck.

Great and super easy! I had flour tortillas so I used those and cut the heat way down to suit my taste. I also didn't realize until I got started that I didn't have enough eggs, so on some of the cups, I just used extra beens and cheese and they were good, too. My husband thought it was a delicious dish and striking to look at, too.

Quick, easy and very good! I had no problem with sticking (I used a spray oil) and the tortilla bowls make a great presentation. The yolk was solid after about 24 min but it was still tasty.

Wonderful. Made it just as instructed with the exception of the cheese. I used a blend of Mexican cheeses. Surprised my husband with this for Father's Day. He absolutely loved it!

A nice twist on how I normally make my huevos rancheros. Half of my tortilla cups became stuck to the bowls I cooked them in, so in the future I would fry the tortilla and form it in a bowl, and cook the beans and eggs separately, then assemble the dish. Used canned salsa, but still delicious.

I pretty much followed the instructions for this one but did not have a big enough tortilla and even though I used two smaller tortillas in a bowl they held together pretty well. The trick is knowing when to take it out so the eggs are still a little runny. I would add some chorizo the next time around.

These were a hit at our holiday brunch! I followed the recipe mainly as written, using black beans and large muffin cups. I misted everything with olive oil and didn't have any sticking problems. I also piped a little spicy black bean dip and sour cream mixture over the tops for a little extra kick. --Will definitely make again.

These looked so cute! Used black beans and baked without the cheese (offered cheese at the table). As per previous suggestions, I used a muffin tin sprayed with cooking spray and they lifted out pretty easily. The eggs cooked in about 23 minutes. Instead of the pico de gallo I used "Fresh Tomatillo Salsa" from Gourmet, September 2007. All-in-all, a very nice recipe, suitable for company.

I've made this recipe a dozen or so times and my family loves it. I've made a few adaptions - I use Emile Henry french onion soup bowls as my custard cups are tiny; I use cooking spray to insure that the bowls and the tortillas are coated and there will be no issues with sticking; I usually use black beans rather than pinto; and, finally, I cook it for much less time and I still usually end up with at least one that is slightly overdone. Tonight I'm going to try the recipe with slightly flatter bowls......

I'm not rating b/c I made a couple of minor changes. I couldn't find cumin so I left that out. I ran out of jack and finished a couple with sharp cheddar, which was actually pretty good. A mix of the two would be good. They puffed up quite a bit. My husband thought the cilantro was overpowering, and I actually forgot to put it into the pico. I didn't agree, I thought it was good. We served it with bottled green chile, and sour cream would've been good too. I overcooked them slightly (the saddest part) and so they weren't runny and were a little dried out (including the shells). I urge you not to overcook them, even by a minute or two, which was all I did.

I've made this in popover pans and muffine pans - only issue is how long to bake. It is a great way to serve a crowd all at once and makes a beautiful presentation. I serve with a salsa/sour cream mixture and advocados. Never had a complaint, except "are there any more?"

I had trouble with the tortillas sticking inside the custard cups, so couldn't get them out and instead had to eat them out of the cups. I only baked them for 22 minutes, but the eggs were already cooked through. I wasn't impressed with this recipe, and won't bother making it again.

This recipe was terrific! I added some fried Chorizo to the tortilla cups and used refried beans instead of whole beans otherwise I followed the directions exactly and they came out perfect. I served it with a side of fried potatoes to make it a complete meal.

I have been eyeing this recipe since I got my copy of the mag. WOW can not believe it took me so long to make it! Very easy to make, longest part of it was standing in front of my opened freezer trying to decide that the plastic bag was really cilantro and not parsley. Next time I will lessen the baking time, usually I check reviews BEFORE making a dish but didn't and should have because the eggs were over cooked. Served with a lime tomato salsa and sour cream. YUM

This is a great breakfast especially for a crowd. Ive cooked it twice, once I cooked 18 and the second time 24 at once and they all turned out. The only problem is getting the cooking time right. The cooking time needs to be shortened.

Quick, easy and fun. We'll have these again.

This was so easy and delicious. I made it in a muffin pan because I didn't have custard cups and it worked perfectly. In the future I'll make sure the bottom of the cups are well-oiled as mine stuck a little bit, but otherwise this was a lovely breakfast. I'd make it for brunch because it's a great way to potentially cook a lot of eggs perfectly at exactly the same time! I'm going to make it again, soon!

Really yummy but I would add the cheese after taking out of the oven next time. With the cheese on you can't tell easily when the eggs are properly cooked and they were over cooked after 27 minutes. Still tasted great with a nice avocado salad on the side!

This recipe is a great way to present huevos rancheros. I added sour cream to the top.

I didn't have custard cups but used a muffin tin and it worked just as well! I would salt and pepper the egg when placed in the cup for a little more flavor. The baking time was a bit of a surprise so you do have to plan ahead a little if you have hungry people waiting for this to come out of the oven at breakfast. (Or you could just fix bloody marys to keep 'em busy while waiting!)

Good, the tortilla cups are a nice way of presenting these. I pretty much followed the recipe as written.
