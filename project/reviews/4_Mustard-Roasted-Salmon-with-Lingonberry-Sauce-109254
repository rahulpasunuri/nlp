We've made this often, including for Christmas dinner. It's a wonderful combination of flavors. We've had a hard time finding lingonberry preserves, so we substituted whole cranberry sauce and it was excellent.

Super easy and full of flavor. I made the recipe pretty much as is, lowered butter a little, used cider vinegar, used honey dijon mustard (but would love to have it with a more full-flavored mustard), red onion instead of shallot. Got rave reviews. Served with sweet potato puree with goat cheese, and roasted carrots. You could make this with just about any fish, chicken, or pork. Sublime.

Loved the contrast of flavours- rich salmon, tart preserved. And the mustard makes it! Very special-seeming weeknight dinner or even worthy of guests if you double.

I agree with some of the other reviewers ,this is nice weekday dish, great flavors, easy to prepare, and typically have all of the ingredients on-hand.

This is one of my favorite go-to weekday meals. I get the lingonberry preserves from IKEA, but I think if you can't find them, you could probably use canned or leftover cranberry sauce. They taste similar to me. Every time I serve this to friends, they think I'm a rock star. Can't beat that!

This recipes continues to be a family favorite that we make at least once a month. We also bake the salmon on a tray in the BBQ. Sauces also work well with chicken.

This is my favorite dish to prepare for guests. So easy to make, delicious, and always impresses! I have subbed every ingredient for another at some point, screwed up proportions while cooking from memory, and the dish never fails to be amazing. Will make it again & again...

I just made this recipe again and didn't have lingonberry preserverse so I used my homemade blackberry preserves. I thickened the sauce with a slurry and it was outstanding!

Loved this recipe. Have made it many times and when I want to make something different, my husband wants me to make it this way. It is so easy. The only thing is that I add more lingonberry preserves and more raspberry vinegar to make more dressing.

I used sugar-free rasberry preserve to cut the sweetnes and it worked great. Will make again.

The whole family really enjoyed this. However, by the end of the meal the sweetness was a little much. Nest time, I would make the salmon and skip the sauce. Or I would serve the sauce on the side.

My hubby loved this recipe!!! I used raspberry preserves, and it worked great. Next time, though, I would probably cut back a bit on the mustard and use 1/2 the amt of butter

I made this recipe about a month ago & my husband has asked for it again ever since! It was delicious & very easy to make. I cheated and used Lingonberry sauce from IKEA & I also added more than the recipe called for....delicious!

So quick and simple. I don't usually follow recipes exactly, but this one looked so good as it was, the only change I made was subbing a dash of balsamic for the raspberry vinegar, which I didn't have. Definitely a keeper. Even my husband, who doesn't like mustard, thought it was yummy.

In addition to my previous rating, I wanted to mention that we had leftovers, and the flavors were way better the next day. I would love to serve this to guests, but do you have any suggestions on reheating/serving day-old cooked salmon? Perhaps a better idea would be just marinading the salmon a day ahead smothered with the mustard, and letting the berry/shallot sauce meld a day ahead also??

Rating: 2
Very easy to make. I think this would have gotten 3 forks, but my oven is gas, older, and I have not yet figured out how to get the same end product versus using the newer ovens. Mine did not crisp up, and I even broiled it for a little bit (but I didn't want to over cook the salmon either). It browned, the flavors were great, but if I had been able to use a better quality oven, I'm sure it would have turned out as expected. Will try it again for sure.

This was such a tasty and easy dinner. I spiced the fresh wild salmon the way we like it and coated it with minced garlic (since forgot to buy shallots)and roasted garlic mustard from stonewallkitchen.com. And put it on the grill since it's summer. Otherwise I would broil it. Made the sauce with the rest of the ingredients,and yes used lingonberry. It would be best. Great salmon recipe and would make it again.

Served this for a dinner party last night and got rave reviews and a request for the recipe. The mustard glaze never really "browned" and I pulled it out so I wouldn't over cook the salmon. This is a keeper.

This is an easy and delicious way to cook salmon. I think the lingonberries are far better than cranberries in the sauce (i've tried both). I order lingonberries from mexgrocer.com

This is so easy and really savory. I agree that the lingonberry could be exhanged for cranberry, but I made it just as described and it is moist and lick-the-plate good!

This is one of those simple to make, but everyone raves about it meals. They think it took you longer to prepare. I bought Loganberry jam, not remembering the recipe was for Lingonberry, but since I don't know the difference, it was still delicious and it will remain on top list of easy, delicious meals to prepare.

I decided to try this dish b/c the other reviews were so good, but the flavor combinations of mustard with lingonberries did not really mix well. The honey-glazed salmon recipe on this site is much better.

Hey, one more thing. You can usually get lingonberry sauce (not to mention a complimentary mustard and sometimes even very good frozen salmon)at IKEA.

Rating: 3
I was sceptical about this recipe, but I had salmon and nothing much else (yet I did have lingonberry sauce - go figure). My modifications: *Rubbed the salmon in herbes de Provence *I cooked the shallots in half butter, half ginger oil - very good. *I used balsamic instead of rasberry vinegar, which gave the sauce some extra depth. That left it a little too sweet though. A dash of chipotle powder would have helped cut the sweetness and impart the smoky flavor this sauce was crying out for. Not that I'm one of those people who puts chipotle in everything. *Next time I want to try kicking it up the salmon with a little horseradish in the mustard.

I made this with freshly caught king salmon, and shared it with the fisherman and his wife. It was super fast and easy (I used cranberry sauce), and won rave reviews from my husband and our guests. We eat a lot of fresh salmon and I'm always on the lookout for a new and unusual recipe...this is a KEEPER!

This was nice and very easy, but not the best salmon I've ever made. I prefer the Salmon w/Soy-Honey and Wasabi Sauces on this website.

It was different, and not unpleasant, but if I got it at a restaurant I probably wouldn't order it again. It was, however, quick and easy to make. You can find lingonberry preserves at IKEA, too.

This is different. BUT if I had some fresh, wild salmon I would choose another recipe. This one is simple to prepare and suits all the farm-raised salmon that's in the marketplace.

WOW! I'm not a salmon fan, but since it has those wonderful Omega 3 fatty acids, I decided to give this a try. IT WAS FANTASTIC! I used whole cranberry sauce in place of the lingonberry preserves. The recipe is easy and full of flavor!

A nice blend of sweet and tangy taste. It was very simple to cook although lingonberry preserve was hard to find. I bought it at World Market.

Rating: 4
Really wonderful and so easy! I used equal amounts of butter and mustard to tone it down a bit and that worked well. The sauce was so delicious, a nice sweet and tangy combination. It seemed a little thin, so I stirred in a little cornstarch mixed with water at the end, which thickened it just a bit. Served with rice pilaf, grilled asparagus and an Oregon Pinot Noir--a heavenly combination!

Quick, but just so-so. You can buy lingonberry preserves at IKEA, for under $5.

I agree that the sauce somewhat overwhelms the taste of the salmon, but I still give it four forks. It's fast, delicious, beautiful and unusual - the kind of rare "wow" recipe you only find once or twice a year, and then press upon all of your friends. I can make a more subtle salmon dish another day. Thanks to the reviewers who convinced me to try it!

We thought this was delicious and SO quick and easy! The house didn't smell fishy either, like it so often does when you cook fish on top of the stove. I had no trouble finding the lingonberry preserves in the specialty sections of both shops in my small Connecticut town but at almost $8.00 a jar, they were wickedly expensive. Not a problem though, as we'll be making this again and again. The tart/sweet sauce was a perfect complement to the salmon.

I was EXTREMELY skeptical about all that Dijon mustard on the salmon, but this turned out to be DELICIOUS. I only added salt to the preserve mixture and none on top of the salmon fillets. I couldn't find lingonberry preserves, so I used 1/2 blackberry preserves and 1/2 raspberry jam. Then I subbed balsamic vinegar for the raspberry vinegar. Well, the sauce was way too sour, so I added extra blackberry preserves to the sauce, and the final dish was EXCELLENT. But next time I would use less vinegar in the topping mixture.

Rating: 2
The mustard coating is good (no extra salt, i agree) but the sauce is too sweet for salmon unless you barely drizzle it. It would be better used on grilled swordfish or duck breast.

Rating: 3
I made the recipe as directed, using a scandinavian lingonberry jam, and raspberry vinegar. The small berries had an intense and delightful flavor, somewhat similar to cranberries but slightly sweeter. The dijon mustard sauce covering the salmon was a bit intense (overly salty, too much vinegar considering the berry sauce on top). Next time, I would cut the mustard sauce in half (or omit it), and avoid sprinkling the salmon with salt. The sauce is interesting enough, that you could probably use it alone.

Lingonberries are not hard to find. They are available in our regular grocery store in St. Louis. If yoiu are looking for a substitute, the preserves have a flavor similar to cranberries.

Its all about the sauce! I used blackberry preserves instead of the lingonberry. FANTASTIC! So fast and wonderful. Really - just cook the salmon any way you want - with or without the mustard - its the berry/vingear sauce that makes it wonderful. I like my salmon on the sweet side. This is destined to be our new favorite fast weeknight dinner.

Hi fron Paul Smiths again! Never made it to Ikea, so I used blueberry preseves, and 12yr old balsamic instead of the raspberry vinegar. WOW!!! My husband was skeptical, putting jelly on fish, with mustard?!?!?!, but we both LOVED it. Yum. will definitely make again, and serve to company.

Tantalizingly festive! A unique blending of piquancy and sweetness. I substituted black rasberry preserves for the lingonberry, rice wine vinegar for the raspberry vinegar and minced red onion for the shallots. Necessity is the mother of invention...they say.

Suggestion: as a substitute for lingonberry preserves, try raspberry jam or jelly mixed with blackberry jam or jelly. The resulting flavour is very close to lingonberry although a bit sweeter so correct with a dash or two of lemon juice or increase the vinegar amount. If you are fortunate enough to live in the Pacific Northwest, an excellent substitute would be wild salmon berries(like tart raspberries and salmon in colour). They were often served with salmon by the native coastal Indian peoples.

Lingonberry sauce was great, I used red wine vinegar but did find Lingonberry preserves at a Scandinavian deli. I'm going to use half as much mustard and butter on the salmon next time I make it. The combination of sauce and mustard is good.

The mustard really adds a great flavor to the salmon. I, too, used the cranberries because ligonberry, etc., is just real hard for me to find. Also, since I live alone and cook for one, this dish is even better the next day.
