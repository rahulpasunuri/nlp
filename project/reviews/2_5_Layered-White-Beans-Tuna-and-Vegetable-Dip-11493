The top layer is like tzatziki - fantastic! However, the dip seems too heavy to scoop up. Worked better as a spread on crackers, bread. But overall, a good dish and one I'll make again.

I came across this recipe when I was looking around and remembered I made it years ago. It sounds fantastic, but is really blah. It's not awful, but I never made it again.
