I used this recipe with the bone from our Christmas ham and then made navy bean soup. The stock was delicious! I followed the recipe but left out the cloves (didn't have whole cloves and it didn't sound that good!). Will definitely use again!!!

I used several meaty ham bones for this recipe and followed it fairly closely. Then, I used it as a base for your hearty lentil and ham soup, adding more ham. Very, very good.
