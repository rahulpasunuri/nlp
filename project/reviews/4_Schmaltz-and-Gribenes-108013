This recipe brought me back to my youth. Oh those friday nights at Grandma's house!

This is a treat in Germany that you don't see that often anymore. Once cool, smear a piece of brown bread thinly with the schmaltz, sprinkle the crispy chicken skin over it and eat it ... sounds bizarre but is really lovely. If you make this in advance, then take the skin and roast it for a couple of minutes as hot as you can to get it crunchy again before serving.

I find if you put some water in the pan and bring to a boil the fat begins to render out more quickly. Just lower the heat so it doesn't splatter, and simmer out the water leaving the fat and skin to brown. In Germany, I ate in a place that served the schmaltz and gribenes seasoned with toasted minced onions, salt and pepper as a appetizer spread with crackers. Tasted great.
