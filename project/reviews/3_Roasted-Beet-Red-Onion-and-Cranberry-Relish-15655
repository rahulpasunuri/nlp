Quite good. Added diced apple to the leftovers the next day and that was good too.

Excellent! Found this recipe, looking for a standard cranberry relish to accompany the Christmas turkey. At first taste, I could not wait, and used aside my garden salad, topped with salmon, at tonight's dinner. A definite hit with invited friends! Upon first read of the recipe, was afraid it might've be too sweet, but found it to be well-balanced with cranberries, balsamic vinegar and horsradish

as someone who does not care for sweet flavors in general, i have just prepared this for thanksgiving dinner. it's really different and very tasty! if you like beets you will love this! i did take a short cut and bought canned beets.

An interesting potential combination, but turned out too vinegary/sour. Not a hit at our roast turkey meal.

Although more than a handful of my guests enjoyed this relish, I found the flavor combination too piquant for my taste. To complement entrees of both prime ribs of beef and a spiral-cut baked ham I thought this might do the trick. Better to go with a roasted turkey, chicken or even duck.
