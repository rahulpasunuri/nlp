A great recipe! A few modifications - added an extra egg cut back on the sugar. Will make again but will add some orange zest and golden flax seeds

I found this recipe after already starting to make a traditional chocolate chip cookie recipe. So I cut the flour in that recipe, then added 2 c. oatmeal to that recipe, plus 1/2 c. chopped ginger, and they were fabulous! I always reduce the time and temp when making cookies, baked these at 325 in a convection oven for 12 min. They were soft, moist, & still oatmeal chewy. Lots of compliments all around by family & friends.

These are extremely delicious and different! Not sure why this recipe didn't work for some... I followed it pretty closely with a few small changes: reduced salt to 1/2 t, increased baking powder to 3/4 t, reduced sugar to 1 cup (1/2 c white, 1/2 c brown), used 1/2 c "uncrystallized candied ginger" (from Trader Joe's), and added 1/4 t ground ginger and a generous 1/2 t cinnamon. One thing I've found is that (along with the right "room" temp butter) mixing the leavening agent (soda or powder), salt, and spices in with the butter/sugar instead of with the flour gives me "fluffier," never flat cookies - maybe it's all in my head, but I did that with these cookies and they turned out great!

This is my new favorite cookie recipe, however, I do find them a bit too sweet for my taste. On my second batch I only used 1c brown sugar. I made mine larger than the recipe called for, ending up with 28 cookies, and still found that even 14 min is too long. I took them out at 12 min. I think I'll try adding some orange zest next time to brighten them a bit.

Easy and delicious! I made the recipe as written except I used all white flour ( didn't have any whole wheat) and I didn't grind the oatmeal. The cookies were chewy and tasty. I love the chocolate and ginger combination! The cookies were a little flat.

This is one of the best oatmeal cookie recipes I've made in a while. It has a very good balance of salty and sweet and chewy. I probably used the wrong kind of ginger, but I had no problems making this. The ginger's spice makes you crave more.

I used 1 1/4 cups of white sugar and 1 1/2 tblspns of molasses because I didn't have brown sugar. I also used half the ginger that was called for and added 3/4 cup finely chopped pecans :)

I normally don't like to spend my time bashing recipes that might have failed due to a fault of my own, but here I feel that the fork rating on these puppies is misleading. Thus, I am writing to report that I have followed the recipe, used the correct ingredients, and have watched as rocks emerged from my oven. Rocks. They are tasty rocks, and boy do I love the ginger/chocolate/oatey combination, but rocks are sure hard to chew, and even harder to pawn off on your friends. So be wary. It might be useful to note that those people who have claimed considerable success with this recipe have used white flour (and sometimes white sugar) instead of whole wheat, which is probably the reason that they had better results (but Im no pastry chef). I'm sure if you put some lard or other fatty goodness in there, these would fluff up quite nicely as well. Unfortunately, I picked this recipe because it had whole wheat flour (hey, every grain counts) and for my efforts turned out some nice hockey pucks instead of a chewy, gooey mess. Sigh. But if you really want to crack your jaws on a cookie with a good flavor combination, go on ahead and try these.

Instead of chocolate, I used dried cranberries, which worked really well in this recipe. I also used 1.5c oatmeal, beacuse that was all I had, and I found that it was more than enough. Taking the advice of others, I added 1/2 tsp powdered ginger into the dry ingrefients, and the balance of flavours and "gingery-ness" was just right.

I made these over the holidays, substituted a blend of dried cranberries, pecans and sunflower seeds since it's a bit sweet for my taste... got rave reviews from one and all!

I agree with samacusa - these were terrible. The flavor was off, no ginger taste. It was like eating a piece of cardboard. The ginger and chocolate DID NOT work. I won't make these again. They didn't get eaten when I took them to the hospital for the nurses. I had to toss them out - how embarrassing! My baking always gets rave reviews - no one said ANYTHING which means they stunk. What a waste of ingredients!

These sounded great & I followed the recipe to the "T", using high quality ingredients but the cookies are terrible. The ginger doesn't work, the cookie is salty, flavorless & has a terrible texture (I made a "soft batch & a crisper batch, they were both dry & heavy). They taste more like a lump of health food than a chewy treat. I will not make these again!

There's still a batch in the oven and I had to comment about how great these cookies are (I've eaten two right off the tray while still hot). I'm not usually a fan of chocolate chips in oatmeal cookies but these go great with the ginger. I used all white flour and white sugar instead of honey (didn't have any) and they're fine. I did whir the oats in the food processor (I usually like the whole oat flakes) and found it made the cookie quite nice. Not a tough step and worth doing. I love crystallized ginger and these have plenty; make sure to mix the dough adequately: I had a LOT of chocolate pieces and ginger chunks at the bottom; those last cookies are quite loaded. Can't wait to serve these tomorrow to the bigwhigs coming to my meeting.

Impressive recipe with chewy, decadent results, however cooking time was MUCH too long for my oven. After 12 minutes the cookies were charred. I baked subsequent batches for 10 minutes (on foil, not parchment) and they turned out really well.

Loved them! I used the sugared ginger because I had it in my kitchen. I also substituted quick oats and didn't do the food processor step. They turned out great!

WOW! I made them per the recipe the first time and brought them to a potluck. The cookies vanished! However, I was a little underwhelmed by the lack of 'gingeryness'. So, I've altered the recipe by adding about an 1/8th cup of grated fresh ginger and 2 tsp of powdered ginger. BAM! I love ginger and dark chocolate together!

I bake so many cookies at this time of year I can't even eat them but these were so good I couldn't keep away. The ginger adds a nice twist to the standard oatmeal cookie. I will definately be baking these next year.

A nice twist on the traditional oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. These are always a hit!

These cookies have a funny aftertaste. I suggest that the ginger pieces should be less finely chopped, more chocolate would benefit the taste and the honey should be omitted in favor of 1 1/2 cups sugar (perhaps 1/2c light brown, balance white.)

These cookies are made of pure awesome. I followed the recipe, except that I used all white flour (instead of part wheat) and I did not grind the dry ingredients in the food processor, I just stirred them together. I also underbaked by about 60-90 seconds. I've made these three times now, they have been a hit with everyone.

This flavor combination is a gourmet treasure treat. It can not be fully appreciated by the Betty Crocker cooks that accidentally come across this website. I followed this recipe to the "T" and the results I got were picture perfect and beyond.

A tastey cookied but too much dry ingredients made them mounds instead of crisp or chewy cookies. I used only 1/4 cup of ginger which turned out perfect for my family that might have been scared away by too much ginger

Although the decision to add chunks of candied ginger to an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe is inspired, the basic cookie here is just meh. Too salty, and the texture was off no matter what the bake time. I tried underbaking for a chewier cookie, but still tough. Tried baking for a crisp cookie, but they were too tough to chew. I recommend using the "Vanishing Oatmeal Cookie" recipe off of the Quaker Oatmeal box, omitting the cinnamon and raisins, and adding chocolate chunks and chopped candied ginger. Skip this recipe.

Great recipe, I couldn't find ginger that wasn't sugar coated, but still turned out just fine. They baked to perfection on a baker's stone! Very Tasty!

Great cookies, just how I like them. I didn't have whole wheat flour, so used wholemeal instead (might be the same thing, but named differently in Britain?) and baked them exactly as directed. They came out just crispy on the outside, and chewy and moist on the inside. Excellent!

These are BY FAR the best cookies I've baked. Even though I over baked one batch. I used less sugar (2/3 cup) and subbed 1/2 coconut for the ginger. Also, all whole wheat flour. Ya, I know, blasphemous. Everyone is asking for the recipe.

Super. I also added some toasted, chopped walnuts.
