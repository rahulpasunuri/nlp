Tasty recipe. Lamb steaks were difficult and pricy to purchase. Love the creamy/healthiness of the sauce.

Bland! Messy to eat. The only Epicurious recipe I've made that didn't live up to its' "fork rating"

I use all of the ingredients in this recipe, but in a different order. The cucumber, tomato, onion, and dill get mixed into the yogurt. I serve the couscous as a side dish, usually mixed with raisins and almonds. I look forward to making this dish whenever we have leftover lamb.

Great dish. The yogurt is the winner. I put some dill in the yogurt that the recipe did not call for. Not the most formal dish but great for kids and friends on a weekend outside.

Outstanding! Very simple and flavorful dish. Made no changes and will be making regularly from now on. Even shoveled a path in the snow to the grill to make this last night, well worth it.

This recipe is fantastic. I even added a teaspoon of nutmeg to the rub to give it a little added flavor. I suggest you try it sometime; it'll make your next dinner party a hit!!

Delicious, flavorful, simple... perfect! I made a few changes to accommodate my own taste: instead of garlic I used finely chopped fresh chives in the yogurt, and I put mint instead of fennel in the couscous. Everybody was raving.

since it is february in chicago, i didn't fire up the charcoal grill, but used my grill pan. i love the combination of lamb and cumin, and this recipe is outstanding and it will become a regular on my dinner table. i also substituted orzo for the couscous with excellant results. give it a try!
