I hate that I didn't like this - I wanted to but I just couldn't get past the frozen apples. It was just weird. I made this exactly as stated - made my own graham cracker crust. I loved the ease of this recipe, but would have traded the ease for real apple pie with a big scoop of ice cream on top!

This is a good recipe, not a great one. Maybe it's just my family, but frozen apples is not a big hit with any of us. On the other hand, it was pretty easy to assemble and something you could conceivably do with children. I'm just not crazy about the frozen apple taste.

PS: My favorite dulce de leche is "La Lechera". You can find it next to the sweetened condensed milk in the Latin section of most markets. Just prepare yourself, because you will start to find MANY uses for this yummy stuff!

I don't usually review recipes, but this one is special and deserves some extra discussion! It came out fantastic. I followed the recipe almost entirely. I made my own crust because I wanted to make sure my pie dish was deep enough. I used Cortland apples because they looked the best at the store, and added cinnamon to them while they were cooking. (I used regular sugar instead of confectioner's and it melted fine.) People raved about it and said it was the best ice cream pie they'd ever had. I will definitely make this again. Thanks!

This was great! I did not make any adjustments to the recipe and it came out nicely. I froze overnight and let it sit out for 30 minutes before serving. Delicious and pretty on the plate.

Not a rating (yet!); but it appears that a large percentage are thinking that dulce de leche is a brand. It's not, it's just referring to the Mexican caramel (often made with piloncillo, the brown sugar found at markets, and goats milk) Many commercial brands are available. Even easier would be to purchase dulce de leche ice cream (Haagen Dazs makes a good one, but there are others) and layer that with the apples.

This dessert was very easy to make, presentation was great, tastes great...enjoyed by all. The only complaint I have (as some of the other reviewers) is that the apples were much more frozen than the rest of the dessert. Never the less, it will be made again!

Made this over the Chrstmas holidays. Everyone loved this dessert -- the caramel is a great taste with the apples. I made my own graham cracker crust because I could not find a ready-made one big enough for the pie (this fills up a big deep dish). The only problem with the pie is that the ice cream layers soften and are ready to eat way before the apple layer, which stays pretty frozen. Most of my guests didn't seem to mind. Rich, but tastes light and refreshing because of the ice cream.

YUM, YUM, YUM! The easiest dessert to make and it will really impress people. The combination of ingredients is wonderful and everyone will love it. Add some cinnamon to the apple mixture, it really enhances the apple flavor. I will definitely make this again and again.

This is the simplest "fancy dessert" item I have ever made! The ingredients are extremely easy to come by, and it's very refreshing for a nice summer day. I have improvised a lot on this though. First of all, I bought most of the ingredients in the lower-fat versions. The Graham Cracker crust was reduced fat, the Caramel was a Fat-Free Smuckers brand (couldn't find the recommended brand on this website recipe), used salted margarine, did not quite sift the confectionary sugar thoroughly, and used a mixture of both pecans and walnuts. However, I think the biggest difference is that I added some cinnamon while browning the apples over the stove after adding in the sifted sugar. It gave the pie a more authentic old-fashioned style taste to it. The end result was that it probably didn't turn out as sweet as it intended to be, which was fine for me, since I do not prefer my desserts to be too sugary. Don't let all the lower-fat stuff fool yeah... the entire pie came out really decadent! I highly recommend making this dessert if you want something fast and fun to make on a weeknight-- esp. after coming home from a long day at work. Thank you to the person who shared this recipe!!!

Easy to make and it taests amazing. A huge hit at the Super Bowl party. I suggest Not to put too much juice that came out of the apples in the pie. I just put the cooled, cooked apple in the pie. And maybe not that much Caramel either. The apples and Ice Cream is sweet enough.

I made this for a New Year's Eve dessert for friends. I followed the recipe exactly except I used Kraft caramel topping vs the fancy named. It came out wonderful, my guest loved it. I used crushed pecans and swizzled the caramel topping over it to give it a nice look. The recipe said serve one hour after returning to the freezer. I made mine the night before and left it in the freezer overnight. I was a little worried how frozen the apples would be after that much time, but after a twenty minute thaw, it served nicely with the apples having a sweet popcicle consistancy.
