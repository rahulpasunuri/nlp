My husband love this. I made it as is with the exception of adding oregano, thyme, basil and garlic. All fresh from the garden. Very tasty. Highly recommend.

This is very good, but it would benefit from more olives, and from painting the surface of the loaf with beaten egg so that olives adhere better.

This is my favourite focaccia recipe. I use the food processor to mix the ingredients, have used both all-purpose and bread flour equally successfully but I have two suggestions. I don't bother to either cool the potato completely nor do I proof the yeast before adding. Just dump everything in the processor and go from there. Also I have found that a lower oven temp helps produce a better loaf - but this might be a problem with my oven.

I just made this and it's really wonderful. The consistency is just right. Definitely worth making.

This is better than the olive focaaccia in my favorite Italian bakery. You definitely need to use fresh rosemary, and it's worth the splurge on high quality olives. I make it on a pizza stone, and it seems to come out best when the oven temperature is steady -- so try not to open the door and check on it too much.

Rather than run to the store first, I made this with dried rosemary and a blend of all-purpose and whole wheat flour that I already had in the cupboard, but otherwise followed the recipe. Two things to note...the bread came out very dense and a bit undercooked, and I also thought it tasted quite bitter. Maybe the bitterness is from the substitutions I made, so I would advise against doing that, and I would also suggest cooking the dough on a pizza stone. I left it in for 15 minutes, but the bottom of the bread was still a little sticky while the top was getting too dark.

Wow...great recipe. I used dry rosemary, a pizza stone with parchment paper and was pleased with the results. I used the bread for a sandwich. I spread fresh pesto on top, grilled chicken breast, roasted red pepper and fresh mazzorella! Unbelievable. Can't wait to experiment with it further. Very impressive!

This is the most wonderful focaccia I have ever made, and my husband agrees. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I added one clove of garlic (diced) and one shallot, both of which I carmelized in a little bit of olive oil. The house smelled incredible -- like a pizza parlor, only better. The bread had a wonderful texture. I would recommend this recipe to everyone, including a beginning baker because it is so easy to make, and the results are so phenomenal.

I have made this many, many times. Always to wonderful reviews! However, the first time was the only time I used the olives. I didn't feel that it added a whole lot to the overall dish, and since we're on a tight budget, was happy to dismiss the olives.

Wow! What a great focaccia recipe. I had some doubts because the dough was so soft -- but it cam out perfectly! I topped it with some roasted garlic and carmelized shallots in addition to the olives and it was a hit. Great recipe -- definately a keeper

I used four recipies for focaccia that I found at this site, and this one was BY FAR the best. I haave made is several times, each time incorporating some other ingredients such as garlic, dill, sage, sun-dried tomatoes. Each time a distinct hit.

This was the best bread I have ever tasted! I make bread often, and enjoy trying new recipes. But this one has been the best, so far. It had such a nice flavor--maybe the potato? My boyfriend couldn't believe this was homemade.

I noticed that everyone raved about this recipe. I found it too moist, despite cooking it well. Also, it was a bit bland. It was the first time I had made focaccia with potato. For me, I'll go back to an all-flour starch.

Outstanding!

Simple and idiot proof. Increasing the amount of potato by half makes for an exceptionally tender bread. Feel free to experiment with the toppings. This bread is so easy to make, I whip it up on almost any notice... Enjoy

Excellent focaccia! I loved the blend of rosemary and olives - and very easy to make!

Rating: 4
Very easy recipe with beautiful results. You can add almost anything to change it around. I agree on taking it easy on the salt if only using olives. They tend to be pretty salty aready. It's a perfect bread for simple everyday menu's or for entertaining. Either way it will disapear quickly.

An incredibe first time success in bread making, delicious, attractive and with frequent requests for the recipe. I used a little extra flour-3 cups instead on 2 1/2. An all round favorite!.

Great recipe and very easy to prepare! One word of advice,be careful of the salt. The oil packed olives I used with the salt on top mad it a little salty. All in all a great recipe and I will certianly make agian!!!

I've tried several focaccia recipes, and they never come out like the loaves at my gourmet market. This was the best so far, however. Still, it came out too chewy. The crust, in fact, could have been characterized as tough. I will sheepishly admit that I used All-Purpose flour, and would be anxious to hear from others if they thought that was the cause.

This recipe has been a staple in our household since I discovered it. I make it with sliced tomatoes and feta topping. It tastes great as leftovers and is easy to pack for bagged lunches. Guests are always *very* impressed by this bread, especially when the find out it's homemade!

I have made this as the recipe suggests, and also using basil and tomato (and garlic salt and fresh grated mozzarella cheese) and have always had wonderful results. And I only used "All Purpose" flour. This is a great base from which to experiment with focaccia. Go wild, friends.

This recipe is fabulous. Very easy to make since it all goes in the food processor. This was my very first success with bread-making. I also vary the toppings, but the rosemary and (nicoise) olives are wonderful!

This is so good and so easy. I'll be making this again.

This is a very delicious bread. It's a good basic dough which you could add whatever you want to it. It's very soft and airy on the inside and, if you brown it enough, crunchy on the outside. Oh, and most important, it's so easy to make!
