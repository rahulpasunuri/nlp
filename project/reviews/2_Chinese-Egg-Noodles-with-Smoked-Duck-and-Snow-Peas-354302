I don't get the comment about tasting like soy sauce, but to each his own; we found the sauce to be tasteful, and nuanced. Basically I served up a couple of frozen duck hindquarters with 5 spice powder as a main, and the noodle dish as a side. Used Thai rice noodles, and didn't have any cilantro or jalapeño: Even so, the family loved it.

Why is this recipe listed under vegetables when it has MEAT?

Don't bother with this one. It basically tastes like soy sauce. It has some potential if you add more stir-fry ingredients - baby corn, water chestnuts, broccoli.
