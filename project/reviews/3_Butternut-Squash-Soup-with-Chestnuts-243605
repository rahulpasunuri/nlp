This is a smooth soup that is picked up and carried by the chestnuts. One bowl was filling for me, and my foreign guests enjoyed two bowls full.

pureed the chesnuts along with the rest of the soup and then sauteed some kale and pureed that in, too. yum

I have to say, this was weird. If the colors don't match, I find its a clue that the tastes won't, either. (Think cranberries and tomatoes.) The consistency was fine, and it was not vile, but it just does not work. A bad combination.

This is a wonderful version of butternut soup enhanced by the tomatoes. You must use some chicken broth in place of the water.

Really really good! Added just a tablespoon of brown sugar, no chestnuts (too rich already, although I have them on hand). Also, a super dose of anti-oxidants and, without the cream, good for your heart too!

A solid squash soup recipe! The addition of tomatoes isn't immediately apparent in the final product (good), yet produces a much richer taste (great). The chestnuts are an expensive extra that didn't really rock that hard. Definitely expendable, BUT the whipped cream is not. I much prefer it to sour cream or creme fraiche.

After lunching at "Les Cocottes" last week, it was fun to see a recipe inspired by Christian Constant. This is a fabulous soup with very rich ingredients. I roasted the squash, which gave it a slightly sweeter taste and it was a huge hit. We will plan to serve this soup often!!

no way it was watery, did not have enough squash therefore used only 4 cups of water, very tasty

I left out the water altogether and everyone liked it - especially one guest who was nervous about squash soup but very pleasantly surprised by the tomato.

As has been remarked, way too watery. Even skimping a LOT on the water, it was runny. Also, kind of bland. A lot of spices added (including some sour cream, chinese 5 powder, and some brown sugar made it decent. Tomatoes have no business in a squash soup.

This soup was very watery and not flavorful. I could probably make a few changes to improve it but I would prefer to try another recipe altogether.
