I loved this recipe when it first came out but haven't made it in a few years, though it popped into my head today while I was searching for an alternative to pasta or pizza (I live in Italy). To save some time, I used sushi vinegar with a little sesame oil, tamari sauce and mirin. I pretty much stuck to the traditional California roll ingredients, though I did add some shredded carrot. (Annoyingly, in Italy restaurants often add cucumber, salmon, cream cheese, or other wacky stuff to a California roll. My rules say surimi, avocado, rice, and nori only.) Leaving out the surimi is a bit like leaving the ice cream off of a cone.

Good salad. My husband thought it was better than a california roll. I thought it was good...not great. The salad dressing was too salty and watery for me, but I'd make this again, and I do feel you should add the surimi.

Rating: 4
This salad is very popular whenever it is served. I make jasmine rice the usual way, would never use mock crab legs, ramp up the veggies with brightly coloured in-season favourites, and purchase crisp nori snacks to serve on the side. It's very very good the day it is made but after that, not so much.

Rating: 4
Aside from making rice using package directions (Jasmine rice) I followed the recipe as written (without the optional mock crab). Delicious. Even the kids like it. Great for summer picnics and a first course salad or side dish. I used my garlic press to extract juice from ginger root - worked like a charm.

Rating: 4
OMG. This is divine. I left out the rice & the associated prep ingredients because I am stuck on a lo carb diet per dr.'s orders (boo, hiss); added some asian sweet peas from my garden and now I am in heaven. I could sit down and eat the whole bowl. This is the answer to my sushi craving. Thanks epicurious!!

Really good. Hubs liked it & he's not a big rice fan; the rice cooking method made really nice dry fluffy rice. Used many suggestions - that's why I LOVE this site. Makes a lot and only keeps one day at most. Best 1st day. Will definitely make again.

Great and authentic tasting. I liked the fun idea of another reviewer to make the cones of nori. I sued sushi rice and flavored it with sweet syrup and vinegar as well as adding the sesame seeds, toasted.

Delicious salad, but do not make the rice the way it says in the recipe. My kitchen towel ended up catching on fire! I am sure that making the rice the traditional way or in a rice cooker would be much, much safer!

I have been making this dish for a few years, ever since my sister in law recommended it to me. It is one of my all time favorites! Being a sushi lover, the taste of this dish is excellent! Most of the time I don't have the nori, but the dish is fantastic without it anyway. Also, it doesn't really need the dressing. I make this dish all the time as a last minute lunch, or a great side. Anyone who loves california rolls should definitely make this dish!

Rating: 4
This was/is terrific. Also nice that it doesn't have mayo so it is summer/picnic friendly. I've made it once before and well, learned a little something. First, make the rice the best way you know how. Second, the dressing is not needed. I added more cucumber, carrot and avocado than called for and served the pickled ginger on the side along with wasabi paste and soy sauce. I made small cones out of most nori (What else are you going to do with the other 8 sheets in the pckg?) and toasted a couple of sheets to shred on top. Some loved the hand held option while others appreciated having all the flavor of a Cal Roll sans the effort. Sweet Soy Glazed Short Ribs (this site - OMG good) and grilled bok choy rounded out the meal that surprisingly went over big on the 4TH OF JULY! - go figure?! Nobody missed the baked beans if you know what I mean.

Rating: 3
Enjoyed it and got a little too full from stuffing myself! I also used a regular rice cooker and simply tossed the rice with the vinegar mixture. Next time to save on dishes, I'd use the sushi rice powder to save on dishes. I thought the pickled ginger tossed in the dish was weird... in an interesting way. Next time I think I would just keep it lumped and pressed in the salad like a little flower so I would snack on it while eating the course. I reduced amount of scallions and was glad I did. Sesame oil didn't do it for me nor did the korean-style gim (nori). Regular nori next time! I served with miso soup, tak-kwan, and dabbed in a bit of sriracha sauce. I love spicy!

Rating: 4
I live with a big group of people and they all loved this salad. To make it easier I used already toasted sesame seeds; I cooked medium grained rice in the rice cookerl; and I used already toasted nori. I used the Korean type of nori that is toasted in sesame oil - greasy/salty goodness. I served the salad with strips of nori on the side. Then we each made our own sloppy rolls out of the nori and salad. Yum!

My fav! and my version: Omit the ginger juice from the dressing, add Japanese Mayo - 2 TBSP, mix well prior to eating. For really hearty variation, add cubed cheese, and sunny side up egg on top

True to the name, this salad does capture the flavors of california rolls! I can't wait to make this recipe again! Because I don't have a rice cooker, I prepared jasmine rice according to the directions for the stovetop. I also substituted 1 Tbsp fresh ginger for the pickled ginger and used wasabi paste instead of wasabi powder. Delicious!

Rating: 4
Delicious, and very easy to make. The only change I made was to use Jasmine Rice that I cooked in my rice cooker. I also used some sesame oil in place of the vegetable oil and I doubled the amount of surimi. I will definitely make this again.

This salad was delicious - I made it for 15 people with miso soup and it was a perfect combination. It's a bit more work than a usual salad but SO MUCH easier than trying to make maki for 15. I do not recommend making a bunch of this salad to eat as leftovers - it was a bit slimy the next day.

i've been making this "salad" for years, but calling it scrambled sushi roll. i began making it when i was craving california roll, but too lazy to actually make the rolls. (yes, i was always too lazy to steam the rice.) sometimes i'd just throw in some frozen vegetables if thats all i had on hand... didn't really share it with anyone as i thought people would think i was crazy. now i find it in epicurious with rave reviews. who knew? just had to comment.

Rating: 4
I make this dish at least 8 times each summer since 1999; have even won "salad luncheon" contest w/ this recipe (it was a contest among girlfriends)! It is time-consuming, but so worth it in the end. NOTE TO PREGNANT WOMEN: this will satisfy your sushi craving while you're not able to eat sushi/sashimi during pregnancy.

Rating: 4
Gets raves every time I make it. I cook rice the regular way; otherwise I follow it almost to the letter. I like to double the dressing and serve it on the side to let guests drizzle it on individually. Leftovers do not keep but you can set aside some of the rice mixture for the next day then add a fresh set of surimi, avocado, sesame seeds and nori. (If making ahead, don't the sesame seeds in until the last steps.)

I made this for a department potluck-it was a big hit, several peple wanted the recipe. I followed many of the suggestions from previous reviews-thanks to all for the good ideas. I used sushi rice, cooked it normally; found wasabi paste, not powder; and used the juice from the pickled ginger rather than squeezing fresh grated ginger. It was terrific.

To Seattle: PLEASE do not rate recipes with forks if you haven't tried them! This screws up the overall rating for the recipe! If you are just making an observation let it be at that. Thanks. (I happened to make this with Basmati Rice and it was great. We gobbled it up as a main course)

I've made the Shuhi-Roll Rice Salad from Epicurious numerous times to rave reviews. I've never made this one, but I can tell it won't be as good because it calls for long grain rice. You'll have too much of the wrong kind of rice for the salad. And don't bother if you not going use dressing!

Rating: 4
This is unbeleivably good! I've made it several times; I agree that it gets overwhelming if served as a main course. It's better as a side (I served it with salmon). It's also a great dish to take to a party; everyone will want the recipe. I'm curious if anyone has tried the "Sushi Roll Salad" on this site. It seems very similiar - if anyone has tried that one as well, which do you think is better? Thanks

This was just like having a California Roll without all the work. I omitted the oil from the salad, but added some sesame oil to the dressing. I also doubled the amount of avacado. (Hey I am from California!) The whole family loved it!

A good recipe.. tastes very much like a California Roll and is aesthetically pleasing. So I would make it again, but didn't think it met up to the hype of previous reviews. Maybe because I left out the dressing? It is very starchy because of all the rice so have side dishes that compliment it.

Rating: 3
Excellent salad. However, as previous reviewers commented, you kind of get tired of eating it after awhile. Recommend halving it or you'll have lots to throw away. Definitely make it as a side dish to accompany something else like grilled fish.

Another recipe I would never have made with out the reviews. We really enjoyed it with SHELLFISH SKEWERS WITH EQUATORIAL GLAZING AND DIPPING SAUCE from this site. Because it was served with scallops, I omitted the crabmeat.

This is wonderful. I used medium-grain rice and generic products for the ingredients, and it turned out perfectly. Chilling salad overnight enhanced the flavors. Also, treating the avacados with an antioxidant such a lemon juice maintained the green color and kept the salad looking appetizing. Will make this over and over.

I had the dish nearly made, with the nori and other last-minute ingredients sitting on the kitchen counter. I left the room to do something else and when I returned, I found that the cat had jumped up on the counter and scoffed the seaweed! It was in shreds on the floor. Other than that, the dish was fabulous and is now added to our "favorites" list. Next time I'll hide the seaweed.

i made this salad two times in three days. had to fight my boyfriend for the leftovers. i took the advice of another reviewer and used the juice from the pickled ginger in the dressing. i also used black sesame seeds, instead of white, mainly for looks. couldn't find dried nori down here (no big surprise there) and i also used wasabi paste instead of powder and it turned out fine. i think those little orange fish eggs could work well in this salad as well.

Rating: 3
I cooked the rice in a rice cooker to make things easier and it turned out fine. Substituted canned crab meat in place of the surimi and omitted the pickled ginger because I didn't have any. This is a healthy dish which my meat and potatoes husband and 3 year old daughter both enjoyed. Will definitely make it again!

This is a killer salad! I used jasmine rice, and steamed it per the recipe. The only thing I changed on the dressing was using the juice from the pickled ginger instead of grating fresh ginger and squeezing the juice, seems like alot of work. I made a double recipe. I lined a 9" spring form pan with the toasted nori, then filled it with the salad, chilled it over night, then unmolded it and sprinkled more toasted sesame seeds on top. Very cool presentation, looked like a giant California Roll. Recipe was demanded by all the guests. Am thinking that black sesame seeds would give more contrast in future.

This is fantastic! Both kids and adults love it. When it comes to the rice, I've found that using a sushi rice such as Cal Rose cooked in the typical stovetop manner or in a rice cooker makes more of a difference than going to the effort of steaming. Also, a few drops of sesame oil is a nice touch.

Rating: 3
Wow! This is the best "rice salad" I have ever made. We used medium grain rice and I liked its consistency. Also, I couldn't find pickled ginger anywhere, so I used ginger paste from the Indo-Pak store and really liked the result. We are sushi lovers, so I think that next time we will use MORE nori, MORE toasted sesame seeds, and slightly less avocado. Also, serve something else with this salad as it does get monotonous and starchy after a while. Make this immediately! It's sensational.

Being a lover of sushi for over 17 years and "rolling" my own for 6, I have to admit this recipe is wonderful and easy. I definately suggest using the crab meat. Also, I used pre-made washabi as opposed to dry (easier)and added "salmon roe", (large fish eggs) to top off salad before serving! Definately will make again!

My boyfriend didn't think this sounded like a very good recipe before I made it (and he's a hearty eater). But, after tasting it, it immediately became one of his favorites. He asks for it so often that I'm starting to get tired of it. :-) I still have never made it with the wasabi dressing -- it's great without it! Even my family enjoys it and have asked for it at potlucks. (btw, I'm Japanese-American).

This is very tasty - vegetables added nice crunch and seasoning was just right, though I prefer it with less oil. I'm Japanese living in Greece where it is not easy to get special ingredients, but I can find all the ingredients for this. I will make this when I have craving for Japanese flavour. By the way, this is what we call "chirashi-zushi".

We made this just as directed (with imitation crab) and it one of our new favorites. Four stars reserved for only the best, and this is up there. We will be making this plenty during the hot and humid Memphis summer. Will serve with pan seared ( & very rare) sashimi grade tuna along side. Also good with Mango w/ ginger mint syrup (very good, easy and non-fat) also on this site.

This salad is incredible! I love it and will make it again and again. The only thing I do differently to prepare this dish is I wash the rice for 10 min., drain it for 15-20 min and then boil it as usual. This is the way rice is prepared to make sushi to eliminate unwanted starch. Starch affects the texture of the rice and tastes less appetizing.

Unbelievable! A big hit at a recent party, even loved by those that poo-poo sushi! Agree with a previous review to cut back on the green onions. I also added a shredded radish. Go to a Asian market for time-saving items such as pre-roasted seaweed sheets and sesame seeds, and wasabi already made into a paste. And be ready to be asked for the recipe by everyone!

Delicious - don't understand how anyone could find this time-consuming: the rice takes only 20 mins to cook and steam (you can take a shower in the meantime!), then I just put it in the fridge to cool. Whole thing was ready and on the table in 40 minutes. Nice with a bit of non-conventional mayo.

One of the best recipes I've ever made. If you like sushi, you will love this salad -- it tastes just like a California roll. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and cut the scallions back to three instead of four. I agree that they're tasty, but can be overwhelming. Don't skip the sesame seeds or the nori -- they both make this taste really authentic. This did take longer to assemble than I had anticipated -- it has alot of parts -- but it was worth it. Fabulous low fat meal.

Oh wow! We're sushi fanatics and we LOVED this salad. Not that it was any quicker to prepare than real sushi... I love the unorthodox technique for cooking the rice--it worked perfectly. I will make the following changes next time: -less green onion. Last time I checked, there was no green onion in a California Roll. It's nice to have a bit, as this is a salad, but to bite into onion was jarring. -more sesame seeds. -more wasabi in the dressing. 2 tsp. would be fine for pure wasabi, but all I could find was the kind cut with mustard and cornstarch :-( All in all, a delight. Served two, no leftovers!
