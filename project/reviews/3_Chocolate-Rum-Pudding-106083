This recipe was incredibley easy. I used 2% milk instead of whole milk and it came out fine and used vanilla extract for the rum. Delicious. Great for when your home alone and want to indulge yourself but don't want to make anything huge. Wonderfully rich. This recipe could definately played with.

Sorry to be the one lone dissenting voice. But something went seriously wrong. Something separated and created a greasy layer on top. The pudding was creamy and the taste intense. However, that oily layer (I can only assume it had something to do with the cream) was unappetizing. Any suggestions? I could be convinced to give it another try. And I used the best ingredients: Valrhona 85%, Neilsen-Massey vanilla (instead of rum), Medalia D'oro instant espresso.

wonderful! certainly fits the bill for any chocolate cravings! Made for a dinner party and was very easy to adjust the recipe for the 7 servings needed. Used Merckens monopol extra dark chocolate and added strong brewed coffee instead of the espresso granules.

Perfect. Dark and delicious. In case you didn't realize, the pudding is only one serving because in the Gourmet magazine there is always a featured meal plan for one, because not everyone makes desserts for dinner parties only.

This was simple and quick, and absolutely delicious. Made it w/ Scharffen Berger chocolate and the espresso powder, and now I'm afraid I'll have to keep those 2 on hand!

This was very nice. I really like the proportions given, which make it a snap to make as many servings you want -- just multiply the ingredients by however many guests you have (duh).

What kind of stupid recipe is this? who makes pudding by only 1 serving?

I used all of the ingredients, but next time I will mix the whip cream and than fold it into the pudding before it sets up. I think this would give a lighter texture to the pudding and make it a more tasty dessert.
