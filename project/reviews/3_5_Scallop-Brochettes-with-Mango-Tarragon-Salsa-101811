This was so great, I could put this salsa on everything. I usually don't deviate from recipes the first time, but in this case I omitted the bell pepper as I find them the most disgusting food on the planet. I did add avocado, as I know they are great with mango. I did half scallops half shrimp, as I was in the mood for shrimp as well. simply seared them in a pan, served them over some coconut jasmine rice. I will be making this again, and again. I think this would also be nice on chicken, and pork . Another thing I liked about this was it didn't make too much, was just the right amount for the garnish.

I was so disappointed with this recipe. I like all the ingredients but the salsa was blah. Scallops are too expensive to waste on this one.

we used the salsa as a topping for Opah fish rather than scallops and it was perfect!

I was looking for something light and easy to make for dinner, specifically using scallops when I came across this recipe in E's archives. Very, very easy to make, haven't tried this with other seafood yet, but would imagine that this marinade would go well with anything from a light fish like halibut (something that holds up to the grill) to shrimp. It was very delicious, very easy and very impressive. I served this with coconut rice and the combined tastes w/the mango and red bell pepper were wonderful. My boyfriend as well as my guests have raved over it every time I've made this. This is one you'll want to make for a quick light meal as well as for entertaining, it's that simple and that impressive.

Wierd, but very good. Make sure to dice the vegetables very well--too large of chunks clash with the delicate texture of the scallops. --t

Not only is this quick and easy but everyone raved about it! I added fresh mint leaves to the sauce the second time and liked it even better.

Absolutely delicious. Instead of just brushing the dressing on the scallops, I marinated them for 10 minutes. I also used mint instead of tarragon, which gave it a great kick.

I made this recipe as one of three seafood dishes served to a very competitive group in a rotating dinner group. This was incredibly easy to make, very unique and raved about by all. I have made it again since then and will keep it at the top of my list!

Yummy! I loved this dish. I used frozen diced mango which made it even easier and added a little extra juice to the salsa. I will definitely keep this recipe.

This is a summer dish all the way, yet I made it in spring! Wonderful, light, and good for those who are watching their waistline! I added 1 tsp of sugar and cilantro to the dressing and doubled the recipe so I could marinate the scallops. I also used the sauce as dressing on salad. Served it over a bed of brown rice, with salad on side. Wine! A wonderful romantic dinner for two! Will make this again!

Loved it! As always, we grill out seafood with a light sprinkling of wood chips...this time we used a mixture of mesquite, alder and chardonnay chips. We also used a grill basket for the scallops sprayed with PAM and had no trouble with them sticking. The salsa is great!! My husband really liked it!

We made this for Father's Day and it was a big hit. Even tripling the recipe it was super fast and easy to make (as long as you make the salsa with the aid of a food processor).

The mango-onion-bellpepper salsa is a summery and lovely. The sea scallops seem to lack the flavor of their smaller brethren so be sure to season the shellfish adequately. Best to use a special grill accessory as to prevent the scallops from sticking and pulling off skewar. Simple and good dish!
