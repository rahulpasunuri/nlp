I've made this recipe (exactly) numerous times and it always turns out very good. Tonight, however, I tried some variations and found it bland and boring. First, I didn't use deboned chicken breasts with the skin. Instead, I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and cute it into bite sized pieces, as suggested by other reviewers. Next, I added paprika to the chicken (I didn't have any chili powder as suggested). Finally, I added lime juice to the mango mixture. All I know is that this was NOT as good as the original recipe. I highly recommend the dish the way the recipe is written, I didn't enjoy my variations on it.

This recipe is easy to do, but I upped the amount of fresh ginger by 1/2, and I thought the pineapple gave it more flavor than the mango, though both were good. It's subtle, quick and was praised by my guests.

I'm going to try it with pineapple. My 'foodie' family loved it, but I thought the taste was good but not great; too bland.

This recipe is phenomenal, especially given the ease. Complex, gorgeous flavours. I use slightly less vinegar (maybe 2/3 or a bit over) since it comes out a little strong, but otherwise this has been a favourite for years at my home.

I was pleasantly surprised by this dish. I wasn't sure about it, but I gave it a try and yum! I did add serano peppers to the mango mixture. I served the whole deal over soba noodles.

Well I started to make this but had to heavily modify it considering I lacked key ingredients (cilantro, white wine, and mango). I sautéed some chopped onion and cracked red pepper to spice it up. I used 1+ tsp rice wine vinegar instead of the recommended. I thought I made a big mistake in making this considering the cilantro I planned on using was bad (therefore left out), but my boyfriend and I actually enjoyed it a lot! So I leave no forks, but I rate my version a 3/4. :)

My husband and I really liked this. I grilled the chicken breasts with salt, pepper and chili powder. I didn't have fresh ginger so I used some ground ginger and I substituted seasoned rice wine vinegar for the white wine vinegar. The warm mango sauce was complex (in a good way) for something with so few ingredients.

I added diced white onions and red peppers with the garlic and ginger and it was fabulous! I made it for a friend who thought it was excellent and am making it again for my parents!

I dredged the chicken in flour, salt and pepper as well. I served it with chayote squash and coconut rice as suggested, and the meal was wonderful! My boyfriend and I both loved it!

I took liberties as well. Dredge the chicken in flour with chipotle powder. Saute in pan and remove. Then add white balsamic, chicken stock and the other ingredients, reduce and add mango. Then add the chicken back in for a few minutes. Serve with mixed greens with grilled peppers and beets. Even my picky eater devours this.

I used candied ginger, balsamic vinegar and sauteed the chicken breasts instead of broiling. It turned out nice and I would definitely make again. Very quick and easy.

I added curry powder to this recipe and a couple of serrano chiles (the only kind I had on hand) and it came out very tasty. Without the additions, it wasn't spicy enough.

i took some liberties with this recipe, but was very satisfied with the way things turned out. to begin with, i used a whole chicken, which i seasoned with salt & pepper before sticking into the oven to broil. while it was broiling, i combined the mango pieces, crushes cloves of garlic, minced ginger, lime juice (great tip!), olive oil - and a (whole) red chili pepper in a saucepan and heated everything over a low heat, allowing the flavors of the individual ingredients to unfold and blend. when the chicken was almost done, i topped it with the mango mixture, basting regularly to ensure crunchy skin on the chicken. i served the chicken topped with the spicy-fruity mango mixture along with saffron risotto. my daughter - a finicky eater at the best of times - just loved it, and so did i. i will certainly enjoy experimenting more with this recipe until i get it 'just right' according to my personal taste!

Fabulous! The boyfriend loved it, though it's hard for him to confess a love for a chicken dish.

After watching my Mexican flatmate nibbling the mango seed dipped in cayenne (her prize for playing sous chef), I sprinkled some on the chicken breasts before broiling. I feel like this added dimension is needed to elevate this dish from ok to refreshing. Lime juice, suggested below, might help too. This is asimple, healthy, lovely weeknight supper, and has revived my interest in fruit salsas!

Very simple and nice. I stir fried the chicken like previous people. I marinated it in soy sauce, ginger, garlic & red chile paste. I served it with coconut rice (also on this site). I also halved the vineager and next time I will add lime juice.

Great recipe although I must admit that I did modify it quite a bit. Will definately make it again soon! First I took the advice of the reviewer who cut his chicken into bite size pieces. I had some sauce left over from a chicken dish a couple of days ago that was a garlic/ginger/corn starch/broth/soy reduction. I marinated the chicken in this for about 15 minutes. I then stir fried it quickly and set it aside. Then I stir fried onions, mushrooms, zucchini and yellow & red peppers also with a little of the sauce. I prepared the mango as called for except adding only 1 tsp of vinegar and I substituted Thai basil instead of the coriander. I then mixed everything together and served it with jasmine rice. It was awesome! Because of the marinade with the soy & cornstarch, the chicken practically melted in your mouth. I particularily liked the garlic/ginger mango combo. Can't wait to make this again soon.

I was amazed at how good this dish turned out! It took no time at all to prepare (especially if you ask the butcher to debone your chicken breast) and I felt like I was eating a gourmet meal!

Delicious! I followed a previous reviewer's suggestions and cut the chicken into bite-size pieces, added black bean+garlic sauce and chili paste, then stir-fried it. Added snow peas, carrots+zucchini. Used only 1/2 the amt of vinegar. The sweetness of the mango really complemented the spiciness of the asian sauces.

I added Cayanne pepper to this recipe and it really added a lot of kick.

I loved this! I reduced the vinegar slightly then served it with a cumin and red bell pepper pilaf and the flavors complimented each other perfectly. Definitely will make it again for company.

Not too sweet or over whelming in flavors. Accents simply made chicken very well. A food processor would cut the prep time by half.

What were you thinking of adding all that vinegar to this recipe. I would consider ommitting it altogether, but at most a teaspoonful should be adequate.Otherwise the recipe is very easy and is wonderfully colorful. I served it with a creamed chayote wiuth chopped chives.

This was a very nice recipe with what I had on hand (no mango chutney). My fresh ginger was frozen, and so the mango sauce didn't have pizazz. I grilled the pounded chicken - and that worked very nicely.

Delicious flavors, though I changed the method because people were coming over and I didn't want to heat up the apartment with the broiler. I used 5 boneless skinless chicken breasts, sliced into bite-size pieces, mixed with about 3 T oyster sauce and 2 T chilli sauce, then stir-fried the chicken in a wok. next I stir-fried slivered snow peas, and removed and added to the chicken. finally I stir-fried a double-batch of the mango mixture, and mixed it with cilantro and finely chopped green scallions along with the vinegar (rice wine) off the heat. Stir everything together in a big bowl and serve with sticky rice. Really nice!
