This recipe would be better if there wasn't so much milk in it. Other than that, this is a nice recipe, especially for me. I just got braces put on yesterday and it goes down nice and smooth :]

My sister gave my my mother a fortune plant with small berry like fruits . Does someone know what variety is this? It might be a pachira but I don't know if pachiras have that tiny red berry like fruits. The plant did not have the fruits anymore. Will it still produce the little berry-like fruits?
