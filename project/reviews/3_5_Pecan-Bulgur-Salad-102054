This dish is perfect for potlucks. I don't serve it on greens, and reduce the cayenne to 1/4 tsp. Its hearty grain and delicate flavors comprise a dish that's a family favorite.

This made me want to sing, it was so good. I did not use tomato or cucumber, but served on a small bed of baby greens with blanched broccoli. Guests described it as "light but hardy" and delicious, of course. Unless you like things really tart, I would cut back the lemon juice to between 1 T and 2.

LOVED this salad, it is so fragrant and delicious! Great take-to-work meal as there is no warming/refrigeration needed. Will reduce the cayenne to 1/4 tsp next time I make dressing.

I used a bit less Cayanne pepper, and would not bother with the greens next time. We REALLY enjoyed it.

This was OK, but the spices were too overpowering for me. All I tasted was the cinnamon and cumin.

This salad is attractive, fast, easy, and most important ... delicious! I felt that the cayenne flavor (I used a little over 1/4 teaspoon) was too prominent, so I'll cut it back to 1/8 teaspoon the next time I make this salad. The two-serving size of the recipe is very convenient for small families. I highly recommend this salad, and will be making it over and over again!

This was very good, an interesting blend of flavors. I served this for lunch with the Southwestern Pumpkin soup. They went together nicely.

Another wonderful vegetarian, healthy and very tasty recipe. It has a little zip to it - not a dull bulgar salad.
