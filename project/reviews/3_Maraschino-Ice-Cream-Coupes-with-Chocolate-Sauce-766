for those seeking maraschino liqueur, an inexpensive version is made by Stock, so if your local liquor store carries Stock products, they may be able to order maraschino for you. If not, Kirschwasser can be substituted.

This recipe was not difficult, but allow yourself some time to make it in advance. I made it the day of my dinner party, and there really wasn't enough time for the ice cream and chocolate to freeze well between stages. I could tell the dessert would have been more spectacular if more frozen. Even mushy, the flavors were great. I used raspberry liqueur instead of maraschino, which was fine, but I think that distinctive maraschino taste will make it even better, when I try it again.

I have made this dessert several times over the years. While it is a bit of effort, having it ready ahead of time is convenient. Maraschino cherry liqueur can be hard to find, so one could substitute chocolate liqueur or another appropriate flavor. We like it!
