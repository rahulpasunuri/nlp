Based on the recommendations other reviewers have made, I added crushed garlic, salt and pepper to the grated potatoes. It came out wonderfully! Since this is like an upscale version of hash browns, I had it for breakfast with some halved cherry tomatoes on the side - delightful!

So far my most successful attempt at potato pancakes, though I still had trouble getting them quite as crispy as I would like.

Delicious! Even better with garlic and minced onions.

My husband and I enjoyed the dish .... I substituted Port Salut cheese in one version and smoked Gouda in another. Port Salut was the favorite. No added seasoning really needed. Also, grate/towel the potato right before cooking.

This is really a fantastic recipe. Its tasty and very quick and easy to prepare. The potatoes definitely need a little seasoning (onion and garlic are nice additions), but the dish is a great accompaniment to many entrees. Its a nice change from regular potatoes or rice.

I have been doing something similar for years, but to add cheese made this just a little different. I did add sauteed onion and garlic to the mixture and lots of salt and pepper. It was devine!!!

A friend made this for supper club. Delicious. Not as rich as you'd think, the gruyere is subtle. Needed salt and pepper but thats it. Nice accompanied with Garlic Lime Pork Tenderloin with Onion Marmalade.

Really yummy and very easy -- especially when I can get my husband to grate the potatoes. Would be good for brunch.

Very simple to make and it's a nice change of pace as a potato side dish. Used swiss cheese (didn't have gruyere on hand) and it turned out fine but I can see that gruyere would make it just that much better.

This is one of my favorite potato recipes. So easy and yet so full of flavor! Goes great with a steak on the grill. We have tried other cheeses, but nothing compares with the great taste of Gruyere. If you like Gruyere, you'll love this recipe.
