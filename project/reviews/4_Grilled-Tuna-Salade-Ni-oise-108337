Made this salad for our office lunch, using grilled salmon instead of tuna...Although the salad and fish were a huge hit, the dressing received RAVE reviews. Ended up having to make a ball jar full of it the following day for leftovers...didn't have the anchovy paste or fresh thyme in the office pantry (we're foodies), but it was still a massive hit.

Made this last night and it was wonderful!! Even my husband loved it and he's not a big fan of salads. I added about 1/2 tsp more dijon as I felt the dressing lacked kick and I just seared the tuna, did not cook it through. Will definitely make this again. Presentation is beautiful - would be great for a luncheon or summer dinner.

Best dressing I have ever had. Loved it. I made it according to the recipe, oil and all. This is now my husband's favorite salad. He said he could eat it every night. So could I, if tuna were always available here! :)

As others have previously stated, this is an excellent recipe. The dressing is super and completes the salad.Not as good as the several I had in Paris, but pretty darn close. Maybe it is because I'm not a culinary chef by trade,

There is really only one problem with this recipe. After making it, you most likely will never enjoy the Nicoise salad served in restaurants. Even in France, only one time out of 10 did I get something even close to this recipe. Make it as written and either eat as a main course or as an appetizer for 6 - 8 people.

Nothing could be easier than this great salad, prepped and ready to assemble as the tuna grills. The dressing is over- the-top with flavor! I too reduced the amount of olive oil (tasted as I went. The presentation is lovely and guests always enjoy. And the cook has time to enjoy her/his guests!

Delicious! I used young green beans from my garden and tiny red potatoes that I cooked last night. I made the dressing without change and now have a jar of very yummy leftover salad dressing in the fridge!

Absolutely amazing. Forgot the olives, bailed on the egg and still it was the yummiest salad I've had in years. Everyone swooned, licked their plates. Plated it in layers, rather than "sections" and it was beautiful. Can't wait to make it again...and again.

Unbelivebale Good!!!!

This was delicious. I agree that 1 c of oil is too much and I used 3/4 instead. I also added fresh tarragon to the dressing. Fresh herbs are very important to this dish. Agree that the timings to cook the tuna are WAY too long and will ruin a good piece of fish. It should be done no more than medium, if it's really fresh of course. I am sending this to all my friends this morning. The presentation is beautiful and it is very easy to make.

I've made a lot of Salade Nicoise over the years, but this dressing is absolutely the best. My husband is not an anchovy fan and using the paste managed to please both of us! Hit the local farmer's market that morning and picked up green beans, tomatoes, potatoes, herbs and organic eggs. The arugula was too good to pass up and I actually found the peppery taste delicious with the tuna. This is absolutely my "go to" recipe from now on!!

An exceptional Nicoise. But six servings, really? I'm going to get 8 out of it; it makes a lot of food. I followed the recipe as closely as I could but was forced to use dried basil and thyme; but because I made the dressing a day ahead, the herbs had time to soften and mellow, so it worked out okay. Unlike many other reviewers, I didn't cut the amount of oil, but I also didn't come close to using all the dressing. Which was good, because the dressing is fab and I can use the leftovers on other food.

I made this salad on a weeknight. With all the components, it might have been a little more complicated than what I normally look for--but COMPLETELY worth it! A perfect dish for a hearty, but still fresh-tasting meal. I also didn't think the whole amount of olive oil was necessary, but I like a little more vinegar in my vinaigrette than most recipes call for anyways. YUM!

I made this salad last night-it was amazing! I followed recipe instructions very closely and evrything was perfect. I grilled yellowfin tuna on the grill pan on moderate heat to medium-well-my family likes it this way, although personally i prefer seared tuna, but the steaks were thick, so it did not overcook. I think i will try the dressing with lamb or beef also.

Choose this salad because so much could be prepared ahead of time. It was perfect. Easy to pull together for a wonderful holiday get together with friends. Plus a delightful meal during a time when so many others are so heavy and not exactly healthy.

This was delicious. Well worth the small extra effort. I confess that i halved the oil and vinegar, and kept other ingredients the same. Also, I didn't have anchovy paste so substituted canned tuna. Still, it was terrific. Next time I will use the anchovies and expect even more spectacular results.

Rating: 4
The dressing for this nicoise is absolutely amazing. I'm not always a great fan of anchovies, but this was seriously the bomb! I would eat this every day if I could. By following the directions, we overcooked the tuna, so it wasn't seared but rather cooked through and through, which was too bad. I think that the time indicated was way too long for a true sear on a gas grill, so my word of advice is to vigilantly watch the tuna, and not just follow the timing specified.

This was a big hit at a Sunday brunch for my girlfriends. They wanted to drink the dressing straight.

Good basic recipe. Best to use good quality ingredients for the dressing. I think grilling the tuna 6 to 8 minutes is too long. I grilled mine (fresh yellowfin) 4 minutes total, and it was well done. The dressing is fine as is, but I increased the mustard (used a coarse-grained English-style), and herbs, and added agenerous amount of salt and pepper.

Loved this recipe. The dressing was a great accent to all the fresh favors on the plate. I was lucky enough to get everything organic at a local market(love the summer season)...

I usually do not like making salads - there is no glory in it. This is the most glorious salad I have ever made. I seared sushi quality ahi tuna and substituted fish sauce for anchovie paste and only used 1/2 cup OO. The dressing is INSANELY good. Will make this the next time we entertain, it will wow a crowd and you can easily make it ahead.

This salsd is so fresh tasting and delicious. I followed the recipe to a T and wouldn't change a thing. I used frozen ahi tuna steaks purchased at Costco to bring down the cost. The presentation looks just like the picture and is very attractive and colorful. Try this sald- you will love it!

I have never reviewed anything on any website ever but this salad was so FANTASTIC that I have to. I even used canned tuna in oil and it was amazing. I didn't use any lettuce either. Try it, it is absolutely delish.

We've made this recipe several times and it's been great every time. I would rate it a 3.5, but that's not an option. Used asparagus instead of green beans and it was very good. One change we made was to use half the oil and it was delicious anyway.

I have made this many times to rave reviews. We entertained friends visiting from France and they proclaimed it the best salad nicoise they had ever had. I also decrease the olive oil somewhat, but other than that, I follow the recipe. It is a beautiful presentation.

I have made this recipe many time and finally decided to review it. This is a versatile recipe. I have made it with steak and chicken breast in addition to the tuna (don't eliminate the tuna cuz it's wonderful) It all tasted great with the dressing; my guests always love it. I don't think it is difficult to make and not too time consuming for such a great entre.

Made it as presented, and it was wonderful.

This dish can take a while to prepare but well worth the prep time. Also, most of it can be made in advance which makes it an ideal dish for entertaining. We often substitute or add things - like fresh beets, asparagus or whatever is on hand and fresh. As others have mentioned, the presentation is classy and the overall taste is yummy and healthy. It's hard to feel guilty going back for seconds...or thirds.

The dressing is the BOMB!! If my boyfriend wasn't watching I might have just eaten it with a spoon. I took the suggestion to reduce the amt of OO.

I used salmon instead of tuna since my local grocery store didn't have tuna today. The dressing and capers still went very well. I used less oil (1/4 cup to start), but blended the dressing in the blender. It made for a very thick dressing, more like a spread, so I had to add more oil. I also added a fresh radish sliced for crunch. Very yummy!

Rating: 4
Excellent! Used a grill pan instead of outdoor and turned out perfect. I halved the recipe and used a quarter the amount of oil. We had enough dressing and it made a ton. Served with toasted pita bread for a summer dinner.

this is absolutely terrific - except i used only 1/4 cup of really good olive oil and nearly doubled the dressing - (who needs all the extra calories even in a good oil?) and i also added an avocado just because i had one around.

This dish is a new favorite for my husband and me -- simple, healthy, flavorful, and a treat for the eye. It's perfect as a light meal. For heartier appetites, or as a meal for company, I would recommend serving a soup to start, along with some fresh bread or bruschetta. Successful substitutions: fresh asparagus for green beans; dried basil and thyme (1/2 recipe amount) for fresh.

This was SO GOOD and not that hard to make. the dressing is incredible. I used about 1/2 cup of oil. I used asparagus instead of green beans, and no eggs. delicious, nice presentation, very impressive and healthy.

I made this for lunch on a weekend when my husband and I played in a golf tournament. After a long morning of golf, I entertained two other couples and this recipe received rave reviews. The best part is I prepared almost all of it in advance. While my husband grilled the tuna I finished the dressing, arranged the platter and set the table. My only change was to use Romaine instead of Boston lettuce. The presentation was beautiful and there was not one morsel left. I'll make this again and again!

Rating: 4
My secret to making this the best ever Nicoise is to first make a big pan of roasted Roemary potatoes using new crop heirloom spuds. Use these leftover spuds for this recipe and your family will go bonkers! Avoid canned tuna whenever possible. It's worth it.

Loved this recipe! It has become a once a month staple and there is so much you can add. . . whatever is I've also used canned tuna or salmon from Costco. in the vegetable bin or better yet, canned items such as artichokes, beets or Asian corn.

This recipe was excellent! I cut back the oil to 1/2 cup as suggested. My guests LOVED it. There were only 4 of us but the platter was clean when we were done! A keeper.

This is the best recipe for Nicoise salad that I have come across. The dressing is what really did it for me...just perfect. I used peruvian purple potatoes which made the presentation so beautiful! This is salad perfection.

I made this salad for a med-week dinner party. I made many parts in advance- boiled potatoes (skin-on), dressing, eggs and prepped the beans. The electricity went out just after I boiled the beans, but it went off without a hitch! I used canned tuna and skipped the anchovy paste, because I am a vegetarian, but gave some guests the option of tuna on 1 of the platters.

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe that adapts well to substitutions. I used leftover grilled salmon and asparagus instead of tuna and green beans. I also cut the oil in the dressing to 3/4 cup. At the last minute I discovered my garlic had gone bad, so I had to proceed without it -- next time it'll be even better!

Rating: 4
I could not believe that I have never reviewed this recipe, because I have made it many time for guests and it is always a huge hit! The presentation is beyond compare (even better than the picture on the website) and the flavors are out of this world. I agree with a previous reviewer, you can cut the oil some to increase the potency and flavor of the dressing. Serve it on a big white platter. Everyone who eats this wants the recipe. I like to mix the olives, because we love picholines. I don't give many 4 forks, but this is a definite 4!

Best Nicoise ever. Excellent dressing.

This is a perfect salad. For me, it's the oil-cured olives that make it, along with the dressing. Since I like strong flavors, I used 1/2 cup oil in the dressing instead of a whole cup, and it was delicious!

Awesome is all I can say about this recipe. I didn't change a thing. I used the best Sushi Grade Tuna I could find and mostly fresh ingredients from the local farmers market (with a few store bought things I coundn't find). Used my own home grown herbs as well. The guests included good friends one who is the Executive Chef at a high end Milwaukee french restaurant. He worked as my Sous Chef (jokingly but I learned a lot). He said it was the best Salad Nicoise he had ever had and commented how he liked how everything was touched with the sauce - made sure to take the recipe. This is labor intesive but well worth it if you want to impress.

I've made this recipe many times and it's always a hit. I make a few changes: I use lemon juice in the dressing instead of vinegar - this makes it a little more wine friendly. I crust the tuna with fresh pepper and a tsp of lavendar flowers (be sure they are food grade) to give it more of that provencal flavor. This goes well with a nice velvety pinot noir.

I've made this salad as a main dish for several occasions, and every time it has been a smashing success! With a little crusty bread, it is all you need for a wonderful summer meal! It does take a while to get all of the components ready to serve, but is well worth it! I've also served with grilled chicken as an option for non-tuna eating friends. Just a wonderful salad!

Have made this 3 or 4 times - 1st time exactly as written, except with about half the oil in dressing. Tonight, an incredible yellow fin tuna that worked in spite of the rain (we used a grill pan on top of the stove) This dressing is so incredible - just make it for all your greens!!!

Really great recipe. Flavors of the dressing are perfect and do not overwhelm the main ingredients. My picky husband loved it.

I actually tasted this salad from one of my friends dinners and it was FABULOUS! She rarely cooks, and does not like to cook anything that is really extensive, so, she improvised this recipe and it still tasted Great! Instead of grilled tuna, she used half a can of regular tuna. No shallots or anchovy paste, used regular basil and thyme seasoning, no capers and she added chopped artichoke hearts. In addition, for those that need some carb, she had a bowl of white rice with seasoned sesame seeds on top. Really a treat, and so Delicious! Very very super healthy! Definately a keeper! and with these substitutes, you cut the prep time in half. I would reccommend this to everyone!

The dressing is excellent and I could see it used over any of each element of a salade nicoise such as a hot potato salad, or grilled tuna or crisp (hot, warm or cold) green beans. I must admit that it was a lot of work as this salad was just one of several I prepared for a salad buffet. Next time, I'll stick to preparing this one exclusively.

A great recipe! The dressing made the salad. You definitly need the anchovy paste for the unique flavor. We didn't have much time so we used canned tuna and dried herbs, but it was still mighty tasty.

this is an awesome recipe. i used small red potatoes instead of yukon gold. i also seared the tuna in a cast iron skillet only 2 minutes per side (we like rare). i then sealed it in a plastic bag and immersed in ice water to stop the cooking process. when ready to served i sliced the tuna across the grain about a 1/2" slice and arranged everything seperately on a platter with the dressing on the side. everyone loved it!

This is an excellent recipe for a salad Nicoise. The only change I made was to use a canned Italian tuna instead of grilling fresh tuna. That is, after all, the traditional ingredient. I know using fresh tuna has become popular but this is such a lovely summer salad either way.

Made this on the weekend for guests - it was great. Nice presentation for a small group and got rave reviews.
