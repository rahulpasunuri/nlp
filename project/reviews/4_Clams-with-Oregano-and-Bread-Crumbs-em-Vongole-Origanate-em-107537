If you're not experienced shucking oysters, this will be challenging as clams are more difficult. The other reviews are correct in that the smaller clams get lost under the topping, and I was very conservative with the topping. Although the topping was tasty, it was not fabulous and I think unless you have large clams (like at least 2"), the payoff is not worth the effort.

Excellent! We prepared the Seven fishes menu for our Italian Christmas Eve menu. The only thing we changed about this was that we piled the bread crumbs on high, and didn't mess around with that salt blanket.

Excellent recipe that is all about the clams. The topping is light and very fresh tasting and does not overwhelm the clams. Delicious and will be a staple of my Christmas Eve menu.

This is a very good recipe. Be sure to make fresh bread crumbs from a high quality, dense bread. I think the two keys to this recipe are the fresh oregano (a greatly under appreciated herb) and the clam liquor. If dried oregano were used, it would take on a more predictable "typically Italian" flavor, with less subtlety. Be sure to add the liquid to the crumbs at the very last second. I didn't have proportion problems, and used small to medium sized clams.

This is a very good recipe. Do not skimp and use prepared bread crumbs, not matter the quality you think you have on the shelf. I also think that fresh oregano is a key - if you use dried, I suspect this would become a more heavy- handed and traditional, expected Italian taste. The delicacy of fresh oregano, a greatly underused herb, is what makes this dish to me. The other key is to use the clam liquor in the breadcrumbs, but be sure to do so at the very last minute. I dind't have any problems with proportions and amount of mixture, and was using pretty small clams. Final tip - if you loosen the clam meat from the shell before adding the breading and coooking, you allow your eaters to just slide the whole thing off the shell in one swoop.

I dunno - I wasn't thrilled, but my guests were very impressed. The clams were really hard to open, so I steamed them first & actually like the steamed ones better than the raw ones. I thought I had gotten medium sized clams, but they were so small that I used only half of the breadcrumb mixture, and even then I didn't follow the recipe & shoved each shell full of crumbs. Next time (if there is a next time) I would make only 1/2 the breadcrumb mixture, get big clams, and head the advice to not overstuff the shells.

Tremendous and not too difficult or time consuming. These have become part of our annual New Year's Eve party. Put the clams in the freezer for about 15 minutes to help open them. I only had access to Manila clams... a bit small, but still tasty.
