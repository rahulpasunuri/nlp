I read most of the other reviews; I only used 1 tbs of the corn syrup, and added an additional 1/4 cup whole milk and 1/4 cup cream after the custard cooled. It's soooo good!

I made a deep caramel, I added it to a custard that I thickened to a precise 175 degrees and then strained through my finest sieve. I cooled it in a metal bowl over an ice bath, then moved the chilled custard to the fridge overnight to temper. The next night, I hauled out the trusty Cuisinart ice-cream maker, and poured in the custard to freeze during dinner. You can imagine my disappointment when I peeked into the freezer bowl 30 minutes later and found nothing more than some very chilly custard. I let it keep on spinning for another half hour, until the chiller bowl started to be not very chilly. I spatulad the whole thing back into the storage container, and vowed to try again tomorrow. Two nights ago, I tried it again, with identical results. I decided that this was as frozen as it would get in the ice-cream maker, scraped the contents into the storage container, and put it into the freezer to try and firm it up. Last night: Ta-dah! It wasn't really ice cream, but it definitely was frozen to a desserty consistency.

I didn't have a problem melting the sugar because I just kept my eye on it. I liked how rich it was, and I drink water with ice cream every time, so I had no problem doing that with this one. It had the consistency and intensity of flavor I think lacks in store-bought ice cream, so I was very pleased with this. It doesn't make very much though, so at least double the recipe, but you'll only be able to eat a little at a time, so that might not be such a bad idea to not make very much.

I didn't have any problems making this recipe. It took a long time, but it was worth the effort. I trippled the recipe and added instant espresso and turned it into coffee ice cream. It was the hit of a party.

Like others, I couldn't get this to set up properly in the machine, and now it's in the process of not freezing properly in the freezer. I'm very disappointed because sugar, six egg yolksw and a cup of cream are expensive ingredients to waste, and now I'm going to have to risk them again to see if I can get this to work. I almost burned the sugar because the magazine's times were switched and I had my back turned, but I should have figured that out beforehand since I've never gotten an egg-cream mixture to thicken in three minutes. Too bad... I'd love to know what it tastes like as honest-to-goodness ice cream.

The first time I made it, it was perfect. I made it again and it refused to set up properly. The first time I made it I used all cream. Is this why it worked the first time and not the second time? I'm going to make it one more time to see what happens. I use a Cuisinart professional ice cream maker with a built-in compressor so the machine is not the problem. Also, I WILL NOT stir the sugar while it is melting. That only creates globs of sugar that take forever to melt. Much simpler to just let it melt slowly and over low heat, undisturbed, until it has turned a golden aramel colour. If it gets any darker than that, it will have a burnt taste to it.

Didn't like the flavour. Didn't set well (unfortunately I hadn't read others' comments so hadn't made the recommended adjustments).

Walk away from this one! How do you make this without vitrifying the sugar? This was the pits! I tried it three times at different temperatures and each time burned the sugar. The recipe sounded so good but it was only a recipe for disaster and wasted sugar. Now how do I get this brown solid out of my pots and pans? The only explanation for this is that Grandpa Roy owns stock in a sugar company.

I posted earlier about it not setting up. I read the other posts, and some people seem to be implying that the corn syrup is the problem. Since I'm making it again this weekend, I think I'll leave the corn syrup out and see if that solves the problem. But I'm curious... what purpose does that corn syryp serve in this recipe, anyway? Why would it be needed in the first place?

I'm so glad it wasn't just me that had trouble getting this recipe to set up. I suspected the corn syrup, and am now convinced. I'll reduce it next time and try it again.

Agree w/2 previous reviewers. Time was definately wrong for the first step. Had to throw away the first batch due to burnt caramel. Also agree that it didn't set up well at all. This was very very sweet. More like caramel sauce than ice cream. Served w/Mexican Chocolate Brownies topped with raspberries,which was a good idea.

The times are transposed in the recipe. It should take about 3 minutes to get the sugar to a deep gold, but 12 - 15 minutes to get it to reach 175 degrees. Also, "deep golden" caramel seems a little dark. I'd only boil it to a medium golden next time, as it continues to cook during preparation and over-cooked caramel leaves a burnt aftertaste. It was okay, very rich (that's a plus) but lacking complexity...even with the salt.

Nice but very intense carmel/butterscotch flavor. However, it didn't set up very well and it took over 20 minutes to get to 175 deg, rather than the 3 they suggest. Almost too sweet--the kind when you get really thirsty after you eat.

Very tasty and rich. I'll probably leave out or use less corn syrup, as the ice cream never really set up -- it stayed too syruppy.

I love Grandpa Roy and his ice cream! Thank you for sharing the recipe as it is very special and I feel honored that you shared it. I followed the recipe as written and had no problems freezing. The texture was so smooth...YUM! This was my first time making home made ice cream and this was a pleasant suprise.

This had wonderful flavor, but for some reason, it didn't really freeze. It just wouldn't firm up. I've used my ice cream maker before, so it's not the machine. I followed the recipe exactly. I would love to hear from anyone who has any ideas about why it didn't freeze, as the flavor was so remarkable that I'd love to be able to make it again. Please feel free to share your ideas about this at terripinder@comcast.net. Thanks.

Unfortunately, I had a little trouble with the recipe. Either something is wrong with my burner or the times are way off. 10-12 minutes was way too long and burned the sugar. Also, it took a lot more than 3 minutes to thicken. I will definitely make this again, though, because the resulting custard has a great, creamy texture and it would be excellent if not for the bitter aftertaste.

Absolutely delectable!

This is amazing ice cream. I didn't have full fat milk so used 10% cream along with the whipping cream. As the previous reviewer noted, if you like rich ice cream, this recipe is for you!

If you like rich desserts, this is for you. This is by far the most decadent ice cream I've ever made. And considering it doesn't have chocolate in it, that's saying something! It may even be too rich for some, but I loved it. This ice cream would be a great winter dessert served with a molten chocolate lava cake or in a coffee drink. Mmmmm!
