Simply delicious! Was a great side for a quick evening meal and a great use for excess tomatoes!

We really enjoyed this recipe. It's easy to make, tastes great, and is a great way to use those fresh garden tomatoes. Since it was the end of the season, I had only smaller ones left so I had to use more, but they were nice and ripe, and by slicing them 1/2 inch thick, they worked out just fine.

If you're looking for a broiled tomato dish that doesn't have either breadcrumbs or cheese, this is it.

I made this with grape tomatoes, and it came out very well; the kalamata olives were a good contrast to the tomatoes.
