I threw this together based on what I had in my fridge and it was great! I'd serve this to guests in a heartbeat and I esp. love that it's "no cook." I did a half of a chubby cucumber, de-seeded and peeled, 1/2 of a small white onion, and two medium sized, slightly over-ripe avocados. Liquid was juice from one small lemon, 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth and 1 cup low-fat buttermilk. For seasoning I added about a 1/2 tsp cumin and a 1/4 tsp coriander, plus about 1 tsp of salt . I had to also add about 1/4 cup water. I really liked the more avocado-heavy flavor and the punch from the extra spices of mine, although I do think I could have added more cucumber.

a refreshing, rich starter to a grilled summer meal. If it seems to thick, as some have said, add some skim milk to get your desired consistensy. Delicious!

It was not very good at all.

Followed the recipe exactly (California avocado and all). Served this to 12 people tonight and nobody liked it. Too thick, rich and tart.

Ooo. Not good. This was like a sour cream-based dip in a bowl. Way too thick (even after the addition of more liquid than called for) and way too sour, even after trying to doctor it with sugar. My boyfriend, who will eat anything, turned this away. Only good thing about it was the pretty, pale green color.

Wow, what a fantastic summer soup. I had an avocado half, and one cucumber in my refrigerator that needed to be used. I cut the recipe in half, and I substituted the buttermilk with 1/3c fat free plain yogurt plus skim milk to equal 1/2 cup, took other reviewer's advice and added cayenne, s&p. Delicious! Would be great starter to a dinner party.

So good, so easy. Added a touch of cayenne. Made it in 5 minutes flat.

Great base recipe to make your own. Used 1.5 cukes as part of the soup, needed a little salt & pepper. Topped each guests bowl with: remaining cukes, finely chopped green onion and little drop of sour cream. Summery, delicious and refreshing! Next time I'll add fresh cilantro in the soup and use lime instead. Added presentation touch: place a thin slice of lemon or lime on the rim of the soup bowl.

Very good, refreshing soup, perfect for a warm summer supper. I agree with previous reviewers, one cucumber is enough.

A nice first course that doesn't require tons of ingredients. One cucumber was fine in the soup.. just depends how much you need to make your garnish. Very refreshing!

Heeding advice of other reviewers, I cut down the cucumber to just one, medium-to-large cuke; upped the cumin (to a whole teaspoon, as we like cumin), and added 2 dashes of Tabasco. Also, used the dry Saco buttermilk and the soup taste and texture was still very good.

A delicious and refreshing summer staple! And so simple to prepare. Low-fat buttermilk worked well, and I think more spice is key: extra cumin and a bit of tabasco sauce.

I began the recipe planning to follow the instructions, except for the ice cubes as I had cold homemade chicken stock. As I neared the finished product,not yet having added the cumin, I decided that no cumin and another avocado might be lovely. I also have decided to not add the additional cucumber as I serve the soup because it just great as is. A subtle avocado flavor with a light background of cucumber and tange of buttermilk. Refreshing and healthful and with more avocado flavors if you are a fan of avocados.

The flavor of the avocado was lost under the cucumber. Yogurt could be substituted for the avocado to get the same result. Nonetheless, it tastes good and would make a particularly nice dip.

Add a little "heat" (spice) to this recipe and you've got a real treat!

This is an easy, delicious soup. I threw all the ingedients into a bowl and blended with a hand blender. It took about 10 minutes!

Doubled this recipe and used Saffron as a garnish in the center on top of a dollop of sour cream. Delish!
