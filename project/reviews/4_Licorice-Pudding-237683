I haven't actually made this recipe, so I won't give it forks either way, but I used the method of infusing custard with licorice to make licorice ice cream and it was fantastic. (This was the ice cream recipe I used: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Vanilla-Bean-Ice-Cream-15285) Simply heated the milk, cream, and sugar with the licorice candies as directed in the pudding recipe and then continued to make the custard for the ice cream.

This makes OMG good pudding. I did not strain it before I chilled it and was happy with the littel pockets of licorice that it left. It also ocurred to me that if you left the corn starch out that it would make a great mix for frozen custard. I tried it and it is incredible!

I was intrigued by this recipe and decided to try it based on the reviews. Very glad I did - this is wonderful! The licorice flavor is subtle, and the texture is perfect.

Panda Licorice is good, but Little Bear is better. (Better yet, why not use anise oil or licorce extract (not the kind used for ailments or as an herbal demulcent found in health-food stores). This recipe blew me away. It's the kind of thing I'd dream up, experiment with, and almost everyone I know would say "Yuk" to. There's a whole nation of licorice-lovers out there???

Tastes like licorice! Warning: food processors will not chop licorice, so don't think you'll save time there.
