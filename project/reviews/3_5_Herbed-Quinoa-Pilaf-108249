This dish is very good! As someone else mentioned I used only 1 cup of quinoa and adjusted the rest of the ingredients proportionally and it was plenty for the two of us for dinner and leftovers for lunch the next day. I prefer using red quinoa as it has a bit more bite to it, not as mushy. I also used considerably more lemon juice. I prefer this served warmed

Delicious! I made this using 1 c. quinoa and it was easily enough for four people. Rinsed the quinoa and cooked it in a rice cooker using 2 c. water for 1 c. quinoa, then let it steam while I prepared the other ingredients. The result was perfectly cooked. I wanted it to be more like a pilaf than a salad so I lightly sautéed the onion, though it would have been fine raw. Tasted it with the seasonings as written and it was excellent, but I wanted it a bit more lemony so I added more to taste. I put it all together before it got to room temp and served it warm, and it was just as delicious as later when it cooled off. I give it four stars as written as well as with slight modifications -- a wonderful alternative to other grains. It will be a great company dish!

I made this for a dinner party and it was delicious. Everyone liked it, and people who had never had quinoa before were impressed. I couldn't taste the lemon at first, so I used a bit more than called for, maybe a TBS or so more. A couple people wanted to try it warm so they microwaved it and they liked it that way, too. This makes a huge amount and there was enough for a couple people to take some home. The next day it was still good and quite a bit more oniony, as you would expect. Having this again for dinner next week!

If you've made quinoa before then you'll know to halve the recipe unless this is being made for a holiday meal (which would be appropriate). Use broth and garlic instead of just water as well as substituted sliced almonds (not blanched) for pine nuts. Heavenly, subtle taste. Nice presentation (again, this would make for a nice holiday side dish). Will try next time with lemon zest in the mixture.

This is a good side recipe when you need something that is not too heavy or flavorful. I served it as a side to Grilled Tuscan Pork Rib Roast with Rosemary Coating and Red Pepper Relish & Grilled Marinated Vegetables.

This is a very tasty recipe but the original recipe needs lots of edits :( We do often prepare as follows (please note the washing "method" suggested and cooking tips edits as well, my wife is from Peru and she is a "quinoa" expert): Place quinoa in large container. Rinse with cold running water until water is clear (4-5 times). Transfer quinoa to large saucepan; add 2 cups water and salt. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is cooked but firm (about 12 minutes, and probably no more than 13 min). Tip - if more water is needed, add little by little. The quinoa goes from "uncooked" to cooked in the blink of an eye so watch out. It is easier if quinoa is cooked in low heat so that you have time to react. Remove the quinoa from the pan immediately after it is ready (it will keep cooking if left in the hot pan) Saute the onions until they are transparent, well cooked Transfer quinoa to large bowl; fluff with fork. Stir in oil and lemon juice (add as much lemon juice as you want, some people like it very "lemony"). Cool to room temperature. Mix in pine nuts and red onion. Season with salt and pepper. Add basil Mix in basil.

I lightly fried the red onion, and adding fresh sliced cherry tomatoes adds a lot to the flavor.

I panicked and cut the amount in 1/2 - ie., 1 normal bag of quinoa 2 cups. I then did the 2x water to Quinoa ratio. My question is... only doing the 1:1 ratio - is it actually better? or is this recipe just incorrect - is the quinoa drier, les mushy?

This was simple,but I found that to be the beauty of it. The subtle earthy taste to the quinoa was very appealing to me. I found myself sneaking bites while I was cleaning the kitchen after dinner!

I made this as written, with one change: I used chicken stock instead instead of water to cook the quinoa. The rest was verbatim. We thought it was delicious - even my kids ate it happily! Nice nuttiness and subtle flavor. We served it with grilled shrimp and it was a hit.

I halved the recipe and the quinoa-to-liquid ratio was perfect. I made changes and used chicken bouillon instead of salt and added fresh parsley. The dish is not bland, in my opinion, but mellow and rich from the pine nuts. An excellent side dish or lunch.

This dish is terrific! We found red quinoa in our grocery store -- even better!

Definately not a "make it again" dish, as written: it's utterly tasteless. And, because it was ready & sticking (burned) to my All-Clad saucepan well before the recipe said it would be done. Not what pilaf could or should be. The rave reviews on this board came from people who seriously "doctored up" the recipe. Adding chicken broth, herbs, garlic, or lemon would help, but IMHO, you're better off playing with a master recipe that's worth the experimentation.

Part of the point of using quinoa is to give your body a break from all the wheat we eat (or if you're on a restricted diet and not eating wheat at all). Quinoa is also very filling, so watch your portion size. I always laugh at people who do this, but here goes anyway. Since I am just cooking for one I figured 1 cup of quinoa would be way more than sufficient. A quick review of the comments here and the (Trader Joe's) quinoa box convinced me that it would need 2 cups of liquid. I used half vegetarian vegetable broth, and should have used more if I had had it. I Also used extra olive oil, juice from a whole lemon, 3/4 cups sliced almonds (alas, no pine nuts), one large red onion, one large carrot, one yellow pepper (red would have made a more festive color, though), about 1/4 c. chopped basil (my basil had gotten slimy and had to discard most of it), a whole bunch of parsley, and four cloves of garlic. After consultation with the quinoa box and some of the reviews I sauteed all the vegetables in oil, then added the broth, brought to a boil, and added the quinoa. Cooked for about twenty minutes. A suggestion for novice cooks: it is not generally recommended to cool a hot dish at room temperature as it makes a perfect breeding ground for bacteria. So I would suggest a quick bout in the freezer or fridge if you intend to follow that suggestion. Anyway, my end result could have been more flavorful, perhaps with the addition of red pepper flakes. But I ate as a main course, as a side dish, it might be fine.

Great recipe! It needed a few touches, In 5 cups of boiling vegetarian chicken stock I added 1 cup quinoa, cooked for ten minutes, 1 cup Multi-grain cereal(rye, barley oats and wheat) cooked another ten minutes, and 1 cup cous-cous, cooked a minute more. In another pan I sauteed 1/2 onion, 1/4 cup cashews, 1/4 cup slivered almonds, 1/4 cup roasted sunflower seeds in a healthy type margarine. Then I added half a pound of a blend of southern greens(mustard, turnip, collard, and spinach) from Trader Joe's, and stirred it together with the quinoa blend. It disguised the 'bird-seed' taste of the quinoa, and made a surprisingly edible and probably healthy concoction.

I love quinoa and make it often. However, this recipe is flawed. Use 2 parts liquid (preferable chicken broth/stock) to 1 part quinoa. Sautee the onion (and garlic) in oil. Then add the quinoa and liquid to the pot and cook. Then fluff in basil & pine nuts. Also, 4 cups of quinoa is WAY more than 12 servings!

I agree with everything Randall said. I added green onions, finely diced tomatoes, and a bit of dijon mustard and soy sauce to the dish. Tasty summer dish.
