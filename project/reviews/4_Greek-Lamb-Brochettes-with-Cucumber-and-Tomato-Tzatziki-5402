These are delicious and so easy. I made a birthday feast starting with grape leaves stuffed with goat cheese and grilled, then these amazing kabobs, the tzatziki, orzo, choice of pitas or homemade baguettes with chopped Kalamari olives -- who needed birthday cake?

Great way to make lamb. Even the kids liked it. I added yellow and green bell peppers to my skewers, and grape tomatoes as well for a really pretty presentation. Good advice to get Greek yogurt from Trader Joe's. The flavor is different and quite good, plus it makes the preparation easier. Definitely will make again.

A fantastic recipe that I turn to often. It never fails to please. I also make the tzatziki with other dishes or kabobs.

I just thought that I would mention that if you have a Trader Joe's nearby, you can buy Greek yogurt there. It eliminates the 3 hour task of draining American-style yogurt, making tzatziki making completely painless. It is about twice the price of regular yogurt (I think about $4 for 500g) but is also absolutely delicious by itself or with some honey.

Great marinade. Used it on lamb tenderloins and it did not overpower the delicate meat. Used a store-bought tzatziki and added chopped tomato to change it up a bit. (We LOVE the Astro brand tzatziki..it is garlicky and has fresh dill in it:)

Really delicious! But altho the recipe says to serve hot, I think I preferred them cold! I made them as appetizers so put 3 chunks of lamb onto each bamboo skewer then cooked them on a griddle pan. They turned out very well, and looked great handed round at the party. I used a shop bought tzatziki (cheating I know, but who has time to strain yoghurt?! Maybe one day I'll get round to that!)

I've made this several times since it first appeared in 1998 -- sometimes the entire menu and sometimes like last night the Tzatziki as a side dish. We highly recommend it, with no major changes. It was this recipe that taught me about draining yogurt, which is great for dips and sauces.

This recipe was as good as my favorite Greek Restaurant. I would not change a thing. I did not make the Tzatziki but definitely will the next time! This is a keeper.

delish! made full amount of marinade, but used rib chops instead (new year's day snacks!). marinated overnight and grilled. also made sauce, alas, without the dill. served chops with tomatoes and thin onion slices on the side, along with sauce. really tremendous. will certainly make again, and make special effort to have dill on hand.

I will make this again and again and again. Loved them and so did my guests. I served them as part of a major feast, but these will definitely be the legacy of the party. Served with the tzatziki, which I made ahead of time and in the end didn't bother with the tomatoes, although I'm sure they would be fine, not necessary. And served with grilled pocketless pita (oil both sides and place on upper racks while the lamb cooks). I was told I have a future as a street vendor, but I think I'll stick to ace entertainer. With recipes like this one, it's easy. A++.

This recipe was fantastic. I omitted the tomatoes from the tzatziki & instead grilled a skewer of them separately. Plus, I added onions to the meat skewers. Lastly, I'd recommend decreasing the garlic slightly.

I tried this recipe with pork for my husband birthday party and it was really delicious even without tzatzitki! As I bought a bit too much meat then we grilled the meat that was prepared on thursday, even still on Sunday. Unbelievable but it tasted even better. Alo I addaed to marinade a bit more lemon juice than suggested and just a liitle bit of ginger. Next time I would like to try it with lamb and with tzatziki.

I have made this several times now and wouldn't change a thing. The tzatziki is awesome and gives the lamb a fantastic flavor. The time and effort it takes to make this recipe is definitely worth it. My clients love it.

This is one of our favorites - very easy and tasty. I make it with pork, too.

I made this recipe on a camping trip 8000ft. up in the Sawtooth mountains of Idaho. It was a tasty treat after a day of hiking. Ease of prep, quick cooking time and great taste rate a repeat performance. Sure beats a hot dog over the campfire.

This is a very easy and delicious way to prepare lamb. The meat is tender and has a good flavor and the ingredients for the marinade are all staples, so no running to the store. I made the tzatziki and it was good, but I also have served the lamb with a cold cucumber buttermilk yogurt soup. Yum. If you like lamb and middle-eastern food, you will like this recipe.
