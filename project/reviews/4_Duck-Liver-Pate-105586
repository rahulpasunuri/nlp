Really good pate. I do think 3oz of duck fat was too much. I'll use 1.5-2 oz next time - and there *will* be a next time. Also I do want to caution people to stick with the salt recommendation as written. I added some additional, b/c when warm, it didn't seem adequately seasoned. Once cooled it flirted with being over seasoned. But of course that's my own fault.

Great Pate... but make ahead and let the flavors (the garlic) mellow and meld over night.

So easy, so fast, great use of my leftover livers!

It was really good at first, while still warm, but after it cooled it was really strong tasting. Too liver-y. But I ate it anyway.

This is SOOO good. I will be making this regularly. Takes no time at all and is insanely cheap to make. Make this dish!

This is an amazing recipe -- insanely simple, fabulous results. I was a bit nervous when i put the shallots in the fat and they browned immediately, but it didn't seem to affect the finished product. Blending the mixture gives it a perfect consistency. I, personally, love duck liver and I had approx 3 lobes on hand, so I just used all of them, keeping the rest of the recipe as written. It was lovely. My next batch will have a sweeter fortified wine, as I think a little sweetness would make this recipe sing even more beautifully. Thanks, Jaques!

This is a no-fail, perfect pate for the time-challenged. I have literally made this a dozen times and it continues to be a huge success. I've even made it faster (don't squeal to M. Pepin!) by placing the cooked mixture in a bowl, placing it in a larger bowl of ice water and whipping it with a hand-held immersion beater until it is beautifully smooth...and completely chilled. Phenomenal. Can't go wrong with this one.

This pate is exceptional! I was making duck confit -- which won't be ready for another two days -- so I made the pate to go with french bread and an onion soup made from the duck stock blended with a rich home-made chicken stock. Fabulous French Cafe supper!I have never had a problem with a Pepin recipe so I followed this one exactly. Try it, you'll love it!

This is such a simple, perfect recipe! You can use brandy or port if you don't have cognac on hand - results are just wonderful!

This doesn't taste like foie gras, but it's delicious. I love that this makes just a small amount of pate and that it calls for only one liver; pate doesn't keep well and how would you obtain more than one at a time? Takes only minutes to make too. This is a keeper.

I don't feel qualified to rate this recipe as this is the first pate I've ever made and the only other times I've eaten liver it was chopped chicken liver as a child. I prepared this with duck fat that had already been rendered (from a previous duck-cooking session) and with a brandy that was not a cognac. I found it to be quite good. I didn't strain the pate and I think I would have enjoyed it even more had I done so. I served it with mixed baby spinach, arugula, and radicchio with a light balsamic vinaigrette. I had debated whether to go with a sweet or acidic accompaniment and I ended up with the latter. It I were rating it I would give it 3 forks.

This recipe is quick and delicious! I used dried shallot, reconstituted in a little water, and a duck and a chicken liver with an equivalent amount of duck fat. Both the livers and the fat had been frozen from the last time I had roasted a duck. Went together effortlessly...forget paying $8.99 an ounce at the store!

Andrewhaben in UK. Sure. I can't see any reason you cannot javascript:void(0);sub port for the brandy/cognac. I've certainly had store bought pate made w/ port that tasted delicious.

I am not sure what I did wrong with this recipe. I LOVE pate but I am not a fan of cooked liver. I used duck livers and could not for the life of me find duck fat, so I used goose fat instead, which I rendered myself so was very fresh. I followed the recipe and it came out fine but very very rich and liver-y tasting (sorry can't think of a better way to describe it). Any tips greatly appreciated, since so many seemed to have better luck than me!

I have never run into a JP recipe that I didnt love and this is no exception. So easy and delicious! Your guests will be thrilled and it makes any occasion feel special to start a meal with this pate!

Fantastic recipe. I can't afford duck livers so I use chicken livers. Nobody can tell the difference. The rendered duck fat is essential. I've made this recipe about 10 times and am always satisfied. This is the best pate recipe I've ever used.

This is an exceptional recipe. I'm sorry the chef took offense to some of the other comments. I hate to say it but I have used chicken liver with good results. The duck fat is essential or go find another recipe.

What a treat! I made this twice in two days. The second time with two minor adjustments - reduced the fat a little & increased the herbes de provence a bit. My nine year old turned up her cute little nose, but the rest of my family LOVED it, especially my 18-year old who would have devoured the whole thing along w/the gizzards (which he sauteed & sprinkled w/a little salt) if I didn't stop him.

Awesome is what I have to say...went straight back to the store and bought another fresh duck with 4oz of that wonderful liver. Chopped up 3 oz of the thickest part of the fat and rendered it. Mr Pepin did not say what to do with the chitlins...it was too late anyway...I inhaled them after sprinkling with coarse salt!!! I used fresh thyme and basil instead of dried herbs.... Using all of the rendered fat made this very rich and the cognac is a MUST. Making more today and will add a tad more thyme...still debating on whether or not to use all the rendered fat this time...I probably will. Fresh made crostini( made with a french baguette, fine olive oil and finley milled pepper) chopped red onion and cornichons will accompany my pate' along with a cold Chardonay. Delicious. Perhaps those who denigrate this recipe dont belong in the kitchen creating culinary art....perhaps the backyard BBQ would be appropo

You are correct. My recipe is not edible. You see, I publish recipes that make no sense. Foolish people make my recipes and force themselves to eat it.

Harriette and Cook from Southampton, yes, this was delicious. It was the best homemade pate I've made, and so easy. This recipe was a great find, and I would serve or recommend it to anyone who has an appreciation of fine food.

Wonderful recipe! Did change things a bit though. Used less duck fat - about half - and used sherry instead of cognac. Excellent use of those leftover duck livers and perfect beginning to a duck confit dinner!

I served this pate before the duck to friends who enjoyed it as much as I did. It really needs to rest for an hour or so before serving, otherwise the flavors do not develope.
