This is a solid two and a half to three forks; it is a fine, quick, easy midweek dinner. I did up the curry and spices a bit but not as much as many other reviewers. Didn`t have a cup of lentils so added much less and less liquid. Didn't add the peas and didn`t miss them. Served with couscous. This would be a good one to make more of and freeze. Will make again.

Like a lot of other people, I found the basic recipe to be a good starting point, but on its own pretty dull. Here's what I added to give it a boost: 3 tbsp curry; 1tsp each of cumin, turmeric, and coriander; 2 tsp garam masala; 2 tbsp ketchup. The ketchup added some needed sweetness and savory. I suppose something else would also work, but ketchup happened to be at hand. I also threw in about 4 cups of baby spinach and used red lentils instead of yellow or brown.

I kicked it up a few notches and it really rocked! I increased the curry (Red Curry) to 4 Tablespoons. Also I marinated 1.5 lbs of lamb in 3 Tbl of Curry and 3 Tbl of Oil over night in a zip lock bag. The remaining 1 TBL of Curry, I added to pot after adding the carrots. After cooking as directed for 1 hour, I also used a full box of frozen spinach and 1 full bag of frozen peas at last 10 minutes. After cooking, I let it cool down for 1 hours, then let it sit for 6 hours in refrigerator. Then just before serving, I set it back on stove and warmed it all up. Served it with Greek yogurt, and Garlic Naan, over rice. 5 Stars!

I had red lentils in my pantry so used those instead, also I had to substitute a Tbs. of ground ginger for fresh. It was still wonderful! We had it over rice, everyone in the family loved it.

This recipe was delicious, and even better the day after preparing it. My butcher didn't have the lamb loin available, so I used shoulders (deboned), and it worked out just as nicely. I used about 3 tablespoons of curry, and I still felt that the recipe could have benefited from a little more spice and heat. I also added half a package of frozen spinach. Next time I'm going to use the full package of spinach, add extra tomatoes, and serve with some thick yogurt.

This recipe tasted the best after a day or two in the fridge, once all the ingredients really had time to settle together. I used 5 of cloves garlic, 3 tablespoons of curry, 1 teaspoon cumin, red lentils, and added spinach. I served with rice. I will make this again, but I will let the lamb marinate in salt, curry, and pepper longer than just before cooking. Also might try substituting 1 of the cups of water with vegetable broth and will definitely add more salt.

I've used this recipe as a base several times, varying the amounts of lentils to lamb depending on what I've got. I too have used leftover leg of lamb in this as well as starting from scratch. Agree with splurging on spices, peas are indeed optional but eye catching and plain greek style yoghurt as a garnish really makes it yummy.

I made this exactly following the recipe *except I used leftover cooked lamb* and found it plenty tasty. My only comment was that the portion size was HUGE- I cut the recipe in half and we got 4 good sized servings out of it.

greetings. i liked the stew. much like many users before myself, i doubled garlic and ginger. i always taste as i go and it was still missing something. i added a bit more salt and sambal paste. a little sambal goes a long way. 1 tsp. did the trick. also, i added a touch of cumin with the curry powder. if you can't find lamb sirloin, the shoulder worked great if you don't mind cutting it off the bone. cheers!

Very good tasty recipe.For variation I did not add the peas but added yougurt at serving time. Also used Madrass Curry (my favovorite). My family loved it andit was even better when re-heated 4 days later. MMmm!

I don't know why everyone feels the need to tinker with this recipe-- replacing the lentils, doubling the spices, carmelizing the onions, etc. We thought it was tasty as heck just as written, and I even forgot to add the peas at the end. Make it early in the day, or the day before, and rewarm for even better flavor. The only addition I'd make (besides those peas, of course) is a generous dollop of Greek yogurt and a fresh batch of garlic naan. Yum.

I've made this recipe 3 times already, it's always amazing. I put far more garlic, ginger and curry in the stew than the recipe calls for and add chicken or vegetable stock to kick the flavor up. Muir Glen organic diced tomatoes from a can work perfectly. You can use any kind of lentil. This recipe isn't rocket science - you can make many changes.

I really enjoyed this recipe and it was easy to make. I added more ginger and garlic than the recipe called for as well as a little extra curry and served with coconut rice. Yummy! Next time I will use more curry it wasn't quite spicy enough for me. Overall a good recipe will defiently make again.

Wonderful recipe. Followed the suggestions to use cumin/turmeric, etc., rather than "curry" powder. Used leftover lamb roast for the meat.

Not a great dish. Don't understand what all the fuss is about with this one. I also substituted the red lentils but that made this stew a mushy, bland, unexciting curry. The spice was not as good as other curry recipes I've tried, which is why I won't be trying this recipe again as written. I recommend you find another use for your lamb meat.

This failed to excite. I stirred in a big blop of Greek yogurt which did help, but the curry powder gave it a one-note flavor that got old fast.

This one is a winner! I used a regular curry spice mixture instead of the curry powder and used packaged, pre-cut "lamb for stew" from the supermarket, but otherwise followed the recipe pretty much as written. Delicious!

Thanks to many others for sharing their recommendations on this recipe. I doubled the garlic and ginger, skipped the curry powder and instead used the cumin/coriander/turmeric combo with an added teaspoon or so of Penzey's Rogan Josh seasoning (fabulous with lamb). Didn't have lentils so used small white beans (Goya's habichuelas blancos). The beans turned pale yellow from the turmeric and looked very pretty with the red of the tomatoes -- and tasted great with the seasonings. I'd almost suggest skipping lentils and going for the small white beans instead. I didn't miss the lentil taste because of all the spices. Oh, also caramelized the onions, and cooked them with the garlic and ginger then added all the spices to that mix and cooked for a minutes or so. Oh, and I used leftover lamb leg which worked great as well. Just simmered it in the sauce for a while.

Absolutely delicious. I added whatever vegetables that I had in the fridge, eggplant and mushrooms and then added some hot chilli powder to give it some kick. Also used red lentils instead and it was great, so good that I want to make it again this weekend!

I made the lentils separately from the lamb leg and used different spices: ground cumin, whole cloves, whole coriander seed, curry leaves, bay leaves, tumeric, ground chipotle, salt. The lamb was wonderfully tender, the broth spicy. It was great with fresh bread. I might try with beef another time. The spice combination can be infinitely varied. A versatile dish which can utilize whatever you happen to have on hand in the pantry.

Very nice dish for a cold day. I used half red lentils the 2nd time I made it and found the texture and appearance to be slightly nicer (red lentils don't have the skins on them, so they cook to a smoother consistency).

Rating: 3
It was pretty good, with the spice modifications suggested by earlier reviewers. I used beef instead of lamb, and doubled the lentils (be sure to double the water if you double the lentils!). The 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon made a nice touch.

Quite an ordinary stew but nevertheless very good. I used more (green) lentils and doubled the curry powder. Better the next day.

To make this more flavorful, one should brown the lamb in small batches and reserve. Then saute the onions in a generous dollop of oil, stirring constantly until they turn golden brown (about 8-12 minutes). then add the garlic and ginger and stir-fry until they are fully fragrant. Instead of store-bought "curry powder" it's much better to use a teaspoon of ground cumin and a teaspoon of ground coriander, as the previous reviewer mentioned and stir for a minute. Then add some cayenne pepper to taste and and a half teaspoon of turmeric, being careful not to let the turmeric burn, and then add the tomatoes and browned lamb pieces. You could also add a little ground cinnamon and cloves before you add the tomatoes and lamb. If you don't really caramelize the onions and cook the spices well, the dish will be totally lacking in flavor. Another good trick is to keep the lamb bone from the butcher, brown it in the oven at 400 for an hour or so on a baking pan and add it with the lentils. Remove when you serve. Plain Basmati rice and a fresh coriander garnish would be beautiful. A wonderful Winter dish. Like chili, it's always better the next day, when the flavors have fully comingled. Make a triple batch and freeze it.

Like most I tripled the curry powder, using a hot version, and it was too hot. I tripled the garlic and ginger and tripled the amount of lamb used. In the end I could only taste "hot spice", so I added apple sauce, a chopped apple, Garam Masala, turmeric and cumin, another cup of water and finally about a 1/4 cup of sweetened coconut flakes. The taste is good but not great, then again I have a very picky palate given I live near NYC's India Row. Hopefully this will be better on the day after.

Great! I don't like curry powder so instead I used 1 tsp tumeric, 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp coriander and a sprinkle of cinnamon. I also added half of a fresh chile with the garlic and replaced the peas with spinach. Finally squeezed a bit of lemon in at the end. It was beautiful.

I made many of the same changes that other cooks have: 3 T curry powder, lots more ginger and garlic, hot pepper, cumin, garam masala ... and after all that, I really enjoyed it! Worth making again with those revisions, because it's very easy, delicious, and nutritious!

Made this dish many times. Better with red lentils (Dal). Also have substitued chopped fresh spinach for the Zuccinni and like it better. Good with either a meaty shank bone like a stew, or diced leg or shoulder meat. Freezes well. My husband (my best critic) thinks it is as good as any restaurant dish. Serve with plain yogurt.

I used this recipe to use up leftover leg of lamb and it worked out great. I didn't brown the lamb, but added it in with the broth (which I substituted for water). I did double the curry, which was definitely necessary. This was excellent with some chutney also.

I wish I had read the previous reviews! Definitely requires more curry, but other than that this is an easy to make, delicious, and very filling meal. I used lamb shanks and cooked a bit longer than an hour so the shanks could become tender - worked very well. I'll definitely make this one again.

This was a pretty simple recipe, with great results. However, those who really like curry should double the amount of curry added.

If you are in the habit of making or eating curries this recipie will dissapoint. As suggested by others, I doubled the garlic, tripled the curry powder, substituted chick peas for green peas ( watch the water volume with dry chicks ) and threw in some assorted vegatables - still it seemed bland. However - two tablespoons of Patak's Vindaloo paste, available in Indian food stores and some enlightened supermarkets, rescued the vat of stew, and I might make it again because with Patak's help, it turned out to be a filling, moderate effort curry style dish.

I am eagerly anticipating having the leftovers for dinner tonight - YUM!!!

I tripled the amount of curry - 1 part Patak's extra hot to 2 parts Patak's regular. The ginger as well should be at least doubled if not tripled. I left the peas out - although the colour would be nice, the flavour would be lost. Instead I made some basmati rice & added the peas to the rice. As well I served with 1/2's of heated naan-style pita (or so the package said). The plate looked great - stew, rice with peas & 1/2 pita. Real naan or papadam would have been better . . .

Definitely delicious and nutricious. For people who suffer from heartburn, I would suggest that the curry powder, garlic, and ginger is left out. A variation to this recipe, would be to try other vegetables and meats in it. For e.g., bacon or sausages, or cubed potatoes, pumpkin, califlower, pork (fresh or salted). Goes well with some rice.

Excellent recipe the amount is lentils seemed correct to me. It definetlyt needs far more of the curry powder and some cayenne pepper. a tablespoon or two or Pataks hot curry paste is a very good addition. Be sure and have some good crusty french bread with it.

We thought this recipe excellent. The flavor of the ginger did not come through, so I'd probably add more ginger and more curry. It's an excellent dish which is relatively easy to prepare. We though the level of lentils quite appropriate.

Other than the over abundance of lentils, this recipe is very well done, a tip might be to cut the recommended 1cup lentils down to at least 1/2 and to add a little more curry and some cayenne. I would definitley make it again with some alterations!
