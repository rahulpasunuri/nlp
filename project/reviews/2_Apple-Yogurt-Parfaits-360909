Ok so this totally isn't a review, but a comment. I've been addicted to my current brekkie of yogurt, apples, walnuts and maple syrup. So delicious, and the perfect time of year for it!

This is a great basic concept for breakfast, but would be much better without the agave or honey, which are not necessary to make this sweeter--the apples and raisins have enough sweetness.
