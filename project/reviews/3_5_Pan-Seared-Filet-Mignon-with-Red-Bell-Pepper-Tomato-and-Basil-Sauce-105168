A pleasant respite from au poivre and various rich cheeses. I used the strained solids as a garnish on the filets as they were to flavorful to waste

This is glorified spaghetti sauce. I would not waste it on filet mignon. Thankfully I just used sirloin. It simply doesn't compare with blue cheese and/or red wine sauces. This is meant for ground beef, not steak. THEN it could be delicious.

I made this extraordinary dish in my 8th aniversary and enjoyed making and eating it. I served it with wild rice and was an excelent combination. Really reccomend it. Enjoy!

Made this dish last night. Everything was OK but not great. Served with twice baked potatoes with goat cheese (also found here). I prefer a red wine sauce over the tomato/basil used here. Just my preference. Would make again, but no rush. The best part was the twice baked.

This is a fabulous recipe and relatively simple to make. The sauce can be made ahead of time and reheated. We served it with creamy polenta. Very elegant.

I made this at a dinner party at my girlfriend's house and I recieved nothing but compliments. The sweetness of the bell pepper keeps the red pepper flakes from making the sauce to spicy, and the sauce in general complimented the steaks perfectly. An A+ recipe!!

My husband made this recipe for Valentine's Day dinner. We loved it! We were afraid the sauce was going to be too spicy after tasting it on its own, but it was perfect on the beef. I can't wait to have this again. I wouldn't change a thing.

As a matter of fact, I made this delicious recipe for a few friends of mine for the Acadamy Awards night,...and they all LOVED it! I am going to make it again this weekend for about 20 guests. I served this the first time w/your other recipe; Lobster tail w/terragon sauce: Surf-N-Turf! It was wonderful.

I made this a few weeks ago and it was alright. If I made the sauce again, I'd probably use it on chicken breasts. The filet mignon would have been better plain. I felt like I was ruining it as I poured the sauce over them. Everyone else liked it well enough.

This was the most incredible beef recipe I've ever made. My guests (and I) were very pleased.

I agree with the last review, the sauce is good not great. It needs more flavor - maybe more crushed red pepper, definitely salt and pepper. I grilled the steaks so skipped the water and browned bits step. My experience has been that you don't get enough flavor out of that step to make it worth while.

This recipe was good, glad I tried it but would not be in a rush to repeat it any time soon. Good sauce, just didn't wow me.
