I was expecting flavor burst in my mouth from this recipe, but was met with the most bland and tasteless curry I have ever had. I even added some garlic and extra curry paste and it was still a dismal failure. I would never eat this again.

Fantastic! I used a bit more coconut milk because I had leftovers from another project and upped the red Thai curry paste a bit. Also added garlic and shallot per another reviewers suggestion. It was the last spinach of the season from our local farmer's market and the mix of colors was beautiful. I can see playing around with the veggies based on what you're trying to use up and I'm sure chicken pieces would work, too. Can't wait to make it again!

This was beautiful as well as delicious, and relatively healthy since I used the lowfat coconut milk. I do like a bit of heat, so may haeve added more curry paste. Will definitely make it again.

this was simple and beautiful, although the flavor was more subtle than i usually associate with thai food. i sauteed thinly sliced garlic, shallot and hot red pepper in the first step, and can't imagine not having that extra layer of heat - it was still quite mild. i skipped the naam pla, and added lots of chopped fresh basil at the end, which was womderful. this is a great base recipe, and i will definitely make it again and have fun with improvisations.

This is a good, quick, basic recipe which you'll enjoy playing around with. I'm guessing there are many substitutions which will be equally interesting. However, I'm surprised more reviewers didn't find it too mild to be good Thai cuisine. Perhaps my curry paste was at fault, but next time I'll double the amount stated here. Some salt and fresh basil might help kick it up as well.

Decided to make this easy recipe to use up extra shrimp(cooked) and veggies(slivered green beans, red and green pepper strips, celery) all leftovers from a party we gave. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written except for not adding the shrimp until after I added the spinach. Did not want to overcook the already cooked shrimp.Great Thai flavour. Husband said "I would pay big money to eat this again!!" High praise indeed. 2 tsps of Red Curry paste was a little spicy but I used cherry tomatoes as a garnish to help cool our palates. Appreciated reading all the reviews. It's an A+ recipe in my book.

I thought this dish lacked flavor. If you're looking for a great curry, try the Thai Shrimp Curry, also on this site and a much better option.

Sorry guys but this was totally so-so. At least it was with the green curry paste that I used. A homemade green curry past is way better and would improve this dish significantly.

I have made this recipe many times it is one our family favorites. I like to us 1/2 shrimp and 1/2 chicken tenders, then follow the recipe as it is exactly shown. Every time I serve our daughters says, " this is FAB"

It good to find a Thai recipe that is very easy to prepare at home and taste "right".

I left the spinach out completely, and added zucchini, broccoli, onions, one Thai red chili, fresh ginger and a few cloves of garlic. It turned out really well, and the frozen shrimp really soaked up a lot of the coconut flavour. My lunch friend commented that it tasted just like Thai take-out.

Rating: 3
The only very minor issue I had with this recipe was that it turned out to be too salty - maybe my fish sauce is a bit too salty, so next time I will use only 1 tbspn of it. Definitely taste the sauce as you add the fish sauce. otherwise, great recipe!

This is soooooooooo good. My family loved it, and also agreed that it is better than the local thai restaurant's curry. My only problem was that I did not know that corriander is the same as cilantro. So, I went to several stores looking for fresh corriander before one of them shared with me that it is just cilantro! Oh well, it was worth it!!!

beautiful, quick and delicious; followed it exactly, only substituting fresh-picked beet greens for spinach; used Thai Kitchen brand and organic coconut milk- perfect

Fabulous and SO easy to make. Unless you love very hot curry, I personally recommend that you stick to the recipe, as it was perfect for us. Everyone will love this!

We said exactly what others have said - this is better than what the Thai restaurants serve. So quick, so easy. I used half shirmp and half tofu. I wilted the spinach in the microwave and just stirred it in at the end, a nice time saver.

This is a real winner!!! I made this Thai curry without reading the numerous reviews, as I believe in "test cooking" a recipe exactly as written. The only glaring point for me was the miniscule amount of curry paste used. I do a great deal of Thai and Indian curries and have never seen that small an amount used in any recipe before. After numerous "tastes" along the way, I used about 1 tablespoon of the curry paste, and will probably use a bit more than that next time. All in all it is a real corker...loved it!

I make this at least once a month. We LOVE it!! I use pre-cooked shrimp from our fish market, and just add them toward the end. Also use pre-washed baby spinach...this dish is excellent!!

this is a regular at our house. both my husband and i love it and fight for leftovers. it's quick and easy, but doesn't taste it. I usually add a little more red bell and some shiitake mushrooms. yum!

Very easy and flavorful. Used giant tiger shrimp, omitted the carrots, but added baby corns and bamboo shoots. I think almost any vegetable would work in this recipe. It came out much better than the same dish at our local Thai restaurant.

This recipe is wonderful. The colors of the vegetables make a very pretty presentation and the flavor of the coconut is subtle but detectable, just how I like it! I served it over coconut ginger jasmine rice and it was a huge success.

I LOVE this recipe. I've made it twice so far. I agree with the other cooks, that it's versatile. I've added various ingredients myself. And it's always a hit! In fact I'm making it for my date tomorrow night. :) I like adding green onions, basil and a little extra curry paste for more zing!

Rating: 3
Fast and easy to prepare, and very tasty. Versatile, too: I've added, variously, onions, mushrooms, basil and bamboo shoots, and they've all worked well. Let the coconut milk thicken considerably for a thicker texture. Upping the fish sauce gives it more "oomph", but going with more than 2 tsp of curry paste will make the heat overpower the flavors.

Rating: 4
I make this about 2-3 times a month. It is very easy to fix. I do usually double the naam pla and the red curry paste as well as had a little red pepper flakes. I use light coconut milk as well. One of our favorite family meals.

Rating: 4
I just ate two helpings of this dish, it's terrific! I added some shitake mushrooms because I like them. I followed the tip of another cook and didn't use light coconut milk which I think makes a difference. I used Thai Kitchen brand red curry and found 2 tsp to be spicy enough for me--I think some will find this too spicy. Excellent.

I've made this recipe several times. Always a hit. BUT I substitute Thai basil for the spinach .. it adds depth to the curry. Can't go wrong with this.

Very easy and delicious. Used already washed baby spinach in the bag for even greater ease. Used green curry paste, and onions in place of the carrots and peppers (didn't have any on hand). Whole family loved it (even my 10 year old)!

This is the best shrimp curry recipe that I have found. I did have to add extra curry for taste, I do believe it depends on your curry. The red peppers brought depth to the flavor. Even my non-enthusiastic husband was impressed!

Wow! Quickly threw this together for a dinner party and it was a hit. Everyone loved the spinach and shrimp mix. Made it in advance and then easily reheated when it was time to serve . . . the only change I made was I added a bit more curry paste for little more zing.

This is a beautiful, colorful and scrumpious meal. All our guests finished their servings and went back for more. I can't wait to eat the leftovers tonight. I used frozen pre-cooked shrimp for a time-saver, and omitted the fresh coriander because I couldn't find any. I had planned to serve my regular condiments of diced hardboiled egg, mango chutney, chopped green onions, peanuts, etc .... but did NOT because it would have been too much. The dish is full of veggies and shrimp and is a colorful display on your dish. Will definitely make this again and again!

My husband has spent quite a bit of time in Thailand, and loves red curries. He thought this was better than many he's had in restuarants. Guests loved it too...and I just realized that I forgot to add the cilantro. I'm sure that would make it even better. I make sticky rice, which is a family favorite, and I don't know if we'll ever make jasmine rice again. Will be adding this to the rotation of family favorites though.

This was delicious! I made is once and left out the cilantro and it wasn't the same. The cilantro really adds a great zing! My two year old son even likes it!

This dish was fabulous. I followed the lead of another reviewer and added keffir lime leaves to the mix--it added a nice hint of lime. Plus I threw in some zucchini and yellow bell pepper with great results. I used fish filets rather than shrimp and made steamed jasmine rice. I'd absolutely serve to guests. Try this one!

I added some thai peppers to spice it up a bit! It turned out GREAT!!!!! I have never made Thai food or any type of oriental food so it was a first attempt, but it was SO easy and tasted just like it came from a restaraunt! :) MAKE THIS! :)

I made this as a theme dinner for tonights premier of Survivor:Thailand. It was fabulous! Nice and spicy; a cold beer was a good accompaniment. I used a Taste of Thai Jasmine Rice (boxed!) and poured the shrimp and sauce over it. Also, I used only 1/2 a large red bell pepper and 7 ounces of Baby Spinach (so I wouldn't have to worry about trimming thick stems.) I can not stand cilantro (coriander leaves)so I omitted it and I don't think the dish was lacking in flavor or appearance! Very attractive!

sounds good... When i make green curry, i always put in about 1/4 cup fresh basil.

Rating: 3
I make this dish frequently substituting tofu for the shrimp. It is always easy, always delicious and always gets rave reviews. Tip: green curry is hotter than red curry. You make want to take that into consideration when deciding how much paste to add. I always use 2 heaping tsp of green and find it perfect for me, but spice is one of those personal preferences so you may need to find what works best for you. Delicious!

I love this recipe and have been making it for years. Its important to use good coconut milk, avoid the lowfat varieties- too watery a result. A tip I learned was not to let the milk go into a full boil but keep it to a gentle simmer and the consistency is always better for me. I also have my emergency aid- powdered coconut milk I keep on hand just in case. If the sauce is too watery I toss that in and problem solved. This recipe also works great with all kinds of fish fillets.

This is a tasty Thai dish and would recommend to spicy lovers to add more of the chili paste, or add fresh chilis to it. Overall: a rich delicacy that is perfect to serve over rice. Tips: I simmered it 20min. longer to add a more flavorful taste.

This was slightly strange.....the flavours were good but the sauce was very thin. It might work better with powdered coconut milk, because you can control the consistency better. Also, it needed WAY more curry paste than the recipe called for, and maybe a bit less nam pla.

What a flavorful, colorful and easy dish! I've been trying to find a recipe like this after having it at a local Thai restaurant! I followed the recipe exactly. I used 1-1/2 t. curry paste and was very mild (I used Maesri red curry brand from Thailand). This recipe is a keeper! (I kind of liked the large spinach leaves in the dish, but chopped would work, as others suggested...) I served it with a cucumber salad with seasoned rice vinegar. Yum!

This recipe was really delicious and although we really enjoy hot spicy food this was a little too hot for our tastebuds. I used two teaspoons of the curry sauce but I will most definitely only use one teaspoon next time I prepare it. Will definitely prepare it again and again and highly recommend it.

This is a great quick and easy Thai curry recipe. Make sure you get authentic Thai curry paste, it makes all the difference. The spinach is a nice addition, but I would chop it coarsely before cooking

I think I would use frozen chopped spinach next time (to save time but also the fresh spinach was so bulky in the recipe). Not a favorite of ours.

Fantastic! Easy! Versatile! I made this recipe three times in a week (once to test it out for a dinner party, once because I couldn't wait for the dinner party, and finally, for the dinner party. I made numerous changes (substituted golden fried tofu cubes for the shrimp, thawed frozen chopped spinach for fresh, added water chestnuts, eggplant and mushrooms, left out the fish sauce for a vegetarian version). Each time it turned out great. I like spicy food, but I went with the lesser amount of (red) curry paste for the dinner party version. They were still raving about it the following week. 'Nuff said.
