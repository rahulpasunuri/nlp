The butterscotch chiffon portion was delightful. (During the process of making this, a wonderful caramel sauce is made...may use it separately as an icecream topping.) The chocolate crust was not very tasty. Next time I will probably make some sort of graham cracker crust. Almonds work well also, if you don't like pecans.
