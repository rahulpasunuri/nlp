Great recipe. I cut it in half and it still made a ton. I followed the previous reviewers advice and didn't worry about having brown chicken stock. Used my own homemade stock instead. I also added yukon golds and parsnips, as well as some dried apricots. Very delicious!

I have made this recipe two years running for Hannukkah parties, and it's been a big hit! Several pieces of advice: (1) Don't sweat if you can't find BROWN chicken stock; regular chicken stock (or beef stock) will be fine. (2) If you're lazy like me, save time by buying a bag of baby carrots. (3) Can use yams in place of sweet potatoes. (4) DO follow the directions by waiting to add the carrots and sweet potatoes until after the first two hours of braising. (4a) If you're lazy like me and put the carrots & sweet potatoes in at the beginning, cut the sweet potatoes into larger pieces. I found that after 3 hours of braising, chilling, and then another hour of re-heating, the small chunks of sweet potatoes simply dissolved into the broth. The broth tasted awesome, but there was less to eat. (5) I did not find dried pitted prunes in the produce aisle, where I'd expect them. Instead, check the snacks aisle, near the nuts and popcorn. Thanks, Grandma Ethel! :-)

You don`t have to be Jewish (or, insert group here)to enjoy a great meal). Made this for Easter. It was a huge hit, definitely a keeper and will certainly make it again. I`ve always believed that the key to understanding and tolerance amongst people is through food. What better way is there than to sit and talk while eating a great meal

Everyone raved about this at Christmas dinner. We have a lot of food sensitivities in the family and everyone was able to eat this without any alterations. It was also nice to have the majority of cooking done the day ahead. I cut the sweet potatoes a little small. The next time I will make sure to leave them quite large otherwise they break down with the long cooking time.

Wonderful and easy to make. Important tip: after you've chilled the brisket and sliced it for reheating, put everything back in the pan with the meat at the bottom and the veggies on top. That way the meat will be in the sauce when everything melts. I did this the second time, big improvement. And: you can never have too many prunes.

I made this for Easter. Passover can"t have all the fun! It was very easy and the cook time was perfect. I put a thermometer in the oven and made sure the heat was at 350. I used 7lbs of meat and 20 oz of plums. I chilled for 2 days. It was a hit. You could easily chill for 3 days. I am not this type of cook, so if you are worried about it coming out right - this seems to be the one. Happy cooking! J

This recipe was great. I subbed regular chicken broth for the brown broth and added sage and white potatoes. Everyone raved.

I have made this twice and will make it again in April. It gets rave reviews even from my picky foody friends. The best, easiest recipe ever.

First time I chose to make a brisket for Rosh Hashanah. Never attempted before due to horror stories of this type of meat being dry and tough. After reading the reviews for this recipe, I took a chance. Outcome was incredible! The meat was wonderfully TENDER and MOIST; no knife necessary for cutting into bite size pieces,a fork did the job. Even the most finicky eaters and family food critics loved it; 13 lbs of meat for 8 people gone in one sitting. I look forward to making brisket again and have no hesitation in recommending this recipe to others.

Just finished cleaning up after a long day. I made this brisket today for Erev Rosh Hashana, Most everyone raved except my husband who thinks it is too sweet and not like his mom's brisket. (News Flash: Its never going to be!) I think the 50 minute time estimate is outrageous, more like 2 hours. I ended up cooking it an additional 2 hours. If I made it again I would cook it longer (2 hours more) BEFORE adding the vegetables obviously. A very good recipe, just not what the doctor ordered, at least for one of us.

It was very good. I used a second cut, b/c i like the deliciousness of a fatty cut. I think first would have worked as well, just keep it moist.

I made this for a Hanukkah party, and it was a huge hit. The sweet potatoes got mushy but it might be my fault since i think i cut them to small. The flavor of the meat and vegetables was really nice. I followed the recipe exactly. I would definitely make this again.

This was very easy to make and incredibly good. It takes time, but hardly any of it is hands-on. Not all of my guests are fans of sweet potatoes and if asked, most would have said they would not eat prunes, but the consensus was that this was the best brisket they ever had. I added extra veggies (both potatoes and carrots) and it needed a little extra liquid, but otherwise, this recipe is right on the money. I highly recommend it.

This is a great (and easy) brisket recipe. I had two sedars this year, and made it twice (each time to rave reviews). Both times I cooked it longer than the said (you can't overcook brisket, so long as its being braised in a liquid); and I didn't chill overnight (I'm never that on-top of my schedule). It's true it tastes even better after it sits, but it's still delicious!

I made this for our Seder and it was a hit. I substituted dried cranberries for the prunes. Would definitely make it again.

I made this for our Passover Seder last evening. I didn't want to make brisket and Tzimmes so this was the perfect choice. I made a couple of small changes: 1. Added bay leaf while braising 2. Added freshly grated nutmeg 3. The sauce seemed too thin so I pureed 1 cup of liquid with some of the sweet potatoes and carrots, then added puree to thicken the gravy. I also used whole brisket rather than flat cut but this didn't seem to affect the outcome. I can't wait to eat the leftovers, as brisket always seems to improve with age!
