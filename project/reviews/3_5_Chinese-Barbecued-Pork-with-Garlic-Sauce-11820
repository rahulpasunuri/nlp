Have been making this since 1996. Fantastic.

I thought this was tasty, but not spectacular. Still, I will make it again because it is so quick and easy to make, and most of the ingredients are pantry staples. With steamed rice and a green veg, dinner is on the table with little effort in not much time. Next time I will try marinating it ahead of time.

Made this last night and loved it. I did make the bbq sauce in the morning and let the pork marinade all day. Tons of flavor and the garlic sauce was wonderful.

Here's what I did: First of all, ketchup? Who ever heard of ketchup in Chinese cooking? I mixed the minced garlic with the rice vinegar, spread it all over the tenderloin and put it in a ziploc bag in the fridge overnight. I turned the bag over a few times while it marinated for distribution of the vinegar. I got the BBQ hot a few hours before my cocktail party. Meanwhile I scraped all the garlic and vinegar off the tenderloin and into a bowl, putting the tenderloin aside. I mixed the soy sauce into the bowl with a little hot chili paste and sesame oil. I skipped the sugar and the ketchup and mixed hoisin sauce in until the mixture was BBQ sauce consistency. The hoisin is plenty sweet enough without the sugar and ketchup. I put the tenderloin on the grill, kept basting it and turning it until it felt done. It's easy to overcook these. so you have to be careful. I cooled it off to room temperature and served it sliced thinly with sliced dinner rolls as "slider" sandwiches. Apparently those are all the rage now. I wanted something to spread on the rolls, so I bought cilantro, took the leaves off and pureed them with sesame oil and a touch of chili paste and soy sauce. I got it to spreading consistency, transferred to a bowl and sprinkled the "pesto" with toasted sesame seeds. I also served a tiny bowl of chili paste. Just realized that a bowl of hot Chinese mustard would have worked too. If I wanted to serve the tenderloin hot I'd accompany it with some kind of Asian noodle or rice with grilled vegetables marinated in soy sauce and rice vinegar. A salad option is green beans steamed the day before and marinated overnight in soy sauce, rice vinegar,sesame oil and sesame seeds Yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuum.

Very tasty and easy! I served this with jasmine rice to which I added ginger, garlic and scallions. This made a beautiful presentation as well. A keeper.

I never knew it was this easy to make delicious Chinese food. I will never order in again...well, maybe after my next baby is born :)

This was excellent with just a little tweaking. I butterflied the tenderloin and marinated it for about 6 hours in the 'For barbecued pork' ingredients. Then I grilled the tenderloin on my Weber for about 9 minutes on each side, let it sit covered for about 10 minutes, sliced, and served it with the sauce and cilantro.

A very bland, uninteresting recipe. A waste of good pork.

I made the whole thing: the pork, the garlic sauce, and the noodles. It was TOO SALTY! And I even used low sodium soy sauce. If you're remotely salt sensitive, you should skip this one.

The pork comes out tender and very moist every time and with a wonderful flavor from the hoisin glaze. I did not make the garlic sauce. I've served the pork hot and at room temperature and it is delicious both ways. Couldn't be easier.

Rating: 3
Pork was amazingly tender and juicy - I loved the hoisin glaze - and would let it sit in it before roasting next time, boyfriend found it a bit strong, but he's not super fond of hoisin. We both panned the garlic sauce, too overpowering (though using prepared crushed garlic might have contributed to that).

Was out of ketchup, so used sriracha hot chili sauce instead. Made a delicious, spicy sauce, but will probably try the sauce with ketchup next time.

I've made this dish so many times, i can't count. It's great. I also recommend pulling it out of the oven a bit early as it will get to the right temperature after sitting out for awhile. I always skip cooling the pork and the final garlic sauce...it really does nothing to the dish, and honestly it's better warm using only the hoisin sauce.

Didn't care much for this one. My first inclination was to grill the pork - sorry I followed the recipe instead.

For the cook in Tigard: The word ketchup (or catsup) comes to us from China via Indonesia, Holland, and Britain. If you go to a well-stocked southeast Asia store you will find all kinds of Ketjap (Dutch). My pantry currently holds Ketjap Asin and Ketjap Asin, two different varieties of soy sauce. While you probably won't find any tomatoe based varieties under this label, we can acknowledge the British and Dutch for much of the inventiveness in changing the ingredients of Southeast Asia cuisines to suit the availability of items once they returned to their native soil. As far as differing results from a recipe, a group of friends and I have experimented extensively in this area. We have taken a single recipe, purchased identical items in the same store, and then cooked a given recipe on the same night, in one of our homes. The taste differences were amazing!! We attribute this to individual cooking styles. Precision (or lack thereof!) in measuring ingredients, heat levels, frequency of stirring or degree of agitation, and many other factor seem to have a profound effect on the outcome. So if you don't seem to get the desired result, analyze your methods, experiment, and create your own unique result (or give up, pass on to the next recipe and try again).

With all the rave reviews I thought I must've done something wrong, but, I followed the recipie exactly. The pork was tender but the flavor was too sweet and when exactly did ketchup enter into the world of asian cuisine????? I should have known.. I found it a bit odd. Actually ended up chopping up all the tenderloin for pork fried rice as tomorrow's dinner. Hopefully the odd flavor will disappear into the rice.

This was great. Served the barbecued pork tenderloin and garlic sauce over white rice beside a cold sesame broccoli salad (also from epicurious). Nice blend of flavors and hot/cold. I marinated the tenderloin in the hoisin BBQ sauce for a few hours before roasting. I pulled the tenderloin out of the oven after 35 mins when the temperature got to 155F. It increased to 160F while resting on the cutting board for five minutes before slicing. My guests and I agreed that the pork was perfectly done. I was a tad generous with the hoisin in the BBQ sauce as well as the chili oil in the garlic sauce, but mostly followed the recipe as written. Because the grocery store was out of cilantro (corriander garnish), i minced some parsley, mixed most of it in with the rice and then used the rest as a garnish over the pork and garlic sauce. It was a wonderful meal.

This pork is delicious and fool-proof. I have made this recipe a number of times and always get pats on the back. I brine the pork for 2 - 3 hours before cooking and then, after draining, brush some of the hoisin mixture on and let sit for another hour. The brining insures very moist meat. Instead of roasting in the oven, I fire up the BBQ grill and pull the meat at 150 degrees and tent with foil for about 10 minutes. The temp will rise to 160 degrees. I always double the garlic sauce recipe because it is such a big hit. I serve the sliced pork over udon noodles tossed with a little rice vinegar, sesame oil and light soy sauce, then topped with sauteed chopped red, yellow and green peppers, green onions, and snow peas. Top with toasted sesame seeds. Excellent!

A friend has raved about this recipe for years and when I finally tried it, I knew why. It couldn't be easier and everyone loved it. I made it with rice and oyster-sauced broccoli. Next time I'll try the vegetables.

Easy & delicious! I marinated the pork in the barbeque sauce & grilled it (turning & basting often). Served with rice & sliced cucumbers, chilled in rice vinegar. I cut the garlic in the sauce only slightly--very yummy. Next time I'll try the noodles & vegetables suggested.

This was really good! as much as I love garlic, I thought there was a little too much. Next time I will omit it from the pork sauce. What i did that made a great presentation was to thinly julliane bamboo shoots and mix in with the garlic sauce to make a salsa like topping. Will definetly make agian.

Fantastic! Truly delicious and so easy. Based on previous reviewers' comments, I doubled the hoisin sauce using half for the roasting process and reserving the rest to use as a sauce. I am delighted to have a new weekday item to add to my repertoire. It takes only 3-4 minutes to make the hoisin sauce (and most of that is mincing the garlic) so by the time your oven is preheated it is ready to go! Be sure to line your pan with the foil as the recipe recommends to make clean up a breeze. LOVE IT!

WOW, this is our new summer party food. I marinaded the meat in the barbaque sauce, which I doubled in quantity,for a couple hours before cooking it. The meat just melted in our mouths. We prefered the hoisin based sauce over the garlic. Added cold sesame noodles as a side dish!!

I have made this recipe twice now, and it has been a big hit both times. I added Sambal Oelek instead of Tobasco sauce. We like it spicy. I also had to make extra garlic sauce the second time, because everyone wanted more. I laid the pork over rice and had steamed broccoli on the side!!

The barbequed pork was tasty, but we found the garlic sauce too overpowering. Next time I'll make extra marinade and skip the garlic sauce.

If I had to put it in one word, it'd be "Excellent". I will never get take out again. Very simple, very garlicky, and VERY tasty! I could make this at least once a week and just do my own variations. A MUST try.

Very simple and very good. Used honey instead of sugar, and marinated the pork for several hours to better infuse the flavour.

My fiance and I loved this dish!!! We both like spicy food, so I added a little more chili oil to give it more zing (and zing it did!). We will definitely make this again!

My boyfriend and I both thought this tasted really good. I made it because I already had everything in the house (except for hoisin, but I just used extra ketchup). The pork was good by itself but the sauce was nice to drizzle on the rice and wilted spinach I made with it. I actually think it's pretty easy to make pork tenderloin taste good. Anyway I'd make this again since the ingredients are simple and available.

The sauce was a little overpowering and the dish was a bit on the sweet side. It's okay but I would not make it again.

Kids thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread. My two older boys ate the pork with the garlic sauce, the younger guy without. Easy to make; I've made it three times and will make it again!

I thought this was excellent but doesn't quite taste like the BBQ pork in Chinese restaurants. I marinated the meat the night before. A meat thermometer is essential (to 155 is fine because the pork will rise 5 degrees when resting). I thought it was actually better served the next day. Perfect for a cocktail party since you can make it the day ahead, slice it up, then simply remove it from the fridge 1/2 hour before guests arrive. Oh, and I didn't make the garlic sauce but made twice the marinade which cooked with the meat which I poured on top after slicing. mmm...

This is the second time I have made this recipe. The first time I just had potatoes and veggies and the pork, BUT!, this time I made the noodles and everything that the recipe asked for and Oh My Gosh! We have enough left over for lunch tomorrow and we can't wait. Rate this recipe 4 forks for sure. Thank you.

Made this for finger food for a Super Bowl buffet. Excellent! I followed the recipe exactly except I brined the pork loin for 3 hours before I roasted it. Brining assures a very moist and flavorful meat. The leftover pork will be used in Udon Noodle Soup tonight!

A quick, easy and tasty dish! It was great over udon and served with a mixture of broccoli, water chestnuts and red peppers (steamed with some garlic then tossed with soy sauce and sesame oil and toasted sesame seeds sprinked on top). We roasted the tenderloins on the "not hot" side of the grill with some moistened deadwood from our peach tree. Moist and delicous! The sauce is fantastic. This was a hit, even with my picky 3-year old.

I thought this recipe turned out really well and had many complex flavours. For the garlic sauce, we added some extra soy and rice vinegar and this seemed to cut the harshness and made the sauce go farther too. I didn't make the noodle recipe that went with it, but instead used some steamed noodles and this picked up the drizzled garlic sauce. The cilantro on top was very refreshing and zesty, I would recommend this and will make it again.

Unique and excellent flavor. The garlic sauce gave it a real "kicky" accent. Reheating it the next day in the microwave got everyone at work talking.

This was okay but definitely not a make-again dish. I added some chilli sauce to the barbecue sauce and it was still not super. But, a decent and vaguely interesting substitute for purchased char siu. I _might_ make it again as a filling for buns, but probably not as a main dish. Definitely make the garlic sauce--without it, the pork is dry and too sweet.

My husband and I have made this dish many times, for our family and for company. Everyone loves it. We always serve it with Kohuko Rose rice made according to the recipe in The Modern Art of Chinese Cooking (a superlative cookbook), by Barbara Tropp . . . the type of rice we use plus her directions produces a "sticky rice". We tried the noodles mentioned in the recipe at one time, but didn't like them.
