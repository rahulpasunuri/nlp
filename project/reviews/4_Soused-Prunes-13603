I made a half recipe, ommitted the allspice and added a star anise and 3 whole cardamon pods. The pecans were added alongside instead of using them as stuffing. These were liked even by avowed prune haters. Next time I will try apricots for Christmas gifts. This would also made a great get well gift for anyone recovering from surgery and on opiates. :-)

Since 2001, when I first commented on this recipe, I have found numerous ways in which to use these tasty morsels. They are delicious on plain yogurt, a nice addition to cereal, and offer a nice dessert after lunch. Sometimes, I give jars of soused prunes as Christmas gifts. I have found, however, that you need not cook the prunes but 15 minutes. Also, dried apricots partner well with prunes and they add a bit of color to the jars. The apricots need the full 25 minutes cooking time -- sometimes longer -- so watch them closely.

In answer to how to use: with turkey, chicken, goose, duck or pork, on the side, it sounds wonderful! I must try it....

I would taste how sweet it is and if it's sweet, it could be wonderful in porridge. It's just a guess...

This sounds like an interesting recipe. If I only knew how to use it! Any suggestions?
