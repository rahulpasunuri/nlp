I made this recipe last night with a few substitutions due to availability of some items (spinach for arugula, grape tomatoes for cherry tomatoes, and I cooked the chicken myself rather than have it prepared), and it was amazing! My boyfriend loved it, and I will definitely make this recipe (with the original ingredients) again! It had all the right flavors of spicy and sweet (with the tomatoes), and there was plenty to use for lunch the next day, since it was just the two of us eating four servings.

This recipe is outstanding and a great method to experiment with as well. Made this last night for company and got rave reviews. A definite keeper! I did make my own chicken breast, pan seared and then finished in the oven to get to temperature. Benefit of this method...chicken fond in bottom of the pan added a little extra love to the sauce. Feta is brilliant..adds the perfect finishing touch.

Loved this! This will be my "go to" summer recipe. I did the tomatoes & chicken early in the day then brought them back to room temp before making pasta. Next time, I will use spinach instead of arugula to make it more kid-friendly. I think some fresh mozzarella instead of feta would be outstanding also!!

Like another reviewer, I had quite a few cherry and grape tomatoes and wanted to roast them..sort of followed recipe except I used alot more Arugula, and used freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Also whole wheat pasta(ziti) And at the very end sliced some pepperoncini(vinegar peppers) Very happy with this meal.

Gigantic winner. Surprised how good and how essential the garlic is. I skipped the chicken, increased the feta by half (50%) and will be more judicious in my pepper flakes, as I went just to the other side of picante, into hot, maybe also because of no meat to absorb the spice. Perfect for Sunday night after a crazy weekend, modern comfort food.

This recipe was very disappointing. I tried it for a dinner party because of the positive reviews but found it nearly inedible due to bitterness and general lack of flavor. Made for an uncomfortable meal, since I was worried about my companions having to eat this unpleasant dish. I do not recommend it.

Woke up this am...was wondering what to make while I was looking at some tomatoes sitting on the windowsill......decided to roast them for a change and stumbled upon this recipe....is all I can say is "Wow"!!!!!!

This recipe exceeded my expectations, even with all the great reviews. I didn't think it could be that wonderful with so few ingredients and such a short amount of time- but it was. My only changes: I used grilled chicken breasts and amped up the garlic and pepper flakes. Quick and delicious with rich, deep flavors.

This dish was just wonderful. I used chicken sausage instead of the roasted chicken, but the feta really made it.

Loved this recipe! I chargrilled chicken breasts that were marinated in Wishbone and seasoned with Montreal Chicken Seasoning and garlic powder. I followed the recipe and I must admit ..it is a winner. I did season the tomatoes with oregano and basil along with red pepper flakes and I added a yellow pepper) I was not sure if my husband would like it however he absolutely loved it! I will definately make it again. Last note, I think it needs more red papper flakes then the recipe calls for just to give it a little kick.

This was really good! I didn't have 6 cups of Arugula so I made up the difference with baby spinach. Added about a tsp. Smoked Spanish Paprika and about a half tsp. of dried oregano, crumbled, to the tomatoes when I mixed them with the chicken. Salted to taste just before mixing in the greens and pasta. Other than those changes I follow the recipe to a "t". My husband and I loved this and I definitely plan to make it again.

This is hands-down my family's favorite staple dinner. I have made it as stated (it's delicious) as well as substituted asparagus or sugar snap peas for the arugula (more texture) and once used well browned sausage instead of chicken. You cannot go wrong. I just made it for friends while on a ski vacation. Big hit. Easy and delicious! Great leftover. Highly recommended.

Just tried making this again. This time I used 15 count shrimp instead of chicken and it was AWESOME. Next time I'm going to try veal.

Thanks to the cook from Pittsburg for the advice to double the garlic and the hot pepper flakes. Also, I didn't want to buy an expensive and fatty roasted chicken at the market and I had boneless skinless chicken breat in the freezer, so I used that instead. I marinated the chicken for a couple of hours in Greek Salad Dressing and then grilled and shredded them. I used a little chicken stock in place of the bland pasta water to help wilt the arugula. I also added a few oil cured black olives to the serving plates. Finally, I used reduced fat feta and couldn't tell the difference. This wonderful recipe is definatly in "The Rotation"!

This was so good. I used whole wheat pasta and added lots of dried herbs de provence to the roasted tomatoes. I also didn't have enough tomatoes so I tossed in some baby carrots (it's what I had in the fridge).

I have made this a few times now. I make the following alterations and it is delicious. I use sliced roma tomatoes instead of cherry and season the tomatoes with oregano and basil while roasting, spinach instead of arugula, also roast red bell pepper with the tomatoes. The Roasted reds really liven up the flavors. We always use whole wheat pasta and it tastes great. Also, I just boil some chicken breasts and then shred it. I made it for a work potluck and everyone went back for seconds. It takes me less than 45 minutes to make and makes for great leftovers. The actual recipe was a little bland. I highly recommend this recipe as a basic for personal alterations.

I did what one of the reviewers suggested, added more garlic, crushed red pepper, and tomatoes and it was delicious. However, the friends I cooked for are spice wimps so they couldn't handle how much kick there was in the pasta. I was especially surprised how much 'sauce' came from the tomatoes.

Rating: 4
As suggested by another, I increased the garlic, tomatoes and roasted with rosemary. My wife often is critical; not here. It was zippy (she's a spice wimp), flavorful and filling. It's going to become a staple quick meal for me.

Rating: 4
I decided to try out this recipe again, as it was good, but not great. I used double the garlic and crushed red pepper and added 1/3 more tomatoes. When roasting them, I threw in a sprig of rosemary (to be removed at the end), and lots of fresh cracked pepper and sea salt. Also, I left the garlic in their respective casings, to be squeezed out once they were roasted. I used chicken strips sauteed in olive oil and italian herbs, as roast chicken was rather pricey, but I'm sure the roast chicken would have been great as well. As written the recipe is a 3 star, but with the smallest of changes, it's a 4 star!

I ate this for dinner earlier, my boyfriend and I both enjoyed greatly. I used a spinach penne, since I love veggies. I'd like it to be a little saucier, but that may be due to the fact that I halved the recipe? I added broccoli, since I already had it, and added a bit of spinach, as I didn't have enough arugula. Don't skip the roasted tomatos/garlic, it is exceptional.

This was a big hit in my house. I used grilled chicken breasts instead of roasted chicken and fresh spinach because my roommate doesn't like arugula and it turned out wonderful. I had to fight for leftovers!

I have made this recipe for 3 casual dinner parties and every time it has been the highlight of the evening. It is simple to prepare and is light and delicous. MAKE SURE TO USE TRADITIONAL FETA (NOT FRENCH) THE FRENCH FETA IS TOO LIGHT AND DOES NOT ADD THE "SALTED" FLAVOR OF TRADITIONAL FETA. A nice addition to this meal is the "three cheese garlic bread" recipe featured in the Jan 2006 Food and Wine.

Superb. Made this for a small dinner party and got many compliments. The red pepper adds a nice bite. Sprinkled the feta and re-covered the dish so that the cheese softened....excellent. Easy too.

A very tasty, simple dish that's perfect for the work week as is. If you had more time, I think that roasting/sauteeing your own chicken would improve the flavor. Also, adding grape tomatoes instead of cherry tomatoes is way yummy.

My picky husband LOVED this and so did I! We used about 2lbs of roma tomatoes, quartered and then did the recipe exactly as stated, with probably less pasta because we like ours a little wet. Will definitely prepare this again as I am now grilling two chickens at a time on my new rotisserie for my grill. The chicken turns into quite a few meals using this web site!

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out wonderful! I thought it would be dry but it was very saucy and delicious. Do not over cook the pasta though, it will be mushy. The flavors all blend together beautifully and made this a new favorite for us!

This was a perfect mid week dinner and it re-heated beautifully. It took longer to prepare than I expected but it was worth it. I added a little more spice than the recipe called for and substituted the greens for spinach. I'd definitely make this one again.

This is excellent, easy and quick to throw together. Oh, and very healthy. I substituted spinach for the arugula and it was fine. My husband and I thought the chicken would taste better if left in pieces rather than shredded.

Simple, easy and WONDERFUL!! I can not wait until my cherry tomatoes are ripe so that I can make this again. The only change I made was to gently remove the skins from the tomatoes when they had finished roasting it was very quick and easy to do.

Delicious, yet simple week-night supper dish. We received two gorgeous bunches of arugula in our CSA delivery and this recipe did them justice. I put a small chicken in the oven to roast while prepping the other ingredients and finished roasting it along with the tomatoes, creating a fantastic garlic/chicken/tomato roasting smell.

This recipe is so simple that I feared it would be bland and I almost decided to add some additional ingredients and spices to enliven it. Fortunately, at the last minute, I decided to leave it alone and see what it was like. I was pleasantly surprised with the simplicity of this recipe, which produces a lot of flavor. My wife said that this was a "company" grade dish, and I agree with her. I found some reduced fat feta at the store and it worked well in the recipe, further reducing the fat and calorie content.

I'm making this again with chicken breasts. The first time I made it with leftover roasted turkey and it was delicious, I also used spinach instead of arugula. Everyone in the family enjoyed it including a 6 year old.

I absolutely loved this recipe. A delicious combination of flavors, and very easy to prepare. Use your own judgement on the amount of feta. I used a bag of baby arugula and it was fabulous. Good leftovers, too! I can usually think of additions or substitutions but this was superb just as written.

In all fairness, I did have to do a few substitutions, but even so, the dish was very tasty. Cherry tomotoes were $5 a basket, so I roasted hot house(halved) instead, used spinach instead of arugula, and lots more garlic. Also added broccolli and fresh dill. I will make it again according to recipe this time!

My husband hacked into my recipe box and found this recipe to make for my birthday. He prepared exactly as written. My birthday was three weeks ago and I am still raving about my b-day meal. We love feta cheese so we doubled the cheese before serving and then added our own to our individual servings. Delicious!

I made this for dinner last night for the first time (2 servings) and it was absolutely delicious. I made a few modifications to quantity of ingredients. I used boneless breasts, rather than purchasing pre-cooked chicken, that I seasoned with poultry seasoning and roasted with the tomatoes (1 pt grape size) with ~8 large cloves of garlic & oil. I also used about 3/4 cup of herbed feta cheese and ~1/2 cup of pasta water. The results were great.....this will definitely be in the keeper file.

When I tasted it initally(before the feta) it wasn't anything special, but once the feta was incorporated it was great. I doubled the amount of garlic since I love garlic. I couldn't find arugula, so I used baby spinach. I also baked my own chicken so I could spice it the way I wanted. My friends loved it.

I substituted spinach for the arugula as that is what was on hand. Easy recipe and very tasty, although I would not serve for guests because of presentation. A definate keeper!

Definitely a keeper. The higher ratio of chicken and veggies to the pasta makes for a tasty and healthy meal. Not as good leftover since the freshness of the arugula gets lost - so eat it all the first sitting!

Made this with a large poached breast (cooked in broth), one 12 oz pkg of tomatoes, 2 garlic cloves, 1/3 t flakes and about 6 oz of penne for 2 + servings. Also substituted goat cheese for feta and it was very good for such little prep. Easy, low fat dinner that I recommend.

We really liked this dish. I think the roasted tomatoes made all the difference in the world. I only used a 1/2 tsp of the red pepper and found the spiciness just right.
