I've made it a few times already, changing up the greens each time and always having good results. Fennel is amazing in this!

I used 4 cups of chicken broth instead of 6 cups of water. I think 6 cups of liquid would have been way too much. Really nice soup.

I enjoy this recipe. I make it a tad healthier by substituting veggie broth for the oil and butter, and I also add chopped celery root and mushrooms to the recipe to give it a "meatier" texture.

Enjoyable soup...would have liked it to thicken a bit by adding some bread crumbs during the pureeing process. Added seasoned crostinis when serving helped do the trick as well.
