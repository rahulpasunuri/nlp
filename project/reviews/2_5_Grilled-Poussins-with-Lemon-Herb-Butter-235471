I don't have a grill but roast these in my oven and they turn our fabulously. I've made this recipe twice for company and everyone always raves. The butter not only flavors the poussins but also anything you serve it with. You can make the lemon butter the day before, prep the birds the day you're cooking, and pop them into the oven when your company arrives since they only take about 35 minutes to cook.

This recipe was not too bad. The herb butter was good, but I think more lime would give it more flavor, and if I made it again, I'd salt the birds liberally before roasting and add lime juice to the pan juices at the end. The poussins provide a good one-person portion and nice presentation, but were I to make this again I'll do it with a regular roasting chicken. Too much work to eat the little poussins while avoiding the bones, and the smaller birds have more skin:meat ratio than a full grown chicken. The taste is the same.
