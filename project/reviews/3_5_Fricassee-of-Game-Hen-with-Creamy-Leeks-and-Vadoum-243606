An exotic twist on comfort food. We have made it twice already, and are preparing it again for company next week. It may take longer than some recipes, therefore not a week-night meal you merely throw together after work. This is however a rewarding dish worthy of your time. (I actually enjoy the process of making the vadouvan, and am looking forward to it as well as the amazing aroma that fills the house!)

The Vadouvan was a job to make but freezing it is worth it. The flavors in this dish are wonderful. I served with black rice. It looked and tasted smooth. I have made this dish twice and served it for special guests.

I found the spice blend difficult and time consuming to make, but well worth the effort. The black rice complemented the leeks well. The fricassee itself was quite pleasant, though certainly not earth shattering. I think I might add a little more vadouvan next time to try and make the flavors more pronounced.

the flavors in this recipe are very subtle. If you prefer Mediterranean food (like me,) this is not the recipe for you. I found the dish to be rather bland for all the work. If I were to do this again (which I won't,) I would add some curry spices to the sauce in addtion to the vadouvan.

Simply scrumptious. I cheated as I was cooking for two only on a Tuesday night: used curry powder instead of the spices in the Vadouvan and cut cooking time considerably. Don't know what the real thing tastes like but curry powder worked really well as it has exactly the same ingredients. I will certainly make this again (and probably keep on cheating).

Terrific Indian flavors. Vadouvan was the only difficult part, but recipe only uses a small portion and it freezes well. Next time will be much simpler.

This was very time consuming to make, but the flavors were outstanding. The vadouvan is well worth the effort. It adds a unique depth of flavor. It is nice that it can be made a day ahead. The Chinese black rice was unusual and had excellent flavor.
