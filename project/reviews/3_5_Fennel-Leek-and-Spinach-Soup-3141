Very delicate, delicious soup & very easy to make with my new immersion blender! I modified it a little bit in order to minimize the sodium for my mom: 1 package of low sodium chicken broth -- the other 2 cups were just water. Inadvertently, but thankfully, I caramelized the leeks & fennel by not stirring it enough & that added a delicious sweet flavor to the soup. I used a lot more spinach -- I couldn't figure out why the recipe called for so little. And the soup handled it wonderfully. Very filling, very delicate flavors, good hot or cold. My mom added a chopped boiled egg to hers & some shredded cheese. She said it was even more delicious that way. I'll definitely be making this again!

One delicious soup! I cannot make enough of it...my kids love it! I usually triple the recipe just so that I can have enough to serve (my kids invade the pot and eat bowl after bowl before it ever makes it to the table)!

I have made this recipe many times, often for guests, and everyone LOVES it and requests the recipe. Sieve it??? Why??? It is absolutely delicious as it is. No changes needed. I use a hand blender and puree it right in the pan. It is as smooth as the time I put into blending it. But even if a few spots aren't that smooth, I don't see how that is a negative unless you have a problem with texture.

Because I happened to have leeks, fennel and spinach I needed to use up, I made this last night, to surprisingly rave reviews from my boyfriend who usually balks at green foods that aren't accompanied by cheese or meat. I tweaked the recipe slightly: Since I had no meat on hand, I replaced the chicken broth with homemade vegetable broth (just onion, carrots, parsley, garlic and the scraps from the vegetables used in this soup). To make up the richness of flavor chicken would have lent, I splashed some white wine into the vegetables toward the end of simmering -- plus I added a little milk and a lot of black pepper during pureeing. Contrary to a lot of the comments here, I don't think the soup needs straining to be smooth; just puree it very well. Straining would take out much of the substance of the soup and waste a lot of good vegetables, I think. As it is, it's delicately flavored and textured but surprisingly filling; with wheat crackers, it was our entire dinner. I might add more spinach next time, or add it later during pureeing so some chunks are left; I might also cut down on the amount of butter used.

Excellent! I found this recipe because I was looking for something to do with leftover leeks (I used the light green part in this soup) and some fennel left over from a great salad I had made for a dinner party last week. I read all of the reviews, and as a result simmered the vegetables a little longer. I pureed them and chilled it for a day because I needed to buy the spinach. This evening I blended the vegetables again and added the spinach to the last batch, then heated through. I do think I may sieve it next time, especially for a formal dinner, but the flavor is divine! Don't know why one cook didn't have a lovely green color. Not enough spinach? Not fresh? Don't know. It is beautiful.

Following the recipe as written, I ended up with the "cream colored with bright green bits" that a previous reviewer noted. A trip to the blender on "liquefy" fixed that, to the other noted beautiful green color. The texture was a bit muddy and would probably have benefitted from straining, but I didn't find the flavor exciting enough to warrant the extra work. Everyone ate a helping at dinner, declared it "okay", and then the leftovers languished untouched in the fridge until I put them out of their misery in the disposal. Wouldn't do it again.

Served this last night for my gourmet club. Delicious. Was prepared to strain it as recommended by others. However, I simmered the vegetables for 40 minutes instead of 20 (which also reduced some of the liquid). So, after pureeing in the food processer, it was perfect as is. Served with a dollop of soured cream and sprinkling of additional chopped spinach.

Definitely follow previous commented advice. The soup does get better with extra flavors. I added 1/3 cup split yellow lentils for some nutrition, but probably hurt the texture. Serve the day it is made. The soup was not good as a leftover.

So, like everyone else, I thought this soup was excellent, unusual and elegant (after straining). Question, though: what's this bright green color people keep mentioning? Mine turned out creamy colored with little bits of bright green spinach (that then turned dark green over night as they sat in the hot soup)... Also, a bit of advice: 6 cups of chopped fennel is about two big bulbs.

This soup was delicious but is in need of a few minor adjustments. I disagree that the spinach adds no flavor. It does, but even more importantly, the spinach gives the soup it's wonderful green color not to mention nutrients. Without the spinach, the soup would be more of a beige green color, not as appetizing. I also added sherry, nutmeg, a clove or two of garlic and a black truffle (because I had it in my pantry and with every taste of the soup, it seemed to call out for that truffle). After blending the soup as much as possible, I did pour it though a seive to remove any remaining pulp as another reviewer suggested. I agree that this step really gives the soup its gourmet status. With these revisions, the soup was truly to die for.

Fantastic and easy soup! I just made this for tomorrow's seder and I can't wait to serve it! I used vegetable broth with great results, except that it changes the color a bit so I added extra spinach to make the color more appetizing. Added some sherry to my "test bowl," making the taste even richer. Very healthy -- tastes rich but is very light. I will definitely make this again! (Bet this will also sneak some veggie servings into reluctant kids.)

I've made it twice in 2 weeks, soo simple & soo healthy. It's great, next time I may try adding something else to it...not sure what because it is good the way it is.

I love this recipe! I've made it numerous times: exactly as written, with variations suggested by other readers, pureed, chunky, etc. I find that I like it best pureed without the spinach and with a small amount of nutmeg. I make a big pot at the beginning of the week and have it as a first course all week long.

Found this recipe as I was searching for a way to use the leftover pieces of fennel I had from something else I'd cooked. I also used frozen spinich. I must admit that I added cream at the end which it just seemed to cry out for. It was a huge hit and tastes even better the 2nd day.

I liked this soup It was the perfect light first course for Easter. I didn't puree the soup though. I've made alot of pureed soups lately so I didn't want to get monotonous. But it was delicious. I added a few red pepper flakes at the end for kick.

After first making this according to the original recipe, I made a few changes which I believe elevate it to extremely gourmet status. I left out the spinach, which I felt added nothing to the flavor. After the puree, the soup seemed a bit pulpy. I poured it into a fine sieve, and strained it until it became silky smooth. I then put the soup back into the cooking pot and simmered until slightly thickened. The extra step made a significant difference in the texture and I would highly suggest doing it. All in all, it is a quick and delicious soup to make.

Made this for an Italian Easter dinner. We always had fennel on our table at Easter, so this soup was perfect. It tasted great too. I tried a sprinkling of nutmeg as well, and was really pleased. My guests loved it. I'll definitely make this again.

I followed the recipe though halved. Was very easy and quite good...fairly healthy with no cream though there is butter. Clean flavors.

I just made a half batch of this soup but I wish I had doubled it! So easy and so healthy I can't believe it's so good. Used butter and less fennel and more spinach, doesn't seem to matter... it's delicious. I'll serve it to guests with a swirl of sour cream...beautiful!

Really delicious & easy! I used butter for margarine, and although it's quite good as is, I added a pinch of ground nutmeg to my bowl which gave it a little more depth. We licked our bowls clean.

You must make this soup. It's easy and tastes elegant (hot or cold). Everyone I have served it to has raved, and it has a high taste to effort ratio. I always use butter instead of margerine, and have substituted collard (and other) greens for the spinach, and varied the proportions according to what I had on hand and it has always been successful.

I made this for the starter course at a Christmas dinner filled with wonderful dishes tat took me hours to compose, and guess which dish won "best of show"? This soup! Soup?? I ask you! I wasn't sure whether to be delighted or horrified, but I'm definately making it again.

Delicious soup. I substituted some of the butter for olive oil, and it was very creamy and tasty. It's very pretty, too. The spinach provided nice flavor and color. I used an immersion (stick) blender, so it was very easy.

This soup tastes like the yummiest bowl of hot cream and I made it with 3 Tbsp of olive oil instead of the butter! It's perfect in a mug in front of the fireplace but would be good enough for entertaining too. Every other soup I love has a bazillion ingredients and this is great and simple. Unless you forget to puree it till smooth in the blender like the last person.

I must be missing something. This soup had a strange consistency--pulpy seems like the best description. I thought the flavor was just so-so. I'm putting it in the fridge now and hoping the flavor intensifies overnight. I don't know what happened with the texture. Maybe the vegetables needed more cooking time to soften. Very disappointing.

A nice spring soup if you don't mind cleaning leeks.

This is one of the easiest soups i have made. It has a creamy taste to it without the fat of cream. A great recipe.
