If I could give it 3 1/2 stars I would, but the recipe deserves more than 3 stars. I nearly tripled the amount of lemon zest and even then the lemon flavor was not overpowering. I also subbed pecans for pistachios since I think they pair better with lemon. It's a very easy recipe and my colleagues at work loved the shortbread.

I was a bit worried about trying this recipe due to some of the negative reviews, but it sounded so good I made it anyway. It was outstanding! The only thing I did differently was that I dipped one corner of each shortbread in bittersweet chocolate after they were cooled and cut so they looked a bit fancier. I have already been asked to make them again!

Wow, I'm really surprised at most of the reviews. I didn't modify the recipe and it turned out great. It was slightly crumbly, which was a nice texture. This recipe is perfect with a good loose-leaf green tea. This recipe shouldn't be compared to shortbread cookies. Use high quality butter, brew a good tea and enjoy.

Came out tasting pretty good, but was excessively crumbly, plus any pistachios that poked up even a tiny bit above the shortbread got a little burnt. Lemon and vanilla flavours were very subtle, it tasted like plain shortbread with pistachios.

Really enjoyed these cookies. I made them a bit different and didn't use lemon zest and substituted the vanilla for almond extract. Yummy!!!

the pistachios are too bitter. another nut would be better, plus they are too sodt after being cooked. the rest of the receipe is awesome!

Simple to prepare, but really delicious. The lemon flavor & butter are a pleasing combo.

I added extra lemon at the suggestion of others, and I drizzled in a bit of milk before kneading to get it to hold together better. With those relatively minor (or at least easy) changes, the end product was delicious. I also made half a batch without the pistachios, and the lemon flavor seemed to come through even more -- mmm, maybe I'll triple the lemon next time... :)

I've made this recipe twice and have similar thoughts to those of the other reviewers. The first attempt was by the book, which came out dry and somewhat bland. My guests did enjoy the flavor of the pistachios. Several comments on the second attempt: 1.) Adding considerably more lemon zest and fresh lemon juice markedly improved the flavor. The juice helped reduce the dryness 2.) Roasting the pistachios beforehand with a few pinches of sugar was well-received 3.) Cutting down on the butter not only made the shortbread marginally healthier, but also helped the "crumbly" factor. Enjoy

It sure sounded good but this recipe was just so-so. There are better shortbread recipes out there.

I agree with Twify. It turned out really dry, more like a crumble that hardly held together. The taste is good but it's so messy to eat. I don't think I did anything wrong (even the oven temp is calibrated) so I will be looking for a different shortbread recipe.

I added double the amount of lemon peel to give it a more intense lemon flavor--served it to guests who loved it, as did I.

I had no other use for Pasta Flour. I used Rice Flour instead. The cookies were great!

Really liked this recipe. It was quick and easy. The semolina added a nice crunch.

Big disappointment. This shortbread was very dry and the pistachio flavor did not come through. I checked other shortbread recipes and the butter/flour ration of 1:2 seems pretty standard so don't know why the result was so dry. I'm sure I could tweak the ingredients and cooking time and improve the result, but why take the time when there are many other shortbread recipes that bring excellent results.

I didn't have pistachios;so used walnuts. Found it a bit dry; so added a few Tbsp. of cream. They were eaten before I had time to make the llemon pudding I had intended to make.[I live with 5 teenagers and husband]

Yummy! I served them with a slice of grilled pineapple, vanilla ice cream, and a drizzle of ginger syrup. A simple but elegant dessert that everyone loved. Of course they're scrumptious all by themselves too.
