It is very tasty, but not the thickness I expected. The flavors are there, but the crushed pineapple was not only unnecessary- it was weird. My husband I both agreed- no pineapple. We brought it to a luau party & served it with fresh fruit for dipping & it got a lot of good responses

This recipe is essentially glorified pineapple fluff. But given that, it's pretty tasty & good comfort food. You may want to go the traditional route and fold Cool Whip into the gelating mixture instead of whipping cream.

It is easy and everyone loves it. Great for the spring and summer.

This was my first time making mousse, it was so easy to make. I would definitely make this for a potluck, as an alternative to the typical cake or pie desserts. I only made half the recipe, and thought the cream-fruit ratio was too high. Next time I would lessen the cream.

Very good flavor and guests loved it. But, I wish I'd taken the advice of a previous reviewer and whipped 3 cups of cream instead of 2 - I know it would have been smoother, more mousse-like. Next time....

Light and pretty. I used coconut extract rather than vanilla for a "pina colada" mousse.

I made this when my mother-in-law asked me to bring the jello at Thanksgiving. It was an impressive Jello dish, to say the least. I would make it again! Good flavor, easy to make.

Thought this was good, very flavorful, but wasn't anything special. Sort of tastes like something you would buy premade.

Listened to other reviewers and added 1 extra cup of heavy cream, texture was more mousse-like, also added 3 extra tablespoons of Sicilia lemon juice which added just the right amount of tartness. Big hit at the Memorial Day picnic.

At first I thought the Jello taste was going to overpower this mousse and taste too artificial. When complete, I think the pineapple overwhelmed the lemon. I used whipped evaporated milk instead of whipping cream to add more nutritional value, and I think the texture was fine. Maybe less crushed pineapple would be better.

I used orange-pineapple Jell-o instead of lemon. Having read previous reviews about it being stiff, I increased the whipping cream to 3 cups so that the mousse would be more creamy - the texture was very nice.

I'm with Santa Cruz, this was a little too stiff for my liking. It DID have good flavor, but with the Jell-O it becomes more like one of those aspic salads made with gelatin, rater than a true mousse texture....... At any rate, my friends said they enjoyed it! KIMBER

I made this mousse for a party. The guests who either couldn't have, or didn't like, chocolate particularly enjoyed it's sharp fresh fruit flavour. It is neither too sweet nor sickly. An excellent spring or summer pudding.

I thought the mousse was very tasty, but a little too stiff. I used pineapple Jello instead of lemon, trying to recapture a friend's favorite childhood dessert.
