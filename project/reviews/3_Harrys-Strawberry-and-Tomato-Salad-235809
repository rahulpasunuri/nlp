I have made this recipe twice now to bring to a strawberry social and a bbq. It was enjoyed both times. Easy and very fresh tasting.

I love the marinade of the tomatoes and strawberries, simple but delicious. It was great, but my guests had two complaints. 1. The buter lettuce seems dry and bland compared to the delicious tomatoes and strawberries and next time I think I will toss the lettuce in the marinade as well 2. There was too much lettuce. You could easily use half the lettuce
