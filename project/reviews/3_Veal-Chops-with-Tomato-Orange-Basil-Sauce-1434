This sauce is too sweet for veal in my opinion...it might work with chicken...may try that.

This was very easy to make and very good - Mine didn't remind me of creamsicles ... maybe because I didn't add the last bit of orange peel (even though I had it ready to go). I thought it might be too much orange. Also, I grilled the chops with olive oil, s&p....this receipe couldn't be easier!

This recipe is delicious and easy to make. I didn't think my husband would go for it with the citrus added, but I won him over! He really enjoyed it!

I have made this several times, but with boneless chicken breasts. Very good!

This was a bit on the sweet side. The sauce reminded me of the creamsickles of my childhood. Perhaps it would be a bit more interesting with a splash of balsamic vinegar.

This was a lovely dish. Next time I may try adding some chopped prosciutto to the sauce. This was so easy and delicious that I will make it again - maybe with cutlets.

WOULD NOT CHANGE A THING. FABULOUS FLAVORS. RAVE REVIEWS.
