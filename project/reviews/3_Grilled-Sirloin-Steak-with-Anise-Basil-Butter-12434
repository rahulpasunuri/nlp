Anise overload. The butter is nice and worth doing, but the anise crust is unnecessary and a bit disturbing. And, really, I can't imagine the average casual diner being happy to see a side of grilled fennel with this...how about something more complementary rather than supplementary.

if you like vietnamese pho, you'll like the flavors in this. just make sure to go very easy on the anise seeds - they're very strong. i had anise extract, so i omitted the seeds and substituted a drop or two of that. i also added green onion and skipped the fennel. thought it was a nice way to make a different steak.

I thought the anise would be a really lovely unusual accompaniment to the sirloin, unfortunately it didn't do much for me. I still think traditional salt & pepper with either garlic butter or Gorgonzola cheese makes a tastier steak.

I used a flank steak instead of the sirloin - great result. The anise basil butter gives it a lovely flavor. Incredibly simple to make and very very tasty. Great weeknight recipe as well. I really enjoyed it this one!

These steaks were very tasty and I got great reviews from my guests - picky eaters. That said, the fennel bulb didn't go over very well with them but I thought it tasted great with a good squeeze of lemon.

This is a great variation of an old favorite. I made this using Land-o-Lakes unsalted butter, kosher salt, & fresh tellicherry black peppercorns, fresh basil, fresh anise seeds, & a very good organic extra virgin olive oil. I cooked the 1 " thick steak on a small grill using mesquite charcoal briquets.....Fantastic!

Easy & Delicious. The Anise, basil and black pepper combined nicely. I thought it would be strange, but it wasn't. I pounded the pepper & anise seed into the steak w/ a meat pounder.

I made this as a second course to a shrimp risotto also found on epicurious.com. The steak was delicious, but the recommended accompaniament of grilled steamed fennel bulbs was a bit odd. I think that an entire bulb for each person is a bit too much. Next time I might cut the amount of fennel in half and substitute a more traditional vegetable. All in all, the subtle anise flavor of the meat was a great follow up to the shrimp risotto, a dish tradionally associated with anise.
