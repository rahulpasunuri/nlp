This recipe was fantastic! I would actually give it more like 3 1/2 forks. It was really good- the chocolate cognac cream was absolutely AMAZING, and the raspberry sauce added a nice touch as well. The only probablem I had was that the puffs did not rise in the oven as much as I had hoped they would... Perhaps better luck next time.

I guess nobody had the problems I did. The batter was so gooey I couldn't get it into the pastry bag without disaster and lost at least half of it along the way. And the taste was very dense and eggy. As far as the bittersweet chocolate sauce, it was VERY bitter. The whipped cream filling was a bit too strong (but better the second day). The saving grace was the raspberry sauce, which was not from this recipe -- a friend had given me "sauce" that was extremely thin and terribly sweet -- probably unusable for any other purpose besides syrup -- but it was the only thing that made this dish edible.

Fabulous! I made it for my wedding anniversary. Tasted almost exactly like the same recipe I had earlier this month at the Breakers in Palm Beach. I substituted Rum for the Cognac and it was still delicious. Also, it was surprisingly simple.

This is a recipe that I'm sure I'll make again. Yes, the raspberry sauce was rather tart & next time I probably wouldn't add the lemon juice (it might also be good made with strawberries). Overall, a really nice idea for a special dessert.

Very good! I did not make the cream, I simply filled them with french vaniila ice cream. Made the chocolate sauce which was ok. I've made better. Overall they make an impressive presentation.

This recipe was simple and elegant!! They cream puffs were so impressive when they were done that I was proud of myself before I had even tasted them. I piped my whipped cream out of a pastry bag and ran short of cream given the number of puffs I made. I think that the bag compacted the cream too much - I think next time I will either make more cream or try spoon the filling into the puffs. Overall a definate winner of a recipe!!

This was a very simple dessert to make but had lots of WOW! effect.

Very elegant presentation. I was really surprised at how much the profiteroles puffed up! The chocolate-cognac cream had too much of a cocoa-ey flavor, though. My guest knew immediately that I had used cocoa and not chocolate. I loved the raspberry sauce, although others thought it was too tart. Maybe next time, I will leave out the lemon juice. This is an elegant, easy dessert.
