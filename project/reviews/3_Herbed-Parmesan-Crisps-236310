Great new find, and SO easy! The only (temporary) hitch is, I baked them the day before, racked and cooled them, put them in an air-tight box -- and the next morning they had the texture of rubber tire. To my surprise and relief, rewarming just before serving both restored crispiness and furnished a small wow factor of warm nosh. But I don't relish having to rewarm things just as company is arriving. Otherwise, super.

I've made these a few times and have found them to be incredibly easy and tasty. I did make the mistake of forgoing the parchment paper on one occasion and had to throw away the batch as I could not get the crisps off my non-stick cookie sheet. Must use parchment paper!

Easy to make. I read the reviews saying it comes apart - grate the cheese on the thicker side instead of the finer. It will hold up fine.

I have made these on numerous occasions and they are always a crowd pleaser. I usually double the recipe if we are having guests. They are so simple but yet so good. We have tried different fresh herbs but prefer rosemary. Wonderful with a rose wine.

I made a low carb version by leaving out the flour and they turned out fine. Added some cayenne pepper and paprika for a little kick. After putting 1 T mounds on the parchment, I pressed softly with the oiled bottom of a glass. When they came out, I thought I'd made them too thin but when they cooled, they were perfect.

I didn't have any trouble with this falling apart. I used fresh parmesan and grated it in a food processor. Maybe because it grated it so fine, it mixed better with the flour. These were really easy, delicious, and the guests raved about them.

Came out great. Just don't make them too thin. Make them into the oval shape and try to spread the cheese in an even thickness.

Great flavor. Fell apart...I wonder what I did wrong. Will attempt to make again.

Something about these crackers didn't work out for us. They came out very crumbly, so perhaps we made them too thin. Couldn't serve these easily, but otherwise, they tasted great.

My boyfriend compared them to Cheez-Its, so if you're a fan, well then... I'd make them again (for him), but instead of trying to form perfect 4"x2" ovals, I'd make smaller, thicker crackers. Otherwise, they're pretty delicate and crumbly.

I made this tonight for a very important dinner with foreign dignitaries. It was a HUGE hit! Even more than the canapes I spent hours and hours on! The 'dough' is not supposed to stick together before cooked. The idea is they melt together to form the crisp. That's why you 'spoon' the mixture onto the pan. Best of luck, I thought it was a winning recipe, I hope you enjoy!

what a disaster! i was thinking about buying this cookbook, but not after this! like the reviewer before me, i followed each instruction, but the spoonfuls of cheese just crumbled. there's absolutely nothing holding them together. someone - please tell us how you made this work!

Is there something missing from the recipe? I've tried to make these several times -- with fresh and packaged cheese -- and while they taste great, the texture doesn't work. They're far too crumbly to pick up, much less serve to guests. Perhaps I'm missing something?

This was a fast and easy recipe, I made no changes. Next time I will try rolling them, the presentation would be better and it would be easier to pick it up off the plate.

The crisps were yummy, and couldn't be easier. I used grated parmesan from the box (couldn't find fresh at the last minute - I'll use fresh grated next time) and fresh rosemary from the garden...so quick that I made them before work for a dinner party that night. Just right before a lasagna dinner with a glass of merlot! I'll bet the flavor would stand up nicely with champagne as well!
