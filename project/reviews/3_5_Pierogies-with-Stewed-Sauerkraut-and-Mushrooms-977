Mary from Poland has it right ... this makes a good filling for the pierogies. And NOOOOO to adding baking powder to the dough! An egg, a tiny bit of oil, but not baking powder. Also .. nix the juniper berries and gin, for goodness sake!

I gave this recipe only 3 forks, because It's not giving all what is needed to have great pierogi. This what issaid in it is true, but only if you put this in pierogi. To make dou you need only flouer and very warm wather...mix it together till your hand will become clean, then spred it very thin and with glass make small circles. The biger circles, the biger your pierogi will become. Put on half of each cirle your mashroom and crout mixture, and then fold circle in half. If dou won't want to stick then use a little bit of wather as glue. Pierogi should be boild for 5 min. and they are ready to eat. Smacznego

This was the first time I made pierogies (which I made myself) and I didn't think it too hard, although my dough came out a bit stiff. The next time I will add some baking powder to solve that problem. I filled them with a mixture of pork, onions and mushrooms. Apart from that I liked the combination of the sauerkraut and the mushrooms very much, a nice change. I also added some crushed juniper berries and a bit of gin to it.

This was very good; however, next time I make this I will use less butter. I thought it would be difficult to get good sauerkraut without meat flavoring, but since I'm a vegetarian, I thought I'd try it. I would definitely make it again.
