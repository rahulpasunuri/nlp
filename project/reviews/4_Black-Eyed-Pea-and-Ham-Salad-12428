This salad benefits from overnightting in the fridge. I used canned beans but rinsed them out good before mixing in to remove a lot of salt and used low-salt ham (Boar's Head is our choice). It was destined for a pot-luck and it was a success.

I use frozen peas, since canned are too salty, on top of the salty ham. YUm

Yum! I've made this a few times, and it's always been great, but last night I found I was low on honey. Being Canadian, the first substitute I thought of was maple syrup. It made a very different, and very delicious, twist to this. I think I might try it with a good lean ham sausage, such as Mondare or a quality Kielbasa.

I just made this for a family BBQ. Everyone loved it and it was very very quick and simple to put together. I was in a rush so I ended up using 2 cans of black-eye peas instead of the dried. Great quick salad

I used fresh black-eyed peas and didn't really measure anything but my family was surprisingly receptive, even those who don't like black-eyed peas!

Good, but the ham was a little overpowered. I think it will be better tomorrow!

We loved it, comments, 'Outstanding!' Very light, compared to potato salad and so easy. I used rinsed and drained black eyed peas(2 cans), so I'm not sure it the proportions were correct. Offered the minced jalapeno at the table. Next time I want to make it by the book and double the recipe. Was great with barbequed chicken. Sadly, there were no leftovers.

Have made this many times, especially when I have leftover ham. Easy and good. A good recipe to multiply for a larger group or a potluck.

I really liked this. It made a good dish for an impromptu picnic. A nice combination of flavors, and it just gets better and better after a day or two. I love black-eyed peas, especially with ham.
