Didn't have any hazelnuts, but thought almonds might be good, and it was!

This was OK, but not terrific. I thought it needed another ingredient to take the combination from novelty to WOW -- but I don't know what it would be.

I have made this as a side dish a few times and it is always a hit. I experimented - turned the mixture into a pesto and served it with whole wheat linguini. The results were wonderful. Highly recommend.

Even the non-broccoli lovers asked for second helping of this! Definitely toast the hazelnuts to make the butter terrific.

This is a favorite in my house ... it is the only way I can get the kids to eat broccoli. They fight over who gets the last bits.

This was quite a hit at an Oscar party. The hazelnuts added a nice texture and flavor to the broccoli.

This was really yucky.

We did not like this. The hazelnuts didn't seem to work with the broccoli.

Delicious! Very easy to do, and such a nice change from green beans and almonds!
