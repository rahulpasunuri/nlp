Just made this for lunch, and it will definitely be a repeat recipe. I was worried that the vinaigrette might need sugar, but it certainly does not. I added apples, and next time ill also include pine nuts and dried cranberries (with better quality ricotta salata). Great base for work lunches.

After making this salad over 25 times, the 2 secrets to great results is to: 1. Prepare the dressing ahead, with an additional tsp. lemon, and allow the Shallots to marinate/"cook" in the lemon juice/oil mixture, thus mellow it, I have even prepared the dressing a day ahead. 2. Choose "young" Kale, they are shorter and slimmer then the "older" kale. Finally, preparing the entire salad a few hours before serving, keeping it in fridge, then taking it out, re-fluffing it and serving, will convert even the person who thinks they hate Kale, into a lover. Every time I serve it, I always get requests for the recipe.

Our favorite salad. Its addicting, so easy, amazing taste, super healthy, and goes with everything. The only thing I modified was adding 1/4 cup toasted pine nuts. Fabulous recipe.

One of the most distinctive salads ever, its become a stummer staple. I added 2T toasted pinenuts for texture, and increased the ricotta insalata to 4 oz. Even without the adjustments, the salad is marvelous.

Rating: 4
I loved this dish. I did make a couple of adjustments, though. I blanched the kale first (for two minutes in boiling water, transferring to ice water) to make it even more tender. Also I added a little fresh ginger. This tasted great. We used the leftovers the next day in a grilled cheese sandwich with some red pepper jelly.

So easy and healthy, it has become a staple in my refrigerator. It is better the day after and it keeps wonderfully for a few days. I love to add toasted pine nuts! I do it with curly kale also (sometimes the leaves are softer, and then is when the salad comes out best).

FOllowed this recipe to a T (doubled the kale) for a large dinner party. Guests LOVED it. Served it along side buttermilk marinated chicken theighs and drumsticks. Ensure your ricotta salata is high quality as well as the kale, they are the real stars.

I don't know what the fuss is about this. Though my husband loved it. The dressing was lovely and simple. I didn't have ricotta salata, substituting feta and parmesan cheese. We only had the curly kale, which is slightly more bitter than the Tuscan kale. I think it is important that the kale is as fresh as possible.

Ridiculously good and tastes even better the next day. So simple to make, yet such a delicious, hearty and healthy meal all by itself.

Wow. I've never liked kale and tried this reluctantly based solely on the excellent reviews. It's just ridiculously tasty -- I had to stop myself from eating all of it so we have some left for NY's lunch. I stuck pretty close to the recipe. I only used a couple tablespoons of olive oil -- it didn't seem like it needed as much as the recipe indicated. And I didn't add any salt since my ricotta salata was already quite salty. No other changes. This is the dish for anyone who doesn't like kale!

Love it! I was trying to replicate a fantastic kale salad I had at a restaurant and this simple dish is it! So simple and so good. I didn't have shallots so I made it with 2 minced cloves of garlic. Wonderful! Would also like to try it with the shallots next time.

This recipe is fabulous and forgiving. Made it with white onion, because it was what I had, half a lemon, and leftover ricotta salata. I was surprised at how delicious it was. Served it with steak. My teenage daughter went back for seconds and ate it mixed with brown rice. I can imagine it with quinoa as well. Also with pine nuts tossed in.

I made this tonight to go with some baked chicken and it was amazing. I used white onion instead of shallots because I had them on hand and I don't think it affected the flavour very much. I also just used plain old regular kale from the grocery store (it was 99 cents!). The ricotta salata (totally different from regular ricotta!) made it perfect.

Rating: 4
This salad is perfection. It lasts for days in the fridge -- not many salads I know of can. It travels well; I have made it for numerous occasions and it has ALWAYS been a hit. Any kale works, but the key is the ricotta salata -- get the good stuff if you can.

Rating: 3
I used the whole milk, creamy ricotta cheese instead. First I hand massaged the kale and the cheese together. When I say massage I mean I man handled those two food until I felt they where one. I find that it helps soften the kale. I added the dressing, continued to massage and then added raisins and a soft boiled egg. You might want to add something else, or nothing at all. I enjoyed this dish only because I changed the recipe all together. Maybe, when I find the ricotta salata, I will try it again as written. I let you know how it goes then, too.

Rating: 4
This was delicious. I hate reviewing this considering that I didn't make exactly as written, I didn't have the ricotta salata, however, I think this would be delicious with other cheeses. I used 1/2 c. romano and approx. 3 Tbl. feta. Nice change from the usual Romaine lettuce.

YUM! I am a recent convert to the joys of kale and was browsing through the various kale recipes on the site.

I served this at Thanksgiving to a non-gourmet crowd and did not expect them to like it--but everyone loved it. Easy, very fresh-tasting, and a great counterpart to sweet potatoes and so forth. It tasted pretty good for lunch the next day, too, after the dressing had more time to soak in, but I prefer it freshly prepared with the kale very crisp.

I juice kale for the nutrients but I HATE the taste. However, this salad was absolutely scrumptious. My husband and I ate it straight out of the mixing bowl standing at the counter. I needed to use up some asiago so I did that instead of the ricotta and it was wonderful. I imagine plain old parm would be great as well. Will definitely make this again. So full of healthy stuff....

Always a favorite! I would have skipped right over this recipe, but a friend suggested it and I have made it frequently in the years since. Just made a big batch with local spring kale and it reminded me how tasty this salad is. Don't be put off by the raw kale... it's truly delicious!

Excellent. I lightly steamed the kale in the microwave for a couple of minutes with the olive oil, shallot, salt, pepper, and garlic. Then I added the lemon juice and cheese. I used a roasted ricotta salata -- it was all the store had -- and it was excellent. Walnuts would be terrific; so would some caramelized onions. Everyone at my dinner party loved this.

I used ricotta salata and I must say the balance of flavors between the cheese, kale and lemony dressing was really fantastic. Ricotta Salata is also an unexpected change from goat cheese and other more common things. I would not change it a bit. What a great way to get kale into your diet. Great source of calcium for the women.

Rating: 4
Yum! This recipe is so flavorful and easy. I used feta instead of ricotta salata because I new I'd use it up. I also used a Meyer lemon (including the zest), and I'm glad I did because the feta made this salad strong enough without competing with a more tart lemon. This recipe is definitely going into regular rotation, especially as I have been looking for really easy, tasty ways to eat dark, leafy greens. I'll try it with hard-boiled eggs and toasted pine nuts next, that sounds fabulous.

Rating: 0
This was delicious and could have been and meal in itself, although it was fabulous with grilled lamb sausage. I used 3/4 tuscan kale and 1/4 Savoy cabbage. The cabbage added a crunchy, mildly-flavored and light aspect to the salad that complimented the dark, intensely-flavorful and hearty kale. I used the full amount of Ricotta Salata, the exact amount of dressing called for, and added about 3/4 cup warm, toasted walnuts. Spectacular!

I made this on a cold, wintery Sunday for dinner, alongside a baked ham and big pan of homemade mac and cheese. I used goat cheese and thought the salad was amazing. Then I took a bowl of salad to work each day the following week, slicing leftover cold ham on top of it. Don't skimp on the dressing. This recipe's a keeper.

4-forks, despite chickening out and blanching the kale for 10 seconds instead of making it raw. I also used a meyer lemon (don't forget to zest the lemon, it adds depth) and a daub of dijon mustard.

I couldn't believe how good this salad was, really a surprise and even my girlfriend who hates kale loved it. I added some anchovies to the dressing (I add them to most everything) and some sun-dried tomatoes to the salad for a little color. Halfway through we decided to go freaking crazy and we added some pine-nuts (we're like that). It would have been just as great without all the additions though. Will definitely make again.

This was delicious & I will definitely make it again. Stripping the ribs was a bit time consuming - so next time I will recruit my husband - :). I followed the advice of another reviewer & added carrots, hard boiled eggs & sunflower seeds and put it over brown rice to make a one-dish supper. Yum!

Surprisingly good and tasty way to add the health benefits of kale. Substituted red onion and nutty Gruyere cheese as I didn't have shallots & ricotta salata. I also added 2 T of diced beets. Beautiful color of the dark green kale, purple beets & red onion contrasting with the creamy white of the cheese. Used lots of pepper. Key is to thinly slice the kale to diminish its toughness. My new winter favorite salad!

I've made this salad several times and every time it's a huge hit and people ask for the recipe. I usually use more cheese, though, because I'm a total cheese junkie. Ricotta Salata isn't so hard to find, they usually have it at Whole Foods. I've also served it on top of rice and black eyed peas (hot or cold) for a full, simple, cheap, and delicious meal.

I was skeptical because of the raw kale factor, but this was fab. and I'm making it again tonight. I used feta cheese crumbled instead of ricotta salata (huh?where do i find that?). As a side dish we had orzo cooked in chicken broth, and by chance i mixed it together with the kale dish and that was lovely too.

I agree with beckmori - an exceptional recipe for kale, even more notable because it leaves the vitamin benefits intact. I prepared this during a large family 'get together and cook'; the original batch never made it to the table as people couldn't stop eating it. A second batch barely made it there (this one made with Russian kale). Most seemed to prefer it as a stand alone salad dish, but also as a topping for crostini. The hit of the day!

This is a flawless recipe, and a great starting point for new interpretations on raw kale. I just made a variation with feta, shredded carrots, raisins and sunflower seeds - it was beautiful and delicious, too.
