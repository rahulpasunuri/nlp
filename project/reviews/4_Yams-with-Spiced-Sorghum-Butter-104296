I have not made this yet with the sorghum syrup but have made it for past holidays using the honey and molasses mixture. It is simple, quick and really tasty. A really nice addition to your meal!

I thought this would taste very different from other mashed sweet potato dishes, but it was very similar to the usual Thanksgiving side-dish. Probably because the sorghum is a substitute for sugar-but much more healthy and sustainable! I took off the skins and mashed them. Put the dish back in the oven to melt the flavors together

Made for Thanksgiving, mashing the yams with the butter (only some, not all) - too too too much! Too sweet, too spicy - next time I'll leave it with just butter, salt, & pepper!

Excellent! The cayenne is a really nice touch. The rest of the ingredients are sweet enough that you don't even notice it's there, but then it comes out in the after-taste and it's like a nice little surprise. I haven't used the sorghum syrup yet, but molasses and honey are more than adequate. The first time I made this I didn't even have molasses but dark corn syrup works pretty well, too.

Fantastic! We started substituting yams and sweet potatoes for regular white potatoes years ago and this is a great way to spice up our old standby. I actually mashed the yams with a little cream and the sorghum butter and served it that way. Everyone loved it.

This is now the holiday standard in our house. We have been searching for a "grown-up" version of yams - this is it!

This recipe is quick, easy, and tastes GREAT. It's already pretty fast, but you can shorten the time to table by microwaving the potatoes for 3 minutes per potato, then baking in the oven for only a half hour or less.

This was great. I served it with bbq chicken, a great match. I didn't have the sorghum, so used the honey and molassas. Terrific.

This recipe is simple and super yummy. I had a lot of leftover topping, so I put in in a small bowl next to the tray of yams in case anyone wanted more.
