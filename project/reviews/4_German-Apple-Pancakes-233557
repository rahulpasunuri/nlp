My 8 and 6 year old boys love this recipe. They keep asking for more of it! This is close to how I remember it from the Original House of Pancakes.

yes yes yes, so good. i didn't want to cook them one at a time, so i cooked them on an open griddle. they ran run out to about an 8" pancake, which was fine. used the sugar and cinnamon mix but thought half the cinnamon would have been a subtler blend. next round will be 1/2 the cinnamon with warm maple syrup. experimented by putting 1/2 the batter into an 11" skillet and baking it at 400 degrees for 15 minutes.

We make these for lunch making sure there's one or two left over for Dad's breakfast. I usually have one large pancake going in the 6 inch skillet and then a few little ones on the large pancake skillet for the kids. The kids like the irregular shapes and it just takes a little extra care to keep the pancake together while it's still runny. Also, don't even try to flip these until the bottom is fully brown, they will fall apart on you if you don't!

My mom would make these when I was a kid. They are the best and the only type of pancakes I like! I use whole wheat flour. I butter the pan before each set, but definitely don't use 6tbs! Fresh grated cinnamon makes it something really special. Yum Yum Yum!

The pancakes turned out delicious, but I recommend the following tweaks. Recipe calls for way too much butter. I buttered my pan between batches and ended up using about half the prescribed amount. Also, if you're not-so-dextrous, like me, you use a bigger pan and make smaller pancakes (3-4 inches in diameter.) I used a 1/3 measuring cup to scoop the batter onto the pan, and ended making about 20 smaller pancakes. They're much easier to flip!

With all do respect to the poster below, but I know for a fact that Apfelpfannekuchen (there was an e missing) are made of flour, eggs, mineralwater or milk and butter and apples are added. That is the same across the entire country. Those made with potatoes called Reibeplaetzchen, Kartoffelpuffer and made of raw grated potatoes. Rosti's a Swiss speciality are made of 24 hour old grated Pellkartoffel (aka boiled potatoes with their skin)

I tried this recipe today and it's really delicious! I used spelt flour or ("Dinkle mehl" in German) instead of the usual all purpose white flour. The pancakes are light and tasty. In reference to some of the other reviews about apples being put in later and not in the batter, I think there may be some confusion. In Germany, particularly in our region of Hessen, there are 2 types of these "German pancakes." The first type " Der Apfel Pfannkuchen" is made with potatoes, almost like the Swiss "Rosti." The apples are added in slices ONLY when the batter sits in the pan. Cinnamon and sugar are sprinkled over later as preferred. The 2nd type " Der Apfel Kuchlein" is the type that is shown on this recipe. It is lighter and appears to be more suitable as a dessert or a light lunch. I hope this helps future cooks to better understand the differences ... maybe not so confusing :)

I agree with karlotte from Duesseldorf, growing up in a half German/half Chinese household, these are the pancakes my grandmother used to make with either apple or sliced bananas,right after the batter hits the skillet. I love these pancakes,total winter comfort food

This is a really great recipe!! My 2 and 4 year old devoured the pancakes. They each ate 5 leaving my husband and I not much left to eat

My mother-in-law gave me a copy of this recipe. I made a double batch for my son's video game party, the recipe card disappeared (I think someone liked it very much).

I made this recipe for my husband who loved it! I followed the recipe as described and didn't have any trouble flipping the pancakes even with adding the apples directly to the batter. I served them as dessert but think they would be great for brunch too.

These had a nice light lemony flavor, but they were really hard to make and took forever. I had to cook them at least 4 minutes on the first side to have a chance of getting them to flip without breaking into tons of pieces-- and since I only have one 6 inch non-stick pan that meant each pancake took 5-6 minutes.

I haven't really tried this exact recipe, but as a German I grew up on apple pancakes. Nobody I know adds the apples to the batter, but put thin slices on the batter as soon as it's in the pan, so that they still sink in a bit. Most moms let everyone add sugar or a sugar and cinnamon mix on their own plates. We never eat this for dessert!!!! (or breakfast) This is a lunch!!! And a kids' favourite, too :-)
