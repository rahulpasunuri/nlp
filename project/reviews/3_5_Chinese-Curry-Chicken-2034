Quick and easy, as advertised. I liked the suggestion of adding a little corn starch to thicken up the sauce, and I added some extra stir fry veggies along with the tomatoes for a little more color.

I have mixed feelings about this recipe leading me to feel I won't make it again...life is too short! It took a lot of chopping for the so-so results. It also asks for twice as much chicken as necessary. (I bought two pounds but decided to freeze the second one.) It makes a lot of food -- four very large portions. It made for a somewhat satisfying dinner but it can't be justified by all the work involved!

excellent recipe, easy to make and tastes just like Chinese take out. I made mine with minced beef too and served over long grain rice.

Very tasty dish. I substituted sherry for white wine but it did not make any difference to the flavour as it was a small amount anyway. It has nice colour and texture and produced a thick sauce that went well with rice. Depending on the curry you use it can be a spicy dish but as I like it that way I was very happy with the turnout! Would definitely make this again!

An excellent dish. It will definitely make it into the regular rotation. Substituted 1 can diced tomatoes for the fresh, added a jalapeno, and a little more curry. One of the things I like is that it is very easy to adjust to taste--more curry, a little cayenne for kick.....whatever you like.

I added mushrooms, and used a can of diced tomatoes rather than two fresh tomatoes. I thought it was great - plenty spicy enough and not at all too salty. I didn't add extra salt, though, just whatever salt was in the broth. My one and two-year olds both ate it up as well. Best of all, it's quick and easy to cook on a weeknight.

It's pretty good and tasty but not curry enough for me. I used two kinds of curry and I added oyster sauce to make it more authentically Chinese. It was a little too runny for me so I made it thicker with corn starch (that's how I like it). I would make it again.

This was good, but extremely salty. Make sure to include lots of taters. It's yummy the next day. It's a very different curry. Not yellow and not smooth. It's brown, brothy, and spicy.

Simple and delicious. I like to make a batch of it to reheat for lunches during the week.

I have made this type of curry before and have always found it to be satisfying. I believe the first recipe was from the Criag Clayborne/Virginia Lee Chinese cook book. But I have a question: What do you mean by "chili powder." This isn't as daft as it seems. There's an Indian chili powder, which is basically just ground dried red chilies, and there is Mexican, which wouldn't necessarily be out of place because the cumin that gives it a distinctive flavor is common in Indian/South Asian cookery. ??

I made this dish a few days after thanksgiving. I thought we could use a little spice after all that turkey. It was really good, I did not add the turmeric b/c it was only for the yellow coloring and not necessary for the flavor. I used canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh, it was great as well. I also used cayenne instead of chili powder. It was wonderful.

DELICIOUS.... Left overs were just as scrumptious.

I added mushroom, used a small can of fresh cut tomatoes instead of the 2 tomatoes. I also used cut up baking potatoes and it took a little longer for them to cook. No need to thicken it. I used 2/3 sweet curry and 1/3 hot curry, and it was nicely hot.

A handful of golden raisins and a few tablespoons of cream/yogurt give this recipie a more "authentic" flavor!

I really enjoyed this dish! I wanted a quick recipe for curry chicken........and this is it! Fast, tastey, and I didn't have a couple of the ingredients (white wine and fresh ginger) still came out great! I added more curry powder too! Smile. Enjoy!

I made this recipe for my husband who absolutely LOVES curry--and he absolutely LOVED this recipe! The only changes I made were that I only added about 1/4 of the ginger called for, added mushrooms as one of the other reviewers had mentioned, added about 1/4 to 1/3 teaspoon of cayenne pepper to zip it up a little, and thickened it just a bit with a solution of 1 tablespoon of cornstarch and 2 tablespoons of water. It went over really well with my family--it was VERY good!

This recipe shows promise. It came out way too salty on my first try so I added 3/4 cup of heavy cream to try to salvage it. The cream sure didn't hurt it and probably improved how the recipe is supposed to taste by adding a lovely richness to the sauce. I browned the chicken first before adding the other ingredients. I omitted the potatoes and substituted 2 cups of sliced mushrooms. Then I let the curry age for two days in the fridge and voila - it was pretty tasty! Next time, I'll probably add peas to the dish and omit the soy sauce or try a different curry powder (the Madras curry I used contained salt and that could have been the problem).

Added 1/2 cup plain yoghurt and some green peppers to give this receipe some substance, also thickened the sauce with cornstarch slightly. Not a great receipe?!

It was an excellent simple dish to make.

I had to put much more broth than they recommended for the potatoes to cook well. Skipped the tomatoes. It was okay.

I substituted rice and added more broth. Makes a delicious curried rice dish.
