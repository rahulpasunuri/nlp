The gravy's good. I made extra and threw it on some chicken breasts later in the week.

The gravy was great! I'm not a real fan of mushrooms but this tasted fabulous.

After reading some of the previous reviews, I almost decided not to make this recipe. I am really glad I went through with it. I found the gravy to be an excellent payoff for this meal that had my family raving for more! I did not find the preperation particularly difficult or time consuming - I mean, how long does it take to chop a few veggies and saute them for a couple of minutes? Roasting the meat was a snap. Pulling the gravy together at the end was no more difficult or easier than any other gravy. I do agree that the quantity of liquid was too much; I halved the amount of gravy I made from the recipe and saved the delicious broth base for a future recipe.

I had the picnic shoulder in the freezer and was trying to use it up; not a lot of recipes to be found out there. I cooked it in the CrockPot: browned first with onions and carrots and a little garlic, then threw it in the CrockPot with some chicken stock and let it cook all day. When I sauteed the mushrooms, I used a little white wine to deglaze them before I put in the reserved liquid (when I removed the meat from the pot, I poured the liquid into a saucepan and reduced it a bit). I served it with spaetzle and broccoli. A good dish but won't go out out my way to make again. The mustard flavor was perfect; esp. if you use a good Dijon.

Roasting the pork is the easy part. Preparing, chopping and going through the meticulous process of making the gravy is time-consuming and the payoff is not worth it. Some flavors (mustard) that are too subtle. I could have made a four course meal in the time it took to prepare this.

I do a lot of roasts and found this to be an easy recipe but the results were not as expected based on reviews of others. Used regular yellow mustard because I do not like other mustards. Perhaps this had something to do with it but since the recipe calls for only a small amount, I doubt it. The taste was fine and meat was tender but this just does not warrant a rave review. If I use it again, maybe will add more mustard. May also want to add a small bit of chili flakes at the end to liven it up.

I usely use my crock pot for this kind of cut.I prefer this recipe. The meat is very tender without being overdone and the sauce is light.I think it has the right amount of mustard.

To-die-for! My boyfriend and I loved this dish! The sauce is excellent, although I might cut down on the amount of mustard next time to give it less of a tang, although it's quite good with the tang!

Very good. Hadn't worked pork that still had rind on. Took me forever to get it off, but well worth the effort. Meat was very tender... fell right off the bone. Big hit, even with super picky father!

I'm not a big pork fan,but the sauce was awesome I'll definetely make this again but I'll make it with a different roast or even chicken,my husband loved it and he would like it again.I made mashed potatoes as a side dish and used the sauce over that as well.

This was pretty tasty. I ended up with a lot of leftover gravy and not so much leftover pork. I will probably cut the gravy recipe in half next time.

The pork was good, but the mushroom gravy was the most delicious I've ever tasted.
