This was fabulous, especially with our own organic home-grown turkeys. Doubled the sauce to have for leftovers.

A great, easy recipe and you don't need every ingredient under the sun. I cut the butter to about 3 TB with no ill effects. I ate the turkey and put the sauce on pasta for my vegetarian boyfriend. Will definitely make it again!!

So easy and flavorful. This will be a staple week night dinner. Highly recommended

I took the additional step of pounding the turkey cutlets between wax paper until 1/4" thick, and followed the recipe as written. The turkey was surprisingly juicy, and the sauce delicious. We enjoyed it over farfalle pasta -- even better the second day when reheated all together.

This is an outstanding cutlets recipe. My husband and I still think about it and as I was looking through my saved recipes I think I will make it this week. It's very easy to make and so tasty. I did cut back on the butter some and supplemented with olive oil (a little more heart healthy). Still great!

This dish was delicious! We paired it up with bow tie pasta and it was great. It's a perfect weekday meal since it was so simple and easy to prepare. I will be making this again.

This was fabulous! We really liked it and I omitted some of the butter as suggested. I used white wine instead of Marsala and also used chicken. Has anyone used fresh thyme? I also would like to double the sauce recipe. Has anyone tried doubling it?

Wow, what a great combination of flavors! I made this as printed and it just knowcked my socks off. Toronto, while I pretty much agree with you about garlic, I fell you may have missed out by not trying this recipe as is. It really is great. And while I also agree in general with all the comments made about butter, I really don't have a problem with it in this recipe, since it amounts to only 1 1/2 tablespoons per serving. I don't cook like this every night, and the flavor it adds here just seems worth it.

This recipe was easy and delicious for our low-carb diet. I substituted olive oil for half the butter, and salted and flattened the turkey cutlets before lightly dredging with flour. I am saving this recipe to my recipe box.

This was great and very easy. I made a few modifications. First of all, what kind of recipe doesn't call for GARLIC?!! I sauteed, mushrooms, 3 cloves of garlic and onion in a small amount of olive oil. I used half chicken and half beef stock for a richer flavour. I then sauteed the turkey scallopine in a small amount of olive oil with more fresh garlic. At the end I added the sauce back into the pan with the turkey (only cooked it 1 minute per side knowing that I'd add back in the sauce). The flour instantly thickened the sauce and it infused better into the meat by cooking it for another minute or so. You absolutely do not need all that butter - just a waste of added calories. This was just delicious. I served it with mashed potato muffins.

Good, but sooo unhealthy with all the butter!

Everyone raved about this dish. I served it over very thin and crispy homemade shoestring potatoes, and the presentation was excellent. It was definitely NOT a light and healthful dish, but it was packed with flavor, and it was delicious.

This is an excellent recipe. Very easy, consistently great results. I substitute a teaspoon of Williams-Sonoma Turkey Herbs for the plain thyme and just a bit of heavy cream at the end to create a silkier sauce. I like to serve the dish with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus. A full, buttery Chardonnay goes nicely with it. A tasty meal for weekdays or an informal dinner party.

solid recipe. definetly worth putting into the easy and tasty rotation. i added a little chopped onion to the saute, and a little extra wine to the sauce. pounded chix breast instead of turkey. would take steps to thicken up the sauce a little more next time. but all in all, just fine!

things that make this dish a 4 in my book- very quick for weekday nights & very forgiving- I didn't have marsala wine, so used white & some red; didn't have chicken broth, so used vegetable broth; substituted baby portabella mushrooms (yum!) & I didn't feel like measuring everything exactly, so I guesstimated & it turned out great! We served it with parmesan cous cous & green beans- definitely a repeat dinner.

I pounded chicken breasts for this, and cut the butter in half by using a cornstarch/broth slurry as suggested, and using 1/2 butter and olive oil to cook the chicken breasts.Also added a more marsala and let sauce reduce a little longer. The result was fabulous (though I'm sure more butter tastes better)!

This was superb! I used fresh turkey breast slices which did not need to be pounded. They were moist, tender and tasted just like turkey should. Served it with garlic and carrot mashed potatoes-WOW! The sauce is out of this world and we will enjoy in many other dishes as well.

I also used chicken instead of turkey, because I had it on hand. Everything else in this recipe stayed the same. I thought the sauce was wonderful with the hint of thyme! I will definitely make it again.

This is a very easy and quick dish to make in the middle of the week. We served it with spaetzle.

Delicious! Very flavorful sauce. I made this with turkey cutlets and my husband liked the texture of the turkey (I say this because I note the previous reviewer did not like the texture of turkey cutlets). However, I too would like to try this with chicken or veal cutlets. I used turkey because we eat so much chicken that I thought it would be a nice change. I think chicken or veal would have a better texture, but the turkey was very good too. I will definitely make this again.

This was excellent except I will not make it again with the turkey cutlets as the texture is too.........weird, like pressed meat. Will try chicken or veal next time. Made it exactly to specs, and the sauce was out of this world.

Used chicken, too. Moist, tender, and flavorful. A simple dish with a gourmet flair. This one's a keeper!

Like everyone else I substituted chicken breasts, pounded thin. By accident I used an extra cup of chicken broth, so I added it to the pan with the breasts and covered it. The chicken was incredibly moist and well seasoned. Wonderful! A great weekday dish.

Like others, I used pounded, boneless chicken breast. This is an easy to make recipe. Everyone at the table loved it. I used a little more marsala than called for. Served it with mashed yukon gold potatoes which were great topped with the extra sauce.

I also substituted chicken for turkey, however, I think veal would have been best. I served it with an asparagus risotto which was also very good.

I SUBSTITUTED CHICKEN BREASTS THAT WERE POUNDED THIN. SERVED IT WITH RISOTTO MILANESE, GREEN SALAD, CRUSTY BREAD, AND WHITE WINE. IT MADE A WONDERFUL DINNER!

I substitute chicken breasts for this one, too. Quick and easy. Makes weeknight meals a gourmet experience. Serve with flat noodles drizzled with butter and parsley and a salad.

This is basically a chicken marsala recipe, so I made it for a dinner party using boneless breasts which hapen to be on sale. Yum. Easy and delicious. Served it with orzo, green beans and a tossed salad. Great meal!
