Used marinated artichokes and added a bit of lemon juice and it has always been a big hit at pot luck suppers.

Not worth the work. Quite time consuming to prepare and then pretty boring in the end. Basically just a mass of vegetables; of which there are many better ways to prepare.

Very good as listed. Although due to personal taste, I think I will add some grilled chicken the next time.

I used canned artichokes rather than fresh. Flavors didn't come together like I expected.
