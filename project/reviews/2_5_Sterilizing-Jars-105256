The three forks is for the cook from Lawson. Take it on the road man!!!! I laughed, I cried, I ran. I'm sure it wasn't the boiling jar in my hand.

Ah, I love this website!! Cook from Lawson, MO!!! You made my day. We sterilize jars with the same results, but you put it in much better words than I.

It would have been helpful to have some information on the time involved to get that amount of water to boiling. Took a long time on my electric stove. As for the dish itself, my guests didn't complain, but I suspect it lacked something in the presentation.

Maybe I didn't boil them long enough, but the jars are still just as crunchy and tasteless as when I started. The sterilization was partly successful. The jars in my cabinet are reporducing exponentially, while the lid population is clearly on the decline.
