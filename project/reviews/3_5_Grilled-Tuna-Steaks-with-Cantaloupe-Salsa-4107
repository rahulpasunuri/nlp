Easy and fantastic. I made this for friends this past summer and all were delighted by it. I made the salsa in the morning, which allowed the flavours to mix nicely by the time I served it. I'll definitely make this again.

I will make this salsa recipe again and again to serve with fish!

Light and fresh. Use red onion, the salsa will look as pretty as it tastes. I also imagine that it could be delicious with pineapple added. Will try next time.

I just made this dish (with a few tweaks)and we absolutely inhaled it! It was quick and easy, and beautiful as well as delicious! We live rurally, so I have to use things I have on hand. I keep tuna steaks and peppers in the freezer so I had that. I substituted lemon for lime juice, and I used honeydew melon that I already had. I put the hot grilled tuna over a bed of garden fresh greens topped with cukes, green onion and feta. The beautiful salsa went over all and I garnished the plate with fresh strawberries. Outstanding!

Sadly, I tried to fix this in March in Minnesota and couldn't find a sweet, ripe canteloupe. I seasoned the tuna with ground coriander, cumin, and black pepper after brushing with olive oil, and it was wonderful. I think I'll substitute a sweeter melon, or use pineapple if that's not possible.

the Salsa was the highlight. better the second day. Next time I might add some other melon and maybe even some pineapple

This was a great meal - not cheap to make, but that's my only complaint! Quick, easy, and delicious. I served this with sauteed baby spinach; my husband and I both loved it, and we normally don't care for cilantro (don't skip it - it really makes the salsa!).

This salsa is nice; just be certain to use a fragrant/flavorful melon, as it makes all the difference. Easy summer dinner -- kids (4yrs & 1yr) love it, too!

Very easy and pretty -- husband made the fish, I made the salsa, we chopped everything up together. Paired it with red beans and rice and artisian bread --very delicious meal. Didn't use jalepenos; tasted just great. We used Old Bay seasoning on fish. We will definitely make this one again, and for guests!

This salsa was great! I served it with the tuna and also grilled chicken breast that I marinated in lime juice and soy sauce. The salsa was even better the next day.

The salsa is FABULOUS!! I didn't follow the recipe exactly - I trippled the amount of cilantro, doubled the jalepeno and used the juice of 2 limes. It was great. I thought the Tuna needed some more excitement than what is called for, so I sprinkled it with cumin, coriander and tons of black pepper and it was excellent. I will make this again and again...

I'm a huge fan of salsa with fish, so this recipe appealed to me from the start. I was a little low on cantaloupe, so I substituted some pineapple and tomato in the salsa. I also used blackening spices on the tuna steaks. Spicy with fruit salsa is excellent.

I never thought about using Cantelope when making fruit salsa - I served this at a dinner party with the Tuna and it was a HUGE hit! Since I never follow recipes to a "T", I used a red onion instead of a regular one and added a roma tomato to the salsa. Very yummy combination!

What a great recipe! I brushed the tuna with sesame oil and grilled them over mesquite. The salsa was fabulous! I give the salsa 4 forks, but the overall recipe 3 forks.

Very Good. I was looking for a recipe to use extra cantaloupe I had. At first the combination of onion and cantaloupe seemed a little strange. This, however, was very good. So my only suggestion for improvement is to make more salsa. :-)

I just wasn't happy with the tuna. I think that the cantaloupe and tuna contrast was a little stronger than I would have liked. However, the cantaloupe salsa was very tasty. I would definately make it again, but substitute another fish or maybe even steak for the main meat.

My husband loves to make his own salsa. We are rating this one outstanding in simplicity, taste and presentation.

Surprised my wife with this dish on a Saturday night. Got rave reviews. Right on with the prep time. Cooked the tuna for an extra minute or so per side. Added a dessert of pineapple pound cake with ice cream. A definite once a month recipe.

I used the following variations: Pepper the tuna steaks, leave out the salt. Sear the steaks in sesame oil one minute on each side (leaving the center slightly raw). Mix 1/2 c Lite Soy Sauce & 1/2 c Amontillado medium dry sherry (Harvey's or Dry Sac are best)and some diced ginger. After removing the steaks, bring the mixture to a boil. Dump in a bag of washed spinach, cover and simmer until the spinach is wilted and the liquid is somewhat reduced. Make a bed of spinach in the center of each plate, put the steaks on top, and pour remaining sauce over all. Garnish with chives, parsley, or fresh corinander (yum). The type of sherry you use makes all the difference for making this recipe truly great.

I selected this recipe because I needed a new way to serve tuna and I happened to have a cantaloupe in the house. I wasn't sure how the two were going to work together, but we all loved it! The salsa was not as sweet as I was expecting. The addition of the other ingredients made a very interesting and delicious combination, and a perfect accompaniment to the fish. A quick, easy, tasty dinner.

This is a favorite with my customers. We usually serve it with grilled swordfish, which we prefer both for taste and eye appeal over the tuna.

We are melon lovers and regulary eat grilled tuna, so this tasty and easy salsa was a big hit with my husband and teenage sons. Another quick no-fuss summer dish.

The fruit and tuna was not a combo my family liked.

I made this dish several times last summer. It's nice and light with very interesting flavors. The fruit and fish really work well together.
