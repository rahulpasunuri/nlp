This is definitely a recipe worthy of the cost and fat grams! As recommended, I toasted the almonds and added a tiny bit of grated garlic. The big change I made was to sear and cook the scallops in a little oil and butter, removed them from the pan, and then made the sauce in the same pan. Served as a main course with rice pilaf and garlic green beans. A great special occasion dish!

I tripled the recipe and it turned out soupy, but had a blend of nice flavors, thanks to the addition of garlic. Arrowroot powder was used to thicken it. I didn't have enough heavy cream, so a 3rd of it was milk. Instead of slivered almonds, I chopped some up. I served it over some thawed frozen cauliflower and carrots, and it turned out very nice. I didn't slice the scallops either since they were small to begin with. This was pretty quick and a success for my first time cooking scallops.

This was only okay as far as I'm concerned. I did the milk/cornstarch/gar lic alteration as listed below by other reviewers, and tarragon instead of parsley (which I think really added to the taste). I also added more brandy and worcestershire sauce than suggested. What I did not really care for with the scallops were the almonds (which I toasted). I just don't think the two go together very well. After doing that, the sauce was pretty good.

I made this dish this evening, but I'm not going to rate it because I changed a bit of it. I too substituted milk and cornstarch for the cream. Instead of a nice reduced cream sauce I ended up with a white sauce. The texture was not that which was intended. I didn't like the flavor, but I'm sure it would taste differently with the cream. When I make it according to the recipe, I'll come back and review it.

This was pretty good for how easy it was to make. I did not have heavy cream on hand, so I substituted 1/2 cup 2% milk with 1 1/2 tsp cornstarch worked perfectly. Not to mention the fact that it saved some calories! I served this as a main course over couscous and found it quite enjoyable!

FABULOUS! I doubled everything and then put on top of soba noodles. Using brandy and half and half made it delicious!

This was so easy and fast (a must with a toddler.) I doubled the recipe to make more sauce and used whole scallops instead of slicing them thin. then served the whole thing over angel hair pasta to make it a main course instead. I also added a cup of peas to make it really complete. My husband liked it a lot but the best critique comes from my 13 month old who LOVED it--she couldn't eat it fast enough.

This was a totally awesome recipe. If you want to make something special for someone, this is the recipe to make. I can't imagine anyone not loving it. We were tempted to lick our plates.

This dish is fast and easy. My young children, ages 1,4, 7 gobble this up. They get the fozen scallops; mom and dad get the fresh, plump ones!

My husband always said that he doesn't like scallops. Today I got bold a bought some. Made this recipe using 1lb of scallops and garlic\toasted almonds\sherry (instead of brandy) suggestions from other reviewes. Served as a main coarse with quinoa and guess who gobbled up 3/4 of it.

We made this as a main course. It was pretty good but not great, although I did make a few changes based on what I had on hand. I might try it again as written another time.

nice blend of flavors when the suggestions of toasted almonds and sherry are utilized. and this is one of those dishes that tasted better the next day for lunch at the office.

Made some substitutions and followed some reviewers suggestions...used pistachios instead of almonds since I was going to use another scallop recipe and already had them chopped! I used more W sauce than it called for since it seemed like it was calling for more. I think the scallops needed more cooking time but overall it was a good dish. Look forward to making it again with some other modifications!

This was great!! I took the advice of another reviewer and served this as a main meal with baguette (for dunking), a salad, and a nice glass of wine. Used Sherry instead of Brandy but it still tasted great. Definitely a keeper!

This recipe was so simple and delicious. I served it as an appetizer and got rave reviews. Next time I think I'll add a dash of fresh grated pepper and serve it over either pasta or black Japanese sticky rice

Grab a drink and enjoy reading all the reviews before you proceed. We made this as dinner for two using 1lb. of scallops and tripling the sauce ingrediants. We followed the suggestions of toasting sliced almonds, added garlic. We are this in bowls but would serve it over rice or liguini as it is very rich.

Fantastic! So easy, and so rich and interesting! Have made it for many dinner parties and always to rave reviews! You are going to want to serve it with a great french bread so you can soak up all the sauce. We just serve it with bread, salad and a nice pinot grigio!

An elegant and delicious first course, or great as an entree served with jasmine rice. I made it with the scallops in tact (not sliced as directed), and it came out great. I do this for special occassions, and it's a huge hit.

I was scrolling down recipes for scallops looking for a quick and tasty appetizer. I didn't review all of them but this certainly fit the bill! I thought the little ones wouldn't eat them but they chowed down.

For anyone attempting this recipe for the first time, all of the reviewers' suggestions are invaluable. Without them, I'd have rated this 2 forks or less. Slicing the scallops into 1/8-inch thickness, it seems to me, could easily cause them to fall apart. Mine, cut into halves horizontally, resulted in 1/3-inch disks, which was just right. I think it's imperative that the almonds (I used sliced rather than slivered) are toasted. The garlic is a good idea, also chives along with parsley. Keep the bottle of Worcestershire Sauce handy because you'll need it. You may also want to add some salt, and at one point I resorted to a few drops of Maggi Seasoning. I have a real aversion to salt generally, but this sauce would be unbearably bland without it. It seems to me that if you salt the scallops before adding them to the sauce, you would lose control over the saltiness of the dish, and therefore, it is probably best to adjust the sauce to your taste, and then add the scallops unsalted. All that said, it's a very tasty dish, but perhaps should remain an appetizer, as at the restaurant, rather than as a main course.

Loved this recipe! I had 3/4 lb. of fresh sea scallops so tripled sauce ingredients. I sauteed onions, added chopped fresh mushrooms, and chopped garlic to taste; also worcestershire to taste. I ended up adding all the remaining ingredients except for the scallops all at the same time (poor recipe reading skills) and simmered until thickened. I left the sea scallops whole and added to sauce as directed, cooked until just cooked through. DON'T OVERCOOK SCALLOPS or they will be like the rubber eraser on the end of your pencils. Yummy recipe and very quick.

Very tasty! I used vermouth (didn't have brandy) and tossed in some mushrooms and got good results. This was quick to make and was a hit! Would definitely make again.

Rave reviews from all seafood eaters. I used one pound of scallops. Adjusted other quantities and substituted sherry for the brandy. I would cut the almonds somewhat next time. I also added a little minced garlic along with the onions. It was great. Got 6 generous appetizer portions

Delicious dish! I substituted pecans for almonds and served it over wild rice. I used it as an entree for my husband and me, so I tripled the recipe. The portions were quite generous. I will make it again with pecans and add chopped dried cherries. This should be great with nutty wild rice!

This was good and simple. Added extra worcesterchire sauce and 1 clove of garlic, minced.

We were suprised about how light and flavorful this sauce was. The Worcestershire gave it a unique twist. We doubled the recipe and served it with wheat pilaf, which absorbed the extra sauce. We also skipped slicing the scallops thin.

Wonderful scallop dish! Toasted almonds were a great suggestion. We sliced the scallops in half instead of thinner. Being real scallop fans, we also added additional scallops and doubled the sauce recipe and served over jasmine rice. Easy to make and serve for a special dinner.

Wonderful recipe! I toasted the almonds, used 1/2 lb of whole scallops and served them in patty shells with jasmine rice, carrot sticks and lots of savignon blanc (in a glass).

I agree with the recommendation to toast the almonds. Also, I think 1/4 lb. of scallops for two people is pretty "light". I made it with 3/4 lb., and doubled all of the other ingredients but not the cream. Came out fine!

To intensify the flavor of the sauce, I would use a touch less cream. Next time I will try toasting the almonds before adding to the sauce.

I based my 4 fork review on the improvements that I made. I like to eat a little more healthy than the 1/2 c. of cream would have affored me. So, follow the recipe, making double the amount of sauce! Use low-fat evaporated milk, and make a little corn-starch slurry to thicken it up. DELICIOUS! Serve over rice, or dip some crusty French bread into it. Enjoy!
