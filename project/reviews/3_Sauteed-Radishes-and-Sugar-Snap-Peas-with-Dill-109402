I thought this recipe was quite tasty. I followed the suggestions of some of the other reviews and left out the OJ, added some vinegar (although I did not have champagne vinegar and used the rice vinegar I had on hand which was probably a bit too mild), and added garlic as well. I really enjoyed the buttery taste mixed with the unique flavor of dill.

Refreshing veggie dish. Great brunch accompaniment! Agree with one reviewer about the orange juice at the end. To brighten the final flavor I added about 1 TBS of champagne vinegar - melded everything together.

This is just so-so. It's a good use of radishes, but a waste when it comes to good snap peas. I would make this again because I have an abundance of radishes, but I would leave out the orange juice and create a more buttery/wine sauce for this dish. The OJ is just so overpowering and doesn't seem to go with the flavor of radishes. Dill is an off combo with OJ as well; I think it would be much better in a butter sauce.

I thought this recipe was good but not great, but I left out the orange juice, which might have made a difference. Does not reheat well.

I didn't have dill seeds, but all else was prepared according to the recipe. Very tasty recipe, as tasty as snap peas and radishes could be.

Excellent, needs a little more olive oil than caaled out. Also, garlic adds to it.

I have to admit that i was a little apprehensive about this to begin with, but really enjoyed it!! The dill was just right...not too over powering. It served as a nice fresh side dish to our very tasty fish. I agree with the previous reviewer that the radishes may do better if add a little later than the sugar snap peas, however I might have cut them too thin, but I liked them thin. Most likely, we will be making this again.

Interesting and different - I would just add the radishes a little after the peas - they were a little overcooked. I had never cooked radishes before. Beautiful dish!
