I forgot to say, I add a tsp of vanilla. I think it makes the recipe whole.

This is my favorite recipe to make for company! it is always a hit. I make a homemade raspberry sauce that compliments the creaminess of this panna cotta. My husband loves it with a chocolate sauce. Very very good and easy. A must try.

I found the texture to be too rubbery. I would make again with less gelatin.

The taste and texture of the panna cotta was very authentic Italian. I made this and served it with lines of a thick caramel sauce and strawberries. It was a hit with guests.
