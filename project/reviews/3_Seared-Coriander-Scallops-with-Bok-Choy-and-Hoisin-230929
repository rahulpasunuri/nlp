I thought it was bland. Used orange juice instead of concentrate which was probably a mistake. Coriander was nice but overall, I didn't think it was very flavorful or special.

The sauce was so easy and delicious and the coriander on the scallops enhanced the already great flavor. Serving it over bok choy keeps it light. Actually, I will served the sauced bok choy as a side dish on a regular basis.

I liked the cracked coriander coating, but I thought the sauce was a little too syrupy and sweet, and that the hoisin overpowered the scallop flavor.

Instead of using Hoisin sauce I chopped red chili peppers and garlic and added some soy sauce. I also added a little honey and butter when the sauce had reduced. I thought it was delicious.

I didn't think that this recipe was anything special. I love scallops, but this recipe left me unimpressed

Next time, I'll go easier on the coriander. That said, this dish does what should be done to scallops: it allows them to show off their flavor and texture by keeping the other flavors and textures straightforward.

Deceptively simple but absolutely delicious. I didn't change a thing and I'd serve it to family or company.

I doubled the recipe for my family, and used shrimp instead of scallops. Everyone enjoyed it.

i made this for my husband and I and we both thought it was great. Next time I would not reduce it as much because the reduction got really thick. Simple, quick and easy. I'm not sure it's up to company quality though.

I made this dish for my family (some are quite fussy) and it was a big, big hit. I was sure no one would like the baby bok choy, so I used snow peas in place of that. Everyone absolutely loved it and they are requesting to have it again! Delicious!!!

What a waste of scallops.
