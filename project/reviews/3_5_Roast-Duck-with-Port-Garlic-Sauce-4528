This recipe was alright. Nothing spectacular. I went with the cooking times and followed instructions and the skin didn't crisp up and the meat was way overdone. I wouldn't bother...many other recipes out there to try.

May be THE best duck recipe! Made it as-written, and came out great. Meat very nicely seasoned, and the sauce is wonderful. I'll try to adjust this sauce to use for chicken or turkey.

Excellent recipe everything about it was great. Sauce was definitely a bit of work, but absolutely worth it. Everyone loved it even a few guest who were weary of duck due to past overly greasy encounters. Cooked perfectly crisp and delicious. The one thing I did differently was poured two kettlefuls of boiling water over the pierced duck to tighten the skin and melt some of the fat out. Next time Ill try brining to push it over the edge, but as is it was nice and moist. Ill definitely make this again, thank you.

This was simple to prepare and the sauce was to die for - I could drink it! Not overly sweet like so many duck sauces tend to be. Delicious. Got raves.

Delicious - our roast also was done well before the time given. We did an hour and 15 minutes and it was a well done roast. The sauce was divine, we also had it with mash potatoes. Made the sauce while the duck was roasting, only did the initial boil for 45 minutes instead of an hour and it turned out fine.

Made this for Father's day yesterday and what wonderful flavors. Will do this again, I'm sure. Picked the meat off the bones after making my reduction (had some duck parts in the freezer I added)and added to my Roasted Garlic mashed tatoes - Overall a wonderful dinner. Spring greens with a Verjus vinaigrette. And a Barnard Griffin '07 Syrah rounded out the dinner nicely.

This was an excellent, easy recipe for an intermediate cook. I didn't think the sauce was overly hard, I just did something else while the sauce was cooking down (surfing the web). The only other opportunity I have had to have duck was at a 4-diamond fine french resaurant in the Canadian Rockies. I'm not going to lie and say it was as good, but it was pretty impressive to me and the husband. I have a t of trouble with the cooking time, my duck took abou 40 minutes longer than the directions, although I think I was using a slightly bigger bird.

I made this for Christmas dinner (it was just two of us, since snow interfered with travel plans). It had good flavor, especially the sauce, which was excellent. Very easy too, and I made the sauce the day before and it reheated fine. I also pricked the duck's skin the day before and let it dry out a little uncovered in the fridge overnight, to help the skin crisp. The only problem I had was that my duck cooked MUCH faster than the times given, and by the time I started checking the temp, it was already a little overdone. It was a 5 pound duck (as directed), and I think it probably would have been done to my taste after about an hour of total cooking. Also, I really doubt you could get 4 servings out of a duck, since so much is fat and bone. More like 3, or 2 hungry people could polish it off.

The duck was lovely! However, the sauce was not so much. I will make the duck again with the thyme mustard crust.

Rating: 4
I love duck, and this is one of my favorite recipes. I put the soy/mustard rub on the duck the day before and let it sit in the fridge overnight - it really helps intensify the flavors. Be sure to prick the skin as mentioned in other reviews- helps drain the fat. I have also made this recipe with duck breasts from wild duck - took the skinless meat and coated it as you would the whole duck- came out great as well. Yes, the sauce is a little time consuming, but it can be made ahead of time and I think is well worth the extra effort.

Rating: 2
It was a lot of effort -- boiling stock for 1 hour etc -- for only ok results. Recipe calls for too much soy sauce -- most of it runs off the duck. 2 Tbsp will do. Duck definitely needs more salt inside and out. I was disappointed that the duck skin wasn't crispy.

Rating: 4
This was the best duck we ever had. One modification we made was to roast the duck slowly: 250 degrees for about 3 hours (less with convection or speed bake) turning it twice, then at 425 for 30-45 minutes, turning once, to brown it. This duck came out crispy on the outside, moist and tender on the inside. It went great with champagne for New Year's eve, but a gewurtz would work also.

Rating: 2
Overall a decent meal but the sauce far too much effort for what you get.

Rating: 4
I've made this dish time and time again, and it's always a bit hit. IMHO it works better when you cook it with the whole duck rather than just the breasts, but that does tend to limit it to an intimate dish for two (unless you have a huge oven) as one duck is really only ever enough for two people. Try serving with garlic mashed potatoes and spinach / asparagus along with a good red wine.

Rating: 3
This was a hit for my New Year's Day family dinner. Very easy to make and the seasoning for the duck was what "made" this dish. Even my picky 3-year old daughter ate this with gusto! Although the port/garlic sauce was good, it seemed like an afterthought with the wonderful seasonings on the duck. I also made a Sour Cherry/Shallot Confit from another duck recipe to go with this (a better pairing, I think). One other recommendation: a robust red wine is a good accompaniment (although Epicurious recommends pinot noir, my local wine shop begged to differ, so we went with a nice Italian red. I was not disappointed!)

Mu husband roasted the duck on the Weber - indirect method - for about three hours. All the fat had dripped off, and the duck was delicious. I was not overwhelmed with the sauce. We did not have ruby Port so I used half Taylor Fladgate and half red wine.

The duck was flavorful and tender. The sauce is definitely a keeper. It is a good recipe to make on a cold afternoon when you really feel like cooking.

I have to say, after making this dish, I have taken the Port-Garlic Sauce (we LOVE it) and used it with another epicurious recipe "ROASTED DUCK BREASTS WITH FARRO RISOTTO AND DUCK CONFIT". It is more time consuming, but so worth it. Duck is so tender and flavorful. Start on a Friday for a Saturday dinner. So, I don't care for the roast duck in this recipe. After tasting confit, you'll never prepare duck any other way!

Favorite duck recipe

Rating: 2
Made the recipe almost exactly as is, except I used a convection oven, and so reduced the cooking time and temperature (25*/25% rule). Also drained off the fat when turning the bird. I was disappointed with this recipe. It smelled amazing while cooking, but the meat turned out tough and dry, and the skin was not crispy (likely due to the flipping 2x). Also, the sauce was missing an element--I think a herb like thyme or rosemary would have saved it. I might try this again, but with duck parts, and not turning them so the skin is crispy. And I'll skip the sauce. The garlic-mustard rub followed with a thyme-pepper sprinkle idea is genius though, and I will try it on chicken.

Rating: 3
The sauce is delicious (not for kids with a full cup of port). I did add a dash of thyme to the sauce but it would have been just as terrific without it. Start on the sauce before you start the bird. It takes a while unless you cut a shortcut with veggie or chicken stock. Be careful if you have a convection oven, which was my case. Put the bird on the second lowest rack and keep an eye on it. You will likely need to reduce temperature after 20 minutes to 375, and after first 45 mins, when you turn the bird, you may wanna go down to 350 and roast the bird a little longer, to ensure it doesn't burn. Simply watch the colour. The other option is to tent the bird loosely with foil and continue at higher temperature and shorter times, but still watching carefully. Use a meat thermometer to ensure inner thigh of the bird has reached 170-180F. I will likely pour off fat from the roasting pan half way through the next time. A lot of fat separates from the bird. While my oven is self cleaning, it's still a nuisance to have to clean it every time after making this particular dish. Use a deeper roasting pan if you have one to reduce spatter. Make sure you do prick the skin (not meat) with a fork all over. This really helps release the fat during roasting. Using large sauce/saute pans helps reduce sauce very quickly. Use gravy separator to remove fat from the stock before you start reducing it. I used honey mustard in place of Dijon. The meat was rich tasting and tender. Your best bet is likely to serve this with a light salad or steamed veggies, but don't offer a side that will compete for taste. When buying the bird, if it touches very soft on the back and chest, it means it's fatty (you can literally see your finger imprints). Try to pick a slimmer, younger bird.

Rating: 4
An elegant dish. Would make an elegant buffet dish. My first time making duck! Served it for Christmas. Be sure you carefully trim all the excess duck fat so you get a nice crisp skin on your bird. I froze the duck fat, thinking that I'll render it and try a Basque dish that calls for duck fat!

My first time making duck and it was amazing. So tender and juicy, my husband kept praising it all night and ate almost the whole thing in one sitting. Since we were spending the Thanksgiving just the two of us I decided that a turkey would be too much and made a duck. What a great idea! I didn't have time to make the sauce that came with the recipe but I'm sure it would only add to the overall taste. Will definitely make it again.

Rating: 3
A really delicious dish; a definite make-again. The sauce compliments the rub beautifully, and neither overwhelm the duck. Have also made using skinless duck breasts, roasted at a lower temperature. That worked very well, too, resulting in much lower fat content, and (surprisingly) was still very tender and juicy. Highly recommended.

We made this for dinner last night and it was amazing! It was the first time I've ever made a duck, and it turned out perfectly. The meat was so tender and the skin was just crispy enough. I cooked in breast down for 1 hour and then up for 40 minutes. For a delicious and easy side dish (and a chance to use the pan drippings): Saute mushrooms, green beans (dethawed), and onions in the pan drippings, add a little red wine to deglaze the pan, and sprinkle with salt, pepper, and thyme. (My boyfriend went back for seconds on the veggies and he never does that!) I also made the mashed potatoe gratin with chives from this website. It was an amazing meal!

I was surprized at how well this came out, with such a high heat setting. I used the many reviewers suggestions and it was moist and flavorful, although next time I think I will add ginger to the spice mix and the sauce. Two ducks gave enough for our family of five plus leftovers for lunch the next day. Terrific!

I have made this recipe three times and am completely in love with the sauce. I hate the amount of grease that comes off the whole duck, so I have started using only duck breasts. The skin gets crispy, as it should without the other parts we really don't eat anyway. Since you do not have the other parts (liver, heart, etc.) for the stock, I have purchased chicken parts to replace them, and I have not noticed a difference. I have also made the sauce to serve on chicken or turkey. You definately have to use port, for the sweetness of the sauce. Yummy!

Something definitely wrong with cooking method. Tough and stringy - not great - skin not crispy enough. Sauce was good seasoning should have come through a lot more interesting than it did. Given I used Brome Lake ducks quite a disaster for half a day's cooking. Any ideas for improvements? Perhaps Julia Child still had the "hands down cooking method".

I was disappointed that duck was tough and fatty. But it was my first duck and I think it was my problem w/ timing and scoring. I was going to steam first but then was encouraged by reviewers' success just roasting. Hmm, I'll have to work on it. Sauce was great -- I started w/ 1/2 chicken stock to make a new stock and reduced per directions. I skipped the mustard, and seasoned duck inside and out with thyme, S&P, and put onions & lemons in cavity, and flavor was good, it was just that texture (tough) and fattiness. Breast side down to start was good idea.

This is the first time that I give four forks to an Epicurious recipe. My husband and I loved the duck and the sauce... but the duck was so good we barely touched the sauce! We used duck fat to sauté the garlic, and roasted the duck according to the suggested time in the recipe. Great results!

Rating: 3
This is a fine recipe, but I can't believe it doesn't utilize the extremely flavorful pan drippings for the sauce. Here's what I did: After I removed the duck from the pan before serving, I poured off most of the duck fat (save it and roast some fingerling potatoes with it the next day - nothing's more delicious than duck fat!). I sauteed the garlic in the remaining drippings, added the port, reduced, and added the strained stock. Then finished and thickened it with softened butter, strained it again into the sauce boat. Incredible flavor and color! With this change, I'd give the recipe 4 forks easily.

Rating: 4
This is simply incredible! Instead of pricking the skin with a fork, I slash the skin and fat with a knife in a diamond pattern all over the bird being careful not to cut the flesh. This technique allows more fat to pour off the bird when it is flipped and hence you get a very nice crisp skin. I adjusted the time to 30, 25, 15 as someone else recommended, and it turned out perfect. Boyfriend said it was better than the duck he had in Paris at a 3 star restaurant. He didn't think that could be topped! I highly recommend.

I made this recipe for the first time for Christmas dinner with two ducks (I was cooking for five) and the sauce was awesome!!! I have some suggestions on sauce prep, though. Make sure you skim the stock, and definitely add a bay leaf. I added black peppercorns and a few whole cloves as well, since that's what I tend to do with most stocks. It was a big hit.

The port-garlic sauce was delicious. It was my first time cooking duck and it didn't turn out right...it was tough, meatless and dry. I either overcooked it or I had an old, skinny duck. I'm going to find another duck and try it again. I suspect my disappointment with this recipe is my own fault.

Excellent recipe. Cooked the duck breast down for 1 hour, then breast up for 1 hour. The duck skin was wonderfully crispy. Made extra rub to coat the bird when turning. The sauce was fabulous and went very well with fresh buttered green beans and garden tomatoes. We garnered fonds from the roast as it cooked and added them to the sauce to increase the flavor. Wonderful. Serves 2, not 4.

Making the reduced stock beforehand was great, I used that to make a blueberry cabernet sauce in addition to the port-garlic sauce listed here. My only complaint with this recipe was that the breasts didn't crisp up at all - and I was afraid I would end up with duck jerky cooking it any longer. I think starting breast side down is the key here.

The first time I made this dish was when it first appeared in December '97. I received rave reviews then, and still do. The only change I've ever made is to substitute Tawny for Ruby port whenever I couldn't find Ruby. My friends and family love my "specialty" (they should only know how easy it is to prepare!) and request that I serve it often.

I made this recipe for Christmas Dinner to rave reviews. I had made a practice duck a week prior, so I knew to make some changes. To the stock, I added a bay leaf and some thyme or rosemary. Also, I didn't reduce the port as much as they said. On the practice one, the sauce was thick and about a tablespoon's worth. Very easy recipe and delicious.

I served this dish (times 3) on Christmas Eve, and everyone raved about it. I left it in the oven a bit longer - until the skin was almost a mahogany color - and it came out crisp and scrumptious. I also served an orange sauce for the duckling a l'orange lovers, but the port wine sauce was favored by the duck connoisseurs of the group. Truly delicious!

Made this when we had guests yesterday. Like others have said, this duck is only enough for two. Although my husband and guests said the duck was good, I couldn't really tell as I ended up with the piece where there wasn't much meat on it and was struggling to get whatever there was off. Sauce was delicious. I will try it again using duck breasts as I like to have meat!

We loved this dish! Wonderfully flavored. My boyfriend is a duck connoisseur and he loved it, so we will be making this again for sure. I too added some herbs - thyme and a bay leaf - to the sauce prep. I used an average Ruby Port but next time might spring for a more expensive one to see if it makes any difference. The only thing I might do differently next time is reverse the first part and second part of the cooking, i.e. turn it belly side down for the first part, and up for the second and last part. The skin was somewhat crispy but I suspect it would be even more crispy if done that way.

The duck meat came out very juicy and tasty. The sauce was very rich and full of flavour. However, the primary reason I enjoy duck is for a crispy skin. All the fat needs to be rendered out. There are more exotic recipes, Asian mainly, that will perhaps make this happen, but consist of a lot of steps and practices that I frankly just don't have time for. This recipe, though tasty, to me just isn't worth the effort and expense without the crispy skin. Call me a duck snob, but there is a restaurant near my house who make duck perfect the way I like it, so it makes more sense to go that route. If crispy duck skin is not a huge requirement, then add a fork to my rating.

The sauce was great, but then I used a '92 Austrailian port, which obviously helped. As others have indicated, I will play with the times, because the skin was not as crispy as I would have liked, while the meat was done. I think it's a great dish to introduce people to duck.

1. I wuold give 3.5 forks. This is a truly edlicious dish. I cooked this duck for friends who are excellent cooks themselves, and they raved about it, especially at the tenderness and moisteness of the duck, and, of course, about the sauce. 2. I added a small "bouquet garni" and one clove for the stock. 3. In the ingredients, you could add, "softened" to the butter. 4. For a duck at room temperature, it was sufficient to cook 30 mns, then 25, then 15 mns.

First time I have cooked a duck and I thought it was a big success--the skin did get crispy, and everyone loved the sauce. I would leave off the last 15 minutes of cooking specified in the recipe, however--the duck was not dry, but was definitely well-done, and I think 15 minutes less cooking time would have made it a little juicier.

I love duck but wasn't real blown away by this recipe. I followed the recipe word for word (as I always do the first time) and just felt like I put too much time & effort into this dish, with not such a spectacular ending. In my opinion making the sauce was a waste of time. It's ok but not needed. My duck started developing a nice browned crust ontil I turned it (as instructed) and it chipped off. I never did get a crispy enough skin - which is my favorite part.

Most roast duck recipes are rather boring,as the recipes are limited due to the high fat content. This was exceptional and easy! Make sure you keep up the temperature (even though it may look very brown), to ensure the fat is cooked away and the skin remains cripy. Note: a duck only feeds two people, and not four!!!!!!!

My first time to cook a duck as well and I was amazed at how wonderful it was! My whole family loved it and although it does take a bit of time, it is not really all that much trouble. The sauce was delicious. My only problem is that for my family of 5, I really need to cook 2 ducks next time! And ducks have a lot of fat, so if you pull out every single bit you can find in the cavity of the duck it really helps.

We drank a rather good small production Merlot with this dish and really enjoyed it. I dropped the celery from the stock as I didn't have any which didn't seem to cause any ill effects. I used a smaller duck and reduced the cooking time accordingly & tested for "doneness" with a meat thermometer. The soy sauce colors the skin nicely and the duck was juicy inside. The sauce is to die for... I didn't reduce as far as the recipe recommends in order to get more liquid. I recommend melting the butter and adding the flour to that, then whisking into the sauce to thicken.

I have to admit I was disappointed. I love good duck, and although this was nowhere near the worst duck I've ever had, it was nowhere near the best, either. It is the first time I've tried to prepare a duck and I won't do it again...makes and incredible mess of the kitchen and is VERY time-consuming. Mine was way too fatty and still came out tough and overcooked--which I'm sure must be my fault; I'm just not willing to go through that again for so-so results.
