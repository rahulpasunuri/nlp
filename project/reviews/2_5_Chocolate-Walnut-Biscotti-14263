This recipie said it would yield approx. 36 pieces from two nine-inch logs, yet the dough only made enough for one small log, I had to double it. Also, not very sweet, more like a biscuit than a cookie taste.

I'm not sure why others have had a problem with this recipe. I doubled the recipe and made it with no changes. Buttering the pans made cutting and turning easy with minimal breakage....1-2 broke. Next time I'll make it with hazelnuts for the holidays.

The flavor is outstanding. I had a little crumbling when slicing, but that was the only problem. Oh, I did omit the walnuts.

The recipe needed more sugar, and although it did not crack while baking, it did terribly while slicing. The recipe probably needs more butter as well.

I would have to agree with the other reviewer--it fell apart, even after I followed the recommendation for extra sugar. I even added a little vanilla but the flavor was so so and despite the claim that it makes two 9 inch logs, I was only able to make one. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere, but it's definately biscotti, just not really good biscotti. Ahh, the search continues . . .

The "log" cracked, badly, and, after it cooled completely, could not be sliced with an excellent bread knife. If fell almost complete apart. It wasn't any sweeter than a crépe. If I attempted to make these biscotti, again, I would increase the sugar from 1/4 c. + 2 T. to 1/2 c. + 2 T.. That should firm the biscotti up and make them sweet.
