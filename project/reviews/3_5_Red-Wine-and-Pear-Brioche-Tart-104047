Am I missing something? Where does the sour cream go in? Also, my dough didn't double in volume. I still went thru with it, it's in the oven now! :) We'll see, but doubt success...

This was a wonderful treat. It was just as great for breakfast as for dessert! If anything the flavor got better the second day.

This was a delicious torte. The guests really enjoyed it. The dough tasted very nice and different with the yeast in it. And it looks very nice as presentation with the red wine sauce.

This was very tasty. I used Bartlett pears (not too ripe) and it turned out well. The dough was very sticky and a bit difficult to work with, but overall the recipe was easy. The crust did turn out a bit dry, but it wasn't overly sweet, so it tasted great with vanilla ice cream and the red wine sauce (which tastes like fruit, not wine). (I got the instructions from the magazine.)
