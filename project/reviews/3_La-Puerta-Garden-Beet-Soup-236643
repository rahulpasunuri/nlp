No thank you, and I love beets. There must be a better recipe for beet soup. Keep looking.

I've made this twice now - it is low-cal and delicious. Doesn't taste so beet-y, even though color is bright red. I froze some and defrosted - the texture wasn't as smooth, but it still tasted delicious when warmed up. I've been raving about this to family and friends.
