Good, but could be better. Next time I'll use more herbs (could barely taste them), a touch less broth (didn't cook down enough by the time the broccoli was done), and adjust the cooking time for the fennel (was too soft after trying to cook down the liquid).

I have to agree with a couple of other reveiwers. This recipe was good, but not great. It was a good way to use an overabundance of broccoli and fennel but lacked any interesting flavors. Perhaps some herbs and/or spices would help.

I did this as a side dish for an elegant New Year's buffet featuring lamb shanks and baked salmon. It matched both nicely and the colors added to the festivities. I steamed the fennel and broccolini (more florets with that) partially & ahead of time and then sauteed everything together in a wok five minutes before serving. The sweetness of barely cooked red peppers goes nicely with fennel.

This is a brilliant side or main. It is a refreshingly flavorful change from curries for vegetarians. I recommend the most flavorful olive oil you can buy. We used Oxo veggie cubes in place of the stock. The dish could stand a bit of chili pepper if you're looking for something with more of a bite, but add them carefully.

A good way to eat your broccoIi. And we love fennel. I skipped the bell pepper since we don't like it and used a poblano instead. I made this an accompaniment to the pork tenderloin with gorgonzola sauce (3 forks for that one). I wanted a veggie side dish that wouldn't compete with the cheese. It was perfect for that. I'll make this again but I'll double the herbs

This is a simple, healthy, and colorful side dish. The fennel delivers a punch. I also add a little garlic.

This dish is very good--if you're a big fan of vegetables, like I am--but it's not exactly bursting with the flavor. I found that by following the cooking directions, the fennel was too crunchy and the broccoli too soft. Next time, I will allow the fennel to simmer a bit longer before adding the remaining ingredients.

This is a nice way to dress up broccoli and still keep it simple. I made this for a dinner party of ten and everyone loved it -- there were no left-overs. I love the flavor that fennel adds to the dish and have since experimented with it and other combinations of vegetables. If you like the simplicity of plain steamed vegetables but are looking for a way to spice it up a bit, I'd highly recommend this dish.

Actually, this recipe was great! Each time I make it guests try to figure out what's in it. It's fast and easy and has a great flavor that's not overpowering. A perfect veggetable combination...

An uninteresting recipe. Do not cook this unless you have low expectations for vegetables. If you are a semi-vegetarian and know how good veggies can be, you will be disappointed by this recipe. I don't question positive comments on this recipe. Tastes differ. But ...

I really liked this recipe and will make it again. It was easy and loved all the ingredients.

Absolutely delish! I used white wine instead of broth. Served it over pasta. It was a hit!

I have made this twice and guests have enjoyed it each time. This can be made ahead of time and heated when needed. I blanched the broccoli in the micro as it didn't cook as fast as the other vegtables and was more al dente than need be.
