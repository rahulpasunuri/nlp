This was quick and easy. I don't eat tuna regularly, especially canned, I'm not a huge fan. My Boyfriend brought home a ton of canned tuna and I've been trying to find recipes that don't involve mayo (yuck). I added oregano and grated some garlic with the tomatoes. I also added some balsamic vinegar to the onions. After assembling the toast I put it under the broiler and melted some goat cheese on top.
