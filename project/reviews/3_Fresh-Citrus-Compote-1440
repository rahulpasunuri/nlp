I made a rather significant change to the syrup recipe and used 1 c. St. Germain liquer, 1 c. OJ, 1 c. water half the sugar, star anise and vanilla extract and served with oranges and grapefruit over pound cake. It was absolutely incredible! Since the other reviewers seemed to feel a bit lukewarm on this I thought I would share this idea as an alternate way of making, especially if like me, you bought a giant bottle of St. Germain to make a cocktail once and haven't used it since!

Used a cheap sweet orange/peach wine for the syrup- so it gave it a slight peach flavor as well. I used a rather large star anise, so the flavors transferred quickly and the syrup seemed to have plenty of taste after only 2 hours. I served the compote over plain organic yogurt for a relatively healthy brunch pot-luck contribution. Not a knock-out crowd favorite but a few people really enjoyed it.

I wasn't very impressed with this compote the first day. The second day it is much better, thoroughly chilled & with all the flavours properly melded. You do have to like the taste of anise. Even though you use only one piece, the flavour comes through very strongly.
