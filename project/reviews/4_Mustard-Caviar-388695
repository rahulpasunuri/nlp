LOVED this recipe. It really does have the texture of caviar, but tastes like sweet mustard. I served it with home made smoked salmon, it paired beautifully and made it feel so special. It would be great with all kinds of things though. It does take time, but it worked like a charm. It would also go with any meat you would pair with mustard, and would be awesome on hors d'oeuvres. Such a wow factor.
