This was a hit with my friends and family this past thanksgiving.

Love it. I've made it every Thanksgiving since it was published and it's always a huge hit. I love the contrast between the smooth mousse and the caviar.

This was just great. We found bulk fresh salmon roe at our grocers. We made 1/2 recipe and used the salmon in foil pouches. Used green onions, only dried dill and lower fat products. It still was excellent.

This was a hit at our christmas party with lots asking for recipe. I omitted the caviar but added a lemon dill sauce.

brought this to two different parties and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe!! very easy to make - we used the loaf pan. would definitely make it again.

I wouldn't even THINK of trying a salmon mousse recipe that calls for canned salmon. I can't believe a "chef" would either.

This is one I clipped and saved forever before I tried it -- now I make it every time we have guests. It's easy and impressive. It even freezes well. Though it's a lot, you can make it even if you only have a few people coming over - then freeze what's left in small portions and serve it any time.

I am currently Executive Chef at a 600+ member Country Club. I don't often use recipes, rather, I like to springboard ideas and adaptations from recipe names. But, I gave this recipe the benefit of the doubt. Big mistake!! I did not like the mayo or sour cream. The finished product was horribly sour, yuk! I switched the caviar for snow crab leg meat. Even the (quite good) roasted pepper vinaigrette I prepared as a garnish couldn't save this ill conceived recipe. I'm a fan of Bon Appetit, but this is a loser. Sorry, Kurt
