Terrific. In an effort to be good for Lent, we gave up chocolate fondue for this diet conscious soup. Wow, were we impressed. To spice it up we added jalapeno without the seeds. For presentation at our gourmet feast we served it topped with thin slices of hearts of palm, fresh basil leaves from our herb garden and a dollop of real sour cream(whoops there goes the diet). Yum!

Super easy and delicious! Perfect for those brutal cold winter days with its warmth and bright color. Great with garlic-rubbed grilled bread for dipping!

I doubled the quantity of carrots, deleted the fennel and leeks. Added one large sweet potato and piece of ginger. Moral of the story: this recipe is like Gumby, easy to mold to your whims or what's in the pantry. Delicious.

We served this as part of a multi course Easter dinner and everyone liked it. It's easy to make and has a rich uncomplicated flavor. We garnished with a 1/2 teaspoon size dollop of creme fraiche swirled in the middle instead of the thyme.

This is always a hit. I always garnish it with sliced scallions to give it some punch. I have also tried adding a cinammon stick during the cooking process and the results were great. Another garnish I have tried is ground pistachios. Both add a new touch to the standard excellent soup.

FANTASTIC!!!! Did alter a bit. Added 6 carrots and 4 cups of vegetable broth. (We are vegetarians.) It was wonderful. My husband and I devoured it. Will definitely make it again.

I used a bulb of fresh fennel in place of a leek, which I did not have. Sauteing the onion and fennel together on low heat for about 20 mins or so really brought out their natural sweetness. I followed the recipe very closely besides this substitution. I did not have any fennel seeds, but thought the fresh fennel imparted a good flavor balance with the carrots and thyme. Fennel fronds make a nice garnish to finish the soup as well.

Very easy and tasty recipe. I agree with the review that the soup is not very carroty. I used an entire tablespoon of toasted fennel seeds which really lended a toasty warm fennel flavor. Next time I will double the recipe.

I thought it was just me but my husband (and the cook from North Carolina) seemed to feel the same way--it was too bland. I just felt like it needed something else. I could barely taste the fennel seed or thyme. There are too many great soup recipes out there to try this one again

Good and simple. A tasty way to get your veggies.

WOW! I don't always take the time to review recipes, much less soup recipes, but this one was worthy. As suggested by other reviewers, I increased the carrots a bit and used 4 cups hot water + powdered bouillon in place of the broth, and dried thyme. My whole family loved it, from finicky teenagers to a 4-year-old! Only disappointment was that it didn't make enough..will double next time.

Made soup exactly as recipe dictated: phenomenal. Simple ingredients, easy directions, superb results.

This was a great and easy soup. I made the following substitions: used olive oil instead of butter (added a bit of soy milk to add some creaminess); used about 6 carrots and 3 ribs of celery; and added a generous pinch of dried tarragon. Seasoned generously with pepper at the end. Delicious!

This is a perfectly fine pureed vegetable soup, I just don't think it's anything special. It's not very carrot-y for carrot soup, but it's buttery and the fennel seed comes through nicely.

I LOVE this recipe. It is my standard "Welcome New Baby" dish for friends. I do use more carrots then called for, almost double sometimes depending on how many I have. I also add a few croutons to it, or even a tablespoon of sour cream.

Rating: 3
Fortunately I had time to cook more carrot and thyme. Next time I will double the carrot and thyme, add add about 1/2 c Greek yogurt. As the recipe is printed, the soup is thin and insipid.

This soup is so good. It's quick and easy to make. I might serve it with our Thanksgiving meal. Definitely a 10!

This recipe honored my fresh Nantes Half Long carrot crop from the garden, and fresh thyme and fennel seed. I found this dish has a remarkable complexity and richness, though not a cream base, possibly that I decreased the fluid/broth by 1/4. Taking the cook's advice about the bouillon instead of low salt canned broth, I used the 'Better than Bouillon" chicken, with excellent results. Most of my carrot crop will likely end up in this soup and into the freezer to be enjoyed again and again this long snowy mountain winter!

This is great and easy to make. I did add a little more fennel than called for, and I'm not sure how much broth I added--just enough to cover the carrots. This is a recipe I'll make again and again!

I thought this recipe was not "carroty" enough and a bit bland. Needs doctoring.

Very flavorful and easy to make. I remembered to only fill the blender halfway this time. Last time I had a big cleanup. I served 8 cup size servings of soup and everyone loved the flavor.

When my daughter (age 29 ) saw the soup, told me she doesn't eat anything orange. I told her just to try it...she had 2 bowls!! I made it thick with 5 large carrots, 5 cloves of garlic and only 4 cups of broth. The fennel was amazing spice. Don't leave it out.

LOVED this recipe!! I added about 3/4 cup OJ at the end to add a little more flavor. Wouldn't change anything else.

Excellent recipe, have now used for years. Have substituted dried thyme with great results. The fennel seeds definitely gives it a bit of a kick. Guests have raved and asked for the recipe - and none have guessed that it was carrot soup!

Rating: 3
Basically a simple, but tasty soup. I thought the butter would be excessive, but it wasn't; that's the only source of fat in the recipe (at least as I had made it, with fat-free chicken broth), and what saves it from simply tasting like seasoned baby food.

Rating: 4
Delicious appetizer before a special dinner. Found that it is not a soup to eat in large quantities as it is very rich. Maybe reduce amount of butter and/or increase number of carrots. The fennel gave it a very hardy characteristic and the thyme garnish on top is must as it is the perfect finishing touch.

I am almost in shock at how good this is. I made it exactly as written, no tweaking, and it exceeded my expectations by miles. It is easy, healthly, colourful, delicious - I will make it OFTEN.

Amazing texture and rich taste. I've made this several times and experimented with different amounts of broth for different purposes -- e.g. full amount of liquid if it's used as a first course for a dinner pary, less broth if it is to be served as a simple main course with bread. This will really change the soup so you want to be careful when adding the liquid. Either way it is excellent.

So very very simple and really delicious. It's the butter + fennel I guess.

I made this recipe again for a teachers' appreciation luncheon. I increased my fork rating from the other day because the soup was outstanding this time! The only difference is that I used Herb-Ox bouillon cubes instead of low-salt cans of soup. I also let the onions and leeks get slightly golden from cooking in the butter the first time---make sure this does not happen. This second batch was incredible compared to the first!

This was a delicious soup! I recently made 3 soups from this website and this one ranked high in our family tastings. Kids loved it and hubby too! What a wonderful flavor and so rich tasting. I omitted the fennel as we do not care for it. Definitely a keeper! Also made the parsnip bisque with chestnuts--did not like it and the zucchini coriander soup which was amazing and different!

I really liked this soup. It's thick, tasty and excellent for a winter soup.

Make this recipe, for pete's sake! I cook a lot, and am used to accolades, but the praise heaped upon this soup by my family can only be described as lavish. Please, don't fancy it up or weird it out by adding things like ginger, cream, sherry, etc... it stands on its own with its simple ingredients. If you are the kind of cook that must break new culinary ground with every recipe, then do so by adding another carrot or two, chop another leek, or tweak the herbs. I went nuts with... parsley. One recommendation I would make is if you are in a position to do so, spend $50 and get a good immersion blender, or use the one you have because it's the ideal tool for this basic, simple, and marvelous soup.

I made this for a soup party and it was very well received. Many people asked for the recipe, and one guest who didn't like carrots said he still liked this soup. I did use more carrots than called for by the recipe.

Yup, as all the other reviews say - everyone asks for the recipe. It's not _my_ favorite carrot soup ever - when I make carrot soup for myself it is 99% carrots! - but this is one very fine soup. Delicious, and easy to make a nice presentation with the sprig of thyme.

I made this soup as a starter for last Thanksgiving. I filled the tall, vodka type shot glasses with the soup set the glasses on a tray and passed them. Everyone raved about the "soup shots" it and it proved to be a great teaser for the main meal. Even though I hate to repeat my Thanksgiving meals, I think this soup will have a reoccuring role.

Very good soup, but I made it with dill instead of time and ommitted the fennel. While blending I added about 1/2 cup of sour cream which made it a bit creamier. Will definitley make this one again.

Served this soup before Easter dinner. Everyone enjoyed it. It is very creamy considering no cream is used. I will surely make this again.

Outstanding. The leeks and fennel make this much more than your ordinary carrot soup. I used very fresh organic carrots that were very sweet and they really made the soup.

I made the recipe as recommended including reducing to 4 cups of chicken broth, 1/3 stick of butter and increasing to 6 carrots. I used red carrots that created an interesting color, but did not change the flavor much. I garnished with some shredded ginger and a small dollop of sour cream. It is a good recipe and my guests enjoyed it.

Perfect! Beautiful texture. The leek and carrot combine wonderfully. Even my 3 year old daughter who despises all vegetables asked for a second helping! Definately a winner...

Very good - I used a little less chicken broth. All the other reviewers had indicated they wanted more carrot flavor, so I added a jar of pureed carrots (swiped from my baby's stash). Definitely enhanced the carrot flavor.

Wonderfull soup!!!! Great flavor. If you don't like fennel, leave it out, I did & it is still great. Also add at least 1 extra carrot, & a hand blender in the pot works fine. Next time I will cut down on the butter, also, no salt is needed. I am a salt lover & forgot to add it & it is fine.

I used a small bunch of fresh coriander instead of the thyme and fennel, which I removed before pureéing, and then after pureéing I added one shredded carrot. I also added some fresh chopped coriander just before serving. The soup had a wonderful flavour.

Our Herb Culinary group, focusing on recipes using fennel seed, selected and prepared this soup. The preparation is easy and the result is wonderful. The taste is subtle and quite unlike what I expected. An excellent addition to one's soup repertoire....

Buttery but not especially carrot-y. I had some very fresh fennel seeds, which addede a lot of nice aroma. Good starter course.
