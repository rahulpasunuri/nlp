I made this last July 4th and it was delicious. The pickle juice over the warm potatoes made it especially tasty and moist. I am going to make it again for Labor Day weekend.

I never met a potato I didnt like. Summer entertaining is a joy knowing that basics like potato salad will please your guests. When I read the description of this recipe I knew it would be a winner. Drizzling sweet pickle juice over the warm potatoes is the secret to this delicious salad. Im a fan of sweet pickles, and this potato salad opts for buttermilk rather than vinegar to give it a little acidity. I used Yukon Gold rather than red-skinned potatoes. Give it a blue ribbon. I would definitely make it again. http://michaelbeyer.wordpress.com/2010/07/08/state-fair-potato-salad-3/

A good basic recipe, but I did tweak it a bit. I didn't peel the potatoes, and I added more pickles and celery. I think that 2 eggs is plenty, or I might omit them next time. I tossed in a small jar of pimentos for color, and used some fresh dill. I added a good amount of red wine vinegar to the warm potatoes along with the pickle juice and used a lot more salt and pepper than called for. Light mayo works well. Yummy!

This is the only potato salad recipe I make anymore. Don't bother peeling the spuds. Be liberal with the pickle juice, pickles, celery & eggs. Skip the onion. Increase the sauce half-again (double if you accidentally tossed 5 lbs of potatoes in your pot instead of only 3-1/2). MMM... making it for Easter this year!

This is our all time family favorite...usually served with our summertime lobster or ribs on the barbecue. We are often asked for this recipe by guests.

This is my fav classic potato salad. Sure I can sub sour cream/creme fraiche/yougurt for the butter milk with ease. Add more or less onions/celery sweet/dill pickles. The point is the recipe gives you a great technique to fly on your own. It'll be back on my Memorial Day menu this year to start the summer off right.

This potato salad has become my signature summer salad. To add more flavor, I usually add a little cooked, crumbled bacon and chopped fresh dill. I only peel about half of the potatoes and mash a few of them with a fork if the salad seems a little too juicy.

I thought that this was a pretty tasty potato salad. I made it for a tailgate party and it was a big hit. My only complaint is that the dressing seemed a bit too thin. next time I may bump up the mayo and cut back on the buttermilk and pickle juice. I'll add more onion and celery too. I like crunch in my salad. Otherwise, this will be my go-to potato salad recipe from here on out.

This potato salad was a hit at my last barbecue. I used 1 cup of LIGHT Mayo (instead of regular mayo and buttermilk) No one was able to tell that I used Light Mayo instead of regular - still very creamy. I used sweet pickle relish if not enough pickle juices I added some apple cider vinegar. This is my go to recipe for classic potato salad!!!

Used Yukon Golds instead of red potatoes and wound up using a bit more buttermilk in the dressing, but otherwise followed the recipe. My boyfriend said it was the best potato salad I've ever made and my guests raved. If you are looking for a classic potato salad, this is it!

This potato salad is one of the best I have ever tasted or prepared. For those who feel that it is too wet, just refrigerate and wait for 2-3 hours. Those potatoes absorb all of the juice, no problem. Don't change a thing - just enjoy the best!

Great recipe for classic potato salad. I like to sub some dill pickles for some of the sweet pickles.

Made half-recipe to go with the cherry cola ribs. Had to substitute Yukon golds and seeded mustard -- and as usual buttermilk (never have it when you need it). The ongoing marital pickle fight caused me to compromise -- I used the juice, but left out the pickles. Still yummy and even prettier with the mustard seeds throughout.

This is an excellent recipe. I forgot the buttermilk, unfortunately, but compensated with extra mayo and a few dashes of white wine vinegar. Excellent.

Many people won't believe me, but my family has always kept the mayonnaise jar in the cabinet, not the fridge. It will not spoil due to the vinegar content. We love mayonnaise and no one in my house has ever gotten sick from room temperature mayo.

Pretty bland. Maybe I did something wrong but it seemed like the potato to celery/pickle/red onion ratio was way off. There are so many great recipes I would not bother to make this again.

A tasty salad but it did become a bit soupy as mentioned by previous cooks but it was anything but bland....a nice combination of onion and celery crunch and flavor...and a tangy zip..well received by our guests at our B-B-Q....will make again but will hold back a bit on the pickle juice and buttermilk

Rating: 1
Not even worth one "fork." Bland and flavorless. In fact, only the red onion actually contributed any flavor. In the future, I'd skip the sweet pickles and juice entirely, drop the buttermilk, use more mustard, add cayenne pepper. Actually, I'd scrap this recipe completely and use one that tastes good.

We do a different version of potato salad in Cyprus. We dice boiled potatoes when cool. Dress it with virgin olive oil and lemon juice. Add chopped fresh mint leaves. Decorate with slices of hard boiled eggs (if u like), black olives, chopped spring onions. Cypriots love a can of tuna or sardines with this potato salad on hot summer days.

This has been a summer favorite with family and friends since the recipe came out. It may seem as though there's not quite enough dressing, but it's really just right - any more and the potatoes can't absorb the moisture and the salad becomes soupy (when i doubled the dressing, i had to actually strain the potatoes out). A truly terrific dish!

A great family party recipe! The learned chef from Iowa is correct, however, to add one more view to the Salmonella controversy (as a former microbiologist). Bacteria needs protein and sugar to grow. The common denominator to the salads is the protein, including the eggs in the mayo. Commercial mayo is fine, just be careful with homemade. That's why burger places have outbreaks - the handling of the ground meat. The best advice is, chilled or room temp is a personal choice, but WASH YOUR HANDS when preparing food. That's where the bacteria comes from. It doesn't grow there by itself.

I made this salad for a party a few weeks ago. Everyone enjoyed it...several people asked for the recipe. I would definitely make it again. My boyfriend made the recipe but cut the potatoes too small. I think it's important to keep the potatoes the recommended size they don't loose their taste.

This is a great recipe! As a professional chef, rarely in high volume, professional kitchens are potato salads made from scratch for service. Too many variables, WAY too much labor cost. This is a fantastic recipe to make for small catering events and luncheons. And according to the Iowa Dept of Inspections and Appeals, commercially produced mayonnaise is perfectly safe to be served at room temperature, providing it has not been served above 40 degrees for 4 hours or more.That is the rule for ALL foods. High volume kitchens get mayonnaise in 5 gallon buckets that are not even sealed. Key to this is the consistency of the recipe used in commercially produced mayonnaise. The hazards arise in the potatoes and the eggs, NOT the mayonnaise.

I used low fat buttermilk, and substituted Splenda for the sugar. It still tasted great! The family raved.

I made this potato salad to go with the spareribs with cherry cola glaze on this same site. The ribs were so sweet and then the sweet potato salad . . . too much. I do like the potato salad, though, and will serve it again tonight with some savory grilled chicken (anything that's not sweet!). The pickle juice was a nice addition. Bringing the potato salad up to room temperature is fine! There is a time/temperature rule of about 4 hours, and as long as you're working with fresh ingredients and not letting the salad sit in the hot sun, you're fine. When you bring salads like this to room temperature, their flavors are heightened--think of eating haagen daaz ice cream and how much better it is when it starts to melt.

I have not made this specific recipe yet (it looks good), but the warnings about mayo in salads is an old wives' tale. There is way too much acid in commercial mayo to support bacterial growth and this recipe also includes acidic pickle juice and buttermilk.

Actually MA, WI is right - it is the MAYO that you must worry about. That is why there are summer warnings about egg salad, potato salad, tuna salad - what is the common denominator? Yes, it's the mayonnaise. I liked this much better when I omitted the sugar. The pickle juice is wonderful. For those who don't like the buttermilk, you can use Miracle Whip - less soupy that way.

Rating: 3
Really good stuff, but to speak to the cook from WI's point regarding brining this dish to room temp--it's not the mayo that you have to worry about. It's the potatoes! Bacteria thrives in potatoes when they are not held at the proper temp--HOT or COLD.

Probably won't make again. It's ok but nothing lip smacking great. Even though I omitted the sugar for the dressing and used less pickle juice than asked for, it was VERY SWEET. I didn't include the eggs because I don't care for them but I've eaten enough eggy potato salad to know what it would be like with eggs (still just ok). This could use radishes or something bitter/tart to offset the sweetness. It's easy to prepare though. Keep looking if you want an outstanding potato salad recipe.

Memorial Day picnic must have a standard potato salad! This was good, but I think a bit too much dried mustard. My husband thought it was fine.

WITH the eggs!

Made this potato salad for a BBQ we recently had and everyone wanted to know where we bought it because it tasted just like homemade! They were shocked when I told them I had made it. It's one of the best potato salad recipes I've ever tasted. A bit on the sweet side so if you're not into sweet potato salad then this isn't for you. But I prefer them that way. Served it along with BBQ chicken, grilled veggies done on the BBQ, pasta salad and a green salad. There was hardly any potato salad left and I had tripled the recipe. I'm adding this to my repetoire.

This is a delicious, low fat potato salad. Because it gets so much flavor from the pickles, even non-fat mayo can be used with pleasing results. I made it three times during the Fourth of July holiday weekend! And, I just emailed the recipe to my cousin who had to have it after I raved about it so much.

Somehow, it tastes exactly as you'd expect a State Fair Potato Salad would. Old fashioned, in a way, i guess. I made it almost exactly as written, and it couldn't have been a better accompaniment to a traditional bar-b-q. Taste and testure were both perfect. My interest is piqued by a previous reviewers suggestion of horseradish, or maybe a jalepeno, beacuse a little hot would offset the sweet real well.

I'm the kind of person who buys a tub of deli potato salad and deals with it's bland flavor. I decided one day enough was enough and tried out this recipe. It's great and simple enough.

This is the first potato salad recipe I have made that my kids actually liked. Maybe because it's slightly sweet. Definitely a great version of the classic potato salad. I didn't use celery as I didn't have any on hand, but I added some fresh chives and a dash of tabasco and it was very good.

Fantastic potato salad! I used the buttermilk -- in fact, I followed the recipe pretty much exactly -- and I think the buttermilk is key here.
