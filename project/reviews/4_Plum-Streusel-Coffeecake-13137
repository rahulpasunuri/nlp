I have made this coffee cake several times and is always a winner. Sometimes I use whole wheat flour and cut down the sugar... and I have cut the flour in the streusel topping. I have also used apricots... delicious. The first time I made it I somehow miss read the recipe and froze it before cooking it. Then I cooked it for about an hour once it was frozen. Turned out great... and works great for me because I can put this together at night without worrying about cooking time, freeze it, and then put it in the oven several days later about an hour before serving. And it's fun to have my boys help put the fruit on top.

I just made this recipe tonight and off the hop had to make s few substitutions due to the groceries I had on hand. I have made a similar recipe long in the past which I lost and was looking for a good alternative - I think I've found it! I left out the walnuts, used canned plums (sliced lengthwise into quarters), and substituted half the butter in the cake batter with Crisco shortening (and reduced the fats overall by 25%). I also added cinnamon into the batter portion for extra oomph. I'm very pleased with the way the recipe came out! As other reviewers have mentioned, the streusel quantity given really would have been too much. I cut that section of the recipe down by 25% and found that to be a good quantity to cover the 100% recipe of cake batter and plums.

I reduced the flour in the streusel topping to 3/4 cup as suggested (Wow-- can't imagine ever using a full cup). Excellent results! Didn't need the confectioner's sugar, tho. Pretty enough as is, imho.

Delicious and simple. Used canola oil instead of butter, cut streusel flour to 3/4 c as suggested, and added a dollup of yogurt to streusel to incorporate together. Perfect crisp crumbles, moist tender cake. Used frozen tart pluots for great flavor.

LOVE this coffeecake! I also reduced the flour in the streusel to 3/4 c. and it was perfect. This coffeecake was heavenly while it was still warm but was also great the next morning!

Question: do you really have to freeze the cake, or can it be served warm from the oven? Didn't know if this was an integral step. . . Thanks!

This disappeared in the flash in my household. The combo of cake, plums and crunchy streusel was too much for my husband and our visitors to resist! Quite easy to make too

Good coffeecake and worked well with very juicy plums. I reduced flour in the streusel as well.

Heavens, this is lovely! This is an excellent streusel coffee cake, and the plums liven it up nicely, both in terms of color and taste. It's excellent for the next day or two, but the plums do tend to moisten the streusel over time. I would bet this would also rock with almost any good baking fruit (apples, rhubarb, peaches). Highly recommended.

Delicious and very easy. Followed suggestions and cut back flour in the streusel to 3/4 cup and all was perfect.

I'll give this 3 forks on potential, but I wish I had read the reviews before I made the streusel. It wasn't really crumby enough for my taste, probably due to the amount of flour as others have noted. Also, I wasn't sure if the plums would make it too moist, as they were very ripe and fresh picked, but next time I will likely put a double layer of plums because it really brings this coffeecake to another level. Overall this was still really delicious, even without those changes. Great way to use plums in season!

Reliable and easy to prepare. I have been making this coffee cake for years and have always been happy with the results. A favorite "go to" coffee cake!

I've been trying to re-create a lost family recipe for a plum coffeecake for some time now, and I have to say that this recipe takes the cake, pardon the pun! I'm delighted to say that it's better than the original by miles! Like the other reviewers, I too reduced the flour in the topping to 3/4c and it was perfect. My husband who is not a dessert eater took one bite "just to taste it" and then immediately asked for an entire slice! I should probably buy a lottery ticket, this is such a rarity, LOL. YOu could make this cake with just about any stone fruit- it would be beautiful with peaches or cherries. In fact I combined plums with tart, sweet apples and will be serving it as a twist for Rosh Hashanah this year. Absolutely try this recipe- it will be a keeper that I will make again and again. Delicious!

This is the best coffeecake recipe ever for one with fruit. I was looking for one specifically to use with plums from our tree (Satsuma plums) that wouldn't turn out wet and doughy. This is it. I've made it three times in one week and am going to make it next week for a brunch. I've made it with less butter and sugar, with whole wheat flour and regular flour, with almonds instead of walnuts, and as the recipe stands, and it turns out great no matter what.

Every year my husband and I look forward to the plums ripening on our neighbor's tree (which hangs into our yard). This is an excellent recipe. Hubby is allergic to walnuts, so I leave those out. Pretty much follow the rest as is.

This is my new favorite coffee cake recipe. I had only two plums, so I used half plums, half apples. I reduced the flour in the topping by 1/4 cup and baked for 50 minutes, which was about perfect. I like how this isn't too sweet.

I made this cake for my mom's coworkers and they loved it! It was moist and light and the plums were perfectly cooked.

Oh yum! I made it with fresh peaches, and doubled the recipe for a staff meeting - it was devoured. I did cut the flour in the streusel as suggested (1 3/4 c. in a doubled recipe instead of 2 c.), but baked for over an hour (high altitude). Everyone loved it!!

It's the PLUMS that make this cake! I used plums from the tree in my backyard--not sure of the variety, but they're the round kind with sweet, pink and yellow centers and tart, dark purple skins. Their flavor and scent when cooked gave me chills! However, in spite of other comments here that the cake turned out dry, I found that it was much too rich. When I make it again, I'll cut the amount of butter in half (one stick of butter to a cup and a quarter of flour is a very high proportion of fat for a cake batter). Would be excellent with slivered almonds in the streusel.

I found this cake a bit dry as well so I decided to experiment. I increased all the ingredients by half again (except for the flour in the streusel where I used only 3/4 cup in total) and used a jelly roll pan 11" by 16". Ror the plums I used the small prune plums,simply cut in half (@ 2 lbs) and baked for 40 mins. Absolutely delish !!!

I followed the suggestions and baked for 50 minutes and used less flour in the struessel. I also made it vegan, substituting soy margarine and egg replacer for the butter and eggs. It came out so amazing, I was accused of selling my soul to create it.

Was looking for another creative way to use the plums from our tree, so I tried this. About 6 billion calories per bite, but totally worth it! Baked for only 50 minutes as suggested by others. Also cut the granulated sugar to 1/2 c and the butter from 1 stick to 3/4. Tasted great! Will make this again next summer.

I've made this cake twice. The first time I made it as directed in the recipe. It was a bit dry, and I thought the topping used a little too much flour. The second time I halved the amount of flour in the streusel and baked for only 50 minutes. Very good!

This is delicious - have made it several times and everyone loves it. I found you only need to bake it 50 minutes, and not 1 hour (might be why one reader thought it was too dry). I'm going to try it with fresh peaches next.

I wouldn't make this cake again. Quite tart and quite dry in the body of the cake.

An excellent coffeecake. As plums are not in season I used a tin of prune plums. Wonderful!

Hello fellow bakers. I've used this recipe many time over the nlast 4yrs without any misshaps. I might suggest using 1 tablespoon of clear vanilla to the batter I think it adds a nice richness to the cake.
