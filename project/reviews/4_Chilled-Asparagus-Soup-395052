Made some alterations to this recipe that made it to die for: - Added curry powder instead of salt to the onions - Added peeled diced potatoes to thicken when I added the chicken stock - Put a dash of dry sherry at the end after it had chilled

This is a fantastic recipe. I had asparagus that was past it's prime from a big box store. I cut off the tips and followed the recipe except for the following: - only used about 2 oz. asparagus - only used one onion - didn't have spinach so I skipped that step - used chicken bouillon instead of chicken broth - let the soup simmer on "simmer" rather than medium; and for 25 mins vs. the 8-10 mins in the recipe My husband and I finished the entire pot before we even sat down for dinner. I would definitely make this again.

I think this is a great soup. I plan to make lots more while asparagus and spinach are in season and plentiful at our farmer's market. Has anyone tried to freeze it? How good would this be in the middle of winter, when you are craving fresh green veggies?

I made this recipe,using homemade chicken stock. I have a Vita-Mix blender so just left the soup in the blender until the texture looked perfectly smooth, and skipped the step with the strainer. It's absolutely delicious. It has a bright taste of asparagus without any milk or cream flavor covering it. This is a great company dish, that can be served as part of the very best meal.

Not worth the effort!! The soup was a bit bitter and I tasted the spinach beforehand. It does not have the "bright" taste of spring asparagus. I used a food processor to puree and then a food mill to strain the soup.

I just made this soup using asparagus my neighbor cut this morning. I bought a 5 oz. container of organic baby spinach because the spinach in my garden has bolted (become bitter) from our early and unseasonably warm spring. I used one large sweet onion, as I do not care for a pronounced onion flavor in cold soups, plus I am certain I had less than 3 pounds of asparagus. Before putting the pureed soup into the fridge to chill over night, I tasted it and found it to be quite delicious even at room temp. More veg would have made it thicker, but I loved it none the less. To the reviewer whose soup was bitter - the fault lies not in the recipe. I highly recommend tasting your produce before cooking it. If either the asparagus or the spinach is bitter raw, cooking won't make any difference. I definitely will make more for the freezer!

I found this soup to be quite bitter. Do not know whether it was the spinach or asparagus stalks. Tried adding some spices and additional salt, but still tasted like eating grass. Too bad, it had great promise.

Excellent, healthy soup! But it easily serves 10-12 appetizer portions.
