I have made these several times and they are always a hit! I did a little changing, cut out alot of the breadcrumbs, used panko and parm instead and mixed everything together, I still left them a little wet. I made them the size of golfballs then stuffed.I used a little panko for the outside and then fried. I also serve with red sauce. Yhey are even a hit with my 10 yr old!

I don't know what the reviewers who didn't care for the flavor or texture did differently, but my family and I found these very flavorful, and the texture was just fine. I cooked the eggplant for the full hour. It cooled while we went to the movies, and I guess it absorbed some moisture in that time. But a quick 10-15 minutes in the oven took care of that. I ended up with more cheese than I had eggplant mixture, but that's probably because my eggplants were medium-sized instead of large. This one goes in the "make again" file as far as we're concerned.

I made this today for the first time and they were great. My only change for nex time: will add the zest from one lemon. A little messy but worth the effort. I only baked the eggplants for 40 minutes. That was enough for me. Definitely I will use some dipping sauce next time, maybe a greek yogurt sauce with finely chopped fresh parsley and lemon juice...

For such a time consuming recipe the end result was not worth it at all. My mix lacked a binding quality (very difficult to mold into balls with a cheese cube center). The most pronounced flavor was the Smoked Mozzarella (of course, I had nothing to do with making that) and of watery eggplant. I think I definitely did something very wrong because the other reviews seem to be so positive!! I will try this again only for my own peace of mind.

They came out pretty good, I didn't bake the eggplants for an hour - I didn't want them to be too dry, but b/c of that the center came out a little too mushy. Next time I'll bake them for about 30-45 min,but not a full hour. Oh and I used seasoned breadcrumbds which gave them more flavor, and in have the batch I added pancetta.

We expected to go crazy over these....but they were just ok to us...too dense and not enough flavor.

I also had a problem with the eggplant coming out too dry. Watch it carefully in the oven. Or maybe I had sliced it too thin. Definitely needs something to dip it in.

Delicious and satisfying--with some marinara sauce and a salad, it would make a delightful meal.

Very good appetizer. When I made it, the eggplant came out too dry. I added an extra egg and blended in a food processor. Came out wonderfully in the end. A great recipe for people who do not usually like eggplant.

This is a delicious use of my fresh garden eggplant. I've made this twice; the second time I added some sauteed mushrooms and will continue with that addition. I also tried fresh basil which was great, but the thyme was delicious too.The smoked mozz is a must. This recipe is definitely worth the time.

This was a great recipe. It was a little time consuming, but a great way to use eggplant. I recommend using marina sauce as a dip. It definitely needed the marina!

I made this and they are delicious! I tried them out becasue i am making a party next week and wanted to see how they work with advance prep. I ate one after frying and then refrigerated and refried them again the next night for dinner guests. They were not as crispy and as when just cooked, but for the party i will reheat them in an oven for ten minutes instead of refrying them hopefully that will help. Either way, I never loved eggplant so much!
