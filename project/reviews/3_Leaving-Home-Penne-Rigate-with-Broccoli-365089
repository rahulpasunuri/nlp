This is good. I agree with the other reviews that it needs a couple of tweaks. First, put the broccoli in at the end of the pasta boiling time, otherwise you'll end up with broccoli soup. Ten minutes is WAY too long to cook broccoli cut into bite sized pieces. Cut back on the oil. 1/3 cup is plenty to coat the pasta. Use a good quality cheese for flavor. I used an inexpensive brand - it's what I had on hand, and next time, I'll opt for a more sharp cheese. I added garlic and a touch of red pepper. Cut the salt to taste. I cut it maybe in half. Cheese is salty anyhow.

I made this and followed the recipe more or less exactly, as I like to eyeball measurements, although I did measure out the pecorino and actually used slightly more (3/4 cup instead of 2/3s) and honestly I got super great reviews from my guests and I loved it too. I paired it with a watermelon salad that I sort of made up on the spot. (watermelon, bell pepper, cucumber, cilantro, mandarin orange segments and raspberry vinaigrette) a pretty great meal for the 2nd day of spring. and just, I gotta say to jmandrews, that if whatever you made was "DISGUSTING", it's not the recipe's fault. this dish is delicious. you made it wrong. sorry bud.

This is a very fast and easy entree. I am going to try cutting down on the olive oil a bit as I found last time I made it, it seemed a bit too rich. Also I don't use the full amount of salt recommended and have been happy with the results.

Quick and easy, and very tasty. We added sweet peppers, for a little extra flavor, and that made it perfect. Also, great as lunch the next day.

This was an easy, tasty recipe. I cut way back on the olive oil and salt, and used grated provolone dolce since I didn't have a sharper cheese on hand. Using another reviewer's advice and adding a few mashed cloves of garlic to the olive oil before mixing everything together made for an even better dinner.

For a super easy weeknight meal, I really was a big fan of this recipe. It didn't take much more effort than making a box of Kraft Mac 'n Cheese and was much healthier and more satisfying. I would love to try it with different veggies, a whole wheat pasta, and maybe different cheeses. I also used only about 1/4 cup of olive oil and that was plenty for my family's tastes. My 2-year-olds were fans!

This is a great dish but don't follow the recipe exactly. Only use about 1 tbsp salt, and use no more than a half cup of olive oil. After you drain the pasta and broccoli, I suggest that you heat the oil in the pot and saute 3-4 cloves of chopped garlic and possibly some red pepper flakes. after a few minutes, stir in the pasta and the cheese.

After reading other reviews I went ahead and modified this recipe. I used 2 tbs of salt, 2 lbs of broccoli,1/3 cup of EVOO, and 1 cup of cheese. I ended up adding a little more salt at the end and it was perfect! Served 5 :)

I thought the salt was fine, it was the amount of cheese and oil that we had an issue with. Granted we like less cheese than a lot of people, so that's probably just us, but I only used 1/2 c EVOO and it was still too much.

I was disappointed in this; thought it would be a little more flavorful with the oil and cheese. I followed other reviewers advice and cut down on the salt; I definitely wouldn't have preferred that it be saltier. My 16 month old liked it, which was nice, but my husband and I just thought it was okay.

Good recipe but I would agree with the other reviewers on being careful with the salt. I added garlic, based on comments here, and felt that this lifted the dish. Speed and simplicity make this attractive to make again.

DISGUSTING. I joined just to do a review on this recipe. I wasted a pound of pasta, a pound of broccoli and some nice cheese on this disaster. All you can taste is the INCREDIBLY over salted pasta and then olive oil (I didn't even use as much of either as the recipe called for, thankfully. I probably would have actually thrown up). It basically tastes like salty olive infused pasta. I felt sick after too many bites trying to fix it. What a waste of time and food. It wasn't worth keeping. My boyfriend tried to eat a bowl to be nice and couldn't. I feel a LITTLE bad posting this, but you oughtta be warned if you're looking for something to spread out your limited grocery budget.

I followed some of the reviews above, did the pasta and right before it was ready put the broccoli in. Also, I used aged Cheddar and it was delicious! My parents and husband loved it!

What a simple but great dish! So quick and a good way to get more veggies on your plate. I did add a few smashed garlic cloves into the cooking water, and served with crushed red pepper. Have already made 3 times for company and recipe has been requested by all.

This dish was definitely lacking. I followed the recipe, but I'm thinking I should have read the reviews first. I may try it again switching up the recipe. To add some protein, I sliced a chicken breast into thin strips, sauteed with minced garlic, olive oil, a little poultry seasoning, and a pinch of oregano and basil. It turned out yummy.

I used to make this frequently. I put the broccoli in after the pasta so it wouldn't be too mushy and added peeled garlic cloves as well. I am going to try it again, this time with whole grain penne. I wonder how it would be as a salad.

I've been making a variation of this dish for years. I add the broccoli to the boiling pasta just a couple of minutes before the pasta is done. Then drain and toss with olive oil, garlic, fresh ground black pepper and Parmesan cheese. The addition of crushed red pepper sounds good. I will try it that way next time I make this dish.

This was fantastic! I cooked the broccoli according to the recipe, which scared me to death. Put the cheese, broccoli, olive oil, one large garlic clove, salt, and fresh ground pepper in the food processor to make the sauce. Tossed it with the pasta and YUM!!!

Who eats dinner at 6.15? Next time, less oil for health's sake and a bit of garlic for the soul.

I made this for dinner tonight and loved it. Just what I was in the mood for, something simple and satisfying. Regarding the salt issue that others have commented on, I would submit that a "handful" of salt is roughly two tablespoons, not much more. I made a half recipe, using a 6 qt pot and added about a tablespoon of salt. It was just right - salty enough but not too salty after the cheese was added. I also didn't think the quantity of olive oil called for was excessive. The oil mixed with the soft broccoli and cheese becomes the sauce for the pasta. Less oil would have made for a dry dish. I absolutely love the simple flavor of good olive oil on fresh-cooked pasta, and this simple combination of flavors was just perfect. Much as I love garlic, I don't think it would have been a welcome addition to this dish.

One of my favorite meals......but..... maybe 1/4 c. oil, saute garlic & toss it when light brown. Add broccoli, salt, hot pepper flakes and water and cook 'til done to taste. Drain pasta, save some of the water from boiling, add to broccoli. Toss with grated cheese. the best.

I agree with the others - this is a mediocre dish just waiting to become great. Cook the pasta. Then steam the broccoli - a lot of it. Once the broccoli is cooked al dente, drain. Heat a couple of tablespoons of olive oil in a heavy skillet. Add dried chile flakes to oil for 30 seconds or so, then add broccoli and as much minced garlic as you like. Add the pasta and stir together. Sprinkle parmesan cheese on top. Now that's a great dish.

No garlic or crushed red peppers? Things your mama never told you.

my Italian mamma has been making a variation of this recipe for years. for those who complained that it was bland, i offer a few changes-- don't overcook the broccoli. who likes mushy broccoli? add some garlic and crushed red pepper, toast in way less olive oil. try steaming the broccoli separately, (and using more of it), adding it to the al dente pasta just before serving. stir in some freshly grated parmigiano-reggiano, and finish with a touch of olive oil. rigatoni is, in my humble opinion, a pasta shape better suited for the tiny florets of (still intact) broccoli. buon appetito!

I think this recipe has a lot of potential. I followed the recipe but reduced the amount of oil and salt seeing as other reviewers had issues with that. I'd have to agree that it's a bit bland, but it could really be jazzed up in a myriad of different ways. I'll make it again but experiment more next time.

PS: I reduced both salt and oil based on recommendations. 3/4 cup oil seemed way too much and I just salted the water a little more than I usually do....lack of salt wasn't the problem.

This sounded like it might be good and it got high ratings and so I tried it as a kid-friendly dinner and boy, howdy....nobody really liked it. Would not repeat. Uninspiring and a waste of broccoli.

I have to agree with a previous reviewers about the salt content. While I loved the emphasis on the broccoli, I couldn't believe that amount of salt, cheese and oil it recommended...I followed all the steps regardless, and what came out was, frankly, inedible. I would definitely make this again but I would reduce the salt and cheese. Otherwise, it seems like a fast and easy dish. Did anyone else have the same experience?

I've made this for years - this is a staple in Italian homes. I chop the broccoli rather small and add it with the pasta. I add olive oil and garlic salt to the drained pasta and broccoli. I actually like the broccoli a little overcooked - it is meant to be creamy in this dish. A very fast and economical dish.

I never review recipes, but this one i just had to speak up! not sure what I didn wrong and im stunned nobody else mentioned the salt ontent? between the huge amount of salt required in the water and the saltiness of the pecorino - this was unedible. it actually made me nauseas after eating it from all the sodium. Perhaps it would be better with parmasean. but the oil content is absurd too.... I will not make this again

I doubled the broccoli as I love how pesto and creamy like it gets. Also added two bulbs of roasted garlic to the olive oil with a bit of half and half and put in the blender, which made it a super yummy, creamy (emulsified) sauce. A sprinkle of red pepper flakes at the end and YUMMO!

What a great simple, weeknight dinner. Added some complexity and sweetness by adding sliced sun-dried tomatoes. I also reduced the oil by 1/4 cup and used a lemon extra-virgin olive oil.

Good stuff! I used whole grain penne so I added the broccoli at half the cooking time which worked out perfect. Used Parmesan instead of Romano cheese (because it's what I had on hand), added red pepper flakes to the water (not so successful - better next time to use a little chili oil for some kick instead), some garlic powder when tossing things together, and at the end finished with a squeeze of lemon over each bowl. YUM! I'm surprised at how bright green the broccoli stayed and still became soft and looked very pesto-like. I'll make this again for sure!

Simple, quick and absolutely delicious. Everyone loved it so much I had to make it twice during the week. Although the recipe has you remove the stalks of the broccoli I left a little bit of stalk on to give a little texture.

Love this recipe...I made it this evening, and it was awesome!!! The only thing I will do next time is put the broccoli in after the pasta. I like to have broccoli crisper. By doing it like the recipe says it almost comes out looking like pesto (which still was great). If you wait to put the in the broccoli until a few minutes into cooking, it will comes out crispier and in full pieces. Side Dish: I bought a small container of mixed sweet tomatoes and roasted them in the oven at 350 for about 20-25 minutes with olive oil, died basil, salt and pepper. They will pop open in and get soft. I cut some french bread on the bias and spread minced garlic and olive oil and broiled them fro a few minutes. I served this along side of the tomatoes (kinda like build your own bruschetta.) Again awesome, easy, heathy meal!!!

I've been making this for years but never thought of it as a recipe! I don't boiled the broccoli as long as she recommends but I'll have to try it. I use whatever hard, salty cheese I have on hand, a 50-50 mix of butter and olive oil, a little garlic salt and white pepper. It's never failed me!

Yay the first reviewer! I loved this recipe. I was hesitant to put the broccoli in the boiling water first, but it all turned out just lovely. INSTEAD of pecorino, I used medium aged provolone. It tasted great! All in all an impressive, simple, easy to make meal that emphasizes just a few basic ingredients AND requires hardly ANY dishes ! How great is that?
