i have made this several times now and each time it gets RAVE reviews. i mean RAVE reviews. people are OBSESSED with it and want me to make it again and again, and that's great because it's so easy! a couple notes: make sure to use CRUSTY bread, not just french bread... it's just not the same. i left out the celery... and i like it that way. this last time i smeared each piece of bread with a mixture of garlic paste and olive oil prior to broiling... which worked really well! i'm thinking next time i'm going to try adding some bacon and maybe some avocados. everyone LOVES it and so do i!

This is a beautiful salad, and got raves when I took it to a party. Next time I would just sprinkle all the vegs, including tiny tomatoes and scallions, over the sliced tomatoes, then pour olive oil over all. I found it hard to evenly scatter the oil mixture. And even though others loved the blue cheese on it, for some reason I didn't, and would use feta or goat cheese next time.

I would give this five forks if another one was available! It's so good and so pretty. I make it exactly as is...don't change a thing. Just picked five gorgeous heirlooms from the garden...will be making this tomorrow!

I made this with yellow & red tomatoes, avocadoes instead of celery, and completley forgot to do the cheese -- it turned out as a "salad" more in the spirit of baba ghanouj; my tomatoes were a bit mushy. BUT. the flavour was amazing. And scooping it up with the grilled garlicky bread was amazing. Delish!

This one is in heavy rotation in our house come tomato season. Delicious, simple, and easy on the eyes. Definite winner for anyone who loves heirloom tomatoes like we do.

This was such a great salad. We've decided it's our fav. way to use homegrown tomatoes. I kept the recipe pretty much as written, just added fresh parsley as well as basil and combined both goat and blue cheese and drizzled a balsamic glaze over everything. Excellent!!!

Made this with fresh garden cherry tomatoes and fresh heirloom tomatoes from my farm share. Not a big celery fan, so I omitted the celery. It was PHENOMENAL and BEAUTIFUL. I usually would be tempted to add some lemon or dijon to something like this, but I'm glad I didn't. If you have fresh from the garden tomatoes, let their flavor shine with the simplicity of this recipe.

Four forks, for everything from ease of preparation to value for taste. I *love* tomatoes, but that fact aside, this salad is simply divine. The textures and flavors combine perfectly. I used homegrown grape tomatoes and beefsteaks, then about three or four small heirloom tomatoes that I bought to round out the flavors and colors. Really, just about a perfect a salad as you can make.

Great salad, easy and quick to make. It would work better to make individual serving rather than one platter. It would still make a nice presentaion. When presented on the platter you don't get an even distrution of the toppings when serving. The croutons are a must.

I have made this every summer since it was in the magazine five years ago. I usually omit the bread, but make the rest as written. It's one reason to plant tomatoes!

I had a similiar dish like this at Scott's Seafood in Palo Alto recently, and they slightly wilted the onions to reduce the pungent flavor. This really brought out the sweetness in the tomatoes and a tang with the cheese. YUM!

I love this salad and anxiously await the arrival of heirloom tomatoes at Trader Joe's each summer! Saw them today. Will be making the salad tonight. Its delicious and so pretty too.

This is a tremendous dish and it can be served as a salad an appetizer or even a light dinner. The flavors work well together and the acidity of the tomatoes, the crunch of the onion and celery plus the creaminess of the cheese make this a dish that dances in your mouth. This is a big time favorite of mine

I love tomatoes and make this dish frequently. However, I always omit the celery and I only use a small amount of cheese, so the tomatoes are the dominant flavor. It goes with all our summer dishes, from hamburgers to lobster.

Nothing to say except perfect. I used beautiful organic heirloom tomatoes (lucky to get them for only $1.00/lb), so the presentation was wonderful. Simple to let the natural flavor of these once-a-year beauties come through. Used it as a flat plate salad and also layered in to bring to work. Both worked great. The blue cheese is always a hit, but for those who aren't fond of it, use gueryere -- wonderful.

Made this for a dinner party and received rave reviews. One guest practically shovelled it in! I eliminated the toast and simply arranged the salad on a large platter -looked gorgeous! Next time I'll try the toast to sop up all the yummy juice.

I had a basket full of cherry tomatoes that my neighbor gave me this afternoon, and a whole bunch of basil from my own garden. I used this recipe as a jumping off point; I cut the tomatoes in half, then topped them with julienned red onion, slivered basil, and crumbled blue cheese. Sea salt and black pepper, of course -- then drizzled it all with Newman's Italian dressing ( okay you foodies, you can scoff at me now, but personally I like his salad dressing!!). It was EXCELLENT. Great in a pinch. In fact next week when my neighbor brings me more tomatoes, I will make the exact same salad. It tastes just like SUMMER!!!

I LOVE this recipe. The only change I've made is substituting regular garden tomatoes rather than heirloom (the cost!) but if I can find some at a farmer's market, I'll grab them and make this again and again. I absolutely love this salad. This is such a great summer recipe!

Have made this a few times, with and without the cheese, but I must say it definitely adds depth to the flavors of this salad. I often don't bother with the toast and serve crusty bread instead.

I left out the celery as suggested by another reviewer and it was great! I made a low-carb version w/out the bread and it was delicious just as a salad and much simpler to make

I made this several times last summer and couldn't wait for summer to finally roll around again this year so I can make it again. I've used different varieties of heirloom tomatoes and it has turned out wonderful each and every time. All my friends have raved about this dish. It's simple, sure, but I see nothing wrong with that. I've used goat cheese when I didn't have blue cheese. If you love tomatoes, this is a great recipe.

I've seen many tomato salad recipes incorporating bleu cheese since, but I think that none bring out the flavors of summer as this one does. Using the suggested variety of tomatoes (even if your favor YOUR favorite) makes this recipe special.

As with the other reviewer - not much of a recipe - good, but nothing that you couldn't come up with yourself from cupboard ingredients and summer tomatoes.

suggest adding a balsamic reduction it melds well with the oils and the cheese

This wasn't much of a "recipe" but nonetheless, it was fairly good. I would definitely leave out the celery next time; it seemed all wrong here.

I made this recipe again -- now everytime I pass heirloom tomatoes I crave this salad! This time I purchased packaged goat cheese crumbles with herbs and threw in some delicious olives (big green olives stuffed with garlic or almonds) and we devoured the salad in seconds. It's fantastic!

I made this over Labor Day weekend with Jet Star, Roma, and Beefsteak tomotoes from my garden for my better three-quarters and my neighbor. Although this produced a huge amount of food (despite cutting the recipe back by a few tomatoes), we managed to happily devour most of it. We all thought that this was amazing; in fact, my neighbor made it herself the next day for her friend, who in turn begged for the recipe. We also used the leftover tomato mixture as topping for a grilled pizza which was incredible!

While this was easy to make and looked great, I think it was just a so-so salad. If I had extra tomatoes, I would probably make it again, but somehow spice it up a little.

Tomatoes are not my favorite vegetable, which is why I gave it two forks, but as something to serve to others, it's very nice! I know the bread is there to help soak up the dressing, but if you get lazy you can do what I did: Instead of making toasts, I simply sprinkled Progresso bread crumbs over the entire top of each serving. This gave a wonderful, delicate crunch that went well with the salad.

The salad was a colorful and tasteful array of pure delight. Each bite was a bit of heaven.

I can't review the recipe since I haven't tried it but it looks great. Just wanted to say hi to the other cook from Florence, Oregon

Since this recipe appeared in Bon Appetit, we have enjoyed it several times. With different types of bread available at our farmer's market, each salad was even better than the last. I used focaccia, asiago cheese bread, sun-dried tomato bread, and french bread. I prepared the salad, then put a couple steaks on the grill and we enjoyed a perfect summer meal!

A friend made this recipe minus the toast and put it in a shallow glass bowl. Not only were the tomatoes beautiful, it was delicious and out of the ordinary. She made one with blue cheese and another without, both were excellent, but the one with blue cheese was by far my favorite. Now I'm going to make it, who cares if the rest of my family doesn't like tomatoes, I'll make it especially for me!

I couldn't wait to try this recipe with tomatoes from our garden! It was delicious! I added a spalsh of balsamic vinegar to the cherry tomatoes!

We made this for a family gathering, and it was very well received. We served it with grilled chicken. We werent able to find heirloom tomatoes, but we did use yellow and red for a great color combo. Marinate the small tomatoes first at room temp for at least an hour, this really made a difference. We liked it so much we made it again the next day, and added toasted pine nuts to the top, gave it a nice texture. People were fighting over the leftovers!
