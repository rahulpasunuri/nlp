Used Gala instead of Granny Smith apple, but otherwise, made it exactly to recipe. Mmmmmm good!

Just made a batch and barely let it cool completely before stirring some into my greek yogurt...absolutely delicious & love that its all natural. The only thing I changed was omitting the sugar (because family member has to watch sugar intake) and instead I added 1 T honey plus 1 T pure maple syrup. Will definitely make more for me and to share!

Wow. Just made this on a whim when I realized I needed a good dish for a food exchange later this week, and for once had all the ingredients on hand. Easy, easy, easy, and sooo delish. Very sweet. Could probably halve the sugar and still get great results, but it tastes so good. Heading to the store for a second pound of strawberries to make a second batch for myself.

Has anyone tried freezing this?

I made this jam when my strawberries got slightly crushed at the bottom of my bicycle-going grocery backpack, and I can't get enough of it. I find excuses to put it on everything, and I'm even baking things just to eat it with (I rarely bake, so my husband is thrilled). It's so easy, fills the house with delicious aroma, lasts weeks, and now I plan to make all sorts of fruit jams using this method. Definitely apricot. Kiwi, maybe? :)

Delicious! I used 1/3 c. Sugar and a couple of tbsp. of stevia just to lower sugar content. Spooned warm jam (couldn't wait for it to cool) over plain Greek yogurt. Divine!

Can other fruit be used? I'd like to be able to just make a quick batch with whatever fruit I have on hand...

For the amount of effort involved, this was really delicious. Local strawberries are in season but I only had Macintosh apples and it still tasted great. Great with the cloverleaf rolls as suggested in Bon Appetit.
