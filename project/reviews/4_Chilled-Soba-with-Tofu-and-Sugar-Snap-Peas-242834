This is really good. I used frozen peas and carrots, and substituted shallots for the scallions. I also sliced both of the shiitake and kombu and added them to the vegetables. The end results were very tasty and took less than 30 minutes- a great use of time to make my wife happy!

Ponzu sauce is just delicious in my opinion. I loved it on this and on another Epi recipe. This recipe is elaborate but worth it. I loved blanching the snap peas and the spinach--they stayed bright green. I used only half the amount of noodles and that was plenty. The quantity of sauce was way too much, however, so I made the noodles and veg again and had plenty for a second round.

I'm a bit surprised this got mostly good reviews. I found it a little flavorless. Like watered down soy sauce. I didn't taste the shitake at all, and ended up adding some white miso to liven up the sauce. I also added julienned carrots for color, and avocado for texture. These additions definitely helped this dish. There are many better similar noodle bowl recipes. This one was just okay.

I really enjoyed this dish. It reminded me of zaru soba with veggies and a great chilled dish for the summer. It is complicated as written, but I saved time by steaming the veggies instead of blanching and I did it on top of the cooking noodles. I was taken aback by the amount of sauce, but it was great. So that the noodles and tofu don't soak up all the sauce, it is a good idea to add the leftover sauce just before serving. One could sub dashi for the liquid from the dried shiitake and kombu. I used the ponzu sauce, but not sure if it made a huge flavour difference. I definitely would not search it out for this recipe. I would definitely not add the additional salt to a sauce that has 1/2 cup of soy sauce! I agree with the other reviewer that it was best the next day, chilled completely.

My husband and I really enjoyed this. He thought it was superb. Well balanced. I didn't pay attention before heading to grocery store and got half the amount of sugar snap peas and to me, half a pound seemed perfect. This is not a working mom's dinnner unless she is prepared to spend a good hour getting it all together, but if you have a little time, it is well worth it. Light and refreshing. Great meatless meal.

Good, but a lot of steps, I should have read the whole recipe first. Tried to make warm, would be better if tofu were fried/warm. Ended up being part warm, part cold, would be better 1 way or the other. Made own ponzu sauce, and used fresh shitaakes - mushroom water wasn't flavorful enough wiht fresh mushrooms. chopped mushrooms & included in salad. Would maybe include ginger in tiny chopped pieces instead of matchsticks?

This was awesome, and I made it in a much easier, faster way than the recipe-- I just did the soba and the sauce, minus the ponzu because I couldn't find it, and tossed in the other ingredients at the end. I didn't even cook the sauce- just mixed soy sauce, rice wine, sugar, sesame oil and green onions and that was it! A great summer meal.

This salad was tasty, though more work than I had anticipated. It was particularly good the second day after it had spent some time in the fridge.
