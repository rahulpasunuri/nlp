Either I did something VERY wrong or this is a terrible recipe. I am inclined to think it's the recipe though, because I followed the recipe exactly and I am a very experienced cook/baker. They were impossible to get off the parchment and completely crumbled into little bits and were not even remotely salvagable... maybe I'll use the crumbles as an ice cream topping.

Very good. Our didn't spread out quite as much as normal lace cookies and stuck a little, but we also didn't have parchment paper, so that might have been the problem. They taste delicious and buttery!

Just made these cookies. Very unusual. I cut the sugar in half, and half was white sugar and half was brown. The dough should be called "meal". Very crumbly. Added golden raisins and walnuts. Just "different". I would make these again as a healty cookie, with different dried fruit added and possibly a little wheat germ - almost like a food bar but lighter.

Made a mistake and gave it one fork. They are horrible, horrible cookies. I am a very good baker and these did not work out at all.

Nothing special. Crunchy texture, but bland, too sweet (even though I cut back on the sugar), and the vanilla was a bit overwhelming.

Easy and delicious! I only used 3/4 cup of sugar as I was serving these cookies with a lemon mousse and didn't want them to be too sweet. I used parchment paper and they transferred to the cooling rack beautifully. I will use this recipe again and again.

So easy to make and got a nice thin crisp cookie. Will definitely try adding cinnamon for a festive holiday cookie sometime. Drizzled chocolate too, good but didn't need it.

this is not a good recipe. after making a couple batches, and each one not being good, i went to a different site and found that every recipe for lace cookies called for melted butter. used it and they came out perfect.

I baked a batch for my fellow climbers (because of the weather forcing the climbers indoors, I've been baking cookies weekly to 'cheer them up.') and they were engulfed in minutes. I was asked for the recipe and had overheard a number of folks who weren't shy about taking more then one.

Very easy. I have made this fo rthe third time tonight for a quick cookie to have for guests. I 'doctored' it a bit this time and had excellent results. First, I divided the mixed dough in half and added 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon to one half and blended it in with the vanmilla extract. For the other half, I added a couple of tablespoons - maybe a little more - of chopped pecans. When the batch with the chopped pecans were cool, I drizzled them with a little melted milk chocolate and let them set. Awesome! My daugter took two of the pecan ones and put a marshmallow between them and heated it in the microwave a few seconds for a sorta s'more...

I thought they were just all right, but my boyfriend likes them a lot. They are very buttery and very crispy. I couldn't really get them to look good, either.

Great cookie...if you like the thin, crispy variety which I do.

I baked these delicious cookies to send to my son at college, but tested them first with friends. We pretty much agreed that they have a great texture and appearance, but are too sweet. I reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup and was happy with the results. Friends clamor for this cookie!

These are delicious. I used the ingredients as listed and froze the dough for 30 min instead of refrigerating it. They did spread and got thin, but they still taste and look great. I think that white chocolate chips would complement the taste. I'll definately make again. So easy!

For excellent how-to advice on packing and shipping cookies go to www.marthastewart.com and in the Search box type "shipping cookies" (without the quotes) and then select the second article. It provides details for shipping all types of cookies, including type of package, use of cushioning, the two-box ship method (inner and outer boxes) and decorative tips (ribbons, etc.). Hope this is helpful!

My search began for this recipe when I wanted to make it to send to my son at Ft. Leonard Wood, Mo. and maybe more for the troops in Iraq. The reason I chose it is because 1. they were my boys favorite and 2. one can make a lot of cookies that don't weigh much. I could not find my recipie. I originally got it from a Mrs. B, the mother of my children's sitter Sarah. I had lost track of Sarah. So I called one of her sisters, got her address. I was able to reconnect wtth her. She was going to e mail it to me. However, she could not find it, but said she had found it on epicurious - something I did not know about. I don't know how well they will ship - especially over seas. But, we will see. Got any packing suggestions?

Very good and very easy to make. I froze the dough for about 30 min. and then used an insulated baking sheet. This kept the cookies from spreading. They were puffy, light, flaky and good. They were a little thicker (still very airy and light) than what you would expect from a lace cookie, but they still melted in your mouth. They were also pretty sturdy and traveled very well.

A very sweet, crunchy, and buttery "oatmeal" sugar cookie. I added extra oatmeal to make it more substantial. A little cinnamon for a subtle flavor, choc chips too.

I think I accidentally discovered how to keep these wonderfully tasty cookies from spreading too much. I used quick cooking oatmeal (not instant), as it was all I had on hand. Since I was in a rush I froze the dough. Only other change was to use 3/4 cup of sugar, based on another cook's advice. I don't know if it was a result of using quick cooking oatmeal, but there was only a moderate amount of spreading, yet the cookies were crispy and lacey with little "see-through" parts. They travelled beautifully without breaking. I've made them a number of times and they always come out the same way--perfect! One of these days I'll get up the nerve to try them with regular oatmeal, but I don't see how they can get much better.

I remember making these as a child with my mother. Every Christmas we would make boxes and boxes of these cookies for friends and families! Please share the magic with your loved ones and create this delicious, delicate, cookie. You won't be dissapointed!

These are awesome! As I was mixing the ingredients, I was a little skeptical, but these turned out incredible! I always give out an assortment of goodies to friends and co-workers at Christmas, and these definitely will be a recipe I use this holiday! They are addictive! You can't eat just one!

This recipe gets zero forks from me... I am a huge fan of this website and usually every recipe I try is great. But I have to say that these cookies were a huge dissapointment. They were WAY too sweet and WAY too crumbly...Yuck!

These cookies are melt in your mouth good! I have made them over and over and get rave reviews every time.

The raw dough is even good. I licked the mixer blades clean. Not while it was on of course. The dough was crumbly before and after I cooked them. The only problem is the cookies crumbled to pieces before I could pick it up to my mouth. They are really delicate and don't travel well.

The more cookies I ate the better I thought the cookies were. They grew on me. I added nutmeg and cinnamon, that was good.

I really liked this recipe because they are fast, easy and economical. However, I thought they were a tad too sweet. I would definitely make them again but the next time I will decrease the amount of sugar

I made this recipe for my son's Kindergarden and everyone loved the cookies. My first batch burned because my timing was off but the second batch came out beautiful and delicious. This one is a keeper.

These were wonderful! I wish there was a way to keep them from spreading so much, though. Because they are so easy and inexpensive to make, I'm going to keep playing with the recipe.

I too just followed the recipe and they came out great...crispy and buttery. And even though the dough is a little crumbly when you take it out of the fridge, it won't matter a bit if you do the following: my suggestion is that you don't mold with your hands, because cold batter is the key. Use a tablespoon size measuring spoon and press the mixture firmly into it, then tap it out on the side of the mixing bowl. It keeps it's half-circle shape, so lay the flat side down on the parchment paper. When they're all out on the pan where you want them, use a spatula to flatten. Again, the key is for the dough to be straight out of the fridge so it's cold and will easily pop out of the measuring spoon (I used a metal spoon, but I don't think it should make a difference). If you have to do a batch at a time, return batter to the fridge until you're ready to do again, otherwise it'll stick to the spoon and won't tap out of the spoon easily.

It is absolutely yummy!! It's buttery, crispy, and great topping for vanilla ice cream! This cookie is very oily, and silpat helped me a lot to make this cookies.

I just followed the recipe and they came out absolutely perfect...cripsy little wafers of buttery oatmeal goodness. Yes, the dough is a little crumbly when you take it out of the fridge but if you mold it with your hands the warmth of your skin melts it just enough to stick together and make balls that I flattened with my palm. Room temperature butter, refrigerating for an hour and using parchment paper are all key.

If you follow this recipe according to the instructions,the cookies are perfect and the taste is sensational! I have a Kitchnaid mixer and they come out perfect everytime...the butter must be at room tempature.

I made these twice. Once with butter and once with margarine. They were better with the margarine as the batter did not seem as dry.

Rating: 3
the trick to these is to truly use a tiny teaspoon of batter, and set the unbaked cookies way out from one another on the sheet. they will really spread out across the sheet like you wouldnt believe. the timing on when to remove them from the cookiesheets is exact, too. its kind of a lot of work, and i would forgo any ideas of making these any other shape besides good ol' flat. you'll just get a headache if you try to curve them on a rolling pin

Has anyout out there made these yet? I'm wondering if I did something wrong... My batter was really dry, it wouldn't stick together at all, so I added an extra bit of egg white. The cookies all ran together in the oven, resulting in a thin, frail layer of something like oatmeal crust. It tasted good, though, so I'd like to try again, but not until I get some suggestions on how to make it work. Help!

Although mine came out a bit more crumbly than they looked in the picture, they sure tasted great and were a big hit at both my and my husband's workplace. Delicious!
