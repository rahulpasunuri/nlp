It's all about the sauce which is GREAT! The crab cakes without the sauce are just okay, really, no flavor but the nice delicate crab meat. I made half the recipe for my husband and I as a main course - 1 large crab cake each and lots of sauce. I served with an asparagus soup.

I already had a good crabcake recipe, so I really used this recipe for the sauce. The serving proportions seem way off -- 1 cup of sauce each for a main course serving??? Anyway, I halved the sauce recipe but used all the tomatoes, brandy, and carrots that were called for. It still fed 6 people as an entree with everyone having plenty of sauce. I also used about 1/3 cup sauteed shallots, adding 1/2 the brandy to the hot pan with the shallots, and then adding the clam juice and the cream and other ingredients. It smelled amazing while it was reducing, and the end result was wonderful.

I made these for a party on Sunday with a variety of dishes from this site. I also used tips from MANY previous reviewers. They were a huge hit. At the end of the evening a few guests picked the dish clean with their hands!!I used an entire Jalapeno,extra cayenne & vegetable stock for an AMAZING sauce. I used ersatz crab meat, less breading & baked the cakes on parchment for about 12 minutes. Fantasic results & response. Thanks for all those tips! Please keep them coming.

I must admit that I haven't tried this. But I grew up on the eastern shore of Md. And I will tell you that if you use real good crabmeat you don't want that much mayo or bread crumbs. Less is better in some cases..also..if you can find old bay seasoning it gives a nice kick to crabcakes( as well popcorn, hamburgers, chicken)and so on. Will look forward however to trying this in the future.

I really liked the sauce, it could even stand alone as a soup course. The crab cakes were somewhat bready, but when prepared I thought they were excellent in flavor and texture. I would recommend a nonstick skillet for cooking the crabcakes.

While I liked the sauce (I used a whole jalapeno), I thought the crab cakes were much too bready, too soft and not spicy enough. I'm still on the lookout for a better crab cake recipe.

I made this for a special dinner party. It was excellent. Guests asked for seconds. This is definitely the best crab cake recipe that I have found. The sauce is easy to adjust to your perferred taste.

I made this at a party recently and everybody loved it! It definitely was the favorite dish! I added scallions to the crab cakes and since I didn't want to be pan frying during a party, I sprayed them with a lot of olive oil, baked them at 400 for about ten minutes and then broiled until golden. The sauce was incredible and I added extra cayenne for more kick. I will absolutely make this again!

This dish is incredible! While making it for a party I tasted the sauce and, to borrow a phrase, it blew my mind. I ended up adding a bit more than a pinch of Cayenne for some more heat. Everyone at the part thought these were some of the best crab cakes they had ever eaten. My wife can't wait for me to make them again.

Great crab cakes! I definitely would make them again since my family loved them.

I was a little dissapointed since this got such great reviews...so maybe it was just me. The crab cakes were great, nice & simple. But as for the sauce, I couldn't get past the clam juice "funk" in the sauce. perhaps I would make again & use a veg broth or low sodium chicken broth...

The sauce brings out and compliments the flavors of the fish. It is especially good cold, as a base for an appetizeer such as smoked trout or salmon. I left out the carrot and increased the paprika. My guests loved it and it also looks good in the presentation.

We liked this dish, but think it needs some more kick to it. I wish we hadn't seeded the pepper and maybe add some more cayenne. It seemed to us to be more like cream of tomato soup with crab cakes. We'd make it again but with a little more spice, it also made a ton of sauce, way more than we needed. I even measured the reduced amount to make sure we were at 2 cups, I would definitely halve the sauce. We also only added 1/2 T of mayo and less than a cup of bread crumbs becuase we like a cleaner crab cake.

I have to be honest and say that I didn't actually make this recipe from start to finish. Don't get me wrong; the sauce I think is wonderful, but I just had to make some serious modifications to the crab cake itself. First of all, there is nothing like good, fresh, Maryland Blue crab (lump). I don't live there, but my parents do so I am able to keep four or five pounds in my freezer at all times. This recipe calls for waaaaay too much filler. I add no breading to my cakes at all, just seasonings (Old Bay is a biggie), and mayo. Whether fried or broiled, these cakes are all about crab. Otherwise, I endorse this recipe 100%.

WOW! The sauce makes this recipe. I used ersatz crab meat and this was fantastic. Since my wife and I enjoy spicy food, the other adjustment I made was to use a whole jalepeno instead of just a teaspoon. I'm anxious to try this in the summer when I will have real tomatoes from garden.

I made this recipe a couple of weeks ago for some friends and they cannot stop raving about both the crab cakes and the sauce. It was excellent.
