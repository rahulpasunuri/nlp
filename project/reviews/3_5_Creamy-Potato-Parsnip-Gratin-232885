Simple and tasty, but DO NOT cook at such a high temp for so long, covered! I should have realized this out of pure common sense, but I didn't... instead, set it up as instructed and left it unattended, only to come back 50 min later and find it violently bubbling over and making a huge mess of the oven. It needs to be uncovered for more time anyway for the milk mixture to reduce and thicken enough; otherwise you get hot milky potato soup.

Very good.... very easy.... made five hours ahead and finished it off just before

I made the complete dinner that this was part of and it was hands-down a perfect compliment to the lamb chops. I was worried it would be so-so, but was yummy! Used turkish bay leaves that I picked out before serving. Great addition to the wine pairing dinner.

Nice flavor. I used fresh bay, not turkish, and it worked fine. Used the correct size baking dish, but it bubbled out in the oven-be careful. Did bake ahead of time and then reheated. Makes alot more than 8 people can eat, probably enough for 12.

Served this dish with a Baked Ham and a pineapple casserole.There were 11 ladies at the dinner party and they all loved it.

This is a great company dish, bake it half way earlier in the day, then finish it off when you are ready. I did not put the bay leaves in, instead I substituted lots of tarragon for a fabulous dish everyone RAVED about! Try it!

This was okay but not a lot of flavor. What can 4 bay leaves do in a 13 X 9 dish? I tried it as part of the menu with the Herbed Lamb Chops.

Simple, full of flavour, this dish is a wonderful accompaniment to any meal. You will even convert those who are adverse to parsnips! Substitute celery root (celeriac) for the parsnips for an equally tantilizing dish.
