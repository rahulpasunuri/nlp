I added a bay leaf and replaced one cup of water with one cup of white wine, also used a sprig of rosemary to liven this one up a bit, definitely made a nice punch!

This recipe is so effortless for great results. I made it so I'd have beans for Scallops with White Bean Puree and Hazelnut Vinaigrette. I used half a pound of beans for half a recipe then used half of the cooked beans for the scallop recipe. This bean recipe is healthier than those using bacon, carrots, onion and the usual suspects. It'll be a repeat at my house.

I had a little bit of a texture problem with the beans, not sure if it was because they ended up soaking for 2 nights instead of one, but they weren't as creamy as I hoped. However the flavor was divine. I ate them on toast with bacon. Then my husband sauteed up some veggies and made the bean base into a delicious rustic soup. Fabulous!

I love cooking cannellini when I can find them and this was a great starter recipe..have made 2 of the sister recipes as well. Agree you need to keep the garlic in the mix after beans are cooked..I might add a little more sage next time just to up the flavor, or as someone else suggests, rosemary. These freeze very well and cooking in a slo- cooker keeps the heat in the kitchen down to nothing!

I made as directed (except I had to use navy beans; couldn't find cannellini dried) and thought the beans were delicious plain and in the sausage & tomato sauce recipe. One caveat--I ony ended up with 5 cups cooked instead of 8 (probably because navy beans are smaller).

Good recipe. Not sure why, but the beans didn't get as soft as we wanted. Still, very good!

We made these for the sausage and beans recipe, and they were so delicious we could have eaten them all while we cooked the sausage! We made them exactly as directed, they came out fantastic..great flavor. Just one note, instead of just discarding the head of garlic ( seemed like a waste) we squeezed the cloves out and covered them with some olive oil and used it to dip crusty bread. Very yummy. Can't wait to make it again.

Was great. Used many of the tips in the recipe reviews on this site. Also made Sausages with White Beans in Tomato Sauce found on Epicurious' site. I used chicken broth since I couldn't find stock, and I discovered that half of what I put in was beef stock. (Dumb me!) However, hat didn't seem to hurt. In addition to the whole garlic bulb with the top cut off, I also used 4 or five mashed cloves and a lump of butter. I didn't put in any peppercorns but simply ground in a generous amount of black pepper. And I did spread some of the cooked, softened garlic on French bread

i followed the directions exactly and got very creamy beans. they actually started to fall apart a bit, maybe because i stirred too much? also, i didn't think i needed to add any extra liquid toward the end, but after the beans cooled in the water, there was no liquid left. kind of gloppy. BUT i had the beans on some spinach sauteed with olive oil and red pepper flakes, and it was delicious. the drizzle of olive oil and course salt on top really made it. i also made a dip from the beans, the garlic, cayenne, paprika, olive oil, and salt. lemon might be good in that. it turned out super creamy. i will have that later with a drizzle of olive oil and more paprika and cayenne on top.

Yum. Made these to use in other recipes, but they are lovely on their own too. (I just mashed a clove of the garlic in with a lump of butter and more salt and pepper... Mmm..) The sage undertones are subtle in the beans, stronger in the cooking liquid. The garlic is heavenly.Next time I'll try cooking them in chicken stock for richer flavor. I have a feeling this will be a winter staple.

Great on their own and as a starter for many other recipes.

I found these beans to be unimpressive. Also, it took a lot longer for them to cook than the recipe said and they never truly reached the creamy stage I usually get. That may be because they were supposed to tie in with other recipes and be cooked again but I think after cooking a pot of beans all evening there should be something edible for all the work.

This recipe is classic and simple. To the cook from Washington, DC, search this site for 'tuna and white beans' and look for the October 09 reference, also a really good recipe.

I made these to serve with chicken cacciatore. Very tasty, but picking the whole peppercorns out of the finished product was a pain! I found the flavor a bit too subtle, so I added more salt and pepper and some of the cooked garlic cloves. Tomorrow night the leftovers will go in the soup recipe from this same article.

This recipe really caught my eye. After reading all the helpful reviews, I'd really love to try this as well as some of the "sister recipes". Can someone tell me where I can find the sister recipes? Also, what the tuna and onion recipe is called?

I'd like to alert everyone buying the beans that I have found in some stores, that the bags only contain 14 OUNCES, instead of 16 ounces, of beans!

This was my first time cooking beans not from a can, and I found this recipe easy, and tasty. (For Canadian cooks, a 900g bag of dry beans is close to 2 lbs, and yields a heck of a lot of cooked beans!) I used them in the Sausage with white beans in tomtao sause recipe and a White bean and kale Soup recipe from the Gourmet Cookbook that must also be avaliable on this site. Both were delicious.

Once the beans are cooked let them cool and put two cups in your food processor add more olive oil and some fresh sage and puree it. Serve with Pita crisps as a dip. WONDERFUL for a snack

I made a double batch of the beans in the morning and let them sit all day. By the time I used them in the evening and the next day the flavor (as with all Italian things) just got better and better and.....I used them in the Sausages with white beans and Tomato Sauce and the White Bean and Pasta Soup. Both mentioned recipees are found right her at epicurious and in my epi profile if you want quick access to them. What a winner!

I simmered the beans in vegetable broth in the slow cooker. The garlic was soft and spreadable--it went right on to French bread.

These were delicious. Would absolutely recommend crushing the garlic for more flavor. These beans were fabulous when used in the Sausage with white beans and tomato sauce recipe also featured in the same article. The flavor was amazing and improved each day. 2 of us ate it for a week.

very good and easy. one thing if you soak your beans overnight then you won't need to cook them as long as the recipe states. they will get too mushy. i also tried one of the sister recipes (the one with the tuna and onion) and it was delish!

First time making beans from scratch instead of using canned beans. Definitely think it was worth the time.

Not exactly fast, but certainly easy and cheap, and a good base for many a recipe!

I followed the Cook from NYC's advice and smashed the garlic rather than submerge the entire head. I think that helped with the flavor for sure. I also used an extremely large sprig of sage from the garden and the flavor that was imparted was pleasant yet still on the subtle side. My wife and I enjoyed it.

I was irrationally excited to make this recipe after seeing it in the magazine, having never cooked dried beans before. The results were /extremely/ subtle--the beans imbued with just a hint of garlic and sage. I might suggest smashing the garlic cloves instead of just submerging the entire head of garlic; next time I will also make an effort to find the freshest dried beans I can. About a third of them turned to mush before the rest were cooked through. Anyway, while the beans weren't excellent, the sister recipe ("Sausages with White Beans in Tomato Sauce") was absolutely delicious! I can recommend that wholeheartedly.
