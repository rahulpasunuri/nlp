This recipe was really good; definitely one to keep in the back pocket for 'quick and easy'. I had it with good quality vanilla ice cream, but found it could use one more flavour, and would add some granola, or even just cinnamon, next time.

This recipe was DELICOUS! I made it for my birthday as desert. I served it room temperature and it was great, no ice cream needed. Everyone loved it. I probably quadrupled or maybe even quintupled the recipie and I found that I needed more sauce. Extra sauce is made easily with more sugar, rum, water, and raisins if you want more! I highly recommed this recipe!!!

If I'd cooked the pears the full time, they would have been mushy. Removed them after 10 min. -- 8 min. would have been better. Depends on the pear, I guess.

A quick, light dessert. Might be nice with a little vanilla ice cream, too...
