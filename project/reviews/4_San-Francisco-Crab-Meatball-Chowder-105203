I made this last weekend because it's crab season here in San Francisco. Used fresh crab (not from a can), expensive but worth it. Am pescetarian so left out the bacon. Had to add more stock--4 cups was not enough. The chowder was delicious! Was asked to make it again tonight for my out of town family's visit.

I am not a seafood soup fan really, but made this recipe because I had some crab I needed to use. I did like it, and very filling. I used Townhouse butter crackers which helped make really great meatballs.

A fair amount of work--but really great!

good and different but missing something. I'm going to try again and add old bay to the balls. I also used king crab.

Used King crab legs instead of the dungeness. Was "OK" that way, but saved time. pretty tasty 3.5 forks!

Good stuff. don't overdo it on the bay seasonings - they can be too much. I couldn't get the recommended crabs, so I substituted king crab legs with great (and probably easier) results.
