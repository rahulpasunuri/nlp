I really liked this a lot. I roasted the mushrooms to get them really brown and crispy, and sauteed the garlic with some diced zucchini instead to give the tacos more substance. Really great flavors, the only thing I would change is to use less queso fresco - it just felt like too much cheese for the amount of veggies.

Wow, this was good. I used diced canned chiles because I didn't feel like going to the store and they worked out great. I didn't use the epazote leaves or the queso fresco, just the anejo. Super, super good.

I made these for my good friend from Mexico City and we both loved them! The epazote gives them an authentic flavor. A great alternative to the typical veggie tacos I make. Fresh, healthy, delicious, what more could you ask for?

This is fantastic. We're in Mexico now and this has the authentic flavor. It's easy once you've prepared the poblanos. The epazote is a key flavor, but it's hard to find fresh if you're not in Mexico. I'm going to try to grow it at home next summer. We used Oaxaca cheese because we had it already and couldn't find the specialty cheeses in the neighborhood mercado. It was great. I'll use feta next time when my daughter visits---easier for the lactose-intolerant. So tasty!

This is a great summer recipe. Lots of flavor! I made it once as the recipe is written, and once vegan. Both were great. I did think the salsa could have used a few more peppers, but I just like hot salsa.

These were great! My sister is a vegan so we just served the cheese on the side and those who wanted it could add it. Really good, and very easy to make!

Very tasty. I didn't find the Anaheim peppers, so I used 2 large poblanos instead. I also had some leftover pork from this website's "Memphis Ribs" so I chopped the meat and added it to the veggies. Very nice blend of flavors and textures.
