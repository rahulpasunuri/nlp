This is my very favorite flan recipe. I always substitute an additional tablespoon of vanilla extract for the coconut extract to avoid using artificial flavoring (I haven't been able to find coconut extract). I usually skip step 5 and simply sprinkle the flan with toasted coconut shortly before serving. Delicious!

I made this for my family and a guest and we all loved it! It does take a long time to cook and needs to be watched closely or it will overcook, but it tastes WONDERFUL!

This was truly terrible. The recipe says to bake for 2 1/2 to 3 hours. I set the timer for 2 hours, and when I went to check it, it was completely overbaked and basically like scrambled eggs. Also, the flavor was not good. The coconut extract gave an odd, un-natural flavor. I would NOT recommend this, but if you do make it, watch it carefully!!
