This was excellent. Served this to my boyfriend. We'd just watched "Annie Hall" and were inspired by the lobster scenes (Woody Allen: "there's a huge lobster stuck behind the fridge! Maybe if I put a bowl of melted butter and a nutcracker down there, he'd run out the other side!"). I too was a bit squeamish about cooking the lobsters, I've never done it before, and I too thought the loud whistling sound was them screaming in agony. What brave soul first thought of eating these things? When I brought them home and set them down on the floor, the cat took one look, turned, and ran. I didn't see the cat for days.

I think the reason you have to cook them live when whole is that there is a toxin in them that is released shortly after death. (to ward off sea-dwelling predators)You can get them raw/frozen only in the tail or claw sections because they take out the nervous system parts that dispense the toxin. I heard all of this on some cooking show - so as far as I know this is the reason for cooking them alive (yuck) ALSO - the squeaking is not them "screaming" it is the steam going thru them, like a teapot. Hope that helps.

My husband is from Maine and although we live in Seattle, we constantly have Lobster's (or sea bugs as he calls them) flown in. I have a tip for the woman that finds boiling them alive "cruel". Poor a full can of beer in the boiling water, this kills their pain and makes them taste fantastic.

Moo! I don't begrudge anyone their feelings or beliefs but come on, we as a species didn't spend millions of years clawing our way to the top of the food chain to eat grass. Enjoy the noble lobster. Just not the green stuff.

To the cook from Toronto who wonders about cooking lobster while still alive, why is this anymore cruel than killing something and cooking/eating it later? Have you ever seen a fish die after being fished out of the water? They writhe and slowly suffocate. How about the way veal, a.k.a. baby calves, are killed? Lobsters die almost instantly, as soon as they hit the boiling water. Also, lobsters have nervous systems similar to that of an insect, not highly evolved. People need to get over this warped idea of cruelty. Not trying to justify my love of eating lobster, but I think the way cattle and chickens are raised and then slaughtered is a lot more cruel, a lot more offensive.

Ok, I've only eaten lobster once, when on vacation in Prince Edward Island, because when in Rome....and Dalvay by the Sea is a BEAUTIFUL hotel, I was lucky enough to take a little unauthorized tour, due to the fact that they were renovating the entire place when I was there. It's even more lovely than shown on the 'Road to Avonlea' TV series. Really worth a visit. But I never ever realized that lobsters are cooked while still ALIVE ... isn't that cruel? Can't they be somehow more humanely killed before boiling? Sheesh! (I'm kind of glad I don't eat shellfish or any fish for that matter).

This is really a classic "how-to-cook-a-lobster" recipe for someone who really hasn't done it before. Nothing wrong with it, but a bit time consuming for summer entertaining. I did this recipe over the course of a day beside the beach/pool and completed it in stages, which was good. I couldn't see following the recipe from start to finish without many dips in the water for the cook!
