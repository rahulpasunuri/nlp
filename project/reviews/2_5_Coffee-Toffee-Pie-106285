Got burned, crust sucked, and the filling was soupy. It ruined my present for my mother on mother's day. BEWARE!

absolutely wonderful. I only had instant espresso on hand so that was not hard to take either. Tastes so rich and creamy and smooth.

I worked at the Blums Downtown at Macy's back in 1966 and the original was MUCH better! This is okay - but it's NOT "Blum's." I do have the original Blum's Coffee Crunch Cake recipe if anyon's interested...

I have the old recipe from Blums and it is the very best. Fat and all.

I used to stand in line behind people eating at the counter at Blum's waiting for a piece of their Coffee Toffee Pie--It was fantastic back in the '60s. Any chance you can find the original recipe and share?

Good stuff, maynard. However, the corn starch was a pain in the coccyx, and being very lazy, I will probably use chocolate pudding mixed with rum and coffee granules for the filling the next time I prepare this pie. Everyone who tried it said "It's different, but very good."

I found this recipe very easy and fun to make. I took the pie to a Easter dinner and everyone loved it. It is definitely an evening dessert and a good way to "wind down" after a busy gathering.I did increase the gelatin to one full individual packet to help with consistency of filling. Also I used a piece of waxed paper over the hot crust mixture as I pushed it into the bottom of pan so it didn't burn my fingers.

I made this using a pie plate instead of a springform pan and did not have a problem with he consitency of the filling as others have mentioned. I loved the flavours of the filling and topping but thought the crust was terrible. It seemed a shame to make such a potentially great dessert only to have it ruined by the crust. I would stick to the original nut crust, rice krispies really are for kids.

I would rather try the full fat recipe. It is a dessert! And chocolate at that!

Phew! I'm glad to know that others experienced the same problem I did -- the filling was soupy. Also, the crust more or less disappeared when I poured the filling over it. We ate ours with a spoon and then put the rest in the freezer.

I made this last week. First of all, I burned my thumb really badly on the crust. I accidently touched some while trying to get it in the pie plate - OUCH! The crust did not stay together (I would have preferred a Rice Krispies recipe with marshmallows - would be easier - and I would melt the chocolate and then put it on the crust, as mine did not melt at all). What I ended up doing was to break the crust base up, add it to the chocolate (mine set up no problem) and pour it into a ready made graham cracker pie shell. Then I finished it as per recipe. It was quite good, but I don't think I would bother with it again as it was impossible to make as per recipe.

I agree with the Connecticut cook, ie something's off with the gelatin amount. The filling never set whatsoever, and I had to "pour" it into a pie dish to serve it up! The tase was great, so maybe there will be a measurement correction in next month's issue?? Please please??!!

My daughter, home from college, tried to make this. The crust did not stay together. After pouring the sugar mixture on the rice krispies, it cooled immediately and the chocolate did not melt. We placed it in the oven hoping to melt the whole thing into one piece. The chocolate melted but the crust never came together. The filling did not jell. The amount of gelatin in the recipe must be wrong. After three hours we still had a soupy mixture. I added about two additional teaspoons of gelatin that I poured over a tablespoon of cold water, let sit, and melted. This helped somewhat but the filling never got firm. There was not enough topping to go on this. The general consensus was the taste was great so we would try it again to see if we were just having a bad day.
