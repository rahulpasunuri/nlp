In my northern kitchen i have learned from my mother in law to substitute raw winter squash. Use a very fine mandolin, julienne, grate with a grater, or shave with a veggie peeler, just get it thin and it is a wonderful winter salad that can fulfil my ethics for local food and my palate for amazing food. So good to have that crunch in the winter. Yum!

Green papaya salad (som tum) is one of my favorite dishes to order off thai menus. I've been searching local markets for green papaya and finally found an asian market nearby! I was also able to find the dried shrimp there as well. The recipe turned out great. I reduced the chiles by about 1/2 and it still packed plenty of heat. I made this once before using fresh papaya and it was also delicious. Traditionally this dish is servied with chunks of tomato, crushed peanuts, shoestrings of carrot and blanched long beans. I will serve with all next time.

Papaya Salad is a spicy, sweet, and crunchy salad, a favorite among Thai women and you will love it if you make it right... However, this recipe is missing the Long Beans and Peanuts. In Thailand long beans and peanuts are added which give extra crunch. Also dried shrimp and fish sauce are used and add great flavor so don't be afraid to use them and you will love them afterwards (If you are vegetarian sub soy sauce and leave out shrimp). If your not in Thailand Long Beans, Green Papaya, and Bird Chiles (Thai Chiles) can be hard to find. Find a Thai market these items. Alternatively, use Green Mango or even find the most unripe mango instead of Green Papaya. Julianne mango (don't grate). Ripe papaya won't work and carrots are not even a close substitution so don't listen to that review! Long beans can be substituted with fresh green beans. Most Asian markets carry dried baby shrimp too.

Being Vietnamese, I love this salad bc it's so close to the salads my mom used to make. However, for those of u who r adverse to fishy smells, I'd definitely stay away from the dried shrimp and maybe even the fish sauce. You can substitute fresh shrimp or shredded chicken for the dried shrimp and salt the salad to taste w table salt. And if you can't find green papaya, green mango works just as well. And by all means add jicama, carrots, and cilantro.

Every papaya I looked at was ripe, ripe, ripe, so I used a combination of shredded carrots (as per comments) and jicama. I added a lot of chopped cilantro and upped the other seasonings/ingred. as per reviewer suggestions. I really liked this.

I didn't have shrimp, and used jalapenos instead of thai chilis, and carrots instead of papaya. I added some chopped peanuts. Fantastic!

I served this dish at my Oscars party and not a shred was leftover. Just as good as a Thai restaurant! I followed the suggestions of other cooks and added extra dried shrimp, toasted macadamia nuts, and cherry tomatoes.

Unfortunately, I DID make this dish for guests and we all agreed that it was terrible. Fortunately, they were close friends and everything else I made was delicious.

My mum's Thai and this is exactly her recipe for this salad. Green papayas weren't always available, so we made this with shredded carrots growing up. I leave out the chili peppers, I don't like hot food(yes, yes I know that's weird)and it still flavorful and light. Get yourself a breath mint for afterwards, that amount of raw garlic will send vampires running for their lives

As a chef tht lived in Thailand I can assure you... add shredded cabbage, cherry tomatoes, use dried shrimp instead of nam plaa, and add a few crushed toasted peanuts... MAJOR YUMMY!

This recipe is great, but I've been told to add shrimp or crab paste to make it more authentic. You have to be sure to use the GREEN papaya and they are not in season all year long. Another great substitute for the papaya are unripened green pears. If you don't like fish sauce it's really not for you.

This is a fantastic salad. Green papayas are not always available but tart Granny Smith apples make a wonderful substitute. We don't add shrimp but serve the juliened apple on hearts of Romaine or Bib lettuce sprinkled with crushed peanuts. Hold back on the chilis for newbies.

I love this papaya salad! I first had it in a Thai restaurant and it has become my favorite dish. I use only 2 chiles though because I can't take the heat. The next time I will make it the traditional Thai way with salted brown crab crushed into it. I also steam sweet (sticky) rice as a side dish. The hot and cold dishes compliment each other nicely.

This dish was pretty disgusting...I tried adding coriander and some peanuts but it continued to be gross - thank god I didnt make it for guests! (too bad the dish wasnt great bc in Rio we have papaya all year long)
