Made this for the first time as is, and I thought it was very good. I may add more curry next time. Real easy and would be great for a change up weeknight meal.

Its a good base but needs to be tweaked. I breaded the chops in Panko then baked them. For the Sate Sauce, I doubled the recipe, but used 1/3 less peanuts, 3x more mild curry paste, 1/3 c lime juice, 2T fresh grated ginger, 2 garlic cloves, salt and the entire can of coconut milk. If your coconut milk is separated, DONT MIX IT! Drain the water and use the creamy goodness that is left! Thats the best part!! After the chops were baked I spread the sauce (that after sauteed was a paste) thickly onto the chops. Was delicious like that, served with saffron rice.

Not that great... the sauce had too much fish flavor and it didn't really improve the pork chops. But it is quick and easy!

This was okay...if I made it again, I'd make revisions to the sauce which was unremarkable--add some cilantro, cut back on the Asian fish sauce (which I guess we just don't really care for), consider lime juice instead of vinegar, perhaps add ginger as another reviewer suggested. Or maybe it's just a lot easier to find a better sate sauce! Quick does not have to mean less flavorful...

I've made this twice now, and both times a big hit with family, especially given the prep time (FAST). A keeper.

I think it's important to keep in mind that this is a "Quick Kitchen" everyday meal. The sauce was great for the short amount of prep time. You can easily adjust it to your tastes, I made it more spicy, and thicker with more peanuts. It was versatile as well. We used the leftovers the next day to brush on chicken before grilling (which I highly recommend; the flavor is great cooked onto the meat). Definitely worth it for an easy weeknight meal that is different and simple.

Even 2 forks is a stretch - this sauce is unremarkable and the meat needs more than salt and pepper. There are MUCH better satay and peanut sauce recipes out there! My thrifty, leftover-loving husband told me to throw out the sauce instead of saving it for lunch the next day. That says it all!

This was an easy recipe that too no time at all, I didnt have dry roasted peanuts, so I substituted with organic dry roasted peanut butter. I avoided any that was already creamy, I thought the extra oil would make it too oily tasting. The sauce also tastes good with some rice and eggs in the morning ( of course I will mix anything). I cooked it several days ago and I still eat the sauce!! Good stuff! I used boneless pork chops and marinated them, and they were tasty!

I think this is a good base for Thai-style satay sauce. To balance the flavors a bit, I doubled the coconut milk, added a couple slices of fresh ginger (discarded before serving), a minced clove of garlic, and a squeeze of lime. The flavors bloom in the fridge--- it's better the second day (I served over rice noodles). Garnishing with sliced green onion and fresh cilantro really brightens the flavors and adds a welcome complexity to the dish. Also, not all fish sauce is created equal--- Thai style is much gentler than Vietnamese, so add to taste, carefully!

I thought this was a very tasty weeknight dish.....I added a TBSP of peanut butter. Sauce would be good on chicken or grilled shrimp as well.

I thought the sauce was quite boring. I even added extra red curry in an attempt to make it a little more interesting. The peanuts were overpowering.

That sauce had a wonderful tang, even though I was missing both peanuts and curry paste. I substituted peanut butter and Sharwood's hot curry powder. Wonderful on the Cumin Herb Rice Pilaf as well. Will make sure to follow the recipe next time, because there will definitely be a next time.
