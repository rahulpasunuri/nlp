This was good, and I'd make it again, but there is a better version out there. It was in Gourmet several years after this appeared, and it's called "Baked Eggs With Spinach."

I also skipped boiling the spinach, and sauteed only. I added a clove of garlic,a dash of cayenne,crumbled bacon and topped the eggs after baking with leftover cheese sauce. I will make this again with these additions.

Different from your ordinary breakfast but my husband would have added a second egg in the ramekin and added some bacon as a side dish and maybe pan fried potatoes but we thought it was very tasty.

Like the previous posters, I went straight to sauteeing the spinach (skipped boiling it) and it was fine. I also was too lazy to measure ingredients, so I eyeballed the whole recipe and it was fine! This was easy, yummy, and quick. Winnah!

I saved time by buying a 10-oz. bag of Fresh Express baby spinach leaves from the produce section of my grocery store. They are so tender that they don't need to be boiled first - I simply chopped and sauteed them right from the bag. I don't like my eggs runny, but I do like the combination of eggs and spinach, so I cracked open each egg into a cup and scrambled it with a fork before pouring it over the spinach in the ramekin. This way, my eggs remained tender even though cooked through. It reminds me of a quiche without a crust. I think I will add mushrooms next time - or maybe some cheese.

Very fast and easy. I didn't have cream on hand so I used 1% milk, feta, and parmesan cheese in the spinach. I served it over pasta to make it more substantial. The eggs turned to rubber. Next time I'll try scrambled instead.

This was very good. It's easy to see why they say to serve immediately as after removing from the oven, the egg yolks very quickly deflate...
