Um no this recipe does not work and when you make it work it comes out nothing like the picture. I am very skilled in the kitchen specializing in baking and cakes. I gave it 2 forks because after SEVERAL tweaks it tastes good and looks ok. The glaze alone I had to add vanilla and about 10-15X the amount of powdered sugar. But definitely does not look like the picture and kind of a pain in the butt. Great for a cookie but not a "mini doughnut" I would make it again as a regular cookie.
