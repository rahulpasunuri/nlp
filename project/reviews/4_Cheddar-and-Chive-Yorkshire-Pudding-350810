used butter for the vegetarians in attendance but had wonderful drippings to top them with from the rib roast i also served. i used a muffin tin in lieu of ramekins. these puffed up beautifully, but mine also overcooked slightly as another cook noted. still, very flavorful and impressive. my guests enjoyed them thoroughly!

Yum...made for xmas dinner and loved them! I used butter, not beef drippings, and I baked them in muffin tins. My only problem was they were a bit overcooked (even though I decreased cooking time from what the recipe states). They were pretty badly stuck to the sides of the muffin pan, but what I managed to pry out was delicious!

Very good! I used a muffin tray with good results. Using too much cheese turns these very chewy, so watch out - and make sure to get the oven hot, as the recipe suggests, before putting them in. The 2nd time I made these I did not and they stuck to the pan's sides, making for an annoying 10 minutes of carefully cutting around each with a butter knife to pry them out.

Used butter rather than the roast beef drippings so that they would be vegetarian friendly. Baked in muffin tins, since I didn't have anything else, and they turned out delicious.

Great!! I combined the wet ingredients a couple of hours before hand and whisked often to get lots of air entrained. Added dry ingredients just before putting in oven.

Turned out magnificently. Did use butter rather than fat drippings. Puffed beautifully. Delicious taste. Even good the next day rewarmed in the oven, split and filled with leftover porcini-spinach stuffing.

Went very well with a Christmas rib roast. Of course, used pan drippings which adds flavor. Will use this recipe again next year!
