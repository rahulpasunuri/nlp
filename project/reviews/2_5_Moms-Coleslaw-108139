I made the version with Old Bay and mayo and it is positively the worst coleslaw ever. I made 2 other coleslaws the same day, a traditional mayo and sugar based version with white cabbage and the curried coleslaw ( 3 1/2 forks)from this site. The only left over was Mom's.

This recipe is good. However, if you use celery seed, think about starting with 1/4 to 1/2 the recommended amount and taste before adding more.

Would really love to try receipts such as this, but i suspect that to many cooks these prepared spices just arn't available. Very frustrating!

Very good coleslaw, extremely easy. It did make quite a large portion, much more than 4-6 side dish servings. It did taste just as good up to 3 days later.
