Hubby made this for dinner tonight. It was delicious. We used steak instead of veal and finished them on the grill instead of in the oven since the weather is so nice. Excellent meal and the flavors blend beautifully.

Not often do I rate 4 stars to a recipe but this menu went beyond my expectations. Since veal chops are so expensive I wanted a really good recipe and all the components of this recipe really delivered. I made the sherry gastrique and the peperonata the day before. Since there was only my husband and I, I halved the sherry gastrique -- this was so good I could have drank the entire sauce by itself. The roasted peperonata I halved -- again I could have eaten it all by myself it was so good. The only change I made was we grilled the veal chops, so I rubbed the chops with olive oil, sprinkled liberally with salt & pepper and mixture of fresh thyme and all spice. Omitted the flour and browning the chops. This was better than any restaurant meal -- only thing missing was someone to serve & clear the table. Served with sour cream & chive mashed potatoes and green beans dressed with drizzle of olive oil. Bottle of good red wine and it was a most memorable meal. This is definitely a keeper for family and for company.

Made the recipe as is with no problems. No need to tweak ingredients or temperature. Gastrique was quite delicious though I didn't prefer the peperonata. Will make the dish again but with plain roasted coloured peppers to accompany.

The gastrique base needs to be boiled for longer than 30 minutes for a thicker consistency. Also, I went a little heavy on the brown sugar (as I usually do) and I made a mistake there because it came out a little too sweet. 1/4 cup as directed, or even a little less, would be just fine. I substituted center cut pork chops for the veal chops (over $10/lb price difference) and they came out very nice. The oven does not need to be on 425 to finish them, maybe 350. You don't want the meat drying out. This was really simple and delicious and I would def make it again, taking into consideration my own observations.

Very good sauce, although I will cut back a bit on the brown sugar next time. I had it over beef filets and got great reactions from our guests. I also used bottled roasted red peppers, worked out fine but the added color of yellow and orange peppers would have been nice.

Fabulous! See my review of the Roasted Peperonata for a time saving way to do it. This recipe was a big hit.

This dish with the accompanying peperonata and sherry reduction sauce was a study in complex taste delights...the only thing I changed was in the peperonata, switching out dried cranberries in place of golden raisins (very raisin-like, but seemed like a good substitute during the holidays) which really worked out well. I took all the ingredients in coolers to our vacation cabin rental which -it probably goes without saying- has a full kitchen. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed multi-tasking to get the meal on the table with everything ready including a wonderful mushroom casserole with crunchy panko and parmesan cheese all crunchy on top. A meal for the record books for this kitchen-loving couple!

Made the entire recipe as written except that I seared chops in duck fat. I also sauteed onions for risotto in duck fat that I had left over from another day. The sauce was excellent, slightly sweet and combined with the tart pepperonata, a nice balance.

Made as directed except used regular paprika and butter instead of chicken fat. Came out great. Quite an elegant meal.

Made the entire recipe. Absolutely outstanding. However, would make only for special company since veal chops are sooo expensive. Could probably substitute pork chops.
