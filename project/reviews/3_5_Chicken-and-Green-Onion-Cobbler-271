I made this exactly as instructed, and while it was good, it wasn't good enough to justify how much work it was or how long it took to put together. I expect something that takes two hours to be exceptional, and this wasn't that.

This was good. We liked the cornmeal in the crust. It was a bit of work for what it turns out to be, but I loved that I could make it a day ahead and just pop it in the oven for casual guests.

This was good, but a lot of work for just good. Also, I made a mistake and used only 2 Tbsp of butter in the filling, and it was plenty. I can't imagine really using a full stick.

Come on, people - this is NOT supposed to be haute cuisine. It's COMFORT FOOD! And darned good comfort food at that. Yes, it's a bit time consuming, but well worth it. I've yet to serve it to anyone who didn't love it for what it was, which is just plain old good food.

I have to say, this just didn't do it for me. It wasn't terrible, but neither I nor my husband thought it was anything special. Just okay.

I love this recipe and my guests do too! I leave the ham out and add potatoes though.

This is a great little recipe! I've used left over chicken and it works just as well. Wonderful comfort food.

This was fantastic. Pretty time consuming, but a great way to spend a rainy Saturday. I followed the recipe exactly, other than to add some fresh tarragon to the sauce. Will definetly make again, maybe next time I'll add sliced mushrooms...

I have made this dish several times. I usually just boil the chicken in water with a few bouillon cubes added. Otherwise, I follow the directions exactly. Once or twice, I have had trouble with the sauce not thickening up but, then, I just served it in bowls, instead of on plates. Still delicious!

My 1st chkn pot pie. I thought it was bland and ok, but everyone else loved it .. so I would mk it again for them. Substituted cayenne for saffron in the gravy. Next time might use a mixture of fennel and celery seeds. 1.5hrs prep. 1/2 the recipe in 11x7x2 dish wkd great.

How to say this nicely? I wish I knew where the cooks from No. Cal. lived, so I could take the 7 leftover servings to one or more of their houses. This is the first "100-percenter" from this site that I completely disagree with. I'm going to put it in the fridge overnight and see if anything changes, but if not, my dogs will probably enjoy it.

This is a nice weeknight recipe. My two-year olds loved it. Next time I may try to cut out some of the butter to lower the fat content.

This was wonderful. I made it for a crowd and everyone loved it. It was easy to make everything the night before, except for the topping, and throw that together at the last minute. I added mushrooms and used homemade chicken broth. The filling is very homey, and the cobbler topping makes it just a bit different. Will definitely be making this again.

This is truly a hit - it's great for people who like American standard cooking, and sophistocated eaters don't think it's plain or cliche. Kids like it too. Yumm yumm.

I've made this three times now and it has always been good. This time was the best with following additions. Probably 3+ forks. I used breasts with skin and ribs as called for instead of boneless breasts. I added some mushrooms, fresh chopped garlic and a scant 1/4 tsp cayanne peppper to the broth. I added 1/2 tsp of Herbs de Provence to the crust. It makes a ton. The 1st time I thought I made a huge mistake for two, but it quickly disapeared.

I made a turkey over the weekend and cubed the left overs.....didnt add the ham. I also added pan sauteed onions and mushrooms with minced garlic. The gravy needs more spice...I used Cayenne and red pepper flakes.....perfect !!! I made everything but the topping the night before.......Very good cold weather comfort food.

This recipe is easy to make but a little time consuming. It takes about 1.5 hours to make from start to finish. The end product is worth the time! A delicious combination of flavors. I left out the ham and cut down the amount of chicken but that didn't detract from the flavor at all. Just be sure and serve it for a crowd--it easily feeds eight people!

Delicious! Time consuming, though. The second time I made it, I used boneless thigh meat (boiled for 15 minutes) and shredded it instead. I also added peas and celery. YUM!

This is truly the ultimate comfort food. I did make some changes though. I used homemade chicken stock (because I had lots on hand). Along with the other veggies,I used peas and corn (both frozen) and mushrooms, sauteed first. I also used a SMOKY German prosccuito (sp?)from Trader Joe instead of the ham. I aded a tiny bit of cayenne to the topping batter and instead of parsley I used a dried herb mix from Penzey's (I LOVE Penzey's) called Parisien Bonnes Herbes. I am a huge advocate of fresh herbs but in the topping, the dried works well. Pretty too. I agree that the topping according to the recipe was a bit scant...I doubled it on the advice of several reviewers, because I used more veggies, I had more filling. I made one large 1.75 litre gratin pan and three small individual servings from the recipe (with my adjustments). Next time I will use whole cut up chicken, no more trouble than the bone-in, skin on breasts and I think the mix of dark and white meat would be nice in this dish.

Yummy, yummy. Haven't really been cooking for the past 4 months as I have a new born and can't find the time. Glad I started back with recipe - it was worth the effort!

After tasting this dish, my husband declared it the best thing I've ever made for him. Simple, yet time-consuming recipe is well worth the work. I think I'd even serve it at a casual dinner party; wonderful flavors and the topping really makes it. My only criticism is that the quantity on the topping is a little scanty; I'll increase the recipe next time.

This dish was terrific! Didn't have any trouble getting anyone to eat the leftovers. My family wants me to make it once a week! I agree with the cook from Los Angeles, you can adapt it in a variety of ways depending upon what you have on hand.

Lovely dish! This dish is recommended to go with Sauvignon Blanc, which is why I made it. I can see why! It's comfort food, yet elegant. Definite small dinner party dish.

Excellent make ahead dish. Homey, Yummy comfort food. Everyone loved it. (Freezes well too-without the topping)

Although I didn't follow the recipe, I still give this dish four forks. It was very adaptable and lended itself quite deliciously to the Mexican makeover I gave it. I kept the proportions the same, but substituted other things for the "American" ingredients: leftover grilled chicken, chorizo, roasted green/red peppers, fresh corn, green onions, cilantro and chipotles. My boyfriend looked skeptical, but he finished the meal with... another helping.

This is a new classic for me. I have adapted this recipe in so many ways....I have prepared it for over 100 ppl....I have substituted curry for the saffron...I have created a quick version of this recipe using cream of chicken soup, frozen vegetables, leftover chicken and ham and Bisquik with jalapeno cheese. And no matter how I prepare it people always love it. And the title always intrigues people...sometimes I just call it gourmet pot pie! One thing for sure, this ain't your mama's cobbler and frozen pot pie was never this good!!!

Very yummy, keeps well in the fridge for a few days. For vegetarians, try frozen tofu instead of chicken, added just before baking. Use very flavorful stock such as artichoke.
