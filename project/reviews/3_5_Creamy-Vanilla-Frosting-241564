Great recipe. BUT: Don't whisk flour into the milk: WHISK MILK INTO THE FLOUR. If you whisk milk into the flower (start with just a little to form a paste and slowly add more) then you will not get any lumps!!! Also: if you replace some of the milk with buttermilk you will get a tangy frosting that has some zip and isn't at all cloying. DELISH. (I suggest 1/2 cup to 3/4 of a cup of buttermilk) I have made this many many times and it is excellent (and adaptable)

I made this once before and had great results. This time, I'm getting little sort of... balls of milk/flour in my finished frosting. I'm upset because I really wanted to impress my guests tomorrow! It still tastes good, but does anyone know what I did wrong? Followed the recipe exactly.

This is my favorite frosting recipe of all time!! Once you make the basic recipe (follow it exactly), you can do anything to it. I have: added 6 oz melted and cooled bittersweet chocolate to the basic recipe to make a fabulous chocolate frosting; I have also added various citrus extracts and zest to the basic recipe with great results. One time I even added strawberry jam and a couple drops of pink food color to the basic recipe to make an outstanding strawberry cake. One more thing....I have made it a day in advance too with much success. It is necessary to re-whip it before using.

Wasn't impressed with this at all. I didn't have any problem with the process or consistency, I was just not impressed with the taste. It kinda just tasted like...milk and butter and flour. I even added a little more vanilla, but it didn't really help. Will not make this again.

Exceptionally good results with a couple of "down sides." Because I was so very careful to follow any and ALL directives, my blood pressure probably rose about twenty points. I survived the experience, and the icing is beyond superb. It's like the icing on my mother's 100th birthday cake from Continental Kosher Bakery in North Hollywood, Ca. Just really delicious. Like another reviewer's experience, my waxed paper literally cemented to the flour/milk mixture. Feeling pretty panicky, I gently pulled, tugged, scraped, and apparently saved enough of the mixture to make a great icing. Are there bits and pieces of waxed paper in the icing? Perhaps, but, to date, I haven't heard that waxed paper is toxic! Recipe MUST be followed exactly. "Stirring constantly" means just that!!

AMAZING!!!! I was looking for a frosting that wasn't sweetened with powdered sugar as those frostings are way to sweet. This was light, fluffy and a huge hit. Everyone keeps asking me for the recipe because they love how it's not too sweet, but just perfect. This is my new go to frosting for sure!

Rating: 4
This icing was light and fluffy, with a pleasant mouthfeel (not greasy, not gritty) and an incredible flavor. It seems as though the recipe might be adaptable for lemon icing as well, substituting lemon essence and zest for most of the vanilla. I did substitute evaporated milk for fresh since that was all I had. I was very pleased with the outcome, as I am NOT an experienced frosting maker and I got effusive compliments from much more experienced bakers. This goes in my "classics" recipe folder.

This first time I made this I had too much left over and the second time, I halved this recipe and it had just enough to frost 24 cupcakes. Light and fluffy frosting that's not too sweet. Make sure the milk mixture cools to room temperature and refrigerate the frosting for exactly 15 min. Fool-proof!

My first attempt at cooked frosting was successful and received rave reviews. Comments were that it was fluffy and not too sweet or rich. I followed recipe exactly, with the only exception being I used salted butter instead of unsalted, which I did not have on hand. My thoughts about a previous review thinking the frosting looked oily is that it is possible that the cooked mixture may have been added to the butter mixture before it was completely cooled. I used this frosting on a box cake mix and it was delicious!

I have always had problems coming up with a good frosting recipe. This is the first 4-star recipe that I can honestly also give 4 stars to! I followed the recipe exactly. I used baking sugar that has smaller crystals than your usual granulated sugar, and mine did not come out grainy at the end. For an extra-special touch, the second time I scraped a vanilla bean into the cooking milk mixture... love the little black specks in the finished product!

Has anyone ever tried to double this? I have to ice 80 cupcakes and this was the only recipe online that I could find believe it or not, that isn't just butter and six cups of power suger... way too sweet and don't like the consistancy.

I'm not going to rate this recipe because I didn't follow the instructions exactly. If you're thinking of decreasing the butter in the recipe and leaving the milk/flour combination and sugar the same in order to decrease the oiliness, don't try it! At least, it didn't work for me. My frosting curdled and (not surprisingly) was too soft to stay on a cake. Clearly my own fault, but thought I'd post this in case anyone was wondering what would happen if they did that.

this frosting is amazing!! so light and perfect. I have used another recipe for the same type of frosting and was always disappointed. Making sure to use fairly cold butter, creaming it well, adding the sugar a slowly a tablespoon at a time and beating it for a full 5 minutes after adding the flour and milk paste seem to make the difference in the end product

Another hint. The butter should not be too soft; the flour/milk should be very chilled. And you need to beat the frosting for a good 5 to 6 minutes.

I want to also say that the butter should not be too soft and the cooked flour/milk mixture must be absolutely cold. Also, you need to beat this frosting for a good five minutes.

I don't care for buttercream and thought since people said this was lighter, I'd like it. But it still has that greasy, too-smooth thing that I dislike about buttercream. It does whip up very light and turns remarkably white. I accidentally added the butter and sugar together rather than creaming the butter alone first for 3 minutes, which doesn't seem to have made a difference. I guess it's not traditional but I am going to make cream cheese icing to use on the red velvet cupcakes. The combination is just too blah with this frosting. Instead I'll use this one on chocolate cupcakes which have more flavor to stand up to a boring, buttercreamy frosting.

Rating: 4
I cut this recipe & made 1/4 (about enough for a 9x9 square/top only) - since the recipe didn't designate 10x sugar, and I was only making a small amount as a trial run - I used granulated sugar: IT TURNED OUT GREAT!!! Baking is a science and every recipe has it's equations - I understand the 'why's of the ingredients and the assembly sequence now that I've made it: HINTS: do NOT use any sugar other than PURE CANE granulated sugar - the other stuff on sale at your local grocery store is beet sugar and it does NOT work in baking the same as granulated sugar. Butter and margarine are NOT interchangable, so there's another mistake some of the other reviewers may have encountered. Last but not least, the temperature of the cooked flour/milk HAS to be room temp or slightly cooler, or else it will ruin the butter's bond with the sugar. CREAMY is an understatment, and sweet but not overpowering - lets the cake & frosting compliment each other.

I have been looking for an icing that tastes good and is reasonably easily used for piping etc. I don't particularly like most icing, because I find it too sweet. The icing is delicious, creamy and unlike a plain butter cream is usable for piping, and doesn't melt in the pastry bag while using it. I followed the recipe to a T but plan on trying to reuse the extra icing in a couple of days. It took much longer than 30 minutes for my milk/flour mixture to cool down, but I was patient and it was worth it.

Rating: 4
I'm not a fan of flour thickening, but this did alright. Next time I think I will try cornflour. I only made 1/2 the recipe as I knew there would be too much if I did the full recipe for the cinnamon rolls I made. I followed the instructions and everything turned out really well. It said to put wax paper on the top of the milk mixture, but I used pan lid then tipped off the excess water. It didn't change the recipe. Make sure you let it cool before using it with the other ingredients. My husband hates butter cream frosting. He also hate the smell of cooked milk. My mother-in-law gets weird about things that are creamy or "too creamy." My father-in-law has an extreme sweet tooth. I don't like really sweet foods. So it is hard to find something we all like. After I made up the icing, I tried a bit on the side of the bowl and thought it was fantastic. I gave the beaters to the kids (hubby and dad). lol They loved it. It looked so good, even my mother-in-law had some even though she said she didn't want any. It was a big hit and I have enough to even ice a cake or cupcakes. I will definitely make this again and I might even try with cornflour.

Yummy and light! I'm not a huge fan of buttercream, but this was delicious. All the mixing makes it light and fluffy. I did have to refrigerate more than 15 minutes, and put the partially-frosted cake in the fridge a few times during frosting; but it was 80 degrees out, so I blame the weather and not the recipe.

I must admit I was a bit intimidated by this recipe, but I'm very happy that I went through with it! The most important thing to remember is to make sure you ABSOLUTELY FOLLOW THE RECIPE STEP BY STEP! I'm not an avid baker, and this is my first time doing frosting and it turned out fabulous! A definite keeper! It's a much smoother, creamier and light tasting frosting. As most people said they had grit in their frosting, mine was really really smooth, no curdling - I actually whipped out my timer and did each step with caution. Do not half the recipe or adjust it in anyway until you make this recipe as it is the first time. You will love it!

It's a great recipe. delicious, few ingredients. i watched the video. I then made 2 batches. One where I followed the timing suggested, and one during which I was a bit pressed for time, so I mixed the heated liquid to the butter mixture a little too soon - it made a difference. the mixture curdled the second time around.

This is a fantastic recipe. I read the other reviews about curdling, and you really should watch the video where Bobby from Magnolia Bakery gives tips like use the flour paste before its cold but not when its hot. http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/video/Red-Velvet-Cupcakes-with-Creamy-Vanilla-Icing-241544?titleId=1915433407

I was extremely skeptical about this recipe. I have never made a "glue-like" concoction for frosting before BUT this is by far the most superior frosting recipe I have ever tasted. It's much like buttercream frosting, but not as heavy. Follow the recipe to a 'T'. May take slightly longer to cool to room temp, but that is the only alteration I made. Fantastic. You'll be missing out if you shy away from this one.

This is quite possibly the best frosting recipe ever. However, I have found that when I refridgerate it, the frosting becomes a tad bit hard to spread. I have used this recipe dozens of times! For a coconut cake, I add a little cream of coconut. For a pumpkin cake, I add pumpkin pie spice. I have always had amazing results.

The texture of this frosting came out perfectly following the directions as written. I made some minor changes in the recipe because one of my kids is very lactose intolerant. I used lactose-free milk and cultured butter. I also added a pinch of salt and a little extra vanilla. My kids, who usually prefer canned frosting to homemade, loved this. (I realize this may not sound like much of a recommendation to many but I loved it, too, and I hate canned frosting.)

I loved this recipe! This is more like a buttercream, firm when chilled and very light and fluffy when at room temp. I had some doubt when I saw that a flour mixture was in the recipe, but after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try. I followed the recipe exactly except for one thing which I will mention. As I DO like some sugar grit in my frosting, I may whip this a slight bit less the next time I make it, but this time, it came out with just a slight amount of grit. The recipe says to let the flour mixture cool for about 30 minutes; I let it go about an hour and the wax paper that you put on top of the mixture while it is cooling was glued to the sides of the pan and I had a terrible time getting it off without getting pieces of wax paper in the frosting. If I had waited the suggested 30 minutes, it probably would not have been a problem. Another reason for following directions! So, follow the directions and if you like buttercream, you will be thrilled with the results. If you don't like sugar grit of any kind, just beat it until there is none left. Problem solved!

I am an experienced cook and I bake a lot, but I don't have much experience with frosting. After reading all the comments, I decided to try this one and it's fabulous! Make it exactly as the instructions say. The flour/milk mixture is indeed glue and it's tricky to get off your fingers and out of the pan as one reviewer stated -don't let that deter you. I used the times exactly as stated in the recipe and it is the creamiest frosting - no grittiness as some others described. Years ago I had a cake in France and I've dreamed about the frosting on that cake ever since - I think I've now found that frosting!

Rating: 4
Delicious frosting! Smooth and wonderfully creamy, with a just bit of grit from the granulated sugar. It was the perfect pairing with the red velvet cupcakes (recipe also compliments of Magnolia). Lessons learned: A few things went awry the first time I made this frosting. I believe all my troubles spurred from the fact that I added too much flour to the milk mixture. I was simply lazy with my measurements, and the taste was certainly sacrificed.. The flour taste was a little too prominent. I also failed to adequately dissolve all of the flour, despite furious mixing (maybe also due to the fact that I added too much?) and this resulted in little jelly-like blobs throughout the icing. Definitely an undesirable quality. Lastly, I was working on a gas-fired stove top, and the milk/flour mixture thickened and reached "bubbling" within about 2 minutes, even on medium heat. I continued to cook it till the 10 minute mark, and the resulting cooled goo was much thicker than I believe it should have been (especially after watching the Magnolia frosting video). Next time, I'll add the right amount of flour, sift it in in small batches, and cook it for just about 5 minutes to ensure that the flour no longer raw. Well, hopefully this prevents someone else from make the same mistakes! You're going to love this frosting. I'll definitely be making it again!

I just finished making this frosting and it turned out perfectly! Now the first time I made it, it turned out delicious and beautiful but gritty. I do not approve of gritty. This time I creamed the butter and sugar for a very long, long time (half an hour? more? I just let the beater run until I was convinced it wasn't getting less gritty anymore). It was still slightly gritty, but that grittiness resolved after the addition of the flour/milk and a few minutes of beating. So now I can recommend this recipe, with a slight tweak to the length of the creaming step.

Please don't give recipes a poor rating if you decided to make changes to it and then don't like the results. I lower rating that is not the fault of the recipe could prevent someone from choosing to make an otherwise great dish. As for this frosting, especially for use on cupcakes, I prefer the frosting to be a little on the gritty side. Isn't this exactly the kind of frosting we loved as children? Why wouldn't we all still love it as adults? It is fantastic when a food transports me back to my childhood. And a really good frosting (so very hard to find) will do just that.

Not wanting to waste an entire pound of butter on a recipe I wasn't all that confident about, I halved it and was glad I did. This was some of the strangest frosting I've ever made. It wasn't at all sweet, and it had the consistency of Crisco/kindergarten paste, and it was about as hard to get off my fingers and off the bowl.

Fantastic and easy recipe. I made this frosting for my 9-year-old daughter's birthday party. Cut the recipe in half and, after cooling it for 15 minutes, I divided it into four portions and added food coloring to make green, yellow, blue and red frosting so the kids could frost their own cupcakes and then top them with different types of sprinkles. They loved it. The business about "exactly 15 minutes" happily isn't true - I refrigerated the frosting afterward and we used it a second time and there was no deterioration of quality. Highly recommended (preferably without the colors though). Great consistency, no graininess and not overly sweet.

I live in China, where ready-made frosting is difficult to buy and overpriced, and hand-held mixers don't have the same gusto as ones back in the states do. I made this frosting using only a fork and spatula and it was very tasty. The texture was very nice, although as many others have stated, a little gritty. I may try making it again with powdered sugar and see if makes a difference. It is definitely true that you need to cook the flour & milk until it is almost like a gelatinous solid.

Amazing frosting...it's not like any of the other ones out there. I don't like overly sweet frosting, so I cut back 1/2 C which I thought was perfect. I made it with the Red Velvet cupcakes, I didn't think the cupcakes were great, but the frosting is definitely a keeper.

I was hesitant to make this recipe after reading some of the reviews, but I'm so glad I did. It's absolutely sinful. I was looking for a nice rich icing for cupcakes and this definitely fits the bill. I was originally looking for a real buttercream recipe but it was a bit more complicated than this one. My husband and I love it. I had lots of leftover icing so I guess I'll just have to make something else to frost. I followed the instructions exactly and it came out great.

I was very skeptical of this recipe, right up until I ate one of the cupcakes, and then I realized how great it was. It's not overly sweet, but it pairs so well with the cupcakes. I hesitate to ever make anything that says "use immediately". I did frost my cupcakes right away, but I had a bunch of frosting left over, so I'm going to bring it out tonight to see what happens to the frosting when it comes to room temp. The cupcakes I made yesterday went into the fridge last night and have sat out at room temperature today, and the frosting is still delicious.

I am not sure why it has taken me 35 years to find a recipe like this. None of the baking books I have anything remotely like it. A very good icing and a relief not to have to make the syrup and egg white style white icing which i don't really care for anyway. To all those who say; too greasy (not as much as a regular buttercream) too wet and runny (you have not done it right). At first glance I saw the flour and milk and thought, that sounds on the edge of gross, maybe something that might of come out of the "White Trash Cookbook" (I used to have a copy). And yes, you can leave it out overnight, if made right, it will not run, weep, sag, etc. I first used it on a devils food style cake from a Maida Heatter book, have yet to try the Red Velvet cake in this recipe group but will do so soon. You can tell this is an old style recipe even without the other reviews. Good consistency, good color and relatively easy to make. Someone should do a book of just icings and frostings and of course include this one!

This is fantastic -- a total revelation to me as I have never heard of making frosting from a flour base. I only gave three stars because my butter broke down a little bit. I think I'm the only one who noticed, but I'd be happier if it held together a little tighter. Does anyone know if this is a result of overbeating after the flour mixture is added? I followed the recipe's 5 min instructions.

This recipe is the exact flour icing recipe my family has used since the early 50's. My grandmother always made everyone a Red velvet cake on their birthday with this icing. I have her recipe cards now and the only difference was that this recipe shown in doubled. I remember her making it on her old gas stove and how long it took to make the flour and fresh buttermilk turn into a school paste like consistancy. Then she would sit it off to the side and use real homemade butter not the store bought stuff to cream with the granulated sugar. This icing takes a lot of time and effort but when done correctly it is heavenly. YES, it needs to be in the refrigerator. Only use the vinegar with whole milk if no buttermilk is used. No, do not allow cake once iced to stand out over night-refrigerate it covered or cake becomes hard! A lot of people now days have not eaten anything but store bought canned icing do not know how things really do taste made fresh anymore. I would love to have grandma back with me and showing me how to can and bake all over again.

This is very similar to my family recipe for red velvet "Waldorf Astoria" cake. If you do not like really sweet sweets, then maybe this frosting may not be for you. However, I do not know of anyone who has not loved this cake and the frosting. You should refridgerate it, due to all of the butter in the frosting, it just keeps better.

While not my favorite type of frosting, it got good reviews from the eaters. However, I found that the milk/flour blob, if not mixed just right, left lots of little bitty blobs in the finished frosting. I think next time I would use a hand mixer (as opposed to a KitchenAide) to ensure it was blended thoroughly.

I am interested in the cake but am most intrigued by the icing. My mother was known for her pies and cakes, using a similar icing receipe often from when I was child in the 50's and long before. We lost the receipe with her so I am interested in trying, and of course, "tweeking" this icing.

I grew up with the 'Red Velvet' cake and this recipe I knew as 'Flour Frosting'. This was always a favorite of our families. My grandma always sprinkled coconut on hers. I have not compared measurements of this recipe vs. mine. YET. I will and will post again to compare, if need be. (It does seem to be too much butter, though). The trick to this frosting is to cook the flour and milk until it is an extremely thick paste. I put it in the freezer to cool it fast and get it really cold. When scooping it out it will be a solid glob. Yes, it can be a little 'grainy' with the sugar. You should refrigerate the cakes with this frosting. But I can't imagine any other frosting on anything 'Red Velvet'. I have even used this frosting with Whoopie Pies. I have never had a bad review. People are always loving this cake, especially the frosting!

Yuk. I can't believe a commercial establishment is putting this recipe out as a reflection of the business. I made a half batch of the recipe exactly as written. The result was a stiff, exceptionally rich, bland, off-white frosting. I didn't think it was a good match for a moist, mildly flavored red velvet cake. The color contrast was poor, and the dense texture was too heavy for the soft texture of the cake. I recommend a bright white meringue-syrup based frosting instead.

Haven't tried it yet however I too want to know if it needs refrigeration. Need to make it for a large number of cupcakes so if it must be refrigerated I will seek another recipe. I noticed the instructions ended with Use Immediately which leads me to believe it may not hold over for day?

This frosting is beautiful and fluffy, but mine is a bit gritty. I'm sure this is my fault, but I'm not sure what I did wrong. Luckily, it is almost unnoticeable when the frosting is actually on the cake. I'd be wiling to make it again to try to rectify my mistake.

This icing is horrible. It did not run as I followed all the reviews. But - using all of that butter - yuk.

The red velvet cupcakes were perfect thank goodness.

Excellent. I used no milk and substituted one cup coffee and one cup of a firm ganache I had on hand, about half the sugar and twice the vanilla. This frosting was light, fluffy, delicious and had a beautiful texture. I suggest, as have others, that if your icing was runny, you may have no let your flour mixture cook long enough, or possibly cool enough. I will certainly make this again.

This worked great for me! I actually cut the recipe down to a 1/4 the size, colored it blue, & just used it to decorate a chocolate frosted cake. No problems & it tasted great!

My friends and I have been having this Red Velvet addiction after eating them from a local gourmet bakery, Sprinkles. Except we pay $3.00 for each cupcake, personally I thought it was overpriced. So when i saw this recipe I had high hopes espcially because it's from a well known bakery in NYC. Even with all the bad reviews I still wanted to make it. I followed the recipe as described, the cake was okay, I personally think it needs a bit more cocoa. And the frosting was not what I expected. I knew it called for 4 sticks of butter, my gosh every bite made me feel like I was about to have a heart attack!! Way too much butter, I was hoping it was a lighter tasting frosting, but I guess not. I think I'll stick to the Sprinkles Red Velvet cupcake for now and pass on this recipe. If you're in Orange County, California gotta try Sprinkles, Red Velvet.

This was a good frosting, but it did feel a little greasy to me (the butter as the obvious cause). I made it exactly as described and it was really, really simple. I'm not a frosting maker simply because I don't usually make cakes for dessert, so I don't know if this is typical, but I was truly stunned by how white the frosting got with beating. I spread i on a coconut cake also from this site and found the two to be delectable together. Since the recipe makes such a great lot, I ended up putting about a layer's worth in the freezer to use the next time I make something that would benefit from frosting. I'm hoping I'll be able to defrost it, beat it for a few minutes and then spread it. I'll report back when I do that!

Not impressed with this frosting: bland flavor, too much effort, hard to work with, and you ned to use it right away because of all the butter. The Red Velvet cupcakes turned out great, though, just use a different, sweeter, and easier to make frosting.

I also had a problem with the consistency. The icing dripped off the sides of the cake. I tried putting it back in the fridge, which didn't help much. The icing is delicious, however, so I would love to find a way to solve this problem. Any suggestions?

A total disaster. I followed the recipe to a tee, and the frosting came out as a watery mess. I had to dump it and start over with a new recipe.

Amazing Amazing. Totally worth the effort! People here in Oz dont really make fluffy icing like this, this is awsome! My friend and I topped cupcakes for her daughters first birthday with it, they were a massive hit. We found if you want to add food colouring its best to do it before you put it in the fridge. You do need to make this icing the day of serving because if its warm it melts and if you put it back in the fridge too long it turns waxy and hard. We even made a gluten free version substituting the flour with White Wings Gluten Free Plain Flour.

This frosting is the most delicious vanilla frosting ever! It is super creamy, but not too heavy. I have the book, which I totally recommend-everything I have made from it I have TOTALLY loved, and I am obsessed with baking!

WOW!! What a butter cream. I added a little extra vanilla for flavor and got rave reviews. Several people felt it tasted like vanilla ice cream. However TOO much can leave you with a heavy belly. I highly recommend putting them on cupcakes to avoid an over dose!!

Delicious and unlike any frosting I have ever made. I loved the not too sweet flavor and the texture is heaven. I thought I let the milk mixture get too thick but there seems to be some room for error. Perfect with red velvet cupcakes but I will be trying it with other cakes too...

I had originally planned to use a different frosting on the Magnolia Red Velvet Cupcakes but discovered I was out of icing sugar. So, I went ahead with this one. And, Wow! I'm glad I did. I've never made a frosting like this before and I think it is so fab. I really enjoy the gentle sweetness of it - not cloying in the least!

Added 1/4 teaspoon of salt to the flour/milk mixture. Good recipe, excellent details in the instructions. Not too sweet. It is a heavy frosting; however, and it crushed the air out of the red velvet cake. (I seem to be the only one who noticed.) The cake and frosting received rave reviews from ~30 at a baby shower.

This frosting was a huge crowd pleaser!

Just a heads up for those of you who have never made a recipe like this -- it is VERY creamy, sticky even when set, and not very sweet. You can tell from the ingredients that it is somewhat like a buttery pudding. It was the traditional frosting used for red velvet cakes many years ago and also known as gravy icing in some older cookbooks. I personally do not like it since I like my frostings on the sweet side, but others love it -- esp if they grew up with it. Matter of taste.
