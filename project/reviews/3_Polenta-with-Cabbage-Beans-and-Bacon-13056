Rustic, hearty, delicious, easy. Will probably make again with larger chunks of bacon rather than chopped up slices. Also added mushrooms just after the bacon and that was good too. We had made beans the night before and had good quality bacon, so it was extra special.

Um, so I admit the ingredients didn't jump out at me as the best combination ever, but I had all the ingredients in house and little else. So I think, let's give it a try. Bland and uninteresting. The only reason you should consider making this; you need to up the fiber intake. Even covering it with cheese didn't save it.

fear factor side dish. Great before the cornmeal and water were added!

It was great....until I added the water and cornmeal! I used canned beans and meant to add them near the end but forgot and added them in the beginning; they got broken up too much and just made the polenta runnier the longer I stirred. It was not a pretty thing to look at either - I got my kids to eat it by calling it my Fear Factor side dish.

My first stab at polenta and it was a success! So easy to make -- I made it even easier by using canned pinto beans, and it came out fine. Also, turkey bacon worked well. Make this when you're feeling strong -- the stirring can wear you out! Very good as leftovers, too.
