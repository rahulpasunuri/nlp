What a nice combination of flavours! I baked my own 12 full-sized bagels and served them open-faced with this topping. The fresh basil is so nice. Try this -- it is perfect for a buffet.

The fresh mini bagels I purchased were as wide as a whole slice of salami and I decided it was too much bread for such a relatively light topping. So I served the goat cheese, salami quarters and tomato on water crackers instead and they turned out very good.

Recipe was the hit of a summer pool party. Very easy and attractive. Will definitely use again!

I made this for lunch except used small pieces of sourdough bread to cut carbs. I used Chavrie for the goat cheese. It made a quick easy lunch and is a nice use of fresh basil if one happens to grow it.
