after reading other reviews and knowing how i love intense lemon flavor i decided to add a the peel from a whole lemon and it was perfect. i chopped it up fine and added it in. also made the topping with just fresh blackberries, a little lemon juice and sugar which i boiled down till it thickened a bit. yum!

Made this today and what an easy and tasty dessert. Another reason to always have buttermilk on hand. My husband is lactose intolerant and the use of buttermilk makes this creamy and OK for him. He is very happy and looking forward to having more...

Love this pie! I doubled the lemon amount like other reviewers and replaced the jelly with boiling 1/4 c blueberries, 2T water and 2T sugar instead. I also added the sugar to the thawing blueberries though. No worries on the pie being too browned on top - the blueberry topping covers it right up!

My guests at Easter loved this pie; but, I only liked it a little. It was pretty dense...more like a lemon bar in a pie pan; however, I may have messed it up by mixing the buttermilk and lemon in the same measuring cup. The batter then curdled. I baked it anyway and ended up needing to tent it to stop the browning. I took the advise of other reviewers and upped the lemon and added 1 Tbsp extra flour.

This review is for the pie filling. I used about 1/3 cup lemon juice, and an extra Tbsp. flour. It set beautifully, and even a lemon dessert hater liked this pie! I made a butter shortbread pie crust hat went very well with the lemon. Also made a raspberry compote out of fresh raspberries, sugar, and flat champagne. It set off this pie quite well.

I made this with Meyer lemons and the 1/2 cup lemon juice. It was really easy to make and also delicious. I served it without the topping and my husband loved it.

this was delicious. i too doubled the amount of lemon juice and actually mixed in a bit of lime juice to that too just to add some depth. instead of using jam i just added some blueberries, sugar and a touch of water into a saucepan and heated them up until they turned dark blue and the water started to evaporate and thicken. after it cools the liquid will become sort of jammy. this was a big hit!

A family favorite, and very easy and quick. I don't make the blueberry topping - instead, I whip some kind of berry and whipping cream together for a fruity mousse-like concoction and put that on top of the pie slices.

Unimpressive. I used a half cup instead of a quarter cup of lemon juice, and the flavor was still very faint. Tried blueberries and even raspberry preserves on top, but it was still only passable. Won't make again.

Great pie! Everyone loved it. I smashed 1/2 pound of fresh berries with some sugar to make the topping. The pie was a bit sweet, it probably doesn't need 1 1/4 cups sugar. I used 1/3 cup of lemon juice. I will definetely make again!

This was a super easy dish to put together, and it tasted great. I did not have any problems with the pie setting up; in fact, I thought I had over-baked it because the pie top was more of a dark brown than a golden brown. (I ended up only cooking it for 40 minutes.) But when I served it to my husband and in-laws, everyone (myself included) enjoyed it. For people who like a creamy texture and mild lemon flavor, this is the pie for you!

Great pie. Followed the advice of some of the previous reviewers and increased the lemon juice to 1/2 cup. I used fresh lemons and it made it really lemony. Very good if you like tart desserts, otherwise I'd leave it at 1/4c. or try a 1/3c. I also boiled 1/4 c. blueberries and 2T sugar and 2T water to make my jam & didn't add any extra sugar with the blueberries. Topping came out nicely.

I made this dish for a group that normaaly prefers chocolate. Everyone loved it including the girl that doesn't like lemon pie. The only thing I would do differently is cut down on the sugar in teh blueberry topping.

The middle does take a while to set, it seems, but once it starts it happens fast enough. I might have cooked the pie 10 minutes longer than the recipe called for- but my old oven can be finicky so I can't blame the pie. Nice flavor combination, but the pie alone is fine without the blueberries, I might use fresh with whipped cream next time, or fresh instead of frozen to see what that is like. Lemon flavor was perfect, not overwhelmingly sharp, but not lost. Pie was a hit with my coworkers, and was a nice alternative to chocolate concoctions or cheesecake. I'd make it again.

Delicious and easy! No problem with the middle not setting, and the brown top didn't bother my family. I made the topping with fresh blueberries and it was VERY sweet. I would definitely skip the added sugar, and maybe even the jam, next time, depending on the quality of the berries.

Delicious lemon flavor and wonderful texture to this pie. I made a homemade graham cracker crust (one sleeve graham crackers, crushed; 1/2 stick melted butter; 1/4 cup sugar) and rather than the blueberry and jam topping, I made a simple blueberry topping as follows: Cook 1/2 cup blueberries, 2 T sugar and 2 T water in saucepan for 3-4 minutes. Smash berries. Stir in the rest of a pint of blueberries. Chill until serving. This pie was a huge hit at a summer BBQ.

Made this last weekend. Made a graham cracker crust in a deep dish pie plate. Used combo of frozen and fresh berries. Husband (pie lover) and daughter (cake over) said it was a "perfect" pie. Excellent tart lemon flavor to compliment the topping. Sometimes the simplest of recipes do have the best results.

This pie was wonderful!!! It didn't take long to make, and I had no trouble with the center not being set. I did put in about 1/2 tablespoon more flour than it called for. The top did get quite brown, but that just made for better flavor. The topping was a breeze and I did have some left over for pancakes, as someone else had mentioned. I made it for a family gathering and not only was there not one crumb left, I couldn't even find the empty pie plate!

I made the filling and put it in creme brulee dishes, skipping the crust altogether. It was a little thick, but tasted great with fresh blueberries and strawberries. Very nice lemony flavor, but next time I will use less flour.

This was a beautiful addition to a spring brunch a few months ago. I used individual pie shells made of shortbread that I found at Central Market. The lemon flavor was a nice contrast to the typical chocolaty things most of the other folks took along, and the blueberries stood out beautifully! I used fresh blueberries instead of frozen and let them macerate in the blueberry jam before topping the pies. Delish!

Very good. This one is a keeper! My only change was a homemade grahamcracker crust instead of the pre-made.

I made this last night and it is DELICIOUS, even though it went into the oven very runny and took forever to set in the center. I'll bet I baked that sucker for 1-1/2 hrs., minimum. Part of the problem may have been that I used reconstituted buttermilk--next time I would use the appropriate amount of powder and less water, and increase the oven temp. to 400 degrees. Also, I made 25% more filling to use a Keebler 9 oz. (2 extra servings) crust. For my larger recipe, I followed reviewer's suggestions and increased the lemon juice to a scant 1/2 cup, the lemon zest to 3 tsp. (packed), and the flour to 5 Tbs. The taste is excellent, and I will definitely make this again, with some changes.

Everyone loved this dish!!!. I read the reviews and added more juice and zest, topped it with a dollop of whipped cream and they all went wild. I also put it in a purchased shortbread crust, but will try the graham cracker crust next time. I will make this again and again.

This is a fantastic summer dessert! I used a shortbread crust and fresh blueberries instead of frozen. I decorated each piece with a lemon peel curl. Everyone loved it. Also I made everything the day before which really made it easy! Will definately make this again!

Wonderful summer dessert! I'm not a big lemon dessert person and I loved it. I also used a shortbread crust instead of grahm cracker crust. A big hit with my family and guests!

I agree with the Napa Valley Cook. I was expecting something more lemony. With all the messing around I thought it wasn't worth the effort. I have a lemon recipe which is made from condensed milk and lemons, which is far superior to this one and you only use one bowl.

I really enjoyed this pie, especially because it was so simple! I used a homemade regular pie crust (not graham cracker), which I baked for a few minutes before adding the filling. I also found that it only took about 30 minutes to be both brown on top and DONE (ie, set in the center)! Now what to do with the leftover blueberry sauce...

Perfect Summer dessert. I got raving reviews. I too had to ccok longer to get the center set. If you like lemon desserts, you'll love this.

After reading the other reviews I'm beginning to think I may have done something wrong! Lemon-loving family was disappointed -- had to toss due to lack of interest! Used the berries for pancakes, tho!

I am a lover of anything that has lemon in it and this was delicious! The blueberry sacue was more than ample, had plenty left over for pancke and waffles. It was a big hit with my family and friends. I too had to cook it a bit longer to cook the center.

Brought this to a Mothers' Day brunch - got excellent reviews. Had no problem with the original baking directions of 45 minutes. One probable mistake of mine: I made my own crust but probably needed to bake it beforehand. Instead I put filling into unbaked crust and the filling probably wasn't as creamy as it should have been.

This was a very tasty pie! I added about 2 additional teaspoons of flour to the mixture because it seemed a bit runny. I baked it for about 50 minutes and covered the crust with tinfoil halfway through because it tended to get brown fast...as for the topping, I would add a little less sugar next time. The pie would be fine without the topping and fresh fruit instead. A big hit and any lemon fan would love this pie!

This was extremely easy to make and was quite delicious. I watched the time at about 30 minutes as per suggestions from other reviews...I ended up cooking it only 2 min. longer than the 45 sugggested and it came out golden and great.

What a wonderful combination of tart lemon and sweet blueberry! The graham cracker crust however browned way too quickly. Next time I will use a round piece of aluminum foil with the center cut out (to protect the edges)during the first half of the cooking time. If the center looks too brown half way through then I will cover the center as well for the remainder of the cooking time. After reading the reviews about how the center didn't cook I added another teaspoon of flour to the recipe and it turned out just fine!

This was definitely delicious, but when I took the pie out of the oven it was not set in the middle but yet very browned. After it was chilled it was more firm, but still a little runny in the middle. The taste was very refreshing however! Maybe the answer is to bake it a little longer on a lower setting?

A wonderful pie! I've made it twice now to rave reviews. The only thing I found is that I needed to bake it about an additional 30 mins so the middle would set. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This was a delicious and very easy-to-make dessert. The blueberry sauce is a nice addition. Watch the time. I found that the pie turned out very brown and next time I would start checking at 30 mins(but it was still wonderful).

I didn't make this recipe, but my girlfriend did for my birthday dinner. I had to look it up so that I can make it too! It was delicious. The sweet with the tart pie made a wonderful compliment at the end of a fine dinner! She is a "Bon Appetit" nut. She uses only Bon Appetit recipes to serve her guests! This is a keeper! She had to have shelves built just to house her Bon Appetit collection.
