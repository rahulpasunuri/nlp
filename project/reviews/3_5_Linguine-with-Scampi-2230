This was a very delicious meal. I think deveining and cleaning the shrimp ahead of time and keeping them refrigetated until cooking time would make this an easy meal for company too. http://www.mynewlywedcookingadventures.com/2013/02/bon-appetits-linguine-with-scampi.html

Easy, forgiving and delicious. This goes into the rotation. I made exactly per the recipe.

As has been stated before, simple, fresh ingredients make for delicious dishes. For ease, I made the sauce in a large sauté pan but also added 1/2 cup dry sherry and 1/4 cup capers. Used some halved cherry tomatoes, basil and parsley from my garden to give it a kick - maybe not classic scampi, but so easy and delicious for a week night dinner. (Oh, and poured the sauce over fettuccine I made this morning!)

This lacks oomph even after adding crushed red pepper, parsley, salt and white pepper. It could use much more garlic than called for.

I took the advice of other reviewers and used only 1/2 stick of butter and about 2 T of evoo (versus the recommended 1-1/2 sticks of butter, which would have been far too heavy for my liking). I skipped adding white wine but added juice from 2 whole large lemons which I thought was perfect. I also added 2 T of capers, 1/2 pint of cherry tomatoes, and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes, all of which I baked in the oven with the shrimp. I steamed broccoli on the side. For serving, I put the linguine, shrimp mixture, and broccoli in one large bowl, stirred together and served. We loved it. I will definitely make it again soon. Next time, I think I'll do half the shrimp and add scallops and maybe mussels too. Very quick, easy recipe.

This is really good and easy. I used half the butter and added olive oil for the rest. More garlic is good. Yummy.

Delicious, quick, and easy! I made it twice. The second time, I cut the butter to 1 stick, doubled the lemon juice, and added additional garlic. It took about as long as it takes to boil the pasta. I will make it again.

This was quite good although I too substituted olive oil for some of the butter and added roasted red sweet pepper.

This was awesome! I lessened the butter, added some olive oil, and threw in some roasted red and yellow peppers. When it was too liquidy, I added some bread crumbs.

Great recipe! I added 3T butter, 3T wine, 1T olive oil and added grape tomatoes a few seconds before taking it out of the oven. I ran out of parsley so I tried a mixture of oregano and dill and my family inhaled it!

Easy receipe with great flavor. I marinated the shrimp for about 30 minutes in a little lemon juice, garlic and olive oil - and it was really tender and tasty. Also, added sauteed fresh mushroom and shallots - which worked out well for an optional flavor/texture boost.

This is an excellent recipe. I have made it more than a couple dozen times over the years. My advice: Do not cut back on the amount of butter and be sure to use nice large garlic cloves. Both make this recipe a winner!

made this for christmas dinner again this year - raves as usual! Even tripled the batch. Used tiger prawns, ended up cooking 7-8 minutes turning twice. Served with "roasted asparagus with bacon and goat cheese" also from epicurous, another crowd pleaser.

i love this easy recipe, and the seafood guy at safeway is pretty hot and nice so i enjoy buying the shrimp, this meal cooks up really fast its almost hard to keep up with it unless you have the garlic and parsley prepped. i love it! im making it right now for like the 10th time! my boyfriend really loves it too

This was incredibly simple to make and delicious. I actually made it with scallops, as one of the people at dinner doesn't like shrimp, and it was delicious - I'd recommend trying it.

Rating: 4
Very impressive for such a simple recipe. Fast and easy (tip: use peeled and deveined shrimp to save time, and use fresh pasta which cooks in 2-3 minutes). Have never achieved such great flavor from a saute, doing prawns in the oven is definitely the way to go. Every bite was a perfect infusion of garlic and lemon. Whole family LOVED it, even the one year old!

Great simple recipe. Try it as an appetizer...skip the pasta and add some bread crumbs and romano cheese to the scampi to thicken the liquid, broil for a few minutes and serve with fresh crusty bread, it's awesome.

I gave this dish 4 forks because it was so delicious for so little work. I did half butter, half olive oil and used dried parsley (about 1.5 T). Next time I will add more lemon juice. Maybe also some capers.

Fantastic recipe. Less butter, but everything else about the same. I increased the shrimp & changed pasta to angel hair. Easy, quick, delicious.

Definitely cut back on the butter (five or six tablespoons is ample) and add an equal amount of olive oil. More lemon juice enhances this as well. I tried this as written at first, and modified it the aforementioned way; it was much better.

My family really enjoyed this recipe and it was really easy to make. I used only 1 stick of butter and added a couple of tablespoons of olive oil. I also served it garlic basil fettucini, which made it really delicious.

Rating: 1
Way too much butter. I added more garlic, which was nice and much more lemon. At first it tasted good, but by the 3rd scoop, it was boring. It just wasn't all that interesting. I would stick to classic scampi, frying up garlic, parsley, etc in pan add shrimp, and some wine, ... that would be better than this.

This was very easy- However, Our's got cold really fast.?. We did as the other reviewer's suggested and cut the butter and added olive oil. We also marinated the shrimp in white wine/lemon juice for 15 min. Served with a spinach salad.

Excellent recipie. The only changes I made were to add a little olive oil to the butter, and to use an extra 1/2 pound of shrimp. Otherwise, this dish was fantastic!

The simple preparation of this dish is great for a quick easy dinner! I only used about 2 T of butter and replaced the rest with white wine and vegetable stock. It tasted wonderful, with a lot less fat. I also added fresh tomato at the last second.

I thought this dish was dry...would certainly try the olive oil suggestions of the other reviewers next time. Overall not too bad.

This dish is fantastic! I didn't have any fresh garlic on hand so I marinated the shrimp in garlic powder, increased the amount of garlic (my fiance and I love spicy food), and I cut the butter to half.

It was easy but the result was awful. I followed readers suggestions and the result was a bland watered down scampi. After I transferred the contents to a saute pan and boiled off all the stuff that watered down the butter, it was just ok. Will definitely look for a better recipe.

This recipe was excellent. I would only change one aspect of the recipe. I would replace the butter with olive oil to make it a little healthier. I would definitely make this again because it ie easy and tastes great.

Rating: 4
I followed others' suggestions and only used 1/2 stick butter, and it was still absolutely delicious! Prior to cooking the shrimp, I pressed the garlic and added it to enough pinot grigio to cover the shrimp in a bowl and marinated for 30 minutes--when it was time to add the shrimp to the melted butter, the entire contents from the bowl was added. Other substitutions/changes: I used 1 lb linguini, 1-1/2 lbs shrimp, 6 sliced baby bella mushrooms, 8 cloves of garlic, 4 tbsp. lemon juice, 1 tsp. red pepper flakes. I added the mushrooms when the shrimp was added to the melted butter, and I added the red pepper flakes when the parsley was added to the shrimp mixture. I also topped each serving w/freshly grated parmesan cheese and a lemon wedge. This dish required no additional seasoning once served!

Rating: 3
Very good; I also took advice from other reviewers and used olive oil and more lemon juice. I also found that if you only use 1 stick of butter instead of a stick and a half, it tastes the same.

This recipe is SO fast and easy, and with the modifications suggested by the other reviewers (olive oil, more garlic, a little crushed red pepper), it was quite delicious. My boyfriend liked this dish than dishes I've slaved over for hours, the bum! Even though I'm not much of a shrimp scampi or pasta fan, I was very pleasantly surprised with the results.

This is a good scampi recipe. I took the suggestion of the other reviewers and added some olive oil, white wine, extra garlic, crushed red pepper, finished with Italian bread crumbs. I also reduced the butter to a half of a stick. Yum.

This was OK, very easy, but pretty dry. (Extra lemon juice and a bit of extra oil while tossing fixed the problem) ALso added shallots, white wine and finished with a small amount of shredded parm/romano.. boyfriend liked it and I had seconds..Ill try mushrooms next time

It wasn't bad but there are a lot better recipes out there that use shrimp with linguine. Adding more garlic and a vegetable such as asparagus would probably improve the flavor. I used half olive oil and half butter. My husbands comment was, "It's kind of dry".

Following the advice of the other reviewers, I did cut back a little on the butter and added some white wine. I also cooked the entire recipe on the stovetop rather than in the oven, as that seemed quite wasteful. Everything turned out excellent and was prepared in about ten minutes.

Very tasty yet very strong on the garlic (although we didn't mind). We also sprinkled it with hot red pepper flakes on our own plates, because, not everyone likes hot and spicy. In addition, we sprinkled some Parm. cheese on top. A definate keeper!

This was a quick easy recipe. The most tedious part of the whole thing is deveining the shrimp. I added more garlic, a little wine, and cut down on the butter like another reviewer. We thought it was great and had enough flavor. Of course, we put some freshly grated regiano parmesan on top too. It even tasted good the next day.

I made this dish for dinner last night and it was wonderful. After reading other reviews, I decided to use just 1 T.lemon juice and 3 T. dry white wine plus I added 1 T. chopped fresh basil and another clove of garlic then I tossed with pappardelle noodles and topped with freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Everyone loved it. This recipe is a keeper!

This was great and so easy! I used half the butter, and forgot to put in more olive oil but it was still delicious.

My husband and I thought this was an awesome dish, especially since it's quick and easy. I made it with only half a stick of butter, plus some olive oil, 3 Tbs. lemon juice, and another 3 Tbs. white wine, then served it over angel hair pasta. The flavors were perfectly balanced.

I've made this recipe nearly every week! My 14 year old daughter even commented that this tasted like we were at a fancy restaurant. I used ALL the suggestions: roasted chopped red pepper, bread crumbs, parmesan cheese, splash of chardonnay, butter and olive oil. The shrimp may take longer to cook and I usually use 1 1/2 lbs with 1 lb of pasta. Buon Appetito!

I was in a pinch on a weeknight and had some frozen shrimp in the freezer so whipped this up. Even with the frozen shrimp it was awesome. I added some olive oil and crushed red pepper and a chopped red bell pepper. Sprinkled the top with Italian breadcrumbs before baking. It was terrific.

This dish was very easy to prepare and tasted great! Can't beat that. I cut the amount of butter to about 1/3 of a cup and added bread crumbs. I used more shrimp and served it as a main course (probably used 1 1/2 pounds)and there still didn't seem to be enough.

I made this simple but elegant dish for my boyfriend and he flipped! I'm hardly a gourmet cook but he said it was the best scampi he's ever eaten. I agree with the other reviews - use one more tbsp. of lemon juice. I also served it over white rice rather than linguini.

Rating: 3
I added the roasted red pepper chunks (added nice color contrast as well as flavor), also I decreased the butter and increased the shrimp (2 lbs) and added more lemon to taste after the baking was complete. This dish was beautiful as well as delicious and got raves. Also, decreasing the oil made it a nice, light summer meal.

An easy but elegant presentation of a weekday meal! A touch more lemon juice than suggested will bring out the shrimps' full flavor. If you do have extras, reheat with fresh breadcrumbs and a dab of grated parmesan. Almost as good as my mom's scampi!

Adding bread crumbs and parm. cheese gives the scampi more body, serve it as an appitizer sans pasta with lots of bread for dipping.

I make this frequently now, with these modifications: use 75/25 olive oil to butter and reduce overall amount to 1/2 cup; roast a sweet red pepper; chop it into fairly large chunks, and add it when you add the shrimp, garlic & lemon. Also -- we enjoy it with angel hair pasta rather than linguine. The sweet red pepper adds a delicious taste, ups the nutrition, and cuts the richness.

This is a quick, great, and fast meal to impress friends with. I love linguine so i used more. I used medium sized shrimp about 1 1/2 lbs. I didn't change other ingredient's. this balanced the butter to my taste. I tried pre cooked shimp to compare with raw shrimp. I warmed shrimp through. I saved time and enjoyer the dish as well as with raw shrimp. Our friends like this as well as we do.

I've made this dish a couple of times and will definitely make it again. It's an easy to make, impressive dish to serve. I substituted olive oil for half of the butter and that made it a little lighter while still retaining the rich butter taste.

Rating: 2
Though I would not make it again, I must admit it was pretty good. The problem I had with it was that it was just too rich, due mostly to the large quantity of butter. I say this with reservation because I love butter as much as a muffin but this kept me on the couch for the rest of the night. Certainly, not a good first date meal...:) Like some of the other reviewers, I also added a bit more garlic but I'll bet most anyone who truly likes scampi would be inclined to do this...:)
