I lived in Miami for many years and made this the last time I visited family there. I followed the recipe except for doubling the rub. It turned out so well that a born and bred Miamian said it was the best pork she had ever had! If you know Miami at all, it is pork heaven with all of the different cuisines that use this versatile protein. So, double, follow rest and reap the rewards! (great for Cuban sandiches the next day)

I made this with a smaller piece of meat (under 4 pounds), but used the whole amount of marinade and put it all in the crock pot for 8 hours. Just removed the skin, pulled the meat off the bone and added any juices directly to the platter of meat. It was fantastic! Will make this again and again.

I did not have the exact same cut, mine was a shoulder blade part of the shoulder. I followed the recipe exactly, adding extra time in the oven as I had more meat than the recipe called for. I made very deep pockets under the skin, so in the end it pulled itself off and rolled up a bit, making it look very fancy and interesting. I used pork from Caw Caw Creek farm, which produces amazing meat, it is great any way you fix it, but it came out perfectly flavored. Very easy recipe, delicious!

Good and very tender but I did not think it was anything special. I could not even taste the garlic AT ALL, which was a big disappointment to this garlic lovin gal. The oregano was overwhelming - way too much! I will stick to my tried and true method and season the meat on all sides as well as under the fat. NOTE: Crock pot low for 6 hrs for about 4.5 lbs and was well done. This will not crisp skin though.

Tonight I made this for the second time. First time I followed recipe exactly. This time I used my Rival Roaster Oven (on our deck, to avoid the heat in the house all day). Covered in parchment and foil and set in a 9x13 metal pan. PERFECT results both times. This time I finished it in the oven at 425 to crisp the skin better, and put the removed skin back in at 475 *upside down* to cook the fat - superb!! (For clarification, the marinade you discard is really any pan drippings that may occur in the fridge.)

Easy, oh so tasty recipe! We make this regularly whenever my local market has this cut on special. Superb, inexpensive meal. I use a garlic press - easier to get the garlic to a pasty consistency. I also cut the salt in half, otherwise I found the pan juices far too salty to use with the meat, and that was a shame. Love crisping the skin separately as suggested - YUM!

This was terrific! I made it exactly the way the recipe called for except I did cut the fat layer into a flap per another reviewer. It did shrink a bit but made it much easier to apply the marinade and poke holes in the meat. I marinated it for 24 hours. There was a small amount of liquid in the pan afterword which I tossed out. I did not end up adding a lot of water only a half cup as there was so much fat that I used it for basting. I had decided early on that I wasn't going to make gravy. The meat was flavorful, tender and delicious. The fat was like candy, crisp, addicting. I will definitely be working with this cut of meat more regularly.

Absolutely loved this!! Easy and amazingly delicious. My husband and I can't wait to make this again.

The pork was good, but the way the recipe was written was so unclear, I had to improvise a lot. It said to discard the marinade, but I had no pools of marinate floating around, so I didn't discard anything. It said to add water as needed, but in all, I didn't need to add more than 3/4 cup to the pan. The whole how-to-deal-with the juices part was written so crazily, I didn't really know what they intended. In the end, I scraped the pan with some water over a burner, but briefly. Then I poured it all into a pot, and simmered there, rather than in the roasting dish. The way I did it worked out just fine. I let the juices cool, and scooped the fat off the top to save and use later for frying veggies. Nom nom. Based on user feedback, I used far less salt than the recipe called for, but I think if I had used it all, it would have been really fine. I'll definitely make this again, but next time I'll add some thyme or another herb to the rub, and I'll use all the salt the recipe calls for. I might also add some extra pepper or something red to give it a little tiny extra kick.

So, I forgot to start early and had to do the hurry-up version of this recipe. After applying marinade, I tented as instructed and put the roast right into the oven, at 400 for 2.5 hours. Removed the tent, turned oven to 350 for another hour. Husband RAVED. I don't eat meat so can't confirm, but all the garlic did make the house smell good! We discarded the skin.

This is one of my favorites of all time. After I made it the first time, I craved it constantly. It can however be hard to find this cut of meat. It turns up once in a while at my local grocery store - never when I need it! The one place you can always find it is at a Mexican Market.

This came out so delicious. I think I even overcooked it just a hair and it was still really tasty. My husband loved it. It was really easy to make just takes time. Will definitely make this one again.

Wow folks, nothing like some good, simple roast pig to make your day. This was really fab. I did have to reduce the recipe some to accommodate a smaller roast and had to use fresh rather than dried oregano...but garlic, time, heat and pig were amazing together. My notes are that it is very tough to separate the skin layer from the meat at the start. Be careful with the knife and keep at it. The chicharrón did not get separate treatment from me and I should have to get more yummy, crispy goodness. I am not sure why it would be too salty, it is only 2T for 7lb of meat. Hmmm. And I barely had enough marinade paste to get under all the skin and in the holes. I have been wanting to make this for a while and am SO glad I finally did. I -will- make this again.

Does anyone know what part of the marinade this recipe is telling us to discard? Is it the part under the skin? Advance thanks for any advice! This only gets two forks because it was WAY too salty for me. I'm not sure if the saltiness was my fault or not.I read in the directions to 'discard the marinade' I wasn't sure if I was supposed to scrape the marinade back off the roast after 8 hours or leave it on. Since I was in doubt, I left the adobo under the skin and only 'discarded' the juice that was left in the glass dish after marinating overnight. Two whole tablespoons of salt were in the marinade which resulted in VERY SALTY MEAT and way to salty jus. I made one other mistake. I accidentally did not make a 'pocket' under the skin. I detached the skin almost completely except for on one side near the bone. To keep the skin in place over the meat I used wooden skewers plunged through the skin into the meat to secure it down. I think this dish would have been much better if it wasn't so salty. I'll make it again in the future using less salt next time and perhaps I will 'discard' ALL THE MARINADE next time to see if that helps. I thought the directions to this recipe were a bit unclear. P.S. I took a tip from a reviewer of Puerto Rican decent {this is their national dish}who said to remove some of the fat from under the skin. Doing that worked out well.

This was delicious but we add additional ingredients to the adobo in Puerto Rico where roast pork is our national dish. Same ingredients as the ones in this recipe except we add 10 ground peppercorns, and 3 tablespoons of EV olive oil (I'd recommend Goya brand because it is very flavorful. Italian has a fruity taste and is too subtle for this) To avoid much of the fat, we detach the skin but not completely and cut off the fat, leaving only about 1/4 of an inch. Rub some of the adobo on the pork before pulling back the skin. You can pin the skin down if you like but I've never had it roll up during roasting. I also wanted to mention that the oregano we use is not the Italian oregano which changes the flavor of the dish. We use Mexican oregano. big difference!

Simple and easy marinade, and it smelled heavenly while roasting in the oven. With a large hunk of pork, i had lots of left overs for the next few days! I would love to make it for my next family gathering :)

When I saw this photo in Gourmet, I clipped the recipe knowing I would make this recipe someday. I finally got my hands on a pork shoulder this past weekend and made this dish. The pork meat was so tender and tasty, and the skin was crisp and deliciously porky. My husband loved this and was surprised by how few ingredients went into the dish. I would definitely make this for a potluck party when I want to impress everyone!

Excellent recipe but I cut back on the salt, added chopped cilantro, used sherry vinegar instead of the white, skimmed the fatty juices off after the first 2 hours the added large chunks of carrots, combo of different types of yams and some leeks into the pan for the last hour or more. After taking the veggies out crisped the skin. Served the veggies over some sauteed greens with more chopped garlic and shallots. Next time I make this will give it a Peruvian twist!

Amazing recipe. First timer on it and got rave reviews for Xmas dinner. Yum. Even better the next day. Garlicky, moist, herbal and pull apart tender. Pork shoulder is a cheap cut of meat that becomes the centerpiece of a rich feast.

Note to cooks, I had some problems finding a pork shoulder with the skin on. No gracery store or butcher shop in Seattle had them except around the holidays, but I finally found one at an Asian market. The was very good, and the meat pulled apart with a fork. However, be prepared for A LOT of fat. Personally, I thought the skin was just too rich. It tasted like pork rinds and was the consistency of peanut brittle. My guests liked it though. It truly is very tasty but an incredibly rich dish. Also, after I pulled the skin off to crisp in the over, I put the meat back in the over, too, to render off some of the fat lip under the skin.

Sooo delicious! Rave reviews by all tasters in my home. I did raise the oven temp. to 400 after the foil was removed to aid in the crisping of the skin and it emerged from the oven tender and moist on the inside with picture perfect browned and crispy skin. Served with herbed cornbread dressing and turnip greens.

I made this last night and the meat was tender and moist. However, the outside was not browned. Should I have raised the temperature? I followed the directions.

Wanted to add that can't wait to make "Cubans" Sounds like a delicious sandwich and my husband is the original Dagwood

Absolutely delicious. One of the best pork roasts I have ever made or eaten. I think I might have made a mistake in making slits all over the entire roast and pushing in marinade because when I removed alumunuim foil and parchment paper there was a ton of juice in the bottom of the pan. Didn't need to add the 1/2 cup of water but did anyway to make more of the jus. The jus was great - Not too salty at all

Fabulous. Tender and flavorful. Served with sweet potato pudding, greens and cornbread. Husband and kids raved. Only problem -- gravy was extremely salty so didn't serve it.

My Puerto Rican family was very impressed by this when I made it for Christmas dinner. It's a traditional dish in latino households, particularly on Christmas, and they couldn't get over that I got such an authentic recipe from Epicurious! The chicharron was super crispy, the meat tender and the flavor was incredible. I soaked thin slices of red onion in lime juice for several hours (added a little cilantro before serving for color and freshness) and served as accompaniment with Arroz Con Gandules (rice with pigeon peas) and boiled Yuca. This recipe for Pernil will definitely be used again and again. Thanks so much Epi!

A perfect dish for a cold day! The oven warms the kitchen for 5 hours and delicious smells waft throughout the house. The roast is incredibly tender and moist. This would have been a 4-star review if the gravy had been better -- to my taste, it lacked flavor. I improvised by adding low-sodium chicken bouillon (about a cup) and fresh lime juice. The result was a tasty deep brown broth that is good for dipping, like au jus. Sauteed red cabbage and mashed potatoes were good accompaniments.If served on fresh rolls, this would be an inexpensive way to feed a crowd for Sunday football.

Worth the effort. Followed instructions changing only white balsamic vinegar which had on hand. Froze leftovers and used in Cuban sandwiches. Yummmmmmmm.

This is absolutely delicious. Bought a small roast (only 1.5 lbs) and scaled down the ingredients. Only needed 1 hour roasting un-covered. My 2 yr old loved it.

....and a fine welcome it is to Latino Caribbean food ! My people are from the English speaking W.Indies which means I was tempted to add thyme as opposed to rosemary. I didn't but MIGHT the next time out. As written this is a lovely recipe though I couldn't resist adding 1/2 a head of garlic more.

how much rosemary did you add and how was the herb prepared?

Welcome to the Spanish Speaking Caribbean (Cuba, Puerto Rico and Dominican Republic) We call it Pernil. This is a simple and wonderful recipe. It is a staple during the holidays. Furthermore,it is great in a sandwich, namely the famous Cuban Sandwich. This recipe has been in Spanish speaking Caribbean cookbooks since the early 1950s.

This recipe required quite a lot of time in the oven -- even reading the recipe a few times, I miscalculated the length of time it would take between taking it out of the fridge and the resting time. Start early! The skin was indeed crispy, and people loved it. I made the Emeril Lagasse recipe at the same time (yes, I know it's crazy), and people liked this recipe more. (I've also made the Daisy Martinez recipe and of the 3, Gourmet's recipe wins.)

The first time I try a recipe, to be fair, I try to do it exactly as written. I confess, this time I added rosemary but it was a good call. The pork was a huge hit and came out great. Meat was tender and tasty and we did fight over the crunchy skin. Not wild about the gravy but overall, a keeper.
