The dressing was delicious. Loved the bok choy, cucumber combination. Everything worked great. I've got left overs for work...can't wait!

Yummy - light and fresh meal. My six year old was ecstatic over the chicken and had two bowls. I used regular cucumbers and a red bell pepper. I did not make the dressing because I had some other Asian dressing on hand. My on hand dressing was good and my only regret is that I missed out on the ginger flavor - I love ginger and it would have added a nice dimension.

So easy and delicious, even better the next day.

First off, I admit that I didn't have a couple of the ingredients (English cuke, sugar snaps, and bok choy), and did saute the first few ingredients in chicken stock instead of water, but this was still wonderful. I used a standard cucumber, a smallish amount of green cabbage instead of the sugar snaps and bok choy, and sriracha sauce instead of the jalapeno. Also, following another review, made my own ponzu: 2 parts soy sauce, 2 parts rice vinegar, 1 part citrus juice, 1/2 part sesame oil. My husband and I had this for lunch yesterday and agreed that this will definitely be made again - lots. Oh, and make sure you leave plenty of sauce on the salad - it's wonderful!

Very good light recipe. I added carrots to the recipe instead of cucumber. It was light and tasty!

Delicious! 20min active time is a bit optimistic however. Great light weeknight supper salad. This will become a regular.

Delicious. I have made this twice and added pasta both times (linguini, penne) and amped up the dressing to account for that - plus doubled the jalapeno for zip, and added red cabbage for some lovely color and crunch. A great dish for parties or pot lucks. A definite favorite.

This recipe was absolutely fantastic. So easy to make and incredibly healthy. I tossed the poached chicken in a bit of hoisin and chili paste as suggested and it gave the meat that extra little zip. My husband and I ate the whole bowl and only wish we had more. Def one for the recipe book and highly recommend.

Light, tangy and delicious. I put stars by this recipe in my book so I remember how good it is. The jalapeno adds zing, the cucumber cools, and the ginger is refreshing. Good cheap and healthy- don't leave the snap peas out!

Wow, I love that ponzu!

I only chose 3 forks because "exceptional" is a pretty strong word for a weeknight dinner, even though this is a great and really healthy weeknight dinner. We've already made it more than once. I recommend adding 0.5 tbsp sesame oil and cutting the vegetable oil to 2 tbsp for the dressing to give it a much needed extra kick!

This was ok but it found it a little bland. I like the suggestion for hoisin sauce made by another reviewer. I will make this again but I will try to increase the flavour.

Just ate this for lunch and loved it! Easy to prepare, light and full of flavor. Great to make the night ahead and bring to work for lunch. Would also make this for company. A keeper for sure!

I was confused about what to do with the Bok Choy... and since I couldn't find the "baby" kind, I used the large one, shredded it with the slicer blade in my food processor, and then cooked in the broth along with the peas. The results were delicious. So much so, my husband and I even drank the broth. The salad was a hit!

This recipe was a little bland. Cooking the chicken with the scallion and ginger really didn't flavor it at all, so I added some hoisin sauce and sweet chili sauce to the chicken before I tossed it with the rest of the salad and dressing. I also added toasted almonds and some red cabbage. Unfortunately, I couldn't find baby bok choi so I used a large one -- BIG mistake. It tasted so bitter that it overpowered the dish and was basically inedible. I ended up heating the whole thing to slightly cook the bok choi, and that kind of saved it. Word to the wise, if you know you like cooked bok choi, it does NOT mean you like it raw! I may make this again, but might try subbing the bok choi for different greens.

I, also, was skeptical about the raw bok choy, but I used it anyway, and next time I make this (i.e. right now) I'm going to use even more of it. Use baby bok choy. This is the best recipe I've found on epicurious. Mmm, mmm! I didn't have the ponzu the first time, so substituted with vinagre, lime and sesame oil. I can't imagine the real deal being any better.

I'm not rating this dish because I modified it somewhat ... Raw bok choy didn't appeal to me, so I sauteed it with the other veggies (including half an onion) until they were all crisp tender. I also made my own ponzu sauce, since I couldn't find any in the market (2 parts soy sauce, 2 parts rice vinegar, 1 part orange juice, 1/2 part sesame oil). The jalapeno added a nice kick and my husband and I both enjoyed the "warm" version of this dish.

Rating: 3
My boyfriend really enjoyed this meal. This is saying a lot because he doesn't like vegetables! I put in some hoisin sauce instead of ponzu (couldn't find it anywhere!), I used a bit of lime juice, sesame oil, and sprinkled with sesame seeds. Also, there were no red jalepeno peppers at the store, so I bought green. Since I never tried this pepper before, I tasted it and realized it was too spicy for me! I ended up putting the green jalapeno peppers in the broth that the chicken poached in. I will make this again!

I followed the recipe as written and thought this was a nice salad. I cut my bok choy very thin and would do thicker strips next time, but that's just a texture thing. Also I put the dressing in a container with a lid and shook instead of whisking. Easier. And I kept the veggies, chicken and dressing separate because I think it will store better that way. No soggy greens tomorrow.

Rating: 3
This was pretty tasty. I was nervous about the bok choy. I'd never tasted it raw before and had a bite and wasn't in love. I only used the green parts. All the tastes came together really well in the finished salad, though. My cucumber ended up being no good (very strange), but it wasn't a major loss. This dressing is great. Agree with the others that bringing the chicken down to a soft simmer is the way to go for maximum juiciness. Try chopping your veggies and refrigerating, then shredding the chicken and serving just after it's done ... the contrast between the cold and warm is nice! Salting at the end isn't necessary ... the dressing has ponzu in it, after all.

Amazingly delicious, and healthy. I made this vegetarian (!) by using Quorn tenders instead of chicken. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It's a great blend of flavors and textures.

This was really delicious. I particularly loved the dressing, though I do think it could have been a bit thicker.

This is a good variation on the traditional Asian chicken salad. Adding the pepper was tasty. Before boiling the chicken, I added black peppercorns and a little white wine to the water. For the salad dressing, I only put in 2T veggie oil and 1/2 t (or so) of sesame oil. Other reviewers suggested adding nuts, but my husband ate the nuts I was going to use before I could add them. It didn't matter, there was already enough crunch in the salad.

This was a big hit and everyone had seconds. I did alter the recipe significantly though. I could not find ponzu sauce easily so I used hoisin sauce instead. I marinated chicken in hoisin sauce with garlic and ginger and then sauteed it. I also added extra ginger, water chestnuts and chopped peanuts. This was quick and quite tasty. I will certainly make it again!

Pretty good and simple to make, but not quite knock your socks off flavor. I will make this again because the bok choy is a nice change for a summer salad.

If you poach the chicken the right way, NOT boiling it but simmering gently for about 20 minutes, your chicken will not be dry and stringy. After it was done (with parsley instead of cilantro)I put it on the plate as directed, then added in all the veggies one group at a time, leaving out the cucumber until everything was cooked. This part of the cooking went quite fast...I cooked the bok choy because I don't like it raw, but only for about 4 minutes. Less time for the other veggies. I guess you'd call it "crisp-tender". The broth was so flavorful I saved it for another use. Served it on angel hair spaghetti since I didn't have sticky rice, which I'll use next time. I let the whole thing cool down for about a half hour and we ate it warm. I'm going to try it now and see if it is better today. Yes, it was a bit bland. I'll also jazz it up with the already suggested garlic. More ginger would be great too.

Great, simple recipe, yet very elegant for a party lunch or dinner. Subbed larger (teenage) bok choy and only used white parts and still was great.

Exceptional. Thanks for introducing me to baby bok choy in salad and ponzu. I suggest experimenting to taste - I prefer scallops or other seafood instead of chicken. For the dressing, I suggest adding 2 or 3 cloves of garlic, juice of a lime, and put through blender. For vegetables, a zucchini instead of cuke maybe. Also tried edamame instead of snap peas - not so great - acquired taste maybe. I got my ponzu from an Asian market that also has a Korean version - anyone tried that?

This was very good. Followed the recipe almost to the letter (subbed dried pepper flakes for red jalepeno; my market didn't have that) and we enjoyed it. Made good leftovers for work lunches, too. Felt something was missing -- I might add chopped peanuts next time, or perhaps some peanut butter to the dressing to make it more substantial. All in all, good weeknight recipe.

My family loved this--even a 10 and 12 year old! I doubled the dressing because I love Ponzu. I passed chopped peanuts and served a scoop of brown rice next to it. Will definately make again!

I'm in a CSA and really didn't know what to do with baby bok choy I picked up today! This recipe ended up being just perfect. I used a serrano pepper instead, and added a little honey to the dressing, then topped with sliced almonds. Salad was very light and healthy tasting!

We really liked this. It's very light and flavorful. I had never had raw bok choy before (only cooked), so was a bit concerned about how it would taste, but needn't have been. The dressing softens it up and is delicious. I can see that this will be a regular on our dinner table this summer!

Excellent combination of flavors culminating in an extremely healthy salad. I added some cashews (to make it a little unhealthy!) and served with naan. The only drawback: lots of chopping makes it a bit labor-intensive.

My boyfriend made this for me and I loved it so much I've replicated it three times already. It's so incredibly light and fresh, love all the vibrant greens in there. I especially enjoy the crunch of the sugar snap peas and the baby bok choy. Tried it one night with regular bok choy, not the same, stick to the baby bok choy. We toasted some sesame seeds and added that to the salad and it was very good. It's the perfect summer salad.

I made this for my book club and everyone liked it a lot. But, here in New Mexio, the baby bok choy and sugar snap peas were a little wilted--I gave them an ice water soak for a couple of hours before starting and I think that really helped. I also added some toasted, chopped almonds, which everyone thought was good. It took longer than suggested, but, I was making this for 12, but since everything could be done ahead of time, it was still fine. I kept everything separate, then combined at the last minute. Also, discovered that "Ponzu" is also a citrus based vinegar. You definately want to use the soy variety.

This was excellent! This would be a great meal for a hot summer night. The flavor was unbelievable! I'm going to add extra ginger next time but I love ginger! If you are looking for ponzu sauce...it's with the soy sauce..It's basically a citrus flavored soy sauce.

THIS RECIPE A KEEPER!! My husband isnt a veggie eater but he was willing to try since he loves soy sauce. It was a big hit. The portion was big for the 2 of us but I had it for breakfast the next 2 day. I added crunchy chow mein noodles over it and it was spectacular. This will definitely be a maker once a week and I'll try adding broccoli next time. Next time I'll triple the dressing recipe. Ponzu must be very popular at the Asian section because I bought the last bottle. YUM YUM!!

I made this last night and it was delicious! I ended up using a regular green jalapeno and frozen snap peas, because of availability at the supermarket. I also chopped up and blanched some broccoli rabe to add and it was quite good. Also, the ponzu recipe provided by the previous reviewer worked well. I recommend serving this with rice.

Delicious, fairly easy recipe. To the cook from Seattle, WA, thanks for the Ponzu recipe. Love all the citrusy flavors. Will definitely make htis again and again.

I thought this was great. For those wondering, 'ponzu' is a type of citrusy Japanese sauce. It lends a lemon-y, lime-y, tangerine-y taste to the dressing. I did not have a hard time finding it but there are lots of Asian markets in Seattle. I also found a recipe for how to make your own: 1/4 cup rice vinegar, 1/2 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice or a mixture of lemon and lime in a 2:1 ratio, 1 to 2 tablespoons of finely grated fresh tangerine peel, 1/3 cup tamari or soy sauce, 1 tablespoon mirin (optional). Combine all ingredients, it makes about a cup. Anyway, I will definitely make this again because it is quick, healthy, and fresh!

This recipe is delicious! It is very fresh-tasting and a little spicy from the green onion, ginger, and pepper. It reminds me of fancy salads I get in restaurants and think, "I wish I knew how they make this!" I will definitely make this again in the future, since it is fairly easy, extremely healthy, and quite tasty.
