I made this dish as written with the exception of adding shiitake and button mushrooms to the sauce. It was delicious. We will use this sauce for chicken as suggested by other cooks.

Made this last night with boneless chicken breasts and mushrooms (as recommended by others)and it was wonderful. It's a bit rich with the half and half so next time I'll use less. Very nice dish and wonderful presentation with fresh chopped sage sprinkled on before serving.

I made this last night for my husband and we are still talking about it this morning. It was fabulous! Great rich flavor to an otherwise bland meat. I can't wait to make it for my friends.

I made this recipe as is and thought it was delicious. One reviewer said it was a little bitter... I would say just a tad, but I just loved this. Wonderful!

Everyone thought this recipe was great....I followed instructions exactly as described (although ingredient list does not include pepper but instructions say to use pepper)

I made this pretty much as the recipe states except I used turkey stock instead of beef broth and it was fantastic. Definite keeper - easy and delicious

I started the recipe prepared to add mushrooms and garlic, and 2% milk in place of half and half, when I discovered we were out of sage. We did have fresh rosemary sprigs, so I substituted that for sage. If you don't like rosemary this would not work, but if you do, it's a fabulous substitute. It was a truly elegant, quick dish. I also prepared risotto finished off with crumbled bleu cheese and diced red pear, and a side of sauteed spinach. You'd think the risotto and veal would have too strong a taste to compete with one another - and perhaps for some people it would - but for us, it was perfection. We agreed this recipe is a keeper. I appreciated the tip to make sure the chops were room tempurature. The sauce is one that gives the impression you worked much harder than this! Enjoy.

This was really lovely and so simple. Didn't have half and half so just added a splash of full fat milk and it wa great. This is definitely going to be a favourite.

This is really great. We have made this several times-- with mushrooms and without, fresh sage or dried--and it's always a lovely dinner, especially with a little creamy herb polenta and some fresh haricots...

Nice on a cold night (when grilling the chops isn't an option). Fast (make sure your chops are at room temperature so they cook evenly) and elegant. I used a splash of 1% milk and it did add a complexity with the mustard (in lieu of the 1/2 and 1/2).

Rating: 3
DELICIOUS!!! I too, did not have the 1/2 and 1/2. so I used sour cream, and I also added mushrooms to the sauce because with what other reviewers said, it sounded good, and we like mushrooms. I think that the recipe "as is" would also be terrific, and next time, I will follow it to the letter just to see...Veal can sometimes be bland, but this recipe takes care of that, what with seasoning the meat, searing the meat in the pan, and adding the other flavors to the sauce. Great recipe!!

My husband loves veal chops and was thrilled by these! I used double cut, left them on the bone & grilled them - they were spectacular. The sauce was wonderful and can be used with other dishes. They present splendidly. I'm planning to serve them at a formal dinner for 10 guests in the fall.

Made this with chicken as we are not big fans of veal. The sauce is absolutely wonderful! Rich without being too much and lovely flavor. Served over rice to catch every drop!

Delicious, easy recipe, BUT ... I found the sage to be a little on the bitter side. I'll use less next time.

This recipe was delicious. I was searching last-minute for a quick recipe with ingredients I had on-hand and found this one. It was simple, fast and very tasty. I know when a recipe is a winner because my husband asks "what do you call this". Epicurious has come through for me again!

This is a simple, quick and delicious entree. I served it with mushrooms, baked potatoes, and green bean. What could be easier. I used veal demi-glace for the beef broth because I had it on hand. I substituted FF sour cream for the half and half to lighted it up and that's what I had in the refrigerator.

This is another winner. Served the chops with Potatoes Roasted with Rosemary and Sea Salt (from this site) and the green beans other reviewers agree on. Will definitely make this again. Will also try the sauce with pork tenderloin.

A solid dish. I guilded the lilly a bit by stuffing the chop with a duxelle of portabellas. The Cab deglazing also added a nice depth to the sauce as recomended in another review. Also, I like veal with rosemary which I used to a nice result.

This recipe is fantastic. The flavors blend so well together. My husband and I really enjoyed the veal chops tremendously. Would make this dish again in a heartbeat.

Just finished dinner and thought this was very good, however, next time I will make it with pork chops. I think that might be an even better match of meat and spices and a better value to boot!.

Outstanding, however, I used 2 inch veal chops and stuffed cloves of garlic into the chops. Also, added a quarter cup of cabernet to the sauce. just great!

This was very tasty and very easy. I didn't have half & half so I used sour cream. I think mushrooms would make a great addition to this dish. The cream sauce would be very good on the mushrooms.

A pure delight! BRAVO! My personal "touch" : cooked a mirepoix (finely diced onions, carrots and celery + mushrooms, about 2 TBs in all)in olive oil + butter before adding the chops. Deglazed with wine wine after. Strained the sauce. Used fresh sage only. Replaced beef broth with leftover chicken juices from roasted chicken... (watch salt!!) Black pepper is a must! My lover wants to marry me now!!!!!! THANKS. ;-)))

The sauce was delicious and very easy to make- used gresh ground pepper to spice it up a bit.

This recipe was just delicious. The sauce was terrific, wonderfully flavorful, and as good as anything you might order at a fine restaurant. It is definitely something you could serve for company (though it is true that buying the veal chops is a "splurge"). But since it is so quick and easy to make, it is great for a weeknight, too. A real keeper! (By the way, I agree that green beans and potatoes make a nice accompaniment. I simmered the beans in water first until they were tender, then drained them, put in a bit of olive oil and garlic, and warmed them up again. This was easy and very tasty).

Yum, Yum, Yum! This dish was absolutely delicious. We used 1-1/2 inch thick chops, and it was heavenly. Made the single recipe for the sauce, and it was plenty, served with roasted new potatoes and green beans. I don't think I would recommend extra sauce over rice as other cooks have. We think the richness of the sauce called for a lighter side choice. Served it with a 1995 Clos du Bois Cabernet, and it was a big treat for a Sunday night dinner for two.

The most time consuming part of his dish was finding the veal chops but it was well worth the effort. Once the chops were found this was a great Saturday night meal before going to a movie. As advertised is was perfect with roasted potatoes and sauted green beans. It would show off a mature red burgundy or a full bodied Cal or Oregon Pinot.

I made this dish for New Year's Eve dinner 1999-2000 and it was a great success. I doubled the recipe for 5 veal chops. The sauce was wonderful. I serve it with potatos gallette and asparagus. Simple and impressive!
