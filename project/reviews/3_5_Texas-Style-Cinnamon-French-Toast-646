I had been craving French Toast for WEEKS and I finally decided to make it at 1 AM :D This recipe is pretty good, tastes just like any other french toast recipe. I used normal white bread and substituted 2% milk in for the half and half. I put all 3 teaspoons of ground cinnamon in the mixture--but it tastes just fine! :) For future cookers using thin slices of bread, be sure to not let the bread soak too long. I sooked my for just about 5 seconds for each side! If you soak too long, it'll just fall apart and yeah. no good. :)

Make sure to cut the french bread as thin as possible so that your bread isn't soggy inside.

This was a great basic French toast recipe. Like everyone else, I skipped the powdered sugar. It doesn't make a huge amount. I only got three thick slices before the egg mixture ran out. Do make sure to use the baking dish; I didn't and it meant the cinnamon all glommed on the first piece of bread and the third piece had none.

I used whipping cream (to make it ultra rich), 2 tsp of cinnamon,and brown sugar as suggested by other cooks. Came out marvelous. I only soaked it for about 10 min. total for both sides. Definitely putting this in my recipe box.

Excellent french toast, would make for guests. Worked well as a filling breakfast, use real maple syrup for topping this. I think I may try adding some more cinnamon next time, as there's no such thing as too much cinnamon!

Made this for New Year's Day breakfast and it was delicious. Added all cinnamon at once, skipped the icing sugar but added warm fresh strawberries and raspberries as topping in addition to warm maple syrup. Will definitely make this again - best french toast ever!

Very easy to make with what was laying around. Skipped the sugar, added a dash of rum extract. Crushed some candied pecans into a coarse powder and dredged slices in the pecan crumbs after the egg bath. It added some flavor and texture to the toast. Would make again for an easy weekend alternative to the ho-hum eggs & bacon routine.

Good recipe. Works fine with normal canadian white bread. No need to soak that for more than a second.

I just used plain white bread and didn't soak longer than a minute. I poured a little of the egg mixture into the shallow bowl, added a slice of bread, poured some more on top and swhirled it around to coat and then flipped it over once. Everyone really loves this recipe. I make it at least once a month and esp. when I have guests for breakfast/brunch.

I wanted a special treat for when my father was visiting, and this certainly fit the bill. I served this with fresh fruit and a thick cut bacon. This recipe is a keeper!

This has become my favorite recipe for French toast. Don't worry if you have no half and half. I used skim milk and it was still great. Don't let the large amount of cinnamon scare you. It really enhances the flavor. I used the whole amount in the batter, and skipped the powdered sugar, as we don't really like it.

Liked the egginess & cinnamon of this recipe. Only had whole milk. Needs just a pinch of salt in the soaking mixture. Didn't really care for the powdered sugar. Next time will just use a sprinkling of cinnamon & warm syrup.

This is the perfect recipe for a lazy Saturday morning when you crave a tasty treat but don't want to bother with shopping ahead or investing tons of time. Enjoy

My finace and I agree that this is the best french toast that we have ever had! We used this dense crusty french bread and I dried it out in the oven (pre-heated to 350 deg., put in bread and turned off oven) for about 30 minutes before using to keep it from getting too mushy. We will definitely be making this again!

Very, very good!! Wonderful flavors. Instead of the Half & Half; I used 4 Tbsp. Whipping Cream and 2 Tbsp. Skim Milk. I only soaked for 30 seconds and it turned out perfect. Highly recommend!

This was really good. My boyfriend really liked it, and I think it's better than the french toast in most diners and even Hobee's! I made a few adjustments though--used fat free milk instead of half-and-half, used only 1 teaspoon cinnamon coz I'm not a big lover of the cinnamon taste (the result was a hint of cinnamon scent, but no bitterness), used Sara Lee's Honey white bread slices, and substituted safflower oil margarine for the butter. I also soaked the french toast in the pan overnight, and made caramelized pear to top the french toasts. The resulting toasts were crispy on the outside but soft inside. Definitely a keeper for me.

Good recipe. I only had two eggs so I added some evaporated skim milk to saturate the bread. Also, topped with some apples sauted in butter and sugar. Yummm...

This is a great basic french toast recipie. I didnt have half and half so I subed whole milk, and I dindt have french bread, I used 100% whole wheat sliced bread. Also didnt have vanilla extract so I left it out. It still turned out great, my toddlers ate it up and wanted seconds, and they rarely finish thier plates.

I made this for my mom for Mother's Day with homemade egg bread. I didn't have the patience to let it sit, either, but as my mom and I both like firmer French Toast, just a quick dip in the egg mixture was all it took. FYI- I made these with the brown sugar coated bacon for brunch, we didn't finish it all, and we still were so stuffed we couldn't eat for the rest of the day. Superb french toast, better than any I've ever had in a diner, even.

Tasty and easy. I didn't have half and half, so I mixed 4 Tablespoons heavy cream with 2 Tablespoons skim milk. It worked fine. The recipe is a little too rich for an early breakfast, but it's great for brunch or dinner.

Made this recipe this weekend and my family loved it. I also did not soak the bread. Just made it like reg. french toast. I also added a bit more cinnamon as called for and it was wonderful! I think the cream really adds something to this.

oh yeah, really hit the spot. i was too hungry to let it soak for 30 minutes so i did 30 seconds and it turned out nicely as well... a little thinner, but i dont like it too mushy anyway. the brown sugar recommendation made it a 4 instead of a 3. ohboy.

I am a horrible cook. This turned out so amazing for me, that I make it every weekend when I'm invited to brunch and everyone thinks I'm a gourmet chef! (I found it's still teriffic if all you have is Wonder Bread and no time to chill the mixture with the bread!) It's given me the courage to try making other things! Thank You! :::sniff:::

this was the best munchies food two stoners could ever have, it was so damn good. IMO put lots of syrup and icing sugar. :)

Very bland and disappointing.

Guests told me this was the best french toast they'd ever had. I doubled the recipe and had enough to serve 8 people. Because of a time crunch, I let the bread soak overnight, and it was amazing!

My daughter made this recipe in a breakfast that she cooked for me, and it was delicious!! Takes french toast to new heights!! Very easy to prepare and makes ordinary french toast special.
