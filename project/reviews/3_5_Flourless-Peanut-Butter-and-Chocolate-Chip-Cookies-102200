I was so pleased with this easy recipe. Be sure to cool them for the full 5 minutes on the cookie sheet before removing or they will definitely fall apart on you! My husband is a true cookie connoisseur and he raved about these. I have already made them twice and another batch is on the weekly agenda!

Recently, I made these quite successfully following the recipe (but dropping the sugar to 3/4 cup). Tonight I made them with half Skippy peanut butter and half all natural almond butter (it is what I had on hand) I threw in an extra egg white to hold them together. The batter was very gloopy, so I used a spoon to drop them onto the parchment paper covered pan. They came out OK but neither peanuty or almondy and a little too sweet. I prefer the full peanut butter taste and less sugar. I doubt I needed the extra egg white, but the almond butter was much drier in texture than the peanut butter.

I used palm sugar instead of brown sugar and they turned out great.

I've made these about five times. I like the mini chocolate chips for this. I've struggled with how to store them. If I keep them in ziplock bags, they tend to lose their crispness. Overall, a good cookie that I will continue to make.

I ate an entire plate of these they were so yummy! I would not, however, give them four stars because the consistency was lacking. They were very fragile cookies. But my were they tasty.

These cookies were great; used half cup Splenda and half cup brown sugar, and added some peanut butter chips. Easy, relatively healthy, and tasted great. Will make again

I love this recipe! I've made it many times and is still one of my favorites. It doesn't make many cookies but I always double the recipe.

I'm considering this recipe a delicious disaster. The dough never stuck together with the chips and they burned after 8 minutes at 350F. The under cooked ones in the second batch were pretty tasty still.

A little too sweet for my taste, but otherwise, amazingly easy and delicious. I made thumbprints in the middle and added jam. Would make again but try 3/4 cup sugar... other recipes I've seen call for only 1/2 cup for this quantity of p.b. ;-)

These were wonderful! Super fast, made them after dinner and was eating a cookie 30 mins later! I substituted a banana for half the sugar and they came out great, the PB and banana flavors shown through perfectly.

I made these for Passover and everyone loved them. They are easy and very good! I placed a mini peanut butter cup in the center before baking. They sell the small size ones at Trader Joe's. I will make these again since they come together very quickly and are very good.

This is a fantastic recipe. I used freshly ground peanut butter & had no problems with it! Quickest cookies EVER! Great way to move away from wheat!

Rating: 0
I was amazed at how much they were like a normal, crumbly, slightly chewy cookie. I found the amount of sugar a little too much for my liking so will do again with maybe a third less. I took them to work and had to pass around the recipe to most of my colleagues!

Fantastic cookies - people are always asking for the recipe! I sometimes modify it to be vegan by replacing the egg with half a banana. (To be truly vegan the chocolate needs to be dairy free too). I also use Skippy Natural Super Chunk peanut butter because it holds together better than others. The banana version comes out chewy rather than crispy which I prefer.

Great cookies! Very soft and moist, but hold together nicely. I used smooth peanut butter and chilled the dough for 30 min before baking so they were thicker, not flat.

Simple, delicious, and gluten free! Even if you don't have a Gluten allergy, these are still yummy. My brother and sister ADORED them. Just be sure to let them sit for a few minutes until serving. I also cut down on the chocolate chips a bit and there were plenty.

Rating: 3
I made these with unsweetened chunky organic peanut butter, and half the chocolate, and didn't pack the sugar because I don't like cookies that are sickening sweet. So - they were great, but of course they could have used a bit more sugar! :) I'd add about a third cup next time. Bake them for ten minutes.

Brought this as gluten free dessert and the cookies were a bit hit, they were gone in about 10 minutes and they were enjoyed by adults and kids alike. They were very easy to make. I used a one Tablespoon scoop and it worked great. I will be bringing these for Passover too.

Super easy & delish. I only used 1/2 cup mini semisweet chips and thought that was perfect. Then again, I like peanut butter more than chocolate. Refrigerating dough, flattening dough balls a bit and watching the cook time really helped. My cookies were moist and super YUM!

so good! I also shortened the cooking time to about 9 1/2 or 10 minutes. I also added butterscotch chips to half the batch. yummmm

No different than the standard PB cookie but crumblier. By all means,if you want a fast cookie and especially if you can't have wheat, they are a good option. But for some reason (maybe some of the reviews?) I expected these would be very different than the standard--softer, richer, creamier--like the difference b/t a regular cake and a flourless one. I was wrong--they taste like the basic PB cookie

Rating: 4
O M G!!!! Oh my goodness these are divine! I don't like peanut butter- can't stand it....but I decided to try a part of one cookie and am in total disbelief. These are the best cookies that I have ever had. Moist inside, tasty, great amount of chocolate, crisp on the outside....I can't wait for my husband to try them tonight! Even the peanut butter tasted great! I can't believe it. :) I also liked that they are flourless-no mess to clean up lol. Thanks for these cookies!!!!

Excellent and gluten free! I used natural, creamy PB and no chocolate chips, and doubled the vanilla. I baked 11 minutes which produced a too-soft cookie (if there is such a thing) which set nicely after cooling on the sheet 5 minutes as per the recipe. I baked in both rounded balls as well as thumb-print style cookies and the rounded balls definitely made a softer cookie, if that's what you prefer. yum yum yum - love a simple, quick recipe like this.

Rating: 4
I was skeptical, especially when seeing how the dough turned out (greasy, barely enough dough to hold the chocolate chips). BUT, they are delicious! Very chewy and tasty. Perfect for gluten-free diets. I used creamy Skippy PB and added some chopped peanuts. Baked for 10-11 minutes at 325 convection. Definitely will make again!

Rating: 3
Liked them a lot...used regular sized choc chips as they were on hand, but but think that the minis would probably be better. Mine cooked a bit faster (10 minutes), but my oven might be a bit hot. A bit crumbly after a day or so, but still yummy.

These cookies are wonderful with or without the chocolate chips. They stay chewy even after a few days- if they don't get gobbled up too fast!

Yum Yum....Roll them into balls and then press your thumb into the center of it before baking for 10min and it makes for a nice chewy inside and crunchy outside. Everyone loved them! This recipe made 2 dozen.

Not only are these cookies delicious but they are really easy to make! My only word of advice is that the baking time given in the recipe (12 min.) is far too long; I burnt my first batch and reduced the time to 9:30/10 minutes, and the cookies turned out fine after I made the adjustment. I'll definitely make these again.

I'm making cookies for coworkers this Christmas and am trying all new recipes. Out of three different types of cookie, this is a FAVORITE! I didn't have chunky peanut butter, so I crunched up dry roasted peanuts. I also added Back to Nature's "Granola to Go; Wild Blueberry Walnut with Flax Seed." This cookie is outstanding!

Rating: 4
This recipe was fantastic! I used homemade peanut butter and organic turbinado sugar. For chips, I used milk chocolate. I refrigerated the dough for 1/2 hour before making into balls. These came out soft and delicious. My parents and my kids loved them. I will definately make these a regular treat.

Rating: 4
This is one of my three all-time favorite cookie recipes. I have made it countless times since it first appeared in "BA" ten years ago. I always follow the recipe exactly, except I triple it so that I end up with about 6 dozen cookies to eat! I love the flavor, and they never seem to go stale even after weeks in the cookie jar. The reviewer who used organic peanut butter and splenda, and then complained that they weren't very good - well, DUH! Follow the recipe!! Do be careful not to overcook, but if you refrigerate the dough for an hour before baking, you won't need to worry about that.

Rating: 3
AMAZING!!! However,I made these changes: add only 1/2 cup light brown sugar (packed in),instead of large egg add one EXTRA LARGE egg, use all natural chunky peanut butter (Smuckers) well stirred, 1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate morsels (Hersheys) and 1/2 cup Reese's peanut butter chips. Yielded a dozen using full rounded tablespoons. Do not over cook. Mine took 12 min. (adjust to less time if making smaller size cookies) VOILA!!! Yum.

Rating: 4
Super easy and quick recipe. Only bake for about 8-9 minutes, because 12 is too long - they will be overdone. I have a friend who can't eat wheat or dairy and this is a perfect recipe to make for her!

Rating: 2
Good is a fairly generous review. I didn't even really eat any of them, but that is becuase they didn't meet my standard for tastiness required to absorb some of my caloric consideration for the day. I used organic crunchy peanutbutter and splenda brown sugar (which is .5 cup for every 1 cup real brown sugar.) It actually needed more sweetness. Maybe because I used the organic PB there wasn't as much sugar in the other ingrediants. Meh. Go for a walk and make some real cookies.

excellent quick recipe...as another reviewer mentioned, you should cut the sugar in half--it's way too sweet otherwise!!

This is such a simple recipe to make! I made these cookies with my son on a rainy day and he had fun licking the "leftovers" (peanut butter on a spatula) while the cookies were in the oven. He wanted to gobble every one up after they were done! It is now our signature cookie for a rainy, snowy, or just because day!

We are a GF/DF, so this was an excellent recipe. It fulfilled those requirements, was easy, and tasty. I used 1C fresh ground peanut butter, sugar as specified, whipped the egg before adding, added about 2T almond oil to give it a smooth consistency, and omitted vanilla since I didn't have it. Since my DH doesn't like chocolate, I made half the batch with Enjoy Life choc chips (DF/GF) and half without the chips. Used a spoon to make small tbspn size cookies -- got about 32 cookies total. Even though I like chocolate, the cookies without chocolate were better -- more peanut buttery. I will definitely be making these again!

Rating: 2
I wouldn't say that these are the best peanut butter cookies in the world, but they're definitely worth eating. They're great for those with gluten allergies. This is a recipe that I would keep on the back burner for times when I don't have standard cookie ingredients in the house but want to whip up some cookies.

Rating: 4
Ah, the wonders of leavening agents... You'd never guess there wasn't any flour in these cookies. They're relatively moist (thank-you, brown sugar), although they do harden up a bit the next day. Just the right amount of sweet, just the right amount of salty, good crumb... they're great! Some have mentioned burning problems with them: it would be best to NOT bake these on dark, non-stick pans; plain 'ol aluminum would work best.

Rating: 4
I have made these cookies so many times - everyone I've made them for loves them, even those who don't like nuts in their baked goods! I follow the recipe exactly. Make a double batch though - it's not many, and you can use 1 jar of PB and 1 bag of mini chips. Find a cookie scoop (like a mini ice-cream scoop) - makes it go quicker and less messy. LET THE COOKIES COOL ON THE PANS FIRST before transferring to the racks, they will hold together that way. These are amazing!

Rating: 2
These were good but not great. I have an awesome recipe which also look better. These crack and are somewhat dry having the look and consistency of ginger cookies. Use regular sugar, omit vanilla and baking soda (no rise and no cracks) when they come out of the oven put a chocolate kiss in the center of each cookie. Makes 36. Bake 10 minutes at 350. And an absolute must is non-organic, non- natural peanut butter, just the regular skippy or jiff because this is what causes the cookies to ooze, and burn, like other reviewers have stated. Go for the Kissy Cookies! egg, peanut butter, suger - that's it and 36 chocolate kisses - everybody's favorite.

Rating: 4
These are the best cookies I have ever made... most of the time. They are a bit cranky so if they don't turn out the first time try again. They are worth it. I always make at least a double batch. They don't make nearly as much as the recipe claims. Plus it just doesn't come together for me with a single batch. If your eggs are on the smaller side, beat another egg and add half or so (to the double batch). Use that oily, organic oozy peanut butter (but not Marathon Brand - that was terrible for me). The dough should be a bit on the oily side in my opinion. I look for a darker looking peanut butter and use only creamy. And I use dark chocolate and break into chunks. Cook around 9 minutes, let sit on the pan a few minutes and cool on a rack. The result should be slightly crispy on the outside but moist and chewy on the inside. Fabulous. Buy a good baking pan if you don't have one. That made a big difference for me.

Rating: 2
i should have read all the reviews before baking but it sounded so good i dove right in. BIG MISTAKE! i baked these on nonstick cookie sheets with parchment paper and both batches burnt in less than 8 minutes WAY before I planned on checking on them. Actually, I smelled burning and as soon as I could pull them out it was too late :( my oven rarely overcooks things so it was a surprise Next time i'd bake them for about 5-6 minutes and also make smaller balls as most of them ran together as well.

I found this recipe this morning and subsequently made it in the afternoon. The great thing was that I already had all of the ingredients in my pantry. I halved the recipe and substituted natural almond butter for the peanut butter. The dough was, I would imagine, less stiff than it would have been without the alteration, but this made no difference to the result. The cookies came out wonderfully - I prefer a softer cookie, so I really enjoyed this recipe.

I was excited to see a flourless cookie, since I've recently found myself to have a wheat sensitivity. These certainly taste delicious and the texture is just right. 15 minutes was far too long in the oven, though. My first batch was overly dark at about 10 minutes. I'll try 8 or 9 minutes next time. Also, I didn't have any milk or semi- sweet chocolate chips, but I did happen to have real white chocolate chips. They were a great addition with chopped, salted peanuts!

Great cookie. Fast like everyone says. Def will become a go to easy dessert for unexpected company or last minute sweet cravings, since I always have all the ingredients on hand. Baked them at 375 for 10mins and ended up with beautifully browned cookies with crispy edges and chewy middle. Also used chocolate chunks instead of chips. Might cut the sugar a little next time. Since I am always trying to cut the sugar. :)

so easy and delicious!! i got rave reviews for these when i dropped them off for the ambulatory surgery staff today. i doubled the recipe to make sure i had enough. doubling is great with this one because 2 cups of peanut butter is an 18 oz. jar (no measuring!) and 12 oz of mini choc chips is one standard size bag. i softened the peanut butter in the microwave to make it easier to stir as well. i will definitely add this to my repertoire! (and i don't even like peanut butter much.)

I made these in the amount of time it took my partner to plate up dinner! Easiest cookies I have ever made. Not to mention, they were divine. I used Adam's Natural crunchy peanut butter so it wasn't too sweet. I also only had a bar of Valrhona chocolate in the cabinet(oh, what a shame.) :) I chopped that up and threw that in for the chocolate. ...yummy... Tonight, we are trying them again with gluten free oats from Bob's Red Mill. I'm looking forward to them!

I made these the other night and I thought that they weren't too special, but still a good cookie. I used creamy peanut butter and the normal sized chocolate chips. This was a very simple and fast recipe. I will probably make these again, but I think I will try it with the crunchy peanut butter.

Rating: 4
Wow, these were sooo good and so easy. I doubled the recipe using the suggestion of cutting the sugar down to 2/3 cup and it was plently sweet. I used regular size chips and it was a little difficult to mold (not roll) the cookies to hold their shape. Some just fell apart on the cookie sheet so I ate all the mis- shaped ones, darn what cooks have to go through - ha. I think I will try a 1/2 and 1/2 mixture of crunchy and smooth PB on the next run. Got lots of requests for the recipe.

I don't often take the time to review things, but this recipe is a lifesaver. Having two members of my family who are gluten free, it's tough to find any baked goods that taste great (especially for kids during the holidays). I also used half the sugar and they came out great with hershey kisses in the middle. Thanks!

Good, but not as amazing as some I just got in a local bakery and was trying to replicate. But, as an FYI to anyone having problems using organic or natural peanut butter: I prefer organic/natural no added sugar/oil PB too, but you can't use in in recipes based on store brand varieties with sugar and hydrogenated oil. You will end up with a sticky mess.

Rating: 2
I didn't think this was a "great" recipe. I made it according to the original recipe and it turned out fine but it was an average cookie. The texture was a little crumbly but not bad, I used bittersweet chocolate chips - the larger ones which really added a nice chocolate punch and without them I think the cookie wouldn't have even reached the "good status". I probably won't make these again unless I need a really quick cookie, which is the real reason I chose this cookie to begin with.

I had the dark chocolate peanut butter from Peanut Butter & Co. in NYC on hand so I combined 2/3 cup of that with 1/3 of skippy superchunk (to keep the chunky texture). I took other reviewers advice and reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup (and the choc chips to 2/3 too) and they were definitely sweet enough. I had no trouble rolling balls of dough (maybe b/c of the smooth chocolate peanut butter?); they baked in 13 min - yummy! I will definitely make these again.

Such a good recipe for so many reasons! Very tasty, so easy and quick. And it will be wonderful for the few people I know who cannot have flour. Used a medium size cookie scoop which is equal to 1 tablespoon and it took no time at all! Made some with and some without the chocolate chips just to have the comparison and it was great both ways.

I followed the recipe, using organic peanut butter. I could not make balls nor could I scoop them. So I patted the dough into a baking pan and baked for 20 minutes. They fell apart when I tried to cut them. I will use the crumbs for ice cream topping. My husband took a spoonful and said it was like eating sugar and chocolate with a little peanut flavor. I do not know what all the other reviewers were raving about. I am an experienced baker and have not had many failures.

These cookies were soft, peanutty, rich in taste, and suprisingly light in texture - almost cakey. I love that they retained their lovely round, thick shape, which I find much more appetizing than flatter, chewier cookies. My only changes were that I used 2/3 cup sugar instead of the full cup, and I used 1/2 cup chocolate chips and 1/2 cup peanut butter chips. The result was a cookie that was peanuttier and not too sweet (I hate overly sweet cookies) - perfect for an adult crowd. And, I LOVE that these were so fast and easy to make - less than 30 minutes from start to finish! Even I couldn't mess these up.

These are quite possibly the BEST cookies I've ever tasted (much less baked!)! And by far - the easiest! I used raw brown sugar which gave them a unique texture - which I liked.

Unbelievably good. I used a whole cup of sugar, but went with natural peanut butter. Also added a dash of salt. I can't wait to try variations using dried fruits and almond and cashew butter. What a fantastic cookie!

These are wonderful. I have a friend who is not only allergic to wheat gluten but also to corn and soy. So it's nearly impossible to find/make baked goods for her. I used all natural peanut butter and omitted the chocolate chips (to avoid any corn syrup and soy lecithin) and was a little worried about whether the recipe would hold up. But the cookies turned out perfectly. They were a hit with everyone at the holiday party, and no one would have guessed they were flourless.

Rating: 4
I'm recently gluten-free and now that I can't have them I crave baked goods. Peanut butter cookies are one I really miss. I, like many other reviewers, was skeptical of this recipe, but they were wonderful! Moist, chewy, flavorful. I used 2/3c sugar and will use less next time. I used half peanut butter chips and half semi-sweet chocolate chips to make a full cup. Next time I'll do the same ratio, but to make 2/3 cup. They are quite sweet, so that's why I cut down on those two ingredients. I baked half for 8 minutes and half for 12 to see what I like better and the batch that was cooked for 8 minutes is much better in the long run.

If you have any friends that are gluten intolerant (cannot have flour) MAKE THESE COOKIES FOR THEM THEY WILL LOVE YOU. My sister has Celiac disease which makes her intolerant to gluten. She essentially has said goodbye to yummy baked goods. I made these specifically for her and had to hide them in the laundry room so that she could get them. The entire family loved them. They are light on peanut butter taste, so if you're expecting that taste like a peanut butter cookie I think it is a mild cookie. (you can add peanut butter chips as previously noted) EASY cookie too. I always have these ingredients around. Fun, yummy and easy.

If I could give this 3.5 forks I would. Very good for the simplicity of the recipe. It is a lighter cookie despite the peanut butter and chocolate because of the lack of flour.

These cookies are great! I was forced to use natural creamy peanut butter, as I didn't have any super chunky. I barely had one cup full, but the cookies still turned out great! I also used semi-sweet large chocolate chips. I think I'm on to something, I'll be making these again.

I used half natural crunchy pb, and half creamy "unnatural" pb, half semi-sweet and half milk chocolate chips (both full-size).

These were wonderful, of course. Some notes to previous reviewers: if you found the recipe too sweet using commercial peanut butter (i.e. - Skippy, Jif, or whatever), try natural peanut butter. It's healthier and less sweet. And for the person looking for a non-dairy cookie, there's no need to leave out the chocolate chips. Just shop for semisweet chips that don't have milk products in them, like Trader Joe's house brand, and many generic supermarket brands. Enjoy....

these are really good and of course, super easy. but they aren't super peanutty. if you want a more intense peanut butter taste and a more traditional criss-cross kind of thing, try mom-mom fritch's peanut butter cookies (also on this site) they are also FLOURLESS and super easy and delicious.

I have made this for my family several times and everyone has loved this recipe. I love it because it is so simple, easy and fast. (I like recipes I can memorize and make later so this one's perfect!) But lastnight I took this recipe out on the town... to interesting results. My music and art were featured in this group art show lastnight and I contributed these cookies to their spread of food. At one point in the evening I overheard two women, that I would naturally assume to be snooty LA skinny girls, talking. They were saying... "these are the best cookies I have ever tasted... I am going to eat them all..." I looked over and saw that these cookies dissappeared fastest amongst all the catered food.

It doesn't get better than this considering the ease factor. In under 30 minutes I had warm and VERY GOOD cookies on the table; and I'm not a peanut butter cookie fan. I did not find them "crumbly" at all. They keep extremely well too!

I wasn't too impressed with these cookies. The consistancy was very crumbly. I would rather make my classic "Better Homes & Gardens" chocolate chip peanut butter cookie.

Super fast, uses staple ingredients, and the outcome is fabulous. I brought two batches to a company BBQ and all were gone by the end of the day. I thought that, without flour, the cookies would spread more when baking, but each kept a perfect round shape. No changes or substitutions.

Really yummy and so easy to make. I used creamy peanut butter and Guittard chocolate chips because that is what I usually have on hand, and they turned out delicious! I think the cooks that had the cookies turn out crumbly either cooked them too long or their oven is running a bit too hot. Anyway, make this cookie. With small children at home it's so nice to find anything that is this quick and easy.

Wow, so easy and tasty! I used all natural PB and I even used 2/3c sugar and it was still great. I'm sure the all natural PB gave it a much different taste than had I used regular stuff. The bottoms cook quickly so keep an eye on 'em.

Had to comment again...I made the cookies with 3/4 cup golden brown sugar this time. TOO SWEET! I like them with dark brown sugar MUCH better. They didn't need 12 minutes with the golden sugar and came out too chewy.

these cookies were VERY good! i had about 3/4 cup of generic crunchy peanut butter left so i added 1/4 cup of skippy low carb peanut butter. i only had dark brown sugar and i added more vanilla and a dash of salt. per the other reviewers, i only added 3/4 cup of sugar. in my oven, they took about 12 minutes to cook, then 10 minutes to cool enough to move. they look great and are chewy-gooey goodness. next time i'll add a whole cup of sugar cause i'd like them a bit sweeter. even my unemployed alcoholic boyfriend liked them, and drunks don't like sweets!

I'm known to have a very INSANE sweet tooth and believe it or not, I think these cookies are crazily too sweet. The texture is too chewy (in a taffy sort of way) and it's hardly peanut buttery. Since my friends like it, I'll only make it again for their sake.

Rating: 2
I could not believe that this recipe would work- and if there weren't so many reviews, i wouldn't have bothered. But these cookies turned out beautifully- perfectly golden, puffed, and immaculate! I used smooth peanut butter with a few chopped walnuts (no chunky PB on hand)& Splenda (2 tbsp), as I wanted it low carb. Next time I'll use more sweetner- they needed a bit of a boost, even for me- and I don't really like sugar overload. I used Bakers bittersweet chocolate (1 square) chopped up. These are a great treat for low carbers! But you *MUST* not bake for more than 9 mins, and they HAVE to sit for 5 mins to prevent a crumbly mess. Will perfect this recipe and make again. Recommended!

Rating: 3
These are great, and can actually be made without the baking powder or vanilla if your pantry is very bare. Do not over cook them. All the complaints people have here can be avoided if you take them out of the oven when the edges are cooked and the middle is still very soft - I'd say 8-10 minutes. They're also very good with natural peanut butter and Splenda for a less sugary treat, but they won't change in appearance while baking with the Splenda, so be sure to keep a close eye on the timer while they're in the oven.

This was my favorite college cookie recipe. All it required was a bowl, a spoon, a cookie sheet and an oven. And the cookies came out great every time! To this day people still ask me for the recipe. And if you have a friend, like I do, allergic to dairy products all you have to do is eliminate the chocolate chips and you have a dessert they can eat

This recipe took only 20 minutes to assemble AND bake! Plus it uses only one bowl and no mixer. Clean-up was very easy. Not to mention that the cookies are great too. One tip--I used a cookie scooper sprayed with Pam to form the balls of dough--which saved time.

These cookies are fantastic and so easy to make. I used natural peanut butter (no sugar added), and they came out great. Very rich with great texture. Dare I say they are better than plain chocolate chip cookies. They were a big hit with my husband and friends. Will definitely make them again and again.

This recipe was fabulous! Moist and tender, just fabulous! I suggest using cocoa nibs (the heart of the cocoa nut) instead of chocolate chips. It gives a nutty texture with a chocolate finish. My parents devoured them in 3 days.

I was skeptical but these cookies were great. I found the dough had great consistency. I used golden sugar, but next time I might try Splenda to make it low-carb. I didn't even use chunky peanut butter, but Adam's Smooth PB. I wasn't even that careful w/ my measurements. I did toss in some crushed walnuts, cashews and hazelnuts to make up for the smooth PB and I used Callebaut white and milk chocolate chunks. I also added some chopped up caramels. Turned out wonderful. I love a forgiving recipe that allows you to experiment.

Wow! This recipe is super easy to make, and the results are absolutely delicious. My children LOVE these cookies, and I can whip up a batch in 5 minutes. These cookies come out chewy with the perfect balance of peanut butter and chocolate. They're a definite sweet-tooth satisfier. I used parchment paper on my cookie sheets, instead of greasing them, for quick and easy clean up, and I baked the cookies for 11 minutes instead of 12.It's paramount to let these cookies cool on the sheets for at least 5 minutes before transferring them to racks-this way they won't crumble. This recipe is a definite keeper and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to make a sweet, scumptious and incredibly simple homemade treat.

I tried this recipe with my daughter one afternoon; it didn't go as planned... It was very goopy and hard to roll into balls, so we did what we could and put it into the freezer. I have since then taken some out to bake and they are quite tasty; I just don't know if I would try again!

These are fantastic cookies. The bottoms got a little burnt so, I would suggest doing them for 10 mins. at 325 degrees instead of 350 degrees.

I've tried several cookie recipes to blend two of my favorite things (peanut butter and chocolate) and these are by far my favorite. The dough is a little sticky, but if you keep your hands wet, it is not hard at all to roll into balls.

The dough was crumbly and was difficult to make a ball out of it. They were strange, to the say least. Not the traditional peanutbuter cookie with the cross hatch design that I was shooting for. Ended up throwing out the whole batch.

I have made similar recipes before, and this one worked quite well. I omitted the chocolate chips, and used 24 splenda packets instead of sugar. I used twice the vanilla, natural peanut butter and added a bit (maybe 1/4 tsp) salt because my peanut butter was just peanuts. I baked for 9 minutes (still haven't figured out this crazy Swedish oven, sometimes it cooks like wildfire, other times it takes 3 times as long, but that's another story...) The dough tasted great, but once baked they were a bit sweet, will cut down the splenda next time and I think I will try with hazlenut butter. Oh, they did turn out rather crumbly...

Rating: 4
I would have given this three forks, but it gets brownie points for simplicity and being both dairy- and gluten-free! I like these both with smooth pb and with chunky, but in either case I think a little extra vanilla goes a long way. These cookies don't taste especially peanuty when they have chocolate chips in them, but as plain peanut butter cookies the nuttiness shines through a lot more--so they're sort of two recipes in one. I agree with some previous reviewers that they're better with reduced sugar (I use about 2-3 Tbsp less), plus I like to add about 1/4 tsp salt. They work perfectly with natural salted peanut butter, as long as you make sure the consistency of the peanut butter is similar to that of the, er, unnatural ones when it's at room temperature--if it's thinner or thicker that will change any recipe you put it in, and usually not for the better. VEGANS: 1 Tbsp packed ground flaxseed AND 1&1/2 tsp Ener-G powder combined with 1/4 cup water worked fabulously for the one egg in this recipe. That's sort of two egg sub recipes combined, but I find it often works well in cookie recipes.

Rating: 2
Decent, but a little dry and not all that much of a peanut butter taste. These cookies are so soft when removed from the oven that if you lift one to examine the bottom for golden color (per the recipe)they'll completely fall apart. Unfortunately, I interpreted this to mean that the cookies weren't ready, returned them to the oven for a few minutes more, and promptly burned the sheet. Second time around I baked for 10 minutes only, didn't look at the bottoms, and took it on faith they'd firm up sufficiently while cooling on the cookie sheets-they did. The recipe is at fault here-it should specifically have said this. This second sheet was better but still a little dry. I doubled all ingredients, used regular not mini chips, and a very generous tablespoon of dough for each cookie, which made it all the more surprising that the cookies were on the dry side. I also had to flatten the cookies somewhat halfway through baking because the cookie balls never spread out. I will try this one again because it's easy and seems to have potential, but next time I'll substitute sucralose (I prefer using it when I can)for part of the brown sugar and consider baking for only 8 or 9 minutes. If that doesn't result in a softer, less dry cookie I'm off to greener cookie pastures, so to speak.

well! i was debating between this PB recipe and (any) other, but the simplicity of this one won me over.. and good thing, too! i never really liked PB cookies - i usually find them too dry, salty and just not appealing in that cooked fashion. but these are fantastic! i found out the hard way that my cousin's oven is about 70-80 degrees off... so let's just say the first batch was undercooked (but yummy nonetheless) and the second was just right. used choc. chunks, extra crunchy PB, put batter in freezer between batches (as HK's "room temperature" is quite hot at this time of year), and did not have problems with spreading. did, however, have difficulty abstaining from cookie dough... and the cookies. this cookie is delicious, soft, and addictive, and altogether, very comforting. friends and family loved them. i am now a PB cookie fan.

You all are right! These cookies are OUTSTANDING! And so easy to make. Very rich and delicious. I also cut the sugar to 3/4 cup. I used a few more chips (could use more, I think). I used bigger chips (not minis). You should double the mix - this really only makes about 18 cookies at most (not 24). Also, I do not recommend baking them for 12 minutes! That's way too long (at least in my oven it is!). I baked them around 9-10 minutes (12 minutes burned them) - also they cool for 5 minutes so remember that they're still cooking then. So I recommend 10 minutes at most for baking time and then you can cool them for 3 mins on sheet before removing them to cool completely on a wrack. OUTSTANDING COOKIES!!!! Will make them again and again!

Now this a true peanut butter lovers cookie - forget those crunchy, grainy, criss-crossed peanut butter cookies! I was very impressed with how easy the cookies are to make, and they stored well (2 weeks) too! These will become a staple in my Christmas cookies portfolio. The only change I made in the recipe was that I used a tablespoon measuring spoon, dunked in lukewarm water every couple of cookies rather than my hands to form the cookies and place them on the cookie sheets. It was easier and less messy as I found myself juggling several cookie sheets at a time. A real winner!

I can't 'officially' rate these because I haven't made them and I won't - too much sugar. Try this recipe from my friend at Kraft: 1 cup Kraft Peanut butter (others won't work as well - trust me, I was a skeptic until I experimented), 1/2 cup sugar (white or brown), 1 egg. That's it, unless you want to add chocolate chips or a combination of white chocoalte chips and dried cranberries, which is my favorite. Enjoy!

Obviously not your typical peanut butter cookie recipe- it's a bit crumbly but has plenty of flavor. Combined the suggestion of others, used 2yolks 1T honey and 3/4c. br. sugar (regular sized chips). Found I had to flatten them out a bit 1/2 way through baking. Will make again but will try smaller "pop in your mouth" size so no crumbling.

Now these are peanut butter cookies! Very good recipe. I agree with the others below; reduce the amount of brown sugar to 3/4 cup. I didn't even try it at 1 cup because I tasted the dough after 3/4 and could tell that more sugar would be too much. I used Scharfenberger chocolate chips in these, and they were spectacular.

As a life-long cookie fanatic who now lives on a gluten-free diet, I have hated every recipe I've tried that uses non-gluten flours. What a wonderful thing to find a recipe for a cookie that requies NO flour at all. And its taste and texture are like a real cookie! These are heavenly. To me, the extra crunchy peanut butter is better all-around than creamy in this recipe. And I loved using bittersweet chocolate chips (regular, not mini).

I made these cookies for a guest who has sprue. Not only did he like them, he took home all the "extras". I had to remove them from the table because the other guests loved them, too, and would have finished them if I hadn't done so. They are delicate, though, before they cool. You must be sure to follow the directions not to touch them for a few minutes or they break apart. Once they are cool they're just like any other cookie.

mmmmmmmmmmmm. I used only 3/4 cup of brown sugar but did everything else verbatim and these cookies taste incredibily sinful. And they're as easy to make as it is to walk to the corner and get something half as good to satisfy my sweet tooth.

I made it to try something new and my friends loved it. I put in chopped up candies like mentioned and walnuts. The second time with almonds which i thought tasted better. They stay soft unlike many other cookies and are great to keep in the fridge to bake for a midnight treat. The only problme was that they were a bit sweet though.

I really liked these. They were pretty easy and had all the flavors I like. The only challenging thing was trying to keep the dough together when dropping it on the cookie sheet.

Rating: 3
So easy, and so good! After making the dough I realized I was out of vanilla extract. I left it out and the cookies were still great, but I think the vanilla would give it a great extra kick.

This recipe is just UNBELIEVABLE! I made this recipe one day (without the chocolate chips) because it was the only recipe I could find that contained ingredients I had on hand. I can't stress how easy this recipe is. I make it often with my two young kids and add stuff I have around the house (snicker bars, nutrageous bars etc) This recipe is FOR YOU if you want a quick and easy cookie that tastes great. As written, it yields only a dozen anmd a half cookies. I always triple recipe. I also use extra crunchy peanut butter and I triple the vanilla extract. These cookies are best if eaten in first few days (which is no problem in this house!

these cookies are really great!not the gourmet type but i couldn't care less-and so easy to prepare!best to make have them come out chewy-9 to 10 minutes works for me.try using creamy pb if you don't like nuts.also try making them smaller-about 30-40 per recipe.

I love these cookies. The batch is small and they are very quick to make. Have made them several times and have turn out each time. Stay soft for a day of so.

This is a family favorite. I prefer Jif in this recipe over skippy. When I only had creamy peanut butter I added chopped peanuts. When I didn't have mini chips I used regular. I've made them smaller and larger. The larger ones come out chewier. They are so easy to make it's almost sinful.

These were a hit at a recent family party. At Passover these will really be treasured, as finding anything without flour and using chocolate is limited. They were light, chocolatey, and moist. A hit with the food "panel" in our family...

After reading the "rave" reviews of this recipe, I decided to try it!! Now, after having made the cookies - I have no idea what all the fuss was about!! I found these cookies to be "nothing spectacular" - just ordinary!! I would never make these cookies again!!

Rating: 3
As a working mother of four, I appreciated the ease of this recipe...they were finished in under half an hour, including baking and clean up. Three-fork cookies should also taste good...and these do, with good flavor and a chewy texture. I used creamy peanut butter. Definitely don't bake over 10 minutes...and I think I will only add 1/2 a cup of chocolate chips next time. That would balance the peanut butter and chocolate flavor, I think. I wonder what peanut butter chips would be like?

After reading all of the rave reviews I was so excited to make these - I love peanut butter cookies! These were gross! I don't know what everyone is so excited about. I think this is the only recipe from Epicurious that I have ever made and disagreed with the majority on. What's up with this one? Try it if you like, but I would lower your expectations first.

Great reviews. Couldn't decide between these and Mom-Mom Freitch?? Used a rounded cup of peanut butter(Jif).Made half w/chocolate and half w/o. Cooked 10min. Stayed soft for a few days.

I made these for a charity bake sale, and they were a big hit. I was lucky to get any of them to the sale, and I kept eating them as each batch came out of the oven! These took just minutes to whip up, and these results are fabulous!

A snap to prepare and an amazing cookie taste. They do melt in your mouth! Mine also needed about 9-10 min in the oven. I'll make these again soon!

These cookies are so yummy! Definitly cook for less time if you want them chewier. I originally made the recipe for my roommate who is gluten intolerant (can't have flour or wheat products). She loved them! She'd been craving cookies and these are much better than the traditional gluten-free cookies.

Rating: 4
I love this recipe! The cookies are soft and chewy and easy to make. My children loved them! The next batch I make I will lower the temperature by 25 degrees because I have a convection oven and they came out a bit on the dark side. I only baked them for 10 minutes. It's a wonderful cookie to make that everyone just loves!!!

Rating: 3
I was a bit skeptical about this recipe mainly because there are so few ingredients. The cookies turned out to be really good and super easy to make. It took me all of 5 minutes to make the dough! The peanut butter and chocolate chip combination is perfect. I will definitely make these again!!

Rating: 4
These are fabulous cookies! They are so easy to put together (I use creamy peanut butter and mix all ingredients at same time). My son, 20, and his friends can't get enough of them. When they come over to our house they ask me to make them, so I make sure I have a steady supply on hand of all the ingredients. My son is already telling me I have to send "boxes" of these cookies down to San Diego next year when he and his friends move there. The cookies are an instant hit with everyone, any age!

Rating: 2
This is a good recipe for kids -- but just doesn't seem like an "adult" cookie. I didn't find them to be fabulous (I am a perfectionist, I have to admit). I have made regular peanut butter cookies that are soft and chewy and have a *much* better flavour and texture than this recipe. Would only make these again if I was baking with my little girl.

Rating: 4
OK, I have to weigh in on this one. These are execellent. They are not haute-cuisine, but they are very good and very easy. If you use a small ice-cream scoop, you don't even have to get your hands dirty dropping the cookies and you get exactly the right amount. Also, I have started adding some Skor Toffee bits with the chocolate chips and they are even better. I love peanut butter but don't like most peanut butter cookies because they are bland and dry, unlike these.

Rating: 3
As the mother of a celiac, I cannot tell you how much I appreciated this recipe. The cookies were outstanding, not just passable, as many gluten free recipes are. My son (30) was thrilled to be able to eat something scrumptious for a change. I think for those who thought the recipe was a flop, I think they must have done something wrong.

I've made this recipe so many times and always get requests for it. I'm allergic to eggs, and I LOVE peanut butter cookies, so I can enjoy these along with family and friends. This recipe has been a favorite with my customers (I'm a caterer), and I'd like to pass on some tips: use the BEST crunchy peanut butter and pure vanilla extract when making this recipe. Watch the baking time, and make small cookies, not large ones. I think you'll be impressed with the results.

Very disappointing. Flat, too chewy, not very flavorful.

Maybe I expected too much from this recipe, but I thought these cookies were just 'ok'. And I love peanut butter! I followed the recipe exactly, following the advice of others and baking for 10 minutes...but these really weren't anything special. They are quick, though.

This was a very easy and quick way to enjoy one our household favourites. Get ready for tremendous flavour and the need for more than one. They are very rich and they should be eaten once they are completely cool. You will want to make these again and again.

The chief appeal of this recipe is its ease - if I am going to go to the trouble of making cookies, I want something that tastes special, and this just doesn't do it for me.

I thought they were pretty good for a flourless PB cookie, even though I used smooth PB and regular (sized) chips since that is what I had on hand. Both kids liked them. Don't overcook. A really good option for those on a wheat-free diet.

These cookies just melt in your mouth! Although you can't eat too many at once because they are so sweet (just makes them last that much longer)! Quite a few people have asked me to make them again and again but if I make them I can't seem to keep them around to give them to anyone else! For those chocoholics, these are good with chocolate drizzled over them!

Super easy and everyone loved them. Next time I will bake them for 10 minutes and see how that turns out. However, I only got 13 out of the whole batch. Also used creamy peanut butter.

You have to adjust your expectations when making this recipe. It's not a time consuming recipe and it doesn't taste like one. But for something sweet and quick, you can't beat it.

Wow! I think this is my first try making peanut butter cookies, and these were delicious - and easy. I took one pan out of the oven after 12 minutes so I had a chewy batch, and one pan stayed in for another few minutes so I had a crispy batch. I keep "sampling" them to see which one I prefer... yum yum

Okay...there must be something wrong with me, but I didn't think these were all that great. Yes, they were good, and they were certainly sweet. They just weren't cookie-like to me - too much like peanut butter fudge. I need flour in a cookie!

This recipe tastes GREAT and is so easy to make. The first time I made the cookies, I looked at the batter and thought I had done something very wrong. But no I didn't, and they came out great. I have found that cooking them for a bit less than the recommended baking time works quite well. They stay nice and gooey.

My housemate is gluten intolerant so I couldn't wait to try these cookies. This recipe should go into a gluten-free cookbook. We both liked them alot. They were easy to make. I used large chocolate chips since I didn't have mini ones. I will make these again and soon.

I made these as bar cookies for a potluck dinner. They are very easy to make, and I would make them again. They are more like candy than cookies--extremely sweet, which is great if you have a sweet tooth (like I do). The recipe makes a very small quantity. I made a double batch and ended up with just enough to take to the dinner.

This recipe was sooo good. It tastes like a Reeses Peanut Butter Cup. Also very easy to make and took very little time. I only baked mine for 9-10 minutes, any longer and they would have been too crispy.

This is the first peanut butter cookie that I have made that wasn't dry and crumbly. I didn't have the chocolate chips, but didn't miss them. This was a very fast recipe to put together and I will certainly make this as often as we run out of the bach we just ate.

Excellent but a little too rich for me but others thought they were the best peanut butter cookies ever. Mine took over 12 minutes to cook but I did not flatten the ball and they cook perfectly.

I made these as bars instead of cookies - put the batter in a 9 inch square pan and cooked for 20 minutes. So so easy and good if you like the combination of peanut butter and chocolate. I'd make them again simply because its about the easiest dessert I've ever made and its a crowd pleaser.

Rating: 3
Really good--but very sweet and rich. Check the cookies before 12 minutes is up--I cooked both sheets at once and the batch on the top was done in 8 minutes. Very easy, and a great way to use up the cheap generic-brand peanut butter we had sitting in our cabinets.

Rating: 4
Personally, I think this recipe is amazing. It took absolutely no time at all to make and I think the cookies tasted better than any I've had in a long time. They actually stay chewy after they have cooled off and the crunch peanut butter/choc. chip combo is of course fantastic. Perfect anytime, but super convenient if you're in a hurry!

I wanted to bake a "thank you" for someone in my office who is allergic to both gluten and egg yolk - and was searching for a flourless cookie recipe, one which I could alter to remove egg yolks as well (I substituted the whites of two large eggs). The best points not only include the ease of preparation and cooking, but the fact that the ingredients are so basic, I always have them in my kitchen so I can whip these up at the last minute. I made half with and half without chocolate, both are delicious!

A wonderfully surprising recipe! I thought they were easy to prepare, and they came out looking beautiful -- nice even color and perfectly round appearance. (I used an air-insulated baking sheet.) A coworker was amazed that it was a flourless cookie, and immediately requested the recipe! They came out tender and delicious -- I will definitely be making this recipe again. (I used Jif Extra Chunky peanut butter in my batch, and it worked well -- the oil didn't separate out.)

I made these to take to a Passover dinner at our friends house and they were very well received. We all thought that if you didn't know they were flourless you would not guess. I used natural peanut butter and cane sugar instead of brown sugar and they were very hearty. Did not think they were that light at all, but might be the ingredients I used. My oven also bakes fast, so I only baked them for 10 min.

When I made this recipe, I wasn't sure how it would turn out, but I have to say, for someone who is not crazy about peanut butter cookies, I ate half the batch! My 18-month old son, my husband and co-workers also loved them. One thing I did differently, though, I doubled the recipe and used 1 cup crunchy and 1 cup creamy peanut butter. Either way, though, these are great cookies.

These are my latest favorite cookie. They were incredibly easy to make. I cooked one batch for slightly less time and they tasted like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups.

HELP! New baker here. My cookies came out totally flat & toffee-like (although they tasted pretty good). They just started collapsing in the oven after about 8 minutes. Afterwards, I checked my baking soda and discovered it had expired. Would this have made the crucial difference?

As other reviewers noted, the chocolate chips are hard to incorporate, so much so that the natural oil in the peanut butter separated in my first batch. Next time I would ignore the directions and add all ingedients at once. The cookies cook well on baking paper.
