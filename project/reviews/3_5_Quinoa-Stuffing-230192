PS - this year I mixed red and white quinoa, and it was great. The red quinoa technically requires a longer cooking time, but I cooked both together. It was visually very pretty, and the red quinoa stayed chewier and made for a better texture

I've made this for Thanksgiving every year since I saw it in Self. Good hot or room temp, so great for family get togethers, great leftovers (I bake acorn squash halves, stuff w/quinoa stuffing and a little cheese for 10 min). Modifications: I think the apricots and cranberries make it too sweet, so I omit apricots and half the cranberries. I also sometimes add nuts (walnuts or pecans). I also up the lemon juice. Highly recommended.

So I just finished stuffing my self silly with this goodness. I didn't have cranberries on hand so I used currants and it was still delish. I did it for my Thanksgiving main course along with cardamom roasted carrots and the green bean recipe with dried shallot and cherries (also on epi). Perfect. I baked up some stuffed apples for dessert. Highly recommend.

I served this for Easter dinner, with rave reviews. It worked exceptionally well as a main meal salad for vegetarians, and a side dish for the meat eaters. I found that the leftovers required some additional lemon juice and mint to keep the flavors lively. Overall, a great dish. I am sure this will become a holiday staple.

I am confused about the terminology. It is called stuffing, and so I'd imagined that one stuffs it into the cavity of the turkey, yet most reviewers serve it as a side. Is the recipe complete as is - that is the squash etc is completely cooked, or is it baked in a dish along with the main course?

YUM! I made this stuffing exactly as written, except that I toasted the quinoa first. It was absolutely fantastic! I have been gluten-free for almost 4 years and it felt so good to have such an outstanding gluten-free and healthy alternative stuffing on the Thanksgiving table this year! Everyone loved it!

I wanted to have some decent vegetarian dishes to complement the standards on my Thanksgiving table. For the most part, I followed the recipe, though I left out the mint. Next time I'll leave out the zucchini--it didn't add much but some bitterness. I think I'll add some nuts, maybe pecans. Overall, a good recipe that's easy to adapt to ingredients on hand.

Really delicious and a nice combination of flavours and textures. I made the quinoa with chicken stock and used thyme instead of bay leaves. I added the roasted seeds from the butternut squash right before serving along with the chopped herbs. Served with a chicken, roasted stuffed with an onion and fresh thyme and rosemary. Yum. Froze the leftovers, and have high hopes they'll be as good later.

I decided to make this dish for Thanksgiving this year, and what a great dish it was! My husband agreed that it was the best side on the table. Changes I made: I cooked the quinoa with 2 sprigs fresh thyme, instead of bay leaves, omitted the butternut squash, and sauteed onion and celery with the zucchini. I also omitted the mint, and only used a handful of scallions, rather than a whole bunch. It was delicious! I will definitely make this again, and soon! We loved it!

My sister-in-law is allergic to wheat and it is always difficult to put together a Thanksgiving dinner that she can eat and everyone else can really enjoy. This seemed a perfect fit, so I tried it last night. I did most of the chopping and dicing the night before, so it only took about 30 minutes to pull together at mealtime. It was fantastic. Not only was it really flavorful, but it made for a beautiful presentation with all the different textures and colors. Even my father, who can be rather finiky thought it was delicious. I will defintely be adding this to my regular Thanksgiving menu.

Made this as a side dish for grilled salmon this Easter - it was fabulous! I dumbed it down a little, as we didn't have all ingredients handy. Cooked quinoa in chicken stock and added raisins, butternut squash, parsley, sauteed onions, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Even with such sparse ingredients, it was flavorful, colorful, and delicious. Will deifnitely made this again. And now everyone in my family knows what "quinoa" is...and how to pronounce it!

What a wonderful treat! I normally do not rate recipes, but this one is worthy. The butternut squash and the cranberies work very well together to satisfy the taste buds. I did not use mint in mine because my budget is limited and can only buy those fresh herbs that I will use a lot. Great fall side dish! Be careful it can be addictive.
