A bit more mild than I expected. Using it in fish tacos the flavor got lost a little bit. Nice subtle flavors.

This was exactly as the other reviewers have described -- very simple and surprisingly very delicious. I doubled the sauce amount and would definitely recommend doing this. I also added some green onions -- sauteed the whites for a few minutes between cooking the fish and adding the ginger/garlic; then added the green part of the onion at the end. It was a terrific addition. I think this sauce would also work well with other white fish and even chicken.

Fast and delicious! I thought the vinegar/soy sauce would be overwhelming but it blended nicely with the pan juices. Absolutely need to use a nonstick skillet, otherwise the pan juices won't be there and it could taste too salty.

Easy and delicious. Used 8oz sea bass filets (no flour, just salt and pepper) and cooked according to recipe directions. Didn't have hot sesame oil, so added chili flakes to the sauce instead. It's a keeper!

Delicious! I was skeptical based on the ingredients (thought the vinegar might be overpowering) but the flavors complemented the fish perfectly.

Surprisingly tasty sauce for only a few ingredients. Tried it on mahi mahi and second time didn't even saute the garlic and ginger, just added all the ingredients together.

Sauce is surprising good, and only a few ingredients. Second time I made it I didn't even saute the garlic and ginger, put added all the ingredients together.

My fiancée and I loved this recipe. I had to use halibut as a last minute substitution for the sea bass and it was still amazing. I added extra garlic and I also doubled the sauce - I'm not quite sure how you would have enough sauce for the fish if you do not double it. I paired it up with some Jasmine rice and a small watercress salad with some snap peas and a sesame dressing - it was fantastic! It's definitely a keeper.

I was very impressed with this recipe, surprised even. The pan sauce was absolutely delicious. Who would have thought that 3 ingredients could come together so well. This will definitely become one of my go-to favorites. Next, I think I'll try the oriental sauce over grilled chicken.

Well, we were a bit dissapointed after all the great reviews. It was good, but not out of this world. I would suggest cooking the fish on a slightly lower temp, though.

The sea bass was delicious, but there was not enough Oriental in the sauce. Mysterious!

I've used the sauce with other fish (cod, haddock) and I always double the sauce. Nice easy dish to prepare. You can add some of the sauce to sauteed green beans as well..

We make this recipe all the time and love it! This may be gauche, but it seems good with just about any fish, including good ole' reliable salmon fillets. I have to double the sauce because, even with the heat off, the sauce evaporates very quickly. It's quick and easy enough to make after work, even for an amateur like myself!

Made with Chilean Sea Bass - so expensive but SO worth it! This is a fabulous recipe, and very quick and easy too.

Very simply, a good recipe for Asian style fish. Serve each portion with a rice timbale and a green vegetable for a great presentation.

This was delicious and quick! I substituted red snapper for the sea bass and it worked perfectly. My BF, not a huge fish-lover, loved it and has requested that I make it again.

YUMMY! I love sea bass and this was an easy and impressive way to make it. I used chili oil and sesame oil too as someone suggested. IT was great! And I added some fresh scallion as a garnish after it was done and it made a great presentation. I served it with roasted asparagus with a touch of soy and sesame oil..and some jasmine rice. YUM

My husband said that this was one of the best sea bass recipes he has ever tasted. The thickness of the sea bass required cooking longer than four minutes a side. Just use your own judgement. I did not have fresh cilantro, so I used dried. Next time I will use fresh, but it was great anyway.

Easy and delicious recipe. I didn't have hot sesame oil, so I mixed chili oil with regular sesame oil and it was great. I also sprinkled some black sesame seeds on top (nice contrast with the white of the sea bass) and some thinly sliced green onion. As an accompaniment, I sauteed some garlic in a bit of oil, added fresh baby spinach and a bit of rice wine and cooked the spinach till just wilted. I then plated the fish and sauce on top. Very elegant presentation and very tasty!

My husband and I enjoyed this dish very much. I didn't have peanut oil, so I substituted sesame oil. I served it with jasmine rice and a saute of Chinese veges. It is incredibly fast and easy to prepare. We'll definitely make it again.

This is a great receipe. Easy, yet the sauce contains complex flavors. Excellent.

Among the best fish dishes I have had. Of course, it helped that the snapper I bought was prime quality, but what an excellent complement of flavors to a savory whitefish. You can't leave out the hot sesame oil. There's the zing! ...If I had to eat this fish every night for a month, I would be very happy.
