Delicious! Followed another reviewer's advice and made with a heart-shaped cookie cutter for Vday. Wontons held together just fine and crisped up beautifully. My guy managed to make three comments between bites: "oh my god." "you're making these again, right?" and "it's like...a gourmet restaurant!" critiquing ability aside, these were a fantastic end to a meal; flavorful, but light enough that you didn't feel weighed down after eating. One thing, I made the custard the day before and served it cold with the raviolis. I would recommend making the custard at the same time and serving while it's warm and more liquidy.

This is excellent and so easy to make.

AMAZING...I made these for Valentine's day, used a heart shaped cutter. They were beautiful and delicious. You can't mess them up. I think this ia a great way to use up those overly riped bananas you have on hand. Only recommendation is to use less of the brown sugar since the grahm crackers already sweeten them. I serve them vanilla ice cream, always a hit. I'm making them again tonight.

I think this may be the tastiest dessert I have ever made (and I make a lot of desserts!) This is divine!

WILDLY successful! I made a double-batch of these and brought them into work today, and people were coming from other departments to taste them, word had spread so wide. It's a pretty easy recipe. The wontons can be a little tricky to seal, but I realized once they hit the oil, the edges hardened right up, so there wasn't enough time for them to open and spill the filling out. The egg dries up quickly, though, so I'd brush a couple at a time, fill them, and repeat. I used a large, deep pot to fry them in, and that was pretty quick and easy - I'd thought the frying would be the tricky part. Anyway, this is a fantastic, unusual recipe. I'm planning on making them for Thanksgiving and again for Christmas (if not other times in- between, too!)

I made this dessert for some residents at work and it got rave reviews. I left out the pecans and added a teaspoon of banana extract to the custard. Awesome. A few people like their plates!! One note: serve hot for best bite, but still tasty cool.

This is the type of dessert that you take your first bite and a smile comes over your face.....delicious!! I didn't have walnuts, so I just used pecans and it was wonderful. The custard sauce is a must - we all wanted to lick our plates!

So stinkin' easy and so stinkin' good. This sauce was so creamy, light and flavorful. It was like a party in my mouth and it went so great with the banana ravioli's, which were also so amazing and easy to make. You have got to try them together!!! It's such a fun and different dessert to have when company is over.

Made this for my feller's birthday... he LOVED them. Great presentation, without a lot of work. Excellent. Will definitely make again. Perhaps with cinnamon added next time.

Such a wonderful and easy recipe that is a HUGE hit! I doubled the recipe, used the small square ravioli wraps and used the egg roll style. Each was about 2 inches long. Definitely need to deep fry them long enough, mine were in the fryer for 2-3 minutes to keep them from being too chewy. I arranged them on a square plate, drizzled chocolate over them and dusted powdered sugar on top. Served with vanilla/mango ice cream. Just too easy to do, LOVE this recipe. :)

Absolutely delicious. The whole family marvelled.

Unbelievable! The ravioli's were so good. I rarely rate a recipe with a four, but I want to make these again tonight. I followed another reviewer's advice, and rolled them up "egg roll" style" instead of making the ravioli, because I made a thai dinner and I wanted to follow the theme. The ravioli/dumpling wrappers definitely work the best. It would have been to doughy if the egg roll wrappers would have been used. The filling seemed a little too sweet, so I added a little more chopped banana to even out the flavor. I am so impressed with these. The vanilla custard sauce was a wonderful addition. I put the custard over the wrappers, and swirled some caramel sauce over it. The presentation was easy and perfect.

I really liked these - eaten (without the custard) after having way too much chocolate (Easter!) they were lovely and not too sweet. A couple of subsitutes: malt biscuits/cookies for the graham crackers (we don't have graham crackers in Australia), almonds instead of pecans, and gowgee wrappers (white not yellow (egg) based wonton wrappers). Will definitely make again and serve with the custard and add a chocolate sauce. I'd also like to try to make my own egg pasta for the wrappers - but since they tasted so good without the extra effort it will be a rainy day project only! Otherwise they are relatively quick and easy using bought wrappers.

Sooooo easy and soooo good. They're great with the custard, and very easy to serve to guests. Just prepare everything before and fry them up whenever it's time for dessert! They are so simple and have a great presentation. They're great for garnishing with a few berries or really nice chocolate.

is there anyway i can bake this instead of frying them? If so, what temp??

This was so easy to prepare. I played around with the wonton wrappers and found that twisting the top like a dumpling was the easiest.

I had a lot of leftover wonton wrappers and was looking for a way to use it up. This dish is perfect, easy to make and delicious!! I didn't have brown sugar, so I just used regular white sugar, I also used chopped dry roasted peanuts instead. It still turned out great. Would definitely make this again!!

Simple and Delicious. I have a lot of fun with this dessert. The last time I served these I made them egg-roll shaped and served two per person with alternating ribbons of the creme sauce and my own chocolate sauce and a light dusting of powdered sugar. Soooo easy, soooo good.

this is a stunning dish and once you have it down you can make so many changes , may i suggest adding strawberrys to the custard !

My friends liked this so much that I went back to the kitchen to make more! Served this with good vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. Huge success and very easy to make. I tried drizzling with a bit of chocolate and caramel (just a tad) and sprinkly toasted bits of almonds on top and it was gone in 5 mns :)

Definately "a dish beyond compare"! I covered the plate with the sauce then placed the ravioli on top. Finished it off with the suggestion of a melted chacolate drizzle. Fabulous presentation and a big hit!

This simple dessert ALWAYS gets absolute rave reviews. I drizzle the sauce over the ravioli and drizzle a bit of semi sweet chocolate as well. It makes an awesome presentation and it's a fabulous combination of flavors. It looks like you spent hours on it!

Instead of powdered sugar, I topped with sugared sliced almonds; gave it an extra texture and taste. I swirled swirled chocolate sauce on one side of the plate and vanilla custard on the other placing the raviolis on top. Very nice

I couldn't find wonton wrappers so I used phyllo dough instead and didn't need the egg for basting. It was much heavier, though still delicious. The sauce is a must.

This is a wonderful, unusual dessert. I prepared the custard sauce a day in advance and the dumplings about 4 hours in advance. Definately do a test run on these to get the heat and cooking time down (don't cook them until they're brown--they'll continue to cook when you take them out of the oil) Testing, as well as using thin won ton wrappers (for those unable to make your own skins) will eliminate problems with texture. (thanks for the heads-up on thickness from the cook from New York!) Use this to fill strudel and dust with confectioners sugar and drizzle with fine chocolate. Serve the custard on the side. Use filling in dessert egg rolls using phillo dough...use cinnamon! :)

This dish is easy and such an impressive presentation. I did not find the wonton skins chewy, if you buy the skins be aware that there are different thicknesses. I used the thinest and it was great. The vanilla custard sauce is unbelievably good. I would make this dish again.

Rating: 4
Delicious! and very simple! However, I do feel that the wonton wrappers were too thick and chewy. I'll have to try the pastry shells. Also, I may have overstuffed because it didn't make nearly as much as the recipe had stated. But, this one is a keeper and a must try if you haven't!

I was having 8 for dinner, so I doubled this, thinking I would have some leftover...NOT! My guests were P-I-G, Hogs on this one! Can't say I blame them...this is one of those desserts that is "almost as good as sex", especially the sauce! I strained the sauce twice, once through a regular strainer, then again through a fine mesh one. It was pure velvet. I also used vanilla extract...I'm not sure how much, I just tasted, poured, tasted, then "purred"! Wow! I added some cinnamon to the fillng...mmmm! I also made these ahead, then just reheated in oven before serving. Perfect! Reminds me of Bananas Foster in a finger-food package. Hey, Epicurious, keep ones like this comming!

If this is heaven, dying might not be so bad. This recipe, especially the vanilla custard sauce, has taken me to the heights of culinary ecstacy! It's a craver.....can't get enough. The raviolis are fantastic reheated.....simple in the toaster oven. They stay very crisp. On their own, they're great, but that vanilla sauce does me in......

Excellent! Easy, delicious and elegant! The sauce is to die for! Also tried apple and it was great.

Followed another poster's suggestion and used puff pastry shells. Baked them first, then filled them; returned to the oven for another 5 minutes. Nice and easy with a great presentation. The sauce is a must.

I purchased wonton wrappers for the first time today and made this recipe...what a deserving first use! I omitted the nuts, as I'm not wild about them in any recipe, and instead of the vanilla cream sauce (if I had whipping cream on hand, I would have made it), I mixed chunky peanut butter, milk, honey and some of the filling in a small saucepan until it was blended, then let it cool a bit and used it as a dipping sauce. Another guilty secret - I deep fried the wontons in peanut oil. Won raves from my husband, and from me!

I made this as a dessert accompaniment for a dinner party. It was a hit! And my family members are very critical when it comes to food. The custard sauce is a must. It makes all the difference and is easy to make.

the problem was the texture of the wonton wrapper - too thick and chewy. should specify that the skin of the wrapper should be as thin as possible - almost like that of filo pastry. the filling should be thicker, with more banana. the custard sauce was good though.

While my cooking club liked this dish, I would say the ravioli itself wasn't anything special. However, dip it into the vanilla custard sauce and WOW. Definitely worth a try. -KilroyIL

This was incredible!! My room-mate has already placed an order for when her honey comes to visit from Georgia. Considering the decadence, it's an easy dish to make. Can't wait to make it again! I used vanilla extract instead of a vanilla bean in the sauce and it was still wonderful.

Excellent and impressive. I also decorated with some fresh raspberry puree (mixed with chambord). Definitely perfect for an elegant dinner party!

I make this all the time - with one change. Instead of using wonton wrappers and frying it I put the filling the pre-made phyllo cups from the freezer section. It is a fast and easy dessert and everyone loves it!

The ravioli are superb!! The sauce is incredible.Fixed them for a chef who was dining at my home and he thought the ravioli was delicious!!I have made several times since and get raving reviews everytime.I do like adding more banana to the recipe.Then when I sprinkle powder sugar over them I also add a bit of cinnamon.Adds a nice touch!!

The custard sauce is excellent, I'll definately make that again. The ravioli left something to be desired, however. I couldn't find wonton wrappers and used egg roll wrappers instead but these were a bit too heavy and chewy when deep fried. If faced with the same problem, I would try phyllo pastry, baked not fried, and maybe add some whip cream to lighten up the custard? Just a thought....

I made this recipe for a recipe exchange group. It was a huge hit! Many of them have made it for their own guests. I have since made it 4 times and have been asked for the recipe everytime. Great for parties as a finger dessert. You could even dress this one up beautifully for and elegant sit down dessert. Very versatile.

We loved this recipe! Very sweet and the custard sauce is to die for. I put my guests to work filling the ravioli which was a lot of fun. Definitely one to make again.
