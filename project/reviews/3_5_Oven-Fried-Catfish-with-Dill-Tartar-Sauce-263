I combined this recipe with the one for Spicy Blacked Catfish elsewhere on this site. I added the "Spicey Blackened" seasonings to my breadcrumbs. First coated the fish in the spicy breadcrumbs, then turned in the butter\olive oil. Coated once again with the spicy breadcrumbs, and baked as directed. I have my own fabulous tarter sauce recipie that does not involve "relish"....UGH. Will try to post it elsewhere,

I was just looking for a tartar sauce recipe and ended up making the entire recipe. Based on other reviews I added some homemade Emril "essence" to the breadcrumbs and the tartar sauce as well. Will definitely be making again and will try the other suggestions- higher oven temp (maybe in preheated cast iron pan-but clean-up on parchment is so easy), blend of butter & olive oil, blend of bread crumbs and corn meal, some Old Bay and paprika and a touch of lemon juice in the tartar sauce and maby a substitution of dill relish for at least part of the pickle relish.

I searched up this recipe at 3:45 p.m. in absolute freak mode over what to have for supper at 5. I did not have time to do the tartar sauce. The fish was delicious. I'll try some of the modifications suggested here next time.

The dill tartar sauce was excellent!

I added Cajun seasoning (about 2 Tbsp) and doubled the recipe for the crumbs and 1.3 lbs. of catfish for 4 people. I also added the zest of 1 lemon, and 1/4 cup of freshly grated Parmesan cheese. I also added the Cajun tartar sauce from the fried Cajun catfish recipe...it was outstanding.

I thought this dish turned out very well but, I too, made some changes. I added grated parmesan cheese and grated lemon zest to the bread crumbs along with salt, pepper and cumin. I used olive oil instead of butter. It sounds like it might taste a little bland without the additions.

Trying to avoid frying so looking for alternative cooking methods. Didn't dip in butter but sprayed with cooking spray. Next time would boost the breadcrumbs and cheese with Old Bay, garlic, cayenne or whatever.

Bland, soggy and pale. I admit the filet was the thicker portion near the head which probably had something to do with it. I am trying it again with cod in an iron skillet tonite. We'll see what happens.

That was just amazingly tasty. My parrot and I savored every last morsel. I dipped mine in half butter, half olive oil, and Italian breadcrumbs mixed with grated parmesan. For seasoning I used Garlic pepper and a flavor enhancing salt. And the sauce was real good too, and I'm not crazy about tartar sauce. I added a few drops of fresh lemon juice to the sauce as another reviewer suggested to enhance the flavor. So quick and easy.

Next time I will double the sauce. We liked this a lot, and oven baking means that you don't have to worry about the filets breaking up.

I love this recipe. I've made this many, many times over the last couple years. This is the only way we "fry" catfish now. I will be making this tonight, as a matter of fact. Not being a fan of tartar sauce, I've not tried making it and therefore cannot comment.

I have not made this recipe yet; however, use catfish. Do not substitute orange roughy. According to environmentaldefense.org - a reliable source, "(they) are extremely long-lived and mature at a very slow rate. Intensive exploitation in past decades has greatly decreased populations. Management in New Zealand and Australia is good, but unregulated landings by other countries continue."

Excellent. Also added parmesan cheese to breadcrumbs. Used half butter and half olive oil for dipping fish. Kept it plain for the kids and added cajun spices for my husband and myself. Tartar sauce was great but the fish didn't even need it. Used the leftover tartar sauce with canned tuna for a sandwich the next day...very tasty.

The fish was darned good. Next time I will use oil instead of butter and I'll season the breadcrumbs with Tony Chachere's and it will be that much better. We thought the tartar sauce needed help and preferred the red sauce I made with lots of horseradish and Tabasco.

I don't do well cooking fish, but this turned out perfect. I did sprinkle with Hungarian paprika to give it a bit more zest and color.

My kids will eat 4 pieces of catfish with this recipe! It has become a family standard. It is flaky, flavorful, great with the tarter sauce and a meal my kids request over and over.

I didn't rate it since I only used the tartar sauce. It is delicious.

I give the fish a '2', and the tartar sauce a '3'. The bread coating wasn't too interesting, even after I added cajun spice, parsley, and garlic powder. Maybe it's because I used frozen filet of sole, instead of fresh. The tartar sauce was too mellow, so I added a few drops of lemon juice. Altogether, somewhat disappointing.

Made the fish only. I used a higher oven temp. and preheated my cast iron pan. I used half breadcrumbs and half cornmeal and added cajun spice. After removing from the oven, I flipped the fish for a minute or two in the still-hot pan to crisp the top side. Very tasty! Even fish-wary hubby said, 'Yum!'

As catfish is relatively expensive in Seattle, I made this with Cod. I mixed the breadcrumbs with some seasoned cornmeal fish fry breading I found at the store. It turned out great, and the tarter sauce is amazing. This is my new regular fish recipe.

I upped the oven temperature to 500 degrees - worked much better. This was a very tasty dish. I have also made it with Orange Roughy which also worked well. Would highly recommend with only the temperature change.

This is such a simple way to prepare catfish and it tastes wonderful. It also contains one of the best tartar sauce recipes I've ever made. I will definitely make it again!

I made this last night and it was fabulous! I'm not a big fan of fried foods but this was not greasy and very crispy. I used red snapper fillets because that's what looked good at the market, and I used Ritz cracker crumbs since I didn't have breadcrumbs. Added cajun spice mix as seasoning like many others did. A smash hit!

Excellent! I made this recipe using talapia instead of catfish and got rave reviews from my husband. This is definitely a "keeper". I used dill relish in the tartar sauce instead of sweet and loved it, but that's just a personal preference.

This recipe is quick, easy and delicious. We cook it in a cast iron pan. We've made this many times for ourselves and for guests. Our guests have been suprised how simple the recipe was. I've not tried the tartar sauce.

Yuck!! What a way to ruin a nice piece of fish! I usually make catfish the tried and true way by soaking in milk, coating with seasoned cornmeal and frying till very browned and crisp on the outside (due to the moistness of the fish, it doesn't dry out inside). But I didn't want to tend to a frypan, so I tried this method. What I got was soggy, bland breading, even with the oven turned up high. Thumbs down form all family members. And with the butter used in the recipe, I can't even say the fat content was better than frying. I think the people who liked this recipe are those who suffer from fear of frying.

This recipe is DELICIOUS! I made it on a Friday evening for a group of friends and we ended up not going out because we all ate too much! I added parsley, cajun seasoning, Old Bay seasoning & extra coarse ground black pepper to the breadcrumbs. Cast iron skillet - 500F - 12 minutes...PERFECT!

Well I did not have any breadcrumbs so I made some cracker crumbs, mixed in some parsley, a bit of grated lemon rine, and as I am low fat, olive oil spray with just a tablespoon of olive oil, and I used a nonstick skilet....my husband who is not a catfish fan, loved this.

I thought this oven fried catfish recipe was better than any oil fried recipe I've ever tasted! I sprayed my black iron skillet with an olive oil spray and heated it in the oven at 500 while I prepared the fish. The end result was a delicious, crispy coating with moist flesh. Perfect! (Didn't try the tartar sauce - will do so next time.)

The catfish was thicker than normal so I cooked it longer until it started to flake. I also used homemade breadcrumbs & cajun seasoning.

So easy and sooo delicious. I baked at 500 degrees as some others recommended and it was perfect. I served with a pineapple-apricot salsa which complimented it wonderfully.

This recipe is EXCELLENT!!! Can't rave about it enough. Make sure to have your oven really hot. Make sure to buy really fresh fish.

The keys to this recipe are fresh bread crumbs from interesting bread (I used several types), a hot oven, and freshly made mayonnaise. Do not overcook the fish! It was very well received. I served the fish over fresh greens tossed in grapeseed oil, coarse salt and freshly cracked pepper; the perfect complement.

Very good - quick and very easy! We would definitely make this again.

I have used a similar recipe for Lingcod. The only difference is that I set my oven to 500 degrees, instead of 450. A feature in my local newspaper had interviewed a chef on oven frying. He stated that it was very important to have your oven very hot, else the oven fry would not turn out so good.

This recipe sounded delicious but was disappointing. The fish came out very mushy. I followed the recipe exactly so I'm not sure what went wrong! Maybe the brand of bread crumbs is to blame???

The addition of some grated parmasan cheese to the breadcrumbs made it extra special!

Fast, easy, and tasty. A quick mixed green salad with tomatoes and olives, steamed Jasmine rice, and a lovely Johannesberg Reisling make this a meal to savor and love with less than 45 minutes total prep time. Great for unannounced dinner guests. Great anytime! I really like it.

This recipe was excellent. Here in the south, everything (especially catfish) has to be fried. This was a wonderful, non-greasy dish. I added a few green onions in the dill tartar sauce and it was delicious!

This was the best catfish recipe I've ever used. The catfish was moist and tender, without being at all greasy. The tarter sauce was fabulous as well.
