I made this just as the recipe dictates, and it was quite good. I had Tuscan kale from the farmer's market so I used it. My husband was skeptical of the cranberries until he tried it, and claimed it quite good. I'm a bit of a purist when it comes to in-season vegetables -- the simpler the better. This recipe fits the bill perfectly.

This was a tasty and quick way to make kale. I seemed to be swamped with it from my CSA. Will make again.

I wanted to try this recipe but I forgot to get the cramberries. I used instead organis black dried figs instead. It came out really good.I used the russian red kale and I had my russian friend over for dinner and he loved it!

I have to agree with tcnoble's review. And I do like kale, just not like this.

I'm generally not a fan of kale because it's so bitter. But as a member of a CSA, I received a couple of deliveries this summer that included kale. I was determined to find a kale recipe that I actually liked, and this was it. The bitterness of the kale was definitely offset by the sweet/sour flavor of the dried cranberries. I thought this was surprisingly delicious.

Except for lowering the salt and raising the cranberries - I made this recipe exactly as it was called for Thanksgiving. This is really nice dish. The kale was not bitter, and the garlic and cranberries paired well together - and I don't usually like fruit in my food

This recipe confirmed my feelings for sauteed kale, it usually remains too tough to be thoroughly enjoyed. In my opinion, the garlic does not combine well with kale and cranberries, it seems to bring out the harshest metallic and salty notes present in these two ingredients. As for kale, I'll try and stick to using it in soups. Please do check out the recipe for Swiss Chard with Raisins and Almonds, from the same author, it is fantastic.

The cranberries compliment the kale nicely. I added onions for extra flavor.

This was a great side dish at our Thanksgiving feast. It was easy to make at the last minute if you prep the kale the day before. Just steamed it with some balsamic vinegar and a dash of liquid smoke with the cranberries and garlic. it will definately become a regular around our house.

Really nice flavour, quick and easy. Would you think that it would also work with spinach?
