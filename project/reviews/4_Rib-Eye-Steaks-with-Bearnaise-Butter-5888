I think the Texan is trying to be funny. At least I hope so. Back to the recipe - it's fine for quick and easy but if I'm going to eat all those fat grams, I'd rather have a real bearnaise sauce.

To the cook from Beaumont TX You are so busy being in love with yourself that you didn't even realize that you didn't make THIS recipe, you made something entirely different. You should put your Texan pride aside & try it. You might just like it!

I had this years ago in a french bistro when I lived in New Orelans, except they served it with a petit filet. The bearnaise butter was the ONLY reason I returned to that bistro. I don't think I have a reason to return now that I know how to make it, LOL.

Great quick meal in itself!

GREAT workaround to disaster-prone bearnaise sauce. Was delicious over pepper crusted filets on the BBQ. I made the mistake of slicing the butter out of the freezer and the discs didn't melt so nicely....let come to room temp (or just fridge temp). I might try adding a squeeze of lemon.

This was fantastic!!! I did BBQ the meat and put the butter on right off the grill. I also put the butter mix in the freezer for about 10 minutes.....makes it easier to "roll".

The Butter is fantastic! It now has become a staple in my refrigerator. It keeps much longer than the recipe states, and is great over practically all grilled meats & wonderful on Asparagus or Green Beans. On those week day nights when your in a hurry, the addition of a tbs. of this butter makes dishes taste like you worked much harder that you did. (every Chef needs his secret!)

Bill, You should think about anger management therapy. Why call a stranger a loser for not being the chef extraordinaire you must be to be so vehemently rude. Just a thought.

Doesn't the loser from Westwood realize that thick steaks can be finished in the oven?

This was the best steak I've ever made. If concerned about the extra calories because of the butter, we found that you can use less on each steak and still get excellent flavor. I'm going to try freezing the remaining butter for another time.

This was absolutely delicious!!!!!!! Thank you!

I did not follow the directions. I purchased steaks that were over 2'' thick. And the way the recipe asks you to prepare it, the steaks turned out overcooked on the outside and blood rare on the inside. Ended up cutting it up and cooking it more which toughened it thoroughly. I would make this again with thinner steaks. P.S. The butter was outstanding.

This is a great dish. We had it with filet mignons for a family dinner and the kids loved the butter. We had enough butter to freeze and we can use it again another night. We can always count on Epicurious to provide us with delicous solutions in our kitchen.

I have cooked this a couple times. The third is in preparation as I write. If you're a red meat eater, it's fabulous. To make it more enticing, I think I have found the ultimate wine to pair with it -- Domaine du Pegau, Chateaunuef du Pape 1999. The interplay of the licorice like tarragon with the earthy, berry of the wine was heavenly. For the first time in my life I fully understood the Holy Grail like search for the perfect wine food match. A great wine with a great dish that took the other to even greater heights. For the budget conscience, an earthy Cote du Rhone was pretty damn good the second time I made it.

Truly simple and delicious! Worthy of company for dinner or when you want to treat yourself. Made it last week when visiting relatives and they loved it! KIMBER

WONDERFUL! Very easy as well. I left out the scallions and used dried tarragon and bottled lemon juice and it was still fabulous. I can't wait to make it with the fresh ingredients! How can something so simple make a steak taste so amazing?!

Ohhh man!!! This is fabulous. The flavour is incredibly mouth-watering. Easy-yes. Not as fattening as I was afraid. Serve with steamed vegetables and voila! Skip butter with that crusty bread...just buy a premium quality french breadstick and savour!! This Rocks. Don't miss it!

I hate steak. This recipe has changed my mind. It was the best steak I have had in my life. However, this dish is very high in fat. So, I will also only make it on special occasions. I served it with bow tie pasta sprinkle with tarragon (no oil added) and fresh green beans. yum

I've never had bearnaise butter and was pleasantly surprised to find it delicious. However, as another reviewer said, this butter is very rich and definitely for special occasions.

We grilled the steaks and then put bearnaise butter on top when serving. It was fabulous!

Delicious! Simple, easy recipe... The bearnaise butter was something new to me, but it was really good. I really liked the tarragon with the butter...

Excellant! Much better than barbequed steak. Used red wine for scallion butter was all out of white added a lot of color.

Made this when I went on camping trip. Grilled the steaks over a wood fire. Compound butter, made at home, put on top before serving. Hard to beat.
