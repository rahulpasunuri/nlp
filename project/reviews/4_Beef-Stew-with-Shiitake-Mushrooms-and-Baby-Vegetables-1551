Rich and tasty. I added rutabaga instead of squash. I also added the vegetables, except the mushrooms, and cooked for the same amount of time as the beef. I oven roasted the mushrooms which added a bit more flavor. When I make again, I will add less beef and more vegetables.

Great stew. A few mods for low carb: omitted sugar, used radished instead of potatoes, and did not use flour to brown beef. Couldnt find the squash so just used acorn. Would use way less fresh marjoram next time- agree it is too intense in amounts called for in recipe!

Rating: 4
Awesome beef stew! I did not use the squash, but didn't really find that additional vegetables were necessary. Added sundried tomatoes though more for flavor. I do think the time listed is a bit short - it was still a bit thin. I let it sit for another hour or two and it thickened up considerably. Leftovers may have been better than the original. Fantastic overall.

I purchased a pound of fresh shitake mushrooms from chinatown and was looking for a use. I have to be honest, stew with squash did not sound good to me so I just left them out. Potatoes, carrots (grown up - no babies) and Beef. I forgot to add the marjoram but it hardly seemed necessary. It was a Gorgeous Flavor! I will make this many more times. It's not a quick dinner so start early.

I made this yesterday -- a cold, rainy spring day -- using the previous reviewer's technique of roasting the carrots, parsnips, and fingerling potatoes for about 20 minutes before adding them to the beef/wine/broth mixture. I used a big pile of creminis and shitakes and one beautiful trumpet mushroom, all cut into thick bite-sized chunks. I had only two pounds of beef, but I upped the veggies some. About a teaspoon of dried thyme and a 3-inch sprig of fresh rosemary went in with the vegetables (removed the rosemary at the end). Simmered that mixture about 15 minutes before adding the mushrooms for another 20 minutes or so of cooking. (With the preroasting, the veggies and mushrooms could easily have gone in at the same time. But it's stew, so some extra time on the stove won't hurt it.) Was going to add sun-dried tomatoes and just forgot. Frankly, the dish is costly enough as is, with the wine, good stock, beef, and exotic mushrooms, and I can't imagine the tomatoes would have added much. End result was marvelous -- rich, deep flavors with a buttery texture and melty beef. If I knew enough meat eaters, this would be a fine dish for company. Can't wait to have more for lunch today.

Love this recipe. Great flavour. For a change I roasted the carrots, potato and parsnips on the side and added to the stew at the very end. Great depth of flavour. I also used cremini and regular white mushrooms because i had no Shitake and it was also excellent.

I found the marjoram taste overpowering for this stew. I don't know that I would try this one again, after putting in the amount of effort for this recipe, I found myself disappointed.

This is a fabulous stew, even better the next day, as most stews are. Uses the whole bottle of wine minus one glass.

Not so impressed- with all these lovely veggies I expected a more interesting flavor. It tastes like (spoiler alert!)- beef stew. No better no worse than any others I've done but surely more expensive with all the wine and nice vegetables. My guests liked it fine, though.

A great "base" stew that you can enhance with your own favourite veggies rather than what is called for in the recipe. This is the first time I've made a stew with wine... and really enjoyed it! I didn't have shitake mushrooms, so I added fresh crimini and some dried chanterelles. Yum! My husband, a very picky eater, loved the stew and so did my guests (they all took the recipe home!). A definite keeper!

while I'm usually not a great beef stew fan , this recipe with several modificatiopns was phenomenal. As suggested by several others I added sundried tomatoes, exchanged thyme and rosemary for marjoram omitted the squash added parsnips and celery and cooked the vegetables approx 45 min for more tenderness. Did not need salt or pepper at the end the flavor was very complex. A standout on it's own. I had with a freshly baked Fougasse bread Great meal!

Rating: 3
This was delicious! Made a few changes - added about a half cup of chopped sundried tomatoes with the broth and beef (per Barefoot Contessa's recipe, the dried kind, not the kind in oil), skipped the squash, used olive oil instead of butter, used a rosemary sprig and a couple of thyme sprigs instead of marjoram, and added the mushrooms much earlier in the cooking process - after the onions - and let them cook down a bit before adding the garlic. otherwise, made it pretty much as written. Didn't have to add any salt and pepper beyond what I used in the flour for the beef. Very rich, and very good! Going to serve over egg noodles or with some crusty bread.

Great stew to have on the stove for a few hours during a quiet snowy afternoon at home. We had everything except the pattypan squash which was not in stock at our local grocery store today, but otherwise we enjoyed the meal very much. Initially I began searching for a recipe using the Epicurious iPhone Application which was really helpful when I was trying to figure out what to cook today - it was nice having the recipe both on my phone and the web for when I needed the full-size recipe. Thanks for the iPhone app!

made this recipe on a cold day in Florida! It smelled delicious as it simmered and came out so yummy. I followed recipe somewhat, but did as others suggested and used a can of golden cream of mushroom soup. I did not add carrots as my husband does not like them, used fresh green beans, butternut squash, baby potatoes and portobellos. It made so much I was able to freeze a portion and we ate if for two nights, once with garlic bread and the next night biscuits. Used a whole bottle of Gnarly Head Old Vine Zin in the recipe, wish I had bought two bottles so we could have a glass along with the stew :)

This stew is VERY tasty. I have made it half a dozen times and am always very happy with the result. My one substitution is canned potatoes instead of fresh ones. I always do this with stews because I find that they are much less starchy. Make sure that you have some gorgeous crusty bread to eat with it! Perfect for a cold fall/winter night.

Rating: 3
This stew is is very good! We opted to use some other vegetables in place of the squash. We also like our potatoes and carrots to be a little bit more tender, so we cooked it for longer and added a little bit more broth to keep it juicy. Make sure you season with plenty of salt and pepper. Other than that we will probably make it again!

Crockpot modified. I browned my meat and did the onions just as the recipe said, but from there I modified it a bit. After reading other reviews, I added Campbells Savory Mushroom soup (couldn't find Golden Mushroom), and THREE cans of water, some rosemary and thyme (didn't have marjoram) and about 1/2 the wine the recipe called for. I was concerned that because I was cooking this in the crockpot that the stew would have too strong a wine flavor. I was right, because 1/2 the wine was really enough. I put the potatoes and carrots in the bottom of the crockpot, then the meat and finally I poured the onion/soup mix over top. I had just enough to cover the meat. We added sliced cremini mushrooms about 1 hour before serving and they were great. I only gave this three forks because it really was delicious, but not exceptional, though I would def. make this again.

This is the first beef stew I've ever made. It was absolutely delicious.

Rating: 4
I too join the ranks of saying this is one of the best beef stews I have eaten! I used 3 1/3 lbs of top round, organic chicken stock (did not have beef) and big dollop of beef concentrate - " Organic Better than Bouillon" and a decent Calif. Cab. The depth of flavor of the stew/broth prior to adding the veggies was exceptional. I think using the butter and browning the meat very well leaving bits of the cooked flour on the bottom of the enamel pan, then deglazing the pan which had quite a bit of residue in it from the browning, made an a big difference. I used the baby potatoes and baby carrots (carrots needed an extra 10- 15 mins. cooking time), I used a mixture of shiitake and baby bellas and 2T. freash marjoram and some baby peas. Would make pretty much the same way, maybe cutting back a bit on the mushrooms. Everyone raved about it!

Just want to say the recipe is great as-is. I've served it with a green salad & pumpkin bread pudding (search Epicurious for the recipe).

Rating: 4
Although I have used Epicurious as a guideline for my cooking over the years, this is my first review. I always alter the recipe, but keep it true to its origins. As altered, it is amazing and 10 times better on days two and three. For starters, I use a duck stock made with the carcass of the Hoisin-Lime Roasted Duck. This, along with the usual stock base (peppercorns, carrots, onions, celery, bay leaf, rosemary, red-pepper flakes, olive oil, etc.) makes for a great start and easier to season later on. I use shitake or portobello, 3lbs of sirloin, a more solid potato like russet (holds together better than red) and because the broth is so flavorful, I omit the marjoram. Other than that, the recipe remains the same and lives up to its promise.

I've made this several times, and I like it. The best thing about this recipe, however, is that it's so versitile and easy to tweak so you have stew just the way you want it. The proportions and seasonings are perfect, but you can sub out any vegetables for whatever you like, or whatever you have on hand. As written it's delicious, and perfect for colder weather. This has become my standard stew recipe, but I admit most of the time I change around the vegetables.

I made this stew last night and had it for dinner tonight! Delicious with deep flavors.

Delicious and super hearty stew. Very pretty, too. Like most reviewers, I substituted butternut squash for pattypan and used portabella rather than shiitake mushrooms. Also used Little Penquin Shiraz and it was fantastic. With a salad and good bread, this is pretty darned close to the perfect winter meal.

I am eating my bowl of stew and believe I have gone to heaven. This stew is ridiculously good. I make a couple of tweaks to the recipe. I always use cambell's "golden mushroom soup" in my beef stews as I think it is the secret ingredient. I added 2 cans to the beef stock called for in the recipe. i also added a bay leaf and a few sprigs of thyme. I also used 1/2 portabello and 1/2 shitake mushrooms. Plus I cut the marjoram to 2 Tbsp. Shiraz was my wine of choice and it was truly perfect...better than mom's and that is something to brag about.

I rarely review however, this was the BEST stew I've ever made and will become a regular in our house. I made a few changes: Used 2 c. Cabernat vs 3 c(Barefoot brand); Used Beef stock - (Wolfgang Puck) -(2) 32 oz.; Used butternut squash and baby portabellos instead of shitake and pattypansquash - I also used fresh Rosemary 2 T. and 1 T. dried thyme instead of the marjoram. It was wonderful and very flavorful.

Cooking American recipes in Israel is always an adventure. Here they don't have beef broth in the supermarket, in fact, they don't even have the powdered broths that they usually sell (kosher reasons? beats me). I have made this recipe several times in the US and I noticed that there was too much liquid for my taste, and I planned on cooking it down a bit. Here is what I recommend for a flavorful thickened stew. Pour in the entire bottle of wine, and add your veggies at an earlier stage (especially if you don't have baby veggies). All mushrooms work equally well in my opinion. Add in whatever fresh herbs you have on hand - as this is a french recipe, I would recommend any of the components of herbs du provence. Cook as instructed. At the end, in a small seperate pan melt a tablespoon of butter. Add 3 tbl of flour and make a roux. Add 1/3 cup water to make a paste. Mix out any lumps. Add this mixture to your sauce to thicken it up beautifully. If you are still lacking flavour, some onion powder wouldn't hurt(in Israel I used 1 tbl onion soup mix and 1 tbl chicken soup mix at the end). Excellent - I mean it!

Crock pot review --- I am not going to rate the recipe since I changed it significantly --- but I LOVED it. I made it today in my crock pot and it worked great (I would give it 4 forks). I did no prep work (except chopping) - just loaded up the crock pot. I used rosemary instead of marjorim, used carrots, potatoes, brussel sprouts (just to try - great), onion, & portabella mushrooms. Was going to add beets, but didn't have room. I used a lot less liquid, but made sure I whisked some flour to slightly thicken it, since I did not flour/brown it initially. Just wanted to give my crock pot review in case you want that option. It was great and I can't wait to taste it tomorrow.

The only changes I made to this recipe were to use a red zinfandel (as recommended previously), and to add a couple of stalks for fresh rosemary and fresh thyme to the broth. It was FABULOUS, and the family LOVED it- my brother even drank the broth out of a coffee cup! This one is a keeper.

My family LOVES this dish. My mother in law is a great cook-and she could barely admit that this is way better than anything she's ever tried. My brother in law hates stew-and loved this.

Great stew. Used a cross rib chuck. Prefer plain chuck roast, but this was alot easier to trim & cut. Used zinfandel & much richer flavor than with cabernet. Too cheap to buy shitake so browned small crimini with the chopped onions. Subsituted peas at the end, but miss the squash(I may be the only one!). Added small boiling onions with potatoes. No fresh marjoram so added about 3/4 tsp dried. Leftovers even better.

Rating: 4
As an inexperienced cook, I always read the reviews before I make a recipe so I know what to change. I was concerned about the several 'lack of flavor' reviews, so I used a red zinfindel for the wine. I truly believe this made all the difference! My husband could not be happier. Thanks for all the suggestions.

It smelled great during the initial simmer, but was not tasty at all when it came time to eat. I did substitute green beans for the squash for convenience, but I don't think that made that much of a difference. A huge disappointment, especially considering the long cooking time and rave reviews.

This is a wonderful stew recipe, but I made it twice with different results based on the substitutions (hence the reason for only three forks). The first time, I didn't have enough beef, so I added some lamb. I also left out the squash, added celery, used fire-roasted canned crushed tomatoes instead of paste, and didn't put in as many mushrooms as it called for -- SUPERB results! The second time, I used only beef and not as much crushed tomato, and the stew was a shadow of its former self. Next time, lamb is being added for sure!

This is the best stew recipe I've found. I used boneless beef shin, which I think definitely gives a better flavour than chuck; I fried up about a cupful of chopped celery with the onion; left out the squash; used about 2/3 of the amount of shiitakes and marjoram. Served it with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and french beans. Oh - and I started it on Friday night for Sunday lunch - I think the flavour really benefits from being given some time to develop. Rave reviews from all concerned!

I made it as written, but found it lacking so I added some herbs, rosemary, thyme, oregano, a little cayanne pepper and a couple of bay leaves. It made it much better. I felt the mushrooms were lost and could use a cheaper kind. I'd make it again with the changes.

This beef stew was absolutely delicious. I made it, as suggested, a day ahead, and used 2lbs. beef and 1 lb. mild Italian sausage. Ran a little short on onions so added a few shallots.

Like others, I made some substitutions; I sauteed celery with onions, ommiting the squash, and used dried shitakes, along with crimini mushrooms. I was prepared to love this dish, but found I didn't much care for it. My husband, who loves stew, didn't love it either.

This was delicious and even better the next day. Reason I didn't give it four forks was my own fault - I substituted zuchinni for the squash -don't do it! It gets too mushy after cooking for too long. I also added peas which add some nice colour and flavour. I did use shitakes, they are much more flavourful than the button mushrooms and I believe add an extra depth of flavour to the broth. Will make it again without the zuchinni.

This is so far superior to any beef stew I have ever made! Of course, I have never used as much wine or butter in my old fashioned beef stew! I used a lean chuck roast, but cutting & trimming took alot of time. Next time I will use a rump or round roast. Not as tasty but easier. The amount of marjoram made me nervous as I rarely use it. Used 1/2 tsp dried but added a bouquet garni with bay leaves, garlic cloves & some fresh thyme. I mashed the garlic in at the end. Used fresh crimini & zucchini(no patty-pan here in winter). Absolutely delicious. I have enough for an army.

My Husband thought that the look of this stew was unappealing. I used the suggested amount of fresh Marjoram and we felt that it left an almost perfum kind of taste to it. Personally, I felt the stew was much better prior to the last step of adding the Shitake Mushrooms and the Marjoram. I would cut back on the amount of wine as well. After the stew was complete, I let it simmer for an extra hour or so and added some Garlic powder, which cut the Marjoram flavor a bit. It was O.K. Not something I would make again.

The flavor of this recipe was unique. One must like marjoram to eat this dish. I've never tried marjoram before. It is a very potent herb. For someone using this for the first time, I would recommend cutting it back by half. I got used to it but I still think it was a bit overpowering.

This has become my new stew recipe! It was great. I had to make a few subtituions, only because of what I had on hand, and it was still delicious. I couldn't find pattypan squash, so I used acorn - but I think its texture is too soft to allow for such a long cook time. Used regular mushrooms and whole red potatoes, rather than baby ones. I only used only two pounds of beef, and easily have enough to serve 8. GREAT recipe!

My husband and I loved this stew. The meat was so tender and moist and all the flavors worked well together. I had one minor problem - the liguid was VERY thick and there wasn't much of it.

What an upscale and sophisticated stew! This recipe is a winner. Now, I must tell the truth that I altered the recipe pretty drastically. I added parsnips, rutabega, crimini mushrooms, bay leaves and any other spices I thought would be tasty, and didn't add the squash or shitake at all. It works well to fill a gallon sized sealable baggie with the flour and herbs, add in some of the meat and shake. I also made little potato flour dumplings that were delicious! It was really rich and delicious!

I loved this recipe and yes I used dried mushrooms. I did not use the hot soaking liquid or the tough stems, to answer the new cook a few reviews below.

Absolutely delicious!

I have made this stew several times. It is very delicious and rich, and pairs well with rice, polenta, and my favorite horseradish mashed potatoes! I always add more mushrooms of different variety, and other veggies like peas at the last minute or green beans since pattypan squash is hard to find. Great comfort food, and is a wonderful dish to take to friends.

A bit too rich for my taste. I think next time I will cut down on the wine and the butter.

i have a question, could anyone tell me if i can use re-hydrated shiitake mushrooms? if so, how can i use the liquid used to rehydrate them? oh, and can i make this without the wine? any substitutions? please, be kind, i'm new at this :)

Just made this last night for a dinner party and it was delicious. Easily feeds more than 6 with a salad to start, and bread to mop up the sauce. Will definitely make it again.

I was in the mood for a hearty stew for a cold Fall evening and got more than what I expected with this easy delicious recipe.This definitely serves more than six people so I froze the leftovers. Also used the green beans instead of squash and mixed shiitakes with brown mushrooms. Still tasted great. Used a cab for the wine. Stop looking for another beef stew and just make this one!

This recipe was simple and the result was fantastic! I used regular mushrooms and sugar snap peas instead of green beans and all the other vegetables and it tasted great. I decided to keep the potatoes in the stew for convenience. It's a hit!

I followed Brent's suggestions about the garlic mashed potatoes and the green beans. My dinner guests very much enjoyed the stew. One suggestion: check out the current issue of Cook's Illustrated on the best red wines to use in cooking.

This is an amazing stew recipe. I added some chopped garlic, bay leaves and slit thai chillies when sauteeing the onions. Ran out of red wine, so I topped it up with some dry sherry. Also, used some worcestershire sauce and thyme instead of marjoram.

I made two alterations, and would make them again - Server the stew over garlic mashed potatos, rather than include potatos in the stew itself, and substitute french green beens for the squash. An excellent stew for leftovers, too.

Not an inexpensive recipe, but worth it. Used dried shitakes and rehydrated them in water and used the mushroom water in place of one can of beef broth. Very good.

Have made this a couple of times now and it has been delicious both times. I substituted regular mushrooms for the shitake's due to price. I also marinated the beef for 24 hours in the red wine with some onions, garlic & a bay leaf. One word of caution, this recipe makes MUCH more than 6 servings.

Fabulous stew, full rich flavor. Since shitake mushbrooms are $9.99 at my market, I used 1/2 lb and reconstituted 3/4 oz. dried wild mushrooms in 2 cups boiling water. Let sit for 10 min then drained off, then used the mushroom broth in place of 1/2 the beef broth. A whole lb. of shitake mushrooms is too much, I think.Also skipped the pattypan squash, since I don't dig 'em. Without totally changing this recipe, it was still yummy!

very tasty! I left out the squash and used a ton of mushrooms (shiitake & regular). I think 3 cups of wine is a bit much but it was pretty good with the merlot that I used. I also thickened it up a bit with some cornstarch

A fantastic recipe. We use a very woody cabernet which adds a rich flavour and used turnip instead of squash. Also added frozen peas for texture and colour.

I think this stew recipe is a great start! I seasoned the meat with italian seasoning and garlic powder before rolling in flour. I also added one large bell pepper and 3/4 of a stick more butter to the stew, the stew came out wonderfully.

This is a great basic stew recipe! I used tri-tip steak and held off on the mushrooms for the picky eaters in the house. I had hoped for left overs for the next day but my family finished the pot on the first night!! Everyone wants me to make it again soon.

This is the first time I've made beef stew and it came out great. I used, summer squash, baby bella mushrooms (shitake's are too expensive) and regular carrots instead of baby carrots and it came out great. The wine adds a wonderful flavor to this dish. I will definitely make it again.

a fabulous recipe which I will surely make again. Like other cooks I substituted regular white mushrooms, regular carrots cut into fat match sticks and zucchini. I also added some dried thyme and served the stew with a simple horseradish sauce made of sour cream and drained prepared horseradish to taste. Just fabulous, try it.

This stew was wonderful. I made it today & it's almost all gone! Very flavorful & the sauce is rich enough for my picky taste buds. A definite keeper!

I love this recipe, and have made it several times. I have found there is not much difference using regular vegetables, rather than the baby variety. I also used regular white mushrooms as well in place of shiitake. I couldn't get pattypan squash, so I substituted zucchini instead. I have made this into a large meat pie as well...What a hit! Dinner guests love this.

I'm not a big fan of stew, but decided to try this anyway. It was very good with a rich flavor. I too used a combination of mushrooms.

This was really good!!!! I used a Madiera wine (which I've found goes well in any beef recipe) and I substituted button mushrooms 'cause my supermarket didn't have shitake. I would definitely make it again.

I used half shitake mushrooms and the other half simple button shrooms and enjoyed the contrast each provided. I can't justify spending the $10.00/lb. for the shitakes when a small amount will do!!!

I wasn't a big fan of the shitake mushrooms and used regular mushrooms instead. The shitake overpowered the dish. Other than that it made great stew.

One of the best stews I have ever had. I used pearl onions instead of chopped and added a little garlic powder to the flour. Even the kids liked it.

My business (selling upscale specialty food products to 5 star restaurants) affords me the luxury of using buffalo instead of beef in this recipe. It was absolutely delicious. I'm sure it would be just as good with beef. AND...I tripled the recipe for a dinner party...made it the day before and it was great!
