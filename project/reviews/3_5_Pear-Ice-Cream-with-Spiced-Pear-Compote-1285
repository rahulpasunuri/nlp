This is an excellent tasty recipe which I've made several times now - both the ice cream and compote are fabulous. Pears are about subtlety though, so if you're the cookies and cream type or prefer rich American style ice cream, it's probably not a match for you. The compote was extremely tasty in its own right - chilled, it makes a nice dessert alone. Agree with other reviewer in adding additional vanilla and allspice.

Great ice cream recipe, the Spiced Pear Compote I can live without. For the ice cream I substituted 1/2 cup of the pear nectar for pear liquor; and for a finishing touch I added broken pieces of home made almond and brown sugar brittle, which added a crunchy surprise to the ice cream.

I think I would leave out the syrup next time. I think it gave it a bit of an iciness. I prefer super-creamy ice cream. I did not make the compote. Ice cream was delicious without it!

This is excellent - a group of co-workers have a "snacking" group for which the weekly cook rotates, and the pear ice cream I made a year ago was mentioned today, almost a year after I made it for them! The recipe is great as is, but I added a few allspice along with the cloves during the compote boiling process. I also used about twice as much vanilla as recommended in both the ice cream and compote.
