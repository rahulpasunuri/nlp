Love this recipe so much we covered it on our blog! We did soak the chicken livers in milk, just as an insurance policy against too much of a livery flavor. Thanks for all of your hard work!!!

I added 1/4 teaspoon dry thyme. It is delicious. Next time I'm going to prepare it instead of brandy with tequila, and another time with whiskey.

Loved this recipe. Simple, rich, and enjoyable. Will definitely make this again.

I have made this pate many times. It is always delicious. I almost like dried cranberries better than the dried currants suggested. I usually double the recipe and then freeze half for later use. Still tastes good!

Wonderfully easy, marvellously tasty - and best of all, apreciated by all my guests some of whom asked for the recipe. I must admit to one omission, I left out the currants. Also, I added more melted butter while in mixer as it seemed a bit too thick. So would suggest 1/3 cup of butter. This one is a definite to-be-repeated

Even the dogs wouldn't eat it.
