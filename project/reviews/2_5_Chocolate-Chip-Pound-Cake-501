This recipe is no horrible, it needs some serious tweeking. I just made it and I have to say that it is a bit dry, despite me adding 1/3 cup of vegetable oil. I will give it another try, using cake flour and adding 1/2 cup of oil with 1/3 cup of sour cream.

It was a decent cake, but a bit dry. To offset the dryness, we whipped whipping cream (no Cool Whip for us!) and served the cake with the cream. The dryness was much less noticeable, and the cream tasted great with the chocolate chips.

This cake turned out dense, crumbly and not very tasty. It was like a big, dry cookie. Not worth the effort.

This was a very good pound cake. I'm new at cooking, and this was a good place to start. This tastes just like regular pound cake that you would normally find in a bundt pan, except 10 times better! There was just enough sugar to balance this dish out, and it was easy to remove from the pan. After all of the ingredients were mixed together, I realized it was a little dry so I added about 1 extra teaspoon of milk and that made it easier to put in the pan, and it tasted moister. I will definitely make this again!!

Blech - This cake was too dry and heavy. I was expecting a "real" pound cake.

This is not pound cake - this is a loaf type cake. It does not live up to the rich, dense and buttery rendition of traditional pound cake - it was quite dry and crumbly. It's a good snack cake for mornings with coffee (instead of a muffin). The cake is quite sweet, but not for dessert fare. Like the first reviewer, check it after about 50 min. On a positive note, it's very quick and easy!

Did not like the consistency at all. Probably would come out good if you cream instead of melt the butter.

Very good! I made it in a bundt pan and it was done in one hour.

I didn't think it had enough sugar-sweetness to balance the bitter-sweetness of the chocolate chips. I would definitely serve it with something (the strawberry coulis sounds like a good idea).

Loved it!! I served mine with a strawberry coulis ... yummy!

This has become one of my "old reliable" recipes - I almost always have the ingredients on hand and can put it together in no time. I think it bakes faster than the recipe says - start checking after about 50 minutes.
