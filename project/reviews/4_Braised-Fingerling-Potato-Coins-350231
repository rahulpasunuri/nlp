So delicious and absolutely simple, especially if you have a mandoline. I used fingerlings from the farmer's market, and they had a delightful light orange hue. You may not need a full 2 cups of water, I had to add extra time for the pan sauce to boil off. Very buttery and rich. I will definitely make this dish again!

This recipe is so simple and so flavorful. I usually allow the liquid to evaporate and for the potatoes to get a little browned on the bottom, but they're amazing either way. Everyone in the family from aged 4 to 44 loves them.

Excellent. Nice creamy texture without being mushy.

This recipe draws all the attention to the wonderful texture and delicate taste of fingerling potatoes. Definitely subtle, but very satisfying. If you're eating a lot of these potatoes you might get tired of this simple treatment, but it's the only way to go when you're rediscovering the beauties of fingerlings. Even the remaining simmering water has a lovely creamy starchiness to it. A keeper!

Delicious. That is the definition of 3 forks. Exceptional? Not totally. Creamy, somewhat flavorful. Followed the recipe exactly although I cut my potatoes after slicing my finger on the mandoline. I think my yellow fingerlings were small? I used a 12" nonstick skillet and halved the recipe. It made a lot. I would try wine or stock next time.

I was dubious of this because it seemed so simple. I thought I would I could fix it up with onions or garlic or whatnot, but I tried it "as is" for a Christmas dinner dry run. Whoa Nelly! This is a case of less is more. The center tested done, but the edges were not quite as creamy done as desired, so I will be more cautious to make sure this is really well done for Christmas dinner. Yummy, yummy.

Wow, I am a potato person, and this did not disappoint one bit. I used 3 colors of fingerlings, and only 1/2 lb, and adjusted accordingly. I don't own a mandoline, but was able to slice the potatoes just fine. Next time, I would not be afraid to turn the heat a bit higher for a more robust simmer. My only regret is not having more!

This is an easy, prep potatoes and walk away side dish...loved it! Lifted the parchment and creamy, golden potato side dish emerged. Definitely on my go-to list for potatoes.

These potato coins were delicious, no doubt about that, but maybe I am missing something, I did not think they were extraordinary. Followed the recipe exactly and expected some miraculous transformation with the parchment paper, but it just didn't happen--for me anyway. It was also a bit dicey slicing the fingerlings with a mandolin. I doubt if I will make this again, too many other good recipes using fingerlings.

very good. Used French fingerlings for a French-themed night. Split potatoes between two pans since mine are not big enough. Be sure to measure parchment to top of pan, not bottom, to cover all potatoes. Next time I'll peel potatoes before slicing with mandolin since the thin strings of skin detached from tots in the serving dish and drove me nuts.

did 1 cup white wine and 1 cup water, it was superb. Took much longer than 30 mnts for the water/wine to evaporate. Next time I will try it wil less butter.

OMG - this is SO GOOD! Other reviewers are correct, sheer magic happens under that sheet of parchment. So simple, altho I did slice off the tip of my thumb on my mandolin, need to go slower next time. Fingerlings are expensive, but this was a great way to cook them. I will try this again with regular potatoes and I'm sure it will still be great.

As others have said this recipe is simply AMAZING given how utterly simple the preparation is. I subbed chicken stock for the water and cut back on the butter by half. Otherwise, utter heaven. Will make again, often!

Amazing. I was skeptical at first. I thought, "How could so few ingredients yield something so great?" I have never been more wrong about a recipe. These potatoes are outstanding. Some sort of amazing magic is happening beneath that little cirlce of buttered parchment paper.

Simple, delicious, yum. Made exactly as the recipe called for except used curly parsley instead of flat leaf.

Delicious! This is definitely my new favorite way to eat potatoes! I would also add that slicing the potatoes by hand is not difficult if you have a sharp knife. I halved the recipe and was able to cut all the potatoes in about 10 minutes. I also found that the potatoes cooked in 20-25 minutes instead of the 30-34 listed.

These are fantastic. I am a huge fingerling fan, and have tried many recipes for these flavorful little spuds. This is my new favorite. I exchanged about 1/2 cup of the water for a nice dry white wine, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. I think I may have cooked them for 5 minutes longer - I just watched until most of the liquid was evaporated. I am not sure exactly where the unique flavor comes from (is it the butter or the potatoes?)- it is almost like brown butter, earthy and sweet. As I said earlier, I've made lots of fingerlings over the years, but this recipe is a stand-out.

Amazingly easily and delish! Must be the butter. Beautiful presentation. Only thing to note is that if you cut potatoes in advance, cover with water or they will turn dark.

Astonishingly good. I will make it the next time I entertain, because it is beautiful to look at, even better to eat, and so simple.

Simply outstanding!! For refinement, you may want to brush the parchment with a basic herb butter it will add depth.

I cannot stop making and eating these potatoes. Since September, when I got my magazine, I find at least one meal a week where these fit in. Tonight is a Saturday night in August and it's on the menu again. I don't change the recipe because I agree with ronanddenna that Alice Waters knows best. I did find a new twist though. If you are lucky enough to have leftovers (not often) - they fry up, with a few shallots, until very crispy for a wonderful alternative to hash browns for breakfast.

This seems too easy to be this good. Highly recommended. Makes nice, light, silky potatoes. Adding wine and broth and are a nice addition, but not required.

wow. totally delicious. aside from cutting 2 lbs of small fingerlings into thin slices this was easy. following other reviews i used about 1.5 cups of chicken stock and only 4 tablespoons of butter. the cook time was exactly 35 minutes. lawdy, was the finished product deliciously yummers.

I didn't change one thing as Alice Waters knows exacly what she's doing. These are on my top 2 list of the best tasting potatoes I have ever had. Simple is sometimes the BEST. Do not change a thing. Total comfort food!

Excellent stovetop potato dish that is also special. Used scrubbed unpeeled Kipfler potatoes with 50/50 water/chicken stock and would not hesitate to use wine or all stock next time. They did take about 10 minutes longer than the indicated time to cook. Made as a side to other 'provincal' dishes with chicken as main, served for al fresco Easter family lunch. Would also go well as part of a more formal menu and would be perfect with salmon as another reviewer did.

This was delicious. I used 1 cup of chicken broth and 1 cup of white wine and put a sliced leek in with the potatoes. There was a lot of broth but it was delicious. I had to cook it about 15 minutes longer than recommended. It was great with poached salmon.

Wow, these were amazing! I was skeptical because the recipe is so simple, but they were great. I cut the butter in half and substituted white wine for half of the water. I will be making these again and again.

I had my doubts that something so simple would be so delicious, but was pleasantly surprised. I know it serves 8, but we had 6 guests and hardly any leftovers! I think everyone went for seconds.

We really loved this recipe but even more so when some leftovers where discovered in the fridge 2 days later and I decided to fry them with the idea "to use up" as leftovers with another meal.....wow, fanastic!! They were gobbled up by the family and they were looking for more. Nothing else was added, the leftover potatoes were just added to the saute pan and browned. Try it some time!! I highly recommend this recipe especially for "leftovers"!!

Very simple, yet one of the best potato dishes I've ever made/had. If you don't have fingerlings, baby yukon golds are excellent and buttery. I've also made this dish with cilantro instead of Italian parsley and it was an even bigger hit. I probably make this dish about once a month now.

I thought this was very good and very easy. I halved the recipe and used one pound of potatoes. For one pound of potatoes, I used about 2 T of butter. I was worried that the potatoes might stick to the skillet because I used a lot less fat than the recipe called for, but it worked fine. When the potatoes cooled in the skillet, they could be served out of it easily. I forgot the parsley but it was still great.

These potatoes were very good. I didn't peel them and would next time. My fingerlings included some purple ones, which was pretty but made the sauce look grey. I used 1 1/2 # of potatoes but still 2 c. water, and I should have cut that down, there was still a bit too much liquid when the potatoes were ready. Very earthy flavored, and a nice change for potatoes. Served w/ grilled flap sirloin and autumn farmer's market salad on this site also from Oct. '08 recipes.
