So easy and delicious. I used more bacon and it was great!

Very simple overall and good flavor. I followed a reviewers suggestion to cook the bacon a little for the grease because the potatoes tend to stick to the pan. I added a small coarsely chopped onion and 2 cloves of garlic. The potatoes were not as crispy/browned all over as I would have liked but that may be because I did them in the (MW) convection oven.

Though I dislike when people review a recipe if they have changed from what was written, that was what I will proceed to do here.... Instead of cubing the potatoes, I sliced them like I was cooking a potato gratin (used the food processor slicing attachment). With the potatoes sliced, the recipe cooked on time. I added some thinly sliced onion that added a nice, slightly sweet contrast to the potato and bacon flavors. Lastly, I am not a fan off rosemary, so I switched it for some parsley. This was a simple, delicious dish. My husband and our friend who was over for dinner were big fans.

I've tried this twice. The first time I made as written except I used a 9x13" metal pan rather than a 2 1/2-qt baking dish. As other reviewers have stated, it took longer to bake than directed and the potatoes stuck to the pan. The second time I tried it I baked only the bacon pieces for 5 minutes so, basically, there was extra bacon grease on the bottom of the pan. I removed the bacon (did not wipe the pan clean; i.e., I left the bacon grease in it), scattered the potatoes in a single layer, then put the bacon back on top. Using a metal spatula I turned the potatoes once midway through baking. I found this second technique, while using all the same ingredients, worked much better for me than the way the recipe was written. I also agree with Indianapolis, that the amount of bacon could be reduced.

This was divine, and so easy--but as with any recipe, only as good as the ingredients you use. I used local yukon golds and thick cut nitrate free bacon from Flying Pigs Farm. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly using a metal pie pan. Tossed the bacon with the potatoes midway through cooking to distribute flavors. Potatoes stuck a little, but the crispy crust was addictive...will make again!

This is easy, and it's good. But I think you don't need this much bacon. It does stick to the baking dish -- even greased -- but it's worth it.

have made 4-5 times now, and it's taken longer than 35 minutes to cook- i baked in a glass dish, and has been the perfect accompaniment for beef and pork fillet. haven't tried the garlic/onion enhancements- it's just a good side dish staple.

Even with all the bacon, flavor was just not there.

Tasted like an insipid version of my fried potatoes. As my husband put it, "Totally weak."

Since I only had small new potatoes on hand, I used these instead of boiling potatoes. The casserole is comfort (if not fattening) food. I added lots of garlic and onions and served them with sour cream. I will make them again, but not on a regular basis....I don't think the waistline could handle it!

Made this as a side dish to a beef tenderloin dinner, and everyone loved it. I think I will follow the advice of the NYC cook next time, however, and butter the dish. I didn't like the potatoes sticking to the bottom of the pan. Otherwise, delicious and very easy!

Easy to prepare. Great accompaniment to breakfast or dinner. Adding onions and garlic increases wonderful cooking aromas. Sprinkle with chopped parsley before serving for additional color.

Great, simple, tasty potato side dish that can be replicated for guests as well as weeknight dinners. I used yukon gold potatoes and buttered the dish so that the potatoes wouldn't stick to the bottom and added leeks. Yum.

This was so simple and GOOD! I used dill instead of rosemary, and added a cup of chopped yellow onions. I used one tblsp ovile oil and one tablespoon of a curry mayo blend I had in the fridge. I chopped the bacon into small bits. I absolutely loved this!!

This was easy to make and delicious! It got gobbled up at a recent party. I cubed the potatoes and cut the bacon ahead of time, then covered the potatoes with cold water until baking time. I more than doubled the recipe but did not use that much bacon, maybe 7 slices. Also used dried rosemary and needed to increase the cooking time to over an hour. Really good though!

I don't need the recipe. I created this (well, I came up with it over 25 years ago)!!!! I never thought I would see it published anywhere. It has been an easy and well liked way to do the potato's. I've tried adding all manner of seasonings over time. It largely depended on what was in the house at the time. It's hard to mess it up. I even threw in leftover mushroom and leek soup to the raw potato's once and added the bacon when it was about 1/2 way cooked down (there was enough soup to just barely cover them). It worked great!!!

I did this for a week-end breakfast with eggs and sausage.The potatoes were wonderful, even tho we did add a little more spice, and chopped onions.
