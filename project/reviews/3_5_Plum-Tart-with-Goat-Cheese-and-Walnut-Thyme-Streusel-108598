4 substitutions: i. Homemade goat cheese (in the style of cream cheese or clotted cream). Small bit of sheep ricotta added to the mix. ii. Almond meal (from Trader Joe's) in place of the walnuts because a) I have it on hand, and b) my beau prefers almonds to walnuts. iii. The figs in syrup idea from another cook (aliptac of cambridge), with rosemary in the syrup. iv. Rosemary in place of thyme, because a) (again) I have it on hand, and b) forgot to pick up thyme at the market today. Report from the dinner guests? Definitely worth doing again. I brought this dessert to a friend's dinner party where it served 12.

I made this dessert for our wine club crowd & everyone loved it! The crust was delicious - the walnuts are a nice touch. I can see the point of cutting back on the goat cheese for a lighter tart, but I enjoyed the richness. I blended the cheeses and honey with a hand mixer & felt like it lightened the texture a bit. I definitely agree that this is way too much streusel for one tart - if I make it again I would cut that part of the recipe in half & add more thyme. This may sound strange, but I paired the tart with a sparkling Rose (of Malbec) and it worked perfectly.

This is easy, unusual, and not too sweet. However, the recipe makes so much streusel you could bury the tart in it. Next time, I'm adding more thyme. I made fresh homemade ricotta (a Gourmet recipe on this website), which was a revelation. I'm never buying ricotta again!

Good, but not knock-your-socks-off. I'd make the cheese and streusel again and just put it on top of fresh plums or berries. The crust wasn't necessary.

I made this for a dessert party and my friends couldn't get enough. It was a nice summer break from all the decadent chocolate desserts I usually make. It does take some effort, but the beauty of it makes even the most desert unfriendly person go for a slice! My tip, make sure you buy fresh ripe plums. If you can't get to a farmer's market, then buy them and let them sit in the sun a day to become juicy and sweet.

Given that I love ricotta and I love goat cheese, I thought I would really, really enjoy this tart. Not so much. After eating this tart, I personally don't think these two items should be mixed together. Or, at the very least, I would go with half the goat cheese (or twice the ricotta). Regardless, I won't bother to try again. It was a lot of effort for something that was just so-so. I did think the crust was good; the streusal was inventive and tasty; the plums with honey was good; the ricotta-goat cheese mix just didn't do it for me.

this is really a fantastic tart, and not that much trouble to make considering the formality of the dessert. the walnuts make the tart crust delicious, and the goat cheese filling is great- interesting but not wierd at all. the streusel is very tasty, but i wish i hadn't stirred it more than once while baking/cooling, because i liked the bigger chunks. i actually didn't use the streusel and plums, only because i had some georgeous figs on hand. i poached them in a simple syrup with rum, and put them on top of the filling and crust with a drizzle of the syrup... divine. by the way, DON'T make the stupid mistake i made and substitute an equal quantity of granulated sugar if you don't have powdered sugar-- it is far too much sugar. though it's really crisp and tasty that way, you won't ever get it out of the pan!! use 1/4 to 1/3 c. granulated sugar if you must, and it will be fine. powdered sugar does help make it slightly crisper, though, without the sticking problem.

For a quicker and easier, yet still delicious, version of this original dessert, I made the plum and cheese tart without the strudel. I used low-fat ricotta instead of whole-milk, and it was still very rich. I got nothing but compliments from my guests, who all wanted the recipe. I would definitely make it again!
