Mine turned out really yummy! I painted my almond nails red with food coloring and made another batch where I made my dough green and made monster fingers without painted almond nails.

I have made these twice now. they look great but taste bland. I only did 1/2 tsp of salt, added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of almond extract in addition to 1 tsp vanilla extract. Still just a good but non sweet shortbread. I think next time I will reduce flour to 2 1/4 c. and increase powd. sugar to 1 1/2 c. and see if that helps. If they were going to be iced with a frosting or dipped in chocolate then the cookie recipe would be just fine but since there is nothing but a slice of almond on it it needs more sweetness. The presentation tho is great!! This time I refrigerated my dough for 2 hrs. then cut slices off the dough disc to make square "fingers" then lightly rolled it into a rounded finger and this helped alot to keep them from spreading. My cookies were for elem kids. so could not make them very goulish. I also made some using a green or black jelly bean and they looked better than the almond I thought. I just wet the jelly bean a touch and attached them to the finger and then baked them. I tried using candy corns, red hots, tootsie rolls slices and twizzlers but the jelly beans looked the best. I did not use the icing glue at all.

I have made these for two years and think they are a bit dry, too salty and not sweet enough. The texture is like a shortbread but without the sweet balance to the butter. And they do spread. I would make them again, but with less than a heaping tablespoon per finger, with less salt and more sugar. They do look great!

These turned out perfectly creepy! and fairly easy to make. I read other reviews and decided to use 3/4 tsp of baking power and salt. This seemed to work very well. I pressed on the almond before baking, some fell off after cooled,if bumped, but I stuck the almond back on with raspberry jelly and that was a cool effect too. I made the icing glue but put several drops of red food coloring and one drop of blue food coloring and dipped the bony end in it for a very creepy effect. These were a great hit with my teenage daughter and her friends.

2 forks for taste, 4 forks for presentation. Too salty, next time I will reduce by 1/4 to 1/2. I dipped the almond slices in raspberry jam before baking. Baked just until golden on the bottom. For an extra creepy look, I dipped the severed fingers in red candy melts (red-colored white chocolate). A big hit for a Halloween party!

These were yummy and went quickly. When I made them they really puffed and spread a bit like others mentioned, maybe try next with less baking powder. But still once I added the fingernails had a creepiness perfect for Halloween... will likely make again next year.

I added 2 Tbsp of melted white chocolate to the butter and halved the salt. I also added a little bit of nutmeg and cinnamon. The first batch I did spread out a lot, so I added a little more flour to the dough. The next batch still spread out a lot, so I made the next batch extra skinny. They turned out god. They tasted great too. Like shortbread!

These turned out great! The taste leaved much to be desired, but they LOOKED amazing. In fact I won the "scariest dessert" contest at work. I added the almonds before baking as other reviewers suggested, and used red food coloring to dye the icing glue. I also cut slits on the non-nail ends to make them look more "severed". I made another batch of red icing glue with a little more water (less pasty), and "painted" it sloppily around the severed ends of the cookies to make them look a bit more frightening. It worked! My toddler saw them and started crying (oops). I arranged them on a platter with gummy worms -- very creepy. Definitely needs more flavor. I got last place for the "tasty dessert" contest! So what -- it's all about the looks with this one! I used orange extract but I think I needed to add more. Maybe peppermint extract and green dye next time... Wish I could upload a photo! Tip -- definitely keep the fingers slim before baking. You don't need a "heaping" tablespoon, in my opinion -- just a enough for a skinny finger! They do spread.

These cookies are hilarious. I did make them slightly too big, which I think worked out fine, just pass them off as "monster fingers". I found that a jagged-chopped almond looks extra creepy on the fingers! I decreased the amount of salt by 1/2

The trick is to not make the fingers to thick or they don not look as real. I used red jam to hold the almond slivers in place. I was asked to bring a chocolate trifle to the party so I made the top layer of the trifle crushed chocolate cookie crumbs and made a tombstone and the fingers rising from the "dirt". Made a great presentation!

Way, way, way too salty.

Personally, I think these are bland, but my guests loved them! And they are absolutely ADORABLE!!! They came out just like the picture as long as they were small enough.

I LOVE these cookies - They are E-A-S-Y, fun and delicious. A few things that I did differently; I refrigerated the dough overnight, I used melted red chocolate wafers to attach the "almond nails" and I dipped the ends of the cookies into the red melted chocolate for that tasty, gory, ripped- off look. Next year, I think I'm going to add green food coloring and maybe a dash of nutmeg to the dough... I can't wait.

I was not very impressed with the cookie taste. I followed the recipe as written and the cookies spread some but also cracked during baking.I did not refrigerate the dough though as the dough was dry and formed into fingers just fine. I was disappointed after baking them because the cookie was VERY hard after baking. The texture is smooth but the taste was average.

These cookies are fantastic - they taste great and truely look like severed fingers!! I followed the tip about putting the almonds on before cooking, and it worked really well. Also cut refrigerated dough into finger shapes to minimise handling, and therefore warming of the dough - this reduced spread during cooking.

This is a great cookie. I use a little extra flour (they don't seem to spread as much). This year I used coconut extract instead of vanilla. I also stick the sliced almonds into the dough before I bake the cookies and paint on a little red food coloring to simulate"blood". Quite yummie!

I made these last year and again this year. They're really easy to make and are delicious. To the art director cook from New York, you should probably try the recipe before you decide it won't work.

These cookies not only look great, but they actually taste good. I made them with my grandchildren (6 and 4 yrs.), and followed the directions just as they were. It make 49 cookies, and looked just like the photo.We had lots of fun.

These are really fun to make, but they do take some time. The last few times I made them I dipped the almonds in red or green food dye so they looked like the nails were painted. I also added red food dye to the ends of the fingers so they look severed. Worth the time at any holloween party or bake sale.

i made these in in the pastry shop i work in but i reduced the flour to 2/12 cups and added 3/4 cup of chopped pistachios and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. i also stuck natural almonds on with a bit of jam before baking them. the green made them look a bit witchy!!

This needs a little truth in advertising. The food stylist who worked on this lovely photo did not bake these as directed. I am art director and work in food alot. There is no way that these cookies containing egg, baking powder and this much BUTTER will not spread much wider, and the recommended 2 teaspoons per cookie will not accomodate an almond as pictured. Expect wide oval cookies with this, sort of fingerlike, but nothing like photo.

I made these cookies for a halloween party and they were a hit from Moms and kids alike! The only change I made was to use red jelly on nail bed with almond slice prior to baking (no icing required). They looked great but more importantly they were delicious. I have a new sugar cookie recipe.

These cookies were a hit, even if some people were scared to try them. They're very realistic looking.

Has anyone tried making these in advance and either freezing the dough or the finished cookie? Or, alternately, how many days in advance can they be prepared and still be good?

i made these for my adult labmates for halloween '06 and they loved them. i would add (even more) additional spices for more flavor. many of my almond slices had chips on them so i said they were left from zombies as they clawed their way out of the ground.

This recipe is a lot of fun to prepare. To prevent the cookies from spreading I chilled them for 15 mins. and it worked well. I used whole almonds dipped in dark red food coloring and stuck them on before baking. I also painted the nails with egg white to make it look more like nail polish--to quite an effect!

These were great! I used jelly beans (red, black and green) as we had nut allergies to contend with, but they turned out great! Push the Jelly bean into the dough prior to baking. They do bubble and crack a bit but IMO that only adds to the effect!

I used half vanilla and half pure almond extract...good flavor. Also added a bit of almond extract to the 'glue' along with red coloring for a 'bloody' effect, drizzling it randomly on the fingers. Mine spread also, but with the slightly green coloring I added, they looked like Frankenstein fingers. Good fun and the kids enjoyed them.

For those with nut allergies... try cutting some fruit leather into a nail shape.. since it is red it can look like painted fingernails!!

Added green food coloring to the dough to give them a witch/ghoul effect. Kids and adults alike loved them!

Was just in checking for Halloween ideas. How about putting in a few drops of Almond extract to make the cookie a little more tasty??

Great fun for Halloween! I drizzle a white chocolate band around the bottom of the finger and add a smartie to make it look like a ring, gives a lttle more flavor. Any ideas for the nail besides an almond for all those nut allergies?

I used my marzipan cookie recipe for this as it is easily modeled, and pretty tasty. Thought the original cookie not very interesting. But the idea is fun.

These are really generic in taste, but they look fantastic. Having a small amount for an adult party is fun, but only children will think they're particularly yummy. I'll keep making them for halloween though.

Looked great, but not especially tasty.

These were a huge hit at our Halloween party - so realistic and creepy. Do make sure to make the "fingers" very thin before baking as they spread. Followed the recipe precisely but also used almond rather than vanilla essence. For some fun, color the "glue" with red food coloring so the nails look a bit bloody (well, of the kids aren't too squeamish that is)!

I just finished baking these. They were great! My two toddlers had a great time helping me. The dough was very easy to work with. The recipe was real simple. I substituted almond for the vanilla extract, but I don't think that would have changed the texture, which is delicious. I'm going to find a way to use this recipe for Christmas too.

A friend made these and they were an absolute scream! Tastey too, but really fun to play with, for the adults as well as the kids.
