I have used this recipe for years and it is the go to/never fail brownie secret weapon. I agree with the post about good chocolate--this puts the flavor over the top! I also put a little extra espresso than prescribed since I am a coffee lover and this perfected the recipe in my opinion. A word of warning with that, though- do not go as far as doubling the espresso unless you do not intend to fall asleep for a while. :P

This is hands down the best brownie recipe I have ever used. And I eat a lot of brownies. Obviously use good chocolate, but in a pinch I have used bakers and it wasn't bad.

Amazing (fudgy) brownie recipe! I did NOT use foil in the pan, too annoying... I just buttered the bottom and sides REALLY well and had no problem removing them. As for the reviewers that said the coffee flavor is too strong, I have to disagree! The coffee actually brings out the deep, delicious chocolate flavor - no one in my family even realized that I had put the espresso powder in! YUM!!! Make them! : )

This is my go-to brownie recipe. It does make a lot, so I usually halve the recipe and bake in an 8x8 (makes them a little thicker, too, which I like). Definitely reduce the espresso powder to 2 tsps. This recipe is also very forgiving. I've found it's best as followed, but you can easily swap white for whole wheat or use bittersweet/semisweet chocolate and reduce the sugar a bit instead of baker's. Add nuts or candy pieces if that's what you fancy.

I gave this recipe 4 forks because I think that for a mocha brownie these were exceptional but for a brownie in and of itself I would have to give these 3 forks. I only used 2 teaspoons of the expresso powder and I must say that the taste of expresso was too much for me. I think that if you like mocha in your brownies then this is the recipe for you. I also added some walnuts to this recipe and did like the crunch that they provided.

I've been looking for the perfect brownie recipe for a LONG time. One that I can come back to and use for bake sales, holidays, sleepy Sunday mornings... I've baked every recipe that comes my way. Well, it was about time for another bake sale, and me being disappointed with my brownie repetoire, decided to check out what Epicurious has to offer in the Brownie Department. This recipe quickly shot to the top of our list and is #1 at the moment. I should mention that we are fudge brownie lovers, not a cake brownie lovers, so if you are into cake like brownies, this recipe might not be for you. I made the following adjustments: Used 13x9 pan; baked at 375F for 27 minutes for the first batch and then 25 minutes the second batch. We liked the 25 minute brownies better - a bit more fudgy; used 4 ounces of 100% unsweetened Ghirardelli chocolate baking bars and 3 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder plus 1 tablespoon of butter for the 5 ounces of unsweetened chocolate required for the recipe; for the 1 tablespoon of instant espresso powder, I used 1 tablespoon of brewed coffee; and because I LOVE vanilla upped it to 1 tablespoon instead of 1 teaspoon. Delicioso!

Extremely easy and delicious. Tripled espresso powder and used 6 oz chocolate instead of 5, and added cocoa powder to bits instead of flour. Also used 1 stick of butter and added some greek honey yogurt for moisture and tang. Reduced sugar to compensate for the sweet yogurt. My new go-to brownie recipe.

Rating: 3
These were definitely "delicious", and certainly easy enough to make, but I'm stopping short of calling them "exceptional". I made them entirely according to plan, except I used 2 tsp of the instant espresso powder, as opposed to the 1 TBSP ( = 3 tsp) that was called for, simply because I wanted to share them with my kids. Personally, I love espresso, but I'm really glad that I cut back a bit on it here, because they still had more than enough of an abundant espresso taste.

JUST made these as we are in the midst of a storm and I can't get out of the house. Adjustments I made due to not being able to go to the store or just plain because I wanted to: -Bittersweet instead of unsweetened chocolate -Cut sugar by 1/2 cup -Cut vanilla by 1/2 tsp -Added 1/2 tsp amaretto -Cut chocolate chips by 1/2 cup -Baked in (mini) muffin pans at 350 for about 15 minutes Seriously, so amazing! I recommend everyone make these. You can't go wrong! Only thing to be careful on is greasing the pan or lining properly with parchment or foil. Otherwise you will be licking the inside of your pan for all the remnants of chocolate (trust me).

WOW! I just made these tonight. They are the perfect amount of gooey-goodness. I'd never made brownies from scratch before, and this recipe was really easy. I'm not a coffee drinker, but had a pack of Starbucks Via on hand. One tube/package was the perfect amount for the coffee flavor.

Rating: 3
Very easy recipe. The foil was kind of unwieldy to place in the pan, but it allowed to just lift the brownies out of the pan and onto the cutting board, so no risk of scratching the pan. I used 1T of espresso powder and actually found the flavor to be pretty subtle; I smelled it more than I tasted it. I used a 9x13 pan, and split the difference between the reviewers who said they cooked theirs for 23 and 32 minutes, and it turned out fine.

Rating: 4
Best brownies I have ever made. They are very dense and fudgey. I have made them a number of times with different chocolate (usually just Bakers squares) and they always taste great. I don't really taste the mocha - it is more of a rich chocolate flavour. A couple of times, they were extremely soft in the middle even after baking for longer than the recommended time. However, while they were messy to eat, the taste is still there.

WONDERFUL, I've tried other brownie recipes and always regretted it. This is what brownies are supposed to taste like. When I make them instead of using the Espresso powder I brew really strong raspberry chocolate coffee. works wonderfully.

Rating: 4
These were great! I used fairly high-end chocolate, though, as it does make a difference. I didn't change any of the ingredients, but I did make 1.5x batch because of the complaints that the brownies were a bit "thin" - I wanted a more standard thickness - and this did the trick. I baked them in a 13"x9" pan for about 32 minutes - I purposely wanted to undercook them slightly so they'd be moist and fudgy the next day - and they were! They were gobbled up in no time!

Rating: 4
AH-MAY-ZING!!!!! I'm almost afraid to share the recipe with other people, it's that good. I opted to butter up a mini muffin tin very well and put about a tablespoon or two of batter into each little well. Needless to say, the most delicious two-bite brownies were born and I'm going to make this a regular recipe in my rotation.

These brownies have a beautiful crust and a nice chewy interior. Great for coffee lovers but those who prefer the unadulterated taste of dark chocolate may find it a little distracting. Quality chocolate is a must - I used Valrhona 55% dark chocolate. Personally I prefer Malgieri's recipe for Supernatural Brownies, (see www.aspoonfulofsugah.blogspot.com) for review.

Super easy to make! Having unsweetened cocoa powder on hand, I did the old substitution of 3 tablespoons powder + 1 tablespoon fat (in this case butter). I melted all butter in a saucepan over very low heat, turned off the heat, then added the cocoa powder and whisked until smooth, then followed the recipe as given. Well, at high altitude (8000 feet), I always have to bake them a bit longer than given. But great, great, great!

I made mini muffins - full to the brim it made approximately 30. Baked at 350 for 15 minutes. I used regular Bakers unsweetened chocolate, and didn't have expresso powder so omitted, but I did add 3 tablespoons of Bailey's Irish Cream in addition to the 1 tsp vanilla. Absolutely delicious!! A bit of crunch on top and fudgy and chewy in middle. I'm serving them tonight with ice cream and all the fixings for brownie sundaes.

Wow. If you like your brownies fudgy, use this recipe! The best brownies ever. I undercooked them to keep them moist (350, 15 min). The coffee flavor came through and they were just scrumptious with raspberries and vanilla ice cream. A bit of Kahlua drizzled over top. Just be sure to use high-quality chocolate.

Rating: 3
I'm not saying these weren't really good because they were. I just like a cake-like brownie and these were really chewy and dense. Afraid of overcooking, I took them out right at 20 min. when the sides were pulling away and the top looked cooked. But I think they weren't cooked enough. It was still moist in the middle when I began cutting after cooling. I'll cook longer next time. Also I couldn't really taste any "mocha." Maybe I'll up the espresso powder next time. And what's a 15 by 10 pan? I don't have one. I lined my pan with foil but not sure what the point was. This was great and got some compliments from the tailgate party I took them to but I'm still looking for my favorite brownie recipe.

I've made (and reviewed) these a few times. They are my go to brownie for grownups. I'm writing this time with another tip. Bake these in nonstick mini muffin tins that have been spritzed with a bit of spray oil. Then you don't have to mess with the foil or parchment at all, they release beautifully, and you have gorgeous little brownie bites to share. When I cook them like this, I do 350 for 12-14 minutes.

Fantastic! It's great for coffee beginners and seasoned connoisseurs alike; despite my boyfriend being the former and me being the latter, we both loved it. After cooking, I sprinkled some more semisweet chips on top and drizzled it with white icing to make it look cute. Next time, maybe I'll get creative and substitute the espresso powder with chai spice or something, but I will definitely be going back to the original recipe now and then, too!

Can I make these the day before for a party and what is the best way to store them for about 24 hours?

Easy and wonderful! Who has a 15x10 pan? I used 9x13 and baked 23 minutes, which was just right. Took advice of others and used parchment to line pan, but found it difficult to get tight in corners. They came out easily, but ends were wavy from shape of parchment. I'll try foil next time. Used milk chocolate chips and think semi-sweet would have been better. Still great!

Rating: 4
Obviously this couldn't be bad. I made a few modifications though that I thought I'd mention... #1, reduced butter to 1/2 cup, added about 1/4 cup of yogurt to compensate. #2, tripled the espresso powder and added a glug of coffee as well. #3, only used three eggs, it was all I had. #4, added about 1/3 cup of cocoa powder (subtracted from overall flour amount); #4, added a touch of cinnamon. #5, added 1/2 tsp of baking powder, just to give it a bit of lift. FABULOUSNESS. Make these now and make others jealous of your culinary prowess.

The best! I took another cook's advice and used parchment paper to line the pan, and they released like a charm. I used dark chocolate kisses, but would add a bit more sugar next time, or use milk chocolate as stated. I did use more coffee powder as several recommended, but could hardly taste it. Next time, I will try triple! Maybe ground nuts! Stored them in tins with waxed paper between the yummy layers. Sit down boxed brownie mix!

Neither my partner nor I care for super-sweet goodies, but we had a craving for something chocolatey late one night. Followed this recipe to a "T" and they were wonderful. Great texture, not too sweet, and mine have stayed nice and moist for the past two days. Most importantly this recipe is VERY easy and left very little mess to clean up. This will go in my "make again" box.

So, so good. This is my go to brownie recipe -- so easy and so delicious. I find that using the foil to remove them from the pan makes it much easier to cut nice, even pieces. I bake mine in a 9x13 pan and add 4-5 minutes for the baking time.

Rating: 4
A truly fabulous brownie recipe - and I live in a house of brownie snobs. After reading the reviews that said the original recipe came out too thin, I doubled it and put entire recipe in a 9"x12" pan. Not wanting to over bake, the baking time was a little tricky but 40 minutes turned out to be just about perfect. This is a very rich brownie so I cut the pan into bite sized pieces. My guests still ate the whole pan but seemed to appreciate being able to do so one small bite at a time.

Rating: 4
I made the recipe as written. My only modification was using parchment paper instead of al. foil, a 9x13 pan, cooked it a bit longer than written, using a toothpick to test doneness. These are excellent and I tend to be a bit picky. Moist, dense and great chocolate flavor. The coffee gives it just a hint of mocha without being too much. Will most certainly make them again.

Rating: 3
One great recipe and I'd give 3.5 folks. The brownies are moist, chocolaty and well balanced in terms of sweetness and flavor and very easy to make. I just made this for the first time following the recipe to a tee. I agree that it's a great recipe, one worthy of making it again and perhaps with some modifications for my liking (I'd like it thicker, more coffee flavor and with some nuts.)

These are perfect. I subed 60% cocoa chips for the unsweetened chocolate and reduced the sugar by 1/2 c. I doubled the powder, added 1 t. of baking powder and did not add the chips. I used greased parchment paper and they turned out perfectly! These are the best homemade brownies ever!

Such a good brownie and so easy to make. I added extra coffee powder and 3 tablespoons of Kahlua. We prefer thicker brownies, so I made one and a half times the recipe in the 15 x 10 pan and baked it for about 28-30 minutes. It was perfect. I lined the pan with foil and sprayed the foil with Bakers Joy. When the brownies were cool, I refrigerated them for a couple of hours and then lifted the brownies out of the pan and the foil peeled right off.

Excellent brownie. Added 1 tablespoon Kahlua but didn't find it to have a distinct mocha flavor. Next time I will increase the coffee powder and the Kahlua. As I do with almost all of my brownies, rather than butter the foil, I sprayed it with Pam for Baking and there was absolutely no problem removing them from the foil. I did use a 15 x 10 inch pan and though they are thin, the brownies came out perfect.

The texture is rich and gooey and moist - the taste was a bit on the bitter side for me though so the 2nd time I used half dark chocolate instead of all unsweetened and sprinkled more chips on top and they were perfect!

A really great brownie recipie. I did like one tester suggested and added some Kaluha to the mix before I added the flour (a whole airport mini). In addition instead of using the 5 oz of chocolate I subsituted unsweetend valharona cocoa powder. (1 oz chocolate = 3T cocoa powder + 1 T butter) I thought I was going to swoon when I tasted the batter. Very dark and rich chocolate. For those of you in texas lucky enough to have a Central Market, you can purchase Valharona cocoa powder at the bulk foods section. I also omited the chocolate chips. They don't really need it, instead I added chopped chocolate covered coffee beans. Delicious! I already snuck one to try....wow. I'll be serving them tonight for dessert with a coffe flavored whipped cream and powdered sugar. I wish I could eat the whole pan!

These are really yummy and extremely easy to make. I've already made them multiple times, and they're well on their way to becoming a staple in my collection. The only catch is the recipe isn't clear that the type of pan you need to use is a rimmed baking sheet or jelly roll pan--the first time I made them, I used a 9x13 baking dish, and it wasn't a succes.

Delicious! I made it this past weekend for my twins 6th birthday party and all twenty 6-7 yr olds loved it. As did the adults, who were brave enough to stick around for this party! I did substitute - used 2 oz bittersweet, 1 oz semi-sweet and 2 oz unsweetened chocolate, keeping the little ones in mind. It tasted fabulous. I used buttered parchment paper and baked in the recommended pan and it was done in 18 mins. This will now become my primary brownie recipe!

took the advice of a previous review and lined the pan with parchment instead of foil. This worked well. I also added 1 1/2TBS of Kalua when adding the sugar, seemed to add good flavor. I didn't have the proper size pan so I used a 9x13 instead. Next time I'll cook them a few min. longer. Still turned out ok, just a little "fudgie" for my liking.

It's "a cook from greenpoint, brooklyn" again. I just made this recipe again and have this tip: use parchment paper instead of foil and spray it with cooking spray instead of butter. This go around, it was infinitely easier to get the brownies off the paper, they came right off. When I used foil, it was more work and I had to pick little bits of foil off of some of them. The coffee taste wasn't pronounced enough for my liking this time. If you really want a mocha flavor, increase the coffee. Happy baking (and eating!)

Rating: 3
The taste of these brownies is great. The coffee really adds something and the density of the chocolate is absolutely mind-buzzingly good. On a technical note, do as the recipe says and not as I did and use the right size pan. My pan was basically a jelly roll and the extra inch in each direction made the batter too thin. Especially on the corners, those came out too dry. But if it had been the right thickness, these would be a perfect brownie with that something "extra". Also, really grease that foil like it says, otherwise little bits of brownie will stick and cause the pretty crust to crack. Sprinkle with powdered sugar for easyily achieved oohs and ahhs.

Rating: 4
I must have done something wrong that turned out right, because these were so gooey, I can't imagine anybody saying they were dry or dried easily. In any event, last time I made them I doubled the coffee and substituted white chocolate chunks for the chocolate chips and they were the best yet. Highly recommended.

I am not sure what everyone is talking about. The brownies turned out fine, but after a couple of hours, they dry up. They are still super dense and rich, but they get stuck in your throat - just too dry. Next time, I will add maybe a 1/2 cup of sour cream or something else to keep it moist. I even used European butter, which has a higher fat content than American butter, and it was still dry.

These are without a doubt the BEST brownies on the PLANET!! I have made them so many times I've lost count. Add a little extra coffee for a stronger mocha flavor. Bake them in the recommended pan (minus the chips) and you get thin, elegant brownies you can dust with powdered sugar. Or bake them in a 9 x 9 pan for about 35-40 min and you get thick, fudgy, to-die-for brownies! Bonus: they're a snap to make, you only use 2 bowls, and by lining with foil, the pan doesn't even get dirty!

being a londoner and loving brownies is always unfortunate, other recipes have been too cake like, this is reason i looked for your site. i love this recipe. i have now made them several times, sometimes with nuts and the slight coffee taste really boostes the chocolateness. only difference is i add half a teaspoon of baking powder to the plain flour. friends (i seem to have a few more now...) tell me they taste like deli ones. i scored this 3 instead of 4 because there might be better recipe, haven't tasted it yet but live in hope...

I whipped these up just before a party (in a bit of a haste), and realized while they were baking that I had completely forgotten the 4 eggs!

Every one in my family loved the brownies I made. I am only 8 and they were really easy. but I did not put in any mocha. but instead of the mocha, I put in lots of cinnamon and chili powder. I put in chili powder because that is what they do in Mexico. but you cannot taste the chili powder. It just gives it a little more flavor. please trust me-it is great! you should try it. It is what all great cooks use. My family couldn't taste the chili, but they said it had an extra thing that made it taste so good and I think it was the chili powder.
