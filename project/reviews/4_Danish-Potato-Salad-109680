I made it as the recipe called for, but second time I cut the potatoes only 1/8 inch thick;delicious!!

This was great! No changes, though I didn't do the full amount of potatoes. I did keep about a 1/4 of the dressing for right before serving. Very nice change & I'm sure it would be great with many of the changes suggested.

Served this to a large group and everyone loved it. Overcooked the potatoes a bit, and made the day before. Held together well and tasted great after marinating overnight. Added more mustard and capers. Could probably do with less oil. Wonderful flavors, will make again!

Just finished our dinner on the porch and we all throroughly enjoyed the potato salad. I added more mustard than the recipe called for and just a dash of sugar helps offset the harshness of the salts and vinegar but overall it was great and much lighter than mayo-based salads.

This was a great salad. Like many others who reviewed this, I was looking for a potato salad that didn't have mayo (although I do love the traditional too). It was perfect with grilled pork tenderloin. The only changes that I made was to add additional dressing right before serving; double the mustard; and I added half of a red bell pepper for color and flavor.

I made it per the recipe, but added several coursely chopped hard boiled eggs. Served it with bar-b-qued ribs and it was a Big Hit, Will definitely make again.

This was yummy & was a hit at the potluck dinner I brought it to. The only change I made was to double the mustard in the dressing. After reading the other reviews, I poured half the dressing over the potatoes immediately after cooking them, then poured the rest on just before I served the salad. Yum!

Followed recipe and it was delicious. Received tons of compliments and it was so simple/easy to make. This is a keeper!

Delish! I made it once as written with excellent results. Today I made it for a BBQ and revised it a bit. I had no chives in the house so I replaced them with one finely chopped garlic scape (YUM) used baby red, purple and yukons and left the skins on (provied great color). As I had cooked the potatoes a little too long -instead of slicing them-I lightly "smashed" them along with the herbs and dressing and added a bit of fresh clipped dill. It was a huge hit!

Hum... My experience has been the same as most: excellent as written. I made it for a party tonight, and it was polished off; compliments between bites. However, I found that I could get away with 1/2 the dressing. I fully expected to have to make twice as much due to it being absorbed by the potato. But I added the dressing when the potatoes were cold, and half the amount was fine.

Fantastic! I used apple cider vinegar, added dill, and made 50% more dressing. I poured the extra dressing on immediately before serving (the potatoes completely absorb the amount the recipe calls for).

Delicious exactly as written - the only change I make is to reduce the oil slightly. It always gets rave reviews.

I've been making this salad since the recipe first appeared, and I love it just as is: reminds me of the salads my grandmother (from Latvia) mades. I used to just guess a proportions for an "authentic" taste - and this is as close as it comes. I'll admit, however, that I add a bunch of fresh dill along with the capers and parsley ('cause Grammy always used the dill.)

This is a great recipe for those who like potato salad but don't like the fat or taste of mayonnaise. I served this on mother's day and it was a big hit. It's also easy to make in advance and tastes great at room temperature or cold, and it keeps well, despite the recipe's instructions that it can only be made 2 hours ahead.

I made it exactly as written and got rave reviews. This will be my default potato salad from now one.

Good potato salad! Would certainly make again.

Love this! I added apple cider vinegar rather than white wine vinegar and added dill rather than chives. Organic Red potatos insted of Yukons. It was a hit at the picnic this weekend. Be sure to pierce your potatos before you boil them for faster cooking time.

This is a great summer potato salad because there is no mayo to worry about. I have made it several times. I add more mustard and more caper juice than called for. I also added some fresh lemon juice but it doesn't need it! I bring this recipe to outdoor parties all the time. It is even better the next day!

This dish is great. Full of flavor, not heavy, a great summer salad. I made it for a decidedly not gourmet group and was nervous it might be too weird for them (as anything beyond hamburgers and hot dogs is considered exotic to these people) and even they loved it!

I was looking for side dish recipes to make without mayo or cheese. This was perfect as was the Sweet and Sour Cucumbers listed in the same issue of Bon Appetite. At a table of 8 everyone loved it. In fact, one of our guests who was from Spain said it was just like they make at home! I made the recipe exact but cubed instead of sliced the potatoes. I was able to make it 5 hours in advance. I refrigerated it and then took it out to room temperature about 45 minutes before serving.

I have made this recipe 4 times and it is always a hit. I agree with other reviews that it needs more mustard. I also make much more of the dressing because after it sits the dressing is completely absorbed by the salad. So adding the extra dressing right before you serve gives it alot more flavor! Excellent salad for a picnic or outdoor party, without the mayo, not so much concern about heat!

I thought the oil mustard dressing would be a nice change to the usual mayonnaise I use on my potato salads. Unfortunately I was disappointed with this dressing and was glad that I tried it before I put it on my salad. I added seasoning but this didn't make a difference and I ended up throwing it away and just using mayonnaise anyway.

Have made this twice now. The first time was pretty blah, so I tripled the amount of mustard, using a horseradish boosted mustard, and substituted cilantro for the parsley. Next time will add even more mustard and cilantro (I like my potato salads with some kick!). I used 2 1/2 inch diameter potatoes the first time and after 45 minutes at a full boil, they were still too crunchy for everyone. The second time I used the same sized potatoes and cooked them in my microwave steamer for 9 1/2 minutes (the steamer cooks food about 6 times as fast as other methods). The potatoes were still firm, but not crunchy.
