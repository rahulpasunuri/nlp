Flavors were wonderful, but I can't get over the "applesauce" consistency of the gravey. May try diced apples next time.

Agree with the others that the pork and sauce were amazing. The squash could have been better, but I ate it. The rest of my family skipped it. Will definitely make the sauce and pork again. This was the easiest sauce too which is a bonus.

Needed a quick and easy tenderloin recipe. I cubed and roasted the squash (tossed in EVOO and dash of sea salt.) I doubled the sauce per earlier suggestion, but kept the ingredients as written with broth(minus the agave...didn't have any.) Yum. Sauce was amazing and made the dish. Tossed roasted squash with a touch of brown sugar and butter, then mashed. Sopped up extra sauce with the squash. Pork was perfect. Try this recipe!

This is really delicious and easy to prepare! Followed the recipe for the pork & tarragon gravy exactly but changed up the butternut squash recipe a bit. Tossed squash with maple syrup, melted butter and fresh rosemary and roasted for close to an hour. Everything on the plate went perfectly together. Definitely a keeper!

This was good, with a few tweaks. I used olive oil to saute the pork because I wanted a good fond. I doubled the sauce recipe. I found the sauce was good, but needed some acid, so I added a half teaspoon of cider vinegar. That rounded out the sauce nicely. Instead of agave nectar, I used brown sugar. I thought the squash would be really bland as prepared, so I roasted it instead of microwaving to bring out more sweetness. I also added a pat of butter and some garlic powder for flavor. With those adjustments, this is a really good recipe and I'll use it again. The fiance and I both think it would be great made with nice center cut pork chops.

The pork and tarragon gravy were delicious. I used Better than Bullion chicken stock instead of apple cider for the gravy and it didn't need any salt. The mustard provided some nice spice and the whole thing was moist and flavorful. I made 2x gravy so I could really drench the meat. The butternut squash mash, however, is boring. Even with a pinch of nutmeg it still tastes like mashed pumpkin and I think it's too sweet to doctor with garlic (I did not add any agave, butternut squash is just that way on its own) and I don't know what else to do to spice up the mash, as it were.
