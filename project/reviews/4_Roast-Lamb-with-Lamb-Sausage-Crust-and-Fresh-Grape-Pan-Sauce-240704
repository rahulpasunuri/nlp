This was amazing. Definitely up there with the best lamb we've eaten, and we adore lamb. It costs a fortune, of course. We made a single rack with 11 chops-- enough for three people but no more. The savory crust is perfectly balanced by the sweet sauce. We also had trouble keeping the crust on, at least after we cut into the chops, but it didn't really matter. We did have a bit of trouble with the crumb crust burning-- perhaps our "crumbs" were a bit too big and pointy. Regardless even the crumbs were delicious.

The sausage layer fell off after cooking for me too...but I chilled for a few hours before baking. I won't do that next time. The flavor is perfect, the sauce is wonderful and the crust makes even the thinnest of racks hearty. 2 loaves of french bread yield the 2.5 cups crumbs. will do again for a special occasion since racks aren't cheap.

This recipe was fantastic! I wasn't sure that all the flavor combos would work together (especially the mustard and grape) but it was very nice! I will make it again. I made it with lamb chops rather than the lamb roast... this actually was nicer for getting more of the sausage mix over more surface area of the meat...however, the main drawback was that it was more difficult to control the meat temperature

I cook and entertain A LOT! I think this is one of the very best entrees I have ever made for a dinner party. An additional benefit is that it can be prepared THE DAY before. I did make a few slight changes however. Since this was prepared for a gourmet dinner club, I didn't want any embarrassments. I was concerned after reading one review about the crust falling off. So after searing the frenched racks, I cut them into 2 bone chops. Then proceed per the recipe. I cooked them for 12 minutes and they were done perfectly. While the lamb was resting, I roasted little clusters of grapes with rosemary sprayed with Pam in a 500 degree oven. Lovely garnish.

Next time i will ask the butcher to french the rack for me. Other than that, my guests were very complementary, and the sauce exhibited a nice blend of sweet and savory. i allowed the roast to stay in the oven until 140 degreees and i would have been better served to remove it at 135 as directed by the recipe.

My family and I thought that this recipe was excellent. It's true that the lamb crust falls off, but you can put it right back on, and the presentation is still very nice. The sauce was incredible, and the dish avoided the overly earthy flavor that lamb sometimes gets. I served it with the green risotto from this website, and it was a very impressive meal.

WOW! A delicious dish and a great presentation, not sure what happened to the previous reviewer. I've made this three times already! The sausage crust was easy to make and never moved until you cut into it on your plate. It's a very filling dish. One rack per couple cut into two double chops each is more than enough. The crust really thickens it out. The first time I made it, I used fresh bread crumbs, the last two times I subbed out to half as much as required Italian bread crumbs and I like that better. The sauce is magnificant. Not only does the sauce go great with the lamb, but if you serve this with a a big dollop of smashed red potatoes on the side you will find the sauce literally falls in love with the spuds! Heart warming and rib sticking, a great winter recipe. I could even make this a fourth time for New Years Eve, its that elegant and satisfying. Also served carrots and parsnips carmalized with a little honey, a good crusty bread and have gone between a Malbec, Cali Zin or Aussi Shiraz. YUM!

Very difficult to deal with the crust and have it stay. The lamb was tasty but the presentation was horrible.
