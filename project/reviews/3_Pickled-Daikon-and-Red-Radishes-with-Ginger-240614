These are so delicious and easy, but yes, they are STINKY -- just when you open the jar tho. Take a few out and close it up and you can just enjoy the sweet crunchy goodness.

In short ... these are really good. I HATE radishes and am not a picky eater at all but these are great. I originally discovered this because I was looking for a way to use up CSA radishes. Now I buy radishes just to make them. I like them best with just regular radishes and no daikon. The fumes are remarkable though - stinky feet x 10 - needed the exhaust fan and everything . . .

I have made this easy recipe multiple times and it's always very good. Really, it's best a week in, but I rarely wait that long. It is, however, very pungent. Open some windows before you serve it!

We've made this multiple times and not only do we like it, but everyone who has tried it does as well. I had to--and you will too-get over the fact that this stuff will stink. Whenever you open the container to toss it it will almost knock you to the floor. Once you get it out of the container and onto a plate, however, it is magic. Be brave and enjoy.

Both my husband and I thought this was excellent! Great for spring/summer. I used a bunch of Easter Radishes instead of the normal red radish. It was my first time using the easter radishes and I'm sure it would be great with either.

These pickles have a light sweet/sour and ginger taste, and turn a beautiful soft pink with time. Unfortunately, the aroma released when the container is opened is sulfurous and strong. To spare his cube mates (and himself embarrassment), hubby won't pack these in his lunch box so I won't be making them again, unless it's for a party.

This is very good and very easy. A nice dish for an Asian food dinner.

Perfect timing for this recipe to come about. I just harvested a slew of daikon and radishes from our CSA. Recipe was super easy and the rice vinegar really made the difference! I am not a fan of raw radishes (I cook mine) and this has made me a convert! Will make again on a regular basis.
