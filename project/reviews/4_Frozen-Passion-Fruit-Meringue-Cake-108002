This is one of my go to birthday cakes, especially for friends who don't eat gluten. I agree with the too sweet comments. I cut down on the sugar in the mousse I like the contrast of sweet and tangy. I also add raspberries between the layers and on top. Maykes it even prettier and adds a bit of freshness. I freeze it lightly, or let it thaw for a while before serving. Trader joe's meringues work well in a pinch.

This is a terrific dessert. I made the passionfruit mousse to the recipe but as my pulp was pre- sweetened it was a little sweet overall, so I would cut the sugar down next time. I didn't put any sugar in the whipped cream as I don't think it needs it! And I didn't make the extra passionfruit cream for the little dots on the top, I couldn't see the point and I don't think the dessert missed anything. It is a great do-ahead dessert without the usual last minute hassle you get with pavlovas.

I'm not sure if it just wasn't my day but this was more difficult to make than expected. Among other things: My cookie sheet was too small, the meringue went all over the place when using my pastry bag; I have lots of experience with meringue but I couldn't release the baked meringue from the parchment in one piece- two out of three layers broke into a million pieces. Next time I won't bake them as long and will butter the parchment first. I had lots of mousse and frosting left over. When I went to decorate the cake with the topping, the tip clogged with the passion fruit seeds so I couldn't decorate the cake as I had planned to (I live in an area that has plenty of fresh passion fruit available in season and I used fruit that I had frozen myself). The end result was a cake that looked relatively nice but rounder than the picture; the meringue was much too sweet and affected the taste of the entire cake, taking over the passion fruit flavor a bit. The mousse was delicious. I think that the frosting isn't needed and instead the whipped cream can be used by itself instead, saving some steps as well. The cake tastes great when frozen. Everyone at my party was impressed with the cake but I guess that people either love or hate passion fruit (half of my guests wouldn't try it because they hate passion fruit).

This recipe is absolutely perfect as written. If your Passionfruit Puree is unsweetened it will be very, very tart and you will need all of the sugar in the recipe. Made this for a Mother's Day Menu of Escargot App, Scallops & Leeks for Main and this as the Dessert. WOW never thought this easy little Dessert would hold it's own against the fancy App and Main, but boy did it ever. Absolutely Gorgeous and Fabulously delicious. Everyone was blown away. One last note, definitely freeze it, the firm set on the mousse really changed the taste. Will definitely make again!!!

this is a basic meringue italian and should be sweet. the one cup sugar to 4 whites is correct. the mouse is way to sweet and i reduced the sugar in that and added just a pinch of sugar in the cream. also unless you are making this ahead i see no reason to freeze it at all.

I have made this recipe twice with great success - did not change a thing in the ingredients. My only recommendation would be that when assembling, put the top meringue rectangle with the flat side down. It's much easier to frost a bumpy top (just add extra frosting to smooth it out) than it is to fill in the large gaps on the sides left by two tops merging together.

Quite an interesting dessert, with some nice flavours and textures. But we all thought it was WAY too sweet, and overpowered the lovely taste of passionfruit on the one hand, and whipped cream on the other. I have never made a meringue before with 1 cup of sugar, and there is no need for it be so sweet - next time, will use 1/4 to 1/2 cup. I think I will also reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup in the mousse. With these revisions, I think it could be an exceptional dessert.

When I stumbled upon frozen passionfruit pulp in the grocery store I figured I had to try this recipe. I'm glad I did! It's a bit time consuming but definitely worth the effort. My only issue was that my mousse was a little too soft (my fault I think) and therefore hard to cover the cake with. I should have listened to the other reviewer and put it in the freezer for a little bit first, that would have fixed the problem. I'll definitely make this again, it is really yummy!

Absolutely Delish! I make this using various kind of fruit puree and each time it gets better and better. I always add a litlle liquer to the fruit and that makes a huge diference.

I recently held a dessert party where I made 3 extravagant desserts and others brought about a dozen others. Of all the desserts, THIS went the quickest and got the most complements. The recipe needs no changing, except that the mousse can be tricky to frost with attractively. Try doing a first coat, sticking it in the freezer to firm for 20 minutes, then frosting a cleaner layer. You won't be sorry -- this rocks!

I made this for our wed. aniversary and it was good.The meringue turned out well. I used fresh kiwi fruits and add 2 tsp of cornstarch and when it was cold I added 2 Tbls of lemon juce. I'll make it again for sure but maybe not with kiwi but with strawberries.

This dessert was very showy and the guests at my dinner party all loved it. I could not find passion fruit puree so I substituted mango I had put through the food processor. It came out with bits of pulp throughout and therefore didn't look like the picture. But it was very good.

The taste is incredible. It could be made in a variety of flavors with fruit purees. Will make again and again.

Elegant and delicious! It was a little hard to locate a source for the pulp, but the shopping expedition and labor were amply rewarded by the pleasure on my parents' faces. Both are certifiable passionfruit fanatics, and they have made me promise to make this cake again for them on all upcoming birthdays. The curd/mousse is the perfect combination of sweet and tart, and could easily find its way into other dessert possibilities (with crumbled amaretto cookies on top, perhaps?). This one is a labor of love, but you will not regret the time you've spent. (By the way, I agree with the other reviewer: the less frozen parts were best, so I would move it to the refrigerator at least a few hours before serving).

This involved quite a lot of work, from memory, and is also very messy to serve. However, it is very good as a make-ahead dessert as you can freeze it for quite a few days. I served it to my housemates and they all begged for more, but it is quite sugary. I will do it again, as the effort is worthwhile, but will consider whether to assemble it in small individual ramekins before freezing, as then each person can make their own little mess.

Excellent. Made it without the cornstarch for a Passover dessert and it was a big hit with all the family. I added some creme of tartar to the meringue. It does require a lot of steps and a lot of bowls and pots but it was very popular with my family who love anything with passionfruit. I used the canned granadilla (passion fruit) pulp. I would take it out the freezer earlier than recommended as it is better when it is not quite frozen. I would also try the passionfruit mousse instead of cream in a pavlova.
