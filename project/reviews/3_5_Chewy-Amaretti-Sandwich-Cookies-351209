I am a big almond lover with a sweet tooth, so this recipe is heaven! The water did not run under all the cookies: those that got wet, stayed chewy and were easier to remove; those that didn't were harder to remove and crunchier. It was a warm summer evening and I had a hard time getting the cookies to pile this high, so they came out flatter than I expected. I froze some for later and they were just as good a few weeks later and stayed chewy.

Very interesting contrast of textures, almost like a macaroon. Not all of them came off the parchment well. Did not do the steam thing or sandwiching, seemed like a hassle. But beware of how sweet this can be. Your premade almond paste probably has a lot of sugar already in it. Would recommend cutting back on the sugar unless you are a sweet fiend. I added a couple drops of rose water for a little fragrant mystery. Looking forward to having them at tea time!

I loved this recipe! I don't think that they came out too sweet (but admittedly, I love sweet things). The almond paste gave it a wonderful flavor. My brother doesn't like dessert at all, but he ate a bunch of these. I didn't sandwich the cookies, and instead left them as cute little, single ones. I think that if I'd sandwiched them, they would have been a little overwhelming. Don't be discouraged by how small they look when you're putting them on the cookie sheet, they really expand when baked. Make sure to bake all the way through, though, I had a problem with the bottoms sticking to the parchment paper. All in all, these were a huge hit, and I'd definitely make them again.

Surprising--excellent and simple.

not a fan...the batter was hard to pipe out evenly and it turned out so sweet. i should have cut the sugar as suggested.

These are very tasty. Not drop dead delicious, but worth making more than once. I cut the sugar (2/3 cup) too, and added 1/3 cup flaked coconut which added a nice texture. Skip the sandwiching together step, the beautifully browned bottoms add to the chewiness.

Nice, unusal cookie with a great crunchy-outside-chewy-inside texture. You have to really like the taste of almond paste though - they are very sweet and can be overpowering (I made large versions). On second thought I would make them smaller, as the recipe suggests.

These were tasty and very easy, but I had a couple of problems. I had to make my own almond paste as I couldn't find any here, and I think it was too sweet; my cookies came out almost too chewy and sweet, I would be inclined to agree with reducing the sugar in the recipe. Part of my cookies' problem may also have been down to a parchment malfunction: When I swapped the top sheet for the bottom, the paper tried to slide off, and in the subsequent delay in closing the oven door, I could see the cookies deflate.

Great cookie. Reduced sugar to 2/3 cup and dust with confectioner's sugar before putting into the oven. Used silpat mats so didn't have to steam cookie off the sheet, however make sure cookies cool completely on the mats, otherwise they will stick and tear.

Wonderful cookie! Followed directions exactly, including steaming the cookie from the parchment paper. I got 50 individual cookies.

I made 1/2 of this recipe & 1/2 of Joy of Cookings amaretti cookies. No comparison! These are the best! Chewier & easier. Mine were about 1 inch and required a bit longer cooking time. I would be very careful not to overcook. Stop when they are manilla folder color. I agree w/ other readers that the water technique does help them to stick together, but is not necessary if you don't mind single cookies. Mine did not get the cracked top but tasted fine.

These were awesome if you like chewy cookies. Followed the recipe exactly and they came out great. Almond flavor is delicious. You don't need to steam the cookies off the parchment. If you dont mind picking them off and getting a bit dirty, this step can be skipped. Steaming them actually ruined some of my cookies because they got too wet. The cookies stick easily together without steaming too. This does make about 4 dozed sandwiches, but they are tiny and they dont really look like 4 doz cookies. I would double the recipe if bringing these to a party.

Definite points for being easy to make! After cook179's review, I tried making these two ways: once with the parchment as instructed and once with just a greased pan. the parchment didn't really stick to them when i made them; i found popping them off right after pouring the water and then letting them cool seemed to keep them from sticking. the cookies also were flatter and more crinkly on top when baked this way. the ones on the pan were obviously a lot easier to take off the pan, but they also were smooth on top and had a slight inverted-cup shape. not terrible or anything, but i think they looked better the parchment way. sandwiching two plain cookies together seemed kind of silly to me, so i made a lemon-lime glaze and used that in the middle. after a while, i just decided to skip sandwiching them and drizzled the glaze on top. called them "amaretto sour" cookies. ;) flavor was delicious, texture was light and chewy. A definite keeper!

Let me start off by saying that the cookies turned out to be delicious! Love the easy batter recipe. Unfortunately the process itself turned into a 3 hour venture - the cookies stuck permanently to the parchment! Since these were made for a work function, I could just imagine what the coworkers would say if they find any trace of paper in these.. Therefore I spent the better part of the evening scraping the bottoms and disguising misshaped halves with chocolate. The good news is that the combination of the almost cookie with high-quality melted chocolate is stellar and almost makes up for the presentation. I think I will try these again in the future with silicone bakeware, perhaps that would work better.

This is an excellent recipe. Super quick and easy to make, delicious and crunchy-yet-chewy. I took these to work and everyone raved. I didn't bother with steaming them off the pan as I didn't sandwich them, just served as individual small cookies. But I can see lots of good opportunities for this - sandwich with chocolate ganache, for instance? A definite winner!

This is a "grown-up" cookie: easy to make, not cloyingly sweet and not too calorie-laden. Just fab!

Oh my gosh, they turned out perfect and tasty. Will def- make again. Their light but rich at the same time. Chewy too. Great with a cup of tea.

I only ended up with about 45 cookies (not sandwiches) - maybe I made them too large? At any rate, I did not sandwich them, and they are delicious.
