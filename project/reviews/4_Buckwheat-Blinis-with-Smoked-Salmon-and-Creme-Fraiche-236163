We love these! I make them every new year's eve to feast on with caviar and Champagne.

These went like, uh, hotcakes! Perfect substantial appetizer for a small crowd. People ate way more than I was expecting, though... next time I'll double the recipe (for 20 people). DO take note of previous reviewers' comments abt exploding batter if you are planning to refrigerate. It's true - the stuff has a life of its own. Caught it in time, tho', and am glad I did. Will definitely make again.

Has become a Christmas Eve standard for us. My partner loves the blini. Sometimes make without the salmon roe--not as interesting, but still delicious.

This is delicious. We intended to serve it as an appetizer course but got so full after this that we skipped our main course. We found that we needed much more salmon that 4 oz for the amount of batter in this recipe. Did not make any modifications. This is a great thing to have in the fridge to throw together a quick appetizer for guests or for lunches or leftovers. Make the batter in advance and just make them fresh as needed or make the blinis in advance and quickly heat them up. This is definitely going to be a regular in our house.

Fantastic! Made the blinis much smaller -- three out of each tablespoon of batter -- so I ended up with ~70 blinis.

Absolutely delicious, I ate the blinis without adornment and loved every bite. The only downside is that the buckwheat does make the blini an unappetizing grey.

This was a hit with my Christmas eve fish celebration. They went quickly and were quite tasty. Some work to make the blini but was good

Close to the one's I ate in Moscow. They were more buttery and about the size of a silver dollar. The recipe makes far more than 12 if made the appropriate size. 2T of batter is at least twice too much, so this will make 24+ blini. Next time I'll try one of the other recipes on this site that use a 1 to 1 ratio of buckwheat to all purpose ratio.

Just like my grandmother made (we are Germans from Russia) when I was growing up. We would eat blinis dipped in cream or maple syrup.
