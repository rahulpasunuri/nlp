Great recipe - fast & easy and appealed to all family members except the toddler... I used apple cider vinegar instead of tarragon vinegar, and used dried tarragon (all I have in the winter). But it worked out very nicely.

Made this with sole, which I love with tarragon. It was so quick and so tasty! Made it as described for the family and with no butter for myself - still really good (although obviously not AS good) with a squeeze of lemon.

A simple recipe. Tarragon and trout, who knew. At least in the summer, when I have some fresh tarragon in the garden this will be my staple trout recipe... It even rescued "supermarket" trout. I found that one tablespoon of butter per fish was plenty. I did it on the gril, but used a baking pan. I hate to heat up the kitchen with oven in the summer for something that cooks in 8 minutes. It worked perfectly.

Very good. We grilled it rather than baking and served it with a wild rice/jasmine rice blend and a Mediterranean cucumber bake. Turned out great.

A simple variation for trout - very seasonable and fresh.

So easy and delicious. Very light. A great Summer time dinner. I served this with brussel sprouts and a green salad.
