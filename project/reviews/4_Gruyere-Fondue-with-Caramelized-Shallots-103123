Best fondue ever. I love shallots, but didn't need quite the quantity indicated. I usually have a problem with consistency, but thie recipe was perfect with a tad extra cheese. Served with baguette pieces, veggies and low-fat chicken sausage - hah! Not a lo-cal meal, but worth the decadence.

The addition of caramelized shallots is what has been missing from my fondue recipes! What a wonderful addition. Used 1/2 gruyere and 1/2 emmenthal and it was perfect. At first thought the cheese seemed too runny but it was great once it was in the fondue pot. Served with wonderful bread and grilled kielbasa. YUMMY!

it is without a doubt the best fondue I've ever had the pleasure to taste!

I will never go back to plain cheese fondue! My grocery store did not have shallots in stock, so I caramelized a red onion instead. We also cut the recipe in half and it fed two people perfectly. This recipe works really well with vegetables...the steamed broccoli recommendation goes perfectly with this recipe.

It seemed average to me. I used it as an appetizer and it cost over $20 for the cheese and hardley anyone touched it. I will not make it again.

I halved the recipe, and it was the perfect amount for two people. Used cave-aged gruyere - delicious. Took other reviewers' advice and served with steamed broccoli, steamed cauliflower, roasted potatoes, sourdough bread cubes, pears, and sauteed chicken apple sausage. Wonderful!

Loved this recipe - so easy and delicious. I served it for dinner for 5 people and increased the amount by half. It was just enough to serve 5 and next time I would consider doubling the recipe - and so what if there are leftovers?! I served the fondue with bread, blanched broccoli, sauteed chicken sausage, apples and boiled fingerling potatoes. With a bibb lettuce salad and lots of prosecco this made for a lovely evening!

Delicious. The caramelized shallots turn this fondue from good to outstanding! I used half emmental and half gruyere, added 1 Tbsp Chambord, and completely forgot to add the nutmeg. It earned raves from my husband's kids, which is a rare and wonderful event! This will now be a regular for our Fondue Sundays!

This was delicious, and I would definitely make it again. I also used Emmental cheese along with the gruyere and skipped the nutmeg. http://megan- deliciousdishings.bl ogspot.com/2007/10/f irst-dish.html

I prepared this last night for friends and they loved it! I did change it just a bit, though: used 3/4lb gruyere, 1/4lb swiss & 1/2lb shallots. I also found I did not have nutmeg, so sprinkled just a little Pumpkin Pie spice in. Served with Eyrie Vineyards Pinot Gris which was a great complement.

This recipe is fantastic. Everyone oouldn't get enough. I served it as an appetizer for 6 people and I think it could have stretched to serve 8. As a main, I think 4 servings is right on.

Fabulous. I doubled the recipe, only used one pan (le Creuset) and added some finely minced shiitakes to the shallot mixture. I took it to a large putluck in a cuisinart fondue pot on LOW and served it with the usual potatoes, bread, apples and veg. It was devoured, and the pot moved to the kitchen for additional eating during clean-up. I did hold back a little wine and it was still not too thick.

Rating: 4
I have 7 fondue pots, and this is the delectable, pungent, creamy ambrosia that usually fills them! Ridiculously easy to prep in advance (esp. if you use the Cuisinart to grate the cheese) and always a hit with guests. I add at least half again as many caramelized shallots as called for, and serve it with lightly steamed broccoli, boiled red/purple/fingerling potatoes, chicken apple sausage and/or apple slices in addition to a loaf of crusty Acme rustic sour. Heaven!

made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. you may want to keep a little extra cheese on hand, i ended up adding more than called for to thicken up the finished fondue a bit.

The shallots elevate this from "just another fondue" to a household favourite, while keeping preparation simple.

I've made this twice now and each time it was devoured. We've used toasted sourdough cubes and roasted small red potatoes (garlic & rosemary). The first time we made it, we used a combination of Gruyere and Swiss cheese because we're poor college students. It still came out wonderfully.

I have never made a fondue before. I received a fondue pot for Christmas and thought I would give it a try .. so tonight I divided this recipe in half beings I was only cooking for my 8yr old son and myself .. I was nervous if it would work since Ive read warnings on doubling fondue recipes. Also instead of a white wine I used Latah Creeks Maywine. It turned out perfectly. It was so delicious my son ate more than half of it and begged me to make it again. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes fondues and definitely to first timers. Trust me when I say you really can not go wrong .. if it looks like its never going to thicken up just be patient and slowly finish adding all your cheese .. you will have a wonderfully easy and very tasty dinner to enjoy.

A wonderful, simple but impressive recipe. The tang and slight sweetness of the shallots really make this something special, and apart from all that grating, it takes no time at all. A rich, satisfying and very social meal!

We make this dish with half gruyere, half emmenthal and love it for Valentine's Day!! Served it with cubed Italian bread, blanched pearl onions, asparagus, and boiled baby fingerlings-incredible!!! We finish a whole pot on St. V's day, year after year and feel GREAT afterwards. Try it!

This is the first highly rated Epicurious recipe to turn out disastrously for me; usually this doesn't happen. The fondue started out well and was smooth and velvety. Then the burner beneath the fondue pot briefly went out and floury clumps appeared throughout the fondue, which I could not get rid of, even after relighting the flame. Ended up as a disaster. Shallots are an interesting touch but disappointed the purists in my group, who complained.

Wonderful recipe. The shallots make this fondue. I couldn't believe how easy this was to make. My guests were impressed. To the cook in Boston; I would not make this too far ahead. Cheese gets kind of oily when you melt and keep it melted for a long time. I would just make the fondue about 2 hours (at most) ahead and just keep it in a saucepan on the lowest setting you can get. Good luck!

This fondue had a distinct aroma for a romantic valentine's at home. I added chopped garlic and split between gruyere and emmenthal cheeses. Carmelized onions were a nice touch. Ate with french bread and made fondue in a crock pot. Turned out better than I thought though you can't save it at all, turns into a hard grease ball you don't want to look at.

This fondue is really nice. It was deliscious with bread for dipping as well as veggies. Any fine meat strips would also be delicious. Gruyere is, however, a very potent cheese. The smell stayed in my kitchen for a few days, literally, but it was worth it.

Hi people, I haven't made this yet, and I have a question: could I make this in advance, i.e., the shallots and the mix up to transfering the mix to the fondue pot? What would happen if I do this, say, a few hours before my guests arrive? Can someone help me out here? Thanks in advance...

I made this a few weeks ago as a surprise for my husband and we both loved it! We dipped small sausages, steamed broccoli, red pepper strips and sourdough bread. We finished the entire pot between the TWO of us. Our stomachs ached a bit, but it was worth it...lol!

My husband liked the dish, as he does all cheese fondue, but we weren't big on the carmelized shallots. I found that it made the fondue too sweet.

made for New Years dinner- very good - used half Emmenthaler and half fontina. Did not get stringy - but I agree with the reviewer who said that this is the result of using good, well aged cheeses.

Made this on New Year's day for my family. The 50/50 mixture of Gruyere and Emmenthal works really well. I have finally found a fondue recipe that is truly a winner!

Rating: 4
Used to 50/50 Gruyere/Emmenthal (swiss) cheese mix and added a tad extra sugar to the shallots to mellow the recipe a bit. The results were very good. The carmelized shallots add a very interesting counterpoint to the sharpness of the Gruyere (which was still very prominent despite the Emmenthal).

Well...I lied! I haven't tried this recipe, but I'm going to for Christmas Day next week! ...wanted to let others know what I'm planning on serving with the fondue in addition to crusty french bread. I'm serving cooked chunks of link sausage and steamed brussel sprouts. The sprouts and cheese have worked well with cheese fondue for a "fuller" meal. If time permits I am also going to make the "Bacon Onion Rolls" from "Fondues from Around the World" to also dip in the fondue. HAPPY HOLIDAYS!

A scrumptious variation of a basic fondue recipe. I've made it for parties and people always ask me about it, often saying its the best cheese fondue they've ever had.

Rating: 3
used a mix (half and half) of Gruyere and Emmenthal to make it mellower. The shallots definitely add a nice twist to the recipe. Very easy to make. However, I had it as the only dish in a dinner for four people and I think in the end we were all still craving for a bit more. I couldn't think of side dishes that would be natural matches to fondue.

I served this as an appetizer on Christmas Eve and it was a big hit! My father-in-law and I were fighting for the last bit out of the fondue pot. The shallots really made it tasty. I added a little extra wine while it we dipped into the fondue pot so that it didn't thicken too much. It was really a treat!

I made this dish for a tennis luncheon at our club and all of the ladies loved it! The suggestion of the red-skinned potatoes was a good idea, also. I didn't bring a fondue pot, though, but actually microwaving it a bit before serving worked fine.
