To the "too-much-salt" commenters: Get a dictionary and look up the words "rinse" and "thoroughly". To the "very runny" commenter: look up the words "drain" and "well".

Really too salty. Maybe cut out some of the mustard for olive oil, but definitely too salty as is. Blech.

I skipped the salting stage and added 1/2 of a small red onion (cut into very small dice) at the end. The Dijon made for a perky alternative to creamy cucumber salads and its an easy and tasty accompaniment to grilled fish...Ignore the haters!

Not sure why others were fusing. Great dressing and perfect for the cukes. The mustard dressing would also be fab with salmon. I used dried dill but probably even better with fresh. Try it!

WAY too much mustard for 2 cukes. Terrible.

Too much salt, too much mustard.

Nice, but go for the Magyar style!
