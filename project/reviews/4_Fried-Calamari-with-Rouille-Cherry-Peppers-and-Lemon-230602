LOVED IT!!! We weren't sure what to do with the calamari we bought and I found this recipe.e Amazingly we had everything to make it! It is VERY zesty and we have a pretty high tolerance for heat. This will be on my next dinner party menu but I'll greatly cut down the crushed red pepper in the cherry peppers and perhaps the cayenne in the rouille. absolutely loved it!!!

Delicious! Best calamari I've ever had and even the kids devoured it and asked for more.

Yummm! Yeah, it's messy, but it always is when you fry food at home. I used pepprocini's instead of the cherry peppers, in honor of RI, where I grew up. The rouille is a great addition to this sauce.

This dish left my husband and I discussing "what can we do different next time?" Our entire family LOVES fried calamari when we go out to eat and we were hoping to replicate it at home. Unfortunately, this recipe did not quite make the grade. The rouille sauce was too bitter, with the abundance of paprika. And we didn't really care for the cornmeal in the breading, although I could see how that is a matter of personal preference. The calamari WAS very tender and, I thought, tasty. Clean-up was a nightmare, but this is expected when deep-frying in the kitchen. Basically...I think it's back to "square-one" with this one. This may be just one of those dishes best prepared in a commercial kitchen.

Excellent - especially the rouille. I prefer the calamari fried in canola oil rather than vegetable.

This was delicious! My boyfriend & I inhaled it - and I'm normally not one for fried foods. Will definitely be making again.

The "Quick Rouille" is quick, easy and the taste is beyond fantastic. This rouille is not only excellent for dipping calamari, but other foods such as veggies or fries.
