Delicious--my husband is a Kalamata olive fan, however I think it needs more kick, so I will add more red pepper and garlic next time. I added lemons in the cavity (I can't help myself) and with two earlier reviews--this is not a pretty dish, so carve it separately and this recipe makes a lot of olivada so be sure to use a spoon so it's not contaminated.

The best roasted chicken I have made & possibly ever eaten. I am a big fan of olives & already had a homemade tapinade in the fridge that I thought would be perfect for the purpose. I salted the chicken and allowed it to sit at room tempeture for about 1/2 hour before patting it dry & putting the tapinade beneath the skin & the chicken into the roasting pan (breast side down, which no recipe ever specifies & maybe it's just common sense, but it took me a couple of birds til I figured it out) & in the last ten minutes took the lid off & broiled it. I also put lemon halves & an onion in the cavity. It came out perfectly succulent & a wonderfully crispy skin. Such a treat! I'm serving it as part of a sort of deconstructed chicken & rice soup. I've been sick all week but I'm already feeling better(:

This was tasty! The chicken was moist and the olivada added just the right oomph! The gravy was a nice touch as well.

Exceptional - the suace was the highlight,spicy and flavourful even if you are familiar with "Mediterranean" cooking

Rating: 2
This was very flavorful but not exceptional if you are familiar with Meditarrean cooking. I used "Tuscan" dried seasoning, because i did not have fresh rosemary, but it is a great blend. I put lemon juice in the pan as I deglazed and it was nice. I would use more garlic next time.

A total winner! Just finished dinner and had to sit down and write a review it was so good. I did reduce the olive oil by about half. The chicken was moist and the olives really mellowed (I didn't add salt because of the olives). I would serve this for company. And easy, too!

This was SO tasty! My husband and I loved it. I added a quartered lemon to the cavity of the bird and the whole bird, even the breasts, was really juicy and wonderfully tasty. I will definitely make this again soon!!!

Delicious!!! I forgot to add the crushed red peppers but I don't think it lacked anything. I omitted the olive oil. Since the chicken skin itself is pretty oily I don't think it needed it. Served it with steamed broccoli and wild/brown rice.

Delicious! Wonderful recipe! I made rice to put the gravy on. Chicken and gravy both are delicious! Definetly use the Kalamata Olives.

Awesome. The chicken was super juicey and flavorful. I added, onion, carrots and large potatos to the pot. It was a tastey treat with the gravy. Really easy to make and a tru keeper.

this is a wonderful roast chicken recipe, earthy and rich and luxurious. I served it with polenta with truffle oil and and wonderful big Argentinian Red wine.

I really don't know what to think about this dish. It was fairly tasty, but it was not attractive, not something you would want to put in the center of the table. Instead, you'd want to cut it up in the kitchen when no one's looking. I doubt I'll make it again simply because there are so many other ways to roast chicken that are more satisfying. FYI: I did not bother to mmake the gravy.

I thought this dish came out wonderfully. I made the olivada with a little bit of rosemary and garlic and used all of it on the chicken-the result was highly flavorful and gourmet. I served this with a roasted beet and goat cheese salad for an amazing dinner. This recipe is super easy to make, especially if you make your olivada with a food processor. For the reviewer who used black olives, I would suggest not cutting corners on this recipe and using the proper ingredients before reviewing next time.

Made it as written. This recipe is a whole lot of work and mess for a mediocre result. Flavors did not meld, and the olive paste looked pretty unappetizing. Tip: The recipe makes too much olivada. I started rubbing it onto the raw chicken before I realized there would be extra, so the whole batch had to be thrown out even though I only used about half of it on the chicken.

Rating: 2
I tried cutting corners because I was too lazy to go to the store - with plain black olives and dried rosemary, and it had zero flavor, so for the reviewer who asked about that, the answer is no, don't bother. I will try it again with the right ingredients and hope to get the raves that others have.

My go-to company dish. I use split chicken breasts and serve it with roasted vegetables-soooo good. To the person who had trouble pitting the olives: lay one down on a cutting board, slam it with a knife. The olive will split and pulling out the pit is easy.

Great taste for such a quick and easy dish. The gravy was a hit too.

Absolutely amazing! Honestly the best roast chicken I've ever had and very easy to make. My only alteration was using the tapenade and putting a cut lemon with thyme in the cavity. The lemon cut into the richness of the sauce just a little and enhanced it I think. I used all the same other ingredients as stated and am so grateful I tried this recipe. I live in Spain where this is not your average dish and the Spanish are frequently not interested in non Spanish food in my experience. However, in the 3 times I've made this I have rocked their tastebuds and made converts. Now I have people saying they're not going to be happy not having my cooking all the time which is just what a home chef (sort of) wants to hear. Definitely try this recipe. It's moist, flavorful, intriguing, and best of all pretty simple.

So flavorful! I was also lazy and used tapenade with rosemary and pepper. The gravy is the finishing touch. Paired it with Chinese broccoli with Ginger and it was the perfect dinner

Great recipe! First chicken I've cooked in ages (just huge turkeys), and it turned out succulent. I changed the recipe in a few ways: used a 4.5 lb. chicken (organic free range) and adjusted all ingredient amounts accordingly except garlic; used a mix of rosemary and thyme in the olive spread; used half the amount of red pepper (wasn't spicy at all, so I'd use the whole amount next time); used less salt (olives are so salty); rubbed some of the extra olive paste in the cavity and added two lemon quarters and some sprigs of thyme and parsley; and added cut-up potatoes to the roasting pan. I roasted at 425 for about 45 minutes then went down to 375, afraid I was going to dry out the bird. All together, I roasted it for an hour and 20 minutes, which I think was too much at that temperature, but the meat was still sooooo moist and juicy it was incredible. (The amount of liquid that collected in the bottom of the pan was a bit disturbing, but I usually stuff birds, so perhaps that's the difference.) I served the bird with lemon-caper sauteed brussels sprouts, string beans with caramelized shallots and sundried tomatoes, and the roasted potatoes. The taste was fabulous; my only reservations about this recipe involve the messiness of it (getting all that black paste under the skin is a challenge, and also it gets everywhere when you carve and serve the bird, which is visually unappealing) and the oiliness mentioned in other reviews-- you could probably cut down on the amount of olive oil. But the delicious flavors are worth it! I'd give three and a half stars if I could.

Outstanding. I used chicken breasts but other than that followed the recipe as presented. Will definelty make again.

I made this for my husband for our anniversary dinner and it was sensational! I actually took a short cut with the olivada and used store-bought olive tapenade to save time and added rosemary & red pepper flakes as it didn't have those ingredients in the tapenade. The chicken turned out so moist & juicy. We loved it! I served it with thyme-roasted sweet potatoes (another epicurious recipe) which was a great complement to the chicken.

Terrific recipe. I used leftover marinated black and green olives (in Italian herbs, balsamic vinegar and olive oil) for the Olivada. The leftover chicken and olives made a delicious chicken strata the next day, topped with leftover gravy.

Excellent chicken recipe. I omitted the red pepper becuase I don't like it, and it was fine. Frsh rosemary is a must.

OH - very good! There were just the two of us so I just used two breast halves. Very moist, very flavorful, no one flavor dominated. Served boiled parslied red potatoes with it and a bleu cheese wedge salad to start.

This dish was very easy to prepare and the results were quite pleasing. It was a hit. I will definitely be making this again. I will likely try some variations. Perhaps a touch of Sherry, Marsala or Madiera in the Olivada.

DELICIOUS!!! I had a lot of guesta and so I made 2 chickens. With the second one I wanted to try something a little different- so I substituted sun dried tomatoes for the olives. It was delicious.

This recipe is great but it does need more garlic. I actually had olivada left over and made it again, adding dijon mustard to it and spreading it on the outside of the chicken so that it formed a crust. It was really delicious and received much greater praise than the original recipe. Keeps the chicken very moist.

Rating: 4
What a hit! This recipe turned chicken into something special. I combined some of the suggestions from other reviewers and added pine nuts, 2 anchovy filets, extra garlic, and cut the rosemary by about 25 percent. I also stuffed the bird with a half a lemon, a garlic clove and a rosemary sprig.

Rating: 3
This was a hit. But I couldn't find pitted Kalamata olives - so I pitted them myself -- too much work. Would this be good with just black olives? Or a mix of black and green?

Rating: 4
I've now made this several times and it's always fabulous - even the breasts are moist, flavorful and delicious. (My husband and I are both of the "chicken breasts are dry, dull and tasteless" school of thought.) I had to cook the chicken longer than recommended both times - not sure why. I usually have a fair amount of the olivada left over, and sauteeing the excess in additional olive oil (to be sure any cross contamination from handling it with the raw chicken was killed)and serving it with either the chicken or cedar-planked grilled salmon has been a real hit as well.

I was intrigued by the olive paste which definitely gives the chicken some full flavor. However, I wasn't overwhelmed with this dish. It is quite easy to prepare. I may experiment with some other rubs or pastes under the skin.

I had never made roast chicken before (hard to believe, I know!) and decided to start with this recipe - actually I combined this recipe with another one (which I customarily do) "Roast Chicken with Olives and Potatoes" Bon Appetit, March 1991 (also found on Epicurious) and it turned out amazing! My husband loved it and I will definitely make it again. It was easy to make (although, a little time consuming to prepare - but maybe it's just me). Also, I used a pre-made olive paste to save time and it turned out perfectly.

I loved it! But the hubby hated it (probably tasted to Mediterranean for him). He found the olive and olive oil too greasy and overpowering.

This was the best chicken I have ever tasted! I'm not a chicken lover, but this was AMAZING. I did have to cook it longer than the recipe called for, but other than that it was great. This one is a definite keeper!

This was great! I quadrupled the amount of garlic, rosemary and red pepper in the paste, however, because the flavor of Kalamata olives is so overpowering. I also rubbed additional garlic and rosemary on the outside of the bird, along with the olive oil. (I love garlic!) This is delicious paired with the Roasted Potatoes with Crimini and Porcini Mushrooms, also found on this site.

Rave reviews all around. I'm planning to try it again with duck.

This chicken recipe was a great idea to which i added my own twist: first, i blended in a handful of pignoli nuts to the olivada mixture. i stuffed a halved lemon, rosemary stems and a handful of parsley inside the bird before cooking. 15 minutes before it was done, i smeared the entire chicken with garlic that i had roasted and mashed. It was a real treat and much easier than i expected. Served with a few extra kalamata olives, the taste was outrageous.

I would actually give this three and a half forks. I really enjoyed this and so did my husband. I did find that I had to cook the chicken longer than the recipe called for. I found it to be flavorful, but not spicy. I would consider adding more red pepper, but really it was fine as is. I would definitely make this again.

Very good. We all love olives and it made a nice addition to a roast chicken. I love tapenade regardless, but I th ink this would be a good one for someone who isn't crazy about it. My husband is very picky about his chicken and he like this one.

Rating: 2
This was a good alternative way to cook ever present chicken. However, despite the wonderful kalamata olives, the taste was a bit bland. I was expecting a much more complex blend of greek inspired flavors. If you make this recipe, be sure to add a bit more salt and/or serve with a spicy side dish to liven up your overall meal. I may consider cooking it again and topping it with well seasoned carmelized onions.

Rating: 4
This dish was absolutely wonderful! It was really easy, i followed recipe exactly and it came out perfect. The flavor was outstanding and the chicken nice and juicy. I doubled the olive paste recipe and gave half to my mom so she could make it also. I served it with roasted veggies: fingerling potatoes, baby carrots, onions ,and zuccini. I will make this again for sure.

Absolutley delicious... and the aromas coming from the oven were wonderful. The next day's leftovers made a delicious chicken sandwich as the flavours had time to settle. MMMM!

This has become my stand-by, no-fail, sure-to-impress dinner party entree. I've fixed it 4 times this year, each time with rave reviews. I enjoy it so much I always roast 2 chickens at the same time and freeze the second one whole. It freezes amazingly well, though the frozen one is only reserved for quiet winter evenings with just my husband and I.

This was a delightful dish to make during our huge snowstorm yesterday. It was easy, delicious and the aroma while cooking was wonderful. It doesn't need other spicy side dishes to compete. Your taste buds need a little rest! I roasted potatoes but I think plain or subtly flavored rice would be even better.

This was a great dish. I have served it twice now to rave reviews. Plus, it is remarkably easy.

I made this earlier in the week and my husband and I just loved it. I'm so dissapointed the leftovers are gone already. This was a piece of cake to make as well. I followed the recipe exactly and had wonderful results. I might add more red pepper next time. I served this with roasted sweet potato, red potato, and red and yellow peppers (see Nigelle Bites cookbook). It was delicious!
