Potatoes are gluten-free. Overmashing them will make them heavy and glue-like, but there is no gluten (from grains wheat, rye and barley) involved. White or red potatoes work best in this recipe. Stick to Russets for baking.

Personally I like to use white pepper to avoid speckled potatoes. Also, note that there is no gluten in potatoes; it is a protein found in things like wheat and barley. Using a food processor simply frees up the starch from the potato, allowing water into it and creating a stickier product. In culinary school we called such potatoes "whipped" instead of "mashed" which are lumpy like this wonderfully simple recipe.

Great basic recipe, especially for beginners like me. Adding a bit of roasted garlic also adds some punch.

A bit bland. Guess I'm used to my Southern style (and very butter) mashed potatoes. These needed the gravy.

Great basic recipe. Best part is they held up in a double boiler longer than I intended. They did stiffen a bit, but just add a little more warm milk, whip 'em again, adjust seasoning and they're ready when you are.
