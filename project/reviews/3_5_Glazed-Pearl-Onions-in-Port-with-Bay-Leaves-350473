Like wolnerman I used the frozen pearl onion. This was an extra side dish at our Thanksgiving table. I made it two days ahead but it still was just a so- so addition to the meal.

Very easy to make if you use the peeled frozen pearl onions. I made this two days before Thanksgiving per other suggestions that it was better a few days later. I had some last night after making it. It just might rate 4 forks in two days.

We had this last year at Thanksgiving and again at Christmas. Great! Everyone loved them and can't wait to have them again this holiday season.

Next time, I'll listen to Chef Lapin. The peeling took forever and became more of a group project (by necessity) than I would have expected. I also wish I had made ahead, given both the time required and the suggestion that the flavor would deepen overnight -- on the day they were made, I thought they were somewhat bland.

Don't peel small onions or shallots. Saute lightly with their skins in a skillet, then "rough them up" with a terry cloth towel.The peeling comes right off. (Chef Lapin)

I prefer pearl onions that have been carmelized in butter, I would consider carmelizing them and then tossing them in the bayleaf and port reduction!

Wonderful! A big hit at Thanksgiving. I agree with others who wrote that this gets better in a day or two.

Loved this--I used two bags of frozen pearl onions--easy, and I don't think there would be much difference in the finished dish. Just make sure to not over cook them. Also, it's much better the second and third day--definitely a make ahead dish. And you don't need tons--this is really a condiment or pickle kind of thing--people just take a spoonful of it.

Fabulous! This was a big hit and I really loved since I made this 2 days before Thanksgiving.

I hope to try this out this weekend, but given a previous comment, I will peel the onion using the technique from Gratineed Mustard Creamed Onions, from this site. I found those quite easy to peel.

This was so delicious and a beautiful dish both in the preparation stages and in the final.

I loved this dish and so did my family at our Canadian Thanksgiving dinner. While a simple recipe, peeling the onions took a long time. Also, if you double this recipe it becomes pretty expensive. Best for a small dinner party! I will definitely make this again.
