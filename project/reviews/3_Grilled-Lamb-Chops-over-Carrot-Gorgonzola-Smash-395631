This was pretty good...although I would say as written this is very light for a meal. I went up to 8 lamb chops and a few extra carrots, to serve 4. I served roasted sunchokes and an arugula salad alongside. I steamed rather than boiled the carrots, and I would probably use a blender or food processor next time for a more elegant presentation. I also used more gorgonzola, since I could barely taste it as written. I suppose if serving such sparing portions as indicated by the recipe you might keep the cost under $20; but my lamb alone was $27...but the only place I could find it easily was at Whole Foods. All in all and easy and elegant meal.

This was good but after a few changes it was great. I don't know how this is supposed to feed 6 people. I doubled the carrots and still only had enough for 3 people. I felt like the carrots needed something, so I sauteed a shallot, added it into the carrots and then they went from okay to something I will make over and over. Lamb is a splurge for us, but the carrots (with shallots) I will make again very soon.
