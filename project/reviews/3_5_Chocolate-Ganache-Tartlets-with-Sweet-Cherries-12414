This recipe is absolutely great, but I played around with it a little. a) Made my own pâte sucreé, b) decided the original filling was too soft and not chocolatey enough c) Increased the chocolate by 1/3rd. This is gorgeous! d) Simplified recipe by adding all the cream to the first (choc melting) step. Whipped it when cold and set, then added a little whipped cream. e) Swirled the set-aside choc in circles over the tartlets. Sinfully delicious! Whipping the choc cream was an inspired idea by one of the cookery editors!!
