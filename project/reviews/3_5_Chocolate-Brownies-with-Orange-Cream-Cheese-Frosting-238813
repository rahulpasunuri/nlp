just made this and it was divine!. The brownies were fudgey but not too sweet. The cream cheese icing was light and not overly sweet or overly cream cheesy tasting. I actually doubled the recipe and made it in a jelly roll pan and it was about an inch to inch half thick, chocolaty but not cake like. The only changes I made was adding maybe 1/8 tsp of cinnamon and using both brown and white sugar, and 5 eggs for a double batch. this is my new brownie recipe!

After reading the reviews, I made these in a 9 inch square pan. Were wonderful...after reducing the sugar by half.

These were a little thin, very fudgy and rich. Too sweet and too rich for me. I love the orange cream cheese frosting, but I will keep searching for another brownie recipe.

2/3 cup of flour does not seem like anywhere near enough for a 9 x 11 pan. I will try these by making one and a half times the recipe, but stick to the regular recipe for the icing. (I think doubling the recipe might be a bit too much)

I followed this recipe to the T, and while the brownies taste great, the batter barely covered the bottom of the 9 x 13 pan! I made these to take to a 4th of July party tonight, but guess I will be stopping by Costco as these are as thin as a pancake. I do live in Colorado (i.e.high altitude)but normally a touch of extra flour does the trick- not doubling the recipe! I saw one other good review from Denver- I would be interested to see if that person also had "brownie pancakes". Taste great, but not enough batter to go around.

These are spectacular and so easy! I could barely get these unwrapped before my coworkers were gobbling them up! Found that they were actually better the next day. Yay!

These brownies were fantastic, made exactly as written. I'm already planning for the next time I can make them!

These were very good and the orange cream cheese frosting was a nice twist. It gave the brownies a delicious flavor that was different from the 'same old, same old.' The brownie itself ended up being a bit too rich for my palate but it was still yummy. This was very easy to make.

These brownies were fantastic. I wouldn't change a thing. I used Ghiradelli chocolate (one of my favorites) which gave the brownies a rich, creamy texture. Awesome!

I made these brownies for a family dinner. I used a stoneware baking pan and the texture was great! Of course everyone loved them. Will definately make again.

I made these for a neighborhood cookout and got rave reviews. I skipped the foil lining and just sprayed my nondisposable pan with Baker's Joy. I had no difficulty getting the iced brownies out of the pan and the texture was good. I also left off the toppings because someone had a nut allergy and a lot of people have strong feelings about coconut. Otherwise, I followed the recipe for the brownie and frosting exactly, and they were very good. Thanks to the frosting, they felt a little more special occaision than a standard brownie. Was asked to share the recipe and will make again.

to novia scotia- i understand your point. if you bake in a foil pan, the brownies should dislodge easily enough without having to line the pan with foil. i would think you could do one or the other- either cook in a disposible pan, or cook in a non-disposible pan and line with foil. if you do both, it's just extra insurance. maybe the recipe creator has shares in aluminum stock. any way, if brownies do stick to the pan, then there's more for the cook.

I enjoyed the brownies. The extra foil is so you can lift out the brownies and use it as a "handle". Pretty clever.

To Nova Scotia: The foil aids in removing the brownies when baked and cooled. The recipe states - use the foil overhangs as handles etc etc. Easy part to overlook when reading the recipe.

I don't understand why both a disposable aluminum pan and tin foil are necessary? Can someone explain their combined impact on the success of the recipe for me before I attempt making the brownies? I just cannot figure it out.

I had oeople who were never really into brownies rave about these! They were great even the next day staying soft and chewy. I tried the iciings and while they were fine I am a chocolate purist and thought these brownies could really stand so well on their own.( however, a little homemade whip creme never hurt anything!) I really think the pan makes a difference in the texture since this is the very first time I made brownies that were chewy and not crisped or browned on the edges. If you're concerned about recycling you can certainly wash and reuse the foil pan again.

These are the best brownies I have ever had, period. I brought the leftovers to my office and they were gone in under 5 minutes. I used about 6 ounces of semisweet chocolate chips instead of 4 (oops, that's what I get for pouring directly from the bag into the pan) and baked for about 26 minutes. I added 1/2 teaspoon lemon extract to the icing, which gave it a wonderful tangy punch. Do not use "lite" or fat free cream cheese for the icing, or it will end up runny and you'll have to add extra powdered sugar to give it some bulk.

Wait. Disposable pan lined with foil? Nonstick oil? What's Pam making that can't touch the precious pan? For goodness sake, people, try to bake with good bakeware and quality ingredients. There is absolutely NO reason for disposables here (even if they are recyclable, the first 2 R's are Reduce and Reuse) and pre-packaged nonstick spray. Double chocolate-pistachio-cream cheese brownies are yummy, decadent treats. Saving 10 calories from the multi-ingredient pan coating isn't going to help. Just trying to get us all to bake honestly. Otherwise, the recipe sounds tasty. Cook well. --diane

Rich and good, you cen't beat the chocolate orange combination. Tried all the toppings and think we liked the toasted coconut tyhe most. no w to the baking...used a metal pan with a foil liner and they were not chewy. I make brownies constantly ( have over 30 good recipes in my file) and have never founf=d the pan to influence the texture. These were done in 24 minutes. The suggested 30 minutes for a metal pan would have produced a disaster, an overdone, dried out brownie

Brownies were rich and fantastic! We liked the coconut ones the best. Orange and chocolate pair like a dream. Cut them small! My aunt felt the brownie layer was too thin, but brecause they are so very rich, I thought they were perfect.

This recipe has just replaced my other brownie favorites...Delicious! Chocolate and orange is one of the greatest combinations. I made half with pistachios and half with toasted coconut. Everyone had a hard time choosing. The brownies are a dense crumb and very moist. I used semisweet chocolate and added 1 teaspoon of cocoa powder to boost the chocolate flavor. I used my 13x9x2-inch baking pan and lined it with foil for easy removal. It's the summer concert/picnic season and will make this again next week to share.
