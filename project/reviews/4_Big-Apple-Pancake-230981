Wow-I read all the reviews and only did a couple of changes just to see how it would work since it seems foolproof. I used Eggbeaters and added cinnamon. Easy, spectacular. For everyday or company!

I have made this so many times (at least 2 dozen) and it is always amazing. The eggs make it more rich and filling than your typical pancake and it is so easy to make. The only change I make is doubling the fruit (2 apples; 1 pear, 1 apple; 2 pears) which I have done since the 2nd one I made. Served with a side of sausage and the smallest drizzle of quality maple syrup, it makes a great weekend breakfast.

Such a treat for a weekend breakfast! It's quick too. We love the eggy texture of the pancake. I substitute in almond milk with great results, and a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg on the apples deepens their flavor.

Wow this was tasty! I made it with a Granny Smith and next time I will try using two of them. I've made baked pancakes before that were thin and not very satisfying. THIS baked pancake is terrific. If you want your kids to love you, make this for dinner and serve with butter, maple syrup, and bacon. This is going into the regular rotation.

I used granny smith apples. Added a little cinnamon to the sauté. We loved it.

Awesome treat-I added cinnamon to the apples as they cooked-and I put a plate over the pan and flipped it out and cut it like a pie-everyone loved it and i have passed it on to others-something different from the ussual.

Exceptional because it's so easy! I start with only 2 tbsp butter and then transfer half of that into the batter, and that's plenty to get a great base and no sticking in a stainless pan. Also, an extra apple for more texture. The batter fluffs up wonderfully after fork-whisking, no blended needed.

This recipe is fantastic. My family loves it so much we make it every Sunday. The only change I've made is to add some cinnamon, I'm a sucker for apples and cinnamon together.

Excellent recipe. I used 1 % milk, 2 small apples and 1 pear. I sauteed the apples with some cinnamon. It was perfectly cooked in 15 minutes and it did not stick to the pan.

I love this dish! My mom and sister ask me to make it all the time, it is so delicious and it makes the whole house smell like the Pancake House. However, my one problem is that it is VERY eggy, so to resolve this problem I add an extra apple (sometimes two if they're small), and I add lots of cinnamon which also minimizes the eggy flavor. Overall, awesome recipe!

Rating: 4
This is really good. I used a tad less butter and the CSA apples I had on hand. I didn't want to dirty my blender, so just mixed the egg mixture by hand. It does make a fairly eggy dish, as other reviewers noted. We liked the eggy-ness, though and thought of it as a nice variation of the standard egg or pancake breakfast. Served with bacon. Oh, and it makes a nice puffy presentation, too.

This was a keeper. I used whole wheat flour and leftover homemade chunky spiced apple sauce (recipe found on this site) and added carmelized sweet onions and smoked guyere cheese. It was the perfect fall breakfast dish.

Rating: 4
These were really yummy. I stewed 3 apples with sugar, cinnamon and a dash of ground clove. I then made the batter by halving the quantities and only 1 large egg. I used soy milk instead of dairy. I simply whisked it rather than blending it. I put the apple in the pan, then drizzled maple syrup over it, then the batter over top. I served it with soy icecream and sprinkled with walnut pieces. I know this is a very loose version of it but it was a bit of a trial and I was the only one eating it. I will be making it again.

What an easy and delicious wow factor for breakfast! If you have an apple on hand, or pear for that matter, you will find this to be a special breakfast and easy for you to make. I have made this a dozen times and have resorted to skim milk and even whole wheat flour and you still can't ruin it! Of course, the more fat and lighter flour is best, but that is how good the recipe is! My husband loves it, too!

Great solid, simple recipe as is.My teens loved it.. I am going to add a little cinnamon sugar to the apples nxt time just to do something different.Or maybe sprinkle some raw sugar on 1/2 way through baking time.

I've seen a lot of comments about this being really eggy. These aren't your traditional "American pancakes." My friend's mom makes these for me all the time and calls them "German pancakes." This is like a fancier version of German Pancakes. So, yes, if you don't like eggs, you won't like these, but I love them and this fancy version is even better. Try them with boysenberry syrup or just a cup of granulated sugar for sprinkling (that's traditional according to Grace!).

Just ok... I would describe as being custard-like. Cinnamon was a good addition.

Great recipe, although I think it needs to be tweaked. I thought it could use more sugar and definitely cinnamon. Also, it really is more eggy than pancake-y, but I wouldn't say that as a negative. I will definitely make this again.

Karl Ratsch's German restaurant in Milwaukee is famous for its apple pancake. There it is served at the table where it is sprinkled with fresh lemon juice (a wedge or two) dotted with butter (2 tsp. or so) and powdered sugar. It is then rolled and cut into 5 or 6 pieces.

Easy recipe and so yummy. It puffed up gorgeously. I made a double batch in a large skillet and it turned out great.

I didn't like the "turning" of the apples. It can cause a mess and not leave the apples in a fan like pattern. The recipe works with a little tweaking. Check out my notes for the changes.

This was a really easy recipe and it tasted great. I only had 3 eggs and didn't want to head out to the store, and it still tasted fine. So, if you're worried about cholesterol you could always add 3 eggs instead of 4.

I used whole wheat flour and it turned out just fine. A keeper for sure! For those who say it is "eggy" as though that is a bad thing... If you don't like eggs, find another recipe. This one works just as it is.

More like an apple souffle than the classic Walker Brothers/Original Pancake House Apple Pancake, the addition of cinnamon (2 tsp) and nutmeg (2 dashes) is a must! Much quicker cooking time than most other recipies, works great in a seasoned 10" cast iron pan.

The "Joy of Cooking" has a dutch baby recipe that I alter by adding applies and carmelizing them with butter, sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg. This recipe calls for 2 eggs. I added 3. I also finished the pancake with generous sprinkle of cinnamon sugar. Not as gooey and cloying as the Walker Brothers pancakes and certainly not as expensive!

Quick, easy and delicious! Mine rose and curled over the edges too, but those edges were yummy to pull off and munch! I served mine with cinnamon sugar, per other reviewers' suggestions. My son put maple syrup on it and it was very delicious. Will make again!

I've made this a number of times for family brunch and it's always a hit. I've also run across it in several older cookbooks, variously as "German Oven Pancake" and "Dutch Baby".

Jnedeau- I have not made the recipe but a friend of mine has made something similar for me. After you saute the apples transfer them to a pie dish. I would also recommend greasing the dish and possibly preheating it. It might take some testing. I hope this helps!

okay, but nothing special. It tried this one, but my favourite recipe for apple pancakes uses more apples and a little cinnamon and a pinch of nutmegand caramelizes them for more flavour.

Great recipe - a favorite in our house. I typically add cinnamon to the batter and sprinkled on top once baked - this might help with what some referred to as an "eggy" taste.

It was really delicious, though my 2 year old - surprisingly - didn't like it. We had it for a "breakfast dinner" and it was very filling, plenty of leftovers for tomorrow. Also, used spoonful of plain yogurt since short of milk - worked fine.

I've made this recipe for family and guests, it's always a treat! Easy and delicious. I do wonder why people change the recipe, then complain that it is too this or that. It's wonderful as stated. I do make substitutions to recipes but we are then reviewing our own recipe, not the original.

I was looking for an apple pancake recipe similar to one my German grandmother used to make and this fit the bill to a T!

Quick and incredibly easy. The batter is the same batter that you can use for what is often referred to as a "Dutch Baby" at area breakfast restaurants. I added some sugar and cinnamon to the apples and butter in the pan so that it would caramelize while baking.

We really loved this! I used a non-stick 10" fry pan, which worked great until we went to eat it. A wooden spatula probably would have been an easy solution, but we wanted to eat it directly out of the pan. It was soooo puffy! The pancake rose at least 2 inches out of the pan. I tried to skip using the blender, but my whisk just didn't do anything. I ended up using a hand blender, and I'm glad I did because I think that's why it rose so well. I think all the bubbles I beat in made the puff (like a souffle). The flavors are subtle, but great. Nice change from the usual cinnamon/nutmeg apple dishes. I used Madagascar vanilla, which added a great flavor. I considered serving with maple syrup or caramel, but it really didn't need it. Very filling for two! Will try with other fruits next time.

I made this for my family for breakfast this morning, and everyone liked it. I added a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg to the apples when they were softening, but I'd recommend adding a bit more. This dish should also be good with other fruits and vegetables if apples aren't your thing. I'd suggest saving it for a day when a group of people will be eating with you, it's fairly large and easy.

kind of boring, vanilla was the only flavour to come through, pretty obvious as i look back through the ingredients...a little cinnamon and nutmeg would go a long way. maybe next time it will be better!
