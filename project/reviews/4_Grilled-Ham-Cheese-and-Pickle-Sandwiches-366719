Gruyere cheese is the key ingredient of these sandwiches, giving them a terrific salty taste. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

Just a comment to those who are confused about putting mayo on the side of the sandwich that gets grilled - yes, that's the way it's supposed to be! It is a nice change from buttering then grilling/frying in butter. Lovely crunch and not quite as greasy. Try it!

This was one of the worst sandwiches I have ever made. I made it exactly by the recipe, with all the mayo and butter and it was terribly greasy. The pickles kept sliding out of the sandwich. The proscuito and cheeses were ok, but I think the amount of cheese also added to the greasiness.

The mayo-on-both-sides of the bread puts an amazing light and crispy finish on these sandwiches, rather like a tangy, less soggy version of a Croque Monsieur! I've been making grilled cheese sandwiches for nearly 60 years now, but this ol' dog has just learned a new trick. This is my new SOP for grilled sandwiches.

@hel2020 put it on the INSIDE of both pieces of bread... then butter on outside to grill... it does sound confusing but you don't want to grill mayo side down... yuck. Hope this helps :)

For those omitting the goat cheese, I live near where Cypress Grove has their maunfacturing plant (Arcata, CA), and their cheeses are fantastic. They have several varities, and if you enjoy a tangy, sharp cheese, you will enjoy theirs very much. Give it a try. My favorite is the Humboldt Fog.

The recipe is pretty clear: Smear mayo on both sides of the bread.

Help me out; does the mayo go on the outside of the bread or the inside with the cheese and pickles?

It drives me nuts when people change the recipe & than comment & rate it.

Since we keep our refrigerator very cold one trick I started using is to nuke my cheese sandwiches for 30 seconds or so before I fry them.

Followed advice of cook from Georgia, and eliminated the goat cheese. Instead of the unnecessary fat from all the mayo and butter, I just sprayed lightly with olive oil and grilled with my panini pan. Much less cooking time, so the pickles stayed crunchy. It also worked with very thinly sliced black forest style ham.

I made this, minus the goat cheese. It was very nice, although I found that the pickles got too soft and lost some of their flavor when heated. I think it would be improved by adding the pickles after frying the sandwich.

The sweet tart addition of bread and butter pickles was a bright note to grown up grilled ham and cheese. Mayonaise did add an extra crunch to the bread and the cheese combination was excellent. I will definately make these again.
