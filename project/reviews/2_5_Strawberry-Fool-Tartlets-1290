The "fool" was delicious! The crust, however, was terrible, not flaky and tender but so hard that it had to be cut with a steak knife. You MUST have a lot of time to prepare this. If I make this again, I will use my own pie crust recipe.

I made this a couple of years ago and forgot to review it...so maybe my opinion isn't so valid! But anyway, I only prepared the filling and served it 'parfait style' layered with whipped cream and fresh berries. It was good not great, and the extra sugar and gelatin sort of disguised that my strawberries weren't at the peak of ripeness

the tart crusts were not flaky and were hard to prepare. the fool was ok, but not worth the fuss---i prefer to eat the berries plain.

I have been making the "Fool" portion of this recipe since it came out in the Feb.'96 issue. It is a wonderful cake filling (more like a mousse) and I have substituted raspberries when I feel like really splurging! It would be great as a parfait or a trifle or a cake roll. I'm just thrilled that I could find it as I have misplaced my original recipe!
