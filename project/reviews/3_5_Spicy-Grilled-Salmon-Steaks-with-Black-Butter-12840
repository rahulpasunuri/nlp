Delicious! Grilled in cast iron pan. Not spicy enough for us, perhaps add more cayenne next time. I tried the salmon without melted butter and it was good BUT with melted butter was to DIE FOR! This is a keeper.

Excellent flavor, however, I used fillets instead of steaks. I also substituted scallions for the onions and poured the butter over the salmon while it finished cooking. It's a hit with the family every time!!

I used thick salmon steaks and grilled them. The result was a delicious outside and a very bland inside. I think this rub would work better on a fillet. I think I will continue doing what I've always done with salmon steaks: Brief marinade in teriyaki sauce and then grill. The flavor tends to permeate to the center of the steak rather than sitting there on top like this rub. Also, grilling over low heat took over 10 minutes, and even then the steaks were raw inside. Beware if you grill.

Firstly, this was not spicy. I admit that I enjoy very spicy food, but to say this was spicy is to show a very low tolerance for spicy. Secondly, those that pass on the butter to make the dish "more healthy"...give me a break. 1/2 T of butter per serving is not going to create this huge chance of a coronary and it did add flavor. If you think it made it too oily, use less. I found 1 T for 4 helpings to be just right and not oily at all. Tasty stuff.

I loved the recipe because I love spicy foods. The butter was almost to much. I didn't use all the butter that the recipe called for.

Rating: 4
Very, very good. I prefer the grilled method over the pan-fried. Grilling gives it a lighter, flakier texture and the rub is seared without becoming charred. Just the right amount of seasoning - it enhances with flavor of the salmon without overpowering it. It was best when I followed the recipe exactly.

I liked it, but didn't loved it. I would give it 2.5 stars. It was plenty spicy, but there was something missing. Can't put my finger on it....

I made this recipe last night thinking it sounded good. It turned out much, much better than good...it was fabulous!! As another reviewer suggested, I pan fried it...(non-stick pan).... on medium high for about 4 - 5 minutes per side. It was unlike any other salmon I have ever made. It was ....blackened/almost crusted....on the outside and moist/tender on the inside. I had marinated it for 2 hours beforehand. Highly recommended!!! This recipe is going camping with us. A fast and easy dinner cooked over the campfire with salad, and fire-roasted veggies ....perfect!!

We made this for a quick dinner tonight. We used a salmon filet and cooked it on a grill pan. The rub was ready in seconds and the salmon was cooked in minutes. Total time from finding the recipe to sitting down to eat was less than 20 minutes. That included making a salad and setting the table. The salmon was delicious. Just the perfect level of spice. We will definitely make this again.

I made this a different way, grilling the steaks bare, then adding the butter and slowly melting it into the sauce ingredients, then pouring the whole shabang over the grilled steaks. It was melt in your mouth good!

I'm a student, just lerning to cook, so I look for simple, quick recipes. This one, no doubt is quick and tastes great. I don't have a grill so I just used a frying pan. I can see how it would be much better on a grill, but still, easy and delicious!

Rating: 3
I followed the directions and it turned out perfectly. I did use a grill pan, oiled, and heated on high heat until smoking. It only took 4 mins per side on high heat. The end result was almost a blackened salmon steak. Did not need the butter but drizzled a tad of extra virgin olive oil over the fish before I served. This is not a hot/spicy dish but it is a very flavorful one which we rated two thumbs up.

Rating: 4
Very tasty salmon on the grill! Simple as well. This has been added to our summertime grilling favorites--we highly recommend it. Did double the cayenne and paprika and omit butter as other reviewers suggested. Had a nice kick (and we love peppery foods) but probably next time will use the amount of cayenne as in recipe. Used fresh wild sockeye salmon and grill basket instead of skillet on charcoal Weber grill. Covered without turning--it came out perfectly! Served with garlic and olive oil couscous and sauteed broccoli with garlic and lemon peel from this site. Do try it!

This is the only way I make salmon now. I always use fillets and haven't used the butter since the second time I made it - I agree with others who say it isn't needed. I've cooked it many different ways but the best is baked for about 20 minutes (depending on the thickness of the salmon) on 350 and then finish off with a few minutes under the broiler. Not too spicy but not bland either ... yum - we're having it tonight!

This salmon was great!! The recipe was quick, easy, and delicious. I made no alterations to the recipe and thought the spices were fantastic together. Anyone can make this dish and if you have a good spice rack, odds are you won't need to invest in any ingredients other than the salmon. A must to make again!!

This was excellent, and so easy to do. It is a nice spicy change from our usual salmon recipes

Rating: 3
I had to improvise a bit... I used a generous 1/2 tsp of cayenne as I didn't have any paprika at hand. I substituted 1 1/2 tsp of shallots in place of the onions and garlic and also used a roasted garlic infused oil in place of the regular oil. Finally, I used salmon fillets rather than steaks. Nonetheless, I think the effect was basically the same. Not especially spicy but with enough bite to be satisfying. I found the salmon tender and juicy (at 4 to 5 minutes per side give I had a fillet). I, too, didn't bother with the butter. Worth repeating. This is probably a good recipe if you are cooking for someone who isn't keen on salmon but enjoys relatively spicy flavours.

I received cedar planks for christmas, and was looking for a salmon recipe to make it on. I used a 2 1/2 lb salmon filet, only put the paste on the one side, increased the ingredients a little bit, eg. 1/2 tsp of cayenne, and used fresh lemon thyme. Both my husband and i Loved it. It was a great amount of spicy-nes, (kids thought it was too hot). Cooked it on the grill for about 20-25 min. on medium on the plank. Thought the paste was VERY flavorful, but if you ate a piece without it, not so flavorful (to be expected). Not our Favorite salmon recipe, (terriaki twins in the Born to Grill Book), but a very close second.

Rating: 4
A delicious, easy-to-make recipe that got rave reviews all around. Skipped the butter--it didn't need it. Regarding spiciness, it's clearly subjective. We like spicy food and found this actually quite mild. The spices only made it really flavorful. If you're used to spicy food, this will be tame heatwise. If you think Taco Bell's mild sauce is hot, it'll be spicy. In either case, it will be really, really tasty.

I had some salmon in the house so I looked on epicurious an easy grilling recipe. I was so pleased with how easy and delicous this was.

This will be a regular dish in my house from now on.

The ease of preparation here helps to give it a four rating - but it is also very very good! My husband and I like spicy food, but I would not consider this too spicy. I cooked it as per the directions (4 min. per side) in a regular cast iron skillet - then another time in a rigged grill pan - both ways were a success. I combined all the spices together in a baggie along with the printed recipe and gave it to my sister so she could try it - she liked it alot too.

I didn't exactly prepare as stated but put some olive oil in a skillet, added all the spices (used less cayenne)and the salmon. After cooking 4 minutes on both sides it still was raw in the middle; I think the salmon were probably 1-3/4 inches thick. It was looking dry, so I added about a tablespoon of margarine, squeezed two wedges of lemon on top, added roughly 1/4 cup of sherry, covered and simmered until it was done. What resulted was the best tasting salmon I've had in quite a while! My husband even devoured it and he doesn't usually like things cooked in wine.

I was really looking forward to this one, based on all the rave reviews, but I honestly don't understand what all the fuss is about. This is ok, but it's really not that great, or that spicy. In fact, by boyfriend, who loves salmon, just picked at it. This recipe is easy and quick enough, but it is certainly not impressive by any means, and definitely not a keeper.

I'd like to rate this 3.5 forks. My husband who "likes salmon but has to be in the mood for it" (and never is) totally loves this dish. It's so great because I can cook a healthy meal - skipped the butter - and still have him enjoying dinner. I upped the cayenne by 1/2 teaspoon and the paprika by 1/2 teaspoon. Cooked it on the George Foreman grill, miracle cooking tool of the last 10 years, so there was no added fat or calories. I will absolutely make this again and again.

If you are a salmon lover try this outstanding recipe! My husband cooked the salmon directly on the barbeque. He seared the fish on a hot grill and then turned it down to a medium low heat(we didn't use foil as that can make it soft). The salmon was crispy on the outside and moist inside. Unlike other reviews we did not find it too spicy - perhaps that was because we did it on the grill rather than a ridged pan. I served the salmon with rice pilaf, steamed broccoli and tartar sauce on the side. We will be making this delicious dish again very soon!

This recipie came out steller on my George Forman grill, for which I am always looking for recipies. It came out nice and crispy. It's a very spicy dish, and I'd recommend serving it with something cooling. I skipped the black butter like other readers because I think the salmon is rich enough. If you like spicy hot food, and you like salmon, you won't be disappointed with this easy dish.

This reminds me of the blackened salmon from Great Jones Cafe in New York - one of my absolute favorite dishes. I have made it twice now. The first time was on a George Foreman grill. I am not usually a fan but it worked great. The second was on the grill wrapped in foil. The rub did not form a crust in the same way and wasn't quite as great as the first time. I do recommend watching how much cayenne you use - a little goes a long way!

I made this for my girlfriend and myself and we really enjoyed it. It's not too spicy at all. We had the mango salsa with it. In my opinion it doesn't need the mango salsa but my girlfriend really liked it. We also had a side of asparagus, which complimented the fish. Yep indeed... it said, "Fish... you look good!" To which the fish replied, "And I taste spectacular!"

I used this spice rub on salmon fillets instead of steaks, and grilled it on an electric countertop grill. It was fabulous.

I'm a chef by profession, but sometimes I just don't feel like cooking. This dish was the answer.

This was very good but not having a grill pan, we grilled it. The coating stuck to the grill, and we lost some of the ingrediants. Tasted more like salmon au poivre. Next time we'll use a cast iron skillet. I made sesame seed sugar snap peas, along with new potatoes and it was quite good!

Served with the Canyon Ranch Spa Cookbook recipe for salad with gorgonzola, pears, walnuts and port dressing, and a rosemary/red onion focaccia! Yes!

Delicious, yes. Spicy, no. While I don't like having my nostrils seared by a dish, this recipe turned out mild to my taste. However, it was a fine meal that deserved a solid three forks. I would add more cayenne pepper next time. I also used an average nonstick frying pan, which required about 5 minutes of cooking time per side as opposed to the 3 to 4 minutes on a grill pan. Couscous with chopped red bell peppers and crisp asparagus spears make wonderful complements to the salmon. Next time I will also try some mango salsa as suggested by another reviewer.

I've been making this recipe for the last several years - this makes wonderful salmon. I never have made it with the butter and accompany it with the chili-mango salsa (on this site + variations).

I'm surprised at all the rave reviews of this recipe. It wasn't bad but wasn't anything special in my opinion.

Perfect grilled salmon recipe-the spicing is not so powerful as to overshadow the fish. All my family were very satisfied with, from the grownups to the 8-year-olds. We cooked the fish on the BBQ grill and served it with a mild garlic mashed potato side (some other guests were having grill porterhouse steaks so the potatoes had to go with both). Very good!

Very good, simple to make and an attractive dish. I used boneless salmon roast which was thicker than 1 inch and theeore had to finish the salmon in a moderate oven. To the coating seasonings I added sesame seed and parsley. Also had to add some olive oil to get to the paste texture desired

Absolutely great!!!! Because the oil starts to splatter too much the longer it's in the hot pan,I broil it first on a low rack for 10 minutes and then I finish it off in a hot pan so that it is seared/grilled. Also, I leave out the black butter - the spice rub is so full of taste that the butter is unnecessary. This is definitely one of the most delicious salmon dishes I have ever eaten!!!!

This was absolutely delicious. I've made it twice now and my husband and I just love it. I've yet to try it with salmon; we've had it with marlin and it's exceptionally good (almost more like very tender chicken than fish). My husband's tongue is more sensitive than mine so I usually only put in about half of the cayenne, but it's still plenty spicy. I used fresh thyme instead of dried and we grilled it on foil packets. Sublime!

I made the recipe using wild-caught Sockeye salmon filet, marinated it for at least an hour, and grilled it skin side down. I skipped the butter and drizzled fresh lemon juice over it.

Very easy and delicious. I followed suggestions from former reviews, marinated the salmon for an hour or so, substituted lemon for black butter and broiled instead of pan grilling. It will become one of our house dishes, anything this simple & tasty stays!

I've been looking for a tasty fish entree which is easy enough to make any day of the week, and this might be it! I took suggestions from the previous reviews and squeezed lemon on top instead of the butter. Also, as the store did not have salmon steaks today, and I don't have a grill pan, I bought fillets and broiled them for about 10 minutes. Turned out excellent. I served it with Red Potatoes and Wilted (Mustard) Greens, found on Epicurious as well. Great combination, and took me 45 minutes tops!

You must try this dish! It is the best salmon I have ever tasted. I cooked it for my brother, who hates salmon and he liked it.

The recipe could do with some minor adjustments to suit my taste. However it is easy to prepare and very tasty.

I grilled 1" steaks on a medium-high barbecue, 5 minutes to a side. The pepper rub is tasty. However, the addition of the black butter at the end made the final result quite oily, what with the olive oil already added in the rub. I suggest skipping the black butter and serving lemon wedges to squeeze on the steaks, as a nice complement to the oil & pepper rub.

The spice rub makes a crust that really works well with medium-rare salmon's creaminess. Just use a heavy-bottomed pan because the rub wants to burn really bad. The blackened butter is okay, but you could really use almost any light sauce, or even a lemon squeeze. The spice rub is what matters.

This dish is so easy to make. I cook this for my Fiance, who does not like fish, but she loves this dish. Even if you cannot cook, this dish is to easy to mess up on.

Because of the excellent reviews of this recipe, I decided to adapt it for a large filet of salmon. I put a piece of aluminum foil in the bottom of a broiler pan, sprayed it with oil and placed the salmon diagonally in the pan, skin side down. Then I spread the paste onto the top of the filet and broiled it six inches below medium heat for fifteen minutes. The result was beyond compare! I served it with steamed spinach with a lemon wedge and a baked potato for a simple family dinner. Everyone gave the salmon four stars!

This was a very light, but fulfilling dish!! I agree with everyone else...it's definitely something to try. I've never cooked salmon before, and this recipe was very easy to follow. I'll definitely try it again!!!

This was absolutely incredible. We had caught some salmon the day before and so I used filets as we didn't make steaks out of them. I "grilled" them in my cast iron pan, skin side first, and they came out delicious. My husband said it was the best salmon he had ever had! Thanks for the recipe!

if you like salmon with a kick then this recipe is definitely for you - it's easy and quick; however, i would recommend marinating the salmon at least an hour for full flavor. get ready for dancing because with each bite your tongue will be doing the tango.

De-lish! I let the spice rub "marinate" our salmon steaks for about an hour-and-a-half. I doubled the garlic called for and omitted the butter. This recipe is easy to prepare, especially if your a "fish novice" like me. Like many of you we prepared this on the grill. Good company dish. I served it with an easy mango salsa: 1-2 mangos, diced, 1/3 cup finely diced red onion, 2-3 TBLSP cilantro, 1 TBSLP Ortega diced jalepenos, 1 tsp. fresh lime juice. -- Laura

Very good,didn't have salmon steaks so used salmon fillet and only applied paste to one side. I grilled the salmon and did not make the black butter, was excellent without it.

I prepared this salmon dish on the bar-b-q grill. When my husband took his first bite, chewed and swallowed, he rolled back his eyes and asked me if I was trying to seduce him. If that's not a four star rating, I don't know what is! We thought it was wonderful!!!!

Fantastic flavor - I'd recommend coating the salmon with the mixture and let it sit for at least an hour. I increased the garlic and added some fresh thyme and basil from the garden, then ground everything up to a poaste in a mortar and pestle. The black butter isn't necessary - the dish is spectacular without it.

I left the butter off and tried it on the grill also and it was really good. I also added a little peri peri to it. I'm probably going to make this again sometime soon...

This is our new favorite way to serve salmon. It's quick, easy and provides gourmet results. We grilled our salmon on the BBQ and the rub held up nicely. We haven't yet bothered to use the butter as we've found the richness of the salmon to be an adequate balance to the zing of the rub. Excellent!

This was a very simple dish to make. I eliminated the butter to save on fat, and it still tasted great! I broiled it instead of pan frying.

Rave reviews from my guests! I doubled the spice rub and put it on both sides of a large salmon fillet, then broiled it. In my hurry, I forgot the butter and served it without -- but everyone loved it. Fast and easy.

This is a very easy recipe. I substituted red pepper for the cayenne pepper. Had it with a side dish of buttered noodles and my wife and I both loved it.

This was easy to whip up with ingredients at hand, and really spiced up my fresh Atlantic salmon. Zingy, but not too hot for the tame of heart!

This is a very quick and easy dish that you can make with ingredients that you will find in your spice rack and the results are very rich and impressive (and nice and spicy). I was able to make a delicious meal for myself and my boyfriend at 9pm without going to the market!
