Feeds 4, if they're hungry lumberjacks. Had huge amounts of leftovers. Moderately good, not sure it's on the repeat list.

I don't think this recipe is at all bland. It's pretty tasty. Although, it's definitely not low-fat! My 10-year old daughter wasn't crazy about it, but she's very picky, so I'm not surprised. She ate the whole thing but didn't like the mess. I expected it to be much more runny than it was, because of the creamed corn.

Tasty but kinda bland. Needs tons of garlic or something. Also is a bit too runny for a taco filling. Maybe it would be better as a dip or chowder!

Very easy, tasty and different.
