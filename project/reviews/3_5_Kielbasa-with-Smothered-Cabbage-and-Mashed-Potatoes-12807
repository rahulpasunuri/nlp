We added a few splashes of apple cider vinegar, based on some suggestions here; served it with simple boiled potatoes rather than mashed. They soaked up the juice from the cabbage and made this a meal! This was such a good cold February Sunday treat. So fast, easy and delicious!

Yummy change of pace. There is nothing like sausage, cabbage and potatoes together. Add the apple cider as recommended earlier; adds more depth to all flavors.

This was good, but a bit bland. I may try it again another time with some of the variations suggested in the reviews.

Solid recipe when you are in the mood for some serious comfort food. I use turkey kielbasa to keep it on the healthy side. Great for when you have some leftover cabbage to use up.

This was so easy and really tasty - great for a quick weeknight meal. I made a few changes: browned turkey bacon pieces and added at the end; used trader joe's turkey kielbasa; substituted 1 C. unfiltered apple juice and 1/2 C. white wine for the 1 1/2 C. water; used an instant mashed potato mix since I was feeling lazy. I would definitely make this again, next time trying out regular pork bacon and kielbasa.

Great comfort food for a cold night in February; particularly after the market drops almost 300 points and there is not much left in your wallet to spend!

Not gourmet? Place round food ring on plate. Layer garlic mashed potatoes,layer cabbage(with apple,carrot whatever)top with diagonally sliced kielbasa,sausage whatever.Remove ring. Sprinkle with crisp bacon. Charge lotsa $$. psh psh not gourmet! If Batali was Polish lookout...

This was good. Easy middle of the week fare. I used turkey kielbasa and sprinkled some malt vinegar on top at the table. I like the cheese idea.

Yum! This is awesome on a cool fall weekday night. It's relatively simple to make and is kid-friendly (my kids, 5 and 3, literally gave it a thumbs up). I did use beer instead of water, which added flavor. What put it over the top, though, was a sprinkle of shredded white cheddar cheese on top of each dish.

Decided to make this recipe after I stopped into a Polish meat market on my way home from Greenpoint Brooklyn. I chose to use a much thinner, more cured kielbasa. I feel is has a bit more flavor. I also used chicken broth instead of water, but also added a splash of white wine.

I had some beef/pork/cheese sausage and didn't know what to do with it. I decided to make this recipe with it and it came out great! I used packaged shredded cabbage and carrots, beer in place of water and store bought mashed potatoes. Excellent!

Not bad at all, the family loved it. One bone to pick, however -kielbasa is traditionally NOT smoked, that's an Americanized version. Kielbasa is fresh Polish sausage. At least in Polish culture. Milwaukee has a very large Polish community, and I've grown up eating FRESH kielbasa in my 100% Polish family, which is typically simmered for hours over very low heat. Not widely available, but if you have the chance to try it, do, you'll be shocked at the taste difference.

Made this many times. Great comfort food. Served on potatoes and carrots mashed together. Used leftovers for soup by adding it to Trader Joe's Roasted Tomato and adding dill.

This was so easy and really good. Perfect for a weeknight and perfect on a cold, rainy night. Used some turkey stock instead of the water. I think I'll definitely use even more cabbage next time because it really cooks down.

tasty. used coleslaw mix, chicken broth and garlic. added a bit of caraway. should have used home made kielbasa. this dish made me miss my grandma.

Simple, quick and hearty. Used chicken stock in place of water, added red pepper flakes as others have. One of us claims not to like sausage but found it "very good indeed". Yup, it's a keeper.

I also used beer in place of the water. To save time, I used store mashed potatoes. This is such an easy, delicious recipe. I made it in advance. Put the mashed potatoes on the bottom of a casserole dish, topped with kielbasa and cabbage. Just reheat when ready to use.

This was so good there was no talking at the table, just eating. Used beer instead of water, couldn't imagine how it would have tasted otherwise. Made extra mashed potatoes, too. I highly recommend this recipe!!

With such simple ingredients, who would have known that this dish would be so delicious!!! Instead of water, I used beer. Lovely, simple and fast dish! The family raved.

Very easy to make! I added paprika to the cabbage/kielbasa for a little color and added flavor. My husband also like it!

I really liked this, thought it was very simple. I didn't measure the cabbage, I'm sure I used more than called for and I used a 'ring' of turkey kielbasa. I also didn't bother with adding water or broth, the first time I made this I did, but the husband thought the cabbage was too mushy. This time I browned the kielbasa, added the onions (I used 2)browned them and then added the cabbage. There was enough liquid that I didn't need to add any. Everything 'browned' up but it looked fine, the cabbage had crunch and it was great. Very easy, quick and good. Try it.

This dish really had me intrigued because it sounded so different, and I really didn't know what to expect. I did add garlic to the mashed potatoes, used broth instead of water, coleslaw mix with carrots. Next time I might add apples as previously suggested. With all that being said, you cannot go wrong with this dish. It is excellent any way you prepare it! I would rate this a 3&1/2, and am excited by the prospect of making it again. Delicious!

Loved it and *would* serve it to company! Made a few changes (personal taste). Fried bacon and then browned the kielbasa in the bacon fat. Used maybe a cup of homemade chicken stock vs. water. Added salt, pepper and a dash of crushed red pepper for a little heat. The potatoes were wonderful steamed - I've always boiled my potatoes before mashing. Will steam them from now on - they were less watery. This made more than enough for my husband and me. Glad we had leftovers!

Great Comfort Food! I use broth instead of water, and no milk.

I thought this was excellent. I had leftover polish sausage I needed to use and was very pleased with the results. I'll definetly make this one again. I followed the previous reviewers suggestions and used broth instead of water and added a bit of dill. My husband who is a cabbage freak loved it!

A great way to put cabbage in a new light for those who are wary. "Gourmet" doesn't always need to mean complicated technique and obscure ingredients - it can also mean elegantly simple and a salute to the simple and nourishing cusine of various cultures. Enjoy!

This was pretty good and easy to make. I added a good pinch of dill and some celery seed, and it smelled just like Grandmas house!

Yummy comfort food. Next time I'll use broth instead of water, and less of it. I ended up with alot of liquid left in the pan. As others have said, the dish is a little bland as written. I added 2 teaspoons of a seasoning blend with salt at the end which helped alot.

My family thought this recipe was good, but not great. But I would make it again, with some changes, because it was so easy. I almost always follow the recipes from Gourmet exactly as printed the first time through, just to see how the original is supposed to taste. In this case, my family thought the original too bland. Next time I'm going to incorporate some changes from an old Cassoulet recipe from McCalls. I would take 4 slices of bacon, cut them into 1-inch pieces, and saute them in a large kettle until crisp. Then I'd remove the bacon and set aside, and use the remaining fat instead of the oil to brown the kielbasa. To the kettle I'd add a clove of crushed garlic, a bay leaf and some thyme, and perhaps part white wine and chicken broth instead of the 1 1/2 cups of water. Before serving I'd add the cooked bacon pieces. These changes would still make this an easy recipe to make, but I'm hoping would give us more of the flavor we would like.

Excellent and fast (Czech-inspired) meal. We've made it half a dozen times and making again tonight!

This is insanely easy and delicious. Our children (ages3,4,5) think this awesome. The middle one requested it for his birthday....in July! My wife and I almost feel bad when we make it, because it is easy. We've made it with everything possible; Gourmet, Homemade, and Cheap store bought sausage, onion, No onion, double onion, and green apples. Always good. If you screw this up then stay out of the kitchen.

Amazing recipe as everyone else has said. It doubles nicely. I had a bit left over with its liquid and added some pork base to yield a great soup/stew. My adult son liked it both ways.

Those that wouldn't serve this for company should consider friends that aren't so stuffy! This is an excellent, flavorful dish that warms the soul. I doubled the onion and used amber beer instead of water. I also had the pleasure of using wonderful homemade polish sausage. Simple comfort food at its best!

I made this recipe with 97% fat free kosher hot dogs. They normally are not very good, but they tasted great in this combination. I also addedd a large, grated carrot to give it more color. It is a very satisfying winter meal.

I am Polish and learned to cook from my mother and grandmother. If you have ever made REAL Polish sausage from scratch, you would realize how very gourmet it is. The Polish sausage you buy in stores does not compare with the real thing.

Definitely comfort food for that week or two just after we have to set our clocks back to standard time! I played with the recipe a bit, using a beef sausage and "HP sauce" (a British brown sauce) instead of Kielbasa, making this a funky English / Polish hybrid.

This is a good base recipe. I changed this recipe as follows with excellent results. In place of the butter, I used the pan drippings from 1/4 lb. of bacon which was chopped and added back 5 minutes before serving. I substituted cole slaw mix for the cabbage and added one chopped apple. I also substitued 1 14 oz. can of chicken broth for the water. I served as directed in the recipe. Next time I will add some whole clove to give it a more German flare. This is a great cold weather dish when you want a sturdy supper and will serve as a gourmet german meal for guests. It was quite good.

Good stuff. For those people who love to cook, but sometime just don't have the time...this is one for you. As other reviewers have said it is not exactly gourmet (I wouldn't serve it for dinner guests), but it is tasty. I added some tumeric to give it a little more flavor. Not a bad dish for a cold night in San Francisco.

I don't know why everyone keeps saying that this recipe is not gourmet. Yes if you buy everything pre-packaged it is not gourmet. But try making your own sausage. Gourmet means using the freshest foods and taking care to prepare them from scratch. Just because a meal is "homestyle" does not mean it is not gourmet. Polish food has been around 1000s of years,and when cooked from scratch is very gourmet.

Rating: 3
This is a wonderful "comfort-food" meal. You can also mix the Kielbasi, cabbage and onion mixture with cooked butter noodles instead of serving it over mashed potatoes. These meals are not exactly gourmet meals, but they are very very very tasty "homey-cozy" meals.

We liked this a lot. My spouse isn't crazy about kielbasa, and he said that I could make it again, rave reviews for him! Nice change of pace, quick and easy! Followed suggestions and added some apple juice for flavor and was good, next time may add some apple.

We used cajun chicken sausage. Also, used beer instead of water for the veggies. Made this a zillion times and still love it on a blustery midwest night. Reminds us of colcannon (sp? potato dish from Ireland). Serve with a sweet-hot mustard on the side. Sheer comfort.

I never cooked kielbasa before but my husband (we just got married) loves it. So, as a newlywed, I thought I'd surprise him. HE LOVED IT! It's not gourmet, but who wants to eat gourmet every night? This recipe took no time at all to prepare. It's perfect for a weekday meal. I made my own mashed potatoes, and I subbed chicken broth for water. DELICIOUS! I recommend!

Rating: 4
Of course it's not a "gourmet Recipe", but it's quite a good recipe, sort of "German Peasant" I browned 2 pieces of bacon before browning the kielbasa. It gave it, I think a much better flavour. I steamed, then mashed the potatoes which went over well with the rest of the family. I will certainly make this dish again, even for company. I find the "peasant" dishes go over ever so well with guests, they don't expect them, and are pleasantly surprised! Bon Appetit!

I used just the kielbasa and cabbage and served with baked beans. I used half water and half apple cider. It gave the cabbage a slightly sweet taste. I though this was a very nice recipe for a winter evening, although in Tucson winter is in the mind of the beholder.

To the cook in Gallagher Cove Washington: Not every dish has to be a gourmet specialty to be a great dish. Some of the very best dishes are those simple items we remember our mother's cooking just to make ends meet and fill our bellies. No, I don't think this dish would win any grand awards in Paris; but it's good honest food. If you don't like mashed potatoes, if you don't like kielbasa, if you don't like cabbage, why did you try it? The recipe is pretty straight forward about what you get.

I substituted 1 cup of chicken broth and a 1/2 cup of dry white wine for the 1-1/2 cups of water and also added 2 crushed garlic cloves and 2 tsps of Hungarian paprika along with salt and pepper to taste. In the mashed potatoes I used light sour cream in place of the milk. This recipe was easy and very tasty.

I made this with red cabbage, and used home-made apple-leek stock when cooking the kielbasa-cabbage-onion mix. I also made the mashed potatoes my usual way, with half-and-half. This is a VERY tastey dish that's quick to make; a good week-night dish.
