Delicious! I love making this for cook-outs and potlucks. Its a great way to use my cucumbers differently and its always a hit!

Light and refreshing. This is very easy to make and would taste great as a side dish with many things. I will definitely be making this again.

Excellent summer salad with grilled chicken. I prepare it often during the warmer season. It works well for potlucks and adds a different direction than the normal side dishes at a cookout.

Definitely needs more heat, so I would do 2 jalapenos next time or maybe 1/8 tsp of red pepper flakes. The syrup, as written takes about 6 minutes at the boil (not just simmering). When cool it has the consistency of Karo syrup. I think using less sugar will result in less dressing, so I would stick with the recipe as written and boil it llonger.

We enjoyed this. On a bitter winter night, it made a very refreshing side dish accompanied by 2 other faves from this site, the 'Chili Lime shrimp with Avocado' and 'Tommy's Rice and Beans'. I followed the recipe exactly and the only glitch I encountered was that the sugar/vinegar syrup took considerably longer than 4 minutes to reduce. Perhaps in consequence, the syrup became very thick upon refrigeration, but watered down considerably once the other ingredients were added. I definitely will make it again, but will try out other reviewers' suggestions re: reducing the amount of sugar. And I think I will crank up the heat another notch.

Light, refreshing, tasty. I made it 4 hours ahead. Didn't hurt it. Also skipped the lettuce leaves and seeds, just served in a see through bowl. Goes great with honey gingered pork tenderloins from this site, along with russet, rutabega and parsnip casserole from this site. Yum.

It's a refreshing and crisp salad that brought lots of compliments. Instead of sugar, I used liquid stevia to be equivalent to 1/4 cup sugar (I echo other's opinion 3/4 sweetener or equivalent is far too much). I decided I wanted the heat and flavor of the jalapeno in the salad but not the pieces of the vegetable in it, so I made the dressing the night before and added 1/2 sliced jalapeno and minced ginger (a generous 1 1/2" x 1 1/2" piece) to meld in the refrigerator overnight. By morning the ginger flavor was wonderful but I wanted more heat/jalapeno flavor so I added the other 1/2 to meld until evening. It was delicious but I think I would have preferred just a bit more jalapento zing. Next time I'll leave the seeds and ribs of the 1/2 jalapeno in for the overnight "meld down" and check my heat factor in the morning. (I remove and toss the jalapeno before dressing the salad, but you could certainly mince it up at that point and add it in). I too added red peppers for additional color.

very tasty. the cukes stayed nicely crisp and the flavors blended well. i used only a couple tablespoons of sugar. pay attention when simmering the sauce, it reduces quickly. next time will add more jalapeno and some cilantro for more zip.

Makes a lovely presentation. I like to serve as a brunch dish. I line a platter with lettuce leaves and serve family or buffet style. Never have any left. Definitely use less sugar (about 1/4 cup).

I enjoyed this salad. I used 1/3 c sugar. The sweetness of the pineapple made up for the sugar. The vegetables were still crispy 3 days later.

We enjoy the sweet/hot of this salad. We use much less sugar and more jalapeno. Fresh pineapple is a must for this salad. I don't think we could ever get 6 to 8 serving from this, more like 4.

Easy and tasty. I forgot the sesame seeds and didn't use the lettuce. I took reviewers' advice and only used 1/4 c. sugar. In my opinion, it would've been way too sweet with more.

I hate to put a bad review among all these great reviews, but I just didn't have any luck with this. I've tried it twice, the 2nd time I put ginger slices and pepper in the vinegar mixture while it reduced as suggested and it was still "blah". I thought it was a lot of work for a so-so result. My husband says he likes my recipe better (just thinly sliced cucumbers w/ vinegar, water, sugar, salt and pepper). The pineapple was too much (even though I only used a tiny bit the second time around). I'm glad others have had more success that I, but I won't be trying this again.

Even my kids liked this one, despite the jalapenos. I tried it to use up garden cukes and lettuce, and it was perfect. I only had black sesame seeds, so I used them and they were very colorful.

I have spied this receipe up-when making the dressing, I add a couple slices of ginger and a couple cayenne peppers, I also double the liquids.When the dressing has reduced by half, strain and discard solids.I also add grated ginger to the salad and an extra pepper. This cuts the sweetness and adds the extra "heat" the salad needs. It is wonderful for a summer cookout. All our friends ask me to make this when we get together.

I loved this salad and like the others, used less sugar (1/4 cup).

The general consensus seems to be that it is too sweet. Next time, I'll cut way back on the sugar if I use fresh pineapple again. Maybe canned unsweetened pineapple is the answer? Was it just me or was there a lot of liquid in this salad?

We followed all of the instructions to the letter but were disappointed in the outcome. The ingredients made us think "zing" but the taste was quite subtle and sweet. It seemed like a lot of work for such a mundane end product.

This was wonderful. Will definitely keep around for those picnic ideas!

This is one of the nicest summer salads I have ever had. I would definitely make it again.

I prepared this salad for a 4th of July picnic this weekend. Everyone loved it! The hostess asked for the recipe. I doubled the recipe (but not the marinade) and found it to be delicious. Next time though I will cut the sugar down, with the pineapple it was almost too sweet
