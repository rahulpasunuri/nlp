I just made this for the second time and this is yummy. I mixed the dressing and let it sit in the fridge for a while before tossing it with the pasta which I'd recommend because I found the lemon flavor too strong. I used "light" mayo and light sour cream and after adjusting the amounts, I probably used 3/4 cup each to tone down the lemon. Only used 3 Tbsp olive oil. I added red and orange bell pepper for color and crunch and also added scallops. I love cold salads for dinner on hot summer evenings, and this is a good one. Just be sure to taste/adjust the dressing before you toss and do save the pasta water in case you want to thin it down a bit.

This is a definite summer crowd pleaser! I've made it several times for parties and it's always a hit.

I made this recipe and substituted cilantro for tarragon. We also used 1/2 cup chopped celery.

We grow saffron (it's easy to do if you live in zones 6-9) and are always looking for new recipes to use it in. This is one we will be preparing again and again. It's tasty, light and refreshing . . . a great summer entree.

I have made this dish a few times. It is a great salad on a hot summer day. I have had tons of complements on it. I make this salad every summer.

The mixture of ingredients sounded really good. I made this for my guesses and they found the mayonaise and sour cream to be over powering masking the taste of the shrimps and crab meat. Additionally, the consistancy is too thick. If I were to make it again, I would definitely eliminates the mayo and use very little sour cream.

Aside from being introduced to the campanelle pasta (very pretty, excellent texture for salads!), this recipe was quite disappointing. Followed the recipe exactly. Refrigerated for 2 hours. (It's like my taste buds couldn't figure out what taste it was going for, so it just settled for bland).

Used lowfat ingredients to lower calories. Tasty summer salad. Loved the saffron. Will probably make again next summer

The tarragon compliments the crab beautifully here -- very nice. I accidentally added three cloves of garlic (before I read the recipe carefully enough to realize it wasn't called for, it had already been chopped with the dill and tarragon and added to the sauce), which did no harm at all. The only other major change was I used a full lb of crabmeat to avoid having to deal with leftover crab. I'm not sure the pasta is necessary to this dish, though I am going to try the rice suggestion below.

Loved the dish & it was a hit. However, I would add more shrimp and celery. I also added lemon pepper and that gave it a little more zing.

Didn't like this at all - the lemon and tarragon are overwhelming.

This was good, but try using rice instead of pasta. That's the way it's made in Italy and it adds to the texture and taste of the dish.

I made this for my Labor Day barbecue as a change from traditional macaroni salad. It was delicious. I did reduce the amount of olive oil, and used my usual substitution of fat-free sour cream, and reduced fat mayo.

This was delicious, I added 2 cloves of crushed garlic and used imitation crab meat. Everyone enjoyed it.

Used dried herbs, imitation crabmeat, and omitted the sour cream. Great light lemon-herb taste.

Awesome; drew rave reviews. Served it with champagne which provided a sweet complement.

Followed the recipe exactly. None of my family liked it and said it had an odd taste. I felt it was the saffron and too much lemon juice. Would not make this again.

I thought the dressing was just a little heavy and gave this an odd taste. Perhaps omitting the saffron, and decreasing the amount of mayo and sour cream, might fix it, allowing the lemon and herb flavors to shine.

Company-worthy, beautiful, and tasty! I followed the recipe exactly, but omitted the water. I made the dressing and kept it in the fridge and tossed it with the other ingredients right before eating. Also, I used imitation crab with great results. Normally, I would be the first to spring for the REAL crab, but in this tasty menagerie, I don't think anyone objected to the imitation crab! It added some sweetness that I would have missed otherwise.

I love this salad. It's a perfect summer lunch and very company worthy. I added coarsely diced tomatoes and shredded carrots for color/kicks. I've made twice-never had to add water. Used penne and served over red leaf lettuce. A keeper!

This salad is very good and something I would order in a restaurant but now I don't have to. My husband enjoyed it also but my teenage sons would have preferred warm shrimp. It would be a great addition to a salad buffet.

I love this recipe. I've made it twice already. I think it's a perfect summer (almost) no-cook recipe. To fix the dressing problem of the previous reviewer, add the water that is recommended. The first time I made it I didn't add water and it was dry. The second time I did add it and though it seemed too runny immediately after adding the water, the pasta and fish absorbed and left a nice creamy dressing.

I was really disappointed with this recipe. I was so excited to make it and it just didn't meet my expectations. I completely agree that the dressing should go on very shortly before you serve. I made it the night before and found it to be a totally different consistency the next morning. It was very good but not better than other similar pasta salads that I make with just veggies and mayo. I splurged and spent $16 on saffron threads and was really expecting something spectacular and in my opinion it was just average.

Made this for a family together--wowed them--couldn't find campanelle pasta--used small shells--always have dungeness crab in freezer--good way to use

Delicious, fresh and perfect for summer eats. I omitted the crab as well as it just seemed a little over the top with both. My only observation with this recipe is that the pasta tends to absorb every drop of dressing, so the next time I make this I will dress it at the last minute.

Yum! The flavors are really unique and fresh in this. I had powdered saffron instead of threads and I think it had a more intense saffron taste, but I liked it that way. I don't care for capers so I left them out. I didn't have access to fresh tarragon and dill so I used dried (in smaller quantities), but fresh would have been better. I used only shrimp instead of crab because I was putting enough of an investment into this new recipe as it was (with buying saffron), but I don't think I missed it. The flavors were pretty assertive for the crab.

This was very good even after I omitted the extra 5 tbsp of olive oil and the crab.

Outstanding. A great salad meal for summer. Instant favorite.
