Oh, dear! I did not like this AT ALL ! The livers baked well on little "spiedini" and that method might come in handy for another recipe, but the taste was not good. The recipe has much too much lemon zest and that plus vinegar really dominated. Also, the rosemary needles stayed hard and sharp, and the red peppers stayed raw. No salt or pepper is mentioned in the recipe though I put some on before roasting.

Mõni võib arvata, et võibolla hindasin üle seda rooga, aga mulle isiklikult meeldis. Proovige ise!

The secret to success for this recipe is the minced lemon peel in the dressing; the flavor really comes through. I substituted cherry tomatoes and baby bella mushrooms for part of the red pepper squares; worked out fine.
