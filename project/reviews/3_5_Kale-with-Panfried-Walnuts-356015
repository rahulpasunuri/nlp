This was my first kale experience and I am a convert. After squeezing the liquid from the kale I chopped it. I sautéed two strips of diced bacon (for 1 lb kale) then added the garlic, kale and nuts. Finished with a squeeze of lemon. I will make this often.

This tasted great and was healthy. My husband and I cleaned out the bowl. I wouldn't change a thing.

Yum! Though I made several changes. Sauteed walnuts with more garlic, a serrano pepper and a summer squash. And added chopped preserved lemon and a grating of parmesan at the end.

Just made this. Used 1/2 lb kale and about 1/3-1/2 cup walnuts, 2 cloves garlic (almost all recipes I've seen underuse garlic), and olive oil. It's alright. Nothing special, like someone else mentioned. Could use a little something. Tried the lemon others have suggested. Not bad. Next time I would definitely sautee onions with the garlic. I'm normally too lazy to prepare kale and this was quick enough... I say I wouldn't make it again because this recipe is so simple that if I changed anything it wouldn't be the same recipe.

One of my go to recipes! I actually hated kale before trying this, but have now started cooking with it much more often (there is a recipe for a kale and brussels sprouts salad on here that is also very good). I did use butter instead of oil and pecans instead of walnuts - yum.

This is a very delicious and easy way to eat kale. I used pine nuts instead of walnuts because thats what I had in my fridge. It was very tasty and added nice flavor. I also doubled the amount of garlic, added a squirt of lemon juice and sprinkled a little parmesan on top. Finally I served it over a bed of quinoa. It was very good. I will definitely make this again!

Yum. Simple and yummy. Really just a vehicle for toasted walnuts with garlic!

Easy delicious recipe. Goes great under grilled chicken or fish!

This is great. I prepared as suggested. However, I think the recipe would greatly benefit from a little squirt of lemon juice. There's something lacking, and I think that the acidity from lemon juice would make this a really great simple dish instead of something that is tasty but not really great.

tasty. my leafy green phobic wife still needed to have a little sweetness added to the mix. a little brown sugar worked.

This was great! Made my boyfriend eat his words about kale being gross. Maybe it's the blanching in boiling salted water that makes it so good, but I really liked it and will make again!

So good! Even my teenage daughter loved it. It's a keeper

As a vegan, I appreciate any recipe that gives more more protein. In this case, the walnuts. And this was delicious and so easy to prepare. Definitely make it again, just as is.

I'm vegetarian and made this as a side to soyrizo and eggs for brunch. It was delicious - hubby loved it too. I'm curious if the kale retains it's vitamins with the boiling and sauteeing, though - I'll try steaming next time. Still fiber is always good.

I used lagunitas kale, as was suggested by some other reviewers, and maybe 4 cloves of garlic for this. I have to say, I've always considered kale to be a difficult food. This is not to suggest that I don't like it, indeed I have always been #1 fan of the earthy tones and bitter taste. But I've also only ever considered kale to be a crunchy, earthy, bitter green. That said, this recipe has changed my view of kale. It was soft, almost sweet, and, well, still earthy, but the cooked walnuts complimented the green perfectly. They bring out a lovely nutty flavor that gives kale an almost delicate flavor. I will definitely make this again. It makes for a wonderfully simple, easy, and surprisingly yummy snack.

Very good, very easy. I steamed the kale so it did not have to be squeezed.

Excellent kale recipe...everyone loved it. I steamed the kale and kept tasting it until it was done. It took about 25 minutes, but tht's at an altitude of 8,600 feet! I used half evoo and half veg. oil. Added a handful of cranberries which added a nice contrast of sweetness. Delicious and healthy!

Turned out well, but should have boiled the kale a bit longer. I can't believe how shriveled up the kale gets after boiling, it almost shrinks down to nothing.

Excellent dish. Like a reader suggested, I steamed the kale, no need to dry. This was just like fried greens we had at a restaurant in Ohio. Will definitely make this dish again & again.

I've already made it twice. Quick, healthy and delicious. Pine nuts and peanuts are great options too.

Very fast and flavorful. I used best quality olive oil to finish, red pepper flakes and just tossed minced raw garlic to with Kale while still warm from the pot. The garlic softened but stayed very flavorful. My picky teen finished his portion and asked for more. A keeper.

I would not recommend this recipe at all. I reviewed it in detail at http://misschefy.wordpress.com

I made a whole meal out of this. I steamed the kale, dried it a little and put it in a large bowl. I added red pepper flakes to the garlic cooking in the oil. Then I added some cooked chicken pieces to the pan so the chicken could soak in some of the flavor. Then I dumped everything into the large bowl with the kale and tossed it. Delicious.

Used a double boiler so that the kale (Lacinata) could steam. Didn't count the time, I just tasted leaves until they weren't bitter. Let's say about 10 minutes. Also used a mix of almonds and pumpkin seeds and half the oil instead. While this recipe needs a bit more garlic, it was very tasty and filling. With some hearty corn bread and marinated tofu, this made for a complete vegan meal (brunch, actually).

Loved this simple and tasty dish. But I feel compelled to ask: why in this day and age (when we think we know better) would we boil this nutritious green leafy vegetable when research has demonstrated that vitamins are water soluble and to boil vegetables will rinse them out of most of their nutrients? I preserved the cooking water for soups. After all if you choose kale for health reasons, you may want to preserve its vitamin K, C, manganese and iron. Next time, I will try steaming it. Additionally, I discovered that the cooking time depends on the variety of kale you use. Lacinato kale only took 6 minutes to perfection.

I've made this twice, once with purple kale and once with curly kale. It was delicious and easy each time. The purple kale was freshly picked today and didn't need the full 6 minutes to cook.

I cooked the kale for 9 minutes and that seemed just right. I was too stingy with salt and pepper during prep so we added some at the table. It was a no-go with my two year old (who loves spinach) but I'll keep trying. I had the heat up too high for the walnuts and charred a couple of them. Heed the "medium-low" instruction.

went with the previous reviewers and boiled the kale for 9-10 minutes or so. also subbed hazelnuts at the last minute as I discovered I was out of walnuts, but that was actually a pretty tasty second choice. Will definitely make this again - although probably with a little less oil than it called for.

This recipe hits my top three requirements: fast, easy and delicious. I did a full bed of this kale recipe on dinner plates and topped with a chicken breast that I salt and peppered, baked with honey mustard on top. The sweetness of the mustard was the perfect pairing with this kale. I had enough left over for dinner the next night and it was just as good on day two. Loved it!

This was very good but I agree that perhaps a little longer than 6 minutes on the cooking time would be ideal. Also, next time I will cook the garlic a little longer too as well as be a little more liberal with the salt and pepper. Lastly, this dish not reheat well and turned rather rubbery when microwaved. Next time, I'll try re-warming it in a pan or just cooking half the kale and half the walnuts and making the rest as I need it.

This dish was ok. I served it at a dinner party and everyone ate most of it -- even the carnivores. The recipe _definitely_ does not allow for enough cooking time. I liked how the bitterness of the greens mixed with the richness of the walnuts. Overall, though, I thought it was ok . . .but not fabulous.

Loved the toasted walnuts and garlic. Disagree with cooking the Kale only 6 minutes. It was a bit tough and could have gone several more minutes. Also disagree with serving @ room temperature. Definatley better fresh out of the pan!
