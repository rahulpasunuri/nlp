This was decent, but I will not make again. Mine just turned out way too sweet! And, I like sweet! Too much honey and sugar together. I did like the consistency of the pudding though, and it looked great. I like the pumpkin bread pudding better.

Very interesting and VERY good! I ended up with two 11 x 7 pans and a smaller one. The recipe calls for too much custard (or, conversely, too little peanut butter); so I made one small dish without peanut butter (still good). I left out the jam (personal preferences) and only used 1 cup of honey in the p.butter (I like less sweet rather than more sweet). IMPORTANT: DO USE shallow pan of water under baking pans when baking, or else bottom of baking dish will burn. As I said, you may leave out peanut butter and still have a fine bread pudding. For Xmas, I used egg nog in place of milk and cream, and added raisins and walnuts: yummy and holidayish. Problem: I didn't know what a "Pullman" loaf was (and still don't!) [If anyone knows, I'd appreciate an email! thanks,] so I used a loaf of plain white bread. In another pan, I used whole wheat bread instead of white. Your individual tastes rule. Great recipe!
