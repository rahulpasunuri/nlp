Tried this recipe last night to change up my go to favorite feta and spinach stuffed chicken. I used dry sun dried tomatoes instead of the oil packed and I added some sauteed spinach to the stuffing. I also topped with a pan sauce made with white wine, broth and butter. The result? This is my new favorite stuffed chicken recipe! It came out perfectly most and super flavorful.

How exactly did you make your pan sauce? It sounds yummy...

Just made this dish, and it is great. It is very moist and flavorful. I did add shallots and garlic and used thawed and sauted aritchokes. And I made a pan sauce with chicken broth, white wine, cream, and a bit of parmesan cheese in the chicken pan. Yummy!

I love the cooking METHOD; however, if you'll notice, ALL OF THE REVIEWERS seem to have changed out ingredients. This recipe is very poorly written. As written you end up with wayyyy too much filling. The chicken itself needed help. Will use this method with other ingredients.

Yikes! I went searching for "healthy" recipes and up popped this one. Are you kidding? At nearly 500 calories per serving and 32 grams of fat [OMG] how can this be considered healthy? No doubt a tasty dish but I'll save these kinds of calories for other things ... like chocolate fudge sundaes. Happy cooking.

Have made this a few times and it's a relatively easy favorite. Messed up once and bought artichoke bottoms by mistake. Used them anyway, and you know what? That was pretty darned good too! I found that a boning knife made easier work making the pockets. Served with acini di pepe with lemon and pepper (also from this site) and either asparagus or rapini.

I loved this recipe - at least I loved it the way I made it. Instead of artichokes, I used copped onion and spinach. I didn't use quite as much cheese as the recipe called for to make it healthier, and instead of cooking it on the skillet for a minute I just cooked it in the oven for 25 minutes. I also put chopped garlic on top of the chicken to give it flavor. DELICIOUS!!

It wasn't exactly what I was looking for. It was missing that "special something". I will make it again but next time I plan on adding more cheese and maybe some garlic inside the breast. Check out exactly how I made it at FoodieBecomesHer dot com.

I also used Parmesan instead and it was delish. Will definitely make this again :) takes 5 min to prepare when you throw the tomatoes, cheese and artichokes in a Ninja! EASY!

Great combo of flavors. I loved this and will make it again! I added sliced and pitted kalamata olives to the mix. Fontina is a GREAT cheese. I pounded out chicken tender strips because I didn't have chicken breasts on hand, and then put a dollop of mixture in the center, rolled them up, and sealed with a toothpick. Cooked them on the stove in a thin layer of oil and did not transfer to the oven in order to eliminate cooking methods.

Switched out sun dried tomatoes for spinach, which I wilted in a fry pan in a big of bacon grease (bacon used in the fresh green beans). Used good parm. cheese instead of Fontina. Topped the chicken with remaining stuffing before baking. Am wondering if the browning before baking could be replaced by removing cover from chicken when nearly done baking and turning up the oven to let the chicken brown? Fairly easy prep and clean up. Like others, baked the chicken longer than the recipe directed - 25 minutes.

All the reviews were helpful, I used roasted red pepper and artichokes with oil, slightly strained. Only had dries basil with garlic mixture.Sprinkled 1tblsp. Only had 3 breast,used half of ingredients. Secured breast with toothpicks , may try roll up method next time. Used a cast iron skillet and did 3 turns on top of stove about 2 min,each. Poured about half cup of chicken broth in skillet before I baked in oven for 20 min.. Served with pasta and green beans. My son whom is 15, said good,not knowing about artichokes as I diced them and peppers farily small. Nice!

Rating: 3
Made this tonight. For speed and ease, this should get five forks. Really, really simple to put this together. I had a three cheese blend that was on sale which I substituted for the Fontina, but honestly, you could use any good melting cheese. The time is way too low (as others have stated), but the resulting flavors are exceptional. Very Mediterranean. This could use a sauce, but I didn't have a problem without one. Probably depends on how much time you want to spend on this dish.

This is a recipe that's in my regular rotation. I find it relatively easy to make and full of flavour. I do find that the amounts for the filling that are in the recipe are too much because I can never fit it all in and am always left with leftover filling.

Rating: 3
Very tasty. I added a few chopped black olives and substituted the fontina with 1/2 Mozza 1/2 Parmesan. Took another suggestion on this page and added a cup of chicken broth and the rest of the mixture in pan when placed in the oven. Had to cook for 25 minutes to get rid of all the pink flesh.

Rating: 4
Very easy and delicious. I used a 4- cheese pre-grated mixture (from Trader Joes). I used all of the artichoke/tomato/cheese mixture -- after I stuffed the chickens I threw the extra mixture loose in the pan and cooked it all together, which worked perfectly. The final outcome was delicious and looked beautiful. I made it with rice, and will make a green vegetable as well, next time.

Rating: 3
I substituted roasted red peppers for the tomatoes (I don't like sun-dried tomatoes) and I couldn't find artichokes in oil, so I drained the water-packed ones I found really well and put a drizzle of olive oil in the filling to bind it. It came out really well using a cast iron skillet. I added some chicken broth and the extra filling to the pan before putting it in the oven to make a sauce as one reviewer suggested. It was great. I also used Fontal cheese instead of Fontina. It was a lot cheaper at Whole Foods ($9.99 per pound vs. $18.99 per pound). Worked great!

Rating: 3
I've noticed all the comments about the leftover filling, so I thought I'd add that when this recipe appeared in Bon Appetit, it was very clear that only half the filling was to be used. The other half was intended for a frittata, so as to use one prep for two separate meals...

This was very very good considering how quickly it came together. Great for a a nice weeknight meal, but would also serve it to company. I will definitely be making this again! www.whitefluffyicing.com

This was very taste with a few modifications. Used feta cheese instead of fontina and used dry sun dried tomatoes instead of marinated ones. Had 3 chicken breasts and kind of winged the proportions of the filling ingredients. I sliced clear through the chicken a couple of times when I was trying to make the pocket, but I closed up the holes with toothpicks and the chicken fused back together. Another significant modification is that we grilled the chicken instead of baking. It came out moist and delicious. The filling was VERY flavorful- I would almost call it strong. You don't need much in each bite. Served with haricots verts with red pepper relish (epicurious recipe) and baked potato

Rating: 4
Tasty! I forgot to add the basil, but didn't seem to miss it. It was quick & easy. A great mid-week meal. FYI: you can cut the recipe in half for two tho, and the chicken takes about 20 min. to cook. I'll make this again (and again, and again).

This was lovely. Quick, easy, and impressive. Did cook longer than recipe suggested, as chicken breasts do range in size! Did top with a little parmesan.

As with other reviewers, there is probably twice as much filling as one needs. Instead of cutting it, though, I added it to the saute pan with a bit of olive oil and chicken broth and drizzled it over the breasts before puttting them in the oven. Made this for a large pre- wedding party and the guests (lots from S. America) all asked for the recipe. Simple, tasty and colorful.

Rating: 4
I thought this was GREAT! So did my husband, who can be picky. He suggested we try adding some pine nuts next time (but not much, because the flavors are strong). The only change I made was to flip the chicken and fry 2-3 more minutes on the second side before I transfered to the oven. Turned out perfect! =)

I used a combination of feta and parmesan cheeses, added oregano, and put chicken broth in the pan when the chicken went into the oven plus added 10 minutes to the cooking time. Just delicious!

I have made this recipe several times. I love it and so do my bachelor friends who turn to me for a home-cooked meal! A huge hit every time. This recipe makes way more filling than is necessary though, so I just cut it in half and it's perfect. I usually serve it with russet potatoes cut in half and baked in olive oil, salt and pepper. Add in a good glass of Merlot and you have yourself a fine meal!

I thought that this was a delicious weeknight meal, although my boyfriend thought that the filling was overwhelmingly strong. We seared the chicken breasts and then added chicken stock to the pan. That way, the chicken came out incredibly moist because it was basically braising in the oven. We then reduced the stock to make a delicious sauce. I would love to make this again; we'll see if the boyfriend can be convinced.

I thought this was delicious. I did have to leave it in the oven a little longer than 10 minutes for it to cook all the way through. Maybe it was because my chicken breasts were a little bigger than 5 oz, but it was a good 15-17 minutes in the oven before they were done. But they came out nice and moist and the filling was very tasty.

I thought it was pretty good, but not fabulous. I may make it again but will probably but a little butter or something in the pouch along with the cheese and vegetables next time. I did not use oil packed anything and it ended up insufficiently moist.

I saw this recipe in the magazine and thought it looked delicious. I did use fresh basil and instead of making a pocket in the chicken, I pounded it out, laid the filling on top, then rolled the chicken and secured with toothpicks. I wanted to serve it with a bit of sauce over pasta, so I sauteed some garlic and mushrooms in white wine, then added about a cup of chopped tomatoes and a little bit of Italian seasonings. Once I had the chicken ready, I poured the sauce in the baking dish, then put the chicken on top to cook. It came out really tasty. In the magazine, it tells you how to make a frittata using the leftover filling. The fritatta was easy to make and delicious. Unfortunately, I threw out the magazine and now can't remember how to make the frittata! We will definitely have this again.

For 2 of us, I made this using 1 10-ounce chicken breast from my freezer. I pounded the breast, put the filling down the middle and rolled. Very good and quite easy.

All I had from this recipe was artichokes, so I just stuffed with artichoke and pecorino romano cheese. Even so, it was delicious, the chicken came out tender and moist. Considering how simple it was to make, I was very impressed. Had to cook it considerably longer than 10 minutes though. I had thick breasts and they took almost 20 in the oven. Can't wait to try with proper ingredients.

This is such a simple, fantastic recipe! I add a little chopped garlic to the filling - though the recipe doesn't really need to be tweeked and would be great either way. I recommend cutting the initial slit small (i.e., one inch), then using your knife to go back and forth inside of the chicken to form the pocket. The chicken holds the delicious filling better that way.

Loved this recipe. Used a packaged 6 cheese mix instead of just fontina. Once the chicken was almost done in the oven, I put the skillet back on the burner(with chicken still in the pan) and deglazed with white wine and then whisked in fatfree sour cream for a light sauce. My friends loved it! Served with ravioli that I had cooked earlier in the day and then toasted in a pan with butter and garlic. Some bread and great wine, and you are good to go!

This is a good recipe: it is quick, uses just a few easy ingredients and has big, bold flavors that come through. Unlike other reviewers, I really stuffed the breasts and had none of the filling left over. The filling is what makes the recipe... why be parsimonious? I think next time I might use a thinner cut or pound it and try to make a roll with the filling, or at least have it more evenly distributed. Try it: it's quick, easy and good.

Very yummy and so easy! I halved the recipe for 2 chicken breasts and had a lot of stuffing left over (can't wait to toss with some pasta!). I used dried sundried tomatoes that I rehydrated in warm water, and sprinkled paprika on chicken along w/ the salt and pepper. Also substituted gouda cheese. Used chicken breasts that hadn't totally thawed--made for really easy stuffing w/o tearing, even if it did increase the oven time quite a bit. Delicious fresh and as leftovers!

This was a great way to make chicken although I did make several changes. Rather than having leftover stuffing, I estimated how much I would need for 2 breasts. Next I pounded the breasts to approx 1/4" to 1/3", placed the stuffing on one half of the breast and folded it securing each side with a metal skewer. I sauted a chopped garlic clove and the breasts in 2 teaspoons of the sun-dried tomato oil for 2 minutes on each side finishing the baking in the oven as directed-- although it took approx 20 minutes not the 10 as indicated in the recipe. After the breasts were baked, I placed them on a plate, covered with foil and made a sauce consisting of 1/2 cup each of white wine and chicken broth and 1/2 t herbes de provence. Bring to a boil scraping up the bits in the pan,then add 2 t cornstarch which has been combined with 2 T or so of fresh lemon juice. Cook until thickened. Garnish with fresh parsley. I served the chicken with orzo and green beans. Delish!!

I promised my mom that I would cook once a week for my parents and siblings - this recipe was a hit, and seems much more impressive than the work it requires. I added some kalamata olives to the stuffing, used shredded swiss cheese, and when I served it, I plated the breasts whole and drizzled them with extra virgin olive oil. Next time I'll add a white wine when it goes in the oven to de-glaze the pan and make a sauce of sorts...

A fantastic easy and elegant dish. I was amazed that it only took me an hour from start to finish - and that included prep, cooking, eating and cleaning - and nothing was sacrificed. The chicken was tender, moist, and flavorful. I used the sun-dried tomato oil to cook the breasts in and that was a good idea. I can't wait to make this one again. Also, this recipe can be easily adjusted in order to cook for one, but the stuffing was delicious over the pasta I made to go with this dish that I will probably make the same amount but reserve the stuffing for pasta dishes later in the week.

This is an easy and delicious week night recipe. I used less cheese than called for to see if I could lose some calories (worked fine). I also pureed the mixture in a food processor, since I thought it would be easier for stuffing. The following night, I added the puree to some Classico sauce and served over pasta while my husband claimed the last chicken breast. It was great both ways. As an aside, I added a clove of garlic to the mixture and included smoked mozzarella as well, since I had some in the fridge.

Marvelous flavor, easy to prepare and elegant enough for company. I found it easier to make the pocket when the chicken was still just slightly frozen (Costco boneless breasts). I didn't have fresh basil on hand, so I used some Trader Joe's pesto and it worked great. I spread a little into each pocket before adding the artichoke mixture. I followed previous reviews and used some of the oil from the sun-dried tomatoes to saute chicken...perfect flavor! Served with pesto pasta (TJ's pesto plus leftover artichoke mixture). Ymmm!

This was excellent! I took another reviewer's suggestion and roasted a red pepper and used that instead of sundried tomatoes (not a fan). I also added a large minced clove of garlic (through a press), and used 2 T of fresh basil. Just make sure your chicken is at room temp before you cook it otherwise it will be dry. I pan sauteed for 3 minutes at med-high and baked for 11 min., then let it rest for 5 min. and it was perfect. Nice pan sauce, too. Lots of flavor for a little bit of effort. Will make again and again.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipes mild and pleasing flavors. I followed the recipe nearly exactly, except that I substituted two tablespoons of fresh basil for the dried. I used poultry pins to close the pocket on the chicken and added four minutes to the frying time (turning the chicken to fry all four sides) and ten minutes to the baking time. After baking, I removed the chicken breasts from the skillet, and deglazed the skillet with 1/4 cup of chardonnay and 1/4 cup of chicken broth. I boiled the liquids down while I cooked up a batch of packaged fresh linguini. I served the chicken on top of the linguini, pouring the glaze overall (the glaze had an excellent flavor). On the side, I served halved grape tomatoes (warmed on a cookie sheet in the oven, while the linguini was cooking) sprinkled with chopped fresh basil and a tiny sprinkle of freshly grated parmesan. It all made for a pretty presentation, with a nice mix of flavors. I highly recommend this recipe.

I used large chicken breats, but pounded them a bit to even out the thickness so they would cook through in less time. The pockets did hold up even though I poked through... The left over stuffing didn't turn out anything like a pancake and was a bit too salty w/o the chicken. Next time I'll just over-stuff the chicken more. With a side of broccoli and grape tomatoes - delicious!

Having never tried to stuff chicken breasts before, I was impressed with how well they held up. I would advise against freezer breasts ... the fresh ones are thicker and much easier to pocket. The only problem with the thicker breasts is cook-time. I had to double the frying and baking time to cook through, but they came out moist and DELICIOUS! I mixed in some spinach and parm with the ingredients listed and served over bowtie pasta (which I tossed with olive oil and italian seasonings). Served with oil/garlic fried asparagus. It was fantastic!

My husband called this "my best yet." After reading all the reviews I decided to improvise a sauce. Instead of putting the skillet in the oven, after cooking in skillet I moved the chicken onto a baking pan. Then in the same skillet I put some white wine, some promise margarine, about two spoonfuls of the stuffing and some oregano, salt and pepper and let it heat up. I used that as the sauce over the chicken and served with Near east garlic and herbs brown rice mix and steamed broccoli.

Very flavorful and yet simple. One thing that is good to add to the stuffing is a bit of minced garlic--goes nicely with all the ingredients for the stuffing. I like the fact that most of the ingredients for this dish are in the pantry/freezer (except for the basil, which really does add a nice fresh note). We've made this twice this week and will keep making it.

Quick and delicious. I used cutlets rather than breast-halves, 10 min oven time was perfect. Making the pockets in cutlets is a bit tricky, just press down while cutting and go slow. Stuff in as much as possible without breaking the meat. I cooked them in the pan on both sides for about 2- 3 min total before baking. Used the rest of the mix with a little EVOO in another pan... let the cheese cook like a pancake, then scrape the whole thing off and flip it. Poured the juice from the baked chicken over everything, no need for a sauce.

Delicious flavors. For us, the sundried tomato overpowered a *bit* too much. I had a bit of difficulty cutting the chicken at first, but easily got control of myself and the knife ;) Though a vegetarian, I tried a tiny spoonful so I could understand how the flavors mingled. Really delicious. Though I made it just on Monday, my picky boyfriend has begged for me to make it again already. Word to the wise.

Made this recipe with tenderloins instead on breasts, and was still amazing.

This dish turned out wonderfully. My chicken breasts ended up rather overstuffed, so there was no "closing" or "sealing," instead I just placed them in the skillet like pita sandwiches and seared briefly on either side. Then I arranged them in a circle and piled the rest of the "stuffing" in the middle and threw it all in the oven. It did indeed take longer than the prescribed 10 minutes to cook; about twice as long. But the chicken was moist and the "stuffing" warm and gooey and flavorful. All in all, the recipe was pretty straightforward and easy, and the results were very tasty! Substituted mozzarella for the fontina and served with almond rice pilaf and a green vegetable.

I thought this was very good. Baked the chicken a little longer but it was moist and flavorful. Served with plain spaghetti and broccoli. Definitely will make again.

The preparation was very easy and the chicken came out well (although we sprinkled additional italian seasonings to the chicken before baking). I think the dish needs some sort of sauce to add to the flavor. There was plenty of "stuffing" leftover so we used it for a frittata and also stuffed it into pita bread and grilled. Both delicious! We'll definitely make this dish again (next time with a sauce).

My husband and I really enjoyed this although we felt it needed a sauce to add more flavor. Since I didn't have fontina cheese on hand I used a mix of mozzarela and asiago cheese. There was plenty of "stuffing" leftover so we used it to make a frittata and also stuffed it in a pita pocket and grilled it. We'll definitely make this again!

Great recipe for a weeknight meal and leftover filling makes a delicious frittata for the next day. My five year old loved both dishes!

i really enjoyed making this recipe. The ingridients were easy and the only part I had a little bit of difficulty with was cutting the pocket hole in the chicken...I kept going through to the other side! Other than that it was delicious and moist! Next time I would like to experiment with some kind of a sauce.

I was very excited to try out my first recipe from Ms. Finley. I must have used too thick a chicken breast because it took way longer than 10 minutes for the chicken to cook through. So the meat came out dry. The stuffing was delicious.

I liked this. The cheese made it delicious. I had extra stuffing so topped the chix with that when it was baking. My boyfriend thought it could have used a sauce - marina, light pesto or white wine to add a little more flavor. I used fresh basil and think that made a big difference - dried is so bland.

Good recipe fairly simple. I made bigger pockets in the chicken and used more of the stuffing so that it was more evenly distributed. Also good cold the next day.

I made this for my family of 6. My kids seemed to like it and my husband said it was good enough to cook again. The chicken is juicy and flavorful. My kids did shy away from the sundried tomatoes but I think they will like them in time. (They are only 5, 3, 2, and infant)

The chicken was dry and not enough stuffing for the meat. The stuffing was great melted in with the pasta, so that was the best part of the meal. If i try it again, I would try flattening the chicken and rolling the stuffing inside.

This was easy and delicious. I didn't have fontina cheese on hand so I subbed in gruyere with better than expected results. I served it to various teens and some 12-year old boys and they scarfed it down. I especially liked the sear-bake technique which resulted in very moist and perfectly cooked chicken in 10-12 minutes. I'll definitely teach the boys to make this.
