Giving 3 forks bc I'm a very picky person. I made this twice. The first time I experimented and put a ton of Myers dark rum (1/4C-I think or 1/2) delicious. This time I tried to stick to the recipe- a little I used double the rum. I preferred the flavor of the rum but if you have family who doesn't want the heavy rum flavor stick to the recipe. I will def make this again.

I decided to get an Epicurious account just to give this recipe 4 forks. Follow this recipe to the letter and you will create the ideal marble cake: soft, dense, and very finely grained, with rich chocolate flavor and a beautifully defined swirl. Ensure that the cake has time to rest overnight for the best flavor and texture.

Yes, this cake is very very dry, even with very careful baking. It might have been ok right out of the oven but I first tried it about 10 hours later (stored airtight). However, it is also quite pretty, with a nice flavor, so I don't want to give up on it until I try to work on it a bit. I might try the sour cream as suggested by some others.

Very good recipe! Super yum. I followed suggestions and added vanilla extract and some sour cream. Deeelish. Not overly sweet, but very rich. Becareful baking; 1 hour was a little too much for my cake. I would say check at 45 or 50 minutes.

this cake does not work well with a tube pan at all. also the chocolate batter was much too thick and thus did not marble well. i think i might make this cake again, but making sure to use a bundt pan and maybe adding more milk or rum to the chocolate batter to make it not so thick.

I would like to make this cake however I noticed that the recipe does not call for baking powder or baking soda. Am I missing something?

I wrote a review on this recipe yesterday, and I feel as if I must amend what I said. The first day we ate the cake, we didn't like it. Last night I served it with a tiny bit of ice cream on the top to help cut the dryness that we found the first night. Well, believe it or not, the cake got better after aging a day. It really did. It may not be a cake I would bake again, but the second day it tasted much better than the first. Just a heads-up in case you are baking it to serve the same evening.

I have made quite a few bundt cakes, and this recipe is one I won't bake again. The cake is far too dry. I followed the directions exactly since this is the first time I've tried this one, but it is simply not worth the effort. Try the pumpkin-chocolate bundt if you want to make a delicious cake. This one is not.

Fantastic!!! This was my first marble cake ever and the result was amazing. The cake didn't last long in my house as everyone ate, even my father, who is not a fan of sweet things, kept coming into the kitchen to slice off a piece!!! I will surely make this over and over!!!

I have never made a pound cake before and I just did not realize that is what I was making! The base batter was a little dull, even after I added vanilla. The chocolate was amazing- I added the rum just to it as someone else did and I also added a little extra chocolate. This cake was so heavy, but really baked beautifully. It was good with coffee, but a little dry. Maybe less eggs next time.

This makes a great base for Marblecake, having grown up on it back in home in Germany, it reminded me of my grandmothers. I did not add rum to the entire base, but only to the chocolate batter (4 tablespoon), however did add an entire vanilla bean to the entire batter and 2 tablespoon sourcream. For the chocolate batter instead of milk I used sour cream again. Had to use brown sugar, as I was out of white. This is a definite keeper very moist, the rum IMO is a must

This is an excellent recipe. I have read the comments above. I have substituted pure vanilla extract in place of rum, only because I am not fond of alcohol in my desserts. I have also substituted semi-sweet chocolate squares, only because I was too lazy to go the store for one thing in the middle of the night. This cake is very moist with a delicate texture and very much like my grandma used to make in Europe. I will definitely make this again and have added it to my repertoire. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

Good, but definitely not exceptional. The rum flavor is pretty strong

Really good but be sure not to overcook.
