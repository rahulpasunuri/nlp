Used this as the basis for a crockpot dinner with the following changes: sirloin pork roast instead of smoked chops, added a few juniper berries and sprinkled roast with caraway. No tomatoes, but added a little chicken stock. Came home to a wonderful-smelling dish - easy and tasty.

I used less sauerkraut (a 2 lb bag) and substituted ham. Also preboiled the potatoes and used one cup of beef stock. This made it less watery and cooking time was less. Oh, and I sliced and sautéed an onion with the sauerkraut. It was really good.

First review but second time eating. First time I cut the recipe for just the two of us and had no problems. This time i made the whole amount...you need a pot the size of a bathtub in order to be able to stir it.

I didn't boil the chops -- the ones I get are fully cooked and not salty. I also added three chopped carrots to the mix 00;)

As someone who grew up on German food, this dish was really good. Danke Schon
