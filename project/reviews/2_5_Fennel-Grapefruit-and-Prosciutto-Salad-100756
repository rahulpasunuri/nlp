My fennel seemed a little tough when mixed with the other textures. The flavours were lovely though, and the dressing was simple and complimented the salad well. I loved the prosciutto.

I really liked this recipe. It tasted great, looked pretty and wasn't a heavy first course. I did cut the prosciutto into 1/4's for ease in eating. The balance of sweet(I had a really nice sweet red grapefruit), salty, crunchy, bitter was just right!
