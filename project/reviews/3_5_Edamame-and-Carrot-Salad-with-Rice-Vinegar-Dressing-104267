Definitely use sesame oil instead of olive oil. I added the minced ginger and garlic, and chopped the carrots instead of grating them. Nice, light, pretty.

Awesome! I've made this salad a long time ago and loved it then but this time tried it with the changes that others suggested below. Definitely more cilantro, used shallots 'cuz that's what I had and also added radishes. Also, either sesame or olive oil is great with it.

Easy, full of flavor, I didn't have high hopes for this but we loved, loved this simple refreshing salad. Perfect as a side for anything off the grill, especially if the marinade uses Oriental and/or citrus flavors. Even my picky 10 year old loved it. This will become a go to side in the house from now on.

A really nice, simple side as is, with ingredients that I almost always have on hand. I can see how it could be elevated to delicious status with some of the suggested alterations - avocado would be super tasty in this.

In the summertime, I love making big batches of salad and bringing them to work all week long. This was delicious, and inspired me to incorporate a lot more edamame into my salads. The nice thing about frozen edamame is that you don't even have to cook it--just let it thaw and it will retain its crunch.

Based on the reviews, I made some changes to the recipe and it turned out delicious. The changes were: I used equal parts shredded green cabbage, carrots and edamame. I added 1/2 a diced avocado. I doubled the cilantro. I substituted a heaping tablespoon of minced garlic-ginger mixture for the garlic. I substituted thinly sliced shallots for green onions. I substituteded 1 1/2 teaspoons sesame oil + 1 1/2 teaspoons hot chili oil for the vegetable oil. I added black sesame seeds.

Delicious and healthy! Only addition is some much needed salt and pepper, sprinkled on after tossing.

This was really great! I followed the advice in the reviews and used hot chili oil in the dressing. Went very well with the Spicy Calamari with Bacon and Scallions recipe!

Whoda thunk soybeans could be this good? I used frozen also-much easier.Didnt have green onions-used thinly sliced red. We are not cilantro lovers, so just left it out. Took advise from other reviewer and used olive oil. So crisp, crunchy, and colorful! Next day carrots werent as crisp but salad was still yummy. Great for that protein rush!

This is a truly beautiful dish, and I love edamame. I would love to love it, but it was the ONLY dish at my buffet that was not eaten. There is not enough variety in texture to compensate for the blandness of the flavor. Even doubling the cilantro and garlic and adding ginger was not enough to make the dish interesting. So disappointing.

With a few changes and additions, this recipe is amazing. I used toasted sesame oil instead of the bland vegetable oil. I also added 1 Tb. of minced ginger to the dressing and more than tripled the cilantro and garlic. I made this much of the recipe about 3 hours ahead, so it would absorb the flavors, then I added a handful of shredded green cabbage and a handful of mung bean sprouts. I added these after because they may have wilted otherwise. This adds some extra crunch and freshness and is now a favorite in our household.

My entire family enjoys this light, fresh tasting salad. Great with seared ahi tuna.

Actually, it's a 2.5 forks--we didn't find it delicious, but it's better than 2 forks, mostly because of the edamame of which we are huge fans. My husband really did love it; I was less impressed but liked it well enough to make again. I used frozen edamame and they worked beautifully--no need to shell all those pods.

I love this salad for its crunchy texture, beautiful colors, and great taste. I followed the recipe as stated, but then added a few bonus items such as grape tomatoes (halved) and sesame seeds. Also right before serving, I add chunks of avocado. Very easy to make. Yum!

Excellent change of pace for a vegetable. Very easy and quick! Added ~1 scant teaspoon of chili garlic sauce to add the suggested kick. Awesome results! Definitely will keep recipe on hand for summer quick veg!

A wonderful dish to have in the refrigerator as a healthy snack. I substituted shallots for the green onions, and added a dollop of finely minced fresh ginger to give it a little more kick.

Followed the recipe exactly - tripled it for a party. Every bite was gone - all ages raved!!

It was pretty to serve but needs a little extra kick. Maybe more garlic.

I enjoyed this dish very much. Beautiful presentation and fresh tasting. I made it for Easter Sunday using seasoned rice vinegar and sesame oil (just a tad) and leaving out the cilantro. I will be making it for a Mother's Day BBQ but this time I will add a little extra-virgin olive oil and fresh parsley and certainly MUCH more garlic than the recipe calls for. As one person suggested, using the seasoned rice vinegar is a definite plus, although I did not care for the addition of sesame oil. I also think that if you add a little salt and pepper that would help bring out the flavors.

Used as a bed for crab cakes -- very nice. Also like sushi idea. Is it best salad ever eaten? No. But it uses ever-healthful and interesting edamama beans and is light and is fast to make. That makes it a keeper here --

Don't know what the fuss is about. Very so, so and will not make again.

A friend of mine made this and served it with vegetarian chili and cornbread. We asked for the recipe because it was so delicious. It's sort of a combination between a relish and a salad. Great with southern or spicy food!

I copied this recipe exactly and loved it. I had it for about a week and it got better each time I ate it.

This was great. I couldn't find edemame so I juliened some sugar snap peas. I wouldn't eat it all on it's own but as a counter point for sushi it was wonderful. Very fresh and flavorful but not overpowering the fabulous flavor of the sushi which I meant to be the focal point anyway.

My guests and I really liked this, good color, taste and texture. Did not make any changes to the recipe, but will probably make it next time without the oil..didn't feel the need for it. Glad I made it early in the day, it needed the marinating time.

I thought this tasted great. Left out the cilantro because I don't like it. I also let it sit for about 2 hours before serving, and I think that helps.

This was pretty good, not fantastic... I made some changes though. Traded half the oil for some cilantro-flavored olive oil, left out the green onions, added a cup and a half of leftover rice, and sprinkled some sesame oil and seeds over the finished product. Quite a nice touch.

This is very good and I think the proportions are just fine. I also disagree with the comment re: the sesame oil. I tossed the leftovers with some cooled rice (as a previous review suggested), added a bit of sesame oil and it was wonderful.

With this list of ingredients, this recipe seemed like a shoo-in for "Favorites." Yes, I'd still make it again, but would drastically modify the proportions in the process. Way too much carrot and not enough of the "flavorings." Visually beautiful and colorful. Good texture. Use seasoned rice vinegar instead of regular. It just needs more flavor. Sesame oil (though one of my favorite ingredients in the world) doesn't work with this salad.

This is a great recipe. Its a great dish to take to outdoor, summer parties. Its one of the first bowls to be emptied and the recipie is always asked for. I found the dish is more crisp if the carrots are finely chopped instead of grated. I also do not steam the edamame (rinse only) as I purchase the frozen packages.
