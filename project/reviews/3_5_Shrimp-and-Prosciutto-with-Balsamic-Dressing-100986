This is great! I made only the shrimp & prosciutto, skipping the beans, and put it on a bed of mesuclen with the Balsamic Dressing. I used a bag of frozen shrimp that I defrosted. VERY EASY! Great appetizer.

I made this recipe and next time I think I'll skip the salad and radiccho leaves, no one ate those! Otherwise, you can't loose with procchuto and shrimp

this was an excellent salad. I served with the turkey sausage lasagna and everyone asked for the recipes. Balsamic dressing was great.

I'm amazed nobody has rated this! The prosciutto wrapped shrimp were excellent! The chick pea/roasted pepper salad was very, very flavorful. I served this at a picnic with another salad, which actually stole the show, but this was quite elegant to display and a very pleasing combination of flavors! I will definately make again.
