Using naan bread with this was great! My mayonnaise wasn't great but the sandwiches were!! I may try the mayonnaise again to make sure I didn't do anything wrong.

Fantastic! this exceeded my expectations. I made homemade garlic naan bread and broiled the chicken. The mint mayo is a MUST. It was absolutely addictive. I haven't stopped thinkinag about it since I last made it. Thankfully I'm making this for dinner tomorrow!

Great tasting. I made it on a griddle pan which was a bad idea; the marinade sticks like glue.

I made this when it first appeared in Bon Appetit in 1994 - they served it with a Potato, Tomato, Cucumber Raita that overwhelmed the Indian mayo. I'm so glad I saw it again here and followed reviewers suggstions to substitute flatbread for the sourdough. I grilled it and slathered one half with the Indian mayo and the other half with mango chutney and stuck some cilantro sprigs in too. Thanks for the tips this is now a yummy treat.

We had guests coming over and to stretch the chicken a bit further we shredded it and used the pan drippings (primarily the yogurt marinade) to mix in with the chicken. It was awesome! I am not a huge fan of the sandwich concept but it was a tasty sandwich with the mayo (used yogurt instead of mayonaise). I did not care for the sourdough either. I just didn't have time to make my own naan.

YUM YUM YUM! This is delish. The mayo is outstanding...we licked the bowl clean three days later after using the condiment on everything...

A perfect summer meal. Used thai hot chili in the mayo to increase the heat.

The Indian mayo is the best part and will make that again. As for the sandwich: Sourdough with Tandoori didn't seem right; couldn't find Naan so I bought sundried tomato "flatout" wrap bread; brushed it with olive oil and grilled it in a pan. I added cucumber and dark leaf lettuce to the wrap (my husband said the cucumber made the sandwich nice & moist). With the wrap, I would double the mayo recipe for 6 people. The chicken was closer to curry than tandoori so I will look for another tandoori recipe. Don't let this stop you from making it; most seemed to rave about this recipe...

I've made this recipe about a few times now and it's always been superb!!! My fiance and I devour the dish! This is definitely a keeper! I love the fact that it's so easy to make. I will be making this more often for weekday meals too!

Wonderful chicken recipe! I used boneless thigh cutlets, so they stayed very moist on the grill. I also made the Indian baked rice recipe from this site. Yum!!

Wonderful sandwiches! I can't wait to make this again. My husband devoured it and my two year old happily ate the grilled chicken on its own. Try making the sandwiches with good Naan instead of sourdough if you can get some. Marinating the chicken overnight intensifies the flavor.

Do not miss this one! I marinated the chicken in the morning before work, threw chicken on barbie after work. Perfect! Easy, fast and delicious. Served with coleslaw of all things as I had it on hand but any salad with this is a great week night dinner. The mayo does make it and I used dried herbs. Definitely a keeper--bet I'll be making this 2x a month.

The mayo is excellent. For a quick meal, just rub the spices over the chicken (minus the yogurt) just before grilling. Spicier, easier, and even tastes better!

Excellent!! Instead of Sourdough bread, I found some Jalepeno/Cilantro wraps at the supermarket and made sandwich wraps (served cold). They were a huge hit! This is a keeper.

I made this for an event I catered and it was the hit of the party. I highly recommend.

I made this recipe for lunch for my girlfriends. Excellent.... it smells, look and tastes just delicious!!! I will add this to my favorites! The mayonnaise could be used with lamb, or pork and would give an interesting twist to grilled food. Mmmmmmm!

This was awesome from start to finish. The marinade smelled (and tasted!) great, the chicken turned out moist and flavourful and the mayo gave it a great kick! Made it for friends and they were practically drooling at the grill as they cooked. We used a med-low heat for a little longer cooking time so as to not char the chicken. Try it!

A great grilled sandwich. The mayonnaise is excellent on cold pork sandwiches as well.

This recipe rocked! I considered omitting the mayonnaise but made it after all, and I think it was the best part of the recipe. That stuff was really, really tasty.

Wonderful!

This has become a favorite, grilled outdoors in the summer and broiled indoors. Indoors it took longer than 5 minutes a side to cook the chicken in my broiler.
