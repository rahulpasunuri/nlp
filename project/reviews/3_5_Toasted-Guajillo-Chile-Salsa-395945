The flavor was great, but the chiles don't puree down enough. It leaves bits of unhydrated chile skin in your mouth. I set aside the seeds and then strained the puree and added the seeds after. Much better consistency.

Really delicious and easy I only used ~25% of the seeds and thought it had a nice heat but not overwhelming. Have made it twice since printed last month
