Great dough. I have used this for years for pecan pie. The result is decadently rich. Depending on the oven, butter, and level of the filling, the dough has a tendency to roll inward and you sometimes lose your pretty fluting.

Excellent pastry recipe. The flavor was buttery and it had a very nice flaky texture. The technique was what intrigued me. Grating the frozen butter sticks was a brilliant idea. The little butter "chips" stayed separate and contributed to the flakiness. Plus I found it very easy to roll out, even straight out of the fridge. I'm going to try this recipe the next time I make a regular fruit pie.
