We liked this soup, but found it a bit salty. Next time we will decrease tomato & cheese and increase chestnuts and kale. Very satisfying and filling though.

A great combination of flavors. I followed the recipe to the letter except for 2 small things. I did not for pureeing part of the soup, as it was sufficiently thick. Also had fresh chestnuts, which I peeled and added to the soup about 15 minutes earlier than recommended.

Best soup ever. It feels so healthy and is so tasty. Perfect for the cooler days of autumn.

I used canned beans and omitted the water but did cook the liquids for 45 min. Worked well. Kept well for two days as leftovers too.

Not too bad! I subbed sausage for pancetta and threw in a can of chestnut puree instead of fussing with fresh ones (that's why I was drawn to the recipe, really; had to use up that can). Since that made the broth taste richer, I didn't puree.

This was great! Used fresh chestnuts which I roasted myself, and subbed canned beans for the dry (and cut out all the pre- soaking/cooking accordingly).

I love kale

I liked this soup -- the sweetness of the chestnuts is a nice contrast to the kale and the salty pancetta. But between the pancetta, the broth, the canned tomatoes, and the parmegiano rind, the soup was too salty. Next time I would use unsalted tomatoes and do whatever else I could to reduce the salt.

Loved the kale in this soup. I'm not crazy about beans in soup but my husband & I both enjoyed this soup. It easy & inexpensive to make, two pluses in my book. Not a lot of ingredients so go with the good stuff and get real pancetta and parmesean rind. Fyi, I found chestnuts in a bag that were much cheaper than the bottled. We're talking $1.19 vs. $11. Makes it worth the trouble to find them if you can!

Absolutely soul-satisfying on a mid-winter's eve! To save time, I used canned navy beans. All I had onhand was turkey bacon. Both worked perfectly well. I had some chicken cutlets that I cut up and added as well. Delicious all the way around!
