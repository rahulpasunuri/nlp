Just checked my recipe file and this recipe calls for 2 sticks of unsalted butter.

I want to make these for Christmas but I don't see butter listed in the ingredients. How much butter? Can someone help? thanks!

Four forks for taste, zero forks for preparation. Averages out to a 2. When the dough was chilled enough to work with, I rolled it out into the prescribed 8x12 rectangle and tried to add the filling, which was at room temperature. Oops. The cold dough immediately solidified the filling into a brittle sheet that wouldn't roll without cracking into messy little pieces. Ugh. They did taste pretty great, but they were a pita to make, and they weren't very pretty in the end.

These are easy, yummy and interesting to look at. The dough lasts for a long time in the freezer too, so you can make extra and freeze a roll to bake another time.

These were delicious and a pretty addition to my holiday cookie tray. I chilled the dough before rolling and then did half the way the recipe directed and rolled the other half on a floured board. Rolling them with flour was easier, worked better and gave the cookies a more finished look.

These cookies were quite tasty and look pretty displayed on cookie platter. When rolling up the dough, I did have slight trouble with it sticking to the wax paper, even though I chilled it (and checked it in 5-minute increments)--it was finally OK after about 20 minutes (what do you expect in Southern Calif!!!)--then it still was a little sticky, but more managable. After chilling the rolls, I cut only 12 slices 1/8" thick and baked them, since so many reviews said this was too thin. I agree. The next day, I cut the rest of the roll in 1/4" slices and baked for 12-14 minutes. They were perfect that way!!! And they stayed together very nicely. What I really like about this cookie (besides great taste) is that you can prepare the dough ahead and freeze it so it's ready whenever you have time to bake-- just take roll out of freezer and slice. Also, you can bake just the amount you want instead of making an entire batch. I found this very handy for portion control (especially at the time of year when we tend to overindulge)!

Although the end result is delicious, this is way too much work. My dough stuck so much, I lost a lot of it to the wax paper. And when I rolled it up, it was quite a struggle (because of the sticking). When I took the cookies out of the oven, they looked beautiful, but I foolishly did not remove them immediately from the rack. Nearly all of them fell apart. I could have cried. Better luck to you!

What a mess!!! This dough is so sticky, and no matter how much i chilled it, I couldn't work with it. Trying to roll the logs was almost impossible due to the sticky dough and the filling which got cold when meeting the dough and kept breaking. I couldn't get neat looking pinwheels at all. Instead, these looked more like standard drop cookies with swirls of peanut butter/chocolate running through them, which still tasted good, but didn't look as nice as I'd hoped. For the same results, instead of spending so much time trying to make pinwheels, i think i would just swirl the "filling" in a bowl full of dough, and make drop cookies.

I found these pinwheels very easy to make, the dough was good to handle and the taste was incredible. I wouldn't change a thing (By the way, I did use the microwave to melt the chocolate and it was fine.)

Definitely much better with 1/4 inch slices. The only issue I had was getting these fragile cookies off my baking sheets without breaking them.

These were really cute cookies! Very rich. They're great to give out--you really notice them on a cookie platter, and are popular flavors. I had no problems with rolling the dough straight away when I made these over the winter (old northern New England kitchens might actually BE compared to igloos--see the previous review), but I agree that unless it's quite cool in your kitchen that you'll need to chill the dough. These cookies are really easy to slice. The filling stays gets very firm when the rolls are chilled so the slices retain their shape beautifully. I actually liked these sliced thin so that the cookies came out cripsy and delicate--thickly sliced they are a bit too rich for me--but I can see how a lot of people would prefer the cookies sliced thicker.

Chilling the dough is an absolute must unless you live in an igloo. I made the dough first and refrigerated it, then made the filling. Next I rolled the dough out and froze it while the filling cooled. This made spreading the filling and rolling the dough a breeze. The thicker slices other readers recommended were essential as well. Deeelicious!

I have made this recipe for several years now primarily because it yields an attractive, good cookie that looks very nice on Holiday Cookie plates. The dough is a bit of a pain to work with though, because it is so soft. Here's what works for me: chill the dough first for 10 minutes or so, then roll it out between two sheets of floured wax paper that are on a large cookie sheet. Once the dough is rolled into the rectangle, spread with the peanut butter filling, then move the whole thing into the frig. again to chill for another 10 minutes before you try to roll it up. The chilled dough should come right off the floured wax paper. Freeze the rolls and slice when frozen.

I am a quite the novice in the kitchen so I was apprehensive about making these cookies. However, it wasn't the disaster I was expecting. (I found that if you didn't roll out the dough too thinly it was easier to roll into a log). I cut them 1/4 inch as so many people suggested and they turned out wonderful (taste and appearance wise). However, they are delicate, so handle with care once out of the oven.

These cookies are delicious! The only thing I would do different is cut them thicker.

Lovely cookies - turned out perfectly. I did slice thicker 1/4" and had no trouble rolling up. Increased amount of peanut butter for more flavour. Was asked for the recipe and will surely make again.

I give this recipe 2 forks because the flavor was wonderful. But it was really a disaster for me to make. The dough was really sticky, so I put it in the fridge for a while, so I could roll it out. I put the warm chocolate on top, but it was too soft to roll. I chilled it some more, but hten the chocolate was too stiff. :( I was going to just dump it until I tasted the dough with the chocolate. YUM! So I squished it together and was able to cook it, but it didn't look very pretty. Maybe more flour would make the dough easier to handle?

I made this cookie for my fellow employs. It went over very well. It went over so well one of the gentelmen there asked for the recipe. Of course I am taking a copy to work for him. We all enjoyed this recipe very much. Thank you

They were a little difficult to roll up with the chocolate spread on the dough. Even though they weren't very pretty before they were cooked they turned out beautiful and very tasty. I will probably make them again using Nutella as the filling instead as I love Nutella!

The taste of the cookie was great, but I had a hard time with them falling apart. I am going to try again, this time cutting them thicker.

These cookies grew on my family. We were expecting something more peanut-buttery, but found the chocolate really overpowered the peanut taste. The end result, though, was a delicious, light and crispy cookie. I didn't have any trouble with them crumbling apart, except when I gave them away in a Ziploc bag (which I assume would be a problem for ANY cookie, not just these). The new "disposable" Ziploc/Gladware containers work really nicely for these, however (and they're a lot cheaper than cookie tins!).

I liked this, but it wasn't too popular with my guests. I think cutting the cookies thicker (maybe 1/4 inch) helps the recipes.

This is an excellent cookie. It is easy to make and the texture is tender but holds together nicely.
