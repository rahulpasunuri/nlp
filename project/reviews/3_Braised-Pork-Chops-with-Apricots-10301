made this last night. delicious. of course, i swapped the shallots for onion, because thats what i had at home. didn't have any dried apricots, so i used dried cherries -- would have been better if i had used the apricots but the cherries were fine. but braising the pork chops made them incredibly tender and juicy and they were soooo tasty. would definitely make again!

This dish turned out great...full of flavor and the meat was juicy. The sauce was sweet from the apricots and earthy from the cumin...delicious! I doubled the recipe to use 4 chops and 1 cup of shallots sure seemed like a lot! It didn't taste bad, in fact it gave the sauce texture. I would make this dish again for a special occasion but not for a regular week night meal, it wasn't hard, but definitely not a quickie.

Loved it, the sauce is to die for. I made quite a few substitutions with what I had on hand - used prunes instead of apricots, onion instead of shallot, oil instead of butter, and lemon instead of orange zest, and all broth instead of wine. With all the changes, it was still wonderful. Nice and flavorful sauce. Yum.

I made this recipe without the apricots and with ground ginger. The sauce was exceptional and the pork chops were moist and tender. Yum!

From all the good reviews i was expecting great things, but i thought this was one of the worst pork dishes i have ever tried, maybe i should have cooked it 2 hours or tripled the seasoning it sure neededsomething

I've been making this recipe for years- it was an instant hit with my wife and me from the first time I made it. I often use arrowroot to thicken because it lowers the fat and I like how it makes the sauce more like a glaze than a gravy. The pork doesn't dry out if you truly braise it, but there's no reason why someone who likes a juicy, medium pork chop couldn't use that with the same sauce.

With that cooking time, the pork chops will come out like roof shingles. It's just ridiculous how many people still believe that you have to cook pork to death. I like my pork medium. People always are amazed at how "moist" my pork is..well, duh! I don't overcook it. Mixx restaurant in San Diego was the first place I'd been to that had a clue. They serve their pork medium. If it were a heatlh hazard, they couldn't do it. Get a clue, people!

This was an easy mid-week meal to prepare. Served it with roasted garlic couscous and a green salad. Definitely would make it again.

Interesting. This was pretty good for dinner with couscous and minted peas, and much better as leftovers. I would increase the gingerroot next time.

This is an awful lot like a recipe in the out-of-print-but-excellent International Horizon Cookbook based on a Roman recipe. I had a dish very similar to this at a Roman restaurant in Trier, Germany and the combination of apricots with cumin is heavenly. Made me start cooking with fruit. If you can ever find the International Horizon Cookbook, buy it!

Good Recipe! Made it for family and guests and raves all the way around. Did not have enough apricots so used dried figs along with the dried apricots...very good.

My fiancee really likes this one. I generally don't have all of the spices that the recipe calls for and really don't miss it.

Made this the very first time for guests. Every one liked it and it made me look talented.
