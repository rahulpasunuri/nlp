Very good and added an interesting twist to traditional tartar sauce.

This sauce was a colorful contrast to fresh salmon, which we cooked in a smoker. Great flavor!

A perfect complement to the Broiled Crab Cakes -- made this twice, and at my last gathering (yesterday) got lots of compliments not only for the crab cakes themselves, but for the sauce. (Even my mayo-loathing aunt and sister in law loved the sauce!)

The four stars are for the chive caper sauce which I have used several times at my Christmas Eve party (the first time was with the crab cakes which were so-so). Last year I just used the sauce on baguette toasts with slices of smoked salmon and topped with dill sprigs..yum!!

I thought this sauce was just so-so, though my guests did enjoy it. Just a fancier tartar sauce than most. There are better sauce recipes out there.

I left out the parsley (didn't have any on hand) and added 3 chopped hot peppers and tabasco sauce. I also mixed this by hand and minced 1/2 the capers. I loved it with the crab cakes, and so did Bubbles. Will make this again~

A wonderful presentation!

I tried broiling them and they looked a little pale so I pan fried them and everyone at the party raved! I have handed this same receipe out to three people now who have all loved the results too.

This was really good. Added 1/4 cup sour cream. I did not use a food processor--just mixed everything in a bowl, including capers, which were minced first. Divine with Crab Cakes (Gourmet August 1993).

Wonderful! Try it with the Cayenne-Spiked Crabcakes featured in the September, 2000 issue of Bon Appetit! You won't be disappointed.
