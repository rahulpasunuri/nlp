I give the potatoes 4 forks & the scramble 3 forks. The cumin totally dominated the taste og the scramble. Next time I will use half to a quarter as much cumin. The sweet potatoes really made the potato dish special. I didn't have Yukon golds so I used new potatoes that I had on hand and just cut them in half.
