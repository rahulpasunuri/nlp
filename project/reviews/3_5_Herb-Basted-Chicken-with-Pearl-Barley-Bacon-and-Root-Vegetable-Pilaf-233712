Didn't have much success with this one. Sounded great, came out gloppy and flavorless. I love barley and veggies but not this recipe. Sorry.

Delicious! Great winter dinner. Leftovers were gone in no time.

This was great. We all loved it, including my mother who thinks she doesn't like barley, and my husband who doesn't usually like vegetables. Will definitely be making it again.

I found this totally blah. I love barley but this needed many more kicks. I used parsnips, squash, carrots and turnips. The vegetables were fine as choices, but even with increasing the herbs, we found this to be boring.

Fabulous. I used a whole, cut-up chicken instead of just breasts. I cooked the barley in my rice cooker, using a 3 to 1 ratio of broth to barley. It came out perfectly. My veggies of choice were rutabagas and turnips. The chicken did take 40 minutes (not 20) in the oven, and it came out unbelievably moist. After the bacon was cooked and removed, and the shallots went in, I deglazed with a little chicken stock. It released so many yummy bits. Next time, I will use more fresh herbs than called for. And there will be a next time.

I love this recipe and I've made it a few times. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe and stirred in the bacon. BIG MISTAKE! It is much better if you leave the crispy bacon out until you serve it, and then sprinkle it on top. Otherwise, the bacon gets all soft and slimy - I like mine crispy. I also use chicken thighs instead of breasts.

Excellent recipe. Really liked the pearl barley pilaf. I used chicken thighs instead of breasts and also added some Italian parsley. I will be making it again.

Delicious-a great winter dish! I used chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts, as I find the more moist and flavorful. Since chicken thighs have more fat, either cut the fat away or be sure to drain the accumulated fat from the pan before adding the butter. I also browned the chicken in batches so they would get nice, crispy skin. After draining the chicken fat and melting the butter for the tarragon butter, I then added the chicken to the pan, turning each piece over in the pan to get a nice butter coat. I used butternut squah and turnip in the barley pilaf. I added a little chicken stock towards the end of cooking the vegetables, and they came out nicely. To prevent the barley from drying out I believe it is essential to check it after 20 minutes. I wound up cooking it for 25 minutes-by this time the barley was tender, and the water was mostly absorbed. I let it sit for another five minutes for the water to absorb fully. Nice, flavorfull dish for a winter dinner.

I'll add my praises to this recipe. Very moist chicken and I loved the barley. I made it with chicken stock instead of water, deglazed the bacon pan with white wine and added some lemon slices to the roasting chicken as others have suggested. I used beets and carrots for my veg and it tasted great (although the beets turned the barley red, hmmm.)

exquisite dish, so easy to make. I replaced bacon with some chicken ham and other times with beef salami, and it turned out very well. Unsure how it would compare to the original recipe, but for one who does not eat pork, this substitute would do fine.

This recipe was fabulous! Use the best bacon you can find--the pilaf was divine, chicken breasts were the most juicy and flavorful ever. Pretty enough for dinner party-- garnish with an herb sprig. Definitely a keeper!

This was a great recipe! The chicken was delicious! I added some slices of lemon to the pan as well before putting it in the oven and it provided just the right amount of lemon flavor to go with the barley. Also, I added a splash of white wine after satueeing the shallots to deglaze and get some extra bacon flavor. It was fantastic! Would definitely make this dish again!

I have made this recipe twice and really like it a lot. It is really easy and very flavorful. The barley side dish was a little dry the first time I made this so I added canned chicken broth and butter which perked it right up. The next time I cooked the barley in broth instead of water. It is really good.
