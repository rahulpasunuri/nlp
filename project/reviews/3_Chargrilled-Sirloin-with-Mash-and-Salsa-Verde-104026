I have baked easy, no hassle recipes my whole life and was up for a challange. I found this recipe and spent the afternoon in the kitchen making the meal. My family loved it and I would definalty make it again.

Sometimes a recipe can be good for someone else but I can't make it right. I think that is the case here. I made the salsa verde using two thick slices of homemade bread and I carefully squeezed the milk out. and I used the remaining ingredients as listed. However I think I got a lot more lemon juice from my lemons than the recipe calls for. I wish they had listed volume instead of number of lemons. It turned out very very soupy even after adding more bread and very lemony and did not go well with the dish. Fortunately I bought top choice sirloins and had homemade demi-glaze so the dish turned out great without the salsa. I hope other people have better luck.
