I didn't read the reviews before making this and, yes,it's bland as is. I did decrease the water by 2 cups and made it in the crock pot. At days end I tasted it and it wasn't what I'd hoped. So I added salt (a KEY ingredient as far as I'm concerned) and a chopped red bell paper, as well as chili powder, cumin, and powdered coriander. Much better! I might make it again with my modifications.

I took some advice from the other reviews and added some extra flavors to prevent producing a bland soup. I used half a cup less water, added an extra clove of garlic, green onion, cumin, and cayenne pepper. Then I topped off each finished serving with a bit of sour cream. Yum!

I doctored this recipe in keeping with others' suggestions and quite enjoyed it. Considering that I used a whole white onion, one jalapeno, hot italian sausage and bunches of red pepper flakes, I think this soup is very good with a spicy kick.

Wonderful soup! Since so many reviewers found the soup bland, I ended up adding a jalapeno pepper and using a regular cooking onion instead of the scallions. I also added a teaspoon of ground cumin. I used chorizo saussages, a box of chicken stock and half a can of tomato paste, canned black beans and not as much water. I would definitely make again! I am only rating as three forks, since I modified the recipe so much from the original.

I made a few changes to this recipe based on the other reviews--I started by sauteeing onion & green pepper, then adding the garlic. Then I added canned black beans and the broth & two cups of water. I also added 1 tsp. cumin and 1 tsp. chili powder. It was a great substitute for chili for a family that can't eat tomatoes.

I didn't care for the worcestershire in this. The flavor overall was a bit bland and I am not sure what I'd add instead of worcestershire to perk it up. Cajun/creole seasoning as suggested by another reviewer sounds like it'd a good match -- maybe I'll try that if I make this again. I did enjoy the combo of sweet potato, black beans, and sausage. It seems like a good idea but I'd have to play with it to make it more to my liking. My three kids liked it and cleaned their bowls -- served with buttermilk cornbread which was a nice complement.

i skipped the sausage and pureed it all when it was done - I really liked it - simple - hearty - healthy - and yummy

This turned out really well, but only after making some changes--I, like others, found it a little bland. I baked the potatoes and then mashed them to make the soup thicker. I then added some balsamic vinegar and some seasoned rice vinegar to add a little edge. I think I could probably have used more Worcestershire instead, but I always turn to the vinegars when in doubt! I also browned the sausage before adding to the soup. One inadvertent change I made was in the beans: my store was out of dried beans, so I used 2 cans instead, and only 4 cups of broth, no water. It turned out really well, though, and I would absolutely make it again!

This was really good, although I needed more time to get the beans tender enough. I also left out the scallions because I didn't have any, and the soup needed them. It's a great use of sweet potatoes when you're sick of them baked and mashed!

This is one of our winter staples. We use turkey sausage to make it a little healthier. So hearty and good for you. Yum!

This turned out pretty tasty even though I was short some of the ingredients-- I used andouille sausage (a little less than called for), one can beef broth instead of two cups of chicken broth, added extra garlic to make up for the flavor as much as I could, and a dash of Tabasco. The sweetness of the potatoes was nice against the heat.

I've made several recipes from Epicurious and this by far was the most mediocre. While I love each of the three main ingredients, and I'm pretty sure they would blend well for a soup, this recipe was not it. I found it bland and had to add more and different spices than called for. I still didnt like the consistency. This recipe is just not a good starting point. There must be something close (black beans and sausage)thats far superior.

Came out very well -- I used chorizo (double the amount called for) and added a habanero pepper.

A great fireside meal. I prefer a bit more garlic than listed but his is a great winter stew
