I followed the advice of some reviewers and added 2 cloves of garlic and deglazed with red wine. It's OK. It's flavourful but maybe I'm not the onion soup type. I was stuck with a few ingredients and that's what I could make. But I don't think I'll go out of my way to make this again.

This is an excellent soup -- but I think without the suggestions of the group (and the modifications I made based on their advice), this wouldn't have been as good. I added about 4 cloves of coarsely chopped garlic to the onion saute, I deglazed the pot with a strong red wine (about 1/2 cup) before adding the broth and then after pureeing the soup, I strained it through a fine seive to make it more like a consomme. I tasted the before and after strain and the after was definitely better. I also made a batch of croutons w/grated parmesean and it was wonderful.

Fantastic, easy, cold weather satisfying. Added red wine too, after the flour, to get the brown bits off the bottom of the pot. And a little dijon mustard at the end.

Garlic Garlic Garlic! Sweating a couple of crushed cloves as the browning process is really underway adds a lovely flavor. Also, plenty of fresh black pepper. Perfect to make when you need a good cry!

Delicious and so simple. I did add a splash of red wine (after the flour and before the broth) and used a nice beef broth ("Kitchen Basics"). To complete, I made croutons, topped with grated Parmesean and then put under broiler for a moment.

In answer to a prior review -- what this soup needs for added flavor is a cup and a half of red wine subsituted for some of the broth. The wine blends perfectly with the onions for a very rich flavor.

Very good onion soup. I added a round of toasted french bread and grated parmesan cheese. Very easy to make.

Made this soup tonight and it was very good, but it needs something...Maybe some baguette toasts rubbed with garlic or topped with grated parmesan?? Will try again. My husband loved it as a starter for his first Father's day dinner!
