Just made this last night and IT IS GOOD! I would agree that a little more bacon couldn't hurt (even doubling as another reviewer said), but it is delish! Will be serving it before dinner tonight with veggies and crackers and I know it will be a hit. Definitely a keeper!

made as directed, except i didn't have any hot sauce so i used a dash of worcestershire and some cayenne pepper. very nice and tangy from the blue cheese and horseradish. served with tortilla chips at a party and it was a hit!

Delicious! I can't imagine why the naysayer would make a dip with bleu if they don't like it....

I made this for a tailgate party and I didn't think it was that great. I won't make it again. I didn't think bacon and cheese could ever be a bad combo. :(

Another winner! We doubled the bacon though.

It was good, but talk about big flavors. I thought this dip was too overpowering for wheat thins and apples. Next time, I'll make it with hot wings or drumettes. And it's probably not the best choice for folks that don't LOVE blue cheese.
