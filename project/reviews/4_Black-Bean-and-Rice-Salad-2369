Amazing. roasted jarred peppers, wine vinegar only subs i made. Soaked the red onions in cold water to lessen intensity. Served in baked tortilla bowls. Used sofrito as a topping. If u didn't like this recipe u made it wrong, sorry.

I have been making this salad since the recipe was published 20 years ago. I usually double the amount of the dressing - adding half first, and then more to taste.

Excellent recipe.... I've been making this recipe exactly as is for 5 years and it's still a keeper. Great with grilled pork loin or chicken. Even great the next day! If you are making adjustments - you might want to try a different recipe. Penzey's spices also has a great black bean and rice salad. Mybuddytank.

Very blah. I should have paid attention to the other reviewers and made some additions.

I LOVE this recipe but do make some changes as per others recommendations. I use lime juice instead of OJ and scallions instead of red onions for a bit less bite. I only add about 3/4 cup rice. People gobble it up.

I have been making a salad similar to this for years. I liked the OJ for the dressing. I added some fresh corn, 6 hard boiled eggs and jalapeno, for added zip, as well as 1 lb. Chorizo (removed casing and sauteed). I increased the chili powder to two tbsp and used toasted cumin seeds instead of the powder. Very good.

A great fresh summer salad or a way to lighten up a Latin inspired meal.

Needed to pull a quick menu together for my wife who offered to host our neighborhood Bunko group and had less than 24 hours to do so. Found this recipe that and gave it a try. It was a big hit with the ladies that night. Went very well with my tequila chicken sandwiches.

Rating: 3
I thought this was pretty good, but the raw onion was too strong. Next time, I will either sautee the onion first, or else use green onions.

This is the best black bean and rice salad I have ever made. Took Epi reviewers' advice, and made some changes (lime juice instead of orange juice, and greens onions, although I am sure red would be delicious, too). Enjoy!

I've made this recipe a number of times and gotten rave reviews each time. It makes a LOT so I always do a full batch. Great with chicken or beef thrown in as well.

Great dish with a few modifications. I use red, orange or yellow bell peppers instead of green (I think the cilantro adds enough green to the dish). I also add 1 tsp hot red pepper and use lime or lemon juice instead of the orange juice. If you rinse the rice first it does not stick at all, although cooking it as written works for me as well. This recipe does taste better the next day, so I always make it the night before.

this is a solid dish for anything from dinner to barbeque. i cut down on the rice and bell peppers

Rating: 4
Excellent! I needed something to pair with a tequila lime turkey breast and this worked perfectly. In fact, in upstaged the turkey! Both my husband and I were going back for "just one more bite" well after dinner was over. I made a few modifications only out of necessity as I did not have some of the ingredients on hand. I used lime juice instead of orange juice, used peanut oil instead of olive, did not include the red onion, and used jarred roasted red peppers (which I would recommend). Delicious and very well-received!

Rating: 4
This is amazing! I have made it a few times since first trying it a month ago - all I have to say is I use a lot of "salt to taste", otherwise, I follow it just as it is written. It's definitely worth a try - very easy, too!

I have been making this salad since it was published in Bon Appetit in 1991 and have always gotten rave reviews! I usually add cayenne (enough to give it a real kick), and serve it in a large bowl rather than on lettuce leaves, as it DOES make quite a large quantity.

What a disappointment. After reading the reviews I was expecting something with more pizazz. It looked pretty, but was quite bland and flavorless. I'll never bother with this again.

Rating: 4
This is an excellent side dish and would be great for a potluck. I made it with jerk chicken and a tropical fruit salad and it was perfect. However, be warned - this makes a huge amount. If you are just making it for your family, you should probably halve the recipe.

This is an excellent recipe. The flavors are wonderful and it can be served room temperature or chilled. I had numerous compliments on it and the leftovers are even better.

Rating: 4
great recipe, and easy to make changes! i sauteed some chopped onions and garlic before adding the chicken broth to cook the rice, which added savouriness to the brown rice i used. i followed other reviewers' suggestions, and added corn, more vinegar, and for the peppers, i had one of each: orange, green, and red. i made it a day ahead, and i think it tasted even better! great for a picnic or potluck!

Duck confit is a four star recipe. This is a 3.25. I made this dish twice in the last two weeks, by using very different techniques. The first time, I made the recipe as written, except that I added corn and I traded a jalapeno for the green bell pepper. I also used lime juice instead of orange. I brought the resulting dish to a picnic and it was heartily received, with people covetously scooping up the last bits in the serving bowl. The second time I made this for someone on a sodium restricted diet. I soaked dry beans and used herbox sodium free chicken boullion granules. The resulting dish was no less delicious than the previous attempt, and it also was met with rave reviews. Will definitely make this again. A great, portable summer side.

Delicious, followed recipe completely. Will add corn and shredded chicken to the leftovers tonight! My three year old liked this (with the onions picked out) with cheddar cheese sprinkled on top. Will make again, this is a very pretty and colorful salad for a buffet.

Yummy. I made this using leftover jasmine rice and lemon juice instead of orange juice. No onion only because I dont like raw onion. Its even better the next day.

My thanks to all the reviewers and Epicurious for this site and the ability to have confidence that a four fork recipe will be worth making! This salad is delicious. I didn't vary from the ingredients, except to half it; it will be great as a side or for a vegetarian lunch. I've tried a lot of black bean and rice salads; this will be a favorite. It's easy to make and the dressing is very tasty.

Delicious. I made this last night for a party I am having tonight. It is so good I brought it into work to have people try it and got rave reviews. So easy too!!

Rating: 4
Oooh, this is good. I added olive oil to the rice after it was done cooking to try and keep it from sticking. It did an ok job, but I still had some clumps. There is an old issue of Cook's Illustrated devoted to rice salads that explained the best method of cooking rice specifically for a rice salad, but I've since forgotten. This is very easy, very fresh-tasting and a snap to prepare. I forgot the orange juice and it was still very good (just needed a bit more vinegar). My husband practically licked the bowl clean and begged me to make it again very soon - and wants me to make wraps with the filling, which I think would be especially good with slices of grilled or roasted pork loin.

Rating: 3
This was a delicious salad and healthy too. I also used green onions instead of red but followed the rest of the recipe to the letter. I think I will serve it to my vegan friends next time as a main course. My rice wasn't sticky at all as one review reported. It was perfect and fluffy.

This salad sounded very weird to me on first glance but I was looking for something to go with my jerk chicken and my goal this summer is to try some new side dish recipes (tired of ma and pa mac and potato salads) I read the reviews and trusted my fellow epicureans and tried it. So it was pretty good and went very well with the grilled jerk chicken and a spinach orange salad. I tried to follow the recipe exactly but I did a few substitutions based on instinct- white instead of red vinegar, and green onions instead of red onions, less chile and less cumin. Next time I'll leave out the green pepper- red pepper was fine and there was plenty of green with cilantro in the mix. I'd also like to make the rice less sticky next time. Any suggestions?

This is a fabulous salad with a few substitutions. I used 3 cups medium grain Goya rice, this rice has much better flavor. I used a yellow pepper, an orange pepper and a jar of roasted red peppers which gave it a great color and flavor. I don't care for green pepper. I subbed cider vinegar for the red wine vinegar, added lime juice and one cup of thawed corn. Next time I will increase the vinegar for more tang. I found the 1/2 cup of oil to be just enough, I wouldn't cut it down. I think 3 cups of dry rice is more than the suggested one pound package of rice. I made it the day before and served at room temp. Everyone loved it! This is definitely going to become a regular recipe in my family.

This exemplifies what I love about Epicurious recipes. For me, recipes are more of a travel guide than a road map - they provide a general direction then let me create my own adventure. Thanks to all of the other's suggestions, I really enjoyed this. I used a mixed rice medley and roasted red peppers, sub'd lime juice for oj, used orange muscat champagne vinegar, halved the oil and spices and added roasted corn. My guests loved it.

This was a good companion salad--tasty, held up well to preparation a day ahead, a good accompaniment to a rather vibrant and showy entree.

Liked it - didn't love it. Would make it again but probably substitute orzo for the rice. Would probably also skip the green peppers. Use lots of cilantro and let the flavors blend for a couple of hours before serving. Nice light dish with lots of flavor.

great recipe! I reduced the recipe to 3 servings, substituted lime juice for 1/2 of the lemon juice, used dried cilantro instead of fresh and used about a teaspoon of oil. I could eat this every day!

Good base to start from, but I made some changes... only used 1 C dry rice and added fresh corn (one ear) and tomatoes; halved the oil; and substituted lime juice for the orange juice. I have been eating it all week for lunch and it's fabulous, not to mention guilt-free.

Rating: 3
A great summer dish! I made this with orzo, substituted orange segments for orange juice and fresh lime juice for vinegar. I also added seeded and finely chopped fresh hot peppers. Good rolled up in flour tortillas that have been heated directly on a gas stove burner, flipping until warm and just starting to brown.

Made double this recipe for a block party and it was really good. I can't wait to make it again and try adding the corn and/or three different color peppers. I think the cumin is a must as it adds to the Mexican accent of this dish, which I think sets it apart.

I have had this recipe in my collection for ten years and have used it frequently. I always am asked for the recipe when i bring it to a pot luck. I was traveling and didn't have the recipe with me and was delighted to find it on Epicurious. Love the recipe-love the convienence of Epicurious.

Tastes very good, cooking the rice in the broth is a must. I used less oil and had no cumin, it still was a hit.

Superb! Cool and healthy -- the perfect dish to make during a heat wave. I might use a little less onion and olive oil next time.

Rating: 4
This is one of my all-time favorite recipes. I have never made it that it didn't get rave reviews. I personally prefer it at room temperature and have even warmed it in the microwave. I've also made it lower fat by cutting the olive oil in half and adding more orange juice, which doesn't hurt it too much. Of course, it's better just as is!

Rating: 4
WOW. I used balsamic and white vinegars, brown rice, chopped tomato, decreased the chopped onion a bit, added chopped cashews, raisins and sesame seeds. (The sesame interferes- I won't do again that way, but it was good) It's fantastic the next day and after. This will be made again and again in my house!

This is a great salad for buffets and potlucks. I substitute brown rice which adds a nicer texture and, I think, a better flavor. There are NEVER any leftovers when I make it!

I made it for a potluck, and it was very good. I followed the other recommendations and cut the oil to 1/4 cup. I also substituted white wine vinegar for the red, and cut back the cumin to 1 t. I didn't add a green pepper, but substituted a small pkg. of fresh frozen corn and it worked beautifully. The next morning, it was slightly dry, so I added about 3-4 T. more O.J. Next time I would use a little less red onion.

This is both easy to prepare and delicious! We reduced the oil to 1/4 cup, and it tastes great. We'll definitely make it again, maybe next time with corn (as other folks have recommended)

This salad was very good. The only caution I have would be to use a light olive oil and a little less than a half cup. I used extra virgin olive oil and the flavor was a little overpowering.

We tried this recipe several years and now it's a family favorite, our daughter just requested it as her birthday dinner. We add grilled chicken breasts (slice in strips after grilling) and it's a delicious dinner.

The only change I made was to use 3 tablespoons of white wine vinegar instead of the 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar. I made the salad the night before, and it was beautiful the next day. Rinsing and draining the black beans is the key.

I agree, adding corn works well. With salsa and a little cheese, this salad makes great burrito innards too.

This was a wonderful buffet salad. I've made it several times, once with the rice as directed and once I substituted the rice for orzo (2 cups). It was just as delicious. When I boiled the pasta (orzo) I added some instant chicken boullion crystals to the water for added flavor. I also included some thawed frozen corn to give the dish more color. Everyone enjoyed it.

This dish received rave reviews. It makes enough for a potluck or party and is easy to prepare the day before. I used brown rice also and added some minced fresh jalapeno and jalapeno juice to give it a little fire.

This is an absolute keeper! I made it for a hawaii theme party and it was a hit. I did use 3 different colored peppers so it looked festive and sort of like confetti. Try it - you won't be disappointed.

Deeeelicious! Best Mexican rice salad I've tried. Definitely a keeper! However, I made half the recipe and that's plenty... I adjusted the flavoring to suit my taste preferences - reduced the olive oil to 1/4 cup, 2 tsp. chili powder, 1 tsp. cumin, and used the juice of one whole orange (really enhances the cilantro). I didn't have any corn, but I'll add that next time. Enjoy!

I made half of the recipe but used an orange colored bell pepper instead of the green pepper. I also added a small can of corn. The results were excellent and when I asked my dinner guests to rate this receipe they all awarded it with four forks on a four star scale. My main course consisted of Black Bean and Rice Salad, Marmalade-Glazed Spareribs and Cornmeal Muffins.
