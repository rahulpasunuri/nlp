Easy dessert when you need don't have a ton of time to cook! Made with Tillamook Oregon strawberry ice cream...tasty! I added Oreo cookies to the chocolate wafer crust and it was delicious and made the crust a little thicker- for more crunch.

Dear Complainers: We all had to start somewhere. If this easy recipe inspires someone who normally buys from the store to get into the kitchen and create something (albeit from purchased items), I'm all for it. Perhaps the next time they will have the confidence to try something a little more challenging. Who knows where it may lead? :) This would also be great to make with a young child to get them interested in cooking, too.

This is light and refreshing. Living on the Arizona desert, even with AC, I use my oven sparingly. This was simple and delicious. 110 degree heat really does zap your energy, so easy is good. Easy and delicious is wonderful.

This is good! I'd never have come up with it myself. Are the health claims for the pie, the strawberries, vitamin C, or for all of those? All of them, but especially the pie, I hope. I would LOVE for my quest for slimming, skin-firming pie to finally be over.

I had unexpected company and all the ingredients on hand. My ice-cream was homemade (coincidence) and I had just purchased organic strawberries. This was a fast and delicious dessert. I liked the speed and easy of prep. Some assembly may be required? So what, it was great.

I have not used this recipe, but I have read all the reviews. The complaints only cncurage me to believe this is a great recipe. No one complains about the taste, smell or looks of the product; only its ease in assembly. Sounds like a winner to me.

I understand the need for something simple for when it is steamy outside but this does seem to say "I have given up."

Sometimes the acronym-K.I.S.S., Keep It Simple Stupid really works. I cook one meal a month for a homeless teen shelter. This recipe is perfect for elevating something simple to something delightful for persons who are truly grateful for a meal. Lighten up haters!

I agree that this recipe is waaaay too simple to even be on epicurious, much less be featured. But, it's possible to make it more involved and gourmet. Why not make the ice cream and the chocolate cookies for the crust? Just for presentation's sake.

Store bought ice cream in a store bought crust with canned whipped cream....really?! I think this lame recipe can be found on pie crust's label. Why not just post how to make boxed mac and cheese while your at it. Is Sandra Lee now working here? I expected much more from Epicurious, especially for a featured recipe.

I think the name is misleading, if the only chocolate is the crust. I would add chocolate chunks or chips into the ice cream, and top with a few pieces as well. This recipe would also be great using other ingredients, flavors, fruits (but don't forget the chocolate!) : D

Sorry, but I agree with kongstuffer; this isn't even a recipe in my opinion. (My baker daughter agrees by the way.) Really, why bother? Just put some ice cream in a bowl and top with whipped cream and crushed cookies. I agree with Carolinagirl's suggestion as a "fix".

Seriously? I'm w/kongsuffer. Why not just eat ice cream? No waiting required :-)

Yes, kongstuffer, you're being too critical. This looks like an easy, tasty, refreshing summer dessert. Not every recipe needs to have a long list of ingredients and a lot of steps. It's not "recipe of the week"; it's just today's featured recipe.

Talk about scraping the bottom for a recipe Epicurious! This recipe is seriously weak!!! Am I just being too critical or does anybody else think this recipe does not merit a spot on the "recipe of the week"?

Extremely simple recipe especially for hot summer days. Just a suggestion: Soften ice cream just until it can be stirred. Fold extra coarsely chopped fresh strawberries into ice cream  a few blueberries and/or raspberries wouldnt hurt, either. Proceed with recipe. Put extra whatever berries you have mixed into the ice cream (Strawberries/Blueberries/Raspberries) and continue with theme to top pie. Following just the basics of this 'recipe', the varieties are endless.
