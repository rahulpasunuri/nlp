circular slices? what does the recipe mean by that?

This is a classic Southern recipe and , for Southerners, it's meant to be light, sweet and simple. If you change it, it is not Ambrosia

To the cook from San Jose - where on earth did you ever get the idea to add soy milk to ambrosia? True ambrosia consists of naval oranges, pineapple (canned or fresh) and coconut. A splash of Grand Marnier is fine too. BTW - have you ever been to CA?

My grandmom and mom made this every Christmas using just the oranges, pineapple and coconut. They took great care, just getting only the orange meat with absolutely no pith or any skin from in between the orange slices. Even though my adult children would rather have the version with cool whip and marshmallows, I insist on the original at Christmas time!!

I thought this was just ok; a bit boring to be much good. Birmingham: soy milk actually improved this quite a bit. I added 8th Continent in vanilla.

I think Midwesterners and Yankees like to gussy up with sour cream/yogurt. We in Dixie prefer the taste of the fresh fruit (and coconut but no marshmallows)and even Baptists are known to add a shot of Grand Marnier!

This is very so-so. Why bother? I mean where is the fiz and pizzaz? Ambrosia usually has some kind of light and creamy sauce, nectar and/ or sometimes a bit of effervescence. If its really good it has a subtle spice and tartness too. Try some light cream, yogurt, soy or rice milk, fruit juice, sparkling fruit cider, white vinegar, ginger or five spice or something like that. And, please, I mean really (??), flaked coconut and marshmellows is the wrong idea for fiving it that cetain "surprise." At least this recipe saved us from that.

Also a family tradition, I liked this version without the marshmellows and sour cream. It's not better, just better for you.

Sour cream? Marshmallows? Oh yuck! This is a much classier recipe and lovely to look at.

For as long as I can remember, we always had ambrosia and Lady Baltimore cake for our Christmas meal dessert. Our family's ambrosia, however, consisted only of orange slices and freshly grated coconut - no pineapple or cherries, as these would seem to sweet with the Lady Baltimore cake.

I recieved rave reviews at a recent office gathering. Thank you for your online recipe!

My mother's version had the alternate name of 5-cup salad. 1 cup each of coconut, pineapple, oranges (fresh or mandarin), sour cream and yes, marshmallows. It always had to sit before we could eat it so that the fruit juices would better incorporate into the sour cream. This recipe was more sophisticated, but not better, than Mom's.

A traditional Southern recipe with a great combination of flavors. Down South, we prefer to let the flavors and colors of the fruits shine, rather than cover them up with Cool Whip or marshmallows.

I made a similar recipe years ago from my ex- mother-in-law and was trying to remember it to make again for this Christmas holiday and with the help of these recipes I did! The recipe called for fruit cocktail (large can, drained) mandarin oranges(small can, drained) mini-marshmellows, sliced banana, cherries, chopped and sour cream, I think 16 oz. Used coconut extract as did not like the crunch of real but wanted the flavor. Added crushed walnuts and mix. Let stand overnight. Very easy and great tasting...

I really like this recipe. I used my mandoline to slice the oranges circular, worked like a charm. I washed and dried the marachino cherries so they wouldnt make all the other fruit pink. I left the stems on the cherries (especially for the kids). My father in law that is a very picky eater raved about this ambrosia recipe and he doesnt even like coconut. This recipe will be a tradition for us.

As one of the other reviewers mentioned, does anyone know how to make the ambrosia that I remember as a child? It had marshmallows, grapes, mandarin oranges, bananas, cherries, pineapple chunks and sour cream I think.

I've been wondering if anyone really knows how to make Ambrosia!:-) We used to make it with pineapple, orange slices, coconut, marshmallows and sour cream. We got worried about fat, so we substituted plain yogurt. Now we like it that way better. We sometimes put cherries in, too. I think we would like the banana sometimes, too.

This was a nice, old-fashioned recipe, but I personally prefer something with a bit more panache. Even with the traditional types of fruit salads, I like something creamier. It was easy to make, but rather boring and not very memorable.

This dish was okay, I think it would have done better with some nuts in it and some type of dressing

This stuff makes any holiday or Sunday dinner wonderful. Forget the marshmallowa and coolwhip.

I adore this recipe. I think the best part about ambrosia is that each family has their own version.

I've had this wonderful winter salad for Thanksgiving all my life. The proportions are different because it is always made for a very large crowd, and our family adds walnut pieces. We use canned pineapple and packaged coconut. The cherries are added mainly for color and are cut into several pieces. Because the maraschinos have had some bad press over the years, I have been substituting red-skinned apples pieces the last few years.

Forget the other review about adding cool whip & marshmallows(ugh!). This is simply heavenly and a great old-fashioned dish!

This recipie is merely a fruit salad, not Ambrosia. Where are the mashmallows or cool-whip?
