This was a really good fresh salsa. Not as hot as I expected; it was really the perfect amount of spice. I used garlic salt instead of normal salt, which tasted good. And, I added two finely diced cloves of garlic. I mean, really, who doesn't want more garlic? Anyway, the salsa was great with this addition. I also used green onions instead of scallions; again, it was great. I used a bit less cilantro, which really worked for my family. My whole family enjoyed this salsa. I will definitely make it again.

When I first read this recipe I was disturbed. I live in Ecuador, write a best-selling Ecuadorian cookbook and this is not the way our salsa is made. However, when I tried the recipe as written, it came out better than the "real" thing. Friends don't recognize it when I serve it; they ask what hot sauce ("ají") it is, but they love it and so do I.
