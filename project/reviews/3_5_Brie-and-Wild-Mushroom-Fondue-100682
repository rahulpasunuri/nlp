I'm not sure if my rating should count, since I modified a bit, but it turned out delicious! Nothing to die for by any means, but a nice change up from our regular Swiss fondue. I used a combo of Brie and Emmental (about half and half for a total of 11 oz), since that is what I had on hand. I seasoned the shiitakes with a bit of thyme, I used some garlic instead of shallots, and did not salt, only peppered with a dash of nutmeg at the end. I'm not sure how much cornstarch I used--just did like I do for Swiss fondue, put some in the cheese until it felt right as I tossed it in my fingers. It had just the right consistency, we ate just some homemade crusty bread with it. We have some leftover, so I'm going to try it as a filling for galettes tomorrow with possibly some prosciutto--think it should be quite nice! I will make this again, though less often than my regular.

The flavor was excellent, however the consistency was a little thin. I think i may have needed more cornstarch, or I may not have cooked the mushrooms down enough. I would suggest nearly overcooking the mushrooms, or go nuts with the cornstarch. My guests, however, did love the flavor. I also added some freshly chopped thyme.

I had high hopes for this. But, no one ate this at the party thatI took it to. It did have a wierd taste and did not hold well. Not a fave, unfortunately.

I had to speak up for this recipe. I have made this many times (including catered events) and people go nuts over it!

I first made this right after it appeared in Bon Appetit and have made it many times since. Not sure why the previous reviewer compared it to cream of mushroom soup--it's not even in the same ballpark! The shiitake mushrooms make all the difference--don't eliminate them! It's wonderful with a country-style multigrain bread.

I tripled this recipe for a large fondue party. I don't know the consistency/flavor of only one batch recipe but here are my thoughts. Way too thick and too much of a wine/alcohol flavor. After reconstituting and chopping the correct amt of porcini, decided against using shittake...way too many mushrooms. Just lightly dust the brie with the cornstarch as using as much as called for made a thick unattractive lump which needed to be thickened with light cream. Guests did love the final product after much "tinkering". Used cubed toasted bread; sauteed pork tenderloin, cauliflower, broccoli, spicy sausage for dippers.

I wasn't impressed with this dish at all . . . the end result was more like a cream of mushroom soup. I guess it's a matter of taste, but if you like more traditional, cheesy fondues, I would try others on the site.

This is just fabulous! A great way to use leftover chicken, broccoli, etc.

I made this for a fondue party last week, and it was the only one devoured. I added about a cup of shredded gruyere cheese at the end, and it gave it a lot more body. I also used about 1/2 cup of shallots.

Great recipe--perfect for a chilly evening. I didn't have quite enough brie, but it was still smashing. My husband and I fought about who would mop out the bottom of the fondue pot.

very unattractive and not a crowd pleaser at all.

They should call this fondoodoo, it was absolutely disgusting. I don't care about what the reviews said it was just gross.

This is great! It was a big hit at both the parties I've served it at.

To the cook from Massachussetts on the wine-- I would suggest a dry Sauvignon Blanc - try Meridien Vineyards.

This Brie fondue was a hit. The Porchino mushrooms really make the fondue. This is a great change to regular fondue cheese

I was surprised at how easy this was to make. The biggest problem was skinning the brie and cubing it (it mushed). Didn't matter though. Used mixed, dry mushroom pack from Trader Joe's and only 4 oz instead of 8 oz shitake as they were just too expensive. Didn' matter. The flavor was so good one friend dipped a cup in and drank it like soup!

Can I use a cooking white wine, or can someone please recommend the wine I should use for this recipe? Thanks in advance...

I am overdue on rating this recipe. I made this for a Holiday cocktail party for 40. I doubled the recipe, served it with blanced aspargus, toasted french cubes, and steamed (quartered) red-skinned potatoes. There was nothing left! One caveat: it is not the most eye-appealing dish.

This is a tasty fondue dish, and I have made the recipe as listed, and with variations. You have to really like mushrooms to make this fondue. The porcini's can be very overpowering, but it is still really good even if you leave them out.

To the cook from Virginia, "vegitarian version of beef stroganoff?" Then you complain it's not what you thought and give it a bad review?! Do you not know the difference between a fondue and stroganoff? pa-leeeze!

This is a keeper. Very good! Even the kids liked it!

This was HORRIBLE...truly the worst fondue I have ever had. I was really looking forward to this recipe. I made it for my birthday party & was devastated by the results. The flavor and texture were not appetizing at all. I tried everything I could think of to salvage this dish, but nothing worked.

So many good reviews-maybe I missed something? I love mushrooms and thought this looked and smelled like a vegetarian version of beef stroganoff. Way too thick and a definite waste of good Brie.

Rating: 4
Fantastic! It reheats well the next day - just put it back in a pan and whisk. Add more wine if it's too thick. I just used shiitakes-no dried mushrooms. To make up for the lacking liquid, I added a bit more wine. It was amazing!! I served it with cubed french bread and everyone loved it.

Easy & delicous! Did not vary from the recipe. Pleanty of mushroom flavor. The brie melts much easier than a swiss fondue. With leftovers, I thinned with cream and served over rosemary pasta. Superb!

Thought this was the perfect elegant appetizer to my dinner party. Served it the first time with marinated chicken (O.O., cumin, S&P, splash of vinegar), asparagus, and red potatoes. Fantastic!!! Not one complaint, only raves!

YUM! This was my first fondue too and it was TERRIFIC! I bought a small sauce warmer from Crate and Barrel and with a tea light burning underneath, it kep the fondue warm and delicious all night. I served it with a cut bagette and everyone loved it.

Wow!!! This was the first cheese fondue I've ever made. It was a hit...everyone loved it. I could not find porcini mushrooms (and I don't really like shitaki mushrooms) so I used about 1/2 of a portabello and 1 large button mushroom. Fondue would thicken as it sat, so I would occassionally add a little wine to fondue pot and stir. Reheats well too. Will definately make this again!

This was delicious! As a family tradition, we have fondue on Christmas eve. This was a wonderful addition. I did not add the dried mushrooms (I forgot actually)! It was still very good. Definitely worth making again.

Excellent! Made this for New Years party and got rave reviews. Couldn't find porcini so used crimini instead. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

The best cheese fondue ever! I get requests for this recipe every time I serve it! I made black olive french bread with it, and the flavors were terrific together.

So yummy! We used fresh oyster mushrooms instead of the dried porcinis - turned out great!

This is a great recipe. I have made it several times. When originally published, the recipe used flour instead of cornstarch and also had 2 ounces of Roquefort cheese along with the Brie. Try it!!! Don't cheat and use blue though!

This was fabulous! I couldn't find fresh shitake mushrooms so I just made it with porcini and regular button mushrooms but it still was fantastic. My husband said it was the best fondue he has ever had!

My freinds won't stop talking about this one. My husband says it was one of those times I "outdid myself" Yummy, but I spent extra time at the gym the next day!!! Will make again for sure!

This was a wonderful recipe. It was a hit with the small dinner party I had. Everybody loved it. The Brie cheese is expensive, but well worth it.

I made this delight for our New Years Party and it was a great success, especially with the chicken and potatos. I will make it again and again.

It was a big hit with guests. It was a welcome addition to the traditional fondue.

This was tasty, but the porcini were a little over-powering. Next time I will add fewer mushrooms so it will be a little cheesier.

I made this as my 'cheese fondue' contribution to our New Years fondue party, on the recommendation of friends who had tried it (and loved it) before. It was a big hit - very easy to make, rich and flavorful. I substituted dried portobella mushrooms (as the porcini had sold out), and added more wine to thin it out.

I made this without only the procini mushrooms and without the shallots and it was excellent. I only gave it three because I don't care that much for mushrooms, but the person who ate it with me would have probably given it four.

Used to make fondue long ago. Pleasant surprise to see a new twist on an old comfy meal.

Great flavor but was too thick. If I made it again I'd add more liquid. The mushroom mixture before adding the cheese would make a great sauce for pasta or on top of chicken or beef....
