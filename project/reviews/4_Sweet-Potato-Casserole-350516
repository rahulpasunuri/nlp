I made this recipe in the fall, again at Thanksgiving, and will serve with a pork roast at Christmas. Rave reviews from all!

This was fantastically easy and delicious. I used Hernandez sweet potatoes which are extremely sweet so I did not need all of the sugar, but if using another variety, I would still use the sugar. Will be making again soon!

This was the family favorite at our Thanksgiving dinner this year. I cut back a little on the sugar and orange juice, following the advice of some of the reviewers. We also added mini marshmallows over half the dish at the end to make the kids happy.

Love this one. Made it two years in a row and it's easy and delicious. Going into the permanent repertoire for Thanksgiving!

How is this a casserole? It's just mashed potatoes with butter and juice. Is it because you bake it in an oven?

Really lets the sweet potato stand out though sweetened and seasoned. Best recipe I found.

Excellent! Sweet, but not gooey.

So easy and SO delicious. The orange brightens and lightens what is traditionally a heavier and (for me) too sweet side dish. Would make this again in a hearbeat.

I've made this recipe several times and really love it. But this year I was really in a hurry so I peeled the sweet potatoes and cut them into large chunks and piled them into a large casserole dish. I mixed the orange juice, lemon juice, spices and half the sugar and just poured it over the potatoes, covered with foil, and baked for an hour. When the potatoes were soft I mashed everything together and rushed out of the house with it. Of course it wasn't perfectly smooth, but I decorated with toasted pecans and everyone loved it!

I didn't have lemon juice, so I used Lime juice. I doubled the recipe and it was gone in half an hour. My mom insists that I make this on Thanksgiving, despite her lecture on "keeping recipes traditional". Whats more traditional than changing the food every year?

I really, really love this recipe. I find it easier to blend in a food processor. To lighten it up substantially I only use about a tablespoon of brown sugar (the potatoes are so sweet already!) and drizzle in a scant tablespoon of olive oil as it processes rather than all that butter. Sweet potatoes are so nutrient packed, it's a shame to detract from that with sugar and butter. Enjoy!

I am not a big fan of sweet potatoes, but I'll eat them prepared this way anytime!

I am from the south so I edited the orange zest down to about 1 teaspoon, and eliminated the pepper. I enjoyed the casserole and had all the ingredients on hand (always a plus). One suggestion for novice sweet potatoe bakers be careful of the juice when the potatoe is forked after cooking!!!!

Too much orange juice? Not sure what the problem was but it wasn't great. Served it at Thanksgiving dinner for 12 people, wouldn't do that again. Will continue with the old sweet potato casserole recipe.

I am so used to yams and the sweetness that accompanies them. This recipe was a nice change and enjoyed by all my guests this Thanksgiving-even those that don't like sweet potatoes. I also made this recipe 2 days in advance and reheated it easily. I kept some of the sweet potatoes chunky, so my recipe was not smooth.

The flavor of the sweet potatoes was good, but I thought it was way too sweet. If I was going to make this again, I would probably cut the sugar in half.

I got a little heavy-handed with the citrus and it damped enthusiasm from my tasters --- though they did still clean their plates. The roasting of the sweet potatoes was a fabulous technique.

Exactly as the author described it...not too candy-sweet. This recipe lets the true sweet potato flavor shine through, with just enough sugar and spice to remind you of the traditional favorite. I did add mini-marshmallows, though. Couldn't resist that part of the tradition!

We loved this and the orange flavor really comes out, simple and a keeper! Roasting the sweet potatoes is the way to go - no peeling, they just slip out of there jackets!

Very good. Used a little extra spices and didn't use lemon juice because I needed it for something else.

Subtle. Good sweet potato recipe without excess sugar (as previously mentioned).

Loved it! I brought this to a pot luck dinner party, and left with an empty casserole dish. I doubled the recipe, except for the sugar, and it was still sweet enough. I also used white pepper instead of black pepper. The citrus flavor really compliments this nicely. I found it a refreshing change from the usual 'candy' approach, and will definitely make it again.

To save much needed time I cook the sweet potatoes in the microwave, piercing each several times first. Not watery and very good flavour.

Delicious, fast and easy. I used a pink grapefruit, including the meat, in place of the orange. I also preferred to precook the potatoes.
