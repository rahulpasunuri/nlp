This was very easy to make and very tasty. Would make it again. Quick and nutritious meal for all. Just wish there was also rice in it, but guess that could easily be added.

This is a very good recipe - I'd give it 2 1/2 forks, maybe even three. It's super easy to make, and very healthy. A great recipe for leftovers too - made these for dinner last night, and then brought the filling in to work today along with a tortilla to pull together for lunch. I think this would be great with jalapenos also - will add that next time.

great flavors! Even a hit with my 6 year old. I doubled the beans and used pre shredded Mex cheese from the store. I also used a "spicy" black bean that had lime and jalepenos already in them. We will definitely be making this again!

I like the fact that these taste both fresh and substantial. I left out the squash (don't like it) and served some green salsa on the side. Nice and easy!

This recipe was fine. I would add the garlic at the end...a lot of flavor cooks off. I also added jalapeno for some heat.

I used what I have, which was bell peppers, red onion, some leftover smoky black beans, and regular jack cheese. I also added leftover Oh and I only had fajita sized wraps. It was very good and very easy. And very easy to modify and a nice way to use up mexican food leftovers.

Tasty! I can never find any black beans in Lithaunia, so I had to use red, and taking other reviewers tips added jalapenos and skipped squash. Sauteing the onions, garlic, and jelepenos seperatly to keep my wife's dinner bland was no problem.

I haven't made this in a while, but I love it and when I made it for my parents they raved at the fresh taste, lightness of the dish and the fact that it's very filling too!!

I've made this several times. I skip the butternut squash. I add 1-2 jalepeno and use regular jack cheese. Sometimes I add corn and/or mushrooms. This is easy and filling and delicious.

This was great! I only made a couple of changes to the recipe. I doubled the black beans and the cumin. Also, I added a dash of cayenne pepper. I'll definitely make this again.

Found the recipe to be quick and delicious. To cut back on fat and cholesterol, I eliminated the cheese. Leftover cooked, and cubed, meat can be added as well to make the dish even more substantial. The wraps are good served warm or at room temperature. Their flavors are even more enhanced when served the next day. Plan for leftovers!!!

These were great! Easy to make and delicious. They would be great for a football party, etc. We're making them again for guests this week.

I used yellow squash instead of butternut and added extra cumin and oregano. Has great color. Needs more black beans. Make sure squash is diced small.
