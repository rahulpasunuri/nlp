I agree with what most are saying here...I would definately make this again but it is lacking something.

The crab flavor doesn't really come through due to other ingredients, but these are good comfort food, are very easy to make, and disappear quickly. The hot sauce helps!

I have been making this recipe for the entire 10 years it has been posted and they are a family standard. I have made quite few changes over time: lose the casserole dish/water. I place the mushrooms in the oven on a cookie sheet BEFORE adding the filling for about 10 minutes to dry them up a bit. I add freshly ground horseradish and I mince and add the mushroom stems. Once, when my husband had eaten the crab, I made them with Italian sausage and that was also delish. Since then we have made half the batch with crab and half the batch with a high quality sausage.

I thought these would be great, but I was pretty disappointed. The recipe has potential if you play around with it a lot...maybe. I just think there are better crab recipes out there.

We made a few adjustments: Siracha, no mayo, bread crumbs, chicken stock in place of water, and brushed the 'shrooms with butter, as well as imitation crab instead of the real deal (a cost thing). The end result was quite tasty!

I thought that it lacked in taste, could not taste the crab.

Rating: 3
These 'shrooms are wonderful. I did, however, increase the amount of tabasco to give them a little more zing. Took these to a party and reheated them by placing back into a heated oven and they held up quite nicely. These stuffed mushrooms have always gotten rave reviews when served.

I found that it is very hard to find a crab stuffed mushroom recipe on the internet. I choose this one dispite some of the negative comments. My husband and I really enjoyed these. The cream cheese was different but good. To the reviewer who thought the cream cheese added a strange taste, either they just don't care for cream cheese or perhaps they missed the "rule" in the introduction about having more crab than cream cheese. If I had missed that "rule" and put the whole 4 oz. in I would have thought the same thing. I added jalapeno season all for a little kick. Out of the few recipes I have tried for crab stuffed mushrooms these have been the best.

I made this recipe as the appetizer for a dinner party we were invited to and everyone enjoyed it. I read the reviews and decided to make some changes--especially to add more seasoning. Here's what I did: I sauteed the cut-up mushroom stems with 1 minced onion and 3 cloves of minced garlic in 1 T butter. I cooled it and added it to the rest of the mixture. I also added the following: 1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce, 1 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning and several shakes of Cayenne pepper. (I was out of Tabasco sauce.) I decided not to add the water to the casserole dish because other reviewers said that it made the mushrooms mushy. I sprayed the bottom of the casserole dish with Pam (butter flavored). I also baked them for about 30 minutes until they were brown on top.

Fantanstic dish. I used shredded swiss cheese instead of parmesan, about a 1/2 cup onion and a large clove of garlic... also about a 1/4c of hot sauce. I also left them to cook about 45min to an hour. Nothing soggy about these mushrooms. I will definitely make these again!!!

I just finished making this dish for our New Year's Eve celebration. As written, the filling definitely needs a little "umph" for us, which I added with horseradish, scallions, a little bit of spinach, garlic and a dash of mustard. The mushrooms would probably get soggy and not have much taste if you just cooked them in water, so I oiled a 13x9 glass baking dish and substituted red zinfindel wine (we had it) for the water. I cooked it without the parmesean cheese on the top and about five minutes before they were done, I put some shredded gouda cheese on the top and let it melt. The mushrooms took about 25-30 minutes to cook. All of that is a little bit extra stuff and time, but we just LOVE em'!!!

Excellent!! I don't know what the other folks made, but EVERYONE loved them. I make them on holidays now as a warm up to dinner. I've added a few of my own touches and they're great anyway you slice it.

Rating: 3
These are good enough for a main course! If you like crab and mushrooms you will love these. I made them for holiday appetizers exactly as written and everyone loved them. The mixture stuffs a lot more than 24 mushrooms. Half the recipe was left for next day shrooms.

These were bland, despite garlic and tabasco. Also, the mushrooms were watery and rather spongy. I transfered them from the baking dish to a cookie sheet to give them a drying out under the broiler for a few minutes, and added extra cheeese under the broiler, but it only helped a little. I had made enough for everyone to have three big mushrooms, but they (only out of politeness) had one each! If I had to do them again, I would use smaller mushrooms that could be popped whole into the mouth )or maybe just cut once in half),perhaps getting more flavor at once, and definitely no water in the bottom of the pan.

These taste good but get soggy.

Maybe my hopes were a little high reading the other reviews, but I thought this dish came out a little bland despite adding some flavored breadcrumbs and additional hot sauce. I was thinking the cream cheese would add a great deal to the dish, but it did not for my pallete. They were ok, but I would not make them again.

There are better stuffed mushroom recipes. My guests enjoyed these very much (I really don't think they were just being polite, since they eagerly took the leftovers home), but I thought these were pretty bland. I even added cajun spices and kicked up the garlic a bit, as other reviews suggested, but they were still missing something. A big disappointment and definitely a waste of crabmeat, in my opinion.

As many have stated, cajun spices make this dish much more palatable.

OUTSTANDING. EVERYone who tried them commented on how delicious they were. Did not use tabasco, used minced garlic,fresh not canned crab, no water in bottom of dish, just cooking spray, and cooked 30 minutes. Ended up making many copies of this recipe to give out!

I THOUGHT THIS RECIPE WAS EXCELLENT AND EASY! I MADE IT THE FIRST TIME TO TRY OUT ON MY FAMILY AND MAKE ANY ADJUSTMENTS ETC. AND WE LIKED IT SO MUCH THAT I MADE A TRIPLE RECIPE FOR COMPANY AND THEY WERE "WIPED OUT" WITHIN 30 MINUTES! THE ONLY SUGGESTION OR CHANGE I HAD WAS TO NOT PUT THE WATER IN THE BOTTOM OF THE BAKING DISH, BUT TO LIGHTLY SPRAY WITH COOKING OIL INSTEAD. I THOUGHT THE WATER MADE THEM A BIT MUSHY AND I LIKE MY MUSHROOM CAPS TO BE FIRM. AND ALSO TO COOK THEM A BIT LONGER, ABOUT 30 MINUTES. I ALSO USE MORE CREAM CHEESE - 6 TO 8 OZ. BUT THAT IS UP TO INDIVIDUAL TASTE. BUT MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS JUST "LOVED" THEM!

My whole family loved these, even the pickiest kids. Beware: I had to cook them longer than indicated in the recipe! Make sure they're cooked through.

This is a great easy recipe. My friend is allergic to real crab so I made it with imitation crab and they were still delicious. I highly recommend giving this recipe a try.

I made this recipt with Tuna instead of crab, added extra seasoning and was accidentally a bit top heavy with the tabasco. I used mozzarella instead of Parmesan. Result everyone loved it. It took a bit longer to cook than the recipe suggested, but I would definately cook it again. I am english and live in Cyprus and did not recognise an ingredient mentioned in other reviews, what is Old Bay?

I've made this recipe for several occasions now, and there is never a mushroom left. I think adding anything spicy to it is a mistake, as it covers up the beautiful taste of the mushroom. It's easy and absolutely delicious.

Boring, Boring, Boring. I even added extra tabasco. We ended up putting creole seasoning and pepper on the top to add flavor. I wouldn't make these again without significant changes.

I was looking for a standout stuffed mushroom recipe (this was the first time I'd made them), and I thought these were a little bland. Might be my fault -- I opted for canned crab. But there must be other, better s.m. recipes out there.

I read all the reviews, took all the advice, and these were FABULOUS! My husband raved. Instead of making them the night before, I sauteed the mushroom stems, onions, and garlic in butter before adding to the mixture. I did use a bit of Old Bay, added less cream cheese, and topped with mozzarella. Baked in butter instead of water. Delicious! Can't wait to make for others.

I was looking so forward to this, only to be disappointed. Quite bland and very creamy. Not worth buying the crab--I find my usual stuffed mushroom recipe much better, which also has cream cheese (no crab), onion, swiss cheese, nutmeg, Worcestershire sauce, wine and fresh bread crumbs. One note--it is much quicker and does not change the taste if the mushrooms are zapped in the microwave for 5 minutes instead of going in the oven.

Rating: 4
I used this recipe as a jumping off point to my own version of stuffed mushrooms. I omitted the crab (some guests were vegetarian) and cut the other ingredients in half. Added the chopped mushroom stems and garlic (sauted together) to the filling. Bake as directed above in the recipe. I made mine the night before like someone else suggested - great idea!! The flavors got to know each other and it was one less thing to worry about on the day of the party.

Easy to make & delicious. Experiment with the garlic and tobasco to give it the intensity you like. Great use for left over stuffing -- add a little egg and bread crumbs and pan fry in olive oil. Makes great crab cakes!

Rating: 4
I thought this was a great recipe. I added tobasco like many suggested and some cajun seasoning, too. I also had much filling left over so I spread it on some cracher and toasted them and the guest liked that just as well as the mushrooms! All of the mushrooms or crackers were eaten and I had many requests for the recipe.

I have to admit, I am not a hugh fan of stuffed mushrooms, but I made these for an office party, AND THEY VANISHED IMMEDIATLEY. The best part of it, my boss was a chef and is known for the food he brings in; HE ALONE, had about half of them, and I could only guess he was trying to figure out how I made them. Everyone asked for the recipe. I used baby bellas and did them the night before as well!

These mushrooms were a bit of a disappointment. Not as flavorful as I thought they would be. And they're a fair amount of work. Also, the recipe for the stuffing is much too large. I had so much left over filling I had to buy several more boxes of mushrooms to use it up.

Rating: 3
I added 3 large dashes of tabasco and 1/4 tspn pepper, but the key is to make these the day before. The ingredients marinade the mushrooms and they are soooooo much yummier. I have made them several times and they are always the first appertizer to go.

Made these for a large dinner party and still have people calling fot the recipe. Even my daughter who hates mushrooms loved it.

A party hit....disappeared as soon as they were served, and left people begging for the recipies. I served along with a different mushroom stuffed with bread crumbs, goat cheese, parmesean, fresh sm. dice red pepper, green onion, cilantro. These were an even bigger hit.

After reading other reviews of this recipe I knew I'd really have to play with this one to make it interesting.I used onion and chive cream cheese,lots of minced garlic, worstershire sauce and lemon juice in addition to all the other ingredients. It was good, I'd make it again.

We will definitely try these again. I used a teaspoon of minced garlic, a tablespoon of minced onion, salt, pepper and 3 large dashes of Tabasco. Very tasty, although next time I might experiment with fresh herbs in the stuffing.

I thought this recipe was horrible. The cream cheese was a very strange flavor. Not a hit at my house.

I recommend upping the garlic and tabasco to make this recipe a bit more flavorful. I used this recipe for a casual football party and everyone loved them. The best thing is, you can easily make them ahead and then cook them later that day, or even the next day. Definitely a winner!

I recommend more tabasco than is in the recipe. By testing the stuffing before baking you can adjust to your prefernce. We made a half recipe for two - never got to the main course.

I liked this recipe as it is pretty simple for making stuffed mushrooms. However,I found the stuffing to be a little bland. I suggest adding some fresh herbs, garlic, tabasco, etc. to add additional flavor.

I made this recipe only once and used crabmeat that was not dungeness crab. I didn't think the crabmeat had much flavor and affected the whole dish. I would make it again using the dungeness crab to see if the results were better. Other types of crab would probably work well too but the recipe doesn't specify the type of crabmeat.

I also added mozerella cheese to the top of the shrooms, and it was much better!! Wonderful appetizer, the whole family loved it!
