This stuffing is absolutely amazing. I made it last Thanksgiving and am planning on making it again tomorrow. The only change that I made to the recipe was to cut the french baguette into medium-large chunks, rather than coarsely ground breadcrumbs. This really helped to push the presentation to the next level.

I made this stuffing for Christmas dinner. It was a huge success. Delicious. I used brandy instead of Cognac..same thing. It was delicious. I will be keeping this in my recipe box!

Heavenly! Perfect as written. I make a basic country white bread round 1 or2 days before and then tear it into small chunks (very large crumbs). My only stuffing from now on!

I've been making this recipe every year since it was first published. I wouldn't consider something else! I do add more cognac than suggested. The recipe easily doubles. And, to answer sarahnaomi24's question - I put large chunks in the food processor to make my crumbs - day-old baguettes are best.

I have a quick question: how do you make the crumbs? Any suggestions? Do you cut them into small pieces by hand or wait until they are stale? Should you put them into the food processor? Thank you for your help!

This was a nice recipe my husband and I enjoyed as a side to a whole roasted chicken. I used all fresh herbs, right out of my herb garden. The shallots, tarragon and chives gave it a lovely flavor and as stated before in the reviews, the cognac is key. The only change I made was to add some chopped celery to the recipe. This is definitely going to be kept in my keeper file, to be used again.

i think this is supposed to call for 1 TEASPOON of salt. i just made it with 1 tablespoon, as it says, and it's way too salty.

I've made this recipe 3 times now and it's fantastic. The turkey gets extra juicy from all the butter.

I have tried at least a half dozen stuffing recipes from this site. This one may be the best yet. I made no changes, just used the full 1 1/2 cups of broth.

I LOVE stuffing, and this recipe was fantastic. I read the previous reviews & decided to go easy on the tarragon. Also, the store was out of fresh tarragon, so I used dried - used 2 instead of 3 tbsp. That seemed to be fine, no overwhelm from the tarragon. The congac really did add a nice touch. Yum. Will definitely make again

Good stuffing, lots of flavor from the herbs. I halfed the butter and shallots, added celery.

We enjoyed it so much on Thanksgiving, and didn't have any leftover, so we had to make it again to have with our "official" leftovers on Friday. We did use 1 1/2 cups of chix stock and full measurements using dried seasonings! Delicious - and it is a keeper for next year.

This stuffing was incredibly good. I did not think the tarragon was overpowering and I am usually a little leery of tarragon. The cognac brought the whole dish together beautifully!!

Sorry to be one of the few naysayers but.......... this stuffing was horrible. The tarragon absolutely overpowers this dish. Made it for Thanksgiving to the universal dismay of everyone who ate it. (Actually, my sister-in-law thought it would be good as an egg roll filling) On a more positive note: Turkey w/shallot pan gravy = A+/Butternut squash with rosemary breadcrumbs = A+/Horseradish mashed potatoes = A+/Roasted brussel sprouts with garlic and pancetta = A+ All from this web site. Phenomenal.

This was FANTASTIC! I made a few revisions which I thought made it even better - I added sauteed onions and garlic (and used about half the shallots called for). My family loved it, and I will be sure to make this for years to come!

This is the first stuffing I have ever made from scratch and it was very good, although I made many variations to conform to what I had in the pantry. I didn't have enough shallots, so I used yellow onion to complete the 2 cups. I also added some chopped celery. Will use less butter next time. I toasted the fresh bread crumbs, added less tarragon and doubled the chives. I did think 1 tbs. of salt was to much, you can always salt more at the end. I also left out the Cognac and added the 1 cup of chicken broth.

Incredibly simple prep for such a delicious result. I don't even like dressing and I had two servings of this! I never make recipes exactly like they're written, but I didn't change a thing on this one. Great.

This stuffing was stunning! Next holiday I will double the recipe, the family enjoyed it so much, we had no leftovers!

I made my whole Thankgiving meal from this website. This one recipe came out ahead, and was well received by all. Everyone wanted to take some leftovers home, and requested the recipe. While preparing the meal, I thought the amount of shallots seemed high, but in the end it came out perfectly. Also, I think the Cognac brought out the flavor of the herbs.

This is one of the best stuffing recipes I have encountered. Even my super picky, vegetarian dad-who-doesn't-like-anything-I-make liked it!

This stuffing is great...I added sliced mushrooms, and some sauteed, crumbled turkey sausage and an extra bit of Cognac...DELICIOUS! Before roasting, I brushed the turkey with a mixture of melted butter, orange zest, fresh rosemary and sage. My husband ate the leftovers for breakfast!!!
