I used panko instead of breadcrumbs and omitted the horseradish cream. I served the fishcake over an arugula salad lightly dressed with olive oil and lemon juice. A nice, quick meal.

I made this for a barbeque recently with smoked rainbow trout, and it was extremely well-received. I left out the capers, mostly because I'd forgotten I didn't have any until too late. I also used store-bought breadcrumbs. Either way, these were no worse for the wear. I was pleased that the smoke flavor wasn't overwhelming, given how very strong the smoke flavor was in the plain fish. I will definitely be making these again, as the guests are already asking when I'll be going back to the smokehouse next.

This was really good. I give very few recipes four forks unless they are out of this world. This is definitely a "do again". I had left over horseradish sauce from the Ribeye Tacos recipe, also on this site - that's what I used for these trout cakes. I would also recommend that one. Yum!

i used a smoked whitefish, added fresh dill and squeezed the juice of half of the lemon i zested and omitted the capers... i also used panko intead of breadcrumbs... good crab cakes are wonderful, but these are sublime.

My parents have a neighbor who is knee-deep in trout fishing season in PA right now, and I am benefitting from all his catches. We're awash in trout! This recipe is an exceptional way to use them. I cleaned three baked med. size trout for this, constantly pulling pinbones, of course. Because they weren't smoked, I used two dashes of Liquid Smoke. Also used a 1/2 t.onion powder, 2% milk instead of cream and panko breadcrumbs. DELICIOUS! The horseradish cream is the perfect complement, as is the Tomato Jam recipe on this site. I cannot wait to make this again. If at all possible, use fresh trout, it is soooo worth it.

I made this into small cakes to serve as hors d'oeuvres. Since I do not like sour cream, I made up my own version of horseradish cream which was very delicious: 1/2 cup of Mayonnaise, 1 tbsp of 35% cream, 1 tbsp Horseradish, 1 tbsp Dijon mustard, zest of 1/2 lemon. Serve a dollop of cream sauce on each cake. Very very nice and elegant.

I've made this recipe 4 times now - and been very happy each time. The best combo I've found is 50%/50% smoked fish and regular fish - also tried it using canned crab and it was very good. Agree with an earlier comment that the capers are a bit strong and can be cut back on. For me the revelation was the fresh bread crumbs - they make a really crispy crust that stands up to waiting - by the time all the cakes are ready the first ones are still crispy

I thought this was overrated. The best part was eating the trout plain while flaking it. Some of my guests liked it but i thought it was so so.

I was so glad to find this recipe! I've kept all my Bon Appetits for years but couldn't find the issue containing this recipe. The cakes were out of this world! I'm so pleased to know you have the recipes on the web. Thank you.

This recipe can be prepped the night before. It has a great flavor and always gets great reviews.

Fabulous. Guests raved. Not so sure about the capers (and I like capers). The horseradish cream is a must. Quick and easy and a consolation for not being able to make crab cakes in my part of Europe.

I am a big fan of crab cakes. This is better than any crab cake I have eaten. I smoked the trout myself. It was outstanding. I wouldn't change anything. Delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

These were great. They were pretty easy to make and were popular with some dinner guests. People were later dipping veggies in the horseradish cream. And, the horseradish cream goes well on roastbeef sandwiches.

this recipe is very easy to make, however, the flavors are very strong - almost too strong. I made smaller cakes to use as appetizers and it was still too much flavor (even w/ the horseradish cream). Maybe more bread crumbs will help, but too much smoked trout for the recipe.
