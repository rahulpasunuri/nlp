The first time I made this cake the layers did turn out too dense and dry so second time around I reduced the flour to 1.5 cups and used 1 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp baking soda. I didn't want a huge tower so I baked it in 3 9-inch pans for 25 min at 340F convection. I also brushed the layers with a bit of a simple syrup with touch of cognac. It turned out perfect.

Can this recipe can be used with other nuts, like hazelnut or almond?

Personally, I don't think the subtle taste of the chestnuts holds up very well against the mousse and chocolate ganache. This recipe may be great using hazelnut flour instead of chestnuts, but I wouldn't make this exact recipe again.

After reading the comments on the cake layers turning out a little dry, I made a few modifications and ended up with an amazingly moist (albeit dense!) and delicious cake! I added 1/4 cup extra sour cream, use canned water-packed chestnuts for the batter (which I minced super-small instead of grinding) and used an extra tablespoon or so of the water from the can, and brushed each cake layer with cognac-scented simple syrup before frosting and stacking. So wonderful! A little expensive but great for a special occasion. Two more tips I would add-- the recipe suggests waiting for the chocolate-cognac mixture to cool to the thickness of softened butter before mixing with the whipped cream and egg whites, but I found this to be way too thick-- I think it should still be a little thin but completely cooled. And secondly, do not skimp on the booze! The five tablespoons of cognac barely shine through the richness of the chocolate, I would even consider a little more next time ;) Maybe that's just me.

A delicious looking recipe that didn't quite live up to the picture. The components were delicious, but I also had an issue with the density of the cake layers. Someone mentioned more sour cream, which I didn't see until too late, but if anyone has suggestions or a confirmation of that as a solution it will help when I try this again. I found the shelled, roasted chestnuts at an Asian/International grocery, but the candied chestnuts were ordered online from the Frenchy Bee in WA...big hassle and not cheap, though they had the best price. Next time I think I'll try this with hazelnuts and an espresso mousse.

I'm so excited that I found this recipe again! When I first purchased the magazine, I made this recipe 3 times, for 3 different occasions. I had a difficult time finding some of the ingredients, so had to use and roast chestnuts instead of purchasing canned. It is an expensive desert but definately was well received at all occasions. Found it does take more than 5 hours, and allowed myself at least 2 days to complete. Will definately be making this a Christmas tradition!

I thought this cake was a blast to make. It took a bit of time, but everything went well. Based on several reviews I did add a bit more sour cream to the cake to avoid the dryness and as well used the simple syrup idea for the cakes. The cake by itself was great, even though I used hazelnuts instead of chestnuts, but I thought the mousse was a bit too strong and overpowered the nuts. I think next time I'll use a plain chocolate mousse instead. And maybe use a hazelnut spread instead of ganache between the first and second layers.

It was sooo wonderful!! I brought it to our departmental christmas everyone loved it. The only thing I would do different is whip the mousse more after I added the chocolate.

While the cake is beautiful, it is time consuming and the results are just ok. The cake itself is somewhat dry. I love chestnuts and I hate to say that I wouldn't make this again. Too much time and money ($10 for a jar of roasted chestnuts) for a dry cake.

This was excellent and my Thanksgiving Day dinner guests thought so too. At this time of year, I found all the chestnut ingredients easily. I followed the recipe very carefully and experienced none of the problems reported by some who posted here. It is labor-intensive, but well worth it.

I couldn't find chestnuts in my small town markets & I didn't want to buy them online so I substituted hazelnuts. The result? Incredible. I brought this cake over to my girlfriend's house for dinner a few months ago and they are still begging me to make it again. It is, of course, time intesive but well worth it. The next time I make it, since I put hazelnuts in it instead of chestnuts, I am going to use a hazelnut or chocolate liqueur in the mousse. I thought the cognac was a little strong anyway and the hazelnut or chocloate liqueur would complement the cake nicely.

The cake looked and tasted great. It was a challenge to make but that was the point. Marron glaces were impossible to find locally or online in March (Carnavale Party menu). I found the roasted chestnuts at www.grandfood.com and replaced the chopped marron glaces with chestnut spread (vanillee). The mousse did not set up quickly for me and after the third layer of cake was placed on top, the mousse oozed out the sides. I had to take the top layer off, chill the cake w/mousse and replace the top layer. In the end, it all worked out

This is a VERY labor-intensive cake to make, but the results are well worth the effort. I was unable to find chestnuts of ANY sort where we are so I used pecans instead. I candied whole pecan halves for the garnish and then used chopped pecans in the cake layers. I also candied some chopped pecans and used them w/ the fillings between the cake layers too. I also used strong coffee instead of the Cognac as I was making this for a company luncheon and did not want a strong liquor flavor. The coffee was wonderful and we never missed the liquor flavor. I received rave reviews and the texture was moist and light. However, with as much time as it took to make, I think that if I do make it again, it will have to be for a VERY special occasion! I also suggest making it over the course of 2-3 days. Also, for the chocolate ganache, I used Baker's brand bittersweet chocolate. It ended up being too oily and I had to skim the oil from it as it rose to the surface. Very strange. But it still tasted yummy!!!

I did eventually make this for Christmas dinner. As someone stated earlier, it is time-consuming, and it is expensive, but this is not a cake you make to save time and money.You have to be in the mood to make this and view it as a special project for a special ocassion.You end up with a really impressive and delicious cake. Everybody loved it and I would make it again when I had the time and inclination.

I found it difficult to find some of the ingredients, and found myself substituting other things for them, but overall, it was very good, and the entire party loved it!

I made this cake for our annual Christmas eve dinner at my mother's home where the whole family pitches in to do the "Gourmet Entertains" Christmas menu. The cake itself was easy to make and assemble after reading the instructions thoroughly. My problem was in getting the ingredients; I waited too long to go shopping for the chestnuts and could only find chestnut puree sweetend and vanilla added. SO I improvised. I added the puree by weight to the batter of the cake layers; spread more puree on top of the layers for the assembly part since candied chestnuts were not available and roasted a handful of my own chestnuts to make the carmelized decoration. I wondered why one couldn't roast your own chestnuts for the cake layers or have a recipe to candy them yourself. I think this would have been the case in an earlier decade of Gourmet. Some alternative instructions would be helpful to those of us not living in proximity to the supplies of New York City. My cake turned out to be spectacular to look at but a little dry. I had enough ganache for everything. I would make it again because it actually sounds good and looks good in the picture and if mastered has GOT to taste great. I will make it for my birthday.

Yesterday I made this cake and the taste was not worth the time spent. I also found that it became expensive to purchase all the ingredients and I could've had a better cake if I went out and purchased it. This cake also took me well over 5 hours to make and as I said, was not worth the effort.

Haven't eaten the torte yet so I hope to god it's good since I spent most of my day yesterday preparing it. A few things -- I live in Denver and had a terrible time finding candied chestnuts (Whole Foods had no idea what I was talking about and so did a European Market). Therefore, I candied my own so we'll see how that went. Also, the glaze at the end didn't work out at all. I didn't have enough to cover the sides -- only the top with dripping down the sides. It looks pretty but we'll see. This recipe does take a very long time so I wouldn't recommend it just yet -- we'll see how the end result goes....

very good, but difficult in parts. one warning: make sure that the chocolate cognac mixture is slightly chilled (not stiff) before addind the egg whites. If not, the mousse will be very droopy and not rest very well on the cake. I had to do an emergency chill of the mousse to get it to work in my case.

I thought that this was somewhat tedious, though well worth the effort in the long run. However, because I don't usually have the time to make something so involved, I probably will not make this again. I found that the 1/4 cup of ganache saved for the final frosting was not quite enough (I left my cake at 8" diameter), and that I had more than enough to do the initial frosting, so I would save at least 1/2 cup. I did not think the cake dry, but rather somewhat dense.

I always make an over-the-top cake for Thanksgiving and this was no exception. I did not wait for the mousse to set and then had to hold it on until it did, but once the icing went on, it looked fine. Of course it did not look like the picture, and I did not use the candied chestnuts, but it was really, really special. Also, instead of cognac, I used grappa. That added a less sweet note that I think improved it overall. I highly recommend this cake.

The cake came out very well and wasn't too much work; however, you should know that it's so rich the recipe yield is way more than 8 servings. Maybe more like 18. Now I have a lot left over! It's still tasty, but the mousse isn't quite as light as it was three days ago. I'd only make this again if I were serving a crowd.

I haven't made this yet. Just wanted to say: Williams-Sonoma has great vacuum-packed chestnuts this time of year. I buy lots of jars, then just keep them year-round.

We made this for Thanksgiving and it was fantastic, it's also quite a display (even without cutting the layers.) We didn't find the layers, dry simply light in comparison with everything else. The whole roasted chestnuts were easy to find but the candied ones are nowhere. The closest was the ones packed in syrup. Give yourself time. I also agree to let the mousse set up for a few minutes before applying the third layer.

If you live anywhere a Cost+ imports store, they always carry the whole peeled chestnuts in a jar.

Although I haven't made this recipe yet, I can share some information about the chestnuts. The readily available chestnuts in a jar are usually referrd to as "vacuum packed". The next best thing are chestnuts canned in water. Both easier than peeling and roasting your own. The brands are usually French and usually difficult to find. Good luck!

I am an Executive Chef and an acomplished baker...I found the cake to be too dry next time will use a simple syrup on the finished layers also let the mousse set up a bit before applying to the middle layer. I could not find canned roasted chestnuts in my area so I bought fresh and roasted myself...I forgot what a pain it is to get the skins off so that they were pretty enough to dip into the carmel.
