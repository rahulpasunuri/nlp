Not for the faint of heart! I have been making this for years...very hot! Similar to the heat of really hot horseradish. We love it with pork loin. Absolutely fabulous on a county ham biscuit. Of course I am not from the south...they would never ruin a ham biscuit with a condiment. But they are missing something really yummy! Salty,sweet and oh, so hot!
