I found this recipe about 5 years ago on the back of a Diego's corn tortilla package and tried it... it was the first 'adult' breakfast my then 18month old ate - she gobbled it up. The recipe called for chopped tomatoes, which margaret5433 added, and I also would add cheese. CORN tortillas a must. Easy, yum and a little different. Now I've been reminded of it, will make it again and hope picky child #2 will eat it!

This is a fantastic breakfast recipe! Fast, easy & if you double it you can easily serve 6-8 people. I added some cut-up tomatoes to the dish and cooked that together with the chilies & cilantro. I also added some shredded cheese toward the end of cooking, covered the dish, turned off the heat and let it sit for 5 minutes or so. My husband loved it!

I manage sales for a regional tortilla maker and have the opportunity to visit many operators. The other day I found one my end users in the kitchen making this dish. (hispanic gentleman) He diced up a corn tortilla and "stir fried" it and then added eggs, etc. I found the dish to be very tasty using the corn tortilla instead of flour. He said this is dish served in most Mexican households. Just a thought.

Easy, quick and satisfing. Melted shredded cheese with flour tortilla and egg mixture, added salsa while cooking, and topped with avocado.

OK they are missing out. My husband loves this dish. I serve it with a glop of sour cream and La Victoria green taco sauce (similar to tomatillo salsa)and a sprig of cilantro. Couldn't be easier.

Just ok. I don't understand why someone from Artesia, NM would submit a recipe calling for canned green chile when we have access to a bounty of fresh and frozen. But Artesia really is more Texan in spirit than New Mexican, so maybe that's why....

This was good but not outstanding. It was also fast to make.
