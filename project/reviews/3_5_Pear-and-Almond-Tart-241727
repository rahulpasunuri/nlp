Upon reading reviews, I soaked the pears in brandy for 24 hours and added a little almond extract to custard. Taste was not bad and almond crust delish but overall still too eggy. Would leave out extra egg yolk if I make again. A lot of work for so-so result.

Admittedly, I made a few tweeks to this recipe, but it turned out wonderfully! I made this for a dinner party for which the menu required waaaaay more tart pans than I had available... so it was billed as a rustic pear and almond tart to great fanfare. I used an egg-based shortcrust pastry (super flakey and delicious). Since I couldn't blind bake it (due to it's rusticness) and wanted an extra kick of almond, I spread almond paste before mounding the pear filling in the tart. I also marinated the pears in cognac and a teaspoon of sugar and a small squeeze of lemon juice for a few hours and redoused the pears with cognac before filling the tart. Basically, I doubled the cognac called for as the chill took away most of the flavor in the syrup but the Bartlett pears were infused. Delightful! The custard took about 25 to 30 mins in the oven to set. Just keep checking it. I'll probably make this recipe again when I have a large chunk of the day to devote to it.

This was a little labor intensive but turned out great. The crust was perfect. Added a bit more vanilla and almond extract, soaked the pears in the cognac. Made two smaller tarts instead of one big one.

I made no modifications to the recipe. I followed it exactly. My crust came out bland and tough, the custard cooked into basically dried out egg, the pears were flavorless ( may need to marinate in brandy for a period of time??) and the topping was just eh. Such a waste of time (4 hours!) and money

This tart is beautiful, the crust is crisp and tasty, the textures are great, but the flavor misses. If I make it again I will add some almond extract to the custard. I also added more sliced almonds. The shorter shell baking times worked for me, but the pears took about 5 minutes longer and the custard and topping about 7 minutes longer.

The custard took three times the recommended time to cook in the recipe. However, the result was worth the wait. I served this for friends and they loved it. I used Cognac. It gave the custard a light wonderful taste.

We thought this was good but not spectacular. It lasted pretty well in the fridge, though it definitely needs to be brought to room temperature before serving.

Made this with the cognac and it was very good. next time i will not bake the custard as long. my father thought it was wonderful!

I did not have pear brandy or cognac, so I used lemon juice instead. The 1/2 cup of almonds was not good enough, and the custard took much longer than the recommended time to cook. It was delicious, though, and beautiful!

I made this exactly according to the recipe; it turned out very well, and looked just like it does in the photo. The custard took about 25 minutes, not 18, to be set as indicated, but it turned out fine anyway. I would make this again, but it didn't rate 4 forks for me because, while wonderful, it wasn't absolutely magical.

We had this for a dinner party last night (paired with the Chicken in Riesling in the March Gourmet) and it was a huge hit. I used Bosc pears and Calvados instead of the pear brandy - turned out great.

The crust is wonderful - beautiful golden color and crunch. The flavor is subtle but delicious. I like the idea of increasing the almond flavor, by adding almond paste, or perhaps almond extract instead of vanilla.

I love the crust and simple elegance of this tart. Next time I'll add a little almond paste to the custard mix.

Absolutely delicious. It tasted like french pastry. Served it at a dinner party and everyone raved about it. I used pear juice mixed with brandy since I didn't have any Pear Brandy. I also used frozen puff pastry. I did not bake it first, but placed the pears in the uncooked pastry and started the baking process from there. Thanks for the recipe, Ruth!.
