This was a pantry dish for me so I had to substitute the bacon I had on hand for the pancetta, and still it was delicious. There is more than enough dressing so I'll skimp on that next time. I find the french shallot dressing elsewhere on epicurious is a better use of shallots in a leftover dressing than this one.

WOW! The only thing I changed was swapping turkey bacon for pancetta (didn't have it at my store). My family said it was the BEST salad they have ever had. Enough said.

This is my favorite salad to make for a dinner party! It has a nice crisp texture and tangy flavor that serves as a nice break between hor d'oeuvres and the main course.

Served this on the patio with a surf and turf summer dinner. It was fresh, clean and balanced the other flavors nicely. Used Walnut Oil instead of grapeseed oil and it worked well. Also, used Butter lettuce cut into small pieces. Mache didn't look as nice at my store. Would make it again!

This is a very good salad. The pancetta and almonds are fantastic. I didn't use the butter lettuce leaves. Be sure to add enough salt and pepper to the dressing. I actually put the julienned apples into the dressing to keep them from browning. Then I added the apples to the salad and had dressing leftover. I do not like over dressed salads.

Great recipe. Make sure you taste the salad dressing before putting it on the salad. I ended up using another vinegratte. The grapeseed oil did not go well with me.

This is now one of our favorte salads, we used arugula and baby greens, the almonds (slivered ) sauteed in pancetta fat are great, don't forget the champagne, Pol Roger or Mountadon were a nice match.

We made the entire menu for dinner club and found the salad to be very boring and bland.

I made this for a casual dinner party, and it was met with positive reviews all around. The mache and butter lettuce provided different flavors, and the dressing was wonderful. The pancetta and the almonds cooked in the panchetta drippings were delicious as well. I will certainly use this recipe again!

My daughter prepared all dishes but the pizza from the "Party with Fizz" menu as a Mother's Day gift. How delicious! The salad is one I'm looking forward to serving again.
