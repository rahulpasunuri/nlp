Love this recipe - made it several times including this past w/e. I place the bay leaves, allspice, peppercorns and cinnamon sticks in cheese cloth bundles to avoid "fishing" them out after. I have never used a green pepper in this recipe and have never missed it. Often make several weeks in advance and freeze (allow 1 day to thaw in refrigerator and allow to sit at room temp at least one hour before final heating)

I made a few modifications. First by marinating the lamb in pomegranate syrup for a couple of hours. Then I added pomegranate syrup (about a half of a cup) to the veggie mixture. THIS WAS THE BEST THING I EVER MADE!!!

This is the Bomb! OMG sooo good i used red wine cause that is what i like. I added a small chopped chili pepper (med hot heat) again my preference. I try not to use canned veggies, so i used fresh tomatoes worked perfect. Worth the work knocked my guests socks off. Cant wait to make this again

We thought this was wonderful. It did take some time, but nothing difficult or taxing. I'm feeling under the weather today, so it did feel like a formidable task. I braised the lamb in a 5 quart dutch oven. The sauce didn't seem like enough, so I added an extra cup (or two) of red wine (I used red instead of white). I also added about a tablespoon of demi-glace to the sauce. After braising, I reduced the sauce on the stove while I picked the lamb from the bone. My shanks were cut like osso bucco. I will be making a double batch of this for my next dinner party! Yum!

I've made this dish many times both with the lamb and also with roast chicken (for those who don't eat lamb) and it is always a success. Great winter comfort food. Serve with cheese polenta, roast veggies and nice Italian wine.

Classy, delicious recipe. Made a couple of changes. I combined the eggplant with the sauce, and then made polenta. Served one lamb shank per person with sauce upon a mound of creamy polenta. Leftovers were better the next day.

This was a fantastic recipe! Seriously. If you want to impress your family and friends, this is the recipe to do it with. I even won over a former eggplant & lamb hater.

This was a great rainy day dish. I upped the garlic as well and was very pleased with the results-the leftovers were even better.

I had such great hopes for this because I love the ingredients. But, after following the recipe exactly, I ended up with a pile of lamb-y goo with no distinct flavors whatsoever and a mouth feel of nothing but fat. When I pulled the lamb shanks out of the oven and removed the foil, I found very tender lamb in obliterated tomatoes, swimming in fat. My tight foil cover was obvioulsy not tight enough. Why not use a small stock pot with a lid? There was no "separating" the sauce; my shanks were well trimmed, but all remaining liquid in the pan was fat, which was poured off. I just finished eating the final product and it wasn't bad; but it was just lamb-lamb-lamb. Munching the whole allspice and peppercorns was actually refreshing. Too bad I didn't save that bay leaf. I couldn't help thinking that 350 for 3 hours is an awfully high temperature for such a long braise. One thing I will say for it is that, although the process for this dish is a long one, it is certainly not labor-intensive. If I made this again, I would double the sauce, use a stock pot with a lid to ensure it remained a sauce, and reduce either the braising temperature or the time. Now, back to my glass of sauvignon blanc to get the lamb fat out of my mouth. Blech.

This is one of my favorites from Epicurious, which is saying a lot! Despite the level of work involved, I've made it twice in the last 3 months. Variations - it's fine with or without green pepper, and lamb shanks seemed to come out more tender than the leg of lamb I had to use the second time. Otherwise, the recipe is great as is.

Yesterday's recipe of the day was Creamy Scrambled Eggs with Smoked Trout and Green Onions. I suspect that the first part was inadvertently left on the home page when the titles were switched.

But where are the scrambled eggs?? The Epicurious homepage says "Creamy Scrambled Eggs with Braised..."

This was so super tasty. I liked that it could be made in advance and popped into the oven. Didn't have shanks, so used butterflied leg of lamb. So good. Lots of prep work though, so it'll be a weekend/special occasion dish.

This recipe lives up to its review. Totally, totally wonderful. After the initial meal has been almost devoured, except for the sauce, I have found ways to use that leftover sauce in a myriad of Middle Eastern foods. I have simmered stuffed baby eggplant and stuffed zucchini in the sauce as well as used the sauce to cook okra and green beans.

My wife does not eat lamb. She devoured this meal. This receipe is that good!!! Of course, no self respecting Mediterranian recipe using only two cloves of garlic. We increase it to 6.

I made this last night - it was great! The sauce really makes the dish. I didn' t have allspice or a cinnamon stick, so I substituted whole cloves and ground cinnamon. Really great!

As I set out to make this recipe I was skeptical about the ingredients.However I love lamb and eggplant. To my surprise it was delicious and although long to prepare it can be done over a few days. One thing that still puzzles me is whether or not you are supposed to remove the whole allspice and peppercorns at some point or warn your guests and avoid them while you are eating. I removed them as I came across them while assembling the dish. I used 4 shanks and 1 large eggplant which made 4 generous portions. I think 5 shanks would serve 6.
