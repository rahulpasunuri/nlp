Yellow tomatoes are not in season right now but the yellow cherry tomatoes were available. Used those in a small casserole dish. Doubled the mushroom mixture and put it on top of the halved and roasted tomatoes. Topped that with shredded Manchego and baked it for 5-10 minutes. A healthy, flavorful and easy side dish.

Restaurant quality! My wife and I used this recipe as a vegetarian main course for two... could have used a third stuffed tomato each. I doubled the entire mushroom mixture and grilled it longer (about 15- 20 minutes) over low heat (gas grill) with hickory chips. They really browned up nicely and had a fantastic smokey flavor. I used probably 1.5 times the parm as well. Didn't use the tomato tops. Served over a bed of baby spinach with a homemade honey wine vinaigrette instead of the poorly-rated shallot dressing. Might just make this again to impress both our parents this weekend!

This was very easy to prepare and delicious with the added bonus that you can have the tomatoes stuffed and ready to go into the oven several hours ahead of time. That makes last minute prep minimal. I served this as a side rather than a standalone salad by adding extra lettuce - spilling it from the top of the tomato to fill the side of the plate. (Very pretty when you use mixed lettuce colors.) Also, the recipe calls for a sweet vinaigrette. You may want to substitute an unsweetened herb vinaigrette to pair better with savory foods.

This was a great dish..or rather salad. It was a perfect starter! Everyone enjoyed it. I used arugula as the greens. I recommend it. This is a fun salad and I would make it again.

addictively good! We used extra mushrooms (a couple of shiitakes, a couple of oyster, and two morels), a little extra parmesan, and extra arugula on the top. Perfect; we'll definitely be making this one again. Leftovers (if there are any) reheat well the next day for lunch!
