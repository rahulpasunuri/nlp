This was a big hit with everyone. They loved the tanginess. I added a little extra garlic and used canned beans instead of dried and it still turned out great.

Lemony and tangy... I enjoyed the flavor of the mint. Not a thing wrong with the recipe... but I'd opt to try another next time, hoping for sublime rather than pleasant.

This is a qualified yes. While the mint was good with the lamb, it wasn't great with the pita. The northern beans, especially canned, make this an easy "hummos" with great texture. Omitting the mint and adding more parsley will make it perfect.
