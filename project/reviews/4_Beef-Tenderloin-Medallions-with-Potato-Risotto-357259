Fantastic potatoes, creamy, flavorful and just a hint of heat. I don't agree that 1 lb of potatoes will feed 6 people, so I adjusted the amount and had some leftover. I as well as others found them to be quite runny, so next time I think I will start with half of the broth and add as necessary. I will add garlic next time as others have done. Overall great potatoes and will certainly be making these again.

these potatoes are wonderful. i've made them for a few people and everyone loves them--they pack a bit of punch because of the cayenne, they're rich and creamy because of the starch from the potatoes thickens the broth even before you add cream, and they have more flavor than your typical mash because of the broth. chopping the potatoes is admittedly a huge pain. it's worth it. another commenter said that the potatoes are runny. i think so too. i usually serve them in a separate bowl for that reason. doesn't hurt the taste--just may affect your plating.

I hate to be the nay-syaer after all these great reviews but I made the potatoes last weekend as part of a birthday dinner for a dear friend and I was not impressed. First, I don't think there is any way one pound of potatoes would work for six people as the recipe says. I was having six people and I used two pounds of potatoes. Had some leftover but think if I had just used one pound there would not have been enough. The prep was a little tedious but if the results had been there that would have been fine. Despite the cream, butter and cheese I just thought they lacked a real WOW flavor (although God only knows what my arteries thought!!) I did not add garlic because I had used garlic in the rub for the accompanying beef tenderloin and didn't want to overwhelm. In the end, I found the mixture still a bit soupy after plenty of simmering. No remarks from my guests one way or another --- although my tenderloin did get raves! In the future I will return to my usual special occasion potato-- -Scalloped Potatoes with three cheeses on this site.

I made just the potatoes from this recipe and they were DELICIOUS! I also added two cloves of minced garlic when adding the potatoes to the pot. Everyone loved it and actually quite easy to make.

Wow, what a great potato dish. This one is a keeper and will stay in rotation. Followed recipe, and it came out great. Did add garlic as many reviewers suggested. Will play with level of cayanne... it was too much for some. Great side dish for the tenderloin. As stated in recipe, it does hold well allowing you to focus on finishing other menu items.

This is a great recipe. An absolute gastronomical pleasure. I replaced the butter with extra virgin olive oil and it was perfect.

Fantastic, I made this for my wife and son last night and we decided this recipe is a family keeper. With the exception of adding some garlic and white pepper I followed it to the letter. I like the fact you can do it a little ahead of time and then focus on the delicate timing of the steaks. I recommend adding the broth gradually as in traditional risotto, I put it all in at once per the recipe and it took a lot longer to absorb than advertised. But we are at high altitude here in the Rockies too. We paired it with a Rosemount Shiraz and it was a perfect match. I look forward to making this again soon for guests.

Yum! Made exactly as recipe instructed except I did add a couple of minced garlc cloves to the risotto as others suggested.

This was absolutely delicious. Not only that it was easy. It is a great variation on our normal meat and potato dinners. My boyfriend and I can't wait to make this for our friends and family. We followed the recipe exactly, but next time I think we may play around with the risotto ingredients. It's a definite keeper.

I am not a cook, but felt like one after this dish! I LOVED the potatoes! So creamy and delicious! I couldn't find the specified meat at the store, and the one I chose was not a good pairing with the potatoes. I also made grilled asparagus which went great with everything. Love this dish, just hope I can find the meat next time!

The potatoes were so easy to make and extremely delicious. We added asparagus to the dinner as a side and found it wonderful as a compliment. I never thought of making potato risotto and I will definitely make it again. You do need to add salt if you are using homeade broth and I would use a 1/4 of a teaspoon of cayenne if you want to taste the spice. Great recipe!

Easy way to get potatoes cut: when spouse asks "anything I can do to help?"...hand over the potatoes. In this case, he liked them so well he said he would do them again! Like others, I included garlic, minimized cayenne due to kids but next time I'll leave it out, maybe add some ground white pepper instead. I used Evaporated Milk instead of heavy whipping cream and didn't miss the cream at all, especially since the Parmesan was fresh and just grated.

I made this dinner for guests and it turned out to be one of the best potato recipes EVER!!!!. Yea the hard part is cutting up the potatoes; I made mine probably a little larger than 1/8 inch and it still tuned out great. A definite keeper

Basically this is a potato recipe which could be matched with any meat. Flavor is excellent, but there must be an easier way to cut potatoes. Any ideas?

I tried this recipe last weekend. It was unbelievably good! It's definately a keeper for me.

This risotto was amazing! I was a bit lighter-handed with the heavy cream, (about halved it) - and it still came out absolutely delicious. A real sophisticated comfort food! Even the leftovers days later were still delicious - Hot or cold!

I cheated - my dice was a little larger than specified, but it didn't seem to matter. Delicious. And I liked the spice of the cayenne. If you are a spice lover though, like me, and normally increase the spice to kick up the heat - don't do it on this one.

I made this for my girlfriend for Valentines Day. She was quite impressed (as was I)! Maybe next time I will use less cayenne pepper. She mentioned that she might have liked some mushrooms in it. She also asked for the recipe so that she could make it for her daughters. Thanks!

We also made this for Valentine's Day dinner and loved it. We forgot to pick up chives so we used some extra onion and added two cloves of garlic. Even so, my husband and I highly recommend this one.

Oh, yum! We just made this for our Valentine's meal and loved it. The risotto is lovely- we added one clove of garlic, and I agree that less cayenne is better. We used a scant 1/8 tsp. We served this with the haricots verts with herb butter and the milk chocolate caramel tart with hazelnuts and espresso, both Epi recipes and both divine. Drank with a fabulous Zinfandel. YUM!

I made this as written; it was delicious and definitely a "make again" meal. I used dried thyme (forgot the fresh stuff) and did use the heavy cream, which I think improved the potatoes. The beef tenderloin was worth the expense, as was the shiraz.

I made this dish for a dinner party and got nothing but rave reviews. The potato rissoto was delicious. Cutting the potatoes into 1/8 inch cubes was a bit time consuming, a mandolin slicer would have come in handy for this task. But all in all, this was a great dish and I would definately make it again. My husband ate the leftover potatoes for lunch the next day and said they were even better then. So making a day ahead is a great idea.

My husband loved these potatoes! I thought they were good and unique enough that I would make them again for company. They really do hold well which is a plus for a company meal. I made them on Sunday and when my planned guest cancelled, I refrigerated them, reheated and served on Monday - perfect! I will definitely make them again with 2 modifications 1) milk or more chickn broth instead of heavy cream; they are creamy enough as is and just need added liquid, not fat. 2) slightly less cayenne pepper. They were delish but a little hot even for spice lovers. Great new way to serve spuds!

I second what everyone else said...mostly. I personally found the potatoes just a tiny bit bland, so I added some garlic to them towards the end (I'm also a bit of a garlic nut). This could be due to the fact I eye-balled a pound of the potatoes and may have over-shot the amount. I also used dried instead of fresh chives because my local store was out, but they worked wonderfully! Great recipe, really hearty and satisfying! Yum!

I agree with the other 2 reviewers - these potatoes are freaking awesome! They smelled so good as I was cooking them that I almost stopped in the middle and just made fried potatoes, but I am so glad I didn't.

I agree with the first reviewer. The risotto was delicious--a fancy but easy way to complement a nice meat roast and a great wintery side dish.

This risotto was phenomenal, it was simple and the flavour was 4-fork worthy. I didn't have chives so I substituted flat-leaf parsley instead. It didn't overpower the beef and was a perfect accompaniment.
