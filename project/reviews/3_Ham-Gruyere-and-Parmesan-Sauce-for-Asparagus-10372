Good! But I actually used it as a pasta sauce, with no ham. I'm making it again for sure, next time I'll do it again as a pasta sauce but include some asparagus and maybe zucchini in with the recipe. maybe pancetta too??

It's a nice little side dish. I used bacon instead of ham. Next time, I would try it as a gratin...

I made this without the ham and it was really very good. I am relatively new to cooking though, and I wonder if anyone thinks you could make this a day ahead of time and just heat it the next day?
