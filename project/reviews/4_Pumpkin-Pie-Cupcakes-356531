These were great muffin/cupcake hybrids. I served them at a mid-morning meeting today and got lots of compliments. the muffins were soft and moist and flavorful and the topping was an awesome alternative to straight-up frosting. I quadrupled the batch with made 15 regular-sized muffins. Luckily the conversions were easy!

It was a good tasting dessert. My mom and I put frosting and a little bit of lemon zest, and we made some without any frosting or lemon zest. The cupcakes with frosting were better, and my family loved it!!!

These were great --a wonderful fall birthday treat. I added more spices than the recipe calls for (including allspice, cloves, ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg), and doubled the recipe to make a dozen regular size cupcakes. I would probably triple the recipe next time, as doubling was just enough to make rather small cakes. I topped with cream cheese frosting made with cinnamon. Yum!

These were a HIT!! My kids gobbled them up. I did six times the recipe and made ~32 regular muffins. In a family of 6, it didn't take long for them all to disappear.

I'm confused--it says that this makes 8 servings of mini muffins. My mini muffin tin holds 12. Is a serving 1 mini muffin or 2? The picture makes it look like a regular sized muffin.

Moist! Very tasty, I just wished the pumpkin flavor was a little stronger? But my two girls, age 3 and 1 loved them. Loved that they are HEALTHY.

Good but not worth repeating.

These were very bland if you follow the recipe exactly. They were however very moist. If I made this recipe again, I would double the amount of spices and also add more sugar.

I quadrupled this recipe. Who turns on the oven to make 6 small cupcakes? These are good and I would make them again but I would make even more and freeze them.

These are delicious! And the frosting is divine. I did not use ginger because of my preference. I also doubled the recipe to make a dozen regular-sized cupcakes and baked for 18-20 minutes. I tried adding about 1 1/2 tbsp canned pumpkin to the frosting as well, which made it thinner, but the taste is amazing! I will be making these a million times over during the holidays!

I quadrupled this recipe and made two dozen regular sized cupcakes. The only change I made was to use 3 whole eggs instead of 4 egg whites and the cupcakes turned out perfectly! Everyone loved them and I will definitely make them again!!

Very, very good. The kids loved them, and they're healthier than other baked good treats. Although the lemon peal looked nice on top of the cupcakes - the kids didn't like the taste of them so I'd leave them off the next time. It was more work to make them as mini cupcakes (v. regular cupcakes).

Absolutely one of the best desserts I have made in a long time. Fabulous texture and perfect frosting! I did use pumpkin pie spice as opposed to the listed spices and it was fine.

This was really yummy. Next time I am going to make a double batch because it made 6 regular size cupcakes. I did increase the sugar to just under 2/3 cup and added a bit more pumpkin. Also on the frosting, I omitted the margarine and substituted sour cream for the plain yogurt (because that's what I had on hand). My kids were asking for more!

This recipe is delicious! I did make some changes: instead of all those spices combined. I put 2t. Pumpkin pie spice, it's basically a combination of all the spices in the recipe as well. Then I used 2/3C. plus 2T. sugar instead of just 1/4 and it was perfect. Enjoy, they are delicious cupcakes, light and fluffy.

I added more pumpkin and cinnamon than what was called for and just kept tasting the batter until I found a strong enough taste. I also added more sugar so it wouldn't taste more like a bread. This is my absolute favorite! I don't even like pumpkin pie and I love these cupcakes :]

This is another way of introducing vegetable to kids in a yummy way :) This could also be served during a children's party too. With yogurt as the topping now that is an added treat :) Healthy and fancy looking cupcake :)

The consistency was perfect but know in advance that these are not sweet (almost tasted like a bread)so the frosting is a must. I would add more of the spices since the pumpkin taste was very weak.
