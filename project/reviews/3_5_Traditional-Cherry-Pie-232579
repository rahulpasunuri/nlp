Simple to prepare and received raves for this cherry pie. I chose to use frozen cherries. I think it could have used one more bag for a total of 4-12oz bags of frozen cherries. It was even better the next day, so talking about possible changes for next time seems odd. Changes I may make next time is to add a bit more sugar to cherries, and taste filling before baking to be sure. And add a bit of sugar to crust.

this was the first time I had ever made a homemade from scratch pie crust and 4 people told me it was delicious. I used tart cherries and it seemed perfect to me.(and others)

I did make a few (very) minor changes when I made this tonight. I made mini-pies instead if a regular pie using 4 inch tart shells. The filling made 5 of these and I had enough dough left to make 3 more had I more filling. (I did make a 6th mini-pie using the last bit of the filling liquid with some fruit puree I'm making jam from tomorrow. With the cornstarch the puree filling seems to have set just fine. I can't wait to try it.) I did not find the dough difficult to handle. I added orange zest (1/2 or 3/4 of a large one) and a good splash of almond extract. It was terrific. Due to the smaller size I baked it for about 25 mintues. Once totally cooled they easily came out of the tart shells. The cherries I bought at the farmer's market were pretty tart--it had a very good sweet/tart balance in the end.

I used a different pastry recipe, one that used a little less butter and a little more vegetable shortening; it was easy to work with. I made the pie with frozen sour cherries from a trip to northern Michigan, and it was a real hit with my family. I did add a few drops of pure almond extract. The recipe was simple, and I'm glad I have more bags of these wonderful cherries.

Delicious and very easy. Easy crust to make (I did it in my tiny Cuisinart chopper/grinder). I used sweet cherries and they were fine in the pie.

This pie crust was ridiculously difficult to manipulate. I followed the recipe to the letter but would have chilled it longer had I known it would be such a bear to work with. As I write this, it is baking, so I cannot attest to the taste just yet. But at first blush, I'd say there are probably better recipes out there.
