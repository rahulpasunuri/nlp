The chicken and pesto combination is quite tasty. Definitely agree with the other reviewers with spreading the pesto under the breast and thigh skin. The one reason I didn't give it four stars was the that I wasn't a fan of the potato portion of the dish. While it tasted good, it was entirely too fatty. Even with trying to skim off the grease from the sauce, it still was overwhelmingly oily. Next time, I'll probably cook the potatoes separately -- or have a rack inside the roasting pan to allow the potatoes to be boasted by the dripping juices, but not stay swimming in the oil mixture.

I did something a little different than everyone else. I was only cooking for me so I used two chicken breasts and did what my mom used to do. Put them in a glass roast dish (sprayed with olive oil). Spread the pesto over both breasts. Cut up red potatoes and carrots and spread them around the dish with some sprinkled pesto on them too. Then I added about 1/2 to 3/4 inches of water and baked for about 40 minutes. It was pretty good. Super easy and quick since I already had pesto in the freezer. I meant to sprinkle parmesan over the top on the last 5 min but forgot.

I've made this several times over the years. Delicious! The pesto (especially when under the skin) keeps the chicken amazingly moist. I stir in some whole garlic cloves with the postatoes. This time I used a combination of russet and red potatoes because that's what I had on hand. The reds were all tender after the 1.5 hours my smaller chicken needed; the russets not at all. That may explain some of the mixed results from other reviewers. I'm planning to use the carcass (& the russets) in the summer minestrone soup on this website (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/fo od/views/Summer-Minestrone-with- Pesto-109775)

Very nice, simple recipe. I used homemade pesto and cooked the chicken at 425 for about 50 minutes, until the thigh temp reached about 165, and then let it rest for 10 minutes. Next time, I would probably use the pesto only for the potatoes and do a simple compound herb butter on the chicken, as the pesto flavor wasn't very pronouced on the chicken.

This was so easy and came out great. I took the advice from the previous cook from Medina, WA by adding cream and cornstarch to the sauce - thanks (I love cream in everything)! However, I did keep the potatoes in the same pan and they came out great. My husband who is not a big roast chicken fan really loved this too.

I have made this recipe several times on busy Sundays when there wasn't much time to cook. Salt the chicken and potatoes. I cook the potatoes in a separate pan so that they don't cook directly in the grease from the chicken and that also helps them cook faster. Add heavy cream to the sauce and thicken with cornstarch. The chicken is delicious cold.

Great! This was originally published in the "Too Busy To Cook" section of Bon Appetit so it was the perfect thing to make while washing windows. It was so easy and turned out moist and delicious!

Easy and delicious- chicken was very moist. I used prepared pesto and 8 cloves of garlic and regular russet potatoes. I will add onions too next time.

Wow. Yum! This was very easy and yielded a beautifully roasted chicken with amazing potatos. I had small reds and they were cooked and crispy at 1 hr 20. Only change I'd suggest is to add more garlic in bigger pieces-- it roasts nicely and adds good flavor.

This was incredibly easy and delicious! I used homemade pesto, and rubbed it under the skin as recommended by others. The chicken was moist and flavorful, and the potatoes were dark, crispy and hard to stop eating! For skeptics, I found the potatoes and chicken not to taste specifically like pesto after cooking--they just tasted flavorful and scrumptious

This is a crowd pleaser. I doubled for a family get together and everyone raved. It is very easy to prepare and the entire dish is so flavorful. The pesto really makes the potatoes taste wonderful.

2nd time to make this. Its fail safe! i upped the pesto by a few extra tablespoons here and there and used 5 garlic cloves a bit and it came out great. it did take longer than an hour and 20 minutes, it took about an hour and 45 minutes in my oven.

With so many other great roasted chicken recipes out there, I won't make this again. The pesto was not as pronounced in the cooked product as I had anticipated. The dish cried for salt. The potatoes did not brown despite being in the oven over an hour. The oil was no problem, as I lifted the potatoes out of the broth and fat and plated them separately. The dish was not bad, just not particularly good.

Really tasty - but SO much oil. The potatoes were especially delicious.

I made my own pesto as I have some prolific basil plants outside. I think if you use a really good pesto this recipe is a "no fail" sort of thing. I also rubbed the pesto under the skin as no one eats the skin anyway. There was a lot of fat drippings in the pan which the potatoes bake in so just enjoy and don't think of the calories! It's a very good recipe.

This recipe is very good and very easy! The first words out of my boyfriends mouth were "this is a make again". I used yukon gold potatos and they were great. It did take longer than 1hour and 20 minutes to roast.

This was a wonderful fall/winter meal. We used our home made pesto and it was so flavorfull! The potatoes were the best. It took longer than the lhour 20 min. in our oven. We will definitly make this again.

Very easy. I have made twice. The first exactly as the recipe directed (3 forks), the second time I put a couple tablespoos of the pesto between the skin and the meat (4+ forks!). The flavor of the pesto really permeates the meat and keeps the breast very moist and tender.

Simple and even better if you make your own pesto, which is one of the easiest things to do. Since there's only the two of us, I use a small fryer chicken (3/12 lbs or so). Leftovers are fantasic in salads and sandwiches.

This dish got rave reviews from my husband. It was so easy & delicious on a cold winter night. I thickened the sauce a little with a cornstarch & water mixture.

My date and I liked this very much. I thought having more pesto in the sauce would overwhelm the flavour of the chicken and the potatoes but actually the more sauce I laid on the better. I served it with steamed broccoli and a very cold Pinot Grigio went perfectly. And of course, it was delicious reheated the next day.

I don't use as much pesto as they recommend and do put it under the skin as well as on top, but I think it is a foolproof classic. All family members like it, moist and tasty. Good with risotto for a potato alternative.

This recipe was very yummy. The pesto smelled so good and the chicken was so moist. Rubbing the pesto under the skin was a GREAT tip!!!!

I followed other reviewers' advice and put pesto under the skin as well as on the outside. Wonerful! I stood the chicken upright and the skin was crisp and delicious and the meat was the most tender I've ever tasted. Next day it made sandwiches which far outshone my former favorite cold roasted chicken.

This was very good! I had some basil in the freezer, added garlic and olive oil, (poof instant pesto).. put it under the skin and all over the top, the chicken came out nice and crisp. When the chicken finished, i drained all of the juices into a small sauce pan, defatted it and added a mix of 1 TBS corn starch and 2 TBS Water, added salt and pepper, it made a great gravy for the chicken! my family hates chicken but really liked this recipie!

After reading the reviews, I decided to put most of the pesto mixture under the chicken skin, after loosening it, rather than on top. The meat was succulent and highly flavored. A satisfying main dish.

when done scrape off the good wasted pesto and then pull off the soggy and greasy skin and enjoy the moist chicken. dont bother to use the good leftovers and bones for stock or soup..

It was good I did not use the chicken broth. USed alot of while cloves of garlic in with the veggies. Use either a very good purchased pesto or homemade

Delicious and easy!! I used 10 oz. of pesto and added another garlic clove. Also thickened the broth to make it more like a gravy to serve over the chicken/potatoes. It was a big hit with my meat and potato lovers!

VERY GOOD & EASY! Next time I will season my chicken with salt & pepper first for a bit more flavor. I will also use more pesto. After de-fatting the drippings, I reduced them by half and added heavy cream for the sauce...sort of a pesto cream. It was DELICIOUS. I will be making this for company, as it is a dish you can be proud to serve, also takes so little prep work!

This was tastey and easy to make. I used yukon gold potatoes, next time I will add some more veggies. The pesto crisped the chicken and the potatoes up nicely and gave everything good flavor. I thickened the sauce up just a little with some flour. This is one I'll be making over and over.

This recipe was a disappointment...very bland with an odd aftertaste. I used my own pesto as I have yet to discover a decent store-bought pesto. All in all, it was a waste of good pesto.

I used potatoes and carrots and my own frozen pesto. It was good, rich - read not low-fat, and very tasty.

Delicious! I substituted Sun Dried Tomato Pesto. Also increased the Pesto to about 10 ounces and an extra clove of garlic so I'd have plenty leftover to coat the vegetables. Vegetables used were finger potatoes, shallots and carrots and they were placed on the roasting rack with the chicken. Careful not to overcook them though. I put them in the oven with 45 minutes remaining. And the sauce is perfect over a side of stuffing and steamed broccoli.

I thought that this was very easy to prepare and delicious. My husband wasn't a big fan but I thought it was tasty and great cold. Next time I would add more pesto to give it a little more flavor. I used small yukon potatoes whole and they tasted great with the pesto. I put the potatoes in at the beginning and they cooked with the chicken the whole time.

My family enjoyed how moist this chicken recipe turns out. The suggestion of different veggies works well, too. Only, depending on the veggie, add them later rather than with the potatoes. It is a moist bird, in part, because it is so greasy. The pesto taste was minimal once everything was done. There are better ways to use pesto.

Rating: 4
absolutely wonderful! very easy and an incredible outcome. i substituted a boneless breast of turkey because that is what i had and also added small onions and carrots in with the potatoes. i was worried about it being too pesto-y but everything had great flavor and the pesto crisped up very nicely.

I've made this recipe several times, passed it on to friends, who also give it rave reviews. Other veggies can be used roasted with the potatos' This is sensational easy and wonderful.

Usually preparing chicken is pretty labor intensive but this recipe requires no prep work. The pesto added a nice crispness to the skin and kept the meat very moist. It is a keeper.
