I found that the fava beans (and the potatoes, onion and carrots) were plenty soft after only 1 hour of simmering. This dish made a nice accompaniment for grilled halibut.

We love fava beans and dandelion greens. This combination is terrific.

We love both fava beans and dandelion greens in almost any guise. This simple recipe puts them together in a tasty dish that works as a main dish or starter. I do agree with others that the dandelion greens need to be chopped a bit, however. My co-cook insists on blanching them first, I prefer them unblanched. It's a matter of taste. Also, since parsnips seem to be the new carrots, replacing the carrot with parsnip gives a slightly sharper flavor that we find very pleasant.

I was a little disappointed that the fava bean flavor was not more evident in the puree. Additionally, the puree itself was very bland. Maybe the cheese and red pepper should be added directly into the puree. The dandelion greens need to be cut up more too. I am interested to hear what other think but there might be a reason I was first to review.
