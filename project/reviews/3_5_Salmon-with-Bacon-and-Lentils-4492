The lentils were very, very good...I would serve those on their own for a nice vegetarian meal. I had the same problem with the salmon and lack of flavor - farm raised was all I could find. I'll definitely make the lentils again but might pair them with lamb chops or pork tenderloin instead.

My husband and I really enjoyed this one... I basted the salmon with maple syrup before wrapping it in bacon, and then I drizzled a teensy bit on top of the bacon for some caramelization. It was delicious and I think that the maple really complimented the bacon/salmon conbo without complicating it.

Very nice. I think the reason other's lentils didn't get soft is that the directions do not tell you that once you turn the lentils down to a simmer you need to PUT A LID ON IT! I unfortunately followed the recipe exactly and had the same problem. I added more water since it had evaporated, covered it and then completed the recipe.

This is an excellent recipe. The lentils are delicious, and you can't go wrong with bacon wrapped anything. Follow the lentil recipe exactly, and it will exceed your expectations!

Delicious and easy ... I added a scant tablespoon of Madras curry powder to the lentils, which really bolstered the complexity of the dish. Yum!

Here's a great tip: Instead of wrapping the fish in bacon, cut the bacon into 1/4 inch pieces and cook it in a frying pan until crisp. Reserve the bacon fat in a pyrex dish, then brush the salmon with the bacon fat before cooking it. Add the cooked bacon pieces to the lentil mixture while boiling (to add extra flavor) or after (to have the texture of crisp bacon mixed in the the lentils). Trust me -- it's a winner, and it's easier.

I thought I followed this recipe exactly as written, but I must have done something wrong. The lentils were tasteless, and still crunchy (even though I cooked them much longer than called for), and the bacon was still limp--even though I precooked it, as one reviewer recommended. Still, I love the idea of all these ingredients together. How can I make it right?

Well, beyond compare might be a slight exageration, but this is pretty darn good. First of all, you HAVE to use real wild salmon. Not only does the farm-raised stuff lack flavor, it lacks texture and is bad for the environment. So if you can't get wild, forget about it until you can. I fry the bacon until brown and crumble it to add to the lentils along with the tarragon and chives, along with a splash of cream. I fry the salmon in a hot pan with a bit of olive oil about 3 minutes per side so it is still pink inside and serve this over the lentils. All the flavors are there without flabby bacon. Perfect with a Pinot!

To clear up what I wrote below, the pesillade went over the salmon and then wrapped by the prosciutto. What I wrote was not at all clear.

I, too, used prosciutto and it was lovely and crisp. In order to counter the complaints of low flavour in the salmon, I seasoned liberally with sea salt and made a persillade of chopped parsley and orange zest to bring out the orange in the lentils. It was fabulous this way and very flavourful! I certainly recommend it. The lentils were excellent also. Very nice and surprisingly quick dish to get going on a weekday.

Salmon and lentils are such a hot combination and I never get tired of it! I, too, used prosciutto and I'm still not sure how much I liked that addition but the dish was delicious. The lentils were awesome (even better leftover). And as far as the salmon being dull I think that's another issue of salmon being so mass produced these days. I was lucky enough to score some wild Alaskan with tons of natural flavor, thank you Trader Joe!!

The secret in the salmon preparation is to fry the bacon to about its 3/4 doneness and still pliable. This gives the bacon flavor which enhances the salmon during the baking. The lentils couldn't be improved as they are just absolutely delicious. You know when the guests call you the next day to ask how you prepared the dish it was a hit. THIS IS DEFINITELY A DISH WORTH REPEATING!!!

Used prosciutto and it turend out wonderfull, would definitely make this again for company. Lentils are delicous too, though I used too much cooking liquid. Served it with an Austrian chardonnay (Chardonnay 2002 Sonnenberg, Kollwentz, Burgenland) which complimented the food perfectly.

Basic concept is great but try marinating the salmon in a little balsamic vinegar, olive oil,orange zest, black pepper and tarragon for 2-3 hours. Then proceed using prosciutto (domestic ok) instead of bacon. The salmon will be moist and very flavorful and the lentils subtle and creamy. Rave reviews from my guests!

The lentils were flavourful but the salmon definitely needs to be seasoned with salt and freshly ground pepper before cooking. Also, pancetta or prosciutto would be a better choice than ordinary bacon.

Liked this dish as a rather unusual way to serve salmon.Lentils were outstanding, but I have to agree that salmon part of recipe needs to be worked on a bit further.

We really enjoyed this dish--always trying to find tasty ways to serve lentils, and they were absolutely fabulous! The salmon, however, was uninspired. The bacon didn't really cook up, and that was part of the problem. But it's definitely worth tinkering with again.
