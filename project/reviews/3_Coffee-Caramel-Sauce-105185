Haven't made this one, but for a wonderful thick caramel coffee sauce, try the one found under "Coffee Toffee Sundaes."

This sauce was delicious, although it came out very thin, not thick like caramel sauce should be. I think the 1 c. of water/espresso liquid is way too much. I'm very curious about others' luck with the recipe.
