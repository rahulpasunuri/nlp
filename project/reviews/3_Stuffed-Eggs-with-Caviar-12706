While the egg mixture wasn't what i was expecting (seasoning) the addition of the Caviar was decadent... I made a few substitutions in the second batch.. 3 tablespoons mayo, 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard, minced garlic and dehydrated onion to taste, 1/4 pound of salad shrimp, mix it all together , stuff the eggs using a small spoon, slightly indent the tops and spoon the Caviar on .....darn thats good!
