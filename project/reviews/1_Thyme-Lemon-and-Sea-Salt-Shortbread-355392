I would never call this a cookie - I think that things might be missing from this recipe (for instance, any sugar). I could barely taste the thyme and could not taste any lemon at all when I made this as an experiment in my pastry class. There are multiple things I would do to fix this recipe - more lemon, more thyme, and some sort of sweetness to balance the salt.

These cookies aren't good. I might try them again but with twice the lemon and thyme, less flour and i would bake for about half as long.

Meh. These are pretty lack-luster shortbreads. The sea salt is so strong when you sprinkle as much as they ask for, you can't even tell that there is any lemon in them. Also, the recipe asks for water but doesn't specify how much. 1tbsp is not enough. Mine came out dry and cracked. Not a very helpful recipe and lots of effort for mediocre cookies.
