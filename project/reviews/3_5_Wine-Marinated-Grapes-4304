We serve home-made pizza as an entree often, and grapes are a great appetizer - this is an easy and nice shift from just grapes. Plus, the wine keeps the grapes in great shape for many days afterwards. The sugar is a nice add-on, but not necessary.

Delicious and easy - what more could you ask for? I used concord and red grapes and they were not only visually appealing but delicious as well.

I thought this was a very nice, refreshing accompaniment to an appetizer plate, and very easy and fast to make. I added a little bit of chopped fresh rosemary and omitted the additional sugar at the end as I thought they were sweet enough already. All my guests really liked them; they will definitely become part of my "usuals"!

This was a hit at a recent dinner. Very delicious, crisp and just-right! And best of all, very easy to make!

These are delicious and refreshing. We freeze them in the summer, excellent in champagne.
