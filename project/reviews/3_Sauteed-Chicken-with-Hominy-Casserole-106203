I just stumbled onto this recipe on this site. Ive been preparing this recipe for years and Im appalled by the reviews. Has the jar-opening American publics palates been conditioned to the point that there is no longer any appreciation for the subtleties of flavor. Edna Lewis is a Goddess when it comes to the nuances of flavor. Here she has created a medley of hominy, mushrooms, carrots and chicken where the thyme soars into a crescendo of herbal goodness. I make this dish often in the winter and its one of my favorite comfort meals always receiving rave reviews. To describe this dish as bland is the same to me as describing the Pacific Ocean as wet.

I was incredibly disappointed with this dish and totally agree with the reviewer who said it was bland...though I would have to say it was almost devoid of flavor. I tried "saving" it by adding more herbs, chicken broth at the end, and more and was not able to serve it. I love hominy, but this recipe just was a total failure even with the additional enhancements I tried.

It was too easy to be any good - just too bland.

we usually make dishes more heavily spiced, but this was subtley DELICIOUS! We usually have hominy only in New Mexican dishes (like Pozole) - this was a nice alternative - the hominy simply melded/absorbed all the flavors....MAKE THIS ONE - its simple and very tasty.
