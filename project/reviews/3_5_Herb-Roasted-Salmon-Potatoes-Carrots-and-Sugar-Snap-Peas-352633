The toasted coriander elevated this dish from a nice, expected salmon to something unusual and lovely. I did have to wade through the recipe to figure out that I could make the sauce during oven time - but the tip about putting vegetables in first and then salmon redeemed that flaw. I also wish I'd made more marinade for the salmon cause it could have used a little extra oomph. But the yogurt sauce (I too used Greek yogurt and extra garlic) was top notch. Everything timed out perfectly - and I did not have mint, potatoes or snap peas, but did have fresh dill (I think this is a must), tricolor carrots (halved lengthwise and then quartered) and green beans (steamed) which, together with the wild-red salmon, made a beautiful fresh-looking plate.

This was a good use for my abundant mint, but all in all it just wasn't that tasty. I upped all the herbs and the garlic, as I always do. The concept was good. I agree the recipee is confusing, and I did use an earlier review to save steps. Note that the snap peas can be marindaded with the salmon - but they are cooked with the vegetables. I probably cooked the salmon a minute or 2 too long so it didn't save the dish. I served the leftovers room temp and that was pretty good.

I've made this twice, and yes it's a little time consuming, but it's very good and GREAT for entertaining. You have your dish and sides all in one and it's great for a good five pieces of fish. Unfortunately, the recipe is poorly written so read it carefully and make a PLAN. Here's what I figured out last night. Make the herb mixture and set aside. Then make the lemon, oil, garlic marinade, and DOUBLE it or triple it, because they tell you to make more later and too much is not overpowering. You'll put a third on the on the fish, a third on the snap peas (which could be marinated with the fish and not after) and a third in the yogurt sauce. When you're done, put the potatoes and carrots IN the oven(and make as much as you want!). They'll go for 18-20+ minutes. At that point, put fish in the oven, put snap peas WITH the potatoes and carrots and cook everything for 8-10 minutes. You could CERTAINLY grill the fish, I will try that next time. The toasted coriander is awesome, so you could easily increase your seeds. They add flavor and texture. Also, I could NOT find whole milk yogurt, so I used whole Greek yogurt and we were practically licking the bowl. Fresh herbs DO make a difference, even the dill. Excellent for entertaining.

I thought this recipe was way too time consuming and labor intensive.I feel short cuts could have been made by doing things ahead. The yogurt sauce was not very tasty. I added some of the herb mixture to the top of the fish for added flavor. Although the vegetables and fish were good, I would not make this again because of the time element.

We have made this twice--once for just the two of us (made half recipe) and then last night for guests. Both times it was fabulous. The flavors are fresh and interesting and our guests raved. It's a great recipe for a dinner party and it looks beautiful on the plate. My only negative comments--the sauce definitely needed salt, and when I first read through the recipe I thought it was a bit clumsy. It did make sense though and the cooking times worked very well for me.

This was pretty good but, I must say I think the recipe is not very well written or organized. I felt like I wasted a huge amount of time by following the recipe in order, only to realize that I wasted all of this time making the sauce and seasonings for after the dish is cooked that I could have done while it was cooking. I found that the fish and everything took a little longer too cook then described and the whole dinner took much more time to prepare than it at first appeared it would. It is also just hard to understand and should have been better written for being from Bon Appetit. All in all the dish was pretty good but I'm not sure it's worth the effort. I used all fresh ingredients but the yogurt sauce and seasoning really isn't as tasty as it should be for the effort. I would suggest broiling the fish a little bit for flavor and texture at the end.

I forgot to add...Tahini in Finland? I used sesame seeds and toasted them with the coriander seeds, worked fine and the flavour came through.

I didn't make the vegetables, just the salmon and the sauce and I must say, it was pretty excellent. I even admit to not using fresh herbs (I live in Finland...it's cold here and they cost a fortune out of season) but the dried version was still fine. The herb mixture was spot on and, with the onion, the sauce had a great bite. I will definitely do this one again and next time try the veggies.

I was looking for a fresh fish dish to make, and this seemed to fit the bill. Fresh dill, cilantro, mint ... how could one go wrong? This is a good package meal; follow the recipe and all will work out well. WITH A COUPLE OF WARNINGS. First, if you are using small new potatoes instead of super small fingerling potatoes, then you'll need to cook the potatoes longer. So too with the baby carrots. If you are using the super tiny fingerling type carrots, then this time will work. Otherwise if you are using the bagged baby carrots, you'll want to give them a little more time in the oven. In terms of the sauce, I thought it was good, no real complaints on a taste front. But ultimately I felt like I had just slathered on some yogurt onto a nice piece of salmon, making some form of yet-to-be-marketed Salmgourt dish. This was my first experience with tahini; no objections; but not sure what it really added. In short, this dish is fine. Just a little odd, in retrospect, with the concept of the yogurt on the fish.
