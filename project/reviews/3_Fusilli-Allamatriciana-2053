This is a standard recipe I go to again and again. I add extra fresh herbs and spices. I serve with penne and not fusilli.

This is my recipe (actually my Aunt Emma's) published in Bon Appetit in the 90's. It was her favorite quick sauce to make. The original recipe called for salt pork, not bacon but BA felt not enough cooks would have access or know what salt pork was. The traditional recipe called for serving it with Bucatelli pasta and Parmigianno Reggiano cheese. Bon Appetit slightly altered all the recipes I submitted for thier "Too Busy to Cook" section. I just don't want to take the blame for the bacon.

I love this dish. I always use fresh, peeled and chopped roma tomatoes (8-10), pancetta instead of bacon, add 2 cloves of minced garlic, substitute shallots for the onion (if I have them) and as another cook mentioned use romano cheese! Romano cheese is what makes this dish a stand out. I can't imagine using parmesan! I use a combination of red pepper flakes and freshly ground black pepper in place of the cayenne. Also Bucatelli or spaghetti are better pasta choices than fusilli. As for the bacon/pancetta becoming soggy it needs to be chopped really fine, minced really. It should almost disappear into the sauce.

Pancetta instead of bacon and shallots instead of onion is needed for this pasta sauce. Bacon is too strong and smokey of a flavor and shallots have a more distinct flavor than onion. Lots of thinly sliced garlic and crushed red pepper are in order here also. I have on occasion added clams in the shell at the last minute, yes I know that is not true Amatriciana but it works!

Have made this twice. Liked it both times. The bacon gives the dish a very strong flavor.

Great for a quick mid-week dinner...So much better than opening a jar of Prego! The sauce get a very smoky, hearty flavor, but is not overly heavy. I used spaghetti in place of fusili, and will add mushrooms next time I make this for a chunkier sauce.

Simple hearty supper, perfect with a salad and crusty bread. Easy, too. Used lardons - the standard here. May try pancetta next time.

I love this recipe! It's one of our all time favorites. I've been making it for years. It tastes even better if you make it and freeze - sauce seems thicker. When out of white wine, I have substituted chicken broth and the sauce is still delicious. I also make sure I fry the bacon until it is almost crispy and done before adding the other ingredients. Excellent!!

To me, the amatriciana sauce equals the use of pecorino cheese, quite different from parmesan - this is really essential. bacon, onion and tomatoes as in this recipe, but add some white wine and grated pecorino to the sauce, let simmer fo 1/2 hour, and preferrably serve with bucatini. serve w/ grated pecorino.

All in all a very good recipe that is similar to another recipe that I use. However, I would suggest a few changes that I think help. Instead of bacon, use black forest ham (or some other type of smoked ham), sliced and cut in small squares. Also, I add about 1 tsp sugar and half of the tomato juice rather than all of it. Finally, I prefer to use red wine to add a little more heartiness.

very flavorful. i like to microwave the bacon between 2 sheets of paper towel for 4-5 minutes and throw in at the end. the paper towel absorbs the fat, and the bacon crisps nicely. the result is a less fatty and soggy pasta.

Let's be honest here: the bacon DOES get SOGGY!Next time I will fry the bacon, or pancetta and put it in sauce at the very end, so it stays crispy. Otherwise, great tasting sauce!

Pretty good, and big points for being so easy, but I don't like the way that the bacon gets soggy. Maybe it would be better with prosciutto?

This recipe was simple to prepare and my four-yr. old son (who tends to be picky)really liked this recipe. I will definitely make this recipe again!

I have made this four times now, most recently without wine. Instead, I used white grape juice plus a tablespoon of rice vinegar. You can replace red wine with purple grape juice plus a tablespoon of strong tea and a tablespoon of rice vinegar.

My boyfriend (Italian) requests this dish repeatedly ... it's simple but very good. Great weeknight dinner solution.

we love this recipe! I make double the recipe and freeze it for lunches. Would not change a thing.

I have enjoyed Pasta Amatriciana made my various chefs. The ingredients are almost the same, except most chefs use Pancetta instead of bacon. The addition of white wine is a plus. I am surprised to learn that the "official" version from the town of Amatrice does not include onions. I was told onions are a "must".

This was a simple and delicious recipe. The smokiness of the bacon makes the dish come alive. This is a keeper!

A decent tomato sauce, however incorrectly labeled as "amatriciana". Amatriciana does not contain onion nor wine. Bacon has been accepted as a reasonable sub for guanciale. The original recipe is officially registered by the city of Amatrice, Italy.
