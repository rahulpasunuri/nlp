Meh. I'm an ovo-vegetarian, and after reading the reviews, decided to use, er, mocha mix instead of tofu (it's what I had in the fridge). Anyway, it was okay. I won't make it again with mocha mix, although I used to be a fan of Stroganoff, so maybe I'll keep futzing with it until it's better.

I used real sour cream as one reviewer suggested. It was really just OK. Edible, but nothing great and didn't taste like stroganoff. With the sour cream, the tangy element the lemon adds to the silken tofu is unnecessary and made the dish taste fruity rather than rich and creamy.

What a waste of mushrooms. Very bland ad boring. A horrible rendition of a stroganoff recipe. Will never make again.

Ignore the silken tofu - don't go there. You're American and have a 60% chance (statistically) of being overweight, so just go and get that 12 ounces of real-deal sour cream. For the liquid added to the mushrooms - use white wine, great pairing instead of veggie stock. Upped the lemon juice to about double with 2/3rds of a fresh lemon and used butter instead of processed veggie oil. Will definitely make this one again. Took about 25 minutes from start to finish and it was a great autumn comfort food.

Made this recipe without the tofu, was just fine. I just used a butter/flour roux to tighten the stroganoff. To freshen the dish, we added the juice of one lemon and about a tsp. or the zest. It really brightens this heavier dish. Good!

Like any first time using a recipe, I followed the recipe according to the instructions. Considering that I come from the land of health nuts (Berkeley), I ventured into this healthy world of silken tofu - never again will I try this recipe again. First and foremost, it was the most visually unappealing sight i have seen in my kitchen thus far. But, I am not one to quickly judge a book by its character, so I attempted to taste the food, not once but multiple spoonfulls. The texture is completely distracting, the lack of taste is appalling, and the time that it took to clean each mushroom to ensure a clean tasting meal feels like my time went to wast. I would NEVER recommend this recipe EVER AGAIN.

This may have been user error, but I followed the recipe pretty closely and it was terrible. We threw most of it in the trash.

Made this recipe for vegetarian friends. Thought my children wouldn't like it with the soy replacement instead of sour cream but they really liked it! Would definitely make again.

So good! I loved beef stroganoff when I ate meat, but it was one of the dishes that upset my stomach most (ultimately, why I became a vegetarian). This doesn't include cream, so it's totally vegan friendly and amazingly good. I added a handful of finely chopped cashews into the Cuisinart when I whipped up the tofu, and it added a nice extra flavor. I will be making this regularly. Woot!

This was great. I've already made it twice in two weeks. It's a simple, fast, and healthy take on my mom's stroganoff. Sorry to the vegetarians out there, but I used beef stock instead of wine.
