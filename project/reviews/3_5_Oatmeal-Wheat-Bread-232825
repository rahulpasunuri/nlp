This is very tasty and makes great french toast. The crumb isn't too hard which is great. However, it didn't rise as high as I would like. I will retry; it was most likely something I did.

Made this bread today for the 1st time and cut the recipe in half for 1 loaf. I used Splenda brown sugar instead of honey - used about 1/8 cup with a little half and half; other then that I followed the recipe exactly. I used a stone loaf pan. The bread came out very nice, slightly moist, with a great taste. Definately a keeper. So great to have a way to make a nice bread and know exactly what is in it, nothing you can't pronounce.

So here's the thing...bread should contain simple, healthy ingredients and should be a joy to make. Further, the baker should be rewarded by a quality finished products that is pleasing to all who partake. This bread fits the bill. Excellent consistency and very yummy!

This was my first time making bread. I chose this one because it looked relatively simple - YUM! I loved this! I did everything exactly as the recipe said. Tastes so much better than purchased wheat bread from the grocery store. I will make again!!

My 1st attempt at making bread. I chose this one because it looked simple and easy. So okay I didn't have honey, but I substituted molasses instead. The result for my 1st time....simply delicious. It was sweet, not dry, and wonderful toasted. It's a keeper.

So easy! I love making homemade bread, but I do not have the time for kneading. Instead, I make it in my KitchenAid mixer with dough attachment. I followed the recipe with the following changes suggested by other reviewers and/or because of the ingredients I had on hand. -I used 1% milk. -I used 1 cup rye flour and 2 cups WW flour, 2 T flax, and about 1/2 cup AP flour. -I used half molasses and half heather honey. -I just put the butter into the warm milk/oatmeal mixture to save a step. The egg wash helps the oats to stick to the bread, and it makes a pretty finish. You can also brush with milk and top with oats if you are watching your cholesterol. Great bread for novice and experienced bakers!

Very good. Made one loaf as written and the second with a cinnamon swirl. Both delicious!

I am not rating this recipe as I made a crucial mistake that I hope was the reason why my bread didn't turn out good. I didn't have loaf pans and thought they would be okay shaped and plopped on a cookie tray but no. They are completely flat and sad looking. So just in case you're considering making this bread w/o loaf pans, don't do it! I'll try it again some time though as I love the ingredients...

I had to add a fair amount of additional flour to get the bread to the right consistency, but thought the result was outstanding. Flavor and texture are great.

This is a wonderful recipe, I have baked this bread four to five times and it has been a huge hit each time. I have also tried making it with less salt and honey (reduced each by 1/4) and the bread was still awesome! The perfect combo of sweet and healthy. A nice soft bread with a little bit of a good chew to it. I have to say, I hate to see people leaving really bad reviews when silly things like "the bread didn't rise" happens. Look at all the good reviews, this is a great recipe, something went wrong for you sorry but obviously it was not the recipe. I recommend Bob's Red Mill yeast, works great every time.

Rating: 1
Mine didn't rise at all! My yeast did get foamy so I figured it was still good... But the bread never rose and came out very heavy.

I make this bread on a regular basis and really love it. I have made it by hand and in the stand mixer and seem to get the same great results either way. some reviewers said the bread was sweet but i don't find it to be sweet and often use it for savory sandwiches. I mostly use it for toast though. I highly recommend. Once you make it a few times, the process goes quite quickly so it does not seem like much work at all considering the reward of homemade bread!

Rating: 4
excellent bread recipe. perfect texture with a slightly sweet honey taste. i halved the recipe and since i didnt have oats i used oat bran and stirred that into milk instead and it came out perfect. i had a crappy loaf pan so i took the bread out of it halfway through baking and finished on a cookie sheet, although it took almost an hour to bake thru to 195 internal temp. would definetely make again.

This makes a nice bread for toast, but it's too sweet for sandwiches unless you're making sweet sandwiches. I cut the honey to 1/4 cup and the salt to 2 teaspoons.

Not making bread very often & getting a new Kitchen Aid, it took me a couple tries to get this right. But now that I have, I love this recipe! First time I put too much flour in while kneading and the bread was dry and tough. Once I backed off the flour, it was moist and yummy. I followed one reviewer's advice and made a loaf with port soaked cranberries, orange peel and cinnamon sugar. I also made one with raisins and cinnamon sugar. Both were delicious!

great bread. exceptionally easy to make. rose really well. great for sandwiches or toast. I used 2% milk and made 1/2 the recipe. skipped the egg wash. The bread baked for 35 minutes and was perfectly cooked.

I made this recipe for the first time today and the bread turned out good. Sometimes reading other people's reviews can be harmful to your baking. I baked it for 30 minutes instead of what the recipe called for and the inside was just barely cooked. Those that experienced burning after 25 minutes should have their oven temperature checked. Good for sandwiches and toast.

This recipe is terrific for homemade buns (yields 18 - 24 depending on the size you need.)Try it for your burgers or hot ham and cheese!

Very tasty. I followed the recipe exactly, but only left it in the oven for 25 min. The bread started to get very dark and smoking in the oven at 25 min, so I took it out. The bread wasn't burned, and the inside was fully cooked, but it was DEFINITELY finished in less than 30 min. Tasted great, but I could use a little more flavor. Would give 3.75 forks -- everything else was fantastic.

Very easy and very delicious. I wanted to make a bread that I could have as breakfast and I found it.

Rating: 4
Great and simple recipe-I used 1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons of pure maple syrup as a honey substitute, 6 tablespoons of salted butter, instead of the unsalted, and a tablespoon of kosher salt. The bread was simple to work and knead, and, for a wheat bread, it's real nice, soft, and moist bread. I know that everyone has their own flour, but in this recipe I used King Arthur's whole wheat flour, which is one reason--I think--that this bread came out so moist.

Rating: 4
This recipe is so versatile! I have changed it every way possible and it almost always comes out perfect.. the one time I didn't like it was when I forgot to add honey, but it still had nice texture. My favorite is that I use all whole wheat flour and no AP.. I also omitted the oats just because I didn't have any. I browned the butter with the honey.. I don't know why, but the bread is sooo nummy in flavor, has the softest crumb and lasts for a solid week (if it lasts that long). This is definitely a keeper.

Rating: 0
I knead the bread with oil on table and hands -- I add the yeast to the oats (finely ground) and whole wheat and let it sit for a day -- adds a nice flavor

Rating: 4
Delicious bread--great flavor, fine but not delicate crumb. I love this recipe! I make it every week with the following modifications: instead of 1 cup oats, I use a scant cup of oats and add 1/4 cup of uncooked 9 grain cereal; instead of 1/2 cup honey I use 1/4 cup honey and a bit more than 1/4 cup molasses (Utah is pretty arid, so the extra moisture works great; instead of mixing by hand and kneading by hand, I use my Kitchen Aid Pro600 to mix then knead on speed 2 for a total of 4 minutes.

Rating: 4
Delicious! Also made with all whole wheat flour (as I didn't have a whole cup of all-purpose left) and also swapped a small portion of the honey for molasses (maybe 1/5 of it). Made twice - once with wash and once without - no noticeable difference except visually :) Agree on tenting the last 15-20 mins. Tastes fine without but definitely browns hard core - again really only a visual. Extremely yummy - and full-proof - I had never baked a yeast bread before and my first loaf came out stellar :) Don't plan to ever buy sandwich bread again.

Rating: 4
Wonderful recipe! Moist, tender texture and delightful flavor. Best wheat bread that I have ever made. This will be my standard wheat recipe.

Rating: 4
This was the first sandwich bread recipe I've made and it came out fantastically. The recipe was easily halved. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used 1/4c molasses and 1/4c honey while melting the butter with the milk. I made the first loaf in a 10x5 (approx) loaf pan and it came out fine. I had to add quite a bit of extra flour to the board when kneading as it became fairly sticky. The first time I kneaded it by hand and my KitchenAid. The second time I kneaded fully by hand, but I may avoid doing this in the future if it requires adding too much flour.

Rating: 4
I tried this a month ago and found it to be one of the most successful breads I've ever made! I love the flavor (added a bit more honey - I'm a beekeeper!). I also used a 5-grain cereal I like instead of straight oatmeal, just to get a bit more nutrition. I have been sharing this recipe with everyone I know who will make their own bread. Fast, easy and rewarding.

Rating: 4
Excellent! This recipe is now my standard one for whole wheat bread. I like to use this recipe as a basis for doing something similar to cinnamon raisin bread. I soak craisins in port for a few hours. After the first rise, divide the dough and flatten each half into a rectangle. Top with the soaked craisins, cinnamon, sugar, and orange zest. Roll each half into a loaf and follow the rest of the recipe from the second rise onward. You could also just knead in unsoaked craisins and orange zest instead.

Used this recipe as a re-entry into the world of bread baking after 7 years' absence. Simple recipe, a pleasure to follow, bread turned out beautifully. Will definitely make it again.

Rating: 4
I followed the recipe to a 'tee' with the exception of using skim milk, as I don't keep whole milk on hand. Using the Kitchenaid mixer for the kneading, it was a breeze. Next time I'll experiment with the molasses substitution, and maybe use rye flour. This was exceptional for both toast and sandwiches.

Great bread! I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but I used some of the recommendations from other reviewers (like using molasses, etc). It was my first time baking a yeast bread - it turned out great! I'll definitely try it again!

Rating: 3
A very nice, versatile bread. Made almost exactly as recipe, except used white whole wheat instead of white and used three packets of yeast, having misunderstood the recipe, but no harm done, it rose nicely, was very good texture, good taste, but a bit bland as other reviewers have commented. I don't think I'd want it sweeter, so will try adding a teaspoon more salt next time. There will definitely be a next time--this is superior to supermarket bread in economy and health--no ingredients you can't pronounce and no partially hydrogenated anything.

Rating: 3
If I could give 3.75 stars, I would. This is really delicious, especially warm out of the oven. I made some changes, some based on reviews here: used combination of honey/molasses, but reduced total amount of both to 1/3 cup. Use a combination of flours: 3 c 7 grain, 1 c white whole wheat, 2 c AP flour (maybe needed more flour due to the seven grain? Not sure). I also added 1 TBS gluten, which I probably didn't need. The loaves are VERY large (the dough was 1155 g for each loaf prior to baking); next time I will make 3 loaves. I used 1 cup 2% milk and 1 c whole milk buttermilk; melted the butter with the milk. I also made sure I baked the bread to an internal temp of 195 degrees+. I am anxious to use it for a sandwich or toasted. I will definitely make this again.

I've been making this bread every other weekend since I first reviewed it in October of 2008. Here are my modifications: I use rapid rise yeast and I proof it with 1/2 tsp. sugar. I use 1/4 cup dark molasses and 1/4 cup honey--better flavor than all honey. Like others, I put the butter in with the milk and let it melt while the milk is scalding--why dirty up another pan? I don't cool the milk-butter-oatmeal mixture much. It being warm (80-90 degrees F or so) helps the bread to rise. I don't bother with the crust treatment. This recipe has become a family favorite and will be in my arsenal for years to come. It also makes excellent croutons and breadcrumbs.

Rating: 4
Made this recipe with just a few tweaks: 100% white whole wheat flour instead of a mix of stone ground and white, and added vital wheat gluten; cut down on sweetener to approx. half; and used cream on top of the loaves instead of an egg wash. Since oats can make bread crumbly vs. chewy, I used my KitchenAid to knead a bit longer than I typically would have to really develop the gluten well. Bread turned out incredibly soft, chewy and well-flavored (just not as sweet). Fantastic recipe!

Made this for the second time today and it's delicious. I think I spaced the melted butter, though, and I used only 2 cups of wholemeal flour because that's what I had in the house. It still came out well.

I like this recipe. I used a 7 grain flour instead of whole-wheat flour. It makes a very tasty bread that was easy to make. I used exactly the amount of yeast indicated in the recipe and found no yeasty taste. I will make this again

Rating: 3
yummy, easy to make bread! I realised at the last minute that I was almost out of honey, so I subbed 1/4 cup of brown sugar mixed with the same amount of corn syrup, seemed to work just fine. I also reduced the whole wheat flour a little and increased the white, since my hubby isn't keen on whole wheat, and I think this helped lighten it a little. some reviews said it was bland, so I slightly heaped the spoonful of salt, and it's not bland at all! I think I'll be making this one regularly as a change from the usual white

Rating: 3
I just made this bread for the first time this afternoon, and I have to say that it's nice, but nothing amazing. I agree with the other reviewer who said it doesn't have very much flavour. I followed the recipe very closely - my only changes were to slightly reduce the amount of honey (and it's still plenty sweet!), and use a wash of milk and butter on top of the bread because I didn't have any eggs. I also set the dough to rise in a slow oven of 170, to speed up the rising time (it cut it in half both times). I baked it for 33 minutes, to ensure that it wouldn't be dry, and this was perfect. Next time I'll try baking with another type of flower (such as rye), to see if that gives me a better flavour.

I used maple syrup instead of honey and added the butter to the milk as it was heating to save washing another dish. I also used only whole wheat flour. This bread is good- really moist, sweet and makes great sandwiches and toast.

Rating: 4
Rating this as a healthy, whole wheat sandwich bread it deserves four forks. Comparing it to an artisinal bread or something else might make it rate less (and don't even get me started about the tool who rated it two forks without actually making the recipe). I have 4 kids and try to avoid processed foods, so we go through 2-4 loaves of this a week. It is a phenominal, healthy sandwich bread. One other cavaet is that it needs to be made with the suggestion on two packets of yeast in mind. That is the correct amount for this recipe.

Rating: 1
My other suggestion would be to cut WAY back on the yeast. It will take a bit longer to rise, but will help the flavor out as well.

Rating: 1
This bread is, as the one fork says, "okay". It's not bad, but there is much better on this site and in my own collection. While it is soft and fairly light, there is not a whole lot of flavor. I would add salt, and sweeten it up, with more honey or maybe some barley malt extract. I'll go back to my other recipes.

Rating: 4
A great bread! Just a note to help clarify the yeast issue: the recipe doesn't say USE three packages of yeast. It says it takes 3 packages to get the 2 tablespoons you need for this recipe. One package of yeast = 2 1/4 teaspoons (less than 1 tablespoon). So, you would need two packages + some of the third package to make up the two tablespoons it needs. Three packages = a little over 2 tablespoons of yeast. Yes! It was a little confusing! Perhaps they should have left it at just '2 tablespoons'. I hope this helps. I was a little confused too.

Rating: 0
After reading the previous reviews, I limited my yeast to two packages--but I used rapid rise yeast. The results were the same as if I hadn't used rapid rise-- 2 hours for the first rising and 1 1/2 hours for the second, I think because the dough is so dense. As well, I skipped the egg wash and decorative oatmeal sprinkles, substituting melted butter as a crust treatment in the last 10 minutes of baking under a foil tent. The results were marvelous--a light and flavorful loaf, well worth the effort. This recipe is going in my recipe box as a permanent addition.

I have been making a similar recipe for a few years, but this one is even better. This will be a regular at our home. Regarding the review about the bread falling - I have read that if it rises too long that can happen.

Rating: 3
I successfully halved this recipe, and used quick cook oats with no trouble. My only sadness was that, after carefully rising, the bread became wrathful and shrunk down when I brushed it with the egg wash, leaving it not quite as tall as I would have liked. I am thinking I will make sure that my egg is warm room temperature next time I brush it on, perhaps?

Great Loaf of bread. I am curious about how much a cup of flour weighs in this recipie I used a rough guess of 125 grams, and ended up adding another 125 grams of flour during the kneading process, should I assume 140 grams per cup here????

This is the first time I've made bread in a very long time. It turned out well. I followed the advise of others and decreased the yeast to two packets and used maple syrup instead of honey. When done, the texture was a little crumbly. I'm not sure if that was me or the way it was suppose to be, but it didn't sacrifice on taste. I froze one loaf to use for later. I will make this again with out a doubt.

This was my first time making bread and it came out great! I just used 2 packets of yeast based on other reviews. I also took the advice to tent the bread and use my Kitchen Aid mixer.

I just ate a piece of this wonderful warm bread. I chose to let it rise free-form instead of in a loaf pan. I also used sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, steel-cut oats and sesame seeds in and on the bread. It was WONDERFUL. I think this is a great recipe that can yield different flavors and textures with minor adjustments. I have always thought it strange that someone would give a recipe a low rating (or one at all) after making drastic changes in ingredients or preparation that produced a poor result. This is the first time I have come across a review from a person who DIDN'T EVEN MAKE THE RECIPE - AT ALL! The reviewer who gave this recipe only two forks and chose to enlighten us with her opinions and criticisms without even making the bread is a complete joke. Trust the rest of us who actually tried the recipe and gave 3-4 forks. It is fantastic!

Rating: 3
I think this bread is exceptional, and I make a lot of bread. To simplify the process a bit, I add the butter, honey and salt to the hot milk-oat mixture. I hasten the cooling process by adding 1/2 c cold water to that mixture and then use instant (SAF) yeast and add it directly to that mixture and proceed with the flours. Very similar to King Arthur's oat bread--another good one.

I found this bread recipe to rival the higher end grocery/bakery bread both in looks and tast, with far less sugar and other un-needed ingredients. This will remain a staple in our house, rather than the favorite store brands!

This bread sounds simple and homey, I have to admit, I've not made this specific bread - however, I have made very similar ones, and 2 T. yeast is a LOT. You can probably cut it back twice (using 1 1/2 teaspoons) - the rises might be a little longer, but it will probably be more flavorful (bread-wise), and less alcohol-y from the yeast's CO2 production. I have a recipe that uses 1/4 teaspoon for 2 loaves and takes 3 days!
