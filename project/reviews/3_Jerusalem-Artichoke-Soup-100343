How I deviated from the recipe: I used diced white onion & sauteed it with the garlic in some butter, THEN added the (homemade) stock. I did not peel the chokes or the potatoes, but I bought my chokes direct from the farm so the skins are super thin & tender. I replaced the suggested seasonings with fresh thyme leaves, salt & pepper. Added whole milk instead of cream. Threw in some chopped in-season carrots at the end for color. DEE-LISH!

To the cook from Brooklyn commenting on the rather drab color - like prison food: jeruselum artichokes are notorious for turning a brownish color after they're peeled. This is why it's typically advised to rub a lemon on it and store the pieces in lemon water until all are peeled. Plus, you have to work fast! I make this all the time (my own recipe) and the color is just beautiful! I'm a professional caterer & trained in Paris.

My family loved this soup and has requested it for Thanksgiving. I omitted the cream - it was fine without. And since I was missing a couple of ingredients I improvised: only seasoned it with a touch of salt, marjoram and ginger. Also I used 1# Jerusalem Artichokes, 1.5# potatoes and 3 smallish sweet onions. So delicious!!

Re: the cook with the "after effects" from New York - those symptoms are due to the beneficial inulin fibre in the Jeusalem artichoke - and a symptom that you and your co-sufferers do not consume enough pre- and pro-biotic materials daily. A high fibre, good-bacteria filled diet will take care of that. I nixed the cream (adding more veg broth) and added some sauteed cremini mushrooms to my version - it was delicious especially with a hint of smoked paprika on top.

no one else had the horrible experience of what happens after eating this?? my husband and i were writhing in pain with stomach cramps and bloating. i do not think sunchokes are meant for human consumption! Which seems to have been common knowledge since the 1600's... (from wiki:)"Gerard's Herbal, printed in 1621, quotes the English planter John Goodyer on Jerusalem artichokes: "which way soever they be dressed and eaten, they stir and cause a filthy loathsome stinking wind within the body, thereby causing the belly to be pained and tormented, and are a meat more fit for swine than men."

What's the point? Totally bland, preserved none of the unique flavor or texture of the jerusalem artichokes, and my god, the color--a rather nasty grey-green, like prison food.

This is delicious. I tried some with and some without the cream and decided that it's better without! I also couldn't find any dried savory. Fabulous.

This soup was very nice and mild. I actually pureed only half of it and left the other half chunky. It felt a bit more substantial that way. Also used fat free half and half and it worked fine.

I think this requires a salty chicken stock and then I really like this recipe. You can really taste the yummy delicate flavor of the jerusalem artichokes and the texture is very velvety when pureed in the blender. Next time I might try drizzling with white truffle oil instead of green onion garnish.

Duh, that's why the links to this recipe say to use vegetable broth!!

You can't call something vegetarian if it has CHICKEN in it!!! Substitute vegetable broth for the chicken and then it will be vegetarian.
