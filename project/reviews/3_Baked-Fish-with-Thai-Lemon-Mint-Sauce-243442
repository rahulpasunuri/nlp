I found the sauce to be really sweet which ruined the dish for me (but my boyfriend liked it so I might be making it again for him...) I cooked the fish in parchment which worked well. My filets were thinner (toward the tail of the halibut) so I took them out after 7 minutes and they were perfect.

fussy approach to what is basically fish with nuoc cham.

This is a delicious recipe! It is more tasty if you use banana leaves (as they add subtle flavor); if you cannot find them locally you can find them here: http://www.templeofthai.com/food/asian_snacks/frozenbananaleaf-1000000257.php

This was one of the most delicious fish recipes I've made. I couldn't find banana leaves and used parchment paper and probably should have reduced the cooking time by about 5 minutes. I also accidentally used the lemon-mint sauce when wrapping the fish (instead of the mint topping) but it came out fantastic and so next time I'll only prepare the one sauce and use it both as a topping and in preparing the fish. Next time I'm going to try making it with tofu for my vegetarian friends.
