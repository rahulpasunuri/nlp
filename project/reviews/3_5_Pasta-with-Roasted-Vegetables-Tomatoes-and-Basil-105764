This is the perfect combination of textures, colors, and flavors. The only things I changed: I left out the eggplant and added some extra butternut, and I used a 15-oz can of diced tomatoes (drained) since there are no good fresh tomatoes available this time of year. So delicious! It would make a wonderful cold summer pasta salad as well, and I'll definitely make it again in late summer, when my garden is full of squash and tomatoes and basil.

I tried to like this. I made it a second time, just to be sure, but my family and I think that it is just the wrong combination of veggies for pasta. Some found the butternut squash too sweet; others found the eggplant too bitter (even with an hour pre-salt to get rid of those bitter juices).

Good. Not great. the good: butternut squash is a brilliant addition to roasted veggies with pasta. Will definitely do this again. The not good; I found the balsamic vinegar too sour. Overpowered the basil flavor. Suggest: leave out the vinegar, let the fresh taste of basil stand on its own. What I changed: briefly sauteed the garlic in the oil to avoid the raw garlic taste, and substituted canned chopped tomatoes. A good starting point, I will work on it.

I would have rated this 2.5 if it were an option. Better than good, meaning I'll likely try it again, but not quite memorably delicious. I'm glad I reserved and used the pasta cooking liquid--otherwise it would have been too dry.

I forgot to add that we used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh...was still great and less chopping!

So delicious and so easy even my husband could make it! The flavors where great and all the veggies were delish! Tossed with spinach linguine from Trader Joe's instead of penne. Great quick and easy weeknight vegetarian meal!

this was excellent. my husband just had this for dinner and i would definitely make again. i used green and yellow quash, eggplant and red pepper. the proportions do not have to be exact. i tossed in some freshly grated pecorino romano instead of the parmiggiano and used dried oregano as i did not feel like buying a bunch of fresh basil (although that would be great too). we ate it hot, but i am sure it would be wonderful at room temperature as well. enjoy.

Very yummy, fresh, and easy to eat. Gotta love roasted squash. I did find it improved with lots more balsamic vinegar to taste and increasing the proportion of veggies to pasta (about doubling). But I am a bit mad for roasted veggies.

This is a perfect vegetarian meal or side dish for a late summer or early fall dinner when basil and squash are plentiful. I brought this to a mid-September block party and received many compliments. It's very healthy and very pretty. My backyard is brimming with basil and we were sick of pesto. It is time consuming to peel and cut the vegetables. I made it several hours ahead of time and the flavors seemed to intensify. It smells even better the next day.

This dish is a wonderful way to make healthy pasta-my husband and I loved it and have leftovers for days! I used 3 tri-colored bell peppers, eggplant, 2 zucchini, and added sliced porcini mushrooms during the last 10 mins of roasting. I broiled the veggies at the end for 2-3 mins to give them a little bit of char. I followed another reader's suggestion about combining the tomatoes, garlic, vinegar, and basil ahead of time and also tripled the garlic, as I do with most everything I make...I will definitely be making this again!

My family liked this recipe, but they liked it better when I just made the vegetables separate without the pasta. I have served the vegetables at many dinner parties with rave reviews.

This definitely needs more balsamic vinegar, oil and cheese or else it tastes rather bland. It came out great when it was finished.

I made this with vegetables on hand (same as recipe minus eggplant, plus zucchini), and used sage instead of basil. Absolutely delicious!

I made this with the Garlic roasted chicken breasts and it was the most satisfying meal I've made in a while. I roasted the veggies for about 10 min more than specified, and doubled the olive oil. I also used spinach penne, and everything together tasted so healthy. Definitely will make this often.

Changed a few of the veggies to ones in season, used white balsamic and it was great.

This recipe worked out really well. I used whole wheat penne pasta, mushroom broth and perhaps a bit more basil then called for. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as printed. Both my vegetarian wife and omnivore son loved it. I plan to include this dish in my growing repertoire of vegetarian meals.

This the second time I have made this recipe. The colours, flavours and texture are wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly the first time. This weekend, I grilled the vegies in a grill basket (I put the squash in first) and added asparagus (put in last). Absolutely wonderful! The key is the fresh basil and the freshly grated parmesan cheese! AND the squash is a must! I served it to 10 people with some grilled sausages. yummy!

This is a wonderful recipe to either make on purpose (purchase all the veggies new) or make with veggies you have on hand. Just be absolutely sure to use very good quality olive oil and I always use fresh garlic and plenty of it.

this was a great meal for my vegitarian and meat eating guests alike! Veggies DID take much longer to cook than the recipe suggests. I also increased the oil and Balsamic, and added fresh Mozerella.

This recipe converted two non-veggie eaters. Simple and delicious... though I did find that I needed more oil and cooking time for the veggies. It could be that I had a bit more than the recipe called for, but it certainly didn't hurt the results any. My Parmesan was looking a bit sad so I substituted a great local sheep milk feta and it was a perfect addition. This is a great veggie main where non-vegetarians won't miss the meat!

Really wonderful! I did vary the recipe: In the roasting pan, I added garlic, thyme, and oregano; I left out the eggplant and butternut squash (didn't have any in the fridge). To the tomatoes/basil/roasted veggie combo I added small cubes of mozzarella cheese and kalamata olives. Will go in my normal rotation of summer recipes when tomatoes and basil abound!

Very easy - I halfed it for todays lunch. My co-workers loved it! Even Marlys, my friend that hates everything, ate it. I have a grill so I roasted the veggies and tomatoes then used white balsamic... my co-workers agreed this would be perfect for a pot luck! ENJOY!

I used 4 garlic cloves. I mixed it with the oil and vinegar and set it aside to let its flavor seep in before tossing it with the pasta. Very good flavor, but a little on the sweet side despite the vinegar, IMHO. Freshly grated parmesean helps balance the flavor so apply liberally.

I made this for some vegetarian friends and they loved it. I added thyme before roasting the veggies, used zucchini and a vidalia onion. Wonderful flavor. Didn't use the pasta water, used a bit more balsamic. I am sure I will make it again and again.

This recipe is delicious! Full of flavor! I didn't measure out just salt and pepper though, I actually put in granulated garlic, seasoned salt, chili powder, and I added shrimp! It was simply delicious!

Salted and let drain the eggplant cubes, used zucchini instead of the crook-neck squash and added a spanish onion cut in wedges. Great veggie pasta dish that will become a regular in this house.

Served this dish for Thanksgiving Dinner as a twist on traditional vegetable preparation. I couldn't resist a liberal sprinkling of dried oregano and thyme on the veggies before I put them in the oven; otherwise, followed the recipe except for using a little balsamic vinaigrette (rather than pasta liquid) to moisten at the end. Also was liberal with grated parmesan cheese for garnish. This is a keeper!!

This was a great recipe and so easy! I used a little bit of the reserved liquid, just to moisten it a bit, but otherwise, delicious. Easy but also nice enough to make for company.

Crowd pleaser!!! Thank you all for the notes. In addition to the recipe's veggies I added onion, chili pepper flakes, whole garlic cloves (some of us were stinkier than others) and a touch more balsalmic. It was delicious!

Loved this recipe! Roasted whole garlic cloves in with green & yellow zucchini, onion, red pepper, broccoli, asparagus & eggplant. Added parsley. Used tri-color pasta. Couldn't find nice tomatoes in season yet, so tossed in a few whole cherry tomatoes when sprinkling the Parmesan. Didn't need reserved liquid from pasta. Leftovers served as cold pasta salad the next day ...delicious.

I loved this recipe. Its a great way to eat your vegetables. I used different vegetables than the recipe called for onions, asparagus, peppers, anise, brocolli, and zucchini. I like to eat food which is healthy and delicious and this fits the bill. I used it as a side with chicken and it went over well. Thanks.

Easy, quick and delicious! Followed the recipe and idea of other cooks. I roasted some additional garlic cloves with the vegetables, then mashed the roasted garlic and mixed w/vinegar and oil and mixed with veggies and pasta. Tasty!

Really, really excellent dish. Minus cutting up vegetables, it is also quick. I think it tastes better warm, not cold.

YUM! This was easy, healthy, colorful and delicious. Veges were crunchy tossed amid spiral pasta. We can't eat bell peppers so other veges that work are asparagus and large chunks of zucchini. Garlic cloves boiled in water for 5 minutes and added at the end add a nutty flavor. This is a regular dish at our house now. Many thanks.

I added the minced garlic to the roasting vegies during the last 5 - 10 minutes of cooking. I'm a non-vegetarian and think this dish is a little bland, so will add spices, chilis, or hot sauce the next time I make it.

This receipe is excellent! After roasting the vegetables, we added the cooked penne, tomatoes, basil and garlic to the roasted vegetables picking up the flavors and juices from the roasting pan. Superb ....

This easy recipe is incredibly flavorful. I cut it in half and only used one butternut sqash and it was perfect. The next time I try this, I'll roast the garlic cloves with the vegetables and add it at the end. Great dish!
