I don't visit Epicurious to get recipes that use Cool Whip. Hardly would call that French.

Tastes like what it is! A disappointment, epsecially when making real chocolate mousse can be so easy. Try the recipe on here with egg whites and lemon whipped cream - easy and delightful.

With Cool Whip as the main ingredient I feared this would be the featured dessert from a trailer park cook book. Regretfully the finished product sunk to my expectation. Gloppy and cloying sweet. Pass.

I found a recipe similar to this one about 12 years ago and used it as a dipping mousse for fruit (bananas, oranges, strawberries, star fruit, etc) and angel food cake squares. I fed it to food snobs who didn't know what it was made out of and they all loved it and wanted the recipe, but I got it off the internet and hadn't saved it. Today I found it again and I fed it to my family and they also loved it. It is a great recipe to make with the kids, especially to use as a dip for fruit. It is especially nice in the summer months. It may not be the best recipe out there but again it is called EASY for a reason. I use a bit more chocolate to bring out the chocolate flavor vs the whip cream flavor.

I was looking for an easy and light dessert that could travel and this fit the bill. A few tablespoons of Cool Whip are not going to kill anyone, and the addition of sliced almonds and amaretto improved it greatly. Gourmet it ain't, but for a three-bite dessert, it's an easy solution.

I didn't try this recipe, but anything including cool whip scares me. I do have a solution, a recipe that is just as easy and probably much better than the fake taste that comes along with cool whip. silken tofu- one package good quality, semi-sweet chocolate 70% cocoa (or more if you're a fan of dark) melted over a double boiler, roughly 300-350 grams put the tofu in a food processor until smooth, add the melted chocolate and run until chocolate is incorporated, you may add vanilla if you wish. put in serving cups/bowls and refrigerate until set delicious! trust me the tofu does not make it weird or gross

Yuck. Cool Whip and bad chocolate. Waste of time and resources.

Wow, there sure are a lot of foodie snobs out there bashing this innocent "recipe". It said "easy" in the title and mixing chocolate with Cool Whip is very easy - just perfect for the beginner cook or children. It may not be for everyone, especially folks like myself who like to use natural ingredients but it doesn't give you the right to bash it to others. I use canned milk occasionally so does that make me a bad cook? I didn't think so. Lighten up people!

It's a fun & quick recipe to make w/ kids but it's not too good....didn't taste good by itself nor with the whoppers- although the kids loved to eat the candy and smash it; we didn't get to try the amaretto one as there was none in the house.... We won't be making this again.

Yikes!! Anyone have the recipe for this cool whip? Should we call Sandra Lee???

Wow...while I have to agree that I personally wouldn't make this, what's WAY more upsetting is that if you look at the "at a glance" section, the "cuisine" is "French"...mon dieu, c'est une parodie!!

It wouldn't surprise me if this does taste good, but I'll never be able to bring myself to use cool whip. Gives me shivers ...

I know -- can this really be good? It actually is! And it's ridiculously easy. I was a skeptic too -- cool whip, really? It's great! Although of the 3 -- the basic with coconut, and the amaretto ones were far superior to the malted.

Cool Whip? Yummmm. Follow it up w/ some Cheez Whiz and Vienna Sausage. How about adding some Pop Tarts?! Anyone got any Hot Pockets to go w/ this?
