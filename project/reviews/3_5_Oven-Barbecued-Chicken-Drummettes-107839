Excellent! The ginger gave it a nice punch.

Perfect for Superbowl or kids,just make sure you make enough(I mean double batch!).The Jack Daniel's "Barbecue Sauce" works very well with the root beer and ginger.

I made these for a birthday party, and everyone loved them! I ended up cooking them for a lot longer, because I cannot stand soggy chicken skin. The sauce was fabulous.

delicious and SO easy to make! i used drumsticks with a convection oven and it only need about 5 minutes more cooking time. so tender and juicy. the right barbecue sauce is key.

Great flavor, but I do recommend roasting the drumettes 20 minutes longer either before or after basting them. I like my barbecue drumettes a litte more done and skin a little more crisp. My guests were impressed. Thanks!

I made the recipe with wings and the results were great. My family loved the way the chicken tasted especially the ginger. I recommend broiling the chicken as oppossed to roasting it because the meat gets cooked through and the skin get nice and cripsy just like a barbecue.

I have to wonder if Monica's problem with under cooking was because she used DRUMSTICKS instead of DRUMMETTES. Big difference. But I can see the problem what with the request for the recipe being for drumsticks & the recipe calls for drummettes. Great appetizer!

We loved these so much I'm making them again this weekend. I used the convection bake option on my oven so maybe that's why we didn't find them undercooked. I also think that you need to use a barbecue sauce that you really love because that's a dominant flavor in the dish.

Beware -- these need to be cooked longer if you want the skin to be crispy. We loved the sauce, but hated the undercooked (in our opinion) skin. I'd say cook them until they're crispy, toss them in the sauce, and then sprinkle them with the parsley, sesame seeds and crushed red pepper.
