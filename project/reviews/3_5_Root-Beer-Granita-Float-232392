found this to be really simple to make and not at all time-consuming. Started preparations but timed it to be ready ready just as the meal ended. Served it as pictured and added a little christmas bauble given this was being served at a Christmas eve dinner. Guests found it refreshing and really unique. All asked for seconds and some went away with copies of the recipe in their hands. Definitely making this again!

an easy fun summer treat

Really good. I started the granita in my ice cream maker until it was mostly frozen and flakey and then finished it in the freezer, which worked really nicely. The root beer syrup is particularly good - it gets so rich and thick it almost tastes like chocolate.

this is so simple it is hard to believe a 4 fork rating, but for a casual dinner or barbeque it is perfect kids and adults both like it great addition to 4th of July parties---get the cookie it makes it I added a small flag for the 4th

Wonderful way to end a meal on a sweltering day. I cooked my syrup for an hour (low and slow), and it was perfect. I also served these with the same cookies that are in the picture of the granita float. Looked great!

This was delish! Do you think it would work with diet root beer?

This was easy and delicious. I took everyone's suggestions and slow boiled the root beer and had no problems. I also stirred the root beer in the freezer occasionally and it came out perfectly. I went very easy on the syrup over the ice cream and it was perfect for a hot, hot summer night. My guests were impressed with this take on a root beer float. Not as terribly filling as a real float either.

Greatness! Very good stuff for only two ingredients. Used IBC Root Beer, good stuff. Boiled too high and too fast first time, ended up with hard rock candy. Second time, read suggestions here, did a slow boil (start boililng on high then take down to 6 or 7 and ride for a little longer until it's syrupy). Granita in bottom of cocktail glasses, proportionate amount of ice cream and then PLEASE follow the serving suggestion for the syrup, otherwise it will overpower (my overzealous sister asked for tons and regretted it!) Anyhow, very good recipe. Will definitely make again, fun especially for kids or the young at heart.

My kids (13 and 7) love this. Make it easy on yourself- empty half a 2-liter bottle of root beer into the freezing pan, half into the boiling pan. When frozen, zap for 20 seconds in the microwave, then crunch with fork. Don't try to rush the boiling-down process. Just check on it every 30 minutes or so.

Wow! I followed the suggestions listed in the user notes (stir the granita periodically as it freezes to get a grainy texture and slow boil the root beer). I fast-boiled the root beer the first time and ended up with burnt-smelling hard candy. Ha. Anyhow, I am eating this now and it is truly fabulous. The syrup is just right, like a glaze sort of consistency. It coats the ice cream and the rest integrates with the granita below. Thank you, epicurious! :) Matthew

The only thing that's left out of the recipe is that to make a granita you have to stir the mixture with a fork several times while it is freezing in order to give it a grainy texture and to keep it from separating into layers, as seems to be a problem when following this recipe exactly. I'm a rootbeer float fanatic, and this is by far one of the best things I've ever had.

My kids really liked this one by the pool and it reminded me of my childhood

This is a good dessert where you want to be a little bit fancy, but also want it to be kid friendly. Everyone thought it was very good and very clever. The syrup should be on a slow boil, and I was careful to get it to reduce to the exact amount. Mine wasn't sticky at all like the other reviewer said.

I followed the recipe exactly . . . and my syrup ended up entirely too sticky, especially once it hit the cold ice cream. I imagine it was 'operator error' . . . but I can't figure out what I could have done wrong. Is there a danger with syrup of taking it too far and being unable to 'soften' it afterwards? Granita was okay, but the sweetness of the root beer sank to the bottom layer of the pan, while the top layer was mostly ice.

Is the flaked root beer supposed to be mixed with the syrup? If so, are you supposed to keep some syrup separated out for pouring over the ice cream? Thanks...

I thought this was delicious and although a bit time consuming in terms of boiling down the syrup, it was worth it. Would definately make again and next time for company!
