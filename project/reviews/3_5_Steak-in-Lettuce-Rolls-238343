We loved this recipe. The hanger steak was a bit chewy but that was either because I left it on the grill two minutes longer or just the cut. I grilled the onions instead of cooking them on the stove and they were fantastic. The only thing I did not have the the saamjang.

It was a huge hit at my daughters birthday party. My family are tough critics and were skeptical about wrapping the beef in lettuce with the scallion. But once they tried it, everyone loved it.

healthy and delicious take on korean! i'm korean and found this recipe to be a solid, heathy version of kalbi. i would reduce the lemon juice or skip it all together - i found it to be a bit too tangy. i sauteed the onion in a pan first and didn't need any oil. after about 5 minutes, i added the beef to the pan (again, no oil needed. i did have saamjang but to keep it even healthier, it may be best to skip it since it is very high in sodium and i found that the marinated beef held its own well.

A tasty and easy meal. I didn't use the scallions, but sauted sweet onions and peppers. Also, i substitued soybean paste for a spicey peanut sauce.
