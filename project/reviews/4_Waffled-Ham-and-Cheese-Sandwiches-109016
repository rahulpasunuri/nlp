Very delicious and an excellent snack for kids after school. My British grandmother's butler used to make us these for tea after school when the cook was off duty. It's basically the winter version of tea sandwiches (cucumbers are not in season in January). Sometimes we got lucky and got fresh-picked crab meat and some sort of cheese but it was mostly apple and Stilton or thinly sliced honey baked ham and Gruyere. The beauty of this is that you can make it as gourmet or as basic as you would like it to be.

These are delicious, especially with a little honey dijon. I served these with a good winter vegetable soup and it was a terrific comfort meal. For another treat, make french toast and cook it in the waffle iron. MMM!

What fun! All those people who complained because it is too low brow should get a life. They are probably raising a new generation of little food snobs-- not good or healthy eaters just snobs. My kids loved it, my husband loved it. Paired with great homemade soup and it was a wonderful dinner for a cold winter's night.

I've never had so much fun reading the reviews before, but unfortunately (or fortunately), it seems that the staff at Epicurious have edited out the negative entries. Nonetheless, I'm happy to learn I don't have to go out and buy a panini press!

Well, here we go again. Having read the simple recipe and examined all of the comments from the good cooks here at Epie, I decided to have a go at it, in the traditional Epie style. First of all, I thought this was a wonderful recipe! My family loved it! Of course, in the traditional Epie style, I didn't actually follow the given recipe. How could I? WHITE BREAD? Boiled Ham? The author was obviously kidding us. Heat the waffle iron until it smokes? um... has she cleaned that thing lately? Of course, right off the bat, I noticed that no one had done a vegan version of the recipe, even after being on the board for several years. Time for me to step up to the plate (no pun intended). OK, picture this. Replace the butter with unsalted olive oil (extra virgin, not that prostituted stuff). The bread is home made from corn grits and Evian water. Use Perrier for a fluffier texture. Cheese is replaced with thin sliced Tofu, and the ham.... well. I cannot adequately describe the joys of refried mung beans! Cook, drain, blend, freeze, slice thinly, and deploy! See? No possibly sentient beings (not even Yeast!) were harmed in this recipe. Ok. I DO actually talk to the mung bean plants, to help them grow, and be happy. OK, I give up. What's next? A recipe with ROCKS?

Ive been making grilled cheese sandwiches for years, but never thought of doing them in advance and reheating them in the oven - what a good idea!

I read all of the reviews. I'm suprised that the rating is not higher due to people who approved it, but did not vote. My grandkids grew up thinking fast food was gourmet. They learned from me what is gourmet. However--on occassion I will prepare just plain old comfort food. Kids & grandkids alike are thrilled. Grandkids still think I'm a gourmet cook. Kids say "Thanks Mom!) Back to boneless/skinless chicken boobs (:() tomorrow--this was fun tonight! Does it ever occur to any of you how long we are living after eating/drinking all the stuff that is wrong for us? My parents lived to be 84 & 87. Did they want to live longer? No. They were tired.

I used to make these as a kid, and let me tell you, using waffles for grilled cheese is a winning recipe! I believe there is room on epicurious for some fun "junk-food" recipes... maybe some reviewers shouldn't be taking themselves so seriously.

Wait a minute, y'all. I haven't made this recipe yet, but I know a Monte Cristo sandwich when I see one. This is gourmet food and there even used to be a special folding pan to make them in. Using a waffle iron makes sense and is even more fun. If you want to make them more "grown up", add some mustard--sure isn't worth all this fussing!

Whenever I read recipe reviews saying "my family loved this," or "this was something my family enjoyed preparing together," I find myself wishing I had a big family to cook for. So, if a recipe like this can help those of you with a whole houseful to call to the table at mealtime remember what a blessing you have, then I say more power to it!

The cook writes about serving 12 children. Well this kid loved this snack, even though it is 'only' a grilled cheese sandwich. The 'waffle' effect is great! We loved it.

So many great recipes and so little time! This recipe brought the whole family together and made us all remember the simple pleasures in life.

Folks get a grip. I have used the Epicurious website for years and have never been compelled to write before. I just made this recipe for a group of 20 6 year olds who absolutely loved it. They each got to grill their own sandwich, decorate their own cupcakes, and finally were able to participate in making a meal. Most of these kids thought all food came from a can, a package, a restaurant or McDonalds since their parents don't cook. Think of the target audience before you make your comments. Is is meant to be fun for kids, not meant as a gourmet meal for the upper crust of society.

To previous reviewer: Chill out dude/dudette - you have way too much anger going on.... Save it for what counts, ya know??! This is a fun sandwich to make with the kids and I, frankly, never thought about using a waffle iron to make grilled cheese. Go make a cheese waffle and have glass of wine!

My mom did this for my brother and me 40 plus years ago and we made so much fun of her using the waffle iron! She got a real kick out of it when I showed her this recipe and said "see I was way ahead of my time". Some of you people need to get a grip and lighten up!

I'm a Brit, and when I was growing up, grilled cheese sandwiches were not standard fare. So even though I'm a perfectly competent cook, I was actually quite pleased to have a clear recipe for making a good one! My kids had great fun with them too. Why do reviewers like the cook from Miami feel the need to snipe and make spiteful remarks on a site like this? Epicurious is a website for cooks of all skill levels and differing requirements in a recipe. I presume he/she was the "offended" reviewer originally. How can any rational person be offended by a harmless recipe on a cookery website? And as another reviewer pointed out, this one came from a feature on party food for kids, so it was entirely appropriate too.

Rating: 3
isn't this forum supposed to be about reviewing the recipe? my review: i thought it was great fun for the kids to whom it was targeted. so great to get them involved in cooking at a young age thus it was also fun for me. not sure they would have been able to handle Lamb Souvlaki Sandwiches with Greek Salad and Tsatsiki Sauce. :-)

The food snobs on this site are always so hilarious, I mean really, being "offended" at the publication of a sandwich recipe? If you saw this in the magazine it was part of a spread featuring kids' party food recipes. It is possible to enjoy wonderful simple foods too... I'm sure there are plenty of food snobs on this site whose big dark secret is that sometimes they hide in their closet with a big bucket of Kentucky fried chicken or a bag of pork rinds Ha ha get over yourselves and make a waffle sandwich

What a great twist to an old fashioned receipe. Loved the idea of using my waffle iron for other than waffle's. This sandwich brought back fond memories of dipping my grilled cheese in tomatoes soup! Thanks for the idea!

are y'all still getting your nickers in a twist about the un-gourmet-ness of this fun little recipe/idea. GET OVER IT! This is a fun recipe and it saves buying yet ANOTHER single use appliance - and for someone who appreciates quality over quantity, less is more so let's get that waffle iron a workout.

Sounds like a great recipe to try with my kids! Contrary to popular belief, there are alot of us out there that actually like new ideas for old recipes! I'd never "thunk of" using a waffle iron! I especially got a hoot from reading the reviews - some of you guys REALLY need to get a life that doesn't revolve around food and dissing others whose opinions differ!!! But what do I know...I'm just a hick from some cow town out west! Lighten up folks!

This is a sandwich. What are the snobs doing criticizing this recipe. It was great, and better still, my kids had a ball making them. I highly recommend this for a lay back evening of cooking with the kids. To the person making the bigot comment below......... get help....you need it!

Some people thrive on making their life more difficult than necessary. I'm for making my life simpler and appreciate reminders and ideas that help me come up with meals slightly different and good.Many people love home cooking and, to me, that means we don't all have to be gourmet cooks. Epicurious is read by people interested in food and ways to fix it . To each his own

Okay, the recipe may not be groundbreaking itself, but the preparation and presentation was interesting enough to entice me to make it. My family loved it and enjoyed every bite -- that makes it a winner for me! Isn't a good recipe one that people enjoy?

If you're lucky enought to have an old "pie iron" (used to cook over an open fire) you can turn this recipe into a yummy Aussie treat - the jaffle. There are entire snack shops Downunder devoted to these great sandwiches, filled with just about anything you like (my personal favorite is avocado and bacon). This method of cooking sandwiches seals the edges, and the resulting steam transforms the texture of basic white bread into something quite wonderful. I believe that pie irons can still be bought at some stores specializing in camping equipment. Give this a try - you can use these gizmos on the stove top, as well as over a campfire.

Perhaps this will please the critics: Prosciutto and Fontina with arugula and tomato on good-quality french bread. (My favorite is tomatoes, basil, and fresh mozz on a french roll with a little balsamic and green onion "dressing".) Great reminded that simple and fresh is good. A dish doesn't have to be complicated to be delicious.

How about this variation that my grandmother made us as children and still is great. For each sandwich take 2 slices challah and use cheese of your choice(and add ham too if you like..and or tomatoes..and or Dijon mustard etc) dip sandwich in beaten egg and cook in a frying pan in which you have melted a little butter. We call it French Toasted Grilled Cheese. Eat with knife and fork. Maybe the knife and fork will placate the "food snobs" and they will feel they are preparing a REAL recipe. In any event it is delicious.

I fail to see how commenting on the fact that a "brit" (someone from Great Britain) calls a grilled ham and cheese sandwich a "toastie" (as in toasted) is bigotry?

Used the George Forman grill instead of the waffle iron. Croque Monsieur redux. (Or is it Croque Madame?) Stick a French name on it. That should satisfy the food snobs. Great with a mug of tomato soup.

Also great as a turkey melt....with grilled onions and sliced turkey. The waffle iron makes for a fun presentation!

After the heart attack, you could try this more reasonable, still very good version by using a little olive oil mixed with a very light coating of butter. Chicken is just as good, and garlic salt, fresh thyme or rosemary, or cayenne or even chilli powder are all very tasty.

although I wouldn't make this dish again for myself. It still is a great one. It is an oldie for me, been doing it for years, my children all do it now for their children, great hit, great recipe for a child to learn cooking on. We have had it with several diffrent typs meat and cheeses, we have also used several diffrent fillings in the sandwiches. We have used the waffle iron, the sandwich maker and now we use the grill because the children all have the other appliances at their homes.

One of the New York Times' food writers wrote a piece on panini a year or two ago in which she noted that you could use a waffle iron to make them, but she didn't give any details about how. (I do them in a ridged nonstick grill pan, with a small heavy pot on top to press them down, which works but is slower and requires flipping to get grill marks in both sides.) This recipe gives fairly minimal detail but it does get across the notion of "just stick them in, however many you can fito in a layer", which I find helpful! Now I just need to replace my dead waffle iron.

Last time I made this dish, I put garlic powder on the outside with the butter and added a little cayenne for a kick. Its good with just cheese and tomato. Ilove the simplicity!

Oh, please ... all recipes are nothing more than "ideas". I'm grateful for this idea for a little-used appliance that takes up a lot of space. Here's an addition to the "idea": lightly coat one of the slices on the inside (meat and cheese side) with mayonnaise or dijonnaise, add a slice of roast pork and a couple sandwich pickles to the stated preparation. Presto, a good approximation of a Cuban sandwich!

Too fun! Epicureans have to start somewhere, you know. My 12 year old had a wonderful time & is now on her way to new discoveries. Great confidence builder!

This is a great "idea" that I had never thought of - my kids love grilled cheese - I made these one day when my daughter had friends over, and the girls were impressed by my "fancy sandwiches." To the cooks whose senses were offended - I imagine that the glass must often seem half-empty to people like you! If you think you should be pleased by everything on this site, your expectations are ridiculous.

Fun idea for the kids, and they look great. It's hard to think up new things these days when most kid's have so much to choose from. And I like the ideas I saw from the other cooks. Hey food snob, did you have your maid send that?

It's good with any sandwich fillings-you can make a fake muffaleta (sp?) with chopped mixed olives, variots meats and cheeses...and lots of waffle irons have floating hinges, which allow thicker sandwiches.

I always add tomatoes and onions wit the ham and cheese. Once almost ready to eat, add a soft egg on top with some ketchup.

I used both swiss and cheddar cheese, and it was loved by both grownups and kids alike :) I did use different breads though- some quality rye bread and really good sourdough; It seemed like the regular white bread just smashed down and got doughy and sticky. For a sophisticated twist, try putting plum jam in the middle- it sounds strange but is really good! A breakfast hit at this house!
