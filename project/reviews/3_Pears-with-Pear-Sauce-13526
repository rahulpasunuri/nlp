What a disaster this sauce was for me. It's very difficult to see the color of the sugar syrup against a black non-stick skillet bottom and it turned into a hard, sticky mass when I added the cream and tried to whisk it. I finally got the solidified mess off the pan and the whisk and into the trash. I then made my own pear sauce - using the sauted pears, I pulsed them a little in the food processor. In a small sauce pan I made a simple syrup with granulated sugar and water, and boiled it down until it looked neither too thick or runny. Stirred the pears into it, and it's quick and a lot easier than trying to make the caramel sauce. I will serve this on the Upside Down Pear Chocolate Cake that is really good and easy. I plan to top the cake with the sauce and some slightly sweetened whipped cream.

The sauce was really tasty and not difficult to prepare. I didn't put it on the pears, though, instead i used it on the chocolate whiskey cake also on this site. Fantastic combination - i highly recommend it!

This was good, but I can't say it was worth all of the trouble.

This was pretty tasty, though I used 3/4 the sugar and cream and it was still very sweet and rich--it could probably do fine with about 1/2 (whip up another pear if you want more volume). This might let the citrus stand out a little more too.

Tasty and really easy to do. I will try adding some of the lemon juice to the zest as I couldn't taste the lemon flavor. Also, I wish the sweetness of the sauce was counterbalanced with some spice. Rosemary maybe. If you have any idea, please let me know.

A great basic recipe and good by itself. I often cut the pears into large chunks after cooking and serve them in chocolate cups with sauce poured over. It always get raves. Also great with grand marnier infused ice cream and candied orange peel. I freeze the purreed pear sauce and then just thaw and add the caramelized sugar, vanilla and cream. This saves a lot of time and is always handy

Great dessert. Not too sweet. In addition to the lemon zest. I added some of the lemon juice that was a great way to pair the sweeter sauce with the just-so tartness of the whole pears. Would make it again for sure.

Excellent, but a couple of words of caution - the caramel is extremely hot, I used a non-stick pan and melted my stirring spoon. On my second try I used a glass pan and real fork and then it turned out fine. Be careful when adding the cream as the sauce bubbles up quite a bit. Sauce is very good over uncooked pears as well.

Excellent, even though I didn't both making the caramel from scratch. I followed the recipe almost exactly otherwise, just substituting part of a store-bought jar of Mexican cajeta (dulce de leche or caramel), thinned w/1 Tbsp of heavy cream, for the homemade caramel. I really let the pears brown at the end, in the browned butter, though I did squeeze them with lemon juice rather than use the zest. Very nice--no need for ice cream or whipped cream with this as it's plenty rich enough, and elegant, too.

It was very delicious! Although making the caramel sauce and trying to keep it warm was a little unwieldy...very very good!
