I followed the recipe exactly and the biscuits were what I was dreaming of. I don't think I would use the term "featherweight" to describe them though as mine were pretty hefty. The only change I would make next time is to make mini biscuits using a 1" biscuit cutter.

These are fantastic, super fluffy and high rising. I have made it with buttermilk, but yogurt works really well too. Much quicker, easier and less fattening than my #1 biscuit(the poor reviewer below likley has user error and should have recused herself from voting) so this is my clear 'go to number two'. Try em!

Ohh my... I could not wait to take these biscuits out of the oven. They came out fluffy and beautiful. I added some fresh rosemary springs to add a little kick.

These biscuits really live up to their name. Deliciously light! Our whole family liked even though we omitted the salt for the sake of my husband's BP. We did not roll them--just spooned them onto the cookie sheet.

Was not at all happy with this recipe, they turned out small and very hard, had to throw the left over ones out.Well not make this recipe again Patty from Sparks

I thought the texture of these biscuits was great, but they tasted sweeter than I'd like. If I try them again, I'll omit the sugar.

Great biscuits! Fluffy inside, and the perfect amount of crunch on the outside. For extra flavour, I added 1/2 cup shredded old cheddar, 1/4 tsp dried dill, garlic powder & onion powder. They browned beautifully & were absolutely delicious! After kneading, there is no need to roll. You can drop the dough on the cookie sheet and they come out looking like the biscuits from Red Lobster. I lightly sprayed the cookie sheet with cooking spray even though the recipe called for an ungreased sheet. The bottom of the biscuits came out perfectly golden.

Taste was good, and they were fast and easy. Don't bother to roll, need to be "thick" before you start. Didn't make as many as recipe called for.

The BEST biscuit recipe I've tried yet. This is it. Tips for new bakers: I use half butter, half trans fat free shortening (or lard if you're really wild). Use White Lily Flour if you can. Work the butter/shortening into the flour with your finger tips for a few minutes (rub between thumb and forefinger) until like coarse crumbs. Next tip is to GENTLY work the buttermilk into the flour mixture. As soon as it just comes together, flour your hands and dump onto floured surface (yes, this is a messy recipe). Work a few times -not too much, then cut with biscuit cutter or knife (don't twist the cutter). Cook right away in the preheated over. I brush these with melted butter. This is the best recipe - it's light yet perfect. Most recipes have too much butter and they end up heavy.

It works! It works! And mmm-mmm-good. Living at 8300 ft I have only mastered the art of the hockey puck but these came out light and fluffy as advertised (on the second go-round... first time I did nothing to account for alitude to see what would happen). I used a cheese slicer to cut the butter into thin sheets, then stuck the butter sheets in the freezer while I put everything else together. To account for the elevation I reduced the baking powder by a bit (maybe by 1/5) and added a couple tablespoons more buttermilk. The first go-round I tried not kneading and suggested by others, but they just came out crumbly; so this time I kneaded just until the dough held together decently, maybe two turns. There was a huge difference in the loft between the first cut batch and the biscuits cut from the scraps. (My hubby actually asked "What happened to THOSE??") I will definitely make these again, if anything to prove that delicious rising biscuits *can* be made in thin air.

These biscuits have gained quite the cult following among my friends. I've played around with the amount of butter to make them richer, but they're best made according to the recipe--they puff up wonderfully and are great with some jam and cream, or toasted the next day with some butter.

This is the first time I have ever tried to make biscuits and they were great! I didn't have any buttermilk so I used the reccomended amount of milk and added about one and a half tablespoons of sour cream. They were light and fluffy and my family polished them off within an hour!

This is my absolute favorite biscuit recipe. They're light, flavorful, crisp on the outside, tender inside, and they don't have even close to as much butter as other recipes I've tried. That way I can slather on all the butter I want before eating.

Very easy and wonderfully light. The bottoms burned on mine. Was surprised by the 450 temperature. I've never baked anything at that high of a temperature. Will certainly try again.

I found this recipe to be easy to make and quite delicious, although the biscuits needed an egg wash to acheive that golden brown color. They rose perfectly, and I served them warm with cranberry butter, which makes a lovely accompaniment. If you're looking for a traditional recipe, this is the one.

i used whole wheat flour and used half cake flour... good stuff! really easy to make.. although i doubled the recipe and I probably only got 18-20 biscuits instead of 24.

Found this 3 years ago and have been THE recipe, to make whenever we need biscuits! Use it as a standard and I've also tried adding cheese to it, yummy ... I omitted the sugar for this variation. Very light and just the way everyone here like it. Thanks epicurious!

Thanks, Imogen from Melbourne! Your food processor idea made this recipe accessible. They took longer to bake (12 min) than prepare (6 min) and turned out great! Thanks to you, we'll be a standard for us as well.

This recipe ought to be the standard. I have tried many recipes and this one is the first to turn out the way I want them. In the past, I have made hockey pucks and very tough, chewy biscuits. I used the reviews and followed the directions and these rose the way they were supposed to (and I rolled out to 3/4-inch at best). I used mock buttermilk and forgot the baking soda on the first try, and they were just a teeny bit dense, but still very good. I will use the fingertip method and throw out my "pastry blender." I even mixed with my hands and slowly tossed in the "buttermilk." Now I want to try to add some cheese next time!

This was good, but it was not the best biscuit recipe I have ever tried. I only got eight biscuits instead of 12, so I made another batch and used half cake flour--didn't seem to make much of a difference in making the biscuits lighter.

To the cook in Knoxville, I didn't see anyone else mention it, but is your baking soda and baking powder fresh. If not, it won't rise properly. It might not be you!

I really appreciate the cook who took the time to try to help me. Unfortunately, I have tried these two more times unsuccessfully. I measured the ingredients precisely, checked my oven temperature with oven thermometer, and barely handled the dough both times.....still ended up with flat, hard biscuits! I feel like such a baking loser! They don't rise and they're not a bit flaky. I also consulted the Joy of Cooking biscuit making section and some other sources to try to get it right. Any other suggestions?

To mamullerma: You can order White Lily flour directly from the White Lily web site: www.whitelily.com. It is $2.00 for a 5 pound bag, plus shipping.

To the Cook in Knoxville: Here are several tips for you. Make sure that your butter is very cold; I put mine in the freezer. Be sure that your buttermilk is well chilled too. Do not overprocess the butter into the flour, you need little, irregularly shaped bits because when the biscuits bake, the butter steams away leaving little pockets, thus the "flaky" factor. I also put the buttermilk in a squeeze bottle (like a ketchup bottle) and squeeze it in circles over the dry ingredients. I like to use a pair of chopsticks to stir the wet and dry ingredients (as I'm adding the buttermilk). I almost always use slightly more buttermilk than what the recipe calls for (so there are no dry bits of flour) and then I dump the mixture out on a lightly floured board and lightly pat it with floured hands into a round shape. Like reviewer from Michigan, I would not recommend "kneading" this dough. When you use your biscuit cutter, press the cutter cleanly through the dough and don't "twist" it from side to side. If you do that, it will compress the sides of the biscuit and they won't rise as high. Dip your cutter into flour between rounds to ensure that it doesn't stick. Try the above tips and I will almost certainly guarantee that you will have light, fluffy biscuits. It takes a little practice but you will be rewarded in full. Good luck!

In the South bakers use a lower protein flour which makes a lighter biscuit. White Lily is the brand I've tried. If you can't get this product you can lower the protein content in all-purpose by replacing half of the flour with cake flour. (Does anyone know of a mail order source for White Lily?)

To the cook from Knoxville: perhaps you overhandled the dough, which is the usual reason that biscuits turn out tough or hard. The directions say to "knead", but really, the less these are handled, the better they turn out. My grandmother never kneaded biscuits at all - she just dumped the dough on the counter and patted it into shape. It looked like a mess, but they were the best biscuits ever. I thought these were good biscuits - light and not too greasy. I agree that inch thick dough makes for mighty tall biscuits, but they look and taste fine.

What gems these biscuits were! I couldn't believe they rose so high and tasted so light. I made half the recipe just to try it. Both my husband and I were so disappointed that I hadn't made a whole batch.

Not dry, like some biscuits and not greasy, like others. Just right. Good as a dinner biscuit and also for breakfast with jam or honey.

These biscuits were good but take the advice of the recipe and serve them warm. I served at room temperature and they were not the same biscuits I tried when they came out of the oven. I hate to roll out dough so I dropped the dough into muffin cups and this worked out fine. Then I froze them unbaked, defrosted them in the fridge a week later and baked them up. I'll definitely make these again!

You don't need to roll the dough out to 1 inch thickness, that will rise too high. I rolled mine out to only a quarter of an inch and it raised to normal bisicut hight. They taste best when right out of the oven.
