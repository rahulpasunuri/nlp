i think putting the dough in the fridge ruined my batch, so i'm going to try again without refrigerating. even the ruined batch seemed to have great flavors though.

these are really good. i make a lot of different chocolate chip type cookie recipes and this one is a stand out. i substituted almonds for walnuts and cooked them for 15 minutes. when i make them again i won't cook them as long, for even though they come out soft, they turn quite hard once they cool.

This is such a fantastic recipe. Everyone asks me to bring these cookies to morning tea. I make it all of the time. My only change is to the chocolate. I use a mix of organic milk and dark chocolate (at least 70%) bars and I cut the amount down to around 300 grams (11 ounces.) That way, the chocolate to dough ratio is just right and does not burn.

Delicious! I personally do not love chocolate chip cookies, but these we spectacular. I really loved the subtle spice and loads of chocolate and nuts, I added more walnuts (about 1/2 cup more) because my kids love them. Gave them away for Christmas and got lots of compliments and recipe requests (someone said they taste like the Neiman Marcus chocolate chip cookies). I will make them again and again&

Very tasty. I made mine with pecans instead of walnuts. I made mine tiny about 45 from the batch. I did cool the batter and they cooked for 15 minutes. A few too many chocolate chips for my taste.

I love spice cookies, and who doesn't love chocolate chip cookies? I thought that this recipe sounded intriguing, if a bit strange... but I love odd combinations that turn out great. Well, this ain't one of 'em, at least for me. Rolling them in powdered sugar really seemed odd, and, as it turned out, it was. Since so many other people seem to love these, I will chalk it up to personal taste. But I will say that if you have reservations, there might be a reason for it. You might not like the peculiar mix of chocolate and spice. Good luck!

I made this with half a bag of semisweet chips and half a bag of leftover hershey's kisses (milk chocolate) that i chopped up. I also used hazelnuts instead of walnuts. It was a great combo and the texture was really nice. A big hit with friends and neighbors and I'll definitely make it again!

Pretty tasty! I made several variations because I didn't feel like going to the store. I used bittersweet extra dark chips (YUM) and a small amount of chopped white chocolate, which I thought was good (you can taste the spice more in the white choc. bites). I used a mix of toasted walnuts and pecans (taste really didn't come through, I chopped coarsely, but they were lost among all the chocolate I thought). The spice is subtle. To add more I rolled some cookies in a half powdered sugar, half cinnamon mix. The texture of the cookies is more dense, like a truffle, not flat like a regular choc. chip. Hubby and toddler both loved!

These were good--the spice was subtle, but a nice update to the traditional chocolate chip cookie. I baked for 13 minutes, and although the cookies were not too hard, they were not as soft as I like. Next time I'll use my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe (google search Doubletree chocolate chip cookie recipe) and add some ginger and cinnamon.

This is my default chocolate chip cookie recipe, and I usually keep a batch in the fridge for unexpected company. I usually half the recipe, but keep the 14 ounces (basically, one bag) of chocolate chips. I use a mix of premium milk and dark chips. When I have it on hand, I also like to add in 2-3 ounces of minced candied ginger (uncrystaliezd versions work best) with the chips. I sometimes add 1/8 tsp of cloves alongside the other spices.

These are the best chocolate chip cookies! So delicious. I served them at a cocktail party and they were gobbled up. The subtle spice in the cookie makes them unique and different.

This has become my go-to chocolate chip cookie recipe. It's the only one I make anymore. I use a bag of chips rather than 14 oz of chopped chocolate. And I have omitted the ginger as I don't feel it contributes much. I do bake for about 13-15 minutes, as most reviewers have noted. I also make a large cookie and end up with only about two dozen. So buttery and delicious! Really the bext cookie (and cookie dough!) ever.

Added a generous teaspoon or so of pepper and about 2 oz less chocolate. Delicious but for the adventurous -- not all my workmates were impressed with the strong spices. At 12 minutes cookies were soft but held together; a second batch cooked for 15 minutes were crispier, golden in color and more buttery, which was fine but overshadowed the spices. Next time I'll stick with the 12-minute cooking time.

This is my new favorite cookie. I made some changes though: 1. Cook for 15 mins - 18 is too dry and 13 just isn't quite enough. 2. Skip rolling them in sugar - I did half with and half w/o and the extra sugar wasn't worth it, almost too sweet. My 3 year old liked rolling them in sugar though! 3. I used 10 oz of chocolate and it was still a lot. Make sure when you chop the chocolate that it is still in good sized pieces - makes the cookie more decadent than slivers of chocolate. 4. Add some craisens (cranberry raisens) for a twist.

This is an excellent recipe. It has plenty of chocolate, which I really like. I made half of the batch and refrigerated the second half for the next day. When I made the second half I did not roll the dough in powdered sugar and I liked the cookies much better because they were not sooooo sweet.

Great cookie, a nice change from the traditional chocolate chip cookie. I agree that 18 minutes is too long to cook, once they were cooled they were too hard and dry. A 12-15 minute (depending on your oven) cook time makes them softer inside. Substituted chocolate chips for chopped chocolate for convenience. Delicious!!

I was hoping for something "beyond compare", but really they are just a slightly more holiday-ish variation on a classic chocolate chip cookie. Next time I'll add some cloves, maybe a bit of black pepper, and see what happens...

I made this recipe for the first time (with my husband in mind) and I must say, he loved them. I made the batter and kept it in the fridge so I could bake off a sheet of cookies after dinner. Don't skimp on chopping the chocolate. The variation in the sizes of the chocolate chunks is what makes the cookie so special. The cinnamon and ginger were a nice touch, and next time I will add some orange zest (it's great with any type of spice cookie as well as chocolate).

These cookies are fabulous! Very subtle spice, very chocolately, very delicious. I used chocolate chips and substituted half of the butter with Brummel & Brown. They must be 5 forks with full butter.

These were the most amazing chocolate chip cookies I have ever made! I was trying desperatley to impress my new bosses and new boyfriend and I did that and then some! His friends couldn't stop eating them and the cookies- well made me look GREAT to everyone (my boss asked for the recipe). I made them quite large (think bakery size) and baked them for 17 minutes. I also substituted dark chocolate chips (the new guy prefers dark to milk chocolate- as do I) and everone loved the richness that it added! This is my new and ONLY chocolate chip cookie recipe!

Like everyone else has said, these cookies are fantastic. Don't scrimp on the chocolate or walnuts and you'll have the most meltingly delicious and rich cookies you've tasted...

This was terrific. The ginger, cinnamon, and powdered sugar are subtle but really make this recipe. Made a few changes: 1. used a full TB of vanilla (Mexican); 2. used only 1-1/4 cups of chocolate chips (instead of chunks); 3. used only 3/4 cup of walnuts; 4. didn't refrigerate dough before baking; and 5. baked for only 10 minutes, and got nice soft texture.

I found some valentines candy on sale and chopped up a package and a half of dove hearts for my chocolate chunks. (the quality of the chocolate is well worth the annoyance of unwrapping each of the candies) 14 oz isn't a typo! It's the way to get a truly chocolatey chocolate chunk cookie. The only thing I modified in this recipe was the baking time. 18 minutes is about 6-8 minutes too long for any cookie to be soft and delicious. I will increase the amount of spices the next time around. There was a hint of spice but I want to really taste the flavors. Definitely an excellent recipe.

I followed the recipe to the letter but the cookies were too hard and dry for my taste. I don't think I'll make them again, but if I did I'd probably reduce the amount of flour.

I've been making these every Christmas since the recipe was published in 1996 and everyone loves them. They are a festive alternative to standard choc-chip cookies. Great for a cookie exchange!

This recipe was just OK - but I did make some changes. I thought the 14 oz of chocolate was a typo so I just added one square of chocolate to the top of each cookie. The spices were a nice addition so next time I think I'll make my regular recipe with ginger and cinnamon. I didn't refrigerate the dough, just rolled it into balls, pressed the chocolate piece into it and baked them.

Didn't have an hour to wait for the dough to chill so I just added a tsp. of cinammon and a tsp. of ginger to my favorite choc. chip cookie recipe. A great idea - so yummy! I am definitely going to try this actual recipe soon! Highly recommended!!

These are really good. I was concerned about the intensity of the spices but actually it was a lovely, subtle flavor--not overwhelming at all. My daughter, who is hard to please, loved them. I will definately make them again soon!

These cookies were fabulous- the ginger added an intriguing flavor and the end result was amazing. I doubled the recipe but made them a bit smaller than called for and ended up with about 60. I also substituted bittersweet morsels since I didn't feel like chopping all that chocolate. Can't wait to make them again!!

I made these last night for a cookie exchange I am going to tomorrow. I tripled the recipe since I needed six dozen. I ended up with over 7 dozen which is a good thing as my husband and I can't keep away from them! They are scrumptious! I need to make another batch without the walnuts so my younger allergic son can eat them, too! The only substitution I made was using Ghiradelli chocolate chips instead of chopped chocolate. I needed to save a little prep time.

A truly great cookie. The ginger is subtle, but does something that really enhances the other flavors. Also, I used pecans, which I roasted lightly first, since I detest walnuts. The perfect take-along dessert. Stand back and enjoy the compliments!

These are absolutely fabulous. I've been making them religiously since the original recipe came out. For those who like traditional chocolate chip cookies, the spice may need to be scaled back just a bit.
