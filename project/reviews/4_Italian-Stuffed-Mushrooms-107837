Exceptional! I made it with four portabella mushrooms instead, and the amount of filling the recipe made was just right. I also cooked them a little longer, maybe 30-35 minutes.

This was easy, fast and very tasty. Neighbors at our afternoon fall party enjoyed these mushrooms. I was happy there were no onions nor breadcrumbs in the stuffing since it meant everyone could try them. These days there are so many food "issues" that it's hard to find something that will be acceptable for the majority of guests. I thought the flavors were mellow. I used the fontina cheese and the only change I made was to add a few hot pepper flakes to the stuffing since I thought it would add some "zip."

Even with all the stellar reviews, I really didn't have high expectations for this recipe. Much to my surprise, my husband and I agreed that this was exceptional (I served it for dinner as a side dish with grilled chicken)! Used the fontina and made a couple minor changes: added a shallot to the saute and lightly topped the mushrooms with seasoned breadcrumbs and a bit more parm cheese before baking. This will now be one of my go-to recipes for an impressive, fairly simple appetizer.

Very good! Everyone loved them (even my mushroom hating husband ate 2). Used Baby Bellas to make it easier to pick up, scooped out some of the mushrooms interior with a melon baller and chopped and added that to the saute. Made the night before and just popped in the oven. Will definitely make again.

Made these exactly as written and everyone at the party loved them! Great flavor combination - the only thing I might do different next time is to sprinkle with panko before baking to give a bit of contrasting texture. Keeper for sure!

I made this for a holiday potluck last December, and the party host requested I make them again this year! A great twist on classic stuffed mushrooms.

great blend of flavors. love that this recipe doesn't contain breadcrumbs. great as an appetizer, side dish or vegetarian main course. made a double batch of this for a new year's eve gathering and these mushrooms were loved by the 14 people in attendance. the few pieces that were left heated up well as a side dish for breakfast on new year's day.

Didn't make quite enough filling to stuff all the mushrooms I had (I had more than 24) but WOW. Really nice blend of flavors - used basil, oreg, fennel and Gorgonzola. We'll see what the Christmas taster panel has to say :-) I'm thinking two thumbs way up.

I took these mushrooms to a potluck, everybody loved them and three people asked me for the recipe! I made them as instructed with the addition of oregano - everything Italian needs oregano according to my SO.

This will be my go-to stuffed mushrooms recipe. I made a few changes (details on my blog Grabbing the Gusto). I added ham and green onions. Unlike most stuffed mushroom recipes, this one doesnt have any breadcrumbs. It doesnt need them but Im tempted to try them with a little bit of crumbs next time.

These mushrooms are amazing! So easy to prepare! I was looking for a stuffed mushroom to go with a vegetarian menu and this fit the bill so well. Yummmm! Made them with Italian Fontina, but might try Gorgonzola next time. Will definitely make these again.

I sent my husband to the store with a grocery list, and he came back with Cambozola (like a blue-veined Brie) rather than gorgonzola. I cut off the rind and used it anyway. Results were great! Everyone loved them and said they're worthy of the Christmas menu. Very easy, beautiful, and delicious

in a word - amazing. a little prep heavy for an appetizer, but a huge payoff. excellent flavors, gobbled down quickly, and next time i'll double it.

Easy to make, and they vaporized when I served them. The fennel is a great touch.

This recipe is outstanding! I had people who literally hate mushrooms say that they loved them. All of my guests wanted seconds after eating two each! This recipe is simple to follow and you can get creative with your cheeses. This was so fun to make and I felt like a great chef after the compliments I received. Make this!

Forgot the fennel and to pre-cook the stuffing and they still were delicious. I was busy getting ready for a party and making this recipe from memory. Totally forgot about the fennel, which would have clued me off to cooking it. They were super as hot, passed apps but I still want to make them again to discover the flavor with the fennel included.

Okay--this is by far my favorite stuffed mushroom recipe ever! I was a little skeptical about using fennel and gorgonzola, but both were divine in this appetizer--and everyone raved. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Using the stuffing in portabello mushrooms turns this appetizer into a hearty and satisfying vegetarian entree.

With a food processor, this recipe is a cinch. I also made the Stuffed Mushrooms with Sun-Dried Tomato also found on this site. I liked this stuffed mushroom recipe so much more! I recommend using giant stuffing mushrooms instead of normal sized mushrooms.

So tasty and so easy...definitely a party pleaser. Everyone loved them. I used gorgonzola and tossed the mushroom caps in a bowl that had had olive oil in it before stuffing.

I decided to cook these for my mom on Mother's Day this year, even though I am not the biggest fan mushrooms have ever recruited. These mushrooms however, have me enchanted. They are delectable and a distinct favorite at events. Because of these delightful caps, I am now able to enjoy mushroom dishes. Thank you so much!

I made this along with the Swordfish in Saloriglio sauce (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Swordfish-with-Salmoriglio-Sauce-346) for dinner and it was outstanding. I did it with large portabello mushrooms instead and adjusted the amounts accordingly but it was OUTSTANDING. 4 forks. Try it with pasta as well, it makes a great vegetarian sauce.

Give me a mushroom hater, and I'll give you back a convert! The dish is empty before it makes its way around the room. The cook is advised to snag a few for his/herself before serving unless he/she doesn't really want any, which is a ridiculous thing to think!

I always love trying new recipes. This was a great one. I used celery instead of fennel for fear all the strong flavors would be overwhelming. Perfect for someone who can't eat wheat, no bread crumbs involved like the others. It's a keeper

This recipe is so simple to make yet so creative in the blend of flavors. I like to substitute what I have on hand, like cracked fennel for fennel bulb, freeze- dried basil, and dried tomatoes for those packed in oil. Huge hit at the Halloween party- -gone before dinner arrived.

It's the cheese. I made this three times; twice while vacationing in Rome, and once at home in Virginia. In Rome, the gorganzola was fabulous and hence the recipe superb. At home, blah. Try cooking with pork chops. Just put one or two atop each chop to cook together.

I made these when our gourmet club had their Italian dinner. Definitely a big hit. I actually followed the recipe and found it delightful just as it is written.

I made this for our supper club and it was really wonderful. Rave reviews all around. I forgot the egg, but who knew...

Delicious. I made these with the gorgonzola cheese, Baby Portabello mushrooms, and crushed fennel seeds instead of bulb. Perfect appetizer for a recent wine tasting party. None were left on the plate!

This was a success, I made fourth of the full recipe to serve 4 of us. I added some muscat that was in the frig. 'cause I HAD to deglaze that pan! It was a great hit - and I'll definately make this again.

These were amazing. There were none left after my holiday party. I used gorgonzola cheese and regular sized mushrooms, so they were bite-sized.

I have made these twice, and both times everyone has raved about them. I substituted feta for the fontina/gorgonzola cheese called for, and used fennel seed instead of fennel bulb (and I used a lot of fennel). Adding just a bit more sun-dried tomatoes is good too. Definitely will make these again!

These turned out delicious. However, we did make some adjustments...added extra fennel, red pepper flakes, some feta cheese. We substituted mozzarella cheese for the fontina and used a little more than the recipe called for. We also used italian seasoning instead of basil. Also penciled the mushrooms with some olive oil to keep them from getting tough and dry. Would definitely make these again. Don't forget the red pepper flakes!

Yummy! I wanted a less meaty alternative to the sausage stuffed mushrooms on this site (they are good, just very meat focused). I made this recipe pretty much as written. I did add 2 shallots to the saute mix. I also increased the basil and fennel a bit. It came out very tasty and was gobbled up at the dinner I brought it to.

I have made this twice. The first time I followed the receipe exactly and my guests loved it. The second time I added pancetta and the pancetta was a little overwhelming. I think I will make this again adding more sundried tomatoes.

Oh my! These are so good! I made them for a bridal shower and they were the first thing to go! I used feta cheese instead, but changed nothing else and they were wonderful.

Excellent! We made prepared these mushrooms for a dinner party. They were the first to go! Everyone loved them as much as we did. We used more cheese and used asiago intead of the fontina. The second time we made them we threw in some cracked red pepper to give them a little kick.

I will make this dish again, but the fact is it lacked any type of interest, even from the sun dried tomatoes. I'll add a bit of bacon or pancetta to it next time to "jazz it up" a bit.

These were absolutely stellar! I admit that I substituted Somerset goats cheese for the fontina (it has a soft, brie-like texture, and I thought the subtle flavour would marry very well with the other main flavours) and used oregano and thyme instead of basil (the market was out!!), but I followed the rest of the recipe to a 'T'. I was worried that the mushroom caps were not cooked prior to baking - and my fears did not go away as I watched them bake and start to shrivel on the outside - but once I bit into one, I was reassured - they were juicy, succulent and wonderful. It may be that brushing a little oil on the outside of the caps before baking would help a tiny bit - especially if you are tempted to put them on the grill next time, as I am! I had four guests, and I only got to eat two mushrooms. Sigh. Make them again?? Try and stop me!

THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. OUR GUESTS ATE EVERY BITE.I WOULD ADD A LITTLE MORE FENNEL AND SUN DRIED TOMATOES THAN THE RECIPE CALLED FOR.
