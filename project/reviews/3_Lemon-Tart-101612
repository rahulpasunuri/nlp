I found the crust to be too hard/thick althought the taste of the crust was very good. I would use the filling again but with a different crust.

Enjoyed the filling very much. Added extra Sr. Cream and lemon rind. It was perfectly tart. The crust on the other hand was hard and far to thick. I was embarrassed to watch my guest eat the tart like pizza pie! Will make the filling again, but find a better crust for it.

Loved the lemon flavour! Used prepared individual sweetened tart shells. Very easy because ingredients are always on hand. Will pair with a raspberry sauce next time I'm in a crunch for a dinner party dessert!

I didnt make this but my tarte au citron was raved about when i lived in france. the crust had lemon juice in it. and the filling included lemon juice and lemon zest. and its alwasy prefect everytime. Check out Kosher by Design Cookbook by Susie Fishbein. Its really authentic French patisserie!

hi! I was unimpressed- while tarte citron is supposed to be tart, the typical french bakery ones have a creamier, buttery taste. I will keep looking for another recipe as this is my husband's favourite dessert and no-one was wild about it.

I can't review this as I am in the process of trying to make it. Does one use store- bought lemon juice or squeeze out the stuff at home? If the latter, how does one estimate the number of lemons to buy?

Hi! I can't rate it as I am preparing to make it but how does one estimate the number of lemons used to squeeze out 2/3 cup of fresh lemon juice? Did anyone try it with the reconstituted lemon juice found in grocery stores?

The flavor of this tart was fine, but the texture of the crust and filling were disappointing. Just an average lemon tart.

A simple, elegant winner. I used Meyer lemons (available from almost every homeowner in the San Francisco Bay Area but hard to find in markets). They have a sweeter side, which might satisfy those who find this too tart. The crust seemed thick, but my food friends liked it , and the almonds did provide a lovely mellow sweetness to offset the tart filling.

Nice tangy lemon flavor, I doubled the filling and used only 2/3 cup lemon juice and added some zest, plenty of lemon flavor. I also used a garham cracker crust and the topping from the 'Blueberry Cheesecake' recipe on this site, (very easy, use all-fruit blueberry, warm and add fresh blueberries) topped with whipped cream that I added vanilla extract to and a little lemon zest. Would make this again. Was orignally looking for the tart recipe on the cover of Bon Appetit within the last 3 months, but could not find it anywhere, if anyone has it please send it to my email luvack33@aol.com

This tart is delicious, although I must start remembering to cover the edges of the crust with foil to keep it from browning to fast. Otherwise perfection!

This recipe produced the very worst pie I've ever had in my life! I threw out the whole thing. The crust was hard, no doubt because I made it by hand and not with a processor. Are there no pastry recipes anymore that don't call for one? I also wondered at the long blind-baking time. And the filling - yuck! It was like an overcooked lemon omelette. I'll think I'll go for a lemon curd filled tart next time. And nothing like the tartes au citron I've had in France.

i agree with the previous comment. some thought it was too tart, but its supposed to be. i loved it and thought it was wonderful. also have tried it with a short dough crust, just as nice. will be making this again and again.

I found this to be very sour, although my guests actually thought it was good. It smelled very good when it was in the oven. I threw the leftovers away.

I served this with a lavender sorbet(the recipe should be in the gourmet provence issue)or you can use the lavender Sorbet recipe in the trio of ice creams recipe(found on here)It was a perfect blend of the two flavors. This is an easy recipe to experiment with and simple to do on it's own.

This tart was fabulous. The filling was exactly the way I like it - not so chokingly sweet but smooth and creamy. I did think the crust was both too much and didn't need so much cooking. I added an extra egg yolk and a little more sour cream and I also used bottled Santa Cruz organic lemon juice which has a wonderful tart flavor and is not quite as sour ( I think) as fresh lemons.

I thought that the crust was very dry and the lemon filling a bit scarce. There was also a very strong egg taste. I would try another recipe before trying this one again.

I've made this recipe 4 times. It's always a hit. You do have to like lemon to enjoy this recipe. Pucker up!

A wonderful Chef from the Niagara Region made this tart for dessert during a cooking class at The Good Earth Cooking School. It was easy to recreate at home and oh so delicious!

i am an executive chef and love the ease of preperation and the tartness of the lemon tart

This tart was tart to the point of being sour. I served it with a raspberry sauce sweetened with powdered sugar and triple sec. That was its only saving grace, because the flavor is very one-dimensional -- lemon, all the time lemon, nothing but lemon. I won't be making this again.

I have made this tart 3 times and it's the easiest tart recipe I have found. Try fresh blueberries and raspberries and a sustitute for lemon slices and your dinner guests will be extremely impressed.

I used a different recipe for the crust (pate sucree). The lemon filling was perfect. Very light and not too 'tart'. There were no left-overs!

it was nonsence to maintain oven temperature when it takes so long to do the next step!

This tart is great. I cut down on the sugar in the filling and substituted some whole wheat flour for the white in the crust, plus added the zest of the lemons. This makes it a *tart* tart but really YUMMY.

This tart was delicious. The crust seemed a little dry. I think you could use a regular tart pate sucree for the crust and it would work. The filling was just right. Not too tart or too sweet. A perfect ending to a summer meal.
