Excellent! Used the suggested homemade dressing from reviewer below and it was great...thanks. Served with rice and the Spicy Glazed Eggplant recipe also from epicurious.

I loved this recipe. The cook from Kenwood said it best!!! I don't know how anyone could say this is bland? Hoisin added to anything spices things up!

Not worth the ease. Pork and slaw are both very bland.

This is a perfect recipe for a crowd. I did brine the pork for 6 hours prior to cooking. It was done perfectly. I substituted cooked rice for the slaw and added the carrots, green onions and dressing to the warm rice. This site also has an excellent Chinese Chicken Salad dressing recipe.

Very tasty and kid friendly. Made exactly as written and it turned out super moist and flavourful. Husband would prefer a little more kick so I'll add sesame oil to the hoisin and soy you use to baste the tenderloin next time. Maybe add a couple tablespoons of Spicy Thai dressing?

For the gal from Canda: Years ago a salad called for store bought Asian Dressing. A gal from Kirkland WA sent in this one & my grandson says it would be good on shoe leather. 3 Tablespoons of Rice Vinegar 1 Tablespoon of sugar 3 tablespoons of soy sauce 1/2 Teaspoons of dry mustard (Coleman's) Shake all above until dissolved. 2 Tablespoons of TOASTED sesame oil 1/2 cup of peanut oil. Shake well. Keeps in fridge for a good month.

Nothing is more irritating than checking out an intriguing recipe (i.e. the Asian carrot salad) only to discover that it is comprised of pre-fab ingredients that aren't available where I live. Can someone tell me what Chinese chicken salad dressing is made of?

My husband and I loved this recipe. Instead of buying 2 bags of different kinds of slaw, I just bought 1 bag of brocolli slaw that had carrots in it. This was easy and delicious. I will definitely make it again.
