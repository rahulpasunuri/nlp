Delicious! Used thyme instead of tarragon and forgot the spinach but otherwise made it per the recipe. Quick, easy and yummy!

I made this with Trader Joe's lentils and it tasted great! My 3 year old twins stood by me and requested bite after bite until the plate was empty. I was glad I made a double batch. I will try it with green lentils next time to see the difference, but if there isn't much, I will stick with TJ's version. As a working mom, I need shortcuts. this one is going in the permanent repertoire of recipes to impress!

...I can't figure out how to edit a review once submitted. The only thing I wanted to add is that I have found I prefer thyme to the tarragon - and I like to stick a bay leaf in with the lentils. It's fine with tarragon but I think it's better with thyme - earthier.

This has become one of my staples. Frickin' yum. I've made it exactly as written and it's great - and I've also accidentally messed up (and cooked the lentils/celery/carrot with the lentils, which looks unappetizing but is delicious) and there is just no way to make this taste bad. If you can't find the tiny French green lentils, make something else entirely, because it just won't work otherwise.

Used leftover lentils, forgot to put in the vinegar, threw in thyme instead of tarragon. Unexpectedly awesome.

I was disappointed with the results-- I did follow the recipe with the exception of substituting dried tarragon for the fresh. I might try it again with brown lentils (the green lentils were just too firm) and I might fold the spinach into the end product. It is certainly a healthy recipe--with the exception of the bacon--but it just couldn't earn more than 2 stars from me.

Since the fridge was running low, I subbed: sliced deli turkey for bacon, scallions for leeks, zucchini for celery, pesto for tarragon, mixed herbs and greens for spinach. Also, I poached the eggs instead of frying and served this for dinner. Even with these major substitutions it was still delicious. It leaves me thinking that if I made it as suggested it would be SPECTACULAR!

Use Boars Head Italian diced pancetta (1 slice -- 1/4" thick?). I used Trader Joe's pre-cooked lentils and used only a cup. Spinach on each plate (1 c), lentils & then 1 egg. Makes 2 servings. Incredible!

Outstanding! I love this dish, it's hearty yet elegant at the same time. The flavor combinations are wonderful. I steamed my spinach, poached the eggs, and left out the celery. I wouldn't worry about cooking the vegetables in the bacon fat. You're not doing it every day, so once a week or so is just fine. I think it's well worth it too, the vegetables will pick up the delicious bits of bacon left in the pan.

This was an excellent dish. Great flavor combinations, very filling. Couldn't find baby spinach, so skipped it. The lentil salad was excellent, could easily be used as a side dish for another meal. Also used a premade 'sofritto' mix (carrots, leeks, parsley, etc) from the supermarket and pulsed it in the food processor a few times. Saved a lot of time.

Found the anise flavor of the tarragon just wrong here. Awful, ruined the dish. But would like to try it again with maybe thyme instead.

Daaaang! This was outstanding and the combination of eggs+spinach+ french lentils+ bacon+leeks was unlike anything I've ever tried. I left out the carrots and celery because I don't like them. I am concerned about cooking the vegetables in bacon grease though - has anyone tried cooking them in vegetable oil instead?

yum! was forced to use thyme rather than tarragon, and sherry vinegar rather than red wine vinegar...and the recipe still turned out delicious. will make this again and again as a light supper.

This was a nice change of pace for breakfast, and it was interesting to try. I wouldn't serve it to guests though. (was prepared as directed) I like the neat textures with the lentils, vegetables and bacon. The spinach was nice and 1) added to the presentation and 2) wilted from the warmth and added another dimension. I liked the vinegar essence, and thought it could even be a bit stronger. It was a good hearty meal and I could see it being a good breakfast option in the winter before going back outside.

Very satisfying. I poached the eggs instead of frying them.

I absolutely love this dish. It's my one of my favorite things to make and eat when I'm home on my own. Shallots substitute nicely for the leeks.

Made this for a weeknight supper. Instead of the eggs, I topped it with some good quality grilled British sausages - perfect for a cold, rainy november evening

just what the heck is a 'lardon'?

Definately will make this again. I followed pretty much as written, but used only one egg per serving and used regular brown lentils because I didn't have the others on hand. I just made sure I didn't let them get too mushy...

This is a great recipe. It is also very flexible. I've made it several times. Sometimes with all the ingredients and othertimes with not much more than the lentils, eggs, and some herbs. Use your imagination and whatever is on hand, it will turn out just fine.

we make this all the time for a nutritous and simple supper. sometimes we use a little smoked salmon & fresh herbs mixed through after the lentils are cooked through for variation.

we don't eat pork but love all the other ingredients. i substituted mild italian turkey sausage for lardon. delicious but not one i would serve to company.

This the best lentil recipe that I have ever had the pleasure of making! I have made it twice now and am sure I will make it again and again. The french lentils are a must! And I love this website. Thanks!

This is so good. Use slab bacon (rind removed) to get closer to the taste of French lardons. I've made this a bunch of times and serve it with lightly toasted baguette slices rubbed with garlic and drizzled with olive oil. This is good stuff to have waiting in the 'fridge when you come home from work. Poach up an egg and dinner is served.

Delicious. Simple. You don't need so many eggs though.

This is a winner. My Brunch guests loved it.

This was spectacular for such a simple dish. The flavors just really worked nicely. I used 5 strips of bacon and slightly more lentils. Cooked the eggs over easy. This recipe is definetly going into the quick & easy twice a month rotation!

Very tasty and different - great as a simple supper. Would drain fat from the skillet when sauteeing the vegetables next time.
