Nice recipe yet I've issues with the balance of certain ingredients: too much ginger (even though I wuvvv the stuff) and a tad too much scallions for my sensibilities. I used store bought wonton wrappers which I ran thru a pasta machine to thin out out. All things considered I prefer Anita Lo's recipe on this site.
