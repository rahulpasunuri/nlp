I've made this once for a dinner party. It was a hit! Yes, peeling the eggs took some time but it was worth it. The olive paste and capers definitely have to go on top.

If you don't want to peel the little eggs, you could try using the canned kind... I've seen them in Asian supermarkets.

Let's face it- this dish is all about the cuteness of the wee eggs. Try it using chicken eggs and you get yawns, but use quail eggs and it's a crowd pleaser. That being said, they are tasty even if the flavors are basic. I'd make these again, but the eggs themselves are too liliputian to make a real mouthful. I think the tapenade needs to be spread on a toast round or cracker (or better yet, a mushroom cap), and the egg placed on top of that, crowned by the caper or even a bit of caviar or chopped cornishon. I'm sure many will say "They taste fine, but it's too much work to peel the quail eggs." The reward for your efforts comes when all the women at your party bill and coo over the eggs, while the men scarf them down like beer nuts.
