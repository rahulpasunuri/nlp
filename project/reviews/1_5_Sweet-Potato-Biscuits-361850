I'm a pretty good baker - but these didn't turn out well. I made them as sort of the sweet potato addition to my Thanksgiving buffet and no one took seconds or asked for the recipe. Great idea - but once put together (and I followed the recipe as written) they weren't so hot The Adventurous Foodie

Although I liked these biscuits, they were not a hit with my husband or daughter. I will not be saving these to my recipe box.

I'm not rating these, because I think I screwed up. I thought that whole wheat pancake mix was the same as whole wheat biscuit mix, because (a) you make both biscuits and pancakes from bisquick, right? and (b) I could not find anything specifically called whole wheat biscuit mix. At any rate, these turned out terribly. One of the worst things I have ever made. Like dog biscuits, but with less flavor. If I were you, I'd just go find another recipe.

was excited to see this recipe - until I read "biscuit mix" how disappointing! :(

NO SPOONS: "biscuit mix"! Really? I would have liked to make Sweet Potato Biscuits but it saddens me to see a boxed mix in an Epicurious recipe. On allrecipes.com I wouldn't blink but hardly up to par here.
