I loved this gorgeous dessert! A friend made it for my birthday, and I made it the same week for my relatives. I was concerned it would be too sweet, but it wasn't. Everyone just loved it.

Does look impressive. I used frozen dark cherries and Bonne Maman cherry preserves. I added almond extract to the custard as suggested. Overall taste was good but could have used some contrast (chocolate maybe?)Maybe the kirsch would have helped. Guests preferred the Pineapple/Rum Trifle Cake.

This is an impressive and very delicious dessert. I made it with straberry jam since I could not find cherry during winter, and I did add a layer of whipping cream. It was delicious. I will definitely make it again.

i made this trifle for the first time - changing from my old williamsburg receipe - this is now my absolute favorite - the absence of sherry made it perfect! so many raves and to me, easy - you just have to plan ahead - i made the cake and jam on 1 day and assembled the next and let sit in fridge overnight before serving - if you are a trifle fan then this is the one for you1 i would image that a berry/cherry combo for summer would be great as well as a peach or apricot!

Delicious! I'm not the type to get into long and involved dishes but this was worth the time and planning. Really a centerpiece dessert!

This was good. I took the suggestions of the past reviewers. I cut the sugar and added almond flavor to the cake 1/2 tsp and 1/2 tsp extract to the custard. I thought it was perfert and looked beautiful.

We are a trifle-loving family and this one is particularly tasty and a nice change from our usual strawberry. The custard, however, was nothing special and could even be replaced with an instant pudding mix (horrors!!). I added about a tsp of almond extract to the custard and it helped bring out the almond in the cake. I will definitely be making this dessert again.

very easy to make , good directions. Would like to try it with strawberries. Would make 1/4 more of the custard. Needed more when it came to the last layer. Would add more almond flavor to cake and in the custard.

I served this at a garden bridal shower, and it was the hit of the afternoon! Not only is the presentation fabulous (I used a large bowl similiar to the one in the picture), but the taste is incredible. The preparation time is definitely worth it!

The instructions were clear, concise, and easy to follow. The trifle, according to all those to whom it was served, was "to die for". It was colorful, delicious, and just about perfect. Having read a previous review, I decided to cut the sugar by 1/4 throughout - good decision! I also cut the cherries in half, rather than chopping coarsely - it was visually prettier.

Dessert making is a specialty of mine, yet, this was my first try at making trifles. The recipe was straight forward, and not difficult at all. I always love it when a dessert can be prepared entirely in advance, a must in this case. I will make this trifle again. A couple things, though. I did add some kirsh to the cherry jam, and also sprinkled some over the cake layers. Next time, I will cut down on the sugar. The trifle was too sweet for my taste, and several guests thought the same.
