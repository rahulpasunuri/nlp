I also forgot to mention below that this only yielded about 55 cookies for me - I even got the ruler out to measure each ball 1 inch and still didn't get 6 dozen. Still were great

Let me just say, I brought these to a party were there were a lot of people from Sweden and they LOVED THESE! They said they were exactly like at home. You really do need to get ammonium carbonate - it helps the cookies stay crisp for a long period of time - the stuff does stink to high heaven though! I couldn't find it in any pharmacy - I got it at a Greek store/market - apparently they use it alot in Greek baking. I also didn't have any problems with the dough being crumbly or dry - i wish for baking recipes that the weight of the ingredients, especially four, is included. A cup of flour can vary depending on how you scoop it. I always assume 1 cup of AP flour is 5 ounces (Cooks Illustrated is the only publication I know that includes weights.) Also, the cookies didn't get that "golden" for me - i feel like they can't get too dark in a 300 degree oven. These were great!

This is my favorite cookie recipe! Just one tip for anyone who likes to sample the unbaked cookie dough... don't. Actually, you may want to pass on smelling it. The ammonia scent and flavor is strong before baking.After baking.. a very delicious cookie!

for those who found the dough too dry and crumbly, just keep beating it! It will come together in a few more minutes. The results are certainly worth it.

Delicious. Light and crisp.

This is a nice change from standard shortbread cookies at Christmas. I made these at the last minute and had no idea where I would get ammonium carbonate from so I subbed baking powder (put in with flour & salt) with excellent results! I also skipped the chilling stage on one batch and they turned out exactly the same- save yourself some trouble! These turned out nice and crisp on the outside with an ever-so-slightly chewy centre. Yum! These will be a hit with those nut-a-phobics. Note: Make sure your butter is at room temperature when you begin-don't add eggs! Also, I used a very small disher/scoop to get even sized cookies.

Actually, I just need someone to tell me where to buy ammonium carbonate. Thanks!

My students made this recipe in Ethnic Foods class. They came out beautifully! The recipe was easy to follow, and the cookies melted in my mouth!

A cookie i"ll never miss baking for christmas or any other season...that's what i call these cookies, even my german grandmother-in-law loved it. Ok, the dough's kinda dry, i admit but still i won't forgo these cookies. Living in Germany, i dunno what's the equivalent of 1 cup...some american writers translate it to 8 oz. or 225g and some 16 tablespoons or 240g. So for this recipe, i would use 240g or 250g unsalted butter and when the dough is done, use the warmth of your hands to press the cookies together. It works, really!

These cookies ARE supposed to be crumbly when finished but under the original recipe it was difficult to get the dough to hold together. If egg is added it changes the result completely. Istead I would use 100 g butter, 100 ml oil, 300 ml sugar, 2 tsp vanilla sugar, 1 tsp ammonium, 400 ml flour. Mix butter, sugar, vanillasugar until smooth, then add oil a little at a time. Otherwise follow original direction. Drömmar takes some practise to turn out exactly right.

Nice delicate flavor. I also found the dough too dry to manipulate easily and the finished cookies were very crumbly. I will make them again, but probably add an egg to bind the dough better.

We made these cookies for our physical chemistry class--we had found a problem in our text several days before dealing with the use of ammonium (bi)carbonate as a leavening agent. The cookies were beautiful, buttery, and crisp; I think they were best eaten straight out of the oven when they were still a little chewy. In light of the "dough too dry" comments, we added a little less of the flour/salt mixture than recommended and this worked out very well. Try them!

These cookies are wonderful; simultaneously chewy and crisp with a great taste. I also found the dough to be hard to work with and very dry. I am going to try adding a yolk next time I make them. King Arthur's Flour (1-800-827-6836 or on the web at www.kingarthurflour.com) carries ammonium carbonate. They also have a recipe for sugar cookies that uses the product.

A friend baked this cookie for our annual Christmas cookie exchange at work, and I thought it was the best of the year. He found ammonium carbonate (baker's ammonium)at a drug store where, at first, he was told he needed a prescription. After learning the reason for the request, the druggist sold him a couple of teaspoons for one dollar. It is not the same as baking soda (sodium bicarbonate).

I loved the flaky tenderness and taste of these cookies BUT... The dough was so dry I had a difficult time trying to form the dough into balls. I finally added an egg white, which worked out okay. Had a hard time finding baker's ammonium... Someone read from a cooking dictionary it is the same as baking powder in the US. Is that correct?
