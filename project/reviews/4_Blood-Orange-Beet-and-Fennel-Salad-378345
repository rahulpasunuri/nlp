I made this dish a few times last year, and this year it's become in a good rotation! Great for a dinner salad, fancy potluck, or midweek lunch pick-me-up. It's a wonderful combination of flavors and textures.

This method for cooking beets is excellent - they turned the color of merlot and were tender and sweet. I made it with pears because that was what is ripe in the garden right now. All other ingredients were fresh from the garden and a nice, refreshing combination. I marinated the beets in the citrus juice and sea salt.

Made this a couple of weeks ago. It was wonderful as per the recipe! A couple of nights ago, I tried making a variant by adding some radishes and using a pomegranate dressing, even better.

Sooo good! I didn't do the fancy prep work either, just sliced all the beets and oranges...served it on a bed of wasabi leaves/greens, added pecans & cranberries. Because I added this salad to a bed of greens, I thought more dressing was in order,so I added Renee's Tangerine & Lime Vinaigrette...about 1/2 cup. I mixed the oranges, dressing and fennel(took the advice of others and used the whole bulb) ahead of time to meld the flavours and then assembled everything just before serving. Took this to a buffet dinner party and I could hear the raves throughout the room . . .hardly a leaf left on the platter!

Very refreshing! I made as the third course of a 7 course meal and it was great. Everybody loved it!

This was tasty, but all the fancy prep work seemed unnecessary. Next time, I'll cut the beets and oranges in the fastest way I know how -- comes out the same color anyway, you know?

This proved a memorable recipe for all the right reasons. The recipe was timely as blood oranges were just coming into season. I'd first tasted them years ago in Europe and fell in love w/ both the gorgeous color and taste--quite different from their cousins. Beets, once my least favorite veggie, roasted, are delicious in this salad. I tweaked your version only slightly, finishing w/ toasted hazelnuts and a drizzle of hazelnut oil, both of which I had on hand. It was a real showstopper. Beautiful colors/bright tastes. Thank you.

Delicious, but couldn't find blood oranges. Just used navel. Will try it again. Love the fennel, beet orange combination and the dressing.

i agree that there wasn't enough fennel, and i don't typically like raw fennel. the dressing was incredible and balanced the ingredients. let me warn you, it's a time intensive salad if you want to make it right...that said, it's worth it.

definitely a do over! next time I will add a little more fennel though - maybe a whole bulb instead of a half.

Fantastic refreshing salad. My husband rated it as one of his top salads (but he loves beets). Made it exactly as written but forgot the cilantro over the top when I served it which I regret because I love the taste of cilantro.

Made this for dinner yesterday with some salmon. Granted I didn't measure anything, and I added grapefruit and some balsamic, but the combination of citrus, beets, and fennel was delicious!
