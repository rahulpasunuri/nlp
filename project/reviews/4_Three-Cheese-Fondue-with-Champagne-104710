Make it as written. I have made this numerous times but neglected to review until now. The key is, use quality cheeses. It will cost you some money, but I know from experience that it is worth it. Why am I reviewing it just now? Because I am craving it big time, and I'm going to make it tomorrow again!

Quick, easy, and deliciousa definite keeperalthough 15 oz. of cheese is more like four servings than two. The leftover champagne is a great accompaniment for the dish. I had good success in following two commenters' advice: thinly slicing (rather than chopping) the shallot and mixing the cornstarch/lemon juice mixture with the grated cheese rather than adding it separately. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written. Good cheeses (and good champagne, I imagine) are key. Here's a tip for those who don't have a fondue pot on hand and use a nonstick pot instead: my husband suggested trying chopsticks instead of forks to avoid scratching the pot, and they worked beautifully.

This is my go-to fondue recipe. The only alteration is that I'd use slightly less shallot (1 large is a bit overpowering). We had leftover fondue this time...we cooled it (it solidifies quite a bit, becoming semi-soft), spread it on a crusty baguette, and added sliced apples. It was the yummiest "leftover" sandwich I've ever had!

Rating: 4
First "fun-due" I have ever made and will definitely be making it again! Used a prosecco instead of champagne & it tasted wonderful. Also used a buttery brie which worked well. Was nervous about the shallots but they were so mild and gave the cheese a wonderful flavor. Try this recipe, you won't be disappointed.

Very good fondue...the taste of the champagne is quite evident and delicious. The cheeses go very nicely together also. Served this as a New Year's Eve appetizer, and it was a hit!

Rating: 3
Very yummy! Guests enjoyed it very much. A bit lighter than other fondues, not sure if it's the champagne or the cheese mix. Take the rind of the Brie, or it will just float on the surface. Took a while to get all the cheese melted and needed more cornstarch/lemon mixture than stated in the recipe to have it all come together.

Rating: 4
This was delicious. Used white wine instead of champagne; everything else I used as listed. The consistency (eventually, after you stir a while) is perfect for fondue. The nutmeg really took it to another level. Quantity was perfect for 2.

Great fondue. It was the first cheese fondue I made. My husband and I ate it for Valentine's last year and made more the next day! I am making it for us and some friends this Valentine's day.

Very good fondue. We ate it with crusty wheat french bread, as that was all that was left on the shelf in our market the night before Thanksgiving. We used good cheese & Korbel Brut (not the best, I know) & it was really delicious. We ate pears, apples & grapes on the side but they weren't as nice as the bread in the cheese. Also, this is WAY too much for 2 people even as the entree! I would cut in half next time. We loved drinking the leftover champagne with dinner!

Every cheese that went into this was fabulous. The champagne was incredible. The fondue tasted -- there is no other way to describe this -- like foot. Furthermore, no amount of heating or stirring or cooling or leaving alone could make the ingredients combine smoothly.

I make fondues all the time, and this one was not a good one. The method was a bit off from your usual fondue recipe, and the flavours did not marry well.

I have found so many wonderful recipes on this site, and was thrilled to find yet another with such a high rating, but I was highly disappointed. I felt the flavor and consistency was too light for the time and money spent. About a month ago I made a simple fondue with different selections of aged gruyere (any combination works), shallots, 1 Cup of white wine, a little salt, sugar, and nutmeg, and it was superb - for a fraction of the price.

Rating: 4
So delicious and different is the flavor of this recipe, that I'm keeping it on file for special occasions. In the case of the previous 1-fork review, the champagne probably was too hot when the cheese was added and the fondue likely overheated and "broke." This means the milk solids and fat separated, resulting in a lumpy or grainy product. Don't be discouraged by "Bronxville's" review. Just make sure the temperature isn't too high when you add the cheese. I used garlic in mine, too.

This didn't work for me... it also came out too loose and the alcohol taste was overpowering. I ended up throwing out most of it, which was a shame since it was $30 worth of cheese. Will be looking for another cheese fondue recipe.

I made this recipe for a fondue dinner party in November and have made it two more times since - including for Christmas Eve. Everyone has LOVED it, even my kids. I agree with the previous review that the taste is directly related to the quality of the ingredients. I used flavorful imported cheeses and a dry French Champagne. Don't skimp on the shallots, they add wonderful flavor. I highly recommend this fondue, and I have made many types of fondue.

This fondue exceeded my expectations, even after having read the rave reviews. I made it for Valentine's Day, and it was sooooo delicious that we're planning on having it again next week to use up the mounds of extra dippers I prepared that didn't get eaten: bread cubes, broccoli, cauliflower, potatoes, green beans, mushrooms, mini sweet peppers, sausage, apples, and pears. I can't wait. It's really that good!!!

This is the best cheese fondue recipe I've come across. The champagne adds a lightness which combines well with the cheese and nutmeg. I used a brie that was very mild and rubbed my pot with garlic, which is traditional and adds a bite. I'll make this again and again for sure!

Made this for New Year's Eve. This was the best fondue I've ever made, though with a few changes to the techinque based on past experience. I rubbed the pot with a clove of garlic, and omitted the shallots. I tossed the corn starch in with the grated cheese to coat it, and substituted Kirsch for the lemon juice. All the cheese was imported, and of good quality, and the 'champagne' was an Alsacian Blanc des Blancs, which seemed appropriate for fondue. As written, the recipe easliy served 5 hungry people, with a bit left over. To dip, we had bread, cubes of steak, raw broccoli, cauliflower, mushrooms & baby carrots.

Rating: 4
I made this last night and everyone raved about it. I thought it tasted great and agree about chopping the shallots for presentation purposes. My guests kept eating the fondue even after it started to get cold. My local wine and cheese shop didn't have emmenthal so they recommended fontina, which I used. The recipe was very easy but be careful when you add the cornstarch. Mine didn't want to blend well so I had to whisk it furiously to smooth out the cornstarch lumps. I used the champagne and a few more bottles for champagne cocktails along with the fondue. Also, I doubled the recipe for 7 (hungry) people as an appetizer and should have left it as written because that would have been enough. I had to throw out alot of expensive cheese fondue.

This is an amazing recipe and gets rave reviews every time I make it! Making sure the shallots are coarsely chopped instead of minced makes all the difference in the world for presentation.

Serves 2, pretty generously I'd say (but we weren't complaining!) This is just a really good, solid fondue recipe. At one point we had to turn the heat up a bit as it started to separate, but it melted back to the right consistency, no problem at all.

Easy, delicious, and THE best fondue recipe I've tried. We only had bread and shitaki mushrooms for dipping, but was fabulous. Small boiled potatoes would also be good. We paired this dish with a great Belgian beer. This made our Valentine's Day!

Favorite fondue recipe ever, made it many times over the past 3 years. I alway serve it with lightly blanched veggies, roasted baby potatoes, apples, turkey sausage and the best bread I can find. And the rest of the champange always makes for a nice toast at the start of the meal.

Wow - this was fantastic! I prepared this for a special Valentine's day dinner and my husband and I couldn't get enough of it. It was great with green apples, brown bread, baby new potatoes and broccoli. We'll definitely make it again! I made it just as indicated in the recipe, but used top quality cheese and champagne (which I am sure makes a difference).

WOW. This was really really delicious. I made it as an appetizer course in a dinner for two- it was the best part of the meal.

I have made this twice now, and both times it has turned out perfectly. My husband made the fondue from this website made with roquefort cheese and mushrooms, but this was way better. I did add a pinch of thyme the last time I made it and it was a great addition. I will make this again and again!

I made this for a fondue party (we had about 30 guests) and it was a big hit. Fresh ground nutmeg really made a big difference and I would highly recommend using that. To accomodate the larger group, I grated the cheese in batches and stored them in their own baggies. I also stored the champagne and chopped shallots for each serving, separately in a baggie, as well as the cornstarch/lemon mixture. When the fondue started to run low, I could quickly just whip up another batch and pour it into the pot! Very easy!

I have been making cheese fondue for 20 years and this is the best ever!! Buy good quality cheese and you cannot go wrong. I used the exact quantities of cheese in the recipe but made a couple of other changes. I rubbed the pot with garlic before adding the champagne and eliminated the shallots. I also added two tablespoons of Williams (pear liquor) at the end -- a secret I learned from a fondue restaurant in Interlachen, Switzerland.

Heavenly.. Borrowed a friend's old oster fondue pot and made the entire menu from this old Bon Appetit issue, for Valentines. I did skimp on the quality of cheese (I substituted plain swiss for the gruyere)and it did not matter. The brie adds a note of complexity and goes so well with the champagne. My cheese seperated a little toward the end. Any professional fondue makers have a comment on how to avoid this?

Second year in a row that I have made this for a NewYear's Eve party and once again it was a big hit! Doubled the recipe for 12 people and used two loaves of French baguette and 3 granny smith apples (sprinkled with fresh lemon juice). I melt the cheese very slowly and it seems like it is just turning into a gloppy mess, but with patience, faith and a little extra stirring over low heat, it all comes together.

This is the only fondue I have ever made, so I don't have a basis for comparison to address the statements about quality made by some of the other reviewers. I can say I have made it several times and it has come out great every time. I agree that it feeds more than 2 people - I have made it for 4 and had some leftover.

Okay, here's the scoop - this (or any) fondue is only as good as the cheese you use. Far from my home of Portland Oregon - I spent the holidays in rural Wyoming and had to buy my Gruyere at Albertsons. It was virtually tasteless...thus my fondue was virtually tasteless. I've had this exact same fondue at a cooking club party in Portland and it was wonderful. So the moral of the story - buy the cheese and see if you love the flavor of it. If you do - you'll love this fondue. If you don't, you won't.

I followed this recipe exactly and it came out lumpy and it had a bitter after taste. I'm not sure if it's the cheese that made it taste like that but it was not good. My Husband and kid took several bites and that was it for them. I don't recommend this fondue recipe. Will have to find another one.

Okay, obviously I did something wrong. I thought I followed the directions perfectly, but after reading the 62 reviews, no one seemed to have the problem with consistency that I did. The flavor was wonderful, but it was way too thin. I had 7 people for dinner, so I doubled the recipe (had along with other things)...most of it was left over. It wasn't gooey like fondue is supposed to be...more the consistency of light cream. Any ideas on what I did wrong or how to correct it?

This is my favorite fondue recipe. I have a fondue party twice a year that has come rather legendary (30+ people). People LOVE-CRAVE-RAVE ABOUT the cheese fondue despite the availability of meat and fish fondues.

Would I make this fondue again? Yes, if I wanted to make a fondue that was easy to make and quick to prepare. No, if I wanted to "WOW!" my guests. While I highly recommend this fondue for the apprentice, it was, in my humble opinion, only mediocre at best. I am an avid maker of fondues (I own 4 pots) and though I might add this to my recipe collection because of it's ease and quickness to make, it will be rather low on the list.

I just made this for a New Year's Eve party and it was a huge hit. Everyone was crazy over it. I will definitely keep this recipe handy for any fondue party in the future.

I have made this several times now. It is really simple and always turns out perfectly. I like that the flavor is not all overpowering cheesiness; the champagne adds really nice depth.

Served it with pumpernickel bread and apples, and the same champagne I used in the recipe. Delicious, decadent, and only about 30 minutes work. Couldn't be better.

It was so good and it was gone so quickly that my 24-year-old daughter ran out to the grocery store to get the ingredients for another batch. I served it with apple slices, broccoli, cauliflower, and bread. If this is accompanied by other dishes it might serve 4, but as the only item 2 is a more accurate number.

I love fondues and make it fairly frequently. While I have had several different kinds over the years this one has been a mainstay at my table since I discovered the recipe a year and a half ago. It is so rich and delicious and has a greater dimension of flavour than many others I have tried. The only change I make is to substitue a bit of fresh ground black pepper for the white. This gives it a few black specks but superior flavour in my opinion. I highly reccomend this recipe for any occasion!

This was an OK fondue, good but not exceptional. It was a little disappointing after reading the rave reviews. A point of info for those with problems with the consistency of their fondue. Fondue gets stringy if too cool and separates if too hot. For best results, bring to the proper temperature slowly so as not to over-shoot the mark, being sure to stir constantly. If it overheats and separates, simply remove from heat and STIR, STIR, STIR until it comes back together. Return it to a lowered flame and it should stay smooth.

We first made this recipe on New Years Eve - as part of our romantic dinner for two. It quickly became a favorite we decided to serve to friends as either aN appetizer/first course, or entre. It must be a success since they never seem to leave without the recipe. The champagne & shallots give this fonue a wonderfully unique flavor which is excellent w/bread & even works w/potatoes & other vegetables. I agree that a very dry champagne works best - I also suggest using fresh grated nutmeg. THIS RECIPE IS A KEEPER - a true 4 fork recipe.

One of the very few recipes I've rated as a full four forks on epicurious! This was an excellent cheese fondue. The flavors were mild and it just didn't seem as heavy as many fondues tend to be. My only recommendation would be to use a VERY dry champagne to maximize flavor, and maybe even use a little extra and then boil it down longer in the beginning. Enjoy!

The swiss fondue do not contain lemon juice,brie or champagne. If you want call three cheese fondue you need to have gruyere, emmenthal, vacherin Fribourgeois (Fribourg State)and a dry swiss wine Fendant. Thats why when you go to the restaurant you order a plate on the menu, but what you got is not what you are expecting because the traditional recipe are modified.

Decided to make this on a day when I couldn't take time to shop for exact cheeses called for. So, used brie, fontina and a nice creme havarti and doubled the recipe. There being 4 small shallots on the window ledge, that's what I used. Result? Absolutely great!

I've made this recipe five times since the issue came out, and it's been perfect every time. I love the shallots and thought a large one was just right, but it's a matter of taste. I particularly like the fact that this version of cheese fondue doesn't seem to want to separate as many others do. Make plenty -- the kids love it, too, since it's milder than most.

Excellent! We will make this again! Would advise using only 1/2 of a large shallot or a very small one, as we used only a little and it seemed to be just right. Also, make sure and use the correct cheeses as called for in the recipe - don't substitute with "regular" swiss. Serve with vegetables too - carrots, cauliflower. Good stuff.
