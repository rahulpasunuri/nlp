REALLY GOOD. I needed a cream cheese frosting for pumpkin muffins. I used only 1.5 cups confectioners sugar per other reviews and it was still very sweet. I also added a dash of salt. I used almond extract but can see how this also would be good with vanilla. You can't go wrong here. So simple and delicious.

I followed the recipe exactly. Too sweet. Next time I will decrease the sugar called for.

MMM Yummy. I made with neufchatel, almond extract and almond milk (because that's what I had). I only used 1 1/2 C sugar and they were still quite sweet. Made enough to frost 16 chocolate cupcakes.

This is a great, easy, but still sophisticated frosting. My 2 1/2 year old son and I made this to top some vanilla cupcakes, then we sprinkled coconut on top. I used vanilla instead of almond, but I'd like to try the almond/chocolate combination next time.

This in one of my favorite frostings for a chocolate cake. Rich and creamy, easy to prepare and the light almond flavor paired with the chocolate always elicits compliments.

This was simple. I made it to cover chocolate cupcakes for my 1st-grader's class. I didn't have almond, so I had to use vanilla, which was lovely. I would like to try almond sometime, but wanted to let folks know that vanilla worked well too. This recipe handily frosted 24 cupcakes.

I loved this recipe. Not only was it VERY easy, but it has a wonderful rich taste. I made it to ice my daughters birthday cookies for her class and even the kids loved it. Then I did her birthday cake and EVERYONE raved. So easy - so good. This is a keeper!
