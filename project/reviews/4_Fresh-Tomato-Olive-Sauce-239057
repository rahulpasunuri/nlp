This has been my go to recipe this summer. We've had it as a pasta sauce, bruschetta topping, over grilled swordfish and my favorite on a toasted baguette with fresh ricotta. I've never used plum tomatoes. A few times I made with a mix of grape and cherry tomatoes cut in half. Other times with heirloom tomatoes from my CSA. I never used so much olive oil. And I've never had fresh oregano so I've just used dried. I'm addicted.

This sauce was so good and fresh. Followed the recipe for the most part, but did not have fresh oregano, so used basil instead. Turned out great. Had it on top of penne with a little feta. Had some left-overs and ate it for lunch the next day and the flavors were even better. I will defenitely make this again.

This sauce was so easy and super- delicious. Packed with flavor! I grilled halibut filets and used this as a topping. I eyeballed the ingredients to cut it in 1/3 to feed two people. Instead of plum tomatoes, which I don't think are ever very good from the grocery, I used vine- ripened tomatoes and seeded them. Also, I chopped the tomatoes roughly instead of slicing into wedges, which I thought made the sauce to "bulky."
