Quite simply one of the best dishes I've ever made. Wouldn't change a thing.

I've made this several times with mint and with cilantro. Mint is definitely better and more unique, but cilantro will do in a pinch. Great flavors and pretty easy to make with the Mexican rice linked here.

This has to be one of our favourite recipes so make it frequently. If I cannot get fresh mint I cheat and add a spoonful of bottled Colemans mint - not mint sauce - might be hard to find in the U.S. As much as I love cilantro/coriander I think mint is essential for this dish. As we spend a lot of time in Spain I then add some chopped chorizo and sliced canned/jar roasted red peppers to the sauce as well. Sometime when I have frozen leftovers the meatballs seem to fall apart but no problem as it makes a great pasta sauce.

I prob shouldn't b reviewing this as I made with ready made meat balls and this is essentially meat balls in a chilly tomato sauce. Next!

Loved it - Thoughts & Comments: #1) Get the best white rice you can, Minute Rice just isn't going to cut it. #2) Reduce your sauce a bit BEFORE you add the meatballs and the whole thing cooks faster. #3) Add Chipotle or Ancho chiles if you want more depth, but don't cut the Serranos out. #4) The spiciness is directly related to the amount of reducing time. Taste your sauces people.

Excellent meatball recipe. I was leery about adding the fresh mint but I did and so glad I did. It added a really nice freshness to the meatballs. The sauce is outstanding and definitely would work over pasta as well. I would make this again.

I don't make the sauce with this, but I had to say that the meatballs here make a great accompaniment for marinaras of most any kind, and they can be tweaked to your heart's delight. I have been using fresh bison meat (leaner, gamier tasting) and this turns to died-and-gone-to-heaven once I add finely chopped apples to the mix (2 apples per pound of meat in general). I don't use as much mint as it calls for, but that's mostly because I put it in more Italian-style marinaras and don't think a minty meat would quite fit how I do the sauce. Anyway, I took the "mistake" advice of the reviewer before who baked the meatballs-fantastic! Yes, there was a flat side, but wow, sooo tender, and I can add them when and where I want this way. The meatballs would also be fantastic, whole or crumbled, in a creamier sauce. It's definitely a winning recipe, and with bison meat in particular, I have no runny greasy stuff at all. This is my new standard for making meatballs. I don't think I could even consider another recipe after having people's faces distort into this giddy happy child expression every time!

Got up nice and early to start this dish in the morning so that I had time to do all my running around. Maybe a bit too early! I totally misread the amount of tomatoes to use in the sauce!! Instead of 4 14.5 ounce cans of diced tomatoes I only bought 1 large can and used 1/4 of it in the meatball mixture and 3/4 of it in the sauce. I made the sauce first and when I tasted it I thought it was really quite hot! (I added extra chiles since some of the reviews said that the sauce was mild!!) Mind you I loved it, but i didn't want to go ahead and cook the meatballs in a sauce that hot, so I put the balls in a roasting pan with a litle bit of the sauce and cooked at 350 for 20 minutes (in two batches). Wow..they were so tender and flavourful. (I added cilantro along with the mint...mmm) Then I reduced the sauce till quite thick and let it cool. I will now go out and get some more tomatoes (along with margarita fixings!) and when I reheat to serve, will do so in a sauce that will be a little less explosive. But I will reserve some of that serrano sauce as it is to serve with tacos or other yummy treats!

This is an OOoooold recipe, used by many Mexican Grandmothers, including mine. The diference is we use Chipotle chile instead of serrano. Chipotle has a smokey flavor and is very tasty. This sauce base is also the same we use for "Huevos Ahogados" which is our version of poached eggs.

This was a very straight-forward recipe; the flavours were very delicate and the meatballs very juicy. I replaced the breadcrumbs with wheat bran and used lean sussages (500gr) instead of minced pork. Also as a previous reviewer suggested used parsley in place of mint (have a big crop of it growing in our backyard)... Can't waite to have the leftover tonight!

Ammendments I made: 1) Using whole grain instead of white bread worked perfectly fine. 2) Blackening a red bell pepper with the serranos and garlic, and blending it into the puree added dimension to the sauce. 3)Omitting the porc and using plain beef worked well. 4) Serving it with basmati rice is great. I really enjoyed this recipe! It's simple, inexpensive, and very easy to make variations upon. It was even spicier and tastier the day after making it. The best part is definitely the mint, but I like the others' suggestion of using cilantro and will try that next time. (Once all the meatballs had been eaten, I added to the left over sauce some chicken stock, the remaining rice, and a bunch of veggies, and this made a delicious and hearty soup.)

A great recipe that is also wonderfully easy to adapt. Have used just pork mince and cilantro (double quantity) instead of mint and it comes out brilliantly as well. Extra chili in the sauce can give it a real bite.

I am making this for the second time tomorrow. It is delicious. I used Burgundy Pasture grass fed ground beef, and no pork, and omitted the mint and used parsley instead. I also doubled the serranos because we like the spice. I highly recommend the rice also.

I think you definitly should double the garlic. Also, I don't know if the chilis I used were more mild than usual, but I did not really taste or feel any heat from them. Next time I'll increase and probably double. We served as an appetizer.

I've never made meatballs before, and absolutely love this recipe. I used jalepeno peppers and cilantro since I didn't have the serrano or mint. It came out great and I highly recommend anyone to make it. I will definitely make it again.

Very good. Slightly spicy tomato sauce.

This dish is so good it's worth the extra time it takes to make it. I love the addition of mint in the meatballs..it really makes the dish. I will be making this again!!

I was in a hurry for a quick appetizer, so I made this using purchased meatballs, and adding a little bit of fresh mint to the sauce while cooking. I served it without rice - just in a dish with cocktail forks. It was quite good and very easy.

This took longer to make than expected but it was definitely worth it. I made quite a few substitutions based upon what I actually had available in the kitchen. I used ground turkey for the ground meat and parsley for the mint and whole grain bread instead of white. I'd probably used canned tomatoes in the meatballs next time around to save some prep time. Reducing the sauce took a little longer than the recipe indicated...more like 35 minutes.

This is a fantastic recipe, a definite keeper. I substitute cilantro instead of mint (mint seemed out of place) and jalapeños instead of serranos. I have also halved the recipe with success. Construction of the meatballs takes a bit of time, so make them in advance if possible. I also use my immersion blender to puree the chiles and garlic, then just stir it in to the tomatoes (I use the 28 ounce can of diced tomatoes). Less work, less mess and was just as tasty. This goes perfectly with the Mexican Rice.

The combination of flavors in this dish is wonderful! I too used cilantro instead of mint, but followed the rest of the recipe to the letter. Next time I might add couple more serrano chiles and extra garlic, but it was delicious as prepared. I may also add a half cup of beef stock to tone down the tomato sauce. I should have prepared the meatballs and sauce in the morning as the construction is time consuming. I served over Mexican Rice as suggested, which really made the dish. This became an instant favorite.

After the first time and loving it, I tried to make the sauce alone. It turned out poorly. Fantastic recipe!

I loved these meatballs! The meat itself is full of flavor and doesn't depend on the sauce for flavor. I used 2 lbs of beef instead of both beef and pork. Also used cilantro instead of mint just because I had some in the fridge already. Also, I couldn't find any serrano chilies so I used jalapeno peppers instead. I only used 2, but will definitely use more next time. I served these as subs. Everyone loved them!

This was absolutely fabulous and not hard to make. This from a person who hates meatballs. They were yummy! Will definately make again. Would not change a thing about this recipe. Made it with the recommended mexican white rice and it was fab! Thanks Epicurious. From a CPA in tax season-that's how easy and quick it is!!!!

This was a great recipe. It went especially well with the mexican white rice. The sauce was wonderfully spicy. A definate keeper.

My fiance and I love this recipe. I added the bay leaf as suggested and used 4 peppers. Next time I will use three, as it was very spicey. I will definitely make these again.

I was very apprehensive about this recipe, but went with it. I am glad I did! Very good, I did use mild peppers (carbanerra) I think these were to mild! Next time I would use hotter ones! I also made it and let it simmer for about 3 hours. Very good recipe, I would make it again!

I am new to cooking with chiles and chose to make this recipe exactly as written. These were delicious meatballs. Next time I would probably use 2-3 chiles only and one egg. The meatball mixture when first made is a little loose and looks scary. But once formed, and chilled, the meatballs cook perfectly in the sauce. Give it a try, you will enjoy it for sure.

I use bolillo (french roll), not white bread. The egg is really optional. You must cook the meatballs in the tomato broth, it's essential for the flavor. Also, I add about 1/2 tsp of cumin, 2 cloves, 1/2 tsp of marjoram and a bay leaf to the sauce. I fry the sauce, as is traditional, before adding the meatballs. I do not use tomatoes in the meatballs themselves.

Tried this recipe as an appetizer by making the meatballs smaller and everyone loved it! I used crackers instead of white bread and had no sea salt but regular salt and it was still very good. I didn't let the meatballs cook in the sauce though but I baked them instead and placed them in the sauce as the crock pot kept them warm through the whole party. Will definitely make again with a bit more garlic!

Fairly time consuming but very good. Perhaps not something I'd whip up for a monday night dinner but good. The sauce took longer to reduce than the recipie mentions, just an FYI.

I used this recipe as part of a Fiesta table with friends, it is a very good dish
