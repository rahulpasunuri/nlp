This is a really good recipe. I made a few tweaks as per previous reviewers suggestions. Added the brown sugar and increased the amounts of lemon grass and ginger and used green curry paste. One tip when using fresh lemon grass. peal away some of the top layers of the grass to reveal the more tender parts of the stalk. Bruise with with a mallet to release some of the aromatics and then chop. I also pulsed my chicken in the food processor to make it less chunky. Also used chicken breasts for the leaner meat. Served this over jasmine rice. My entire family loved it. Will make again for sure.

Again this was DELICIOUS when I made it last night on top of the stove. After reading some of the newer reviews, I decided to sub Thai Red Curry Paste for the curry powder, but accidentally used Red Curry SAUCE for the paste. What a waste of sauce! Still had to add 2+ Tbs. of dry curry powder to bring out the curry flavor. Also, to cut some fat, subbed half 2- percent cows milk for half of the coconut milk, added a half tsp. sugar and a small handful of coconut. Like other reviewers, added a sliced small red bell pepper, subbed grated lemon peel for the lemon-grass, and added a good splash of fish sauce, but only 2 Tbs. lime juice. Cant wait for the leftovers!!! YUMMY!!!

This recipe is absolutely delicious. I added mushrooms, fish sauce and red chili paste, as previous cooks recommended. Will definately make again.

I loved this soup! I read over all of the other reviews before I went to purchase the ingredients and was happy I did so. I added the brown sugar and mushrooms. I think I would have preferred a mix of white meat and dark meat chicken. I will definitely make this again.

This was exceptional. I followed a previous review and added red bell peppers, mushrooms, and julienned carrots to make it more of a meal. Suggestion: Use Trader Joe's pre-marinated Curried Chicken. It adds that much more flavor! I didn't use the pressure cooker, just on the stove top - still fantastic. I can't wait to make this again!

I used chicken breasts, green thai curry paste instead of curry powder, thai basil instead of spinach leaves, and served over ginger lemongrass jasmine rice...outstanding

I had this over brown rice...made a few of the changes other people did based on what I had (shrimp instead of chicken, a few tbsp. brown sugar, added a green chile, light on the lime)...it was so good I could hardly believe it, sent email to my friends/family right away. With all of the different curry variations out there and so many other veggies and meats I could add to this basic recipe, this is a keeper for SURE. Note: quartering the lemongrass instead of mincing is good, but if it'll cook into the soup through cheesecloth like the cook from New Delhi suggested, that's the way I'd go...straining mine out strained out more of the chopped onion than I'd have liked. I can't wait to have this for leftovers today!

This dish was terrific!! Following the numerous suggestions of other reviewers, I made these changes: I didn't have a pressure cooker, so I just simmered coarsely chopped lemongrass and ginger in the chicken broth/coconut milk for about 45 minutes. I used green curry paste instead of curry powder, and added 1 Tbsp each of brown sugar and fish sauce. All excellent suggestions from previous cooks - thank you! After 45 minutes, I strained out the lemongrass and then added julienned carrots, quartered baby bella mushrooms, and bell pepper strips in addition to the baby spinach leaves and chopped scallions called for in the recipe. At the last minute I added tiger shrimp and let them poach. I garnished it with the chopped cilantro. WOW! I know this all sounds like a significant departure from the original recipe, but it really isn't - I just added a bunch of vegetables in order to make this a meal in a bowl. I will definitely make it again, with chicken, with fish, with anything! (Can you imagine this over a beautiful halibut fillet?)

I took the advice of some previous cooks and altered the recipe a little. I substituted curry powder with Thai red curry paste, used Thai basil instead of cilantro, and added some red and yellow peppers. It turned out really good! This was my first time cooking with coconut milk and after simmering for a while, it seemed like the milk separated. I don't know if this is normal or not, but it still turned out good. I served mine over rice and it made delicious leftovers.

Good recipe just needs a few things added to make it 4 stars...potatoes, carrots, garlic(lots!) extra ginger, and use chicken breast meat. I like to have some french bread or sourdough on the side...realllly yummy!!

Feeling fully confident from the ingredients of this recipe I made it for new guests. Wow! Better than I expected. Only change, substituted the chicken for large tiger shrimp, steaming them first adding them last. And yes, it IS better the next day after all the flavors have enfused. Also, would recommend adding the onions at the last minute to retain their fresh taste. A note about lemongrass, you can buy a puree in a tube at almost any supermarket in the produce section. It freezes for up to 2-3 months.

Yummy!! I used equal parts chicken broth and (lite) coconut milk, used some leftover boneless chicken which I cut into small pieces, and also added fresh mushrooms and cayenne pepper. Really delicious!! Especially with the fresh cilantro!!

Wow! This is a fabulous soup...the flavors are just incredible. Thanks to previous reviews, I made a few changes. Added a splash of fish sauce, used Thai red curry paste in lieu of curry powder, added sliced fresh mushrooms, and a T. or so of brown sugar. Also, added rice noodles the last 10 minutes. I didn't have the time to drive 25 minutes to buy lemongrass, so substituted lemon zest and a strip of lemon peel. Also, did this stovetop, which didn't take that long. This is an outstanding recipe, and I can't wait to have the leftovers tonight. Thanks Epicurious!

Great dish! Like the cook from Mukiteo, WA, we added extra veges...carrots, galangal, peas (first)...baby corn and mushrooms (after 10 min. or so)...green peppers (at the end with fresh basil and liime leaves) but perhaps use red for better color...used two cans of delicious coconut milk...a bit of fish sauce adds a great flavor. We just threw the chicken, raw, directly into the pot (cut by our friendly neighborhood butcher into 2 inch cubes, using an ingenious knife-between-the-toes technique!) with the vege broth, coconut milk, and lemongrass and it cooked perfectly...no pressure cooker, just a pot with lid...Tak added a few green chiles, too, but be cautious if you're not a spicy-wallah! Also, not too much lime juice...perhaps just wedges to serve at the table. Huge success and better the next day!

This soup is wonderful but I did make some changes.Used 4 cups of the broth(each small can contains 2 cups) Then upped the coconut milk by half a can.Added Fish Sauce, Green Curry Paste,Brown Sugar, Red Bell Pepper, Sliced Crimini Mushrooms, Sugar Snap Peas and Minced Garlic.I prepared it on the stove top as I do not own a pressure cooker.Put in the first 6 ingredients plus the curry paste and garlic and simmered for 45 min. then added the rest of the ingredients to taste.BIG TIP: Sliced the lemongrass down the center, cut it into thirds, and then added it.It is a pain to pick it out before serving but not nearly as awful as trying to chew it up while your enjoying this fabulous soup.Next time I will wrap it in a piece of cheese cloth.I also used Basil instead of Cilantro as that is what I had on hand.The Green Curry Paste is very hot so start with a half tablespoon then add to desired heat.We really love this soup on a cold winter night.Opps! the lime juice seemed to be heavy handed.Added 2 T. and passed lime wedges at the table. ENJOY !!!

This was simply great! Definitely a keeper. The chicken cooked perfectly. (I tend to overcook meats.) If you don't have a pressure cooker, I think having a meat thermometer and cook just right seems to be the key. Next time I'll try boneless skinless thighs to save my time.

I don't own a pressure cooker, so I made it in the crock pot and let it simmer for several hours. It was absolutely delicious. We had leftovers that I boiled down a bit and served over rice. My husband preferred it that way, although I preferred it as a soup.

This recipe was good. I used one entire breast (about 1 1/2 lbs) cut into eighths and the powdered lemongrass and yellow curry powder that I make from an Indian cookbook recipe. My husband suggested adding fresh onion shreds as garnish along with the cilantro and that was good. Next time I will try it with the red Thai curry paste.

Fantastic! My 8 year old thought it was too spicy, but the adults thought perfect. I don't have a pressure cooker so I simmered it for about 50 minutes. Grating took too long so I just quartered the stalks and removed when finished. Lemon grass paste sounds like a good alternative. Next time I used lemon zest and it was fine. Served with stir fry, which made a good combo leftover.

Great Soup!!! Use the Red Curry, it gives the soup a great kick on top of adding excellent flavor. I opted not to use brown sugar, but added carrot matchsticks with the spinach. Add a few splashes of Fish Sauce for a more authentic Thai flavor. I served the soup over asian cellophane noodles. Traditionally, Asians serve soup with noodles (of any type, whatever you prefer) rather than rice. I will make it again and again. By the way the pressure cooker is a HUGE timesaver!

Due to all of the reviewers, this soup was amazing! I used red curry paste, 1 T brown sugar, simmered the first 6 ingredients and the chicken for 1 hour, quartered the lemongrass and discarded it afterwards, added red peppers and straw mushrooms and served the soup over rice. ALL suggestions from other reviewers. This is what makes this site so valuable. Thanks for a great hearty meal! ...by the way, I think the cilantro is crucial to this dish.

I read the reviews and thought I'd try this, and I'm glad I did. This is now in my file of recipes to make over again. I didn't have a pressure cooker, but after this soup, I'm getting one, as it could only make the recipe better than it already was.

Really looking forward to preparing this soup... it sounds so much like the one I love my my fav. Thai rest. Re. lemongrass: at the restaraunt it is served in 1-2" pcs. as a flavoring, much like a bay leaf. It in NOT meant to be swallowed, but I don't think it's harmful if it is.

Excellent! I combined the chicken and first 6 ingredients in a large pot and simmered for an hour. I reduced the curry to 2 TBLS and eliminated the cilantro (personal taste). If you can't find fresh lemon grass, look for lemon grass paste. This is a rich, tasty soup.

I was really leery about making this, as I have never used THAT MUCH curry powder in one recipe, OR coconut milk, OR even lemon grass. But, since most reviewers said it was very good, I gave it a try. And was I surprised--this is one of the best soups I have ever made!!! My husband says that this is the chicken soup he wants when he gets the flu this winter!!! MANY THANKS TO THE REVIEWERS!!! I used 2 lbs. of thighs (weight before skinning and de-fatting), extra green onions, extra fresh ginger root, about 1/3 cup of thinly sliced red bell pepper (and it could have used more), and 7 oz. of regular (slightly torn) spinach. At the end I only added 2 Tbs. of lime juice, 1 Tbs. of brown sugar, and a little salt. I totally forgot the cilantro, and it didn't seem to matter. Used a stockpot, and it sure made the house smell wonderful. My only problem was the lemon grass--at the store I could only find this dehydrated, super tough, stalky stuff in a plastic baggie. I sliced 1 Tbs. of it into smaller pieces as best I could with a serrated knife (nothing else worked), but it still remained stalky in the final product. My husband didn't mind, but I found it irritating. Any suggestions on how to soften that stuff would be appreciated. Thank you. (P.S. My green onions totally disintegrated, but they imparted their flavor to the soup so I didn't care.)

WOW! Easy, quick, inexpensive to make, and tastes wonderful. It doesn't get better! Loved this soup. I also put a scoop of rice (brown basmati) in the center of the bowl --> with bread, this made for a meal. I also added the suggested two tablespoons of brown sugar. Great Soup!!

This soup was great. I took the advice of other reviewers and substituted spinach for straw mushrooms. I used red Thai curry and I didn't have any lemongrass so I used some lemon rind. I used the light coconut milk and put in Thai basil instead of Coriander. The result was a delicious authentic tasting Thai soup with some good kick! Will definately make again.

I used 3/4 of a can of coconut milk( I wanted to reduce the calories!) added straw mushrooms and also did not use a pressure cooker for the chicken. I brought it to a potluck dinner and got GREAT reviews. I will definately make it again!

I'll definitely try this again, with some modifications. I used light coconut milk this time and regretted it -- we wanted it richer. And I think the lemongrass paste would be a good idea. Plus my husband wanted some more kick -- so either spicier curry powder or add some red pepper. I didn't have a pressure cooker and the thighs took a long time to cook -- maybe 45 minutes and by that time the onions etc were dark green and not too pretty. I did add some sliced white mushrooms and those were good. I might try a tablespoon of brown sugar or something to soften up the tartness, too.

This is for the NM request. Lemon grass can be substituted with grated lemon rind or a thin strip of lemon rind if the lemon grass is to be left whole, from The Complete Asian Cookbook by Terry Tan. This sounds like a good soup, but I prefer asian curries and would use red or yellow curry paste for the curry powder. That would kick it up a notch. Lemon grass is lighter and sweeter tasting than lemons, though. Still, Terry Tan helps.

I guess I was expecting something a little more Thai flavored and wasn't that impressed. When I re-heated the leftovers I added 2 tsp chili paste (this helped a lot) & brown sugar, but it still wasn't something I'd bother with again. The only positive thing that came out of it was the fact I got a good dose of vitamins from the spinach.

Question for those who made this: I got to the verge of making this, and openned the can of coconut milk, and found it did not smell coconutty. Is this how it is supposed to be? Thought that maybe my can was "off." If that is how it should be, what does the coconut milk add to the recipe? Thanks much.

Rating: 4
This was WONDERFUL! I doubled the amt. of chicken thighs(they were on sale) and my pressure cooker is bigger than called for, so next time I'll add perhaps another cup of broth. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing. The flavors blend and compliment each other so well. If you don't have a pressure cooker, I'm sure simmering for a period of time (or a crockpot, even) would work as well.

I must have done something wrong, as mine turned out quite tart, and all other reviews deemed it excellent. I don't have a pressure cooker, but that wasn't the problem. I tried to soften the flavor by adding cream, which helped but still too much lime flavor. I would love to try the dish again, but I think I'll cut back the lime juice to just one tablespoon. Any suggestions other than that?

Rating: 3
I made this more of an authentic Tom Kha by omitting the spinach and ading straw mushrooms, bamboo shoots at the beginning and some thinly sliced red pepper toward the end. If you prefer white meat chicken, boneless breasts work great (add whole as recipe directs, dicing later). Try Thai green curry paste and a splash of fish sauce instead of curry powder for even more authenticity. As good as any Thai restaurant! And regarding the pressure cooker debate: does anyone think there are any real benefits to using a pressure cooker besides less cooking time?

One of the first pieces of kitchen equipment I got when starting out 26 years ago was a pressure cooker from my mother who used hers all the time. Being raised in a household where it was used at least weekly for several of my favorite dishes, I couldn't envision a kitchen without one. Just remember, no frothing vegetables such as beans or other legumes as they can clog the steam vent and lead to disaster. It sure beats a microwave when it comes to in a hurry meal preparation.

This was delicious and easy to make. Like the other reviewers, I made it without a pressure cooker -- just simmered the soup with a lid on for about 20 minutes until the chicken was well cooked. I also added a sweet potato, in chunks, mid-way through the simmer, which was excellent, plus more ginger. Lastly, I followed another suggestion and added about 1-1/2 Tbsp of sugar (turbinado in my case). I served it over rice. Overall -- a hit in our household.

This recipe is truly awesome. I don't have a pressure cooker, so I simmered the first 6 ingredients in a regular stock pot covered for about 1 hour on very low. Then I let it cool overnight, chopped up the chicken the next day, put it back in to simmer for about 20 minutes, and finished it with the spinach, lime and cilantro. Served it in a shallow soup bowl with a scoop of steamed basmati rice in the middle and ladled the soup around it. Delicious.
