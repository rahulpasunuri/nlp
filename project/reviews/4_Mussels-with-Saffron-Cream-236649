This was wonderful!!! Did add more saffron... probably 3-4 pinches total. Quick & delicious week night meal!

Made this for a quick lunch last Wed. when my sisters were passing through town, only change I made was to add about 2 cloves of minced garlic. It was so good I am making again for dinner with a friend on Monday. The flavors all blend beautifully.

This is restaurant quality! It's very easy too. I used shallots instead of onions, added garlic, and up the saffron until the color got to golden yellow. YUM!

I have made this recipe over and over again and it is a family favorite. We use frozen mussels (fresh not available) and add the liquor so we omit the salt - we also sub shallots for the onions. Anyway - the real thing I wanted to add is this. I am always just sick to throw out the left-over saffron cream sauce! I have come up with a great next-day recipe that is wonderful. When we have company we make two big pots of these mussels so we have a lot of sauce left over. The following recipe makes a perfect brunch dish. Enjoy! --- Day After Mussels - Saffron Seafood Strata---- 8 X-large eggs, 2 cups Saffron Mussels cream sauce (stir well), 2 - 6.5 oz cans Millers Lump Crabmeat or fresh if available, 8 cups cubed bread crust removed (I used cobblestone), ½ cup grated parmesan, Salt and pepper to taste ----- Preheat oven to 350o Butter the sides and bottom of a 10 inch springform pan. Wisk eggs and mussel cream sauce in a large bowl Gently add lump crabmeat and mix gently Add cubed bread to egg mixture and toss gently with hands Season lightly with salt and pepper Transfer egg/cream/bread mixture to springform pan Place springform pan on a cookie sheet in case of leakage Cook for an hour or until golden brown and puffed Half way through cooking sprinkle with grated parmesan Remove from oven and cool 5 minutes then remove springform edge Cut into wedges and serve!

Excellent recipe. I prepared exactly as written but added 2 finely chopped garlic cloves with the onion. I'm glad I added the garlic. Since it's an essential ingredient, just be aware that it takes quite a bit of crumbled saffron threads to equal a rounded 1/4 teaspoon. I used a whole $12 jar of Morton and Basset saffron threads... it still wasn't enough (the jar contains very little) and needed additional saffron from my spice cabinet.

WOW WOW WOW Absolutely amazing. Lush, gorgeous, delicious and so very simple! I followed the recipe exactly and had a truly gourmet dinner for less than $15 (including a simple green salad with orange segments and toasted almonds) This is my favorite Epicurious.com recipe!

I adore this recipe! It is so simple, looks so elegant and tastes extraordinary. I've made it a number of times now, and every time it comes out perfectly.

Wow !! Made this last night as an appetizer for my hubby and I. Since my husband doesn't like mussels, I figured that I would get to have a second helping....unfortunetly for me...he absolutely loved them!!! Now he has asked me to serve them on a regular basis. I can hardly wait to make them again. The only change to the recipe that I made was to add about 2 sml or 1 large clove of garlic. Like one of the other reviewers, I think that it adds yet another element to this recipe. Very subtle but oh so yummy!

This is a late review, but I used this recipe when it first came out for a party, and the people who were at the party, still rave about "those mussels", now more than 10 years since.

Wow, wow, wow. Beautiful golden color; creamy but not thick; elegant without being pretentious. Sure to impress. Let the onions get soft -- mine were a little undercooked and crunchy -- I would have preferred them more like what one would find in french onion soup. Due to its richness I'd serve this as an appetizer rather than a main course. Not sure what wine would be a good companion -- we served a light Italian red which was just OK. In any event, this is definitely going into my "favorites" category.

This was great! I like them better this way than with tomato sauce. This is a new favorite.

This was a very simple recipe to prepare. The flavors were subtle but good. Serve with lots of rustic bread to dip!

This was very easy & yummy, (even though I used no salt). I might try adding a bit of garlic to the onion saute next time.

GREAT receipt!! One of the best ways to prepare mussels Ive ever had. One thingif you use frozen mussels check the sodium content on the package. If there is already sodium on the mussels I would cut the amount of the salt that the receipt calls for by half. Also, I used the bulb end of shallots rather than an onionto my taste it was more subtle and did not overpower the saffron.

Me and my dinner guests agreed these were the best mussels we've had! The sauce was wonderful and very delicate. Great with french fries!

To Twiga1 in Kennett Square - Just a fun tidbit - Billy Bi's soup actually originated in Chez Maxim in Paris! A fantastic soup without the actual mussels! This recipe is great and quite easy.

Reminds me of Billy Bi the great Mussel Soup recipe in James Beard's New York Times Cookbook. Excellent!

This is a great recipe for mussels! It is very quick and easy to make. My husband and I always try the steamed mussels at whatever restaurant we go to and this beats them all! I didn't understand the need for cultivated mussels (I'm not an experienced cook so I am sure I missed something)because I just bought mussels at our local seafood shop and rinsed them.

The flavors are awesome together. The cream makes the recipe!
