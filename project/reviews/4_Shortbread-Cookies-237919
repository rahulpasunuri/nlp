This very basic short bread cookie recipe is a big winner. To provide a little more flavor, I added 1/3 TBSP of Vanilla extract and sprinkled sugar on top before baking.

Shortbread cookies should be made of 4 things, flour, butter, sugar, and salt. No eggs, no other leavening agents, no other flavorings. I'm aiming to reproduce the classic Walker's shortbread and this recipe has tons of potential. For my first attempt, I quadrupled the recipe (using diamond kosher salt, 2/3 tsp per single batch so x by four to quadruple) and pressed the dough into a parchment paper lined rectangular baking pan, a 9x13 with square (not rounded) corners. I mixed the dry ingredients with the paddle attachment in a stand mixer and then added chunks of butter on low speed and then high for a few seconds at the end. The butter was closer to room temp rather than chilled or else I would have had to drag out the food processor. Baking that size pan was for about 50-55 min and they probably needed about another 7 min but the edges were just starting to turn. The cookies themselves were also a bit too fat. For my second attempt, I will only triple the recipe for that size pan, keep everything else the same and then add an additional 1/2 tsp kosher salt. I felt they could have a tad bit more saltiness to them. I will also add another 1/2 stick of butter to my tripled recipe as they are too cakey and crumbly, I wanted them snappy and crisp. Other technicalities: I let them cool for 2-3 minutes and then cut them in the pan with a sharp knife and then let them cool completely in the pan. They were a bit too cakey on day one but have crisped up a bit.

the dough came out a bit too dry at first, but once i added another 1/4 stick of butter and a dash of water it was perfect :) the cookies themselves came out crisp and warm, the perfect addition to a chocolate and mint ice cream sundae.

I found it easy to make and a huge hit with my guests - they would have eaten all of it if it wasn't so rich! All that butter. I doubled the recipe and it worked fine.

this recipe is very good. only two changes: I exchange 3 T flour for rice flour--makes them very tender. I always make shortbread dough in the cuisinart, stop when dough looks like isn't quite together, and then take out and press into pan.

I rolled the dough out and cut w/ cookie cutters, a little on the thicker side and I got rave reviews. I will do this again!

I made three batches of this over the weekend. Reading the other reviews, I decided to use my stand mixer to make the dough, and it was a great idea. Just mix the dry ingredients and gradually add the butter on the lowest setting. Once all the butter is in, turn up the mixer and it will form a dough on its own. I gave the cookies as gifts and the recipients were very impressed.

Tasted very good, but very difficult to knead. Too dry and crumbly to gather into a ball. I did what the first reviewer did and just press it into the pan. That worked fine -- a teaspoon of water or vanilla also might have helped it come together.

I love that it's easy. I found that I didn't need any extra flour when I started kneading. Instead of rolling the dough out I pressed it directly into the bottom of the pan and it worked just fine. This is defiantly going to stay at the top of my cookie list.

This dough needed a fair amount of kneading before it could be gathered into a disk and rolled. Despite that, it has good flavor and texture. I sprinkled it with a little sugar before baking it.
