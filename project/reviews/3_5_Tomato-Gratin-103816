I'll take others word for it and give it 3 forks. I can't honestly say what it tastes like, but it looked and smelled good, that is, until I noticed the crumbs blackening after about 3 minutes in the 500 degree oven. I thought 500 seemed high, but no reviews mention this issue. Maybe it was b/c I am using a toaster oven? Anyhow, had to scrape off some burnt topping; put back in oven to finish at 375. Word to the wise...

This was an easy, quick, and flavorful recipe. A great way to use fresh tomatoes and herbs from the garden. I used roma tomatoes and fresh basil from my garden. I did up the garlic to 2 cloves and upped the parmesan to 1/2 cup. It turned out fantastic and I definitely will be making this again thru out the summer.

Great example of making something simple to pull out the great flavors that are already there. After reading the other reviews, I doubled the garlic and used whole wheat panko flakes instead of bread crumbs. Used local heirloom tomatoes of different colors, local fresh basil and good quality cheese and it was so good! I wish I had made a double batch; we were scraping the pyrex to get the last bits of this dish. will make many times again, definitely.

I thought this was good, but not great. Oddly, I liked it better with each bite. My tomatoes held together, unlike some other reviewers. I used tomatoes right from the farmer's market rather than the supermarket, which may be the difference here.

I'm always nervous when making a new recipe for company, but hit right on the money with this one. One note: I drained the tomatoes on paper towels before putting in the pan, and I think helps with the mushiness. Flavor was right on. Happy baking!

I used fresh ripe tomatoes from my friend's garden and this recipe came out very good. It was delicious, quick and easy. My husband and I loved it. I doubled the garlic and I used Panko instead of fresh bread crumbs from a baguette. I will make this again for the party!

I tired of sliced tomatoes and tried this instead. What a find! Even my husband who is not a fan of broiled tomatoes loved this one.

My husband and I are big tomato fans, so I knew it would be impossible to go wrong with this recipe. I was right. It's quick, easy, light and subtle in taste. I believe the secret to this recipe is in the fresh basil and freshly shredded parmesan cheese. The only area where I cheated was in the breadcrumbs, which came from a package of wholemeal bread crumbs. I will definately make this again!

I'm sooo disappointed! I love tomatoes and this seemed right up my alley but both my husband and I HATED it - in fact we threw it away! Tomatoes turn out totally mushy and very unflavorful even though I added extra garlic and basil based on recommendations. Sigh....

Easy, quick and very good. Used the following substitutes, (because that is what we had on hand), about 3/4 C. of commercial Italian Bread Crumbs instead of fresh crumbs (will use even less next time), dried basil, and doubled the garlic (will even use more next time as they make wonderful small crispy bits). Making it again today.

This recipe is delightful for the tomato lover. The flavors marry so well. It was a great sidedish to a meatloaf meal. I'll definitely make it again!

Served this with grilled lamb chops and roasted potatoes. Delicious. Definitely a keeper.
