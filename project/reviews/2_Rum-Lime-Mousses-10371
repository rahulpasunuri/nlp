I've made this mousse with the rum (as called for) and found it so-so. I tried it again, but this time substituted tequila, and it was MUCH better. Everyone went back for second helpings.

Usually I like Gourmet's recipies, so I was surprised to find this one just so-so. I made the mousses for company and was dissapointed. It's not that the mousse didn't taste good, it just wasn't very exciting.

good bite of lime but I would drop the rum. the balanc of sweet and tart is the best I have found in a mousse.
