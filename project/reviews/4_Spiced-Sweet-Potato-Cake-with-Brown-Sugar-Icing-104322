This cake was absoutly the biggest hit I've ever got. I took it too my father's birthday party and now everyone wants me to bring it to theirs. I was a little worried I wouldn't have enough icing, but turned out I still had some left! I do recommend not letting the icing sit in the bowl for too long. it set's up really fast! Over all, best cake I've made :)

Without the icing, this is a moist, tender, not-too-sweet cake that's perfect for an afternoon snack with a cup of tea. With the icing, it is over-the-top decadent. The icing was fabulous, but so rich that it actually made me feel slightly ill after I ate a whole piece. Consume sparingly.

I made this 3 years ago, and it's now a tradition. My family requests it. Very easy, moist - delicious every time. That icing is incredible. I have made as cupcakes and as a rectangle cake, but the best presentation by far is the bundt per the recipe, we display it on a beautiful cake stand with icing dripping everywhere. Perfect for brunch. It seems to taste even better the day after it's made too.

VERY Good! I used a Beauregard sweet potato (a really pretty yellow variety), brown sugar, and part wheat flour, part AP. Instead of making the icing, I roasted bananas with more spices, brown sugar, and oil and made a "Bananas Foster" topping. I gave it to several of my coworkers to sample and they raved! YAY! I usually hate the people who review a recipe and change it too much but I really loved my version. :) I will definitely make this again and maybe even modify it again!

So sad! I made this or thanksgiving. We tossed it in the trash. I followed the recommendation to add rum and the cut oil with apple sauce. The icing is great though I used only 3/4 cup powder sugar....will try o think of another cak o use it on.

This recipe has been a long time family favorite - since it came out in 2000. Our daughter was recently diagnosed gluten sensitive and this was the one recipe she requested that I modify to become GF. With Thanksgiving coming and bringing her home with it - I gave it a try tonight. I subbed equal parts of Four Bean Flour Mix from Bette Hagman's Gluten Free Gourmet Bakes Bread book (garfava, sorghum, cornstarch & tapioca flours), added 2 teaspoons of Xanthan Gum, doubled the cinnamon, ginger, vanilla and added 3/4 teaspoon salt. *GF recipes often require more spices to cover the stronger flavours of the flours used* I baked them in muffin pans, and mini bundt pans - just as I used to do with all purpose flour. Baked up beautifully. My daughter is ecstatic.

finally a decent yam recipe. i also used olive oil as the veggy oil. it was easy and came out enormous and high. had to give away the recipe to the entire office.

Rating: 4
This is one of my favorite bundt cake recipes! Instead of yams, I used Japanese sweet potatoes (it's sweeter and has more flavors) and came out really moist and yummy! Since Japanese sweet potatoes are sweeter than yams, I only added 1&1/2 sugar and it was sweet enough. Also adding roasted black sesame seeds made it more flavorful.

I have made this twice now; chose this because I am not very experienced. It got rave reviews both times! I appreciated suggestions to up the spices: Doubled ginger and cinnamon, and added 1/2 tsp each allspice and ground cloves. For a more festive looking cake, after the brown sugar icing set on the cake, I added thin zigzag stripes of white icing.

Rating: 4
Very, very easy. Light and tender crumb. I used light olive oil, and I baked my sweet potatoes (rather than nuking them). The recipe makes a boatload of icing. This would be a great alternative to pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving.

Rating: 4
This wonderful cake has become a family tradition. Always a huge hit. It can easily be made ahead, as it stays moist and flavorful for days. The frosting tastes like maple and is very sweet. If it cools too much, it can be warmed slightly in the microwave, but should be poured on when it is as stiff as possible to pour.

Made this cake as per recipe. But added 2 tsp. maple extract to frosting...my favorite flavor. Took it to camp to share with 11 people. None came home....guess they liked it.

This was the big hit at Thanksgiving this year! Everyone was pleasantly surprised to have something besides pie ... that said, the treat was something that may be better suited for breakfast (without all the frosting). The frosting is what makes it a great dessert! It's great the next day too!

Rating: 3
Excellent. I made it the week before thanksgiving to check it out. Though it was great, and got great reviews from guests, I found it very similar to pumpkin pie. I don't like pumpkin pie, so I made it with lots of folks to test it out. the cake was fine, but the icing made it great. So: cake: 2 forks. icing: 4+ forks.

I made this in a spring form pan and it turned out beautifully. There was plenty of icing so that when I poured it on, the entire cake was covered with a thin glaze. Visually appealing as well!

Rating: 4
Very good, much lighter than I thought, it felt heavy when picked up. Didn't use all of the icing, would probably make 1/2 next time. Cake could probably also be made with pumpkin or other squash. Delish!

Rating: 4
Great cake! Very moist and it is the consensus that this would be a great dessert to serve at Thanksgiving...lighter than traditional desserts but still quite tasty. As was suggested by previous reviewers, I doubled the cinnamon and ginger and added a dash of both ground cloves and nutmeg. I feel it would have been a little bland without it. The icing is incredible!

This cake was very easy to make and absolutely delicious. The frosting is so good that I nearly ate all of it before putting it on the cake!

Rating: 4
This was a pretty easy cake to put together, which is the main reason it got such a high rating from me. I have to admit that I read the other reviews before I started baking. I did up the amount of spices, by at least a third. Also, I happened to have a single yam and some leftover candied yams, so I combined them. I think the leftovers added to the flavor of the cake. Also, I used half Splenda and half sugar; I also used a cup of applesauce instead of a cup of oil. Finally, I used two cups of white flour and the remainder was wheat flour. I've been trying to eat healthier (yeah, right) and these subsitutions worked beautifully. The cake wasn't overly sweet, but my husband said that the icing was a perfect compliment. I'm not a baker-type, so I was estatic over how well the cake turned out.

Rating: 4
I made this recipe exactly as written and it was fantastic! I used Muscovado dark brown sugar for the icing. It was just a little darker and richer than regular dark brown sugar. I considered adding a bit of rum to the icing, but didn't. I may try it next time.

Rating: 3
The actual cake itself was fine (with added spices). Could just as well have been a carrot or a pumpkin spice cake. However, the frosting was delicious and really made it. If I were to make again, this might benefit from some orange peel in the cake and in the frosting for greater depth.

Rating: 4
I put cream cheese in the frosting--perfect!!

Rating: 3
Delicious. Thanks for reviewer's suggestion below to subsitute some applesauce for oil. I used 1/2 c. applesauce, 1/2 c. oil, and the cake was still very dense and moist.

Rating: 4
Very good cake. My husband doesn't like strong spices, so instead of increasing the spices as other reviewers had done I added finely chopped orange peel and am very pleased with the results. I might increase the ginger next time, though. I also modified the frosting slightly: I used creme fraiche rather than whipping cream. It gives the frosting a slight tang that is very nice. I coated the frosting with chopped pecans. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't find the frosting too sweet or overwhelming, and I am not fond of frosting as a general rule. Give the recipe a try as-is and then decide for yourself!

Rating: 4
This cake is excellent! So moist and tasty--even my boyfriend who doesn't like sweet potatoes liked it! Everyone raved about how good it was and about half of us went for seconds. I made it with 2/3 cup oil and 1/3 cup applesauce and it was plenty moist--I might even go 1/2 oil, 1/2 applesauce next time I make it. I also doubled the cinnamon and added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and allspice and 1/4 cup bourbon. The icing was delicious, although I had to lighten it up with some milk because it was too thick to spread, let alone pour, over the cake. It was beautifully done in one hour in my bundt pan. This recipe's definitely a keeper!

Rating: 4
I thought this tasted great and no one could tell that it was made with sweet potatoes. Next time I make it, I would rather use 2 round pans and double the icing so I can make a layered cake instead. I didn't think the original recipe had enough icing.

We didn't have whipping cream but used a store bought vanilla icing but it still came out fantastic! There was leftovers for about 7 other people but my boyfriend gobbled it up by himself.

Everyone loved it!! Super moist and flavorful. I did add 1/2 tsp more cinnamon but you only need to make 1/2 of the heavenly icing for this cake. I baked the sweet potatoes which I believe brought out a richer flavor.

Absolutely wonderful cake. Very easy. I prepared it exactly according to the directions and it was perfect, and all my friends raved about it and asked for the recipe.

Moist and tender, and not too sweet. It tastes a lot like a pumpkin cake. I doubled the spices as some other reviewers have suggested and am glad I did - I think it would have been shy on flavor with the amount called for. I don't care for icing, so I just sifted some powdered sugar on top. But I imagine that the icing makes it quite decadent.

This cake has become seasonal tradition for us. I made a few changes. I use only 3/4 cup oil, less sugar, and add up to 1 cup of finely diced candied ginger. I bake it in tiny bundt pans and sometimes use creme anglaise when serving it warm instead of the brown sugar glaze.

Rating: 3
Very good & moist, but certainly not a show-stopper dessert. Definitely use whipping cream for the icing. I tried half & half because I didn't have whipping cream and the icing wasn't as thick as it probably should've been. It all tasted good, though. Next time I'll use more spice in the cake.

This is an exceptionally good cake--dense but very moist. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used larger amounts of spices, which was a good call. I poured frosting on the cake as soon as it came out of the oven, which didn't seem to hurt anything. The cake rated rave reviews from the West Texas chapter of the Sweet Potato Queens.

This cake is yummy! I have increased the spices each time I make this as I love fall spices and this cake was mild in flavor. The icing is wonderful, good enough to simply skip the cake! All guests loved this! They fought over the leftovers. I didn't have ground ginger the last time, so I chopped up some candied ginger (about a 1/3 of a cup) and that works too. One man even stated in front of his wife that it was the best thing he'd ever eaten. Guess he slept on the couch last night!

Very moist and tasty. Used more spices,pecans & and crystallized ginger. Tastes better next day or two. Lasts a long time. Next time I'll try to bake potatoes for more "sugary" taste, and bump up the spices even more.Made half of icing - plenty. My other SP Cake recipe calls for butter and canned sweets. This was moister.

Rating: 4
DELICIOUS!!! It went in 2 seconds! And the leftover sauce went perfectly on the apple pie or ice cream that the other people who weren't lucky enough to get a slice of this cake had. I made this with the leftover baked sweet potatoes that I froze. The baking of the potatoes really brought out a nice carmel taste and color to the cake. My advice, freeze leftover potatoes from Thanksgiving and make this for Christmas. Rave reviews are guarenteed!

Excellent, I've received so many compliments. To cut down on fat, I used egg substitute, and reduced the oil to 3/4 cup. plenty moist. I also didn't want to use the icing, so I made a simple glaze out of (real) maple syrup and conf. sugar. A keeper for sure!!!!

Very good cake and an easy recipe. I doubled the amount of spices and it turned out really flavorful. The sweet potato gave a very good body and texture to the cake. 1 hr 5 minute baking time, right on! The icing was good, can do with less sugar. I didn't have cream and used skim milk instead. That was a mistake, the icing was quite runny, but still yummy with the cake. I made it for my friend's birthday. EVERYONE loved it and some people claimed it to be their favorite cake. I will try to make some muffins with this recipe. Very very good, have to try it!

I boiled the yams which worked fine and added bourbon as others have suggested. I found that the cake was not spicy enough, but still good. Next time I will add more spices.

This is a wonderful cake that keeps extremely well. So it's a good one for making in advance or traveling.

Wow! This was incredible. It's so moist and dense and delicious - everyone will love it. I used red garnet yams and had no problem with green flecks showing up in the cake; my cake was a beautiful warm orangey brown color. I wouldn't change a thing, although I did have a bit of a problem with the icing. Mine got rather too thick and I had to spread it on like frosting instead of dribbling it over like icing. Either way, it was marvelous. Everybody loved it.

Growing up in the south, all sweet potato recipes contained some bourbon in them, partly to differentiate them from pumpkin, and partly (I'm sure) to help the cook along with meal prepartion. I added some to this cake and found the results amazing (hic).
