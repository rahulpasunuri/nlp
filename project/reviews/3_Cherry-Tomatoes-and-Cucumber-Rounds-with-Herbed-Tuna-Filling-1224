Next time will add a dash of Emeril's Kick It Up Sauce for a little extra flavor. The tuna mixture is best made the night before to allow all liquid to drain. It was a little difficult to get the liquid out perhaps because I add 1 small can of tuna in oil to the other tuna in water. Acutally added a third can to have enough filling. Overall a good dish for a buffet or cocktail party. I will make again.

This is nice because it's easy to prepare in two stages in advance, and it's colorful and light. Scooping out and re-filling the tomatoes takes a bit more time than I'd planned, but overall very easy and a great cocktail party item. Disappeared quickly.
