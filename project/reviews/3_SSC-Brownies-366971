Good recipe - very rich (how can they not be with 3 C of chocolate chips and 4 oz of bittersweet?). I suggest checking the brownies at 30 minutes for doneness. Also, don't skip on the refrigeration step. If you eat them while still warm or at room temperature, the rice krispies will be chewy - chill to bring the crispiness back, it makes a big difference!

Although I was wary of putting rice crispies in brownies, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the additional texture. The recipe is delicious and I thought that the ratio of ingredients was perfect. I would not change a thing and look forward to making them again. My office-mates are even more excited!

Please prepare recipes in the test kitchen before making them the recipe of the day! Great taste except they are almost floating in the butter. 1 cup of butter must be a mis-print. It must be 1 stick. Will try again with half the butter.

I made these with an adjustment... I ran out of chocolate chips and added peanut butter chips instead. Having not had the original recipe, I must say they were a huge hit!!!

The brownie recipe is good, but I'm not sure brownies with rice krispie treats are my fav. Maybe for someone who doesn't like nuts? I like them, but there are yummier things to put in brownies.

I would have rated this 4 forks, but I had trouble with the pan size, oven temperature, and baking time the first time I made these brownies. Despite all that, they were so decadently good, that I made them a second time the very next day, adjusting the oven temperature to 350, and had great success along with some other minor tweaking (ditched the Rice Krispies for walnuts). They are ultra-rich and fudgymake sure you have a glass of milk handy! For a more detailed review, check out my blog posting: http://www.fransfavs.com/2011/09/ssc-brownies/

In my opinion, they need less butter. I used 150gr.sugar and still they were very sweet. I baked them for 30' and they were ok.

These brownies are really decadent and very rich tasting. So rich in fact that I cut it with a few scoops of vanilla blue bell.
