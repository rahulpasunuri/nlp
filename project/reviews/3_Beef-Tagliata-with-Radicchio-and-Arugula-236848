This is excellent. We did use the beef tenderloin and cooked it rare as indicated. This was wonderful with the simple salad of arugula and radicchio. We will make this again!

I improvised using sirloin strip. The marinade wasn't bad at all. I'm not a huge fan of radicchio but to be honest, it was a good addition to the steak. Really easy to prepare and make as well. I love looking at the calorie count, too!
