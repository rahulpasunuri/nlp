These are easy and really yummy. Great for a party or a gift basket. I've made them several times using whole wheat pita from ARZ bakery that specializes in middle eastern breads.

This recipe is a total Party Standard for me. It's insane! I can't make enough of them for my friends! For those who think the recipe is "dry" I suggest using shredded parmesan rather than Kraft grated. These are much, much better than the comparable store-bought kind from Whole Foods!

Instead of just using olive oil, use 1/2 basil pesto and 1/2 olive oil. Serve with hummus and toasted pine nuts. Killer.

I gave this a 3 because I thought they were so so. But I made these twice and each time guests gobbled them up!

I make these with the spicy eggplant salsa and they are just great party combo. I use 2 packages of white pita pockets. I like to use the freshly grated parmesan and then dust it with the canned just to finish them off. I cool them on a wire rack and just bag them up in the pita bag to keep them fresh.

I expected to really love this dish, but was disappointed. Perhaps my Parmesan wasn't zesty enough, but I found these to be lacking. None of my guests seemed particularly impressed, and I ended up composting a lot of them... the guests opted for simple toasted pita, crostini or soft pita instead.

Made these with white and wheat pitas. The consistency of the white was better. The wheat didn't crisp as well. Great with hummus!

Holy Cow. Made these for guests at a Christmas party when the recipe came out, and had people calling next year in advance to request them. No matter how many of these I make, it's never enough. I usually add extra Parmesan and pepper - the chips are zingy but not 'hot'.

The recipe looked so easy, even I couldn't mess it up, so I tried it over the holidays, and everybody loved the results! They are especially good with hummus and baba ganouj...an excellent alternative (and economical, too) to potato chips. I ommitted the olive oil and used a fat-free cooking spray; and got creative with different seasonings! Try fresh ground black pepper with the parmesan, or garlic powder, or rosemary...will definately make again!

The recipe sounded great but the end result was very bad, my guest found them to be very dry and bland (nedless to say I had lots of leftovers). Perhaps, if one used a little garlic and substitued the olive oil with butter it might not come out so DRY.

One word...ADDICTIVE. I've made these for several parties and everyone omplains that there are never enough...mostly because the first people in the door eat them all before the rest of the guests even arrived. Easy and tasty.
