I thought this was a good soup, super easy. Makes in less than an hour and made it with what was in my house. Instead of the blender I used an immersion blender which left it a little lumpy but way easier than cleaning the blender. It definitely is better with some sherry.

This is a deceptively great recipe. I always enjoy making it because it tastes like I slaved over a hot stove making a delicious seafood stock. A few additions/improvements I've done now that I've made it a few times: I get cooked shrimp from the store, then simmer the clam juice with the tails with a little extra white wine and sherry for about 20 min for extra flavor, use an extra shallot on top of the onions, add some red pepper flakes, and cut down the butter and half and half a lot. I also used reduced fat 1/2 1/2. I make a little shrimp salad with lemon, OO, red salt, pepper and fresh parsley with chopped shrimp as a garnish on top.

If you're looking for an easy recipe to wow your guests, here it is. I made this as the starter for a New Year's Eve dinner and three of the 8 guests asked for second helpings. This recipe gets 3 forks for flavour, but 4 for how darn easy it is. First of all, it's huge -- what's here easily serves 3 or 4. I tripled the recipe to serve 8 and had tons left over; probably could have just doubled it. The only change I made was to add some chopped celery in with the onions and I would highly recommend that. Otherwise, great. Try adding half the cayenne and then spicing it up a little more if you feel it needs it. Very rich, so watch what you serve it with.

BEST shrimp bisque EVER!!!!! This was easy, quick, and is so full of flavour! This is a definite keeper! YUM!

I made this for company last night as a first course and made 1 1/2 times the recipe. It would have served at least 8. Although good, it was too thick and less shrimp next time. The shrimp garnish should be chopped because whole shrimp are too hard to cut and eat from a soup bowl. I can't imagine this as a main course - just not that interesting. More tomato paste might have enhanced the flavor.

To the cook from Shoreview MN: You did not make the recipe. That's why it came out "bland initially". Your "few small changes" altered the recipe to the point of making something entirely different than shrimp bisque. I think you made Low Fat Creamy Chickeny Tomatoes and Shrimp.

The way I made this recipe it came out very bland initially. I didn't have clam juice so I used all chicken broth. I didn't want the end result too sweet so I used a can of petite diced tomatoes instead of the tomato paste. I added the tomatoes with the shrimp and pureed it all together. I also used fat free evaporated milk instead of cream or half & half to make it lighter. These few small changes shouldn't have made that much of a difference in flavor. I ended up adding a bay leaf, tarragon, a few shakes of cajun seasoning, several shakes of Old Bay seasoning as well as salt & pepper to give it flavor. With the added seasonings, however, it was quite good. If I made this recipe again, I would add the seasonings in to cook with the rice and onions and flavor the broth. I did like how quick this was to make.

A very fine bisque indeed! I prepared the recipe as written but, added some of the shrimp shells to make it very much richer, it worked! The end result was a very smooth, flavourful, bisque, one that I would be pleased to serve any of my "snooty" gastronomes. I also served it with the "Rosemary Toasts" ...great combination!

Sorry for the double posting. This newly designed site just doesn't seem to work the way the old one did.

Hot tomato soup??? I don't think so! This bisque is delicious and my husband loved it! I couldn't bear to puree 12 oz. of shrimp so I only pureed 6 and added the rest whole, after adding the cream. I used part clam juice and part chicken broth; part Half 'n Half and part heavy cream. Very rich and delicious. I also added a couple of teaspoons White Wine Worcestireshire Sauce and found it added a little dimension to the bisque. Very good!

Hot tomato soup??? I don't think so! This bisque was delicious and my husband loved it! It's one of the easiest recipes I've ever made from this site. I just couldn't bear to puree 12 oz. of perfectly good shrimp so I only pureed 6 shrimp and added the rest whole, after adding the cream. I didn't have quite enough clam juice so I used a little chicken broth to equal 1-3/4 cups. I also used about half whipping cream and half Half'n Half. It was very rich! Also, added a little white wine Worcestireshire sauce. I found it added a little more dimension. Delicious!

A real disappointment. Result tasted like hot, too hot, cream of tomato soup. The shrimp and clam flavor disappeared in the overabundance of tomato paste and cayenne. I guess I should avoid anything labelled quick in the future. A bit of sherry, a tradition in shrimp bisque, helped a bit, but not enough.

WOWZERS! If you want something easy with rave reviews this is a must AND I made it FAT FREE. I sautéed the onions with chicken broth and used Fat Free half & half. No one was the wiser and it was delicious. I had to tell my low fat secret for everyone to have seconds. This definitely serves more than just 2.

I made this dish for my boyfriend and four year old son. It is hard to find something they will both enjoy with out having hot dogs every night. They loved it!! I served with ceasar salad and sun dried tomato bagette. I never thought bisque would be so easy.

This bisque is a very good basic recipe. All of my guests liked it a lot. The over-all integrity of the flavor of the shrimp perfectly lends itself to the rest of the ingredients.

I used fresh salmon and it was great! The texture is very nice. Way too much for two, though. It's very rich!

My geology class went overtime tonight, but I was able to pull this soup together in minutes. I used 4T tomato paste and added a bit of brandy. I cut up a bit of fresh herbs for the garnish. We liked it.

I've made this many times- delicious and impressive for not much effort. Instead of clam juice I use a knorr fish bouillon cube and 2 cups water.

I thought this was a great recipe and easy to make. I did not have enough clam juice on hand, so used 1/2 chicken broth and I used jasmine rice in place of long grain. I would definitely make it again.

I don't know what happened with this one but it seemed like a waste of shrimp. I added extra garlic and cayenne to give it some flavor because my initial reaction (after following the recipe plus adding the white wine) was YUK! After adding the extra spice it was edible and my family thought it was okay but I still only ate half a bowl. :( Nobody wants me to make it again.

very good. i will try the brandy & white wine next time. i made olive oil garlic croutons which mixed nicely with the shrimp flavor. i also used the shells for extra richness. wonderful!!

I thought this was great! It had a wonderful flavor. I added extra tomato paste, garlic salt, and I had to sub half of the clam juice for chicken stock. My only complaint would be that it was extremely rich. I might try making it even thinner next time. I also combined this recipe with the other Shrimp Bisque recipe at this site.

I took missyb's suggestions about adding tarragon, wine and brandy and we really like the soup with those additions. That it's fast and easy is also a plus.

Not only is this quick, easy, and simple to make, it was absolutely delicious. My whole family loved it, and even my kids asked me to make it again and again. I was amazed how easily this wonderful dish could be prepared. It tastes absolutely gourmet.

This was a terrific recipe. My wife thought it was great and suggested making it again with friends.I used about 9oz. of shrimp rather than 12 and it was just right. Adding crostinis made it a complete meal.

I thought this was an excellent recipe. However I noted a couple other people mentioned something was missing. You definitly need the celery and the lemon to go with shrimp. (A little garlic powder helped too.) But it was fast and simple. Delicious!

This was a hit on Christmas Eve.I added some red pepper flakes to give it some zing. and an extra tablespoon of tomato paste.

We are so disappointed! Its consistency made it taste more like under-seasoned shrimp paste than a bisque. You can do better with shrimp than this recipe. I felt I had wasted the shrimp.

My husband loves this one, too. I was worried about it "missing something" after reading Pam's review, so I added 1/2 tsp dried tarragon with the onion. Then I added 1/2 cup white wine and 1/4 cup brandy with the clam juice. Fabulous flavor! I thought it to be quite thick, but that probably was because I used 1 lb shrimp. I'll cut back next time.

It was quick. It was easy. It was good. But with each bite, I wondered what was missing. This makes plenty for two people and my husband really liked it, so we'll have it again.
