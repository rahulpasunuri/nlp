Halved recipe and used chocolate chips but otherwise made as written. I thought the more delicate flavor of the pears was overwhelmed by the chocolate and cherries. From the other reviews it seems apples might be a better choice.

I've made this crisp with only Anjou pears and with a combination of pears/granny smith apples. As with any crisp, in my experience it works to reduce the sugar by almost half (so I do). I would not recommend using chocolate chips since I think it cheapens the appearance. If you do, use the highest quality bittersweet chips available. I love this recipe. When I use apples, I reduce the amount of nutmeg and increase the cinnamon. This makes too much topping for me, but I do eat the leftovers raw like another cook wrote!

Seemed a bit too dry - I think the cherries soaked up a lot of the moisture and bloated. I might use fewer or no cherries if I make this again, because it was otherwise really good, especially the crisp topping. Could probably do with less sugar in the filling, too.

Made it for a Christmas Eve dessert. Everyone liked it, but I thought it was a bit too sweet. To make again I would decrease the brown sugar and add more oats and nuts. I used dried cranberries because I had a supply on hand. Leftover the cranberries seemed a little tobaccoy. My daughter didn't like to chocolate part (but she doesn't like anything with baked chocolate!!!

I thought this was great and the cherries gave it a great tart taste to add to the sweet. I didn't use Anjou pears and will next time.

I used 3 cups of fresh tart cherries from the farmers' market instead of dried, and ended up with not enough fruit for a 9x13 (I only had 3 pears), so it went into a 7x10 pan with 2/3 of the topping. It was fabulous! It wasn't overly sweet, I think because the fresh cherries added a great juicy tartness.

I omitted the chocolate and almonds in the topping, and used half pear/half apple instead of all pear. It was wonderful, and my daughter requested this crisp instead of a birthday cake!

I am one of those annoying cooks who didn't follow the recipe but I am not sorry because the suggestions from other cooks were great. I used half the butter (95% humidity here gives butter superpowers) and half the sugar in the topping. I substituted Granny Smith apples and dried cranberries for the fruits and used a little almond extract and cinnamon but no nutmeg. We loved it.

I love this recipe-it's my all-time favorite crisp. But-I've always made it with tart green apples, not pears, which is probably why it's never seemed too sweet. In fact, I usually use sweet, not tart, dried cherries. I also like to use pecans instead of almonds because they seem to go better with the apples. The addition of chocolate makes the recipe especially memorable. When you serve it warm the chocolate pieces are slightly gooey, like they are in the very best chocolate chip cookies, and the cherries make the juice rich and winey. I always increase the amount of topping and make it ahead, because it's so good and I like to eat it raw out of the refrigerator. Here's a story to show how beloved this recipe is: My husband and I were joining friends at a completely equipped but very remote rental cabin in the mountains. I said I'd bring the makings for the crisp, but had to hope we'd be supplied with a baking pan of the right size. At the last minute I didn't want to take the chance of there not being one, and I brought my own pan. Our friends, who couldn't conceive of missing out (so near yet so far!) brought a pan, too. And, of couse, I ended up with quite a choice, because the cabin had one as well. The crisp, as always, was great!

WOW! This was amazing -- rich, warm, fragrant, and with chocolate -- all the things one wants from a dessert! I used a very rich bittersweet chocolate; with semisweet it might be too sweet unless you reduce the sugar, although chocolate chips would be easier than hacking away at a bar. I also used dried cranberries because they were easier to get than cherries, and served it with barely sweetened whipped cream. I brought it to party and it served a crowd; for family use I would halve the recipe.

The crisp seemed good in concept but in reality was too sweet. Next time I'd like to combine some tart apples with the pears and decrease the amount of sugar for both filling and topping. I'd also use chocolate chips instead of chunks. With a few adjustments this could be good. The only good part about this first time around with this recipe was that it smelled wonderful while it was baking!!

This dish was a real disappointment. It was way too sweet, and the nutmeg was too strong. The balance of flavors seemed off, and I would not make it again.

I was searching for a fall dessert other than apple crisp and found this. Was the hit of our dinner party. Would not make any changes to it at all!

Yum! I've made this twice, both times for Christmas Eve get togethers. It's wonderful - rich and kind of sophisticated but not too fancy and not too hard to put together. In my opinion, it serves a lot more than eight people and thus is good for a buffet. I don't find it too sweet at all - if you like dried cherries go for it!

I have made this numerous times and it is always fantastic! Easy to put together and comes out great every time. I agree with another reviewer - dried cranberries are good and do make it less sweet.

A great fall dessert and a hit every time I make it. Dried cranberries work in place of the dried cherries and make it a bit less sweet.
