This cake has a fantastic, delicate flavor and a really nice texture. It takes a while to prepare the quince but it is worth the extra time.

I followed the suggestions of previous reviewers and only cooked the quince slices for an hour and the cake itself for 65 minutes. I reduced the syrup that was left after draining the quince and added some chopped candied ginger. The recipe mentioned pecans in the sidebar but they weren't in the actual recipe. I would add them. Also, did not cool the quince for more than 10 minutes. Delicious.

the cake flour really makes this pound cake recipe different, and in a good way, I think. It's still dense but somehow, lighter than the typical pound cake. Also not as rich and buttery compared to the usual pound cake but oh my, how delicious it is! I did have one substitution: vanilla bean paste instead of vanilla bean extract for the visual aspect (tiny black specks) and for a slightly more vanilla-y flavor. The next time, I would probably go ahead and use 3 quince instead of two. And cooking the slices didn't take 2 1/2 hours at all. More like 1. I drained the slices in a colander and they only cooled there as I put together the cake batter. And as suggested by a previous reviewer, I cooked down the quince syrup into a jelly that tastes delicious. The next time, might add some candied ginger just to see where it all goes.

When the quince started turning soft but still held their shape, I removed them from the heat. The total cooking time for the quinces was about 1 hr. Also, in my experience, it was not necessary to pat dry the quinces. Just let them sit in the sieve for a period of time -- i let mine sit drain for about 10 mins and mixed them right into the batter. Seems such a time suck and a terrible waste of paper towel to have to pat them dry (Think of the landfills!)

This is really a fantastic recipe, well worth the time. My quinces didn't hold their sliced shape, but I mashed them up and stirred them into cake batter anyway. I'm sure the slices would give a prettier presentation but regardless I don't think I've ever had a better pound cake. I'll definitely make this again, with another fruit if not quinces.

This was delicious! I have a little bit of a problem following instructions and cooked the quince differently but the ingredients the mixing the baking and the other stuff was the same. My mom's boyfriend loved it so much that he brought me a lot of quince so that I'd make them for Christmas eve for them.

This was a lot of work for such a simple cake. It was delicious, but I don't think I'll put all the work into making the quince preparation, which, YES, TURNED INTO MUSH. I'll make the cake next time with simple fresh or dried fruit or even chocolate bits.

This recipe is a great way to use quince. Here in Turkey, quince are in season and available by the kilo for a great price. Highly recommend this recipe if you're looking for something to do with any kind of fruit. Only took 1 hour to bake fully, the additional 15 minutes weren't necessary.

Tried this recipe last fall. I did like the cake part of it but the quinces sucked. I put them on to simmer for the time specified, and they turned into orangey honey-scented jerky. I had to substitute blueberries that time (which went very well). I tried it again while reducing simmer time and found that the quince were little more than expensive and complicated apples.

This is a great recipe. I made the cake many times now, and it never fails. What's more, when quince is not in season, you can make a delicious variation of the recipe by simply doing the next few speps: Thinly slice 2-3 medium sized peeled and cored pears(or sour apples). Pour half of the batter in the baking form, spread the friut slices evenly, and cover with the rest of the batter. Bake as indicated above. Yummy!

Althought the cake tasted fabulous, I cannot be the only person with a "mush" problem. After a half-hour of simmering, my quince slices had turned to complete mush which obviously made the draining and folding-in processes difficult (and the cake overly gooey). Next time I will NOT slice the fruit until after cooking and chilling and hope for the best.

I made this using the quinces from our garden and it was delicious. I don't usually 'mess' with recipes but I did poach it with more spices including bay leaves and peppercorns which is my usual way. Made the cake just as written. Served it with the reduced syrup and Nigella Lawson's 'Barbados Cream' from 'How to Eat'. Fab.

Purchased quinces as a curiosity. This recipe is the first time I've ever tasted them. Great tips from everyone: Kept the simmer very low and uncovered so the liquid remained, turned the heat down to 300 after about an hour as it was getting a bit too brown and reduced the liquid to about a cup which I used to glaze the inverted cake. A keeper for us!

What a treat! My husband grew up eating quinces and still loves them, so I'm always on the lookout for new recipes. I made this in a bundt pan-- it wasn't very tall, but looked pretty. The flavor of both the cake and the quince are terrific. Like the earlier reviewer, I saved the quince cooking liquid to use as a sauce with the cake. I also left the cinnamon out of the batter and substituted 1/4 tsp. almond extract. I'll definitely make this often when quinces are in season.

This is a great way to do smth else with quince than traditional jam or compote, and it's a nice change from other "autumn" cakes and pies. And it is delicious! I used half regular and half muscovado sugar, and 3 big quinces (almost two pounds). My family and friends just loved it!

Wonderful recipe! I substituted soymilk for the heavy cream since my Dad is lactose intolerant and it was still delicious. Instead of folding in the all the quinces I arranged some decoratively on top. Next time I might add one more quince as they were so delicious.

A fabulous recipe. I had no trouble with cooking the quinces (uncovered). I baked in my favorite 10x4 inch loaf pan, and it took 1.5 hours. Turned out fabulously. I will probably make this again this weekend. Love it!!

I couldn't bear to discard the beautiful, garnet red juice from the cooked quinces, so I boiled it down a bit more & drizzled the syrup over the warm cake. Otherwise, I baked this cake just as the recipe stated (and I didn't have any problems with overbrowning or undercooking, luckily). This is a keeper -- it's worth finding recipes like this to showcase the wonderful flavour & colour of quince.

This cake was a bit of a disaster at first. The recipe does not specify that the quinces should be *covered* as they cook for 2 1/2 hours - but obviously this is necessary. My cooking liquid cooked down to a sugar syrup, so there was almost nothing to "drain" off of them at the end. As a result, I ended up with a hard, sticky mass of candied quinces. I couldn't even remove them from the plate! Rather than throwing them out, I simmered them in some clean water until they separated and the candy syrup was washed off. I think this may have affected the taste, but at least it improved the texture and salvaged the quinces! I'm glad I went to all the trouble though, because this cake is so worth it. It is a wonderful pound cake, and I think that in future this will be my standard pound cake recipe, even without the quinces. The cake flour makes it extremely tender and the taste is perfect. I omitted the cinammon all the way through since my husband doesn't like it, and found that the cake has a wonderful, pure butter and vanilla flavor. I also had an extra, third quince, and I wish I had just gone ahead and put it in too. Another reviewer remarked that her cake was overcooked - although she blamed her oven, not the recipe, I still kept a close eye on it just in case. I'm grateful to her, because after 45 minutes at 350 degrees, the cake was browning quickly on top, although it wasn't done in the middle. I turned the oven down to 300 degrees and baked the cake for an additional 15 minutes, and it was perfect. Moist and tender on the inside, with a crisp golden brown top. This makes a perfect pound cake - just be sure to keep an eye on the quinces while they're cooking, and watch the baking time and temperature.

The prospect of baking after cooking quinces for 2.5 hours is daunting. I did it over two evenings. Unfortunately I overcooked the cake slightly (oven's fault, not recipe's), but it was still tasty, and I could tell it would have been great if slightly less well done. Great if you are looking for something different to do with quinces.

This makes a superb cake and is a recipe I shall use again and again. I am sure it can be made with other fruits as well. YUM YUM!

I needed a recipe to use our small crop of quinces. Made this pound cake to give with other goodies for Christmas. We'll find it hard to share this one! I used regular all-purpose flour but 1/8 cup less per cup and sifted and sifted and sifted. I fell asleep during quince cooking but the extra hour didn't seem to cause a problem. Try this--absolutely delicious!

This is very easy and has great flavor, not to mention a beautiful look. Be sure to chill the quince well after you cook them - they will be easier to stir into the batter.
