This ice cream is soooo good. I did not think the recipe "time consuming." On a lazy Saturday just set yourself up on your porch or living room with radio, conversation, or tv and pit the cherries while the vanilla bean seeps. Don't chop the cherries;cut them in half. I used two cups of cherries instead of one and added a grated/chopped bar of chocolate with orange rind in it. I also cut the sugar in half. The result is a super creamy, vanilla-ey, mouthful of cherries with a crunch of chocolate and a lingering orange taste. It's absolutely wonderful!

I make ice cream a lot and this is my family's favorite. Made it exactly as stated the first time, then started using 2 cups of cherries in the ice cream and adding chopped dark chocolate. The result is similar to Ben & Jerry's Cherry Garcia -- maybe even better! I also found the sauce a bit sweet, so I use half the sugar and substitute kirsch for cherry brandy. I highly recommend the kirsch substitution.

Wonderful recipe! Served with a dense chocolate brownie. Just outstanding. Fairly straightforward for an ice cream recipe.

Ice cream was amazing however I did not make the cherry sauce.

this is truly delicious. My hands are still stained from chopping the cherries but it was definately worth it.

Unfortunately, you don't have a rating of "Oh my God". I'll admit it - I've never actually made the entire recipe - I stopped at the vanilla ice cream and couldn't alter such a wickedly sinful dessert. I make a double recipe every other week or so in the summer - it's absolutely phenomenal. Dieters beware - it's addictive!

The vanilla bean base to the ice cream is excellent; the cherry portion of the recipe was cloyingly sweet (used cherry brandy - what a mistake). I have a huge sweet tooth too, so heed my warning. Next time I think I will add Amaretto instead and cut back the sugar to 3/4 cup. Otherwise, this recipe was excellent - served the ice cream and sauce on brownies and it was a dream. For those complaining about how much time it takes to make this - please! There isn't that much actual time cooking - there is only waiting for the next step. If you're going to be making custard-based ice cream, it takes time and it's so worth it!

This was great. I made it for the 4th of July and everyone enjoyed it. If I had waited until after my company had left I would not have gotten any. because at the end of the day, the dish was empty. I did have a lot of the sauce left, but my dad is enjoying it in ginger ale. I am definitely adding this to the permanent recipe file.

Since this incredible dish requires so much prep time, I have started making a double recipe of the cherry sauce and freezing half for a later batch. The sauce and reserved cherry mixture freeze beautifully.

My family really enjoyed this recipe. We thought it was delicious enough to be worth the time involved in making it. Although a lot of that time is actually waiting for things to cool, and not cooking time. I have a cherry pitter which definitely helps. Fresh cherries make such a flavorful complement to this excellent vanilla ice cream recipe.

The best vanilla ice cream I've ever eaten period.

I didn't make this recipe - a friend did & brought it for dinner. She has a cherry pitter which cut down on the preparation grief & bought a premium cherry/vanilla ice cream to use with the sauce. The result was just incredibly good - lovely for a hot summer evening (which it was)!

This was a good dessert, but for all the work that went in to it, I was a bit disappointed. There's another recipe for Vanilla Ice Cream with Warm Cherry Sauce that is less work & tastes about the same. Otherwise, I may try substituting all the fresh cherries in this recipe with frozen ones...after all the work of pitting, cooking, etc., you can't taste the difference.

This is Sooo delicious! The work is in pitting and chopping the cherries. It's worth it.

Very good, creamy ice cream. Not sure it was worth all the trouble it took to make, though??

Very good vanilla ice cream base!! Loved the cherry sauce too -- have used the leftover on waffles.
