Doubled recipe for large Christmas gathering and it was GREAT. I would triple the red pepper though, to give it more smoky flavor. Even the kids, who are usually suspicious of new dishes, enjoyed it.

VERY good recipe. I subbed 'prepared' brown and wild rice for the wild rice because Von's didn't have wild rice. I used all the other ingredients except the water and broth.

I made this with home-made chicken stock and no extra water. I just let the rice absorb all the stock. I had my husband roast the red pepper on the barbecue, dry-roasted the almonds, omitting the butter and the vinegar and only added a couple of grinds of salt. But all in all, this was delicious!

We didn't like this recipe at all. We didn't finish our servings and we threw out the leftovers.

it was easy to make. I doubled the recipe however the Red Bell Pepper needed more. delicious.

We served this on Thanksgiving with an apple & onion-smoked turkey and other fruity, savory side dishes. It was a smash and I'll definitely make it again.

Very nice and tasty, although wild rice really does take forever to cook (I like mine soft). I found I didn't need to add salt at the end. The addition of the vinegar rounds things out nicely. I had this with pork - a good match.

This recipe definitely makes a lot of food. I used peppers which were half green and half red as these were the only ones at the farmers' market, and roasted them on the top of a gas burner. I thought the final dish was quite tasty and I would definitely make it again. I did omit the vinegar as I thought the dish didn't need it.
