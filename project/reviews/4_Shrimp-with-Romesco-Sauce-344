This is SO easy, and it's amazing. The complexity of the flavors makes the dish special.

This is a delicious weeknight dish. We added an additional garlic clove because I love it! This could be served over so many things...steak, potatoes, chicken, etc!!

I just finished making this for the second time. Once completed, I liked the spatula and wrote "make double" on the recipe. It is fabulous. I do agree with some others that I would reduce the garlic from a large clove to a small clove.

One of our new favorites. We double the recipe and serve over pasta though.

Pretty good. I makde just the sauce to serve with chicken breasts and my husband also slathered it on a baked potato. Since this was supposed to make two servings I doubled it and now I have enough for the neighborhood. I did use half the garlic and found it quite sufficient.

Wow, is this good! I placed the shrimp in a baking dish, seasoned them and drizzed with some olive oil, baked them at 400 degrees for about 8 min. (I had very large shrimp). I then placed the some of the sauce on the shrimp, topped with grated pecorino romano cheese, and finished baking until done. Can't wait to make this again!

Quick, tasty, and a nice change from shrimp's traditional cocktail sauce.

Absolutely incredibly easy and wonderful. I've made this several times with shrimp, chicken, etc. YUM...and you don't need to roast your own peppers, it's just as good with jarred. YUM!!!

Sauce is good; I recommend searing the shrimp in oil and a little of then sauce, then finish in a hot oven.

the sauce is really where the magic is. it might be a little spicy for some, but it was so delicious, there wasn't enough bread to sop it all up!

Fabulous sauce! roast your own peppers and triple the recipe, the sauce is great on fish, pasta, cous-cous, probably would be great with potatoes too...will definitely make this sauce again, and again!

I added 1/4 cup of grated Romano cheese and 8 oz of pasta and tossed it all together, delicious! It is a very different flavor for pasta and shrimp and it melts in your mouth.

Instead of serving the Romesco sauce with shrimp, I served it alongside a Spanish tortilla. It was excellent! It was very reminiscent of similar sauces I ate in Spain. I think the sauce would also be a wonderful salsa if you were to use dried red chiles (pasilla, Anaheim, etc.) in place of the red bell peppers.
