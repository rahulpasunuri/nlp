So easy and so good. I bought the corned beef and slightly sauteed the onions. This is just a great combination for a simple weeknight dinner - WITH coleslaw!

Excellent choices in terms of ingredients. I found that 3 minutes was far too long (1 min ish worked) to let the first side cook on the skillet, and that 30 seconds worked for the second side because the butter was diminished.

Getting ready to make these yummy sandwiches again this year for St. Patty's Day. They are so good. I can't understand why I wait all year to make them. You will not be disappointed.

This is a fabulous sandwich. If you must buy corned beef, make sure to get top quality at a good deli.

this is one of the very best corn beef sandwiches I have made, The fontina cheese is excellant. I made one sandwich with sourdough bread and one with the jewish rye, both were fantastic. Please try this recipe, it is a winner!!!! Patty G from Sparks

These were soooooooo good. The cheese melted in your mouth. I was sorry I ran out of corned beef, as I could have had these sandwiches for a week or two. Horseradish sauce was a nice addition as well. Definately going in my recipe box!

Seriously, the best sandwich ever. My husband made it for St. Patricks Day this year, I ate it for 4 days....so delicious.

This was incredibly good! Buy high-quality products. Purchased wonderful bread and corned beef. What I think put this over the top (for us), was not slicing the cheese too thin. In fact, a little thick and maybe doubled the suggested amount. Result - Oooooy, Goooooy oh my goodness wonderful!

To grrr223 , Put the cheese in the freezer before slicing and it will bandle better. There are also special cheese slicers (the ones with a wire) which are designed for slicing such soft cheeses.

Made these in a panini grill and added a little bitey-good cole slaw (with horseradish) to the sandwich. Good cold-weather sandwich.

Haven't made this yet but I recently had something very similar in a restaurant here in the Atlanta area. The only difference was the addition of fig preserves. It was absolutely delicious. Thanks for the recipe.

These were amazing. It was totally worth brining my own meat for four days to wait for these delicious sancwhiches. We added sourkrout to make it like a reuben. Wouldn't have Corned beef any other way.

Delicious! Perfect for a winter evening, and so easy to make. I also would not change a thing. I'm just wondering if anyone has any tips on cutting the Fontina cheese into slices since it is so soft?

We made these last week. Changed it slightly by adding some pastrami as well as the corned beef. It was fabulous.

I just made these sandwiches for dinner tonight. They were SO YUMMY! I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe. The first bite was the best when the cheese was all warm at gooey. The onions were perfect, not too strong at all! I will definitely be making these again!
