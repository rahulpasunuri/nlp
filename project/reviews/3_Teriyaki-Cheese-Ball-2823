Having read other reviews, I added a bit oa wasabi to the recipe. It was very good, but it was too soft. Next time, I will add less moisture to the recipe.

I have made this several times and everyone but my husband loves it! It is more of a spread than a ball, however. I line a bowl with platic wrap and pour the mixture into this before refrigerating. I can then just turn it onto the serving plate and sprinkle the seeds on top until it is well covered. This makes preparation a snap. This is now my signature dish for parties.

This dish was pretty bland. I added a bunch of stuff to make it more interesting-- more of the flavorings, some wasabi, black sesame. These helped, but still-- there are better uses for cream cheese.

This was pretty tasty but not fabulous. I made it ahead of time for a party and froze it. It did not thaw well and I ended up using it as a spread instead of a ball. The fresh ginger does stand out well.

The first time I made this it was more of a spread than a ball, but tasted great. I made it again and added approximately 1 cup of grated cheddar cheese and it formed into a ball much easier. I also rolled it in both black and regular sesame seeds which gave it a more nutty flavor. Everyone at my office party loved it. A definite keeper.

I took this to a party and people raved. Several people asked for the recipe.
