this was very good with a few changes ... grey poupon country mustard instead of colman's; a little less sugar; chicken broth instead of water. I made it ahead as suggested (careful to not overcook the carrots) and it allowed the flavors to fuse. Everyone loved it and it was very good as leftovers, as well.

After reading the reviews I decided to steam the carrots in advance, and not add the water the recipe calls for. Great results, carrots and onions beautifully glazed and not over-cooked

I basically thought this was good but a little too sweet. I cut the sugar down to 1 T. and added 1 T. of glace de poulrt gold to the water which I substituted 1/2 cup of Rhine wine for. Absolutely delicious and will be on my Thanksgiving table!

For carrots, I thought this glaze worked wonderfully I will try a different mustard next time.

yuck - the flavour was so strange & the carrots were mushy...

I substituted orange marmalade for the last 2 TBS of butter and this was deliciously sweet and tangy with the Chinese mustard I used.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone raved about it. I substituted chicken broth for the water and a grainy mustard for the hot. The mustard gave it a unique texture. I did this the day before and slightly undercooked the dish and reheated it in the microwave the next day just before dinner. It worked out great and keep me free for the items that absolutely had to be cooked that day. A sprinkling of chopped parsley just dressed it up a bit. It is definitely a make again and will be on my traditional holiday dishes for now on.

Very easy and flavorful. A great side for a chicken dish. A little tip: make it early on so the flavors absorb in the veggies and re-heat if necissary.
