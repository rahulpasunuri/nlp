I use this sauce to serve with warm Gingerbead-much better than whipped topping. Also great w/ Angel Food or Pound Cake-perfect dessert sauce.

I chose this sauce to pair up with the Lemon Poppyseed Waffles found elsewhere at this site. The sauce was deliciously tart as expected. I held back on the fourth fork because the color was that clear looking color you get when using cornstarch. I handled this by adding a handful of frozen blueberries. That said, I will make it again for certain.

I use this as the basis for another lemon sauce , which I use on a fruit salad. I don't use lemon slices or lemon peel and I use reserved pineapple juice from a can of chunk pineapple with lemon juice. I do use the sugar and cornstarch. I pour the sauce over a fruit salad of canned pineapple, salad cherries, grapefruit pieces, bananas, and mandarin orange slices. It's a holiday favorite with our family.
