This does NOT make 16 servings; it left me about a mouthful of leftovers after Thanksgiving dinner for 8. I skipped the butter to reduce the fat content and added a bit of maple syrup to sweeten it a bit, but my main complaint is that the whole thing turned an unappetizing grey overnight while in the fridge. Obviously, no one cared except me, but it sure looked weird - and DEFINITELY not like the attached photo. And lastly, dont kill yourself to get the fancy white and purple carrots - you cant taste the difference once they are cooked with so many flavors and the coloration disappears anyway. The flavors did mellow out with sitting overnight, so I still recommend making it in advance, just dont expect a "Martha Stewart" presentation.

I have made this recipe the last few years for Thanksgiving and it's great. The only thing I do differently is to leave out the butter- it doesn't need that extra fat. I also don't bother to reheat the carrots - they are delicious at room temperature. If you can't find pomegranate molasses, you can buy pomegranate juice and boil 2 cups down to 1 cup and use that instead.

I have made this twice now. It hasn't failed me, but it is not designed for a cook who doesn't like complicated ingredients. I used regular molasses and squeezed out the juice from actual pomegranates, and mixed them together. This recipe is tasty, unique and a good balance for more bland or spicy entrees.

I really liked the flavor of the sauce before I roasted it on the carrots but the roasting process produced a burnt flavor. If I made this again I would roast the carrots separately and pour the glaze over them upon serving.

YUCK! I love dishes with a middle eastern taste - but this was not it!

I would like to add more feedback as I forgot to mention that the clean up from this dish has been a real pain. I've been soaking in boiling hot water and scrubbing about 4 times now and my Corningwear dish is still not clean. With 1/2 cup of fat (butter and olive oil) , the grease was disgusting floating on the top which only helped bake on the sugary pomegranite syrup. I would have a really hard time giving this even 1 fork but since they don't have the option of "Yuck" I had to settle for the 1 fork.

I normally don't make recipes to share before trying myself but this came with such glowing remarks that I figured it must be really good. WRONG. I found all the ingrediants, including the $9 pomegranite molassas. I followed the recipe EXACTLY but I found the glaze to be too overpowering for the carrots. In fact, you couldn't even taste the carrots. I would have throw this in the garbage but I had to take it for my contribution to a Passover Sedar. Twelve adults politely took some, tasted it and pushed it to the corner. Fortunately, I made a flourless chocolate cake for dessert and all was forgiven.

Maybe it was the brand of pomegranate molasses I used, but I found that the carrots were really sour until I added about a 1/4 cup of maple syrup. Maybe next time I'll cook down the juice as suggested.

Everyone loved this - including kids. Instead of using pomegranate molasses, I just drizzled pomegranate juice and a little fine brown sugar over the carrots before baking. It worked very well! Definitely give this dish a shot.

These are easy to make and beautiful on the table. People with an adventurous palate really enjoyed them for Thanksgiving...the more traditional eaters were a bit less enthusiastic. I made my own pomegranate molasses by boiling 3 cups of 100% pomegranate juice for about 45 minutes, or until reduced to 1 cup. Let it cool and it works perfectly...syrupy and intense flavor. This is a lot less expensive than buying pomegranate molasses.

This was a wonderfully rich dish. I had some leftover so I chopped up the carrots and served it over seared Ahi tuna steaks. WOW! Will try this again.

Have made this twice and it is really the showstopper vegetable dish at Thanksgiving. The carrots are gorgeous. They also have an amazing flavor that is hard to put your finger on but everyone said is delicious. This is now a regular in my repetoire

Great, complex flavors these stood out above everything else on our Thanksgiving menu.

I made this for Passover (with no pine nuts) and everyone was raving over it like it was the first thing they'd eaten since leaving a prison cell, LOL! My first thought when seeing the amount of ginger was that surely there must have been a mistake- waaaay too much! So I only put in half. In fact, you really do need to use the full amount, it helps cut the sweetness of the syrup. I had no problem finding the syrup at all, BTW- it was in the first middle eastern grocery store I tried, it's a staple. A superb recipe that I will make forever!

My wife and I have made this several times and enjoy it for its diversity of flavors, colors and ease of preparation. Several comments 1.) We prefer the dish without the addition of mint and basil 2.) I agree with previous reviewers regarding using a roasting pan rather than a rimmed baking sheet 3.) Lastly, one can use less butter and more olive oil if they wish. Enjoy.

The peeling takes the longest for this one. I also would have used a convection oven, as my carrots on the bottom rack roasted more quickly than the top ones, important to watch them. I ran out of time for the 4x garnish items, but it still tasted great. I increased the cayenee quite a bit, which offset natural sweetness. In the grocer's I found pomegranate syrup? Is this the same as molasses? Served with Chicken Tikka and Minted Lamb Patties. Great Moroccan/Indian flavors.

Incredible flavor. Everyone raved about this at Christmas dinner. I took the advice of another reviewer and put all the ingredients in a baking dish and cooked it all at once. Really easy.

This a very unique dish. The molasses makes this dish pungent which is a nice change. I cooked the carrots in a class dish and they didn't burn. Bon Appetit!

This was such a massive hit at this year's hanukah dinner, I can't even tell you. People were swooning. They didn't even notice that I'd completely forgotten the pomegranate seeds. But I don't see any reason to do it on baking sheets -- seems messier than necessary. I just dumped all the carrots -- with the extra liquid (and there was plenty) -- in a 9x13 baking dish, stirred them as they roasted, and that was that. (I probably roasted them longer than called for, just watched 'til most of the liquid was absorbed and they were nice and tender). A little extra salt at the end cuts the sweet. A definite show-stopper.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it! I am a beginner and it still turned out great! They did have pomagrante molasses at the Whole Foods I went to. Only thing I would do next time is line the baking sheet with foil. (I burned the pan and had to add a lot of water to keep it from getting worse).

I made this last night as a trial run for Thanksgiving. It was very good, everyone liked the sweet and spicyness of it. I'm not sure about using it on Thursday, as the spices were pretty pronounced, and might compete with/overpower the other dishes.
