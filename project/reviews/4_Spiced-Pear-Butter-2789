I tripled the recipe, using my tree's fruit. For the lemon, I used my meyer lemons. I prepared the mixture through the 50 minute cooking point and refrigerated until the next day. Then, I simmered the mixture for another 45 minutes while I got everything sterilized. Perfect holiday gifts.

This is absolutely brilliant! I made several substitutions, Ipeeled the pears first and used fruit juice instead of the white wine, I used mandarin oranges because we have a tree full of them and I slow cooked the sauce for 5 hours on low and I added extra lemon juice and less sugar...also no cardamom. Could not keep the spoon out of it while cooking and it is the best home perfume I have ever had.

Amazing! Peeled the pears before cooking, added 1 TBL dark rum. This is a keeper.

Wouldn't make this again, very liquidy and it didn't cook down well. Used asian pears and didn't like the flavor

Per earlier reviewers, I left out the cardamom. Also left out cloves, added ground cinnamon (1/2 tsp.) and added a couple of apples to fill in for some pear. Cut the citrus slices thickly so they didn't fall apart....AMAZING! Ate it out of the jar this morning, but can see it would be terrific on French toast, over vanilla ice cream, cheese blintzes...

YUM-O! Most delicious. changes : 1)Peeled before cooking - used a potato peeler! 2) tried the cheese cloth. Didn't like it. The stuff came out of it anyway. 3) Spent the money on vanilla bean - maybe I'm used to the extract, but the bean wasn't enough for me. I ended up adding about a tbs of extract (I REALLY like vanilla), plus about a tbs of ground cinnamon to the end result. 4) I also added about a tablespoon of Marsala. 5) after cooking until the sugar dissolved, I put it in a crock pot and let simmer for a little over two hours. That way I could leave it alone. It was a great consistency, not runny at all. Great stuff, this! If interested in a couple of my recipes, come visit me at www.mymarriageismyjob.com

I have been making this since the 1990's when it first came out in the magazine. Everyone that I have given it to loves it. I usually add more of everything to make it tastier. I've made it using a blend of different kinds of apples, too. I always have to make double or triple batches because my family loves it. They can eat it out of the bottle.

I used unripe pears that weren't sweet at all (from a neighbor's tree!), so I used the full amount of sugar called for in the recipe. It's still very sweet. I would have preferred it less sweet, but it will be great with French toast and/or ice cream. Used what I had on hand, so no orange and vanilla extract only. Put in the cardamom whole and fished it out at the end. Also peeled the pears beforehand and did not puree. Very good even in this somewhat simplified version!

Excellent! A good old-fashioned Foley Food Mill solves all your problems here folks. I remove the seeds only because I don't want any little black specks. Along that thought I put the spices in a fine mesh jelly straining bag closed tight with a plastic twist tie. That kept everything out of the butter except the great flavors. I did not add any sugar to this, my pears were very ripe and sweet. I am always greatly reducing or doing without added sugars. You can always add low or no sugar pectins for added thickness, but sometimes just a little more cooking time will do the trick.

Used the previous suggestion to halve the cardamon and after taste-testing before canning agreed that was enough. I used Charles Shaw Sauvigon Blanc without regret. Used 1 tspn of vanilla extract since beans are just too expensive for me. I made the recipe once halving the amount of sugar and it was still sweet enough for my wife, 20 year old son and me. The second time I made this I used the equivalent of 1/3 cup of honey which still came out sweet enough. My pears were very ripe, sweet and juicy. The other thing I did differently which made this a snap to make was that I left the skins on and then just processed everything in my Vita-mix which made the butter so smooth no one could tell the skins were still in there - saved much time not putting through a sieve or peeling. The first batch I ground my cardamon seeds with mortar and pestle which was a mistake because the bigger flakes were too noticeable. I ground the cardamon seeds in the spice grinder the second time. Also, I liked the suggestion of putting the other spices, orange, and lemon in a cheesecloth bag for easy removal.

I agree with other reviewers...I would use less citrus next time and less cardamom--these flavors were too prominent in the butter.

I used very sweet pears that were full of juice, and this was marvelously delicious! I peeled the pears ahead, as was suggested, then wondered if the skins provided a little more pectin or depth to balance the sweet. So I added them back to the pot tied in a cheese cloth for easy removal. I don't know that it made a difference. My pear butter was about the consistency of commercial apple sauce -- smooth and slightly runny. Everyone used it on buttered English muffins and loved it.

Has anyone made this sugar-free?

This was SOOOO GOOD! I love pears and have tried an apple butter that tastes just like this at a local restaurant. But this was even better to me since it was made with pears! I am looking forward to serving this butter with pancakes for brunch this weekend! I can just imagine how this tastes warmed up with some ice cream! :)

Great recipe! I've done a lot of canning and this batch is VERY small. 10 pounds of pears, doubling the recipe only made 4 pints. I wanted to make Christmas gifts so I would have quadrupled the recipe if I would have reallized.

So wonderful! I agree completely that peeling the pears before hand is a much easier way. I think I will try using the zest idea next time as well as tripleing the recipe! Delicious!

No need to can this butter as it didn't last more than a week in our household!! This was fabulous and will certainly make again. Only change - I peeled,cored and cut the pears first and then simmered - no need to puree but if needed, I would do it with a stick blender as it is so much easier. I also would go lighter on the sugar next time - perhaps 3/4c. Was a big hit with the family!

I don't have a food mill and after trying to force this stuff through a strainer, I wound up peeling each piece by hand and then pureeing the chunks. Next time, I might peel the pears and then tie the peel in cheesecloth (in case they matter) Used 6 whole green cardamon pods and that was perfect.

This was absolutely delicious, and fairly easy (though messy) to make. The wine and vanilla bean give it an extra depth that most store bought butters don't have. I didn't bother to peel the pears, and didn't have any cardamom, but it still came out great.

This is lovely. The first time I made it I forgot the cardamom (darn it) and the butter was still good. After having tasted the second batch I think I'll halve the cardamom next time.

Made this all weekend, and could not stop snacking on it! Vanilla bean is vital, substitute just won't do. Probably about the messiest thing I have ever cooked, though. Will make great Christmas gifts.

Was a bit runny, so I added some minute tapioca and it thickened nicely. The suggestion for using zest instead of whole fruit is a winner!

Great! Next time I will just use citrus peels instead of slices. The fruit pulp was kind of yucky in the butter - I fished it out. Otherwise, perfect recipe! definitely use vanilla bean - 1/2 of one was sufficient.

Great use of Bartlett pears from my backyard. Also my first canning experience -- it turned out fabulous. Might want to use a bit less cardamom next time. Removing the pear flesh from the skin was a pain -- next time I will peel them first. This will make great gifts -- am already planning to make another batch.

This is fabulous - it's great at breakfast and works well with brie and crackers as an appetizer. It didn't make quite 4 cups, so if you are planning on giving this away, I would make more than 1 batch.

Very tasty, and made the kitchen smell wonderful. I added a little fresh ginger.

My parents own a pear tree that produced a great many pears this year. I didn't want them to go to waste and came upon this recipe. This is an incredible tasting treat! It is not difficult to make, just requires some time. I used all of the spices and fruits and the combination of flavors is wonderful. As the previous reviewer mentioned, don't skimp on the vanilla bean. Use the real thing instead of the liquid. It is expensive but worth it. I made this recipe (tripled) on 4 occasions and will give as gifts during the holidays.

Excellent and beyond easy! I used Bosc pears because that's what I had around, and I peeled and cored them before simmering the chunks in the wine (I used half dry white and half marsala, and double the amount of lemon juice) so I didn't have to use the food-mill--just the processor to puree it. I used orange peel instead of the slices, a star anise instead of the cloves, and less sugar than called for. Amazing, pear-y flavor. Watch and stir while cooking, and you can't go wrong. Oh, definitely use the vanilla bean instead of the extract for a superior appearance and taste--I actually only used half a vanilla bean and it was sufficient, though someday I hope not to have to scrimp and save my vanilla beans. Make this. Then make it again. I'm even going to break down and buy the canning jars on the basis of this recipe.

The first year I made this I thought it took too much and decided not to do it again. Since, I am not fond of pears but I have friends who are, I gave it in gift baskets at Christmas. That was 3 years ago. I make it every fall. It is worth the raves it gets.

I've made two batches and still can't manage to keep any in the house! Friends are always asking when I'll be making more. It's also becoming a favorite request for presents!

Worth the effort. I plan to make more to give as gifts this Christmas.
