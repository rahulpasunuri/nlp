I made a version of this using 4 lbs of turkey parts and 6 lbs of saved, roasted chicken bones. I left the skins on onions to add to the finish stock's final colour. Just beautiful in taste and colour! Cooled and popped the stock into the freezer and I'm now finished with the gravy base and any side dish recipes that call for stock.

Indeed. Much like the advent of brining turkey in the 1990's, this approach should become standard for serious cooks at Thanksgiving - or any turkey-based celebration.

This is incredible! It makes the gravy and the dressing the absolute. I made this on Tuesday before Thanksgiving so that I could use 1 cup for my dressing, which I make on Wednesday. There are other stock recipes on this site but this one makes enough for the dinner gravy, the cups needed for the sides and a good base for the ever present day after soup! None goes to waste in my kitchen. If you are looking for gravy that is the best, start with this stock.

I hated the regular instant turkey gravy, my family said turkey would not be the same without some sort of gravy at Thanksgiving. This is awesome, now I am hooked. One piece of advice, make it the day before you need it. It is time coonsuming and worth it but a lot of cleaning up.

I made 3 batches of this stock last T'giving for a dinner of 65 guests. The gravy was a HUGE hit. I have been recommending it to everyone I know!
