Easy and full of spice.

Prepared recipe exactly as specified, aside from the fact that my chicken breasts were more like 8 oz. If you are using larger breasts like this, you may want to consider butterflying them first, otherwise they'll take longer than specified to cook, and the habenero will begin to burn (filling the air with toxic chile fumes). The recipe makes quite a bit of rub. If you like it spicy, slather it all on and what sticks, sticks. If you're not into the heat, you could apply less, but I'd probably suggest just scraping off the excess to taste. One last thing. In my experience with jerk chicken, it really benefits from marinating. I think next time I make this (and I will be making it again), I'll try and let it marinate at least 24 hours.
