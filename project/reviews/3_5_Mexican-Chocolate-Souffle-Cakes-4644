I made these, following the exact recipe, for a dinner party. I served them with whipped cream, raspberries & mint leaves. Everyone loved them. Next time, I would slightly decrease the baking time. 11 minutes made them just a little too done. I used the tart pans with removable bottoms. It was easy to pop them out of the pans, but not so easy to remove them from the bottom of the pan without deflating the cake, or turning them upside down. I used cooking spray on the pan, instead of butter. That might have been the difference. I would suggest serving them with ice cream, raspberries, raspberry sauce and mint.

I never use the espresso powder. And i never bother to take the desert out of the ramekins. Serve with a good vanilla ice cream. I usually undercook so that they are still really molten in the middle.

I made this for a Mexican dinner party for friends who aren't "dessert" people. Everyone raved about this. I made it in ramekins, served fresh out of the oven with vanilla bean ice cream. It probably could have been cooked a bit longer (I cooked it for 11 minutes as previously suggested) and I think next time I'll try it with bittersweet chocolate instead of semisweet.

I've made other chocolate souffles before, and this one is dry, dry, DRY. We won't be making this again.

Fabulous and pretty easy to make. I didn't have any vanilla extract so I substituted Kahlua. Yum.

I thought the cakes were good but not great. The expresso/cinammon spice did add a lot of wonderful flavor. However, I found it a bit difficult to unmold the "not-quite-done" cakes from the fluted tart pans. And I felt the cakes would have tasted better if cooked about 4-5 minutes longer.

The first time I made this dish was for a project in my cooking class. The whole class loved it. Since then i have made the dish for a teacher, and a group of vistors at my school. They loved it.

this was a great party dessert. I made the cakes at home and brought them to a friends dinner party - - a huge success. I too used ramikins!

I made this for a dinner with friends last night and everyone really enjoyed it! I actually forgot the salt and espresso and it was still delicious! Like others I used ramekins and they turned out beautifully. Not only is this an easy recipe, but a pleaser too. I'll definitely be making this one again.

Mmmmm...yummy! I also didn't have tart pans and just used custard dishes - came out just fine. My friends loved it!

Awesome dessert!! (and I don't even like chocolate that much) I used individual ramekins because I don't have tart pans and they came out perfectly! Had some trouble finding the instant espresso powder...I wonder if using some kahlua or amaretto would improve on the recipe...

I've made this many times now, but I would caution trying to make it for more than about 6 people at once - the unmolding at the end is a little tricky and must be done quickly for the most molten effect. It has been a showstopper at many dinner parties and is my husband's most requested dessert.

Relatively easy and great for a warm last minute dessert at a dinner party because you prepare ahead and just put the tarts in the oven when you are ready to serve. Very showy dessert, and tasty too.

I love the taste of this souffle - very rich, but not too sweet. I've made it three times for company and it has been a great hit! Once I made it in a 10 inch cheesecake pan and it came out great.

I first prepared this special dessert after it appeared in Bon Appetit in 1998 for a dinner party. Everyone loved it. This dessert has become a family favorite.
