I agree with the previous reviewers who said that the recipe creates excessive carrot-orange sauce. This recipe is a bit more labor intensive than I prefer, but the flavors were delicious.

We did a wine tasting dinner and served this as our starter. Of all the food that evening I was most skeptical of this one recipe. It was the surprise hit of the evening!! We added cilantro about 1/4 cup and it really added to the already fresh flavors. Well worth the time to make!!

USE LESS ORANGE ZEST. Seriously this recipe was really good, but it was rather overwhelmingly orange-centric. Also, the recipe makes a rather excessive amount of carrot sauce. I would recommend cutting the sauce portions in half. You will still end up with extra even if you use more of it than the very modest amount that the recipe calls for. Other than that, the combination of flavors--The carrot sauce, fennel, oranges, and shrimp--is quite tasty and I would recommend it.

Very good. Great mix of tastes. Refreshing. However the amount of sauce is exaggerated in the recipe. You can start with 2 cups both orange and carrot juice and still have enough in the end. Will definitely make it again.
