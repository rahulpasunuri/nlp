I only used this for the panko-crusted goat cheese and it is wonderful!

I made this recipe today and it was excellent. My husband and our friends loved it. I used a mixture of spinach and arugula for the salad greens and doubled the amount of dressing as I used a 4 oz box. I didn't have cider vinegar at home so I used white wine vinegar instead which worked well. I used an entire log of goat cheese and like everyone I had a problem slicing the cheese because I didn't have the wire cheese slicer. However, this didn't detract from the recipe at all. I'm sure it would have looked nicer though if it was evenly sliced!

This is very tasty as written, though we prefer to substitute champagne vinegar for the cider vinegar. I always use baby arugula instead of mixed greens with this recipe -- offers a nice peppery foil for the goat cheese.

I found the trick for keeping the cheese together is just a dab of water. It keeps it from crumbling. The dressing was a bit too sour for my liking. It almost tasted lemony. Hmm?? Next time I make this, and I will again, I think I will add a little balsamic and less sugar in the dressing.

Loved it!! I didn't have any cider vinegar so I used Sherry vinegar instead. I used an ash covered ripened goat cheese dipped in Italian bread crumbs and had no problems with the cheese falling apart. This will be a new favorite in my kitchen!!

i simplified the salad (used arugula and fresh figs) and dressing (just a simple lemon juice, olive oil, honey dressing), but made the goat cheese as directed. if you like goat cheese, you'll love this recipe.

Rave reviews from the family, but I had a hard time with keeping the goat cheese rounds from melting and losing shape. Part of the problem was that this was the first time I tried the recipe and I was serving 9 people (18 little rounds!!). Also, the family kept gathering around and peering at the cooking process, which stresses me out, not to mention gets in the way and precious seconds matter when cooking cheese! Anyway, the rounds were more like crispy little blobs, but the recipe was YUMMY and I will make it again - next time hopefully for less people at a time.

I made this as a salad course for our Christmas dinner. The guests seemed very excited about it, but I was not overly impressed. Part of the problem was the bread crumbs I used; I only had cheesey store-bought on hand. Better quality would have improved it, but still, it was slightly inconvenient to serve for a group. The dressing was nice and mild, a good complement, and I substituted champagne vinegar for the cider which I did not have. Very good, but probably not a repeat.

I'm not sure about making this again. it wasn't bad, but it didn't blow me away like i expected. the flavors didn't seem to really come out...

To a Cook from Home: I agree about the egg white, so I always dip the goat cheese in olive oil, THEN in the panko bread crumbs mixed with a little thyme. The olive oil makes it taste more authentic. Sometimes I melt these rounds onto slices of toasted baguette in the oven --about 6-8 minutes at 450 till the cheese is golden. That way you get a cute little goat cheese crostini atop your greens!

Simple yet elegant recipe and quick to prepare. I have made this maybe ten times now and will continue to make it. The dental floss to cut the goat cheese is an excellent tip.

Absolutely wonderful recipe! I had something similar to this in a local restaurant and went looking for something like it when I found your version. Any high quality vinegar could be used in this recipe, however, balsamic seems a little too heavy, cider, sherry or organic brown rice vinegar work great. As for the goat cheese, I absolutely do not agree with some of the previous reviewers relative to using "french" cheese, there is excellent Goat Cheese being produced here in the USA, Coach Farms produces an outstanding one, please try one of these instead.

This is sooo good! I have prepared this quite a few times and it always gets raves. I agree with a previous poster about using dental floss to cut the goat cheese. Very good!

Wow! We loved this! Very easy but ever so elegant, this time for a mid-week birthday supper. Will no doubt use the dressing proportions again and again.

I made this last night for dinner and it was a hit. Easy to make and delicious! I made insignificant modifications (the size of the goat cheese rounds) but pretty much stuck to the recipe. My favorite part: sinking my fork into the crunchy-crusted goat cheese and tasting bits of the crunchiness and goatness with the baby greens. Another fabulous feature of the recipe: the dressing is light -- no strong vinegar tang. This is definitely being served at my table again.

I intend to try this recipe, but in the meantime, I would like to pass on a tip. Use dental floss to cut the cheese, if you don't have one of those wire cheese cutters

when i'm in paris i always have a starter of salad with goat cheese. i would have to say that this tastes as good as any i find overseas. the panko crumbs is a nice touch and the dressing is perfect. i used red and green leaf lettuce with some thinly sliced purple onion and tomato.

This salad was full of suprises! While I did double the amount of cheese for 4 people, it is not needed. The cheese is rich in flavour that you only want 2 pieces per person. Also, I don't know why someone would want to substitute this dressing for a commercial one. It blended in wonderfully!! Don't change anything

Delicious, quick and easy! The cheese makes the salad but the dressing is wonderful too. Don't change the recipe -it's perfect.

I made this for Valentines' Day, and it was great. An impressive, easy dish! The only thin I changed was the dressing..I didn't like it at all when I made it, so I substituted Balsamic Vinegrete (Kraft) instead. It was perfect!

oh this recipt is so wonderful. Definitely need high quality goat cheese - and nothing infused with herbs or pepercorn or anything - just good french goat cheese. No matter what the goat cheese is hard to cut so just do what you can and then remold with your fingers. But it is so delicate and delicious I want to make it again and again!!!!

Ah Andalusia! I am glad to see more Corsican influenced recipes here. This one is so Southern Corsica that I almost couldn't believe it found its way here. In any case, a great recipe that you should definitely try. Goat cheese is really soft though and use ONLY the best varieties when you're making this. I read a review that said they added balsamic vinegar, but I have found that this somehow makes the cheese bitter. Try it with and without and you'll see what I mean. The only thing I had against this was the use of egg white as it made the entire dish less delicate, but I suppose you do need some sort of binder. All in all, a triumph!

This is a very impressive salad... although I did make a few changes: I used balsamic vinegar, and I mixed the breadcrumbs with some almonds that I ground to the same consistency. I would also add salt to the dressing to taste, I thought there was a little too much. I also sauteed the goat cheese an hour in advance and then reheated in the microwave, which worked fine.
