Definitely wait for a few days before eating these, pretty much any citrus works here, even a lemon. After I made these the first time, I spent the day thinking about having them when I got home.

Make this and WAIT 2days - 2 weeks. Easy and delicious. The 2-5 day wait is essential for the fennel and citrus to impart their magic. I warm the entire recipe to stat, cool and then refirgerate for 2 days - 2 weeks. Just two of us, we were enjoying a few olives with cheese and wine for about a month. I used garden rosemary, an orange and a meyer lemon. The flavor developed over the next week. While we enjoyed it two days later, it was even better two weeks later. Don't know what the USDA says about the keeping time but a month later it was still spectacular.

This was a fabulous condiment to our Thanksgiving Dinner. I thought I had made too much, but, unfortunately for me, the entire dish was gone, and there were only 8 people some of whom didn't like olives. Next time, I'll double the recipe. P.S. I also added cubed feta to the mix.

Great Recipe!!! I use fresh rosemary from my backyard and I've used blood oranges too with great success. Definite keeper! Marinate for 2-5 days!!! That's why one reviewer said that it didn' t impart any new flavor.

I disagree with the previous review. I love (and eat) olives. I found by using fresh spices that the flavors were much more vibrant than standard marinated olives. I made it twice now and will make it again. Great flavor

it wasn't bad, it just was not remarkable. The marinade did not really impart any new flavor into the olives.
