It was very good, but it didn't wow us. Probably won't make again.

WOW. Classic prep done to perfection. Ok, I cheated and used my pressure cooker (cut the broth volumes way down, but everything else the same) and finished the shanks under the broiler for a few to get a good crust -- the flavor was ON, and everyone loved them.

This is a fabulous recipe! The flavors blend beautifully for a delicious sauce and the meat fell off the bone. First time I made osso buco and it was a hit with my guests. I served it with French bread. Will definitely make again and again. Thanks for a great recipe.

Excellent recipe. However, a cup of vegetable oil for steps 5&6 is a lot of oil. I suggest that a quarter of a cup of olive oil is ample and then deglaze with the wine.

The basic recipe for this uses the traditional aromatics and herbs that make braised meat braised meat, and I love it. The oil amount that previous reviewers commented on is sound, but I believe that RIck Tramonto used the larger amount so that the sides of the meat also brown quickly, and since you take off the fat after it cools, it's not that critical. I use more wine (in lieu of some of the stock), and more garlic, and I would like to thank Rick Tramonto for suggesting we tie the osso buco rounds with twine... what a dish-saver: don't forget to do this!

I made this recipe for friends and the flavor was amazing. It was a WOW meal. I wish I had read the previous review because it was right on. 1 cup of oil is excessive. I use 1/2 cup and would still cut it down and 4 cups of stock would make a better ratio of liquid to solid.

Very good recipe! I made a few small changes. Used just over 3T oil to brown the meat -- IMO, 1C of oil is excessive and wasteful! Also, I added about 1/2 C of chopped kalamata olives, per another Epicurious recipe. Finally, 3C of stock (rather than 7C) and the juice from the diced canned tomatoes was sufficient (and, anyway, all that my skillet had room to hold) for the oven braising. The result was tender, tasty, and worth making again!
