Try this: 1/2 c. butter, 1/2 c. sugar, creamed. Add 1 egg yolk, then 1/4 c. lemon juice and 1 1/2 t. grated rind. Mix in 3/4 c. + 2T flour. Drop teaspoonfuls on lightly greased sheets (I have used additional flour and a cookie press with good results also). Bake at 375 about 10 minutes, till edges begin to lightly brown (careful-they burn easily). Dust with powdered sugar if desired.

Not a very nice cookie. Tastes like egg yolk too much.

I substituted the lemon essence for extra zest. They are nice cookies but spread too much while baking. I don´t think I´ll make them again.
