Not bad, but I've had more satisfying spice cookies. I added cloves and a bit of allspice... some ginger would be nice next time. Kind of a weird recipe. The cookies turned out light and fluffy but a bit on the greasy side, and I cut down the butter to 4 tbsp. Not bad though, given that you don't need eggs or that much of anything else for that matter.

A tasty, crisp cookie. Spiciness was not overwhelming, yet not anything to write home about.

Not your traditional cookie, but excellant! Perfect for thanks giving or Christmas. For chewier cookies, I would recommend adding 1 stick of butter instead of 3/4.

Delicious spices with black pepper as accent. The batter was crumbly but did come together as stated in recipe. Texture of the cookie was ok. People at work who tried them today would have rated 2-3 forks but I will use another recipe next time.
