Don't be afraid. I thought this had disaster written all over it, but the pasta was easy, even fun to make, and the dish is quite tasty, all things considered. I won't hesitate to make this next year.

I thought this recipe was really great. the noodles were hearty and rustic, and the veggies and lemon zest were fresh and delightful. I followed the recipe exactly and hope to do the same again sometime soon.

I was surprised at how tasty this was. I used broccoli instead of zucchini and just before serving, tossed in the juice of half a lemon, a couple tablespoons of freshly chopped basil, halved grape tomatoes and fresh mozzerella (the tiny-sized balls). Super tasty and satisfying!

This is a terrific recipe for Passover as well as during the year. It is easy to do, and a very refreshing dish with lots of flavor. I've had many ask for a copy of this recipe. Excellent choice

The taste of this recipe is terrific.Very fresh and tasty. I found the pasta dough somewhat dry and added some water to make it a little more pliable. Not your usual Passover recipe. I welcome relief! A definite keeper.

It kind of had a matzah ball taste to it. Much better taste and texture than store bought passover pasta. I just steamed some fresh veggies and tossed on some shredded mozzarella. With limited food options on Passover, I would definitely make this again, though it will never compete with the real thing.

Not bad considering it's made from matzo meal, but certainly no substitute for the real thing. I used whatever fresh green veggies I could find (asparagus, green pepper, artichoke, scallions) so at least they were delicious.
