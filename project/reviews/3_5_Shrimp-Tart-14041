I made this tart for a Scandinavian inspired dinner and it was the most popular dish. It was easy to prepare, pretty, and delicious.

People at my Christmas Potluck liked this recipe very much. For me to make it again, however, to satisfy my personal very rich taste, I would make my crumbs finer, add salt and increase mayonnaise in proportion to the sour cream. Spectacular Christmas presentation.

Delightful as summer main course at lunch or dinner. Paired it with cucumber salad or boston lettuce salad (both included in accompanying menu), a light white wine and fresh berries for dessert. Don't know why they say 10-12 servings -- for us it was about 8, and even light eaters asked for seconds. Must eat fresh, won't keep well because of ingredients.

Made this with phylo dough purses. YUM! appetizers like these hint at something exciting.

I made this as part of a smorgasboard for a Christmas Eve party. It was really quite easy to make and with the red caviar and green chives, it looked spectacular.
