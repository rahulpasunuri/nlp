Made this for Christmas dinner and it came out amazing. I followed the recipe exactly for the pork and modified the mushroom sauce a bit but it still turned out delicious. Didn't have brandy, so substituted port. Used low sodium beef stock instead of chicken. A half ounce of dried morels was $15, so subbed an ounce of dried chanterelles and made up the balance with cremini. Absolutely marvelous. Be careful not to oversalt the pan sauce. Classy and satisfying! Will definitely make this again.

Great recipe. Like some others, I double the crust ingredients and always let it marinate for a day, sometimes two, and remove it from the oven at 135. I'm a big fan of brining poultry but find the texture of brined pork quite unpleasant.

Love this recipe!! It never fails to impress my guests and continually comes out juicy. I normally only make one rack, but use the full recipe of the herb mix, it makes a beautiful crust with the fat on the pork. Yum! I have never made the sauce though :)

Had a rack of pork to cook and wasn't familiar. Didn't have all the ingredients on hand, made some subtitutions, i.e., chopped olives added and used baby portabella mushrooms instead. This may have been the best dish I ever cooked!

We usually make beef for Christmas but made pork this year. Everyone raved about this roast, and I would say it was delicious. I brined it, even though I wasn't cooking until well done. It was good & moist as leftovers, too! I also got raves about the mushroom sauce. Really easy for something so delicious!

This was the highlight of Christmas dinner! I brined the pork the day before using the Herb-brined Pork recipe from this site and I think that was the key to making this so extremely moist. The Morel Sauce was so rich and savory, a perfect compliment to the pork. For the sauce I used 1 oz morels and 1 oz shitaake.

Have made this for Christmas and the sauce is perfect with it. If you can fine Berkshire or another heirloom for the pork spend the money, it is wonderful and worth the splurge for Christmas. My family is from Texas and they did not miss prime rib at all!

Fabulous party dish. The morel sauce disappeared quickly (after pricing dried morels, I used some of those, but supplemented them with a variety of other mushrooms, dried and fresh).

Made this for Christmas dinner, minus the sauce, and served with apple-raisin chutney. I did brine the racks and the meat was very moist and tender. This was the first dinner I can remember where there was no conversation, only the clatter of knives and forks on the plates, and every plate was clean, including the kids! I served Cauliflower and Brussels Sprout Gratin with Pine Nut-Breadcrumb Topping and Roasted Winter Squash and Parsnips with Maple Syrup Glaze and Marcona Almonds, both from this site, with the racks. Delicious

I don't know how to rate when I alter a recipe. Excellent, even though my butcher did not do a good job frenching the roast. I might try to do it myself next time. Brining is perfect if you only have one oven, practically double the recipe, and are making a ham and several sidedishes that require the oven alongside. Oh yeah, brined before tying together (made space in pots more convenient) and only for about 24 hours. Used brine from Herb-Brined Pork Roast, from this site, the night before. So tasty, guests took leftovers home.

Amazing -- followed recipe exactly except I halved it. Roasted the one rack of ribs on v-shaped rack, so it would stand up. Did follow the brining suggestion at the end of the recipe. Sauce was utterly amazing -- delicious. Will DEFINITELY do this one again

The writers warn of the ends drying out with this cut when used as a crown roast. I find that brining the crown for a few hours will eliminate this issue and you will have a very impressive presentation especially if stuffed. I brine most cuts of pork with outstanding results. Moist and adding an herbal or spicy flavor of your wishes.

Great way to present pork. I used fresh thyme and it was wonderful. I served it with the wild rice, squash, leek and corn side dish found on this site. My guests loved it.

I made this recipe for my family of 12 3 years running for xmas eve supper - it was a hit every time. They couldn't stop raving about the perfect flavour combinations and I have some snobby eaters in my crew. It's also very easy to get it right!

I have made this three times now and this third time was by far the best. While it was very good the first two times, I failed to note the meat tip at the bottom. This time I brined the meat as suggested (even though I like my pork medium rare to medium) and it was fantastic! Unbelievably moist and succulent. Several of my guests kept asking what kind of meat it was - not believing it was an ordinary rack of pork. Two of my guests said it was the best pork they had ever had. The morel sauce is oh-so- yummy, though I do wish it were a tad bit thicker. Next time I will thicken ever so slightly. This is a crowd- pleaser.

Oh, my this is good! Do brine the roast-I didn't notice the brining recipe until I'd already done my own. Mine was basically the same, but I used one can of apple juice concentrate instead of the maple syrup. All other proportions were the same. The herb crust was excellent! I got my roast at Costco, which means it is not frenched. I did my amatuer job and then roasted with the bones uncovered for the first half of the roasting and then covered the bones with foil. Not quite as pretty as the picture, but still look great- got lots of oohs and aahs when I brought it to a high tea as the "joint of meat". Because I had to transport this to the tea, I did not make the gravy but accompanied it with a very nice apple ginger chutney that was better for serving at room temperature. A wonderful recipe. Do brine the meat- it's so much more forgiving when you roast it!

Very nice. I did not make the mushroom sauce as didn't want to take up time during final moments before xmas dinner. Instead served the spiced zinfandel cranberry sauce on this web site. With butternut squash and leek puree the dinner was a hit. Next time I will make sure that the butcher has cleanly frenched the rib bones, my presentation was not as nice and clean as in the picture.

simple and a great way to showcase the morels. It also works with a roast loin

So easy and so delicious! The only thing I would change is to sear the pork before you put it in the oven (there wasn't enough color when it reaches 140 degress). The morel sauce was intensely flavorful. Great dish for entertaining.

Used two large racks for Christmas Eve dinner. Added 1 hour to cooking time. Used dried shitake instead. It was outstanding. It also made great sandwiches during the week.

Outstanding. As good as rack of lamb and less expensive. Made it with dried porcini. Very goog.

Dried morels can be bought on ebay and are good and reasonable in price.

The pork itself was moist, tasty,and done to perfection based on the instructions. I had a problem with the sauce as it did not thicken, which was a shame because of the very expensive morels that were in it. I will use less liquid in the sauce when I prepare this again.

This was great! I couldn't find dried morels (besides the fact that they probably cost more than gold) so I used dried porcini. I only had six guests for dinner so I only made 1 roast (less dramatic) but I smeared it with the herb stuff the day before and it got rave reviews from my guests. The sauce was divine.

This recipe is quick easy and very very good. I plan to make again for Christmas dinner to serve 11.
