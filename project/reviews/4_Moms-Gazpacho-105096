Excellent recipe. Definitely don't need the beef broth. I added croutons instead of plain breadcrumbs. But mine were flavored which I wish they hadn't been. Works as thickening agent.

Fabulous - Have made many variations of gazpacho and this is great as is but also very versatile to make changes to. I added basil but cilantro would also be good for a latin flair. I substituted canned diced tomatoes and it was still great with lots of time saved.I didn't have red wine vinegar so used just plain distilled vinegar and it was still great. I would not skimp on the EVOO - I think it really adds to the richness and flavor. I too added sriracha instead of tabasco. It adds the heat without changing the flavor. I finished it with a splash of EVOO and sour cream, but also tried plain greek yogurt and just as good with half the calories and lots more protein. Will definately make again.

This is an excellent gazpacho. The egg/garlic mix took me by surprise, but the hard boiled egg and garlic are excellent with this soup. A couple changes you might want to consider, especially if you're counting calories. " Leave out the oil and you can leave out the breadcrumbs. The breadcrumbs hold together the oil, vinegar and tomato/vegetable mix but wouldn't be necessary without the oil. " Don't use Italian breadcrumbs as they're flavored with oregano which changes the flavor of the soup. " I peeled and cored the plum tomatos before I used them. I can't imagine using the tomatos with the skin on and core in. (Yuk.) If it's the middle of winter and you can't find good tasting fresh plum tomatoes, by all means use canned. " I substituted a sweet onion for a red one. My supermarket only had red onions the size of a melon, so I opted for a different onion. Don't use yellow onions, however, as they're a bit stringent. " I left out the beef broth. IMHO, it isn't a true gazpacho with beef broth. It would also really thin the mixture. As the author of this recipe correctly states, this should be an optional ingredient. " Go easy on the salt until you taste the mixture at the end. Commercial tomato juice contains a LOT of salt, so taste before you season. You might also want to consider V8 instead of plain tomato juice.

Great recipe, although I can't say I followed it faithfully. I eyeballed the veggie ingredients, and used a food processor to chop everything. I didn't add the optional beef broth or the Tabasco. Threw in a seeded jalapeno. I used slightly more lemon juice and slightly less Worcestershire than called for (e.g., to taste), and added tomato juice to desired consistency (roughly 20 oz). I plan to adjust seasonings after the flavors meld in the fridge for 24 hours. Didn't give it four forks because I'm still chasing the elusive taste of my first gazpacho, which I had in Spain ~15 years ago. Blew my teenage mind (and tastebuds). I've been craving it ever since.

Rating: 4
When I saw "egg" as the first ingredient, I was taken aback. But after so many 4-fork reviews, I had to try this. Wowie! Excellent. This will definitely be on the menu as often as I feel the need for gazpacho (it's often). Yum yum.

Finally! After trying others, his is the recipe I've wanted for gazpacho -- bursting with flavor. Absolutely don't skimp on the olive oil, and use quality EVOO. I blended it before putting in the tomato juice, and the bread crumbs add a great consistency. This will become a staple.

YUM yum yum. I used the same ingredients, but blended them all for a smooth, more tradition gazpacho. I used grape tomatoes, and left out the beef broth. These flavors are absolutely the perfect gazpacho. Don't skimp on the olive oil.

OMG! Made this for a dinner party last night--everyone loved it. My husband and I just had two bowls each for lunch--it's even better the second day. The only changes I made--I used two eggs with the garlic and I halved the olive oil. Did not need to add salt. I would recommend letting it chill and then check to see if you need salt. Perfect for summer.

fantastic. i followed the recipe for the most part. my modifications: sambal/sriracha for the additional heat (i added some tobasco too). instead of beef broth, i used organic beef base (from costco) which added more depth of flavor to the soup. i opted for the low sodium version of tomato juice and used the 64 oz bottle and added a bit more cucumber and red onion and used 1 full lemon. your call depending on how runny/chunky/acidic you want your soup to be. Also, I didnt dice anything. I used some of the tomato juice and rough chopped all the veggies and pulsed in my food processor. Final twist, added dill and horseradish for a scandinavian/e.euro flavor.

Oh man! This is so good! I followed the recipe mostly as written, except I used half of the broth and half of the tomato juice called for (and it was plenty soup-like). I added a diced jalapeno for some extra oomph. I really like the addition of the egg/garlic mixture! Adds to flavor and consistency. Unlike some others here, I didn't bother with homemade breadcrumbs. Used regular old crumbs from a can and it turned out super good! Will be making again (and again).

Most amazing recipe! I don't care if it's a true gazpacho, this soup is great. I used V8 as others suggested, only a drizzle of olive oil, a few sprays of Bragg's Aminos instead of Worcestershire sauce (keep it vegetarian!), added a tiny bit of serrano chili, and used cilantro because I don't like parsley. Otherwise, followed directions exactly and my husband and guests raved about it. Very easy. It will definitely become a staple for us.

Who cares what you call it, this is fabulous! I doubled the eggs and whirled a cup of homemade croutons and 3 cloves of garlic in the food processor, and it melds quite nicely into the liquid after some chilling time. I agree with some of the reviewers in that I like to add a little heat...spanish, mexican, whatever! To you self proclaimed "foodies" saying it's not gazpacho, who cares what it's called. It's a chilled soup, very similar to gazpacho (better in my opinion!) and I would expect any "foodie" chef would be proud to serve this in their restaurant, add a twist of ingredient, and call it "Chef's Gazpacho"!

I really liked the flavor here, and I like that this isn't a blended recipe, so I gave it three stars. But I didn't have much luck with the breadcrumbs and egg: The breadcrumbs didn't all dissolve (maybe I needed to make them smaller), and I was left with little chunks of egg too. Also, I used bout 2/3 of the amount of tomato juice and broth called for, and I thought that was plenty.

Fantastic! Im no gazpacho expert, but I did just get back from a vacation in Spain two days ago where there were indeed mashed hard boiled eggs served as a garnish with the soup, so I think this is pretty legit. I didnt want to destroy it with my grocery store's random tomato juice, so I pureed crushed San Marzano tomatoes. Excellent dish!

Rating: 3
Hey wimps, this is not that much chopping after all! Letting it stand is very important to develop flavours. I would add more heat with 1-2 tsps sambal oelek (chili garlic sauce), use only two small (19 oz) cans of tomato juice (I'll try clamato next time OR use the Worcestershire which I omitted), use 4 cloves garlic, use 1/2 cup olive oil, and add chunks of avocado, shrimp and slices of hard boiled egg, and be sure to provide some chewy sourdough baguette to rip apart, and maybe some Manchego cheese on the side too (if you don't use the shrimp). Definitely worthwhile trying again and again, tweaking it till it is just right for you.

First came across this recipe about six years ago, and really enjoyed it. I don't care that some reviewers claim this is not gazpacho, it is perfect on a hot day. I prepared this soup again today, and it was was wonderful. I may experiment next time, leaving out the olive oil, I'm not sure that it is essential to the outcome. I did use beef stock and may try vegetable stock next time..I like the extra liquid. And maybe lime juice and cilantro, just to switch it up. Once I've put it all together I like to give it a couple of whirls with my immersible blender. Try it, you may like it.

Rating: 3
This might not be authentic, but man it hit the spot on a hot day. I toasted some going-stale bread and chopped it into cubes, rather than using bread crumbs. In the future, I might puree a quarter or so of the soup and add it back in with the rest for more texture. I was much fuller after half a bowl of this than I expected to be--probably thanks to the boiled egg (I used two instead of one).

A winner. Unless you are making this in the winter (unlikely) use heirloom tomatoes. With a food processor, you can leave the skin on. For 46 oz. of tomato juice, substitute 16 oz of tomato juice, 16 oz of Snappy Tom Hot and Spicy juice and 8 oz of Clamato juice. Make 24 hours in advance. Top with croutons, creme fresh and avocado. Really good.

Love this recipe. I did as one reviewer suggested and used 14 oz of Clamato juice along with a quart of homemade tomato juice. I also substituted cilantro for parsley and added a minced jalapeno, a minced banana pepper and a minced small orange sweet/hot pepper. I didn't use oregano and I left out the stock. The result was a wonderfully refreshing soup that used great produce fresh from the Farmer's Market.

Desert was simply tropical fruits -- mango, lychee, dragon fruit plus some melons & pineapple with icy coffee frappes. Delicious & all of it was make-ahead --

In the middle of a heat wave this could not be more refreshing. I threw everything in the food processor which made this extremely easy--though I think next time I might enjoy bigger chunks and may hand-chop. Also I went pretty generous with the herbs, added cilantro, used less tomato juice (46 ounces would make this really runny). I am curious how folks are serving this. The soup with some bread is tasty, but perhaps not the most filling meal. Any thoughts?

I made this recipe without substitutions and thought it was yummy, but may try it with cilantro next time as some reviewers have suggested. I'm curious about the part of the recipe involving the egg, however. I got an egg that was between medium and hardcooked, but didn't really understand why the egg was used?

This is a great gazpacho, really good - I've made it several times. My only modification is this: instead of bread crumbs (which can taste like powdery cardboard if they're not excellent), I soak a thick 1-2" piece of baguette in a cup or two of tomato juice, pulverize it in the blender after the bread has softened, and add that to this mix. Yum!

Fantastic gazpacho! I've used epicurious for years but after making this today decided I finally needed to register and add another stellar review for this soup..it's truly baffling why there would be any negative reviews! A few tweaks I made..added about 2 tbsps each of chopped basil and cilantro to the mix(not just as topping). Made tomato juice from pureeing a 400g can of whole tomatoes with garlic powder, celery leaves, salt and water..not quite the 64 oz the recipe called for. Incredibly delicious and refreshing!

This is a delicious soup! I could eat the whole batch - like a liquid salad, perfect for summer. My tweaks: yellow onion; less oil, homemade chicken broth; white wine vinegar; cilantro not parsley; no Worcestershire; 1 L. tomato juice, added hot chili pepper, 4 cloves garlic, dash cumin, garnished with mint leaves. My comments: 1-this is NOT a labor-intensive recipe, as some reviews suggest. It is chopping veggies, just like making a salad. By the time my egg was boiled, I had the veggies chopped. Don't worry about making them the same size/shape/whatever. Also, if you are measuring your chopped veggies to the exact amount specified, you have too much time on your hands - just grab 4-5 tomatoes, a couple cuces, a small pepper, half an onion, etc. I didn't measure ANYthing, including the liquid components. Tasting along the way saves having to wash all those measuring cups! 2-It helps to have a garlic press, makes it super easy to mash the egg/garlic/salt together. 3-I can't imagine using anything but 100% tomato juice, as the whole point is to let the natural flavor of the veggies shine through. 4-Do not even think about skipping the 4+ hours in the fridge. The point here is not to make it cold, but to let all the flavors meld and develop - something that simply chilling the tomato juice cannot do. Plus, it really thickens up nicely after time in the fridge.

i love gazpacho & the only reason i made this was because of the rave reviews. i was skeptical of the bread crumbs & the egg but when it all came together it made perfect sense. the only changes i made was adding only 22 ounces of spicy v8 juice & using 2 pounds of assorted heirloom tomatoes, cilantro instead of parsley. i minced the garlic with one serrano chili, used very little olive oil & no beef broth. i also sprinkled some extra garlic powder & used a whole lime instead of lemons. super super super awesome :-)

Gazpacho is my absolute favorite soup and this is my favorite recipe. I have tried many and this one is by far the best. It's unbelievable. I've made it twice following the recipe. This time I just substituted fresh juiced tomatoes for the beef broth and the canned tomato juice and it made it even better. ( but, of course, this is not practical if you don't have a garden full of tomatoes!) Also... I do use the food processor instead of chopping and that saves a ton of time. This recipe totally worth the time it takes to make!!

Rating: 4
This was my first gazpacho and i have to say it couldn't have turned out better. My only adjustment for next time will be to use even less olive oil, as I used 1/2 cup this time. You could actually see the oil on top of the soup, so I just sopped it up with the multigrain bread that I ate with it. As other people have said, the chopping of vegetables was the most labor-intensive part of the recipe, but really it ended up being easier than I expected for such a great result. I did adjust the recipe a bit, using 3 cloves garlic, and a little over half a 46 oz. bottle of Spicy V8. I agree with some of the other comments that fresh tomato juice would no doubt be better, maybe I'll try that next time. (The tomatoes, cucumber, and green pepper were all fresh from the garden stand down my street, mmm). And this is after only 4 hours of chilling in the refrigerator!

Truly delicious. Switched out beef broth for veggie broth,( which i 'whipped up' by boiling some onions, celery, other items, adding it after it cooled). The bread crumbs and possibly the egg made this keep less well than it would have without those items. So if you make a vat, like I do, leave out the egg and breadcrumbs until you serve. I also completely agree with the tomato juice vs V-8 argument. In the summer, V-8 wastes the natural essence of those fresh veggies.

One last note -- I created my own fresh breadcrumbs from a french baguette, and also made some tiny garlic croutons. I used the croutons and sliced avocado for garnish when serving. The croutons added some great crunch.

I think this is the best gazpacho recipe I've tried yet (including my own). The idea of the egg mixture is fabulous for adding texture and depth of flavor. The beef broth is a brilliant addition. I found that given the egg and bread crumbs, I did not need to puree any of it for texture. Next time, I'd go a little light on the vinegar and Worcestershire to test flavor along the way, and add more as needed.

This gazpacho is lovely. I used cilantro instead of parsley, and added a good bit of black pepper. I also used some fresh spring onions that I had instead of the red onion. I'd recommend adding a tad more lemon juice than the recipe says and also peeling the cucumber before adding to soften the flavor a little. You can also lower the olive oil to reduce fat without sacrificing much in the flavors. A very nice dish for summer.

I've never been completely happy with my gazpacho, but I think I've finally found my recipe. This is really flavorful, easy and delicious. I cut down on the chilling time by popping the can of tomato juice in the freezer before I did everything else. I also blended the egg/garlic mix in the food processor and added the olive oil to it, which seemed to help it incorporate really well.

The best I've made yet. Easy to make and it's better with age. This was for only one person(hubby won't touch it-his loss). To do per measurements-you will need 4-5 pum tomatios, 1 green pepper small, 1/2 cuke, 1/2 small onion. I did not use beef broth, used 4 cloves of garlic. I would use a whole cuke next time. Receipe is more towards the soupy side vs. chunky side.

If you do this in a food processor (even a big one), cut down the recipe by half so that it doesn't overflow. I used yellow peppers, panko for the bread crumbs and decreased the amount of beef broth and Spicy V8 so that the consistency would work for my taste. Overall, very good recipe-don't be afraid of the bread crumbs and eggs. This reminds me of a good Bloody Mary.

I thought I made the best Gazpacho until I made "Mom's Gazpacho"! Yes..ADD the Beef Broth...wonderful flavor.

Very good, and easy to make (if you don't mind a lot of veggie chopping). I used 1/2 of the olive oil because 2/3 of a cup seemed like a LOT. I also only had panko bread crumbs, not regular ones, so I used those. Neither of these changes to the orignial recipe seemed to harm it! Next time I will add another clove of garlic, a little dill perhaps, and I'll use kosher salt rather than regular salt. It's a great soup to have sitting in the fridge all summer for lunch or a snack!

3.5 Forks. SO GOOD! The egg, worcestershire, and beef broth sounded off putting at first I'm glad I added them because this dish would definately be flat without those ingredients. Use any tomato juice you like - I liked Bolthouse Vedge Juice. Can't wait till my garden tomatoes are ripe!

This is an absolutely fabulous gazpacho--I had been searching for a recipe with egg and bread after having something similar at someone else's house. I probably double the recipe because I use two eggs, a whole cucumber, a whole pepper, a bunch of green onions, and lots of tomatoes--but I still only use one 14 oz can beef broth and then add tomato juice only until it looks soupy enough, probably not more than 2 cups. I also halve the olive oil, substitute sherry vinegar for the red wine, and puree the whole thing in a blender because I prefer smooth gazpacho. Basically this recipe takes alterations really well--the egg and garlic paste plus the beef broth and breadcrumbs are what make it really special.

Fabulous gazpacho - the best! I took it to a party and everyone raved about it. This was my first time making gazpacho and although it is a lot of chopping, it is totally worth it. The biggest difference was I reserved about a cup of chopped onion, cucumber and yellow pepper as well as a cup of diced tomatoes then pureed the rest in a blender and added the reserved veggies back to the soup at the end. Thanks to all of the amazing reviews that helped me modify the recipe for a double batch, here are the quantities I used: 2 eggs; 3/4 lb. chopped plum tomatoes; 2 yellow peppers; 2 cucumbers (one peeled on with skin); 1 large red onion; 1/4 cup good olive oil; Splash of basil oil; Juice of 2 lemons; 2 cups beef broth; 1/2 cup red wine vinegar; 1/2 cup fresh parsley; 2 tsp. dried oregano; 2 TBSP Worcestershire; Ground pepper to taste; 5 garlic cloves; Kosher salt; 1 46 oz. can Spicy V-8; 1/2 to 1 46 oz. can Tomato juice; 1 cup plain unseasoned breadcrumbs; 2 serrano chilies with seeds. Based on the review below I served it with an avocado cream: blend 1.5 to 2 Haas avocados with 1 spoonful plain yogurt or sour cream; juice of 1/2 lime; kosher salt to taste; ground pepper; 1/2 serrano chili; 3-4 chives; 2-3 basil leaves; splash of basil oil; 1/4 cup water plus more to reach desired thickness. Serve the avocado cream on the side and add a spoonful to each bowl of soup.

I made this at the beginning of summer and while it made an enormous portion, my boyfriend and I polished it off in a couple days! If you can't eat that much gazpacho in a sitting, freeze some in single-serving sized tupperwares and bring it in your lunch one day with some crusty bread to sop up the oil. Just make sure to let it sit in the fridge to thaw a bit overnight so it's not a frozen block by the time you get to it! All in all, a delicious recipe I've definitely bookmarked. Almost forgot, my friend likes to put a drop of half and half in her bowl to make it a bit creamy. Yum!

This recipe is sublime. I'm posting my notes becase anyone who tries my gazpacho wants the recipe. V8 v. tomato juice. The only reason to use V8 is in the winter when the veggies arent good. In the summer, why spend all that time chopping the veggies if you cant appreciate their taste on their own without the pollution of the V8?! Peppers. Use yellow peppers. Adds another beautiful color. Olive oil. I always double this recipe but only use ¼ cup of good quality oil for the whole thing. Parsley. Always use fresh. Oregano. Use Greek or Spanish if you can find it. Adds greatly to the Med. flavor. Garlic. Five cloves for a double batch. Mash the egg finely with the garlic and salt. This is the brilliant part of this recipe. Lemon juice. Use freshly squeezed. I use one and ½ lemons for a double batch. Beef broth. Again, good quality. I use two cups for the double batch (with an extra tsp. of beef broth conentrate). Bread crumbs. Best quality, not seasoned&.remember, why bother polluting the taste of all your cutting and chopping?! Basil: When fresh is in season, I add some cut ribbons to each serving (the basil is not sorely missed if you dont have it). This really does hold well for about a week. Follow Cooks Notes plus mine, and youll be happy. [Cilantro doesnt belong in a true Spanish gazpacho. However, if you add some and a bunch of cold shrimp, youll have a Mexican shrimp cocktail.] [I've served this in a punch bowl on ice with bowls of salad shrimp, chopped avocado (tossed with lemon juice) and ribbons of basil for garnishes.] [When it's 30 below and you want to taste summer, this is your recipe, just use the V8 and buy the best veggies you can find.]

Well, I should mention I do not, and would not, use beef broth. Also, I use a combination of V8, V8-spicy, and Campbell's Tomato juice, not plain tomato juice. Doing this, it makes the best stuff ever. I mean, I actually eat it by the cupful. you can change the volumes of veggies as you wish. I tend to use more veggies than called for as I hate having a half of a pepper, or part of a cucumber sitting around. Sometimes I serve with more chopped egg too, as an additional garnish. Except for adding a bit more of the seasonings as needed for increased volume in veggies, I make as is. Love it!

I'm writing this out of curiousity, so please don't base your decision about this recipe on my review. I was frankly a little disappointed with the gazpacho. I followed the recipe exactly and didn't get the depth of flavor I would expect from a gazpacho. I'm worried I may not have had the right technique, particularly with the egg, garlic and salt mixture. I smushed as much as I could with the back of a spoon, but there were still chunks in the soup. Was this intended? I also used low sodium beef broth...could that have detracted from the flavor? It was good, don't get me wrong. Just not the most amazing gazpacho I've ever had. Any ideas? Thanks!

I have made this recipe dozens of times over the past year, with slight variations depending on the mood. Use good bread crumbs and good olive oil! I use more lemon and less vinegar, and no oregeno. This recipe was similar to ones we had in Spain.

I loved this recipe. The addition of egg and garlic made it "the one". Waited until mid August for vine ripe tomatos and vegetables. I did not use the beef broth and cut way back on the olive oil. I found that it needed at least one day to sit for the flavours to come together. At first it just had no flavour. I will make this again until all summer tomatos are gone.

This is by far the best recipe for gazpacho I've ever come across -- I make it constantly. I do skip the bread crumbs (I find the egg adds enough thickness), I use about 36 ozs. of spicy tomato juice, and I usually reserve some vegetables and puree the rest. Wonderful, refreshing, easy!

This is no chunky V8 but a really nice, hearty gazpacho. You can cut the amount of olive oil in half, and it's still plenty rich and flavorful. It is time consuming, but worth the effort. I blend it a bit to our preferred consistency.

Wow, I must be honest, I was really surprised at the results of this recipe. I had searched and searched for a long time for an good gazpacho recipe, and having seen the previous reviews of this one, I thought that I had found it. Sadly, my search continues. First, it's very time consuming, and for all the culinary flourishes, came out tasting quite like a simple salsa. Granted, it does improve slightly with age (as one reviewer mentioned), but not nearly enough for me to want to make this again.

Absolutely worth the effort! Better than any gazpacho I've ever had in a restaurant. I added a little fresh cilantro as well as small pieces of grilled cilantro chicken sausage (cooled), and it was a main dish rather than a starter! I think I'll add less olive oil next time around, but I'll certainly make this again (and again, and again...).

I messed around with the ingredients (shallot instead of red onion, no herbs, tabasco or optional beef broth) and the quantities (doubled the ingredients other than the tomato juice) so I almost feel like I shouldn't rate this. BUT because the addition of the egg and garlic paste is so inspired and improves the gazpacho markedly, I wanted to add to the raves.

This is an absolutely killer gazpacho. I add the bread crumbs and the egg/garlic paste to warm beef broth for better dissolving before combining it with the vegatables and tomato juice. Then, after it has reached the partial gel stage, I run it though a blender set on low. That will give you a soup with a consistency somewhere between liquid and madralène with tiny bits of flavorful crunchiness.

I made this yesterday, for a BBQ today. Guests loved it. I did place a large dollop of sour cream on top when serving. Very pretty presentation. I did use the basil. I also had just picked the tomatos from my veggie garden, which I do think makes quite a difference in taste. I used a variety of tomatos, not just Roma. My husband even liked it, although, he is not much of a tomato eater. I cut way back on the olive oil. I tripled the recipe and have plenty leftover for the rest of the week. Enjoy!

I decided to make this recipe because it resembles a gazpacho recipe given to me by a friend years ago, which also included beef consomme. I loved it!!!! And my guests raved!!!! I loved the addition of the egg/garlic/salt paste. The only changes that I made were to use white balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar (because I had just run out of the latter); use only 32 ozs. of V8 (instead of 46 ozs.); and I used both plum and beefsteak tomatoes (both seeded and squeezed to get rid of any excess liquid). I didn't add bread crumbs to the recipe, because I garnished my gazpacho with homemade croutons and chevre cheese. This recipe is definitely a keeper!!!!

This is a keeper, my husband loved it! I made half the recipe, followed it loosely and it tasted wonderful. I didn't add the broth and was glad: it would have come out to liquidy. I added fresh corn which was delicious. Next time I'll also try some avocado and the basel suggested by others.

I was really surprised that this didn't work out given how it was rated by others. I didn't add the breadcrumbs or stock and it was still really bland. If you make this, try adding the tomato juice a little at a time until you reach the desired taste, a whole 46oz can is way too much.

This is an incredible gazpacho recipe - I make it several times a summer. I've got an aversion to sweet peppers, so I omit them, add a jalapeno, and use V8 for the tomato juice. A little late for the cook from Seattle, but for serving gazpacho as an hors d'oeuvre, here's what I've seen: Cucumber cups. Cut a cucumber cross-wise into 2 inch chunks. Empty the insides out with a melon baller, making sure not to cut through the bottom or sides. Add the soup - the whole thing can be eaten. (Have to give credit to Martha Stewart, that's where I saw it.) It's a pain, but it looks really cool and the cucumber goes great with the gazpacho.

This is nothing short of spectacular. I made it ALL summer - often with the beef broth and every so often with chicken. Often used V-8 or spicy V-8 and added zucchini. Substituted the oregano with basil always though. Fantastic. DID reduce the olive oil. Contrary to previous reviewer, you need VERY little fat to absorb nutrients from the veggies. Most people get more than enough fat!

Excellent. I was going to make a different recipe from the site but followed the suggestion to Mom's. A lot of people I work with had never tried gazpacho and were skeptical ...now they want the recipe. I used V8 instead of tomato juice to pump up the already healthy ingredients and added cilantro flakes and basil since I did not have fresh on hand. Since V8 has celery I opted not to add that flavor. Reduced the olive oil to 1/3 cup (and it was DEFINITELY enough) and used the beef broth and hard boiled egg. Nice kick and texture. I ate 3 nights in a row (husband out of town and small children who eat kid food) and never tired of it. I recommend flat bread dipped in olive oil on the side and a good glass of wine!

This is yummy! I added chicken broth and it was great-it would be too thick without some type of broth. I used cliantro AND parsley and less than 1/3 cup olive oil, plus added sugar and extra lemon juice. Don't add too much salt without testing it first. I used a mini food processor to cut down on the chopping time. I'll definitely make this one again!

I will next time to see if it makes a difference. I just chopped the garlic & egg & added.

This recipe is definitely superior to other gazpacho recipes I've tried. My girlfriend is addicted to this one, and so am I. I used the beef broth, and am glad I did. I also used basil instead of oregano, just because that's what's growing in my garden. In addition to being tasty, it's also really gratifying to make this recipe, with all the chopping of fresh veggies and herbs and not having to turn on the oven (except for the egg).

I love gazpacho, so I got very excited when I saw all of the positive feedback for this recipe and knew I had to try it. After tasting the results, I officially pronounce this wonderful, wonderful recipe to be my new gazpacho recipe of choice! As others suggested, I added cilantro and cut back on the olive oil a little (used about 1/3 cup). I did, however, add a 14-1/2oz can of (optional) beef stock and am very happy that I did. The only other major variations were that I used V8 as opposed to tomato juice (because it's what I had on hand) and I added diced celery. (Just for fun, I also added a dash of sherry and a pinch of cumin as an homage to my former favorite gazpacho recipe -- but truly not enough to even taste.) I can't wait to get home and eat more!

This was my first attempt at gazpacho and was addicting. I ruined my appetite for supper just because I couldn't stop eating it when I prepared it in the afternoon. I left out the beef broth.

My first time making gazpacho and this was a delicious recipe. I followed the recipe and included the beef broth. I used V8 instead of tomato juice. I forgot the lemon juice, which would have enhanced the flavor. I will definitely add it next time. I pureed about a third of the soup in the blender and mixed it back in. I also used cilantro in place of parsley. I look forward to making this again!

I made this again recently -- doing practically no chopping at all and throwing everything in the blender on the "mix" setting to leave some crunch -- and brought it into the office, where a coworker suggested adding some shrimp we had on hand in the fridge. It was delicious! Like a really saucy shrimp cocktail going on, but with that wonderful fresh produce and herb kick. Almost everyone in the office had some and loved it. This is the greatest recipe.

Toward the end of the home-grown tomato season, I was running out of creative ways to use them. This recipe is excellent. I've been asked to give it to others. The only things I did different was to substite cilantro for the parsley, use more garlic (always!), and cut back on some of the bread crumbs. I used all of the beef broth, which I believe will easily serve more than 8 people. I might try garnishing it with a dollop of sour cream, avacado slice, and dash of Tabasco sauce next time.

Homegrown tomatoes are flooding in...what a fantastic way to use them! I followed the directions except for adding more chopped vegetables and 4-6 large leaves of fresh basil. I used about a T. of tabasco at the end and was generous with ground pepper and a salt mix called Janes Crazy Mixed Up Salt. Let it rest overnight and voila! Summer in a bowl. Next time I would skip the beef broth, use V8(omitting the Jane's salt)and reduce the oil a tad.

I've never had gazpacho before so I don't have anything to compare it to, it was delish. I cut back a little on the olive oil, just slightly, and I think I might take out a little more. It tasted oily, not because I was worried about fat. I pureed mine with a stick blender and I like it that way. I gave some to my mom though and she said she would like more crunchy bites, no puree for her. Great way to enjoy summer vegetables and to not turn on the stove or oven during the dog days of summer. Great summer standby.

Okay, this is it! Finally the ultimate gazpacho recipe I've been searching for. I cut the oil to 1/4 cup (which is plenty), used chicken broth,added fresh cilantro and basil. Spicy V8 worked great, also used lime juice instead of lemon. Letting it sit overnight is key to flavour and texture. I then pureed about 1/3 of the mixture and adjusted for salt, pepper and tabasco.

Vile breath, yes. But perfect gazpacho: pronounced beyond delicious by all. Don't go cutting all your good fat (olive oil) out of this recipe: you need fat to get the nutrients from these raw veggies. Cut the breadcrumbs if you must cut out something. Oh, and check your canned broth for MSG.

Absolutely fantastic - the very best Gazpacho ever!!! Made it exactly as written 2 weeks ago to rave reviews. Made it again first thing this morning with some revisions which I think make it even more delicious. Revisions: increased amounts of tomatoes, green pepper and cucumber; decreased olive oil to 1/4 cup; added juice and finely grated zest of 1 lemon and 1 lime; added 1/2 cup fresh minced cilantro. In the blender I pureed the Worcestershire, 4 cloves garlic, 2 large jalapenos, and the hard-boiled egg until smooth, then added to the veggie mix. I pureed about 1/3 of the resulting veggie mixture, then returned it to the pot, and added 3 cups extra spicy V8 and 3 cups extra spicy Clamato juice. Finally, I added sea salt and lots of course ground pepper, several dashes of Tabasco, and countered the acidity of all the tomatoes with 2 tsp. sugar. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. With these changes, this Gazpacho is nothing short of sublime! Used all fresh herbs from my garden and I think that made a big difference. Last weekend I was at a very elegant, black tie, gourmet dinner and ball (10 course meal with 7 different wines!)and a very refreshing Gazpacho Sorbet was served as one of the appetizer courses - simply wonderful! So, I am going to give it a try and puree, then freeze the leftover Gazpacho so it is like a savory sorbet or granita. As written, this recipe is truly great; with the changes I made, I think it is truly incredible! Please give it a try - you will not be disappointed!

This recipe is fantastic, with a couple of minor modifications. I followed previous reviewers' advice and cut back on the olive oil (I only used 1/4 cup of extra virgin), omitted the broth, and only used about 2/3 of the can of tomato juice (I like a thicker gazpacho). I didn't add the jalapeno, but did add a couple of tablespoons of hot sauce at the end. This is incredibly flavorful, thanks to the egg/garlic paste, and well worth the time it takes to make it. I will make this again and again this summer.

This is the only gazpacho recipe you'll ever need. The garlic/egg paste took this dish from pedestrian to sublime. I omitted the beef stock and even cut down the tomato juice, as I prefer a less watery soup. Next time, I'll use the whole 46 ounces of juice and maybe even the beef stock, and just add more chopped vegetables because I can't get enough of this stuff. Reduced the vinegar slightly in favor of more lemon juice. I also added a chopped jalapeno because the recipe does indeed lack a spicy element. Perhaps spicy tomato juice would do just as well. Next time I'll also add some cilantro or other fresh herbs. Believe the hype--this rocks.

Hands down the best gazpacho recipe I have ever made. Even my husband who dislikes cold soups raved about this. I cut the oil in half but pretty much followed the recipe to the letter (I used a blend of V-8 juice and Clamato for the tomato juice). Well worth the work.

I'm always on the lookout for new gazpacho recipes for summer. This one is a winner! Will be a regular part of my summer menus. I used half the oil to cut down on the fat, juice of a whole lemon, used home-made chicken stock instead of beef, and 1T of fresh oregano. Best gazpacho recipe I've tried. Fresh, crunchy, and nice to present with all of the colors and textures. The bread crumbs and egg add nice body. Made about 2 quarts...which is going quickly!
