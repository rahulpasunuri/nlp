I didn't expect this to be as good as it was. Amazing and easy. I used Italian style whole milk ricotta and think it made a difference. Crisp on the outside and warm & creamy on the inside. I agree with the other reviewer that you don't need the powdered sugar - and make sure your oil is really hot.

SWEET LORD! These things were just exceptional! They were easy and perfectly sweet. I used canola oil instead of olive oil for the frying to cut back on the cost. Also, this allowed them to have less of the strong flavor EVOO carries. My family devoured these (with kids ages 3 and 1). So, for us, I will have to double the batch next time I make them. They were so good that I might make them for dessert this afternoon. This is NOW MY breakfast specialty. I served it with leftover fruit salad, scrambled eggs and OJ. Hint: Make sure your oil is the perfect temperature for frying, otherwise, I can see how some people might perceive these as disgusting. Anything fried in oil not at the perfect temperature is just gross.

These fritters tasted great and were loved by my entire family. Since I can't not have flour or regualr sugar I substitued it with splenda and almond flour. I also wanted it to be healthier, so I used part-skim ricotta; they stayed together beautifully! I will be making these again.

Thought these were pretty gross.

I gave this a 3-fork rating since I enjoyed them but they did not go over well with my family.

LOVE these. I doubled recipe and used just 1/4 cup corn oil with splash of olive oil for flavour. Wonderful with or without icing sugar - but cool well if using.

pls advise..my fritters were flat. I used part skim ricotta is that the problem or perhaps my oil was not hot enough? my first attempt at fritters...but I will try again since the delicate flavor was heavenly. gk

These are so simple fast and good - they're wonderful with powdered lemon zest and juice instead, and I also tried making both lemon and orange ones with a bit of rosewater which smelled great.

Not beyond compare, but very good, I will make again. Great little sweet snack. I made lemon since I'm a lemon junkie.

I loved these, they were very easy to make and wonderful to eat! If you can find it, I definitely recommend fresh ricotta. The grocery-store stuff in the carton bears no resemblance to the really wonderful fresh stuff, and it makes a big difference to a recipe like this. Also, I'd recommend chilling the batter in the fridge for at least half an hour or so before frying the fritters, because they are smooth and solid that way and keep their nice round shape.

These are excellent! Omitted the zest, as they are best creamy in the center. And I recommend using tongs to flip the fritters--they seem much more fragile than they are and the tongs ensure that the nice round shape is kept.

Simply outstanding. No need to add vanilla or anything else, these are light and wonderful. My husband likes a slight drizzle of maple syrup on the orange version, and the lemon version is terrific with blueberries. A fast and easy addition for any brunch, afternoon coffee, or dessert to a light summer supper.

Loved 'em. You can substitute lemon zest and juice for the orange if you like; also, I used vegetable oil instead of olive oil for frying. Light and tasty. These are good for desert, or for a brunch.

This is the best dessert I have ever tasted! I served it to company and received raves. I sprinkled them with the powdered sugar, served them warm, accompanied by vanilla bean ice cream. There were none left to reheat the next day!

Simple and elegant. Do not dust with powdered sugar except for those you will eat immediately. Otherwise they get gummy. Cook up the rest of the batter and save the fritters for the next day, easily warmed in the oven. Then serve with syrup or sugar...yummy leftovers!

Absolutely delicious !!! I've made them a couple of times now and found that they are better a little bit sweeter and without the icing sugar dust that goes mushy after it is cold anyways. Great next day cold with jam for breakfast.

Light and delicate; not too sweet. The simplicity is just the right touch after a complicated or heavy meal. We love these!

I've made these several times now. I don't change a thing in the recipe & they come out perfect. Delicious with a bunch of sliced fresh strawberries on them, and especially delicious with a glass of Tokaji if available...

Very rich.

A really nice, easy to make snack food. Only problem is that those 8-10 fritters go awfully fast. Consider making a double portion.

I have to admit, I added some vanilla because the ingredients just seemed that they might be a little bland. I didn't want to fry them in a lot of oil, either, so just browned them on both sides; but then ended up baking them so that the insides would cook thoroughly. Next time I'll use a pastry bag/tip to make the shape more appealing and bake them from the start; but, the flavor was wonderful!

I changed up this recipe quite a bit, but I must say the result was very tasty. I substituted about 1/2 the ricotta with Libby's canned pumpkin, and added a bit more sugar. I didn't add any sort of zest or juice. It was very good.

I think next time I make this I would add some Cardamom and a dash of vanilla to the ricotta.Also I think sometime substitute lemon instead of orange. A delicious complement to add to a breakfast or brunch.
