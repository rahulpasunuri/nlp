Delicious! I made this to go with a spaghetti dinner, this will now be a regular at my house:)

I liked the flavors here and to be fair I did not follow the recipe. I used bread several days old and then simply sprinkled olive oil on the bread followed by cayenne and cheese, and then just baked. Was ok, but dry.

Simple but scrumptious! I was a little skeptical about the long baking time, but they were not dried out at all. Good olive oil and good parmesan are musts, and the pepper added the perfect kick. Yummy and incredibly easy.
