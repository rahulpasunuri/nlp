Made it without the lemon juice. Was amazing. Had some nice vanilla ice cream on top.

It was scrumptious! The recipe is so simple...definitely going to share this with my friends at college. I made these as a filling for crepes, using clementines. What I like about those is that they are the perfect size for filling and don't need extra cutting and slicing. Then I drizzled the extra liquid on top of the crepes and sprinkled on some sliced almonds for crunch. It was gone before I knew it! Be careful that a little of lemon juice goes a long way, so add little by little if you are going for a sweet rather than sweet&sour flavor. The dish already has a lot of sugar in it so you don't want to add too much more to overcorrect for the sour taste!

Wonderful made with very, very ripe peaches. The peach flavor was so intense that I did serve it with vanilla ice cream, and would do so again. Probably even better with something a bit tart, like creme fraiche.

can this be made with frozen nectarines? our season is so short here, and our nectarine selection often pitiful. i'd love to be able to make this year-round too. merci!

I tried a variation on this recipe and got rave reviews. I pan roasted a beautiful piece of heavily spiced Chilean Sea Bass and poured the finished nectarines over the fish and garnished with a cup of chopped scallions. It was wonderful.

Just scrumptious. So quick and easy. My nectarines were not toally ripe and it was still wonderful - I just lengthened the cooking time. I did serve with vanilla ice cream. Decadent.

INSANELY delicious, and a good way to use up a bunch of nectarines of varying ripeness. I added a dash of Ceylonese cinnamon near the end of cooking and it gave a nice dash of spice. Serving over buttermilk cake tonight.

SO delicious and easy, just the right balance of sweet and sour (I added a bit of extra lemon juice, which I love)

Oh, oh, oh!!! Absolutely heavenly. We made them just as the recipe stated except for using dark brown sugar as a substitute. I wouldn't change a thing. We did however also try them with some high quality vanilla ice cream and we thought it to be even more heavenly, if that's possible.
