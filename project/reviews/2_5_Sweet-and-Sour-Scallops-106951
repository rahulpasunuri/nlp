I didn't like this very much. Everything didn't seem to come together.

I followed the recipe exactly and it really wasn't what any of us expected. It was okay but nothing special.

I made this for guests and they all raved about it. Fairly easy to make too. Next time I'll follow suit and chop up a habanero as it needed a bit more kick for our tastes. Great use of scallops. The sauce was wonderful so make some wild rice to soak it up with! Yum.

Light and tasty. Loved the flavors.

Good recipe and I probably took it to the edge by increasing the ginger and dropping the bell pepper for a habanero pepper.

Marvelous recipe! Delicious and easy. I used shrimp instead of scallops and it turned out great. I also added some brown sugar because the pineapple juice I used wasn't sweet enough for my taste. The brown sugar gave it a good color and greater depth of favor.

This was sooo good, quick and easy! Loved the sauce. Perfect over basmati rice.

This was delicious -- our whole house smelled like a wonderful restaurant all evening. I used baby bok choy and only one red bell pepper; probably used more ginger because we love it. Quick and easy.
