Adding parchment paper to this makes a perfect batch. I did two pans, one with oil and a pan, and the other with less oil and parchment. The results were clear: parchment paper is the way to go! Still, I'm not sure I'd use this again. I may stick to just frying my chips in oil.

This wasn't a horrible recipe, but there are better ones out there. It does call for too much oil too. I made them by slicing them thin and mixing them in a big pile with a drizzle of olive oil, salt, pepper, and a few cloves of grated garlic. The thick ones didn't come too crispy, but they were cooked all the way through. Good recipe if you want a quick side dish, but I wouldn't make them in a large batch for other people.

One recommendation - parchment paper! The first time I made this recipe, half the chips stuck. The second time I used parchment paper and not only did they come out great, I only had to use a tiny bit of oil. Next time I plan to use more oil for the flavor.

I've been looking for a potato chip recipe that I used before, but this wasn't it. These turned out soggy. This uses too much oil. Not good.

These chips were crispy and tasted great. The downside was in the baking -- they all browned at different rates even though I used a mandoline and had slices of even thickness. The result is I ended up with my head in the oven every couple of minutes after the initial 20 minutes were up -- picking out two or three chips at a time. WAY too much trouble!
