Love L-O-V-E this recipe! My all time favorite chutney! Depth of flavor and lots of spicy sweetness! Perfect between 2 layers of brie wrapped with phyllo. Bake at 400 degrees until pasty puffs. You will get raves with this recipe! Good luck!

eh, this tasted exactly like ketchup. Waaaaay too much vinegar, even measured precisely. Followed the recipe in the Gourmet Cookbook (identical). The only change I made was to use an equivalent amount of fresh tomatoes, peeled and chopped (with juice). I popped it in the fridge and tried it on goat cheese and toast. Like a classed-up version of Heinz. I'm going to throw it on a meatloaf or some burgers. Disappointed because I love any recipe that says "great on cheese."

This chutney with the brie en crote as it originally appeared in the December 1994 issue of Gourmet magazine is one of my favorite recipes of all-time. I have served it for many buffets and as an hors douvres over the past decade and it is hard not to make it for every special event. I am so glad to see how many other people are also enjoying it -- and it's a great idea to have the chutney on hand to serve with brie or meat. There is not a single recipe I have ever made that my friends, family, and I enjoy more than this. I could not recommend a recipe more highly. Enjoy!

I loved this and so did my guests!! I paired it with noodle kugel (Gourmet 1958 & 2001). The combination was just great. I doubled the recipe. Because the tomatoes were salted, however, I reduced the total salt by half to total 1/2 t. I used a cup of currants which made it visually more intereting. Wonderful technique for dealing with lemon zest!

I agree -- this recipe is outstanding. Doesn't taste like you started with tomatos from a can. The currants and mustard seeds make it a little different. Great with the brie and water crackers.

I make this recipe year round and always get compliments. It tastes like you slaved for hours.... but it's easy to make and very flavorful. I usually just serve with quickly microwaved brie cheese and baquettes. I triple the recipe around the holidays and take with me for potlucks!!! You won't be disappointed1

I have been looking for a tomato chutney recipe and I finally found this delicious one! This is great with the Brie pastry or just with crackers.

One of the recipes that always draws raves, requests forsome to take home etc. easy to make. I have used it aoround 15 times since it was published. It lends itself to making 2-4x the recipe amount without deterioration. The chutney keeps for a long time

I have made this several times always with raves. I am very disappointed that the "Brie Baked en Croute" recipe that accompanied this tomato chutney recipe in the Dec. '94 issue is not included in your on-line index. The chutney is spread in between layers of a 17 1/4 oz wheel Brie and wrapped in phyllo dough and baked. Suggestion: More pictures please.
