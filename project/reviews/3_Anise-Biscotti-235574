I love this biscotti. The first time I made it I thought I would really notice the lack of butter, but the other ingredients make up for it. I like a crunchy biscotti, so this is great for me. If you want a nice dunking biscotti, this is a really good one. Heart healthy!

I really liked these biscotti. The flavor of the orange and lemon zest come through very well. I substituted amaretto with frangelico and it was delicious.

I was really looking for a biscotti base, but the dough was very runny. So after radically adjusting it, I can no longer say it's the same recipe. I left out the almonds and cinnamon, used cointreau, anise seed and black pepper, also used candied peel - but adjusted for that moisture - and in the end, they were delicious.

My friends and I love this biscotti recipe. The flavors really come through when it is dipped into hot tea or coffee. I added a tiny bit (2 tsp) of water to the first mixture as it seemed a little too dry. I was very pleased with my first effort at making biscotti.

Biscotti Means Biscut! so I think that they were just fine. The drier texture was more like the classic biscotti, went great with my morning cappuccino.

VERY disappointing. I have a fabulous recipe that I've used for years and never fails to thrill my Italian in-laws, but I thought I'd try a new one. Without any butter the batter was dry and crumbling and the cooked biscotti log had the consistency of a biscuit.
