I was worried about the chicken being cooked enough and getting the flavour of the sauce, so instead of letting the sauce thicken and adding chicken to rewarm,, I added the chicken back immediately and simmered covered. My husband wanted more sauce so when it was done, he took the chicken out, added some red wine and water to make a sauce. It was delicious!!! Reminded me very much of a dish I ate in morocco. I would absolutely not change the prunes for apricots or add peppers or other vegetables but adding some wine and water was perfect for making sauce and the flavours were strong enough that this didn't dilute.

I had timing issues today, so I modified this a little. I had 4 skin on, bone in chicken breasts. I doubled everything else (I did accidentally leave the honey out: early senior moment). Then I put everything in a stockpot and braised it at 300 for 2 hours. I fished out the chicken, took off the bones and skin, broke it apart and put it back in the sauce. Served over rice. I'd love to try it again with olives and putting the honey in like called for. All of us enjoyed it except for my daughter, but she has taste in her feet anyway.

Fairly easy to make, and very flavorful. I used 3/4 cup yellow onion and 1/2 cup white part of scallions, and 2 cups vegetable broth instead of chicken, because it's what i had on hand. I used 3 cloves of garlic and added 1 can drained rinsed garbanzos. I served it over quinoa. Although it was wonderful with just prunes, next time I might make it with a mixture of prunes and apricots as other reviewers suggested.

Great as it is but I like to make it more of a one dish meal by adding carrots, yellow squash and garbonzo beans. A can of chopped tomatoes helps to balance the sweetness of the prunes and honey with a touch of acidity (and the added color is appealing!).

Sauce was excellent. I think the chicken might be better served pounded, breaded and fried, with the sauce over it.

I absolutely loved this dish. The warning about the sauce being flavorful is true, though. I replaced the prunes with dates, and it came out very well.

Both my husband and I felt that the cumin completely overpowered the other flavors in the dish. If I make it again, I will halve the amount of cumin. I would also likely use dried apricots instead of the prunes...seems like they would go better together. It was good but needs a few changes in my book.

pretty good. i used chicken thighs which i only partially cooked and then added back to sauce to finish cooking. should let this simmer much longer than recipe calls for to assure that chix is very tender. also doubled the garlic and added apricots as others suggested.

I've been making this dish for years, and am just reviewing it for the first time suprisingly. It's such a simple and delicious preparation. I upped the veggie quotient in mine by including red pepper, celery, and carrots when I sauteed the onions. It really was more like a Moroccan stew and next time I could see cutting up the chicken before cooking it and just mixing everything together. It was all perfect with saffron scented couscous with slivered almonds. I can't believe I waited so long to revisit this wonderful dish!

I must admit ~ i was a little afraid of how it would turn out, mind you i havent cooked a meal in a while, so i was surprised, just loved it ~ mind you its nothing compared to my mother in-laws cooking (morocain) but it turned out great for someone who tried it out for a potluck and my friends up here just loved it ~ its one to make for my others friends for sure ~

This is a truly fabulous dish! I've made it dozens of times; each time, everyone - without exception - loved it. Suggestions: boost the amount of dried fruit, and let the chicken simmer in the sauce longer. This recipe is so fabulous, in fact, that it's what convinced my husband-to-be that I was the one for him. It (and he) is a keeper.

Moroccans don't typically pair prunes with chicken. They do however use raisins or apricots with chicken. They use prunes with beef and lamb.

Rating: 2
Not sure why all the raves...this is a pleasant everyday meal in my book. Used half prunes, half apricots and chicken thighs as others have suggested. Since there are only two of us, the half of this dish will go into the freezer for another day. See no reason why it wouldn't thaw and reheat without a problem.

I LOVE this dish! Easy and super delicious!

Quick meal that came together easily. It was great because I usually have the ingredients on-hand. Couscous was a nice side.

This was delicious as is. I made it a second time and added one chopped red chile pepper to the onions and garlic, and doubled the garlic. Used grated ginger instead of ground. To me it tasted better. The flavors hit you first, and the chile heat comes on subtly afterwards...nice with the sweetness.

One of my favorite chicken recipes. I add a few more prunes and pour the sauce over the couscous as well. Simple and yummy!

This is one of those times when I just don't agree with the other reviewers. I really didn't like this dish, but maybe it's just me. Be sure to make it the day before, it tastes much better the next day. It's also very easy and quick to prepare. If you have small children, I do, don't make it. The kids won't eat it.

Rating: 3
Easy to make and delicious! It lacked salt, though; next time I would use regular chicken broth, not low sodium. I used a bit more of each spice, added a pinch of ground cloves, threw in a few dried apricots, and added some toasted almonds, which gave it a lovely crunch. Served it over couscous. It gets better every day.

Wordy as I often read reviews too vague as to plus or minus in amounts. Thanks Allison from Seattle & Cook from LA. Prepared 2 days prior as was serving for after-church lunch; everyone said, "Do this one, again!". Used 4# (10) chicken thighs w/bone & skin so incr. spices, garlic & onion by 1/4; not quite enough for 24oz chicken stock. Added 2 TB flour, 4 TB lemon juice, 2 TB honey, 3/4 c. ea. prunes & apricots plus 1/3 c. green olives as many Moroccan dishes include them. Next time, for same amt. of stock shall use 5 TB lemon juice, 3 TB honey, 1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes, 1 tsp. paprika & 1 full cup olives .. figs or dates sound good too! Table looked like Christmas w/white, red & green rice plus cuke, onion & tomato salad! Am looking forward to tonight's left-overs. To cook from Atlanta..recipes shouldn't be changed to something else, entirely, (cream..yuk!). Tinker w/ basic ingredients or search for another recipe.

This dish is as easy as it is delicious! I highly recommend it. I will definitely try it again. The chicken turned out tender and the prunes with the sauce are wonderful.

Yum - the seasonings in this were delicious. The sauce made a lot more than just for 4 breasts, although if I'd served with plain rice or cous cous I may have spooned additional sauce over. As it was, I served to company with epicurious' "apricot and pistachio baked rice". I substited the prunes with 1/2 dried apricots and 1/2 dates and it was wonderful. I also added crushed red pepper to spice it up a bit which worked well because it was so sweet (but in a good way!) Don't know if it was authentic, but it worked very well with what I had on hand.

This was delicious. I also used thighs instead of breasts. Great change from my usual couscous recipe. I thought the honey would make it too sweet but the lemon juice balanced it perfectly.

Not the real thing, but a good quick approximation. I tinkered with it a bit - baked in the oven and added tomatoes, apricots and some wine. Olives are good too

nice flavors, but the prunes overwhelmed it, or so I thought. I think if I made it again I would just use a couple of prunes and maybe chop them up

Rating: 3
Great recipe. Highly recommend it. My husband never eats ethnic foods so I didn't tell him what it was and he loved it. I added dried apricots and prunes. I also added extra chicken broth cause the sauce is really thick and I thought the chicken and couscous was a little dry. Very easy recipe and yes, would be a great recipe for entertaining.

Actually, I don't think 4 forks is a high enough rating! I used thighs because I prefer the flavor. I did not change a single ingredient! My husband and I loved it and deem it "company for dinner worthy"!

I loved this recipe. I made it with chicken thighs and cooked them for about 20 minutes after browning. I also served sauteed lettuce and rice. Very rich and fulfilling dish. Used prunes and plums. Definitely will make again!

Having travelled around Morocco earlier this year, I've been working my way through as many Moroccan recipes as possible since then. This isn't as complex as many, but easy & very good (though the chicken & dried figs one on the website is better, if you like fruit/meat combinations). To the Cook from Atlanta - adding cream to a dish like this would make a sickly (& totally inauthentic) mess. And it's not a curry.

terrific dish. I was tempted to use fresh ginger thinking the powder would not suffice. Glad i stuck to recipe as is. delicious. I made it in morning and served that eve -perfect amt of time to let flavors "marry"t

A very easy dish with different layers of textures and flavors. The next time I will add some apricots and garbanzo beans. The sauce is perfect for either rice or couscous

I have to say that the prunes went together very nicely. It was all right the next day. I served it with cous cous to make it more interesting. The sauce ended up a little too thick for me.

Delicious, easy to prepare and a welcome change from my usual chicken dishes. Next time I will serve with couscous & chickpeas prepared with chicken broth to round out the dish. It might be nice to sprinkle with a few slivered almonds for crunch as well.

Too much work for the result. It was a one-note dish - the curry was IT. Okay for diet food, but keep your expectations low (I felt like adding cream to give it some richness.)

Very yummy! I added dried cranberries to balance out the prunes and it was nice, but i think it would be even better with fresh ones for a tangier flavor. A nice combination of flavors. I served it with jasmine rice tossed with cranberries and pine nuts.

I thought this recipe was very good and not too much work. We added apricots and some raisins and made extra sauce so as to have fruit with every bite. (thanks to the suggestions of other reviewers) Also, we were generous with the cilantro. I will definitely make this again.

Of all the recipes I have tried from this site, this is certainly the best for the effort. It is a simple, wonderful dish that has received nothing but rave reviews at dinner parties. Cous Cous with onions and pignoles or with spiced oil complements this dish wonderfully. If the prunes are too sweet, try apricots.

This was really interesting and delicious. I ended up using some chopped up apricots in addition to the prunes. It turned out very very good over brown rice.

I expanded this recipe to feed 50 at a "Morrocan" themed banquet and it was absolutely delicious, won rave reviews. I reduced the amount of prunes by half and added chopped, dried apricots. Added more texture. Suggest using big, plump prunes as they really add to flavour.

Rating: 3
I made this with dried apricots, which is what I had on hand, but I'd like to try it with prunes, too. I have to say that when we first tasted the dish we thought it was okay but not great--a wo-fork recipe. But then we had the leftover the next day, and wow! Suddenly it was a three-fork recipe. The flavors really marry and are greatly enhanced by time, so next time I'll make it and then serve it the next day. I'll also include more dried fruit, because it was best with the fruit in every bite.

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe. The sauce is thick and somewhat heavy, so we paired the dish with a lighter textured cous cous and steamed vegetables which made a nice compliment. I would recommend cutting up and simmering the chicken in the sauce for more than two minutes -- I let it simmer for 10+ minutes so that the flavors would really penetrate the chicken. Turned out great, and the chicken was extra-tender as a result. Made great leftovers too!

The sauce is quite unique with regard to the ingredients. Consequently the taste is exquisitely piquant. A simple recipe that exudes a complex mouthfeel.

After reading the previous reviews I thought this dish would be a lot better than it was. It was good but not great. I thought the colour of the sauce was rather insipid and was lacking a little something ( not sure what, maybe curry or a little tomato). I'm still searching for the ultimate Moroccan chicken recipe.

This dish is absolutely FABULOUS!! I have made it several times since it was published in 1997, and each time it is a winner! The second time I made it, I made the mistake of telling my son there were prunes in it and he almost refused to eat it. Then, he tried it. Now, he can't get enough of it!!!

This dish really is delicious! To make it a one dish meal, I thawed in the microwave a 10oz box of frozen spinach, drained it, and spread it over the chicken, spooned over it the sauce and plums mixture, covered it and simmered it as per the recipe's directions. The spicy sauce and spinach complimented each other. Try it!!!!

Absolutely facbulous! Try it with prunes even if don't normally like them. They add something wonderful to this dish. Easy to make and people will think you've cooked all day. Remember to have plenty of couscous when you make this dish
