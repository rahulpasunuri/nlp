I added honey to cut some of the tartness and served on a bed of shredded of napa cabbage. We all liked it and I'll definitely make it again.

My family enjoyed this because we all love shrimp, but we didn't feel it was anything special. Sauce was good but not great. Still looking for a super grilled shrimp dish.

Quick, easy, and tasty. A good choice for a light dinner on a hot July evening in Florida. Butterflying the shrimp before marinading them allowed the ponzu sauce to really sink in and provide a lot of flavor in a short time. I served the shrimp with stir-fried vegetables and coconut-ginger jasmine rice. While I did not find the taste exceptional (still looking for the "perfect" ponzu sauce), the ease of preparation makes this a recipe I will make again soon.

Well, I liked it. My husband liked it. I will cook it again. I did not have all the ingredients, used ground ginger, served the shrimp just on its own.

I can reccomend American people to try this. I bet you'll like this recipe.

I admit that I used medium shrimp instead of jumbo shrimp, but they were lacking in flavor. This is not my favorite ponzu sauce, although I love Japanese cuisine. I do not recommend making this dish if you are not willing to pay extra for the huge shrimp.

One of the best shrimp dishes I've ever had! Definitely do the Napa cabbage instead of the bok choy. Don't overmarinate, or the lemon will become overwhelming. Believe it or not, using the sauce to marinate chicken (1 hour) gave me even better results!

I thought this dish was delicious. The marinade gives the shrimp just enough flavor without overwhelming. We served it over Napa cabbage, but I agree that it would be delicious over rice, mixed greens, or alone.

I have made this recipe many times. It's great. I like Napa Cabbage much better than the Bok Choy. I use either extra large or jumbo shrimp. Grill the Pineapple and serve it with the shrimp.

The marinade is great, I served it over napa cabbage and made soba noodles w/ tofu on the side. It was a really filling and good tasting dinner.

Fabulous! I served it over rice because I didn't have any bok choy. It was truly a memorable dish and will serve it again on Mother's Day.
