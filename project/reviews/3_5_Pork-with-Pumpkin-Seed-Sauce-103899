I liked this: still convinced that sikil p'ak is the best pumpkinseed-based sauce, though! This is my favorite version: www.thenomadicoven.com/sikil-pak

This sauce is basically a variation on a traditional green mole sauce. I added a little cumin and more jalepeno than called for. I let it reduce quite a bit longer than the recipe called for and it got very thick and the flavors concentrated perfectly. Overall, it was fantastic and served it with tortillas, etc. One of our favorite meals so far from this website (it's just hard for me to give anything 4 forks)!
