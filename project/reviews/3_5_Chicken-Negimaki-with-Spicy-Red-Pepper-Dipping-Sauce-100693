Made this for dinner tonight and it was fantastic! Everyone loved it...even the picky eaters. So easy to make also! Instead of rolling the scallions up in the pounded out chicken, I chopped a bunch of green onions (I doubled the recipe), and added them to the marinade. Then cut the breasts into strips and marinated about 6 hours. Will definitely be making this often.

The recipe was very time consuming to prepare and the result was not worth the effort. Both the chicken and the sauce were bland.

This was good. Very tasty! Easy, too. But I felt that the "presentation" aspect of it was lacking. I also thought it would be better if placed, say, atop some soba noodles? But all in all, tasty and easy! The sauce was great. Note that the sauce made a lot...could easily halve it.

Taste of chicken negimaki was good and the sauce was great. However, I did not think it presented as well as previous reviewers indicated and I certainly got less than 65.

I wasn't too keen on the sauce, but the guests at my party loved it. The negamaki was very good. I doubled the recipe, and it still was gone in a flash.

To the cook from Dallas: soak your bamboo skewers in warm water for half an hour before using them--they still get charred, but at least they don't catch on fire. As for this recipe, we love it. We sell it as an appetizer, with the negimaki slices plated around a small mound of soba noodles w/sesame. The sauce is simply outstanding, quite versatile, and drop-dead easy.

I haven't made this recipe yet, but I will say the beef negimaki recipe on this site is very good (see beef and scallion rolls from gourmet magazine). Don't pay attention to the cutting and measuring though. Just pound out some flank or flap meat into rectangular shapes that will cozy up to the whole scallions. Put a light coating of oil on wax paper and the negimaki are easy to roll up and tie. I find that gourmet magazine likes its readers to jump through culinary hoops, whereas the shrewd chef skips them all together.

I've made this dish twice now--once rolling ponded chicken around scallions (served with raspberry chipotle-marinated shrimp wrapped in bacon and chorrizo quesadillas with tomatillas) and once cutting up chicken and scallions into one-inch pieces (a la cart the next day with the same batch of marinade). They both turned out great and neither way was difficult. I was so eager to eat both times that I simply forgot all about the toasted sesame seeds, but my boyfriend didn't notice and neither did I. The sauce is absolutely awesome I doubled it and wasn't sorry. It's good for any chicken. Or possibly coconut shrimp? Make this dish to impress company(so pretty), or to be worshipped at home as a cooking goddess (or god). Somedy I will not be too hungry to add the seeds.

Great recipe and always a head turner. When punding breasts, sing heavy duty ziplock instead of plastic wrap is a big improvement.

I loved these and will definitely make again. Rather than rolling around a scallion, I simply cut the chicken into 2-inch pieces to marinate. I marinated them overnight in gallon sized zip-lock bags. Then I put a couple of pieces on bamboo skewers and cooked on the grill. Use caution not to let the skewers get too close to the flame. I also rolled them in sesame seeds after cooking with good results. This was a great spring-time party appetizer. I grilled these the afternoon of the party and then warmed about 10 minutes in the oven before serving. Although I tripled the recipe, I think a single portion of the sauce would have been sufficient. Great dish! I also think this would work well for a sit-down dinner by simply using whole, boneless chicken breasts.

These were great. Tying was a challenge, but they held together nicely during cooking of course. The sesame seeds provide a pleasant texture and taste. Sauce was definitely too sweet but would be great if you cut the sugar I bet. But a great party dish that isn't too hard to make, has great taste, and makes for a nice presentation.

After trying this recipe with the chicken, I ventured to try it with beef. The marinade was great on the beef as well. And the dipping sauce makes the dish considering how simple it was. I admit, the 1/2 c of sugar was too sweet for my taste buds and maybe cut it back by half. Trying to tie up the meat is a challenge and used toothpicks to keep the rolls shaped. I sliced between the toothpicks and let my guests help themselves.

I love this recipe. I have left out the scallions and instead i cut the chicken into cubes and thread them onto the skewers alternating with pieces of red peppers. after marinating them all night I take them out, roll them in the sesame seeds and bake them on foil lined baking sheets. I have given this recipe out to dozens of people they all love it.

This was very good. I agree with the cook who suggested doing it in strips threaded onto a skewer instead of rolling. I would try that next time. Sauce is fabulous. Great, HEALTHY recipe!

Made this for a graduation party to RAVE reviews of all who attended. Also had some problem with sesame seeds, and next time will try suggestion to coat with toasted seeds after cooking. Didn't bother with tying up step -- just packed the rolls tightly into pan and then cooked them seam-side down first. They stayed together perfectly.

This was excellent, especially the sauce. Making the chicken rolls was time-consuming (especially snipping the string) but the presentation was beautiful. That said, I'd like to make this more often for casual entertaining, so next time I'm going to marinate chunks of chicken instead of taking the time to pound, roll, tie, and untie, and I think it will taste just as good.

I have not prepared this recipe although I will ( just become aware of it tonight), but to the last reviewer who had the problems with the sesame seeds, perhaps it would work if tou rolled the rolls as soon as they were cooked into toasted sesame seeds.

This was a hit at a party we had, even with people who are scared of anything different. The sauce is amazing and not at all hard to make. I thought this was very time consuming, in terms of pounding, tying, etc., but the taste and presentation were worth it. The major problem I had was the sesame seeds!!! They wouldn't stick while I was cooking the rolls, then burned in the pan!!! Did anyone else have/solve this problem?

A little time consuming, but oh so worth it. I intend to try this in some form as a dinner main course.

This was a huge hit at a recent party I hosted. It can easily sit out at room temperature and the sauce is great. Definitely will go in my "tried and true" file.

Absolute delish! PLEASE - make the sauce, it makes the dish in my opinion. Will definately make again and again, and I hardly make any thing twice.

The hit of our party! In reading the recipe it seemed that it would be rather time-consuming to make but once I got started I found it to go quite quickly. I did add a couple of strips of red pepper with the scallion in each roll for presentation purposes, nice addition. While the sauce was very good, it was largely untouched by my guests. I'm not that was but would definitely recommend cutting it in half so as to not end up with so much leftover. Great recipe for a large party! You can cook ahead, remove the strings and reheat at about 350 for 5 minutes or so. Makes your life much easier at crunch time to get all the food out.

Great recipe! I made two rolls and half the marinade. Didn't need to tie the rolls. I think the secret is to flatten the chicken very thin and it sticks to itself. My husband and I had this with martinis. The next time I make it I'm tempted to put something else with the scallions. The red pepper sauce is great.

Made this for a cocktail party..it was the first dish to go! I liked, not loved the dipping sauce. You really didn't need it as the chicken was so tasty on its own!

Rating: 3
Other reviewers suggested that this was a good recipe but that the rolling stage was a pain. I pounded the chicken down as suggested in the recipe but cut the breasts into strips. I added the scallions chopped up to the marinade since I wasn't rolling the chicken. I baked the chicken in a 375 oven on a sprayed cookie sheet for maybe 20 minutes, flipping the chicken part way through. I also added hot chinese sesame oil to the sauce since we like things spicy. It was a hit at our superbowl party!

This was not an easy recipy to prepare. Chicken is not easily rolled around the scallions and you can forget about trying to tie string around the rolls by yourself -- very frustrating as the chicken kept unrolling. The amount of marinade is only enough to coat the bottom of the dish -therefore unless you constantly turn the rolls only one side gets marinaded. Very salty. Cooking the chicken was another issue -- the marinade combined with the oil during cooking and spattered everywhere - so messy. The rolls took a long time to cook all the way through. I had to put them back in the pan after they appeared too well-cooked outside because the insides were not done. After all is said and done, they looked fancy but tasted dried out and salty. Save this one for ordering at a Japanese restaurant

This hors d'oeuvre was very popular at our Christmas party and relatively easy to prepare. We did have some difficulty rolling the chicken around the scallions and were concerned that the presentation would be sloppy, but we resolved this by putting toothpicks into the rolls before slicing the chicken into the bite-size pieces. The sauce was delicious - the sweet and sour flavors and the bright red color added a nice contrast to the chicken.

This was very popular. Due to time constraints, I served it up as follows: after marinating the chicken, I cut it up into cubes and fried as directed. I then spiked one cube onto a skewer and displayed all the skewers around a pot of the dipping sauce. This worked very well. I had about 3 times too much sauce so suggest cutting down on sauce ingredients. I wish I'd made more of the chicken in any case. The sesame seeds tasted a bit bitter once toasted so next time I'll leave them out.

I also made this as an entree, served with rice and stir-fried veggies. It is so good! I am planning to make it as part of an hors d'ouvres buffet for our office Xmas party, and will try the red bell pepper suggestion to add a festive holiday touch.

It is very tasty and the presentation is pretty. I might roll up a thin strip of red bell pepper with the scallion for a little more color.

Very tasty dish... however, I made it as a main course instead of an appetizer and served it with rice (cooked with leeks, ginger and garlic) and green beans. Like everyone else has said, the dipping sauce with so few ingredients is easy to make and tastes wonderful. A must try!

So easy! The only work was pounding out the chicken. It doubled well and was a huge hit at a recent party. The sauce was thinner than I thought, but wonderful! To keep the chicken moist and make sure it cooked all the way through (which can be hard with rolls), I put the lid on my skillet as they cooked. It really helped. I'll definitely make this again!

Ok, I agree with everyone that this is amazing and the sauce is so surpisingly good for how little work/ingrediants it takes. I wanted to add some new comments. First, I think this would be just fine if you cut the chicken in long strips instead of rolling it up, etc. The chicken cooks much more quickly and evenly, avoiding overcooking and it looks great squeward lengthwise. MUCH less work. You must try this regarless of how you choose to cook it. I would love to hear from anyone who baked it instead of frying. I think this would cook more evenly but didn't know what temp/how long to do it. Oh and making the red pepper sauce at least a day ahead is a must!

Wow! This dish is really a show-stopper. It tastes as great as it looks. The reviews are correct; it takes a lot of time to put it all together, but boy is it worth it! My suggestions: marinate in a large zipper bag for at least 24 hours (makes turning easy, cook rolls in a non-stick skillet with the oil to keep the seeds on the rolls and cook about 2 minutes longer than the recipe states (total of about 12 minutes).

Awesome recipe. I've made it twice and both times it was a huge hit. Don't tie the breasts with thread if you don't have twine - total nightmare. We skewered each cut piece with a toothpick before cutting, it keep everything together and worked like a charm to dip into the sauce.

Rating: 3
This is a great dish! I've served it at three parties now and it has always been the first thing devoured. It is high maintenance, but has an impressive presentation and is delicious. I've tried using green leaves of the scallions as a tie instead of the twine, and it works and eliminates the need to cut the ties off after cooking.

I had a little trouble keeping the seasame seeds on the chicken, but overall it turned out to be a great dish. My guests loved it. The red pepper sauce is fabulous. It's incredibly easy to prepare and acutally tastes better the next day. It also makes a tasty dipping sauce for cold or hot spring rolls.

This was very very good. We loved it but it was sooo high maintenance. When you tie the breasts, it takes forever and you must be careful frying for even cooking. If you have the time, you will love it but what a pain to make!!

Very impressive presentation. Prep is not difficult but requires considerable time. I used petite asparagus spears for half of the rolls which made a more interesting presentation than the onion but the flavor with the onion was superior. I would recommend marinating the rolls for no less than overnight and making the sauce at least the day before to allow the red pepper to infuse. I presented the negimaki pieces on a black plate giving sharp contrast to the dish. Enjoy!
