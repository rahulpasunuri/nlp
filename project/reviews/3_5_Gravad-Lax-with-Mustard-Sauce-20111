Don't be afraid of this recipe. I came home from a fishing trip with 133lbs of salmon and I couldn't wait to try new things. This dish is going to make you feel like a real gourmet. I used vodka instead of the cognac and added crushed juniper berries. So feel free to experiment. I used coho salmon (silver in US) which has an amazing deep red colour. Sensational! The fish was frozen at the lodge. I will make this again and again!

I followed the directions for this and "gravlax" ( a seperate recipe) but found it too hard to slice properly. I cut the 3 1/2 lbs I made into 1 inch wide strips. I took one of them and lightly brushed it with liquid smoke and baked it for 15 minutes at 350 degrees, then chilled it. I think it was great - it turned flakey - tastes great by itself or would be great in omelets or salads. I took the rest of the pieces and smoked them in my gas BBQ and got great results.

Good recepie. I do, as i live in Brazil, a "brazilian variety. I use cane sugar in stead of regular sugar, and use cachaca, our national booze, in stead of cognac. I thought however that the Swedish use Aquavit, and not cognac. And after marinating, i brush each filet with extra virgin olive oil, and wrap it in plastic film, to conserve it better. Enjoy!

I make this often - but use double the amount of whole cracked pepper and I use black not white. Any alcohol will do and I have used whisky and bourbon. Farmed salmon is better than wild but I didn't realise you could use frozen. Easy to make but hard to slice properly

I have not tried the recipe for Gravad Lax, but plan on doing it at my daughter's for Christmas. For those people who are concerned about parasites, I have worked in the seafood concession of a well-known supermarket chain for the past four years and have filleted countless salmon, and I have never found parasites of any kind in farm raised salmon. Also, the farm raised salmon is fresher by far than any other salmon we sell, its freshness is never in question when it arrives at our store.

The "gravad lax" can be made with other kinds of alcohol, for instance norvegian "akevitt", or none at all. Dried dill can be used in an emergency, and the allspice is not necessary. BUT: In Norway we use FROZEN salmon to avoid/kill parasites and other nasty bugs.

SALMON SOMETIMES HAVE PARASITE. HOW SAFE IS THIS GRAVAD LAX WAY OF PREPARING SALMON FROM PARASITE INFESTATION?

As a non-fish lover (except for shellfish)I only made this for a group of guests knowing they wo9uld like it. Everyone raved so about it's flavor that I broke down and gave it a try. WOW! It melts in your mouth with a wonderful, slightly salty taste and NO fishy aftertaste. I served it with a German Reisling and I've been begged to serve it again at our next dinner party.

Pretty good for a first try. Iv'e had the real thing in Europe. Questions though.. Do I really need the booze? Is dryed dill ok to use? I'ts winter here. I used brown or turbano (raw) sugar seems to give a fuller flavor???
