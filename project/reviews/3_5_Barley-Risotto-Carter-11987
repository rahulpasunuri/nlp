Yummy. I used 2 cups of broth and 1 cup of water and it was plenty (left out the last cup of water). I also left out the mint and added about a teaspoon of lemon juice.

This has a nice, chewy texture and loads of flavor - and really good for you if you use barley that hasn't been 'over pearled'. It's going into my regular rotation.

Easy, though not quick. Substituted cremini mushrooms and asparagus for peas and nuts, added a generous amount of grated Parmesan cheese. Very good, would make again for guests, perhaps with chicken.

Delicious. You could .... but don't change a thing! This is a healthy (South Beach friendly) alternative to white rice!

This was simple to make and much quicker than risotto. It lacks that heavy substantial taste but is none the less, delicious. I did not add canned peas and used chopped basil in place of parsley.

This is a terrific variation on risotto, very hearty and nutty (especially with the nuts). I've made it twice with minor variations (walnuts instead of pecans, lemon juice instead of zest, no mint) depending on what I had on hand. It's very easy to tweak. And the taste is just very classy and sophisticated, even as it's so healthy.

This is really good. I think I'd like it better with orange or lime zest, instead of lemon.

This is a great, easy weeknight main for two people (I half the recipe and serve with a salad). Great flavor combinations and a hearty, cool-weather treat.

OK, so I can't really rate this recipe, because I made so many changes, but... the idea of using the pearled barley for risotto is wonderful and if you do not have these exact indregients on hand, use whatever you like... I used garlic, onion, parmesean, a little buttermilk, Only used 2 cups of stock and one cup of water and a little dried basil. Amazing, and I can't wait to try it with everything else random I have around!

Wonderful & easy side! I didnt have herbs/lemon but threw in chives & some grated romano. Got 2 thumbs up (highest rating) from very picky 9 yr old.

Excellent when I left out the water- otherwise it is too wet, and serve with parmesan.

This dish is a regular at my house. It's great as a side, but I've served it as the main course for a casual dinner with some vegetarian friends. Try substituting dry white wine for about 1/3 of the stock.

Very filling recipe. Good use of barley - as another reviewer says this recipe lends itself well to experimentation.

Very delicious. I added mushrooms and garlic when cooking the onions and used mixed veggies instead of the peas for some added colour.

This was a tasty side dish. I really just used the recipe as a springboard. Knowing enough about risotto to feel comfortable making it, I made use of whatever I had in the house. I added about 1/4 cup less broth at the end. I was halfway through cooking the barley when I realized that I had no peas and no mint. I decided against using pecans because of the high fat content. I used arugula, parsley, and oregano. I added extra salt and pepper. It was really great. Barley has a wonderful testure that is rarely found in rice-- it's nutty and has so much body. Try it!! And have no fear-- mix in whatever you want.

Have made this many times! Didn't change anything and wouldn't . . . it has always been great! Great flavor, great change of pace!

Very easy and a nice change from the traditional side dish options (rice, potato, cous-cous, etc.) I took the suggestion of another reviewer and omitted the pecans and mint and added the mushrooms and peas. It simplified the meal even further by doubling as a vegetable too.

What a great way to prepare barley! I didn't have any mint but used everything else; it was wonderful. Will definitely make this recipe again; I think it lends itself to experimentation.

Excellent! I omitted the pecans and mint and added mushrooms. This was a really nice way to have barley instead of in soup.
