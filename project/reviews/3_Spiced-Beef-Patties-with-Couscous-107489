Only giving this 2 stars because it is just the beginning of the recipe, but when doctored up it's FANTASTIC. As is written, it's pretty uninteresting. I followed previous reviewers and made the following additions: 1. Used Israeli couscous - highly recommend. 2. I didn't make the beef in to patties, but sauteed the onion, then added the gound beef, all spices shown but upped the cinammon and cayenne, about a cup of golden raisins, 1/3 cup of crushed almonds. Then, added the cooked couscous to the skillet and stirred in about a 1/3 cup of feta. Salt & Pepper. 3. Served with a yogurt sauce of plain yogurt, black pepper and a minced garlic clove. Topped with cilantro as shown. This made for an amazing, different comfort food meal that will be in our regular rotation. Raisins in particular are a must. We loved it.

I really enjoyed this recipe. My husband suggested that it might go well with a creamy sauce of some variety to cut the heat a bit. This is a great way to make leftover ground beef a little more interesting.

This was very tasty but it needed a little bit of salt.

I added feta to the patties and a small amount of fresh mint and oregano from my garden. I didn't have couscous, so used quinoa instead. Then I dressed the quinoa with more mint, olive oil and lemon juice and some fresh tomatoes. My husband had two full helpings! I'd give my variation four forks, this recipe is just a start for better things.

Will definitely make again. Thanks for the tips- added chicken broth, almonds, & golden raisins to couscous. Added feta to patties and sauteed onions before adding. Excellent combination of spices. Also only made half the recipe since I'm just cooking for two. Quick, easy, delicious Monday night meal.

Thanks to previous reviewers for the suggestions. I made the patties as directed but added feta and chopped cilantro and substituted chili garlic sauce for cayenne, which I was out of. Used whole wheat couscous made with chicken stock, golden raisins, toasted sliced almonds, and chopped scallions and served with steamed carrots. My four year old and I both really liked it.

This was very tasty but did not blow me away. I will make it again, but I will add some salt to the patty mix (or else will try with feta as others have tried). Added golden raisins to the couscous (delicious!) and will also add slivered almonds next time.

Made recipe as is and thought it turned out nicely. Not spectacular, but I would make it again. Very easy and very tastey.

This was good, not great, but a decent option for a weekday. If I make it again, I will cook the onions first next time.

diced green onions, not peppers :)

this was a good base recipe but i cooked a couple of test patties as i added spices and it required a lot of tweaking. i cut back on the black pepper and upped the cumin and cinnamon as well as adding a little salt and some feta. sauteed red bell peppers to go in the couscous and topped it all with diced green peppers. turned out great but not because of this recipe. it was just the start of an idea...

I left off the cayenne (since my 7-yo doesn't like 'spicy' food) and added salt, plus took the advice about including feta. I bundled the cheese in the center and called these "inside-out cheeseburgers" (for the 7 yo). Prepared on a stove-top grill and served with a huge salad and a lovely couscous that also had barley and oat flakes (i.e. quite hearty). The light breath of cinnamon was just right, and my son asked me to save the one remaining so he can have it again tomorrow night. Perfect for a rainy Tuesday night! Will plan ahead next time so I have a few sprigs of fresh mint on hand.

Had the patties one night and turned the rest into a meat loaf for another night. Seemed like a waste of a lot of good ingredients. Tastewise, I'm not sure why it didn't work.

Very nice! I wish I had some harissa (chilly pepper paste) to spice things up! I added almond slivers, saffron, chicken stock, cinnamon and white raisins to the couscous; unfortunately I could not find fresh cilantro at the grocery store I went to before preparing this meal. I did try the feta in the meat patties, it was ok. As a side dish, I had also added chickpeas sauteed in a pan with onion, black pepper, salt and curry. YUMM! Next time I would like to add more cooked vegetables.

The recipe prepared as described here is OK at best. I made the following changes: I squished a cube of feta into each patty (making sure it was all covered so it would still fry well), I grilled the patties on a griddle on the frying pan (no oil), and I sauteed the couscous in oil and made it with cinnamon-infused broth. As others have said, a great, easy weeknight meal.

Very quick, easy, tasty. I increased the cayenne and made a yogurt sauce with parsley, garlic and black pepper. Perfect weeknight meal.

Not so hot... It didn't especially please anyone in my family, and it made the whole house stinky

Very simple and tasty. Added more of all spices and added salt then cooked on the grill. There weren't any left!!

I ran out of ideas for dinner and came across this recipe. Very tasty and highly recommended! I didn't have any coriander so I substituted fennel seed instead. It came out delicious! I will definitely make again! Thank You

This was fantastic for a quick weeknight meal. Like another cook, I thought plain yogurt would complement the dish, so I added some of that. Perfect addition.

This is very close to Chapli Kebab, a Pakistani dish my husband loves. I added one clove chopped garlic and one small thai chili for extra kick. I would serve this with basmati rice pilaf, yogurt sauce, and a salad. Yummy.

I agree with previous comments, it would be better with lamb. I added extra spice but it still was missing a little omph. However it was very easy (I mixed the spices and meat the night before). It is ok for a quick weekday meal.

This is a wonderful and easy recipe. I sauteed the onions with about 1/3 of the spices which probably mellowed it somewhat -- it was great!

Made this for six and everyone loved it. I went a little heavy on the spice, used some extra onion, and used less water. Tasted very middle eastern, at least as i am used to it. Also, sauteed the couscous in olive oil, then added the hot broth to it, along with some cardomom and a cinnamon stick -- delicious! (recipe is in mark bittman's how to cook everything)

I thought this dish was only okay. The patties were more spicy (hot) than flavorful. Maybe it was my beef - but I think it would be better with ground lamb or venison as one reviewer suggested. I made a yogurt-feta sauce with it and I thought the patties were much better with the sauce. However, my husband liked the patties much more than I (3 forks' worth) and didn't like the sauce at all.

I make this dish and grill it on the bbq. I serve it with hummus and tabbouli salad with pitas. My husband asks for it all the time.

I added cilantro to the patties and actually used ground venison- the spices were a perfect compliment to its gaminess. also added some curry powder to the couscous- delicious.

My family enjoys this, we've had it a few times.

I used pearl couscous for this recipe which worked very nicely. Instead of shaping the patties, I just cooked the beef and mixed in the couscous. I also mixed in some goat cheese, which made the dish a bit creamy. My only criticism is that the pepper (both types) were too overpowering. Next time, I'll reduce the amount of pepper by half, so I can better taste the other spices.

I couldn't get the patties to gel, so I ended up just sauteing the beef mixture, then serving it mixed with couscous. Didn't have fresh cilantro on hand, but it was OK without it. Took another reader's suggestion and served it with steamed carrots. My husband was suspicious during preparation, but was pleasantly surprised by the outcome.

What a delicious and easy way to use up ground beef! I was very surprised. I served the patties with pita bread and a quick parsley-yogurt sauce. (I substitute parsley for cilantro b/c I don't like it, but I was otherwise faithful to the recipe.) Fantastic.

Very good...I served it with curry couscous, pita bread and sour cream. Delicious! Mint is a must!

Great to find a tasty meal that doesn't require a bunch of expensive ingredients. Served this dish with steamed carrots. Try it.

This was a very tasty entree. I made it with Israeli couscous, which I first toasted in the skillet before I added the liquid. Next time, for the meat, I would decrease the water and olive oil by one-third each.
