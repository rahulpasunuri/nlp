Great Snakin Recipe! My husband and I had this for a late afternoon snack with white wine. We ate two lbs of large shrimp!. This is the best. I have used this recipe for years, at least 10. It is a great change-of-pace recipe. Highly recommend

Very good. My folks make a very unhealthy, buttery scampi and I will encourage them to try this recipe as a healthier replacement. I was out of wine and wanted to give it a shot w/ dry sherry and it worked out well. I'm sure it's better w/ wine, but for those looking for an alternative, I think it worked well. I'm not rating, as I feel you shouldn't when you change major ingredients...

I thought this was really good. My husband thought it was delicious. I did not like the dried rosemary. Next time will use fresh. Doubled the sauce and used chicken broth for the wine. (didn't have any white wine on hand.) My husband suggested that next time we start the sauce with a roux. I served with rice cooked in chicken broth.

i would definitely make this again but next time I would remove the shells. I served it with rice and added the rice to the skillet after I removed the shrimp. It gave the rice the same wonderful flavor.

Very good and spicy. I serve this with rice or pasta.

I've had this yummy dish in New Orleans and this recipe recreates the fantastic flavor. My "tweak" is to put in a little less rosemary, more butter and (depending on your taste) more garlic--I used a lot more garlic. Also, in Nawlins they add a good bit of freshly ground black pepper.

Not bad...although I have had better. Needs more kick...and maybe a little more rosemary and garlic.

Extremely dissappointing. A waste of shrimp.

Nothing very special about this recipe. It tasted good because the shrimp were fresh and I enjoyed the garlic, but pretty run of the mill.

For every day cooking, this is terrific! Quick (especially since I deveined the shrimp ahead of time), easy, and VERY tasty! I thought the recipe needed more cayenne, and more garlic, but with those changes, I would make this again.

This is an excellent recipe!! Everyone I've served it to loves it. I usually add more butter and a little water to increase the amount of sauce. This is NOLA style BBQ - it reminds me of the Barbecue Shrimp served in shell at Mr. B's in New Orleans. It's delicious!

Is there zero forks? I don't care how authentic or non-authentic this recipe is....still doesn't change the fact that it tastes like CRAP. Don't waste your perfectly good shrimp on this dish. The worchestershire sauce totally overpowers any flavors you add to your pan. Tossing the shrimp and sauce with pasta doesn't help either. You still will feel like you're drinking the W. sauce right out of the bottle....this is quite possibly the worst recipe I've tried yet from BA.

I don't know who these other people are or where they REALLY come from, but this was the most authentic New Orleans recipe posted in here yet. This is the best! Whoever the others are, they need to go to New Orleans for a real experience and quit griping from long distance. This recipe rules!

This is an excellent and easy-to-make recipe for shrimp. I particularly like the idea of serving it over angel hair pasta and I would add some minced garlic when making it with pasta.

Tho I now live in Orlando, Fl. I spent years living on the Louisiana bayou and as a restaurant manager and consultant in New Orleans. I don't know where they got this recipe but I do know one thing. It's definately NOT Cajun, Arcadian, New Orleans, or any other style I have ever tasted. I would give this a minus 4 spoons if I could.

Not very good at all, more like a bad attempt at New Orleans cooking.
