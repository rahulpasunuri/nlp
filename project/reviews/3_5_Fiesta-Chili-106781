This was delicious! I modified slightly because of what I had in my pantry! I used black beans instead of kidney beans and used 2 cans of green chiles instead of a fresh green pepper. I also threw in a bag of Trader Joe's Roasted Frozen Corn, which definitely added to the "fiesta" and was delicsous. This recipe makes a ton! My husband loved it and we will most certainly make it again.

I have made this recipe several times and it is a family favorite and especially good if you make it the day ahead.

Ive made this chili recipe twice, both times when I was entertaining, and both times I get rave reviews on how wonderful it is. Its a hearty spicy chili, more meat than beans. Friends are still asking me for the recipe months later.

Nice spicy chili but not worth the effort. Made this for a chili cook-off at work yesterday and it only received 2 votes! I'm going to stick to my own tried and true chili.

We had a chili cook-off today at work and this chili only rated two votes. Last year my own recipe came in 2nd. Lots of work, spicy but watery with the beer (used Stella beer). It was a good chili but my own chili is better. (Didn't change a thing in this recipe)

I played a little with the recipe - couldn't get the sausage it called for, and added corn to the mix for even MORE color - and my kids raved about it so much, I entered my version in a cook-off and won a blue ribbon!

My husband LOVED this chili, but I found it a bit too spicy. However, I have to agree with the previous reviewer that inclusion of peppers make it one of the most colorful, great-looking chili that I've ever seen. :)

This is VERY meaty and very tasty. The peppers make it one of the prettier chilis I've seen. And as a bonus, it tastes even better the second day, after all the flavors have really mingled.

I loved this recipe. I made this for a football party and it was a huge success, it was voted best chili at the party. The only thing I would do different is add another can of beans and tomatoes, otherwise it was fabulous and I plan on making it again very soon.

This was pretty good and my husband raved when he was nibbling it off the stove, but when we actually sat down to eat a meal it didn't have much to make it interesting. Adding all the different spices didn't make a more complex flavour. The chipotle chili is still our favourite.

This is one of the best chilis I have ever tasted. Don't skip any of the meats, especially the Chirozo, it works really well. The Only thing I did differently is use Chipotle peppers instead of Jalapenios; This gave the recepie a wonderfully smoky flavour.

I made this dish for a camping trip and it was great. All the flavors were just wonderful together. The only thing I did differently was use a pound of beef instead of two, one can of beans, and let it slow cook a little bit longer.

This was probably the best chili I've ever made. I didn't make considerable changes to the recipe, but didn't put in as many jalepenos as called for, and I added two cut up Wild Oats chicken chorizo sausages to ground chorizo and 1 lb. ground beef. It was a great, meaty chili with a blend of spices that I have a hard time acheiving when I cook chili impromptu. I will use this as my base recipe from now on.

Unlike some, I am not a true chili devotee, but I do occasionally enjoy a really good bowl of chili. -- Maybe I make a pot every 3 years or so... The batch I concocted this evening was of particular importance because I am pregnant and was not in the mood to be disappointed! :) -- I followed the recipe as best I could, considering that there is a near blizzard raging outside and I wasn't about to head to the store. -- Happily the end result was my idea of chili bliss. I omitted the chorizo because of the nitrite quanitities, used only red peppers and jalapenos because it was what I had on hand, adjusted up the chili powder and worcestire sauce, adjusted down the pepper flakes and cayenne (expecting, remember...) and added a bit more than two cups of homemade tomato sauce with the beer in addition to the tomatoes called for in the recipe. The result was solidly good straight out of the pot, and even better topped with shredded cheddar, minced red and green onions, sour cream, chopped cilantro and a squeeze of fresh lime juice. -- The overall yield was about three quarts of YUM! Thank you to the original creator of this very nice recipe. You made a pregnant lady very happy.
