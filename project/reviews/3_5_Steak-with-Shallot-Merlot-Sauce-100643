I have been making this sauce for years and it is wonderful. The only thing I add is sliced baby bella's. Fabulous!

I started making this dish for my husband and me on New Years Eve about ten years ago and now make it every New Years Eve and a couple of times throughout the year. It is always mouth watering juicy and delicious. It pairs well with the "Mushroom Orzo" from this same website.

The shallot-merlot sauce itself was exceptional, and was the best part of this recipe. I will make this again, but will grill the steaks (or use some other method) instead of cooking them in the skillet. I did not have a problem with getting the sauce to thicken - the key is just to turn up the heat and keep it moving. The faster it boils, the more quickly it will reduce.

I made this tonight for my husband, and we both thought it was great! It was easy, fast, and exceptionally delicious. I don't usually care for Merlot, but had a bottle left over from a dinner party and thought I might as well use it for cooking, since it certainly wasn't fit for drinking! I cooked the sauce a little longer than eight minutes (before adding the butter), and it still turned out great, but I will add more shallots the next time I make it. I served it with wilted spinach with garlic. I will definitely make this again!

This is very elegant and tasty. The best part is that it's easy, so you can have a gourmet meal on a weeknight. Served this with garlic mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus. Also- used margarine in the sauce, rather than butter for my kosher boyfriend and it still came out great.

Served this for guests and everyone enjoyed it. I agree with previous reviews that it takes a long time to get the sauce to the desired consistency.I ended up using cornstarch to thicken and it worked well. Just don't add too much!

This was delicious!!! My husband loved it.I used Bardolino. Used onions and added 2 cloves garlic because i didn't have shallots. Served it with parmesan baked potatoes and spinach.

THE BEST STEAK EVER! I PREFER TO SEAR STEAK THEN SET ASIDE. WHEN SAUCE GETS CLOSE TO SYRUP ADD STEAKS (AND ANY JUICES) TO PAN TO FINISH COOKING. KEEPS TEMP BETTER WHEN SERVING.

This is a great recipe for a dish that is simple to make but looks impressive. The sauce is delicious, but my one criticism is that it took much longer than expected to reduce to a syrupy consistency and eventually I had to give up. I think it would have been much better if it had thickened up.

This dish was so simple and easy to prepare, but comes out beautiful! I paired it with red skin mashed potatoes and the colors complemented each other so well! I made this for my boyfreind for Valentine's Day and he was so impressed!

I loved this, as did my adoring husband. Quick and easy for a weeknight, definitely good enough for guests. Followed the recipe as written. Served with mashed potatoes, plain-no need to gussy 'em up with a sauce this delicious-and steamed asparagus. Very, very good.

We don't use our grill in the winter very much, so this recipe worked great for us. I used 2 strip steaks and the sauce was great.

Excellent!! This dish was a perfect Friday night treat. Served with small baked potato and steamed brocolli, but next time I might try the hashbrowns suggested to soak up the extra sauce. Husband raved about it too. We'll definitely have this again.

This was delicious!! Made it with veal and it tasted like a resturaunt dish. Served it with parmesan roasted potatoes and green beans with lemon and hazelnut (both from this site). Try it!

The sauce was delicious, elegant, and very easy. I multiplied the ingredients by 5 (had 10 people for dinner), skipped the sirloin, and prepared a beef tenderloin instead. Rave reviews from my dinner guests.

This was so easy to make and full of flavor. It is a great example of how easy to make food can be elegant and complicated! I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a romantic dinner main course without the mess and lengthy preparation.

Very easy to make and very tasty. Next time I would double the merlot to make more sauce. I also added 1/2 a tablespoon of minced garlic as suggested previously. Easy enough to make for a weekday meal. I served it with "Vegetables Glazed with Balsamic Vinegar." Yummy!

I really didn't think that the sauce was anything special. I would have liked a slightly thicker sauce. I would use a tenderloin steak also rather than a sirloin. The sauce was delicate enough that it needed a more tender steak.

Excellent recipe. I added 2 Tablespoons of Garlic along with the Shallots and added about 2 more Tablespoons of Merlot. I will definitely make this again!!!!!!!!

Good and simple. Next time I'd double the amount of sauce.

Elegant and easy, the Merlot makes a rich beautiful sauce and the shallots give it good depth without overpowering it. I'd hold back on the butter a bit, 3 T was a bit much for me.

This is a great quick recipe! The butter at the end really makes this a nice sauce. I didn't have shallots at the time so I used red onion which tasted quite nice. Don't over cook the steak!

I really disliked this sauce. It was too strange for my taste. I usually love red wine sauces but this one went straight into the garbage. I was too ashamed to even serve it with the meat. There are much better recipies on this site for steak sauces.

This dish was SO easy to make. I agree that it makes any cook look like a pro. Cast iron skillet is definately the way to go on this one. I also added garlic to the pan when I added the shallots. However, I don't recommend this dish with anything other than a sirloin or filet steaks.

This is an excellent dish. The sauce has such a unique taste that makes it very memorable. Lots of luck if you're expecting leftovers! I do find, however, that the sauce takes longer than suggested to thicken. I 'cheat' with a little corn starch to help it along.

Yummy and easy sauce that can make a beginner look like an expert. I made it with a large New York strip steak cut into two "filet"-like pieces crusted with cracked black peppercorns - it was delicious with sauteed shitake mushrooms.

This was absolutely delicious and very easy!! I made it with filet and it was mouthwatering. Definitely use unsalted butter or the sauce will be too salty. I can't wait to make this again for my next dinner party.

Fabulous! This was so ridiculously easy to make that I was astounded by how great it tasted. Made it last night for a special dinner for two and we were both amazed. I didn't have Merlot so I used some red wine, served it with some potatoes and asparagus and had a wonderful night.

This was so simple to make and very tasty and economical. Sirloin is not my favorite type of steak, but it made a family size steak into a delicious meal. My kids even loved it. This is a keeper in the recipe file.

I love this recipe! I'm not a BBq Grill person, I just never seem to be able to do it well...BUT in this recipe I use 1 TAB. BUTTER and a touch of olive oil, let the butter brown before adding the steak, INSTEAD OF vegetable oil. If you like this recipe with steak, try if with BEEF LIVER! ...Sear on both sides over high heat...remove pan to a back burner...cover... while you make the sauce in a separate pan.

I nearly panicked when I lost the one I printed. It has become our "special" dish for celebrations. It's just as good with other steak cuts, such as well-trimmed rib roast. Be sure to use restaurant quality (aged) beef for best results. A real guilt-maker!!!

Delicious and elegantly simple. Will definitely make again. I made New York strip steaks because that's what looked good at the store. Cooked just a couple of minutes per side, then covered the steaks and placed them in a warm oven while I finished the sauce.

I have made this twice now and my husband loves it! It's very easy to make. I followed Mr. Walter's suggestions and it worked perfectly. Great with onion rings! The only thing I did differently was use Pinot Noir instead of Merlot. Not being a wine expert, I didn't know how it would turn out. It was wonderful! It will be a regular meal in my home.

This is interesting! Follow the recipe precisely and it is delightful. CAUTION: If salt concerns you and you use canned beef broth, omit all other salt. Green beans and oven roasted potatoes complete this dish. What a great recipe . . .

We loved this dish!! I agree with the other reviewer. I too cooked the steak for only 2 minutes on a side then put it in a 200 degree oven while I made the sauce (we like it rare). I also added a little extra of the ingredients to make sure we had plenty of sauce. Add a recipe for onion rings, rosemary potatoes and asparagus spears...what a meal!!

Rating: 3
Very good recipe. Bascially, I doubled it and made what I like to call "Real World" modifications to the recipe. Use a one whole shallot and to prevent the steak from getting cold while I was making the sauce. I instead seared the steak for about two minutes on each side and put it in a 350 degree oven and immeadiatly turned it down to 250 while I made the sauce. Steaks came out perfect med-rare. You could easily do a lower temp if you like it less done or visa-versa.
