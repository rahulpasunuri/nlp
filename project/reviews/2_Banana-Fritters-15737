This is a very easy and delicious recipe. Maybe The word macerate is scaring some people off. It means to soften by soaking. The bananas do soften slightly but I think simply the word soak would work better instead. These bananas are not intended to be a dessert so if that's what your looking for try something else. I had something similar in a brazilian restaurant. They were served along with the main meal and seemed to serve the same purpose as potatoes. I was glad to find that I could make them at home. These bananas were the perfect compliment to the spicy meal I was serving. I salted the bananas lightly after I pulled them out of the oil and it added depth of flavor to the dish. Don't be scared by the other reviews if you like warm bananas and would like to enjoy them in something other than dessert form. Also the rum was a nice touch but I don't believe it is key. You could probably leave it out without hurting the dish.

This sin't actually a review but a note: In the recipe it says to 'Macerate' the banana's at room temperature for 30 minutes. I believe if I mecerated the bananas for 30 minutes, I would have a pulpy mess that would in no way be able to be fried in oil. I think it should read 'marinate'. Maybe more people would try this recipe if it made sense. I know I would.

My family and I weren't very pleased with this recipe. I love bananas and it sounded wonderful, soaked in rum and deep fried. The bananas turn mushy inside after frying them and they were rather bland.

These were easy to make but did not find the taste to my liking. They were not as good as other fritters I've made, apple, corn etc. After rolling them in powered sugar they were much better.
