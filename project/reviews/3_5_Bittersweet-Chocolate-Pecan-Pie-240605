I'm going to agree with a lot of other folks here, I didn't find this pie anything special...the change I made was to sub agave nectar for the corn syrup as our family just doesn't eat corn syrup. The pie wasn't sweet enough for pecan pie, I think, and the filling wasn't gooey enough for my taste, and altogether, it had a dry texture that didn't "gel" together. My aunt makes a fantastic chocolate pecan pie, I was hoping for a similar result and got nothing close.

I madc this pie Thanksgiving morning according to directions - it was way over done. Luckily I had enough to make two, so I made it again, but cooked at 350 degrees for 45 minutes - it came out perfect.

As you might have noticed the filling is missing butter ingredient. Could this be the reason for the blandness of the pie? Chocolate layer will improve anything, I would imagine, but would it replace 3/4 sticks of butter most of other recipes call for?

I was very disappointed in the flavor of this pie. Looked beautiful, but no taste to speak of. Sweet, but no real flavor. Wondering why recipe calls for light brown sugar - may try again w/ dark brown sugar.

Delish. Mine cooked in about 40 minutes, and the crust browned after 20 -- so keep an eye on it!

There was nothing wrong with this, but nothing really great about it either. I might just stick with regular pecan pie, as this did not add anything good to it.

Made this last year for two Thanksgiving dinners, and it was such a hit at both that I've had two dozen people begging me all year to make it again! Toasting the pecans really does affect the flavor (for the better) so I'd recommend not skipping out on that step! It's rich, but not overly sweet and the thin layer of chocolate gave the crust a nice tang. I also think the accompanying pastry dough recipe is one of the best I've used, and I use it for all my pies now.

It was fine..nothing exceptional. I think that pecan pie is just better in its pure form and the chocolate didnt really do anything for the pie. I had a lot of people love it and comment about it, but I thought it was too over the top. Ill stick with a regular pecan next year.

I made this for the holidays and it was a huge hit! So good with the dark chocolate layer. yum

I was disappointed by this - I felt that the flavor of the chocolate overwhelmed the subtler flavor of the pecan filling. For the record, I did use light corn syrup and a family pie crust recipe. I recommend trying the Maple Pecan Pie. This was hugely unspectacular.

This Thanksgivng, I tried this in comparison to my usual chocolate bourbon pecan pie, and it just didn't measure up. I think it's an improvement over standard pecan pie (I mean who can complain about chocolate?), but next year I'll go back to my old stand by, which is easier, too. If anyone would like to compare, please check out my public recipe box.

We all loved this pie! I used refrigerator pie crust and maple syrup instead of the corn syrup and it was absolutely delicious!

I didn't make the crust, but the filling got excellent reviews at Christmas. My father told everyone the pie fell on the way in so he could have it all the himself

This is the BEST pecan pie I've ever tasted. I used light corn syrup, not the dark. The bittersweet chocolate was perfect. This pie is not as sweet and candy- like as a tradional pecan pie. The crust is also perfect, very buttery.

Absolutely a Hit! Everyone who likes pecan pie LOVED this pie and much preferred it to the traditional. The bittersweet layer is quite decadent, but I've got plenty of chocolate lovers in my household. Will make this again next year!

I really loved the flavor of this pie, but I had a problem with the texture. I made 3 small (4-inch) pies that I baked for 30 minutes. The centers were firm and the crust was golden when I took them out of the oven. I put them in the frig overnight and when I reheated them the filling became runny. I let them cool down, and the filling became less runny, but still not right. I sure wish I knew how to fix the texture because the taste was really wonderful.

Made this for Thanksgiving as well as Mom's traditional pecan pie recipe, so was able to compare side by side. The traditional corn syrup/brown sugar recipe won in both taste and texture, which shocked me because I love dark chocolate so much. I used new crop, toasted pecans from my yard for both pies. I might try to layer the chocolate under the traditional recipe next time...

This pie was just okay. The chocolate became a very hard layer at the bottom and would have been better had it mixed in with the filling which was delicious and not too sweet. I will keep looking for a better recipe.

This pecan pie was fantastic. Not too sweet or syrupy. I used light corn syrup and was perfect. A big hit at Thanksgiving!

This was okay, but not great. I had a chocolate pecan pie a few weeks ago that was fabulous, and was hoping to recreate it, but this recipe didn't do it. Oddly enough for a pecan pie recipe, it just wasn't sweet enough.

Pan-toasted the pecans first. Chewy, more like candy, really needs the whipped cream and then it's really good.

I used my own pie crust recipie and light corn syrup. I will make this again.

i made this for thanksgiving and i consider myself an excellent baker....the filling was delicious, not too sweet and the pecans were fabulous.....however, the chocolate was a big disappointment as was the pastry crust, and if i ever made it again, i would use martha stewarts recipe for the crust and chop the chocolate to mix in with the pecans

I thought this pie was just okay the day it was baked but a TON better the next morning. I think that's because it gave the gooey filling time to set and the chocolate was exquisite at that point. I will definitely make this again but will be sure to make it the day before I intend to serve it.

This was great. I used my own pastry recipe but the chocolate was a wonderful complement to the pecans and I loved that it wasnt to sweet. I didnt have corn syrup so I used maple syrup

This is a wonderful recipe. Toasting the pecans makes such a difference. I did not melt the chocolate, just chopped it finally and sprinkled it on the bottom of the crust followed by the pecans. The crust recipe is also wonderful

This was very disappointing. I make pecan pies every year for Thanksgiving, and was looking to add a new element. Chocolate is not the way to go. It overwhelmed the nuts. I also think that the frozen butter pastry recipe is more delicate and interesting than the standard pie crust.

This is a fantastic recipe! Again- exactly as described. I added a dash of whiskey to the egg/sugar mixture- delicious.
