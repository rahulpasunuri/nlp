My entire family thought this was awesome. I followed this pretty well, but substituted tamarind concentrate - buy it at importfood.com. If using concentrate, put 2 T into measuring cup, then fill to make 1/2 C. liquid. I would suggest making 1/3 more or double the sauce too. The basil in the sauce and also topped at the end was terrific. Also, we loved that the chilis (I only had jalapenos) were added at the end. That way, the overall dish did not get too spicy but the little bit of heat was still present. Also, it was a beautiful spring day and we could not resist firing up the barbeque for the fish, instead of broiling it. And lastly, I had fresh green garlic on hand, so used plenty of that instead of the cloves. We served it next to asparagus pad thai and loved the meal.

I thought this dish was delicious! I think I simmered the sauce a bit too long, so it wasn't saucy, like the picture shows, but it was an exquisite blend of flavors. My other half thought it was great as well. I used Trout instead of snapper. I doubled the sauce because I didn't think it would be enough for the two filets I got. Served with rice, perfect!

I'm all for healthy recipes, but I'm with the reviewers that didn't care for this. Fortunately I served it on the side so that some very nice fish was only compromised for a few bites. But then, we like fish and only want to accent it, not drown out its flavor.

I am only commenting on the tamarind sauce. It was definitely a strange mix of flavors, and I love fish sauce and tamarind, I'm just not sure I would ever put them together ever again. The end result was not gross, just disappointing. Will not make again.

I have to agree with Philadelphia here. I love tamarind, but we threw most of this out. I don't know that I've ever given a one-fork rating before. Perhaps I made a mistake, but it is not likely. If you chose to make this, at least omit the additional salt. After 1 tablespoon of fish sauce, you don't really need it! Way too salty.

Delicious, easy to prepare and healthy. I agree with the other reviewers about the sauce quantity. I used only one 6 oz fillet and had just the right amount of sauce. Also I used tamarind concentrate that I bought from an Indian grocer. Because it has a syrup-like consistency the mixing process with water seemed easier than following the recipe. I recommend tasting the mixture too, to make sure you have the desired amount of tanginess. Overall a great dish on the first try!

This was excellent. Tried it with grouper, and next time will poach or bake instead of broil. Use plenty of Thai basil. If you like Thai flavors but not all the oil and coconut milk in many Thai recipes, this one is a great way to go.

I really enjoy cooking and eating Thai food but this was vile.

All of the delicious flavor was in everything on top of the fish. The fish itself was quite tasteless, though that makes sense given that it was simply broiled. It would be nice to do something to bring flavor into the fish itself. BTW, I think the recipe should be clearer about the amount of scallion -- all you need are two green strips, not two entire scallion stalks.

This was an excellent fish recipe. I prepared it for a buffet dinner. It was light, tasty, and so easy to prepare.. all my guests complimented me. I am definitely going to do it again.

I would have doubled the sauce, it seemed I didn't have enough to get a true taste.

This was relatively east to make. But squeezing the tamarind through a sieve was a little messy and time consuming. It is not easy to find coriander root but worth the effort. I doubled the recipe, but I would cut down a little on the fish sauce, it was al little too pungent for western palates.
