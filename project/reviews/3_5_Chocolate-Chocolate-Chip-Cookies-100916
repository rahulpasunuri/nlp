This recipe did not work for me. I followed the recipe exactly and my cookies ended up dry, bland and not sweet enough - and I don't usually like very sweet foods. Although others recommended a shorter cooking time, I can only rate a recipe as it is written. I would not recommend this recipe nor would I make them again.

Good recipe, however I would have to agree that they more of a brownie than a cookie. I used semisweet instead of bittersweet chocolate, but I'm not a big dark chocolate fan. They turned out rich and sweet. "Cookies" great paired with ice cream.

These cookies were amazing! These were the first chocolate cookies I've made, and the recipe was pretty easy. I saved the remaining uneaten cookies in a ziplock in the freezer. I just grab one whenever I've got a sweet tooth. They kept perfect for approx the 3 weeks or so it took me to finish them. I did not have cocoa powder, so I just used extra chocolate chips. I will be making these often!

I loved these cookies! I made them because I thought my Dad would love them and he thought they were just pure heaven! I would say to follow this exactly, but put them on for 9 or 8 minutes, or else they get to bland and dry. Also don't make them with semisweet chocolate, horrible. I ran out of bittersweet and tried to improvise, didn't work as I hoped it would. they are best heated up and warm, it not, they get to dry. a suggestion is to make them with 72% bittersweet chocolate, and they taste better. i do agree though with the others. they tasted a bit to much like cakes then cookies.

I was pretty disappointed by the quality of the cookies. I followed the recipe to the letter and ended up with very dry, cake-like cookies that weren't very sweet.

the key is to bake these puppies for 8 minutes instead of 10. at 8 mins, they're exceptionally chocolatey and rich like brownies. at 10, they're a little dry and incredibly mediocre.

I loved these cookies because they were so easy (because the butter was melted and not creamed into the sugar. However, my cookies turned out as flat as pancakes (I think because the butter was melted first). I'd make them again but not for company I was trying to impress!!!

I have to agree with the other reviewers who didn't find these quite sweet enough, and I love dark chocolate and also don't usually like super-sugary cookies. But the ratio wasn't quite there for me on these. I thought the salt amount called for was appropriate - they just need more sweetness. They were very cakey, even more than I anticipated from reading reviews - enough so that you can't really put them in the cookie jar. Also, I disagree with the instructions to "stir in flour until just combined" - I associate that with muffin instructions where you want to be careful not to overmix. What happened with my cookies is there were pockets of unmixed flour. So, you need to mix more than you would for muffins, which is just past "just combined" to me. Lastly, I ended up making a powdered sugar frosting with half-and-half to drizzle over the tops - they were good that way, but just not what I'd pictured serving. I probably would make another recipe before attempting these again. Last complaint: the photo of the cookies appears to either have been made with milk chocolate, or was color enhanced!

excellent. Add cranberries. I used fresh cranberries, brought them to a boil and then immersed in cold water. In the final product they all formed nice little tart pockets and some were still intact so they popped in the mouth.

This has become my family's very favorite chocolate chip cookie.

Rating: 4
I have been making this recipe for over 7 years and they are consistently a favorite. I bake A LOT and these are one of my husband's favorites. He does refer to them as "those little brownie cookies." So yes, they are reminiscent of brownies. For this recipe, I have only used semi-sweet chocolate chips for those who say it's not sweet enough.

Rating: 1
I know I'm in the minority here, but I just don't understand what people find so good about these cookies. Maybe it's the chocolate I used (Valrhona Bittersweet), but I've used it for many other baked goods and it's been excellent. These cookies taste dry and just are not sweet enough. Any suggestions? I followed the recipe verbatim.

Rating: 3
This is a great recipe. Although I do agree that they are in some ways more like brownies in cookie form.

I substituted Dutch onyx cocoa powder and instead of using 4 oz of the chocolate, used Andes pieces and added 1/8 tsp of peppermint extract. I would have given 3.5 forks if possible. Even at altitude they came out wonderfully. Certainly a keeper and a good excuse to dust off the double boiler.

I just made these cookies and they are perfect and simple to make. As a full time working mom, I am all about ease and simplicty, and a short list of ingredients. I didn't have dutch process cocoa, so I used Unsweetened cocoa, used all the salt, used Bakers bittersweet chocolate (lying around the house), and I accidentally thought I was supposed to add a cup of sugar instead of a half cup, so it was just shy of a cup of sugar. Oh, and a splash of vanilla. I baked two batches of cookies for 9 minutes, my husband thought they were two chewy, so I baked the last batch at ten minutes. I preferred baking them at 9 minutes. Get a plate, they make crumbs. I could have a eaten quite a few cookies, but I was satisfied with a couple. Excellent, I will definately make these again!

If you want an indulgent chocolate cookie- this is it. I prepared according to the recipe and made them a second time with no adjustment. They are very rich- and not too sweet but my 10 year old loved them as much as the foodies in my office. Great with a good vanilla ice cream.

Rating: 2
I was a little reluctant to make these because the reviews made them seem like they needed doctoring in order to work out. But I liked them a lot. They are super chocolatey and not very sweet. I got 25 cookies from this recipe, so they turned out kind of fudgey in the middle (not cakey), which was a nice surprise. I'd definitely make again.

Rating: 3
The cookies were rather tasty, but as others have mentioned, the texture is a little cakey. I added a teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of instant expresso powder to enhance the flavor. I also baked for just nine minutes and reduced the amount of salt to 1/2 teaspoon. I used some good chocolate that I just had lying around. The cookies turned out pretty well.

Rating: 4
These are always a hit whenever I serve them. I occasionally add seasonal spices: cinnamon, ground ginger, clove, allspice and even a bit of cardamom; and I always add vanilla, too. I scoop the dough and keep in the freezer. Be sure to take them out BEFORE you think they're done; they are best when they are still moist. BTW: salt enhances the flavor of most baked goods...especially chocolate items. Don't scimp

Rating: 3
I'd only make these again if specifically asked, my bf loved the double chocolate taste. Way too dry and cakey for me but with a glass of milk I managed to eat a few myself! Anyone have a suggestion to make the dough less cake like and more cookie-esk?

A delicious recipe, very, very moist and fudgy, just the way I like my chocolate cookies! I made this years ago and was happy to find the recipe again here. I overbaked the first batch a bit, they turn quickly so watch them carefully. Everyone at the office loved them! A great Valentine's Day treat.

These tasted great, but were a little too cakey for me. I guess I may have overcooked them a little because they were a little dry.

After reading everyone's reviews I made my own subs/additions--by all accounts, these were much less subtle and very, very popular. I would definitely make again. 1/4 instead of 3/4 salt 9.7oz (entire bar) of Scharfen Berger Semi-Sweet Chocolate (entire amount should be melted) 1 cup instead of 1/2 sugar 1 tsp vanilla I mixed in 1/2 cup pecans for texture and 1/2 cup of milk chocolate chips for balance

Loved these cookies! I cut the salt in half (make sure you use unstalted butter too) and underbaked slightly. The texture was great, and not at all dry. These aren't overly sweet, so some people might not love them at first, but they really become addicting. By the way, they were the first to go on a cookie platter I put out for a party!

These cookies weren't bad, but not great either. They turned out very cake-like and didn't spread AT ALL on the sheet while they baked. The other comments about them being dry is somewhat true - have your vanilla ice cream ready.

I followed the recipe exactly (except I lowered the salt to 1/4 tsp) and I baked them just 10 minutes but I found them to be a little dry so next time, I will shave off a minute. It's a cookie for the chocoholic in your group.

Rating: 3
Very good, sinfully so. I did add a bit of vanilla, and next time would cut the salt down to 1/2 tsp -- and yes, my butter was unsalted and I used good chocolate but I could taste a hint of saltiness in the final cookie. The second batch I took out of the oven a little earlier, about 9 minutes, and I liked the texture better (a little chewier). I used scharffen berger bittersweet in the batter and then good semi-sweet chunks on top. One tip on chopping chocolate -- I put the bar in a ziploc bag and then smash with a mallet. Much less mess. These are nice treats to have around because you're not going to pig out on them -- one is enough, ok, MAYBE two.

I'm not the chocolate fan I made these for, I made them as a father's day gift. That is, if they ever make it that far! Wow. These are phenomenal. Fresh out of the oven, they did nothing for me.

And I'm going to get another one out of the fridge, YUM!

These cookies taste as good as they look. My sister wasn't too crazy about the cakelike texture but I really like the texture and density of this cookie. I've used the amount of salt stated in the recipe the past two times I have made these and agree that it may be a bit too much. In the future i will prob. reduce it to half or three-quarters. This cookie is defintely for chocolate lovers. I also love they fact they are not too sweet, I find them to have a more adult appeal.

Rating: 2
Tastes good, retains its shape nicely upon baking, and looks attractive studded with irregular chocolate shards. Made 51 smaller cookies, which seemed a more appropriate size. Yes, this recipe produces a fluffier, more cake/souffle-like cookie. Don't overbake. Based on others' recommendations, I reduced the salt and thought that was just fine. I also found the cocoa powder quite strong and would have liked slightly more sugar in the cookie dough to balance it out. For the cookies that were topped with white chocolate chips, some of those chips started browning (as Memphis TN experienced).

I'm a Private Chef and this cookie is an integral part of my dessert menu. I don't even need the recipe to make them anymore. If you are finding them too salty - check the quality of your butter, chocolate and cocoa. If you are finding them too dry - you are overcooking them. They should be very moist almost souffle/mousse texture. I have a client who calls them "Chocolate Volcanos of Love". Pair them, warm from the oven, with Vanilla Ice Cream and finely chopped Pistachios...YIKES!

My kids didn't care for these, but my husband and I couldn't stop eating them. I could only find Baker's chocolate in the first store I went to, and when that came to $7, I thought that was spending enough! These were so good that I can't imagine how much better they'd be with better chocolate. They were a tad dry and crumbly, but a great break from sweet or fussy cookies. I found that mine did age well in a cookie jar (for 3 days, anyway). I could have gotten by with 2 fewer ounces chopped for the top, too.

GREAT COOKIES!!! We eat all of them in a week!!! Although next time I would use 2/4 teaspoon salt. Try also a bit of orange essence or candied orange peels instead of chocolate chips.

Rating: 3
I love these cookies, especially with white chocolate chips and chopped macademia nuts stirred in, instead of the additional dark chocolate shards. That said, however, I have to say that I also found them too salty: yes, I used the appropriate kinds of chocolate, cocoa powder, and butter, of course, but next time (and there will indeed be a next time) I will reduce the salt to a mere 1/4 teaspoon (as in most cookie recipes). I also have to say that these cookies are a little cakier than some chocolate cookies, just so you know.

These are scrumptous brownie-like cookies that are easy to make. One-bowl recipe using the microwave to melt chocolate and butter. I used Nestle's chocolate chunks in an 11.5 ounce bag instead of 3/4 pound of chopped chocolate. It worked beautifully. Then I added 3 more chunks to the top of each cookie. Clearly the best chocolate cookie I have ever eaten.

Rating: 3
I'll have to agree with the New England cook. This is an exceptional recipe. If you mistakingly use salted butter, the cookie WILL be unbearably salty. As written, these are not terribly sweet, but that's one reason we like them so much. I hate a cloying cookie; I definitely prefer a more subtle, chocolatey flavor. I don't bother to chop all that chocolate for the batter-- I just brake it into large chunks and throw in the double boiler. Also, do not chop the remaining pieces too fine-- it's nicer when the pieces that stud the cookies are a little too large. They do not keep well, so eat them all up soon after they're made.

Rating: 4
This recipe has such universal appeal with every type of person I know that I can only conclude that the reviewer from L.A. made some sort of error in measuring when baking these. I have been making these cookies for two years now, following the recipe just as it appears and the results have always been phenomenally well received. I make them from October to April and all of my family and friends clamor for more all summer. -- It is so good for the ego!!! They are so incredibly easy. Melt the chocolate and butter in the microwave and add the remaining ingredients to the same bowl and chill. Simple. Fast. Unbelievably good. Who could ask for more???

These are just like a bar of excellent bittersweet chocolate, in convenient cookie form. Therefore, it pays to use excellent bittersweet chocolate. They don't taste as good after two days, so be sure to eat them all right away. And DO NOT eat these without something to wash them down. They're particularly appealing when studded with irregular shards of fine chocholate. Practically illegal!

These cookies were amazing! Next time, will also add some walnuts or pecans, and just a bit of vanilla. The taste is really not too sweet, but intensely chocolatey nonetheless. I am a true chocoholic, and yet could not eat more than one cookie at a time, due to their richness. Their texture tends to soft, almost brownie like. Received rave reviews from everyone else who tasted them, too. Oh, and as other reviewers pointed out, get the very best quality chocolate you can, it makes all the difference.

At first, this cookie seemed very cakey, like a brownie, with a fairly intense chocolate taste. It was a bit dry, or missing something? Like vanilla! A must in all cookie recipes... that should have been an omen. However, after a day or so they got hard and crumbly, and developed this atrocious taste! Like another review said, there are FAR SUPERIOR cookie recipes out there, and I'm not a novice baker. What a waste of time and precious chocolate!

Rating: 4
Mmmmm! These wonderful cookies absolutely melt in your mouth. They're soft and decadent-- and they disappear whenever I make them. Easy to do, too. The most tedious job is chopping the chocolate. However, everytime I bake these I detect a faint salty taste, though I always use unsalted butter. Anyone else think so? Regardless, these are super! A keeper.

This is the recipe I turn to when I want to make a chocolate chip cookie. They are soooo good, and moist-- they remind me a bit of a delicate brownie. I am generally not fond of cookies, but these really are spectacular.

Perfect for a dunk in milk!

These were easy to make. I didn't bother to chop all the chocolate. The amount to be melted just got thrown in to the bowl with the butter and melted. The chopped chocolate was folded into the batter before chilling. These will be part of our Easter dinner--and will definitely make them again.

Fabulous intensely chocolate cookie with cake-like consistency. The dough spreads just the right amount when baking and the cookie does not have hard-cooked edges. It freezes well and if microwaved just enough, the warm cookies with gooey chocolate chunks taste like they are just out of the oven.
