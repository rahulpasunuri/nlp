I have made this now 3 times (only once as written) and honestly the salad is best composed of 4 ingredients: watermelon, ginger, lime and watercress. I finely dice candied ginger, add to the cubed melon, toss in the watercress, squeeze a lime, and garnish with a bit of mint-- sublime! Forget the onions, oil and vinegar they are unnecessary and detract from the fresh flavors.

I felt the flavor of the sauce was outpowered by the watermelon. I also didn't like how the lettuce looked mixed in; I would have preferred putting the watermelon on a bed of lettuce. That said, it was nice to have watermelon on salad on a hot summer night.

Great flavors for a Summer meal! Everything mixed together very nicely. Forgot to buy a lime for the peel, so used lime juice instead. No problem. Will definitely make this again.

I thought this salad surprisingly good. The tartness of the dressing was just right with the watermelon and watercress. The ginger was not overwhelming (just enough to make it different). I tried two watermelon salad recipes this week (the other was with feta, tomatoes, and arugula). This was one was definitely the better of the two.

I didn't have green onions so I omitted them and added frisee-I liked the flavors of this but the frisee on top of watercress was a little difficult to actually physically eat. The flavors overall to this are complex and yet subtle--delicious and very nutritious. I will definitely be sure to have green onions next time, I think they would compliment well. However, this is NOT quick & easy! I will make it again, but with extra hands on duty.

Added the juice from the limes to the dressing and pureed it in the blender. Yummy!

Love this salad! I pretty much followed the recipe except I used shallots instead of green onions and ommitted the garlic. I also added some fresh arugula and mango. Also, I substituted fresh mint for the cilantro. Absolutely wonderful!!

the ingredients looked very interesting and I love ginger and juicy peppery watercress, but garlic killed all the lightness and freshness of the salad for me.

Made double batch for group of 8 women. Everyone liked it, including one who claimed to not like watermelon.. Used baby arugula instead of 'cress, otherwise followed recipe exactly. Very yummy and unusual; requests for recipe.

This is the perfect addition to a summer BBQ or to have as a light lunch! I didn't have all of the ingredients so a substituted some things......I used Italian parsley instead of cilantro (I love cilantro, but did not miss it in this dish.) I used arugula instead of watercress and shallots in lieu of green onions. I added toasted slivered almonds for crunch and feta cheese. The ginger really makes this recipe. What a crowd pleaser.

Excellent. Have made this several times for guests, and every time it gets raves and requests for the recipe. Unusual for me, but I didn't mess with the ingredients at all. Perfect and yummy as is.

Followed recipe exactly, as I had all the ingredients, and wanted to see the results. Both my husband and I loved it. Will definitely repeat this throughout the summer. The ingredients/flavors complemented each other beautifully. Sometimes it pays to try unexpected combinations!

I discovered this recipe last summer. It's great. I think the watercress and the watermelon play off each other beautifully. It's very popular in my house.

First bite was startling, but by the third bite I was hooked. Good summer salad. Zingy, yet sweet as well. My fellow diners loved it.

Unbelievable! Everyone raved. The recipe serves 6 small portions as a luncheon side dish. Passed this one on to friends.

Good, but not great. I love all of the individual ingredients, but together I found the taste overly complex. Sometimes simpler is better. I would try it without the ginger and watercress.

An excellent recipe for the salad course, especially when that course is toward the end of the meal. It was refreshing, and a good lead in to the Mango Mint Fool for dessert. Next time I'll add pine nuts. Wish I had thought of that for last night!
