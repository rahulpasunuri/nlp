Lifelong northern VA resident here. No Bay seasoning and ingredients that shouldn't be there: sour cream, breadcrumbs, even the idea of canned crab meat shows this recipe should be stripped of the "Maryland" tag.

I haven't tried these but being a lifelong Maryland resident, I know I wouldn't like them. Easy crab recipe that actually makes the crab stand out which is the point: crab meat (not canned) Old Bay Seasoning, saltine cracker crumbs (toasted in butter just for an extra kick) and just enough mayo to bind it all together. Broil for 5-10 minutes.

True Marylanders always put Old Bay in their crabcakes, no bread crumbs and no excess filler like peppers or onions so that the flavor of the crab is brought out solely by the Old Bay (saltines work well in place of breadcrumbs to bond the crab without tasting bread throughout--also, don't use panko). We make them about softball size and broil. This recipe sounds like a nice concoction--but it's not a true Maryland crabcake.... Try this: (ingredients are approximate estimates) 1 lb crab meat(jumbo lump is best) Old Bay to taste 1 egg beaten 1T brown mustard 3/4 cup crushed saltines parsley (maybe 1-2 TBSP) 1T worcestershire 1T mayo Lightly mix crab crackers old bay and parsley In a separate bowl mix wet ingred. Gently combine wet and dry ingred. Form into balls (at least baseball size) Broil until golden brown and it holds together. Broil in oven for

Wow. This was my first time making and even eating crab cakes, and I was pleasantly surprised! Very tasty. Obviously I don't have anything to compare to, but I can understand the bland criticisms as there weren't any strong in-your-face flavors. But I did detect some nice subtleties that I very much enjoyed. I did make a couple changes per others' comments: I used mayo instead of sour cream, Old Bay instead of paprika, and about 3/4 the bread crumbs. Turned out very well. Held together perfectly without being too bready. Would make again when looking to splurge! Picked crab meat ain't cheap!

Way too much bread crumbs- they were also very bland. Wish I had read the reviews before choosing this recipe! Definitely going with a completely different recipe next time- don't even feel like trying to salvage this one.

Do as we do in Maryland. Use mayonnaise, not sour cream. This is too much bread crumbs. You only want the mixture to barely hold together. Too much crumbs make a pasty cake. You can skip the cornmeal, too.

As a lifelong Maryland resident and a classically trained chef at BICC, I am disappointed that anyone would title a crabcake as "Maryland" that does not contain OLD BAY seasoning. For a simple but true Maryland style crabcake use fresh bread crumbs from 4 slices of bread, 2 tsp mayo, 4 tsp+ Old Bay, 4 tsp parsley, 1 tsp prepared yellow mustard, 2 eggs and 2 pounds of lump Blue crab meat. Follow the directions as written, just change the ingredients and you will have a true MD crab cake.

I made these tonight & was really disappointed. Even though I added some chopped celery, green onions & a clove of garlic, along with everything else, they were totally bland. Even my tartar sauce didn't help. This is way too expensive ($32 for the crab) to try, again.

I made these with the Roasted Potatoes with Garlic, Lemon and Garlic (on Epi from rom The Foods of the Greek Islands: Cooking and Culture at the Crossroads of the Mediterranean). I received rave reviews on both dishes! The flavor of the crab cakes was outstanding and they were perfectly moist. I think these were some of the best crab cakes I've ever had. I did make two changes. First, I used skim milk Balkan style yogurt instead of sour cream. Second, I baked them at at 350° for 25 minutes. If you're looking for a great condiment to go with the cakes try tzatziki!

Crab cakes are a catch-all, pantry supper in my house, since we almost always have a can of Costco lump crab meat in the fridge. I'm always trying new recipes according to what we have on hand at the time. So it happened that I made this recipe using mayo for the sour cream (which sounds too rich for me anyway), skipped the Worcestershire and added Mexican hot sauce instead, added minced celery and onion that had sweated in the pan I used to melt the butter (salted, so you have to allow for that), and added some wonderful smoky paprika picante from Spain. I served the cakes with Wildwood vegetarian aioli, which is far better than it sounds, and drank a good champagne (Veuve, which is also a pantry item here, because life is short), and it was just lovely. Good texture, high crab content, and just the right level of acid and spice. I was concerned about the high amount of bread crumbs, but you aren't aware of them when these are cooked. And the corn meal makes a delicate crust. Just wonderful, with a few adjustments!

Great crab cakes. I must say, getting all of the crab meet out of the shells was rather time consuming. I should have bought the pre-shelled crab meet. But, once I was done with the de-shelling, the rest was easy, and tasted great. They were better the next day, after all of the flavors had time to marry and sink in.

A wonderful recipe that allows you to add your own twist. As others suggested, I added celery and used old bay instead of paprika and mayo instead of sour cream. I also added shallots, garlic and a bit of pepper sauce. Everyone loved the recipe. I will definitely make this again.

Have tried this a couple of times and found that the lump meat available locally resulted in a cake that disintegrates upon frying. Using the more fibrous backfin meant the cake held up much better. Have served it with peas, saffron rice, and beans and rice using a straightforward remoulade as the sauce led to a delicious meal. Will be made for thanksgiving for family members allergic to poultry.

I forgot to add that I served homemade cole slaw (a recipe on epicurious) and homemade french fries (also on epicurious -- Classic American French Fries) and it was a wonderful "Clam Shacky" meal.

On a recent trip to the Outer Banks, North Carolina, I decided to try homemade crabcakes. This was a delicious recipe. I did follow advice and substitute mayo for the sour cream and Old Bay Seasoning instead of Paprika. I also used regular pepper instead of cayenne and Progresso Italian Breadcrumbs in lieu of homemade. They turned out delicious and we ate them for 2 days!!!

I served this recipe to several Marylanders (who know a thing or two about crabcakes) and they all loved it! The only thing I changed was to use Old Bay instead of paprika.

Delicious, moist crab cakes with a bit of corn meal crunch on the crust... I used canned crab, 2 cans, and homemade bread crumbs. I like the sweetness of the cornmeal with the delicate flavor of crab. I made an aioli of roasted red pepper and roasted garlic to go with, and that was just right.

Wonderful recipe. I added a little Dijon mustard (about a teaspoon). A also baked them in the oven in a slightly oiled cast iron skillet at 450 degrees-10 minutes, then turn, then 4-5 minutes on the second side. I used less oil that way, and my stove top stayed cleaner.

Tasty, tasty, tasty. What's best about this recipe though is that the crab cakes didn't disintegrate into a gazillion bits like the other recipies I have tried. I did substitute mayo for the sour cream though (we didn't have any sour cream on hand).

Love, love, love this crab cake recipe. I use slightly less bread crumbs than the recipe calls for and the cakes still hold together nicely and the crab flavor really stands out. I make these in bite sized pieces (one tablespoon per cake) for appetizers all the time and get asked for the recipe constantly.

The bread crumbs don't work for me. My mother always used cracker crumbs, smashed between sheets of wax paper with a rolling pin, and I still prefer them that way. Anyone else?

This was a waste of crab. As a matter of fact- it was a waste of breadcrumbs. Bland bland bland. I even cut the breadcrumbs in half per another cook's suggestion and found that even that was too much filler. I'm glad I tried it on myself and one forgiving and understanding guest before I made a fool of myself and a mockery of my cooking by serving it a dinner party. I certainly don't understand the rave reviews. And I am not a picky eater. If someone has a good crab cake recipe- I would be eternally grateful.

I'm a Baltimore native so I'm a really tough critic when it comes to good crab cakes! I would make these again but with a few changes. I also substituted mayo for the sour cream. I cut the amount of bread crumbs in half and added 1 tsp. yellow mustard, 1 stalk of celery (very finely chopped) and 2 shallots (very finely chopped). I also did not cover the finished crab cakes in bread crumbs once they were formed. In addition, I prefer to broil them in the oven by placing them in a shallow baking pan and dotting them with margarine to bring out a nice golden color when they are cooked.

I left out the butter (is it really necessary??), and thanks to readers' suggestions, replaced the sour cream with mayo. I also added chopped celery and shallets. I used canned crab meat from Trader Joe's, which was a hit. I doubled the salt and fried them in olive oil. Next time, I will leave out the cornmeal. It was just weird. Will make this again~

Very good crab cakes didn't make any changes except for the tartar sauce I made a cilantro-lime tarter sauce that I got from epicuriuos.

Made the mustard sauce from another crab cake recipe to go along w/these cakes. Had the grill going, so just put them on a non-stick grill pan, which worked just fine. If you are not able to get fresh crab, make sure you drain the canned crab real well & have some extra bread crumbs on hand.

This recipe is so good that I now make it every 2 weeks. Even my kids like it (with tartar sauce of course) I followed the advice of the other cooks about using mayo instead of sour cream. I can only get canned crab so I use 3 to 4 cans.

Fan-bloody-tastic. Made this recipe 4 times and it's better than my own. Used canned crab(3-4) cans. Used fresh white bread (cut into small cubes and squished with little milk). Panko works well too. Use 7 tbsp's of mayo instead of sour cream. Make them small and make sure to chill for a while before cooking (2-3 hours at least).

First, let me say that I love crab cakes and was eager to make my own. Tried this recipe for the first time this evening, and have to say that I was disappointed. Followed the measurements, timing and cooking instructions to the letter and felt that the bread crumbs overwhelmed the flavor. If I did try this again, I would either go with half of the bread crumbs or use them just to lightly coat the exterior. Hubby and I give it a "good, but not great" rating.

The crab at the fish market didn't look wonderful so I chose to use canned crab (4 small). This didn't seem to make too much of a difference because everyone thought they tasted better than those they have eaten in fine restaurants. I think I made the cakes a little too large. The next time I'll scoop the crab mixture with a 1/3 cup measure. I love this website!

FABULOUS! I doubled the receipe for the 8 members of our Gourmet Group and served them with Burre Blanc-caper sauce. I substituted mayonaise for the sour cream (more flavor). Everyone LOVED them, and this is a difficult-to-impress bunch. It was perfect for our New Orleans theme.

We used three cans of crab meat. Placed tomato salsa and fresh avacado on the top for garnish. Would add more salt as the flavor was not that intense. We used panko insted of bread crumbs to coat them and they did not fall apart. All of our guests loved them.

This recipe proves that simple is better sometimes. What a waste of good lump crab meat. All of the extra "junk" masked the true flavor of the crab. Too much filler, bread crumbs and corn meal was overkill. Maryland style crab cakes are truely the best any where. Old Bay and crab is a marriage made in heaven.

Living on the coast most of my life, I have sampled many different crab cakes. These were divine! This recipie is fabulous! It is better than most restaurant recipies. I added celery flakes along with the parsley flakes. The celery flakes really enhance the flavor of the crab meat. Fresh crab meat is a must! I have made them several times now and everyone raves and claims they are the best they've ever had! This recipie is definately a keeper!

I've made several crabcake recipies from Epicurious and this was by far the best one. The cornmeal coating keeps the crab inside very moist, and it keeps the crab cakes together while sauteing. I used Japanese Panko breadcrumbs instead of regular breadcrumbs...they are lighter and lend a better texture. I also used Phillip's canned jumbo lump crab meat. I just added dry tarragon to ready-made tartar sauce...everything tasted superb!

This is a great recipe. Easy and full of flavor. I added green onion and green chilis - delicious. Claw crab meat makes them even tastier, but plain old white or lump crabmeat from the grocery store is fine, too.

My husband and I simply love these crab cakes. I use fresh crab meat which takes a little longer, but is worth it! I followed previous suggestions to reduce the size of the cakes and it worked well. We serve these with aioli rather than the tartar sauce. We have also cooked these on the barbeque with some success.

Excellent and easy to prepare. 1/2 cup made a huge crab cake, 1/3 cup would be perfect. Cakes held their shape beautifully--they were assembled then refrigerated overnight. I sauteed the cakes several hours before serving, then heated them at 250 degrees, just before serving. Cornmeal made a nice crust. We used the Chive and Caper Sauce from Bon Appetit 12/99-divine. Will make again!

I made this using my food processor, it was so easy! Instead of the tartar sauce I made bearnaise sauce and served these crab cakes along side of filet mignon also topped with the sauce.... It was wonderful and there was not a scrap left on anyone's plate - The only drawback was the cost, the crab alone cost me about $45 ... ouch.
