Wonderful cookies- Followed the recipe except that I added a tiny bit of fresh ground black pepper for extra spice. Chilled in a quasi-rectangular shape wrapped in non-stick foil for at least an hour and was able to cut even sizes of dough to roll in sugar. Recipe made about 3 dozen 2 inch cookies as I was not using these for ice cream sandwiches. Will def make again soon!!

I make this recipe just as written and the cookies are soft and fabulous. In the fall, I used pumpkin pie ice cream and served them at Thanksgiving- wonderful!

I don't make these often enough. They are delicious. I make using a medium cookie scoop (about 2 tablespoons, bake for 15 minutes). The recipe doubled yields 56 cookies, not enough for tomorrow's party since my kids and husband got into them. The cookies work well with Energee Egg Replacer, if you have an egg allergy. It's a soft, chewy, sort of crispy cookie that has great taste.

Ehhh...I've had better gingersnap cookies (actually the "Gingersnap" cookie recipe from epicurious is the best). This one made the cookies out a bit hard & I really did not enjoy the after-taste. I would not make these again.

Excellent cookies! The recipe says "6" but I made them smaller and ended up with 33! I baked them on parchment paper for 6 minutes exactly- and they were perfect! I also used pumpkin ice cream instead of vanilla, and they were a big hit!

Very delicious and a big hit with both adults and grownups. Next time, I would make the cookies smaller by half as the larger cookie made a very big sandwich. We sliced ours in half for one serving. For the ice cream, I used diced candied ginger and that worked fine. I also added some finely grated lemon zest to the ice cream and that was great. Make sure that the ice cream hardens back up before making the sandwiches, otherwise, the ice cream sloshes all over the sides of the cookies when you press them together.

Fabulous cookies. I was looking for a knock-off of the ginger cookies from the CakeWalk Bakery in Paia, Maui and this sure comes close! They are soft, slightly chewy cookies with a bit of crunch on the top. Now my husband and I can have these treats without flying halfway across the Pacific to get them! I did not make them into sandwiches with the ice cream, but the cookies made exactly according to the recipe are definitely worth a try for ginger cookie lovers.

These are great cookies -- but one word of caution. Twice I have made a double recipe but afraid to simply double the ingredient amounts, I made two batches of dough. Both times, I used an open box of (dark) brown sugar for one batch and a new one for the other. Using brand new brown sugar makes an ENORMOUS difference. Even using brown sugar that has been packed away for a couple of weeks keeps the cookies from spreading out the way they should.

These cookies were good, not great. I would have liked them with more of a chewier/crispier combination. I made some other ginger cookies from Martha Stewart Living, August 2003, and those were much better.

These were great cookies...chewy, crispy edges, exactly the right amount of sweet/spicy/molasses. Everyone at work raved, and my boyfriend wouldn't stop eating them. I skipped the ice cream, too, and made about 2 1/2 doz. regular cookies. I'm making more for Halloween college care packages!

I was looking for a great Molasses cookie recipe to make for my dad. I chose this recipe due to the reviews and it was no disappointment, believe me! Everyone loved them, especially my dad! This is definitely a keeper and comes HIGHLY recommended! I skipped the ice cream and just made them regular sized cookies. ENJOY THEM!

I made these ice cream sandwiches and took them to a summer garden party, and they were the dessert hit of the afternoon! The ginger molasses cookie is a perfect match for the vanilla ice cream. Not too bland, not overpowering! And, so easy to make, store, and serve. You and your guests will certainly enjoy having these on hand, especially if it's a warm sunny day!

This recipe was fabulous. I bought these cookies from a wonderful gourmet bakery and my boyfriend loved them! I found this recipe, made them over the weekend and he insists that they are even better than the bakery. The recipe was easy to make with easy to get ingredients and the cookies are absolutely delicious. They flew off the table. I'm making more this weekend. I am an Epicurious fan for life!

I loved this recipie, and I hope everyone tries this cause it is really really good! I also didn't use the Ice cream, but I'm sure it would be great.

These are awsome cookies. If you want to kick up the ginger flavor a bit, add a tablespoon or two of finely chopped candied ginger. I haven't tried these with icecream yet, but I'm sure it would be great.

I didn't consider myself a fan of ginger cookies until i made these. My 3-year old wanted to make "gingerbread cookies" so i tried this recipie - I'm glad I did. The cookies were delicious and just the right soft texture. They do make rather large cookies so if you're not using for the sandwiches, you may want to reduce the size and time accordingly.

I too only made the cookies, and they were wonderful! I am definately filing this in the recipe book.

excellent cookies. They didn't look like they were done after 15 minutes, but I took them out of the oven anyway and they firmed up beautifully! (I also didn't bother with the icecream.) Simple to make and delicious!

Just made the cookies (no ice cream involved), and they were the best ginger cookies I've ever had! And I am a ginger cookie freak. Make these ASAP!
