Wow! A new favorite main dish salad just in time for summer. I used many suggestions here, including the addition of sesame oil, udon noodles, red pepper, chopped cilantro and garlic chili sauce. I will be making this--and variations-- again and again.

Really great! Super easy and easy to modify as you wish (and as indicated by the numerous reviews). I wrapped everything up in rice paper wrappers and used the ginger/lemon dressing as a dipping sauce. SOO Great!

Incredible but made with a lot of the modifications others stated. Shrimp marinated in lime juice, garlic and sriracha hot sauce then pan cooked. Made udon noodles that were seasoned with seseame seeds and oil and deep fried garlic flakes (bought at an oriental store). Once shrimp were done noodles were added to skillet to be rewarmed along with all other ingredients. I want to make a second dish right now.

I liked this. Had the writer before ever tried rice noodles? That is their texture, which I like (and served this cold for a work lunch). I also added chopped cilantro and sesame oil. Also topped with toasted sesame seeds for a pretty presentation.

The noodles were slimy and the taste was bland although I tried to spice it up a bit by using some sesame oil and rice vinegar. Perhaps the unpleasant consistency was due to the fact that I served this salad cold. The recipe was silent on the preferred serving temperature but it was definitely not appetizing served cold. This was a real waste of good shrimp.

This is a keeper--both my husband and I liked it a lot, but I made it with some of the modifications suggested by other reviewers: I gussied up the dressing with garlic, hot chili sauce, lots of nam pla, and used a stick blender to mix it--very nice! I marinated the shrimps in lemon juice, olive oil, garlic and ginger and then grilled them. Served the salad over a bed of lettuce and passed the extra dressing. It was excellent! Next time I may try the red pepper flakes and cilantro...

I followed the recipe as indicated, but added chopped cilantro and fresh julienne cucumber and replaced part of the vegetable oil with sesame oil. I real hit! Will definitely keep this recipe inmy fav's

I made this dish this summer for a get-together and it was a hit! I've been asked to make it several times since. It's easy, elegant and very light with the lemon ginger sauce!

We really liked this. It was light, but filling. The flavors were really nice--the ginger, honey and lemon combination was delicious.

An Easy make ahead summer dinner. I also added red pepper flakes and garlic and I sprinkled chopped peanuts on top for an added bit of texture and taste. Will surely make again.

Simple to make and very tasty. I took the advice of other reviewers and added some fresh garlic and hot pepper flakes.

Tried this because I was curious about cooking with rice noodles. I found their boinginess a little unnverving, but here goes...Sauteed the shrimp with some minced garlic and Thai chili paste. Threw the shells into the cooking water for the noodles. Added just a bit of the paste to the dressing, along with a little sesame oil. Used about half the rice noodles that were called for, and didn't bother with the scissors--I just ran a paring knife through them, which seemed to work fine. I served it with the Asian Pear Slaw (which, not surprisingly, is made with chili paste, the theme here), which had the same sweet-hot thing going on, and beer. My husband loved it, and kept going back to add more avocado. Will definitely make again, and may try something else for the carrots. The taste was right, but the texture was a little bit dense. Maybe cucumbers?

I will probably make this recipe again, but mostly because it's an easy and light summer dish. I tried to spice up the dressing, but even with major alterations (and leaving it to marinate overnight), it was too bland. I'll try something a little more like a chili-lime dressing next time.

I found this recipe to be terribly bland, and will not be making it again as written.

I added crushed red pepper (2 tsp)and it melded well with the ginger. Very nice.

This recipe lacked something, I think I found it. I sprinkled a little curry powder on ieach serving and it really perked it up.

I altered the recipe by adding a smashed clove of garlic, lots of fish sauce, some hot chili paste, tamari, and rice wine vinegar. The vinagrette seemed to lack oomph, so I added it. Much better!

I liked this quite a lot, as did my dinner guests, who accepted portions to go. The recipe doubles easily, to serve 4-6, and prospers from reducing the honey and increasing the lemon juice.
