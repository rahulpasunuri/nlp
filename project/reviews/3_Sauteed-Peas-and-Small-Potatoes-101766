I didn't do the pea pods as I needed a more traditional side to go with Julia's Coq au Vin, but this was great. I was able to find an assortment of the smaller red, dutch yellow, and purple potatoes. The only thing I might do differently next time is add some diced shallots.

great recipe if you doctor it a bit -- I added a bunch of scallions which I added first along with much more pepper and salt. Good use of new vegies

I probably would have given this 2 forks myself, but my husband loves it and has aksed for it twice in the past month! It is a very simple, clean and crisp dish. It does make a lovely side dish.
