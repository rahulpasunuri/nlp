This recipe has been a Thanksgiving tradition in my family since Bon Appetit published the recipe in 1994. I leave out the sausage when making on Thanksgiving, but leave it in and serve with a green salad to make a nice dinner on other occasions. Love this recipe, and have never had a problem with it having too much liquid as some others have commented.

I use hot turkey sausage in this, it turns out really well!

I made this for Thanksgiving many years ago, I don't always make it because I like to try new recipes. Every year I get the request from my husband "Can you do the sausage and sweet potato thing?" I will this year, it is always a hit!!

I tried this recipe on my brave and willing husband as practice for a Thanksgiving meal. I'm still a novice cook, so I wanted to practice the recipe before actually serving it to my entire family! The first time I made it, I used sweet potatoes (not yams), and I followed the advise from a previous review and made sure to reduce the liquid to right amount. I knew it was going to turn out right when my whole house started smelling irresistably yummy! And, in fact, it turned out great! The second time I made it for Thanksgiving and I decided to use yams instead just for the color. This time it turned out just as good and lots of rave reviews from my friends and family!

This is yummy. I've made it several times with the following modifications: Since I'm veggie, I use field roast vegan apple sage sausage (the flavor pairs really well with sweet potatoes) and veggie broth. Usually I end up using yellow onions instead of leeks, because I always have some on hand. The liquid does take a while to reduce. I usually get it started in a separate pot while I cook the veggie sausage and onions. Oh, and I usually add chopped sage in addition to the thyme, as I have a giant bush of it out back & the flavor goes well.

I love this recipe...I have made it for years! My favorite sweet potato recipe. There are very few people I dine with with sophisticated taste enough to appreciate the rich savory flavors of this recipe. The first time I made it I made it exactly like the recipe...since then, I have reduced the liquid some. I am sorry to say that I will not be making it this year, but sticking to a more traditional dish. Maybe for Christmas. Bon Appetito

This is one of my Thanksgiving favorite recipes! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect, the crowd loved it!

Let me start off by clearly stating I am reviewing a modified version of this recipe. I had sweet potatoes, and I had reduced-fat pork sausage, and I knew I wanted to use them both. I didn't have leeks, so I substituted what I had -- 2 cups red onion, 2 cups celery, and 2 cloves of garlic. I also used peach nectar in place of apricot. Now that that's all clear, I gotta say this was delish. I had no problems boiling the liquid down in 15 minutes, as others have stated. Maybe they were simmering, instead of boiling? I had my heat at about 75%. I didn't measure the result, but it was at least 1.5 cups, and it was the perfect amount. I mistakenly left the butter out of the broth, but I didn't miss it and I don't think 2 pats of butter would have significantly changed the liquidity. I would give this 3.5 stars. Even modified, it was a perfect dinner all by itself. I will definitely make it again -- and I'll even try to have the right ingredients next time! This is a great, and different, way to have both sweet potatoes and sausage. Give it a shot!

This is one of my favorites! I reduce the liquid LOTS but then it's sweet and savory and delicious,

I agree with below, sounded good in theory but was a big disapointment. Reduced liquid as suggested, still found overall flavors to be distinctly lacking.

This recipe was not very good. The mix of flavours and ingredients in theory sound like a nice combination, but the end result was disapointing. There was too much liquid even after I reduced the amount, as suggested by others. I can honestly say it was probably the worst dish i've ever made.

This did not taste good - it came out vinegary tasting and the cooking time called for was not enough to soften the potatoes. I would not make this again.

I make this recipe a couple of times a year. My friends all call it 'meat candy', because of the meat and the sweet. It's delicious. We tend to use chicken sausage to try and lighten it up.

Really good! I don't like too sweet tasting sweet potato recipes, so this was perfect. It is a nice savory dish. I should have cooked the sauce down to 1 cup as others recommended b/c mine was a little soupy. I'll know next time though.

I just made this for Thanksgiving dinner and received rave reviews. I followed the recipe to a tee and found that the balance between sweet and savory was perfect. The broth made the potatoes so tender, they melted in my mouth. Yum! This recipe is definitely a keeper, and isn't difficult to follow, either.

Smells divine and tastes super yummy--hard to stop eating it! And the way it's prepared, the fat is cooked out of the sausage and drained away. Only "problem" is, as someone else said, it takes about 1/2 hour to boil down the liquid, not 15 min. Recommend preparing it one day, as suggested, and then baking it the next, if you don't want to have to start way ahead of dinnertime.

Made this recipe for thanksgiving 2005 and followed all instructions. Reduction to 1 1/2 cups takes longer than 15 minutes, but the final result is amazing. Everyone (even my finicky guests) loved it. This would be great done in a pie dish (recipe halved) and given as a "get well" gift for anyone because it is a meal in one. This one's a keeper!

Looking for an alternate to the norm for sweet potatoes for Thanksgiving and found this one. The apricot nectar seemed kinda wierd to me so I reduced this amount and increased the broth and wine to make up for it. I reduced the liquid to 1 cup to avoid the soupiness other reviewers mentioned and left all other instructions the same. The result was great. I will make this again next year but further decrease the amount of nectar or eliminate it completely.

a friend and i found this recipe a few years back and it has become a staple of holiday dinners ever since.

We really enjoyed this. In response to comments from previous reviewers in Toronto and Lancaster, I was careful to reduce the liquid mixture (my final product measured just under 1 1/2 cups) and my casserole was very juicy. I have a feeling that the leftovers will be less so, but it was delicious in any case. I used kielbasa sausage (chopped and cooked as directed) instead, since that's what I had on hand. Also, added a little rosemary with the thyme. Prep-time was not incredibly speedy, but the make-ahead instructions were helpful. A keeper we will definitely make again!

A little more time-consuming than I expected, but still worth the trouble. The apricot nectar provides an interesting flavor dimension to the finished dish.

This dish will not be too "juicy" if you reduce the white wine/apricot nectar mixture as the recipes instructs. I found it to be a wonderful departure from the usual sweet potato recipes.

we loved this recipe -- it was a bit too juicy so we served it over rice.

Great way to serve sweet potatoes at a holiday potluck, great alternative to brown sugar and marshmallows.

Amazing, I used Mild Venison sausage instead of pork, which goes so well with Thyme. I was really concerned with the amount of Thyme, but it was just the right amount. This one is a keeper, I get so bored with the normal cassaroles.

This smelled funny and tasted worse. One of the few dishes I've made that I actually felt I had to apologize for. Thank goodness my Thanksgiving guests were all family.

I followed the recipe exactly, but was disappointed with the final results. I brought it to our large family gathering for Thanksgiving; about half liked it, the other half said it was good but wouldn't want it again. Maybe my expectations were too high, and though it wasn't horrible, I wouldn't make it again. I'll stick with our family favorite, Sweet Potato-Cashew Bake with Peaches.

I've also made this dish since the recipe appeared in 1994. It's not only great the day of, but also great leftover. I'm really glad to have found this in the database, since I'm out of town.

I have made this recipe every Thanksgiving, Christmas, AND Easter holiday since it appeared in the Nov 1994 issue. When we are invited to other friends or relatives homes for the holidays; this is one of the items that I take. This is a wonderful dish for those who don't like or cannot indulge in a lot of sweets.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner this past year. Everyone raved. It does take some preparation but the end result is well worth it. I even ate the leftovers for breakfast. It has a great combination of flavors; perfect for that big family dinner or brunch.
