I have made this many, many times and even people who swear they hate pumpkin, love it. It is like eating ice cream and it is fabulous. A little goes a long way though. Very rich.

I made this dessert for Thanksgiving with family as a derivation from a traditional pumpkin pie. Everyone loved it and raved (but me). It was easy to make ahead of time and the presentation was just awesome! The crust was delicious. The filling was definately creamy and had all of the spices of a pumpkin pie taste but seemed to be missing the pumpkin. My kids have asked me to make this as one of our Christmas desserts, so I will try to improvise.

Really a FABULOUS recipe. I have never reviewed a recipe before this one, but it is SO rich, light and delicous I simply had to tell you to MAKE THIS DESSERT! Truly, truly wonderful.

I expected more from this recipe. The crust was the best part. The topping was messy to serve and eat even though it was frozen. It really was lacking in the flavor department. Although I will make the crust again for something better.

Well, I REALLY wanted to love this recipe, but just didn't. It was easy, beautiful but left me longing for more (and better) taste. It was as though it didn't know what it wanted to be. The pumpkin flavor was lacking & most of all, the texture was "off". The pecan shell was stellar, but the filling just doesn't do justice to it...

I made this for Thanksgiving and it turned out beautiful. My only recommendation would be to mix the cream, sugar and yolks in a mixer before bringing it to a saucepan to heat. I didn't whisk it well enough and ended up with egg stuck to the bottom of the saucepan. Otherwise a wonderful tasting dessert. Unfortunately it didn't get much attention at the dinner table because someone else brought a Cheesecake factory dessert :)

Definately a winner. Served at Thanksgiving as a variation on the traditional pumpkin pie. Was easy to make a couple days before which made preparing for Thanksgiving less stressful. Wonderful taste and beautiful presentation!

I've made this torte since the year it was published in Bon Ap. It is definitely rich but also creamy. It really is like an ice cream cake. One year I tried to lighten the ingredients and that is the year it was icy (not that bad, but icy). I have to make it for a big crowd because it is too rich for a small one. It can be make ahead of time and it isn't all that difficult.

I made this for a halloween party and it was a big hit. Everyone raved. I only cooked the crust for 8 minutes and it turned out great. I will be making this for Thanksgiving.

This took some work but was a very impressive dessert that got raves. You could definitely taste the pumkin in the filling of this torte, but I thought that the crust was the hightlight.

I dream about this dessert! I have made it twice and plan to make it again this fall. It is beautiful and delicious. I keep it in the freezer and cut a small piece for myself each day until it is gone. And I couldn't care less about pumpkin pie.

Personally, I'm divided. I decided to go with something light as everyone was expecting me to make a cheesecake. It was tasty enough but I didn't care for the icy texture - not creamy. I guess the reviews sum it up: my husband said it was the best dessert he ever had but my brother in law asked "is this supposed to be frozen?" Nuff said.

I made this dish for Thanksgiving the same year it was published. It's a signature dish people come to expect from me. They just love it! However, it is not for anyone dieting!!!

This was easy to make, but impressed my guests. I arranged whole pecans in a pattern all over the top which made a nice presentation. I thought the caramel sauce was unnecessary and only offered it on the side. This dessert was a great make-ahead dessert.

I could not find the topping as described and e-mailed Barbara, Jennifer and Karen, who all responded generously and unanimously, endorsing caramel sauce, as well as suggesting toasting the pecans, and slightly thawing before serving. My guests all loved it!

This dessert has been a holiday staple in my home since it was first published in 1994. It makes a beautiful presentation and the fact that it must be done ahead of time is an added bonus.

BEAUTIFUL... to look at as well as taste! I've made this many times, and it's always a big success. Quite a few steps but all done ahead so not too bad. I will continue to make this whenever an elegant and delicious dessert is needed.
