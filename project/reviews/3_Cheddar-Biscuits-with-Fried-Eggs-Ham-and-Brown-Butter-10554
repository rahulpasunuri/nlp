I keep rereading the biscuit recipe trying to see where I went wrong. I followed the recipe exactly except for doubling. These were greasy and unappetizing. I think they may need more flour to the amount of cheese. Disappointing.

I used this quick biscuit recipe to satisfy a craving for the cheddar biscuits they serve at Red Lobster. Totally hit the spot. I double it, and since the dough seemed rather moist - and I was feeling rather lazy - I just dropped them onto a cookie sheet with a spoon. Fantastic, will totally make these again for a yummy treat!

This was a real treat. Too fattening to eat very often - but what a treat on a lazy weekend.

As other reviewers mentioned, the portion sizes were distressing. I didn't perceive this as having an equitable flavor/time trade-off.

I thought this was pretty good albiet rich and fattening. I think the biscuits were just delicious by them selves. I would consider putting this on a brunch buffet.

Had trouble with the biscuits.

I'm in total agreement with the other two reviewers. This was absolutely delicious. The kids LOVED IT (even my picky 10 year son)! My suggested serving size is 2 per person - but don't be surprised if you get asked for thirds.

These cheddar cookies are SOOOOOO good!!!!! I was looking for a quick recipe of biscuits to add on top of a chicken pate a la creme... and they are certainly going to become a classic in my house!! So tasty, so delicate, so YUMMY!!! THANKS!

You may want to triple this recipe since it only makes 2 biscuits. You'll be sorry if you don't because they are sooo...good. I modified a bit using poached eggs, turkey bacon and NO butter...it's really not necessary. The biscuits are FULL of cheese...so much that they almost fall apart. Great for breakfast.
