I give this 3 forks mainly because they were fun to make and looked pretty awesome. They tasted alright and were a bit tough but I have to mention that this is my first time baking yeast bread and did everything by hand, so this could very well be to blame, hah. The dip is quite good (I used maple syrup). Regardless of me thinking they were kinda tough, they got gobbled up. Definitely worth trying for Halloween, really very simple to make and I'm sure kids would love helping stretching the fingers and putting together.
