The cooking directions could be clearer. I watched a youtube video which helped clarify when the potatoes would be done (crumble/break easily when forked). I brought the water to a boil (which took a while since I used 2+ lbs of potatoes). I then reduced the heat to med-low heat to simmer the potatoes for 10-15 minutes. I added olive oil, thyme and more butter and milk. It was pretty good.

Followed it almost exactly (just added some garlic salt) and it turned out great. Creamy, flavorful, and fast.

Outstanding results with minimal effort. I actually used 3 pounds of potatoes but substituted light cream for the milk and used the same amount of butter. Made them a couple of hours before company arrived and reheated in the oven. You won't be disappointed.

Great basic recipe. I substite some of the milk with sour cream, add garlic powder and some chives. Always creamy and delicious!!

I don't know what happened. I used red potatoes (not baby reds) and followed the recipe, but they took forever to cook until soft and were gummy when I mashed them. Everyone thought they tasted good but I was very disappointed in the texture.

I changed this recipe a LOT... I added rosemary sprigs to the water, roasted garlic and shallot cloves and substituted goat's milk yogurt for the butter (about 1 1/2 - 2 cups) and it was delish.

Great mashed potatoes. I used my Cuisinart because I don't have a potato masher and they were the easiest mashed potatoes I've ever made.

i love red potato anything and this was simple and tasty.

Excellent, exactly the type of mashed potatoes I love. I didnt use all the milk/butter and they came out very creamy, probably could have gotten away with less and they would have still been great.

This recipe was AMAZING! I used 5 pounds instead of 2 (I have a large family) and doubled the milk and butter. I did do some things differently, I used salted butter because I don't like unsalted butter and added a little salt, pepper and garlic powder for flavor. They were smooth, creamy and delicious. I will use this recipe every time I have to make mashed potatoes in the future.
