I have made this recipe twice with my homegrown yellow crookneck squash. The first time I followed the recipe, being careful not to brown the garlic, but it turned into little charcoal bits by the end of the broiling. This distracted from the look and taste. The second time I browned the squash in olive oil and sprinkled them with garlic powder just before adding the parmesan and putting them in the broiler. This made it a really excellent dish! Loved that crunchy topping. Also the second time I was careful to use squash all the same size and on the thin side. I think if I had to use larger diameter squash I'd trim them to make them flatter and cook more evenly. Now I wish I'd planted more squash this year!

I thought it was a very unique way to make zucchini, so I was intrigued. But when you came down to it, the parmesan just overpowered the delicate squash flavor.

I really liked this recipe as did all of my guests. I diced up some tomatoes and basil with a pinch of sea salt, drained the mixture in a colander for about 10 minutes and topped the zucchini boats with it. I think it added a little "zing" and made it almost like a bruschetta. Delicious. As another reviewer had mentioned previously, I think there is a typo in the recipe and it should really read "careful to NOT let the garlic brown."

It was good, but not fabulous The browned garlic made the zucchini a little bitter. My stepson would not eat it The balsamic zucchini also on this site, is a much better recipe

This is a simple way to serve zucchini deliciously. My daughter ate all of hers, and that is the real test in my house.

To the cook on 3/4/04: What the hell is wrong with you? I was working up an appetite until I read your disgusting, pathetic attempt at humor. Thanks alot.

This was super easy, quick and good. I had a bunch of baby sunburst squash that I needed to use - so I followed the recipe and tossed them with grilled chicken over pesto & angelhair. Easy and good (pretty too).

The parmesan broiled onto the squash makes this dish a winner. Even the 14 month old ate it. Excellent way to prepare a dull vegetable.

This is one of the best zucchini recipes I have ever tried. My husband is no zucchini fan and kept reaching for more. I used a mix of parm and romano cheese and a bit more garlic in the butter than suggested - wonderful!

Zucchinis never tasted so good. I added the garlic cloves whole, just flatten with the blade of a knife, which burns with less ease and can be taken away from the pan if it starts to brown too much. I served them as a main dish with a salad of baby leaves tossed with tomatoes, avocado and mozzarella but they will make a wonderful side dish to a richer meal and I will serve them as part of a buffet next time I have the opportunity.

Simple and tasty, plus my husband loved it!

This is the best zucchini I ever ate! I increased the garlic to 1 tablespoon (can one ever have too much garlic?) and I used freshly grated peccorino romano cheese, about 1/2 cup. I could eat this every day and I don't really care for zucchini! Yumpters!

Thought this recipe was fantastic. So easy and so delicious! Will definitely make again this week.

A good use of zucchini from my garden, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to procure zucchini just for this recipe. My family also thought this was a good, but not great dish.

Loved it, loved it, loved it. This is a great tasting recipe. I like it so much I'm making it again tonight.

Pretty good! I make this when I'm in a hurry and don't want to deal with too many ingredients. Goes well with spaghetti and garlic bread.

This is a wonderful, easy, and almost instant treat! We have organic vegetables delivered every week and summer provides more zucchini than we know what to do with...but unexpected guests as well as invited enjoy this spontaneous, delicious appetizer! The quality of ingredients makes this a simple and spectacular beginning to any meal.

Just okay. The kids snubbed it. It needs some kick..red onions and diced tomatoes or maybe a zesty red sauce over the top.

I wish I took the time to read the reviews before I made this. The "as-is" recipe needs some revisions to be appealing to me. It was ok, but I wouldn't go out of my way to make it again.

Simple to prepare and delicious. I grow zucchini and this is a surefire way to use it. My whole family enjoys this dish. A cast iron skillet can go from stovetop to broiler.

I've been making this Italian side standard for ages. It's a great veggie side for simple linguine with red sauce. Add a loaf of warm French bread with garlic butter and a nice bottle of Chianti. Good as any Italian restaurant without ever leaving home!

good easy side dish that was easy but looked impressive, would definitely make again

Not bad for an occasional side dish. I took the advice and topped it with diced chopped tomato and shallot - I added the shallot with the garlic and the tomato to slightly warm before putting the parmesan on. I omitted the broiling and simply flipped the zucchini around, sprinkled parmesan on top and put a lid on it until it melted.

This is an easy to prepare dish. It may be simple for sophisticated tastes, but it pairs well with more flavorful foods. I made it with fresh from my garden baby zucchini, and we all enjoyed it - including my 24 year old "kid", who had dropped by for a home cooked meal.

This is good. It is simple to make and goes with just about anything.

I followed the lady from Texas' advice about the tomato and onion mixture to throw on top afterwards. That was great. A good side dish even if you don't have kids. We used Romano cheese and it was great. It made it a little tarter. Yum!

Very easy, good, and a great use for zucchini.

Cute for kids, but kind of simple for the adult pallate. I'd suggest adding a little diced tomato, red onion, and fresh basil w/ a drizzle of balsamic vinegar and olive oil as a topper after broiling. I think there's an error as well...during garlic saute should read 'be careful NOT to let the garlic brown.'

Excellent!!! My family loved this dish! I wish I would have doubled the recipe because when they asked for seconds there were none!!

Tried this recipe for the first time this evening -- it went very well with barbequed chicken and potato salad. I didn't have an oven-proof skillet, so I transferred the vegetables to a pizza pan before placing under the broiler. It worked fine.
