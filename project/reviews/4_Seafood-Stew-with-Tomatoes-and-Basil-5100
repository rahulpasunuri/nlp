I have made this dish every year since it first appeared in 1998. It's easy, delicious and gets better the longer it sits. I enhance it here and there, but generally keep the recipe as is. Excellent. Excellent.

Excellent! Easy! -- like the reviewer from Oak Park I used a 28 ounce can of tomatoes and 3 bottles of clam juice (so no half-used bottles of anything) but otherwise followed the recipe to a "T" and I thought it was delicious. Definitely a keeper.

The only thing I changed was using seafood stock instead of clam stock. This makes a fantastic, hearty soup. I would not call it a stew, though. Without the stock, it would be the perfect stew consistency. This also froze well.

Rating: 3
Very nice, 3 stars becuase lots of tweaks needed to really bring it up. Mine were simple, added the scallops like many, simmered extra 30 minutes, a little white pepper, some lightly smoked haddock in with shellfish and a dash of habernero tabasco. Also, impossible to get clam juice here in England so used fish stock/veg stock combo (homemade).

Everyone loves this recipe.. If you can open a can, you can make this simple recipe. Delicious combination of tomato and fennel

I was craving something light and tasty this winter and made this using a frozen seafood mix from Trader Joe's. It would be even better with fresh seafood, but it rocked my world either way. Don't skimp on the fresh basil. I also didn't use as much clam juice, but it was fine.

Rating: 4
Great recipe, but I'm so tired of recipe quantities not being standard size containers. I used a 28 oz can of tomatoes, 3 bottles of clam juice, a pound of crab meat and added 3/4 lb of scallops. Guess what! It came out great and no partial cans, bottles taking up space in the frig!

Rating: 3
Great, quick soup for a cold day. I added 1/2 lb scallops and would replace canned crab with large chunk, crab meat. I also used the largest peeled and deveined shrimp which presents better than the medium shrimp. Iced tea and fresh sourdough bread topped off a wonderful meal!

I first made this as a luncheon meal for me and a friend. We loved it! I added fresh fennel instead of fennel seeds along with the onion and sauted. I also boiled much longer than 15 minutes to thicken, more like 45 minutes. Keep an eye on it. I also added scallops. Yum, daughter loves it too!

Rating: 4
So, yes, a little pricey, but it was so worth it. And, ridiculously fast and easy as well. It will definitely become our go-to seafood splurge. Next time we're going to make it less soupy and serve it over rice or noodles....yum.

I made this dish last night and it was great. However, instead of using the canned products it calls for, I used fresh sea bass, scallops and shrimp and it was superb! I will be making this dish again for guests.

Quick prep and execution, with nicely flavored results. It can't get any easier than this, plus you can toss in any seafood you like in addition to the ones specified. Around New Years, all the shellfish is on sale, so I added some lobster claw meat as well. It didn't remind me of seafood pasta sauce at all, but it isn't quite the consistency of a true cioppino. But it will do in a pinch.

Rating: 4
Ditto all the accolades -- the cioppino is healthy, very easy to make, and most of all, full of flavor -- perfect. I was nervous about using canned clams and canned crabmeat rather than fresh, but the result was lovely (and much cheaper.) We enjoyed this New Year's Eve with warm rolls and butter, and it will be a new tradition.

This was the best seafood stew I have ever made.I added hallibut,some creole seasoning and old bay to give it a punch. It was easy to prepare and it was done in one pot. Can't beat it. I would recommend this to anyone for a dinner party or a cozy get together!

To make the recipe quicker I forgo the shrimp (because of the cleaning, etc.) and throw in a bag of frozen bay scallops.

Super yummy! I made it for lunch with a friend and we both loved it. I was short on wine and clam juice by a 1/2 cup but it was still great. I also used frozen pre-cooked shrimp and added halibut chunks (from frozen). I think this really could work using any seafood. I paired it with a Pinot Grigio and a crusty baguette and it was perfect.

Rating: 4
Amazing, loved it! Changed things up a little, put more fennel seed, garlic, 2 bay leaves, 1 tbsp anchovy paste, and I used tomato sauce (the Italian bottled one), and red wine instead. I strained the stewed sauce after 30 mins and returned it to the pot. Then when I was almost ready to serve I added the fish (Shrimp, scallops, crab leg meat, sea bass) and basil (lightly chopped almost full) to cook just a touch longer. Turned out better without the texture of onions and such. Straining the sauce cuts out any replica to a pasta sauce, and makes it more like a thick broth. Served thinly sliced baguettes brushed with olive oil, minced garlic and salt, and lightly charred on the grill, laid lightly on top.

Rating: 4
This was great stuff, though I must confess it was a last-minute, what-should-I-do-with-this-shrimp decision, so I didn't have all the exact ingredients. I used shrimp and tilapia, would love to add more seafood next time. I used petite cut diced tomatoes, which are just right for dishes like this, as we don't like big hunks of canned tomatoes. The seasonings were fantastic -- loved the fennel! I used red pepper flakes (added w/ the onion) instead of cayenne. I also didn't have any white wine, so I used red (which was terrific alongside). Served w/ a crisp green salad and homemade garlic herb focaccia. Delish!

Rating: 4
The best part about this recipe is you can really use any combination of seafood you want to and it will come out great. Last time I made it I used chopped lobster tails in place of the crabmeat-Fabulous! This is even better the next day. We like it as a delicious seafood sauce over pasta.

Rating: 4
I have made this numerous times with the following changes. I always double the recipe. Use fresh fennel, ad scallops and any kind of mild white fish cut into chunks. Also cook liquid for about 45 mins then add the fish right before serving. You can also make the broth, freeze it and then use it whenever the mood strikes you to have seafood stew.

Rating: 2
I made this exactly as directed. In my opinion it had too much tomato. It reminded me of seafood pasta sauce. The cioppinos I have had are a thinner soup with fresh clams, mussels, crab legs etc. Of course, that would make this more time consuming. I think it's good - not great, and it needs to be adjusted. May not make it again.

This recipe turned out great. I doubled the recipe and it produced much more than 8 servings. This was my first time making a soup with seafood and tomato and the two compliment each other very well in this recipe. If people like soups/stews with more vegetables I added 2 red peppers, 2 portabellas, and 3/4 cup of spinach and it tasted great. you can also put less crab and clams in and add in a pound of cubed mahi, monkfish, or swordfish.

Awesome. Destined to become one of "my" recipes. I also simmered for longer, and made some changes to the seafood composition based on what was fresh.

This dish is excellent. I've made this recipe twice now. The first time I made it exactly as written, and second using some of the recommendations from other readers. I used fresh fennel, added scallops and swordfish, and let it simmer slowly for over an hour. It is even better the next day.

Rating: 3
My husband and I enjoyed this, but I would make a few changes next time. I would cut the tomatos in half and make up the difference with either fish or chicken stock. I thought it tasted a bit like seafood in spaghetti sauce as it is now. I followed other's suggestions and simmered for an hour and 1/4 and that made a big difference. Finally, I added bay scallops and cut back on the clams and shrimp. They're inexpensive and yummy. It's a good recipe and one that will be fun the fiddle with.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe for when it starts getting cool outside and so incredibly simple to make. My bf loved it and said it tasted like a dish from a very upscale restaurant. Like others, I simmered for 1 hour instead of boiling for 15 minutes. I also substituted bay scallops for the crabmeat. Finally, the paprika really adds much to this dish. So tasty and simple. Served w/ crusty bread and good wine. Perfect!

Rating: 4
Fabulous! However I did use all fresh shrimp, scallops and cherrystone clams. I really enjoyed the fennel seeds and thought that with the pinch of cayenne added at the end left me with the perfect amount of seasoning.

I LOVE this dish. It's easy, hearty and gets better the second day. I actually use fresh diced fennel bulb (about a cup) rather than dried (I saute it in the beginning with garlic and oregano) and I believe this is what makes it so fantastic. I also simmer the liquid down about double what they suggest. Yummy!!!

I just came across an old Bon Appetit magazine (February 1998) and the cover recipe looked so good, I had to try it. This seafood stew is FABULOUS! It's easy to prepare and flavorful. Serve it with a salad, garlic bread and a crisp white wine, as the magazine suggests, and it's a delicious and filling meal. You couldn't get a better dish at even the most expensive restaurants. I suggest following the recipe exactly as written the first time, because I think it's perfect as is. The canned crab meat and clams were excellent...I can't see using fresh when this is a "Too Busy to Cook" recipe.

Rating: 3
Super dish -- very flavorful! FYI for those of you who have a Trader Joes nearby. TJs now has real crab meat in its refridgerated section (reasonably priced) which makes this a much easier dish to prepare than picking through crab shells and much better than using imitation crab.

My husband said this was "the best thing he ever ate"! I was unsure how much fresh fennel to put in (I don't care for fennel seed) and next time I'd put in the whole bulb. I skipped the canned crab and simmered the sauce for 45 min. to thicken as others suggested and popped in fish and seafood at the last minute. We will have this meal again and again!

This is delicious and easy to make. I used shrimp, scallops, littleneck clams and mussels. Did not use crabmeat as other reviewers stated it didn't hold up well.

I did have to let it simmer for almost an hour in order for it to thicken a bit, but it was worth the wait.

I made this stew last night for company and it was hearty and delicious!! Living in "cioppino country" I had high expectations and was not disappointed. I would make the following changes however: (1) add the basil and crushed red pepper with the onion, garlic, etc.; (2)after boiling, simmer for 45 minutes over low heat to increase flavor and allow to fully thicken; and (3) use fresh clams if available. Definitely an impressive meal!

We love this cioppino. I added scallops and threw in a few crab legs instead of the canned crab. I think canned crab tends to disappear into the sauce. Be sure to not skimp on the seafood. Serve with a crusty french bread and a green sald for an excellent fall dinner!

Terrific recipe! I doubled the recipe (cooked the tomato mixture for 15min longer than the recipe called for-before adding the seafood). Added oysters, shrimp, scallops, crab and clams (would have cooked the clams a bit longer had I know they take longer to cook). It was delicious and makes great left overs re-heated!

I substituted celery seeds for the fennel seeds, oysters for the clams and grouper for the crab meat. I did not even have fresh basil so I simmered the broth with dried. In spite of all my substitutions, this dish was truely gourmet. My husband licked the bowl. We have a local restaurant in Birmingham that made it to the top five in Gourmet Magazine. My husband says I could serve this dish there! I recommend making extra broth (double the recipe) and freezing it. Then you can add fresh seafood and have a superb meal in just a few minutes.

I have used this recipe over & over. I vary it depending what I have on hand. Sometimes I use fresh crab, sometimes add scallops, sometimes use all fresh seafood, sometimes all canned or frozen, sometimes use fresh cilantro instead of basil. It always comes out great.

Extremely versatile recipe.

This recipe blew me away! My boyfriend says its the best thing I've ever made. Don't skip the fennel seeds--they're key to the unique flavor. I added more wine--1 cup dry red--and a bay leaf. Also omitted the canned clams and crab and increased the shrimp to 1 1/2 lbs, added 3/4 lbs. bay scallops and about one dozen littleneck clams in the shell towards the end. I had to simmer the broth longer than 15 minute to thicken, but that helped blend the flavors further. I added halibut fillets to some leftover sauce and great too. A truly fantastic dish!

We prepare this stew using whatever is fresh at the seafood market. As a native New Englander, my friends and family would toss me in the Atlantic Ocean if I dared to use anything but fresh seafood! (Of course, there was the time I used the canned clams and crabmeat when stretched for time, and no one had a clue!) We usually use fresh clams and add them to the stew in the shell. Littleneck or cherrystoen clams work best. My husband and in-laws are from Naples, and they love this recipe.

I dissent! This ain't what you get at Pike Place Market, to take one example. Among my gripes: the (canned) crab dissolves (and it's expensive); the tomato overwhelms; and the seafood generally, cept the shrimp, tastes as canned as it is. There are two other cioppino recipes on Epicurious, and either of them has to be better!
