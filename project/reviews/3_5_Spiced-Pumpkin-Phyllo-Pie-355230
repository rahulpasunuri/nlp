excellent recipe, and it turned out to be delicious. My only recommendation is that the recipe should come with the measurement for the amount of pumpkin to use. Unless you are sure of the weight of your squash, and in my case I wasn't because it came from my garden, then you don't know exactly how much to use. About 2 cups of pumpkin or squash per pie...

I used roasted butternut squash which was delicious. Using phyllo dough added a unexpected twist to a traditional desert.

This recipe was easy and delicious! I served the pie warm with fresh whipped cream. The only bad thing about the pie is the crust got really darn brown-- it didn't stay white like the picture.
