If you have a sweet tooth, this is delicious. I would save it for a brunch though or a meal where you might want to substitute for a bread pudding. Do not take it to a potluck though without a sign explaining what it is. It's nothing to look at, so I had to add some powdered sugar for presentation--but I could tell that guests were scared to try it since it was not a visually wow kind of dish. Still the flavor was great. I would suggest doubling the cake as I felt that there wasn't quite enough cake to soak in the syrup mixture--which you want so you can taste more of the maple creamy goodness. Also, the creme fraîche was really nice to have with it. Don't skip out on it.

My mom made pouding chomeur with brown sugar which is also very good. But dark maple syrup makes this desert amazing! It is VERY sweet as pouding chomeur should be and I found the creme fraiche a nice compliment instead of the usual vanilla ice cream or heavy cream.

This recipe is nothing short of FANTASTIC. I have made it three times, twice for major dinner parties, and it always receives rave reviews. I'd like to try it in individual ramekins sometime. I like to top it with a little whipped cream flavoured with a splash of vanilla. A simple, impressive dessert that really can't be beat.

Maple syrup, cream, and butter... What's not to love? The simple (but wonderful) ingredients and the richness put this one in the comfort food category for me. I didn't have an 8x8 baking dish, but my 9x9 worked well.

I made this recipe for a group of folks at work and everyone wanted the recipe! It was easy to make (made it first thing in the morning before work) and I doubled it without any problem. I would strongly recommend serving with the sour cream; it helped to offset the sweetness of the cake; however, it took everything I had not to lick the pan clean! Would definitely make it again.

I happen to live where Maple Syrup is abundant and cheap, and picked up some Grade B just to taste it. Nobody in the family liked it much by itself, but in this recipe, we agree that it is incredible. I've made this again and again, and people always ask for the recipe.

This updated version of Pouding Chômeur is very delicious, very simple and reminiscent of my childhood. Boil the caramel a few minutes before removing it from the heat.

I've had this at Au Pied du Cochon in Montréal, and this is the real deal. I would bake it slightly longer than the 30 minutes called for just to get the syrup a bit more caramelized right around the edges as it was at the restaurant. But this is a very easy recipe that hardly takes anything to throw together. It's very soupy when you put it in the oven, but don't worry--it will all come together in the end. Delicieux!

Delicious! This dessert has quickly become one of my favorites. The texture of the pudding goes so well with that of the flour mixture. Not only is it delicious but completely easy to make, and is not time consuming.
