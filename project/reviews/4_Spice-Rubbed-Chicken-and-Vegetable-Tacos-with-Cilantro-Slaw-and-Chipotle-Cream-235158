Excellent. Good with chicken. Good with pork. Good with shrimp. I treat it like fajitas. Everybody loves!

Oh and when I swapped the shrimp for chicken I added sliced avocado and some cherry tomatoes. Not crucial, but good. Also, I think the slaw is important.

Rating: 4
I liked this so much that I tried it with shrimp too (but without the veggies -- just didn't have them on hand the second time), and I thought that was even better. Highly recommend giving it a try. With the chicken I used the broiler, and with the shrimp I just tossed them in the rub and then sauteed them in canola oil.

I was really hoping this dish would live up to all the positive reviews. For me, it was rather disappointing. To start I followed the recipe almost as written. I say almost because when I got home I realized that I had forgotten to get the coleslaw mix. I decided that a trip back to the store was not in the books, so I did not make the slaw. I made the the rest of the recipe as written, I even had the hot smoked paprika. My main complaint was that the chicken was way to sweet. Maybe the slaw would have balanced out the sweetness of the chicken/veggie mixture, but on its own I found it overwhelmingly sweet to the point that I wouldn't use this rub as written on anything else. Ever. On a personal note, I now know that I don't care for the flavor of Chipotle chilis (or maybe it was the adobo sauce) but either way-yuck. The sour cream was really easy to make but it was not for me. Overall, maybe I didn't like the recipe because I didn't have the slaw or maybe it just wasn't for me. But either way I was so underwhelmed that I don't think this one will get another attempt.

I am obsessed with this rub, it is delicious! The chicken came out perfect but the veggies turned out slightly mushy from too much oil. Next time I'm going to try coating the veggies with oil in a bowl and then covering them with the rub in the pan. The tacos taste great with some fresh pico de gallo too!!

Fantastic, very flexible--we don't have onion powder, so skip it! Middle of winter--you can toss it under the broiler. Low-fat sour cream, normally yucko, made lovely with chipotle. Honestly, absurdly yummy for how simple it is.

This was a fabulous recipe! I've making lots of new recipes the last two weeks and this has been the top rated dish in our house. Husband and teens loved it and said it's a keeper. I mixed smoked paprika with cayenne as could not find hot smoked paprika. Made slaw and cream to go with tacos. What terrific flavors when combined! Definitely will add to repetoire. So easy to make.

This was a fabulous popular dish at a dinner party which I had the other week... however, I read the directions wrong so came up with something a little different (though I plan to try just the rub). I actually mixed the rub with the chipotle cream and put that on the chicken before grilling. It's great and extremely moist. We had some Vegans at the table to had heaps of vegetable sides, rice, and beans for make your own taco. Lots of fun and really tasty.

This is a shockingly good recipe for how easy it is. The rub is great on the chicken (I used a grill pan with excellent results). A mix of hot and smoked Paprika is a fine substitute. Since we're not zucchini fans, I sauteed white onions with the red peppers. This added some nice sweetness to the dish. Corn tortillas are a must for yet another level of flavor. Decrease the amount of sour cream (or in our case, fat free Greek yogurt) and/or increase your chili amount. It doesn't need to be overwhelming but you want the smoke and heat flavor. The slaw is not meant as a side dish; you need to put it in the tacos. Making it last adds a great crunch texture to the tacos but the slaw also tastes fine and adds citrus after it wilts. Will definitely make frequently; most certainly will impress friends. Very authentic dish.

This was really nice, I added a bit of honey to the slaw which definitely added a little something that was needed. We will make this dish again.

Loved these!! I left out the zucchini and added a red onion. The crunchy slaw is such a great complement. Will definitely make again.

A favorite at our house. I usually slice a few sweet onions and cook them on the stove with a little olive oil (one less thing on the grill, and we both like lightly carmelized onions), and we vary the grilled veggies depending upon what's fresh. Greek yogurt, not sour cream just based upon local preference too :-). Great recipe!

Rating: 4
Really nice! This will make it into our regular rotation. We reduced the onion and garlic powder in the rub (I generally shy away from this stuff but it was actually quite good). We also reduced the pepper in the cilantro slaw. We loved everything: the chipotle cream, the chicken & the cilantro slaw. The cilantro slaw is a slightly improved version of a cabbage-lime salad that my mother used to make while we were living in Belize. I loved it!

Rating: 4
Super weeknight recipe with a little more sophistication than your typical chicken tacos, and maybe a little healthier considering the variety of vegetables. I had a poblano pepper on hand and used that instead. The cilantro slaw balances the spiciness of the dish and cold beer, well, makes the whole experience perfect. Make sure you freeze your leftover chipoltes.

Rating: 4
This is a great, easy weeknight recipe that I will definitely make again many times in the future. It would also make for excellent kebabs! A few variations: 1) I used nonfat Fage's greek yogurt instead of sour cream, which is equally delicious and much lighter/healthier. 2) I turned the rub into more of a marinade by tossing 1" chicken cubes with a little canola oil, sprinkling with the spice mixture, tossing to coat and refrigerating in a ziploc bag for about 3 hours (did the same thing in a separate bag with the veggies). This made the chicken very tender and flavorful. 3) I didn't make the slaw and didn't miss it at all. 4) For the veggies, I used red onion, red and yellow peppers and zucchini. Next time I'll omit the zucchini as it felt out of place. The onions were the best part... highly recommend adding. This also tastes delicious served over homemade baked corn tortilla chips with spanish rice, beans and a little cheese... spicy multi-layer nachos, yum!

Excellent recipe. Very nice combination of flavors and textures that work well together. We used homemade flour tortillas though. First time to use smoked paprika. I think I'm hooked. I also think it would be just as tasty (or almost so) as a vegetarian dish using grilled eggplant and/or cauliflower in lieu of the chicken.

Rating: 4
Excellent...would be very good for a party. I used at least 3 chipotles in the sour cream and could have used more. I used smoked paprika and cayenne since I didn't have smoked/hot. I also used Splenda in the rub instead of brown sugar. Instead of the zucchini I used yellow bell peppers and red onions and will do this the next time (maybe add red bell pepper too). I also made guacamole and fresh pico de gallo. I am still grazing as I write this!

i've made this a few times now and it is always a hit and really easy. i use greek yogurt for the chipotle cream rather than sour cream and it is really smooth. for breakfast next day made quesadillas out of leftovers and jack cheese. cut into triangles and served with an over easy egg on top and chipotle cream on side (which i make a bit spicier than recipe calls for).

Fantastic just as written! They were light, easy, a little different and really delicious. There will be extra sauce and cole slaw - which is delicious and light on its own, so make more than the recipe requires of chicken and the veges. We used our first garden zuchini and yellow peppers - everyone loved them with thin flour Guerrero Tortillas.

Basically very good. I think the chicken would have been better in a spice marinate as much of the rub was lost in cooking.

Great! Unexpected guests prompted me to double the recipe for chicken and spice rub, and for 7 people (4 adults, 2 19 year old "boys" and 1 13 year old, it was just about enough. I had NO leftovers at all; it was extremely well-received. The chicken was just spicy enough; the chipotle sour-cream was just right; the veggies were delicious - I would make more next time as my guests were practically licking the bowl. Most of my guests chose flour tortillas while I prefer the corn - certainly there is room for variety here. I added a red onion to the veggies, otherwise followed the recipe.

Rating: 4
This was a great change of pace for our grill (usually steak & salmon). Hubby just loved the tacos. I couldn't find hot smoked paprika, so I did what Amelinda did and combined 1 1/2 teaspoons smoked & 1 1/2 teaspoons of hot - worked great !!! I also added grilled corn as a taco topper - yum ! Made my own slaw (instead of bagged) using green & purple cabbage along with grated carrots plus the rest of the recipe ingredients. Much fresher ... add the dressing just before serving to prevent wilting. The Chipotle cream was a bit hot for my taste, but still very good. Leftovers (if any), are amazing !!!

Rating: 3
This recipe is very good, but a few notes. First of all, for 1 lb. of chicken, 1.5 cups of sour cream is WAY too much. And for 1.5 cups of sour cream, 1 T. of chipotle chilis is WAY too little. I would recommend cutting the sour cream in half unless you want to be figuring out how to use the rest of it. Next is the rub. I found the onion powder to be extremely overwhelming. I actually re-made the rub without the onion powder, and with half the garlic powder. Again, it turned out to be too much rub for a pound of chicken, but I'm not too upset about having extra because I can use it on something else this week. You definitely need the smoked paprika, it makes a huge difference. Next, I left out the zucchini (didn't want the mushy texture), and instead grilled some onions. Turned out to be a great combination. Finally, one pound of chicken does not make "6 servings". I would say it serves three at most. And the corn tortillas are a MUST. If you've never had them, I promise you that once you have, you'll never go back to flour tortillas.

This recipe was a real winner for me. Not only was it easy to make, but it was hard to put down. The combination of flavors really go well together, with a little bit of spiciness and coolness from the pepper-sour cream, and some great seasoning from the chicken and veggies. Would recommend this recipe to anyone who loves tacos.

SO freakin' delicious! Very spicy, full of flavor and not that difficult to make. I forgot which kind of paprika to buy when I went to the store so I bought one container of smoked paprika and one container of hot paprika, then just mixed them when I realized I didn't get the right one. Still worked great and I've found lots of other uses for the spices. Highly recommended!

Amazing! My husband declared this the best meal I have ever made, and I made it 2 nights in a row as a result. I live in Ireland at the moment and thus could not find the bagged slaw mix that was suggested so shredded carrots and sliced cabbage instead. I could not find hot paprika, so used regular, and I used Splenda instead of brown sugar. I made fresh flour tortillas instead of corn, again due to inability to find the ingredients, but this worked really well. I will definitely make this again.

This was the best fajita/taco I have ever had. I did in on the Foreman grill and it was delicious! Grilled up some onion and added it in.

My husband and I loved this. We had it for father's day and my husband just raved. I loved the zuchini and the slaw. I just made my own slaw with shredded cabbage and carrots with the cilantro. I added about a tablespoon of sugar to it. We both emjoyed a large helping of just the slaw after I filled up on tacos. I didn't have smoked paprika so Isubstituted normal and used extra hot chile powder. I'll try it with the smoked parpika next time. I thought there was the perfect amount of rub, but way too much cream. I would suggest halfing the cream.

On an unseasonably warm spring day, I was looking for an easy recipe to make with a toddler running around the kitchen.

I didn't have smoked paprika but it still tasted incredible.

As most everyone else has said, this is really terrific, but down to practical matters: (1) it does not serve 6 -- more like 4, and (2) the slaw, sour cream and rub are about double the proportions needed for the tacos. Everyone loved it.

This recipe was okay. The rub was better on the veggies than the chicken. The sour cream added an interesting flavor to the tacos. The cole slaw was a waste by itself, although if you put it in the tacos, it was acceptable. I will make the rub again to grill veggies, but otherwise, I'll pass on the entire thing.

Rating: 4
I loved this recipe! It was super easy to make on a weeknight and tasted terrific. Smoked paprika is essential - if you don't have any, I suggest substituting half the amount of dried chipotle pepper powder instead of regular paprika since it will give you the smokey flavour that really makes this dish. The zucchini (surprisingly) goes really well with everything else. I think I'll cut the amounts in the spice rub by one- third next time since it made too much as written.

Rating: 4
I've made this recipe dozens of times and have made a few modifications over time. I use two red peppers and use an onion instead of zucchini. I don't put the oil in the slaw. Sometimes I mix roasted tomatillo salsa with the sour cream instead of the chipotle. This is one of our favorite week night meals.

GREAT recipe. I agree that the smoked paprika is a must. These tacos have such interesting flavor with the slaw and chipotle cream. Grilling is also a must.

This was an amazingly quick and delicious dinner. Definitely will have to make it part of our dinner rotation. I could prepare everything in advance, and simply grill off the chicken and vegetables at the last minute. So fast and easy - and incredibly healthy. Couldn't find the 3 color slaw mix at the store that day, so used just red cabbage and added shredded carrots to it. Also didn't have corn tortillas on hand, so used southwest flour tortillas. Wonderful texture and color in this meal, and great spice rub - with enough spiciness and touch of sweet. Excellent!!!

We are from Texas and live in Missouri now. I have used smokey paprika in a few different rubs and love it. I made this with Pork tenderloin and we loved it.

Just adding my accolades to this recipe; fantastic flavor and spice. I too used the honey lime dressing as suggested in a previous review and thought that was great with the cabbage. I think that the salsa verde recipe from Bon Appetit March 2003 is a great sauce to use with these tacos. Didn't use the zucchini but subbed thick sliced red onion for grilling and then separating for serving. A dish that is fast, easy and really yummy. Might try brining chicken next time as could use a bit more juiciness.

Awesome dish! Couldn't stop the raves from guests. All the elements - chkn, slaw, veggies -came together for a wonderful flavor. Used regular paprika & added more chkn since it seemed too little. Had a lot of the rub left over so will reduce next time. Roasted corn separately & added to mix. Also next time: make cream 1 day ahead to let flavors meld & will brine chkn for softer meat. Total keeper...

This was excellent! I made a few changes, substituted thick-sliced onions for the squash. Tossed them with thick slices of bell peppers in a little oil and the spice mix and cooked them wrapped in tinfoil on the grill. Marinated the whole chicken breasts the same way, with about a Tbsp. of lime juice added. The chipotle sauce was great! I made a test batch of the coleslaw since I'd never made it with oil before. My husband said at first he thought it tasted weird but after a few bites we agreed it was strange but delicious! I agree with the other reviewers who said to make all three parts of the recipe, the distinctive flavors were great together.

Well, I guess that the idea is to "spice rub" the chicken BEFORE grilling it? The recipe doesn't say anything about that. And for how long? This was a very confusing recipe considering that the quantity of rub mixture was way too much if not also rubbing it on the chicken before hand. And what about the slaw? If not for the pic., I'm not sure I would have put it on the chicken/veggie mix at serving time.

Rave reviews!! We didn't grill the chicken or veggies b/c it is 100 degrees in Texas. Instead, broiled the sliced veggies for 8 minutes. We cubed the chicken and then literally "breaded" each piece in the spice rub. I sautéed the chicken cubes over medium-high heat until fully cooked. Also, couldn't find the Spanish Paprika...and actually didn't have any Paprika at the house, so I left it out of the recipe completely and it was still FANTASTIC!

This was fantastic. Why go out for Mexican when you can make this, which is better than any restaurant! I love the chipotle flavored sour cream. Along with corn tortillas, this is a meal that gives you the south-of-the-border flavors you're craving. The chicken was perfectly spiced. I also like the fresh lime and slaw in the same meal with the cooked veggies. A well-rounded and healthy meal.

Muy Delicioso! What a good combination of flavors. I did everything on the grill, including warming the tortillas in tin foil.

I made this recipe as is for a group of 6 last night, and got rave reviews. I did follow the variation on the Spanish paprika (using regular paprika and cayenne), because I did not have smoked paprika. The recipe allowed for preparation of everything but grilling the veggies and meat ahead of time, which was great. It was certainly spicy, but the combination of ingredients and the slaw made it delicious.

I loved this, it's really a restaurant-quality dish. I used regular paprika and added some cayenne, also substituted onion for the zucchini, and added chile powder to the slaw. I added extra chipotle to the sour cream and it got a little too hot! I also used regular taco shells for half and flour tortillas for the other half. This is also a *very* easy recipe despite the multiple components. The spice mixture for the chicken is really good.

Made this last night. I used hot Hungarian paprika and dried chipotles instead of canned but otherwise I made it according to the recipe and it was fabulous. I'm not sure but I think the dried chipotles are stronger than the canned, so if you do the same thing, only use one instead of two. My mouth was burning and I like spicy food.

YUMMMMY! I made this recipe for a supper club and everyone loved it! I used vegetables instead of chicken and have since tried fish which is also delicious. I agree about adding more cilantro and lime juice to the slaw, but PLEASE do not add mayo instead of oil.

Really good--the only change I made was to use crema (a Mexican table cream, a little like creme fraiche), since I live way out in the country and was out of American sour cream. Crema is not as tart or as thick--but is lower in calories. With all the spices, I couldn't tell the difference.

I enjoyed making this recipe - found the corn tortillas too small to hold much - the 2nd time I made it I used large green tortillas - used regular paprika - just chipotle sauce

I really liked this recipe but only gave it 3 forks since I modified the slaw. After reading other reviews I increased the cilantro and lime and used mayo istead of oil (in eastern North Carolina slaw is always made with mayo !). I'll make this one again for sure.

Quite possibly the best taco recipe I've made, and I've made a few. I thought the slaw was excellent and the chipotle cream was fabulous on top. The only change I made was to leave out the zucchini - didn't have any.

Yum! I used fresh sage as suggested. I was pleasantly surprised by the interesting combination of flavors.

Four forks with a couple minor modifications. I used chipotle powder instead of paprika. I though zucchini was inappropriate for this dish; I used two red peppers instead. I used flour tortillas and added guacamole.

A big hit at our house. Nicely spicy for us. Did not have the smoked paprika, used half-sharp Hungarian that I had on hand. Will make again!

Best taco's ever!! Could not find the Spanish paprika, so I used a mix of reg. paprika and cayenne pepper. Can't wait to make this recipe again!!!

Best taco's ever!! I could not find the paprika that they had listed in the recipe. I used a little cayenne pepper instead. Otherwise followed the recipe as written. Can't wait to make this again!!!
