I grill asparagus using similar method routinely, but without all the skewering fuss, just make sure the stalks are perpendicular to the grill! and the spaces of the grill are small. A trick from Bobby Flay is to use a bit of mayo instead of the olive oil and a healthy dose of garlic. Toss, and grill. Comes out nicely flecked with char marks and wonderful garlic essence.

Grilled asparagus is delicious and easy. Use thicker stalks of asparagus as they grill easier and taste better. Toss with olive oil and salt (flour de del) before grilling. No need to use skewers, just clean and oil hot grill with vegetable oil before cooking. Place spears perpendicular to grill and roll with long tongs when turning half-way through cooking time (4 -6 minutes over medium direct grill).

I've been making this recipe for years. First, you have to LIKE the taste of grilling to like this recipe. Second, this is best on the grill - that's the whole point, right? Third, asparagus (to me) taste best when it still has a bit of a crunch and isn't completely killed. Be patient with threading, and try and find shorter flat skewers (@ Whole Foods) bc they work better. Hold the tips of the asparagus and bend; where it naturally snaps is the perfect separation of the tough from the tender parts. Then I toss in a plastic bag with EVO and balsamic. Then thread; grind a good quality S&P over them. Put on a plate and set next to the meat your man is about to grill - watch him ooh and ahh at what a cool idea it is, cook it, then rave about it! On a similar note, you can use this exact technique with any veggies you want to grill. Try thick slices of Vidalia onions (unseparated so they are still a solid disc) - to die for!

This is similar to my basic "go to" grilled asparagus recipe. However, once the asparagus "deadwood" is broken off, we use a sheet of heavy aluminum foil sprayed lightly with regular Pam. No skewers, no worries about veggies falling through grill. Then I drizzle the veggies with Meyers Lemon Olive Oil and a little sea salt and pepper. Grill to desired degree of crunchiness. Simple and delicious!

My favorite way, is to oven roast in a single layer 2 lb. asparagus tossed in oil, seasoned with ground sea salt and pepper at 450 maybe for 15 min. or little longer till they are a little on the crispy side. Cooked like this, my Husband forgives me any mishap with the rest of the meal.

To simplify the dinner, I par boiled the asparagus then used a grill pan to complete the grilling. The aparagus looke beautiful with distintive grill marks and a hearty flavor. I used my special Maine Sea Salt -you can really taste the difference when you use it. The presentation was great.

More on the skewering... there is a reason the recipe calls for 6" skewers. Thought this was a clever idea, soaked 'em per the recipe, but only had 8" skewers and unfortunately, threaded 5 (skinny) spring asparagus with room in between each. Oops. Wooden skewers caught on fire and we had to pull them off while continuing to grill asparagus. Lesson learned, skinny asparagus cooks very quickly, so thread closer together, leaving less exposed wood or ditch the skewers all together. We have grilled asparagus before, minus the skewers and it still tastes yummy. They are not difficult to grill if you place 'em perpendicular to the rack lines and have a few utensils. Go light on the olive oil (don't drench 'em) and definitely add a bit of lemon, either in a marinade or after the grilling. Have seen a number of grilling baskets out there. Wondering if any one has any suggestions?

Simple and delicious...but four forks seems a tad much for such a simple recipe! I parboil the asparagus in 1" of water for about three minutes, then plunge them into icy water to stop the cooking. This step enables me to shorten the grilling time, minimizing the risk the asparagus will char but still ensuring they are still tender. Also, I find that one skewer is sufficient to prevent the asparagus from falling thru the tines of the grill. Will make again!

I've made this recipe twice. I did as several reviewers suggested and added some balsamic vinegar to the marinade. I skipped the skewers and used a grill basket on the outdoor grill and the second time I put the asparagus directly on my indoor grill. The results were wonderful, crisp and perfectly cooked!

The family was skeptical when I requested a bit of the grill to make grilled asparagus but they all thought it was fantastic. I was very happy with it - next time I'm thinking of using lemon pepper instead of salt to try something new. Tip: Watch your tops, they get a bit crunchy, keep them in mind.

Forget about the skewers and invest ten dollars in a grill basket. I have used mine for years and it is the ONLY way to grill asparagus. Agree with other reviewers that nearly any oil based marinade will work. I also like to toss in some sesame seeds with the marinade for a little extra crunch. Try this recipe with other veggies as well. You will love the ease of the basket.

Easy, versatile and delicious! I often use left over oil/vinegar salad dressings (bottled or my own) as a marinades - fabulous with citrus dressings as well. Another variation is to zest lemon on top for presentation and taste. My guests love this side...as do I!

This has been one of the tastiest, easiest sides I've ever made and is a staple. When not firing up the grill, put on a baking sheet, spritz with a Misto and add your favourite spices...usually the salt and pepper are all we use but experimentation has yielded fine results as well. Nutritious, delicious!

I've made this both on the grill and in the oven. It's the only way I make asparagus now. I usually add lemon juice, and sometimes balsamic. On the grill, I only use one skewer, and have found that the metal ones work better on the really thin pieces. In the oven, I bake for 10 minutes at 450. I like the tops to just start to get crispy.

This is our new favorite way to cook asparagus! I have always like asparagus and cooked it steamed. My husband thought it was way to mushy and stringy. I tried grilling it after reading this recipe and he loved it. I usually add some balsamic vinegar and marinate it for about 30 min before grilling.

This was excellent, however, I did make a few changes. I added a clove of garlic (minced), used sea salt, and a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar to the oil then marinated the asparaus in the mixture for about 15 minutes. Grilled them on the BBW and it was delicious.

I am in love with this recipe! It is simple but tasty, allowing the freshness of the asparagus to come through. As suggested by others, I added a bit of balsamic vinegar to the mix, used sea salt, and marinated for 15 minutes prior to broiling. Two thumbs up! This recipe demonstrates that healthy food does not have to be tasteless food.

May seem strange to type a recipe here, but I saw this recipe and just wanted to add: I make grilled asparagus all the time. Many requests for it. If it's too cold, I just put under the broiler. Marinate a bunch of asparagus (after trimming) in olive oil, salt (or seasoned salt), pepper and balsamic vinegar - at least 30 minutes. (Or substitute what you have - red wine vinegar or lemon...) grill/broil until a bit charred. The key is to never overcook - vegetables should be crisp tender, not mushy!

The skewers are a great idea - they make a nice presentation when plating. Immediately off the grill, I sprinkled with feta, and drizzled with a balsamic syrup (3 c. balsamic, 1/2c. sugar, reduce until thickened to preference - make ahead and drizzle at room temp) Fantastic!

I never liked asparagus until a friend grilled them for me years ago. This is the best way I've found, and it's so tasty! It's rainy up here in the Pacific Northwest and we don't get to grill often, so I just drizzle the stalks with a good olive oil and a little salt and throw them on a foil lined cookie sheet into the oven around 400 - 450, until they look done, usually no more than 5-8 minutes. Cleanup is a snap this way, just serve them onto plates or a platter, throw away the foil and the cookie sheet is still clean and gets put away. So delicious, I think I'll make it again tonight.

I am not a big grill person, but I needed something to take to a vegetarian bbq last night, and this was perfect. It is so simple! I would suggest that this is only worth making if you can get good, thick asparagus. It is harder to thread them onto the skewers than one might think, but looks quite elegant when you are done. Watch them carefully as they cook, burning happens fast!

You're right, the skewers aren't necessary. I brushed with olive oil and sea salt, and then I grilled the asparagus on the top rack of a gas grill, placing them perpendicular to the grate. I didn't need to turn them, and it took only about 7 minutes. I then topped with a few drops of rosemary-laced balsamic vinegar (see "grilled red onions with balsamic vinegar and rosemary") and they were delicious!

We've grilled asparagus for a long time now - you don't need to use the skews, just place the asparagus directly on the grill the opposite direction of the grates so they won't fall through. It works just as well.

The directions for this recipie are tougher than necessary. Buy a grilling basket and forget about the skewers, or if you use skewers, you only need to do one side.
