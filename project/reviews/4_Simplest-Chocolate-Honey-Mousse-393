Simple, easy & tasty. It's a bit overwhelming how easy it was to make compared to other chocolate mousse recipes I've tried.

This is as simple and good as the previous reviews suggest. I used bittersweet chocolate from Trader Joes and I whipped all the cream and folded it in as others said in order to make it easier to prepare ahead. I often like larger portions than suggested in recipes and fortunately I didn't do it this time. I served it with farmer's market raspberries, but the chocolate and honey flavor is so strong I needn't have bothered except for rationalizing that it was somewhat healthy.

Perhaps because I'm just not a chocolate junkie this seemed SOOOO heavy to me. I do prefer the bittersweet chocolate, but it just seemed heavier than a mousse should be. My guests thoroughly enjoyed it, and even my husband ate it all - he's not a huge chocolate fan, either. I'll go back to my old flourless chocolate decadence cake when I need to make a chocolate dessert next time.

I MADE THIS DESSERT WITH QUALITY BITTERSWEET CHIPS. I CUT DOWN THE HONEY TO 4TS AS I PREFER THE CHOCOLATE TO STAND OUT. IT TASTES LUSCIOUS AND WAS SO EASY TO MAKE. I AM UNDECIDED WHETHER TO SERVE IT WITH MORE CREAM AND/OR RASPBERRIES AS IT IS ALREADY QUITE DECADENT!.

When I originally made this it was wayyyy too rich, and the honey flavor didn't come out enough. So the second time I made it, I added a little more honey (a dollop?), and then cut the chocolate by a third. Much better, not as rich. Used all of the cream, and it went over much much better with the crowd. If you're making it the night before, you may need to re-whip it before serving dinner.

Apparently overbeat the whipping cream as it didn't fold into the chocolate quite as easily as I would have thought. It was quite good and very easy, however. Be sure to serve coffee to help provide the foil to all the sweetness! Chocolate shavings on top would have been pretty too...

This is the absolute easiest & most delicious dessert. I've served this at several dinner parties in the last few months and everyone is always impressed... I don't tell them it look 10 minutes!

I was so excited to find a mousse recipe without refined sugar! The mousse was rich, but then again it wouldn't be mousse if it wasn't rich! The honey added a very subtle flavour and everyone loved it. It's the easiest and the best mousse recipe I've ever made!

I liked the texture of this mousse and sure, it was REALLY easy to make. Still I was disappointed. It lacked something (certainly not sweatness). I love chocolate mousse, but this just wasn't what I wanted.

THIS CHOCOLATE MOUSSE IS WONDERFUL! RICH AND DECADENT IT TASTES LIKE YOU SPENT HOURS ON IT, YET SO SIMPLE! I ALSO ADDED THE FULL 2.5 CUPS OF CREAM IN THE MOUSSE. IT WAS PERFECT. LESS CREAM MIGHT NOT IMPROVE IT. I WHIPPED EXTRA FOR A DOLLOP ON TOP. MY HUSBAND AND SON WILL BE FIGHTING OVER THE LAST SERVING TONIGHT!

Nearly a year later, and again, GREAT SUCCESS! we need to get this out to everyone who likes chocolate. This time my guests nearly licked the dishes clean. I cut pie pastry into leaf shapes and sprinkled with cinnamon/sugar to go along side. It is sooooo good!

This recipe is soooo easy to make, and it turned out so well for a party. I, like some of the others who have posted, did not separate that extra 1/4 whipping cream for a dollop on top; I just used it all for the mousse. If you want to make it a 4-fork recipe, make a raspberry sauce with fresh raspberries, chambord, and sugar, and then create a parfait!

This recipe is fantastic. It was so easy to make and turned out great! I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I put the chocolate mousse in martini glasses and added a small slice of green apple on the top of each serving.

I did this one on a short notice, it was very easy to handle, however I skipped on the last part of whipping the last quantity of the cream and instead used it all for the main whipping.

I made this as a dessert for an elegant New Year's Eve dinner and served it in wine glasses with a simple raspberry sauce. Everyone ooh'd and ahhh'd at the presentation and loved the dish. It was a dramatic presentation and soooo simple. I would definitely make this again.

This recipe was exquisitely simple and delicious. I served it with fresh raspberries, a raspberry sauce and a dollop of freshly whipped cream. My guests loved it and finished every bite.
