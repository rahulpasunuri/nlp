This chowder was delicious. Perfect on a cold or rainy day.

Made this exactly as the recipe except for the garnishes. I thought it was puttzy and that the flavor lacked depth. I even used homemade stock.

Somehow I ended up with what tasted like a third-rate split pea soup. Best thing about it was the garnishes. Made half the recipe for the family and was glad I hadn't made it for a crowd.

I made this last night, and I think it's warming and pretty yummy. A great alternative to Chili. The only thing I added was a few chipotle chilis cause they were on hand. I would will likely make it again

I am back to make this a second time, it was so yummy and comforting the first! My husband and soup-eating-son loved this soup, it was WONDERFUL with the pumpernickel toasts. I used 2 turkey legs(smoked) the last time, it came to just a pound under what the recipe called for. I can't believe someone was complaining about taking the meat off...by the time the soup was done, it literally fell off the bones!!! How hard can THAT be?

I wish those of you who do not use the ingredients listed would NOT rate recipes it is not a fair grade of how the recipe itself is! As printed it is a good winter soup.

I skipped the crouton topping (using Trader Joe's mini-rye toasts instead), and I thought the soup was so-so. It didn't seem that time-consuming until it came time to pick the meat off of four turkey drumsticks, which was surprisingly labor intensive. Also, I selected large drumsticks, and I think the ratio of meat to soup was too much. On the plus side, it does seem to be fairly healthy with all of those vegetables forming the base of the chowder.

While this chowder was a bit time consuming, it was an easy recipe. I like soup with a bit more substance, so after I pureed it, I added chopped carrots and diced onion that I cooked el dente. I also cooked the bacon extra crispy and added it into the soup.

So tasty. I used turkey thighs and thick pepper crusted bacon. It was great. I also made sure to cook the second cup of bacon extra crispy to add at the end with the crouton garnish.

Very yummy and hearty soup, full of good veggies. It was a bit time consuming, but not too bad. I could not find smoked turkey drumsticks and I don't like ham hocks, so I just substituted regular chicken drumsticks. Also, I added some frozen corn at the very end (after the pureeing) to add some sweetness and crunch. Delish. Will definitely add it to my list of great winter soups.
