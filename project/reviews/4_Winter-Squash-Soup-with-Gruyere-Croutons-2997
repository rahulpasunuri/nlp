I made a week before i was going to serve, but did not add the cream. Added that the day of serving. I was slightly disappointed in the color - rather pale. The croutons dressed it up nicely. Guests liked it.

Excellent soup. I love the squash combo of butternut and acorn. I peeled the squash, but will roast it next time as it was a pain in the a**. And I agree that you should halve or quarter the baguette slices. I did use the sugar, but the soup would be just as good, I'm sure, without it. I also agree that you should use the fresh herbs, not dry herbs. Don't skimp on that.

I cook a lot of great things, and this soup has definitely qualified as a keeper. I had a couple of techniques that made the raw squash not so bad to peel (Google it and/or use common sense), and I thought it might possibly taste better to actually cook the squash with the herbs rather than roast is seperately. I'd suggest only making this soup if you use the fresh herbs, there's just no comparison to dried thyme and sage. I was actually led here by a variation tha included 1.5 teaspoons of ground cumin and 0.5 teaspoon of dried ginger. I used freshly ground cumin and 1 teaspoon of freshly grated ginger instead. Made the croutons with romano and the herbs since I didn't feel like buying gruyere, and the croutons really add some very worthwhile savoriness, though you could eat the soup quite happily without them. Last thing, I never sautee garlic for 10 minutes. I did the onions maybe for 7 and then added garlic for 3-4 more. For goodness' sake don't burn the garlic and make it bitter. Oh, I used homemade veggie stock rather than chicken, I don't know why to use chicken for a vegetarian recipe except maybe the veggie broth is harder to find. Cheers!

I Just made this soup for an early Thanksgiving feast...it's velvety texture, the sage and thyme flavoring and the delicious Croutons make this a keeper. Have made this soup many times before, but it seems to taste better every time I make it! Save yourself the hassle and roast the squash!

I meant to add that I didn't peel the squash, just used a heavy duty knife and sliced off the outer skin (sacrificing some of the squash) ended up with little more than 1.5 lb of each. I also used "Better than Bouillion" for the stock (always adds a wonderful richness). Skipped the sugar, and used a hand blender (emulsion?) in the same pot. Croutons were hard to eat whole, may want to quarter them after they cool a little then add. Great flavor!

Loved this soup! The squash is easy - don't peel it. Poke a few holes and microwave it on high for 2 minutes. That makes it so easy to cut in half. Scoop out the seeds, add olive oil, salt and pepper and roast it. The just scoop out the softened insides for the soup. So easy! So delicious!

This soup is terrific! The only thing I didn't do was the extra sugar and the croutons. I will say though what a pain in the tush to peel the acorn squash!

Rating: 4
Loved this soup, but thought it was a little too chickeny. Next time I'll probably use half chicken stock, and half vegetable. I also used more squash than was called for (about 2lbs of each), and next time I'd probably increase the butternut squash by even more. With the croutons, this is decadent. Lose them, and the cream, and sub olive oil for butter, and you've got a healthy meal.

I prepared this exactly as directed and served it at a luncheon and received rave reviews. I'm making it tonight for my family and will try roasting the squash this time as mentioned by many others. I'm not a huge fan of squash but this is quickly becoming one of my new favorites.

This is an excellent soup. I served it with an organic baby greens salad. Followed recipe with one minor change. I used half large white onion and one small shallot instead of one large onion. My daughter, who doesn't like squash, loved it. My husband and son also enjoyed it very much. I definitely will make this again.

This is the first epicurious recipe I'll ever review even though I've been using the site for a while. Its just everything a winter soup should be... comforting and thick, it heats up your insides. It is elegant enough that my family has requested it for the past two Christmases for guests, but easy enough to make that we'll reheat it for week night dinners until the whole big bowl is gone. Quite important though is that I only made it with acorn squash once. Have you ever tried to peel an acorn squash? Forget it! Using whole fresh butternut squash makes a huge difference. Yes, this does require time and a work out, but I've made it twice with pre-cut squash and it just plain wasn't as good. The same goes for the spices... spring for the fresh ones. Also, the gruyere croutons are nice, but not necessary. Serve it with a hunk of a white boule and everyone will be happy! PS. Having a hand blender really helps.

Fabulous and easy. I added a diced pear to the cooking and also drizzled soup with Maple Syrup!! Outstanding!

This soup was delicious but I REALLY doctored it up! First I roasted the butternut squash with a little olive oil, salt & pepper and the acorn squash with salt & pepper and a little maple syrup. To punch up the flavor of the soup I added some nutmeg, apple cider vinegar and curry powder. I also used an immersion blender which makes it so much easier to adjust the seasonings a little at a time.

I'll try to be kind, but I must admit I am utterly baffled at the mostly positive 375 reviews of this recipe. I truly don't get it. I find this recipe to be bland, dull, and certainly not worthy of dinner guests. I followed the recipe as written with one exception -- I roasted the squash instead of boiling. It has no depth of flavor. The Gruyere and the croutons make for some interest, but only as a means of finishing the bowl of soup. Somewhere I have packed away Gunter Seeger's recipe for a similar soup. As I recall it had a baked apple placed in the soup plate. The Epicurious recipe needs something--a reduction of apple cider, white wine, maybe, a little nutmeg. It needs something to deepen the flavor. Sorry, I really wanted to like this soup, but that didn't happen.

"Perfect," according to my husband, and I agree. Used only butternut squash and dried herbs, but found fresh sage under the snow and fried it to use as a topping instead of croutons. A superb soup!

Love, love, love this soup, and I'm not even a big squash fan. I roasted 1 acorn and 1 butternut squash a day ahead. I used a medium onion and 1/2 of a vidalia sweet onion and cooked that along with the garlic in 2 tbsp of butter and a tbsp of olive oil. I used Better Than Bullion low sodium chicken base instead of chicken broth. I used only thyme because the store was out of sage. Because the onion was already sweet, I didn't need to add any sugar. The soup was so easy to make and so tasty that I will definitely be making this a lot.

So yummy and easy. I made this for christmas dinner and everyone loved it! I roasted the squash and used maple syrup instead of sugar...delicious! I also used light cream for a "little" healthier twist.

It was excellent! As others suggested, I baked the squash rather than peeling and boiling. I cut the squash into large pieces and placed them in a roasting pan with 1/4 inch of water; covered it with foil and baked 20 to 30 minutes in a 400 degree oven. Note: adding oil roasts rather than bakes the squash and changes the flavor as well as adding fat. Also, I suggest adding the stock slowly, so you don't add too much and thin it out. I used 32 oz. of stock.

I made this as a light side for my family's thanksgiving dinner. It was the hit of the meal. Everyone commented on how much they enjoyed it. If you like winter squash and soup give this one a try!

Rating: 3
Simple, healthy and delicious for a winter night meal. Don't skip the whipping cream and sugar at the end. The soup will taste flat without the creaminess, and the sugar (try brown sugar) brings out the natural sweetness of the squash. These two ingredients make the flavor pop! Like other reviewers, I'd also recommend baking the squash first with olive oil, salt & pepper (I did 350 degrees for 30-40 min). This made the entire process very simple. The flesh came right off and there's no need to add more salt & pepper later on. I did not have fresh thyme or sage, nor herbs de provence, so I used Italian seasoning instead. It still tasted wonderful. I will have to try fresh herbs next time. While waiting for the squash to bake, I washed the seeds and mixed them with a drizzle of olive oil, sprinkled sea salt on top and put it in the oven with the squash. After 5-10 min it's a tasty salty snack. Both made the house smell wonderful! This is a good, solid recipe. I plan on making it again and adding some twists (I found a recipe with a five- spice creme fraiche and candied ginger topping).

Great recipe. I had 2 butternut and 1 acorn. I roasted like other reviewers and added a new york region apple (especially good and sugary this year!). I didn't make the croutons, but make kale chips for dipping (that was in my fridge). HUGE HIT with friends! If I make it with croutons I think I'll use smoked gruyere suggested by another reviewer. I may keep with the simple dipping kale chip and sprinkle gruyere.

I served this soup at the centerpiece of a lunch, with additional nibbles. It's thick and rich enough to anchor a meal. My friends thought it was delicious, but I thought it could use a little more flavor. I'm not sure what I would add, but it seemed slightly flat to me. I used a dollop of non-fat yogurt instead of cream, so that might be the problem. I also roasted the squash at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes, until it was easy to peel off the skin and cut up the meat.

Like others I roasted the squash first to ease the peeling. I used all butternut squash, brushed with olive oil, sprinkled with salt, pepper and provincale herbs before baking for 45 min. Wonderful soup, but thought it could use a little more spice so added a bit of cyanne pepper at the end.

I followed the other cooks' suggestions of using delicta squash instead of acorn, roasting the squash and garlic with olive oil, adding herbs de provence instead of thyme or sage (I'd add a little more than 1.5 tsp next time) and adding a peeled sliced honeycrisp apple to the onions instead of sugar. I'm vegan, so I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth 2 TBSP olive oil on the squash, dry sauteed the onions and did not add butter or cream. Both my non-vegan husband and loved it.

This is so easy and so good. I too, roasted the squash in the oven first with a bit of olive oil and good sea salt. After it cooled, I spooned it into the butter, onions and garlic.

My local WHOLE FOODS was featuring this exact recipe last weekend and I took a recipe card and went home and made it again. The only difference is that they had 3 cups of Acorn Squash, 3 cups Butternut squash and 3 cups Delicata Squash, all peeled and cubed, tossed with Olive Oil and sea salt and fresh ground pepper, then roasted in a 400 degree oven for 20 minutes. Also they used Herbs de Provence instead of Thyme and Sage. Otherwise identical. It was DELICIOUS! I will make this again and again. Worth it to make homemade chicken stock.

I used one big butternut squash and two sweet potatoes. I was serving vegetarians so I used water instead of stock. Instead of fresh herbs, I used one tsp each of sage and thyme, dried. Finally, I topped the soup with shaved parmesan. I guess my point is that this soup was fantastic even with all the changes. I would have given it four forks if I hadn't completely changed the recipe.

Rating: 4
I used all acorn squash and no butternut since that's what I had. It was fantastic. Since it's so much easier to peel winter squash if you roast it first, that's what I did instead of cooking it for 20 minutes in the simmering broth. The texture when pureed still seemed perfect. I also substituted light cream for heaving since that's what I had, and used a tablespoon of maple syrup instead of sugar, but the natural sweetness of the acorn squash hardly needed it. I didn't even make the croutons, but I did throw just a bit of leftover bleu cheese into the soup. Finally, I topped with toasted pecans for garnish. My husband I both loved it.

well.....i really wanted to like this recipe. i am cooking in advance for an interview to be a personal chef, and i wanted to start them out with this since it is fall. hmm....i needed a lot of extras.....at least a half cup of good apple cider, some white pepper, a quarter cup of sherry, and a bit more sugar was in order. i assume that the flavors will meld better overnight......but i must say...it is good with all of the additons. i also chopped a granny smith apple into a very small dice and added it after the puree....excellent.

This soup does not disappoint! Taste is great, smooth and gentle, texture is velvety (I use a hand blender to save time and dishes), color is fun, and it's fancy enough to go with Thanksgiving dinner or for a casual soup and sandwiches night. Even both of my kids love it. BTW, I haven't made the croutons, I'm sure they're a great touch but haven't had the time. Don't skimp on the fresh herbs, they really add a wonderful subtlety to the dish. Allow time to peel and cut up the squash, I've got it down to 15 mins, wish I could go faster. Sometimes I cut some of the butter with olive oil for health reasons, still delicious. I have made this soup again and again and will continue to do so.

Made this on a meatless Friday and it was delicious. Made it according to recipe except my Cuisinart is broken so I used a "boat motor" to puree right in the pot. It worked great and one less thing to wash. Am making it again this week for a midweek meal (just have to get the squash ready beforehand).

I made this soup and croutons as a main course and even my husband the carnivore was satisfied! Truly phenomenal use of seasonal squash. My only change was to put down a large fuji apple with the onions and omit the sugar, and replace the gruyere with smoked gruyere. The smokiness really added some depth. Make it tonight!

My boyfriend and I both love this soup - simple and delicious! (And he only appreciates meals that include "meat.") I add an apple during the simmering process, which does indeed add a little more flavor dimension. I added cream for the first time this batch (usually I only keep milk in the fridge), and it seemed a little heavy to me. Also, I know this isn't in keeping with the idea behind the recipe, but if you don't want to bother with the croutons, or you're having it as leftovers, swiss/gruyere/manchego grilled cheese sandwiches make a perfect meal.

This was my first attempt at homemade butternut squash soup and it didn't disappoint! I found the pre-cut squash at Trader Joe's, which was a major timesaver! I thought that the soup needed more garlic, herbs and S&P than the recipe called for to really make the flavor pop, maybe 6 garlic cloves and double the rest. The croutons were heavenly and I might make extras the next time I make this dish.

This soup was a very nice winter dinner. I cut out the butter and instead of whip cream at the end, I used low fat yoghurt that I drained through a coffee filter. The yoghurt added a nice tang;next time I will add a bit of cumin, and that will go really nicely with the yoghurt.

Great recipe. A trick for dealing with any unwieldy vegetable. Wash it, prick it in a few places with a knife and then put it in the microwave for about 3 minutes or until the skin softens a bit. You can then peel and cube it or cut it in half to roast - Much easier and quicker to deal with.

It was pretty good and the croutons were fantastic. Next time, I would leave out the sugar (too sweet for my taste) and use a little unsweetened apple sauce in its place.

This is a GREAT butternut squash soup recipe (this said after researching and trying many). I use this as my starter for any butternut squash soup and will sometimes add cinnamon, maple syrup, or chopped caramelized pears in at the end.

This was the most amazing soup I've ever made! I used only butternut squash, and vegetarian soup stock, and after reading the review about adding the apple concentrate, I threw in a whole apple (cut in half and cored) into the stock. Wow... it added a whole other dimension of flavor. I just discarded it before pureeing. I added a splash of half and half at the end. The croutons were incredibly delicious with the soup, and I made some extra to serve on the side. I've never been inspired to review a recipe before, and I do cook a lot of soups, but this one is really special.

Rating: 3
Yum! I made the recipe as it was written except that I went with the suggestion to roast the squash. I think this technique reduced the amount of work and enhanced the flavor. The croutons were worth making and next time I will probably try adding apple just to see how it changes the flavor. My hubby and I loved it and it would be a great starter for a dinner party.

Rating: 3
A delicious soup as all have said and the croutons are very, very nice. Next time I will definitely buy some pre-cubed (and peeled) squash as it was NO FUN AT ALL breaking whole butternut and acorn squash down. With more time I might roast them as others have done. I wouldn't worry about the cream, it's only 1/4 cup in probably a gallon of soup!

Great recipe! We've made this twice. Both times we used only Butternut Squash and it was wonderful. We doubled it for a party and it yielded 5.5 quarts before we added the cream (we froze it ahead of time without the cream). Croutons are great as well. We used whatever cheese we had on hand and they were still so good they were memorable! It is a bit of work, though. We roasted the squash ahead of time to make it easy to cut and the chopping and pureeing take time, but it is worth it.

Yummmmm!! I was wondering what to do with the winter squash I've been getting in my CSA box, and I'm so glad I made this. I used veggie broth instead of chicken broth, and dried thyme and sage cause that's all I've got, but otherwise I followed it exactly. So. Good. Yum!

This soup is SO good and SO easy to make. I followed the recipe almost exactly and it's truly wonderful. It's also a great color! The only changes I made were in the amount of cream - reduced it to just a couple of tablespoons - and less butter. It was very good and next time I may not add any cream at all (didn't need it after I used my immersion blender). The croutons were like the icing on the cake - an added bonus to create a crunchy texture and additional taste complexity. Besides tasting great, it's a healthy soup. I may use it at Thanksgiving instead of appetizers before dinner: just hand everyone a small mug of this with bread cube croutons.

Rating: 3
Very good base to start with - fabulous with a few tweaks. As others have said, the cream is unnecessary but since I had a bit of FF Half&Half in the house I spashed in a bit and it was a nice addition. I also added a bit of freshly shaved nutmeg at the end as well as some apple juice concentrate for the apple/tart flavor. The apple was a HUGE improvement so next time I'll add fresh apple to the simmering pot.

Made this for friends the other night. I added a couple slices of smoked pepper bacon and part of an apple to the onions, which gave it a lot of flavor. Actually, I could have added more apple, I think; I ended up using some sugar, but no cream -- it's plenty creamy once you puree it. Everyone thought it was great. Next time I'll try it without the bacon.

One word: DELICIOUS!!! No need to add the cream as the squash already has a creamy texture, but I did try it both ways. I will likely not use the cream in the future simply for the healthy factor. I followed the recipe to a T and it turned out fantastic. YOU MUST MAKE THE CROUTONS!! They add a salty and crunchiness that just can't be missed.

Very good for a squash soup(not a huge squash fan). I made a couple slight changes as I orginally found it kinda bland: I cooked 3/4 of a pound of pancetta in the pan and put a little butter in and added the unions and garlic along with 1 sliced apple. In the end when blending I also added(or infused to sound fancy) some goat cheese into it which definetly complmented it and wasn't over powering. Overall the best squash soup I have found.

Rating: 3
This is a solid recipe! I've made it several times with rave reviews. I found the sage to be a tad bit overpowering so I cut back on that. (I replaced the sage with fresh basil and it works just fine too.) You don't need any sugar if you have good squash and the cream is yummy but unnecessary (Mexican crema works well too in place of cream). Also, splurge a little on the gruyere-- it makes all the difference in the world. The second time I made this, I was in a bit of a rush and made the gruyere croutons "garlic bread style" and they were lovely. I cut the baguettes lengthwise, and put the butter, cheese, and herbs right on top and broiled it. This was an excellent alternate version although I plan on making the croutons next time if time permits.

Yummmms! This is OMG good. Bought a BN squash at the farmers market the other day because it's in season and decided that I wanted to use a recipe that honored the seasonal flavor of the squash itself. Man, did this recipe deliver! I didn't use sugar and really just eyeballed the measurements and I'm still licking the bowl as I type this (no joke). Next time I'll do the croutons, but today I had to feed a finicky friend with "acceptable cheese" issues. Make this. Then make it again and again! ^_^

This is a great basic recips that can be modified to suit the ingredients you have and those you lack. It makes a huge crock of soup. I used about a half cup of brown sugar and omitted the cream and it was excellent. Garnishign with green apples would be nice too, if I'd had any on hand.

it is a really exceptional soup. I made the following adjustments: 1) Added two chopped small McIntosh apples in with the onions for sweetness 2) Replaced the chicken stock with a combination of vegetable stock, white wine, and water 3) Deleted the cream and sugar...both are not necessary Can't wait to serve it tonight for my husband's birthday dinner.

Hands down, this is probably one of my favorite soup recipes! Within my garden, several different types of squash grow and I am always looking for another unique recipes where I can use the squash.

This Soup is fantastic. If you are going to take the time to make this soup I highly recommend using as many organic ingredients as you can get. I am amazed with the flavor acquired with the ingredients. Make sure when you are blending the soup to hold the lid of the blender with all the force you can muster and then some. For whatever reason the boiling hot squash is likely to explode out your blender and into your face, so be aware! This recipe is going to be a favorite!

What a lovely, and easy, soup. Everyone liked it. I did not make the croutons, instead, I served it a la french onion soup. I ladled the soup into crocks and layered each with a slice of baguette and the gruyere over it, then melted them under the broiler until the cheese was slightly bronzed.

Mmm delicious, body-warming soup for those chilly evenings. The biggest time-suck here was chopping up the squash (half an hour, at least) - I used a pumpkin and a butternut squash.

For quite some time I have been making a roasted butternut squash soup that was a hybrid of different recipes. I thought it was pretty good, but my bubble was burst when my husband recently told me it was merely okay. So tonight I decided to try a different recipe, and gave this one a shot. It actually was a vast improvement over my other soup, which I thought was pretty good to begin with. I made a few changes, though. I used only butternut squash, used fat free half and half instead of whipping cream and did not use fresh thyme since I didn't have any on hand. I also didn't make the gruyere croutons but instead topped the soup with walnuts and blue cheese. It really was delicious. I should add that I normally roast the squash when I make butternut squash soup but didn't this time. While it was hard to peel and cube the squash, I find it equally hard to slice the whole squash in half for roasting. Plus you have an extra dish to clean, so I don't really think it is all that much extra work just to peel and cube it.

Best butternut squash soup I've made, and the croutons and a nice crunch to a smooth soup. Add a salad and an apple crisp for a delicious winter meal.

I made this recipe as the first course of a french-themed New Years Eve dinner and it was well received. I topped with lardons and toasted hazelnut crumbs instead of the crouton, and people loved the flavors. I didn't use the full amount of broth - just over 2 cans - and it had a creamy wintery consistency that seemed just right. I am able to find the squash pre-cut in my grocery store which cuts down drastically on the work involved to make this. I will definitely make it again.

We started preparing this soup in 1996 when the recipe was first published. It has been a staple of any winter feast since, and an absolute MUST for Christmas dinner. I love telling friends that I am making squash soup...it could be a whole segment on a reality TV show... watching their faces go from scrunching up like a 2-year-old who doesn't want to eat their veggies... to the inevitable response of, "May I have some more please?" and/or "May I have the recipe?". I do have three hints for you... #1) Dont skip the croutons! While the soup can absolutely stand on its own merits, the croutons take it to an entirely different level. #2)Yes, the squash is difficult to cut up... simply call the grocery store before you arrive and ask them to have it peeled and cut into one inch cubes for you, (then you don't have the hassle of cutting it up AND you aren't paying per pound for the skins and seeds you are most likely going to throw away) and finally #3) encourage your guests to lightly salt/pepper the soup in their own bowl when it is served, a tiny bit of salt brings out the sweetness and distinct flavors. Enjoy this one... it is a keeper (and you can ask my 16 year old son, who just loves this soup)!

I made this soup for Christmas dinner and it was excellent. I sauteed the seeds and scrapings from the squash in the 1/2 stick of butter (I read somewhere that this brings out a deeper squash flavor), fished out the scrapings and added a couple of extra tbsp. of butter back to the pot. I also used my own homemade chicken broth. This soup was silky and delicious and everyone loved the crouton. Very easy with great results. I will make this often.

I roasted the squash for ease.I would obmit the garlic.I felt it overpowered the squash flavor. I added curry powder and a bit of cayenne pepper to give it a bit of heat. I added fried sage and croutons. Croutons were a nice touch.

I know, I know. I hate it when people change the recipe too, but I tossed in two leeks, a shallot, and a can of cannelli beans and it was great. Used just 1T of butter too. Forgot the sugar. Easy, healthy and will be making it again. I thought roasted garlic would have been a good addition too.

I took this lovely soup in a different direction by adding light coconut milk, cumin, curry and cayenne. It is so very tasty. The fragrance is divine on this snowy day in the North country. I will definately make this again.

Just made this for the second time. Roasted the squash first (my 3lb butternut squash just barely filled 4 cups) as suggested. Added some curry powder and cumin at the end, too, because the soup felt like it needed a little something extra. Delicious!!

This is a wonderful soup. When I make it next time I will follow some others suggestions to roast the squash and scoop out the contents, rather than undertaking the laborious task peeling and cutting the squash. Three pounds of butternut squash only made cups, so buy a bit more. Other than this, make as written and enjoy.

This soup was tasty, but not a 'four fork' recipe in my opinion. Seemed to be missing something, but I can't put my finger on what. I will make it again and fiddle with it a little bit - good for a wintery night!

4 forks, delicious! I added 1/2 a sweet potato since I had one left in the fridge, roasted the squash as recommended by other cooks and used 1/2 the amount of butter and substituted olive oil instead. Otherwise, I followed the recipe pretty closely. It was delicious. I will make it again. I already had a request to make it again this week. Yummy.

Fantastic recipe! I also roasted the squash beforehand and used rosemary instead of thyme. For extra flavor, increase the amount of herbs and add a little salt and pepper. With these additions, the whipping cream is not a necessity, but it does add some delicious richness.

I have been making this recipe for years. I find that without chix stock it is a little less rounded in flavor - but have many veggies in my life - so I compromise. I change it a little - add an apple with the squash, add a little cinnamon and today I put a little chopped fresh ginger. It gave it a zing! A great soup for a fall day...will be making this for years!

This is one of the best soups I've ever made! I roasted the squash before adding it to the broth (easier to get it OUT of its shell!) Also used a new immersion blender to mix it all up in the pot without having to transfer everything to a food processor. No changes in ingredients; made 4 good-sized servings. I can recommend this highly!

Rating: 4
This is a fantastic recipe. I followed the directions nearly exactly, save for roasting the squash (squash halved, cut sides down with a little olive oil at 350 for one hour) prior to adding it to the onion, garlic, broth, and herb mixture. While I'm sure the others' suggestions for adding different spices or cheese, omitting one thing and replacing it with something else make for a great soup, too, the winter squash soup per the recipe at hand came out absolutely wonderfully.

Rating: 4
I made a few subs/changes but the guidelines here create a beautiful winter soup with lots of room for improv! There was a vegetarian in our midst so I used water instead of broth, adding more throughout for consistency (prob ~4-5 cups). I used butternut squash only, omitted thyme and sage, added about 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and salt & pepper to taste & a healthy amount of parmigiano reggiano; I used a little less than 2tsps. brown sugar for the sugar. It turned out more savory than sweet, a little spicy from the pepper and my four guests raved! One of the omnivores even asked if there was chicken stock in it. I'll definitely use the base and proportions again for more hearty winter soups.

Rating: 4
Roasted the squash as everyone suggested; I ended up using about twice as much butternut squash as the recipe asked for, but I like my soup thick. Added a pinch of curry and nutmeg and added 1 tsp of cinnamon - next time I'll try less cinnamon, because the soup ended up a bit sweet for my taste. Also added a splash of sherry. It needs lots of salt, too. But overall, delicious!!!

I made this soup for the first course at Thanksgiving dinner and it was a hit. I used acorn and butternut squash. Incorporating the suggestion of other reviewers, the night before Thanksgiving I cut the squash lengthwise in half, scooped out the seeds and roasted them at 350 degrees F for an hour on a foil-lined baking sheet coated with olive oil. Then I finished the soup the morning of Thanksgiving. I had read a comment suggesting the soup was too thin, so I started with a quart of the chicken broth, then once the squash and broth were pureed, added more broth to the pot to bring the soup to the consistency I wanted. I also used a light touch on the garlic and the herbs, and found the soup needed a little salt. The croutons were the crown jewel and were quick and easy -- important when you've got the rest of the Thanksgiving three- ring circus meal prep going on. The soup tastes rich and elegant but is deceptively simple to make. And it was healthier than most of the other dishes I served, too; the quarter cup each of butter and cream were split among 10 people.

WOW! I read other reviews and decided to go the roasted squash route with the cinnamon and nutmeg. I put the onions directly into the stock and skipped the butter. It lacked a little depth without it, so I added just under 1/4 tsp black truffle oil. It really took the soup to the next level. I can't wait to serve it to guests at Thanksgiving tomorrow.

I found this a bit thin & somewhat heavy on the garlic/onion; the squash had to fight a bit to get out when it should have been center stage. I had 1/2 of a roasted butternut squash left over & added it along w/ some salt and pepper which improved the taste nicely.

This soup is smooth, flavorful, sweet but not too sweet. Butternut squash soup is usually one of those soups where just a small portion will do, but this one makes you want more! The croutons are great. If you're reheating it day 2 and don't want to bother with the broiler, grate the gruyere right into the soup and enjoy the soup with a piece of good bread on the side. This recipe is a keeper.

We really liked this. I roasted a small butternut and medium acorn squash. Scooped out the seeds, baked face down at 350 on lightly olive-oiled tin foil lined pan for about an hour. Scooped out squash into pot. Added a pinch of curry and nutmeg, about a tsp of cinammon, and about 1/4 cup of sherry. I think I'd increase the nutmeg to about 1/4 tsp. and cinammon to 1- 1/2 to 2 tsp. next time. Croutons were also good, I used a whole grain baguette.

All in all an excellent dish. Made 3 batches and served to our ladies Circle. Personally, I found the consistency too thick, but didn't have time to adjust as my guests arrived on time. Received many, many compliments.

I took this soup to a Fall Festival dinner for my church and everyone raved about it. Like most reviewers suggested I too roasted the squash first and then scooped the flesh and added that to the pot with the garlic, onion, and herbs. I used half chicken broth, half vegetable broth and I added a couple of shallots to the onion and garlic mixture. I followed the recipe to a T with everything else and the croutons elevated the soup. I will be making this again and again it was that good and by the way not a drop of the soup was leftover!!!

I also roasted the squash, along with some leeks, small onions, and several garlic cloves. I then mashed up the garlic and onions with some olive oil to make a paste that I added to the fresh onion after it was sauteed a bit. The croutons were made with a a local cheese called Tarentaise, with extra cheese sprinkled on top!

OK, Sorry for the skewed rating guys but I roasted the squashes beforehand, too (about an hour, 350 degrees). Otherwise, I followed the recipe pretty closely. This got unbelievable reviews. Everyone had glazed eyes and full tummies.

A Cook from Durham, NC on 09/21/07 This is the best soup I've ever made. The croutons are amazing and should not be skipped. As the comments recommended, I cut the squashes in half and roasted for 1 hour on 350 degrees. When cooking the onions, I waited until the very end to add the garlic to avoid burning. I also didn't add the fresh herbs until before pureeing so they wouldn't lose their flavor.

Absolutely delish! I made this for a group of colleagues for our "soup lunch bunch" and it was definitely a hit. I took others' advice and roasted squash first on my silpat for 1 hr at 350. After it cooled, I did simmer the pulp with the broth and cooked onions, but only for 10 min. I also added a peeled & chopped apple to the initial onions. I used half & half instead of cream, but doubled the amount to increase creamy texture but not as many calories. I went a little heavy on the herbs, so I doubled the brown sugar & added a little fresh nutmeg. The croutons are amazing, and people used them as "dippers." Yum!

I experimented with this soup, and it tasted bland. Could be the broth we used and the nixing of the sugar (forgot to add it). Oh, and we didn't make the croutons. Added curry power, balsamic vinegar and kern oil to try to spice it up.

I first made this one for Thanksgiving 2004- but didn't realize it until I went in to file after making it again for "French" Christmas Eve 2006. It was a hit both times. It does take time to peel the squash, especially the acorn - but it's worth the effort. Agree with all who say the croutons are a must!

Rating: 4
This soup makes a wonderful winter meal. Roasting the squash not only increases flavor, but avoids the risk of losing fingers in attempts to dice raw squash. The baguette slices seem too large to be called "croutons", so I've dubbed mine "crostini" and garnish each plate with several for dipping.

I LOVE this soup. As others suggested, I baked the squash before adding to soup; (350 for 1 hr - cut side down and then flip). I don't know how it would have worked without doing so (squash are HARD). I skipped the cream and sugar as it already had a nice rich flavor. Highly recommend!

Rating: 4
This is a wonderful soup that leaves a long and buttery finish (like a very good wine)! I did roast the squash at 350 for 1 hour but I still simmered the scooped out flesh for 20 min. I did not have thyme or sage. I did not need the sugar or the whipping cream as it was already sweet and creamy. I believe all the flavor came from just roasting the squash until it was very soft and carmelized on the bottom! Cant wait to serve this tomorrow at Thanksgiving Dinner!

Rating: 4
Finally, a squash soup that pleases everyone, even people who don't typically enjoy this type of fare. The flavors balanced wonderfully. If you don't want to do the Gruyere croutons, simply put a dollop of sour cream or creme fraiche on top with a sage leaf.

I did a test run this weekend intending to bring this to my boyfriend's family Thanksgiving dinner. I followed the recipe exactly, and we both agreed it was a bit bland. Is squash just bland?? "It needs something" was our overall thought. However, I loved the texture and also the croutons. I added maple syrup, cayenne pepper, and a lot of salt and pepper. To my liking, this improved the soup a great deal as the sweetness and the delicate kick from the pepper added nice depth.

OK. Start with a heavy dutch oven. Then rinse the squash, and section it. Depending on the squash either 4ths or more... Halve the butter that you cook the onion and garlic in... Then you spoon seeds and pulp and add that to the onions and garlic at the tail end of their being cooked. You then proceed to cook for about 5 more minutes - add broth and steam squash (market bought $3.00 stailess steamer) pieces over seeds, onions, garlic and 1.5 cups of water. Do this for 25 minutes. Remove squash and cool. Sieve seeds, onions ets. Chop 1/4 large onion to same consitency as directed and add to dutch oven with remaining butter. Cook for 10 minutes, add required broth (vegetable worked very well) scoop out cooled squash discard skins and add liquid from first step. Add herbs a touch of sugar and cream (less than called for) and puree with hand blender. Amazing - laughably so... I'm telling you - the steaming of the squash over the salvaged seeds and pulp really round out the soup. You barely need any IF any sugar or cream. I will try it without next time. Huge hit and I am a soup maker... I know soup. :)

This was easy to make for dinner with roasted chicken and green salad one evening. Used vegetable broth and half and half instead of chick broth/cream. It wasn't exceptional (might have been my cheap squash) but very easy to make, VERY nice with the gruyere.

Delicious! I made this with canola oil rather than butter, Better Than Bouillon vegetable stock instead of chicken broth, and about 1 tsp. of dried herbes de Provence in place of the fresh herbs. I also left out the cream and sugar, and didn't make the croutons (I will next time, but didn't have the ingredients on hand today). The soup came out really flavorful, smooth, and delicious. Highly recommended. Also, a tip for easier squash preparation -- winter squashes are so hard to chop up, so I halve them lengthwise and seed them, and bake them cut-side down on a pan with some oil until a fork can pierce through the skin. Then I take them out, cool, and chop, and add to the soup. Much easier for me than wrestling with them raw.

I made this for my major food snob friends at our annual pumpkin carving party and within minutes there was not a single drop left in the tureen.

I probably should have roasted the squash, it was quite a feat to peel and cube-- I used a serrated knife to cut the butternut and the acorn in half, then microwaved them both for a few minutes. Otherwise- it was good-- really easy and quick to make, considering I had never handled squash before.... I used half and half instead of cream-- and skipped the sage and thyme on the crostini because I'm lazy--- but it was cozy and delicious--- served with rosemary garlic roasted chicken and big green salad. Seems like a recipe you can't mess up.

I'm not big into squash of any kind, but we got a butternut and an acorn in our CSA delivery, and, boy! I have been converted! This was relatively easy (I, too, roasted the acorn, 'cause how do you peel those suckers anyhow?) and very tasty. I nice filling soup for an early autumn night.

I have made this a number of times. I love the carmelized flavor that roasting the squash adds.

I just made this for thanksgiving dinner and it was a big hit. People were asking for the recipe all night. I didn't use any acorn squash and roasted the butternuts like the others suggested. One thing I'd recommend is slicing the butternut into extra large chunks of equal sizes before roasting. That way, they'll all cook at the same speed. Just halving the butternuts left me with some parts that were ready while others were still stringy and rock hard. I didn't change any of the seasonings and thought it was good. Maybe the only thing I'd change would be to cut the sugar in half, as it seemed a little bit too sweet. Also, I made this the day before and then reheated an hour before dinner and I reckon the flavors were even better than on night one.

the recipe as written is way too bland -- I roasted all the vegetables, which helped, but it needs a big shot of white wine -- I added about a cup and a half, in lieu of some of the chicken stock. It still needed something, so I threw in a little cumin and quite a lot of salt. My guests loved it, but it still seems to lack something -- anybody got an idea what's missing here?

Quite good. I used butternut squash which was roasted along with an unpeeled garlic. My only other recommendation would be to run it through a blender as I prefer my soups a bit more velvety in texture. The bacon addition from a previous reviewer sounds like a winner.

Another big fan of this recipe, which is so filling we serve it as a main course, along with a light salad. This far surpasses any of the other recipes I've tried for squash, pumpkin or sweet potato soups. So much has already been written, so I'll just add a few additional comments: 1) DEFINITELY roast the squash, it'll save you hours in peeling time, while adding a lovely carmelized flavor to the soup. 2) Be sure to roast it early enough so that it is cool to handle for scooping out the flesh. 3) Use fresh herbs, and be sure to sprinkle some on the croutons. 4) I didn't find the garlic to be overwhelming at all, but I did like it better when I roasted the garlic under the squash (as someone else suggested) rather than sauted it with the onions. 5) I don't have a wand, so I just used my food processer...wasn't a problem at all, did it in two batches, I just poured half of it in a bowl first then processed the other half.

Definitely roast or steam the squash beforehand. I made the mistake of not reading the reviews before I made this, and peeling uncooked squash is a nightmare. Overall, the texture of the soup is great, I didn't change any of the seasonings and I enjoyed it.

Made this today for our restaurant's Valentine's Dinner Menu. I followed the ingredients exactly, however as others have suggested, to save time and work. Simply steam the squash in your oven. No need to peel and cut it up. Also, instead of pureeing it in batches, simply use a wand. Very easy and simple to make, with a beautiful presentation. I also made the croutons the day before, except for adding the cheese under the broiler.

Yum! I've been searching for a squash soup that rivals that of my favorite French bistro in NYC - and this one comes awfully close. I made a few changes to suit my taste and it came out fantastic. Instead of acorn squash I used all butternut. I left out the thyme and added some traditional squash seasonings (a dash here and there) like nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon and a few tsp of sugar. The sugar really brings out the flavor of the squash without making the soup sweet. The spices added a subtle flavor and the overall soup was still very savory. I also increased the broth to maintain a velvety texture since I had so much squash. Other than that it was the norm - salt and pepper to taste, a touch of cream to finish and it was amazing! Oh yes, I almost forgot - invest in a hand blender . . . so much easier than using a food processor and it gets the whole thing done at once.

Outstanding! and that's with some shortcuts I took. Instead of boiling the squashes called for, I sauteed the onion and garlic, added the broth, put it into a large pot, and added 4 packages frozen pureed winter squash (about 10oz by weight each) and one can of pureed pumpkin (not pumpkin pie filling). I added two Tablespoons of sugar (more than the recipe said) but sweetness was still very subtle. I also added 1/4 tsp ground ginger which didn't really register--I might try more another time, or just leave it out. Finally, I added 1/2 cup creme fraiche rather than the 1/4 c whipping cream because I like the slightly sour flavor of creme fraiche. (For homemade creme fraiche, combine 1 cup whipping cream with 1 cup sour cream. Let stand 2 hours in a warmish place, then refrigerate until thickened. Use the leftover on sugared fruit, with baked applies or chocolate desserts, etc) I bought store-made parmesan and garlic flavored croutons at my local gourmet store. The croutons do add flavor to the soup. Again, with all this cheating the soup was excellent; with all the original pains taken I'm sure it's even better.

This was an unqualified hit! To the reviewer from Milwaukee...Yes, it is just as wonderful if frozen. I froze the leftover soup and served it as an appetizer for roast chicken (I did make a fresh batch of croutons to go with it). It was a hit with the family a week later!

Yum! I used dried herbs, threw in some roasted garlic, left out the whipping cream (didn't want the fat) and didn't make the croutons (it was just for 2 of us at home). It was great with sandwiches on a Sunday night! It was also a smart way of using leftover roasted winter squash from the dinner party the night before. I used combination of cubed squash, roasted cubed squash and squash that I halved and roasted. I just can't seem to duplicate the mouth-watering roasted butternut squash soup at my favorite SF French restaurant - La Foliw!

I've made this two times already, and am about to make it again. It's really tasty. I think this time I'll try roasting the squash - it's especially difficult to peel an acorn squash. Oh, and I used my immersion blender on it and it worked like a charm.

I prepared this soup as the first course for our Thanksgiving dinner. It was delicious. I didn't change a thing other than to double the recipe. For those of you who have a hard time cutting squash w/o roasting it, try sharpening your knives. You have to do this more often than you think but it makes a world of difference. The croutons were a lovely touch in terms of mkaing for an elegant presentation, but when I make this again for a less formal event, I'll skip them.

Excellent soup that vanished like dew before the sun. I was pushing seconds when my wife had to tell me there was no more left. Yes indeed you bake/roast the squashes and scoop out the insides! No need whatever to peel or cut. I used brown sugar and think someone's idea of maple syrup would also be worth trying.

As the Thanksgiving starter, this soup disappeared like dew before the sun. I was pushing seconds when my wife had to tell me it was already all gone. Yes indeed bake the squashes and scoop them out.

What an amazing soup. I've tried it twice now and I think I personally like it best with all butternut squash, not roasting it before and adding a little more cream at the end. When I made it with the acorn squash AND roasted the squash (as other reviewers suggested) , I thought the taste was a bit strong. The croutons are amazing and they really add a lot to the soup.

Dear "Cook from Silicon Valley, CA". I wish we were neighbors. I thought this soup was excellent too. I doubled the recipe because I needed to serve 12 people; now I have plenty left over for the weekend. I also roasted the squashes. This is a lovely soup. The fresh herbs are key, in my opinion.

I didn't make the gruyere croutons this time, but will try them in the future. I, like others, roasted the squash before adding to the soup. I used the sugar in the recipe to slowly carmelize the onions. Unfortunately, I didn't have fresh herbs on hand, but the flavour was still nice with the dry herbs (used about 1/3 as much as fresh. This would be a nice first course for a fall dinner party.

I skipped the pre-roasting, the croutons, and the sugar and it was still a hit. I also substituted vegetable stock instead of chicken stock. I think the quality of this soup depends mostly on how good (and sweet) your squash is. That being said, we were lucky to have some top notch squash from our organic farm membership. Highly recommended.

Excellent- 3 1/2 forks. Did not change any ingredients, but did roast the squash, which I believed saved a lot of time while perhaps adding greater depth of flavor.

No extra sugar needed--man that squash was sweet!--and as a garnish, I sauteed some finely chopped leeks in butter & olive oil till they were just slightly crispy and sweet--the perfect finish. A lovely, warm fall meal (Baby, it's cold outside!)

I sometimes make this with just butternut squash (when I'm in a rush, since I can buy it already cut and peeled) and it is delicious. When I do I often use curry powder to taste (add to the onions when they are almost done, before the broth) instead of the thyme and sage and skip the croutons. Either way it's a great soup.

I've made this recipe many times, and guests love it! Do yourselves a favor; instead of peeling the squash cut it in half, scoop out the seeds and roast it in the oven @ 375 for about an hour. When it is tender, you can just scoop the pulp out and add it to your pot. This makes the active preparation much shorter! I also like to add a couple of granny smith apples - a little tartness adds to the soup.

I never imagined I could make something that tasted this good. It is an exceptional soup and very easy.I used a baking pumpkin because my grocery was out of butternut and acorn squash.

You can add me to the list of those who loved this recipe! I made it exactly as specified, but I think I ended up with more squash than intended, so I used a bit more cream and sugar. Having wrestled with cutting up squash before, I roasted squash halves in a 425-degree oven. I brushed a little butter on each cut side, and found 35 minutes to be plenty. That amount of time added some nice roasty "zest" to the texture, and meant no-muss, no-fuss prep of the squashes. It also cut down on the final simmer time. My guests loved the croutons so much, we ate them all, so there are none left for tomorrow, alas! They also begged to take some home. Try this, you won't be disappointed. And this is coming from someone who usually turns up her nose at squash!

I made this for a dinner party of young adults who I suspected hate squash. But, it got such good reviews I couldn't resist--and I had this squash just sitting in the garage. So, I made it and they ate it! I got lots of compliments and I'm printing out the recipe right now to share. We played with it, adding apple juice for some of the broth, some extra creme because we had it, some extra herbs, some Cayenne pepper, probably some other stuff ended up in there. Delicious. (The cheese for the croutons was expensive. They were good, but not required.)

Instead of trying to peel the squash, cut it in half or quarters and seed it. Sprinkle it with salt and pepper and roast in the oven at 400 degrees or until it is slightly browned. You can then scoop out the flesh and use it in recipes. Also, if you are pressed for time you can wrap the cooked squash and keep it in the fridge until you need it.

The soup was absolutely perfect! I loved the subtleness of this soup. The delicate flavors of the two kinds of squash are just slightly complimented by the onion and garlic. This is not supposed to be an explosion in your mouth type of soup, but a hearty and rich tummy warmer. The Gruyere croutons are manditory. The cheese gives the soup just the right tang. It's very common in Europe to have bread in your soup. This is an authentic recipe. I didn't change a thing and I'm glad I didn't! I made this for work at our "Harvest Luncheon" and it was the star of the show!

i have made this soup two years in a row to great reviews from even non squash soup fans. however, i have tweaked the recipe: added sauteed pancetta for flavor, added kabocha squash and pumpkin for depth, and used the chipotle creme fraiche for creamy kick. also, i roasted the squash and only pureed 1/4 of the soup (not a big fan of the pureed soup consistency). enjoy!

Either this dish was way too subtle for me or I did something wrong, because I can't agree with any of the enthusiastic reviewers below! I adore soup and make it often; at least once a week. This was seriously boring, no matter how I tweaked it. The croutons cheered it up marginally, but not nearly enough. I was highly annoyed at having expended quite a bit of effort when I could instead have made our favorite pumpkin soup (which uses roasted red peppers and jalapenos as well as bacon). My kids (who eat everything) said doubtfully "well, it's not the WORST thing you've ever made ...". Not exactly a rave review!

I made this delicious soup a few weeks ago, and really enjoyed it. I followed the advice of others and roasted the squash first, which made the whole process easier. Another option for those who struggle with peeling and cutting the squash -- trader joe's sell bags of peeled diced butternut squash (other types too I think, I just haven't looked). I have used them before and other recepies, and it worked well. Also, you don't really need the cream and butter at the end if you are trying to be more healthy. If you had to pick one, I'd go with the cream. The crutons really make the dish.

I've made this wonderful soup several times now and have tweeked it appeal to my flavour-loving family. I always roast the squash first, it's just so much easier than peeling.

This is the best squash soup that I've ever had. We fight over leftovers. To all those who have such trouble peeling the squash: ditch the knife, and use a good vegetable peeler. For acorn squash, slice it between the ribs so that you have melon-like wedges, which are easy to reach with the peeler. You may have to go over it twice, but it's easy and reduces waste. I do agree that it would be nigh impossible to do with a knife.

I have made this recipe for going on three years, and I just love it! Just spaced on writing a good review to let people know how good this soup is. My only change to this soup over the years is I stoppped adding the cream at the end. I believe that it adds unnecessary calories, and mellows the savory flavors found in the soup. But, you know the French...they but butter and cream in everything! That is why "se ci bon!"

Made this soup for my wife on Valentine's day. She loved it (and me). I cut the acorn squash along the ribs and then pealed the sections with a vegetable pealer with no problems. Just remember to buy a squash larger that what is called for. I forgot I had to take out the seeds etc and came up a little short.

An excellent Gourmet Restraurant in West Akron had this on their menu New Year's Eve. I ordered it as the first course of an unbelievable meal. This soup was out of this world. The croutons were served along side on the plate that was under the bowl of soup and it looked beautiful. The croutons made every bite a wonderful experience. I can't wait to make it at home myself. Fine eating...

I thought this soup was great, my husband said it was "pretty good". It definitely took longer than I anticipated because peeling an acorn squash is no small task (nor is trying to cut through the squash to make 1" pieces). It took at least twice the amount of time to cook the squash than the time specified and was much too thick. I thinned it with homemade chicken broth and it tasted wonderful. I sent some to my neighbor and her husband and they liked it but really raved about the gruyere croutons. These were really tasty and would go with so many soups/salads.

I made this last night for 12 guests and it was very good. I, personally, will use less onion and sage next round. The fresh sage overpowered the squash flavor. About the squash...roasting it was a brilliant idea. It made peeling it a breeze and it was already cooked so that cut the time it spent in the broth. The croutons were a great added touch too. DELISH!

This is this most wonderful soup; however, I am just sorry I didn't discover it sooner! I made the same mistake as other readers - peeling the squash the first time - what a pain! Then, my mother suggested boiling the whole squash first -much easier, and I never noticed any difference. One of my teen-age daughter's favorite recipes!

I made this soup for a large group, and it got raves from absolutely everyone. If it seems a bit thin, initially, just reduce it on simmer for an hour or so. The croutons are also great, and they could go equally well with other soups -- but make them as thin as recommended (1/4"), or they'll be a little too bready. And I echo the other reviewer who suggested increasing the quantity of herbs. I used fresh herbs, and could have easily doubled the amount.

Oh sweet mother of god, this is so delicious. I grow two extra plants each of sage and thyme just to get me through the fall with this soup--heaven!

Next time I will serve the croutons on the side for dunking. They looked beautiful in the soup but got mushy and hard to eat/cut with a spoon.

What a lovely fall recipe!!! I only made a few alterations to this recipe. Instead of using just chicken broth, I used a combination of roasted vegetable broth with the chicken broth. Loved the croutons too! Rec'd many favorable comments from my dinner party guests!!!

I never thought I could make a soup that anyone would care to eat, including myself. I made this soup with wonderful results. I thank the Cook from Brooklyn for their suggestion of baking the squash first. Made it much easier!

Must admit that I'm a little baffled by the reviews. There was nothing wrong with this soup, but I've eaten and made better. Will make it again, but I just don't think it's all that special.

Very good, and freezes well. I made the recipe with all butternut squash, and froze it in single serving containers. Don't know about the croutons, as I have yet to make them.

This was OUTSTANDING! I made it for company and everyone raved. My 5 year old loved it. A keeper. I excluded the whipping cream and it was still very good.

Besides having to cut up the squash, very easy & simple to make. I substitute various herbs for the thyme depending on what I have on hand. I have make it with milk rather than cream.

Wow!! Great soup! I used all butternut squash since that is my favorite. You can sprinkle chives on top for color. The croutons are perfect with it. I also roasted the squash but sauted the garlic with the onion because I don't care much for roasted garlic. So good!!

This is a really strong squash soup recipe. I originally had neglected to add a bit more broth to thin it out, so the consistency was a bit like baby food. But with a touch more liquid it was great. And absolutely don't skip the croutons--though I couldn't find gruyere and used emmanthal instead--they really make the dish. My guests were gushing.

This soup is awesome! I made it for Christmas day lunch with a nice salad and it was perfect! This is one of the best soups I have made yet! I added cream cheese with the heavy whipping cream and I also added the guyerie cheese to the soup.... This soup is a must on a cold winter day!

This is our traditional "starter" for our Christmas dinner every year now. BEAUTIFUL presentation with the croutons floating on top and some fresh herbs sprinkled over. The croutons floating on the soup don't bother me like they did some reviewers, but maybe that's because I like french onion soup, too...or my grilled cheese dipped in tomato soup. Whether you use them on the side or on the soup this is fabulous! Try it!

Rating: 4
A fabulous recipe. It's a good idea to cut/skin your squash the day before and seal in tupperware or ziplocks as this is the most time-consuming part. Another suggestion: set the gruyere croutons on the side for dipping instead of putting in the soup which takes from the flavor.

Rating: 3
I made this soup for three of my friends for lunch. When they heard what it was, they all gave me this funny look. But we all loved it. The croutons really make it taste perfect. The texture is wonderful, and there is not much cream added, so it's not too rich.

Rating: 4
Very good, I didn't find the peeling hard at all, I had my husband do it! The only thing I didn't like is floating the croutons in the soup, too soggy, much better on the side. Everyone raved and asked for recipe!

I made this for some very special dinner guests and everyone loved it! Out of all the dishes I have ever prepared, this is the one I am most proud! Thank you Epicurions for your suggestion, esp. from Brookly, to bake the squash first. it made this recipe much easier to prepare!

OK, so don't be mad that this isn't a review of the "exact recipe": I love this recipe as is but we REALLY love this recipe made with an equal amount of sweet potatoes instead of squash. One, it's easier. Two, not as stringy. And you don't need the sugar at the end. Delicious!

Favorite soup recipe

I followed the advice re: roasting the squash w/garlic and sage. Used all acorn squash as that was on sale that day. Putting it through a blender lends an exceptional quality ... the croutons, though, absolutely MAKE this soup an EVENT.

Rating: 4
This is so delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and would do so again. I suspect that roasting the squash alters the beautiful golden yellow color that is such an appealing feature of this soup. It's kind of a pain to peel the squash, but the extra work is probably worth the trouble. The gruyere toasts are a great accompaniment.

Rating: 3
A wonderful winter soup. I made a few changes though.... Like several other people I also roasted the squash -- much easier than peeling and chopping. I cut the squash in half put 3 garlic cloves in each cavity, poured olive oil over each half and sprinkled with some of the sage and thyme and salt and pepper. I covered the squash with foil and roasted at 400 for about 1 hour. Once done it was very easy to scoop out with a spoon. I used half bacon fat and half butter to saute the onions. I did not bother to puree the soup. The roasted squash is already pretty much a puree. I used a potato masher to smooth it a little more. I like texture to my soup, although I might puree if making it for guests. A keeper!

Awesome!! I look forward to the fall now, not just for the colour of the leaves, but for the squash!

This is the most delicious soup I've ever had! It won a soup competition at my office-- everyone wants the recipe. I added a bit of maple syrup instead of sugar, which gives it a special touch.

I took the advice from San Francisco and roasted the squash w/garlic cloves and fresh sage in their cavities at 400 degrees for 1.25 hours, and I took Northridge's advice and drizzled a little olive oil on them before roasting. This gave off a wonderful aroma and flavor for the soup. As everyone else says, the gruyere croutons are fantastic. I think the croutons could be used as appetizers as well. The nice thing is that this recipe adapts so well to other substitutions, many of which have already been mentioned by other reviewers here.

I cut this recipe in half and used a buttercup squash. I didn't have cream but used milk. I didn't have baguette but used whole wheat bread, and used lacy (tiny hole) swiss instead of gruyere. It was excellent!

I made this for a dinner party, and every guest asked for seconds. I, like many of the other reviewers, roasted the squash first to soften it up. It is easy to make and a wonderful savory soup.

I made a few changes and really liked this soup. I served it in a bowl beside fennel potato leek soup and the sweet by the savory made a great balance. I used about a cup of real apple cider to thin instead of cream and fresh rosemary +dried thyme (just what I had on hand). For the croutons I sliced a baguette and buttered it smeared it with blue cheese and drizzled a fair amount of honey and broiled. Perfect combination!

I made this for Christmas eve. It is very good and soothing, but required a lot of salt! I think I'll try it with the pumpkin mentioned in the preliminary recipe comments next time; the flavor would probably be better. The croutons are terrific, however, and really made the soup.

This soup is scrumptious! The fresh thyme and sage are the key elements. This dish adds beautiful color and a wonderful texture to your meal.

This is one of the best soups I have made. I was one of many who roasted the squash (at 400 degrees for an hour and fifteen minutes)with garlic in the cavity and sage sprinkled on top. I used vegetable broth for the base, which worked out just fine. I also made the croutons with butter-flavored cooking spray, which I found to be easier to deal with than butter. Everyone who tried the soup loved it.

I made this soup last night as a first course to the maple glazed pork tenderloin also on this site. I followed previous advice and roasted the squash halves with six unpeeled garlic cloves before completing the recipe. The results were wonderful. Guests loved it!

The croutons really make this. I roasted the squash, which made it much easier. I'd add a little extra garlic, next time. Its very silky and mellow.

I ran a pre-holiday taste test in my quest to expand my soup repertoire. At the suggestion of others, I roasted the squash first which no doubt is really a must for the best flavor and easier prep. I much prefer this to the sweeter squash soups and will give it a go for Thanksgiving - for the final review.

I found this recipe when it was first published I think in '96. I fixed it for my first Christmas with the in-laws at my home. It was such a hit that it has become a steadfast tradition in our Holiday meals, Thanksgiving and Christmas, (even a few birthday requests), it is wonderful, and while planning his first kids Thanksgiving Dinner it was the first thing my 8 year old requested. I would highly reccomend it to anyone.

I usually give 3 forks to my favorite recipes on this site, but this one deserves 4 forks! I roasted the squash, along with the garlic, thereby cutting out the laborious task of peeling and cubing butternut and acorn squash. Eliminating that task made this recipe a more enjoyable one to make...thanks to previous reviewers for that tip. The taste of the thyme with all the other ingredients melded beautifully. I also used half and half instead of cream with great success. Try this one...you will receive lots of compliments with a relatively easy and delicious recipe!

This dish rates as an excellent way to get in your vegetables. The flavor was delicious, pleasant, and light. The Gruyere Croutons are a must to complete the treat. I followed the advice of other reviewers and baked the squash and garlic. I used 1/2 cup of whipped cream, 1 tsp. dried thyme, and 1 tsp. dried sage. I plan to make this again. A definite keeper.

roasting the squash as suggested in another review is definitely the way to make this dish. the croutons are beyond compare and much easier than i expected - stayed crunchy while floating, probably because the soup is so good that it doesn't last long. fed this to someone who had never had squash before, and they fell in love. me too. fabulous!

I made this soup as an appetizer for Thanksgiving and it was a hit for everyone, even my fussy meat-and-potatoes husband. I also roasted the squash and garlic in the oven and think it made the flavour more intense. It is also great heated up the next day. I should've made more of the croutons though, they were devoured in minutes!!

I served this as a first course and even the squash haters ate it! The croutons are a must - I think they add some texture and interest, distracting from the baby food appearance of the soup. I, too, baked the squash until it was tender enough to cut easily, then added it to the soup to simmer.

One of my favorite soups. The only problem is how long it takes to peel the sqash. I plan on making it for a baby shower-luncheon for 50 women. It doubles (triples,etc...) perfectly.

This is a delicious fall-winter soup. Instead of boiling the squash I cut them in half, sprinkled with olive oil and a little dried sage, placed six un-peeled garlic cloves in the cavities and roasted at 375 until they were tender. Scooped out the roasted squash and garlic and proceeded with the recipe. I think that roasting adds a little depth of flavor, didn't need the sugar as the soup was just perfect without it.

I loved this soup and couldn't seem to get enough of it. I even added one extra clove of garlic.

In fact, one of my neighbors is paying me to make it for her family this weekend.

This recipe has potential, but to my taste "4 large cloves of garlic" totally ruined the soup by taking over completely. If you make this, start with one clove of garlic and see how you like it --you can always sautee more and add it later. Otherwise you'll end up with a garlic bisque that's a pretty color.
