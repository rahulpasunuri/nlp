I was surprised just how much I liked this recipe and how easy it was to make! I don't have a skillet capable of going into the oven so I did the first part of the cooking in the skillet and then transferred it to a pie pan for the oven cooking. It turned out great and was a good main dish that both vegetarians and non-vegetarians can enjoy!

I was hesitant to make this dish because of the amount of mint in it. I barely noticed it at all. (I did use dried mint instead of fresh) I also used fat free ricotta cheese, and it was still wonderful. Happy Cooking!

My husband & I made this asparagus frittata receipe as soon as I printed it up. It was very tasty. Yes, we will make it again. Steamed asparagus was getting tiresome, until now. Thank you very much.
