ok, I have to admit I have been making parmesan crusted chicken for years and it is delicious and easy. But after I read the ingredients for the Asparagus with Sauce Maltaise it sounds like a heart attack waiting to happen. I mean 3 sticks of butter!!! I would do what the reviewer said about using parchment paper since I am all about easy clean up, but my favorite way and the most delicious to prepare asparagus is so simple, toss in olive oil, roast in one layer in the oven until lightly browned (I use my Breville toaster oven). Shave or grate Parm Reggiano over right after you take it out and it melts on the warm asparagus. You could even add a poached egg on top if you wanted some extra pizzazz. But don't, don't ruin good asparagus with all that butter, you want to taste the asparagus, not smother it!!!

I didn't like the sauce at all. I ended up throwing it out. The chicken eas good though.

Wow -- this was good. I think I probably overcooked the egg yolk mixture a little bit, but adding a little more lemon juice to the blender fixed that right up. I worried about the flavor right after it was finished, but after it sat a few minutes, I liked it a lot. We made this as a side for some grilled salmon, and most of us went ahead and put it on the salmon, too. Since it makes a large batch, we have leftovers. We'll be using it in place of Hollandaise on our Benedict- style eggs in the morning. It was quick, easy, and not as messy as previous reviewers made it sound. I'll definitely make this again!

Simple to make but the cleanup is more than you might bargain for. Grater for the orange, bowls for the egg white and lemon juice, processor bowl and thing you melted the butter in. I used a cast iron skillet and put in in the barbeque with the salmon steaks. When the asparagus and sauce were ready, the butter was bubbling hot and ready. This sauce is a perfect accompaniment for salmon and I suppose could be used as a marinade for salmon or halibut. I had left-overs but they got used up with no fuss. If you only cook something on the barby to go with this, the cleanup is worth the results.

YUM YUM! Made it with ritz whole wheat crackers for added crunch. Left big clumps for taste! Combined with the asparagus, and garlic mashed potatoes... excellent EASY meal.

I would agree with the two reviewers who rated this recipe as excellent. I now use this instead of a family hollandaise sauce recipe. I think that using the blender makes it lighter and creamier than just using the whisk. I also use it over grilled pork tenderloin. YUMMY!

I (and all our guests of multiple occasions) agree with the second reviewer: Exceptional! Perfect addition to both the chicken and the veggies without being overpowering. It is also incredibly easy. Use the blender if at all possible. If you do not have a blender handy, make it a little ahead of time as, being a basically a butter sauce, it will thicken as it cools. I have made this for both dinner parties and cut the chicken up as appitizers and topped it with the sauce five times ... I have had an opportunity to eat it only two of those times because it has been instantly devoured. Enjoy!

Followed the recipe as is but sauce was too runny and didn't taste exceptionally rich for the amount of butter it required.

For the first time making a "maltaise" sauce...I think this is one of the most delicious additions to asparagus and chicken that I've EVER tasted. I don't know what the previous reviewer was thinking, but this recipe is EXCEPTIONAL!!! It does take a little work to get right...but it's worth the effort...you'll love it, and so will your guests!!!

There is no need to cook the eggs unless you are into "safe sauce." You also don't need a blender, just a whisk. A more authentic and simpler recipe appears in Julia Child's first book,
