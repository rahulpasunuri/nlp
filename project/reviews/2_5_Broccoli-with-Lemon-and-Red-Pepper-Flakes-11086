I really liked the idea of this dish. Instead of just putting the lemon zest, red pepper flakes and oil over the steamed broccoli, I heated up the oil in a pan and toasted up the red pepper flakes and lemon zest and then threw in the broccoli for a quick sear in the delicious, now flavored oil. Not quite as flavorful as I was hoping for, but worth trying again.

A refreshing recipe! Will definitely make again! Paired with the roasted red potates with lemon.

This was OK. Most of the family didn't care for the lemon on the broccoli, and the little bit of red pepper I did put in was too much for the kids. I put a bunch more on mine and it still didn't give it much flavor. This is coming from a family full of broccoli lovers!

This is a good weeknight meal - quick, tasty and inexpensive. We used whole-wheat pasta (to make it healthier) and added chicken (to make it more substantial). I will make it again no doubt.

Tried it the way they suggested, was lacking something. Used the same ingredients, but stir fried instead of steamed,added a little lemon juice in last minute of cooking,and lemon zest after cooking improved flavor for me

I also thought it was lacking something so I added roasted sesame seeds to round out the flavour. And a very good idea it was. I'm going to use that with more vegetable recipes.

I'm not wild about the flavour, but it DOES make my ho-hum broccoli taste like an entirely new vegetable. And that's exciting... isn't it?

NICE CHANGE, COMBINING BROCCOLI WITH LEMON ZEST AND RED PEPPER FLAKES. (SOMETHING WE HAVE A LOT OF HERE!). BEATS BOG STANDARD STEAMING OR SMOTHERING WITH A CHEESE SAUCE ONCE IN A WHILE.

I agree with Toronto cook: it needs something. I didn't want to add too much red pepper - I wanted taste not fire - so I added 2-3 tbs of lemon juice. After that, with liberal salt, it was very good.

This dish unfortunately just did not have much flavour despite the lemon and hot pepper flakes. Good old steamed broccoli with S&P is just as good.
