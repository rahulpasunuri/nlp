I used sliced white mushrooms and boneless thighs. At the end, I added a little soy sauce and some sea salt.

This is a pretty good representation of a yummy Hawaiian favorite. My family likes to add tomatoes, but there are many variations of chicken long rice and this is not a bad standard.

my kids love this dish- they love noodles of any kind. in my kitchen i use fish sauce instead of salt and add spinach to wilt at the last minute.

Way too much liquid to be a noodle dish, unless it is intended to be a soup. Taste would have been ok, if I hadn't overcooked to try to rid some liquid. Not very impressive, just ok as a side dish and just ok as an addition to an otherwise themed buffet.

My husband and I love this soup! It's so simple and I usually have these ingredients on hand, so it's perfect for a weeknight dinner. Sometimes I add cut up regular or firm tofu and napa cabbage to it. Depends on what I have in the fridge. It gives it more texture and absorbs the flavour of the broth. I left out the noodles and served it over white Japanese rice. I'm not really into those noodles either. You could try it with Udon or Soba noodles. Mmm....I think I'll make this tonight!

We found a noodle we didn't like. If you like bean thread noodles, then you may like this dish (although I found it a bit bland somehow). I find the creatures to be wormy strange. Maybe if I used a different noodle, added some chile sauce, maybe lemongrass - well, why don't I make what I like? See the Chinese Chicken Noodle Soup on this site. Loads better.
