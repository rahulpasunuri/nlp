In a word: bland, and a waste of good Chianti.

This is very good. The beets need "something" in the end, but I'm not sure what. Very good - I made this with the Parmesan-Dijon Drumsticks and they were fab! The drumsticks need to cook at 350 for 1 hour. The beets need to roast at 450 for 1 hour. I put the drumsticks in with the beets (I have one oven) for 30 minutes together. When the beets were done, I decreased the temperature to 350 and cooked for another 30 minutes. It came out FABULOUS!!!

Wow! My guests LOVED this dish. I skipped the 2 tablespoons of butter at the end, and I really don't think it would have added anything except calories.

This was an amazing hit! The sweetness of the wine balanced the slightly tart bite of the beet and it comes out a beautiful ruby color.

I dismissed the one review that didn't like it because they didn't skin the beets, and I thought that was the cause. After making it (to the letter), I'm inclined to agree with their negativity. It was just there, nothing special. I didn't like it at all, but some guests had positive comments. I used a great bottle of wine, produce from Whole Foods, etc., so it wasn't an "inferior ingredient" issue. I was really disappointed, as I love beets (and wine!). Oh well.

I made this for Easter and it was delicious. The beets were rich and the leeks brought a richness to the dish. I used combo of Zinfandel and cabernet. They were open and didn't want to open another bottle, but they worked well with the other ingredients.

Wow everyone that rated this loved it and I thought mine was only so-so. My beets were bitter but I wonder if thats because I left the skin on as I was running out of time and I used Babaresco an Italian red but that should have been better than Chianti- I love beets too and I love things cooked in red wine- so odd that this didn't cut it for me- can't figure that one out- anyway I won't be making this again.

These beets are so delicious, and so colorful and beautiful - especially lovely with holiday meals. The pre-roasting and peeling step is a bit labor intensive, but well worth the effort. You can make earlier in the day and re-heat in the microwave before serving without any loss in looks or flavor. It is surprising how much wine is used, but in the end result the wine is not predominant - just lovely aromatic deep red beets. Every time I make these beets I am asked for the recipe. It is really a winner.

Even better than harvard beets. A great pairing with the menu. Yum!! Will make again and again.

Not only do beets add beautiful color to the plate, but this dish is also very tasty. Cooked as is - be sure to include the leeks because it really makes the dish - and served alongside grilled lamb and "Sauteed Carrots with Rosemary and Lemon." Only difference is that I used (cheap) on-hand merlot. It was a great, fulfilling, and no-carb meal. Loved it.

My Guests just raved about this dish. The best is that you get such a "beety" flavor-everyone said that they never had tasted beets like this. THis dish is well worth the effort.

I am a real beet lover and thought this was fabulous. Followed the recipe exactly and used a really good chianti. Rave reviews from guests. Will definitely make this one again.

These were the best beets we have ever eaten. We have tried other beet recipes since, and everyone wants these for the holidays. A little labor intensive, but well worth it for the rave reviews.

This was an interesting and delicious preparation for beets. We roasted and then peeled the beets the day before serving. The second stage was relatively simple to complete before our guests arrived.

Yum! The wine and leeks reduce to a wonderful, carmely glaze. I used cabernet as that's always open in my house. I found that the beets got too black uncovered at such a high temp, so I covered them with foil half-way through and lowered to 350. Since they still had to simmer 15 min. on the stove, this worked well and they didn't get too mushy. This will be a definite repeat at our table.

I love beets and thought the recipe was tasty, but many steps. Not sure I would take the time again, but would recommend as the flavor was nice.
