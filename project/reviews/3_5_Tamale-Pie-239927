This was a good way to use left-over pork loin roast and other odds and ends. I make a pork roast similar to the one in the recipe and then diced the left overs, plus added a left-over NY strip, sliced. I ended up cooking the filling mixture for about 2 hours since I wanted the liquid to reduce, which allowed the meat to shred. It was a very good dish, although I think the tamale coating was too oily. I would decrease the oil to the cornmeal by a third and add at least 1 Tbs of honey. It would then have rated more than 3 forks.

Although this recipe has the potential for a really delicious dish, in the future I plan on "kicking it up a notch" by adding some chipotle sauce to the filling, and either some honey or sugar to the crust to bring out more sweetness of the corn flavor. There needs to be a stronger contrast of flavors between the filling and the crust than what the original recipe has.

There might be many steps, but they are not difficult and the result is a wonderfully tasty/abundant meal. There are indeed several flavor layers to this dish and it was great fun discerning them all during the meal. I would add a little heat to the next creation with possibly a little extra cumin and cayenne in the filling. We do like our mexican dishes to have a touch of a kick. My husband found himself adding some of his favorite roasted habanero salsa on the side. It was fun to make and we will share it with more friends again soon.

This was a big hit with my weekend guests. The flavoring of the meat filling was multi-layered, savory and fabulous. I would make it to use as a burrito or enchilada filling too. In the past I have made tamale pies using masa harina instead of the cornmeal and I missed the flavor of it in this recipe so I would make that substitution next time to make it taste more like tamale. The recipe barely fit into the 9x13 glass pan, filled it right to the top. I placed the pan on a foil covered sheet pan to contain any overflow and some juices did overflow. Next time I would reduce any excess liquid a bit more perhaps by not covering the pan for the final 20 minute simmer.
