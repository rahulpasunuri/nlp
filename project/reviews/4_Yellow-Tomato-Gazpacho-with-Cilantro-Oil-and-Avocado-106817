I make this recipe often in the summer and love its freshness! I have made it exactly as the recipe states but it is also wonderful with just about everything substituted... sherry vinegar, fresh squeezed oj, red/yellow/orange peppers or tomatoes, with and without the jalapeño pepper, cherry tomatoes and the last time I made it, I left out the jalapeño and caramelized the onions and garlic before adding them to the blender (which I loved. Next time, I plan to try grilling the onion, garlic and jalapeno which I think will add just the right flavour!

Truely an excelent gazpacho. I replaced regular orange juice with some blood orange juice italian soda I had and it's awesome. Will definately make again.

I made this exactly as written. The cilantro oil tempers the acidity of the tomatoes- something just adding chopped cilantro would not do. A welcome and refined change from the ubiquitous red gazpacho.

careful on the jalepeno!!

I process the tomatoes, cukes/onion/garlic, and yellow peps separately so each can be done to proper consistency. (Did not bother with the whole juicing tomatoes thing, just threw them in the food processor). Due to comments on the site about the time/effort to make the cilantro oil, I used the same ingredients and made a pesto which I served on the side along with avocado. Made with good yellow tomatoes fresh from the garden. A keeper!

I already submitted a review but I just made this recipe again and strained it after pureeing. The texture is beautiful and brings it up to 4 stars for me. Take the time to let it sit overnight and garnish when serving with finely chopped avocado,red tomato, cukes and fresh cilantro or basil. Cilantro oil is not necessary. Really good!!

Fantastic! I used sungold cherry tomatoes and pureed them and then strained out the seeds. I intended to make the cilantro oil but after I tasted the wonderful flavor of the soup decided to forego the cilantro oil. My only other modification was to use half a jalapeno.

Magnificent! Delicious & makes a beautiful presentation. I too just added chopped cilantro to each bowl instead of the cilantro oil.

Yummy.Loved the colour and flavour. Pureed everything together(except diced avocado and chopped cilantro added at serving time).Wasn't spicy at all-added extra hot pepper sauce. Very pretty served in stemmed goblets.

I was wondering what to do with all the yellow tomatoes I planted this year and I found out. I've made this gazpacho twice now. It's so easy ( I don't strain out seeds), light, and delicious. The orange juice is a great addition. I also just cut up cilantro instead of using cilantro oil.

I have made this twice -- one in France and once with heirloom yellow tomatoes I got at Whole Foods. It was fabulous both times. The French tomatoes were a little sweeter so I found myself adding more vinegar. I didn't bother with the cilantro oil and, the second time I left out the avocado -- didn't need it. My husband ate this two nights in a row which is unprecedented.

This recipe was a huge hit at a dinner party I had for 7 people. Wish I had made a little more, as there wasn't any left over for seconds. I skipped the cilantro oil and just added fresh cilantro. Will definitely be adding this one to my permanent collection.

All I can say is YUMMY! I couldn't find yellow tomatoes and used red and it was still delicious. I like the kick and the spice. I skipped the cilantro oil and served with croutons, chopped cilantro and avocado. It was a hit!

Excellent recipe which has won raves each time I've served it. However the cilantro oil is a little to much effort, so I just float chopped cilantro, avacado and chopped red tomatoes on top when I serve it. Adds color and flavor.

This is a good one. Definitely better if made the day before. I had orange tomatoes and used a red pepper, so the color came out a very pretty sunny orange. Starts out fruity-sweet and sour, then the heat comes rolling in over your tongue. WOW! Scrape some seeds out of the jalapeno if you don't like it so hot. If you're pressed for time, put everything in the food processor and pulse until desired consistency. Good even without avocado if you want to cut fat calories. But why would you want to overwhelm the subtle blend of flovors with cilantro? Leave it out. Use parsley oil instead if you insist on a color swirl.

I made this recipe as part of a themed Spanish dinner party that included tapas (salted almonds from Epicurious.com), Salad Sevilla and Birthday Party Paella. Dessert was Lime Tarts with Meringue Lattice. The gazpacho was one of the best I have ever made. My husband who doesn't really like gazpacho has asked me to make this recipe again and again. I tried to put the lime cilantro oil in a squeeze bottle to drizzle on top, but the cilantro bits clogged it up. Cilantro oil is worth making.

Perfect as it is, one of the best soups for hot summer day

This recipe was SO easy to make! It is also a beautiful presentation. My guests did comment that the soup was a little strong on the garlic, so maybe scale back depending on your taste.

A big hit with guests! Time consuming but worth the effort. Be forewarned, it's spicy! Next time I'll tone down the jalapeno a bit unless I'm certain the eaters like it hot!

i made this the day i got it and it was fantastic....i left out the cilantro oil abd most of the jalepeno and my boyfriend, who hates tomotoes and has horrible cholesterol LOVED it --- any other similar healthy recipes would be appreciated

A lot of work but I really enjoyed this and so did my dinner guests. I would experiment more with the jalapeno as it was too hot for my taste until I added more pureed tomatoes and avocado to cut the heat. If you want to simplify, don't make the cilantro oil, I used it as an accent, it made way too much and didn't contribute a whole lot to the gazpacho except a bit of colour.

This is alot of work but my very picky guests were wowed. I like the vibrant colors and the delicious kick of the jalapeno.

I found that a whole jalepeno gave this soup too much kick. Mine came out more like a thin salsa. I'd make it again with less spice.

This is a delightful and refreshing summer starter, a great alternative to traditional gazpacho. I have made it twice to rave reviews from my particular husband and friends who know good food! I topped mine with home-made creme fraiche in addition to avocado and cilantro oil-just delicious! As others have mentioned, it's important to salt and pepper both the soup and the cilantro oil to *your* taste satisfaction. Also, I omited the water from the cilantro oil- I couldn't envision how it would add anything to the flavor or consistency (in fact, I could see adding water as being detrimental to both) For those who don't like cilantro or aren't interested in exploring the flavor nuances of the other ingredients, I recommend you don't bother making it- it is quite a bit of work and you probably won't appreciate the end result. New Zealand Marlborough sauvignon blanc and Alsace pinot both pair well with this dish.

this was great...I used red tomatoes and you probably dont even need the cilantro oil.

The picture in the magazine didn't do this justice. It was delicious and beautiful too. I can't imagine someone saying this had no flavor. Did you forget to read season with salt & pepper in both the gazpacho and the cilantro oil? The cilantro oil was fun to make and very brightly colored. Will use this in other recipes for plating. I made this with yellow and then with orange tomatoes. I prefer the color and flavor of the orange tomatoes. Also it should be served in a shallow bowl so the chopped vegetables don't sink to the bottom. Very fresh and well spiced.

I SERVED THIS SOUP IN MY RESTURANT. THE CUSTOMERS LOVED IT AND ASK FOR IT ALL THE TIME I MAKE IT.

So so. After tasting this I prefer the traditional red gazpacho more. It also lacked a flavor-I don't what though.
