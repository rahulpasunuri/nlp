This wasn't bland at all as one other reviewer stated; just not as complex as other gumbos. We had a guest with gluten issues so we eliminated the roux and added cornstarch at the end, which also made it less labor-intensive.

I made this on Saturday night for a group of friends. It was amazing. I substituted turkey andouille sausage for the tasso and added chopped defrosted okra when I tossed in the sausage (a gumbo recipe without okra just seemed wrong). It was delicious.

I found it a little on the bland side. I would recommend adding a can of tomato paste to the roux, with the onions & green pepper.

I found this recipe to be really bland for a southern Louisiana dish. The taste did improve somewhat after refrigeration and reheating. Perhaps the expectation was that the tasso was spicy enough to make up for the lack of additional added ingredients. My tasso was the real thing and still didn't provide nearly enough pizzazz.

Although I'd never cooked using this roux method, I had no problem with the technique. Seasoning amounts were perfect, and the clam juice called for in another recipe on this site was not missed at all. This Gumbo recipe proved to be a delicious, no hassle, crowd pleaser for a large summer gathering in the hamptons!

This tastes great! Luckily, I had tasso in my freezer. The only caveat is that the roux took much longer and I still didn't wait patiently for the color to come up - so my gumbo was a bit pale, albeit tasty! Will try again - roux takes patience...

OMG...this brings back the memories! I went to high school in Abbeville and one of the most important things I learned was "first you make a roux". When my kitchen remodel is finished I will have to make this dish.
