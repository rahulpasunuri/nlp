Sorry not a big winner in my house. Made it exactly per recipe, just wasnt very good. Tater was great to start ruined it with Chili. I wont tell you what to do different with this because it is some one elses recipe. Dont creep up someone elses recipe by telling them what you did different with it. If you changed it, you didnt do the original recipe and defeated the rating purpose here.

Nice combo of flavors and easy to make. Not that special but easy to customize.

The idea in itself is very good, but the chili isn't. Way too much cinnamon and oregano, no onion, simply no good. I'm probably going to make this, however, with South American picadillo, one of my favourite chili recipes (with onion, capers, almonds and peas).

Very good. I liked the combination of flavors.

The chili was not good at all. I agree with the other reviewers that the cinnamon was a bit too strong, plus I thought the large amount of oregano made it too herbal. I had to tweak it quite a bit to make it edible (added garlic, a dash of curry and a shot of maple syrup). I would serve chili over a potato again, but I wouldn't use this recipe.

Surprisingly tasty, I'll make a better bakedpotato next time! Used "white" potatoes rather than the yukon golds because they all sucked at the grocery store. :) Also substituted rw vinegar for balsamic, forgot to get that. Worked!

I have made this for years, by my own recipe. My husband and I are in our eighties, and we have lived all this time eating butter, cream, and fat. If you want a real good recipe for chili potato special, email me. I don't like when people make a recipe and tell all the stuff they did different, that's just bastardizing the whole recipe idea. If you don't like they way it looks in the recipe...write your own damn cookbook. Have a good day. Bertha Blevens

We loved it! We used extra chilli powder and a little more ground beef. We also cut back on the cinnamon and topped with cheese.

Husband and I liked this. Added extra chilli-powder and a can of red kidney beans. Also put taco cheese on top. Would use a little less cinnamon next time but it was very good and fast to make.Maybe a little green onion next time.

Made this for dinner and was very disappointed in the results. I think it was the cinnamon we didn't like. Would never make this again!

Although this wasn't the most incredible chili I've ever tasted, considering the short prep time and the fact that it was so simple to make, this is a great dish and I would definitely make it again. Contrary to some other reviews, it certainly was NOT tasteless.

It's baked potatoes with a kick! My roommates and I really enjoyed it. We added a bit more chili powder for more flavor, but this is a great dish! :)

I am not used to cinnamon flavor in my chili, and this was not very good. It made a good dip for chips, but that is about it.

This was nothing special, quite tasteless. We agreed we could have put Stagg Chili over the potato or beef with Taco Seasoning and it would have been much better.(We've done both before.) I don't know what prompted me to make this. I would not ever do this again. (I'm writing this just after dinner. If I had waited to write this, I probably would not have thought it was this bad.)

Badass Recipe, couldnt wait to prepare it, and the taste went beyond my expectations. In short this is the Ayatollah of Chili.
