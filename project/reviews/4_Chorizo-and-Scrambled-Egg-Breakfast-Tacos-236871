Yum! Seriously good stuff on a bright, sunny Saturday morning, no matter what the outside temp is! With a tall glass of ice cold OJ, totally hit the spot.

A quick, delicious breakfast, used six eggs instead of four; also flour tortillas. The step about melting the cheese on the tortilla before adding the egg, chorizo, green onion mixture is a good one.

Great recipe with lots of options for adding extras. Sautéd leftover asparagus and orange pepper, along with green onions with soy chorizo. Unless you have a giant grilling pan, the cooking instructions are a bit cumbersome. I toasted each of the tortillas individually but then put them on a cookie sheet and baked the filled, folded tortillas until the cheese melted. The result was a huge hit with our company.

This was pretty good, but a bit heavy. I think that scrambling the eggs when the chorizo is still in the pan was my big mistake. If you stir the eggs to any degree, the chorizo will cause the egg curds to be tiny, and the eggs almost blend in with the sausage. I will probably make this again, but I will remove the sausage from the skillet, and scramble the eggs by themselves... or even maybe scramble the eggs first and set aside. Overall much richer and a bit heavier than I expected for breakfast. A little filling goes a long way with these tacos.

My kids couldn't fathom eating chorizo for "Breakfast?" they left nothing! This was easy and fast. i scattered the cheese over the finished eggs and melted under broiler so it was more simple. And let them build their own.

This recipe is delicious as written, but I made a chipotle cream sauce, which works fantastic with this. We use this instead of the sour cream. My husband and I both thought the addition of the chipotle gave it just the right kick and added that nice smoky flavor.

This was excellent. I found myself sort of grossed out by the chorizo as I'm not a big meateater. I would suggest a soy version if you're like me. But otherwise very very tasty. Made fresh pico de gallo to accompany. My hubby LOVED them.

For a hearty breakfast...yum. I used spicy italian sausage instead of chorizo -- all good. This is one of those recipes where you want to use a bit extra of pretty much everything. A bit more fresh cilantro, a bit extra cheese, and over-stuff the tacos. Served some cut fruit with it, to give just a little healthy balance. Good for 2, but I think it woudl be a good crowd pleaser if you made a tray.

Made these for Mother's Day. Everyone loved them. I used chicken chorizo and I bought salsa, a fire roasted green salsa. Delicious!

I liked this dish but I think the tortillas from Europe are just to different from American tortillas. The tortillas were so hard it was more like eating a tostada. The chorizo I bought fresh from the butcher, and I had it spiced with paprika and fresh garlic, in my opinion it made the flavor better. I did add a small amount of red onion, mushroom, and leek which really added more texture. My only complaint was the tortillas, they just were gross...

Oh my goodness, these were so delicious. I couldn't find chorizo at my supermarket, so I used andouille sausage. Also, I only used about a tblsp of cilantro because I'm not really a fan of that herb. The tacos were still really yummy and everybody loved them.

I made this for breakfast last saturday...soooooo good. I cooked the chorizo in a well seasoned skillet & drained off most of the grease before adding the eggs. Also added some chopped tomato & avocado to the finished tacos. This is a definitely a keeper!

I concur with the previous reviewer, these baby's are GOOD!! I love chorizo anyway, and this is such a simple recipe. Had guests over the weekend and everyone raved.

Holy Cr@p are these good!!! If my appetite were large enough, I'd stuff four of 'em down my gullet. As it is I can only fit one in there. Do yourself a favor and make these for breakfast one weekend. You won't regret it.
