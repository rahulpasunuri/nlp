This sald was very nice for a summer picnic. Very simple and quick to make. (I omitted the sunflower seeds) Be aware if you make it in advance the vegetables will lose their bright green color and wilt a little, although it will be just as tasty!

This recipe was so easy to make! I served it as a cold side dish for easter dinner and got rave reviews from my family! I will use this recipe for summer barbeques and quick dinners. Keeps well in the fridge too!

This side dish is great at room temperature. It is good for picnics and cookouts. I've served it with grilled fish as well as meat and it goes well. It is easily prepared and it's nice that it can be made in advance, chilled, and then brought to room temperature.
