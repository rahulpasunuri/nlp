I rarely write reviews, but this is one recipe that I cannot get out of my mind. It is DELICIOUS! The flavors are fantastic and comforting, making it perfect for a cold day. For those who said that it was chunky, I found that I had to blend the mixture much longer, but it's worth it!

Delicious and simple to prepare. I used 2 bags of baby carrots and olive oil instead of butter. To the reviewer who thought it was too chunky, blend more. I was surprised by how long I needed to blend with the immersion blender. Also, I used a spice grinder to make the dukkah mixture.

Roasting the carrots added a subtle deliciousness that was well worth the hassle. A regular carrot soup can be surprisingly good, and this version is probably the best ever. The Dukkah spice mix adds a nice touch, although I found that my food processor did not break down the seeds enough, leaving little bits to get stuck in my teeth. Pulverizing in a mortar might be better.

Meh, it was OK. The spices were good but the soup itself wasn't smooth enough.

I was surprised that a recipe so simple could taste this great. I will continue to roast carrots for all my carrot soup variations, rather than boil them.

This is heavenly. I have never tasted a carrot soup with so much nuance and things to like about it. I would make this again in a heartbeat.

Made with walnuts as suggested by another reader. Excellent, easy soup.

So simple to make and such complex results. Fabulous. I used walnuts in place of pistachios. Other recipes for dukkah use hazelnuts so pistachios aren't vital. I served this with a cheddar and apple galette (I'm vegetarian) and it was a great combination.

This was delicious! A tasty vegetarian meal with loads of flavor. The spice mix is easy to make, but I did have an issue with the peppercorns not grinding in my mini-prep cuisinart. I served the soup with naan bread and a green salad.

I saw the picture of this soup and I knew I had to make it. How could something with such a beautiful bright orange color be bad? I made the spice mixture a few days in advance and there was plenty left over for another batch of soup. I recommend a food processor or chopper rather than a mortar and pestle because I had a few unpleasant chunks of black peppercorn that could have been avoided with a finer chop. Other than that, the soup was rich, flavorful, elegant yet simple, and incredibly good for you. What's more to ask for? We had it for a weeknight meal, but it would be perfect for company too. Roasting the carrots truly does bring out the sweetness and flavor. Love it!

I made this tonight. My teenage son and his friend loved it. I love the crunchiness of the dukkah spice. And the flavor is so yummy! I used roasted salted pistachios I had on hand as well. They worked very well. I just tried the spice in olive oil as a pesto dip for crusty bread. It is very tasty. I will definitely make this again and use the spice mixture as a rub for grilled meats. YUM!

The written recipe (from Bon Appetit) says 1 inch pieces for the carrots). The soup is delicious and easy. Used salted/roasted pistachios on-hand so left out the salt in the Dukkah Spice - will make again!

2 lbs of carrots cut into "what"?, strips, chunks, small chop, etc, but yes, I will make it.
