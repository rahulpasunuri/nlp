I rarely give 4 forks, but this recipe deserves it. It's a nice refreshing salad that's really simple to make. Would be great for a potluck in the summer, or for lunch on a pita. I used leftover turkey breast instead of smoked turkey and thought it tasted great. Next time maybe I'll get smoked turkey from my deli to try.

One of my favorites! I have tried this recipe with either turkey or chicken and both are great. I put less celery in and more raisins. I have given this to my young kids and they love it but of course I cut down the curry to 2/3 tbs instead of 1 so it isn't as strong.

I make this recipe often in the summertime. It is excellent in pita for a quick lunch! I always substitute dried cranberries for the raisins, and toasted pine nuts for the almonds. Delicious, and most importantly...easy!

I just took this dish to a potluck and received rave reviews! Many of the people there asked for the recipe. And, best of all, it was really simple to make.

I could practically live on this during the summer! I recently tried this with some really good quality mesquite-smoked turkey breast, and it was even better. Also, the toasted almonds definitely are a worthwhile addition. I've taken this to potlucks, and it's just devoured! Definitely a keeper.

Easy and awesome. Great for a summer luncheon or a pot-luck. Of course I took the advice of another and substituted MI dried cherries for the raisons.

YUM! What a great summer meal! Served it in toasted pita bread pockets and had enough left-overs for brown bag lunches the whole week. My husband and I both really liked this and I will definitely make again. I think it would taste good with cubed chicken as well.

For the sauce, I did 1/2 Tablespoon of curry powder instead of 1 tablespoon, then I also added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon (to taste). This added a little kick that offset the curry powder. The salad got good reviews at the party - and all of it was gone by the end! Was very easy to make - will make it again.

Have made this salad on several occasions and have always received rave reviews. I have substituted dried cherries or cranberries for the raisins. Excellent! The salad tends to get really juicy on 2nd day. Perhaps not adding the dressing until one is ready to serve would keep that from happening;or maybe leaving the cantaloup out until the last moment.

I've made this salad for years but subsituted chicken for turkey. I also use both red and green grapes and don't use the raisins. Very delicious.

Book group loved this. served as substitute for "turkey curry buffet" so often mentioned in Bridget Jones's Diary. Used red grapes (green not available) and salad was very colorful.

THis receipe seemed to make a HUGE amount of salad! It was delicious, very attractive, and so easy for a brunch. I used low-fat versions of mayo, sour cream and yogurt. I would imagine you could use non-fat and have a real healthy dish! Toasting the almonds is a must. I used sliced like the recipe said, but I think slivered would be better.

I made it for coworkers and was a total success. The ingredients work so well together.
