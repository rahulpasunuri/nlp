40 minutes to boil potatoes? After 40 minutes, they will be soup. 20-25 minutes,

I used some artisanal olive oil from my mother-in-law - and wow, exceptionally tasty potatoes. My husband was skeptical, but he was completely won over and I found him in the kitchen trying to recreate them on his night to cook. :) I hated telling him how easy they are to make!

Delicious! I used some locally grown/pressed olive oil and a small shallot for amazing potatoes! I recommend adding a bit as you mash and a bit of the cooking water for a smoother outcome.

Very good, easy and different. I added chicken stock as fluid & some potato water.

An absolutely amazing way to serve that wonderful tuber. Some changes though. Instead of water use Chicken Broth, and cut the potatoes into smaller cubes. Instead of breaking your arm mashing them put them through a food mill, then add the olive oil and reserved chicken stock as necessary. Use it as a bed to serve chicken breasts stuffed with Asiago cheese, chopped spinach and shallots. You will certainly receive Kudos.

I Thought this dish was elegant and delicate. I don't think that potatoes always have to have garlic and strong flavors. Extra Virgin Olive oil has so much flavor. Maybe the dished some of the readers made it with were over powering the potatoes. This was great and it reminded me that simple is still great!

My youngest is allergic to milk/dairy so I made this dish so everyone could eat mashed potatoes at dinner. While no substitute for traditional mashed potatoes, it's okay. I imagine it would be rather bland had I not sauteed some garlic in the olive oil for a bit and added it as another reviewer had suggested. Even then it was still lacking in flavour. I'll make it again for sure, but more out of necessity than anything else.

Wonderful! I also sauted chopped garlic in part of the oil as reviewer below. Also added a bit of parmesan cheese I wanted to use up.

Instead of adding all of the oil in one go, I put about a third in a separate pot and sauted three cloves of minced garlic. Add the garlic before it browns. I also added two tablespoons of dill that I had in the fridge. Tastes excellent, especially considering that it requires so few ingredients and is dairy free. I will surely make this again

This seemingly simple idea of using EVOO instead of butter drove me to distraction after reading it and prompted me to make the whole menu (Braised Chicken w/ White Wine & Garlic/Catalan Spinach). It is ideal with that meal and I imagine many other dishes as it bridges the gap between Mediterranean flavors and good old American comfort food. I used a lusciously creamy Greek oil but it would be interesting with a fruitier, spicier one too. Just don't do as I did and add too much water to the potatoes while reheating--while trying to reduce them, each time I would stop stirring for a split second a steam geyser would form and send potato napalm hurtling at my face. I had to eat dinner with one hand while the other held an ice cube to my nose.
