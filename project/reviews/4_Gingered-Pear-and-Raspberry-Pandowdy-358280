I made this dish for a small get together with friends for the Oscars, and it was the hit of the evening. My boyfriend said it was the best dessert I have ever made, which is huge praise. It is a snap to make. Next time I might add a bit more ginger, but it is divine as is.

delicious I used a 12inch skillet and spread the dough over the top.

besides the biscuit topping, this recipe could not be easier and even that was pretty foolproof. i'm definitely not the meticulous baker type so i was pleasantly surprised that with minimal effort, it still turned out light and moist. overall, it was well balanced b/w sweet and tart with a hint of spice. if you don't cut the ginger pretty small, you might get little "surprises" but since it's crystallized, it isn't as spicy as one might expect. it was a big hit at a recent dinner party.

Made this on Saturday. It was fabulous. Grocery was out of candied ginger so I made my own -- found a recipe on line - very simple. Will make this again for more company this weekend. Delicious!!! Ginger a really nice addition to crust.

This is an easy and wonderful recipe, even with suboptimal pears! I made this in a 10" skillet and didn't have any spillage problems (though I did use an old cookie sheet underneath for saftey).

This is a delightful fall recipe. The raspberry, pear, and ginger flavor combination is the perfect combo of sweet, tart, and spicy. This is also probably one of my favorite crusts--light, flaky, and buttery. And very easy to make. A few tips/notes: I made this in an 8x8 baking dish, as I don't have a 9" cast-iron or pie pan. It worked just fine. I agree that a cookie-sheet underneath is a smart idea. The filling bubbles over a bit. For the crust, if you're like me and don't have a food processor, I recommend freezing the butter and then grating it into the flour. Its a great way to make small pea-sized bits of flour by hand. Also, I cut the crust into 4 squares instead of placing it on top as one big sheet. I didn't trust it to hold together. The pieces blended together well in the oven, so it came out with a solid top crust. Saves a bit of mess and effort too.

I just made this recipe and I LOVED it! It was easy to make and tasted fantastic. The candied ginger in the pastry was a very nice accent to the sweet pears and tart raspberries. I used Irish butter in the pastry for some extra richness and it was heavenly.

I thought this was an excellent recipe! Although, I also recommend that you also put a cookie sheet underneath (if you are using a deep-dish pie pan). The juices from the raspberries overflowed and made a mess of my oven. The ginger in the top crust is a superb ingredient and pefectly matches with the pears and raspberries. I used fresh raspberries that I picked myself, and I also added a dab of bourbon vanilla in the center of the fruit mixture. I will end up making this many times.....it is sooooooooooo good=)
