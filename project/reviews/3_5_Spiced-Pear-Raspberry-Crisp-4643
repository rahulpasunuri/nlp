this recipe was delicious. if cardamom is a new spice to you i would suggest going a little lighter with the proportions and the whipped cream topping is a must for balancing out the flavors. otherwise, follow the recipe and you cant go wrong!

Made this recipe for a pie party and it was a total hit! Cardamom is one of my favorite spices, and goes really well with the ingredients; however, I will cut the cardamom next time as it was a bit too strong of a flavor. I also used Earth Balance instead of butter so it would be dairy free, and the topping was delicious!

We LOVED this recipe. It is perfect for fresh summer raspberries that are a little too ripe to eat plain. I made it with Anjou pears and baked for 40 minutes. The pears were soft but didn't lose their texture.

I've made it twice now, once with bosc pears and once with plain old everyday bartlett pears. Both times it came out great. The berries totally cook away, leaving their color and flavor behind, but the pears stayed more-or-less intact. Be sure not to dice the pears too fine. I also cut back on the cardamom in the fruit mixture the second time and preferred the result.

I was shocked to see the other comment on this recipe. I just looked it up because it was so good. I made it 2 years ago in a pinch at Christmas time and all enjoyed it. Unlike the previous comment, the flavors were terrific and I usually do not like cardamom but with the lemon and raspberry I found it delicious. I will be making this again this Christmas. Instead of an 8x8 pan- I used a larger one.

Terrible. The pears (I used barely ripe Bosc) were completely overpowered by the berries in appearance, texture, and taste, and the entire filling turned into a thick soup, with no separate pieces of fruit visible. Plus there was way too much filling here for an 8" square pan--try a 9x13" pan! Basically this turned out to be an expensive, viscous liquid fruit mess, with the flavor of cardamom (which I normally like, but here found sickening) the only obvious flavor. The topping was okay, though.
