This has become a staple at Christmas morning breakfast for our family. It's easy - can be prepared the day before - and a good pairing with either scones or a larger brunch menu.

I tried this recipe because I wanted to try a Poached Pear w/o wine. Everybody at Thanksgiving agreed that it didnt have much flavor (very subtle) and that Pepin's recipe with wine was MUCH better. I will not be doing this recipe ever again, obviously.

This is delightful for breakfast or brunch on special occasions. I've made this many times and have reconstructed the recipe as follows. I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup. I use a mix of red pears and bosc pears. I also substitute half the apricots with prunes. I add 1/4 cup goji berries and the zest of 1/2 an orange. A sprinkle of fresh lemon juice adds a nice fresh taste!

I took the advice of other reviewers and poached the pears for more like 8-10 minutes, they came out perfect. I did not use apricots (because I hate them!) but followed the recipe exactly otherwise and I thought it was tasty but a little too sweet for my liking. If I make it again, I will maybe reduce the sugar or figure out some other way to make the reduction less sweet.

The pears do need to be poached longer than 5 minutes... so at the 5 minute mark I took out the dried fruit and continued to let the pears cook another 10 minutes. There was enough of the flavor of the dried fruit in the poaching liquid to get into the pears, but by taking them out early they stayed bright and didn't get anemic and too mushy.

I didn't have all the ingredients on hand but had to use a bunch of fresh pears before they became overripe. So I substituted dried pears instead of apricots and fresh cranberries instead of dried cherries. I also added a few slices of fresh ginger and an extra clove or two. The dried and fresh pears in the same dish added a nice theme but I agree that I will use a little less sugar next time...

I didn't have dried apricots so I just doubled the Cherries. I served it with a dollop of mascarpone. It was a delicious and light dessert.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I doubled it and also served each person a whole pear, instead of the recommended half pear. I think its nicer that way. I would also reduce the amount of sugar by 1/4 to 1/2 next time as the over sweetness seems to detract from the essence of the tea and spice. Nice dessert, and everyone enjoyed it.

Easy to make, very tasty, guests loved it - what's not to like? Next time I make it I will put the cloves in a tea ball - we didn't enjoy picking them out of the dishes or our mouths.

This was a light, satisfying dessert. The only change I made was to sub. cranberries for the cherries, and was pleased with the outcome; they added a nice tart contrast to the sweetness of the pears & reduction. We served with a dab of vanilla ice cream on top, et voila! Nummers.

This was wonderful dish. My only adjustment was to the cooking time - after five minutes my pears were still very hard, I cooked the pears (turning occasionally) for 20 minutes.

Very nice, and I'm not a tea fan. Great presentation as well. I used half Splenda, half sugar with excellent results. I had to simmer the pears a bit longer than suggested. Watch out that you don't do it too long, or your dried fruit will look anemic. Also took a bit longer to reduce syrup.

Although quick and easy to make, it didn't really bowl us over that much. I'd give it another chance, but wouldn't rush back too quickly.

I used Splenda instead of sugar and it still came out great. I served it in stemed dessert bowls and it looked and tasted great! This is a super dessert for those of us on low carb, no sugar diets. There aren't to many choices that fit that bill!!!

Excellent light dessert, made in minutes. The bergamot scent falls in behind the cloves. Very nice.

This was a good, simple (fat-free) dessert, although my pears weren't quite ripe and it probably would have been a lot better if they were. I'm not a big tea fan, but the juice took on a nice, not too sweet flavor. Probably not something I'd make for company, but good for a weeknight.
