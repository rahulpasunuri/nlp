This is family favorite. These potatoes even impress guests :) I've found that the potatoes aren't really crispy if I use coated or no-stick baking sheets. Much better when roasted on aluminum sheets.

This has become a regular with our Easter ham. We like things spicy, and add a little extra cayenne.

I did this as a starch for the beer-marinated flank steak with aji and guacamole from this site. Very simple. Do not overdress. You only need a misting as the flavors are piquant. Raves on it. Simple and it tarts it up nice.

Only giving this 3 stars because there are so many great ways to cook potatos - however this is definately one I will be keeping in rotation when I want something different with a little kick. Added minced garlic to the butter, and would of added shallots if I had them. Otherwise followed exactly, and I always have these things on hand. Will be making again for sure.

This was fine. Nothing special. I felt like the great crunch of the potatoes was diminished when we added the sauce (which was very nice as another component).

Simple to make and very tasty. My wife said they were the best potatoes she has ever had. I will be making again soon.

I got rave reviews from my three dinner companions about these potatoes. This is also good with a bit of garlic added to the butter. Can't wait to make again.

this recipe didn't have as much flavor as i expected. i thought i would get some tangy flavor with the vinegar and mustard. not so. too much butter as well.

want to serve your husband something healthy but he's on to you? just throw in these taters. holy cow. if there ever was a key to a man's heart, this recipe is it. started making these years ago. they are a sure fire hit every time. even when paired with the dreaded healthy meal involving "exotic" ingredients such as "fish" or "tofu". make sure to use parchment when roasting.

These are absolutely delicious! I made them 3 nights the week I discovered the recipe! And my kids (4 & 7) love them minus the "deviled" butter --- I simply set a few of the crunchy, salty potato wedges aside for them before I add the spicy butter! Easy and delicious!

I LOVE these potatoes! I have already made them 3 times and I discovered the recipe a week ago! My kids love them too -- minus the spicy butter. I just set a few potatoes aside for them before I add the "deviled" butter.

BE SURE NOT TO USE A GLASS CASSEROLE DISH!!! I (stupidly) did and pouring room temperature potatoes into a 475 degree pyrex dish practically resulted in an explosion of hot, broken glass. This recipe should have a warning for stupid people like me.

The ingredients in this recipe add a nice flavorful twist to otherwise ordinary roasted potatoes.

My fiance loves these potatoes! They are a unique way to prepare an old standby. Very tasty.

Excellent! I used 4 medium sized Yukon Golds cut into 8ths. They came out crispy and brown on the outside and lusciously smooth on the inside. I wondered about the kosher salt - would it be enough or too much, but it was just right. Little bits of flavored salt explode in your mouth. Mmmm! The sauce could be adapted to include any spice combination. I liked the cayenne, but I would caution others that it can be very assertive. In my case, I would tone it down next time to be more complimentary - it sort of stole the show next to my filet mignon with rosemary-vermouth sauce. Nevertheless, this one's going into my "keeper" file.

I loved these tators! I used mini Yukons, too. Two things. 1) If you have trouble with the potatoes sticking to the pan at first when you attempt to flip, just let them sit on top of the stove for a few minutes and they will un-stick a little bit. 2) I made day before event, and put the lid on the container while still warm. This turned my perfect crispy pillows a little bit wrinkley-looking and a little less crisp... so don't make the same mistake. Let them cool all the way before putting a lid on, if you make ahead.

I just love this recipe, ive made it twice in two weeks, turning the potatoes in the middle is a bit intensive and also burns my fingers, so im going to try to just cut them in half next time.

Fantastic! Used large Yukon Gold potatoes cut into 8ths, added pepper, and tripled the cayenne. Even with the extra cayenne they were spicy but not hot. A new favorite.

Great counterpoint if making with the creamed spinach. I used Yukon golds as suggested by another reader, cut into wedges.

The sauce is nicely piquant, but not overwhelming. A definite winner.

Roasty outside, pillowy inside. Vinaigrette is just the right touch. Exquisite with smallish Yukon Gold potatoes.

Rating: 3
Very good, and vinagrette is nice addition to delicious roast potatoes and not overpowering. We roasted potatoes in more standard cooking manner while roast beef cooked, and were still great- cutting into wedges and turning over half way through cooking time results in lovely golden brown wedges.

My husband devoured these potatoes. I added a bit of chopped shallots and garlic (leftover from another dish I was making) towards the end of the roasting. The potatoes got nice and crusty. Yum.
