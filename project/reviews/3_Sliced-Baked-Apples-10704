This is an excellent baked apple recipe. Slicing the apples means they cook through, absorb the flavoring, and are easier to eat. I prefer Applejack to rum, but have made it without either with good results. The liquor gives the sauce more depth.

This is a quickie desert that I often prepare for my husband and myself on movie night. Served with vanilla ice cream, it's sweet, satisfying and simple. Can't beat that!

So, I baked the apples the recommended amount of time and I ended with fairky mushy set of apples. I would recommend a shorter baking time

This recipe is very easy to do if you own an apple/peeler/corer/slicer device (The Pampered Chef sells them). It looks great and tastes wonderful too. A very impressive dessert.
