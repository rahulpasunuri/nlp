Too much effort for the end result. Everyone enjoyed the dish, but it was not incredible.

Enjoyed this very much. Did the following modifications: wine was cabernet-merlot, only had 4.25 lbs of oxtail, did not use butter at all, browned oxtails using broiler instead, did not cook veggies to soften, left out onion by accident, used only one large leek, did not use parsley stems. Cooked in crockpot on hi for 2 hours, then low for 4 hours. Served over egg noodles. Delicious, will make again for sure!

Used only 2lb oxtail (single tail) and halved everything else. With mashed potatoes, it was more than enough for me and my husband, with leftovers.

Lovely dish -- the sauce is rich, deep, and syrupy. Six pounds of oxtail sounds like a lot, but it's not. So don't reduce the recipe by half! I thought about it myself, but decided to make the entire recipe because of the reviews. I'm glad I didn't cut it in half. Everyone loved it, even my picky sister. Perfect for a rainy Bay Area night like tonight!

I love this recipe. I'm from the Carribean and grew up eating oxtail in stews. One day, I decided I wanted to tip my hat to my background while making something that was more fine dining than delicious ethnic. This recipe was amazing. It had a rich, complex flavor and the red wine reduction was impressive. Overall,I think it made more of an impression than even braised short ribs usually do, probably because is unusual to be fed oxtail at a fancy dinner party. I thought it was a lot of work, which is fine with me, so I only make it for special occasions. I think that the person who compared it to oxtail stew is mistaken to compare it to a stew. It's not.

We found that the recipe on the following site is better than this one. The stew is more tasty and includes vegetable sand potatoes and is therefore more fulling. http://simplyrecipes.com/recipes/oxtail_stew/

This is a great recipe that I have tuned in to my personal taste. I work with a local meat supplier to obtain large, high quality oxtails cut into two inch pieces. It takes a great deal of time to trim them, but well worth it. I season the oxtails and brown them on a 600 degree grill instead of browning them in butter. It is a good opportunity to add a layer of flavor and reduce the fat content of the dish. I substitute rosemary for thyme. Be careful not to use too much. I make my own rich brown veal stock in place of the beef broth. When I plate it up, I put the celeriac puree in the center, one oxtail on either side, steamed buttered asparagus crossing in the center and topped with candied white pearl onions. Don't forget to ladle the sauce over the oxtails and around the plate. Cheers! Rick

Fall of the bone delicious. I make this every winter and my husband and guests love it. I tastes like you worked in the kitchen all day, but it's just a one pot wonder. Don't stress about the wine reduction. You really can't go wrong. I've made this dish with big oxtail, little oxtail, halved the recipe and doubled it and it comes out great every time. Served over polenta and it was perfect. Great winter meal.

I agree with rmidd, two bottles is a lot. I follow a similar recipe that calls for one bottle and some beef stock. One bottle minus a glass or so is delicious. The recipe I often use also calls for a few cloves.. gives a complex and delicious flavor. It is otherwise very similar to this one and one of my all-time-favorites. The author of my recipe also suggests mash, but I think au-gratin goes better. A little integrity of the potatoes goes well the delicious melt-in-your-mouth braise. Will not rate because I did not follow this exact recipe.

It made me a little sad to pour 2 bottles of wine anywhere outside of my glass, but the recipe was very good. The meat was tender and delicious. Takes some time to make, but worth trying at least once.

Very tasty, but time consuming. Watch your wine, I burned mine and had to do it over. Also the crockpot makes it much easier. Everyone who tasted it thought it was wonderful, and it was.

A bit of work to do the reducing and straining but boy is it delicious!

Excellent stew recipe! I followed previous reviewer suggestions and roasted the oxtails in the oven at 400 degrees for about 45 minutes instead of browing on the stovetop. This was much easier and cut down on the mess while browning the meat very nicely while prepping the remaining ingredients. I also used the crock pot instead of roasting in the oven; putting the reduced wine and stock in the crock pot with the oxtails and sauteed vegetables and herbs for 5-6 hours on high. Make this a day ahead and refrigerate the meat separately from the stock. This will allow you to skim the fat before re-heating the dish. I used the wine I had on hand - good bottles of Syrah and Shriaz instead of Burgundy - which were very good. The dish was great, but reminded us of an excellent pot roast using chuck roast. Perfect if you want to serve something unusual that many will enjoy!

This was a terrific dish. I only had half the oxtails so reduced the other ingredients accordingly. BIG MISTAKE! Make the full amount of sauce. You won't regret it.

Excellent! Very rich and delicious. I found the cooking time needed to be increased quite a bit... but the results where well worth the wait.

Excellent recipe. I would advise doing the day before and remove meat from liquid. Very easy to remove (lots of) congealed fat next day. I floured meat before browning, which helps thicken the sauce in the end. I also added sauteed carrots and mushrooms at the end. Maybe my version wasn't as elegant, but it tasted great.

Reduce, reduce, reduce, reduce ... and just when I thought I was done, I had to reduce some more! But was it worth it? YOU BETCHA! I simplified the recipe by browning the tails in the oven at 400º, while I reduced the wine & sautéed the vegs on the stovetop. Then, I tossed everything into my slowcooker for 5 hours where it cooked, attention-free. ITA with another cook here who said that 'homemade beef broth is worth the time & effort'. I couldn't find a single brand of beef broth that didn't contain sugar, corn syrup or MSG - none of which belong in beef broth. When cooking time was up, I strained the cooking liquid into my new OXO fat separator which I have found to be indispensable when cooking any braised, fatty meat, as there's no need to refrigerate the liquid to easily skim the fat. This recipe is a real winner - something I'd definitely make again for my husband & myself or for oxtail-loving guests on a cold, autumn night. It's full of deep, rich flavors & as I said before, it's worth the effort. I served this with cauliflower puree & buttered green beans.

Excellent. I prefer to brown the oxtails in olive oil & use butter for finishing the sauce. Make a day ahead so the fat can be removed before you do the second reduction. My family raved.

A terrific dish. As with most braised dishes the key is the braising liquid. Home made beef broth clearly is worth the time and effort in the result it produces. The butcher I used offered to cut the ox tails in a double thickness which I did not do. The ox tails held together well even though a thinner cut. Next time I would try the double thick tails. I prepared these the day before so that it was possible to remove most - but not all of the fat. I would strongly recommend this as the dish is better the next day so long as you reheat gradually to avoid having the meat come off the bones.

If I could give more than four forks I would! We all loved this dish. The sauce is so good that I'm using the leftovers on another dish. Reducing the wine at the start, straining out the solids and reducing again at the end gave the loveliest, rich sauce. And, because the vegetables just got a coarse chopping, this dish was a snap to prepare. We were going out to a wine tasting with dinner back at home so I got it cooked and removed the meat from the sauce. Then several hours later, I gently reheated the meat in the microwave and reduced the sauce. To a reviewer who complained of the fattiness, that's just the nature of the oxtail "beast." It may not be to everyone's liking but on that cold, wintery night, it was a hit with us.

I found that roasting the bones in a 400 oven for 45 min to brown them (turning over once @ 20 min) works better than in batches. Plus you get the added incentive of using just one pan (after removing oxtails you use two burners to saute the veggies). Julia Child does this for her beef stock and I have always found that this method works easier. The dish turned out superb, but only because I spent mucho denero for the wine.

Rating: 2
Too much work for what this turned out to be. I used oil, less than called for, and drained the pan after browning the oxtails to get rid of all the fat that came out of them. The dish was still pretty fatty and just failed to excite.

As the last reviewer noted, the recipe could use some bacon or porkfat -- which is exactly what Marcella Hazan's recipe for braised oxtail calls for. And I can attest that Marcella's version is fantastic.

Good, but not as great as all the other reviews suggested. Perhaps bacon fat or chopped bacon would be a nice addition.

I made one-and-a-half times this recipe for 9 people. I wasn't able to buy only large pieces of oxtail, which was fine. Browning 10 lbs. of oxtails took me an hour and a half, and prepping the vegetables took my efficient friend the same amount of time. But - oh my - it was worth it! I did not bother to sieve the sauce, and the finely chopped vegetables in the sauce added pleasant texture (but I wished I had used only the leaves of thyme and parsley). A few guests had trouble cutting the meat from the bones - maybe 3-1/2 hours wasn't quite enough. Boiled Yukon Gold potatoes and roasted cherry tomatoes sprinkled with mint went well with it - a simple menu to make ahead.

This marks the first time we've had oxtails. While I prefer braised short ribs, this was an excellent dish. DH thought it worthy dinner-party fare, which is the highest honor he bestows. The only changes I made were I sued only a bottle and a half of wine, and substituted chicken broth for the beef broth. The meet was not totally submerged but came out amazingly tender, no different from the pieces that were submerged. Cooking time was 3 hours 15 minutes in a very large All Clad braiser. After straining and defatting the sauce, I added the meat back in to heat for serving. We served this with garlic-mashed potatoes, and a first course of Squash Ravioli with Sage Cream Sauce, and dessert of Banana Ravioli (we use puff pastry) with Vanilla Custard sauce.

Try making this dish using port wine instead. Also, add 3-4 cloves and 2-3 star anise to the recipe. The aroma of this ' revised' finish product is unreal and the taste is heavenly!! Can stir in additional sauteed button mushrooms and pearl onions for additional enhancement.

Very tender and delicious. I braised for 3hrs, separated meat, chilled the liquid, skimmed it, then combined the two again on the re-heat for another hour. I then reduced the sauce to serve along side. Excellent. One problem - the burgandy turned our teeth/mouth purple in addition to the meat!

This was superb. I had gravy/sauce left over and have frozen it to use with salisbury steaks or other quick meals that don't make enough of a gravy. Three of us polished it off.

Oh my goodness!! This recipe is just wonderful!!! Braised stove top for three hours, then separated the meat from the liquid and refridgerated overnight. Skimmed the fat off the liquid and combined with meat again and braised for another three hours. My guests were raving! Served with mashed potatoes.

I made this dish for my sister's birthday and got rave reviews. I made this dish twice, once with home-made beef stock from scratch and the other from the can. Considering the time it takes to make your own stock, i found that canned stock is just as good. Definitely use two bottles of red wine and your meat will be succulent and the sauce will be rich and flavourful.

This was a great recipe. The meat was so tender & flavorful. I think the recipe would be just as good if you cut back on the red wine & beef broth. I found it to be too much. Also, I did not discard all the vegetable solids as it suggested. I mixed it up with some orzo & it was delicious as a side dish!!

Great flavor and not too difficult. I made it "stove top" and didn't have all the correct veggies called for, so, substituted. I didn't have carrots but added bell pepper and some green onion. I also don't care for Bergundy ( too sweet for me) I used a dry red Merloit and everything tasted great. I think this is a very forgiving recipe.....as long as you follow the sauce reduction.

This dish sure gave a new meaning to oxtail stew. the flavor was great,the meat fell off the bone.we prefer this over the conventional oxtail stew.

Turned out amazing - my first oxtail preparation ever! I also cooked it on a slow simmer on the stove. I did make a few other adjustments that I thought worked well: I used rendered bacon fat instead of butter and added a touch of balsamic vinegar near the end of the cooking. Also, the sauce was a little too thin for my liking, so after reducing it a bit towards the end, I also used a beurre manie. One suggestion: do not skimp on the wine - use at least 2 full bottles for this amount of oxtail (it is worth it in the end).

I made a few changes to this fantastic dish. First, I do it all on the stove, at the lowest possible setting for a bare simmer. Also, I make it a day ahead so that I can chill and skim the cooking liquid. Then reduce, and gently reheat the oxtails. When it's done the meat falls off the bones, and removing the bones before serving makes this more appealing to first-time oxtail eaters.
