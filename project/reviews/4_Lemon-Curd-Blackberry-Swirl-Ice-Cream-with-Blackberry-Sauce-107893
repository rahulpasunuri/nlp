Even though I followed the recipe exactly and it all went fine, the finished ice cream just tasted like eggs to me. Lemon was completely overshadowed. I'll try with 4 yolks instead of 8 next time. Guests were polite, though one asked me "what's that extra flavor?" Um, scrambled egg? Also, would recommend the way I usually make ice cream base, thicken with less than the full amount of cream and/or milk, then after removing from heat, stir in the rest (cold). This chills the custard more quickly than the ice bath used here, and keeps it from possible overcooking.

Most delicious. Picked fresh blackberries and wanted to try something new. This worked well and I would make it again.

This is absolutely wonderful. I simply used the blackberry mixture to top it. Chilling it overnight is called "aging" - it improves the smoothness, body, and texture. (Not necessary but worth the time.)

I have been making this recipe and derivations of it for years. I have tried lime curd (straight lime juice) and grapefruit (half lemon/ half grapefruit) and orange curd (1/3 lemon and 2/3 orange). My only hesitation in mentioning the orange curd is that it tastes a little bit too much like a Dreamscicle, which I like but homemade ice cream should taste like homemade, so I suggest infusing the milk/heavy cream with a spice that goes with oranges. (Culinary Artistry by Dornenberg and Page lists cardamom.) In conclusion, I have tried other creme anglaise bases but none compared to the smooth mouth feel of this one.

This was really good. I did make a few changes - did not chill the custard overnight, and had no problems with getting the ice cream to set. I also did not do the whole complicated pan thing to make the swirl - I simply swirled the blackberry syrup into the ice cream with a spoon. Worked beautifully, and cut down a ton of time!

I totally messed up making this recipe, but it still turned out great. I love anything lemon or blackberry. Can't wait to try it again to see how good it REALLY is!

I made this for a friend's birthday and am about to make it for a family party. Everyone loved it (of course, you have to like lemon) and it was a nice change from lemon tart.

This is a delightful and refreshing dessert. The combination of the blackberry and lemon are perfect. If you are a lover of lemon and ice cream this is a treasure.
