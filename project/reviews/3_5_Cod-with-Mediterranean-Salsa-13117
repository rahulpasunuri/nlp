The dish was nice, but not altogether satisfying. The salsa was the centerpiece, was tasty, and as several reviewers noted, was salty, but I have no big issue there. The cod part of the recipe, however, was disappointing. There has to be some alternative more creative than cooking fish in really hot oil.

MY HUSBAND LOVED THE SALSA BUT HE HAS A THING ABOUT COD. I THOUGHT THEY WERE BOTH EXCELLENT. I'LL TRY THE SALSA WITH ANOTHER FISH.

I enjoyed this and found it easy to make. I didn't have capers (probably wouldn't use them anyway). It made the cod very special. My guests commented that it was a dish you would expect in a fine dining establishment. they enjoyed it.

Like a couple of others I used a mixture of olives, Kalamata and green Sicilian. In New England ,Scrod can be either cod or haddock, so I felt it was perfectly alright to use haddock in this recipe. It was good !

I guess we took out most of the "mediterranean" because we don't like olives and capers but wow! It was still fabulous! I can't give it 4 forks, though I'd love to for my version, because when you do not prepare the recipe as written, I believe it's not an accurate reflection. Very healthy, clean, fresh and so easy to make. We placed the cod on a white bean puree (sauteed 1 vidalia onion, 4 minced cloves garlic in light olive oil, pureed in a food processor with drained, rinsed white beans; add more oil to desired consistency) and topped with the salsa. So good with various textures and flavors that we agreed it was worth serving to guests. Highly recommend.

I put the fish and salsa into a foil pouch and put it on the grill, indirect high heat until done. Other than that, it, used all ingredients as listed. My husband and I both enjoyed it very much. Plan to make it again before summer slips away and takes the basil in my garden with it!

I will make this dish for company. It was simple and rustic.

Using 1/3rd cup cured black olives (from Bay Cities for the WestSide readers) and a tblsp of rinsed capers adds too much salt to the recipe. The salsa overpowered my cod. Only people who have trained their palates to tolerate obscene amounts of salt will like this dish. If you want to make it anyway, I suggest using fewer olives, more basil, whisk the lemon juice, zest, oil, and add maybe some tomato paste. To cut the salt I might dice up arugala and mix it in.

An eceptionally good recipe, simple and health. The combination of flavors is very refreshing.

Excellent, quick to prepare, used canned tomato and it worked just fine. Family were very pleased with it.

this was ok, but with a good summer tomato i think it would be alot better. my brother loved it and ate the leftovers plain though.

This is very good. My husband and I both really enjoyed it, however my kids didn't like the taste of the olives.

This recipe is very good. I bought frozen cod from Costco and needed ideas of how to prepare it. So I tried this and figured my boyfriend wouldn't love it but he did. And I cut back on olives, as he is not an olive person and he said there should have been more. It is definitely fresh and more than the sum of it's parts.

I think this is a great salsa that would go well on the fish of your choice, or anything else you want. I used only Kalamata olives because I like them, added a little extra tomato, no orange peel and dried basil (only because I didnt have fresh). Served it with feta cheese, orzo and spinach. For me, thats a meal even without the fish.

Very quick, easy, healthy and tasty! Also used a mix of olives and would add more orange zest.

Yum. I really liked this recipe. The cod is a nice, simple taste that pairs well with the salsa. Definitely a quick, healthy weekday meal.

This is a very delicious dish that is not only healthful, but easy to prepare. I made it as written but next time I might try using a mixture of olives as suggested by others. My husband and I both loved it--a definite keeper!

I followed the suggestions of the cooks from Santa Barbara and NYC and used about a third brine cured green olives. In addition I doubled the orange zest and basil. I used striped bass, which I sautéed about a minute and a half on each side and then finished in the oven. My husband raved! And I like how easy it is. Thanks!

This is absolutely delicious! I think it would work to substitute pimiento-stuffed green olive for up to a third of the kalamata olives. I also cut back some on the shallot. This is easy and would make a good "company dinner". Definately a keeper!

I'm with everyone else -the salsa is great, but the cod isn't so interesting. I think the idea of the salsa on swordfish or tuna is perfect. I like cod just fine, but I found it incredibly dull even with this great salsa.

Really liked the salsa, will absolutely make it again. I thought it went wonderfully with the cod; I also used lemon zest. Served it with steamed asparagus, sliced avocados, and honeydew melon. Poured a nice, crisp Sauvignon Blanc. Delicious...

I really liked the recipe. I used swordfish based on all the comments below. I also added green olives with the Kalamata since I am a huge olive lover. I also substitued the orange zest w/ lemon since lemon was being used.

The salsa was wonderful. The cod with the salsa was okay. I will definately make the salsa again and put it on pita chips, baguette slices, cold veggies, etc.

My 3-fork rating is for the salsa, which is wonderful. However, its flavors are much too assertive for cod, and completely overwhelm the delicate taste of the fish. I think the salsa would be terrific with a more "gamey" fish-- perhaps grilled tuna.

Easy, excellent, fresh and delicious!

This is a really great recipe. I've enjoyed it so much I almost want to put 4 forks but it's simplicity seems more worthy of 3. The intensity of the flavors are great. I used three types of brine cured olives. Make sure you use fresh fish, and really good quality olives. If you don't have access to good olives skip it I would hate to see this made with anything from a can. Can't wait to make this again.

I've made this twice and both times it was excellent. I used scrod the second time and it tasted similarly. I also went with the lemon zest instead of orange and used a citrus pepper blend instead of black pepper. Really great and easy!!

I followed this recipe to the T. I let the salsa set awhile so the flavors could mingle. On its own, cod is bland. The salsa was DELICIOUS and made the dish memorable. I served the fish and salsa on a bed of lightly dressed fresh arugala from my garden. A "keeper". Would also be nice on grilled chicken.

Very light and tasty...perfect summer dish. I subbed lemon zest for orange. The salsa would be great on pita chips! I served it with Pine Nut and Basil Rice, also from this site.

I cut the fish about 2 inch size.I seasoned the fish with salt, pepper & flour, fried with olive oil, and chilled the fish. After the fish was cold I put the mediterranean salsa sauce. I used the dish as a hors d'oeuvre. It was huge success.

I left out the olives because my family doesn't like them, but I doubled the fresh basil because it looks beautiful and I love the flavor. This salsa is so good I'll use it on other fish as well as pork and chicken. Great, fast and easy recipe!

I got fresh cod, and this was a delightful preparation for it.

I normally don't "keep" three fork recipes because there are so many other good ones out there, but this is fast, healthy, and easy.

This is a delicious way to have a common type of fish. It made the cod very elegant and full of flavor. I used twice as much basil for the salsa since I like the flavor. The key to the whole recipe is to make sure to grill the fish to a golden brown but still moist. Definitely on my most wanted list!
