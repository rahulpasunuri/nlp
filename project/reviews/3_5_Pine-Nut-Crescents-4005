Easy and fancy and delicious! To those whose dough spread - use a scant tablespoon more flour and make sure you're using the whites of large (as opposed to extra large) eggs. I too just dropped the dough onto the pine nuts and rolled them around to shape them.

I make these every year for Christmas, and everyone just loves them. The dough is rather sticky to handle as stated in the recipe. I just drop heaping teaspoon fulls of dough right onto the nuts from the spoon. This really eliminates most of the sticky mess. I usually need about twice the amount of pine nuts as called for.

I tasted these for the first time in Tuscany, and came home searching for a recipe - and this was as delicious! Yes, you should add a bit of extra flour - the dough will still be sticky, that is important...and I also add 1/4 tsp almond extract. Delicious, and always get rave reviews.

I used only one egg white, as suggested by another reviewer. But even with that change the cookies flattened out and became shapeless during the baking process. The next time I make pignoli cookies I will use almond paste rather than ground almonds, but I will not use this recipe.

I made these last night, and discovered that two egg whites made the dough way, way too runny. I added extra flour and the cookies still ran together in the oven. I'd suggest using one egg white. Bake a sample, and if it looks like you need more liquid add a bit of the second egg white. These are for folks who want something different, and enjoy the slightly resinous flavor of pine nuts.

The almond and pine nuts complement each other to form a cookie with exceptional flavor. They were a huge success on my Christmas cookie tray. Do not overbake them
