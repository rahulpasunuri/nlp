Delicious! I too left the clams in the shell for a more interesting presentation. I also added a touch of light cream to the pepper mixture. I have also made the clams on their own and served as an appetizer with crusty bread to "dunk" in the saffron-wine sauce - Yum!

Great dish as it stands but I made a few mods you might consider: 1) I squeezed as much as possible through a fine sieve from the cooking liquid--and reserved the solids for later use in finishing, 2) I cooked the halibut for a minute or so on the second side, as well, before covering with pepper mixture and, 3) Instead of separating clams meat from the shells I kept them intact and placed them on the serving plate that way; so much nicer to slurp them up this way.Delicioso!

The sauce for this was really nice, but a fair amount of work for the end result. Halibut can be kind of bland, and I would try this with grouper or red snapper next time. I would also use canned baby clams, since I used fresh this time and would not notice the difference in the finished dish. Great over linguine.

Definitely very tasty and innovative. You can go a lot of different directions with this dish.

My husband made this dish, served it over spinach linguine and it was excellant! It appealed to the taste buds as well as the eye. It was simple to make with a can of baby clams. We think the fresh herbs are crucial to the taste.

The sauce is simple, elegant and tasty. I used half a 28oz can of clams, but a 6 or 10 oz. can would have sufficed. I will use the rest of the clams, expand the sauce and serve it over linguini. Any mild fish would work in this sauce.

Very nice combination of flavors. Not very difficult. Would be a nice dish for company.
