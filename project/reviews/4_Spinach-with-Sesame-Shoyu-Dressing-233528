I'm sorry, the flavor of the dressing is great, but the presentation of these spinach mounds are terrible.

I made the dressing for this salad and used it with wheat berries, grated carrots, scallions, ginger and garlic. The dressing made the dish exceptional. I did subtitute canola oil for the peanut oil and more than doubled the amount of sesame oil because I didn't have any sesame paste. A definite keeper.

I just made the dressing as written for a regular spinach salad. It was yummy and so easy! The perfect accompaniment to any Asian-style entree. I served it with pork chops that had a peanut sauce. I'm sure a little chopped red pepper and toasted pine nuts would enhance the salad, if desired.

this is a staple in our home and has been for years.i dont use mirin - but rather white wine vinegar and i use a little more soy than asked. also the log thing is ridiculous - i just cooked it rinse with cold water cut up and then form into little patties.

This was fun to serve but you will need a ton of spinach if using fresh. Next time I would season the spinach with a bit of salt. Spinach was a bit bland and the dressing was more watery than I thought it should've been. I was expecting it to be thick enough to coat/cover the spinach. I also thought the dressing lacked sesame flavor. Next time I would use more sesame seeds and cut down the peanut oil and use more sesame oil.

Made the dressing exactly as directed, and simply poured it over cold, cooked spinach. Sprinkled with the toasted sesame seeds. Really delicious.

I rolled frozen spinach and a log did not form, so I shaped small patties and ladled the dressing over them. Excellent and a beautiful green color on the table.

I was very surprised (and disappointed!) when I made this after reading all the good reviews. I believe I followed all the instructions correctly, but I had a very strongly negative reaction to this sauce. My husband thought it was just OK. If you decide to make this receipe, be forewarned.

Great sauce - easy to make. Made it for company and it was great. Followed the recipe exactly. Also you can make a bowl of the sauce and keep it in the fridge to drizzle on individual servings of spinach instead of making the entire 2lbs at once.

Great flavor, the sauce was delicious on its own and as a spread on sandwiches too. I added 2 minced garlic cloves when cooking the spinach, and added a teaspoon of red chili paste to the sauce.

I would be happy if there were no other dresssing in the world. The dressing really brings the spinach flavor to a whole new level! I've actually had this for dessert.

This is the best dressing to wake spinach up in a long time! Great flavors. I subbed fish sauce for the shoyu. I originally made this using frozen spinach, instead of going to the trouble to steam the fresh, and it worked fine. My husband could not get enough of this, so I had to make another batch of dressing...all I had in the way of spinach was canned. We drained it, put it on a plate, not bothering with making the little patties, and poured the dressing on top. It was still delicious, even with the canned! If hubby has his way, I'll be making this weekly! It's very addictive!

Really tasty sauce that adds a lip-smackin' zing to spinach. Don't be afraid of the long list of ingredients - make extra sauce and mix into angel hair pasta for a bonus side dish!
