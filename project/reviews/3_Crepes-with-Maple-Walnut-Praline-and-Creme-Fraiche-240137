Never ever use a pancake mix for a crepe. honestly. Crepes and pancakes are not the same thing. Similar, but not that similar.

Be careful, syrup cooks really fast. Started the pancakes and next thing I knew the praline was burning. So keep a close eye on it. It tasted pretty good, even though it had a slight burned flavor.
