I've made this recipe several times, the burgers are very flavorful and juicy. I really like it. Watch the Dijon, it can be pretty strong if you don't care for it. ( I do, some dont)

I have not made this, but I have a comment for the first reviewer. This recipe calls for ground chuck which is typically 80/20 and these days some times 85/15. At 94% lean, you will always get a poor quality product, but you will be healthy!

It definitely could be because I used ground beef that 94% lean, but I would say that this would make a good meatloaf but not burgers. Mine were crumbly and did not stick together. Also, they cooked through instead of being medium rare the way my family likes them.

a nice recipe that makes for an excellent burger. The sesame buns are critical and do not skimp on the dijon. As it is a relatively-mild patty, stick to the cheddar and avoid sharper cheeses.
