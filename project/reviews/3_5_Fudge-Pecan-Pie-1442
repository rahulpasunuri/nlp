A decadent pie! The next time I make this, I may try either baking it longer or turning the temp up to 375 -- our oven is right on but 40 minutes seemed like it left the middle slightly more liquid than I would have liked (although that's probably a preference as opposed to a recommendation).

I was so excited to try this recipe. I LOVE chocolate and am not sensitive to sweet things but this was so sweet it made my head hurt. It really got in the way of enjoying the chocolate flavor. Love the concept with the pecans but way too sweet. Ick!

This is the perfect fudge pie! Texture and taste (use a good quality chocolate!) couldn`t be better!

this was AWSOME!! I did 4oz of Ghiradelli unsweetened chocolate and used 2 cups of pecans. I added white and milk chocolate chips just before baking. I did bake for about 55min. I was using a gas stove and that made some differance.

I loved this pie. I used a high quality baking chocolate and 2 cups of pecans. Then I added about a cup of chocolate chips to the batter right before I baked the pie. I entered it into a pie contest & won third place (my cappuccino- fudge cheesecake won 1st prize). So give this recipe a try!

This was a hit at my dinner party. I added 4oz chocolate instead of just 3oz. I suggest making sure you make a very thin pie crust - mine ended up too thick (not due to recipe) - because otherwise you lose the wonderful chocolate intensity!

I get requests for this great pie for every dinner party! I use Callebaut (sp?) chocolate for this. Makes for a smoother tasting pie.

This is my new holiday standard. I used an entire bag (2 cups) of chopped pecans (the only change I made), and the result was not only visually lovely, but delicious. Also, I used a ready-made pie crust round - a big time and hassle saver. My sister's comment after sampling this was, "You could sell this!" Rarely am I this enthusiastic about a recipe - just try it!

Made with two cups pecans - no other changes. Heaven!!!

I made it using semi-sweet morsels and walnuts instead of pecans. It was very good!

This was very simple to make. I used semi-sweet chocolate morsels instead of the unsweetened chocolate. It received rave reviews.

This was very good. How can anything be too rich? Just have a smaller serving. Next time I would add more pecans. Even my husband who does not like nuts enjoyed this. Note: This even microwaves well to serve warm for leftovers.

I made the recipe just as written, except that I put a few of the pecans on top for decorative purposes. Next time I will add a little more pecans. This was very good. Even my husband who does not care for nuts enjoyed this. Leftovers microwave well, to warm (did not try for hot).

This was a great pie. I made it twice, the 1st time as directed. It was too sweet for my taste. The 2nd time I cut the sugar by 1/4 cup. That did the trick. Next time I'm going to add a little more chocolate. BTW, I used excellent callebraut(sp) unsweetened chocolate. This one's a keeper! And so easy.

What a wonderful way to end a meal! When I read that this pie was considered too rich for some, I knew this was the recipe for me...really good served warm with fresh whipped cream.

This was quick and easy and absolutely delicious. I made a shortbread pie crust and still made the whole dessert in an hour. It was dense, rich and delicious. Everyone loved it and is already asking for a repeat. Will definitely make it a regular part of my repetoire.

Wonderful. Easy to prepare. Great to make ahead. I've made this a few times and it's always gobbled up. Last time I served in a vanilla wafer crust with homemade vanilla bean ice cream.

This recipe was wonderful! It was very easy to make and was absolutely scrumptious. We served it at Thanksgiving dinner. Okay, so one or two people thought it was too rich, but it is a perfect recipe for a chocolate lover like me.

I made this a second time. The cake never did get to a right consistency. Very pudding like. It was very nice to tast but I think it should have been more pie than pudding. Anyone else getting these results?

This recipe is wonderful.I changed the recipe a bit and added some extra pecans on the top.It tastes just like the kind my Mother makes and I would definitly make it again.

I made this pie for a pecan pie lover, and he loved it. I too browned the butter, and added extra pecan halves to the top.

If you're looking for a rich dessert, this is your recipe. It's so easy to make and I always serve it slightly warmed with vanilla ice cream. I also use an oreo crust for extra chocolate kick. I have received many compliments and have made it several times. Give it a try!

I am a real chocoholic and did not like this pie at all. I would prefer to make a flourless chocolate cake which is much "showier" for a dinner party.

This pie is fabulous!! Browning the butter is a great tip. Thanks. I bet it would be good with some coffee added??

It was pretty easy to make. I varied the recipe by putting all the pecans on top instead of in the filling.

Awesome! I agree.....best warm with vanilla ice cream. Four forks all the way!

I sound like a broken record, but browning butter till golden before adding to any pecan pie makes for a better-still flavour to savour.

Four forks!! Four forks!! This recipe was so unbelievably good that our guests almost fell over when they tried it. Definitely serve warm with either a scoop of good vanilla ice cream or a generous serving of whipped cream. Very easy to make-- one of the best desserts ever!

Very easy to make. The pie turns out very dense in texture and very chocolatey. It definitely needs something like whipped cream or ice cream to cut the intensity.

Fabulous. Super rich.
