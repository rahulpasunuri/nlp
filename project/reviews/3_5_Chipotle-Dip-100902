Great veggie dip - I made for a party and it got rave reviews!

I just made this for a party tomorrow night (love that it can be made 3 days in advance!) --- but my husband and boys have already eaten it! They asked me to make another one for Christmas day. So super easy! Like others, I halved the mayo and doubled the chipotle chiles.

This dip is a true hit at parties. Although I made some additions that really gave it some zest. Definitely use only 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream. Add corn (sauteed in olive oil first until it's a charred color) and also drained black beans, amount to taste. I also threw in a good amount of liquid smoke and it was fabulous! Serve only with Tostitoes - you need the salt to go with the dip.

This continues to be a favorite of mine! I added this to mini-roasted potatoes for a Christmas party again this year and they quickly gobbled up! I made the dip a few days in advance and pipe into mini-roasted potatoes for a delicious party appetizer!

An old favourite now, nearly 7 years since I first reviewed it, and it has become a well- loved standby. I now make it with approximately equal parts sour cream and mayo, thought I've been known to sub homemade yogurt cheese for the sour cream. I always use lime and add some grated lime rind, and sometimes add a garlic clove and occasionally some cilantro. Always delicious! Makes an interesting dressing for potato salad, on burgers, fajitas, pizza, etc. Re the chipotles: I purée the whole can (OK, not the can itself!) and spoon Tbs's of it on a plastic wrap covered plate to freeze the leftovers so they never go to waste and are easy to get at to add to any recipe.

Like most others I did equal parts Mayo and Sour Cream (1/2 cup each). But when it came to the chipotle peppers, either I had gotten very weak peppers or I just like really spicy food, I had to double the amount called for and also tripled the amount of Adobo sauce used. I also added some Cayenne pepper for an extra kick. Turned out really good.

First of all, don't listen to people who alter this by putting other things in it. That's a complete other recipe. We use this for our shrimp cocktail, in place of the red cocktail sauce and it's fabulous.

Agree mayonnaise a little too strong, half mayo half sour cream likely better. Also, tried raw apple to dip - it is great. Next will try making apple chips to accompany. Easy east recipe.

A delicious dip. I make this with equal parts sour cream and mayo (both reduced-fat) and a little extra chipotle. It also needs salt to balance the flavors.

I have made this dip over and over again and have never had anything but raves. I usually add extra chiles but keep everything the same. It is a great dip.

I made this dip for a dinner party - it was a beautiful color but tasted just so-so (and I'd even made it the day before so it had plenty of time for the flavors to mix). It sat and sat and no one really liked it. You should definitely like mayonnaise if you want to make this recipe.

Rating: 3
I didn't have scallions (or ranch mix) so I used a few shakes of Knorr's Leek Soup mix left over from another dip. I also reversed the proportions of mayo to sour cream but ended up adding about 1/4 cup more mayo to balance the flavors. I used a little more chipotle than was called for and it was not too hot for anyone. I'm sure there must be variation between brands. Out of four dips I made, several guests liked this one the best. It's quite addictive!

This is a definite keeper! I have converted many people to spicy food as a result of this recipe - it is now becoming a standard at our parties. I too reversed the amounts of mayo and sour cream and substituted fresh lime juice for lemon. Trader Joe's Savory thin mini crackers are perfect as an alternative to a "tortilla" type chip.

Rating: 3
The flavor of this dip is very good and worth experimenting a bit until it is just right. My first attempt I used equal parts mayo and sour cream. I thought it was too much mayo so next time I will adjust even more like so many others have suggested. I added diced cooked shrimp at the end and it was really good. Served with toasted pita and sliced cucumber and red pepper. I used the amount of chiles in recipe but will add just a bit more next time. A few of my guests thought it was spicy enough but most could have handled more heat.

Just okay. I made some of the changes suggested (ranch dip, change amount of sour cream) and no one commented on it. Of course, that could be why it was just okay! Will probably not make it again.

Excellent! We made this for a party and it was gone literally within minutes! Definite kick, which we love! Many, many people asked for the recipe.

I made this dip for a party of 8. I had 2 other appitizers, but this one was finished up first! I also had changed the mayo/sour cream ratio, added the powdered ranch dressing and added fresh baby shrimp. I served it with freshly made pita chips and it was a smash. Word of caution....this has a definate bite. I had one guest running for water after the first bite (but came back for more!!!) I like spice....but there was no way I could have doubled the chipotle and not have cardiac arrest

Rating: 3
If you are looking for a sour cream based, spicy dip, this is perfect. I also adjusted the sour cream\mayo ratio to taste, and used the another reviewers sugesstion of a little bit of powdered ranch seasoning, it came out like a spicy ranch dip, and it all got eaten. Esspecially good with blanched broccoli and carrots.

Ole! This is a great party dip. I made this to go with the Mini Stuffed Potatoes (also on Epicurious) rather than the topping called for that recipe. Excellent choice. This dip also pairs nicely with the Chili-Lime Tortilla Triangles also from Epicurious.

This dip was excellent. I served it with pita chips and it was enjoyed by all. I used what was leftover the next night on hamburgers and it was even better!

I loved this dip!! I made it for a Mardi Gras parade and party. There were so many other dishes at this party that were so elaborate, but you know, this dip was the first thing to go! Everyone loved it! As other reviewers advised, I switched the amounts of sour cream with the mayo, otherwise, I think the mayo would have been too heavy. Also, living in Louisiana we like things very, very SPICY! Therefore, I used double the amount of chipotle peppers!!!! Very spicy, but oh, so good!! So easy...so good! I love recipes like this!

I made this with equal portions of mayo and sour cream otherwise the mayo was too overpowering. My guests proved it was a good move...none left and many requests for the recipe.

This is an excellent recipe. I used the 3/4 and 3/4 measures on mayo and sour cream and added crumbled bacon on top. I used this dip in the Mini Stuffed Potatoes on this site.

Great crudite dip, cool and spicy.

I'm a long-time fan of that great chipotle flavor. Tried the dip as is with the common change of mostly sour cream, it was good. Then I added some fresh ground pepper, garlic powder, and a dash of salt - it was better. Then, making Emeril proud, I kikced it up another notch, adding some sour cream dip I had already made with Italian salad dressing mix. It really kicked butt!! Don't worry about the pepper seeds, just add the right amount for your taste. Why use healthy vegetables for dipping when Fritos and tortillas are available???? Yum-Yum!!

Rating: 3
Well, this is a pretty good recipe as long as you look at the reviews -- definitely use a minimal amount of mayo (if any) and use mostly sour cream! The first time I made this I used mostly sour cream with about 2-3 T mayo, otherwise as written. Everyone at the party liked it fine. But at the next party, everyone LOVED it when I made it just like before but added a packet of ranch dressing mix to make it Chipolte Ranch Dip. People couldn't get enough! I highly recommend that you try the recipe this way. Also, thanks to the earlier reviewer who suggested freezing the rest of the chiles -- I portioned out several portions worth and now have frozen cubes of chiles ready to go for the next time!

GREAT AND soooo easy! I would definitley make this one again!! Served it with Scoops but it would be good with just about anything.

This is a great dip. I made for a tequila tasting party and served with "Scoops" Fritos (for better scooping) and as others mentioned it was "swarmed" until gone. I had at least 10 people ask for the recipe.

Since I made it the day before my dinner party it was quite hot. So I added some whipped cream cheese and it really seemed to blend well and still be spicy. My guests parked themselves in fron of it and did not move until it was gone!

To all the Canadian Cooks. You can buy chipotles in Adobo sauce at Loblaws. Look in the Mexican food section.

To Jack in Calgary: Patricia below is correct, there is no sub for Chipotles in Adobo (the chilis come canned and packed in the sauce - making it impossible to replicate the sauce). Unfortunately, our fortunate freinds to the South are blissfully unaware of how difficult it can be to get anything ordered online delivered into Canada... An issue I've dealt with many times :-( Chipotles in Adobo can be found at Latin-American groceries and sometimes in the Mexican section of large supermarkets. The best brand for flavour and consistency is San Marcos. There is information on discovercalgary.com on several Latin grocery shops in your city, one is "Boca Loca". Best of luck to you, they REALLY are worth searching out - YUMMY!

To Jack in Alberta. You really can't make this sauce. Go online to order it, it should cost between $3.00/$4.00 U.S. dollars. A little goes a long way (some cans/brands are hotter than others). Freeze left over product up to a year and use when needed. It's flavor is hot, smokey and full. There is no satisfactory replacement.

I really liked this dip! I made this for my easter brunch with the blue and white tortilla chips as noted by many others. I had to eyeball the mayo and sour cream, and it was a little too much. So I added 1/2 stick of cream cheese and that did the trick no problems. This dip is a definate keeper.

This is one of the best dips, and easy

One of my favorite dips and on turkey burgers! I substitute plain yogurt for the sour cream; it's less dense, so keep your eye on it. For less heat, make sure to remove the chipotle seeds.

Followed the recipe exactly the first time I made this. Thought is was good, but not great. The next time I made it I added black beans, fresh cilantro, shredded Monterey Jack cheese, and substituted lime juice for the lemon. It went from good to fantastic. Served it with lime tortilla chips per another reader recommendation.

I've made this dip twice and both times received great feedback. Even people who claim not to like dip loved it. The best part is that it's incredibly easy to make. Be sure to follow previous recommendations on equal parts mayo and sour cream. I served it with blue corn tortilla chips and pita chips.

I dunno, this just didn't do much for me. I did put in more sour cream than mayo, and strongly recommend that you do it that way, and I love chipotle, but somehow this just didn't seem all that exciting to me. It's ok, just nothing special.

I have made this twice, switching the mayo/sour cream ratio as suggested by others. Every bit disappears! I serve it with regular and blue tortilla chips and it just disappears! I will definitely make again....just as soon as the only store in town that sells the chipotles restocks their shelf!

No big deal. It was ok.

Rating: 3
I've made this twice in the past and it's always a no-fail hit. Some previous cooks suggested using one *can* of chipotle chiles -- not recommended as it will be unbearably hot! Use *canned* chipotle chiles, but only two or three from the can (you will have plenty leftover). By doing this, the recipe should come out fine as it is written without any additions.

I'm not sure what size chipolte in adobos cans were recommended for this recipe, but 2 little cans (smallest in the store) produced probably 1 cup of paste and this recipe calls for 1 1/2 T. I threw in the whole amount of paste (without reading closely) and it was HOT. I cut down the hotness with extra lemon & green onion & also added light whipped cream cheese. I like it a lot, but will definitely adjust the chipoltes for taste when I make it next time. Great dip for a party with beer & alcohol, like a football game. Not a really fancy dip. Seriously, I think you only need 1 small can of these chilis, which I found in the Latin section of a local international grocery store.

I made this dip with the mayo, sour cream adjustments recommended by others. Then stuffed it into roasted baby red potatoes, as described in the Mini Stuffed Potatoes recipe also on this site. Then sprinked with monterey jack and put under the broiler for a few minutes and finally sprinked with chopped cilantro. They were good but a bit rich for my taste, even with low fat mayo and sour cream. However, I took them to a Fall party and they were inhaled. I made a double batch but they were gone within minutes. Several people sought me out at the party to tell me how good they were. They were a real crowd pleaser. Then I used some of the leftover dip to make tuna salad for lunch with cilantro, green peppers and tomatoes. Very yummy.

This was fantastic! To say the least! Finger licking good!! Literally! I used lo-fat mayo & lo-fat sour cream. I think I ended up with a 1/2 & 1/2 mixture. After starting to prepare, I decided to double (good thing!) but I didn't measure. Major keeper!! p.s. Another spelling for the peppers is "chilpotle". I find them in the Mexican section of the grocery store.

I was so excited to try this recipe after reading the reviews. But, I could not find the chipotle chiles anywhere! My friends and I searched 8 different stores. I used jalapeno relish instead. It was good. I really need to try it with the chiles.

This was an incredible hit with my office workers. There wasn't a drop left at the end of the day! I did substitute fat free sour cream and fat free mayonnaise, and it tasted just as good. I flip-flopped the portions of sour cream and mayonnaise as well. I will definitely keep this in my "make often" file!

I reversed the sour cream and mayo, and used lime jucie instead of lemon. The first time I made this I served it with lime Tostidos - YUM!!!! It's also great with vegetables. No one could get enough, and I'm asked for the recipe everytime I serve it to someone new!

SO GOOD! I've served this twice & my guests raved. I used a cup of sour cream and 2 big TBSP mayo. I love chipoltes, so I added 4 and also added cilantro. Garnished w/ avodado & more cilantro and served w/ blue & regular tortilla chips. I also think this might be yummy on a burger...

i agree that the ratio of mayo to sour cream is a little off, i don't know if it's because we are used to sour cream based dips as opposed to mayonnaise...i adjusted and made it with more sour cream. i love chipotle peppers and my guests were commenting on the 'depth' of flavor and the 'smokiness' which is, of course, what the chipotle is all about!

The smoky flavor of the chipoltes gives this dip an unusual and delicious flavor. In my opinion, however, the mayonnaise and sour cream amounts should be reversed - made the way the receipe reads the taste of mayonnaise is too strong.
