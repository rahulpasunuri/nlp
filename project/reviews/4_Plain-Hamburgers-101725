i bought the recommended "lean ground beef with no more than 25 to 30 per cent fat" and changed a long-time habit-- I didn't handle the meat or stir in a lot of stuff-- Just a light touch to form the burgers really did make a difference. Or maybe it was brushing it with butter. Regardless, the burgers turned out juicy. Simply marvelous!

I will never forget the first time I tried this recipe in Vancouver back in 2003. I got hold of some beef cuts from a Black Angus 32 month old heifer (given birth once). In the box I had plenty of minced beef and wanted to see what kind of flavor a hamburger would could give, with a recipe enhancing the quality of the taste instead of hiding it. Ever since I have always made my burgers with the spices and "cosmetics" on the outside. Always follow the advice to treat the patty gently unless you want it dry instead of juicy. Talk to your local butcher about getting minced meat from a mature animal, 30+ months, and it will taste so much better.

This recipe is a welcome reminder that technique can be just as important as ingredients. If I could stack up every over-handled, tough, chewy burger I've had in my life they'd make a pretty sizable tower. Handle the beef less and you may find you need fewer adulterations to the flavour. Genius.

As a professional chef for 20 years and as a cook since the age of 8 I find the GREAT James A. Beard flawless in his approach towards the preparation and the execution of something (that we consider) simple to make. It is VERY easy to forget that making a juicy well cooked burger is more than just the meat, its the method. The master said it best: The less you handle the raw meat, the juicier the cooked hamburger will be, so form the patties gently, with a light touch.

Well, I thought I knew how to make a burger. but I followed the instructions exactly. And my family raved. They were the juiciest burgers ever. My mother swore it was the best burger she ever had. I will always make them this way again.

Wow! Such intense feelings over learning how to cook! Beard IS a master from a previous era. Perhaps the critical would do better to reflect on "their" method vs his and enlighten the rest of us. By the way, a Cuisinart can grind fresh chuck (cleaned and cut) into hamburger quite nicely. This might(?) minimize e.coli fears for the medium rare eater. Is there a food scientist in the room?

High quality beef can make all the difference in flavor but don't be fooled with equating this with using extra lean, the higher fat content is essential for moisture - just call it a bit of decadence once in awhile and enjoy. I like the mere simplicity of this one. The warm toasted buns alongside exchanging the usual mayo, lettuce and tomato instead for the cool wetness of the tangy relish and mustard is a welcome twist on the old staple. A wonderful bit of ingenious fare from 1956! FRIENDLY REMINDER: Modern Food Science dictates that whole cuts of beef, when thoroughly cooked on the exterior, are safe to serve as "rare" as you like. This is because the unsafe bacteria associated with food-borne illness resides on the OUTSIDE of the meat where it has been subject to all stages of handling/processing: from the slaughterhouse to the butcher counter to placement into those neat little packages and everywhere in between too. So, be mindful to well heat/cook all exposed surface areas in order to target likely contamination. This method CANNOT hold true for ground meats of any kind, which by design, incorporate all exterior surfaces into the interior portion of the end product. Hence, meatloaf, hamburgers, Salisbury steak and the like must be properly cooked from the INSIDE OUT! I think it actually remiss of epicurious to let this one get by...

You folks who sullied the great James Beard need to get a life and learn something about this great man!! Suedo gourmets at best. To echo many of the previous comments, the recipe is from 1956, grilling wasn't as popular back then as it is now.

All the snide comments aside, I really didn't know how to make a hamburger. I've made many complex dishes but not a good ol burger and this recipe was very helpful. Thanks!

Sometimes, the simplest recipe produces the best results because the true flavors of the foods are able to shine through: James Beard knew this (and more.) I've been cooking for a long time and I learned a lot by reading and following this recipe closely. The results were perfect, juicy and delicious. I made one change, to compensate for the lower fat of the beef, I stuck about a half a tablespoon of softened butter into each handful of beef before I formed the patties. This produced a burger like the ones I remember and crave of my childhood. Yum! and so satisfying!

I am a daily visitor to this site and use its recipes frequently. I can't remember when any other recipe has garnered so much commentary as this. Here's the real dope: it is a great recipe. Some people, especially James Beard, knew great food even when the Eisenhowers were in the White House. Those of you who denigrated this recipe and its author should read the biography of James Beard. It's a wonderful history of the evolution of food science and cooking in the 20th century.

I like this recipe because it gives tips, such as handling the meat gently, brushing it with butter and searing it...if you do all this, you're guaranteed a great burger!

Sadly, the people who think they're being so clever in ridiculing this recipe are actually showing their ignorance. Some of them clearly didn't read the 1956 date, and clearly don't know who James Beard is. One reviewer referred to him as "James Baird". The more one scoffs at this recipe, the more pedestrian and less food-savvy one appears. A recipe to separate the men from the girls. Quite a hoot!

Although I have already reviewed this recipe, I was unable to express myself fully, given the 250-word maximum. I am therefore going to use this space to provide further insights and background to this seemingly innocuous, yet fiendishly convoluted recipe. The first somewhat obscure point I would like to address is the "four fourks" rating I have assigned to this recipe. It is both critical and dangerous to ignore that cooking is an evolutionary art, and if this recipe is taken as a whole and considered out of its historical context from the prudish and conservative Eisenhower 50's, the "four fourks" rating is rendered both defunct and meaningless. Of equal importance is the general ambivalence or simple hubris of today's culinary prodigies when it comes to paying the obvious homage owed to Mr. Beard. Their general reluctance to accept the deference owed to this recipe speaks volumes of both their inability to properly recognize their predecessors, and a failure to be cognizant of those who came before them.

I'm sure Mr. Beard was a great guy and a culinary genius. I'm sure that there are a lot of people who will benefit from this information on this site. I'm know that I would defend its presence here... but can't we have a little harmless fun too? SHEESH! Sarcasm is not a four letter word (even for the spelling-challenged). :p

AHHHHH!! 1956...the year I was born. Obviously things where a bit differnt in '56 as they are today. I love the 25-30% "lean"...a bit fattier base does allow for extra flavor and juiciness. I flavor my patties several differnt ways. That way guests who always love my burgers never know what flavor they will be having. I use a 3-tier method of seering, cooking and slo-smoking....then to the table. It is a process but the compliments will never stop. One other thing...sssshhhhh....Worcestershire. Don't leave home without it. ;)

I agree--lighten up on Mr. Beard. Also, note what he calls "lean beef"--25-30% fat. That's about as "chuck" as you market will have, but it's an important point. Relatively fatty meat makes goods burgers. If you go below 15%, they will be dry. To avoid the "burger-thick-as-a-ball" problem, take no more than 1/4 pound; place between two sheets of wax paper; flatten to about a 1/2" thick; firm up the edges and FREEZE. Take them from the freezer, sprinkle with at little salt and pepper, and place directly on the grill--do not thaw. This will give you an evenly cooked, "fast food" style burger. Darn tasty. Toast the buns, add mayonaisse and your guest will think you're a genius.

Anyone who makes snide remarks towards advice from JAMES BEARD about anything (in this case, hamburgers)is a suspect gourmet. Learn about the man, consider the context (1956, when a whole lotta people knew nothing about how to grill anything properly), and appreciate the culinary musings of a true lover of food, its preparation, and presentation. See Beard's Theory and Practice and The New James Beard.

Lighten Up, Guys! =o) While some of your comments are meant to be cute, I'm sensing a little sarcasm. I'm a single girl who wanted to make a hamburger on the grill, and although I can cook very well - I wasn't sure how long to cook a hamburger. I didn't want to end up with raw meat!

C'mon folks...the article was penned in 1956! And, for those of us just starting out and just learning to grill...this kind of information is key. I much prefer a moist (medium rare --bring it on) hamburger to those crusty, dried out wafers I typically get at a barbeque. At one time you, too, probably didn't know the more you handled the meat the tougher the burger... . Good info...great burgers....
