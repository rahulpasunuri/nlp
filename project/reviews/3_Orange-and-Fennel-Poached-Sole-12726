I chose this recipe for it's minimalism in ingredients, ease of preparation and the fact that I'm am looking for new ways to prepare fish. Being a smoker I was concerned about the delicacy of the seasonings, I used an italian garlic flavored white wine vinegar and added 1/2 tsp of black peppercorns and a pinch of dried thyme to the poaching sauce and substituted finely chopped red onion for the shallots. The result was excellent I will definitely make this over and over again.

I found this dish to be extremely disappointing. The flavors were subtle to the point of bein absent. The recipe had no character and was more than unremarkable even tho I added chopped cilantro at the end....

Only two forks but I would make it again. Why? I think the fennel in the sauce needs to be fresh instead of seeds (or crush the seeds). It came across as so subtle that the sweetness of the orang juice and rinds were overpowering. That said I could taste the potential so I'm not giving up just yet. Might be interesting with Halibut as well.

I too found it just OK. The sauce had a delicate flavor but was not great. I might make it again if I happen to have all the ingredients on hand.

It was OK, but I didn't find it fantastic. Sauce was too sweet, perhaps because of the reduction- it tasted like I had added lots of sugar.

Quick, yummy way to serve orange roughy, and we always have the ingredients on hand. I reduced the sauce until it was quite thick. It was so good we wished we had more, so next time I'll double the sauce ingredients. I'll also add more strips of zest -- my husband gobbled them up.

I used tilapia instead of sole and the results were wonderful. A real light, fresh flavor and so fast and easy to make.

Great quick-fix dinner. Had to substitute a few things like red wine for white and then I had to pilfer orange peel from my marmalade. Added some mushrooms (shitake would be good) and served with rice (long grain would be better than jasmine) and had asparagas on the side. Orange roughy was the fish I chose. I'd easily make it again.

I follwed this recipe exactly but I was not pleased by the results. The sauce was too lightly flavored, it didn't add much to the fish. I wouldn't make it again.

I just made this and it was really tasty!! We will definitely have this again. We used orange roughy and fresh fennel bulb slices instead of the seeds. It almost tasted like a coconut milk curry sauce. We're going out on a limb next time and try to make this with tofu for our vegetarian friends. Haven't figured out what to marinate the tofu in yet. Maybe something lemony or gingery.

My partner and I loved this recipe. I made a few little substitutes like leaving out the fennel seeds (partner is not a big fan of fennel) and the white wine vinegar (didn't have any in the cupboard) and substituting some other fresh herbs and spices and it turned out fine. The orange and white wine added a lot of flavor. Will definitely make it again.

Lovely flavour, very subtle. I couldn't get fennel seeds so I used an Italian mixture of ground herbs and spices (fennel, dill, basil). Must be used on a very delicately flavoured fish. You could use the sauce on vegetables as well.

This was SO good! I can hardly wait to try it with the right ingredients! Had to use orange marmalade, anise seed & champagne vinegar with garlic. Fast food worshiping son said it was awesome! I also served reduced sauce over the orange roughy without putting it through a sieve. Nummy! And easy!!

Mmmm! Very yummy. I left out the butter (to cut fat), but because I soaked the fish in milk for a bit before cooking (to minimize fishy aroma), the sauce was still pretty substantial and I didn't miss the butter. Very good, quick dish. The fennel adds a subtle flavor, and not too licorice-y.

This was so easy and really delicious. I served with corn-on-the-cob drizzling the sauce over the corn. My husband liked it a lot.

Great on tuna, snapper, pretty much anything fish-like. Will try again and again!
