I agree with the other reviewers...this is the best cranberry sauce I've ever tasted. There were no kumquats available in my local market, so I had to substitute mandarins. It worked out well.

I made this at Thanksgiving -- I love cranberry sauce, but the rest of my family ususally only takes a small spoonful to appease me. This sauce was devoured -- they've requested it again at Christmas!
