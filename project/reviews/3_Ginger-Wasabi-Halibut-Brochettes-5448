My family thought this recipe lacked flavor and character.

Love this dish! I received the recipe from a friend a few years ago and it quickly became a family favorite. I marinade the fish for about 1 hour and the flavor comes out great!

I thought that this was a bit too strong for the flavor of the halibut. I wasn't sure of the recipe, but it got pretty good reviews. I prefer the olive lemon recipe.

Excellent. I always let things marinate much longer than recipes call for. I let this marinate in the refrigerator for at least a couple hours and then brought out to take off chill. Served with fried rice and sweet and sour cucumber salad (rice vinegar is great for this.)

I made this for a hungry bunch of guys at the beach and it was universally loved. Prepare the sesame noodle recipe and cucumbers in rice wine for the full effect. This is perfect for beach house Fridays when people arrive late after work--fast and good.

This marinade also works well for other types of fish, like swordfish. Great in a pinch, but be sure to use extra wasabi to get a kick. Also, serve with wasabi on the side...

The marinade seemed a bit odd, but I made it exactly as written and was quite pleased. A big hit with all.

Very good. The marinade renders the fish very tender and flavorful. I broiled the fish instead of grilling it, and it was excellent.

I have made this recipe several times and think it is one of the best recipes for halibut--quick, easy and very tasty. Great with an Asian noodle salad and a cool cucumber salad. For more wasabi zing, add more.

I was expecting it to have a bit of a zing with the wasabi butit was fairly bland.

The sweetness of the red peppers next to the spicy, savory halibut is very nice. Instead of grilling the brochettes, I broiled them. This is very easy to make and I only dirtied two dishes!
