This is a great wholesome soup and is very popular during Ramadan. You can use lamb instead of chicken. I use lamb mincemeat as it cooks quicker. I also add some barley to make it thicker. Yummy!

I liked it, but with a few additions. I added twice the cumin and added coriander, also increased the cilantro and parsley. I am on a low-sodium diet, so didn't add salt. Definitely tastes better after a couple of days.

I didn't actually rate this recipe, because I simplified it significantly-- but even still, it turned out to be delicious (and easy AND healthy!). I sauteed the onions, along with some celery, carrots & garlic, then added chicken broth, canned tomato & rice and let it simmer for about 15 min. Then, I threw in steamed lentils (from Trader Joe's), canned chick peas, and let it continue simmering for about another 15. Finally, added the parsley & cilantro, along with cumin, paprika & salt (maybe another 15 min to simmer?). I blended about 1/2 of it to give it more of that harira consistency. It turned out really delicious-- if not 100% authentic (my hubby lived in Morocco for 2 years, and said "It's CLOSE". He did love it, though!). I'm sure the original recipe would be better, but this was a nice week-night version. One change I would make is using about 1/2 as much rice, and more lentils. Otherwise, it was great (and made a TON!).

I think this could be spiced up and be much tastier. I think this recipe could benefit from sauteing the onions with ground cumin before adding the tomatoes and the remaining ingredients. Maybe try adding minced serrano chili.

Great recipe. Most recipes I've tasted in Morocco include chicken liver and neck for flavor. Celery (a very skinny variety they have here) is also key in the local version...

What's not to like? This is a great recipe! I made it all veggie, left out the chicken and used vegetable broth, and put in some carrots. Totally wholesome, didn't miss the meat.

Thanks for everyone's input! We used some and made some more of our own: we poached boneless skinless chicken breasts (3 halves) in 2 cans chicken broth in the microwave 15 minutes. We added 1tsp each of tumeric, ground coriander and biber (Turkish pepper flakes), 2tsp ground ginger (no fresh in the house - we'll do that grated next time) plus 1T of cumin and sea salt to taste. Then ran the immersion blender before putting the shredded chicken back into the soup. Can't wait to try it the 2d day! Will do again with more research on 'something missing' from our recollection of this dish at Restaurant Mamounia in San Francisco.

I have made this several times with many different revisions, some as outlined in other comments. My only standard deviation from the recipe is that I tend to use and immersion blender to give the soup a more consistent texture, which was my experience of Harira in the three times I lived in Morocco. One of the best things about Harira is how much it varies -- sort of like "vegetable" or "chicken" soup in the US/UK. In my book, fresh cilantro and parsley are hugely key to getting the taste right. I also think that using lamb stock (HAS ANYONE FOUND A SOURCE FOR LAMB BULLION IN THE US???) during Ramadan, in particular, makes it taste more authentic to me. As with most things, simple is best -- and this is a simple yet terrific recipe that can (and should!) be modified by each family into a treasured, individual soup.

Very flavorful and filling. I used red lentils instead of brown lentils and added spices as recommended by previous cooks. It was also easy to prepare, which is good after a long day at work during the winter.

Delicious, hearty soup that I will gladly make again! At high altitude, things cook a little differently, so next time I'll add the lentils and chick peas first, then later the rice. Note to my neighbor in Pavillion: You can find saffron threads in the local grocery stores, don't buy the powdered. Try Mr D's here. Another name for coriander is cilantro, which is usually always available locally thanks to our asian/hispanic neighbors. Look next to the fresh parsley; it has larger, flat leaves and lovely scent. Ask the produce guy if you can't find it.

Whether you make this with the chicken or without, it is a wonderful, hearty, unique soup.

Excellent soup, but only with the addition of some spices. I added 1 tsp. each of turmeric, cinnamon and coriander, and 2 tsp. ginger. Makes a wonderful winter meal.

Was glad to see the hint from my neighbor in Lander, WY (45 miles) as I can never get dried beans to soften at altitude. As it's Thanks-giving, I used my Turkey stock (with added chicken bouillon) and leftover Turkey. Also could not find fresh coriander nor saffron threads (in Wyoming? You've got to be kidding!) Otherwise, I'm sure it would have gotten 4 forks. Loved it anyway!

This is a delicious, simple and quick recipe. I did a few things differently. I browned my chicken in the stockpot first with onions and garlic. I used stewed canned tomatoes. I did not drain or puree. I thought it was wasteful to drain off that delicious juice and figured it would only enhance the flavour of the soup - which it did. Finally, I added a little hot sauce to give it a kick. This really is a great recipe - even though I altered it slightly. I really think the fresh cilantro and parsley sets this apart from similar soup recipes.

To the cook from Vancouver: The recipe states that a vegetarian version of the dish was the INSPIRATION for the current one. It does not suggest that this recipe is vegetarian. Vancouver, please get clear on YOUR terminology...

Chicken is not vegetarian. Editors, please get clear on your terminology.

When I was in Morocco, I don't think the Harira (available everywhere) used any meat.

This is a really wonderful and easy-to-prepare soup. I tried it with lamb as well and was also pleased.

A good, hearty soup which does not require much prep-work.
