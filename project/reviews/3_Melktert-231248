If you don't use castor sugar, use at least 1/2 cup or it's not sweet enough

Pretty tasty, definately better warm. Found the puff pastry too tough for this, will try it again with flaky pastry, think it will pair better.

This recipe was great - not quite like Ouma used to make, but then it never is! We prefer a richer custard so added an extra egg, and heated butter, cinnamon stick and vanilla pod with first milk infusion. Would definitely try it again when we have a braai. LEKKER
