I made quite a few changes to this recipe, but it came out very well. Didn't salt the eggplant, it's not necessary with baby eggplant right from the garden. Used four small japanese eggplant. Used basil pecan pesto recipe from this site. Used asiago and jalapeno jack. Thought the cheeses went very nicely with the dish. Added in chopped fresh banana peppers (also from garden) and a few cloves of chopped garlic. Baked for 10 minutes longer than called for since I tested the eggplant at 25 minutes and it wasn't yet ready. This came out quite delicious. Made enough for a small dinner for my husband and me.

This is a great recipe and we took the tip from the "expat" in the Netherlands on making our own pesto. We just used a half of a small can of tomato paste, one cup of fresh basil leaves, 1/3 cup of pine nuts toasted to a golden brown and cooled along with a 1/4 cup of grated parmesan cheese. This was all combined in a blender with about 1/2 cup of virgin olive oil. We also used grated mozzerella cheese for the jack cheese as that was all we had in the house. The results were delicious and will be made again.

I thought this recipe was nice. I did make some changes however. First I skipped the whole salting process. I have found it is just fine without this step. Secondly, I used mixture of tomato paste, garlic and basil instead of the pesto. (The pesto was not available here in Holland) And I substituted mozzerella cheese for the Jack cheese. My husband thought it was great and I, the eggplant lover, thought it was tasty too. My dutch hubby has requested it several times now.

I made this as a first course for a dinner party and it was a hit BUT I used mozzarella cheese. I can't imagine using any other type of cheese with eggplant, pesto and parmesan...

I haven't tried this recipe, but I have made something like it. I suggest wiping with a wet cloth or washing the salt off the eggplant before using it. Also, I use healthy dabs of chevre (goat cheese) instead of monterey jack.

This was awful. It was way too salty and greasy. It wasn't even nice to look at. My husband and I took one bite and threw the whole dish out. What a waste of perfectly good eggplant!

I made this with basil pesto and monterey and cheddar cheese. I found this to be very salty tasting. My husband thought it was good though, but then again he eats anything.

I did a single layer of eggplant and used Gourmet's recipe for "Basil Pecan Pesto". Totally scrumptious. Let them rest for a couple of minutes before you enjoy. I will try them as an appetizer next time and cut them with a pizza cutter into wedges.

Very good. May try a stronger cheese next time.

Quick and easy. I have made this dish twice, once with basil pesto and once with the sundried tomato pesto. May try using a different cheese next time.

This is a great, fast recipe and perfect for vegetarians. I substituted the Jack cheese for Mozzarella, as Jack can be a bit greasy for my taste. It was tender and juicy, and the Parmesan added an almost crunchy taste. We loved it!
