I decided to try this unusual sounding recipe with my bumper crop of eggplants this year. It's a nice change from the typical tomato and cheese you find in other eggplant dishes. I would try it again, even though it gets cold rather quickly and I'm not a fan of cold fried foods.

Every time I make this dish for a party, there's no leftovers. I still haven't mastered frying eggplant, though, and it seems like my first batches turn out burned or soggy. I don't think it's the recipe -- likely user error.

I used to make this dish all the time for my husband and for some reason have not made it in a while. Last night I came across some gorgeous mint that I didn't realize was growing in my garden and remembered this recipe. So did my husband who asked me to make it for him today. We LOVE this dish

We did half and half canola/olive oil and these were fantastic. I don't usually deep fry things but this was worth it. It's a really interesting combination of flavors.

This is wonderful, especially in the summer when fresh mint is in abundance. I usually make ahead, so it is usually room temp rather than hot. Still delish!

I took this to a wine party and it got wonderful reviews. It was just as good room temperature as it was warm, and I've had to pass along the recipe to friends already. I did use half canola oil and half olive oil and that seemed to work fine.

This was very good. The combination of ingredients worked quite well together. Recieved rave reviews and actually one of the guest reguested I make it for one of her get togethers. Now that's a satisfied customer!!!

Served with turkey. Everyone loved it and we didn't even have mint. Kept warm in the oven for almost an hour and it didn't get soggy. Espically good for those that think they don't like eggplant!

This recipe was one of the worst I've come across. I love eggplant, and this tasted nothing like eggplant. I thought the honey, sesame, mint combination would be really good, but it was very weird. It just didn't go with the eggplant. My husband who loves fried eggplant didn't like it either. It would be better fried in Veg. oil, not olive oil since it is basically a tempura batter, and I guarantee no Japanese person is frying tempura in olive oil.

This recipe was a huge success at a dinner nite that I attended. Everyone wanted the recipe and could not believe how simple the breading was and is! It was a hard dish to prepare for at someone-else's home though, i.e. keeping it warm without losing the cripiness of the fried zucchini was a challenge. So please make it for your guests right of the stove! Enjoy, cuz we sure did!

Absolutely delicious!! The only drawback is how unhealthy it is with the frying. A tasty indulgence for a treat once in a while.

The taste was excellent, but the batter was not as crisp as I would have liked...?...I tried these two ways (after reading a post below, I tried baking some of them...BIG mistake...too much moisture in the eggplant makes them soggy and stick to the baking sheet)...and even frying them they were a nice color/presentation, but a bit soft.

I have made the eggplant recipe two times in the past week. It's the greatest. I am just waiting for company to come again so I can share it with more friends. Any thing eggplant I really enjoy.

I made this for my vegetarian teenagers and they loved it.

I have to agree with the others, this is excellent!! The BIG change that I did was I did not fry them, instead I used the spray Olive Oil and covered the bottom of a baking sheet and baked them at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes. They came out golden brown and crispy. Just incredible. I will DEFINETLY make this one again.

Excellent--everyone loved it, and I've already made it again. Trying adding some yogurt to the topping as well.

I particpate in a volunteer group that provides meals for actors and staff at a professional theater. I made this dish using about 4 dozen slices of eggplant. It was eaten very quickly and was very popular. Personally, I am an eggplant lover and this is now my favorite recipe with eggplant!

This was an interesting dish. It went over well at a recent tapas party. I'll make it again, but I'll fry the eggplant in less olive oil.

My husband & I both enjoyed this. I mixed veggie oil with the olive oil to keep cost down & so I could fry at a higher temperature. A good side dish for grilled steak. We will make it again this summer with fresh zuchinni & mint from our garden.

As written a very simple and pleasant dish, nothing fancy - I paired with green beans with garlic and lemon zest and brown rice. Easy to make, though I think the soaking of the eggplant in salt water before frying was unnecessary. Next time I'll just salt and allow it to drain. I'll also add some spiciness to the honey, and maybe a little veggie stock for more pizzaz. Green onions would also be a good addition.
