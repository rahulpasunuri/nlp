This was delicious. I used pizza dough that I already had in the house. The toppings were delightful!

I thought this recipe was absolutely amazing. Didn't use the recipe for the dough and just bought a frozen pizza dough from the store...it still came out great. Used a little more rosemary and had a Swiss fontina instead of Italian, but it was still delicious. Definitely would make again!

This was my first time making my own pizza dough rather than buying it pre- made. While it was time-consuming (especially since I made 2 pizzas to feed 9 people), everyone thought the dough was delicious. This was a fun dish to make to celebrate Bastille Day!

I don't know about the toppings, but this pizza dough recipe is great - easy to churn out in the afternoon and it rolls out nice and thin. I use this dough for all my pizzas - especially on the grill.

This was a complete Trader Joe's dinner - every ingredient. I used TJ pizza dough and roasted piquillo peppers (sweeter and more complex flavor). I agree with the Cook from Pendleton that it was a little bland (TJ had only domestic fontina and I forgot the red pepper flakes). My potatoes didn't get crispy and brown like the photo. But otherwise it's delicious.

I substituted 1/2 cup of white whole wheat flour in the dough and made a bit more of the garlic olive oil. Instead of using a peel, I just dusted a sheet of parchment paper and slid the paper directly onto the stone. I would probably use less tapenade and more red pepper, but my husband though it was just right. Really good Italian Fontina is well worth it for this pizza.

I loved this easy and unusual combination. I have made it as written several times to rave reviews. I've also replaced the fontina with gouda and I think I like that combo even better. Try this one, you'll like it!

Loved the pizza recipe. It was a great blend of flavors and made the pizza a little different. I also concur with a cook from Pendleton OR would also double the toppings.

I made this pizza last night exactly as given, although I used my own pizza crust recipe. While it was good, it was a bit bland. Next time I'll double the garlic, rosemary and tapenade.
