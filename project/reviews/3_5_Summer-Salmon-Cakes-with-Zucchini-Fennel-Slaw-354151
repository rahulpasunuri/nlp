This was pretty yummy but note it is 1 serving. I would make it again but I'd drop the mayo from the slaw. A vinaigrette would be lighter tasting. Also, I would consider using panko on the cakes. Liked that it was quick to make and had a lot of flavor.

This is one of my favorite week night dishes. I use a few more chives (I just like chives). Be sure to really press liquid out of zuchinni or the cake will be to wet and fall apart when you flip. I also chop up prosciutto and fry it in a little olive oil till crispy then use the same pan to fry cakes. I top the cake with the crispy prosciutto. Yummy!

I made this for Father's Day dinner. Instead of salmon cakes, I just baked some salmon. My husband *loved* the slaw. I replaced the mayonnaise with Greek yogurt since he does not like mayo much. I gave the dish extra extra chives, cayenne, and lemon juice. The resulting slaw was superb! We love this dish!

I've made these salmon cakes several times. They are delish. This last time I used curry instead of cayenne/mustard for a little variety. But both this time and the last time I had trouble keeping the cakes together. What am I doing wrong or not doing? Please advise!

Very easy and fast. The non stick pan is a must. They stayed warm in a low oven, so a nice meal to make just before your guest arrive and you don't have to be running around the kitchen.

This was a great salmon cake recipe- the zucchini contributes a lot to the moistness of the salmon cakes. However, when preparing these, I grated the zucchini ahead of time, and salted it,then pressed it to make sure I got out as much excess liquid as possible. Without doing this, I think they would have been mushy. I substituted the mayo and lemon juice for non-fat plain yogurt with a little bit of sugar, and used bread crumbs instead of crackers. Excellent, don't skimp on the oil when sauteing, they will stick!

I thought this was terrific as did my husband. I'm not sure why others thought there was too much zucchini in it. Worked fine for me. I didn't have lemons ( a first!) but used lime juice instead. It was fine. I also toasted about 2 t of caraway seeds and added that to the slaw. Much better! Maybe if you tried squeezing the water out of the zucc., that would help but anyway, I will definitely make again. Oh! I also made fried salmon skins with the leftover skin. Cut into 4"X1/2" rectangles, coat w/a dusting of salt and sugar. Then coat w/flavored flour ( I used old bay and cayenne) and fry at 350 degrees till crisp and brown. Then i put them over the cakes. Nice presentation.

I was a little hesitant to use a good piece of wild-caught salmon in a salmon cake recipe, but the fact that it took just 1/4 pound per person weighed the scales on the side of trying it. I am glad I did. This was actually a super good use of salmon: the zucchini in the cakes made them moist, and I am always happy to add a little more vegetable to my meat. The salmon cakes were very tasty-- mustard and lemon added tang without announcing themselves. (I left out cayenne and chives because I didn't have them). My husband and I also liked the slaw very much. It was a great match for the salmon. The whole meal took only the 25 minutes to prepare that they claim. A keeper.

to clarify my previous review, I meant to say too much zucchini in the salmon cakes not slaw. i didn't add in the slaw mixture just the zuchini and there was waaaaay too much of it with only half of what the recipe calls for being used

After making this I agree with some of the other posters that there is something wrong with the recipe here. Before making this I noticed others mentioned that there was too much Slaw in the salmon cakes so I reduced mine by half. Even after that there was way too much slaw, compared to the pictures my cakes where mostly all green (there does not appear to be any slaw present in the pictures of the salmon cakes here) Also they don't stick together at all, you kind of have to scoop them out of the pan when they are done. I think maybe making this recipe with only adding in the mayo mix into the salmon is what they meant? I would try that next time. As for the Slaw mix itself, it was ok. I think it is missing something, maybe some dill would be good.

The salmon burgers were delicious. I beefed up the slaw recipe with half a chopped apple and some slivered almonds for crunch. Very good.

The addition of fresh dill to the mixture added a significant and delightful experience to the salmon. Without it the mustard and lemon steal the show.

Ooooops, my bad! I didn't clearly read/understand the recipe. Some of the zuccine IS supposed to go into the salmon mixture. I can surely see why some said it made the mix too soft, bland, etc.

There seems to be some confusion...the Zuccini/Fennel slaw is meant to be a side dish, not added to the salmon patty ingredients. The recipe instructions could have been written a bit more clearly!

I have made this three times. It is a great summer dish. The key to this recipe is to slice the fennel as thin as you can!

This was a wonderful recipe. I wouldn't change a single thing, the salmon cakes were super easy to cook and delicious!

After reading reviews, I use twice as much salmon as called for and spiced up the mayo dressing. Turned out wonderful. The cakes were great contrasted against the crispy light slaw. Big hit!

We made the salmon cakes tonight. We didn't have zucchini so we skipped the slaw and made the salmon cakes according to the recipe just without any zucchini and they were delicious! The outside was perfectly crisp and brown and the inside was salmony perfection.

The salmon cakes were nice but not great. The mayonnaise dressing was good but somehow the flavour didn't come through with the slaw. I drained the grated zucchini on paper towels for 5 minutes before adding it to the salmon and that seemed to get rid of sufficient moisture.

I did not like these and wouldn't make it again. Not enough taste, and did were not firm.

We made these cakes last night for a Summer Fest -- served with classic gazpacho and grilled asparagus. We did use a bit more salmon than the recipe called for (started with 16 oz for three large cakes but after removing the skin the weight was somewhat less), but otherwise everything turned out great.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. Made a few modifications. After reading other reviews, I used half the mayo, used green onions instead of chives, and added an egg white to the salmon pattie mixture. They turne out great. Also, we like a little spice, so we made a sauce for the patties- some mayo, lemon juice, cayenne, salt, and pepper. Yummy!

I agree totally with cook from New York. The zucchini was too much for the amount of salmon.The taste was okay, but the cakes were very watery and didn't look anything like the picture. I love salmon, but was very disappointed with this recipe.

Rating: 2
We didn't have much luck with this recipe. The cakes didn't look like those pictured with the recipe, instead there was a much higher ratio of zucchini/breadcrumbs to salmon. More like zucchini pancakes with salmon than salmon cakes. The salmon also cooked much more quickly than the inside of the cake, so getting the cakes done required slightly overcooking the salmon. Also, the cayenne really overpowered the flavors of fennel, zucchini and chives in the slaw. The whole plate was overly rich for such healthy main ingredients (so much mayo!!)

...To follow up my previous review, I meant that I would use LESS mayo next time in the slaw.

The Salmon cakes were delicious! Quick fix. Slaw couldn't have gone with less mayo.

This recipe is a simple quick dish that tastes well beyond the time it took to make it. I made this dish accompanied by a light pasta and it hit the spot! I will definitely make this again on a warm summery evening.

this was a fun, strong 3 forks! i did make a couple changes tho... i didnt read the part about 1 serving, so i had to use another 1/4 lb of salmon that was already cooked (leftover) and doubled the recipe. also, i didnt use the fennel - 2 reasons: 1- they didnt have it at the store, 2 - my dinner partner doesnt care for it. so i used a half bag of brocoli slaw along with the shredded zucchini... and it was GREAT! ENJOY!
