This is almost certainly the recipe I have been looking for! As a little girl, I used to go to Carl's Bakery in Santa Monica, Ca. It was heaven, full of sweet aromas from the best cookies, doughnuts, cakes and pastries I've ever had. Unfortunately, when Carl retired, there was no one to take over. It is a shame, because the bakery was a fixture in SM, remembered fondly by generations. If you are looking for a coffee cake that is more like a cake than bread, this is not the recipe for you. This one is very lightly sweet, and has a lovely, crunchy, not-too-sweet topping (depending upon how much powdered sugar you use). One thing I remember from Carl's crumb cakes is the topping consisted of little balls of varying size. I'm sure there's a technique. If anyone knows it, please let me know?

I was not impressed with this recipe. The cake was dry and not sweet enough. I used an oven thermometer and only baked it for 45 min. instead of 55 to 60 min. The crumb topping was good.

Update to my previous review. THIS IS A GREAT Crumb cake recipe. My kids and friends go nuts over it. I'm still working on adjusting it. The full cake recipe is a little to cakie but half wasn't quite enough I made 1/2 and put it in a smaller baking dish that was about 3/4 the area with 1 1/2 of the topping and it seemed to get me where I wanted. OH IMPORTANT I added a shot of Nutmeg to the cake... very good addition

fluffy delicious cake! would double the topping next time. i also had to put tinfoil over the top halfway through the cooking time because it was getting too brown on the outside.

OK trust me on this... halve the cake recipe and double the crumb topping dust with confectioners sugar. That is just the way I use to get them at the German Bakery in Queens N.Y. 35 years ago...yummmmmm

I have not made this recipie, but my Oma used to when we were growing up. I am going to try this though. The name of this cake in German is Streusse Kuchen.

I love this crumb cake recipe. It is a keeper recipe. I made the cake for a party. I went home and baked another cake for home. A Cuisinart is also needed in addition to the Kitchenaid mixer

Exactly what I wanted it to be. To save time, do the first rise, spread in pan, crumb, and then do the second rise in the fridge overnight, that way you can just wake and bake.

I too was born in NYC - actually queens. the german bakeries had crumb cakes which I loved. I made this cake - but spread the batter in two 13x9 inch pans. This made a very shallow layer of cake. Then I doubled the crumb mixture and topped both cakes. Baked them. This is more like it. Love this cake.

This was not what I expected. It was more like bread with crumbs than crumb cake. The topping was really good I added half brown sugar like the other reader. My hunt will continue for the perfect german crumb cake.

I am always on a crumb cake quest for the best recipe. I still think my NY crumbcake recipe is the best. Yes, this recipe takes a bit of time but it is worth the effort. I can compare this cake to a buttery babka with crumbs on top. I did enhance the flavoring with more vanilla in the dough. I also sub'd 1/2 light brown and 1/2 granulated sugar and added 1/4 teaspoon of allspice for the topping; this did wonders for the recipe. Also a sprinkle of confectioner's sugar is perfect when serving. The only problem I had was...when cooling, the middle of the cake sunk. I used King Arthur AP flour. Any ideas why I had this problem?

Insane! This is my dream crumb cake. Be prepared; it is very time intensive but well worth the effort. It is still warm as I write this (I may finish it before it even cools)!
