This was good, but probably would be excellent as a base for other things if you're interested in being a bit more creative. I used half water and half vegetable broth to enhance the flavor. Chipotle might be a nice complement to this. Anyway, this is a good recipe to have in your repertoire if you're interested in experimenting.

Excellent with the following changes: I made it with frozen corn(no boiling of cobs) and used chicken stock instead of water.

I love corn but this "soup" resembled creamed corn, and was very bland. Too much effort for too little flavor.

I've made this soup twice. The cooking of the cobs makes it seem too time-consuming, but the flavor and consistency are worth it. Didn't care for the blenderized bits of corn in the soup; I thought it detracted from the intense corn flavor. So, after the blender step, I put this through a sieve. The result: a velvety smooth soup with an intense corn flavor. Save this recipe for when the sweetest of sweet summer corn is available.

First thing I discovered: You need really good corn to make this work. I think this was a bland soup for the time and effort put into it.
