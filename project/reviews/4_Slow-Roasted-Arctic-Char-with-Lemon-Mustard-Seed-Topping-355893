An easy, flavorful, healthy weeknight meal. Tiny changes to recipe: used panko instead of multigrain bread crumbs and fresh tarragon, just because the store (which had the arctic char on sale) happened to have it. Will make many times in the future. Served with sauteed snow peas and mushrooms.

I never, ever, ever use fake or substitute anything in my cooking. If you're like me, then just add a dash of real sugar to the recipe it'll be delicious, and the world won't come to an end. Excellent dish!

Simple but flavorful. I tend to cook everything at very high heat, so sometimes forget that "slow and low" can yield a moist and flavorful result. The char was cooked perfectly (35 minutes at exactly 250) and the coating/sauce was tasty -- lemony but not overpowering (I skipped the mustard seeds and forgot the tarragon...)

A very easy way to cook fish. Definitely put the parchment paper on the pan as it makes removing the fish a cinch. I was surprised by the amount of lemon flavor in the dish - but very good.

This recipe is extra excellent with the addition of orange zest and juice. Also, I never have mustard seeds on hand, and the fish seems to taste just fine without that added ingredient.

Easy + tasty = excellent recipe. Skipped the parsley because I was out. Otherwise, followed the recipe. Nice flavor with a bit of a kick. Served with brown rice and eggplant for a fast, healthy and good mid-week meal.
