This recipie was very good. It had many good subtle qualities that replaced the typical spice-e-ness of other food. We served it over simple white rice and I felt it completed the meal nicely. We went with a boneless chicken and decided that it didn't make much of a diffrence. For a thicker breast I would suggest cooking for 5 minutes longer then the suggested time. Do make sure the breasts have skin as this creates the best flavor. Overall a very good and filling recipe!

A simple chicken stew but not any unique flavouring.

Very good for a weeknight dinner. chicken was tender and juicy. We're on a low sodium diet, so this was a fantastic addition to our recipe list.

THIS RECIPE TURNED OUT VERY TASTY WITH A FEW CHANGES I MADE AFTER READING OTHER REVIEWS. I ADDED A GOOD HANDFULL OF KALAMATA OLIVES AND ANOTHER OF GRAPE TOMATOES TO ADD ZIP, COLOR AND FLAVOR. I SUBSTITUTED SOME CHICKEN BROTH FOR ABOUT HALF THE WINE.I GARNISHED WITH MINCED PARSLEY FOR COLOR. BEAUTIFUL AND DELISH!

this is very easy and delicious. Most importantly, the breasts are very juicy and the sauce is good. I served with egg noodles and broccoli. Even my hubby liked it, and he does not usually like breasts (chicken breasts, that is).

I've made this several times. My husband enjoys it very much. This dish makes a nice impression, but is easy enough to make on a regular weeknight after work.

Wonderful !!! We absolutely loved it. I did tweak it a bit as some suggested, adding basil, oregano, tarragon, extra garlic and a bit of chicken broth. Great over basmati rice. We will definitely make this again!

Nope. This recipe looked like it would be tasty, but it was very bland. I agree with Santa Monica that it was lacking on flavor, and also agree with Seattle that it could benefit from herbs. As it was cooking I added some fresh rosemary after tasting it, but that didn't help. Additional seasoning with salt and pepper didn't help. Maybe some broth would have...I don't know, it's not worth trying to figure it out. The flavors never developed and it was simply tasteless, although textural. I definitely wouldn't make it again, there are better recipes out there.

Excellent. Definitely use chicken with skin and bone ... it adds to the flavor. I used a can of diced tomatoes with jalepeno peppers to give a little bit of heat. Also, I used half sliced white mushrooms and half sliced gourment blend (oyster, shiitake, lobster) mushrooms to give a nice blend of mushroom flavor. Overall, this is an excellent blend of tastes and textures for only an hour of prep and cook time. I served with brown rice and it was excellent.

This dish reminded me of my mother's chicken cacciatore, therefore, I loved it. My husband and kids liked it as well, which was amazing since the kids do not do mushrooms! I served this with some sauted swiss chard and tomatoes and it made a delicious meal!

Good and easy to make but lacking on flavor.

This was very good. There's lots of veggies in the dish, so I didn't even have to serve a side veggie. I served it with brown and wild rice. It worked fine with boneless skinless chicken breasts. It could benefit from the addition of herbs, though.

I also increased the garlic and used about 1 cup of onion. Even the kids liked it (after removing the "poisonous parts," of course.

great and easy to cook. throw everything in the cuisinart and go. i added more wine, more garlic, crushed black pepper and tabasco plus bayleaves. heart smart, use skinless beast, otherwise use thighs. served with fresh baby potatoes and sesame spinich. this is classic comfort food. my guests thought it was wonderful.

Instructions work well as written. Chicken was tender. However, overall flavor of dish reminded us of airline food. For that reason, I won't make it again.

How about more ratings choices? Ideally I'd give this a 2-1/2. Nice weeknight meal, and leftovers were good the next day. I agree with the IL cook who said the cooking time was just right for boneless, skinless chicken breasts.

I loved this! My family thought the wine flavor was too strong. I did cook it for a whole lot longer, this seemed like a chicken-version of osso bucco. Added the parsely and sauteed mushrooms too at the very end, and it was great! Will reduce wine, add broth next time. Late night guest consumed all leftovers and says thank you Epicurious!

We tried this meal last week and really liked it. I liked it so much, that I'm going to make it again on Thursday, this week. The only thing I did different was using boneless, skinless chicken breasts. The cooking time was just right for these.

I agree that this dish lacked some flavor, so I added more salt and garlic with the addition of oregano, along with some sugar to taste to sweeten the sauce up a bit. I cut back on the olive oil to reduce the fat content. If I would have thought about it, I would have served this dish with a bed of rice or pasta. Also, toasted french bread can be served with this dish too.

Thought it was quite good. I used dark meat instead and omitted the celery. Easy to reheat and appealed to all the picky eaters at my house. If you like this, you'll love Chicken with tomatoes and white beans.

This was very good. I simmered the chicken for quite a bit longer than the recipe said. Yum Yum

Quick & easy but a little boring. I added extra salt, freshly-ground pepper, a teaspoon of tomato paste and fresh basil to spice it up. Used dark meat of chicken, removed from bone and cut into bite-sized pieces before adding to sauce. Served over mushroom-filled ravioli.

I needed to add more seasonings to give it extra flavor, other then that, I loved it!

This was very good. I used boneless chicken breast. Crushed tomatoes where used in place of the diced tomatoes in juice. I think next time I would use can carrots so it doesn't take so long for the carrots to cook.My husband just loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
