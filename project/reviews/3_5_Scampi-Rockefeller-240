This is amazing! I always double the recipe, but I only use 4.5 tb. of the anise liquor. It probably doesn't need it, but I put parm cheese on the top, too.

I always double this recipe. There are usually a few leftovers, but 1/2 lb. of shrimp just isn't enough for the two of us. I like garlic also but only use 9 cloves instead of doubling it. I find the anise flavor can easily overwhelm the dish, so when doubling the recipe I use 4-5 tb. Lastly, I pour the spinach mixture into a bowl before I add the cheese. Otherwise it melts onto the saute pan.

Simply excellent. I made a few minor changes which I'd repeat again: instead of Tabasco, I added some red hot pepper flakes to oil with the garlic. I quadrupled the recipe for a crowd by doing everything except baking. Put prepared cassarole in fridge until we were ready. Because it was cold and a larger volume, it needed about 25 minutes to complete. There was lots of fragrant liquid -- we were glad to have great bread to sop it up. Everyone raved.

This was a very tasty dish. I, like most of the other readers, did tweak it a bit.To give it a true 'Rockafeller' taste I added a 1/4 cup of fat free half and half towards the end. I served this over cheese ravioli which was great.

I followed the recipe using all the ingredients as stated although I used a little more cheese sprinkled over the top before baking it. Very good without being as heavy as a scampi with all the butter etc...

I'll have to try this again without salting the shrimp. I added crumbled bacon, probably why it was too salty, but I like the bacon in it. Definitely needs more spinach, maybe another 1/2 package.

Fantastic flavor; simple and quick. Also works for a light main course. I used slightly more Pecorino Romano and then grated some on top before baking. The combination of sweetness from the Pernod and the hint of heat from the hot sauce was terrific.

Nice and Quick. I did not have Pernod so I used a bit of Star Anise (dry) and it worked really well. Nice light bistro quality food at home. (Makes kitchen smell really good to!).

We loved this! Used the juice from half a lemon instead of the Pernod. Grocery didn't have basil leaves, so just used the spices - turned out amazing! I let chunks of the Romano cheese sort of bake in the pan to add like a fried cheese accent to it all. Served it with angel hair pasta - you don't even need a sauce on the pasta - this is it! My advice - use a large pan because the spinach looks like alot at first, but once it wilts down, it really isn't that much, and you're going to wish you had more!

Used vermouth as other reviewers suggested. The taste was just not great -- I wanted something with a little more oompf.

I doubled the spinach, used dry vermouth instead of Pernod, and served over angel hair pasta... excellent way to impress my girlfriend during Lent!

This one is a keeper! My husband said I could make it again anytime. I'll be making it for guests often as it is very easy. You could actually prepare the spinach topping ahead of time, top the shrimp & bake when your guests arrive. I took one reviewers advise and added more cheese on top. Lastly, I flamed the Pernod after adding it. Yummy!

Never had a scampi so rich and delicious. Every variation of Scampi I've ever prepared has been easy to make but this one is by far the easiest... and best! We used anisette instead of the Pernod's.

I just realized I did not include everything I changed in my review...I did not use Pernod or any alternative, instead I added juice from one whole Myer lemon. I used leeks instead of green onions, and added about 2 tablespoons of butter. I used frozen, already cleaned, rock shrimp. It came out excellent...the only thing I'd do different next time is add more spinach and only sprinkle the cheese on after placing the mixture on the shrimp.

If you're looking for a quick easy shrimp dish this is it! I adjusted a few things, mainly adding a juice from one fresh myer lemon. I can't imagine it without the lemon...it was great. I also used leeks instead of green onions. Works well with rock shrimp.

Rating: 2
Easy to make but not great. The mixture overpowered the shrimp. Next time, I will saute the shrimp in butter and a bit of garlic powder first, then put the topping on and broil until bubbly. I did not use liquor this time, so I may try white wine. I'll try this one again with these adjustments.

Very easy to make and excellent flavor. We like the Pernod flavor. I made it with Gruyere cheese and it was a little creamier. Definately a hit and worth making again!

Great stuff - easy, fast and adaptable. I did tweak it a bit as I didn't have all the ingredients: used sweet onion, dried basil and added anise seed in place of the pernod. Also reduced the garlic - it seemed excessive and I love garlic - added some very lean bacon, a little lemon zest and put some extra cheese on top. A note on presentation - nestle the shrimp together like a 69 and you'll have a better platform for the shrimp mixture. Watch the baking time - easy to overcook. Addendum: just made this a 2nd time - instead of baking the shrimp I sauted w a bit of garlic, then put the spinach mix in heaps in a baking dish, put the shrimp on top, sprinkled some extra cheese on top and finished under the broiler. MUCH easier to control. Husband loved it.

Very disappointing. I never had pernod before, but I like other anise-flavored liquors so I shelled out $25 to buy a bottle. It was so terrible - what a waste of shrimp. (and my money on that liquor.) My advice - if you have any reservations about the Pernod, try white wine or something you know you do like. The awful flavor of the liquor is soaked up by the spinach and it's a very bad meal. Maybe the worst meal I've ever cooked.

We have made this dish many times. We add bacon and double the spinach. Excellent and very tasty. Everyone we have made this for has been impressed. Simple recipe, sofisticated taste.

A definite four-forker...this is my new favorite recipe! I made it with frozen shrimp that were already deveined and shelled and it was still delicious. Didn't have Pernod so I used Vermouth...YUM. I think the presentation is really elegant. I'm trying to decide what would be best to serve it with; my husband and I though maybe wild rice, or possibly sliced and then baked (w/olive oil, salt and pepper) potatoes. I like the idea of serving it with filet mignon. I will make this for our guests next weekened...very easy and quick, and impressive!

Wonderful! A quick and very flavorful shrimp dish we like as much as the Sichuan style shrimp recipe that's also on this site. I increased the hot sauce (I always do) and will increase the spinach next time as well.

I tried a variation of this recipe. I did devein the shrimp, but left the shells on by slicing through the shell with a sharp paring knife. Dean and Deluca recommend this for added flavor. Doesn't make for elegant eating, but try it. Also, fresh shrimp is a must. Made it with previously frozen shrimp and found it rubbery and tasteless. Would definitely do again. I am planning a party where I will serve individual portions baked in ramekins. Enjoy!

Great recipe. I substituted Marsala for Pernod & used seasoned rice wine vinegar. I also used about 2lb of shrimp. I made it for a friend & sent her home with the recipe she liked it so much!

Used this as an appetizer for 24 people, 3 large shrimp each, cooked in 2 large pyrex baking dishes. All ingredients increased proportionately but did shallots instead of green onions, dry vermouth instead of Pernod; added butter to saute garlic/shallots. Added grape tomatoes (sliced in half)and lemon zest at end of cooking spinach; squeezed lemon juice onto the shrimp before layering spinach. Used some more romano on top, not too heavy. Used spatula to remove from dish, flipped over to serve shrimp side up. Tomatoes added great color, flavor and increased the volume of "juices". Great success with our guests! And really easy.

This was an easy and delicious recipe. I omitted the anise flavored liquor, added mushrooms and bumped up the suggested asian garlic-chili sauce amount to get a very flavorful and damn quick dinner. A 1/2 lb. of shrimp fed 3 people.

This is so easy you wouldn't believe it. Anyone who complains about having to peel all the shrimp just doesn't have a good technique. (Soaking them in water beforehand also helps.)I substituted shallots for the green onion, and served the dish over pasta--using the juices at the bottom of the pie plate for a sort of white sauce. I would recommend squeezing lemon on it before eating. The only thing wrong with this dish is that it's not very attractive, but I think it makes up for it by taking almost no time and being delicious. The next time I make it, I'm going to mix the spinach and shrimp together rather than layer them, and throw in some cooked pasta and top it all with shredded Parm/Romano.

I made this last night and it was wonderful. I served it with a tossed green salad and Ciabatta bread with a little olive oil. I omitted the Pernod and used Vermouth, I crushed a heaping teaspoon of fennel seed in place of the Pernod. I cook out of this website 6 times out of 10, This is the 1st 4 I have replied to. It is simple and worth the time to devain the shrimp. I also used very large shrimp 8 to 12 count. Try it you will like it.....

Best dish in a long time! Pernod adds a wonderful flavor. Used 1 pkg. frozen, chopped spinach, thawed, squeesed; garlic, shallots, chives; 2T butter; 1 t Chinese chili/garlic sauce; 1 T Pesto, 14 shrimp (21-25/lb.). Used two individual dishes. 8 min at 450 just right. Super supper for two!

We have enjoyed this and served it several times to good reviews. Spicing it up with items such as lemon, more pernod or more hot sauce adds to the appeal. Go for it

To die for! I tweeked it a bit. I was liberal with my use of garlic (I used the jarred, crushed variety), used a dash liquid habanero for hot sauce, crushed basil in lieu of fresh and I added a tablespoon of Grey Poupon to the spinach sautee for extra flavor, in addition to some white wine instead of Pernod. This is wonderful as a side dish, when you are serving Filet Mignon as a main course.

This was a horrid waste of good shrimp. I love Oysters Rockefeller, but this rendition is just too busy for shrimp.

This dish was just OK. I didn't have pernod and used white wine instead. I will try it again and perhaps add lemon for a little zing and perhaps butter for more flavor.

This was a great recipe! I'm not usually an anise fan, but the pernod was subtle and added a lot to the recipe without being overpowering. I will make this one often as it was quick, easy, low fat and delicious.

This was good and very easy! I added a couple extra cloves of garlic, and substituted white wine in place of the pernod, as we don't really like the flavor of licorice. I served it with risotto. Very yummy!

Great recipe.....just a note to the cook from New York, this recipe has about 30 grams of fat (fat comes from the oil, cheese and the shrimp), so only 15 grams per serving.

Made this about a month ago, and enjoyed it. My husband said it was less interesting than some of the other low fat recipes I've made from Gourmet, though, and I'm inclined to agree. Served with some rice and sliced tomatoes, and it made a pretty plate. We're not much into licorice flavors, so used a little vermouth in place of the pernod.

Is the fat content information correct? I can't imagine how 1 T of olive oil leads to 19g of fat PER SERVING. It sounds delicious, but I won't make it if the nutritional info is right...

Trying to replicate a local restaurant's "Shrimp Florentine" -- the search led me to this recipe and it was fabulous. Didn't have Pernod so used some freshly ground fennel for the anise flavor and it was a fine substitute. It is a very elegant looking dish and tastes equally as elegant.
