wow, this recipe is easy and delicious. i used kerrygold kilaree irish white cheddar and served with crackers and apple slices. i think the ruby port is a must and am guessing that some of the people who rated this low might have used tawny port instead which would have made for an overpowering flavor.

I made this for a Christmas get-together, and it was not a hit. I used a good Tillamook cheddar and tawny port. All of the flavors (including teh green onions) were just too overpowering. Won't be making this again.

I have made this spread often to rave reviews. The problem is that I love it so much that wish there were more leftovers to use on toast or sandwiches. This is very easy to make and always leaves a good impression.

This was a great recipe. Fast and easy. We used in on warm pork sandwiches and stuffed into huge olives. Good with crackers but also veggies. No green onions on hand so I used a regular onion and it came out fine.

I really enjoy this cheese spread. I've made it several times and it has met with mixed reviews. Most have loved it. I'm preparing to make again for superbowl party. To me it is delicious and easy to make. Definately strong flavors here. Does not taste like port wine spreads that you get commercially. Must be the mustard. Keeps awhile in fridge. I've seen similar recipes using beer.

i've made this several times, though i usually use tawny port rather than ruby since i've got tawny around for drinking. I made it with ruby this time and i'm not as happy with it. The tawny port gives it a more interesting taste IMO.

I love this recipe. It's easy and tastes great. Don't expect it to taste like store-bought Port wine cheese spread, though (which, let's face it, does not taste at all like Port wine). This has a much more complicated flavor. If you don't like Port wine, this may not be the recipe for you!

I have served this spread at a number of parties and it always gets rave reviews. Definitely make it 1-2 days in advance to get the full flavor, and make sure to warm to room temperature before serving.

Super easy to make (even in small-capacity food processors like mine). I used 1/4 c port as others had said, and a nice, grainy mustard. Looked pretty, tasted okay but not as good as store-bought, processed port-cheddar spreads. Maybe I'll reduce the butter next time, though, or otherwise play around with it. It does keep very well, at least.

I'm glad I tested this on my husband before my guests! We agreed that it had a terrible taste, and 1/3 cup of Port seemed too overpowering.

Delicious, easy to make, and can be prepared a few days ahead and refrigerated. We liked it better when I used 1/4 cup of Port, rather than the 1/3 recommended. This spread improves with age - and can be kept in the refrigerator at least a week!
