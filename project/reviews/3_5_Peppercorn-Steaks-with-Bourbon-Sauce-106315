Best steak I have ever had. Simplest recipe I've ever used. Make it at least 5 times a year. YUM!

This was a winner with our company and family. I did the steaks on the bbq. The sauce I ended up using Irish Whiskey. I was nervous to ignite the whiskey so I just let the alcohol burn off in the pan, then preceeded with the recipe which was very good. A great meal for that special occassion.

This is an excellent way to prepare steak indoors and the sauce was wonderful. I am a believer that you must grill steaks outdoors to truly appreciate the flavor...however, I am always looking for recipes that will suprise me. I followed the sauce recipe almost exactly with exception of adding morels. It is season and I added about 12 small morels at the same time that I added the shallots. I am sure the sauce would have been fine without them, but the earthy taste goes well with this dish. I also thickened the sauce slighlty with cornstarch as others did....just a personal preference, no change in taste. Will definetly make this sauce again.

The sauce, oddly enough, was terribly bland, with little but the pepper showing through. There's so many good recipes for sauces on steaks out there that this one just doesn't rate.

This is a very good sauce and quite easy. I used it with a different steak recipe that also has very strong flavors and it complemented it well. Although I flambé often, his is a LOT of alcohol to flambé at once, so I added a rational amount, lit it, added more, lit it, etc.

WoW!!! Very tasty. A Definite keeper.

This recipe seemed fitting for a New Year's Eve (I hate to eat out that night), but instead of tenderloins steaks, I prefer New York Strips. Aside from that deviation, i followed the recipe to the letter. The table was awestruck, a good thing. My husband is adamant that this recipe be made again. One note of caution, it is highly advisable that the pan lid be within reach. Whereas I did not require it this time, I could envision a panic if the flaming process got out of hand. I will definately ensure that this precaution be followed every time I ignite alcohol.

I made this dish using Irish whiskey instead of bourbon. Great flavour. First time I flambéed something and it was a revelation to me. The next time I will also use the four-peppercorn mix which I know goes very well with a steak. Great recipe.

One of the best steak recipes we've found. The sauce is awesome.

Just made this for dinner with a NY Strip steak, and it turned out great. I did need to cook it a little longer on each side though. The sauce is great. You should have it like me, with some fresh Ciabatta bread to soak up the excess sauce!

Just okay. I was a bit disappointed - other Filet recipes on this site are far superior.

Excellent. I've made this dish several times and it is fantastic each and every time.

A great recipe. Instead of individual steaks I used a whole filet mignon. The sauce was top shelf. The twice-baked potatoes with mushrooms and cheese was the perfect side dish. A real winner.

This is great!!! I bought beautiful rib eye steaks, very easy recipe, my family loved it..I served with garlic mashed potatoes and salad greens with pears, walnuts & vinagarette dressing

This dish was excellent! Not only is it easy and relatively quick, but it has a WONDERFUL flavor! I found I had to cook the steaks quite a bit longer than is suggested in the recipe and I decided to thicken the sauce a bit at the end with some cornstarch. But those were the only major changes. If you thicken the sauce a little and serve this with mashed potatoes, the sauce makes a tasty gravy. Enjoy!

Great easy and quick recipe. I reduced the butter to 4 tablespoons and the sauce was still wonderful. Company worthy.

A great recipe for a Sunday night after working in the yard all day. All enjoyed the meal, including two fussy teens. I served this with garlic mashed Bliss potatoes and tomatoes with mozzarella and fresh basil. The wine was a nice Barbera.

These steaks were wonderful, but I had to thicken the sauce a bit. The flavor was great- very easy to make!

I definitely would make this again! The flavor of the sauce really perked up porterhouse steaks, and the double baked potatoes are a must!

Sauce totally broke down into a grease slick on my plate. Looked nothing like the photo in the magazine. Steak had flavor, yes, but there's much better steak au poivre recipes out there.

Excellent recipe for steak with a lovely little sauce. Perfect.
