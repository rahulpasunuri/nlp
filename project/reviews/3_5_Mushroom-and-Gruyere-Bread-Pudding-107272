This came out better than expected! After reading previous reviews, I followed the advice to use my gratin dish instead of the 13x9 pan so the pudding wouldn't come out looking small and flat. I used lots of leftover button mushroom stems and sliced creminis, which I chopped very fine. A taste test of the mushrooms and cheese together told me that the Marsala I have onhand would work fine, which it did. Used thyme instead of tarragon, also because that's what was onhand. The bread I used was a boule of pan de champagne and the last bits of a baguette, both hard as rocks. I sawed them into 1/8" thin slices and layered them generously - no counting. Did not have an hour for chilling, so I rearranged the fridge and put the gratin dish in the coldest section for 30mins. The result - beautiful! I was able to cut this into wedges which stood up tall and thick on the plate next to brussels sprouts and roasted chicken. Definitely going into my faves box.

I make this every year for Christmas dinner as a side dish for beef tenderloin or prime rib. I get constant rave reviews on it and it's an expected dish for me to make. I add more pepper, use oyster mushroom or shitake and skip the dried porcini. I do blend my mushrooms with the crimini though.

Excellent! Tasty, a great vegetarian dish. Used a heavy white bread.

For this I bought a bottle of Madeira? My fault really: when I look at the recipe, it's just toast, eggs and cheese, with some mushrooms thrown in. That's all I should have expected, yet somehow it sounded like it would be more interesting. It isn't. Disappointing.

Very good!!! Hubby and I really liked it. I did add dried chanterelles and morels as well as porcinis, and did soak dried 'rooms about 15 mins before adding. Used French bread which made it a little less like "pudding", but it's definitely a keeper.

This was good but not great. On paper, it sounded like it would be fantastic, but I was a bit disappointed with the results. Not that it was bad...just not as amazing as I expected. But if you really love mushrooms and cheese, then this is probably the recipe for you.

I agree that the 9"x13" pan is larger than necessary. The pudding is too shallow in the suggested pan and the top doesn't get 'wet' enough, though toasty, cheesy bread is not a bad thing. All in all very easy and very tasty. Probably would be a good one to make with and for the kids.

This got rave reviews from the guests at Thanksgiving breakfast. The 9x13 dish was clean by the time the six of us finished.

This was the best dish (out of several GREAT dishes) at Thanksgiving. It tastes SO fattening and looks so pretty. Everybody raved. Put full recipe into a 9" oval baking dish; a 9x13 will make it too flat. Also, cut bread into cubes for each layer; it makes a much prettier dish that way.
