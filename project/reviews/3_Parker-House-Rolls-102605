Very good rolls! Light and fluffy. Did not coat with butter and still came out amazing. Seriously a wonderful thanksgiving roll.

I think this is a great recipe. They are light and delicately flavored. I followed the recipe exactly except I needed a little more flour than the ingredients called for, just enough to make it the dough stiff enough to handle. These are perfect Christmas or Thanksgiving rolls.

I grew up making Parker House rolls with my dad every Christmas and Easter. To the Cook from Toronto: We always brush these with butter when they are are piping hot out of the oven or in the last several minutes of baking. This way rolls continue rising in the oven as they bake and are beautifully glossy when you serve them. Absolute comfort food.

Nothing special.

Salt deactivates yeast. Which is why you never add them at the same time.

Everything was fine until I brushed them with butter just before baking and that caused them to lose their rise. I tried leaving them to rise some more, but they didn't seem to want to do that. I ended up with delicious, but flat, rolls. I'll try them again but not brush them next time.

These Parker House Rolls work out well every time, and everyone loves them! They are easy to make, and for people who have lactose/dairy issues, I substitute margarine for the butter and rice milk for the milk, and the rolls still are wonderful!

I haven't yet made this recipe but I do have to comment on some of the mistaken information posted here. Sugar does not kill yeast, it activates yeast. Yeast works by consuming the sugar and excreting carbon dioxide and alcohol as byproducts. This is what makes bread rise. What does kill yeast is proofing it in liquid at too high a temperature. If you find your rolls won't rise, it is likely you have heated the milk/butter mixture to high. You should also check the expiration date of your yeast - if it old, there may be a lot of dead yeast cells that won't activate. Also, be sure to knead according to directions as this helps the dough to form gluten which helps trap the gas formed by the yeast consuming sugars and in turn allows the dough to rise. Hope this helps.

I made this recipe and they did not rise. Never again! Ali, Montreal, QC

These were good, I would recommend that if you make them DEFINITELY use the bread flour in addition to the AP flour, because I only had AP available and I feel like they weren't quite right because of this. Still darn good, though.

I've made these twice and am still not thrilled with these rolls. Time to look for a different recipe.

For those of you that read these reviews, please keep in mind that sugar DOES NOT KILL yeast. In fact, sugar is what yeast eats - ever hear of beer?

Perfect! I made these just as the recipe said, and they're delicious, and the perfect texture--not too heavy, and not too light.

Loved them! In fact, the whole family loved them. Easy to make, and for those fond of yeast breads, they're a treat! I've been made to promise they'll be on every Thanksgiving table.

Light, flaky, chewy, delicious! The perfect, classic dinner roll. This recipe is now a staple in my house, although I cheat and dump everything in the bread machine, and just shape the dough by hand when it's finished (then let it rise before baking--if you don't let it raise it can be dense). The dough is excellent as is, but you can also make it more healthy and the rolls still taste "great, light, flaky" rather than "healthy." So instead of the flour, sometimes I do 1 cup oatmeal, 1 cup whole wheat (or spelt) flour, and 2 cups white flour ... or 2 1/4 c white flour, 1 1/4 wheat flour, and 1/4 oat bran.

This is supposed to be a dense roll if you were looking for light and fluffy rolls then this isn't the recipe for you.

USE 1 CUP OF SOFT AS SILK BRD FLOUR USE 1 CUP OD ALL PURPOSE FLOUR USE 1 CUP OF BREAD FLOUR, IF MORE FLOUR IS NEED, USE ALL PURPOSE FLOUR, HIGH ALTITUDE USE WATER, THAN MILK,THIS IS A GREAT ROLL BASE RECIPE

Great taste, however, a bit dense. I'm going to make them again - next time I will take the advice of another reviewer - less sugar on the onset. I think it killed the yeast so I didn't get the "rise and fluff" I would have liked.

I truly enjoyed these rolls. I could not stop eating them. I will be making these again! I used skim milk instead of whole, but I don't think it hurt anything.

Sugar doesn´t kill yeast, salt does.

I agree with the other reviewers, these rolls were too heavy. And I appreciate the coaching around the sugar, when I was making them I wondered if it would be a problem. I will certainly try it again with this modification.

I've taken many baking courses and especially those on breads (culinary school). This recipe doesn't agree with my method to making bread, so I modified it and the rolls were spectacular--my husband said they were the best rolls he had ever had! Sugar kills yeast! Adding a tablespoon of sugar to the yeast at the beginning is a mistake, I feel. I stir together the yeast and the warm water and then sprinkle a very small amount (pinch) of sugar on top just to get the yeast going. When the yeast is proofed, I add a bit of flour first, then the lukewarm milk/butter, then more flour THEN I add the sugar (all 3 tablespoons) and salt. The flour will "protect" the yeast. I say all of this because some reviewers said their rolls turned out heavy. That would indicate to me that the yeast was not working properly (possibly some was killed off from the heavy amount of sugar). Just a thought . . .

I think these are the best rolls I've ever eaten, not just made. They aren't dense or heavy--I get asked about them every Thanksgiving.

I LOVED these rolls and so did my step son. We made a double recipe for a BBQ this summer and I'm making them again for Thanksgiving. Great to eat the same day, moist and delicious... the next day they were O.K.

These were OK. They were much denser than I would have hoped. I didn't overwork the dough, they were just very heavy. A bit too much work for the results.

I am going to try to make these one more time.My guests said they were very good but I thought they could have been fluffier. I agree with not buttering them before they go into the oven. I do not have experience with yeast doughs and this was easy to handle.

I added an extra tablespoon of sugar. I used an electric mixer and used dough hook for only about three minutes. The recipe doubles well. They freeze well. To freeze: Complete recipe, but only bake for about 10-15 minutes. Don't let brown. Bring to room tempature before putting them in the freezer.

Very dense, heavy rolls. Every other roll recipe I have ever tried was better - I was disappointed with these.

these were very good-just try not to handle them too much and make tight balls

I have made these rolls twice. They are a little tricky to make.I acually used salted butter the first time. That did not change the taste much. I suggest buttering the rols after they come out of the oven.
