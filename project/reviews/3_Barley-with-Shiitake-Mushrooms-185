This is pretty tasty, but I could only give it a three because I wish it had more color. I used a a cup of instant barley to 2 cups broth and threw in some crushed red pepper for color and kick. Will most likely make again, but not something I'm in a hurry to make again.

To adjust this recipe for quick-cooking barley, I reduced the 3 cups broth to about 3/4 cup. Reduced cooking time after adding the barley to about 12 mins.

To cook barley much faster, you should soak the barley in cold water 8 hours to overnight. This way the barley is perfectly cooked in about 15 minutes.

It was okay, the sauce was good. I wouldn't make it again because barley takes long to cook, longer than they has said.
