WOW.The best roasted chicken I have ever eaten !!.I used 6 chicken breasts(with bone and skin) and massaged them good with oil and about 4 TBS minced fresh garlic.I then sprinkled them generously with salt, placed them in glass dish skin side down and drizzled a little more oil over them, tucking in a few sprigs of rosemary and thyme.Placed dish in frig overnight. Next evening I heated 2 TBS oil in a Calphalon fry pan and fried breasts in pan( skin side down) til deep amber color.I then placed pan in 350 oven with breasts still skin side down and roasted for 30 minutes. Turned breasts skin side up and roasted another 20 min. THe skin was so crispy and the meat so moist. Oh so good.

I left some of the sprigs of fresh herbs on the chicken when I sauteed and baked it to increase the flavor. I also shoved some of the crushed garlic under the skin in addition to rubbing it on the skin surface. Sauteeing the chicken didn't work that well for me - the skin kept sticking to the pan...so I ended up baking most of the chicken at 415 degrees and it browned beautifully and tasted great. There really is no need to saute the chicken before baking. I served this at Rosh Hashanah and everyone loved it - even my 7 year old niece who usually refuses to eat anything!

A simple, easy and good-tasting recipe. I used boneless-skinless breasts and just baked.

No doubt this is a great recipe, but most of us would find it way too mild. Indeed, in what would seem impossible, the larger the chicken, the blander the taste, no matter how much more of the ingredients you add. So, I prepared the chicken exactly as described, but added my own twist to it by adding on the following : a few tablespoons of soy sauce, a teaspoon of sugar mixed with a teaspoon of ground ginger, and some dried parsley. Believe me, this makes such a difference.Of course, you could add whatever you wanted to and still come up with a great dish, but the sugar-ginger mix really makes a great deal of a difference - try it, you won't be disappointed.

I rubbed the chicken parts with garlic, and put the chicken with the garlic, oil and herbs into a sealed plastic bag for about eight hours, refigerated, of course. I browned the chicken in a cast iron pan on the hot side of a gas barbecue, turned the chicken, moved the pan to the "off" side, closed the barbecue lid and left it for about 25 minutes. Result: the best roast chicken ever. I can imagine varying the flavorings. Example: a little oil, garlic, soy sauce and star anise.
