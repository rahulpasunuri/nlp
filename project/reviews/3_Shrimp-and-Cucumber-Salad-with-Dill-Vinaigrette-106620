I made this for a picnic and it was so refreshing after sitting in the hot sun. I was really generous with the dill in the vinaigrette, as well as salt and pepper. Instead of shallots, I thinly sliced the green stalks of spring onions.

Although this salad doesn't have big flavours, I found the subtle dressing very satisfying and refreshing. In my case I used it after a smoked salmon appetizer, so the salad cleansed the palate. I cooked the shrimp in advance as the recipe suggests but I would probably put the cooked cooled shrimp in the vinagrette for at least a few hours before composing the salad. I put the leftover shrimp in the some leftover dressing and had a very tasty treat the next day.

Very refreshing. Easy to make (I used pre-cooked shrimp)on a hot summer day. I added more seasoning to spice it up again - but I'd definitely make it again.
