This is a very easy and satisfying tart to make for an afternoon brunch or wine and cheese party!I did add some balsamic vinegar to the mushroom mixture which gave it some "umph"! You can also makde a lot more of the mushroom mixture than the recipe calls for, and more thyme. Definitely plan to make it again!

Absurdly good. If I could, I would eat this every day. I would be very fat but very happy. I added a bit of extra fresh thyme but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Divine.

This is a solid recipe...good but not great. I made it as a main course and served it alongside some veggies. I followed it exactly but added quite a bit more goat cheese since the amount the recipe called for was not enough to cover the tart evenly. I'm considering making this in individual puff pastry shells next time as an appetizer. I think smaller bites might be easier to eat than the larger slices you get from a full blown tart.

This was easy and delicious. I didn't bother with rolling out or cutting the tart. I had doubled the mushroom mixture, so I just folded over the edges of each sheet and baked them that way. It did take a while, though. I also didn't bother with the thyme, because this was the last item in a marathon of Christmas cooking, and I just didn't feel like picking all those little leaves off. The duxelles had enough flavor without it, though. I don't think it even needed the nutmeg. Very fast and easy, and I will likely make it again.

Once I figured out that you get two 12 by 5 inch rectangles it makes more sense. I just cut the rectangle in half the long ways and then made the strips for each side. I painted the egg wash on the bottom part. I used a bit more goat cheese and crimini (baby bella) mushrooms. I added some thyme when sauteeing the mushrooms and a bit more when doing the shallot. And then on top - way more fresh thyme.

The only change I made was that I used yellow onions instead of shallots because I didn't have any on hand. The final product was delicious. Very filling and satisfying.

I really liked this but agree with the previous reviewer that it was lacking a little something. Maybe some additional fresh herbs or balsamic? I was very tempted to deglaze the pan and create a sauce for chicken after the mushroom/shallot saute...would be delicious.

I am not sure this recipe really should get three forks, but since it was so easy as well as very tasty, it does. It is good, but not as delicious as I'd hoped for, based upon other reviewers' comments. I added, as suggested, a couple splashes of balsamic vinegar, as well as a sprinkling of comte, but I still found the overall dish to be a little lacking in pizzaz.

This is a fabulous recipe, very easy to make and really delicious. Note to "a cook" - perhaps you should spend some time addressing your anger issues instead of making a fool of yourself on Epicurious.

I made this recipe following the directions exactly and it worked out perfectly - tasty, too. To the recent (irate) reviewer, the puff pastry called for is quite different from phyllo dough (whose leaves are indeed a pain!). Frozen puff pastry sheets are a breeze to roll out - nothing like phyllo dough. That said, must we really "shame" fellow foodie reviewers? Happy 2007!

Nice, simple recipe. Made a pleasant dinner with a spinach salad and grilled ham steak. Note to the cook on 12/31/06, the recipe did not call for filo dough, it called for puff pastry dough. Completely different. Unfortunately your failure to note this fact was the cause of your difficulties with the recipe. I would suggest you re-read the recipe next time before lashing out at the reviewers.

The biggest part of what makes a recipe a good recipe is GOOD INSTRUCTIONS. Aside from the confusing directions regarding how to cut up the dough (I've read Ikea assembly instructions that make more sense) NO WHERE in this recipe is it mentioned that filo dough sheets must be individually brushed with BUTTER. Does the author assume that we are all filo-experienced chefs? The recipe caused me - an experienced, cook - nothing but aggravation & tears, as I attempted to make sense of it, prior to a New Year's Eve party. Shame on you, Epicurious! And shame on those of you who didn't make the ACTUAL RECIPE, yet rated your own changes so highly!!! Had you given an honest review of this piece of tripe, I NEVER WOULD HAVE WASTED THE TIME & $ TO MAKE IT!!!

Delicious and easy to make. I used dried thyme, which I added with the nutmeg and also splashed with balsamic vinegar. Made it in an 8x8 cake pan that produced some leftovers so I made little mushroom goat cheese 'pockets'. Wasn't sure about the function of the ceam at the end so I left it out. Served it with mussles in white wine sauce and a green salad. Will definitely be making again.

This was a big hit. I used a pâte brisée tart shell simply because I had one on hand. Next time I would use the puff as mine was a tad dry. But very tasty!

This recipe got raves at a wine tasting as a passed app. I took mini muffin tins and cut out the circles for the little cups, pre-cooking the pastry VERY lightly. We then filled them and made little caps for them. It made for a nice presentation (and helped soak up more of the wine!. I, too, cannot cook without wine and added sherry to the mushroom mixture, carmelizing the onions for a looong time.

I used ready-made filo cups -- very easy! I added sherry to the mushrooms while cooking, and everyone enjoyed these as an impressive appetizer. I skipped the thyme and the cream drizzle -- they didn't need it.

I doubled this recipe and took it to a football play-off party. Although my team lost, my appetizer was a hit. I doubled it and it was plenty for a party of 12ish. Don't stress about the exact size of your dough. Lots of variatios would work fabulously. I will definately make this again!

Really excellent. A wonderful mix of flavours and so easy. I used a goat cheese that had herbs already in it and frozen mini tart shells. Fabulous!

Excellent! Made them as mini-tarts using a mini-muffin pan. Excellent as a finger food.

This is a great recipe. I am making it for the third time this weekend for the future in-laws. I do use puff-dough rolled out for a crush instead of making my own.

Fabulous. Instead of tart shells, I made this into crostini. I mixed the goat cheese with the cream and thyme to make a spread for the toasted bread, then topped it with the mushroom mixture. Out of this world as big "croutons" on an arugula salad. And the balsamic is a must.

Would someone please explain how to cut up and assemble the 12" x 15" puff pastry sheet? The recipe makes it sound like you use only about one-third of the sheet and throw the rest away. Surely that's not right!

I made this for a party and it was a huge hit. I did add some balsamic vinegar (as suggested by other reviewers) and used fresh thyme in place of the dried. The taste was terrific and we had no leftovers!

Yum! I've made this twice now and they're really good and always a hit. I use the mini Athens brand fillo shells and adjust the recipe a bit (mostly to accomodate the mini-shells). First I cut the mushrooms in very small pieces so they fit in the shell. I also cook the mushroom shallot mixture much longer to carmelize the shallots(much better this way in my opinion). As another reviewer suggested, I add balsalmic vinegar towards the last third of the cooking. I add to taste but would guess it is probably about 1/4 cup for a double batch of this recipe. Doubling the recipe provides for filling of 45 mini pastry cups with a bit left for nibbling. I also only need about 4 oz of goat cheese when using the mini-cups. If you use the amount of goat cheese listed, you'll have way too much left over. Great recipe!

As a student at Johnson and Wales University in Providence, RI, we were required to design menus and cook them for one of our classes. I made this recipe and it was marvelous... So good in fact, I make it as an app. for holiday parties. Also very good as a lunch with a salad. Make sure your onions are very well carmelized!

I love mushrooms and puff pastry, but found this one to be a little plain. I was a good restaurant line chef and we made an appetizer with mushrooms, goat cheese and balsamic vinegar. I think this recipe would really benefit to a splash of balsalmic during the mushroom saute phase, and will add it next time I make it.

Great appetizer. puff pastry makes it so easy.

I used a portabello mushroom and since I didn't have any puff pastry, I just baked it in a baking dish and spread it on toast. Quick, simple, delicious and filling.

These were so, so good! They made me get all teary-eyed for France. My BF & I loved these tarts. I was in a hurry at the store and accidentally bought individual little puff pastry cups--it worked out great that way, and when I make this again, I'll do the same thing. Note: a box of 10 pastry cups is just about right for the amount of filling here. Followed the recipe exactly except I had another shallot I wanted to get rid of, so I used that. Very quick and easy if you chop everything up in the food processor. I knew something was up when my BF offered to clean up the kitchen. I went in to check on him, and he was stuffing leftover tarts into his mouth, which I intended to eat for my lunch today. Make these now and hide the leftovers!

It was simply incredible and very fun to make. It smelled delicious when making it, and was eaten very quickly. I will not only keep this recipe but give it to friends.......Keep on cooking

The second time I prepared this dish, my market was out of puff pastry sheets. I substituted the shells and was pleased with the results; I ended up using a little less goat cheese and a little more thyme in the filling.

Rating: 3
I agree with previous reviewers. This is very easy, which is nice if the rest of the meal is complicated, and is delicious. The cheese, mushroom, and thyme proportions are not hugely sensitive so just use whatever is ready to hand. I wouldn't substitute dried thyme for the fresh though - it's often too "twiggy". I'll definitely make it again.

Absolutely fantastic and surprisingly easy. Can't wait to make it again. Had no idea puff pastry was so easy to work with.

I have made this several times with rave reviews. I had a luncheon for the staff in my husband's office for Secretaries Day, making this as well as another version with smoked salmon, red onion, capers and cream cheese. Both were delicious!

I made this at the last minute for a dinner party. It's quick and easy and the flavors are great, and I hate mushrooms. I might skip the cream part the next time I do it. I also was not fussy about cutting the exact sizes for the pastry. Since i was running late, once i realized the recipe was trying to get me to make a box, I just did some quick cutting and pasting with egg wash. Now that i think about it, if I had the time, i could make individual tartlettes the next time. The size of the pastry box doesn't matter for the final look and flavor of the dish. It was great! I want to make it again today.

This was a pretty good dish. Next time I make it, I will cut the amount of cheese in half and double the amount of fresh thyme. It was easy to put together and looked nice, too.
