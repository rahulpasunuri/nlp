Easy and delicious. Made without wasabi because I didn't have it and no one I was serving likes spicy food. Flavors were absorbed quickly by the cucumbers, so I was able to serve it within a half hour of making it. Served it with shrimp and a feta ricotta spread with fresh herbs (from New Moosewood cookbook) and crostini for a lovely, light, summer appetizer combo. Enjoy!

I have been making this for years without the wasabi. The only difference is I add very thinly sliced sweet onions. It's drop dead fabulous!

So quick to make, and so delicious. They are an ideal side for all types of grilling main dishes. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

This is a great, super-easy recipe for cucumbers.. I love the sweetness of the rice vinegar with sugar and just a hint of wasabi (it's not hot!) I will be making this again this summer!

I followed other comments and added more wasabi & it turned out perfect. Great dish, will absolutely make it again.

Quick, easy and simple side dish. No problems with the recipe. It's super basic, but has great flavors, and made a great side to our grilled squid and daikon!

I made a mistake in measuring and added way more wasabi than I should have--but it was great! I recommend my mistake.

I liked this, but I couldn't taste the wasabi. Next time, I'll double it and see how it turns out.

I did not have the right cucumbers, but it still was so good. Can not wait to make it the right way. My husband loved it too.

I really liked the taste and will make this again! I made right before dinner. Not sure I would make them a day ahead as the recipie says you can do, I think they would get way too mushy for my liking...

I've made this twice now, with cucumbers from my garden. Didn't have wasabi powder so used some prepared horseradish. I found that salting the cucumbers in a bowl, letting them sit, then rinsing them and then letting them drain in the colander worked better for getting the salt out. Lovely, tangy flavor!

These were so easy and very yummy. I served them alongside a grilled jerk pork tenderloin and some broccoli slaw. What a bright, healthy meal! Next time I would add another 1-2 tsp of sugar, since I like my pickles a little bit sweeter, but otherwise would not change it.

A perfect addition to any Japanese meal!

These are so good...really loved the simplicity of flavors, yet with a bit of a kick from the wasabi. I made exactly as written (and loved it) but decided to kick up a bit more with extra wasabi and soy sauce...just a bit...loved it!
