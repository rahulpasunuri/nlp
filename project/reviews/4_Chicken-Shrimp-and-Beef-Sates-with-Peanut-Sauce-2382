Only made the beef and chicken, and used flank steak instead of skirt steak. Simple recipe to prepare, and I heard a lot of praise from my guests. I liked how the sauce could be made well ahead of time, and the skewers could be prepped before guests arrive. Easier on the hostess!

I made just the peanut sauce to put on noodles. I used the pasta water in place of broth (I was out) and added 2 T Hoison sauce, and powdered ginger vs. fresh, all other ingredients the same. I garnished with cilantro and black sesame seeds. It was good on the noodles but MUCH better the next day as a dipping sauce for soy-marinated London broil.

I didn't make the Sates, only the peanut sauce. It was delicious!!! Needed a little additional brown sugar, made a half portion. Halved perfectly. Made with summer thai rolls. Used normal (not low sodium) soy, and was a good level of saltiness. Used smart balance chunky peanut butter, was still very good. Will definitely make again and again!

I made this for a 4th of July event at our mountain home for 7 adults and 5 kids. Everyone loved it. The recipe makes way too much peanut sauce but we just used it the next night for a dipping sauce. We served it with portabello mushrooms marinated in the same sauce (for 15 minutes) and cabbage and corn slaw with cilantro and orange dressing. My husband and I put the whole thing together in a little over an hour. Great for the summer and beat the boring brats and weiners no one ate.

I have made this dish "THE BEST APPETIZER" and party favorite by going the extra mile (which isn't much for anyone who cooks). Instead of using all teryaki sauce for the sate', I use about HALF a cup of teriyaki sauce, and a QUARTER cup of SOY, and HOISIN sauce instead. This cuts down on the real heavy teriyaki taste, and gives it a more subtle, sweeter taste. You can adjust to your own tastes, but this seems to be a happy middle. I personally don't like an all teriyaki taste to Sate's. That's for teriyaki dishes. To give it that REAL THAI RESTUARANT SPICE, add half a teaspoon ground cumin, 1 teaspoon curry powder, half a teaspoon ground pepper, quarter teaspoon salt, and a quarter/to half a teaspoon of 5 spice, to the sate. It leaves you breathless! This is the way I make it everytime, and I get people telling me I need to open a restuarant with this stuff. Also I have found best results have come with marinading it for NO MORE THAN 2 HOURS! The marinade will overpower most of the food.

One of my favorite summer standbys for the grill. I've tried it indoors, not the same at all. I skip the shrimp now and my family can't do peanuts. Great marinade, but watch the lime on the chicken. Don't marinade more than recommended. The acid in the lime will cook the chicken- like seviche.

P.S. - I would assume not to double the peanut butter either.

For the cook from Bermuda Dunes, CA - I want to try this and adding the coconut milk sounds great. However, do I need to double the amounts of everything else in the dipping sauce with the exception of the chicken broth?

Rating: 4
This recipe is EXCELLENT! I've made it numerous times for parties of up to 150 since first finding the recipe on Epicurious in October 2002. However, the Sate Recipe that now appears is missing the 1 1/2 cups of unsweetend coconut milk that was in the first recipe - I also add chopped cilantro. I urge everyone to try adding the coconut milk! It definitely adds another dimension to the recipe. And I double the amount of brown sugar and use about 1 Tablespoon of dried crushed red pepper to the Peanut Sauce for added zing!

I have made this and a chicken variation as a party app. The peanut sauce makes it. Don't be afraid to bump up the spice heat! Also, I use the long bamboo sticks and leave them on as handles... great for a cocktail party...

Really tasty. I used top sirloin and fresh Louisiana shrimp. Now, if someone could just tell me how to avoid burning the bamboo skewers! I soaked them in water for about 90 minutes prior to grilling, but they still looked like burnt matchsticks by the time the meats were finished.

I've been making this since the recipe appeared in BA. Wonderful, but be sure not to overmarinate the beef - it gets mealy if marinated too long. Learned that lesson the hard way with some good quality filet mignon....

This was a big hit - especially the peanut sauce. I'm a lover of natural peanut butter and (even though cautioned against it in the recipe) I used the creamy, salted natural kind. It was great and licked clean by the end of the night.

Delicious and easy!!I made this as an appetizer and as a main course using only the chicken and beef. It was a big hit on both occasions, with kids and adults. I though the sauce was fine, if a little thin - the recipe makes way more sauce than needed. I will half it next time.

I will be using this for a holiday party soon and I was doing a trial run last night. I thought the recipe was quite good. I didn't do the shrimp and I used turkey breast filets instead of chicken. For the sauce I used about half a can of the broth and I found that it needed more spice for my taste. We tried this sauce, a bought sauce and the reduced marinade for dipping. This was a much more pronounced peanut flavor and that's what we liked. I will use this recipe again.

Delicious!! This has become one of my summer staples, and every time I serve it I get rave reviews. As I never have teriyaki sauce around, I just use soya sauce and a couple of squeezes of honey....works wonderfully. As for the peanut sauce, the given amount of chicken broth was a bit much...just add until you get the right consistency. This is perfect with the Indonesian spiced rice from this site...YUM!!

To the cook from Atlanta with the thin sauce- Cornstarch wasn't necessary. For peanut sauce, simply let the whole mixture simmer on the stove at about medium (keep stirring such that sugar on the bottom doesn't burn) for about 15 minutes and the sauce will approach the desired consistency. Hope that helps!

We did not think this recipe was anything great. The satay marinade was simply okay and peanut sauce was not nearly as good as most others that we have had. Maybe because we prefer a bit sweeter sauce? Would not make this again.

We were very disappointed with this dish. We love Thai food and have had many different kinds of peanut sauces. This was awful. It was way too runny and separated! I would majorly cut down on the amount of chicken broth and maybe up the peanut butter. Overall, it was way too much sauce for a small amount of meat.

I have tried at least six peanut sauces, and this is by far the best ... quick, simple, smooth, and just the right level of spice. I make this all the time as a main dish with chicken breasts and broccoli or string beans ... I couldn't ask for more!

I used a store bought peanut sauce because I didn't feel like making the one in the recipe, but the marinade for the meat was absolutely delicious. The only change that I made was that I slight reduced the amount of ginger. One warning...keep an eye out while cooking the satay; it can overcook very quickly.

Based on the many complimentary reviews, I set out to make this for my Oscar party last Sunday. My guests were either being nice or they really enjoyed it, but I did not like the flavor of the peanut sauce at all. The lime juice came through very strongly. My favorite peanut sauces for satay I've had in Thai restaurants had a creamy base (coconut milk perhaps) and bits of peanuts. The flavor was complex and full. I will look for another recipe and skip on this one. Pity.

I used filet strips for the beef but my butcher sliced them too thin and they fell apart on the grill. Keep the strips on the thick side if you're using filet. Besides that minor glitch this dish was a big hit, even with my palate-challenged in-laws. Serve it with the spiced Indonesian rice (as suggested in the full menu) for an impressive meal.

We made this on the 4th and everyone loved it. We used skirt steak and chicken and they both were quite tender. I recomend marinating for a few hours but not too long. We substituted cayane pepper in place of crushed red pepper. It gave the sauce a little kick. We had a lot of left over peanut sauce, so we made more chicken sates the next day.

Rating: 4
These were so yummy! I only used chicken breast strips, which I think I may have over-marinated. Be warned that marinating too long will leave you with tough meat. It was almost like a ceviche marinade; I let the chicken soak for almost five hours, and the meat actually "cooked" a little bit because of the acidic ingredients. Next time, I will definitely marinate for no more than one hour. Otherwise, the sates turned out so flavorful and delicious. The peanut sauce was restaurant quality, too! I love this recipe!

Great summer dish - made it for the 4th of July and people couldn't stop talking about the peanut sauce. We let the meat marinade for a little longer, then took the meat out of the marinade, then finally soaked them again briefly just before we put them on the skewers. Delicious.

Wonderful, very nice. I did use a few short cuts to speed things up-for instance a stick blender did a great job to process the marinade and the sauce. I used a big disposable drinking cup to wiz up the marinade, added a little saki and poured it over chicken tenderloins in a baking dish...baked it till done and served with peanut sauce on pasta (spaghetti or linguine for instance). Stick blender did a great job with the peanut sauce too-the ingredients wizzed up right right in the pan. Just perfect!

I have been making this recipe every summer since since it came out in one of your special "barbeque" issues. I have made it for showers, birthdays, rehearsal dinners and even one wedding. It is a hit every time!! My only suggestion is to add more "heat" (spice) to the peanut sauce.
