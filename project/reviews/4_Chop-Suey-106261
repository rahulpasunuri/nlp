DELICIOUS! It was worth every minute of veggie chopping just to hear my spouce say 'mmmm' with every bite. I have been cooking a long time so I made some minor adjustments based on what I know we like, but overall I followed the recipe. I doubled the sauce, used 5 cloves of garlic, added hot red pepper flkes and hot chili paste and a couple of teaspoons of sherry. It is definately going in my 'keeper' file.

I reviewed this in '05, but a couple of tips. You can cut way back on the calories by stir-frying two veggies at a time - as long as they cook the same amount of time - i.e. pepper/onions together, mushrooms/snow peas together. I only use 4 teaspoons of oil in this entire recipe. Julienne the pork or whatever meat you are using - one pound per 6 servings is plenty and you want small, bite-sized pieces. I serve with brown rice. A family and client favorite. It keeps well in the fridge for many days and freezes nicely. This is an American dish, not Chinese. Read the prologue to the recipe.

Made this tonight; very good. Hubby loved it. Here's what I'd do next time: Double the garlic and add ginger. Chop pork tenderloin in half for smaller pieces. Use 1/2 red and 1/2 green pepper for color. For the final sauce, make the chicken stock on the "shy" side of 1/4 cup and increase the amount of oyster and soy sauce.

Made this the first time with buffalo sirloin steaks. Didn't have all the veggies but it was still AMAZING! My husband and I have decided that the oyster sauce makes a big difference. Making it again tonight with elk steaks.

The only additions I would suggest are a finely minced Thai chile with the celery to perk up all the other flavors, a tiny dash of five spice powder and a pound of peeled and deveined raw shrimp just a few minutes before serving, letting the hot Suey cook the shrimp right at the end. I also sometimes substitute chicken dark meat for the pork. This is the "go to" oriental dish around here.

I have made this recipe for my wife numerous times over the years. She loves it! It is very time consuming in the preparation but worth it. Make certain to do all your prep before placing the wok on the stove. ENJOY...

Definately a keeper! I think I finally found an alternative to Chinese take-out. Didn't have all of the vegetables the recipe called for but had a lot from our CSA share that needed to be used and it still turned out great. I used celery, carrots, broccoli, leeks, kale, green peppers. Two thumbs up from my boyfriend.

Takes a little longer than expected, and I'm not sure if its really necessary to cook each vegetable individually, but its worth it. Very good recipe. We put chow mein noodles on top, added a nice crunch.

this is a great weeknight meal. A bit time consuming, but the results are beautiful. I ommited the snow peas, and ad canned baby corn instead. Made extra sauce and served over rice. Hubby liked it a lot!

When I read this recipe, it sounded good. I finally got the opportunity to make this last night. I doubled the oyster sauce, soy and added about 2 tsp of ginger. Besides the fact I had so much fun chopping all the veggies, it tasted awesome with jasmine rice. This one is fun with some wine in the kitchen!!!

This is absolutely delicious. I agree with all those who note that though it seems like just a basic vegetable stir-fry it is well worth the extra effort. The only change I made was to use some tempura oil along with the vegetable oil.

I give this recipe 3 forks because my husband loved it...but for me, this recipe doesn't provide the "zing" that I look for in Asian food. Next time I make it, I'll add much more garlic, and also some ginger...maybe some red pepper flakes. Though time-consuming, in the end it's beautiful; it's healthy, and it's a bit 'blah.'

Excellent! I was doubtful about the flavor from the ingredients list but was pleasantly surprised. Better than chop suey I have had in the past and so easy to make

I cook lots of Oriental food and expected something ordinary, despite the good reviews. But this was delicious and we felt virtuous eating it. Added more sauce ingredients and served over rice. Great way to do the veggies.

Delicious! We will definately make this again. My husband and I received rave reviews from my folks. Make sure to allot plenty of time for mis en place, as it takes along time!!!

This recipe was delicious. I had to divide the ingredients, because I made it for myself but forgot to divide the amounts of the soy sauce and oyster sauce. The taste was only a little stronger, but it was still delicious. I will definitely make it again.

This is a great recipe, well-suited to whatever vegetables you have on hand. Also works well with leftover pork roast, sliced and julienned.

Made this for a client's request today, and it was very good. I cut way down on the salt for her, as she's pre-diabetic, but it still held quite a bit of flavor and the texture was excellent. Will definitely make again and again.

We have made this recipe numerous times for ourselves and guests. Eac time it received nothing but raves! Be certain to buy the best quality, freshest ingredients to ensure the best taste.

The cooking and individual seasoning of each vegetable really works the flavor. You can make it veggie or use another kind of meat. If you make veggie I suggest adding a little more of the veggies or adding another veggie,etc, to make up for the omitted meat. Served atop ramen noodles. Nice subtle flavor. Haven't had this good of Chop Suey in long time.

This is really good. Easy, too. Instead of bok choy, I used bagged cole slaw cabbage. Also used pre-sliced mushrooms. Cut way down on prep time. Also used julienned red pepper instead of mushrooms. Yummy!

This dish was very good. I tried to chop as fast as I could and it still took one and 1/4 hour - just like they said! One point: I cooked the pork 2x as long as they suggested and it was still a little pinkish/raw in sections...next time I would julienne the slices (is it ok to use that word for something other than veggies?)

I have been looking for a recipe that was as good as my favorite Chinese food restaurant. This one is better. It is not slimy at all yet it has the same fantastic flavor. I omitted the Bok Choy and the recipe did not skip a beat. Fantastic. My husband can not stop talking about it. This will entering my frequently used file.

Great one-dish and oh so healthy dinner. The flavor is wonderful. I made a couple of changes - I used only half the salt, and doubled the marinade/sauce ingredients. Definitely a keeper.

An easy and healthy recipe. My family LOVED this dish. I have two teenagers who have recently become so picky about what they eat and they even had seconds! The second time I made this dish I added low mein nuddles along with a sherry, soy sauce and chicken broth mixture and it came out fabulous.

Very authentic....this one is better then the recipe from my Asian cookbook! Go figure!

I do a lot of Asian style dishes - we especially love Thai food, therefore, I was surprised at how much my husband loved this dish - it sounded a lot blander than what we're used to (OK - I did add a couple of squirts of Thai chili sauce at the end, but just a couple). I also left out the bamboo shoots

Rating: 4
Very delicious and very healthy dish. The only change I made was leaving the bamboo shoots out because they taste watery and adding some sesame oil just before finishing. I also added some sugar. Tasted very much the same as Chop Suey from our Chinese takeaway. I will make this again.

I expected this to more healthful than tasty, but my husband and I loved it. We felt it needed more oyster sauce, which we added. Otherwise, the crispness and variety of vegetables were super. I've cooked and we've eaten Chinese food for years, and this will have a place at our table.

Chicken was used instead of pork and a tablespoon of sherry and sugar added to marinade. I cooked the chicken ahead of time and added at the end. We served this with chow mein noodles and rice. Wonderful dish!

It was quite a bit of work to chop all the veggies and individually saute them, plus I was disappointed it didn't have that familiar "chop suey flavor". I can't say what that is, I've only had this in restaurants, but at least you can't say it smothers the flavors of the veggies! Who knows, maybe this version is more authentic than the restaurant version. It got a lot better once I assembled everything and added generous soy sauce on top.

To the cook in SF who puts the rice in the cupbord overnight, this is a very dangerous practice! You can contract Bacillius cereus, a bacteria which grows in rice products and starchy foods, causeing nausea, vomiting, cramps and diarrhea. The rice should be stored in the refrigerator as soon as it cools down. Not at room temp!!!!!!

Living 30 minuets from SF as I do, I went to the Palace Hotel recently and spoke to Lee Chun Dim, the resident guru of the Asian Art of food presentation. When asked how the aged one attains the chewy consistancy of his fried rice his reply was this: ..." Grasshopper, serve no rice sooner than 24 hours after steaming. ..." I now put my rice in a paper bag in my cuppboard overnight. Try it, you will be amazed at the results. Ciao.
