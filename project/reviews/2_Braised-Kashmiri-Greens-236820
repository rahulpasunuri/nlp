I really enjoy Indian cuisine and had high hopes for this dish, but it came out bitter. Followed the recipe exactly (including the asafetida), but it was, in a word, unpalatable. Maybe the addition of Mung Dal that the previous reviewer suggested saves the dish, but as is, I would never go here again.

Great, authentic recipe--asafetida is important and is easily found in your local Indian market. To add texture and protein with an extra Indian touch, add a small handful of mung dal to this dish. Boil 1/2 cup of these tiny lentils in salted water for a few minutes to soften them, then add them to the braising greens. Delicious!
