I would give this 3 1/2 forks, actually. It's a great poached pear recipe using fairly inexpensive ingredients (unlike pears poached in barolo, for example). These pears are really good served warm with vanilla or maplenut ice cream. You can also make them ahead and reheat them. One caveat: The pears took about 10-15 minutes longer than the recipe says to become soft.
