Finger-lickin' good dip! This recipe is a total keeper. In response to the complains that it separates and gets oily, there are two things that I think help: use only good-quality bottled blue cheese dressing (I use Brianna's blue cheese dressing) and don't use the full 2 cups the recipe calls for. You'll notice that regular bottled dressing comes in 12 oz bottles, which is only a cup and a half. That's plenty; more might indeed make for a greasy dip. 2) Make sure your cream cheese is at room temp when you start making the dip or it won't incorporate correctly! The cream cheese is there to thicken up the dip - leave it on your counter for at least 2 hours to get it soft enough to use. Then you'll have perfect, yummy dip and people will be sooooo impressed!

It tasted good but looked terrible. Right after putting the pecans in it became very oily. I may try it without pecans next time.

I can't count the number of times I have made this (exactly as written) and it has always been a huge hit. Served with apples and pears, it can't be beat.

This dip has become famous in my circle of friends - people just can't get enough of it! I took the advice of another reviewer and always sauté the pecans first in a little butter, sugar and salt. The dip is just so easy and perfect.

It tasted great and was nice and creamy until I put the pecans in, at which point it separated into an oily gloppy mess. I wish I had just left the pecans out. It would have gone over much better then.

I made this for a Christmas get-together, and it was a big hit! Didn't have any leftovers. Great flavors. Served it with crackers, cucumbers, carrots and grapes. Aesthetically it didn't look too great, as it was a bit lumpy. But people still loved it.

I'd give this 3.5 forks if I could. Simple, delicious, great for the blue cheese lover. I've made this 3 times since Thanksgiving!

All of my friends loved the intricacy of this dip. Although there isn't much to the recipe, this isn't just a simple dip. It tastes good with all the assorted veggies and the pecans add a nice touch.

I wasn't sure how this dip would go over (some people think bleu cheese is very strong) but everyone loved it! I served it with assorted slices of apples, pears and grapes. The flavors were perfect together! It was also a breeze to prepare so I will definitely be making it again. A nice change from the traditional veggie platter.

I've served this at countless parties and it never fails to be requested by people. The flavors are wonderful together and it's especially delicious with the grapes.

Excellent recipe. I always saute the pecans in a little butter, salt and sugar. I use LiteHouse brand of bottled blue cheese dressing. Not only is it great with vegetables but also served with crackers. Everyone asks for this recipe.

Terrific. Easy. Got rave reviews from my guests, even though I neglected to roast the pecans.

Rating: 1
I'm sorry but I have to agree with the mediocre reviews. In spite of my care in getting the right consistency and adding the pecans just before serving, the dip was not as flavorful as it should have been even though I used high quality cheese and dressing. The color was a little gray but worst of all was that it separated after serving and developed a film of oil on top.

This is very good! I put this out with Jicama slices, a perfect crunchy sweet dipper for this dip!

This dip is outstanding and got rave reviews! The toasted pecans are best when added at the last minute since they become rather soft after a while. In my opinion it doesn't keep well overnight with the pecans in it.

It's not beautiful, but it's a crowd-pleaser. Served it with apple slices, celery sticks, and whole-grain crackers.

I made this dip to go with buffalo wings featured on this site. It came out pretty good, not very strong for a blue-cheese dip though I did a few things different. First i omited the pecans, since it was for buffalo wings. Then I accidently bought fat free blue cheese dressing, and in an attempt to make it better I added some sour cream and a little dry italain dressing mix. It actually came out good and not so strong and blue-cheesy.

My guests thought this was fantastic. I added an equal amount of sun dried tomato and basil feta as well to even out the strong taste of the blue cheese. Very quick and easy dish.

It was okay. Many of the other things I made for the party were bigger hits. Maybe they just overshadowed this dip. Maybe I didn't place it in a prominent enough spot. Guests aside, I personally wasn't too anxious to consume it because the fat grams must be out of this world, with blue cheese, cream cheese, and pecans all combined. Scary!

The recipe was a hit! I served the dip with an accompaniment of fruits (grapes and green apples) and veggies...I think the comments regarding the appearance are kinda funny. Perhaps try not beating the blue cheese chunks to hard, fold the cheese in. Also, roughly chop the pecans so it doesn't create small grain-like bits, thus reducing colour disdain.

I do like this recipe Very Much, but there is no way to fix the "grey" problem. Guests at party really enjoyed it too... (I have also made the Blue Cheese with Green Peppercorns recipe on this site and that was terrible in comparison)

Did anyone else have an aesthetic problem? If so, how did they solve it?

This dip was tasty simply because it was made of blue cheese, but I would move on to other blue cheese dip recipes or try experimenting. It was very very rich. Maybe yogurt would be better instead of cream cheese. Party guests really liked it, though.

I was having people over and needed something yummy and easy, so I seized on this recipe. I was very pleased with the end result, as were my guests--served with baby carrots, cucumbers, celery, green grapes, and apples. Will definitely make again.

Made this for an office party. It tasted o.k. but it was an aesthetic disaster. The brown from the pecans bleed into the dip and the little lumps of blue cheese were just a sittin' there... Had two people ask me what the stuff that looked like oatmeal was. Might try it again if there's an occasion where I'll be serving in the dark.

Great dip (actually more of a spread like others mention) that went well with sliced pears, carrot slices and crostini.

When I beat the dressing into the cream cheese, my dressing separated leaving a globby oily blob. It tasted good but I couldn't serve it like that so I tossed it down the sink and made a different dip. I'll probably try a different blue cheese dip before I attempt this one again.

This recipe was so simple, and ended up being very tasty! Following the suggestions of other reviewers, I actually loaded up veggies and arranged them on a tray instead of serving this in "dip" form - everyone else was right: it was just way too thick. I took Fuji apple slices and 2" cucumber chunks and hollowed out with a melon-baller, then mounded the dip inside. I also served the dip on celery and hollowed-out carrot sticks, then garnished everything with rosemary. Quick and easy appetizer that I will definitely make again.

This was delicious! I had alot of requests for the recipe. I think next time I have an informal party I will fill celery "boats" with it. The celery is refreshing paired with the richness of the dip.

The flavor of this was delicious but the consistency resembled a spread more than a dip. This may have happened because I used lite blue cheese dressing and accidently only bought 8ozs of it. So I added some fat free cottage cheese to the dip but I think that's what changed the consistency. Oh well- it received a ton of compliments and was at least a tiny bit less fattening.

I made this for my book club a few nights ago, and we were obsessed with it. It was delicious and such a crowd-pleaser! I used walnuts instead of pecans and did not use any fruits as dippers. I can't wait to make it again! YUM!

I thought this was a great dip and got similar raves when I made it for Father's Day. I agree with the previous reviewer, though, that you need to cut the recipe in half. I still had plenty of leftovers when I did.

For me, there wasn't enough blue cheese taste and it was a bit too heavy overall. Other people at our party seemed to like it, though.

Excellent dip. I made it a couple of days in advance of my July 4th party and the flavors blended beautifully. I can't imagine why a blue cheese lover wouldn't like this recipe. The brand of blue cheese dressing definitely makes a difference.

I made this one last minute and didn't have time to prepare the vegetables so I served it with fresh sour dough bread cubes. It makes an excellent chip dip for casual parties (perhaps omit the nuts in this case). Very tasty.
