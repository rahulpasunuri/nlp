This was wonderful. I left the chilis in until the very end and it gave the soup quite a wonderful kick. Everyone LOVED it and came flooding back for more. Feta cheese added a great flavor.All tortilla soups are different, but as the owner of an upscale cafe, this one is definitely a keeper.

Wow, insipid chicken broth. I followed the directions exactly and was exceptionally underwhelmed by the outcome. Not at all like the torilla soup that I know and love from various restaurants!

Excellent! I wouldn't change a thing!

The broth is reducing, the chicken is shredded and I can't wait to finish this off. Do not skip the lime juice and cilantro.

This is an absolutely wonderful soup. I did use a heavy hand with the lime, however.

Very similar to one I make. I use new mexico chili powder on the chicken. We put the other ingredients in bowls so everyone can pick and choose which ones and amounts. We also use black beans. Lime wedges are a nice addition too.

Made this over the weekend-- took the better part of a Sunday, but was an impressive turn out. The broth is beautiful (definitely leave the chiles in), though I think next time I'll make it ahead, and heat cumin and chile powder in the pot before adding the broth to reheat before actually serving it. It was missing that kick that I'm used to, being from Texas originally. Also, feta adds a nice punch to the final affair (if a deviance from the true queso fresco origins) and I highly recommend that you do not skimp on any of the end ingredients-- double the corn, and use a heavy hand for the avocado, tomatoes, and tortilla strips (which you can make by brushing with oil and baking if you don't want to fry them)when you bowl the soup. Have extra lime at the ready, and enjoy!
