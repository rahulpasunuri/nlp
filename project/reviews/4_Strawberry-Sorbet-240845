Very good, used Grand Marnier instead of orange juice.

with a little bit of lemon juice, it makes it not too sweet. We don't have an ice cream machine, but froze it overnight and it was delicious

Great basic recipe. I used only 1/2 cup of simple sugar. If the fruit's good and ripe you really don't need that much. It tasted perfect. Also used this recipe's quantities for a peach sorbet- sub'd cointreau for the OJ. Yummy.

Great recipe. Followed to a T and everything worked out nicely. I didn't even have to freeze after using the icecream freezer. TASTED GREAT. Great recipe to do on a date!
