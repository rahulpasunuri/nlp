These were ok. The cookie part was too cakey for my taste. I used boxed brownie mix to save a little time. *IF* I were to try these again, I would use a different cookie recipe.

These are great... I too bake the brownie batter while I'm mixing the cookie dough. Just a tip- before putting the dough on top of the brownies, flatten it in your hand (like a pancake) and then kind of piece it together over the brownie batter. I found that it doesn't "spread" that easily.

Excellent. Best brownies I've ever made.

I followed the suggestions from SadiesKitchen and these bars were perfect -- a huge hit with my teenagers and their friends.

A real crowd pleaser.Delicious.Thanks for caution on the cooking time. I lowered oven to 325 and started checking at 45 mn.They were ready in 50-55mn. and could not have stayed in any longer without burning. I used the choc. chip cookie recipe given here, and the brownie recipe for Candy Bar Topped Brownies--on this site, Bon Appetit--sans the candy bars for this purpose.It is a delicious brownie recipe that I often use (an "adult" brownie--not too sweet, and with a hint of espresso). The first time I made these I put the choc. chip cookie layer on the bottom b/c I thought it would be too heavy on top. That worked fine, but I discovered it also works fine to follow the recipe and put brownie layer on the bottom. I think the choc. chip cookie recipe is lighter, airier than some I've made. Any way you layer it, a great recipe!

My family really liked these. The comments re cooking time were very helpful. I started the brownie layer baking as I mixed the cookie layer and then added the cookie layer, turned the oven down to 325 and cooked for about 35 mins (check it often, though) and it came out perfectly. I followed the cookie recipe but used brownie mix, btw.

These were delicious! I added in caramel and chocolate swirl chips to the cookie dough batter which made it even more delectable. I only cooked it for an hour and it came out perfect. Everyone loved them!

Okay, four forks, just for the idea! I used Trader Joe's brownie mix, and also their refrigerated chocolate chip cookie dough. The refrigerated dough would have been too heavy to put on top, so I put it on the bottom, topped with the brownie dough and then sprinked with nuts. Crazy good.

I spent my morning making this, making sure to follow all the little directions and not finding the chocolate chip cookie dough very good. And Like some forboding thing it wasn't. No, it burned. I got annoyed and finally after an hour and 5 minutes and the brownies still goey and the cookie dough burning I finally covered the thing in metal foil and the oven up. One side burned but they taste all right. Next time I am gonna half bake the brownies smear my own recepie of chocolate chip cookie dough on it and try that. Beware!!!!!!!

I love this recipe! It is easy to make and everyone enjoys the bars! I only bake them for minutes though, that is usually enough. You can also cheat by using brownie mix.

the brownie part was very good (I added some mini hershey's kisses to the batter) but the cookie part browned a bit too much for my taste to get it to the point where the brownies were cooked enough. Next time I'll just try the brownie recipe by itself or else try some store-bought chocolate chip cookie dough for the top layer and see how that works.

I just want to echo the caution on the cooking time. I didn't read the comment before I followed the recipe (I mean, who expects Gourmet Magazine to have the cooking time to be so far off the mark?) But 1 1/4 hours was WAY TOO MUCH. They were burned in parts. I'd start checking at 45 minutes. A little more effort than usual, with the separate bowls and all, but they probably are very good when they're cooked right!

Years ago I made bars like these frequently, but all I did was spread ready-made chocolate chip dough out in a pan, bake it partially, then spread brownie batter on top and baked 'till done. Try it - its a lot less work and they taste great! Going to the trouble of making homemade batter is better reserved for when each recipe is enjoyed on its own, in my humble opinion....

Look at the link at the top of the recipe for the brownie recipe.

Well based on the way the recipe looks on my computer, I could make the chocolate chip cookie part, but where's the recipe for the brownies.

Cookies and brownies together in one bar - what could be more delicious! Everybody raved when I brought them to a dinner party and served them with ice cream. I noticed the cookie top getting darker after about 30 mins so I turned the oven down to 325 and found that it was ready after baking for an hour. The 1 1/4 hrs stated in the recipe would have been too long so keep an eye on it. Some people in my family don't like nuts, so after putting the brownie batter in the pan I just sprinkled the nuts on half of the pan before putting the cookie batter on top. I tried to speed things up by measuring the ingredients for both recipes at the same time but it got too confusing remembering which bowl was which! Great recipe, will definitely make it again - makes a lot of bars (48).

Just about the best of both worlds. Only wish there was a way to incorporate the crunchiness of drop cookies into these bar cookies. I call them "chocolate chip brownie bars" vs. dream bars. They come out tall (yields a lot), so the second time, I made 1/2 the recipe and used an 8"x8" pan.
