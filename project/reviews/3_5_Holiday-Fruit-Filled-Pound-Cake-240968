A very nice dish for the holiday season. Im sure my kids will love this. You may also try this site out guys! Have found some interesting collection of recipes here at www.gourmetrecipe.com

Exceptionally beautiful and delicious lighter version than typical fruitcakes. I baked mine only 47 minutes and my cake was definitely not underdone and very moist! Can't figure out how the originator of the recipe got 1 1/2 hours for the cooking time. Try the recipe again and just keep a close eye on the cake. It's worth it.

A bit dry but very good. A splash of coffee on it on the plate took care of the dry problem.

Made this for Christmas, exactly as written (except doubled the recipe and used two non-springform pans) for both sets of inlaws and it was very very popular. I can't imagine what might have made it come out dry, as ours were very moist--perhaps your oven runs hot? I baked them for a bit less time than the recipe stated as they looked and smelled and tested done rather earlier. Superb festive cakes. The glaze was especially lovely. Make sure to include all the liquid with the fruit when you ad dit to the batter--the nice fruity cognac adds a lot to the cake.

I found this cake wonderful in flavor, but dry as described by another reviewer. What can we do??

The flavor was excellent, but this cake turned out dry for my family's preferences. I've double-checked the recipe and methods to ensure that I made no mistakes. I'm going to play around with this recipe and see if I can figure out how to make it more moist. Anyone else have this result or have an idea to enlighten me?

This cake is quite good. It was definitely done after an hour and fifteen minutes. I should have checked at the one hour mark as the cake is somewhat dark (and I did bake it at 325 as directed).

Made this yesterday but soaked fruits in tea instead, and used fresh orange juice in glaze and cake came out great- full of flavor! I will definately be making this again!

I've now added this cake to my 'favorites' file. It was beautiful and flavorful, and a big hit at a holiday party I hosted. I did make one change: I soaked the fruit overnight, which made it extra boozy, in my opinion--not a problem for me or my guests! I would like to figure out how to make it *slightly* less dense--more flour, perhaps?

I made a gluten free/dairy free version of this cake that was delicious. I can't imagine how awesome it is made with butter.

This is a wonderful fruited pound cake. I didn't have apricots so I substituted with dark raisins and it is delicious.

Best fruit cake ever. I did not change a thing, even my picky husband loved it
