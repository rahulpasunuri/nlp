Loved how easy it was to make --- and quick! Had it with whipped cream but ice cream really is the way to go. Was worried about using frozen berries but it worked out fine.

This was delicious. A few minor modifications - did add a tablespoon of cornstarch to the cooked blueberry mix, reduced sugar in topping a bit and supplemented fresh blueberries on hand with 2.5 cups of frozen blues. A definite keeper and repeater!

Love this recipe! Just an immediately satisfying country-style dessert (or breakfast - wink). Also, a snap to throw together. You don't need as many boxes of blueberries as it calls for, though; I'd say 4 of the big-size containers carried by most supermarkets is plenty. If you have time, make fresh whipped cream to top it off: heavy cream with a little bit of vanilla, brown sugar and honey and you're all set!

i have made this so many times and it is fabulous. I think some of the bottom reviews have either messed up the recipe, hate blueberries, or posted a bogus comment.

Make sure to give it time to cool and become thicker before transporting it. I took it out of the oven, put it in my car and drove to a party--not realizing that the juices were like soup at first. It made a mess (but was delicious).

This recipe is exceptionally good so I don't know what the problem is with the person (or people) in NM. I have made this several times and this year I am substituting 1/2 of the blueberries for strawberries. Hopefully, it will look (and taste) festive for a 4th of July party. Other than that, I say make it exactly as is and if you don't like it then, by all means, say so but don't give a negative review multiple times for the same recipe. We get your point. You're unfairly influencing the rating.

Simple to make, and delicious. I used almond meal right from the bag rather than grinding nuts, which made it quick and easy and so good! Like others, I put in a couple of teaspoons of cornstarch to thicken it a bit, and I think the consistency was just right - soft but not soupy.

This was an excellent recipe, I reduced the sugar because I don't like blueberries really sweet. Otherwise, it was perfect!

This recipe is outstanding. It has a complexity and depth of flavor unmatched in most fruit desserts. I have made it for company twice, and crossed my fingers that there would be leftovers but the serving dish was scraped clean each time.

This is a delicious recipe. I can't imagine why the most recent reviewers thought it was yucky. A delicious streudel on top of fresh blueberries (I've used frozen, just as good), who can go wrong? I've brought this to potlucks and brought home a pan that was licked clean. No, not by the dog, stop that, you! ;-) The only time I messed up was once when I forgot to add sugar. Der!

i took one bite and pretty much spit it out, i was just horrible, to taste. runny and sweet, disgusting. I will never make this again

This recipe is much too thick, if you like things which you can eat one bite of then make this recipe, otherwise i would choose again. We made this fresh and it took a lot of ingredients, it was fun to make, but nobody could eat more than half a piece. A real waste of ingredients!

We make this recipe many times during blueberry season and we absolutely love it. Guests love it too, and it's so easy. Great with vanilla ice cream! We use pecans instead of walnuts. We highly recommend this recipe.

Needed to use a lot of fresh blueberries the I had on hand. This dish was not only an easy solution, but it was delicious. Substituted pecans for walnuts and served with vanilla ice cream. Did not turn out runny as some reviewers noted. Will definitely make this one again!

Very nice. Added a dusting of cornstarch, and the fruit base was moist, but not runny.

I agree with the cook from Arizona. This crisp is much too sweet, and the texture is very runny. Next time, I would add cornstarch and omit the sugar from the mixture.

Have made this a few times, always with the same comment from my guests: "This is SOOOOO good!!!" Had fun serving it on 4th of July as part of a dessert selection of Red Velvet Cake, Blueberry Crisp and Haagen Daz vanilla ice cream.

The one dissenting opinion: I thought the berry mixture was runny and the topping a little too sweet. Better crisp recipes on this site.

This is what I would call a 4 fork recipe. I served it in a stemmed Margarita glass with a small square of angel food cake, a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a spoonful of warm crisp over all. Elegant, delicious and thoroughly enjoyed.

Well! This was way good! I combined the method for the No-bake fruit pie (on this site) with this. Friendly recipe. I added corn starch with orange juice. It was what I had. Less sugar is good in our household. Slivered almonds with almond extract added to sauce. Easy-quick-good--what more can one ask? Oh! And no left overs!

This dish was very simple to make and the results were very good. I added a tablespoon of tapioca starch to the blueberries to give the final product a bit of smoothness. I personally don't like runny crisps. The topping was great!

Awesome recipe! Used my wild blueberries which I froze - so used them frozen with no problem. I baked it a day ahead and put it in the oven to warm before serving. Not too runny - the syrup I drizzled over vanilla ice cream (which I served with this disk). Only used approx. 7 cups of blueberries as I cringed adding cup after cup of my $$ blueberries. Did not bubble over the dish while baking. Very easy recipe.

A good and easy way to use fresh blueberries in season. Some cooks suggested that it was a little runny, so I added a tablespoon or 2 of corn- starch, and it came out perfectly. As it can run over the baking dish, it's a good idea to place on a cookie sheet lined with foil to catch the drippings.

This was delicious and a huge hit. As with the previous cook I also used frozen berries. I did substitute oatmeal for the walnuts this time as not all my guests liked nuts. Vanilla ice cream is a must. I will definitly make this again.

This was easy to make, and results were delicious! I used frozen berries, and no one guessed that I didn't use fresh ones. I did use an 11 x 7 dish rather than a 9 x 13, and it was perfect. I even used the heated leftovers two days later for other dinner guests, and it was just as good. Served it with vanilla ice cream, and it was perfect.

This was easy enough for my 14 year old daughter to make for us. The nuts made the crisp even more delicious. We ate it over vanilla ice cream, the perfect complement. It was just as delicious and crunchy after two days in the refrigerator, and we ate every bit! This is a keeper.

Delicious and would definitely make it again! However, next time, will double the topping to ensure good "coverage" over whole crisp. Skipped the step of simmering 2 cups berries with sugar...instead just sprinkled evenly over berries in baking pan and mixed gently, with no ill effects. Served with vanilla bean ice cream and all 10 guests loved it. So easy!

This recipe is so delicious and easy. I followed someone else's advice and used only a stick of butter. I also used a combination of chopped almonds and pecans only because I had them on hand and didn't have time to chop walnuts. I served it with vanilla bean ice cream. SOOOOOO GOOD!

Made this for Mother's Day; it was a big hit. It is messy, but even so it makes a very nice presentation. I made a glaze with powdered sugar, water and a little vanilla extract and drizzled that on top of the struesel. I used half frozen and half fresh blueberries. Served with whipped cream, but I think ice cream would be better.

This was a great, easy way to turn good blueberries into dessert. I substituted quick oats for the walnuts, and it turned out very well.

This was extremely simplistic (made it with my 6 year old nephew)and was SUPER. I served it for breakfast with a bit of whipped cream ~ perfect start to the day. And, the family finished it for dessert that evening!

YUMMMMYYY! The topping to this wonderful, summertime dessert was too delicious, and really complimented the blueberries. I didn't use quite all of the butter suggested in the recipe...and it was still too scrumptious! Thanks Epicurious!

I made this for a work lunch function. Everyone loved it! I even used frozen blueberries and cut the sugar to 1/2 cup. Everyone wanted the recipe! Will definately make again!

My family really liked this over vanilla ice cream. The berries were a bit tart and I'll next time use a cup of sugar rather than just 3/4 cup.

This is an absolutely superb recipe! I made it twice within one week! I have quite a few blueberry bushes which produce a lot of berries. It is a great way to use a large quantity of them.

Excellent reaction from the guests - and very little left over. Served it with ice cream and although it was a little runny not overly so and I'd definitely make this again.

Too runny. Use Fannie Farmer(fruit crisp, p 712) for a better recipe.

I made this recipe without the nuts and it was really good. My family loved it expecially my son. It does get liquidy on the bottom but you can drizzle it on top of the vanilla ice-cream. It also serves alot of people.

My husband would riot if I served any crisp without ice cream, so I served the blueberry crisp warm with vanilla ice cream. It was delicious.
