This recipe is a keeper! I used a variety of apples, and cut the sugar by one-half. Delicious!

First time making homemade applesauce. I did end up changing some ingredients, but will be making this more often for sure.

I substituted Ginger Gold apples instead of Granny Smith - but followed everything else exactly. The ginger & lemon definitely cut the sweetness - fantastic!

The lemon juice gives a wonder tang to this apple sauce. I made it with pears and it was delicious!

I forgot to buy lemons for this recipe, so I used orange juice instead. I thought that might be pretty risky, but it turned out great! It really adds a sweet but not overwhelming flavor. The ginger was definitely a nice touch too, I don't think I'd change a thing.

Delicious! I used Jonamac apples instead, and whole allspice instead of cloves (I guess I didn't really follow the recipe, come to thing of it!) and it was DELICIOUS! Probably the best applesauce I have ever tasted. The ginger is very light and just gives it a little bite. Absolutely fantastic. Takes a while, but very easy. I will definitely make this again next time I find myself drowning in apples.

This was a nice applesauce. The ginger flavor was very delicate. I was afraid it would be overwhelming and it was just right. Great accompaniment to the pork chops. I put the leftover applesauce on oatmeal for breakfast.

This would have been delicious with another, sweeter, apple. I liked the overall taste but the apples were too tart. Next time I try Gala apples!

I guess I expected something more special from homemade applesauce. It tasted just like prepared applesauce, only a lot more work. The ginger gave it a delicate fragrance, but it would be much simpler to add a little powdered ginger to store-bought sauce for the same result.
