Based on the other reviews, I doubled the amounts for the allspice, nutmeg, dry mustard and cloves and they were a hit! I'd definitely make these again.

Don't over bake! The first out of the oven were cooked too long and got very HARD. The rest I cooked 8 min and took them out, they were perfect! So good I made another batch right away. I don't like to roll out cookies so I made these into logs, wrapped them in waxed paper, put them in in the fridge over night and then sliced them. Couldn't be easier. This recipe is going into my recipe box as a new favorite cookie. My grandchildren, who think it's not a cookie if it doesn't have chocolate in or on it, loved them. We docorated them with sugar cookie icing and they had a ball.

I have made 5 batches of these cookies. we tryed 2 other recipies but like thses best for making with the kids. They do not have as much spice as you would expect but I added more of all the spices to fix that. they roll out easily and bake beautifully. Our ginger bread house is quite sturdy this year and my daughters preschool classes was thrilled with the cookies we brought in. We pass them out to the neighbors next week! simple and tasty is how I would label this recipe

I thought these were great. The spice flavor was a bit milder than I expected, but still very nice. Could easily add more spice if you prefer. I found the dough easy to work with, by rolling between 2 sheets of wax paper and freezing the rolled-out dough for a few minutes before cutting. Finished with a quick coat of decorator icing and I thought they were great. My bf, the cookie monster, has been eating these faster than all the other xmas cookies I made. Will definitely make these again - maybe another batch tonight!

This recipie was not great. Dough difficult to work with (too stiff if cold, sticks to wax paper when a little warmer) and for all the extra effort, not as tasty as touted in the recipe.

These cookies were tasteless despite the vast variety of spices. I followed the recipe exactly. Also spent hours icing and decoratng to add some flavour. Not much improvement and a lot of time wasted. I am known as a very good baker, so don't think it was me.

This cookie dough rolls out beautifully, bakes perfectly and tastes fantastic! It's the best spice cookie recipe I've ever used.
