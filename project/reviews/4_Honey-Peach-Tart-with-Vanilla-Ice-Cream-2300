Loved this recipe. The honey makes for a warmer flavor with peaches than a typical peach pie. Honey leaked a bit from the free-form crust so foil underneath saved the oven :)

scrumptious way to use in season peaches or nectarines. Pretty, too. I followed the recipe pretty exactly and it worked out as promised. Next time I will make a little more crust; otherwise be careful not to use too many peaches or you won't have room to fold the crust up around the edges; it fit fewer peach slices than I expected. As for the fact that the crust is fragile, that is true, but my mother always said if a pastry dough holds together too easily, it's going to be tough. And this one is tender and tasty.

Absolutely exquisite -- brings out the full peach flavor and the crust is delicious. The pastry dough is delicate, but I followed the advice of one reviewer and put it in freezer for 20-30 minutes. Then I rolled it out on baking paper, not a breadboard, sprinkled a small amount of flour over it, and used a cloth over my roller. All of this made the dough easy to manage. I highly recommend this recipe!

When peaches are at their peak, this tart should be on the roster! It's so easy and the crust is SO forgiving!

I've made this several of times, because I like it -- it's simple and tasty. But, I feel that the recipe needs some serious tweaking. The crust is so delicate, it breaks at the edges during baking, the honey leaches out and burns a ring around the edge of the crust. I'm wondering whether I should add the honey in the last 10 minutes of baking, or reduce the oven temp or time or stick the tart back in the refrigerator to firm it up before baking or trying a contained pan. I see one reviewer mentions that the baking time is too long, has anyone else perfected this pretty good recipe?

My husband planted a peach tree this year. I picked several peaches and wanted something really easy to make. This was it! I admit, I used a prepared Pillsbury pie crust instead of making the pastry crust, but followed the filling directions (and added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon to the last tbls of sugar). It was delicious. I will definitely make this again.

This was delicious and didn't last long in the household! It had just the right amount of sweetness. I substituted another Bon Appetit crust (Free-Form Country Apple Tart/March 1989) because this peach recipe mentioned how delicate the crust was. But the suggestion to slide a tart bottom under the crust while baking was a good one.

I wait to buy peaches until the peaches from Colorado arrive. I buy a whole crate and then rush home to make this recipe. It is easy; it is quick; it is delicious. The crust tastes fabulous (I use the recipe for many other tarts too), and the peaches shine in this tart.

This is so easy my dog could make it. I put the dough in the freezer for 20 min and it was fine. It took about 45 min to make all together and that is including doing the dishes. I did add cinnamon and nutmeg to the sugar and flout mixture and vanilla in with the peaches.

Excellent! The crust is tricky but very very good... only baked for 25 min. Next time I'm going to try just putting it in a tart pan rather than free-form.

This tart is fabulous. Very fresh-tasting -- totally summer. It has become a staple of our outdoor dinner partied

This tart is a winner. A little different from ordinary peach pie. A word of caution: when baking, check the tart starting at 20 minutes.The given bake time is too long. Even with the burned outer crust, my overnight guests polished off the leftovers for breakfast.
