I love the bitterness of radicchio, which was nicely softened by the sweetness of the eggplant. I roasted them since I don't have a grill.

I'm puzzled by the poor reviews. I made this recipe as is, and I and my guests loved it. Perhaps some raddichio is more bitter than other raddichio, but I thought it lent just the right contrast to the creamy goat cheese and eggplant. Give it a try if you like eggplant.

I also thought the radicchio was too bitter but I may just not like radicchio. Overall, I liked this but think it might be more complicated than it needs to be. I'm not sure, for instance, that 1T of thyme can really be tasted against all that basil and other flavors. DH loved it so I'll probably make it again minus the radicchio.

I had high hopes for this recipe, but the radicchio turned extremely bitter during the cooking process rendering the dish inedible. Thank goodness for the pizza man.

I can't really rate this recipe because I didn't make it exaclty as written. I couldn't find radicchio at the market, so I put some baby arugula in at the end witht the cheese. Also, I didn't have time to salt the eggplant. I thought because the eggplant was so fresh (just purchased that morning at the farmer's market) that it wouldn't need salting. I think this is one of those recipes that needs to be followed exaclty or it just dosn't taste fabulous. Tonight's pasta was fine. Everyone liked it and ate it, but it wasn't incredible.

We really enjoyed the flavors of the goat cheese, eggplant and the radicchio. Will make again, only half, for 2! We're hopping the leftovers are as good as the original.
