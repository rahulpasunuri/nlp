Very, very tasty and savory! I didn't have anchovies, so I substituted a tablespoon of anchovy-based Thai fish sauce (after looking up substitutions) along with a little bit of the caper brine--very good! It was a little gooey for my tastes, and I had a LOT leftover, but the taste makes up for it! It went very well with the zucchini latkes from this site, along with some Greek-inspired chicken.

Excellent savory relish with strong Mediterranean personality. Eggplant may need 30 minutes and I suggest removing seeds.
