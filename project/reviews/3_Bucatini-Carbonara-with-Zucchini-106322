Very good recipe. I used center cut bacon and 2% milk instead of cream. I thought that the sauce was perfect in ratio to pasta.

This recipe was a huge hit at my house! I served it as a main dish and we have to have our protein though so I topped this dish with sliced, grilled chicken breast. I also added a little more of the red pepper flakes for an extra boost of heat..... Excellent!!

I bought some nice smoky bacon from the butcher, and added an extra dash of parmesan. This pasta was aromatic and creamy, and the zucchini cut the richness perfectly. yum.

Very good. Simplified things by sauteeing pancetta and removing it, then sauteeing zucchini in same pan and removing it. Cooked cream sauce and added everything to the one saute pan. Also sliced zucchini in strips instead of rounds. We thought it was delicious and very easy to make.

Simple dish yet has a nice flavor. My wife can't get enough of this. I usually add a little extra cream and cheese.

This was delicious and very similar to the carbonara dishes you will find in Rome. I did not double the sauce as some did but added more zucchini and sliced it very thin.

I made this with prosciutto to give it a more authentic Italian flavor. This is a great meatless dinner because it's really quite a hearty dish. I made it as a side to chicken and it was really just too much. I was surprised that some people thought it needed more sauce - I think more sauce would definitely have been overkill!...there was enough to coat and flavor the pasta without making it too creamy and heavy. I liked this dish a lot and may try it with orzo for a change.

2.5 forks: it was good, but needed twice the amount of cream. Prosciutto and 2 T olive oil (prosciutto does have as much fat as bacon), is a nice substitute for pancetta or bacon.

I made this for my husband, and he raved about it - told me it was a keeper! I doubled the sauce, and used whole wheat pasta, as well as extra pancetta (about 50% more), and cheese (I'm a cheese-a-holic at heart).

I made this recipe thinking it would be a slight variation of the regular carbonara. I have to say I was disappointed. It wasn't the 'carbonara' consistency (rich), it was quite egg-y and I thought the flavor was a bit flat.

maybe 2.5 forks. It was good, but I wouldn't go for "delicious." The reviewer who noted that the sauce-to-pasta ratio was low has a point. The good news is, that means the dish ends up being MUCH lighter than you would anticipate, from looking at the ingredients. I was feeling guilty about cooking soemthing so rich--cream, bacon/pancetta, eggs, cheese, etc--but it really doesn't make that much sauce for the quantity of pasta. I made 1/2 a recipe and it made 4-5 decent servings (as a main dish with a salad on the side). I also just used one egg in the half recipe....seemed to work out alright. Oh, and I added a splash of white wine to the cream mixture, which I think improved it. I'll make it again, but not anytime soon!

After reading such great reviews I was disappointed at how my pasta turned out. 16 oz. seemed too much and the sauce to pasta ratio was much more pasta then it should be. I didnt use all 1 1/2 lb. zucchini either and next time I would deffiantly use all 1 1/2 lb- but I dont think I'll be making this recipe again.

I made this for my husband and in-laws on a weekend trip at the beach house and I got raving reviews--definately restaurant quality. I used prosciutto (because I accidently bought the wrong thing) and yellow squash and it was great. Also, I roasted the garlic because I prefer a milder taste. This one will surely be one of my favorites!

My daughter (aged 10) adores Carbonara, and the addition of courgettes (zucchini) is inspired, though we often craft it with mushrooms...or asparagus...too. An easy version for week-nights when I'm late back from work.

My husband and I really liked this recipie. It has great flavor and is not difficult or time-consuming. If you can find pancetta, use a thick-sliced smokey bacon. Forgot the zucchini at the store but used some asparagus I had on hand which turned out great.
