PS: DON'T cover this with foil while it might be in the least bit hot. Brought this to a potluck and along the way, my beautiful dish turned to mush! Ewww! It might be a big Duh for some, but I thought I would put it out there just in case someone is as goofy as I am!

Very tasty and I will make again. I followed everything in the recipe exactly, except I used regular chicken instead of squab. Maybe some of my spices were a little old, but I didn't quite pick up on them as I would have liked (like the previous reviewer) . . . I might add an extra pinch of each next time. Also suggest saving some almonds to put on top with sugar and cinnamon :)

I'd never cooked or even tasted "b'stilla" before, but I decided it sounded great for a main dish at a dinner party. As I got into it, the process seemed excessively labor-intensive and time-consumin. In the end, I thought it tasted a little dry and had very little flavor. I followed the recipe exactly, so I can only assume that it's just not a boldly flavored dish. Not bad, mind you, but not earth-shattering. The guests seemed to like it, though; they cleaned their plates.

This is a very authentic version of b'stilla and a delicious recipe for dinner parties - I made this and also served a lamb tagine with quince and couscous. You can substitute chicken for squab, if it difficult to find and I have done this quite successfully - but squab is gamier and richer.
