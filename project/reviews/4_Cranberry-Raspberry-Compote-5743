Made this as written to go with the cheesecake. I tripled the recipe, because I sieved it to remove seeds and that reduced the volume. Very good flavor, though more cranberry-ish than raspberry-ish. This is essentially the way I make cranberry sauce anyway, though not with the sieving. You could probably skip the raspberries and add a little liquid when cooking the compote.

Delicious! I served it with the vanilla panna cotta from this site. The combination of flavors was wonderful!

This compote is a great all-purpose sauce! It works wonderful as a topping for the Cranberry Swirl Cheesecake it is linked to here, but also makes a great topping for ice cream and fantastic substitute for cranberry sauce with poultry. I've been using this recipe since I first found it in Bon Appetit to try to wean my family off canned cranberry sauce.

I received a compliment on the compote. I served it at a potluck where it was eaten with store-bought angel-food cake, ice cream, and palmiers. However, when I tasted it alone beforehand, it reminded me of cough drops. I may give it another try some day since I love both cranberries and raspberries and it was easy to make.

Marvelous! This is excellent as a side dish (a la cranberry sauce) also.

People making the cheesecake commented that they had to strain this to get rid of the seeds. I cooked it for at least 20 minutes while waiting for my reluctant cranberries to pop. The seeds were still visible but the texture was smooth. Maybe longer cooking is the trick?

I made this for my family on Christmas eve and served it over vanilla bean ice cream. Definately one of the best desserts I have ever made! Everyone loved it. Next time I would add a sprig of mint, just for the color.

Great, without the nutmeg and with less cinnimon. Make double batch-it goes fast.

I made this originally in 1998 and am making it again this year by special request. It is a lot of work, but well worth it.

Fantastic & simple to make. The tartness blends well with sweet cheesecakes and the color adds visual interest too! Worth the effort.

I served this to 20 women for the luncheon dessert. Almost everyone asked for the recipe. It was delicious - sweet and a bit tart. Yum. Put it on a store baked cheesecake and you have a fast and delicious dessert.
