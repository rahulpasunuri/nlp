Well, I dunno. Mine curdled at the very end, whilst slowly adding the softened butter in. I kept beating and kept beating to no avail. If anyone has a clue what went wrong, I'd appreciate it. It was looking great and it tastes divine. :/

It was definitely very buttery. It also came out extremely dense; more like maple butter than maple buttercream (at least I remember my last buttercream frosting as having come out a bit less dense).

Wonderful variation on buttercream. A new favorite with me. I am so tired of these yahoos who obviously have had their palates dulled by years of shortening/sugar frostings rating down true buttercreams. Why don't you folks stick w/ the Crisco and leave the good stuff to those who can appreciate it?

Made this last year for the "yule log"- it was a huge hit. Due to allergies, used hazlenuts instead of walnuts. Yes, the cream is so rich- really need to do the full mixing to hit it right. Will make again this year.

It seemed that the butter flavor just overpowered the maple, and I felt like I was chowing down on a stick of butter. Yuck.
