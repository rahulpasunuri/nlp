My hubby thought it was too sweet. I didn't just love it. My three kids ate it but thought it just ok.

Sorry, but I made this tonight, and it doesn't taste anything like I thought. I followed the receipe to a T, with the following exception-couldn't find straight Bonito Flakes, but found a jar of Hon-Dashi Bonito Fish Soup Stock. It's granules, and the ingredients are salt, MSG, dried bonito tuna powder, sugar, lactose, etc. I used 1 1/2 tsp. This soup tastes beefy/fishy, not light like I thought it would. I had Udon Noodles in Seattle, and it was much lighter. What to do? I live in the midwest, so access to true Japanese ingredients is dodgy.

Oh my goodness! So good, and so easy! Instead of blanching the veggies, I steamed them over the dash while cooking the chicken and seafood. My devoted spouse has never had udon soup before and LOVED it. I will definitely make it again!

I needed a way to use snow peas from the garden. This is an easy, delicious, healthy dish. I made it all in the same pot.

Much quicker than it sounds and absolutely delicious. I didn't have mirin and substituted sherry and a bit of sugar.
