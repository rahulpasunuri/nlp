Don't waste your time with this one! Very disappointing. To add further insult, they also looked very unappetizing - they were almost gray in color. Stick with the garlic mashed potato recipe on this site - always delicious.

This dish was fantastic! Definitely make ahead of time because the flavor improves tremendously. The night I made it, I tasted it and was disappointed with the taste, kind of boring. The next day warmed in the oven and served and it was delicious! We at this three days in a row and every day it just got better and the porcini taste got more and more prominent.
