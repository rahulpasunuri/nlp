Easy and delicious! The first time I made the recipe I didn't have celery or almonds, so I substituted carrots and brazil nuts. The second time I followed the recipe as is, and I must say I prefered the substitutions -- they give more crunch and sweetness. The carrots and brazil nuts version was also popular with family and potluck guests.

I loosely used the variation mentioned in the reviews. A-mazing. Used left over baked chicken from earlier in the week, dried rosemary, a little extra balsamic vinegar, and the mayo/Greek yogurt recommendation.

I made the revised/updated version (see below) with some leftover chicken breasts that I roasted. I burnt the almonds so I used walnuts instead. I love the fresh taste of dill and it really shines in this salad. This was a great way to use up the leftover chicken. Next time I think I might add some grapes!

I made this as the "originator" of the recipe suggests. It was a bit flat in flavor, but ok. I did have some leftover and decided dried cherries would perk it up. EXcellent addition. really made the salad yummy.

Delicious! I was generous with the balsamic vinegar and rosemary to add a little more seasoning, and shredded the salad in the food processor to mix the ingredients better. Mmm!

As the originator of this recipe and given that it's almost 10 years old, I felt compelled to inform all that this is not the same one I use (or submitted). If you are considering making this - please adjust accordingly: leftover roasted chicken is the way to go (easy and just as good); splash freshly squeezed orange juice to moisten chicken, use 1/4 fresh dill chopped instead of rosemary, vidalia onion chopped instead of green, 1 garlic clove minced, keep celery and almonds, exclude olive oil, use combo of 1/4 c sour cream (trust me) and 1/4 c mayo - not too much salt and fresh cracked pepper to taste. This is my tried and true recipe. Hope you enjoy!

This was really nothing special. To make the flavors pop, I needed to add a considerable amount of salt, along with some extra vinegar and green onion. You could also add some other stuff, but at that point you're improvising anyway, so why bother with a recipe?

I thought this was just good.. but nothing special. I used my own homemade balsamic dressing which has dijon, shallot & thyme in it, omitted the celery, because I'm not fond of celery, and used leftover chicken that I'd roasted in rosemary, sage garlic & lemon. I thought it was boring and rather colorless both visually and taste wise.. so I did add sdd some cranberries which helped.. maybe a fresh clementine nexttime.. it's definitely worth experimenting with, but as is, I'd say it's ho hum.

Really good chicken salad, but I felt it was missing some bite. I added a teaspoon of honey and grated a TINY bit of Gouda to add some extra flavors.

Wanted to love this but the dressing was very blah. Despite using good ingredients it tasted like mostly olive oil. I did add a peeled, chopped apple and all the salad ingredients seemed to work well together. It needed lots more salt and pepper and dressing with a stronger flavor. Ate it in a bolillo last night cause I hated to waste the good ingredients but will try it over salad greens tonight with a stronger balsamic dressing. With a better/stronger dressing it has great potential.

I used good vinegar from modena and spanish x-v olive oil and my own homegrown fresh rosemary. what a total waste of chicken, time and effort and the other ingredients. I cook low sodium and low fat and this combination of flavors offends my tastes. I was happy to run it trhough the garbage disposer and my husband agreed.

Very good and simple recipe. I used Vadalia Onion instead of green onion and used left over roasted chicken. The result was excellent. I served it as filling for a panini sandwich and over feild greens and just by it's self. It was great all ways.

Used the basics of this recipe with leftover breasts and it is so very tasty. Want to share the fact that I use white balsamic more often than dark nowadays. Never knew just how much rosemary reminds me of ginger!

I was looking for a recipe to use up the leftovers from last night's chicken roasted with rosemary and herbs, and so I thought it would go really well with this recipe. I had about 4 cups of cooked cooled chicken, so I diced the meat and tossed it in half the vinaigrette recipe. I over-toasted the almonds a little, but it didn't hurt the outcome too badly. I used a really good balsamic, and increased the almonds and celery so it would be extra crunchy. I thought it was fabulous -- light, flavorful and crunchy, and perfect for my low- carbing husband -- plus it doesn't have the heavy gloppiness of a mayo-based chicken salad. Yum! I'll make this again, happily.

I made this in advance for a picnic, the taste was terrific, very light. Took the tip from others and used my best balsamic. It went really well with warm bread and gruyere cheese. I think the fresh rosemary did the trick., come to think of it I didn't even have green onions.

I made this as-is and we loved it (we includes my husband who doesn't even like rosemary). It was very easy and quick, cutting up a whole rotisserie chicken was the most time-consuming part! I made it ahead and it marinated in the fridge all afternoon. I used 1/2 tsp salt and several grinds of fresh cracked pepper when making the dressing. Since it's perfect to make in advance, I plan on making this for my daughter's birthday party dinner, and let our guests choose to have it with salad greens or on croissants or multi-grain bread. I love that it is a healthy version of chicken salad too.

I can't speak to the actual recipe as it is posted, as I followed the advice of other commenters and made some changes to it, but what I came up with turned out really well. I used chicken leftover from the matzo soup I made last night, and used a red onion instead of the green onions. I omitted the celery because of my girlfriend's allergy to it, but kept the toasted almonds. I also used a white balsamic vinegar - a favorite around our house - instead of a red. I also threw in a bit of thyme and oregano along with the rosemary. I served the salad on a bed of greens, and toped it with some dry cranberries. I packed some matzo crackers along with it for a healthy Passover-friendly lunch.

Excellent! Sure loved the dressing. Almonds are good by themselves.

This was so easy to prepare! I had 2 chicken breast that I had already cubed and I didn't know what I was going to do with it. I found this recipe on here and while it was not your traditional chicken salad, I gave it a shot. What a pleasant surprise! Remember, a good quality olive oil and balsamic vinegar is the key to how it is going to taste! If you just bought your olive oil on sale at your local grocery store, then you aren't going to get good results. Spend a little extra time and money to find a good olive oil. The same goes for balsamic vinegar. I'll make this dish again not only because of it's simplicity but it was actually a pretty darn tasty dish.

It was just okay. I added extra rosemary, and had extra sauce on the side as suggested by other reviewers, but still found it bland.

I was a little disappointed in the results, and I'm not certain I would make it again. If I did, I would definitely use more dressing, more salt, and perhaps try some of the other reviewers' modifications.

We needed to double the recipe, and had some bok choi we hadn't used, and found that a cup of it thinkly sliced made a wonderful addition. We also added marjoram to the dressing, which added some depth to the flavor.

Cooked by the recipe except I used the Foster Farms mediterranean marinade chicken breasts. The picky eater in my house loved it which made me really happy. I would suggest to make alittle more dressing though.

Absolutely wonderful! I'm not paranoid about fat/calories, but I cut back when I can and I didn't miss the mayo at all. I followed the suggestion of adding fruit, which I think made the salad. I added 1/2 cup Pippin apple, as it was what I had, and it received rave reviews on our picnic! I also didn't have enough rosemary, so I added enough thyme to make up the difference. I will already be making this again next weekend for our dinner party!

Absolutely delicious! I'm not paranoid about fat/calories, but I try to cut down where I can. I didn't miss the mayo at all with this recipe. I followed the suggestion of adding fruit, which I think made the salad. I added about 1/2 cup of Pippin apple (what I had on hand) and the salad got rave reviews on our picnic! I also didn't have enough rosemary, so I made up the rest with thyme. Great combination of flavors, I will already be making this again for our dinner party this weekend!

I liked this, but I made changes after reading other reviews. I used walnuts and dried cranberries; I also added one stalk of chopped celery. For dressing, I added a tablespoon of rasperry preserves and a squeeze of lemon juice to the mixture. I also broiled the chicken instead of saute. I liked it a lot and I didn't miss having mayo.

VERY NICE BUT... I think it needs a lot of salt to make it work... more than I expected, but maybe that's true with most chicken dishes. MY ADDITIONS/SUGGESTIONS! Try butter or Peanut oil, dice the chicken while 1/2 frozen. When chilled I add dried fruit like raisins, currants, cherries, or another and a little home-made mayo and it's AMAZING!!!

I made it for a pot luck picnic last summer and a friend said that one of the main reasons he was looking forward to the picnic this year was my chicken salad! Substituting walnuts gives the salad an extra crunch so you easily forget there's no mayo in the recipe.

I made this for a luncheon. It was just so-so. I had tomake extra dessing at the last minute because there was not enough dressing to go on the extra greens I served the salad on. However, I also made the mixed green salad with dried cranberries, oranges and pecans and everyone raved. Try that one instead -- and add some chicken if you want chicken salad!

For best results, put a scoop of this chicken salad on a bed of romain lettuce and drizzle with remaining dressing. Just plain, it was just so-so, but served over greens it was very delicious and made a nice presentation. Two thumbs up!

This was delicious! I used left over chicken from a rotisserie chicken I had bought at Kroger's. I liked not having to add mayo and the extra fat and calories. I am definitely making this again.

I made this on a whim because I had all the ingredients, and it turned out so much better than I imagined. This was wonderful!! The almonds added depth, and the balsmic vinegar and olive oil were perfect. I added salt at the end, and then a few spashes of red wine vinegar to my taste. Superb!!! Will make this again!!
