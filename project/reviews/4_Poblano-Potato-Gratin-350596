Yum!! I tweaked the recipe with the following items: 1 small can of fire roasted green chiles, 2 garlic cloves (minced and sautéed), 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, 1 cup grated Gruyere cheese on top (baked for the first 30 minutes covered with tin foil, then the last 25 without tin foil to keep the cheese from burning.) Easy, simple and delicious!!!

Delicious and good for a crowd. But was a lot of work, very mild flavor and was expecting more heat from the poblanos so would adjust for that next time. Have noted another reviewer's comment about adding salt also.

I have made these potatoes three times now for dinner parties and each time they were a huge success. This last time I made it, I used whole fire roasted hatch chilis in the can - sliced them up and added to the onions. I'll have to say I really did not notice a difference when using the canned chilis. The dish does need some salt and pepper. Have been putting a layer of parmesan cheese on the top before adding the final rajas. Double the recipe and freeze one for later.

I've made this several times and its really great. I would have never thought to add poblanos to potato gratin. Most of the time this comes out relatively mild (at least to me) but the spiciness of the peppers can definitely vary. So if you are sensitive to heat, you might want to taste the rajas before mixing in the potatoes.

This was a big hit at our dinner party. I didn't add any additional ingredients. Made the rajas the night before. Cooked in convection oven at 390 for 40 minutes. Perfect. I then reheated at 350 regular over for 30 minutes. Your kitchen will smell like HEAVEN when it is baking. Everyone loved it and not a potato slice was left! I served with Guy Fieri's Gaucho Steak with 4 herb Chimichurri. Had side of green beans/verts. Perfect combination

Based on the previous reviews, I'm glad I tried it! We loved this dish and I plan to make it more often. I used Mozz and Gruyere cheeses as that is what I had available. I have never cooked with Poblano peppers before, but I loved the taste so much I'm going to make it a staple in my home. Enjoy!

It's not quite right. I made it this evening, and it was received as "nice". Unless you love the flavor of just potatos, this dish needs a direction. The poblanos cook down and lose their bite, there is no cheese, no herbs, no richness. It's a miss - though not hard to fix it. I'm Irish and potatos have to be taken seriously!

Brought a double recipe to a potluck and it was a hit! Changes I'll make in the future: I would have cut the peppers in much thinner strips so that they didn't slide off the serving spoon as easily. I did not use cream, replaced it with whole raw milk and didn't notice anything wrong with the final outcome. Also didn't use Yukon Golds, just used random baking potatoes leftover from the garden. Will make it again for sure!

Rustic, straightforward, and really, really delicious. One of the best potato dishes for a crowd.

YUMMY. Made this for a girls' evening and it was fantastic. What a delicious comfort food with a little kick. I added some red peppers that we had on hand and the sweet/spicy flavors were fantastic. Will make again soon.

This is a pretty amazing potato dish. First of all, I have 8 gallon ziplocks of hot New Mexico chiles in my freezer which I roasted down from 2 30 pound bags, so I thought this would be perfect to use some. It was. Although my chiles are quite a bit spicier than poblanos, they were perfect for the fiery taste we enjoy. The balance between the cream and spice was perfect. Please note, the ingredients leave out 2 t. of salt called for in the recipe; one to brown the onion, one to combine the potatoes with cream. Might want to add this to your recipe when copying it into whatever program you have.

Delicious. I think that I ate almost the whole thing. I wouldn't have minded a bit more poblanos, and I would consider adding a diced jalepeno. If you add cheese to this recipe, I would suggest adding it to the top, rather than mixing it in. If I make this again, I might also simmer the potatoes in the cream for a little while as opposed to turning off the heat as soon as it comes to a boil. My potatoes were not quite tender in the alloted cooking time, and by the time they got tender, the cream had broken. It still tasted awesome, though.

Fantastic exactly as is. Make it.

Very good potato dish - loved the poblano's.

We loved this, as well as our guests! I did add some fresh thyme and oregano, only stirred the potatoes and cream mixture together then layered the rajas with the potatoes in the 13 x 9" glass pan. It was a very flavorful potato dish. We all agreed that the sweetness of the caramelized onions and the fruitiness of the roasted poblanos made a great marriage with the creamy potatoes. I will be using this time and time again the way I described it and the amount of cream was perfect for setting up in 15 minutes. The cooking time was right on also, with a convection oven. Try it, you'll love it!

I followed the recipe exactly and felt it lacked depth and flavor. It definitely needs garlic and some herbs, maybe oregano, thyme? Also the cream/milk and potato step was rather awkward. I also think it needed a little more liquid. Will try again with the modifications listed. It has potential.

I forgot to mention i roasted the poblanos under the broiler instead of the stovetop - it's alot easier and you don't have to pay attention to them that much.

This was sooo good! I was thinking about adding fontina or gruyere but thought twice because it might mess up the consistency of the sauce. the dish turned out great. Next time i think I will not stir the rajas into the potatoes and put 1/2 the potatoes in the baking dish, layer the rajas, then add the remaining potatoes on top (followed by the 1/2 cup rajas). I think the onions and poblanos will get more evenly distributed that way. I think if you want to add cheese you will have to increase the liquid - but i haven't tried it yet.

I roast the potatoes in the oven till almost done and slice. I like the skins. Also, note to previous review: The roasted peppers are combined with the saute'd onions to form a "rajas" subesequently the rajas is added to the potatoes. That's where the onions are in the recipe. This dish has become a monthly side in my house. Enjoy!

They forgot to list onions in the ingredients.

I have made this several times. You can cut down the fat with light cream and skim milk or using fat free sour cream and it is still delicious.

Really good, added jack cheese to the mix. A little thick may need to thin with some milk. All said, a keeper, may play with it some more or as is makes it a winner.

Just made this for Christmas Eve dinner and it was great! Definitely use whole milk and heavy cream because the sauce was the perfect texture and creamy flavor. I agree with another reviewer on using a hotter pepper next time, but the smokiness of the grilled poblanos was a nice touch. Maybe using 3/4 poblanos and 1/4 habanero to give us red noses just like Rudolph!

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner, and it was superb. I find that poblanos vary in their heat, so I always taste them after roasting to see how much to add to a dish. On Thursday, the peppers were extraordinarily hot (for poblanos), so, given the guests I had invited, I omitted about 1/3 of them. I also used the heavy cream and unhomogenized whole milk...WOW! The sauce was silky-smooth and decadent...just what you want for a special dinner. Next time I make it though, I will cut the fat by using skim & some cream.

I just made this dish for tomorrow, Thanksgiving. It smells great. All I would say is, use a large heavy pot, a very large one or you can't even stir the potatoes in the cream, much less add the raja. I thought it needed some pepper, but I think everything needs pepper.I also ended up adding an extra 1/2 of cream so that it coated all the potatoes evenly.

I loved this dish! It was so good with the onion, but I may try to add a hotter pepper next time. Also, I will not try and toss the potatoes with the pepper an onion mixture. I had a big mess on my hands. I think layering with the potatoes will be easier. It was a beautiful looking dish too.

Loved it! I made it with the menu it was featured with in the November 08 issue. I halved the recipe, which was more than enough for 2 for dinner and lunch the next day. Would definitely make again!

I halved the recipe and used skim milk instead of milk and cream. Also I put a top in the casserole during the first twenty minutes of cooking, because I was worried it would dry out too much. I don't think this was really necessaary; I think the top would have been crispier if I hadn't covered it. The poblano peppers gave it a pleasant, mild heat.
