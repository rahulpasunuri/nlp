I use a lot of beans in my cooking. Garbonzos, black, white, pinto and red for salads, black and pintos for refried. If I ask for requests it's usually "Tuscan Beans". I usually soak the beans with a pinch of red pepper flakes, rosted garlic powder and a tiny pinch of salt to keep the beans firm and to carry the flavors. Penskys has a great ham flavored paste that I sometimes add or I use a quart of chicken stock and water to cook the beans and have used a crock pot, the oven and stove top with great results. WE REALLY LOVE THE BEANS.

It was simple to make & provides a good hearty side dish. However, I thought it was very plain. I added fresh Sage (which gave it a kick) + bouillion cube but still it was plain. Winded up adding fresh chopped cilantro over it and it was better. The soup from this dish is actually tasty but the beans itself were a little bland.

I LOVE this recipe - it is a favorite of mine and my husband! I do add a bouillion cube! (otherwise it is really a little dull!) and FRESH sage is a must! (You can dry fresh sage yourself - really easily - and it tastes great!) from a Transplanted New Yorker living in France

I make this dish often and serve it with the swiss chard tart also in the May 2000 issue. I recommend boiling the raw beans for one to two minutes then letting them stand off heat for one hour in the warm water vs soaking overnight. I use this method for all bean recipes with great results. I triple the garlic and sage and salt after cooking. Fresh beans and fresh sage are an absolute must. I add a splash of olive oil to the reheated leftovers.

Blahh! I made this dish for a dinner party and it was sooo boring! I got rave reviews for everything else (I did the grilled shrimp with rosemary from this site, excellent, and the lamb chops with lemon and thyme from the Bon Appetit 2000 cookbook, also excellent) and polites, "the beans were good" but I knew they were average. I had to add much more garlic and sage just to make the dish edible. Maybe my beans were too old (I just bought them yesterday, but who knows how long they've been stored) because they were dry and mealy, but with enough olive oil and spices they were edible. I was so disappointed! Anybody have a good bean recipe?

Nothing special. OK if you need something bland to offset other strongly flavored foods in a meal.

I thought these were kind of bland, but my vegetarian friends loved them. They recommended adding the garlic after boiling the beans instead of before. Tomatoes sounds like a great idea, too. I've been eating the leftovers for lunch the last two days, and have found that they're great with a sprinkling of romano (or parmesan) and a couple of dashes of Red Hot.

This was very good. I served it with a mixed grill of italian sausage and pork ribs in olive oil, rosemary and sage. I just added a few chopped tomatoes to the beans while they were cooking. A real hearty Tuscan meal.

I served this at my office's holiday luncheon and everyone loved it. I did modify the recipe a bit: I doubled the amounts of sage and garlic, added salt both to the bean-soaking water and the cooking water, and I added cracked peppercorns. I also stopped cooking the beans before they were totally done, so they could continue cooking in a crockpot (easier to transport to the office and easier to serve warm).

Wonderful, easy and such good flavor. I doubled the amount of fresh sage. I make this as a main dish served with salad!

I served these beans as part of a Tuscan anti pasti and they were a big hit! I made them the day before and brought them to room temperature prior to serving. The next time I will add more sage and a little more salt for my own taste, my guests liked them as they were, however!

This is a simple, easy recipe. It is not fancy, but it is delicious in its simplicity. My husband prefers it sprinkled with parmesan cheese.
