Great dish! I would never think to mix shrimp with celery and cannellini beans, but the outcome was delicious. Followed the recipe to the letter, and we polished it off.

Made this as written except used baby spinach instead of arugula. Really good, very easy, and even better the next day!

Very good. Quick, simple, light dish. Made it with raw frozen shrimp and it came out just fine. A little on the bland side, easily fixed with some extra lemon juice or garlic. I've made it twice now and all have loved it.

Used thawed, cooked shrimp drained well on a clean tea towel, and spinach (per others) & this was very bland. Sauteing raw shrimp would up the flavor profile somewhat, & using arugula would too, but I won't try this again.

I make this constantly in the summer with a few variations: add sliced radishes for color and crunch and sub the shrimp with the very high-quality Italian canned tuna. Serve with toasted baguette...delicious.

This is the third summer I've included this salad in our regular rotation. Even my celery-hating husband loves it. Excellent recipe - excellent balance. Refreshing, healthy. An all-round winner.

Delish! Though I basically used the recipe only as a starting point, used less shrimp, added/substituted some good seasonal stuff from the farmers' market (spinach, scallion, radish, cherry tomatoes). More garlic, as always, including some in the dressing. More vinaigrette in general, to compensate for more greens, and added 1 tsp chipotle pepper in adobe to it (in response to the Nyack cook's comment about smokiness - thanks!). Breadsticks on the side were perfect! We thought the shrimp heat/juices wilted the greens just the right amount.

This is such a healthy delcious meal. And so easy to make! The shrimp were fantastic. I could only get frozen cooked shrimp, but i defrosted them in warm water, and dried them off well, and went further with the recipe, and they came out great! This salad is definitely becoming a staple!

I loved this. What a great lunch. I added some parsley and a few parmesan cheese shavings. YUM!

SO GOOD! I would make the bean/celery combo the day before and let sit with the oil/lemon juice. The day of make the shrimp and toss with the beans, then add the arugula. Super simple.

Fabuloso. Can't get much easier. The flavors melded & were sensational. Even the next day the dish was superb for lunch at the office. Used mixed spring greens instead of arugula. Of course the greens get wilted. So what? Don't pass this up!

Just made this salad for dinner. Used shrimp with shells and seasoned per recipe plus a dash of creole seasoning. Also used black beans as these are what I had. Waited until the shrimp cooled almost to room temp before tossing with salad. Added a few cherry tomatoes for color. Fabulous!

Would never have thought to put these ingredients together, but we loved this dish, even the way the warm shrimp wilted the arugula. It seemed to be missing some subtle flavor though, and finally I had it -- smokiness. I added some diced Spanish chorizo and it was perfect. This dish is easy and elegant. Wonderful!

We found this incredibly boring.

This was fab. I was looking for something light, even though our heat wave has broken. This really fit the bill. It was so fresh, as well as pretty. I didn't change a thing, but did add a few cherry tomatoes, more for color than anything. If you like arugula, try this. It's a real winner.

Fast, healthy, and delicious--this recipe delivers on all three fronts. In fact, it even makes great leftovers, which I'm eating at this moment. Just be sure to store the arugula separately, as it tends to wilt in the dressing. I also love that the recipe calls for 2lbs of shrimp, which is the exact size of those big bags of frozen shrimp. I would definitely make this again, especially since my husband heartily approved!

I served the whole dish cold and it got rave reviews from everyone at the table! I would just add more vinaigrette next time.

Absolutely Fabulous. I would not have thought to put together shrimp, beans and arugula (though I used baby spinach) but it is a fabulous combo. The seasoning was perfect to me. Even my celery-averse husband gobbled it up. Even the little bit that was left over was de- lish the next day. Hint: I did let the shrimp cool before adding, and I think it made a difference.

The shrimp, beans and vinaigrette were quite good but I didn't like the way that the hot shrimp cooked the arugula in the salad. I would let the shrimp cool a few minutes, tossing them in when only slightly warm. The texture of the cooked arugula was unpleasant.

Very delicious- perfect for a hot summer's dinner. One thing? Way too much salt used, in my opinion- had to cut that back. Also: the lemon juice is great, but it also really needed to more limes squeezed over the final dish just before serving. Serve with crusty toasted bread- yum!

This was surprisingly good. Perfect for an al fresco meal on a hot summer night. We all enjoyed it.

I love the flavor combinations in this salad. It reminds me of Italy! And it took hardly any time at all. Because I only had 1 lb. of shrimp (although, jumbo), I decreased the amount of all the other ingredients except for the dressing and shrimp marinade. I used 2 celery sticks, 15 oz. can of beans, and I think I still used 3 oz. of arugula.

Really nice flavors, lemon and the beans were sublime together. I think less shrimp would be ok too. I would probably increase the amount of vinagerette next time I make it.

A fabulous recipie.........easy, quick and uncomplicated, and oh so tasty. You gotta love the author of this recipe for her brilliant pairing of just a few easily accessible ingredients ( she doesn't use the word "heirloom" anywhere.; God bless her ! ). A testament to classic simplicity. Serve at your next cook-out or bring it to a pot-luck; this dish is a hit !

Yummy. Next time I might use more arugula and less shrimp. But it was great, wonderful flavor. Easy, but it did take me more than 10 minutes. I had frozen cooked shrimp, and just sauteed the garlic alone first, then added the shrimp, oil, and s&p to warm up the shrimp (defrosted first). Worked fine. Definitely a keeper

Wow ~ this salad was fantastic and so simple to make! It was refreshing and flavorful - perfect for a mid summer night. It went beautifully with a full bodied chardonnay.

Simplicitiy is its own reward with this dish! For my tastes, though, I sprinkled a bit of Kosher salt on top to counter the arugula and also bring out the other flavors as well. A definite keeper.
