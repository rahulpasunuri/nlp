Excellen wing glaze. You can line a cookie sheet and cook wings at 400 for 30 min.instead of frying them. I sustituted hot pepper jelly for preserves and added about 1/4 c cider vinager.

I made this for my family and they loved it. They want me to make it all of the time. They are better if you coat the chicken with flour and then fry. They are even better the next day!

It's very good...but cut back on the soy sauce, I thought it was too much so I cut the amount in 1/2 and I thought it tasted great! And it does make a gracious plenty.
