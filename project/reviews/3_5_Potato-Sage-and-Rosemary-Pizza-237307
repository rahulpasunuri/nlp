Made for a Christmas party, huge hit, it was inhaled. Potatoes were just a teensy bit too oily for me, didn't really have a pan big enough for single layer as directed (it's a lotta potato rounds), might try tossing in less oil and doing potatoes first on a baking sheet. Definitely a keeper, especially with fresh rosemary and sage from the garden.

This was absolutely fabulous. I was looking for an easy recipe using sage and rosemary (from a friend's garden) and mozzarella that I had on hand. I upped the garlic a bit and added sea salt. So glad I discovered this recipe - can't wait to make it again!

Loved this recipe--folks were a little hesitant to try a pizza with potato but, it was a hit. Minor edits for next time = I might only do 1 clove of garlic. Also, didn't use whole-milk mozz-- stomach cramps from too much heavy dairy. Used a lighter cheese and still good.

This pizza is delicious! I used whole wheat pizza dough from Trader Joe's (which I always use to make pizza) on my pizza stone and it turned out great. I followed the baking instruction on the dough, and baked mine for about 9 or 10 minutes at 450F. Also, now I use a little less cheese than the recipe called for. Don't get me wrong, it's delicious with the full amount of cheese, and not overly cheesy, but I figured the strong taste of the pizza could make up for a little less cheese. I pretty much sprinkle until it looks like the ideal balance between health and deliciousness. Also, don't try to pat out all the oil from the potatoes or your pizza may be a little dry. I think a little residual olive oil adds great taste and moisture. I will definitely make this again- an easy and tasty vegetarian meal.

20 minutes was definitely too long in the oven, and i will cut way back on the garlic next time (i might be the only person alive who does not like garlic). otherwise delicious! i'm intrigued by the layer of sour cream idea....might give that a try next time as well.

This pizza was excellent and I will definitely be making it again! I used a round of pre-made pizza dough rather than the tube. I also only had dried rosemary on hand and used that. I tired to adjust the amount for it being dried rather than fresh, but I still found it a bit too strong. I would probably use a bit less rosemary next time.

Very delicious - But 20 minutes is too long for tube pizza dough. Crust burned. I would make it again & put it in the oven a shorter amount of time.

This was good, a little on the dry side though. Added some crumbled bacon with herbs and garlic. Maybe next time will add a thin layer of sour cream before the potatoes.

I made this for dinner last night. Rather than the tube pizza dough I bought the dough (fresh) at Trader Joe's. Used Rosemary from our yard so naturally that was good. Next time will add more chopped garlic. Can never have too much garlic.

This dish was a hit! I served it as an appetizer and everyone loved it. I wouldn't change any of the herbs but might add some carmelized onions next time

This was very easy and very good! I disagree with the last post, I like rosemary and thought it was great. Will definitely make again

Nice, easy dish for a party. I would cut back on the herbs next time; the rosemary especially ended up being somewhat overpowering and bitter. With that change, this is something I would gladly make again.
