This was DELICIOUS!! My husband was a huge fan of this dish and he typically doesn't like rice (or many of the healthy recipes I make). He kept commenting on how good and flavorful this was! I didn't have cumin seeds so I used ground cumin, nor did I have pecans so I substituted with walnuts. I also left out the mint. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a T and was extremely pleased!

Great salad although I made a few changes. First I used barley instead of rice, it's higher in nutrients and fiber & I think more delicious. It also cook in about the same time 35-40 mins with a 3/1 ratio. I used 1 zucchini & 1 yellow squash along with some red and orange bell peppers for added color & flavor and a 1/2 a jalapeño for spice. I used a mix of coriander & mint which was nice and added a little orange zest. Great in combo with the chipotle braised chicken.

Loved this. So fresh with the herbs and lemon! The toasted pecans add a wonderful crunch. Great doubled and used for next day lunch. Really nice!

Make sure you use all three herbs -- parsley, cilantro and mint.

The coriander seeds make this special. I also used ground cumin instead of seeds and added some kale that I had in the house. Used an entire lemon at the end, and left out the fresh herbs as I didn't have any on hand. Very tasty with the limited ingredients and quick to prepare.

This was delicious and everyone at the table raved about it. I didn't have any cumin seeds, so I used ground cumin. I also lightly toasted the rice in the oil before adding any water. I usually use a rice cooker so I was a bit hesitant about cooking stove-top rice, but my brown basmati turned out beautifully. I usually don't enjoy pecans, but I have to say they do add a lot to the dish! Not only is this a yummy dish, it's also very pretty.

Even though mine tasted like a 3... I am giving it a four because I just undercooked mine (I didn't follow instructions and let it sit uncovered... whoops...) I still tasted really good which is saying a lot! Really interesting flavors that come together nicely - and really nice texture!

I made this exactly according to the directions and it was delicious. I especially liked the pecans - do not skip these as they complement the dish.

this was really delicious. i chopped the pecans and threw them in at the end with the squash instead of toasting them separately. i used olive oil and of skinny summer sqyash. really good.

This was a really delicious rice salad. I made this along with the Chipotle Braised Chicken recipe and got rave reviews from my wife. I ended up substituting white basmati rice for brown basmati rice (which wasn't available at my supermarket), but it still came out great.
