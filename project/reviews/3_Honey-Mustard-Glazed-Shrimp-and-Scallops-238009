I didn't have vinegar, so I left it out and slightly increase the mustard and honey. I glazed the shrimp on the grill and left for a minute. This turned out great with grilled zucchini and rice!

Followed the recipe to the letter but it didn't taste zippy enough so I added 3/4 teaspoon thai chili paste + squeeze one fresh Mexican lime. Seared the seafood, stir-fry veggies, cooked asian glass noodles, and then put everything together and drizzled sauce on top. Too cold for grilling, but will try it that way next time.

It was good, b/c it was shrimp and scallops. Had to remake "glaze" b/c it was too thin. S&P skewers. Then mix 2 pt honey & 1 pt mustard & brush on. Much better. My scallops were huge & I had to cut them up to fit in the biggest shrimp I could find. I might make again sometime.

The honey/Dijon mustard dressing tasted great by itself but did not hold up once it was brushed on the shrimp and scallops. It should have been alot stronger. The result was a very bland/tasteless appetizer. Not worth the effort

Ridiculously easy and a huge crowd pleaser. Doubled the count and threaded a shrimp around a scallop on toothpicks for my boyfriend's birthday last year. Don't own a grill--just pan seared. My friends now refer to these as "sea buddies" given the way the shrimp hugs the scallop. Gone in minutes. If you think the vinegar flavor in the sauce is too strong, add more honey.

Super easy and tasty.

This was really super easy and really tasty! I will definitely make it again - it scores very high on the tastiness/time involved ratio. I think the glaze would be good on just about anything and everything

Found the vinegar to be overwhelming

I made this as part of our main course for Easter and it was such a hit. I used 2 skewers since the scallops were so large and then barbequed them, followed up by adding the glaze. They were definitely a hit with our 19 guests at Easter. Definitely a keeper!

OK, people. I made this as written -- lovely. AND THEN, I made it with hot dogs. Not hot dogs and shrimp, just hot dogs. And some skewers with andouille. And you know what? That was tasty too.

I served this recipe as an appetizer and it was excellent. I plan to prepare as an entree next time. Easy and delicious!

I followed this recipe as given, using dry scallops. I served portions of four or five as an entree for a light summer supper along with brocolli stir-fried with ginger. Very good, easy, and interesting.
