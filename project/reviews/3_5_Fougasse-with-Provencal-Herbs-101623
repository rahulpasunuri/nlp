The recipe I tried was in the November 2009 book. I made the recipe, and my bread looked exactly like the picture in the magazine. I did not like the bread at all. It is a misnomer to call such bread a baguette. It tasted more like Saltine Crackers! Yuk! (I have been cooking from Bon Appetit for more than thirty years.) Jeanne Wood,Prescott AZ

This is one of my favorite breads with or without the herbes de provence!I am making it tonight again for tomorrow's World Communion Sunday Service. Personally, since the salt kills some yeast, I double the yeast when topping with cheese, tomatoes and onions and I never use more than half the salt. It's great without it and better for you!

Oops. Forgot to say that I used a whole package of yeast as per other reviewers, so not entirely "as is." Definite keeper.

This is delicious as is, but next time I will definitely add more of the herbs and EVOO to the dough. Not the most advanced baker here, but I enjoyed making this bread. King Arthur Flour's website is a treasure (if anyone's interested)-- the ciabatta is fantastic. Check out TJ Maxx and Marshall's for great buys on really good EVOO and vinegars. It's hit or miss there, but if you see Olio Extra Vergine Di Oliva made by M. Barbera & Figli, grab it. $12.99 for $25+ quality.

This is an amazing base bread recipe. I've made it three times this week and it disappears as soon as it comes out of the oven. I add chopped sicilian and nicoise olives.

Mmmm. Perfectly crispy on the outside and nice and moist inside. Didn't have the herbes, so used approx. 3Tbsp of dried mixed Italian herbs. Also sprinkled the tops with coarse kosher salt during the second rise. We ate an entire one with butter as soon as we took them out of the oven.

This was great and I don't bake very much bread. I didn't adjust anything for 6500 ft either. I used the entire recipe for one , very showy, loaf for a buffet.

This is a great recipe. I also used more yeast (2 tsp.) and then thought my fougasses were a little puffy. Maybe next time I will use a little less but probably always more then 1 tsp. I divided the dough into 2 pieces and then divided those into 3-4 pieces and made round shapes and slit them with a knife (I was trying to copy a recipe I saw on Martha Stewart that didn't get posted to the internet). They almost look like pretzels. I didn't have the herbes so I used sea salt. Cannot wait to make with the herbes and topped with olives or capers or parm. Great dough. It would be great for pizza or calzone also. Thanks epicurious!!

One more note to my previous review - I increased yeast to 2 1/2 t. I would have to agree that the 1 t. is not adequate for this amount of flour, even for a so-called "flatbread."

I served this as an appetizer with the herbed goat cheese and tapenade from the same issue and got raves from my guests. The combinatin would be nice for late afternoon entertaining, too.

This is a GREAT recipe! Instead of using the Provencal Herbs, I used basil, rosemary and thyme (2 tsp of each) which was INCREDIBLE! I made the recipe exactly as was written with the exception of using an entire packet of yeast. I am very pleased with the result and have made this several times. It turns out fabulously every time!

This is one of my favorite bread recipes. I use it for sandwiches, serve it with soups and salads, and even use it for pizza dough. It is even good without the herbs de Provence, but so delicious with it.

Baking at 7500 ft. altitude has been a challenge, so I approached this with some caution. I used a whole package of yeast (rapid rise). My fougasses were picture perfect and tasted devine. This weekend I will add sundried tomato pieces, brush the tops with olive oil and sprinkle with the coarse sea salt. Thanks, BA

Make this in Provence and they will laugh at you... It takes much more olive oil to makes the Fougasse. It is the base of this bread almost more than the flour... Use more yeast than written, less water and more oil... You can also add small pieces of bacon instead of the herbs (Fougasse aux Grattons) or blue cheese... (Fougasse au roquefort)... Very tasty!

This is a very good recipe for a basic fougasse so typical of Provence. Alter it by adding sliced olives, sun-dried tomato, cracked black pepper, capers, or a variety of other items. One with just coarse sea salt and olive oil is also terrific! It's time fougasse became more appreciated in the U.S. Patricia Wells new cookbook from Provence also extols the virtues of fougasse. Enjoy.

I don't think the original recipe calls for enough yeast so I used a whole package of dry yeast, about 2 1/4 teaspoons. With that one change, this is a fool-proof recipe for fougasse. You can also substitute fresh rosemary (or dried) for the herbes de provence, if necessary. I've made this recipe probably six times in the past month. It's great!
