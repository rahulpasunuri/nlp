The dough was delicious. It was a shame that it was so crumbly. Nearly impossible to roll out, to cut into shapes, even after hours in the fridge. In fact, I had to put it in the oven for a while to soften up the dough, to make it maleable enough to work with. The recipe has just enough cinnamon in it, though perhaps some more walnuts would be better. Also, make sure you do chop them finely, because otherwise you may end up with pretty thick cookies. The small-hole-in-a-ziplock bag method of decorating the cookies works well. When I did it, I didn't bother cooling the chocolate for 15 minutes- just drizzled it right on and it worked beautifully. Seeing that I was going for a Christmas theme, I cut the cookies into candy cane shapes instead of crescents- sort of a black and white candy cane. However, the finished product didn't turn out as well as I had expected- good, but not exactly great.

These took a lot of time and effort for the end product. I didn't have any of the problems with the dough that others reported but when I cut out my shapes (stars instead of crescents) and baked, they didn't retain a crisp shape and ended up sort of goopy looking. I did follow all the steps of chilling the dough. The flavor of the cookie was great but it was too much effort. And drizzling the chocolate does not give you an effect at all like that in the picture--the chocolate on the photographed cookies was clearly piped on which is much prettier but again more time and effort.

I didn't find the need to chill the dough at all. I actually shaped them into crescents by hand. Maybe this is why I found them to be just OK rather than superb? They were definitely still yummy, but not a showstopper.

Flavorful crisp, buttery wafers. Absolutely a favorite and v. easy! (Rarely give 4 forks but these are over-the-top.) Sliced 1/4" disks from a chilled roll - I really dislike dough handling and this obviated that part (see SF review). No need for the 2nd chilling on sheets. Didn't have enough walnuts so also included toasted slivered almonds for a nice texture.

I made the recipe with almonds instead of walnuts, for a friend who won't eat the latter. The cookies came out very well, though I think the directions to chill the dough for so long are mistaken: I ended up having to let it soften before I could roll it out without getting cracks. Also, I think that the doush should be rolled out thicker than instructed. When they are rolled out to a 1/4" they ended up a bit like crackers.

These were light and a good with mint tea and vanilla icecream. This goes down as a favorite cookie. I used a shortcut from another shortbread recipe: Roll the dough into a log, then slice into 1/8" slices. My dough was solid enough to not need chilling before slicing and the cookies turned out perfect.

These were tasty enough, though too time-consuming for the end result. I found the dough frustrating to work with. It was rock-hard straight from the fridge; after it softened enough to be malleable, it stuck to everything, even with liberal flouring. That said, the cookies did have a wonderfully rich, buttery, nutty flavor. I won't put the effort into making them again, but I wouldn't discourage anyone else from giving them a shot.

Yummy. Be sure to chop your walnuts pretty fine. I used a star cookie cutter, then cut a smaller star out from the center of it. A very pretty presentation. I piped on white icing instead of the white choc and it tasted just fine.

Very good. I made them with whole wheat pastry flour from Whole Foods and they came out awesome, very buttery and fragile.

Quick Simple & easy to make shortbread. I only wanted to make 2 dozen so I cut the recipe in half. From chilled lump of dough to completed cookie took 60 mins tops. The cookies looked fabulous, even though in lieu of a crescent shaped cookie cutter I just used a sharp knife to cut dough into 3 inch squares, then cut the squares in half to form 1-1/2 inch triangles. I did what an earlier poster suggested, put the melted chocolate in a small ziplock, sniped a tiny "tip" off the corner with a sharp pair of scissors and squeezed it out of the makeshift pastry bag.

Delicious! The dough is kind of crumbly and hard to work with but don't give up - the cookies come out tender and buttery. I added a litte fresh grated nutmeg in addition to the cinnamon. Definitely a keeper...

I don't usually bake with nuts -- don't like 'em much -- but gave these a whirl. They remind me of shortbread. I ended up melting only 3 squares of chocolate for decorating and had leftovers. Either I needed more chocolate on the cookies or could have cut back more. A plastic bag was the way to decorate. My spoon technique was blob-like.

These cookies turned out fabulous. They were a bit of work (anytime I have to roll something out and cut it into shapes I consider it a lot of work) but they were well worth the effort. Very delicate and crisp, not too sweet. I decided to use milk chocolate instead of semisweet, and I would recommend if you want them to look as pretty as the picture that you use a makeshift pastry bag (a ziploc with a small hole cut in it) to put the chocolate on at the end.
