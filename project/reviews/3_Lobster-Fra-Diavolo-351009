Gave it four forks, but only with the changes suggested by the other reviewers. Agree with all - cooked the lobster (and shrimp) with the garlic and shallots, added the serrano peppers too and some crushed red pepper, then took the lobster and shrimp out to be added before serving. Used only meat from the lobster tails. May be okay as written if you cooked the complete lobster, but would be pretty messy to get the meat out of the lobster when it's been cooked in all the sauce.

As noted by the other reviewer, the recipe, as written, will vastly overcook lobster (or shrimp). To solve that, I cooked the shallot/garlic in oil until softened -- a couple of mintues. Then I added the wine/cognac and the shellfish. I sauted the shellfish briefly, and removed it before it was fully cooked. I returned the shellfish to the sauce at the end to finish cooking it. (Exact cooking time depends on whether you are using lobster or shrimp.) Other changes, based on personal taste: (1) reduced the flatleaf parsley from 6 tablespoons to 4, (2) increased tomato paste to 4 tablespoons and (3) increased the red pepper flakes to 3/4 teaspoon. Overall, a very tasty and relatively fast dish.

The sauce in this recipe is very good. However be careful to not over cook the lobster. We doubled this recipe for a larger family and it could have been better. Two steps contributed to the downfall of the poor yet expensive lobster, not exactly indigenous to Minnesota. Step 2 is too long. Next time I'll cook the lobster pieces in oil maybe 5 minutes. Step 3 requires a very large surface area to evaporate the liquid. Our standard pan required more time to reduce the wine, drying out the lobster. Also, use fresh oregano. The dry gets overpowered by the wonderful fresh herbs.
