I had to make this because it just sounded so unusual. It is outstanding and the olives are amazing!! A keeper!!

I always try to make something a little unusual for my holiday dinner and decided on this receipe for a dinner for 20. This was such a success and I have to agree with another reviewer that the rosemary was a find all by itself. And who would have thought fried olives would be so amazingly delicious. As one diner commented it was like little bursts of flavor in your mouth. Amazing recipe and definitely a keeper.

It's a classic greek recipe. You may not use rosemary. You squeeze one orange, pour it over the olives and let the olives "sleep" in their juice!

Very unusual salad. Perfect for entertaining. Brought to New Year's Eve party and it was a big hit. We served after the dinner, a perfect end to a meal, before desert. Had my own mini salad this afternoon, with the left over fried rosemary and olives. (I fried a little more than the recipe called for). Bought 12 oranges (6 cara and 6 blood) as the recipe called for but only used 9 for the platter. Served seven adults.

Made this for Christmas Eve dinner last night. I could not find blood oranges anywhere, so just used the Cara Cara. I used one orange, one 3" sprig of rosemary and four olives total, tossed everything together with some olive oil, salt & pepper, then served over mixed spring greens. My daughter (7) is not a big fan of vinegar-y dressings (or any dressings, now that I think of it!), so this went over well with her.

Looks incredible. I would like to make this for Christmas, but thinking of adding beets to make it a more savory starter salad to a four course meal (followed by butternut squash pasta, then roast chicken). Would love to hear opinions on pairing, adding beets, and methods for incorporating beets! Ideas?

Takes 15 minutes, and it is very good. The fried rosemary is a find all by itself. Serve over greens with lots of arugula and dark rye warmed with blue cheese.
