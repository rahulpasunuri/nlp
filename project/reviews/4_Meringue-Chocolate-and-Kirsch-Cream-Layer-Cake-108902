I read all of the reviews before making this, and opted to use 8 egg whites instead of 5, and my meringue layers were still painfully thin. Also, while the layers CONTAIN meringue, they don't look like or taste very much like meringue by the time they are done. The qty. of flour and nuts makes them very cake-y. Even with the extra 3 egg whites, my layers were nowhere near the size of the ones in the photo. The cake tasted very good, and I got a lot of compliments on it, but as written I think this recipe leaves a lot to be desired, and calling it a meringue cake is a bit generous. If I were to make it again, I'd probably triple the amount of meringue, though I honestly doubt I will.

A great Torte but I followed others advice and increased the egg whites to 8 and made 5 layers. I also increased the other ingredients accordingly. This was still not really high but served 8 with good sized portions.

I agree with others that the cake is too flat. The amount of meringue batter for each round is too skinchy, which makes it difficult to get it spread evenly and not have it burn in spots. I made all 4 layers. Got up the next morning and realized that the cake was going to be awfully low. Made another batch of meringue and this time divided it between only 3 layers instead of 4. Much, much better. The layers are still very thin, but spreading is easier and they bake more evenly. So what I would do if I were making this again, would be to DOUBLE the recipe, but make only 6 layers instead of 8. The chocolate is pretty strong. It dominates the flavor so much that I think Id try a less bitter chocolate, or maybe not so much next time. The kirsch is untasteable. Waste of money. Everyone liked the cake. But if I were to do it again, Id be making changes.

While I agree that it's not a true Schwarzwälder Torte, as just a plain old "meringue, chocolate, and kirsch cream layer cake" this was absolutely delicious. I served it for a birthday, and friends told me it was the best cake ever (and I make a mean buttercream frosting ;) plated presentation was really nifty, I thought, also. next time i will try the suggestion below and increase the recipe to make it taller. I found it surprisingly easy to make, and of course it ends up looking very complicated and impressive. per the reviewer from switzerland, I am thinking I may try adding some kirsch-soaked cherries during the construction.

per the reviewer from switzerland, I was just thinking about adding some cherries. ;) maybe juicy ones that have been soaking in Kirsch.

Made this for the first (and not the last) time today. I followed the recipe precisely for the ingredients but did follow a couple of other reviewer's suggestions. I used parchment paper instead of greasing the cookie sheets and used the side from a 8" springform pan for creating my meringues. The meringues are quite thin when poured out, I was a bit concerned, but they do puff up a bit in the oven. It is important to pour these out as evenly as possible to prevent the edges from overcooking. Once removed from the oven, I left them on the parchment on racks for a few minutes before carefully pealing them off the parchment and placing back on the racks. The meringues are soft and quite cake like (due to the nuts). My chocolate didn't take very long to cool, so check yours often to ensure that you don't let it get too thick to spread. Everything else worked exactly as written. This makes a very light, tasty dessert. On cutting out the first slice, it looked EXACTLY like the picture. We garnished with fresh raspberries; a natural match to the almonds and chocolate. I would be hesitant to add more chocolate for fear of ruining the balance of flavours, however, I'd be tempted to add 50% to the recipe overall and make 6 meringues and create a taller dessert. All in all, if I'd received this dessert in any restaurant, I'd be quite pleased with my choice. As a "home made" item, this is stellar and should impress even the fussiest eaters.

should the meringues remain soft afer cooling!? I might prefer meringues crunchier, but I will correct this next time. well, I guess it did not matter as this is an exeptional dessert, light and delicious ending of a perfect meal. adding more chocolate as suggesed by previous reviewer wont hurt it.

should the meringues remain soft after they are cooled!? well, it did not matter, the cake is perfectly light and special even for a perfect desert after a gourmet meal. next time I would prefer my meringues to be crunchier and not soft, but I will correct that. it's probably even better with a bit more chocolate as the reviewer before me suggested.

I made this cake several times and I had great succes in terms of cooking and in taste. I made the following modifications for the cooking part with great results. 1- I cook the meringues on parchmen paper. The meringues that way are cooked perfectly without burning the edges. 2- I cook them in 400 F for 6 min. 3- I use embroidery hoops (8 inches in diameter) for perfect meringue shape. 4- I use 1-2 oz. chocolate more. It is a light and a very impressive desert.

I noted in a previous comment that I would mix the nuts with the flour. That did not work well, so make this recipe according to the directions. Its great.

I am now making this for the fourth time. It is fantastic. this time I will mix the nuts and flour together to see if it enables the meringue to stay a bit more voluminous. To the person from Switzerland about the name - You might take a look at what Shakespear says about the importance of names! Try it any way and give it your own name! This cake certainly does not rate a low fork level because of the name, be fair.

I haven't tried this cake yet, but although it looks delicious it's not a Schwarzwälder Torte. Schwarzwälders are made with layers of chocolate cake sandwiched in white cream and canned cherries, drenched in kirsch, and topped with more cream and chocolate shavings. Looks much different, and probably tastes different too.

This was a fabulous cake. Not too hard to make but looks very impressive and tastes amazing. Lots of flavour but nice and light. Definitely a keeper!
