Quite good. Next time I would use a combination of apples and quince, as the flavor, tartness & grainy texture were a little intense for my taste. I halved the recipe for a 7" cast iron skillet, grated a bit of nutmeg in with the cinnamon & used regular vinegar in the pastry (I was out of cider). The pastry was a little salty at first, but was perfect when baked. I don't think the slits were a good idea - this just caused sauce to run out the bottom when plated. This would make for soggy pastry if you weren't eating right away. Next time I will not cut the slits.

This was so great! The caramel never browned for me, but I took it off when it was light caramel and added the butter, and it worked fine. The crust was delicious, and mine was done after 60 minutes.

I thought this was wonderful! I plan to use this recipe for all my tarte tatins in the future (for apple maybe corn syrup instead of honey). The caramel was not difficult for me, nor do I think the recipe was written incorrectly. I followed it exactly and the results were beautiful. I'm not sure you need 3+ pounds of quince (even pre-coring) for this. I think I only used 1 1/4-1 1/2 and it did not seem lacking. I only needed to bake mine for 50 minutes and when I used a toothpick to test the quince they were soft.

The directions are not correct. I do not have any experience with carmel so I tried to make it according to the directions, and it was a colossal failure. You have to add the butter to the sugar when you melt the sugar or it will just turn back to sugar. After the huge mess with the sugar I reverted back to my tried and true America's Test Kitchen cookbook and it turned out great!

This is a glorious recipe. Every time I make this tart, it comes out beautifully. Even though making the caramel may seem a bit daunting, it isn't. I serve mine with creme fraiche on top of it. The creamy tartness of it is the perfect foil to the sweet, pungent quinces.

Excellent and Easy to Make!! This was my first experience with both quinces and tarte tatin. I used the bottom of my ceramic tagine (which was oven and stovetop safe). The dough came together easily, and the caramel was easy to make by eyeballing the color. My quince slices were tender after an hour, not needing the extra 15 min. After cooling 30 minutes, I flipped the tagine bottom onto the prepared platter and the tatin dropped out perfectly! (I admit, I was skeptical at the success rate of this final step). Flavor, texture and presentation are all exceptional. Quince is tangy and subtly perfumed. It makes a nice, unexpected fruit dessert for fall. Highly recommended!

I agree with the previous reviewers. I'm not an experienced dessert maker but I made this for a dinner party to rave, rave reviews. It really was very easy and looked/tasted like "restaurant quality".

This is a great recipe, very easy to do - I made the crust the night before and assembled the tatin the next morning in a cast iron pan. Everyone was impressed. Careful of the juice if you are transporting on a plate.

I have been making tarte tatin's for years but this is one of the easiest methods I've tried. The tarte flipped over easily without the fruit geting stuck on the dish and it was delicious!
