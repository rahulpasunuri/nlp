This is really a recipe for financiers, not clafoutis. I reduced the butter slightly (to 3/4 cup) and it was fine, although more butter would've been even better, I'm sure. I greased the ramekins, which I think was necessary. I skipped the ice cream because the portions were quite large - I would make at least 8 cakes if serving with ice cream. The cakes were great on their own and would be good plain for breakfast or teatime (you could put more raspberries into the batter to make up for the lack of sauce). The baking time is rather long - if your oven runs hot, start checking after 30 minutes.
