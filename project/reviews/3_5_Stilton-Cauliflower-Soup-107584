Excellelnt soupd - after I skipped the cornstarch and the cream and used no-fat milk. Next time I will put some slated corn nuts on top as a garnish. I also may try it with broccoli and cheddar. I suspect that if you use cornstarch and cream, the consistency will be like wall paper paste.

Really easy for a week night and really tasty. I used a whole head of cauliflower, definitely over half a pound and increased everything accordingly. After pureeing it was definitely thick enough, so I didn't include the cream or cornstarch. We garnished with toasted almonds inspired by another recipe on the site. The combo of blue cheese and almonds was fantastic!

Way too much butter and onion. It only needs 1 T of butter. Only use that much onion if you like things sweet. I don't. I prefer green onion to avoid that sweetness. I added a pinch of nutmeg and a generous shake of chili powder. I didn't bother with cream or cornstarch, and I used a higher ratio or chicken stock to milk. To thicken, I threw in a handful of rice at the start. At the end, I divided the soup in two and put Stilton in one half, and Maclaren's cheddar (the kind that comes in a red tub) in the other. I really preferred the cheddar one, although both were good. Next time I think I'll try a smoked cheese, probably a smoked cheddar, and I might start with a couple of slices of bacon, diced, instead of the butter.

*** will definitely make this again... creamy/delicious *** also used 1% milk but added a little more cream to compensate *** doubled the Stilton *** would recommend lessening the white pepper by 50% as it dominated the flavour *** used extra cauliflower, and will use even more (double) next time

Made this almost exactly like the recipe - added a diced carrot and 2 cloves of garlic. Used blue cheese instead of stilton. It was delicious but I don't think it needs cream - it was plenty thick without cornstarch and the cream just thinned it out and diluted the taste.

Love this soup. Usually make it without any cream (substituting milk) and vegetable bouillon instead of the chicken broth. It can turn a little salty between the bouillon and the cheese. Don't think it stores so well, settling on the bottom ... should be eaten in one or two sittings.

Very tasty and easy. I made a number of changes in preparation method, but ultimately the taste is the same as if I followed the recipe exactly - just a little bit different texture.You definitely don't need the cornstarch if you use some extra cauliflower.

Tasty and easy! I used half white and half orange cauliflower left over from another dish and it ended up being a nice yellow colour. Doubled the Stilton and it came through really nicely. Also used skim milk instead of whole.

I thought this soup was quite tasty. I used low fat milk for both the whole milk and cream and it was plenty rich. Also I used organic vegetable stock, as I keep kosher and wouldn't use chicken stock and cheese in the same dish. I will make again. I like the suggestion of a garnish on top - chives or maybe homemade croutons.

I made this soup (sort of) and thought it was delicious. I used a small head of cauliflower and an equal amount of broccoli since I had some that really needed to be used up right away. I used half and half, maybe a little extra stilton (I didn't measure it), no cornstarch, and I forgot the garlic. I also added some flatleaf parsley and fresh thyme from the garden. It turned out quite lovely.

I used extra sharp cheddar instead of stilton and this was fantastic!!! Next time I will see how it is with the stilton or some type of blue. My Husband thought it was great too! It is almost like 'Haggen Das', very decadent and rich but not too heavy. Next time I make it I'll double the recipe, the original amounts don't make very much soup and we like to have leftovers around. I also would suggest putting some kind of garnish on top to make a nice presentation. Otherwise the soup kind of looks like baby food cereal. A little paprika for colour, or some chopped chives would be nice on top. This soup is an elegant keeper for me !!!

This was delicious and quite filling; we made it for a light supper with fresh bread. We used only 1 Tbl butter, and used 2% evaporated condensed milk to replace the cream content since we were trying to be healthier. I don't think it lacked anything for doing so, it was still quite thick & creamy & lovely. Absolutely would make again.

Delicious. I used regular blue cheese and mashed the cauliflower with a potato masher instead of pureeing in the blender as I like it a little thicker/chewier. It turned out great. Also used 2% milk because I never buy whole milk.

The other recipe for cauliflower stilton soup (on this site) is much better in my opinion.

Some friends from the UK just gave us a kilo of Stilton and I was looking for a recipe to use a small bit of it. I agree with the people that omitted the cornstarch. I used cream rather than milk and it added the extra thickness and creaminess the cornstarch would have given. The taste and texture was excellent. The Stilton flavor was subtle, not over powering. My daughter, who does not like cauliflower or any blue type cheese, loved it. This is a new favorite soup.

Delicious! I used an entire head of cauliflower (didn't need to thicken it with cornstarch) added a bit of fresh thyme with the broth and milk, and garnished it with finely chopped chives. It was also very tasty the next day -- cold.

An excellent soup. I added 1/2 cup of brandy between the saute and adding the stock, and it added some depth to the recipe. Like other chefs noted, increasing the cauliflower works very well in this recipe.

Really lovely dish. I also made a lower fat version using milk; the rich velvety flavor with the Stilton is just excellent. I am not a cauliflower fan myself, but I will definitely make this again.

I hate cauliflower so I was dubious when my wife suggested it as a way to use up the two heads from our CSA. I do love stilton and it seemed preferable to tossing food in the compost bin. I was amazed. I love this soup, and the next time we wind up with cauliflower in our weekly box we'll make this again

I tweaked this recipe a bit and made a lower-fat version of this soup. Taking the advice of other reviewers, I increased cauliflower to a full head, and added leeks and garlic to the onion and celery mixture and used 1% milk. The additional cauliflower gave a rich, thick, velvety texture, and I was able to eliminate both the cream and the cornstarch. The texture was outstanding, the flavor was good, but it needed a bit of a punch that even a sprinkling of cayenne couldn't deliver. It needs a bit of acidity (I think champagne vinegar would be good) and a bit more kick. I finished the pot of soup with a pat of butter for taste and texture.

Because I had it, I used 1/4 lb. of the Stilton and probably a bit more cauliflower than called for. The result? Spectacular! I've renamed the recipe "Potage de Neige Velouté."

I used almost double the amount of cauliflower. This resulted in a very satisfying texture without using cornstarch. Added just a splash of champagne vinegar for a little acid kick. Also, I used a wand blender to blend the soup right in the pot.

This is a wonderful, simple and easy soup. I, too, eliminated the cornstarch and used half and half. While sauteing the onions and celery I sprinkled in flour and a bit of curry powder for texture and flavor. Agree that leaving some of the soup un-pureed and increasing the amount of stilton and salt/pepper gives it a nice boost.

Awesome, elegant soup. I skipped the cornstarch, used half and half instead of milk, and seasoned it a little more heavily (more cheese, more salt & pepper). Would have been perfect with diced fried leeks as garnish to contrast velvety texture. Beautiful soup.

This soup is fantastic; if you double the cornstarch, you can eliminate the cream

I liked this recipe alot. The next time I make it I will only blen half of the cauliflour mixture. That way the soup will have some texture, which it is lacking.

Great soup. Made for a Sunday night supper, but would be perfect as starter for a roast beef dinner. Doubled recipe to serve 4 as main course. Also added more Stilton as had extra to use and wanted a stronger flavor. Should have used croutons to give some crunch - a crusty bread was not quite enough. also a snip of chives would be elegant.

The other stilton Cauliflower soup on this site is far superior and uses many of suggestions of the other reviewers. I've been making it ever since a day in February, 1996 when the mailman put my copy of Bon Appetit in my mailbox.

As with the others I used one pound of cauliflower. In addition, I substituded Stilton with Maytag. Added one small head of roasted garlic. Substituted half and half with heavy cream. Also added a little crushed red pepper. Definitely decadent!

Rating: 3
Very tasty...but I did take some tips from other reviewers, using a whole cauliflower, which made it alot thicker, so I did not need the cornstarch or the cream. I also used gorgonzola, and added some garlic and red pepper. The soup was velvety and delicious. Definately a good way to eat your veggies!

Rating: 3
This is good but definitely needs some bite. On the second making I added a healthy pinch of crushed red pepper and it seemed to do the trick. (Noting that Italian's usually add crushed red pepper to almost anything consisting mainly of Cauliflower) Overall ingredients are fine but without the addition of some 'bite' it lacks. Served with a simple green salad and some very crusty bread. Not bad!

As I was adjusting seasonings after finishing preparation, I decided it was missing something. I added a little over a tablespoon of smashed roasted garlic I had on hand and it seemed to give it a more complete taste. It was a very nice late supper with a salad and crusty bread.

I used a whole head of cauliflower. I added 3 cloves of garlic 2 minutes prior to milk and stock. I found I needed more milk ( probably because i used whole head of caulif), but didnt need the cornstarch and substituted milk for cream to reduce the calories and fat content. Would make again..but would add diced jalepenos to give it a little zing!!

It was very good. I too used a full head of cauliflower. My lady friend thought it was great.

I agree with the previous reviewers who suggested doubling the cauliflower, since I prefer my soup a little thicker than this one came out. The ground pepper lent some bite immediately after cooking, but the soup became milder in flavor the next day.

This recipe was delicious. My 13-month-old loved it, and this was her first time eating cauliflower. Like another reviewer, I used an entire head of cauliflower. We don't eat it often, and the leftovers might have otherwise gone to waste. Our Super Stop 'N Shop didn't have Stilton cheese, so I substituted gorgonzola. I'd definitely make this again. Next time, I'll puree it longer, or in 3 batches rather than 2. The only thing I (mildly) disliked is that the texture was slightly grainy, and I think it was because I didn't puree it long enough.

As others have noted, this soup is amazing. My co-worker concurred, as he finished off my leftovers for lunch. I also used a whole head of cauliflower, which was a good decision as the soup was extra creamy and thick.

This soup is good, but also dangerous! I made this soup and it was very good, especially with a clove of garlic added with the onion. But please, please be careful: two days after eating this soup I fell off a ladder and hurt my elbow terribly!!! Therefore, I have to recommend against making this soup, as it can be very very dangerous. If you absolutely must make this soup, please take my advice and stay away from ladders for at least a week!!! Or more!!!

This soup was delicious! I used a whole head of cauliflower to increase nutritinal content, which made it a bit thicker, therefore did not need to add the extra thickener. The Stilton added just the right amount of pizazz. It was also a very easy recipe to make. Will definitely make this again real soon.

This is wonderful! I prepared it for a romantic Christmas Eve dinner, and it survived sitting on the stove for an extra hour when family dropped in. The texture is creamy and luxurious, and the flavor is extraordinary--good quality cheese is a must!
