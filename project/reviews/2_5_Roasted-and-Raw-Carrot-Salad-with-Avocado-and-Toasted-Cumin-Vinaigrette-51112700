I made this recipe because I wanted to find something to do with the mizuna I bought for the first time at the farmer's market. (Didn't have other greens or would thrown them in but I thought it might be bitter on its own, but it was alright). This was alright but nothing special. The roast carrot was very tasty but overall the salad was bland. The raw carrots were pretty and I can imagine would be lovely if I had multicolored carrots (need to find a way to get them that pretty in a less time-consuming manner). Could not taste the cumin (used the method recommended). It was impossible to crush with mortar and pestle so ended up putting it through a spice grinder anyway (use fine setting). Probably my cumin was old, but I may have also used to much greens because I didn't measure them. I didn't have baby coloured carrots so I used regular orange carrots. I would definitely add more avocado if I could have spared more (made avocado ice cream with some others-delish). Too much work for something so simple.
