It is nice to see a recipe using lemon juice for the acid. Am alergic to vinegar so it limits the ingredients I can use. I also used a whole apple (cut up in matchstick size pieces), half a savoy cabbage and 1/2 c. blanched almonds. Put the hot almonds on the salad. The butter from the nuts melded with the lemon juice to give the salad a nice mouth feel and not make it too sour. Surprisingly, this somehow all works. A little blue cheese would go really well with it.

I varied the recipe using a Braeburn apple and walnut pieces carmelized with brown sugar, and I added some lightly saut'eed pieces of chicken breast, and the result was wonderful.

Not a recipe I'd make again. Dull, bland...

For the few ingredients, ease of preparation, this recipe is four forks, will definitely be making it again.

I used 1/2 savoy cabbage, 1 gala apple, and 1/2 cup buttered pecans. This was amazing, so fresh and so delicious. This was by far the best coleslaw I've ever had!

I absolutely love this slaw and doubt I will ever make any other! I followed the recipe except that I used bagged broccoli slaw since I had it on hand. My kids and husband also like it. Dinner also included baby back pork ribs with a hard apple cider BBQ sauce and roasted garlic mashed sweet potatoes.

We really liked this. Very good flavor. I wasn't that careful about quantities, but I think the sugared pecans are key. I will make again.

Definitely a keeper, although with a few crucial changes: I added apple cider vinegar/olive oil and dried cranberries.

There are so few ingredients that we had our doubts-- but it was great!! I made it as described but did not have any chives and I used salted butter. Will make it part of my regular repetoire. The buttered pecans are essential.

This is fine if you got the ingredients at hand. I don't think I'd go out of my way to make it again tho.

Soooo easy and delicious! I subbed almonds for pecans and added fresh goat cheese - we couldn't believe the dressing was just lemon juice - it was so tasty. And soooooooo healthy!

This is a great recipe. I omit the butter and instead dry roast the pecans and then roll them in maple syrup (while still hot) to give them a crispy sweet flavor. I think the recipe is better after a day in the fridge.

This has become a staple at our house - always a little different each time. Today's batch is simply sliced cabbage and gala apples tossed with tangerine juice; I recommend sweeter citrus juices to anyone who found this dish too tart. - BTW, this dish REQUIRES some kind of citrus juice. Without it, the apples turn brown, of course - but not only that, the cabbage also turns gray after several days.

I made this salad (x4) for our holiday party and it was a huge favorite. I added cinnamon and nutmeg and about a Tbsp of Apple Cider Vinegar to balance the flavors. Also I used 1/2 pecans and 1/2 walnuts. Guests loved it and said that it filled them up heartily so that they could resist pigging out on cookies etc later. So proud of my salad eating guests! I'd definitely recommend this as a great party dish. Even my non-vegetable eating people and kids liked it.

This was very tasty; however, I tweaked the recipe and prefer the dish with my additions. I added about 3/4 cup Greek yogurt, a pinch of nutmeg, cinnamon, and allspice, a little extra sugar and lemon, and pomegranate seeds. Yummy! I served it two a few others and received awesome reviews.

Great hit! Perfect fresh bite along side a rich/spicy entry. Thai for example. Be sure to cover and chill the salad for about 30 mins before serving. Gives the flavors a chance to connect. Next time I'll add chopped grilled chicken!

This was good, and I'd definitely make again. Not too heavy, but had a lot of flavor and like others said, a nice alternative to slaw with mayo.

Pretty austere, but good.

We didn't like this made with the lemon juice, so we added some mayo and it still didn't seem quite right, so we added some carrots, and then some raisins and then some pineapple. By this time we're dealing with a completely different recipe, but it was pretty good.

I have made this slaw twice. It's so much lighter than oil laden slaws. The pecans provide just enough fat, taste and crunch to make it pleasant. Do prepare ahead. It takes a little while for the lemon juice to perform its magic.

We enjoyed this...another variation we tried was to omit the lemon and sugar and added Miracle Whip
