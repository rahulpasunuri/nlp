super duper. perhaps the best squash soup i have ever made. i doubled the spices and then some, added a cup or two of sour yogurt and served it up hot with a plate of roasted brussel sprouts, beets, and tofu. it was very good.

As it is often difficult to find any winter squash here I have taken to substituting sweet potato -- it works excellently with this recipe. I made it for a lunch group at work and they all asked for the recipe.

This was a good soup, but seemed to be very bland for a Thai-inspired recipe. I added 2 tsp of Thai roasted red chile paste in additional to the one in the recipe. I also added salt and a tsp of fish sauce. Even after adding the extra chile paste, the soup was mildly spiced beat-wise. I liked other reviews suggesting other squashes and seasonings.

excellent! I had this chilled but it would be great hot, also.

Followed the recipe as written, except substituted sour cream for the yogurt. It was an okay soup, but nothing special and not worth making again.

I made this recipe exactly as instructed, and truly enjoyed the outcome. It was smooth, and delicious. Maybe I might preferred just a little bit more spices, but that's a personal preference. The guests I cooked for did not enjoy the soup however, and I think the main reason was the "cold soup" factor. So lesson learned here, before I serve up cold soup to anyone, I'll check what their feelings are towards a chilled soup.

Excellent recipe. I wasn't able to find a crookneck squash so I used a butternut squash and it was delicious. I also couldn't wait for it to cool to eat, although I look forward to the leftovers chilled in a couple hours!

We couldn't wait the first time and ate it hot without blending and it was delicious! Good either way

My friend Katie made this as a first course for a birthday luncheon yesterday. She used chopped chives instead of cilantro. It was gorgeous and tasted heavenly. It's perfect for sophisticated adults but I know my teenagers will flip over it when I make it. I'm curious as to whether it can be made with frozen squash puree from my grocer's freezer; if so this will be a 10 minute perfect meal.

I followed the recipe to a T except for using butternut squash rather than yellow squash, garam masala instead of curry powder and kari leaves rather than fresh coriander. It was DELICIOUS (I served it warm too) and I will be making this again often.

What a delightful change of pace for the summer menu! This soup couldn't be easier to make, and the ingredients come together in a lovely chilled puree that doesn't overpower, rather it develops in your mouth nicely with the fresh taste of the squash, the warmth of the curries, and the balance of coconut milk. An easy and impressive little first course, or wonderful with Na'an bread as a light entree.
