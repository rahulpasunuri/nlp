Excellent. I made this as directed as part of Christmas dinner. I wouldn't recommend making the souffles in advance, or they will be less fluffy, but they work wonderfully with the salad!

OMG! This souffle is fabulous! We were all swooning! I made the salad with regular greens and the pear.

This was my first attempt at a soufflé and it was wonderful! I love the blue cheese flavor and the salad was the perfect compliment! I have made this twice as a first course at a dinner party and received rave reviews both times  even from a guest who thought that he did not like blue cheese.

This was a fantastic opener for a birthday dinner that I prepared recently. Everyone just raved about them, and then asked me for the recipe! They came out of the oven puffy and wonderful; alas they did fall, but not too badly. I served them at room temperature. I would prepare and present these again.

This is a superb recipe that is simple and the product is delicious. I've tried it three times with three different blue cheeses, all to excellent effect. It is a good way to use up very "stinky" cheese (use slightly less than called for). I prefer to serve the mini-souffles at room temperature, accompanied by a variety of sauteed or steamed vegetables for a great "picnic" dinner. ONE NOTE: The recipe calls for preheating the oven too early. Turn on the oven after the roux is made to minimize energy usage.

The souffle has absolutely fantastic flavor...it didn't rise as much as I'd hoped and it did fall when removed from the water bath, but it was still delicious and a hit for the party. The salad was OK...I'm not a huge watercress fan because I always end up looking like a rabbit trying to eat it. But, the combination looked beautiful and served with a great Reisling made for a perfect first course.

Really enjoyed the idea of this recipe as a first course to the beef tenderloin meal as suggested on the side of the screen. But I found the beligian endive a touch bitter. Although it was quite good served with the sweet and tartness of the dressing and the asian pear. Soufflé was very good, but was disappointed it did not rise as much as I expected it. Everyone however, seemed to really enjoy it. Good starter for a red carpet-style meal. Would make something similar to that again.

My suggestion is to make this recipe ONLY if you are a huge blue cheese fan. We followed the recipe exactly and felt it was just okay -- it had a very strong flavor. Ours puffed up in the oven during baking but fell after we removed it from the water bath, however, I don't believe this impeded the flavor or texture. I wonder how this would turn out if you used havarti or some other mild cheese??

I made two dozen of these as a side for Thanksgiving. Not only were they easy, but you really CAN make them in advance and reheat! A full 2/3 of my guests asked for the recipe and my SO asked for them again the very next day. A keeper for sure.

if you love blue cheese, you must make this. i couldn't stop tasting the souffle base. used maytag blue, and made 3 larger souffles rather than six 1-cup ones. and i just added an Asian pear to a salad bag that already included walnuts and dried cranberries along with some leftover Maytag crumbles. so delicious, it could be a good side for a steak as well.

Absolutely delicious. Even reheated the next day, it was great.

Yes, this is so good, I am going to fix this for the second time tonight. When I made it before, I used pine nuts, and other than that, followed the recipe.
