Loved this recipe. Quick, easy, tasty and I'm not a big chicken eater. Used 1-1/2 med to large onion. Squeezed Bearss lime over it instead of lemon.

I thought this dish was great! First it was very easy to make. Second, the sauce gives the chicken a lot of flavor, and the kale is a perfect vegetable to accompany the chicken. I personally would have liked a thicker sauce, so next time I make it I may boil it down a little more or something.

This smelled so good while it was cooking. I had high hopes. I added some chickpeas to the stewing chicken and served everything over orecchiette. It was edible and nutritious, but nothing in the dish really popped. Won't make it again.
