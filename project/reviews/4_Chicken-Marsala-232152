This recipe is fabulous!!! This is my husbands favorite dish. He wanted to take me out for Valentine's Day to this speciality italian restaurant. I decided I preferred a more intimate personal dining experience w/o the crowds and noise of a restaurant. I prepared the dish exactly! as instructed...unsalted butter, fresh sage, shallots not onion....etc. It is very important if you want this to turn out perfect to follow ingredient lists and instructions. I did use 3 varieties of mushrooms (baby bella, white, and shitake) and was careful to brown them generously. I think this adds depth to the flavor. THe sauce was perfectly thick. The flvor was wonderful. I chose for my Marsala wine Taylor Marsala. It was the black label described as "creamy, medium sweet". It was perfect.

This is a family favourite. What I do is once the sauce is all mixed (I don't continue cooking on the stove) I add it to the chicken in the pan and then cook it in the oven (covered) for a few hours at 300 and it comes out amazing. It's good to do ahead and then just throw it in the oven in the afternoon and leave it till the company arrives for dinner. I think last time I made it - it was in the oven for at least 4 hours. I like the idea of using 1/2 and 1/2 or just milk instead of the cream - will have to try that next time. I got the idea from my sister-in- law who does it this way also.

I made this recipe originally 5 years ago. This Christmas I was in need of a non-beef dish and was excited to find this recipe saved in my recipe box. SO VERY GOOD! The recipe itself is slightly clunky but once you go through it once everything makes sense. The only change I made in order to save time was that I cut the chicken in 1 - 1 1/2" cubes and cooked as directed. Still terrific!!!

Outstanding Recipe as for additions -- the menu to the right suggests Fettuccine Brussels Sprouts and Pine Nuts -- which is a great accompaniment. Don't be scared of the Brussels Sprouts -- as every review there points at they are NOT your mother's Brussels Sprouts.

My husband loves chicken marsala so I thought I'd give this recipe a go. After reading reviews, I also added garlic to the shallots, replaced the heavy cream with half and half and replaced some of the butter with vegetable oil. The dish turned out fantastic...still rich, but not over-the-top heavy. Because some reviewers complained about the sauce being too thin, I floured the chicken breasts twice -- I first salt/peppered the breasts, dredged them in flour, let them sit while I prepped the other ingredients. Right before I put them in the pan, I dredged them again. That left enough flour in the pan so that the sauce came out a nice consistency. Finally, I use "Better than Bouillon" reduce sodium chicken broth which is a concentrate so rather than make the full amount of broth and reduce it on the stovetop, I just dissolved a little more than 1 tsp of the bouillon in 3/4 cup of boiling water. Great time saver and they have the best store bought broth out there.

This is an excellent recipe for Chicken Marsala. We eat gluten-free and tapioca flour worked perfectly as a coating for the chicken as well as to thicken the sauce. Substituted skim milk and more butter instead of the cream. Buy real Marsala wine and not cooking Marsala!

I omitted the cream from the sauce to make the dish lighter but it was still delicious. It just required more broth/wine. I also sauteed the chicken in only olive oil and it was absolutely fine.

This was delicious. The best recipe yet. My teenage boys liked it so much that they asked me to make it the next night so they could invite a couple of friends over for dinner. And yes, sage makes a huge difference.

Loved this but trying to cook the chicken scallopines in the pan was a bit of a disaster. The first one was perfect but as the pan got hotter my butter was burning pretty quickly, even with the added olive oil. So I had lots of black flecks in the sauce and the last few pieces of chicken looked a bit Cajun-style! And it was a hassle wiping it out and adding olive oil and butter over and over again. I'd recommend just using the oil and pulling them out once both sides are a nice golden yellow, then put them all in the oven at the same time to finish them (7-8 minutes). The sauce also took longer to reduce than I expected, and was a little runnier than I would have liked. Perhaps add a bit less cream or a bit of cornstarch. I added two cloves of minced garlic to the shallot mix as another reviewer suggested. Also, you can easily double the amount of sage, and sprinkle some on the chicken before you flour them for a little extra oomph. Reduce the stock and make the mushrooms ahead of time and then set them aside to free up one of your burners for making pasta.

Turned out delicious!! Really easy to make and the sauce was amazing! I didn't use sage because I didn't have any so I'm curious if it would make a big difference in taste.

Here were the changes I made: Chicken Thighs (bone-in and with skin) not breasts. Port Wine, not Marsala. Small onion and 3 garlic cloves, not shallots. Did not reduce chicken broth. Only used a couple Tablespoons of cream. Here is how I made it: Heated oil in a dutch oven. Dredged thighs, browned on both sides, set aside. Sauteed onions and mushrooms in same dutch oven, cooked until liquid was almost gone. Added garlic and sage. After a few minutes, add broth and wine. Add browned thighs, cover loosely and simmer 30 min. Remove chicken, turn up heat and reduce sauce a bit. Finish with a couple of Tablespoons of heavy cream. YUM. I served over noodles. The sauce is fan-tastic!

Loved this! Like other reviewers, added garlic to the sauce, but gave it an extra twist - sliced chicken into medallions before battering them in flour, sauteed them 2 min per side, then wrapped them in prosciutto and seared each side until crisp. Topped it off with pears marinated in Leopold's NY apple-flavored whisky and sugar for a garnish on top. Highly recommend!!

I was looking for a recipe featuring sage and this truly was excellent. I simplified it a lot by doing cutting up the chicken breast into cubes, flouring and browning them. I added them to the sauce. I did do the chicken broth reduction, that was easy. I used baby bella mushrooms as they are a bit tastier than the plain white ones. I only had a bit over 1 pound of chicken breasts, but I made the full sauce recipe and wished we had a little more. So I'll double the recipe next time - not sure how that will work with some of the steps.

Last night I made this recipe for my Man & me while on Vacation in Fl. Chicken Marsala is one of his favorite dishes, so whenever I treat him to it I try to go the extra mile in finding an even better recipe than the previously attempt! I've mad it at least 3 times now! And the turn out last night made for a great sauce and a fun creation! The sauce w the shallots and sage really added a special flavor of Awesomeness! Thanks! I asked for feedback from his Critic taste buds ;) and he said the chicken itself needed more flavor?!? I took it as a compliment seeing how naked chicken breast are blan to begin with. Any ideas??!!

Very rich. We served it over egg noodles. Good for special occasions but a little too rich for average meals. Next time I'll try it with milk or 1/2 n 1/2 instead of the heavy cream. I didn't bother reducing the broth - I just used less water. I also didn't bother flattening the chicken - I just sliced it into thin, small cutlets.

Followed the recipe to a tee. Sauce was a bit thin, added par boiled fresh pasta to soak up the sauce, the result? Casserole type dish, that tastes like the "sauce" was condensed cream of mushroom soup. Don't get me wrong the result was definately worth eating... But the work involved for a so so result, won't make again. I guess this 6th recipe for chicken Marsala is not a keeper .

Yes, yes and YES, I would make this again! This is a classic-tasting chicken marsala that is a bit heavy on the prep work (I would prep in advance when I make this in the future) but the taste is so worth it. If you don't have marsala wine, it would also be delicious made with white wine, or perhaps cognac (use less cognac and more broth). A winner!

Great recipe, more over, great sauce! I would double the sauce portion while keeping the original chicken portion on this recipe and serve this over lightly buttered fettuccine next time.

Rating: 4
I've been making this recipe for years and my fans absolutely love it. However, I cook the floured chicken lightly in the pan and then transfer into oven and pour the sauce in the pan, spooning the mushrooms evenly over the chicken and then I top it with parmesan cheese. If you cook it at 300-325 for about 15 minutes, the chicken really absorbs the mushroom sauce. I broil it for 3 minutes to get a crispy parm layer on top. I really can't imagine it any other way.

Rating: 4
Rich, but fantastic. Definitely a company-worthy recipe but simple enough for a weeknight. I used a combo of chicken broth & boullion as suggested to cut back on time and omitted any additional salt. I didn't have fresh sage so used a combo of fresh thyme and dried sage. I also found it didn't thicken quite as much as I'd like, so mashed together 1 T of butter and 1 T of flour to whisk in, which took care of that.

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe and very tasty. I also had sauce that was too thin, but I thickened it a bit with flour/water mix and it worked perfectly. Did not affect flavor. this little variation was so easy I thought it still deserved 4 forks. Definitely will make again.

Rating: 4
This was probably the best chicken dish I've ever eaten. OMG. I have two suggestions which will simplify this recipe and did not seem to affect the results. One, don't try to reduce chicken broth. Simply use 3/4 cup of water and 1 3/4 teaspoons of chicken bouillon. Secondly, use chicken tenders instead of breast and you can skip pounding out the chicken. Excellent recipe.

Rating: 3
This was delicious and I will definitely make again. The fresh sage really adds depth to the flavors. The reason for the 3 vs 4 forks is that the sauce did not thicken enough, and was too liquidy. I did simmer the broth until it was fully reduced just as recipe called for, so it wasn't that I skipped that step.I did see that a couple of other posters had similar results. Has anyone solved this - adding flour or other thickener?

Completely worthy of the 4 fork review. Simple ingredients and easy preparation. Timeless. Classic. Perfect.

This recipie is great, but be careful to follow the instructions regarding pounding the chicken- you really don't want the breasts to be too thick, it will mean they will need to sautée longer than the ideal, making them dry. Also be careful about cleaning the saucepan out in between chicken batches- the pan will dry out and get crusty, & if you try to add more butter the chicken will become very greasy as well.

I had to change my diet to a gluten free diet recently so I am on a learning curve to substituting rice flour versus wheat flour so I wasn't too sure how this was going to turn out.The chicken did not brown as well with the rice flour but it was covered with sauce so no one noticed. I made this because I had mushrooms, cream, chicken breasts and spinach that had to be used.It took a little longer because I served this over real mashed potatoes. I used a very good quality Marsala,it was worth it. The only thing was my a tad bit thinner but not too much.. the smashed potatoes picked up the sauce and it was on a scale of one to ten, ten being the best this was about a 9.5 . My husband the foodie gave it that rating. He said he didn't notice the difference in rice versus the wheat flour.

Excellent dish. I agree with some of the other cooks that a recipe is simply a guide and I did my own tweaking to this one. I used a combination of shitake, cremini & white button mushrooms and I also used sweet marsasla rather than dry. I prepared it in 2 pans, a saucepan for the stock reduction & my all tme favorite a 12" Faberware stainless steel skillet. I also used clarified butter to saute the chicken. I had no problem with the sauce thickening, mine was excellent & I had more than enough for both the chicken & linguine. I served this with roasted asparagus & a lovely bottle of White Burgandy.

This is my husbands and my favorite date night recipe. It's a great dish to make together. He pounds and saute's the chicken while I make the sauce. We have so much fun cooking it together. It is also always a hit when we have guests over. We use sweet marsala instead of dry, and swear by that substitution. Also try it with portobello mushrooms. We would make this every week if it wasn't for the fat content. It's worth it to us to have on special occasions though. YUM!!!!

This is far and beyond the best I have ever had! The second time I made it, I sliced the chicken breast cross-wise instead of pounding it, cut it into smaller pieces and knew from having made it before that I HAD to double the sauce.

I had attempted Chicken Marsala once before and the chicken was tough. This recipe was fantastic! The only thing I did differently (besides using half and half instead of cream)was change up the order of the recipe so I could use just one pot. I first browned the chicken in my Le Creuset, removed it and set it aside. Then I added more butter and cooked the shallots and mushrooms, etc. Then I deglased the pan with the mushrooms still it it. I then added the chicken back in and covered and simmered for about 20 minutes. This let the chicken become extra tender. This might be the first time I've made anything that was better than a restaurant.

A keeper & new favorite!! I made this recipe for a dinner party of seven last night and it was a huge hit. I read a number of the reviews and tweaked the recipe a bit&. I used a mix of mushrooms and used more than called for but not quite double. And be prepared to spend a little more time to cook off the liquid. I also used sweet marsala and IMO this is a key change. For the 8 servings I was making I used 1 ¾ cups (called for one). And when it came time to add it to the skillet I let it reduce just a bit to get some of that jammy quality everyone loves. Even doing that I think the sauce needs a few more minutes to thicken up. Its a personal preference, but I prefer mine on the thicker side. I didnt have the time to let it come together on its own so I sprinkled a bit of cornstarch (like other viewers) and PERFECTO! And I almost forgot the fresh sage. I stirred it in right before serving and it was another lovely dimension of flavor. Ive made a note to always do it at the last minute. And I skipped the lemon this time. I dont think it was missed. I served this with angel hair pasta, asparagus and garlic bread. Next time Ill use chicken strips or chunks to save effort and cooking time. And I may double the sauce and see how well it freezes& Thanks to all the reviewers of this recipe! And if youre reading this and debating if its worth the effort& it most certainly is!

Loverly way to use up your marsala, and a great reason to go right out and buy a new bottle! I followed the recipe's measures for the sauce and didn't find the result to be overly creamy, nor was it overpowered by the the sage. The only thing I did differently was use boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts; the thighs didn't require flattening and are somewhat richer tasting to me. Oh yeah!

Nobody loves cream sauces more than I do, but in this case, I think the cream detracted from the dish. It muted the marsala taste and the sauce just tasted like, well, a cream sauce. I followed the recipe exactly, and everyone loved it, but I have had better chicken marsalas... rich brown sauce without cream.

The sauce is wonderful, the chicken tender - be careful not to overcook the chicken, can dry out.

I thickened my sauce w/ a bit of corn starch. I would recommend assembling all the ingredients BEFORE you start cooking and read through the recipe thoroughly!

Fresh sage is essential too.

I firmly susbcribe to the tenet that a recipe is a guideline, not a rule. That being said, I made a few changes as I cooked this recipe. I used thighs cut in 1/2" dice, tossed those whole wheat flour seasoned with S&P. I never use canned broth, rather restaurant-quality stock concentrate, and used concentrate in the amount required for 1 3/4 c broth but used only 3/4 c H2O. Used home-dried sage from my garden, crumpled, at the amount the recipe called for fresh. Deglazed/reduced marsala, added "broth" and cream, and added diced chicken with mushrooms. Served over whole wheat pasta, with absolutely no issue with consistency. Easy, breezy, lemon peasy. Nice weeknight dinner.

This recipe was easy to follow and the consistency of the sauce was smooth. I used a few different kinds of mushrooms for texture and taste (including some shitake and oyster), fresh sage from my own garden, and really nice marsala wine. Nonetheless, the taste was just okay. It was much more flavorful the next day, so if I make it again I will probably make it a day in advance to really get the flavors to come together. I also served it over egg noodles with a side of grilled asparagus as others have recommended. It was a good trio, but needs some time for all the flavors to interact.

This chicken marsala recipe was the very first recipe I opened on epicurious, and I am very glad for it! I have never made chicken marsala before, and this was an easy recipe to follow and the meal was fantastic, my guests also agreed!

I will definitely make this again.

To Samantha 1824, The 3 reasons it would have curdled are, your cream was too old, the lemon juice itself reacting to the cream, or possibly the utensils you were using were unclean and had traces of acid or tannin. If you keep whisking sometimes it will come together, but once it separates it's kind of done. I am going to make this recipe, but since no one else seems to have mentioned the same issue, did you follow the recipe in the order it appears? Otherwise, I don't know and I cook and bake daily. Perhaps you put the lemon in too soon? I'm trying this tomorrow, we shall see

At the end, to balance the heartier mushroom flavor of the portabellos, I used 1/4 C of Marsala and added 2t. cornstarch mixed with 2T water to thicken the sauce. This was so tasty that my son who hates mushrooms declared it "very yummy." This recipe is a keeper.

I have made this recipe quite a few times and it always turns out yummy! I actually have served this over a bed of light angel hair pasta with some sort of sauteed veggie on the side with some of the additional sage. Highly recommend ... easy and the taste is delicious!

Wow, this is so yummy ! I used way more wine than it called for ;) ..the flavor was just so great, used yellow onions instead of shallots (didn't have any) and I cut them into thin rings instead of chopping them and used about 3 or 4, and the cream?....the sauce tasted great without it but I added it anyway because the recipe called for it. Yes, I think it might have made it better (heavy cream usually does). I was so glad I doubled the mushrooms and the sauce. Heehee I used about 2/3 of the bottle of marsala wine and it was just Perfect. Don't skimp on the quality of the wine... I also added a heaping tbs of rubbed sage. Served it over wide "no yolk" noodles. I give it 4 Forks ! (I don't know why it shows only 2) :(

Hi, I am in my 20s and discovering new recipes to add to my recipe book. Will add this one. Very tasty and boyfriend loved it. I only used 2 chicken breasts as well, but kept the same sauce and mushroom ratio. Next time I will reduce the amount of mushrooms and double or triple the sauce. If you like your sauce the consistency of gravy, and enough to pour over chicken or pasta, anticipate doubling it. I also found as I let the sauce sit it thickened as well. Though I used linguine with this dish next time I will try egg noodles. Happy Cooking!

This recipe is absolutely divine. I make the full marsala recipe for only two chicken breasts (skinless, boneless) and always get a loaf of moist focaccia to soak up anything left on the plate. A few notes: I only use one tablespoon of shallot, 1/2 cup of cream, and I don't add the sage or lemon juice at the end (I usually forget, but it's never suffered for lack of either). I use regular-sodium chicken broth and the same amount of salt and pepper - then reduce the whole sauce at the end until it has a creamy thick consistency. Definitely double the recipe if you're trying to feed four people; I think the key to success with this dish is waiting for the sauce to reduce so the flavors condense and come together - don't make my initial mistake of adding more cream to make the sauce creamy, just wait for it to boil down and get thicker on its own.

I personally did not care for this recipe as I thought the cream stole the flavor of the marsala which I like alot.

This was delicious...very flavorful..probably because of all the butter. It's pretty easy to make and it's great reheated the next day. I butterflied skinless chicken breast instead of pounding the meat. I served it with egg noodles. This is definitely going under my favorite recipe file.

Made this last night and thought it was very good. I used baby belle mushroom- didn't have sage or cream so used dried Italian herbs ( freshly ground) and fat free half&half. At the end, I sprinkled the chicken with grated parmesan and ran it under the broiler. Will do again!

I've made this recipe several times and it's very good. However, I modified it slightly to how I prepare it now. I use 3/4 cup of chicken stock instead of reduced broth and only 1/2 a cup of cream. Not a dramatic reduction in the cream the recipe calls for, but it lets the great flavors come through so much more. It's a good go-to recipe that I prepare about maybe 2-3 times a month. Very good to begin with, but IMO the slight tweaks I made have made it a bit better.

Well, I guess food editor Paul Grimes loved mushrooms like his dad, because this is NOT Chicken Marsala, this is Chicken in a Mushroom Cream Sauce! I followed the recipe EXACTLY as shown. First of all, in spite of all the "chefs" out there who say "reduce reduce reduce", my sauce WOULD NOT reduce. I even gave it well over an extra half hour. I HAD evaporated the liquid from the mushrooms. Secondly, IT NEEDS MORE MARSALA!!! I couldn't taste my spirit store grade, and I even added a bit extra. The taste of the mushrooms is OVERPOWERING and I like them! In fact, I only used 8oz, not the 10 oz specified. Even our leftovers were runny! The CHICKEN was excellent. I will make it that way again - very simple, tender, moist and tasty. But if there aren't better Marsala sauces out there, I'll eat this mouse I'm about to click.

delish! my husband has been asking for this for quite some time and I finally got around to finding a recipe and this is fantastic...I at least doubled the shallots and used poly-fungi as suggested by another reviewer really yummy. We would have liked more 'shrooms--forgot how much they shrink. Also used more marsala to taste. White burgundy was a delightful partner.

OMG!!!! This exceptionally rich and flavorful recipe was the oomph I needed in my cooking arsenal. It was my first time cooking it and I couldn't have been more pleased. I tricked the recipe out by adding a wild array of mushrooms (as I am a lover of the fungi) that included shitake, baby porto bella, button, chanterelle and porcini. I don't how it tastes with one or two types but I won't be finding out anytime soon. I also added a whole white onion, thinly sliced. This dish is something to serve to a lover on valentine's day. You'll definitely be in a lip licking mood!

When my husband first suggested I put Chicken Marsala on the menu, I must admit my initial reaction was meh. It just struck me as one of those dishes you end up ordering at a sub-par restaurant because it might be the only thing the kitchen wont mess up too much. Even then, too many places overcook the chicken and the sauce leaves a whole lot to be desired. But thinking that I couldnt do any worse, I decided to give it a go (but with some reservations). With our first bites, there was absolute dead quiet. And then we looked at each other and I said, WOW  this is good. I mean, beyond good. This is incredibly, wonderfully good! WOW! The chicken was cooked just right  still juicy and oh-so-tender. But the sauce, the sauce was out of this world. I would have this sauce every day if it were possible. Its that great. My husband was only able to nod in agreement, because he was too busy scarfing down everything on his plate. There were instant regrets that I hadnt made the full recipe so we could have it again as leftovers. I will never think meh again when the subject of Chicken Marsala comes up. Really, if youve never tried making this dish, please do. Become one of the believers. For my full review, visit my blog at http://wrighttable.blogspot.com/.

I love this recipe since most of the prep work can be done in advance, and then finished off in 20 minutes or so - perfect for busy week nights. Since I'm usually making the recipe for two, I use 1 pound of breasts, leave the amount of sauce alone, and throw in a few more mushrooms. I also use 3/4 tsp of dried herbes de Provence if I don't have fresh sage. This is a keeper!

Rating: 4
Followed the recipe exactly, it turned out perfect. Served with linguine and garlic bread. Next time I'll give myself more time to prep this, maybe I was slow but it took me 90 minutes of intense cooking. I'd double the ingredients for the marsala sauce, we had just enough for 4 people to have 1 portion. I'll probably substitute 2% milk to lighten it up a bit next time. I'll definitely make this again.

Darn darn good!! Followed the recipe exactly - except used about 3 lbs of chicken and doubled the sauce. Also doubled the mushrooms because they add so much to the sauce. Excellent, delicious and easy. Highly recommended for dinner party. We prepared the chicken, kept it in the oven very low while we took care of the kids baths and bedtime, made the sauce and mixed it all together in the end. Just add garlic bread, salad and a glass of wine!!

This is a great recipe. Easy and delicious! I made this several times. I substituted butter with canola oil and cream with 2% milk.

Straight forward recipe, follow it and you will get delicious results! My husband is a picky eater and only recently started eating mushrooms and this is now his favorite dish... the 2/3 cup of cream certainly didn't hurt, either! I have made this with regular onion instead of shallots, and have been pleased with the results, but I am an onion lover so I don't mind the stronger taste. This recipe will stay in my kitchen forever.

Never made chicken marsala before but I picked this one based off the reviews and suggestions others have made. I followed the recipe as is and made one change and doubled the sauce as I was going to put it over a bed of linguine. I did reduce the sauce for double the time it suggested since I had doubled the recipe and then threw in just a little cornstarch to thicken as I just got a bit impatient. Worked perfectly. If you're not a mushroom eater, don't worry, I picked around the big chunks and let my boyfriend eat them. But I agree that you should cook with the mushrooms in it as it adds to the overall flavor.

I didn't like this recipe at all. And, having read all of the reviews, I am convinced I must have done something wrong in the preparation, since everyone else seemed to love it. The sauce was overly creamy, overly sweet, and bland. I felt like it needed a ton more lemon juice, or maybe more salt, or garlic, or just something else to give it a little oomph. It felt like we were eating tasteless cream sauce over chicken. I am going to try to make it again sometime (after the husband forgets this experience!) in the hope that I can correct whatever went wrong last time...

Truly a wonderful springboard for creative cooking! I made this yesterday for Mother's Day, and it was a terrific hit. My wife says it is better than Johnny Carino's (which is currently the best chain restaurant to get this dish, in my opinion). It was similar to Carino's, but with slightly thinner sauce. Also, Carino's doesn't include cream in their sauce, and this sauce (despite the cream) is a bit lighter and definitely less greasy. I did change a few things. I live in a small town, and the local package store only had sweet Marsala (Cribari 2007). It was quite good, though I can see the dry would be wonderful. I did taste the wine, and it seemed a bit cloyingly sweet for drinking alone. I used powdered rosemary instead of sage (I think I ended up using about 1 1/2 tsp total). I used half and half instead of cream, and I doubled the sauce and mushrooms (plus about oz extra mushrooms, for a total of 24 oz, and I added a little extra half and half as well). I did not cook ALL the water off from the mushrooms. The few ounces of broth made a nice addition to the sauce. The extra sauce made enough to have generous portions of sauce over fettuccine, and left over about 2 servings of sauce. I did not add extra Marsala at the end, because my wife is pregnant and my in-laws (who ate with us) abstain from alcohol for religious reasons. I simply added it all at the beginning so as to cook all the alcohol off. I added arrowroot starch to thicken the sauce, but it still could have been thicker (it ended up with a consistency like heavy cream). I used a lot of liquid with doubling the sauce, so I would recommend using an additional thickener if you double the sauce. All in all, it comes together nicely. It's an excellent, excellent recipe to use as a baseline from which to explore your inner gourmet. We will doubtless be having it again.

I was wowed by the flavor of the sauce but had trouble with the consistency. I tried it with Fat Free Half & Half instead of cream and that may have been my downfall.

Unless I can get the right consistency, however, I would refrain from this as a company dish.

I made this Chicken Marsala for a special luncheon for 8 women friends and the dish was delicious! Everyone wanted the recipe. To save some time I made the mushroom mixture ahead of time (day before) and then finished the recipe about a half hour before the girls arrived. Yes.. there were 2 saute pans, etc but I stashed the pans in my laundry sink and did them the next day. I served Spinach, Pear and Stilton Soup, a festive salad of celery, peppers, fresh dill, artichokes, etc, then the Chicken Marsala with a Potato Au Gratin, Green Beans with Pine Nuts. This a great dish and is sure to become one of our favourites. now.

This is the only chicken marsala I've ever eaten or cooked - MAGIC! I double the amount of all ingredients concerned with the sauce so there's enough for leftovers the next day. The 4 min estimate seems 'not long enough' but I consistently overcook the chicken breasts in an attempt to cook them through - so be careful! Err on the side of caution since putting them in the oven continues to cook them. Have made this twice - use the marsala wine if you can find it, but shiraz turns out well, also.

Very good but a bit bland. Also reducing the liquids takes some significant time when the chicken has the chance of drying out a bit much. I added the mushrooms at the last of the reduction to keep them from being mushy. I may reduce earlier in the process, add more salt and a bit more sage as you could not even taste it!

This was very good and not difficult to make. I only used two large chicken breasts so I thought that it would have plenty of sauce, but it still could have used more. Definitely do not use a thickener (like flour), it ends up just fine if you let it reduce on the stove.

I have never had anything like this, and I think it had a great flavor! Some people say they didn't add sage and it was fine, but I think the sage added depth to the sauce that made the dish extra-tasty.

My husband absolutely loves when I cook this dish and it's one of my 'go tos' when I want to make him feel extra special. This is a very easy dish to make and it's gotten better each time I've made it. This time, I made a few changes - hubby doesn't like sage so I substituted oregano to rave reviews - I also did not have any fresh shallots on hand so I used 1 1/2 T dried shallots. The flavor was richer than ever. A winner for marsala fans.

really good - classic - worked well and was much lighter with only 2 T of butter - 1 for the shallots and 1 for sauteeing the chicken. Also used 1/3 c. 1/2 and 1/2 instead of twice as much heavy cream. Will make it again soon (since we now have this bottle of Marsala to use!)

Great recipe. I halved the recipe for a special dinner for two. Instead of putting chicken aside after it was sauted, I cooked it with the sauce.

Not a review, just a suggestion for all those who feel the need to 'thicken' their sauce in this or any other dish with flour or cornstarch. Don't!

After reading the reviews (especially about about how "pan intensive" this recipe is), I doubled the sauce and then cooked what I could in advance. I boiled down the broth and cooked the mushrooms in advance. All that was left was to saute the chicken (which took more than 4 minutes total...don't believe the recipe times!) and combine the sauce. It was truly special. I served it on a big platter over a mound of linguine. It looked great and tasted even better!

A new favourite for entertaining, such a wonderful satisfying meal, followed everything, except, divided the chicken pieces on two platters and poured half the sauce over one before adding the cream to the other half for the second platter. That way those who were either lactose intolerant or watching the calories could relax and enjoy as well... both platters were a hit. I doubled the sauce and even then felt like we could have used more. Made the Caramalized Shallot Mashed potatoes that another reviewer recommended, and the next night we made the leftover potatoes pancakes that were recommended from that review..amazing flavors and huge on the comfort food front! The only prep detail that I added was that I always marinade chicken with some buttermilk, prefferably overnight, that way the chicken meat is always moist and tender, a trick I learned from Nigella Lawson's 'How to Eat'cookbook. Plus the broth I make is from the recipes of Chef Paul Prudhommes' "A Fork in the Road", huge on flavour and health.

I didn't have shallots so I used green onions and garlic. I also doubled the amount of mushrooms which I would highly suggest. I recommend adding extra lemon juice, Parmesan cheese,and fresh chopped Italian parsley at the end to make the sauce tastier, otherwise its a little bland. Also the sauce needs to be cooked a long time to reduce or needs a little flour or cornstarch to thicken it. Next time I will also cook the chicken in the sauce for a few minutes. I served it over linguine with asparagus for a side. Make sure to serve it with some good french bread, dipping the bread in the sauce is the best part.

My husband and toddlers loved this recipe. To make it a little easier, I used 8 already thinly sliced chicken breast, bottled lemon jc and in the future I might even try dried sage. I would definitely make this recipe again.

I made this last night for dinner with Caramelized-Shallot Mashed Potatoes (from this site). I love Chicken Marsala but hate mushrooms (I know it's strange). So I made this without mushrooms. Instead I tripled the shallots. Everything else stayed the same. I did have trouble pounding the chicken breasts, but I think that was just me. My husband had never had Chicken Marsala before and at the first bite he told me I have to make it again. So I guess it was a success!

This was an incredible recipe. The only thing I did differently was added 1 Tbsp of flour at the end of the recipe mixed with some water because the sauce wasn't thick enough. It was restaurant quality!

I made some adjustments to reduce the fat: Cooked shallot and mushrooms in 1 Tsp butter and 1 Tbs olive oil; sauteed chicken in all olive oil; used lowfat milk instead of cream. Served over whole wheat fettuccine. STILL WONDERFUL.

I really enjoyed this dish. I made it for a special dinner for eight people. I got a few compliments. I don't think anyone else loved it as much as I did. I didn't put in the sage and had mashed potatoes as the side dish.

This recipe was absolutely perfect. Each and every ingredient complemented the dish very nicely. The creator of this dish knows a thing or two about integrating flavors. There's a lot of pots and pans to clean up, but I don't care. If a dish is as good as this is, it's well worth it. I plan on cooking this for guests that I want to impress with my cooking skills. KUDOS!!

Excellent flavor, a good weeknight recipe. Followed the recipe very closely except after sauteeing the mushrooms, turned them out into a bowl and used the same pan for the chicken (which I just sliced thin rather than pounding). Also used half and half instead of cream but it still had plenty of body. Hubby loved it!

Rating: 1
I wouldn't make this again because it can't be made ahead and it uses so many pots and pans that the kitchen is a mess and clean-up is a bit of work. It might be worthwhile to study the recipe and see if it could be reorganized to use fewer pots and pans. Additionally, it's got too much cream and butter in it (especially if you double the sauce as recommended by some reviewers) to eat more than once in a great while. It would be good for entertaining, but the host has to cook until the last minute and then hide the pile of dirty pans. It is delicious though.

Is your pan too hot? Try lowering the heat a bit. If you still have the blackened bits, remove the chicken from the pan and return the pan to the burner. Pour in some chicken broth or wine and scrape the bottom with a wooden spoon. Rinse out the pan and you should get rid of the black bits. Now you can proceed with the recipe. Hope this helps.

Rating: 4
Great recipe. Husband loved it. But my problem is - and always is- I used a stainless steel cuisinart pan to cook the chicken and the pan was blackend and required intense scrubbing in addition to smoking out the house. I had to use another pan to cook up the wine, broth and cream otherwise would end up with charred scrapings. What am I doing wrong?

This was wonderful. I increased the mushrooms to 16 oz and the wine by a splash. I also sliced the chicken prior to cooking rather than pounding them. It was a big hit. I'm adding it to the regular rotation.

8 or 9 out of 10. Just over an hour from arriving home to sitting at the table. Next time I will streamline as others to cut prep and cleanup time. Also, I cut my chicken breasts into slices instead of pounding so each person can take the amount of chicken they want. Even with 2 teenage boys, 3 large breasts with angel hair and broccoli easily fed 4 plus one leftover lunch.

Made it for the second time last night and streamlined it a little.

this was pretty good...but after all of the other reviews i feel like maybe something went a little wrong. the taste was good, but the chicken seemed a little greasy/soggy, and for ALL OF THE EFFORT i was a little underwhelmed by the result. however, i am willing to admit that perhaps part of it was me, and perhaps i would try these again...when i had a lot of time and wasn't counting on the results.

Positively fantastic meal that seems like it took hours but was really simple. This is my guys favorite meal and I either serve with the "Roasted Potatoes", also on Epicurious, or mashed red potatoes and asparagus Pay attention to reducing the broth to the correct amount otherwise your sauce will be much too thin (I made that mistake).

Delicious!! I used 1/2 the chicken (and bought cutlets), used one large saucepan for the entire meal, then realized I had no sage--substituted marjoram...and it STILL came out perfect. My husband loved it as did I. Great weeknight meal.

I have made this dish many times and it is always well received. I follow the recipe to the letter (OK maybe a little more wine) but double the sauce. I usually serve it with a baked herbed jasime rice using chicken stock not water (aa easy Martha recipe from one of her first books)

Rating: 4
Fantastic dish. The only alteration was to use milk & cornstarch to thicken as another reviewer suggested (I figured there was more than enough oil and butter in there already). I will make the mushrooms themselves again just for topping steak - they were amazing. But I will make the entire dish again as well. Perfect for serving to guests.

Rating: 4
Simply one of the best recipes i have made from this site. I didn't mess with the original recipe, used a basic marsala wine from the supermarket and it ROCKED. Made once with brown rice as a side, another time with gnocci and tomato sauce. Everyone was dipping bread into the tomato sauce and marsala sauce - simply incredible meal. Make double the sauce - great idea.

I substituted fat free milk for the cream and added a teaspoon of cornstarch to thicken the sauce- and added a splash more wine at the end. It was fabulous

Rating: 4
This was really fantastic. I would however, suggest using a bigger saucepan for the broth. Then later, you can add the mushrooms to the broth instead of the other way around, freeing up this pan to cook the chicken simultaneously while you reduce your sauce. You'll save yourself 5 minutes, and you'll serve your chicken right off the stove instead of fooling with the oven. All in all, great recipe though!

This dish was amazing! I doubled the sauce as others suggested but would prefer the sauce with less cream. I added the chicken back into the pan with the sauce and let that simmer for a few minutes before serving rather than just serving it with the sauce. This is wonderful!

Well I tried this one night as I was experimenting w/ Tiramisu and needed to find something else to do w/ the Marsala wine... Well i found this and it was delicious. I did make one modification, unintentionally... Since i was cooking for myself and one other... I decided to half the recipe, but forgot to do so w/ the wine...so everything else was halved save the wine... and it still turned out delicious. The sauce is even great on steak (which I made today). Definitely easy... and though has a couple different steps... it's certainly easy.

A very good chicken marsala recipe. I substituted fatfree broth, red onion for the shallot, and dried sage. I also increased the wine to 3/4 cup and substituted fatfree half and half for the cream, adding the half and half last and heating just until warmed to prevent clumping. The sauce does not thicken but the fat and calories are significantly reduced and my boyfriend said it was very good, including the sauce.

A great, easy recipe; the flavors were complex yet homey, perfect for a Saturday winter night meal with our family.

This is the second time that I made this recipe. I shortened one step by buying the chicken steaks in the grocery store that are already pounded a lit.

This is one of my favorites. I always make some angel hair pasta and serve over that. Also, I double the sauce! Very delicious!

This dish is "Heaven on a Fork" and I highly recommend preparing it. I've made it four times. After twice making the sauce too liquid, I increased the quantities of mushrooms to 16 oz. and marsala wine to 2/3 cup. I replaced the reduced chicken broth with 1 tsp. of chicken base. This change cuts time by eliminating the chicken broth reduction, but more importantly, makes the recipe come out perfect every time. I think it tastes better, too.

Rating: 3
Excellent recipe, and of course I can not follow a recipe to the "T" without making my own modifications. I pounded out the chicken breasts and sliced them in two pieces. Each piece was cooked and then I topped each one with a piece of eggplant which was breaded and fried, a piece of prosciutto, and finally a piece of provolone and placed under a broiler to melt the cheese and heat through. I increased the amount of wine just a skosh for added flavor.

Rating: 4
This was yummy. A few changes I made. I only had boneless skinless thighs, these are nice and thin already. It's nice to not have to pound the meat and they stay moister than breast meat. Then I followed recipe until sauce time. I didn't have any cream so I substituted a few tablespoons cream cheese. This was great. Gave it a creamy texture and thickened the sauce. I love to use cream cheese in sauces to add a little cream and thicken them at the same time. Only had the cheapie marsala and it was fine although I am sure the better quality wine would have only made the dish even more delicious I served with roasted tomato cous cous and garlic sauteed spinach.

Rating: 4
I didn't think this was all that time-consuming compared to a lot of other things I cook on a regular basis. I was done in 1 hour from the time I got home from the grocery store. I did some streamlining like some other cooks did, using the chicken pan to build the sauce and slicing two breast halves into 2 pieces each rather than pounding. I used the given amount of broth and marsala with wonderful results, though a bit more marsala could only have improved it. I used heavy cream because I had it on hand and needed to use it up, but will use half & half next time to cut a few calories since my sauce was plenty thick. Yummy, this is definitely one for company.

Rating: 3
The chef from CT had it right. The recipe needs more marsala and less broth. Portabella mushrooms add some interesting body, and a touch of cornstarch thickens it, but perhaps that isn't necessary. Another little touch, if you will...if you butterfly the chicken breast, and then re-fold it with a slice of mozarella or other cheese, and maybe a few capers, it retains all of the wonderful features and adds a new dimension to the entre.

this dish was yummy! easy to make for a beginner cook. i halved the chicken but (based on reviews) made all of the sauce, and it was a perfect amount. i did cut the cream in half though. the butter could also be cut in half and not missed. i used a mix of mushrooms from the local farmer's market and they were delicious! i definitely will make this again.

This dish is unbelievable! Absolutely will make it again. I had to use dried sage rather than fresh, but it didn't take away from the taste. I also added minced garlic, which gave the sauce additional flavor. The sauce was so good, I'll make more next time to serve over pasta as well. I didn't find the recipe to be overly time-consuming either. I used breast tenders so that I wouldn't have to pound the chicken breasts which helped reduce the time. It was a hit with my boyfriend. Will make again soon!

Absolutely delicious!! So easy to make and it needs no adjustments. Be sure your chicken is fresh and well tenderized. We pounded out whole breasts flat and did not cut in half. This gave the dish a wonderful platform for the marsala sauce. For those that dont like mushrooms but love marsala, it is just as tasty without the mushrooms.

Great dish. . .I found it to be a bit time consuming, especially for a weeknight. However, my family loved it and I will make it again. I used a little more chicken stock than called for and had a lot of sauce to serve over pasta as well. I also took advice from another review and bought real Marsala wine from the liquor store and I think that's what made the dish so special. The mushrooms were delish!

Rating: 4
This is solid and pretty easy dish to make. A few things to keep it simple are to make the broth reduction and mushroom mixture ahead of time. Buy the already thin sliced chicken breast. (To reduce broth or anything quickly use a wider pot/pan. More surface area means equals quicker reuction.) Also don't buy the cheap Marsla "cooking wine" you find in the grocery and splurge ($10) for the the stuff you buy in the wine or liqure store.

Rating: 4
My boyfriend and I cook together frequently on weekends and this was a one of our recent favorites. As others suggested we added a bit of flour to the sauce to thicken at the end and bought the chicken sliced thin already so no pounding was required. Otherwise, we followed the recipe exactly and though the sauce was absolutely delicious. We served over bowtie pasta. A bit of an indulgence calorie-wise but will definetely make this one again.

A good "starter" dish for the "epicurious" :) It was easy and the directions were simple to follow. I would not change a thing.

This recipe is delicious, but it is time consuming. In an effort to streamline, I used a can of low sodium broth, added a small amount of good bouillon to concentrate the chicken flavor, and skipped the reduction altogether. Using two pans, I cooked the chicken and the shallot/mushroom/sage mixture at the same time and divided the marsala between them to deglaze. I finished the sauce pretty much according to the recipe although I used much less cream than called for and did not reduce the sauce very much. It was not thick but seemed fine, and there was certainly an adequate quantity.

would double stock as not enough sauce for my taste. Replaced Sage with Rosemary. Great with Bruschetta.

After reading the chef's comments, (about not enough sauce) I made these changes. I doubled the stock and reduced it about 30 minutes. I followed the rest of the sauce recipe so I was left with a thin sauce. I took 2 Tablespoons of butter and heated it and whisked in 2 Tablespoons of flour to make a roux. Cooked it 2 minutes, then added it to the sauce and cooked for 4 more minutes. I don't like a really heavy, creamy sauce, so it was lighter, and since some chef's said there wasn't enough sauce for the dish, this solved the problem. I was pleased with the outcome making the sauce this way. By the way you can cook the chicken and make the sauce seperately the day before then heat the sauce and pour over heated chicken on the say of the party.

This is such good Marsala, it's difficult to beat. As with most Epicurious recipes, though, I'd have to say it does not provide anywhere near enough sauce (though that's not a reason to downgrade this to three forks). It's also very simple to make, a good weeknight dinner.

Keeper, keeper! Used crimini mushrooms, dry marsala (answering one reviewers question); be sure to add the lemon. You can prep alot of the ingredients ahead of time. Don't add cornstarch or flour if the sauce is too thin; just cook it longer.

I would certainly love the recipes of the people who've given this negative feedback! This was the best Chicken Marsala I've had....best recipe, better than any resturaunt. You certainly need to stay with the low sodium broth and unsalted butter. I used breast like the recipe asks for this time, but next time I'll use thighs since I prefer dark meat and I know it will be even better. I'll just chop up the meat and stir fry it for a few minutes. Creamed spinich was great side as was brocolli.

Rating: 1
I found this recipe to be very bland and disappointing...and requiring a lot of unnecessary pots and pans. I will go back to my own way of making this dish which requires letting the chicken breasts sit for 10 minutes in the flavor of a freshly squeezed lemon - then drying them before breading and sauteing. I also add more herbs, lemon and salt to the sauce...making it a half marsala/half piccata sauce.

I am truly shocked that the foood snobs aren't all over this recipe - debating the very essence of the "chicken marsala" It's usually Italian dishes that get the "know-it-alls" out in force because the recipe is "not how my Italian Grandmother made it," or that "it can't be Marsala without mushrooms." Patiently waiting . . .

Enjoyed this recipe, tasted good, easy to make, sauce did need to be thickened though, will be making again.

This dish was so flavorful and rich. The pounded chicken breasts were so tender. I used brown mushrooms which must have been the cause of the sauce looking kind of....brown! I do agree about adding a bit of cornstarch as the sauce was a bit thin.

My parents,who dislikes chicken breast and cream sauces,loved this recipe. They've already asked if I'll be making it again sometime soon. The only change I had to make was adding cornstarch to the sauce at the end. The sauce was very watery and needed it.

I'm afraid I was rather disappointed by this recipe. While the sauce was tasty, it wasn't thick enough to add flavor. Perhaps I should have cooked the sauce longer. I do agree, however, this is an easy, inexpensive recipe.

I served this dish to my in-laws, aiming to impress. It worked! This dish is delicious, but not hard to do, especially if you make your spouse help you! We had to use Sherry instead of Marsala and it turned out great, can't wait to make it the right way next time!

Agoura - I haven't made this yet, but my guess on wiping out the pan is to prevent burning of the butter (?).

Excellent! I made this for our anniversary dinner, as it was on the menu for our reception. Surprisingly, my husband remembered. I used 1/2 & 1/2 in place of full cream to save on calories, and thickened the sauce with approximately 1/2 teaspoon of Wondra.

I made this for our anniversary, as it was on the menu for our reception. Even more of a surprise is that my husband remembered! Cast my vote along with the others - this dish is superb! I used 1/2 & 1/2 to cut calories a little, and thickened the sauce with maybe 1/2 teaspoon of Wondra flour. Excellent! I will make again, and take another reviewers suggestion of using morels.

Wonderfully, delicious recipe. Not difficult, and tastes like a restaurant dish. Family loved it. I didn't quite understand the wiping out of the pan before cooking the rest of the chicken. I needed to add more oil and butter, unless that is what the recipe means for us to do. Any comments?

I made this the first time for guests and everyone left with a copy of the recipe. It's delicious and easy. I didn't have Marsala wine so I subbed sherry and it worked great. Will definately make this dish again...and again...

This was an incredible dish! The flavors were in perfect harmony. I used fresh morels which I am sure made it taste even more delicious. People will think you are a true gourmet cook with this one!

This is an absolutely delicious dish which I served with egg noodles and fresh asparagus. I will serve it to dinner guests very soon; it's that good!
