Do we need this recipe? This is the most basic brownie recipe on the planet. I have been making a recipe exactly like this one forever. There is nothing wrong with it, but it is not exactly cutting edge baking. Save my time for the new and exciting stuff.

Great! Easy to make and very yummy. They were quite rich, though, I'll definately serve them with some ice cream next time to cut down on the richness. Other than that, they were excellent!

Why do Sheila Lukins' recipes continue to be posted on this site? They are not often reviewed, and even more rarely well-reviewed. This has just always struck me as curious.

being an American living in Switzerland one has to learn to modify and adjust the excellent local ingredients -- some recipes are more successful than others.....this recipe worked and I would definetly make it again. Our Swiss chocolate simply make them irrestible. Bon Appetit

I have to agree with a previous reviewer: they are better from the box. The texture was off and they were too rich by themselves. Maybe they would be better topped with vanilla ice cream or something to cut the richness.

Where did I go wrong - these were sugary and not very chocolatey???

These brownies were some of the best I've ever had. Instead of walnuts, I used 1/4 cup of ground almond, it added a really nice flavour. If I were to make these again, I would add some grated lemon peel and lemon juice to add a little zip.

I hate to say it, but out of the box are better.

Absolutely Fabulous! Easy and delicious, a real winner. Make these for family, bake sale, gifts - you can't go wrong.

I am not much of a baker but decided real homemade brownies would be fun to make. There were so many recipes to choose from so I finally just picked one that seemed quick and easy. These brownies turned out fabulous! My family loved them, especially right out of the oven. I added small chunks of caramels to the batter....adding half the batter, then the caramels, then the rest of the batter. When the brownies were done, I drizzled some melted caramels over the top. I would recommend if you add the caramels, make sure they dont sink to the bottom...they tended to make the brownies stick to the foil. But overall..these were the best brownies I have had in a long time!!!
