i'm surprised no one commented on the spice rub. i found it confusing. "we use a combination of equal parts cumin and coriander, half that amount of salt ..." half of what amount? the combined cumin and coriander? i assume it means 1 part cumin, 1 part coriander, 1/2 part salt, 1/2 part pepper, 1/8 part clove. well that's what i'm using tonight Read More http://www.epicurious.com:80/recipes/food/views/Spice-Rubbed-Steak-with-Quick-Garlic-Fries-234266#ixzz1s2fkatyP

Dear phattjoy from Tillamook County, Oregon, Im sorry you felt my comments crappy and ruining the community pot as you put it, I was simply try to educate you, That these are not ( Frites ) as suggested in the original reviewers comments... And If you actually looked into " Frites " / The One and Only Belgian Fries... they even have a website , Maybe you'd understand... Quote : high time time for a (simple) definition of what makes fries Belgian Fries: Freshly cut, irregularly shaped... Cooked (fried) twice... Fluffy on the inside, Crispy on the outside... A distinct potato taste... At least 10 mm thick... Preferably served in a paper cone... If 1 of these characteristics is absent, please do not use the term Belgian Fries / " Frites ", just call them fries (or French fries if you prefer).

While I love and often cook my steaks using this method... Call me a fries snob but frozen fries are what they are.. Real "frites" or Belgian fries are amazing ... Fresh peeled potatoes cooked twice. Once at a lower temp. (approx. 320*) about 4 minutes then laid out to cool for about a half hour then cooked again at a higher temp. (approx. 365*) untill golden brown... resulting in fries that are soft inside and crispy on the outside... Seriously try them but Warning you might turn into a fries snob too...

I wish I'd followed another reviewer's suggestion to fry the garlic with the potatoes, but I couldn't figure out how to do that, given that they need to be cooked in two batches. They didn't pick up much garlic flavor from being tossed with the garlic afterward. Still, it smelled great, and the entire yummy meal was ready in about 15 minutes. I used the rub in the recipe, which is good, and served the steaks in thin slices. Yes, this is quick and easy and uses a short-cut ingredient, but thank goodness for good ideas like this one that a person can actually execute on a weeknight!

Made this over Memorial Day weekend while renting a cabin. Wanted easy to make recipes with a minimum of ingredients. This certainly fit the bill. Rather than the fries, which got added to another meal, we cooked up some leftover bacon, put aside. Then used the grease to fry up some apples and onions. Drained well, then reincorporated the crumble up bacon. With the spiciness of the rub, the sweetness of the apples and onions, the saltiness of the bacon. It just worked. But at the end of the day, it's a different recipe :)

I am an experienced cook and I still like to make something simple once in a while. This is it! I wondered why you put the garlic in the oil after you cooked the potatoes. I put it in with the potatoes after about 5 minutes. Delicious!

I can't wait to try this recipe. It looks simple and delicious. To the other cook from Canada -- they are called FRIES, not BAKES!

What I love about this site is the review process by other readers. More power to "nirvrush from AusTex" - nothing like the crappy comments of a cooking snob to ruin the community pot. This recipe is simple, uses easy-to-find ingredients and is fast to prepare vs. starting all from scratch. And it is tasty. What the hell is not to like about that? I like both kinds of recipes - easy and complicated. I love a culinary challenge but also like easy meals that don't take forever to prepare or fuss over. If you don't like the way a recipe reads don't make it. So, in the spirit of spreading the good vibe, more power to Epicurious for having the nerve to dare to put such a non-complicated "cheater" recipe on their web site.

I think people forget that not everyone is an advanced cook. Something like this is simple enough for a beginner, and tasty enough to serve to a friend coming over for dinner. You don't have to have a Cordon Bleu degree to have an interest in cooking. If these recipes are too "easy," then move on to something a little more challenging; there's no need to rip a recipe to shreds just because it's not complicated enough.

You fry garlic then toss them with the fries and suddenly they're garlic fries? I think not. And why are the fries being fried in oil anyway? They probably already were at the factory. Might be easier on the arteries to bake them...

Yes, I needed this recipe! Today's barbecue is rained out and I never finished a steak in the oven before. Thanks, Epicurious
