So simple - so good. As usual, I cut the sugar in half (didn't miss it) and used only 1/2 c currants (vs raisins) and 1/2 c nuts. With 12 slices, this dropped calories and carbs 20% and fat 33% -- with the end product no less satisfying. With simple changes like these, we can change our diet and improve our enjoyment!

This is very easy to make. The crumb of the bread itself doesn't have a ton of flavor, but it provides a very nice vehicle for raisins and walnuts, which I love. Sliced thick and slathered with butter, it makes for a lovely breakfast.

My 5 1/2 year old and I just made this bread on Thanksgiving morning. What a treat, we all enjoyed the wonderful rich flavor. So easy to make too.

I'm going to substitute 1 1/2 c. spelt flour and 1/2 c. cornmeal for the wholewheat flour. Also, I think using a bainmarie method or even a canning kettle with rack, and using pint jars will produce a neat little cylinder bread.

Wonderful. A perfect starter recipe for friends who have never made bread, no mixer, no processor, no bread machine, no yeast to proof. Assemble in about five minutes put in the over and wait for it to finish. So darn good too.

I love brown bread and this was a very simple and delicious recipe. I love being able to make this bread without spending all day doing it.

This is a very flavorful and satisfying bread. Find it a great plus that is contains no eggs and no oil. The rye flour gives it the texture found in many European breads. A winner!
