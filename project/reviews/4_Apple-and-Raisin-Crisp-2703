Awesome recipe! I have been making for years. Made it today, omitted the nuts, soaked the raisins in hot water and used brown sugar in place of the white sugar in the apples.

I made this exactly as directed with 2 exceptions because I had really tart apples off a friend's tree. I didn't add the raisins because my family doesn't care for them cooked, and I substitued sliced almonds. Because I had such tart apples, I needed all of the sugar. It came out beautifully with a wonderful tart/sweet flavor. I think it was even better the next day when I had it cold for breakfast. I gave it 3 stars because it was really good but not outstanding/exceptional. I would definitely make it again.

Reduced sugar in topping to 3/4 cup and reduced butter to 1/2 cup (1 stick). Next time will macerate raisins in hot apple juice. Hubby still loved it and he is really picky. Good basic recipe.

Gave recipe full marks. Only used 1/2c sugar for topping and 1Tbsp of vanilla sugar in filling. Reduced quantity of raisin to 1/2c with addition of 1/4c dried cranberry. 1/2tsp of cinnamon - real, to both filling and topping. In filling, added pinches of clove, allspice and 1/4tsp ginger. Used 1/2c walnuts in topping. Oh lastly, less salt. About 1/4tsp. While it does not seem at all like recipe? It is; because most of the proportions, so necessary in deserts, are similar. Regardless, this recipe is the nearest I've found to Granny's. Delicious!!

This was delicious. I didn't add nuts because not a huge fan but really enjoyed this dessert. I added about 1/4tsp cinnamon to both topping and filling. I didn't quite use a full 1/2 cup sugar in the filling. Liked the raisins, would try it with dried cranberries too or just apples.

Definite crowd pleaser! I skipped the raisins and used granny smith apples as recommended. It was hard to stop eating this delicious dessert. Even my mother who isn't one for desserts loved it! Next time I might reduce the sugar in the apples a tad, but it's great just the way it is!

I have made this recipe many times, always with rave reviews. I have only one recommendation. Know your apples. You need to use a tart apple for this to be a success. Red or golden delicious apples or any other sweet apple would make this a very sweet dessert, too sweet for my taste. I also measure my apples after they are peeled and cored to make sure my pan is filled to the top. I almost never leave a recipe alone but this one is perfect as written. Enjoy!

Yuk-way too much sugar. Topping was also too dry. If you make it, half the sugar and use a smalller pan and dot the top with butter. But I wouldn't make it again.

This is great! I made it exactly as the recipe stated, although I was a little hesitant when I read the amount of butter it called for. But hey - I put the full stick and a half in and it was delicious.

I loved this recipe, I thought it was great! I added more cinnamon to both, the topping and the apples. I prefer using Golden Ds for apples instead of the Granny. Personal preference. With the Goldens it comes out with a smooth traditional apple taste, with the Grannies it adds a bit of tartness. I didn't have walnuts so I used pecans instead. It worked just fine. Recipe totally recommended.

This review is for the topping only... I used the apple/cranberry crisp recipe for the filling (delicious and beautiful with red). I thought the topping had WAY too much butter, it was too rich altho very tasty. Next time I will halve the butter. Don't be afraid to add more cinnamon :)

I don't eat wheat flour so I substituted for rice flour and doubled the cinnamon. I made this dish for a birthday celebration and had rave reviews. A few people asked for the recipe. It was delicious!

I have made this recipe twice now - once with raisins and once without. It's a great flexible recipe. The topping is the best I have ever tasted in a crisp. Will definitely make this again. The family raves over it.

This is my favorite apple crisp recipe. I had misplaced it and just found it and I can't wait to make it again!

This is a very yummy apple crisp! Do not hesitate to make this and do not hesitate to substitute some items - pecans/walnuts or raisins/dried cranberries, etc. What I like best is the little bit of flour in the apple mixture as it gives it a pie-like filling. So quick and so delicious!

This was really good, not fantastic. I ommited the raisins and cut the white sugar by 1/4th. I got rave reviews from friends, and it served a lot of people as a little went a long way over vanilla ice cream. I'm still searching for a better apple crisp recipe but might use this one again for it's quick simplicity. Great for a cold night with the family!

I make this with dried cranberries instead of raisins. It is soooo good, I get requests from my office to make this for every office party.

Excellent recipe. I tried this with cranberries instead of raisins and another time with apples alone and those options were great as well. This dish quickly disappeared when I made it for friends at school.

I cut out the white sugar in the filling, and used pecans instead of apples in the topping. I made a third of the recipe in a small oval baking dish for my husband and me, and it was perfect--I'm not an apple crisp fan, but this will be my standard recipe.

Rating: 2
I agree with the others--way too sweet. If I were to make it again, I'd omit the raisins. But there are probably better apple crisp recipes I'd try before making this one again.

I found this recipe good, except too much sugar. I will use my old recipe which isn't so sweet.

This recipe was very very gooood - I added walnuts to the topping and filling.

Very good. I will cut down on the sugar next time as the raisins are already quite sweet. I made a half portion and baked it for only 30 minutes.

An excellent and quick dessert! wonderful with vanilla ice cream and even tastes good the next day (if you have any left over)! Presentable for guests

I added a little more cinnamon, and a teaspoon of nutmeg. This was excellent!
