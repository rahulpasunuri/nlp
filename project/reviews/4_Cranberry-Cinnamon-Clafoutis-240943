Started off with a crepe batter with sugar that kept on sticking to the skillet so I decided to make a clafoutis with it instead, but didn't have cranberries. Put in apricots and almonds instead with cognac, and grand marnier. Added a little more sugar and broiled the top. Served with whipped cream.

This dessert is quick and easy to put together. The flavors are excellent. If you're thinking about making this ahead -- don't! I made this the evening before Thanksgiving and thought I could rewarm it in the oven. Fortunately, I tasted it that evening and it was delicious. When I rewarmed it the next day, the flavor was still good, but the texture was never right - light and airy the previous evening, soggy and dense the next day.

Fantastic. Used equal parts dried cranberries and dried cherries. The ease of the recipe is an added bonus.

I've made fresh fruit clafoutis before but the depth of flavor from the fruit in this really elevated the entire dessert from an okay custardy thing to a very impressive and delicious dessert. I used brandy and stuck to the recipe. Thanks, Maggie!

Loved it, will definitely make it again. Substitutions based on what I had on hand: * half fresh cranberries and half dried cherries. * Had no hard booze, so I used dry Marsala in lieu of both prescribed ingredients. * vanilla pod seeds instead of extract I've made a lot of clafoutis before, so I knew it would work even with the changes.

Great dessert! Light and Fluff. Next time I will make it with figs instead. Easy to make and very good results.
