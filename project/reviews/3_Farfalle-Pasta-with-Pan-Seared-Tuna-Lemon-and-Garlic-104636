A tasty and quick dinner with modifications.

Very good. I used the whole 1-pound box of pasta, so it needed extra tuna (almost twice as much as the recipe calls for) to help it be a main dish. I also used mini-pasta, which I think absorbs the flavor better. Yes, it needs more flavor so adding more olives, lemon and some chopped red onion helped a lot. Pepper helped too. I didn't use cooking water and instead used extra olive oil.

This is a keeper. Was just wonderful. The flavor was nice and fresh. I added white wine instead of pasta water. Made it a little richer. I also added more olives. I will make this again for guests it's a winner 10/27/08

With the addition of extra olives and marinated artichoke hearts, this was an okay meal, but I won't make it again.

Even my picky eaters liked this one! I don't like kalamata olives, so I used a mixture of black and green stuffed olives, adding much more than called for. I also did not cook the tuna in the oven as long as stated (only about 3 minutes) Easy and light!

This was really wierd... the lemon and olive combo was a little too stringent- I would not make it again.

I quadrupled the tuna, just used a box of rotini, and added a lot extra of the other ingredients. Very tasty and when made with the Barilla plus pasta it's weight watchers friendly!

I've now made this twice and the second time was much better. Definitely double the olives as well as the lemon peel. If you're going to cook the tuna to the degree that the recipe says, you may as well use canned tuna and save some money -- it would still be good. I cooked the tuna to medium rare and it still flaked and was wonderful.

I loved this dish, although made some modifications. There was no fresh fish in the apartment (nor could my wallet manage it) so I used 2 cans of tuna packed in oil, and I drained some of the tuna oil into the pan with the olive oil. To add some color I halved cherry tomatoes and threw them in at the end with everything else, including the tuna straight from the can. Using canned tuna took away yet another step of this already easy recipe and the flavor was still delicious! I also upped the chili flakes and just used a small can of sliced olives for ease of prepartion. I'll definately make this again.

I added the extra olives as some suggested and found this recipe to be "okay". It looked appealing, taste was lacking "salt"? Otherwise it was fairly well received by my guests. Would I make it again? I will pass this one on by.

This was good, and tasted healthful. I did feel it was a bit dry. If I make it again, I would increase the olives.

i liked this and made it several hours ahead on a very hot summer day--by the time our friends were to arrive for dinner i found it necessary to continue to add the reserved liquid to which i added a bit more oil and lemon juice. the flavor was fine but without changing the recipe too much i couldn't figure out what to add to jazz up the rather bland appearance. probably should simply toss pasta and liquids, then leave the other ingredients on top and toss at table. definitely plan on more slivered olives.

My husband and I both thought this was absolutely delicious. I thought the part about adding water sounded weird, so I just sauteed the garlic in a little extra oil and used that as the sauce, and it was yummy. Next time I would also add more olives (who came up with the number 10 anyhow??)

Big points for being low fat and true to traditional italian concepts. Not to be a food snob, but I have to disagree with the reviewers who added cheese (parmesan & fetta) to this. Any pasta dish with fish- skip the cheese. Also, sticking more and more 'meditteranean' ingredients in doesn't make something more traditional, just messy! I appreciated the simple balanced flavour in this- now that's meditteranean!

I have made this recipe a few times now and find it very tasty with either tuna or salmon. I have taken the advice of other reviewers and added more red pepper flakes, more garlic, thinly sliced red onion, capers instead of olives, eliminated the water and increased the olive oil. Guests have loved this dish and it's pretty easy to make, especially if you do your chopping and measuring before guests arrive. Leftovers are even better!

We used two 6 OZ fillets of salmon, grilled on one of those George Foreman grills, and flaked that into the pasta instead. Fantastic! We also added a bit more olive oil, another 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes, and only used 3/4 lb. of pasta. We did use the pasta water - it's a great trick. We didn't marinate the salmon at all - just a quick shot of salt and pepper before the grill.

We loved this dish...with a few modifications. I took suggestions from other reviewers and added a small jar of marinated artichoke hearts, drained, some thin vertically sliced red onion (raw), increased the amount of olive oil and lemon juice slightly and I also added some feta cheese (2 ounces) in keeping with the Mediterranean theme of the dish. I think the secret is very good quality olive oil and seasoning the tuna well prior to searing. Also, I did not bake for 10 minutes, rather only 4-5 minutes for rare tuna. I would rather add the extra ingredients and increase the fat and calories so that I can eat a small portion of something delicious instead of a large portion of a so-so dish. I will be making this again!

Some of my guests complained that it was too lemony. Overall I thought it was just ok and actually a bit on the bland side. I ended up adding a little balsamic vinegar, roasted peppers, chopped tomatoes and parmesan to the leftovers. That was a treat!!

I made this with grilled chicken slices and it was very good and healthy, although a little bland, but after I put some garlic salt and some more red pepper flakes it was perfect. Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top is also good. It's not special enough to serve for guests, but I will definetely make it again for weeknight dinners because it's low fat. Next time I will try it with tuna and add an extra garlic clove and more salt.

Seeing these reviews, I wasn't expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was tasty. The lemon juice gave it a light fresh taste, and the red pepper flakes gave it a nice kick. I added a bit of fresh thyme and some marinated artichoke hearts.

Can't understand why many don't like this one - when the tuna is really seared before roasting, it has a great smoky taste. Bump up the hot pepper flakes to half a teaspoon. And above all, no reserve cooking liquid to moisturize! This is a terrible idea. Water in a pasta - be low fat somewhere else! Instead, start out with 4 tbsp of olive oil, not just a silly 3 teaspoons, and use a bit more lemon juice. Mine was moist enough. Plus, as I didn't have olives, I used capers - a good substitution.

Again, it was too bland and needed more "umph". To compensate,I ended up adding more olive oil and olives which defeated my initial interest in doing something low-fat. I'd make it again but add artichokes as the other reviewer suggested.

my teenage boys liked this. I put the grated lemon on the side because my younger son doesnt like it.

I liked the concept of the recipe, but it need some punch. I cooked the tuna and pasta the way the recipe specified - but I added some to the oil and garlic before mixing it up. First, more garlic and oil, then capers, jar of marinated artichoke hearts, sun dried tomatoes, basil, oregano and some sliced onion. Use your discretion with amounts depending on what you like. Then toss everything together and eat.

This recipe is hoo hum.. it doesn't have any punch to it, and the flavor is kinda bland. I won't make it again, fresh tuna is rare and rather expensive around my area.
