I modified the recipe, using honeydew melon rather than cantelope, and that is perhaps why I had a problem. Almost immediately liquid accumulated on the plate such that it looked unappetizing and it tasted bland, even with the basil sauce. So, don't try this with honeydew melons.

Soooo good! I made smaller brochettes, with one melon ball, prosciutto ruffle, and small moz ball per stick. Everything else followed the recipe. Just a refreshing, nice appetizer. Really yummy; loved the basil oil.

A great summer recipe. I used a melon baller for the cantaloupe. Pictues of how mine came out are here: http://www.jessica-thebookcook.com/2012/05/everything-is-better-on-stick-tomato.html

GREAT recipe. The drizzle really makes this recipe special. I bought deli prosciutto that I had sliced a little thicker than the packaged kind. You could 'ball' the melon for a uniform appearance.

I cut the olive oil to 1/4 cup and increased the basil to half a cup. I also added two squeezes of fresh lemon and some salt to the dressing which freshened it up nicely.

Perfect hot weather appetizer. I cut back the shallot as suggested and was glad that I did. The initial taste seemed shallot heavy, but I tasted it again 30 minutes later (when guests arrived) and the flavors had married well. It really brought the dish together.

i love the simplicity of this recipe. it worked well as an elegant and delicious appetizer for a summer dinner party. i definitely agree with some of the other comments to cut down on the olive oil.

I live in England and I friend referred me to this site. This is a great starter, I amended the dressing as suggested by cutting the oil and shollot quantities and adding some honey, lime and salt. A delicious light starter I served it with homemade ciabatta

Very simple but tasty. The dressing was key to bringing it all together. I used long toothpicks with one of each ingredient so it would be a little more manageable as finger food.

i actually prefer honeydew to cantaloupe for this recipe...think it goes better with prosciutto. i also limit 1 instance of each ingredient per skewer as it gets to be too large a bite otherwise. if i don't have time to prepare the pesto, i just introduce fresh basil leaves to the skewer (between the mozzarella and prosciutto) and add cracked black pepper.

Lovely, delicious appetizer. Good prosciutto, good fresh mozzarella and ripe melon are essential. Definitely go to the trouble of making the pesto...it makes this dish...it is so fresh and flavorful. Cut the shallot in half. Use large toothpicks...just the right size to eat without being awkward. A real hit !

Yum. Elegant picnic food. Got rave reviews from our guests. Only because my basil was bitter, I had to add other fresh ingredients until a good taste was developed (lemon, tarragon, cilantro, salt & pepper, pecorino cheese). Next time, why not just use bottled pesto like another reviewer did!! Also skewered with cherry tomatos for color & taste. Highly recommended.

I'm surprised no one mentioned cherry tomatoes for color interest. I skewer some mozz balls with cantaloupe balls, some with grape tomatoes, some with both on cocktail picks for a mix-and-match variety. Classic prosciutto/melon and salad Caprese all in one. They are gone in minutes. Lots of dressing which I use on salads later in the week or drizzle on plates for flair.

I made these into tasty bite-sized hors d'oeuvres (small melon ball, prosciutto and bocconcini) and used a generous dollop of homemade basil thinned with some high-quality lemon-infused olive oil as the drizzle. Two dozen were inhaled in less than 10 minutes by 8 gals at a shower. Simple, make-ahead, beautiful and delicious -- these will definitely get a workout at future get-togethers, both casual and more formal.

The dressing makes this dish a star. It is worth keeping for its simplicity. I have made triple quantities of the dressing.... perfect for a fresh tomato and onion salad. I should add the presentation also a winner, I too used the long toothpicks, easier to handle. THANK YOU for adding this to the site.

This was quite good - nice presentation and tasty but I had to cut WAY back on the shallots. I made the sauce first as written but had to toss it - overpowering shallot taste. After I re-made it with much less shallot it was delicious.

These little brochettes looked lovely but weren't fantastic! I used honeydew instead of cantaloupe and that worked well. The pesto sauce was time consuming (skip the feta) and it was thicker than I thought it would be so I soaked the mozzarella in it before making the brochettes.

Loved them! Served them at a bridal shower as pre-lunch appetizer - pretty to look at and easy to make ahead. Substituted Cherry bocconcini for the buffalo mozzarella - looked very nice! Need to ensure you have ripe melon for best flavour.

Wow--This was fabulous! These are so pretty and fresh-tasting (and the first to go at my party). The sauce is a must--to which I added salt and pepper. I used 4" decorative toothpicks, I made the cataloupe into small balls, and the mozzarella into 3/4" cubes. I highly recommend this one!

Made lots of bite size servings for a party. Very good and really pretty. I did not, however, care for the dressing/sauce and did not use it. It was really harsh tasting due to the shallot. Instead, I grabbed some homemade pesto from the freezer and mixed some with very good olive oil. I drizzled that over the hors d'oeurves. I saved the other dressing and added some mustard and balsalmic vinegar for use in salads. Overall, very yummy.

As I preferred to serve this as a small bite size appetizer, I only used one piece of melon, one serving of prosciutto, and one piece of cheese (used small marinated mozzarella balls from Costco). Used regular size shish kabob skewers which made a very elegant presentation. Delicious and very easy to make!

Tasty, elegant and beautiful. I made it last weekend for a party, and plan to make it again this week for another get-together. I used the long toothpick suggestion and served it with kalamata olives on the side. Definitely a keeper!

This was very good. I was dubious about the mozzarella, but I thought it worked well together. If you can, try to use charentais melons, the little french melons similar to the Carpentras melons in Provence. Ooh la la. Even those French food references are unable to assuage my sense of shame from only "assembling", not "creating". Thanks Gotham for adding what must be your typical dose of sunshine to the forum.

This was great: simple and elegant. However, it was not so much "creating," as it was merely "assembling." So, for those of you who brought this to your last bridge social or tailgate party, and are feeling all puffed up because people praised you for your culinary prowess - remember, all you've done is steal this idea from a magazine or website, and then simply "shopped and skewered."

I have been making Prosciutto e Melone since I was introduced to it back in Treviso, Italy. I used toothpicks instead of skewers and layered one chunk of cantelope, a piece of fontina cheese, and prosciutto. Buy the highest quality of proscuitto you can find for this recipe. A wonderful and very impressive appetizer. Buonissimo!!

Also really good with honeydew melon instead of cantalope; a great flavor with the prosciutto.

Simple and tasty, what's not to like? Thanks to the cook from Santa Rosa who suggested to cut the oil back, the basil taste was more intense with about a 1/3 cup instead of a 1/2. And thanks to the cook from New York who suggested salad form. Made this with a bed of baby greens and nectarines (no melon in the house) and was thrilled with the added punch for the first course salad. For a brochette, I prefer just one melon, mozz, and prosciutto on a smaller toothpick, as 8" worth prove a bit much. Over all, great recipe and helpful comments.

A really elegant and tasty beginning to a meal. Using the best quality ingredients is the most important thing to remember, as each item potentially stands alone on the palate. I cut back on the amount of olive oil, and got a more intense flavor for the sauce.

It's a great recipe, and the sauce is my new most favorite staple in my frige. I use the sauce as a spread on sandwiches, in salad dressings and on meats and pasta. The freshness of the basil and shallot vs. the traditional pesto with cheese and garlic is a wonderful,light new approach to the basil that we all love. For the appetizer, I do half the skewers with just melon and mozzarella, which with the wonderful sauce, has gotten raves from my vegetarian friends.

I also loved the recipe. I zipped it up a little by drizzling it with a balsamic syrup.

Rating: 4
We, too, scaled down the size so that each piece was enough for one mouthful. Used bamboo skewers/tooth picks 3 inches long. The sauce was more than enough for double the recipe. This might be because I cut the portion size or because I only drizzled the sauce like in the picture. Don't know. It's a great sauce and it will not go to waste!! Used the extra in tomato sauce the next day. It would also be great as a base for a viniagrette. We will definitely make this one again. When melon season ends, I'm going to add garlic to the sauce and substitute a calamata olive for the melon.

Awesome! Instead of making the basil/shallot oil, I used a tablespoon of homemade pesto and thinned it with a couple of tablespoons of olive oil (1/2 cup of olive oil as called for in the recipe is far too much for this appetizer).

This was a very good recipe. I did take the suggestion of one of the reviews and made the portions smaller.

I've never posted before but had too - this was fabulous and beautiful. Only issue my guests had was difficulty in eating due to the size so I changed one thing when I made it the second time - I took metal olive picks and used a small piece of melon, small piece of mozzarella and then the proscuitto. Easy to eat and the olive picks jazzed it up more than the toothpicks!

This was a wonderful course that I sandwiched between two spicier courses at an evening wine tasting. The salty prociutto complemented the melon very well (I used honeydew instead) and the basil oil topped it off! I paired it with a light Pinot Grigio so that the flavors in the dish were the main focus. Fantastic!

I turned this is recipe into an elegant first course, rather than using the skewers. I lined the outer rim of a salad plate with cucumber rounds, halved. Inside that layer, I placed six thin rounds of the cheese, then mounded small chunks of cantaloupe in the center. I garnished with the ham cut cross-wise into thin slices and drizzles of pesto. It created a delicious and very pretty floral design. Definitely a keeper!

Rating: 3
Wonderful recipe -- but it is best when the melon, cheese and prosciutto can be eaten together, The flavor combination is incredible. Unfortunately, I made the melon and cheese pieces too large -- and my guests had to eat each part individuaolly. I would recommend putting smaller sections on the skewer -- so it can be eaten all together
