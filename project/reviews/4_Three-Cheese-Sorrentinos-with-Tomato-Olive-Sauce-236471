This was even better when I made my own raviolis from scratch. If you are up for the extra work/reward, check out this ravioli recipe - http://goo.gl/OJCJy

This is one of the few recipes I didn't change much. What a great dish! I did use pesto instead of the basil, and I used a green olive mix instead of the fresh olives. But apart from that, it was a near perfect meal.

The ravioli filling is so delicious. The shallot is a must to add that hint of sweetness. I had some trouble with the won ton wrappers. There was an excess of dough. I think I will trim or make the pasta next time. Sauteeing in butter seemed an unnecessary step. I thought the sauce was good but the olive's overwhelmed the delicate flavors of the ravioli.

The caterer who wrote in about the sauce was dead on. It is super easy to make, turns out delicious with a bit of a spicy kick. These "ravioli" were also great. The combination of cheeses makes for a melty magnificence! Make sure to cook them in a large enough pot to prevent them from sticking to each other.

I am a caterer and have used this sauce 1000 times over. It's a great sauce for both pastas and chicken.
