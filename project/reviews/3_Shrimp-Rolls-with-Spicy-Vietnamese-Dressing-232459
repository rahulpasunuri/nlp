i thought this dish was very good, especially the dipping sauce.i thought 1 cup of sugar/splenda would be too much so i used 1/2 cup sugar and ten packets of splenda and it was just right. the lime flavor came right through. the only negative was difficulty in keeping everything in the lettuce leaf so we wound up eating the componants sepertely. i would make this again.

The dressing was too sweet for my taste. We enjoyed this recipe, but probably won't make again.

These were great! We especially loved the marinade. I wouldn't change anything. We served them with sticky rice and it was so tasty and healthy! I just poured the "dipping sauce" right on my wrap as I was building it - pretty messy, but worth the extra napkins!

We love this recipe and make it often. It's light and fresh flavor is great for a spring/summer dinner and it's pretty simple.
