I made this in about an hour while also preparing a full meal. This is a great classic recipe! So easy to make. I wish there were better ways to spice it up though.

So simple yet so delicious. Has become a New Year's Day brunch tradition at our house.

All through the making, I was very unconvinced that these would actually turn out. I should not have worried; these are the best potato pancakes. So light, with good texture and not greasy at all. Everyone loved them and asked for the recipe.

Some of the best latkes I have ever made. I used matzah meal as many people recommended. I added an extra egg and another two tablespoons of matzah meal since the potatoes seemed to need more binding. Very crisp and they reheated for serving very well.

I used Yukon Golds and they came out perfect and disappeared quickly. I was very happy with the result.

Cooked the recipes as is, used the Crisco as one reviewer suggested and they came out perfect! They were wonderfully crisp!

Of course my Mom's are the best! But these are terrific - made a second batch with potatoes and apples - also excellent combining the sweet & savory flavors. Perfect flavors and texture

Taste is delicious, but I had to add another egg to get ingredients to stick together better. Wishing I had a gas stove, as I think the electric one caused uneven heating of pan and - therfore - uneven frying.

Classic is classic but I top off my crispy latkes -matzo meal and the potato starch - with a dollop of creme fraiche and a spoon of salmon roe.

Very similar to my own version - something I devised from watching many a good Jewish cook. My own suggestions which I am willing to share are: I use Yukon Gold potatoes - they just add a creamy consistence. The other tip is frying in Crisco - stays hot and makes for better frying. Happy Chanukah!

This recipe is very much like my mother's recipe except that she always used matzo meal. Growing up in an orthodox home, potato pancakes a staple, especially during Passover.

My father (German origin) taught my mother and me to make potato pancakes. Each medium size potato was matched with an egg. Seasoning was salt. That's all, folks! Originally we grated the potatoes but are a bit more modern now.

Very good, classic recipe. Flour works ok. Matzoh meal is the standard. I use Matzoh meal when I have it in the house. Here's another tip to keep them holding together. As you grate the potatos place them in a bowl of water to keep from browning. Then when all potatos are grated take them out and squeeze the heck out of them on towels until they are as dry as can be. Then mix with the grated onions and other ingredients. Now take that bowl of water and pour off the water. You will be left with a white block of potato starch at the bottom of the bowl - it looks and feels like wet clay. Take that starch and mix it back into your latke mixture. This will give you nice crisp latkes that won't fall apart. I've also made ahead and froze them like the cook from nashville. It works well and gives you more time with guests. Still it doesn't quite feel like Chanukah if you don't smell like a fry cook after :-)

Make ahead & Freeze! Take the latkies from the pan (do not dry oil off) and put them directly onto a baking sheet set up in your freezer. Once they are frozen, you can transfer them to a ziplock. When you are ready, take however many you want out & reheat in a 325-350 degree oven. The left over oil will re-crisp them to perfection. The best part, your house won't smell like a diner & you can be out enjoying eating them with your family instead of stuck in the kitchen! After all, celebrating & eating WITH your family & friends is what cooking is all about.

Make this a day ahead - so the potatoes can dry out. I used the kitchen towel method and still ended up with a pool of liquid in the last batches. Still, this is a killer recipe. Crispy, brown and yummy. A little time consuming but worth it.

Reduce fat and work: bake in the oven on oiled parchment paper (easier cleanup - can oil pan directly too). Bake until golden brown on the underside, then flip and bake (less time) until golden brown on the second side. Solves the problem of the drippy mess at the bottom of the mixing bowl too.

I don't know what I did wrong...but it came out terrible! I had to throw it all away and use bread instead! Bummer! Will try again...note to others, DO NOT LET IT SIT TOO LONG!!!

so good! the box grater texture is so perfect. you MUST drain in a strainer. i would like to use matzoh meal next time. i think i had the heat too low at first and then raised it, that seemed to cook them perfectly. can't wait to make again! used organic onion and red potatoes.

I thought these were just okay, but my guests loved them. They gobbled them all up! I found that cooking them over "moderately high heat" was a bit too hot, so turned it down a bit for later batches.

Add a peeled apple when grating, for a bit of sweetness, some lemon juice to keep the whole batter from turning brown, and don't forget a 1/2 tsp of baking soda. This really makes them great. You can substitue matzoh meal for flour if you like, but they taste the same!

I doubled up the recipe for a party and everything was great, except for the little puddle left at the bottom of the mixture..I guess I should have let the mix sit over a strainer as I made the pancakes. Once I got to the last batch, the accumulated water had washed off the egg & flour, so the last of the pancakes weren't sticking together as well. Other than that, they were great! I included the parsley suggestion from another reviewer, and it gave it them a great taste!

I haven't tried these, but am wondering why there is no mention of matzoh meal as the thickener-the classic! t the

Great recipe! Made it exactly as stated, and it turned out nice.

As I was mixing together the potato and onion, I said, "These are just hashbrowns". I was WRONG. These are really good, my kids adored them, and the sour cream was a perfect accompaniment. What a good, easy recipe.

My husband grew up on potato pancakes, but this is the first time I've ever made them. His verdict..... they're as good as his mom's!!! Definately a keeper.

A good, simple and quick latke recipe. If you are looking for a way to make them without frying, I may have found a solution: potato waffles (or latkaffles). Increase flour to 1/4 or 1/3 cup, add 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda and 2 tablespoons buttermilk or yogurt (or perhaps, sour cream). This will make just enough of a batter to provide some lift, and they wil look just like waffles, but still have the flavor of latkes inside. Increasing the "batter" element of it makes it lighter, crispier, but also less potato-flavored. If course, all you need is a little bit of non-stick spray or the finest coating of margarine, rather than all that (delicious) butter.

Definitely did the trick. Seemed as if the mixture wouldn't stay together when frying, but surprisingly it did. Used food processer,shredded half the potatoes, then used chopper for other half, so there was texture to the consistency.
