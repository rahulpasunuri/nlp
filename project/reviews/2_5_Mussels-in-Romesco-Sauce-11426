I liked this recipe but think it needs to be tinkered with to perfect it. You can easily use the amount of romesco on twice as many muscles in my opinion. I omitted the cilantro the first time I made it.

New Mexico chiles are so mild that gloves are really not necessary. If you're worried, oil your hands first, but only people with cuts would be affected by touching the seeds from the NM.

This recipe was part of an entire Spanish Tapas Dinner that our "Gourmet Club" prepared. All 10 of us found it to be an excellent dish and was complimented well by the rest of the menu.

I was not impressed with this recipe. The sauce was just o.k.; I thought it would have a bolder flavour and I didn't think it complemented the mussels too well. It wasn't worth the work. A simpler recipe like the "Penn Cove Mussels in Lemon Cream" went over much better with my family and was 10 times tastier.
