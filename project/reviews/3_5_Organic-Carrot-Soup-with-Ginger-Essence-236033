My husband and six year daughter like cold summer soups. We just made this and my daughter gives it two thumbs up. We agree that it's a flexible recipe. We used what we had -- chicken stock instead of vegetable stock and water, greek yogurt instead of sour cream -- and it came out great. We also didn't bother with straining. Just cook the carrots an extra 10 minutes and puree well in the blender.

I didn't strain my puree (hooray for more fiber!) and I used a few heaping spoonfuls of full fat yogurt instead of sour cream. Just as good. I think some fresh cracked black pepper right before serving really picks up this dish, too. Mess around with the ingredients or proportions. This recipe is pretty solid, and you can mix things up a bit and still get great results.

this is by far the best carrot ginger soup i've had! Even my two year old loved it... i substituted lemon zest instead of lemon grass the second time i made it and it was just as good... lovely meal for a cold winter night.

Unfortunately bland. Needs cumin, cilantro, garlic -- anything! There are better carrot ginger soup recipes out there.

We substituted fresh lemon juice for the lemon grass due to unavailability and it worked wonderfully! Rich and savory, but not overbearing. Great dish to start a fall meal.

Delicious! I loved this soup and will definitely be making it again and again. I used yogurt in my soup. Loved it!

This is so good, and it does taste great cold or hot. I use low fat yogurt instead of sour cream because it's healthier and tastes even better I think.

This soup is heavenly! Not only is it easy to make,but I do believe it's the best I've ever had. I did make a few minor changes. Not wanting to purchase carrot juice, I make my own by slicing up extra carrots and simmering till just tender in organic apple juice. Then pureed the mixture and added more juice for thinner consistency. This added even more depth to the soup. Oh, and don't throw away the pulp! just and some fresh ground macadamia nuts and grade "b" maple syrup and now you have a lovely carrot butter. Bottom line is the bowls were licked clean!
