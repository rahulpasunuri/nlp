during a dinner party i made this as a "cleanser" between dishes...it only got a so-so review. It didn't have much zing, and wasn't really as tart as i would have liked it. Tasted an awful lot like frozen applesauce.There are better sorbet "cleanser" recipes out there.

This was a fabulous "cleanser" before the main course. I was a bit disappointed that it didn't taste as much like the tart Granny Smith's and more like apple juice. Still great though.

I have made this twice. The second time I added a generous amount of Calvados, after chilling the mix. It made a excellent refreshment between the Tiger Prawn Newbourg and the Roast Goose.
