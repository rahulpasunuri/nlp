I love this recipe. Don't use cheap Madeira-this is probably why some people found it to be strong. No need to use Sercial, a good brand will do (don't rely on the opinion of the store owner-do your research!) Moist bird, great gravy, tasty stuffing-but I added a little extra butter and stock to my stuffing.

This has been a family favorite since the year it was published.

We have made this entire feast for the last five years and we love it. I use turkey Italian sausage for the stuffing and it's fantastic. I agree with other cooks that the gravy can be a little strong so we cut back on the Madeira. Overall I highly recommend this recipe to anyone.

Thank heaven for this website! I have made this every other year since the recipe first appeared in 1995! We LOVE it. The tattered old magazine was discarded during our move 2 years ago, but thanks to this, our tradition continues! We highly recommend!

The sausage fennel stuffing was very good however, the madiera gravy was awful! Too strong, way too much madiera!! Would make the stuffing again, but do my tradtional turkey gravy .Had to do alot of "fixing" for the gravy.

I used only half the amount of wine and am glad I did. I found it somewhat bitter. The problem may have been that I was using a new roasting pan. It took some work but turned out okay in the end. Just okay though.

The stuffing was incredibly good. It is a little dry, but once you put that gravy on, boy, it is delicious. For Madeira, I substituted with Sherry. Next time I make the gravy, I'll use less sherry and more turkey juice-I had to water down a bit. For the turkey, I smothered in herbed butter dressing (fresh rosemary and sage and salt). I also poured some sherry into this. It came out very good!

hey, I'll get in this rut with you ;-) I made this and the stuffing & gravy are fantastic. I couldn't find Sercial (didn't look hard though) so used Sandeman's Madeira and it was great. Also added shittake mushrooms & some fresh thyme to the gravy. Incredible.

I hate it when I get in a rut, but somethings are just too good to not make every year, and this turkey recipe has become one of those too good things. The stuffing is very good, but I think it is the madeir a gravy that makes the meal (make a little extra, trust me).
