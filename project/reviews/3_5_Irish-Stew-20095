I didn't care for the process (why brown the meat in a skillet instead of in the pot? Why blanch the potatoes separately?) and I didn't care for the result. It was bland and the flour thickener plus dumplings made the stew feel gloppy. I prefer this recipe and will try it with lamb: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Beef-Stew-with-Potatoes-and-Carrots-350935

This was excellent, but I confess I did make a few changes. Like others, I added 4 cloves of garlic and used chicken broth in place of the water. I also added some green beans and mushrooms. The green beans added color and the mushrooms were just because I like them. I also added a teaspoon of thyme to the stew. The dumplings are delicious and a real treat. Thyis is truly comfort food.

I substituted chicken breast for the lamb and it was delicious. The dumplings made the dish! I would not make this stew without them.

I used buckwheat flour for the lamb and dumplings. I added lamb seasoning because when I tried it mid-way it was bland and was afraid I wasn't gonna able to rectify it later. Used olive oil instead of fat. Needs more water. I ended up with no liquid but it tastes delicious. Subbed parsnips for turnips. Made dumplings as per Herby Dumplings from this website. Do try it!

Yummy! Like other reviewers I wondered about the lack of seasoning, but this is comfort food at its best: warm, hearty, filling and yummy. Even a friend who doesn't like lamb wiped the bowl with crusty bread. The essence was there, but it wasn't overpowering. I didn't change much other than what some other reviewers suggested: add some garlic (4 cloves) and use low-sodium chicken broth instead of water. I also increased the carrots to 4 and the turnips to 6 (since I bought both in those bunches). I just increased the chicken broth to cover -- using about 8 cups of that overall. I recommend saving the flour for dredging to thicken (as suggested in the recipe) because I like my stews thicker than soup, but mashing some of the potatoes might suffice. The only thing I might change the next time (and there will be a next time) is doubling the pepper in the flour mixture.

A very simple stew, but so delicious. Tastes even better the next day!

A really, really good flavorful stew. Even the kids, who usually won't eat lamb, ate this up. I will definitely be making this again.

Outstanding! I made a lamb stock out of lamb bones that I had in the freezer and subbed red wine for white and also subbed parsnips for the turnip. THANK GOD I HAD LEFTROVERS so I can enjoy this one more time! I liked the idea of adding the can of beer, but I had 4 cups of lamb stock, so I didn't need it, besides, it reminds me of a quote from The Quiet Man, "When I drink whiskey, I drink whiskey and when I drink water, I drink water". Personally, I wouldn't water down the flavor of the lamb with the beer, but I'd drink the beer alongside the stew! And as I'm a Cork man, I'd drink Murpheys not Guiness.

Althought I don't care for lamb, I had to try this after reading the reviews. My husband, the real cook & 1/2 Irish, loved it. As other have done, I cooked it a bit longer and also took the liberty of adding a bottle of Guinness, mushrooms and braised lamb bones. The mushrooms (couldn't have been the Guinness) watered down the flavors some, so I added beef demi glace which brought the flavors around again. I didn't thicken the stew as instructed, because the dumplings did the job. I thought it was outstanding (for a lamb dish), but next time, I'll ask my husband to cook it.

I added many cloves of garlic, and used chicken stock instead of water. Also added a few more carrots. The best lamb stew I have ever tasted....

A family pleaser perfect for a chilly evening. Not too many ingredients. However there was plenty of flavor from the meat and vegetables.

Incredibly flavorful. My boyfriend enjoyed but suggested diluting a little or reducing less next time (little too rich).

This is your basic lamb stew. Nothing fancy but still very tasty. I cooked the vegetables without blanching anything beforehand. I added more carrots than the recipe called for.

this stew was gorgeous! easiest to prepare and tastes very flavorful. i was very skeptical about the absence of herbs, but i followed the recipe anyways. added 3 minced garlic cloves along with the onion and used a can of beer as a reviewer recommended. it came out soooo homey and warming, perfect for rainy nights. i suggest not adding any herbs (even a bay leaf, which i sorely wanted to) and just add lots of black pepper. yummy.

I made this recipe using beef last year on St. Patty's day. I plan to make it again! It was thick, warm and scrumptious. A delicious stew to celebrate the Irish!

This recipe was a winner for sure. I kind of winged it, because I'm lazy. I used 2 cans of chicken broth, 1 pint of Guinness, 3 potatoes, 2 lbs of lamb, added green beans and skiped the turnips. I needed a bunch of salt to bring out the flavor. I also added a bit og garlic powder and cyanne pepper. I just browned the meat in some lard and dumped everything into a crock pot turned on high for 8.5 hours. I served it with some toasted sourdough bread (again, I'm lazy). Got a great reaction. I added about 1/4 cup of flour and 1.5 tsp. of cornstarch at the very end to thicken it up a bit.

Disappointed. The stew lacked flavor. I think it would do better with some garlic and something to raise the acidity. I did not make the dumplings which might have given it more flavor, but I doubt it. Did use some Guiness but even that gave it little character. Even the bland reputation of Irish dishes was set back by this one.

Great recipes, made more perfect! I made this Irish stew recipe last night and it turned out to be fantastic. I used beef, since family prefers it. Instead of water, I used 2 cups of Harp Lager and 2 cups of Chicken broth,(more liquids if needed at the end stages if too thick). Also I used 2 cups of sliced carrots and only 4 medium potatoes, cubed; I omitted the turnips. I also added a tsp. of dried thyme, and a dash of garlic hot sauce. I did not make the dumplings, since I wanted to serve it with Champ(peas ommitted). Along with the Irish Soda bread with Raisins and Caraway (Bon Appetit Oct 2002)-I used currants instead of raisins though, and the Irish Pub Salad Bon Appetit May 1996 we had a scumptious meal fitting for a St. Patick's Day celebration. Ending the meal with Apple Oatmeal Crisp with Irish Cream (Emeril 2001) put the icing on the cake,using Baileys Irish Creme instead of simply Irish whiskey worked out beautifully.

I've never had lamb stew and was suspicious of the number of stars and the lack of any real seasoning. But it was a winner. To those who compare lamb to beef, there is no comparison. This stew made withe beef would fail to impress. I never had turnips either and will now seek out other recipes with turnips. I accidently bought Cilantro instead of Parsley for the dumplings, but it was OK

I made this last night for my fiance with a few changes and it was amazing. Niether of us ever liked stew until this. I replaced the water with low sodium chicken broth, used beef instead of lamb (we don't eat lamb) added 2 cloves of garlic and because we hate turnips I put peas in instead. The outcome was not an Irish stew, but a very yummy one all the same. I can't wait to eat the leftovers. I made the dumplings but they turned out terrible. With all the potatoes we didnt miss them.

This recipe is a winner! Making it for just myself, I only used 3/4 lb of lamb, eliminated the potatoes, used one carrot and one white turnip, but added a small can of drained string beans. Reduced the dumplings by one-half and ate the whole thing myself!

This was so good and EASY!! The only things I changes were I used low-sodium chicken broth instead of water, ommitted the turnips, and added some fresh thyme....my only regret is that I didn't make more, it was gone in a day!! Perfect for a cold night. Yummy!

A traditional hearty stew that was simple and delicious. We don't like turnips so they were replaced with peas. I'll definately make this again. Did anybody else notice that this recipe was published in 1963?

Used the slow cooker for everything but browning the meat and boiling the dumplings and got raves! (Ladled out the broth to boil the dumplings in another pan.) We will make this for company next time, it is soooo good!

Fantastic, but I made a substantial change. Used 3 lbs of boneless chicken breasts instead of lamb (guess that disqualifies the dish as Irish.) Everyone loved it. I even had it for breakfast the next morning it was so good!

Made on Saturday, had with company on Monday, 3/18/02, day after St. Patrick's Day. Excellent taste with great gravy. Used a crock pot and cooked for 7 hrs. Letting it sit for two days helped it meld together. Used neck bones w the meat as recommended by others. Threw the leftover flour coating in also. Added some thyme, but that was it aside from salt & pepper. The meat was exquisitely tender, and fell off the the bone. I sliced some potatoes and diced large the others. No turnips. Even my lamb indifferent wife took seconds.

Definitely comfort food! The recipe was easy to follow and the result was a hearty and--don't know how else to put it--honest stew. I used the equivalent of two pounds of lamb and found it, as another reviewer said, plenty lamb-y. Couldn't find any turnips, but it turned out fine without. This one is a keeper for sure!

This is a fantastic dish. I got rave reviews for this stew and am making it for the third time. I never have any left overs as it is super tastey!

A great comfort food! I'm making it for the 2nd time, and agree that if you're doing dumplings, no need for so many potatoes.

I did drop the sugar and while sauting the veggies I added 2 shots of Irish Whisky. Actually make that a shot and a half; half for chef. Everyone enjoyed this dish.

I make this with only one pound of lamb, and it's delicious, and plenty lamb-y. I've also found that once I brown the meat in a skillet, I can toss everything in a crockpot and leave it for four or five hours on low, and it comes out beautifully.

I added several minced cloves of garlic with the oinons. You don't need as many potatoes as called for. Near the end, I also added a sprig of rosemary and some peas. I realize this may not be the traditional Irish stew, but the results were delicious!

It looked great, but was somewhat tasteless the first day. I needed to add a lot of seasoning at the table. The stew thickened and was better the second day but still needed to be seasoned.

The stew was quite tasty, however, it was a lot of meat! I would suggest adding extra carrots and potatoes.

It was delicious, but I thought it was a little bland so I added a few sprigs of fresh savory. I did not make the dumplings because it seemed to have enough potatoes. They looked delicious though
