I thought the original recipe was a little bland. I spiced it up and added more spices and herb combinations. We are from Texas so we like spice.

I used only 1/2 cup oil, put all ingredients in a gallon plastic bag and tossed well. Tastes fine.

OK...here goes...Grammie's secret. Substitute the veg oil with Orville Redenbacher's Buttery Flavor Popcorn Oil. YUM!! and yes she included the dill weed, garlic powder, and Lemon Pepper. Not LOW CAL for sure, but really good!

Try adding Dillweed, Lemon Pepper, and Garlic Powder. And more importantly, rather than laying out on paper towels, try baking the crackers on cookie sheet or in baking pan at 250 degrees for 45 minutes. Helps reduce oiliness and enhances taste.

These are good, but kind of ordinary. I brought them to a Superbowl party, and the guests thought they were out of a box from the supermarket - the last thing you want when you've made something in your own kitchen! I only used 1/4 cup of oil, and I added dill weed and garlic salt. Insted of laying them out on a paper towel overnight, I baked them on a baking sheet for 10 minutes, stirring halfway through, at 250 degrees.

My brother made these for the appetizer tray this past Thanksgiving. They are excellent! People kept going back to them, and commenting on how tasty they were. Try them, I'm sure everyone will like them.

My mother used to make oyster crackers similar to these. With 2 packets dried ranch dressing, 1 tbs. dill, and 1 tbs. basil. This variation is great, and a nice change from what I'm used to.

This is a knock off of the Hidden Valley recipe, which is 1 box/16 oz. Oyster crackers, 1/4 cup Vegetable Oil, 1 packet/1 oz. Hidden Valley® Original Ranch® seasoning & salad dressing mix. The last time I made it (which was years ago) it also called for dill and garlic salt. And once all the ingredients were combined, you stirred it every 15 minutes for 1 hour until the crackers had absorbed the ingredients. Either way, these are addictive!!! Kind of like Lays potato chips - you can't eat just one!

I made 5 recipes of this for 80 ladies at a baby shower. It went well with the sliced cucumbers and spinach balls. But the best comments came from my 21 year old son and friends. They like them as well as Doritos. Babs

I never thought to use ranch seasoning for snack mix but, it was good! I also agree that the recipe calls for a lot of oil. To counteract that I kept adding crackers. To make the mix more fun add different types of crackers, ie, baby goldfish, giant goldfish, etc.

I actually modified this recipe after comparing it to others. In addition to the lemon pepper, I also added about 1/2 tsp dill weed and 1/2 tsp of garlic powder. I also used 1/2 cup of canola oil. I found that it was less messy and easier to mix the oil and crackers by using a large ziploc bag and gently tossing the mixture until the crackers were evenly coated. Very easy and tasty.

This is a family favorite, but we make it with about 1/2 cup of corn oil, and with dill (about 1/2 tbsp) instead of lemon pepper seasoning. I think the corn oil absorbs a little better.

I made these tonight for our Superbowl party on Sunday. They are very good already. I did reduce the oil by 1/4 cup, and there seemed to be enough to go around. I expect the bowl to be empty by half time!!!
