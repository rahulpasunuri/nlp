3.5 forks really. Very good. Do not skip the chopped hazelnuts, that is precisely what makes it Perugian. Two minor changes: 1) sprinkled abundant coat of cocoa powder on top after it had cooled down 2) dressed it up with a row of whole caramelized hazelnuts 1" from edge of cake. Adds a very nice crunch.

Super rich consistency, and smooth as silk! YUM! BUT... Dont follow the recipe exactly unless you're wonder woman. Like the previous poster says, doing all that wisking is pretty ridiculous! I melted the chocolate and butter in a double boiler, I then chopped the cream cheese into sections (also make sure the cream cheese is ROOM temperature, this is very important.). I took the double boiler off the heat, but kept it together (so the heat from the water is still keeping everything hot), I then wisk in the cream cheese. Its not that hard to do, really. If there is plenty of heat still coming from the water, the cream cheese melts pretty quickly. I put the eggs and sugar in my Kitchen Aid and tossed it on #6 speed. Bam! Perfect eggs and sugar mousse! Then I dropped the speed down to med-low, and slowly added the chocolate mixture. Dump it all into the springform pan, and throw it into the oven. Done. I've made this cheese cake about 6-8 times. I never put in the nuts, as my family are not nut fans. It always comes out perfect! My husband always requests this for his birthday, so it must be delish!

This cheesecake was pretty good, but it was way more work than it was worth. My "active time" was closer to 90 minutes than the 30 minutes listed. If you are going to make this recipe, learn from my experience: 1) Do not "whisk" in the cream cheese. If you try to "whisk" the cream cheese, the batter will immediately fill up your whisk with a solid mass that will take you 10 minutes to scrape out with a knife. Stir it in with a wooden spoon or similar. 2) Don't buy chopped hazelnuts to save time unless they are already skinned. The skins wouldn't come off the toasted chopped hazelnuts. 3) I whisked the eggs and sugar until my arm hurt, and then I did it that long again and again. The consistency never approached "mousse." I finally just kept going. The final product was good. but I've made better cheesecakes that were EASY.

Really yummy, but REALLY RICH - five adults only managed to eat a quarter of this delicious cheesecake, and it wasn't for lack of trying! Very easy to make, although toasting and skinning your own hazelnuts is a bit time-consuming, it is worth it to get really fresh taste and aroma. A great make-ahead dessert.

Loved this! I followed the recipe exactly, except did not include nuts. Turned out beautifully and tasted like a masterpiece. I made a note to myself on the recipe card: put a cookie sheet underneath the springform pan to keep a little batter from leaking out. Could just be my pan, though! Also, I put some water in an oven-proof crock and left it in the oven while baking. This is my husband's trick that he swears keeps a cheesecake moist.

I think it would work fine. I don't imagine that swapping out the nuts would make any real difference. And the texture of this cake is VERY dense, so a little cream will just create a softer filling--which might not be a bad thing. Of course, this may change the baking time, so keep an eye on it. Good luck--Gina

i have not made this recipe yet but i am considering replacing the hazelnuts with pistachio and adding a bit of cream flavored with rose water. any ideas on if this would work? i am not sure about the oil content of the nuts and how differently they might bake up.

I made this with crushed chocolate Famous Wafers for the crust, and I used macadamia nuts instead of hazelnuts, and it was delish! What a lovely, luscious, chocolately batter. However, and I know some people will disagree with me here, I would increase the sugar to as much as a full cup for my own tastes. Or perhaps serve it with a liberal dusting of powdered sugar on top. I love bittersweet chocolate, but all the same, I just think it needs to be a tad sweeter.

The cake still maintains the richness of an original cheesecake with the combination of sour cream that is at first subtle, but becomes richer with each bite. Would serve in small slivers due to richness. Chocolate and hazelnuts are always a winning combination in my book. Will definitely use this recipe again.

An excellent cheesecake. Just the right amount of chocolate. Not too sweet. I made this for my mother-in-law's 70th birthday and she loved it! (Now I'm in good!) It's definitely worth the trouble to make from scratch.
