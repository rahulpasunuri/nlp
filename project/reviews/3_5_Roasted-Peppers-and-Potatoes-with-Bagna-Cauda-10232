Great recipe! We even served it as part of our Passover meals and not a drop was left over. Will double the anchovies next time.

LOVED IT! Did not have 10 peppers but it worked with only 4. LOVED the Bagna Cauda. Served with grilled jumbo shrimp. Will be a staple at our house.

Easy and delicious. We had it for Christmas (very colorful) and it could be prepared in advance, always a nice feature.
