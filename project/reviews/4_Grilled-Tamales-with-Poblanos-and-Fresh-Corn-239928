I also used the non-hydrogenated Spectrum shortening, and prefer it to the heavier lard. Two things I have learned when making tamales- when you start them steaming, put a couple of dimes in the water, so they will clang if the pot is dry. The other is to add a Tablespoon of water to steamed tamales in a zip lock bag- then to reheat, you can microwave and the water will steam them- Liked this very much with a savory (vegetarian chorizo called 'soyrizo') filling for breakfast, and also with a dried fruit and nuts filling for a dessert tamale- drizzled with warm cajeta, yummy!

Very good tamales. I used frozen roasted corn and Earth Balance in place of the rendered lard I keep in the freezer and the tamales were perfection for my vegetarian clients.

The masa needs some pureed onion and hominy and sweet corn--about a cup each.

My first time making tamales, and these were delicious. I also substituted vegetable shortening for lard. Served them with the pozole rojo from the same issue.

Made these (in advance, as the recipe suggests) and they were spectacular. Fresh corn lends a lot (though I am guessing a high quality froz corn might be a decent substitute in the dead of winter) and the grilling makes them beautiful as well as tasty. I tried the new Earth balance shortening (non- hydrogenated) rather than lard and it worked out perfectly. Heavenly side dish for grilled chicken, fish or big salad for a luncheon.
