This is really good, but DO NOT cook the collard leaves for 15 minutes. It's too long if you still hope to roll these into "cigars." I think 10 minutes ought to do it. The recipe instructs you to remove the tough center rib anyway. I was unable to make the cigars after cooking the leaves for 15 minutes, and although I was able to assemble a kind of collard green casserole with the ingredients, I would like to serve these as rolls as intended.

These are soooo delicious. Can be made ahead of time for convenience. Received rave reviews!

Delicious. Will be making it again for a second time. It is time consuming but the sauce and rice can be made ahead to save time.

This was very good and I would make it again. However, the tomato sauce was a bit sweet for my taste. Next time I would reduce the amount of vinegar and sugar added to the sauce (maybe to just 1 Tbs. of each). It is a bit time consuming to make due to the multiple steps, so plan for that if you are going to make it.
