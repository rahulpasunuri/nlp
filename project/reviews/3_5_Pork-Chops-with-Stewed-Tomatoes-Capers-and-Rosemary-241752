Wow, this is a great recipe. It was tangy, sweet, satisfying, and certainly umami. We loved how the rosemary and capers harmonized beautifully. Served with boiled sweet carrots, earthy steamed chinese broccoli, and a smooth Chenin Blanc....A simple delicious meal.

As others have said -- this is surprisingly delicious. I made it for 2 -- 2 pork chops -- and the sauce as called for. Used chopped gherkins in place of the relish. Served with noodles and a simple Chardonnay,

Honestly one of my favorite recipes because it is healthy, quick and easy. I substitute chopped sweet gherkins for the relish and use a tsp of dried rosemary.

Delicious, quick and easy! Made as written except I also deglazed the pan with some red wine after browning the chops, also doubled the sauce as recommended by others. Served with some buttered egg noodles. Will definitely make this again.

This was really good! Strange ingredients, but it worked. My family loved it. We served it over egg noodles with broccoli on the side.

This was a delicious, quick weeknight dinner. I used 2 cans of stewed tomatoes, since I had a lot, and it turned out wonderfully. My only complaint is that I now have a jar of sweet relish and no idea what to do with it.

I pretty much followed the cooking directions except I deglazed the pan with a little white wine after searing the chops and used my wife's homemade zucchini relish in place of the sweet relish. Very flavorful, the relish and rosemary added a nice twist.

I pretty much made this per the instructions with the following modifications. I deglazed the pan with a little white wine after searing the chops and I used my wife's homemade zucchini relish. A very flavorful dish, the additions of the rosemary and relish gave it a little twist.

Wow - this was unexpectedly delicious. I wasn't sure about the sweet relish - it was amazing! Served with white rice - it was the perfect, very quick, workday dinner. I doubled the tomatoes, garlic, capers and relish to make extra sauce for the rice. Recipe is a definite keeper!

I made my own last minute relish by using sweet gerkins, onions and bell peppers, because I thought I had some in the fridge, but didn't. This turned out surprisingly well, given the above substitution and instead of rosemary I used thyme.

The family loved it....can't believe the rave reviews they gave me. My husband loves pork chops and nothing too fancy. He said this was his new favorite way. I was a little concerned about the relish but added it anyway. Will keep this handy for a quick supper.

I modified pretty heavily, but only to add things. The foundation of this was great, but I wanted to make it into a full meal. I added two cans of cannellini beans, about 2tsp lemon zest, and two minced shallots. I cooked the shallots with the garlic, added the zest after the tomatoes, and added the beans before putting the meat back in. I also used boneless pork chops instead of bone-in and sliced them up before adding back into the mix. Last, I stirred in about 2.5 cups of cooked pasta. It didn't look pretty after mixing it all together (would have been nicer with the stewed stuff as a topping for the pasta), but it sure tasted good and this made it into a full meal.

One of my friends made this dish last night. I was skeptical... I don't like relish and rarely use capers. But both of us were really pleasantly surprised. The only thing we said we'd do differently, is to tenderize the pork. Also, the sauce was good drizzled over rice.

Good, not great. I like the idea of simmering the pork in the sauce for a little while; I will try that next time.

Pork chops were tender but the relish gave the whole dish an odd flavor. I wouldn't make this again.

This was a very flavorful dish. I used diced tomatoes and fresh green pepper instead of the stewed tomatoes. I simmered (covered) the pan for 30 minutes. Then I thickend the sauce with 1 teas. of cornstarch and brought it to a boil. I think that the relish added a bit of mystery to the dish.

My fiancee loved this recipe: anything with capers is great for him. The addition of the sweet relish was...a little odd? I will make this again, but with only 1T of relish, rather than the 2T called for.
