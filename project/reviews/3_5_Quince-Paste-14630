Very flavourful paste with minimal tending time. Followed the recipe except used food mill instad of a fine sieve as I wanted a bit more of a toothsome texture,reduced sugar to 3/4 following other reviewers advice, and added a bit of lemon juice just to make sure it still gelled.

I double this recipe, using 4# quince and only 2 cups of sugar. The quince must be firm-ripe and not very astringent. After the initial baking, I puree the quince in a processor and put it through the finest disk in my food mill. I then bake the paste for about an hour in a 350-degree oven in a heavy pan, stirring it down with a wire whisk every 15 minutes. It is much easier to manage than on the stove. I preserve my quince paste in a steam canner for 15 minutes in 1/2 to 1 cup jars, so it doesn't have to be refrigerated.

I doubled the recipe as we have a very productive quince tree, and used a 9 inch nonstick cake pan lined with waxed paper to set up the paste. After chilling overnight the paste came out of the pan beautifully. I then cut the paste into 1" logs, wrapped them in plastic wrap, and put in frig. The process is quick and easy, and the result is both beautiful and delicious. I'm going to make another batch today - the logs will make great Christmas gifts.

This is very tasty. I served it with aged Manchego and thin slices of serrano. I agree that less sugar would make it taste less like a dessert, but too little and the paste doesn't gel.

A great way to use fresh quince. It's easy, tasty, and a beautiful color. Great with manchego, goat cheese, or just on toast. Better than the imported "membrillo" at the fancy cheese boutiques.

the next time, I would reduce the amount of sugar to 2/3 the recommended amount. Otherwise, a good recipe and the paste went well with a selection of good cheeses and excellent South Australian wine.
