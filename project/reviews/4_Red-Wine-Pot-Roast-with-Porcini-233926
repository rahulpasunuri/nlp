Great gravy. My wife froze the extra gravy it was so good. Followed previous reviews by using diced tomatoes and fresh thyme from back yard garden. Also, used 2 cups of beef broth, replaced onion with 3 shallots. Put juices in blender for 10 seconds after roast was done, made gravy thick. Returned gravy to pot, added teaspoon of salt and fresh mushrooms. Simmered for about 10 minutes then serve.

Solid dish - I added French fingerling potatoes. However, I must warn cooks after me that the cooking time was WAY too long. I pulled the roast out after about 2 hours and it was well cooked through - the liquid was almost completely cooked off.

My husband gave a 8/10. I gave it a 6.5/10. I thought it was ok. I expected something exceptional based on the reviews. It is easy but the cooking time is pretty long.

I loved this pot roast! I was halfway through and realized I had no celery so I substituted chopped carrots. They worked beautifully and added a slight sweetness that landed itself nicely. I used a teaspoon of dried marjoram, frozen chopped onions and bottled chopped garlic. The pot roast was delicious, moist and the "sauce" delicious. My husband hates pot roast and loved this. He said it was more like short ribs (meat moist and falling easily off) than the dry pot roast he was used to. Will definitely make again. YUM! :)

We really did NOT like this. It was overwhelmingly tomato-y and otherwise tasteless. And a lot of work that was not worth the effort. I used my slow cooker and suggestions from other posters. Unlike them, we had much too much left over. I will not make this again.

Delicious and easy. Make sure you use the cut the recipe recommends - makes a huge difference.

This recipe was very good but not my favorite, only because I prefer this without the tomatoes. I made two version of this, one with the tomatoes and the other without tomatoes, substituting with a bit more beef broth. The dried porcinis are a nice touch well worth the drive to go get them!

Yum!! Had some leeks & shallots to use up, so threw them into the sauce. Recipe made lots of gravy, so will do as an earlier reviewer suggested and save excess for pasta sauce. Fabulous recipe that I will make again and again.

Absolutely wonderful! Did the recipe as call for except marinated the beef (in the wine) for 24 hours prior to cooking. Don't know if it made a difference, compared to if I hadn't, but it was certainly delicious. Ran out of time so didn't puree, but will definitely do this next time. Plan to serve leftover sauce with pasta tomorrow night. I love it when meals can be stretched like this.

Oooh, this is so good! Made it for hubby's birthday, and he was one happy camper :D I did not have as big of a roast as recommended, did not seem to make much difference. I used beef broth, did not bother with smashing the garlic (used bottled minced), could not find fresh marjoram--subbed herbes de Provence, used canned crushed tomatoes instead, and wine choice was Red Diamond Cab. Sauv. Followed instructions overall, but cooked in crockpot on HI for 4 hours rather than in oven. Did not bother with reduction of sauce at end. Served with fried yukon gold potatoes--wonderful! Will make again for sure!!

Easy and delicious. Tip: You do not have to turn the roast during the cooking process in the oven. It's an unnecessary step. Just baste the meat a bit if you like.

Let me start by saying that I make pot roasts frequently, and I've never yet found a recipe with which I am completely satisfied. Well, now I have! This is beyond delicious. The local grocery store had "buy one get one free" on roasts the other day, and since I had a different recipe I wanted to try (won't make that one again) I had planned to buy one roast and came home with two. What to do with the second one? I found this recipe and based on the excellent reviews, decided to give it a try. I made it on a day we weren't going to eat at home since I didn't want to have it sit around in the fridge. I made exactly as described except I used the entire 1 ounce package of dried porchinis and 2 cups of chicken broth. I braised in the oven for and additional 1 hour (we like roast really falling apart). Then I just put the lid on the Dutch oven and put the whole thing in the fridge for 2 days. Tonight after work, I followed the advice of another cook and put it in a 350 oven for about an hour. What emerged was a true revelation in pot roast deliciousness. Very tender meat and the sauce (I did not blend as many have suggeted as we served both roast and sauce straight out of the pot, using a fork to pull the roast apart) is the richest, most delicious concoction. Very dark brown, almost inky. The mushroom flavor came through after all of this roasting and I really enjoyed the super- braised vegetables in it, which I normally do not. This would be delicious with mashed potatoes or polenta plus some roasted root vegetables.

Wonderful! I didn't think too much of it when I first took it out of the oven. I sliced it, covered it with the sauce I'd pureed, and put it in the refrigerator for a couple hours. I reheated it, covered with foil, at 325 for a hour. Behold, it had turned into a rich, fabulous got roast. I think making it ahead like this is essential. If I needed the time, I would have no worries about making it the night before.

EXCELLENT ! My store did not have just porcini mushrooms so I had to go with a bag of mixed ( oyster, shitake, porcini etc. ) I threw them all in so I basically used an ounce. I did everything the same but instead of the oven I used my crock pot. The best pot roast I have ever had. The flavor is amazing. A keeper for sure

A winner - made as written with addition of a few button mushrooms. Cooked in crockpot after browning. Made a lot of sauce, which was lovely over pasta the next day.

This was exceptionally good. I used baby bellas instead of porcini and plum tomatoes that were getting old. Had to cook it an extra hour; next time I will try the slow cooker. Other than that, one of the best roasts we've ever had.

Excellent recipe. I tweaked it a little bit; shitakes instead of porcinis and I added 2 parsnips and 2 carrots. Pureed half the mixture when done, as others have recommended. Flovorful and fork tender when done.

This came out very nice. It has rich flavors remeniscent of beef bourguignon. I used Better than Boullion (beef flavor), doubled the dried porcini to 1 ounce and used 2 14oz cans of diced tomatoes (drained) instead of whole. I also added a large diced shallot with the onion. Wife says this is the best roast she's ever had.

Wow! Followed recommendations from other reviewers, used more mushrooms, diced tomatoes instead of whole, thyme instead of marjoram, pureed juices before serving. Also used truffle salt for initial seasoning of meat. Simple, tender and delicious, probably the best pot roast I've ever eaten, certainly the best I've ever made.

My first ever pot roast (I tend to cook French and Mexican). Used cabernet and dried shiitake, and upped the garlic and celery a little. We all loved this. Fork tender and very flavorful. Rolled some leftovers into a tortilla with potatoes and had it for lunch. Added extra broth, as others suggested, to have more au jus for serving.

I spent about five hours doing Julia Child's Beef Bourguignon a few weeks ago and I spent about one hour putting this in my slow cooker. I believe they are comparable! This is really good and got raves from the other three at the table. I subbed fresh baby bellas for the porcini (too expensive), and did it in my slow cooker. About 4 hours on high and 2 hours on low. I zapped some new potatoes and carrots in the microwave and added to the roast about 2 hours before serving...arranged it all on a platter and that was dinner. It was sooo good! There was a lot of extra sauce (I didn't measure that closely) and my daughter-in-law wanted to keep it to boil some pasta in it for next day's lunch. That sounds good too.

I had one pound of chuck roast left over from another recipe, so cooked it in half the amount of other ingredients called for in the recipe. I cooked it for 1 hour on each side vs. 1.5 hours. Came out amazing!

This is the recipe my mother uses! Great comfort food. After the 3 hours in the oven I often just put it in the fridge and do the rest just before serving. The acid in the tomatoes and the wine can get a little harsh sometimes, so be careful about what kind of wine you use. I like serving it with polenta rather than potatoes.

OMG just finished eating this. one word, amazing! The meat just melts in your mouth. I followed this recipe as written except for doubling the garlic (bc i love it), using thyme instead of marjoram (that's what i had in my fridge already), and putting it all in my crock pot to simmer on low for 6 hours...and the results were outstanding (i served it with roasted garlic mashed potatoes..yummy!). this was my first attempt at making pot roast (not too sure why i've never done it before) and i will most certainly be making it again. i didnt need to reduce my sauce either, however i did puree 3/4 of it to make a smooth gravy...oh soo tasty. I live with boys and they all loved it and ate rather quickly i might add...boyfriend is coming over later (explained to me he hates pot roast but im sure i can change his mind..as i have with several other foods now haha) hopefully he will love it too! :)

Wonderful pot roast recipe - I'm an experienced cook but this was first time I made a pot roast in the oven - and will never go back to top-of-the- stove roast. Thanks reviewers for the tips on dangers of whole tomatoes splashing around - I bought chopped tomatoes instead. I didn't add broth or porcinis - just some mushrooms towards the end. I used more wine and garlic than called for, lots of fresh basil instead of marjoram. I prepared this two days ahead - my husband sliced the whole roast for me - and I heated it up slowly on the stove with the gravy, more of the wine and soy sauce, the flavors really sink in at this stage.

This is simply fantastic. It's about 80 degrees here but I needed to make something big in my slow cooker overnight and this has the most amazing flavor. So good that we're willing to eat it in July!! Best pot roast I've ever made and I've tried at least 6 from epicurious.

This was the best pot roast I have ever had--certainly the best I have made. I didn't expect the rich, savory sauce to be this good, and it was even better the next day. I made two adjustments, based on what was on-hand in my kitchen--two 14 oz cans of diced Italian tomatoes instead of the whole peeled ones, a full ounce of porcini (because I like them), and dried marjoram. I threw in a diced shallot with the onion. Major change is that I used a 2.5 buffalo eye round roast. I was a little concerned that the roast wouldn't be tender enough since it was so lean, but it was great--probably held together a little more than the chuck would have, but it sliced better for serving, and was like buttah...

NOM NOM NOM. Made this for Memorial Day (it was cold out!). Used dried shiitakes instead of porcini, added some carrots, used 2 14oz cans chopped tomatoes, undrained. Subbed fresh thyme and a couple of bay leaves for the marjoram. Threw it all in the crockpot for about 6 hours. Came out absolutely delicious and tender. I pureed about half the sauce and added it back to the rest, make it a little thicker but kept some of the chunkiness. Overall it came out delicious! I'll be making this one again for sure!

Disclaimer: This is the only time in my life I've ever eaten pot roast and it turns out I'm not a big fan -- I like my meat still mooing practically. That said, my pot-roast-loving boyfriend said this was tasty and I thought the porcini sauce made a good gravey on mash potatoes. It was easy to prepare and would certainly wow people that are looking for a dressed up pot roast.

Been making pot roasts for 40 years and have my favorites, and now I have one more. Followed the recipe exactly with two minor exceptions, doubled the beef broth, and put the sauce through a food processor after skimming off the fat which instantly thickened it to a rich consistency.

This is one of the best recipes I have made off of this site, and I have made many. The only changes I made: double the beef broth (used Better than Bouillon) and doubled the garlic. It was falling apart and I could barely save any (from myself) when putting the leftovers away. I also emulsified the sauce which I think adds a great addition to the beef, while not taking away from the overall meal. Served with carmelized shallot mashed potatoes from this site. To die for! I was supposed to bring extras to a friend tomorrow and I'm seriously reconsidering and being greedy :)

I tend to shy away from anything with a heavy mushroom flavors (too many years suffering through slimy canned mushrooms on cheap pizza), but this was fantastic. The mushroom added just the right amount of earthy, nutty flavor and the red wine reduction was great. It had enough complexity to meet my standards, but was still hearty and traditional enough for my less adventurous husband. I have made this again with fresh tomatoes and fresh mushroom that I added in together. Delicious! This is a family favorite. The only advice I have is to stick to the recipe. I tried a quicken it up once for a weeknight crock pot recipe and it was not even recognized as the same dish. The extra work is well worth it!

Rating: 4
I thought this was an exceptional dish; the meat came out exceptionally tender. I bought a roast that was a little over 4 lbs. and it probably only served about 4-5 people. The roast really shrinks, and I even trimmed a lot of the fat on it.. I used chicken broth in which to soak the mushrooms and it was fine. The best thing I did, I thought, was to put the leftover juices (which I didn't reduce down) in my Vita-Mix blender to blend to make a smooth sauce (I don't like chunky gravy). Definitely a four-forker and a recipe I will make again for sure.

Rating: 2
I thought this was good enough but, meh, nothing special. Made with fresh marjoram and tomatoes.

Good, old fashioned food. This is my parent's generation food (1950's) but on steroids! We seldom eat red meat, but craved some comfort food and made it exactly to directions. More putzy than the pot roasts of yesteryear, and not as good as truly good short ribs, but similar in taste with 2 days less work for me! Perhaps our roast had less fat, but we had no "juices" after roasting, just all the good mushrooms, onions and celery, tho cooked down. I also threw in carrots the last 30 min. As per the suggestions of others, we made it w/ the fennel mashed potatoes, which we loved. Use a good, deep red wine, as the taste of the wine does come thru.

I've made this several times. The meat comes out so tender each time. This time, I used a 2 lb. organic sirloin roast. I did not have the mushrooms so I left them out and added vegetable broth with the red wine. I used 28 oz. of organic fire roasted crushed tomatoes because that was all I had. Served with smashed red potatoes (softened with several tablespoons Earth Balance margarine and 1/2 c. rice milk), and steamed carrots and broccoli.

This was the first time I've made pot roast. It came out alright. I have to say I'm not a big fan of the consistency. Everything seemed ultra-mushy. The picture shows a well-formed piece of meat. My roast just crumbled upon touching it it seemed. My boyfriend liked it and said that was what pot roast was supposed to do, I still wasn't satisfied. I didn't care much for the shreds of beef and the pudding-like porcini mushrooms. The sauce was alright, I used a Cabernet and am thinking that if I ever make this dish again I'd go with a different red wine. Additionally, I wouldn't cook the roast as long as the recipe denotes. I'd cut the cooking time down by at least 20 minutes or so.

A heary, upscale pot roast that smells and tastes fabulous. I would add additional porcini mushrooms at the end of cooking because the long, slow-cooking method causes the flavor of the Porcini to become lost with the other aeromatics. Otherwise, fantastic.

This is easy to make (the pot-in-the-oven method is unusual, but it works) and it tastes as delicious when it's ready as it smells while it's cooking. My only quibble is that it's not very mushroom-y. The dominant flavor is more of tomatoes and mixed vegetables than mushrooms.

We are all pot roast fans in our family and this is DEFINITELY the best we've made. Luxurious is the best word to describe it.

Tried to make half beef quantity (2 lbs.) and cook for half the time, total 90 minutes, but meat wasn't very tender. Any idea how long to cook half the quantity? Willing to try it again, since the sauce came out very well. Also, shouldn't have defrosted the meat in the microwave. Probably a mistake. All advice welcome!

I've made this dish probably 6 or 7 times now. usually, i just follow the recipe exactly and serve with the fennel mashed potatoes. Simply amazing. every single person that i've made it for has absolutely loved it (multiple requests are the reason i've made it so many times). the only changes that i have made on occasion were; i will double the porcini and add them in two separate additions (just before going into the oven and about 45 mins. before removal), also i have had to sub the marjoram and use herbes de provence due to lack of availability of marjoram. I must admit that i think if you use fennel mashed potatoes, the herbes de provence are a better seasoning to use. otherwise this is an easy and comfy meal that nearly everyone will love!

I am not a huge fan of pot roasts, but I have to say this is EXTRAORDINARY! It is the epitome of "comfort food." I made a couple of minor changes, as others did. I increased the beef broth to a full 14 oz.;added the porcinis in the last 45 minutes of cooking because I wanted them to keep their shape; added some cut carrots to the sauce for something extra at the end; used dried marjoram instead of fresh. It's a great meal to serve for company because it does it's job in the oven for 3 full hours. Serve with mashed potatoes and a green vegetable or salad and the meal is complete!

First, let me say that I normally hate pot roast, but I have a friend that loves it, and was in need of some comfort food last weekend. I decided to make this based on reviews here, and I am now a pot roast fan (so much so, that I made the this again within a week!) The first time, I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of doubling the garlic and dried mushrooms, and substituting 1/2 Tb. Herbs de Provence for the marjoram. Served with garlic mashed potatoes....fabulous! Second time, made the same changes as above, used diced tomatoes (what I had on hand) and added carrots and new potatoes the last half of cooking time (per other reviewers suggestions)...once again, had folks raving.This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This is the fourth pot roast recipe I've made from this site this winter and all were well rated-- this is the best one because it had absolutely wonderful flavor but also because it's so easy. My meat was a bit larger than the recipe called for so I included the juice from the tomatoes as well.

Very good and very easy, though I started well before my guests arrived so wound up cooking it about 4.5 hours instead of 3. It only started falling apart during the last half hour. I was worried it would get dry, but that wasn't a problem. The mushrooms add some depth, but aren't obvious - if you want it to taste really mushroomy you'll need to increase the amount. My boyfriend ate it until he was ready to explode, and then couldn't stop staring at it because he still wanted more - I'll definitely be repeating this.

This is the pot roast of all pot roasts! Full of layers of flavor, and very tender. Porcini mushrooms were not available so I used criminis (baby Portabellos) instead. I left the lid on and this FAR from dry. Moist and tender. I removed meat from the pot, trimmed the fat, skimmed the fat and returned it to the pot for a few minutes. I served this with the Creamy Polenta recipie found on this site. This is the best pot roast I've ever had and serving it with the creamy polenta with smoked gouda put this dish over the top!

I have made this recipe several times to rave results. But I made a few changes to make it perfect for our tastes. First, I marinate the roast overnight in a 750 ml. bottle of fruity red wine, like Syrah or Merlot, along with 3 garlic cloves and 2 sprigs of rosemary. To prepare, remove the meat from the marinade, reserving, and pat dry. Then chop the onion, celery, and garlic cloves, along with 8 oz. of white mushrooms in the food processor. Brown the meat, and remove it from the pot, add the chopped vegetable mixture, and saute for 5 minutes. Then add all of the red wine marinade, including the rosemary and garlic cloves, the porcini, beef broth, tomatoes, and either the marjoram, thyme or herbes de provence. I also add 2 tablespoons of tomatoe paste, and a dash each of worcestershire sauce, soy sauce and balsamic vinegar. Bring it to a boil for 3 minutes, add back the meat and put into the oven. Halfway through cooking, I add baby carrots. And I always make it a day in advance. It is perfect after a day on the slopes, especially with homemade mashed potatoes!

At the last minute, I found that one of my guests couldn't eat mushrooms.... I butchered this recipe and it was Fabulous. NO onions, NO celery and in place of mushrooms, I chopped a can of OLIVES!!! It was wonderful, everyone loved it..

This is the best Pot Roast ever! I doubled the garlic. Left everything else the same. This is a keeper.

Delicious! My three kids and husband raved. Very tender. After cooking, I took the meat out and pulled off any fat from the meat and returned the meat to the gravy-I will use a gravy separater next time instead of just skimming. My oldest daughter said this dish was heavenly and requested it for her birthday in a few weeks. I made a few changes though. I doubled the porcinis and garlic, and I used an entire can of beef broth(15oz. I think). The store was out of marjoram, so I used 1Tbsp dried. For the wine, I used merlot(Yellow Tail). I also used two 2lb. cuts of roast instead of one whole piece, this was recommended by my butcher so the flavors would meld better. I cut up carrots, sweet potatoes, and yukon golds, tossed them with seasoning (I used Penzey's Northwest Fire) and roasted them in a separate pan to serve along side this dish. This recipe will go into my "keeper" folder.

The pot roast was quite good, but I didn't care for the sauce at all.

Finally! The pot roast recipe I've been looking for. Fantastic flavors and the meat is so tender. Will become a new staple.

Very good. I had never made pot roast before, but it was very easy to follow the directions. Everyone in my family loved it!

Despite splattering my arm with oil and accidentally squirting tomato juice on the wall (not my day), I found this a fabulous dish that I will definitely make again, especially for a chilly fall evening. I used brisket, dried majoram, and Trader Joes dried wild mushroom mix and added potatoes and carrots for the second half of cooking. (everything else according to instructions) Cooking can be pain, but the results are well worth it!!

My husband tried to get me to promise that I would make this every week! Make the recipe as directed and then put everything in the crock pot on slow for 8-9 hours -- delicious!

This was a very good pot roast, but I'm still not a fan of pot roast. The only modifications I made were I used dried majoram (unable to find fresh)and used veal demi glace (had on hand) rather than stock. The porcini flavor came through. I also pureed the vegetables and juices to make a "gravy". My sister and her family loved it. They couldn't get enough. Served with glazed carrots and garlic mashed potatoes. Kid friendly and adult tasty.

This was excellent. I did have porcini mushrooms and also added carrots and duxelles, which i usually have in sandwich -size bags in the freezer. (A great use for aging mushrooms.) I made it two days ahead and reheated it, serving it over egg noodles. Really, really good.

Wonderful! Great depth of flavor. Minor change - used fines herbes instead of marjoram. This has become my standard pot roast recipe. Quite nice served with soft polenta. Yum....

A rich, satisfying dish. Use porcini if you can. It was great with mashed potatoes, but I like the suggestions of adding potatoes and carrots to the dish while it is baking.

Very good. I added carrots.

Rating: 4
Yummy, and easy. I added carrots, and since I couldn't find the dried porcinis I just added your basic mushrooms for the last 20 min. To Marye5072 from Downingtown, PA- Keep the top on! If your roast is still dry when the time is up, put everything back in the oven until the roast is nice and moist. You could also increase the liquids some and/or try a smaller roast, but if you keep the lid on the roast will become nice and tender.

I've never been a fan of pot roast, but we both thought this was delicious!!I couldn't find porcini, so I used shitake. Added 10oz of baby bella during the last 15 minutes. Made with fennel mashed potatoes. Great dinner, I will definitley make this again.

Rating: 2
This was okay, not fantastic. I doubled the porcini mushrooms and still could not see or taste them after three hours in the oven. For all the expensive ingredients, this tasted like ordinary pot roast to me. Still, it was so easy to make, it's worth trying.

Rating: 4
I doubled the garlic, and it was fantastic!!!!! After removing the roast, I used an immersion blender to disintegrate the vegetables and thicken up the sauce. I also had to transfer the sauce to another container to cook, to prevent the cast iron from reacting to the acid, and giving it a metallic taste. I believe the best way to serve this is to shred the meat with two forks (or with your fingers), removing the fat. Then add back in some of the gravy for flavor. Then set it out with a gravy boat, and some biscuits or dinner rolls for roast beef sandwiches!

Question for everyone...Are you supposed to remove the cover during the second hour to hour and a half of cooking? My roast continually comes out very dry.

Rating: 4
I have now made this several times with different qualities of roasts. Each one has been delicious and tender. I substitute dried Shitake mushrooms as they are very inexpensive at Costco. I also put in potatoes and carrots for the last 1 - 1/2 hours of cooking for an easy and complete meal. I've even served this to my mother-in-law. Can't think of any higher praise.

To the cook from Cleveland: next time use a can of kidney beans instead of skirt steak. Now that's pot roast!

Rating: 3
I made this dish in the slow-cooker and used Bison roast (which is much leaner) to get the fat down. It was delicious - it's got a really good flavor and it was super-easy. Cleveland - no wonder it tasted horrible. Grape Juice and V8? Eeeewww.

Rating: 3
Cleveland, I know you are joking! I don't believe you substituted every single thing and concluded that this recipe is no good, but when you don't want to use alcohol, use vinegar for a little acid and skip the grape juice. Also, to all: I buy a huge (1 lb) bag of dried shitake mushrooms at Costco. I mostly grind them to a powder, and use them for braises and rice dishes, etc. They aren't porcinis, but they add great mushroom depth.

For anyone who made it the day before, recommendations on reheating the day of serving? Thanks!

Made it for my girlfriend and this was absolutely horrible. I substituted Welch's Grape juice for the wine because my girlfriend is Moslem. I couldn't find Porcini mushrooms so I used B&B canned mushrooms. Also I was out of tomatos so I substituted a cup of V8 juice and being out of onions and garlic, I just tripled the amount of celery. Also the store was out of chuck roast so I had to use skirt steak. It had to be the worst meal ever. Do not make this recipe!

This was a great dish. Eating it, I felt like I was dining on four star cuisine. I couldn't find porcini mushrooms, so I used canned mushrooms instead, the dish was still delicious. Definately a keeper. I paired this with fennel-mashed potatoes and all the flavors mixed well.

My boyfriend loved it and so did I, even though I'm not a big meat eater. I added some baby carrots and chunks of Russet potatoes for the last hour of cooking. There wasn't a lot of fat after I browned it. I didn't need to pour off any fat. Very flavorful and so a good wine is a must I think. A nice Fall dish. It was the first thing I made in my new Le Creuset French oven, and it was a success!

Very good and fairly healthy. I added some carrots and red potatoes for the 2nd 1 and 1/2 hour and had a complete meal.

Absolutely delicious. This recipe was easy to make, and it turned out perfectly. The meat was juicy and tender, and the sauce was full of flavour. I thickened the sauce a bit with flour & water at the end to give it that gravy consistency we like, but otherwise it was just perfect. I'll definitely be adding this to my list of "Tried and True" recipes.

The best pot roast ever! I thought I had reviewed this before and I can't seem to locate it, so I'll try again. I followed this recipe as closely as possible but I could not find porcini mushrooms at the store. I had to use crimini instead. I sliced them and added them at the end, as another reviewer suggested. I made it a second time but in the crockpot. I assembled the seared, seasoned meat with the tomato mixture, and cooked it on low for about 7 1/2 hours (I got home way too late). This may have been a tad too long, because the meat REALLY fell apart, however, the flavor was positively delish! I added a splash of the wine to the juices and reduced it in a separate pan on the stove before I served it. My sweetie raved and raved, and said he only wants this dish from the crockpot from now on! We aren't big garlic fans so I served these with roasted red baby potatoes seasoned with rosemary. Excellent comfort food.

This was outstanding. Incredibly tender and the porcini are wonderful. Definitely one I will make repeatedly

Followed the recipe to a T and it turned out wonderfully. After two hours of cooking, I realised the juices had reduced nicely. So, in this case there was no need to reduce juices on the stove-top. Absolutely delicious and tender. Definitely a keeper!

Never having made pot roast before, I expected my roast not to as good as those my mother or grandmother used to make. I was wrong - this was fabulous, and it made me look like I've been cooking pot roasts for years.

This is the best pot roast I have ever eaten. I failed to make a pot of gralic mashed potatoes, but won't happen next time. I have forgotten how much flavor dried porcini mushrooms can give a recipe! Yum, yum, I just may have to make this weekend since I am now thinking about it!

Wonderful. Having been a vegetarian for over 15 years, I am not a big cooker of meat. But this pot roast was a lot of taste for a little work. My husband (who has never been a vegetarian...) raved about it and says he'll never be able to eat his mom's pot roast again. But that'll be our little secret...

Rating: 4
Fantastic, simple dish. I made this in a slow cooker, about 6 hours on low. For those who ended up with tough meat, be patient and keep cooking on low, it will become tender. I also added the chopped porcini in the last 30 minutes of cooking as others had suggested, and they retained their flavor wonderfully. Also added baby carrots, next time I'll also cook the potatoes right in the pot. A keeper!

This was absolutely fantastic and easily put together! Bon appetite!

Excellent recipe. And very easy. I skipped the whole dried mushroom step and added freshly chopped ones 15 minutes before taking out of the oven. I also added a small amount of chopped up potatoes, carrots and yellow squash, only because I had them in the fridge, and it created a whole meal with just the addition of a little bread to soak up the heavenly juice. Even my finicky 12-year-old gave it two thumbs way up!

This was the best pot roast I've ever eaten. I did not have to reduce the sauce because it was perfect. I used a 3 lb chuck roast and cooked it for 2 &1/2 hours. I will be making this again that's for sure.

This is tasty, but can stand some simmple improvements. 1. Stir in the mushrooms with no more than 15 minutes to go. Otherwise, the taste will fade away and you've spent $3.75 for nothing. Other reviewers suggested doubling the mushrooms for that very reason. 2. Skip boiling the wine and stock after adding to the pot because they will boil down nicely in the next couple of hours. 3. Herbs de Provence is a suitable replacement for marjoram. 4. A generous splash of chili sauce is a suitable replacement for all those tomatoes. I made pot roast both ways in one week, and they were equally tasty.

This was delicious! Perfect comfort food. It can be prepared a day in advance, and isn't too difficult to make. I didn't make any changes to the recipe. This one is definitely a keeper.

I halved this recipe--the measurements and cooking time--for just two of us. I added some cut carrots, bell peppers, and onions to roast on a lower oven rack while this was cooking, so I increased the temp to 325 degrees to allow for a fuller oven, which is what it needed. To stress the main points already mentioned by others, check to see that the meat is falling apart b/4 you consider it done. Sometimes all it needs is another 15 mins. more to bring it to that point. I also increased the broth b/c I like more gravy. I would like to try this in a slow cooker as well, after all the prelimary browning steps were done. The taste was very deep, rich, and satisfying. Good to serve with potatoes, rice, etc.. What I like about dishes like this is that, although it takes some time to get things started, the end phase is effortless. It cooks on its own in an oven, and you can forget it. For that reason, it's a good dish not only for when you have a busy end to a day, but for enjoying company as well.

Didn't really find this worth the time and effort. There are a lot of other pot roast recipes out there with fewer ingredients and better flavour. I used canned, diced tomatoes to save time and thyme, instead of marjoram, but other than that, made it as written.

Rating: 4
Great recipe! I substituted a can of diced roma tomatoes instead of hand squishing whole. No problem. I also used a full can of broth and an equal amount of red wine (the more sauce, the better). I made mine a day ahead. When I took it out the next day I scraped the fat that had solidified, heated the sauce a little to liquefy, strained the solids and defatted the liquid with a gravy separator. Pot Roast can be very greasy! I then took about a quarter of the solids and put it through my mini food processor. Returning the liquid to the pot, I heated it up, worked the pureed solids back into the sauce and added a tablespoon or so of cornstarch to thicken it up. Drop the meat back in cover and reheat. Yes, that is allot of work but we all agreed it was the best Pot Roast we ever had!

I thought this was a very flavorful roast. It wasn't quite as tender as I was hoping for, but it got better then next day. Watch out when you're sqeezing the whole tomatoes into the pot- I got juice and seeds all over myself and my kitchen. During the last 20 minutes of cooking, I added some halved baby portabello mushrooms. Served it over mashed potatoes, which was great. The next day, I added more red wine to the pot and let it simmer for about an hour on the stove. Yummy!

I've tried pot roast a bunch of ways and found this version exceptional. As noted by others, it's better the next day. It's important to give it the full cooking time. Braised meats tend to go through a stringy phase if shorted on time, but become melt-in-your mouth succulent if allowed to come up to the temperature of the braising liquid. This dish is on my short list of terrific comfort foods.

I made this with the fennel mashed potatoes and thought it was a fabulous dish. In addition to the dried porcinis and substituted a porcini mushroom broth cube from Italy for the chicken or beef specified. This made the dish all the more flavorful. (Unfortunately these Knorr cubes are not sold in the US.) Next time, I plan to try this with brisket.

To answer the crockpot question. I've done it both ways and thought the results were similar (just to clarify for beginners--you still need to go thought the first steps before putting it in the crock pot). The crockpot is nice when you don't want to be tethered to the stove all afternoon. I serve it with roasted root vegetables. Delicious, casual comfort food.

Works in slow cooker. 8 to 10 hours on low. cut meat into serving pieces. Add tomatoes & wine so it just covers the meat. Can also add carrots, potatoes & parsnips

Babette & mmm1207, while I have not made this recipe, there is a recipe on this site (oven-braised beef with tomato sauce and garlic) that has similar ingredients and cooking methods that I have made frequently in the slow cooker. I alway sear the roast first, and cook on low for approximately 6 hours. You can thicken the sauce by removing the lid and turning up the heat to high for 15-20 minutes, while you tent the roast.

This is a wonderful, deeply-flavored meat dish. It is even better after overnight refrigeration, and it freezes beautifully. Winter food at its best! Today I'm in the process of making this for the second time. I made some very minor changes only: I cut the chuck roasts up into big chunks so I could cut out all the fat; I used 1 oz. dried porcini the second time because I felt the half-ounce called for was difficult to taste the first time; I used thyme instead of marjoram because I don't care for marjoram, and I used some of the juice in the canned tomatoes because I wanted more sauce.

I made this along with the fennel mashed potatoes and it was wonderful. As with most pot roasts, the flavor was even better the next day. A nice twist on an old favorite.
