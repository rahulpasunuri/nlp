I wasn't able to find cake meal,but I found premade meringues, so decided to use them. But, when I poured the sabayon in the meringue-lined pan, they all bobbed up from the bottom!!I turned them right side up and left them in a ring around the top of ther torte. No bottom crust. But it looked pretty snd tasred very refreshing. A nice, non-standard Passover dessert.

Great Passover recipe. This year I used frozen blueberries instead of blackberries and it still came out great. I found that I only need to cook my meringues for an hour and a half. Overall, this recipe is a little time consuming but worth the effort.

The sabayon came out great and it was a good combo with the meringue. Everyone loved it although it is a bit messy to serve and the berries can stain. Next time, I would make the bottom meringue the same size as the pan (i.e., not small individual ones). I am not sure how to handle the rest of the meringue for the top, but the individual dropped ones are okay, but not pretty. The recipe incorrectly says that two 1lb. bags of blackberries is 6 cups. It is only 4 cups, which did make the 2 1/2 cups of puree, but you need a few more berries for the sauce. I used the Silpat mats instead of the matzo meal for the meringues and they worked great. I also added lemon juice to the sabyon and to the sauce. This is not an easy recipe and takes some time, I made it over the course of 2 days. It is a once a year endeavor. The leftover sauce would be great with blintzes.
