Easy to make and delicious! I also doubled the filling for more satisfying results. Other substitutions that worked for this: a cupcake pan for an 8x8 pan, Gluten-free ginger snaps crust instead of graham crackers; and Agave nectar instead of Honey (tastes exactly the same) Came out great in the same baking time.

agree that filling needs to be doubled for a more satisfying taste! also in crust added one tsp. cinnamon for a delightful flavour.

I've just tested this recipe to see if we'll use it for an upcoming party & it's a hit. It's easy to make & we like the honey-lemon flavor of the cheesecake -- refreshing on a summer day. And, not too sweet, which we also like, as the flavors really can come through. True, the cheesecake layer is very thin, same depth as crust, but we're using this as a finger-food dessert at a party, so it's perfect for what we need.

I agree with many of the other reviews-nice cheescake, but too thin-even for a bite size dessert. Double the cheesecake portion and you will be happy with the results!

My family and I have enjoyed this recipe several times. The first time I made it exactly like the recipe but I found them to be too thin. I now double the recipe but keep the honey at the same quantity of 1/4 cup so that the taste remains light but bars taste a bit more like a cheesecake. I will be making it again this Thanksgiving!

I was very happy with the way this recipes turned out. The end result was much more lemon-y than I expected - but I loved it. I'm making them again for a bbq this weekend, and plan on doubling the recipes as well.

I followed the recipe exactly, and found it to be too think on the cheesecake side, and too thick on the crust. The flavors did mend well together though. I will keep trying to find another easy cheesecake square recipe.

This is a tasty recipe and turned out far better than I thought it would be. the lemon really makes the dish. One caveat though, be sure to get the old fashioned graham crackers. I couldn't find them when I made the recipe and had to substitute some crazy graham cracker with cinnamon, etc. and it almost ruined the dish. If I make it again I will definitely use the old fashioned grahams or not make it at all.

Really liked this. Got rave reviews at our Easter brunch. The lemon hits you right away and you get the honey as an aftertaste. YUMMY!!!!

This was very easy and quick. I followed the recipe exactly, I may try dry lemon zest and bottle lemon juice next time to see if it tastes as good.

THe lemon and honey flavors were awesome together. The consistency of both the cheesecake and the graham cracker bottom was perfect - had no troubles getting out of pan after cooling in fridge for 3 hours. Only thing I would change is doubling the recipe. Great bars to bring to a buffet/party.

Mine turned out perfect; followed recipe completely! Cut just fine. Loved the honey "twist", and I think they will be a perfect dessert for an appetizer buffet; just the right bite-size. Not actually meant to be the traditional, higher cheesecake. Enjoy! KIMBER

This didn't seem to have much flavour. Also it was extremely thin. I am sure there are better cheesecake square recipes out there.

It was okay. It was hard to get out of the pan. I suggest you cut it before it cools. Also, add more sugar to the mixture and more butter to the crust. Trust me!

the honey gives this such a good taste. Family really enjoyed it. Is a go for the weekend. Thanks
