Re: The stuffing. My grandma made this when I was young as potato "dressing", as the "stuffing" was bread, and in the turkey. Really great. I used celery and onion, sauteed with some garlic, about 2 cloves. Also, I used 1/2 teaspoon of Bell's Seasoning, which I have on hand, instead of herb. Came out great.

I made this recipe and got rave reviews such as, "restaurant quality"! What more could you want from a recipe? Spreading the roasted garlic on the chicken and vegetables really perfected the meal.

It was wonderful, very - especially the potatoes that were cooked in the bird. A little thyme and garlic slivers or paste under the skin of the chicken would make it perfect. (Note: a little thyme does go a long way!) Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing. Even flipping over the *hot* half-cooked bird, a real nuisance, is worth it for the gorgeous crispy skin. Next time I make this -- and there will be a next time -- I'll look for a jar of peeled garlic cloves in the produce department. (Between the roast veg and the mashed potatoes, one needs LOTS of peeled cloves of garlic. The recipe calls for three heads; we used three very large heads, all peeled, and the larger cloves halved afterward, and that was just about right.) But that's a matter of laziness, or efficiency, not a change in the recipe itself. We made a red wine-giblet gravy to go with the chicken and potatoes, and also served a green salad and garlic bread. I don't think anybody so much as reached for the salt or pepper. Everybody loved it, even my mother, and she hates parsnips and celery root - or rather, thought she did, until after learning she'd just eaten several servings.

This was one of the first recipes I made from Epicurious and a family favorite for several years now. I don't put potatoes inside of the chicken, but stuff it with herbs instead and it is fabulous. A very hearty and tasty meal, but time consuming to make.

The reviewer below who mentioned that this recipe needs "jazzing up" is WAY too kind. This recipe sucks!

This dish seem to have too much thyme in it, however; stuffing garlic into the skin of the chicken made the chicken quite good.

Due to my one of my parent's limited sodium intake (heart) I have been forced to use herbs creatively. For this Thanksgiving I made this dish and he loved it! As a result, we did, too. Nobody was bored.

Made this over the weekend and it was good but needed some jazzing up . Next time a little mashed garlic with olive oil under the skin and a little more flavoring in the potatoes. The root vegetables were delicious.
