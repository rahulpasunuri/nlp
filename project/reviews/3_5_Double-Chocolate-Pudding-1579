Mmmmm... CHOCOLATE!!! Only downside: I noticed a bit of a cornstarch taste, even though I was careful to keep cooking the pudding for a full minute after it thickened. Could have been my super-cheap store brand cornstarch, or maybe I should have cooked it a bit longer, or maybe I'm just oversensitive to cornstarch flavor. Nevertheless, it was super quick, super chocolatey, and set in about an hour in the refrigerator (no room in the freezer). The family loved having dessert on a weeknight.

Homemade and warm from the pan with whipped cream is divine

I made this recipe as a substitute for a more complicated chocolate cream pie filling. It is delicious! I did reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup as another reviewer suggested. One note: I quadrupled the recipe to fill 2 pies. The first pie was perfect, but the pudding in the 2nd pie stayed liquid and didn't set. My guess is that you have to cool the pudding in the freezer immediately after whisking in the chocolate for it to set properly.

Very easy. I added 1/2 square unsweetened chocolate and next time I would try without. Very creamy and rich. Just perfect for a chocolate fix!

I used 2% milk and even at that it was TOO rich. I love chocolate and never thought I would say that! :)

It is really tough to mess up a chocolate dessert. This recipe is just fine as it is. If you want to jazz it up with better/different cocoa, other types of chocolate, yah, go for it. Remember the adage "keep it simple" when it comes to this, however. Your guests will love it whether you use 72% cacao or Hershey's. A little homemade whipped cream never hurts, either....

I adore this recipe and make it every time I have an urge for pudding. It is very rich, however, and may not please everyone. My husband is a bit overwhelmed by its intense chocolaty density.

Now THAT'S an easy crowd-pleaser. Made it with equal parts skim and 1% and a splash of half and half because I had it in the house. Used 72% dark chocolate and it was a big hit. No reason to buy packaged pudding ever. I could see using this as part of a more complex dessert -- as filling a puff pastry shell, or maybe between some kind of tuile or with some crisp cookie. Just yummy.

I've been making this pudding for YEARS! I've always used skim milk and it turns out perfectly every time. I add almond extract sometimes and add berries on top when in season.

Easy and delicious. If you are trying to cut back on calories, use half the sugar and replace the rest with splenda. Skim or powdered milk works fine. Also, using dutch processed cocoa improves the richness. A tbsp of semi sweet chips also works fine instead of expensive solid chocolate.

I've made this twice today. The first time was for a cancer patient who needs calories so made with cream -- utterly decadent. And just now made again with skim milk, 2T sugar and just the cocoa powder, no add'l chocolate -- and somewhat to my surprise, it's quite simply delicious! This is extraordinarily versatile --

Loved it! Used skimmed milk and it still turned out velvety smooth and creamy. I will reduce the sugar by about half next time, but otherwise the proportions are dead on.

Forgot to add that when not too hot, this pudding makes an awesome ice cream topper!

Great pudding. I combine dry ingredients in bulk and can make this even quicker on busy weeknights. Use evaporated milk if you don't have whole! Comes out even creamier.

Delicious - this pudding turned out perfectly, smooth and chocolatey with just the right consistency!

Wow!! Came across this as I was weeding out old issue of B.A. Haven't made pudding for years, but this recipe will be a regular on our menu. My picky teen loved it, as did my desert-phobic husband. Unbelievable ease of preparation. Be sure to cover the top of the pudding with a sheet of plastic wrap to prevent the formation of a tough skin as it cools.

I've only made pudding once before, and that took about 30 minutes at the stove. This was done start-to-finish in 5 minutes and nearly as good. It's a great spur-of-the-moment fix for a chocolate craving. I used plain old Hershey's cocoa and a whole square of Baker's bittersweet chocolate -- I realize now that's a full ounce and probably why mine was extra-chocolatey! One note: there were still a few chunks of chocolate in the pudding, so be sure to chop it fine and stir it well. Think it would work to pre-mix the cocoa, corn starch and sugar in zip-lock bags for home-made instant pudding?

DELICIOUS And Easy. Our friends made it (using 2% milk) and it was so rich and yummy I wanted the recipe, and I don't even have a sweet tooth. I just made it for a dinner party for 10 people and they all wanted the recipe.

Great recipe. I used Extra Brut Cocoa Barry and 61% bittersweet chocolate to get an almost black colored pudding. Small yield makes sense since pudding sets up FAST! I quadrupled the recipe and found that after pouring the first 3 or 4 servings, it was getting lumpy. Reheating and whisking helped, but the recipe is so easy, it is worth doing in batches. Will be serving with two other puddings (butterscotch & five-spice) in small finger bowls!

I followed the recipe exactly and thought that it was very creamy and delicious! I'll never go back to the boxed, either. To the cook in W. Vancouver, BC....perhaps if you had used cocoa powder instead of chocolate chips your pudding would not have turned out "rubbery".

This recipe has become one of my regulars--it is easy, inexpensive, and fabulous. Definitely a keeper.

Quick and easy to make, but nothing spectacular. We thought the texture could be improved by less cornstarch. Also RE the last cooks comments, it is not too sweet the way the recipe is written. If you add more chocolate (especially chocolate chips) you are adding more sugar. We added a little extra chocolate and thus decreased the sugar a bit.

Far too sweet... after the sugar shock I realized that the proportions seemed out of whack... a 1/3 cup of sugar for a recipe that yields just under 1 cup of pudding??? Reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup and this should be more than enough. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips, which is easier for blending and adding more to suit every chocoholic (I used more than 1/2 an ounce). I really wasn't crazy about the texture either - it seemed kind of rubbery. Beware: this makes two tiny servings!

Was surprised as how easy it was to make - and how good it turned out! Definitely would make this again, I would like to know the caloric content of the dish though.

We love this chocolate pudding! I have been making it since the recipe appeared in the magazine. I dress it up with a little whipped cream and raspberries. Make this and you'll never make packaged pudding again.

Just made this as a treat for my chocolate loving husband. It is still warm and he is enjoying every bite. Way to chocolate for me, but not even for him. I did add a tablespoon of butter at the end, for a glossy finish.

Absolutely wonderful and very easy to make. A hit with adults and children - quite rich so you don't need to make huge servings.
