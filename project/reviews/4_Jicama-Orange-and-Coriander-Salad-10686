This was extremely fresh tasting and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and will be making this again. The only time consuming part was supreming the orange, although not difficult to do.

I haven't made this but it sounds great. I had to weigh in, though, because in so many of the reviews people are complaining of how difficult it is to section the orange. I'm imagining they must be doing it by hand, peeling the fruit then picking off the membranes. The best way to get sections of orange (or any citrus) in very little time is to supreme the fruit. You can see a demo here, for instance: http://www.youtube.com/watch? v=AjOEGQ18F-A. I don't use a huge knife like in this video, but I do use a darn sharp one, or else the membranes will collapse when you're trying to slice on either side of them. Once you've supremed a couple of fruits, it will be fast and easy. Happy slicing!

This recipe really surprised me. I followed the recipe exactly (other than removing all orange membranes), then tasted it to see what else it needed. This is one of the only salads I've made where I didn't adjust a thing-- I couldn't think of anything else that would improve it. The salad is very simple with no dressing at all other than a spoonful of lemon juice, but the flavors managed to be complex while still blending together well. It had a crunchy texture and a fresh and fairly intense flavor. The one small alteration was unplanned-- we got sick of trying to remove orange slice membranes after only one orange. With the others we just peeled or cut off any visible white parts. This still released some of the juice. When we were eating the salad, I didn't notice a difference between the slices we had carefully de-membraned and those where I'd been quick and sloppy. Overall, a great simple salad.

Definitely don't forget the toasted pine nuts -- they bring this from a solid 3 forks to a exceptional 4!

Crunchy jicama, sweet oranges, herby cilantro, a dash of salt. A light and refreshing side dish for an otherwise heavy Mexican meal. Forgot to add the pine nuts, but it was still excellent.

So refreshing! Light, simple (except for sectioning the oranges!), & crunchy Zero WW points, too. Served it with grilled vegetables and bbq chicken. As is I give it 3.5 points. The second time around, I doubled the cilantro and lemon juice, and added cayenne pepper and a touch of passionfruit juice.That combo is 4 forks. Retains the crunch the next day.

That combo is 4 forks. Stays cruchy the next day!

Simple and incredibly refreshing. The toasted pine nuts added a lot of depth -- this easy addition really improved the basic concept of jicama/oranges/lime. I used lime juice instead of lemon and peeled the orange as if to do supremes, but then simply diced the orange. This is a fast, great, and very different side dish for a simple grilled chicken/fish/whatever. Plus, my mom, who is an incredibly unadventurous diner, loved it.

Slight variation. We took sweet mandarin oranges and drained them, dried them off with a paper towel and they made the perfect companions to the red onions, jicama and coriander (cilantro). This is a very pretty salad to look at! Be sure to toast up the pine nuts. You've got soft oranges, crunchy onions and jicama, fragrant cilantro and roasted pine nuts. Even the 20 year olds thought this was tasty! Can't wait to make it again in the summer for a refreshing salad.

I doubled this recipe and thought I'd go out of my mind as I separated the sections from their membranes - very tedious and time-consuming! Buy large navel oranges - larger sections make the task easier. I pureed and strained much smaller sections and added the juice to the salad. I did not double the amount of red onion and fresh coriander (AKA cilantro), however, as they easily overpower a dish. The end result was delicious. The addition of pine nuts was pleasant but unnecessary.

I love this one, and I make it with a few changes. I don't use pine nuts, and I throw in some mango for a different taste.

I've made this salad several times and have never been disappointed ... everyone LOVES it. I agree that it's a nice alternative to the usual potato salad and cole slaw routine.

This salad ages well, almost better the next day when all the flavors have mingled. I added a few slivers of jalapeno. Delicious, low calorie, very refreshing and tasty. A really good substitue for cole slaw.
