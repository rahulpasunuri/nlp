I made several changes, so I did not rate the menu. This was very good, and I will make it again. Changes: Spiced and floured catfish, lightly browned and set aside (3 min each side). Sauted 1 chopped onion and 2 stalks of celery until soft. Then added garlic and spices, then tomato. I like spicy, but thought this was a too hot for a light fish, so I added sour cream to cool it down. The sour cream added a creamy touch to the sauce and toned down the cayenne. It still had some kick which was very nice. Next time I will try the recipe without the cinnamon.

This is an extremely healthy way of eating fish. The sauce has tons of flavour. It gained rave reviews.I usually pan fry catfish.Really enjoyed the fish. Will always use this recipe.

This sauce is so versatile and has received rave reviews each time I've made it. The first time I made it, I only used cumin seeds and not any of the other spices because of other things I was making with it. It was a little too salty and sweet for my taste though others really enjoyed it and asked for the recipe. The next time I reduced the salt and the sugar by 1/4 tsp each. I also used the sauce to roast chicken with potatoes and it turned out really well.

The people who are saying this is a spicy dish must have extremely sensitive palates, it is NOT spicy. The seasoning is very subtle. I stuck to the recipe exactly except for substituting nutmeg for allspice. The fish needed more time in the oven, about 15 minutes. We both loved it.

Sooooo Gooood!!! So quick & easy to make & so exotic & interesting. I have an oven proof saute pan that goes from stove top to oven so I use one pan for the whole recipe! What a creative way to use 'catfish' this is! I usually make Emerils batter fried catfish but now this recipe here is now another favorite of ours {Hubby loved it too}! I will make it often! Catfish is so affordable as well. In my oven it took the whole 12 min. to bake the fish through, don't overcook it catfish doesn't take long at all. I don't know why they catagorized this as 'American' cuisine, because it is clearly more 'Indian' than anything else in my opinion. I cook & love Indian food and this recipe is very much like it. In true indian cuisine 'fresh' ginger would be used, and 'Ghee' instead of olive oil, & probably no sugar would be added. And it would be topped with 'celantro' not parsley. A Keeper!!!

Great basic recipe. I've made it several times,always with a twist. Tonight I added onions and sliced turkey smoked sausage to the tomato sofrito. I decided against the cayenne and added 1/2 tsp of cajun fish rub, basil, sazon, and lemon pepper. I decided against the parsley and served it with fresh lemon-lime slices, a side of fresh spinach salad and a mango sorbet. DELISH!!

Significant other bought large quantities of catfish for unknown reason. Enter this recipe. Not at all what I expected, sort of reminded me of North African cuisine (sweet, lots of spices) but very good. Didn't think it was too hot - thought it needed more heat. Making it again tonight.

This was fabulous! I have made this twice now - once exactly as written (and we loved it) and the second time adding thawed okra to the dish. A keeper.

I made the full recipe of sauce, but used about 2/3 the amount of fish. I doubled the amount of spices, and then put even more in to taste. Put in three garlic cloves; this dish could have used more. It would have been really bland if I'd made the recipe as written. Once I got enough of the spices in, I liked the sauce. The fish was just eh, though. If I make this again (and I probably will, because I did enjoy the tomato sauce), I will probably bread and brown the fish before putting it in the oven. I served it with noodles and a side of broccoli sauteed with breadcrumbs. Yum.

Great, healthy mid- week recipe. I also used fresh tomatoes (about 3 big ones) and added more spices (particularly the cinnamon) and chick peas. Served over couscous. Perfect meal and save some for the next day. Leftovers are quite tasty!

I made this on a Weeknight for myself and my roommate. I did not have all ingredients so I substituted whole tomatoes for puree and diced some tomatoes. My roommate LOVED it! I saved some and gave to my boyfriend the next ( he does not like the taste of catfish) and he absolutely enjoyed this dish. Definitely a keeper. I really liked the taste and may try it with another fish. Very good recipe

Very tasty & very easy. I used chopped fresh tomatoes and tomato sauce (I didn't have canned whole on hand) and it worked fine. Since I had twice the catfish I doubled the recipe. Also made these substitutions/additions: chipotle & chili powder for cayenne, extra ginger (heaping measure), dusting of paprika prior to baking. I also seasoned the catfish with a dusting of Old Bay (so a salt reduction was in order) and smoked szechuan pepper (Penzeys has this with salt therefore additional reduction in salt required). The great thing about this recipe is that you can adjust the salt while making the sauce. It is quick easy, tasty & flexible. Everything a weeknight meal should be!

I have made this recipe many times, often with other fish. For guests who claim they don't like spicy food, I reduce the cayenne some. I also often add 1/4 tsp. smoked paprika, to good effect. Simple and delicious.

I used fresh ginger instead of ground ginger, started the pan at a low heat (thanks for the warning from Experimentor from Philadelphia), and I added 3 times as much sugar (I think it may depend on the type of sauce you use, and your preference, but I adjusted it to my taste). Oh, I also sprinkled some grated cheese on the fish just before I served, and by the time it got to the table, the cheese had melted nicely... It turned out amazingly!! The sauce is really the star here!! Definitely a keeper!! Quick, simple and Yummo!!

Simple and delicious. For two catfish filets, we made the recipe as written but reduced the tomatoes to a 14 oz. can of diced. No blender required and the spice was just right. Served with Lime Scented Rice (also from this site) using basmati. My husband doesn't even like fish but he loved this dish. This is a great and super easy weeknight meal!

I stumbled upon this recipe simply by searching for a 'quick' 'main course'. The word serendipitous comes to mind. I couldn't find catfish, so substitiuted tilapia. Served over plain, boiled rice with a simple green salad (delicately adorned with a light coat of an english mustard/rice vinegar/e.v.olive oil/fresh pepper and large whole sea salt crystals dressing) this had the table raving. Absolutely delicious.

This dish gets my 4 stars because not only is it easy and quick to prepare but the combination of the different spices was a flavorful surprise to my taste buds. I too used canned diced tomatoes which work well. I served it over polenta...Yummmmm

Great taste, even the kids liked it. I used a 16 oz jar of diced tomatoes and did not puree them. But next time I'll use the large jar and serve the meal with pasta.

I agree with last reviewer -- I used fewer tomatoes (about 20 oz) but same spices, and was glad I had. It was delicious! Also discovered we were out of garlic at the last minute, so used 1 minced shallot instead.

Needed to cut the amounts down for only two poeple, so halved the amount of tomatoes and left all the spices the same. Catfish holds up very well to the spiciness of the sauce.

Very good. I added some turmeric and some extra on the spices that were called for. I also used tomato puree to eliminate the blender portion, which made this recipe even easier and quicker. Definitely will make this again, specifically for my daughter who is an almost vegetarian with the exception of occasional fish.

It's good and fast. Though next time I'm gonna add some red wine and reduce it before I add the tomatos.

I made this with Basa (a type of catfish from Viet Nam) and it was very good. I also substituted chopped tomatoes to avoid the blender step.

I made this tonight and it was awesome! I used a can of crushed fire-roasted tomatoes, and I upped the spices a little bit. I served it with grits made with broth instead of water, and garlic sauteed spinach. I did find that I needed to cook the fish longer than the recipe specified. This is definitely a keeper - even my picky kids liked it.

I'd give it four forks but that would be cheating. It is a very good and simple recipe - great for a week night dinner. I've made it with both catfish(not our ususal favorite) and talipia and both were great. Use crushed tomatoes in puree to skip the blender step. A brown/wild rice blend is a good side.

This was a terrific dish, even though it almost smoked me out of my kitchen. I followed the recipe exactly but, heeding another reviewers comments, was a little generous with the spices. When those spices (especially the cinnamon and the cayenne) hit the hot oil -- whoa! The whole kitchen was filled with the smell and smoke. My boyfriend had to turn on every fan in the house and I had tears in my eyes for a while. Not sure if that was supposed to happen, but the end product was worth it. The sauce was very good and had a little kick. The fish was very nice (but I go to a high end grocer for my fish). Overall, very easy (even with the smoke) and very good. I served it over white rice. This dish will definately make another appearance in my kitchen!!!

If you follow the recipe, this dish will come out wonderful! A friend first made it for us and since then I have made it twice for guest. It's quick, easy and delicious. The only thing that I had to adjust was the cooking time. This dish has saved me durnig the season of lent, no more Friday night worries! Enjoy

I also had to cut the recipe in half for just my husband and me, but we were not impressed at all. Have to agree with the cook from NJ; tasted mostly like tomato sauce. Won't make it again.

This was absolutely delicious. I used tilapia as another reviewer did since I don't like catfish all that much and even my finicky boyfriend that doesn't like either fish, or spicy, or anything unfamiliar, loved it. Cumin gave this a somewhat indian finish. I had leftover sauce and used it as a pasta sauce the next night. It was definitely different but amazing.

Although the catfish came out tender and the recipe was easy, the sauce just tasted like tomatoe sauce out of the can with a hit or two of cayenne. I would consider making this again with either fresh tomatoes or with some of our homemade tomato sauce. Disappointing, but at least it didn't take a lot of work!

Very good weeknight fare, since it's a cinch to make. I did double most of the spices, because I wanted a little more kick. Served it over cilantro-spiked rice and a side of green beans sauteed with balsamic vinegar and olive oil.

This recipe was very average. My kids would not touch it and my husband tossed the leftovers. The sauce was O.K., but did not pair well with the catfish.

This is a fabulous recipe with just the right amount of spice. My husband and I just loved it. Have made it twice now, once with catfish and once with cod. both fish work beautifully. It's one of those dishes which are fast but make it seem like you've spent hours in the kitchen preparing agourmet meal. Served it with wild rice cooke with sauteed leeks and green beans. With a chocolate raspberry Pavlova for dessert. Fabulous dinner. Have passed this recipe on to everyone I know who appreciates great food FAST!

Wonderful sauce! I prepared this recipe for just my wife and I, so I halved things for the most part. We both enjoy spicy cuisine, so I used a bit more cayenne and garlic than most might. I held back a bit on the salt and only lightly sprinkled the fish before cooking. The end result was not lacking. The catfish fillets turned out nicely, and I can't wait to try this sauce on another mild fish. Definitely a must try for those with a curious and not too easily intimidated palate!
