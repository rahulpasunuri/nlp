This recipe has nothing going for it. Not enough fat, not enough cheese, too much nutmeg, too thin.

too milky and not buttery and creamy enough. I didn't like it. I also thought it was a wrong way around sauce, make a roux first, then add the milk or cream. I'm going to try "FionaMurphy"'s suggestion.

totally agree with the comment earlier. Cooking is one of my passions and have been doing it for a long time. I would seldom if ever pair cheese with fish.

I did what Fiona said except I used 1/2 Whipping Cream and 1/2 milk. If I am going to make this sauce, it will be rich. The sauce was fabulous. I tossed it with Fettucine/ shrimp and broccoli.

this is about a 2-3 forker, on the plus side it is light and not super rich however it has a pleasingly creamy texture and delicate flavor. However, it is a little bit whimpy as a stand alone sauce. I paired it with a flavor packed mushroom filled pasta and it was a great match. It does make a ton of sauce, so I plan to use it later over pasta with bacon, peas and sautéed wild mushrooms. I will also add more cheese to increase the flavor.

I tried this as it's the "wrong way round" for a white sauce - I would normally make a roux with the butter and flour, and then add the milk. Now that I have tried this I'm going back to the way I'd normally do it! Plus there's too much nutmeg and not enough cheese for a really rich flavour. Try my recipe: 1/4 cup flour and 1/4 cup butter mixed together in a pan until butter melts and the mixture (a "roux") is bubbling. Whisk in 3 cups milk and stir well until thickened. Remove from the heat and add ground nutmeg (1/4 tsp or less), ground white pepper, and 3/4 cup each of Parmesan and either Grana Padano or Pecorine Romano. Stir gently until cheese has melted into the sauce. Can be reheated gently if required. Much easier and nicer than this version and works well as a bechamel sauce for lasagna also.

i object to the suggestion of using this sauce with fish. In italy, one never combines cheese with fish, as cheese is beleived to mask the fish flavor.

At first we were not sure we wanted to make the sauce. After tasting it we were more than pleased with how it turned out. The recipe was halved since the original made so much. As neither of us are fans of nutmeg it was not used. Instead of 1% we used 2% milk. About 1/2+ cup of Parmesan was used and the sauce came out fairly thick. Since there was a container of button mushrooms in the frig that needed to be used up they were sliced and lightly sauteed then added to the sauce just before serving. It was spooned over sauteed breaded pork tenderloin slices. It was a good match with the pork and we plan to use the left over sauce with chicken later this week. We think it sauce would be wonderful with asparagus or other vegetables.

I was expected something with a kind of kick, maybe I was thinking of pecorino romano cheese. Either way, what I wound up with was more of a nutmeg cream sauce, even after adding another 1/4 cup of parmesan, which only served to make the sauce thicker. I don't think someone who didn't know would be able to identify this as a parmesan sauce. The other reviewer was absolutely right in saying that this is like an alfredo, not as cheesy-tasting as I expected. I guess it depends on what your goal is. If I were to make this again, I would decrease the nutmeg by a lot, and maybe experiment with some other, stronger cheeses.

I used skim milk and 'light' parmesean. Don't sit around waiting for the sauce to thicken on the stove..it will coat a spoon, but it's the cheese that will really thicken. A nice light sauce..a good replacement for a heavy, cream based alfredo sauce.
