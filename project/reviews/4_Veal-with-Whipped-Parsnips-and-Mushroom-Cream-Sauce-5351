Really loved this recipe. The sauce is a tiny bit thin so let it reduce a little. Add some dry white wine or light red wine to add some dept and some fresh rosemary. The whipped parsnips were amazing. Lovely dish to impress. And the parsnips never came out stringy for me.

I approached this dish slightly different, by first lightly flouring the veal and sauteing it quickly in butter and oil. I kept them warm and covered in my oven. I then used the same pan to saute the mushrooms, etc. And I used Light Cream instead of whipping cream. The sauce was a bit too thick so I whipped a few tablespoons of cold, unsalted butter into the pan at the end. That added a nice richness - perhaps it made up for using light cream instead of the heavy cream called for in the recipe. My family gave this 4 forks, I gave it 3.

While this recipe is not figure friendly, it is delicious. Using a pasta bowl, I spooned the parsnips on the bottom, then substituted salmon (sauted in a pan) instead of veal and placed it over the parsnips. Then I poured the mushroom sauce over them. As an extra, I added broccolini sauted with garlic on top. It was fantastic-- like something you'd get in a great restaurant.

The recipe I lost did not call for parsnips. I loved the veal in the whip cream sauce. It was company dish and a bit expensive to make, but I was proud to serve it.

Not only a simple dish to make, but one that is truly delicious. The parsnips were a great alternative to potatoes. I mashed them rather than blended to give them more texture. Will be making this dish for guests.

The parsnips were a lovely addition to a terrific and easy dish. Absolutely perfect.

This is the second time we've made this dish, and surely not the last time either! With so many choices of what to make, a recipe must really stand out to make it into the repeat file. This one definitely does. As a first course, we made Caramelized leek soup, also in the files here, and it was a great starter.
