I had planned to make this with green beans but couldn't find good enough produce in the market. Therefore I substituted asparagus. I also cut down on the butter a bit. The result was a good, standard dish, as you can tell by the recipe -- something easy to make with almost any dinner, but without intricate flavors. However it doesn't mean that I wouldn't make it again, it just wasn't a 4 fork recipe. To me, it was "good" which Epicurious assigns 2 forks.

we enjoyed how simple this recipe was. It was a great addition to the meal, without taking away from the other flavors.
