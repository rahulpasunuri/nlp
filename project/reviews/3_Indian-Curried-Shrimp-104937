Absent from among the suggested wine pairings for this lovely food is Guwrtztraminer. The only better liquid to wash down East Indian food is beer. Janrich

Whoever said this was bland doesn't know how to add salt. This is an awesome recipe! It's super simple and super flavorful. I didn't add the ginger because my ginger had gone bad...I added in some mushrooms and cauliflower and it was awesome! I totally will make this again.

This is a really horrid recipe. Bland beyond belief. I tried it once and swore I'd never cook it again...then I accidentally cooked it again. When I realized what I'd done, I started modifying it. Nothing worked. It's doomed. All ye who enter here will be disappointed. Blandness lies ahead. Beware! Turn back!!!

It is pretty good but I agree with the reviewer that the Thai one from 2004 is much better. However, next time I'll try adding more spices as it has a great deal of potential

Soooo good. Sooooo simple. So quick. This curry satisfied my desire for Indian curries that I remember from downtown New York restaurants in the 70's. I'm making a chicken version tonight.

Like many others, I found this quite boring, even with the added spices other reviewers recommend. It may be fixable, but it's probably easier just to look for a different recipe! If a non-Indian shrimp curry recipe will do, the "Thai Shrimp Curry" from Feb 2004 on this site is much better and almost as easy.

I followed some suggestions previously made by reviewers and marinated prawns, not shrimp with a bit of curry powder. I then added to the coconut milk base a bit of yellow thai curry paste, a heaping tbsp. of curry powder, salt and green peas at the very end. With the added ingredients, I think it definitely made a difference. I will make it again but with the mentioned changes.

We loved it. Easy to make, good for quick dinner. Doesn't require a lot of cooking skills. I did add chili pepper to it to make it more spicy though.

This curry is terrific...I have done it with the shrimp, but just made it with chicken breasts. Yummy! I added more curry, some hot sauce and much needed salt as well as some fresh peas for color and texture. This was really great!

Very easy and good... i doubled the recipe, and used 3 tmes the shrimp, so i added a pinch more curry powder, excellent!!! will try adding some vegetables in the mix while simmering next time.

Wife really enjoyed the cinnamon and the curry blending well not making it too hot. I used only 2 tsp of curry instead of 1 tbsp.

This was by far the best -- and easiest -- curry I've ever made, though I think it would come out bland with only the ingredients listed. I added red pepper flakes, cloves, and lots of salt, and doubled the amount of ginger. Also added yam (pre-cooked in the oven) to give it a little more body. So easy and as good as a restaurant curry -- definitely a keeper.

I added a small handful of those really hot dried red peppers and it made the sauce delicious! I also used light coconut milk to save a few calories, and it was really good. I will definately make this again, and maybe add a little more curry.

I have made this dish several times... The sauce, as others stated (and I agree) needs a little zip. I mixed in some Major Grey's Chutney. That did the trick. I also served it, as the reciped stated, with basmati rice and green beans... If you can't get nan (Indian flat bread) toasted pita bread works fine, as do papadums. You can get these in the international section of most grocery stores.

Indian food is our favorite and this dish was a perfect one for home. Easy to make and better the second day.

Recipe is a bit blah and I added more curry and some red pepper to spice it some

this recipe was ok but i would suggest omitting the curry powder and coconut milk and replace it with tika masala sauce. this will add the curry flavour the dish needs

As lots of people mentioned, this recipe is pretty blah as is. But with a few simple changes using ingredients I had around, it came out wonderfully. I used about double the ginger, curry and cilantro and substituted peanut oil for the olive oil. I also added approximately 2 TBS creamy peanut butter, 2 TBS brown sugar, and 2 tsp Thai red curry paste with the coconut milk. My husband was raving.

I lightened this by substituting low fat milk mixed with coconut extract for the coconut milk, and was pleased with result. This is a great quick and easy dinner!!

Read the reviews to get some ideas about how to make this better. I substituted the butter for the olive oil, doubled the curry powder, added 1 TBSP Thai Green Curry Paste. Used remaining ingredients and amounts with one notable exception. I was searching for a fast, flavorful curry recipe to serve with game. I substituted 6 chukar breasts, sliced into strips, for the shrimp. Mixed with 1 TBSP of Emeril's "BAM" seasonings. This will probably work for pheasant, prairie chicken, and sage grouse, (the last two being "tough" birds to work with.)

Found this to be good, but nothing remarkable. There was some depth missing to the flavor, even after adding more curry powder and some red curry paste. Couldn't quite put my finger on it...

Followed others' advice, increasing the curry powder by 1/2. Also, substituted canola oil for olive oil, as I don't think the flavor of olive oil would be authentic in a dish calling itself "Indian." I'm sure any flavorless vegetable oil would work well, and butter would probably even enhance the flavor.

A few adjustments made this a winner. Used only 2/3rds of the coconut milk, used a heaping tbs of curry powder, added tsp of garam masala.

I increased the curry and ginger. Added garlic, pineapple juice and golden raisins for a bit of sweetness and cayenne pepper for more kick. Also substituted fresh basil for cilantro. Served with chopped peanuts and mango chutney. It was delicious and very simple.

I added a sliced Granny Smith Apple, and some Curry Paste (availabale at gourmet stores), in addition to increasing the curry powder, and some Mango Chutney and pickled hot peppers! It was delicious , very simple and I would do it again.

All though the recipe is easy to follow, I found the taste too bland with only 1 tablespoon of curry. I marinaded the shrimp with 1 tablespoon and sauted another tablespoon with the onion. I also increased the ginger to 1 1/2 tablespoons, added 1 finely chopped jalepeno pepper as well as decreased the amount of coconut milk to 11 ounces.

This dish was very bland - I should have read the comments before making it! Also, it didn't thicken up the way I like.... I think I will try it again but adding spices and less milk. It is an easy base recipe to begin with though!

Rating: 3
Based on the other comments, we added a chili pepper to the dish to help fill out the flavor. It combined well with the smooth taste of the coconut milk. We also upped the ginger and curry, but just slightly. It is now my favorite curry recipe.

Used this with some leftover shrimp and it was quick, easy and delicious. We did serve it with some of the traditional condiments--some chopped peanuts and chutney, and they probably did enhance the dish. We'll definitely have this again.

to mreaganwhalen: There are many options for spicing up a simple dish like this. if by spice you simply mean that it was lacking heat from hot peppers or chiles, you can add a sliced green chile pepper (jalapeno). or maybe just 1/2 of one, considering the dish is for two people. if it's more spice/curry flavor that you want, then the easy way to go is to increase the amount of curry powder that the recipe calls for. 1 tbsp isn't a lot. that could easily be doubled without killing the dish. or maybe the curry powder you're using just doesn't have the right zing, or perhaps it's a little old? maybe find a different kind -- go to an indian store and see what they have. i would suggest a garam masala blend for a really rich flavor. if i were making this recipe, i would also increase the amount of ginger, cos i love ginger, and i would add a few cloves of garlic as well.

I tripled the recipe yet only used 1 can of coconut milk and let it reduce. It was delicious!!!

Bland, Bland, Bland!!! Very easy to make but lacking flavor big time! I'm not an experienced Indian cook, but this recipe was definitely lacking some zip. I'm sure there must be something out there I could use because I like curries and I liked the ease of this recipe. My husband and I both used alot of black pepper on the finished dish and it made it bearable, but some other spices are absolutely called for. If anyone has any suggestions, please e-mail me. I'd like to try this again with changes.
