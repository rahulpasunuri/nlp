totally excellent as written. after making it a couple times I have changed it some and would like to share that version. the quinoa suits us just fine with being rinsed well and cooked 1cup quinoa to 2 cups liquid for 15 min. Perfectly fine. I know when I have fresh lime on hand it is the way to go but we tried using some key lime juice in the bottle out of the fridge ..3Tbsp and it stood in just fine! Another substitution I made that was good was a can of organic tomatos with green chiles instead of fresh. Surprisingly good. We also like to kind of coarsely mash about half the beans too. Oh, and running short on green onions I threw in some finely chopped red onion and it was perfect! So many things you could do with this basic recipe to make it your own. I love it!

No need to make cooking Quinoa that complicated. Just boil it until it is tender. To make this healthier just use olive oil instead of butter and vegetable oil and skip the sugar.

This is one of my favorite go-to recipes. I serve it as a side dish or a salad, and often take it to potlucks as I think it's good at room temperature, and it doesn't need heating or refrigeration. Steaming the quinoa really does make a difference, and it's really not much of a hassle. I do make one change though. I use 3 tablespoons (or usually a bit more) of good quality olive oil instead of the combination of butter and vegetable oil. I think it works better as a salad this way. It can stand a bit more lime juice too. I usually use the zest and juice of a lime, but this does depend on the lime of course. Halved cherry tomatoes work well instead of the diced ones for an attractive presentation.

Very tasty dish,but as usual not having all the ingredients i had to improvise.I added to boiling quinoa some ground coriander and turmeric,and some grated ginger.After the quinoa was done i mixed in the butter,oil, lemon zest,lemon juice and half of a green chilli pepper,plus the chopped tomatoes and 1 chopped bell pepper as well along with the black beans and chopped coriander leaves.I will definitely try it again and be creative.

A really good recipe that leaves room for substitutions: I ended up swapping blood orange olive oil for the butter, mirin for the sugar, chives for the scallions and mint, oregano and parsley for the cilantro. Also put in some freeze dried corn along with togarashi, Japanese 7-spice powder for a little heat. I know! Different, but absolutely delicious.

Rating: 4
Great recipe, although I made some modifications. I didn't understand what butter was doing there, so I substituted 1 Tbsp grapeseed oil; also used grapeseed instead of vegetable oil. I folded in baby spinach and bumped up the lime a bit. I had leftover roasted garlic from another recipe and thought what the heck, add that too (about 2 cloves). Worked great as a main dish for two hungry people.

Loved by all - tho not the 3 year olds. Seriously fluffy quinoa!! Lid doesn't have to fit pot. Put quinoa in cold water and bring to boil. Lime, coriander, black bean is always a great combo. So versatile you can add whatever bits and pieces you have: left over grilled veggies, chickpeas, red onions, chicken etc. A keeper.

The dish was delicious - I used a touch more lime juice and added the kernels 3 ears of fresh summer corn. I made sure to add a good deal of freshly ground pepper, but otherwise I think the taste was subtle but definitely not bland like some others thought it was. It is better cooled to room temperature or chilled.

Made this recipe for a pool party and everyone loved it. As a previous reviewer suggested, I added Ancho peppers in adobo sauce and the added kick was really nice. I also made a version with garlic and cumin for those that don't like it hot. Both were delicious as leftovers cold or, even better, heated as a side dish.

I made it exactly as written and it was pretty good but still needed something. Next time I made the dressing with olive oil, lime juice and zest, cumin, and omitted the sugar. Replaced scallions with diced red onion and added corn for sweetness. Much better and a little healthier. Using a dish towel while cooking the quinoa really does make it much fluffier and a whole lot better.

When I read this recipe, I thought the multi-stage quinoa cooking process was a lot of fiddly fuss and bother. But I tried it anyway and I'm now a convert. Plain old boiled quinoa was never this fluffy and light. I enjoyed this as a main course -- it's substantial enough to be a light and satisfying lunch or supper.

I love these kinds of recipes that are healthy, simple and very adaptable to personal taste.

Turned out great!

I have been searching for a way to make Quinoa for months. Usually I find Quinoa to be watery and bland. But the technique using a scieve is hands down the best answer. Mine turned out great! It was dry and fluffy like promised. I used vegetable broth, royal quinoa,spring onions and wonderful heirloom tomatoes. Tomatoes can make or break a dish. This is a great dish and making it helped me to see how I can expand it into other good quinoa versions. I highly recommend it.

It just didn't have any zip for me, just tried it the next day hoping that would help but it's still quite bland. My tomatoes weren't that great and the cilantro was super flavourful but even taking that into account there are too many great quinoa recipes out there to try this again.

This dish was very simple and tasty. I didn't use exactly what the recipe called for because I was just using things I had around the kitchen. I didn't have limes, lime juice or cilantro. Instead I just sauteed some garlic and tomatoes in butter and oil, then mixed that in with the quinoa and black beans. Served on a bed of lettuce with raspberry vinaigrette. I found this to be a great starting recipe that I could vary according to what I had. I'm sure the lime and cilantro dressing would be delicious though!

This side had a nice combination of flavors and went well with the grill pork chops with garlic lime sauce. I left out the black beans and didn't miss them. Also, I cooked the quinoa as I would rice. I'm not sure what the steaming would have done for it.

I love this recipe and have made it many times now, EXACTLY as written. I really think the butter should not be substituted with EVOO, the butter emulsifies with the lime differently than EVOO and lends a richer taste. 2T's will not hurt you :-)

I added a chipotle pepper in adobo sauce, more lime juice & substituted for some miso in the dressing. I also added germination (lentils & mungo beans) in the salad. I didn't had much quinoa left, so I added lots of bulgur. Yum! My whole family loved it!

The first time I tried this, I used the exact recipe and it was WAY too salty. This time, I cooked the quinoa per package directions and didn't add any salt to the cooking water. I also subbed olive oil for the butter, added 1/4 cumin and feta cheese crumbles. The 2nd time was a winner! Delicious!

This is a good base recipe. My changes include..more lime juice than called for, more lime zest, olive oil in the dressing, avocado, CHERRY or sweet yellow tomatoes, red onion,sweet bell pepper in small bits, cook the quinoa in chicken broth, and if you MUST have meat, I add cooked sweet Italian sausage meat to the dish. Must admit, I like the caraway seeds from the meat in this dish.

Agree this was good, but not as great as I expected. Funny, too that these are all my favorite ingredients. I think overall the flavor was a bit too sour. A tad over the top with the lime and nothing to balance it. Cumin would be a nice addition. Will continue with my quest for good quinoa recipes!

This was good as a lunch for myself, but it's not amazing, and I wouldn't bring it to a picnic/potluck without doing something to increase the flavor. I left out the sugar, but I did a lot of other things to increase flavor and it still needs more, I think. I used red onion instead of scallion, cooked the quinoa in homemade chicken stock, used olive oil instead of veg oil, salted instead of unsalted butter, and more salt and pepper than called for. Maybe some cumin or coriander would help? A little cayenne?

Awesome and easy recipe! I doubled it, because the flavors get better with time, and it makes a perfect protein packed lunch. Instead of salt, I used Adobo salt and garlic seasoning, and I cooked the quinoa according to the package directions instead of the elaborate steaming method included in the recipe. I just cooked it in my rice cooker and it turned out perfectly. Also, many quinoas these days are pre-rinsed, so check your package to avoid time comsuming rinsing. Also, I think you could leave out some of the fat (maybe cut it in half) because it is just SOOOO good and refreshing. This recipe will be part of my regular rotation now!

My kids LOVE this recipe...it is one of their favorites. We all love the blend of lime and cilantro. Sometimes we eat this as our main dish for dinner. High in protein.

I tried to follow the directions in the recipe exactly for making the quinoa, but I found it came out kind of sticky.

Don't bother melting butter (use olive oil) or the 2-part quinoa prep instructions (follow the directions on the package). I added a sauteed onion, jalapeno, and portobella mushroom as well as some chopped cilantro and cumin. So good I can't believe it's vegan.

My new go-to potluck recipe. Delicious exactly as stated. I've made mistakes different times making it, and it suffers them all beautifully: used red quinoa once (yum), melted the butter but left it next to the bowl and left it out on accident (couldn't tell), and have added cumin too. You just can't go wrong. The lime for me turns out to be equal to the zest of one lime. I rinse the quinoa and boil the water while melting the butter before prepping all the ingredients, to save time. Mmm.

First quinoa recipe. We were surprised how very much we enjoyed this and how much we're looking forward to leftovers.

Love this recipe! It is the perfect salad for warm summers. Every time I've taken this to a party or to work it has received rave reviews. Easy to make, easy to double or triple and travels well. The only thing I've added to this is more vegetables in the form of red and yellow bell peppers.

Holy Moly! This is very delicous! Depending on who will be eating it, you can make many additions to spice up or add more veggies. I am a newbie to Quinona and this was my first learning experience with cooking the Quinona itself. Very interesting process! It is well worth the rinsing several times before cooking and the steaming after. Can't wait to taste it tomorrow.

I cooked my quinoa in a rice cooker and it worked fabulously. Then, I added the dressing and veg and served it still warm.

This was my first recipe made using quinoa over a year ago. It is a really exceptional dish. I attend culinary school as a pastry major and am always apprehensive when cooking for my culinary friends, but everytime I make this dish, it gets raves. The flavors only get better the longer it sits. I have also substituted the fresh tomatos due to a mistake in my grocery list and have used a can of diced drained tomatos. Still pretty great!

This was my first stab at using quinoa and I prepared it as written like many others, except that I used extra cilantro, which never hurts anything IMHO. The taste was light and fresh and went well with the grilled chicken I made.I purchased pre-rinsed quinoa which saved some time. You basically cook it like rice. Also, the longer it sat and got closer to room temperature the more pronounced the flavors became. My suggestion is to mix it all up and then let it sit for a while and let the flavors mingle. Will make this again and maybe play with the ingredients a bit.

Far tastier than the recipe might suggest--tangy and so yummy. Is kind of like tabouleh--tangy, with a similar texture. Followed recipe to a T except for tomatoes, which for me are out of season. Substituted red bell pepper with great success; the sweet taste and crunchy texture went well. Wondered about using butter, thinking it'd taste weird with the other flavors, but it was good, softening and rounding the tart and earthy aspects.

I love this recipe and have made it numerous times. My guests love it too and usually want the recipe. I make my quinoa in the rice cooker with the same ratios as white rice, 1 cup quinoa and 2 cups water and I omit the salt as it makes the dish way to salty. I then let it cool before adding the dressing. I usually make a double batch of quinoa and add a can of corn and some feta. I don't double the beans or the tomatoes. I also use olive oil instead of vegetable oil and I do not usually double the butter in the dressing when I double the recipe. I usually add more zest than called for as well. This recipe is one of those recipes that you can play with till your hearts content and you wouldn't mess it up...except by adding too much salt which I did the first time I made it:-)

I use olive oil and generally don't use much sugar if any (my husband likes it without the sugar). I also triple the cilantro for health reasons (a molecule in cilantro can cross the blood-brain barrier and remove heavy metals from the brain, like aluminum) and we both love it. Quinoa is a perfect grain: no gluten and a complete protein. What more could you want? Its tasty and healthy! Try it you'll love it!

This recipe is superb and can be easily modified to fit your taste or satisfy your curiousity. We added feta cheese which we think was necessary. Paired very nicely and gave some contrast in taste and texture. Diced red pepper and sweet yellow corn would also go nice. Dressing is very nice and subtle. The dish is very satisfying but light at the same time. Makes an excellent picnic or potlatch dish. Enjoy!

I made this for my first foray into quinoa and was really happy. I chickened out on the cooking method and went with directions on the box so it was probably a little more gooey than fluffy, but still tasted amazing.

Delicious summer meal. I've combined this recipe with other quinoa/black bean recipes I've found, by adding avocado, fresh corn and colored peppers.

A really good, useful recipe. I've always had problems getting quinoa right and this method really works. I adapted the recipe, using a small can of Berlotti beans, cherry tomatoes and French beans for the added vegetables.

I make this recipe all the time, but I always add a few extra things. To the dressing, I add 1tsp of chipotle chile powder. To the salad I add some roasted chicken and some quickly sauteed corn. I usually top the whole thing off with some cubed ripe avocado. One dish meal! A side note to the reviewer who leaves out the butter: butter IS healthy. It adds a new dimension of flavour, and is a healthy part of our diet, in moderation, of course.

Tasty and easy, but not mindblowing. Can be a good, healthy (minus butter) accompaniment to some big flavours, but don't expect it to be the star of the show.

I found the flavors in this quite bland. Had to add cumin to make it taste right, and it still wasn't all that great. However, it was much better cold on day 2, after a night in the fridge. Make a day ahead with some added cumin and eat as a cold salad if you want this dish to knock your socks off.

Omg, delicious. Ive been looking for a way to make quinoa delicious and this is it. I added the salt to the dressing and that seemed to work well. One of my new regulars.

Glad to see others skipped all the extra steps & still got good results. I was about to can it due to the hassle of washing 3 times,boil first, then steam, etc. The result is fantastic but next time a cup of quinoa & 2 cups water go in the pot & boil 20 minutes. Period.

The lime and cilantro are perfect - even those who are not yet big fans of quinoa liked this combination.

This is an extremely easy recipe and easy to modify. I didn't steam the Quinoa. I simply cooked according to package directions in water. This allowed me to omit the oil and butter. I upped the seasoning by adding cumin, coriander, Mexican Orgeano and Mexican Basil and roast garlic and roast bell pepper. Used Lemon Lime combo as well. Fast. Easy. Good. It's a keeper for us.

Love this dish and so does everyone else whenever I make it. I've used lemons before when I didn't have limes and it tasted fine. I use olive oil instead of butter, but other than that, this is my favorite side dish. So healthy too! Oh and I use a rice cooker for the quinoa, just two cups of H2O for every cup of quinoa.

Very tasty and easy. I had enough quinoa for a second batch and didn't even look for an alternate use for it--just made this recipe a second time. I like a little more lime juice to increase the tang, and a little kosher salt is nice. Makes a healthy, easy lunch the next day, too.

I make this dish constantly, and each time I'm asked for the recipe. I have it down so it takes me 5 minutes. I keep everything I need for it in the pantry. Substitute Muir organic fire roasted diced tomatoes for fresh, add lime zest (Meyer lemons are yummy too), and make the quinoa from box directions. Lasts 4-5 days in the frig and is delicious cold. Second day I add diced avocado and chicken or shrimp for a cold meal-in-a-bowl --- feta and Greek olives for vegetarian. Also toasted almond slices.

Couldn't agree more with Cindysphinx, just treat it like rice...heck it's easier than rice! 10 minutes on low simmer. I didn't use butter, didn't see the point. Just use olive oil to mix with the lime juice & yes double the juice. Really delish!

I just made this for the first time, and it is delicious. I haven't read all 180 previous reviews, so apologize if this is repetitive but...although delicious as written, as a person who likes spice I would suggest adding a little cumin and either cayenne pepper or some slivered serrano pepper to the dressing for some extra flavor.

WOW. I made this recipe with beautiful farmer's market tomatoes, and made a few little tweaks for an amazing dish. I used more lime - about 3TBS, and omitted the butter, and instead using light olive oil in the dressing. Didn't have any scallions on hand, so I subbed in 1/2 cup of chopped red onion. Also added 1/2 cup of roasted corn kernels, 1 jalapeno, and 2 cloves of garlic. I cooked my quinoa in my rice cooker, and it came out perfectly. I could see adding diced bell pepper too, and might if I have them on hand next time. And there will definitely be a next time. Will be perfect picnic food!

Made this as directed but added extra lime and zest and used ugly ripe tomatoes. Really excellent and easy. Will add some crushed red pepper and garlic next time. I found no need for the elaborate treatment of the quinoa. I just followed the instructions on the bag and made it as I would make rice.

i added sauteed zucchini and squash in the end, as well as fresh garlic in the dressing. i didn't have scallions, threw in a few tablespoons of apple cider vinegar, extra lime juice, and a diced jalapeno too. the steaming was great... i also doubled the amount of quinoa and tomatoes. it was delicious, i'll be eating it all week. very recommended.

Rating: 3
I forgot to add, if you cook the quinoa in an electric rice cooker it comes up fluffy and this recipe is a cinch! We use 1 1/2 cups of water to every cup of quinoa. Washing it is easiest if you put the dry grains into a fine strainer/sieve, then submerge this in a bowl of water (taking care that the grains don't overflow out of the sieve into the bowl) where you can rub the grains with your fingers before draining/rinsing - if you wash it three times as specified, this should get rid of any bitter taste.

Rating: 3
This was very nice - we ate it on its own as a light lunch. As suggested in other reviews, I added extra lime juice and some garlic to the dressing and used 2tbsp olive oil instead of the butter/oil mix. I also tossed in a can of sweetcorn.

i was very pleasantly surprised by this dish. granted, i forgot the butter and used garbanzo beans since i didn't have any black beans on hand. it was a little bitter for me... in the future i might add more sugar or some cumin for a kick. that said, this is an excellent weeknight standby. it will be fun to play around with ingredients! i might even add some arugala next time.

This dish is amazingly good! I had a Mexican dinner party (full of meat lover attendees) and this was the first dish to vanish! The flavors are well balanced and the texture is wonderful.

Great dish for summer! I made it a few hours ahead of time so that I could enjoy time with my friends - I just mixed dressing (2 T EVOO instead of butter and veg oil) and rest of ingredients minus the quinoa & beans. Then when ready to eat, I heated the quinoa just a bit, added to dressing mixture, added beans and tossed with 1/2 an avocado. Wonderful! Since I served it with a spicy pork tenderloin dish, I didn't add heat, but I will definitely try jalapeno next time! Fantastic dish to have in the fridge for healthy snacking.

Rating: 4
Very good and easy to make. I agree that it seemed to make a lot more than 4 side dish servings. I also omitted the butter and boiled the quinoa for 15 minutes in vegetable broth, skipping the whole steaming part. And, it was still excellent. Even my usually vegetarian-adverse husband really liked it.

We have fallen in love with quinoa as a healthy, quick grain alternative. We made this recipe minus green onions since none on hand, and no sugar because I forgot. We added fresh toasted pecans for a little extra crunch. It was satisfying and flavorful without being heavy. Delicious! Note: generally, we boil the quinoa in veggie or chicken broth for a fuller flavor (not for this recipe).

I guess I should've read the reviews before trying this one.

To be honest, I didn't really know what quinoa was before I made this recipe, but it fit in with the menu I was building and the photo looked tasty. I cooked it according to the box directions and it came out fine, though I think I overcooked it just a little. The lime dressing is good, though I might add a little something extra next time to punch it up. I wasn't planning on using the butter, per the other reviews, but I added it at the end to add a little flavor. Some garlic powder, extra salt, or some hot pepper might do to add a little extra flavor. All my guests loved it, though.

I think I would like this with another grain. I could not get the quinoa to be fluffy, even with the tedium of the rinsing and cooking with the dishtowel and the sieve. I did add extra black beans, extra lime for the dressing, and a bell pepper which helped a lot with the flavor. I will keep watching this recipe to see what other variations everyone employs.

This was my first time cooking quinoa and this recipe was SO GOOD!! I loved the lime dressing so much it just left me wanting more. I have made it three times now and I used two small limes (which is about four tablespoons) and add another half teaspoon of sugar in the dressing. My sieve has a plastic handle and rim and melted the first time during the steaming step. Subsequent times I found that if I poured some of the hot liquid into a bowl that the sieve could fit in (above the liquid), and then put the bowl in the pan, the liquid was hot enough to steam the quinoa without turning on the heat. Covered with towel and lid as recommended and it came out great, fluffy. I used about a half cup of vegetable broth in my boiling water, just enough to give it a little flavor. Otherwise followed recipe and it's just delicious. My only problem is that I eat it all within the first few hours! Thanks for this great recipe. I love knowing that this dish that tastes so good is also so healthy.

Wow, this is a keeper recipe. I am not a fan of some of the other grains, but quinoa is a HAPPY NEW FIND! In deference to some contributors who prefer a review based on the original recipe; I dare to add this. Mid Wisconsin winter, there is no really acceptable replacement for fresh tomato. So, I used sun dried, softened in boiling water, which was very nice, adding an almost smoky flavor. This recipe is fantastic! Could also use chopped onion, cooked til clear, in replacement for the scallions. The cilantro and LIME are key. but others have recommended parsley if you don't like cilantro. can't wait for the summer to have this with "jerked chicken", or maybe a grilled fish. I think you could try this with some left over pulled pork, too.

There are good fats and bad fats my friend. Butter contains more saturated fat than say, olive oil.

Rating: 0
Good grief, people. Could we please stop equating "less fat" with "healthier" and "fat" with "unhealthy"? Fat is not inherently unhealthy. Your body needs it. Furthermore, fat equals flavor, ask any chef. When you omit or reduce fat from a recipe, you are NOT making it "healthier" - you are making it less flavorful. And by the way, food cannot be "healthy," since it is not alive (well, not usually and not for long after you eat it, anyway). The correct word is "healthful." I'm going to make this for a Xmas Orphan lunch. I expect it to be a big hit, with all that lovely flavorful butter.

I like the idea of this recipe, but it needs more zing. I may have overcooked the quinoa, following the directions on the box to use my rice cooker instead of the instructions in the recipe, so that might be the issue.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I'm a fitness model(female) and I was looking for some great recipes for quinoa. I never had it but I know it's over flowing with protein and it's the top grain for carbs and protein. I wanted it to work and be light. I can't eat heavy food. I rinsed the quinoa about 5 timse, so my rinsing was a more thorough and I cooked it through for 15 minutes, using 14oz. chicken broth with roasted veggies, but you could use plain vegetable broth. I like broth because of the richness it adds to grains, I chose beef but any will do. You can replace the water quantity with broth or follow my steps which was 14oz broth and 10 oz water. I ran out of broth, that's why. After that I just added the veggies and tasted it, it was devine without the dressing. The dressing is truly not necessary to the entire recipe. So if you want to live without it, you can. I think it's because my broth was so flavorful that the added dressing was over powered. You'll totally enjoy this meal and it's a staple in my diet.

I made a big mistake by not following the recipe for cooking the quinoa. To be really good the quinoa has to be dry and fluffy.

Pretty quick and easy, and I had everything in the pantry for a weeknight dinner (ok, except cilantro, which it sorely needs).

The preparation of the quinoa as described was intimidating, so I just followed the directions on the box: boil water, add the quinoa, reduce to simmer and let cook for about 10 minutes. I wish I had more than one can of beans. I added sundried tomatoes for some sweetness, tossed in some kalamata olives for some saltiness. Used olive oil instead of butter. For the leftovers, I added salmon and bell peppers. First time cooking with quinoa, and found it pretty easy. Will make again.

It was good, but not great. Better the next day. My husband and I weren't knocked out by it, but ate it because it is so healthy. I might use the leftovers in a stuffed fish recipe. Otherwise, I don't think I would make this again.

Awesome salad. A couple of things-- I prefer using lemon to lime and I upped the amount of lemon juice and zest, and added some cayenne which I tend to add on everything. Oh, and I used black soy beans instead of black beans. Everything tasted great, however, it can't stand on its own as a meal. The depth of flavor is not enough, and so I prefer to have it as a side to a tuna sandwich or another protein. The freshness of this salad really brightens the taste buds and boosts the flavor of whatever else it is you're eating it with. I will definitely make this recipe again and again.

My husband and I loved this when we made it. However, we made enough to have left-overs. . .that didn't work as well. So make this, but eat it all right away!

Great, Kind of like a southwestern tabuli salad. I made it per the instructions and really liked it, next time I will play a little on the ingredients, the lime zest is wonderful and I would not leave it out by choice.

AWESOME recipe! I left out the zest and butter. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and added mashed garlic clove, chopped black olives, and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. Use packaged quinoa and just cook according to box -- no rinsing or steaming and it is sooooo easy and quick! Healthy and yummy -- what could be better?!

Don't take shortcuts on the quinoa preparation. The boiling / steaming / sitting steps really create a better end product. And it's really not difficult. For this recipe, I added a dash of both cumin and cayenne, which add a lot of depth to the end product.

This salad was delicious. However, I cut it in half (it's just me) and it needed more citrus. I used lemon instead of lime, so I just squeezed a whole half on it. It was like summer in bowl...in the middle of winter in Baltimore. You can add whatever veggies you want, but make sure that you include the black beans and quinoa/cous cous. Definitely will make again.

Surprisingly good! Every other quinoa recipe calls for turmeric, which I'm not crazy about. The flavors here were so good, but I'm a lime lover.

Rating: 4
Wonderful! I cooked the quinoa according to the package directions. Much easier. Perhaps the directions stated here are for bulk quinoa. I used canned navy beans-- opened the wrong can. No sacrifce of flavor as far as I could tell. Corn would also be good. Perfect with the grilled pork chops with garlic lime sauce.

This was my first time making or eating quinoa. I loved it! I could only find it in a box that came with a seasoning packet; I followed the instructions on the box (skipping the seasoning packet) and it was much easier than this recipe would have you believe. It's just like making rice. Tastes great the next day too!

I've been craving Tata Samani's tabbouleh. This South American dish, of the same texture, was phenomenal. Plus any excuse to get quinoa into our diet is well received. I Think you'll enjoy it just as much without the butter, _ increasing the A+ health factor even more. Yum.

I really liked this, with some modifications. It needed more spice in order to satisfy us, so we added red pepper flakes, and I also added minced kalamata olives, which really took this salad over the top. Yum!

Delicious! Add a little roasted corn in there for colour. I accidentally forgot the oil in this dish, and it wasn't missing a thing in my opinion. Cut that out of the list and save the fat, it doesn't need it.

I thought this was really bland. after making as directed, i had to keep adding ingredients just to give it some flavor, and i still found it boring. For a good quinoa recipe: saute 1 onion in olive oil till soft, add 1 crushed garlic clove and about 1/4-1/2 tsp red pepper flakes. add quinoa, saute, then add appropriate amount water and cook until water absorbed. In the meantime, chop 2-3 tomato, 1/4-1/2 cup chopped fresh mint, and 4 oz of crumbled feta. mix into cooked quinoa and season with salt and pepper. easier and better than this recipe.

Very yummy and so easy. I've made it twice and used couscous both times because that's what I had on hand. The second time I was out of cilantro so I substituted some flat- leaf parsley and basil instead. It definitely needs pepper and a little salt, but other than that, the recipe is great.

Rating: 4
I have to agree with past reviews and say that this dish was SO GOOD! I cooked the quinoa per the box instructions since I don't have a sieve. I can imagine it lighter and fluffier, but the overall dish was still fantastic. I used 2 TBSP olive oil and 1 TBSP butter. I also used about half the lime zest called for (i was worried about the bitterness, and the sauce did taste a bit bitter, but when it was all mixed together, no bitterness came through just zesty lime flavor). I added diced red bell pepper and cucumber, and served with avocado slices. We ate this as a main meal between two people - and talked about how good it was the whole time! Totally satisfying, healthy, and scrumptious. I'll make it often!

I made this to go with the pork chops with garlic lime sauce and the two are wonderful together - very "new" tasting. This is the best quinoa I've ever tasted - you can rely on the recipe as written. It can stand alone.

I was surprised how delicious this was, even after all the good ratings. I didn't bother with steaming the quinoa, so maybe it could have been even better! I used all olive oil (butter just sounded wrong...), more salt and pepper, and added fresh jalapeno (which really made it for my taste buds).

This is a lovely dish! The colors are beautiful. I get quinoa at Safeway in the bulk food bins. Very inexpensive with great health benefits. (My dog eats it for all the minerals, per his vet). No one at the dinner table had ever heard of it, and everyone loved it. I felt very enlightened!

I loved the fresh flavors in the recipe, especially the combination of cilantro and lime. Reminds me of cilantro-lime butter I serve with grilled corn. Only problem is, where do you buy quinoa? I had to substitute 1 c. couscous, cooked according to package directions. Maybe Trader Joe's has it?

I prepared this recipe as written (except I didn't have any cilantro on hand) and it was easy and so delicious! Good warm, at room temp, or even cold right out of the fridge. That it's also healthy is a nice side benefit. Will definitely make again - a great summer salad.

Good - made it many times... once as specified...omitted the lime zest the second time because it was too bitter - but added more lime juice...substituted olive oil for the butter, but added only 1 Tbsp....this is great for adding extras - avocado is great, as are fresh cooked corn, garbanzos, jalapenos, bell peppers, or cucumbers -- Add 1tsp of cumin for a suprisingly good change to this delicious dish!

Even my husband who only reluctantly eats quinoa asked me to make this again! I upped the lime juice a bit, omitted the butter and added a little garlic sauteed in olive oil.

I only gave this 3 forks as I think it needs a little tweaking. I agree with another reviewer that the addition of some jalapeno would be great. I think I might also leave out the butter next time as I didn't like the 'mouth feel' it gave to the dish. This makes a great and easy side dish to a summer buffet!

Really good quinoa recipes are few and far between. I made this basically to the letter and think it's pretty delicious. The beans make for a more smooth & substantial texture. Feels like a meal for humans, not horses. Good recipe for using up items around the house!

Well, 2 forks for this one. Accidentally I ended up buying a Quinoa 'blend' and not the straight stuff. I ended up being a little mushy, but that was not why I gave it 2 forks. Everything went well, but the flavor was not as I thought it would be. I may make this again to see what I can do with it. And to the person making jokes about the Canadian...the back of my box shows the pronunciation being "keen-wa".

I made this last night (first time makining quinoa), added roasted corn from Trader Joe's and left out the scallions and sugar. I served it with grilled salmon with a mango salsa...It ROCKED THE PARTY! Would definitely make it again. Also, I didn't follow the rinsing and re-rinsing directions, I just followed the directions on the box. I did, however use a towel to absorb any additional moisture.

Delicious, for certain. I forgot the cilantro, but it would have added excellent flavor. Don't skip the butter or the steaming technique, it makes a world of difference. Next time I'll mix it up & try it with chick peas, parsley & lemon juice. So versatile.

I really liked this! I made it almost exactly, only omitted the scallions. I'll be making this a lot. I agree that it would be good with a little heat, will try adding some peppers next time, too.

This was an absolutely delicious recipe, more so because this was my first time cooking with quinoa. Very simple, very filling and worked wonderfully with the grilled tuna steaks we made that night. My only caution would be after you have drained the grain and have it in the "sieve" to steam, be careful what you use for your sieve. Unthinkingly, I used a fine mesh, hand held strainer which fit nicely in my pot. Covered it with towel and lid as directed. Went to remove from heat after the 10 minutes were up and... whoops. The plastic handle had softened and folded and dropped the grain back into the simmering water. Live and learn!

Great recipe! Good way to get the family to eat quinoa, which they usually don't like. I used olive oil instead of butter, which I usually do anyway. As far as the pros and cons of straining and resteaming, I thought it made a HUGE difference, much fluffier, nothing stuck together. I used a fine "screen" strainer which should hold the grains in, but I added cheesecloth anyway which I think added to the great texture. Love this! Made with the pork chops, which, BTW uses the same marinade I've been using for years. I put cilantro in almost everything! It's the same vinagrette I use as a standard salad dressing at home.

Rating: 4
The process of boiling and then steaming the quinoa was a bit of a pain (I had to line my strainer with cheesecloth to prevent the grains from falling through the holes), but it resulted in a fluffier, nuttier end product, which I appreciated. The recipe is seriously delicious, and I am eager to try it out with other grains (farro, barley, brown rice) and cous cous in the future.

Didn't have the zest as my lime was almost dead and didn't use any butter. The success of this recipe lies into it don't making me hate quinoa as it was the first time I was trying it. Nice one! I made it with the pork chops as suggested and it's great. Nice and relatively easy and quick for a mid-week dinner. It's Wednesday nite after a busy day. Miam...

I made the quinoa according to the directions on the box. Much more straight forward. I think the grain would have gone through the holes in my steamer. I forgot that I had thrown out my cilantro so did not include it. I added a bit of goat cheese which added a nice salty flavor and creamy texture. Feta would probably also be a nice addition.

Rating: 4
I know it's silly to give a recipe 4 forks when one changed it slightly, but I was forced to use brown rice in the absence of quinoa, and it was still delicious! I have no doubt that the quinoa would make it even better. This will be a new staple in our kitchen.
