i've made this several times now. it's a dish that's especially great for entertaining. these can be served warm or room temp, equally well. the feta/yogurt sauce is a wonderful accent!

I made this for a Greek-theme supper club dinner and everyone loved it. This side dish goes great with grilled foods. The sauce is especially good on burgers or grilled steak. I only made one small change--I used four cloves of garlic and used the herb-garlic feta cheese. Wonderful.

I brought these to a potluck and they were a big hit. I made them ahead, chilled them and then reheated them in the oven and/or microwave. The bright green color is quite interesting. I didn't use as much butter or oil as listed and they came out fine.

Very good. This has become a regular with lamb gyros. The feta yogurt sauce is very good as well.

Even the non-vegetable people I serve this too love it. This is a really nice recipe for a light supper, or paired with a bowl of great soup.

Everytime I make this dish, people ask me for the recipe. It's fast, easy, and declicious. The yogurt-sauce goes great w/other things, as well!
