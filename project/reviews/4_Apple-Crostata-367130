Just served this to my card club and it was a big hit! I made the recipe as directed but 1 hour was too long of a baking time. I pulled mine out at 50 minutes and it was perfect. I did not need to add extra water to the crust as some readers noted. If you cut it into 8 servings as the recipe specifies, they will be big pieces. I cut 10 pieces in my crostata.

Excellent! However, the maple syrup may not be necessary and used less raw sugar on crust. Otherwise may have been too sweet.

This was delicious! We enjoyed it with ice cream and homemade caramel sauce. I also had issues with the crust being dry and added an extra 2T of water. Otherwise, the crust was tender and the apples just the right amount of sweet.

A tasty, easy, impressive dessert. To avoid the problem of juices running out of the pastry, I put the cut apple between towels and dried them a bit. The corn starch and sugar mixture really stuck to the apple pieces and everything stayed inside the crust during baking. I found fifty minutes was lots of time to cook this crostata. I served it with whipped cream - just delicious.

Fantastic recipe! I doubled the apples, macerating them in sugar for about 30 minutes before proceeding with the recipe so that they reduced in volume and still fit inside the crust-- this way you get to have even more apple flavor! I found that I needed to add a lot of water to the dough to make it cohesive, but the end result was still light and tasty. There was also a bit too much nutmeg for my tastes, but this can be easily altered. Overall this is a winning recipe, one that we will be making often in our house during apple season.

Absolutely loved it! Crust was the perfect texture, and the apple filling had just the right amount of sweetness. Perfect fall dessert! Only thing I would do differently is use a rimmed baking sheet, because I do have a mess to clean up in my oven now...

Straightforward and delicious. Beautiful colour and delightfully crisp. I served with fresh heavy cream. My boys ate it up like there was no tomorrow. I have a feeling this will be my new favourite crowd pleaser.

Wonderful fall recipe. Followed recipe exactly, except for timing. It was very brown in 45 minutes. I used a rimmed pan to catch the juices. Delicious!
