Excellent recipe for leftover roast chicken and same for brown rice. Added cooked chicken to onion in pan, then it to rice, peas etc. Jarred peppers didn't do much for me but whole cumin sure did when cooking onion. Only used 1/4 cup oil for dressing and added salt as per reviews. Whole family loved it. Different yet easy and delicious.

I found this really unremarkable. We ate it but the flavors really don't do much. The cilantro is lost in the dish, and the peas (I cooked fresh peas) are wasted. I won't be making this again.

Loved the recipe, but would change it slightly. The curry flavor is very faint, so I would double the amount of the curry. I would also add another 1/2 cup milk and cook longer to ensure carrots are cooked through.

I took the advice off the other reviews and lessened the oil and added salt. OH MY GOSH...this dish is delicious! Makes a lot more than I had thought! It will be perfect for tomorrows buffet style meal.

I love this and so does my boyfriend, who is very hard to impress. Definitely needs salt and less oil, but really, really yummy!

This dish was perfectly average. Despite all the glowing reviews and the enticing ingredients, I found it quite bland -- no flavor stood out, except the curry, which couldn't offer enough to win me over. I'd pass this over; you'll find plenty of better recipes on this site.

I have never been a big curry fan, but this recipe totally converted me. My friend loves curried foods, so I decided to surprise him and make this salad. He loved it!! I followed the advice of others and I used only a 1/4 cup of olive oil, 3/4 cup would have been way too much and about an 1/8 cup of the wine vinegar, it was perfect. It definitely needs about a teaspoon of salt. Not only was it very easy to make, but it was absolutely delicious. Great for summer entertaining and great for leftovers.

Excellent salad, easy and flavorful. Used lefover roasted chicken and leftover jasmine rice - dinner was ready in 20 minutes. Thanks to the oil alert I just drizzled a bit over the mixed ingredients, sprinkled with vinegar and salt, then tossed.

Excellent Recipe! Made it for my boyfriend, couldn't stop guessing what I had put in it. Thanks for making me look so good!

This is a great salad. Easy to make and delicious. However, the recipe calls for way too much dressing, I think even as little as a quarter cup of olive oil would be enough and I wonder if the recipe has the dressing ingredients correctly. The dressing was a waste of a lot of good olive oil in the quantity given. And, yes, I did add some salt too.

I'd like to second the suggestion to add salt. I made it without chicken and it was great.

Even though I left out all the oil for health reasons, it still tasted great. I even tried wrapping some of the salad (I hadn't bothered to include the rice) in Vietnamese banh trang (spring roll rice skins). It worked great as well!

Delicious! I made this dish warm as a main dish for dinner and was very tasty. Be sure to add salt, as it is needed. And do not hesitate to use raisins, it adds a nice sweetness to the dish.

I omitted the chicken since I was making it as a side dish. Received lots of compliments from the dinner guests!

I omitted peppers and peas (dislike both) and used rice vinegar I had instead of white wine vinegar. I added a dash of cayenne and powdered ginger to the dressing. It was very good and easy, and I will make it again in the future.

Easy to make and fun to play around with. I added some jalapeno peppers, a little Tumeric and salt. The salt it needed, the other's were just my choice. Look forward to making it again.
