Excellent. I've made this about a dozen times, one of my most loved recipes on Epicurious (out of close to 400 in my box). The only changes I make is to add 2-3 cloves of minced garlic to the onions and peppers, instead of buying tomatoes with. Also I tend to use fire-roasted tomatoes when I can. Oh and sometimes use chicken stock instead of veggie just because its always on hand.

DELICIOUS! I added extra chipotle because I like it spicy and used 1 can kidney beans, 1 can black beans, and 1 can cannelloni beans instead of just black beans, which gave it a nice variety in color. Everyone loved it and I will definitely make this again!

I made this recipe as stated except for two ingredients. I used chipotle pepper marinade in powder form because my supermarket didnt have chipotle chilis. The same is true for the cumin seeds which I simply used roasted cumin powder to replace it. Nevertheless it turned out great! It still had that smoky depth that you look for with chipotle chilis. Will definitely be making this again! Sour cream and grated cheese along with tortilla chips add a nice touch to this recipe as well! Bon appetit!

I have tried many chili recipes, This one was easy healthy and great tasting. I did a bowl of turkey ground beef cheese and cilantro on the side for people to add or they could keep it vegetarian. . Yummy!The chipoles are just the right kick. those who do not like it to hot should consider decreasing the chipotles. I like it hot and chopped 5 chipotles.

This was really awesome exactly as called for. I kept it on the stove all afternoon alongside cornbread and tortilla strips as a help yourself option for New Years day guests. Also had wings, salsa and crudites. Everyone was very happy and took copies of the recipe home! First time in 20 years I've been inspired to comment on a recipe!

This is a great vegetarian chili dish, and the cumin seeds add a nice touch. I skipped the step that calls for blending 2 cups of the chili to a paste. I served it with sour cream as an accompaniment. I plan to add one or two teaspoons more chipotle peppers the next time, to heighten its presence.

i make this for parties and serve a veggie version and cook up some ground beef/pork/veal or bulk sausage to mix in for the meat eaters. like all chili, serve with dice jals, chopped scallions, chopped cilantro, mexican crema and shredded cheese in small dishes to let people add what they want. i also use whatever extra peppers I have on hand.

Rating: 4
This is terrific and very versatile. I added Goya Sofrito, which is a tomato soup base. Vegetarian things can be a bit bland, so the Sofrito gave it lots of flavor. I added a few tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa as others recommended, and it gave it a nice deeper color and a nice mole flavor. I added one minced chipotle chile at a time, and a doubled recipe took three chiles.

This was fabulous! So easy and delicious-will definitely be a keeper. Used only 3 T. olive oil, red bell pepper, ground cumin, chicken broth, and didn't puree. Used canned chipotles in adobo sauce and the flavor was excellent. Served with shredded sharp cheddar, diced avocado, crushed tortilla chips, and sour cream. Loved it!

Rating: 4
I made a few changes, but I think it would have been great without them, too. I added an additional pepper (orange), reduced the cumin seeds by about one third, substituted one of the cans of black beans with a can of white (great northern)beans. I used canned green chili peppers instead of the smokier chili suggested. The smokey taste isn't something that we like. I made cornbread with peppers and cheese baked in. Excellent combo!

Rating: 4
Wonderful spicy black bean chili that goes great with cornbread. Vidalia onions added a great sweetness to the dish. Careful with the canned chipotle chili's - if you like to sweat when you eat just add a little extra. I used chicken stock instead and added an extra yellow pepper.

A staple in our family's recipe repetoire. We make it at least twice a month, and very often for large gatherings. It is superb served over brown rice and with cornbread. I often thrown in past- their-prime mushrooms, finely chopped. Chili is the very best when you make sure the pepper & onion are VERY coarsely chopped and not over- sauted.

My husband and I love this chili, especially on cold nights. It is easy and very hearty. I use ground cumin when I am out of cumin seeds and roast my own garlic to throw in with plain diced tomatoes.

This is one of my favorite dishes. It's absolutely delicious, a snap to make, and involves almost no clean-up. I make it again and again. The only modifications are using refried beans instead of putting some of it through the food processor, and I use about eight chipotles because my family loves spicy food.

Really great chili! I took the advice of other reviewers and added carrots and 2 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa. The cocoa addition is a must!

Rating: 4
Easy, fast and wonderfully flavorful. The chipotle chiles add a fabulous smokey flavor. I've made it numerous times, each a little different. I've used carrots and celery in addition to the onion and bell pepper. I always add a handful of chopped cilantro at the very end. Also using petite diced tomatoes and simmering a little longer eliminates the need to blend a portion. Consistency is fine without the processor. Definitely a keeper.

Rating: 3
I've made this recipe three times now and recommend it highly. I followed the suggestion to use 1 can of refried beans as a way to skip the pureeing step and it worked like a charm. The only canned chipotle chilis I could find (try your local Latin market) were in adobo sauce but NOT a problem, the flavor was scrumptious (just be careful about the heat!). I also cut down on the olive oil (2-3 T sufficed) and toasted the cumin seeds in the pot before adding the oil. Wish I'd known about this recipe before the office chili cookoff as I would've won it hands down with about half the effort!

This is delicious as a vegetarian or carnivorian chili. I couldn't find plain chipotles, so used chipotle chiles in adobo sauce and added 1/2 lb. hot smoked sausage. It was fantastic and so easy to prepare.

Very solid veggie recipe--not the best chili ever, but in terms of return of flavor on investment of time, it's totally amazing. I cut down oil, used chicken stock, and had to use ground cumin. Also added 2 Tbsp unsweetened cocoa when I put in the tomatoes & black beans. This gave it a nice depth, and complemented the chipotles well.

Rating: 4
This was really easy and yummy! I didn't have the chilies but added an 8 oz can of Hot Picante tomato sauce which added a GREAT flavor and lots of spice (if you don't like really spicy, don't use this). I also added 2 cloves of garlic and about a Tbsp of chili seasoning. Finally, I added one green and one yellow squash instead of the yellow pepper (just didn't have one). Very, very delicious!!

This recipe is the best chili we've ever made... definitely will make again. But I have to admit I used tsbps of chipotle instead of tsps and it gave it an awesome kick and for some more proteins (for the non-vegs) added smoked turkey sausage.

Rating: 4
As usual, this was fantastic again!!! This time I was a can shy of black beans, so I subbed 3/4 of a can of L/O refried beans (this thickened it nicely, thus omitting the thickening step at the end). I was lucky enough to have about 2 lbs. of ripe home-grown plum tomatoes that I blanched, peeled, and then chopped (instead of using canned). Added the garlic separately, increased the broth to about 3 cups, and decreased the chipotle in adobo sauce to 1 Tbs. OO-LA-LA, was this delicious!!! Didn't get to make the cornbread this time. Too bad. Garnished it with plain white rice and real sour cream. SUPER YUMMY. Who needs meat???

You CANNOT go wrong with this recipe. I just recently made this chili for a party I hosted for 25 people. I was told by several that it was the best chili they ever tasted (and they were chili lovers). Per someone's review, I substituted chicken broth for the veggie broth. In addition, I couldn't find the minced chipotles, so I used a can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. I made it the night before the party, so I think the 24 hour period allowed the seasoning to really come out. You will not go wrong with this recipe!

Great easy recipe, and easy to assemble without too much prep since you only need a pile of cans, an onion and a yellow pepper. I couldn't find chipotles - so I used a jar of chipotle salsa and subtracted a can of tomatoes in trade. I think the salsa adds some extra depth that the can of chipotles doesn't quite do for me. Also, I have a box of cornbread mix in the cabinet that usually can bake while the chili is sitting. So easy. This has worked its way into the usual rotation, but has also become the emergency running-late, no-time-to-cook dinner. Fabulous.

I have reviewed this chili recipe twice, downing the salt by using no-salt added tomatoes, adding extra garlic, and decreasing the amount of oil to 2 Tbs. It is totally EXCELLENT!! (I am that nurse who tried to make this recipe a little more heart healthy.) But now I must thank the "COOK FROM SOUTHFIELD MI on 01/12/03" for the wonderful cornbread recipe that he/she added to the review of this chili. Even though this cornbread is not as heart healthy as the chili, it is EXCELLENT!!! (One can afford the fat in the cornbread since the chili is so low in fat.) If you try this cornbread recipe, do use regular salted butter (I used unsalted and it turned out a bit sweet, still delicious, and I even forgot the vanilla!!!) Thank you Southfield, MI. This is the only cornbread recipe I will ever make again, as your review said!!!

This is our favorite chili recipe. I try to make this about once a week. My husband and I absolutely love it. It's true that the longer you cook it the more mellow the spiciness becomes. I've made it with fewer chipotles but it's not as smoky.

Rating: 3
Well, I read all the reviews and made it to suit. Those who didn't like it must have overcooked it! I used 1 TB cumin seeds, and 1 dried chipotle, which will keep forever (re-constitute in the microwave, 1 min with water. Also used frozen corn (2 min tops) and fresh, tiny tomatoes, low-fat cheese on top. None left.

I love, love, love this recipe. Super easy & fast! The chipotle chilies make it special. Not the most beautiful dish, as one person so colorfully commented, but great anyway. Next, I'm going to try it with some beef mixed in, or maybe over rice or a baked potato, or in tacos! Yum!

Rating: 3
This recipe was so quick and easy! The only things to chop are the onion, pepper and some chillies! It was totally done in 45 minutes, including simmer time! And the taste was great. Those chipotles really make it taste authentic (and spicy)! I personally only used two tablespoons of oil because 6 seemed excessive, and it tasted great. A sure keeper for me. Yum!

Rating: 2
Well, I'm glad so many other reviewers enjoyed this dish so much, but I was rather surprised to find that while I love all the ingredients, I only found the dish okay. We finished it off, but would never crave it. Maybe it was just that the cumin was really overpowering--my cumin seeds were very fresh and potent, so maybe I should have cut back a bit. There wasn't enough chipotle to stand out, and the few other flavors in the dish were too mild to stand up to all those cumin seeds. I'll be sticking to other chili recipes in the future.

I made the chili last night for my book club. Everyone loved it. I used crushed tomatoes instead of diced, and added a miced garlic clove to the onions and peppers at the last minute. I also used ground cumin (about a palmful) instead of seeds. It came out spicier than I expected (I tossed in 2 chipotles and all of the sauce from the can), but it was all gone before we finished discussing the book.

Rating: 4
I have had better chilis before, and at first was inclined to give this 3 forks. However, this was really easy to make, and was really fast. For the speed and ease of preparation, the depth of flavor is really quite good, and I feel that this will likely become one of my regulars. I'm a bit of a pepper-belly, so the heat was fine, but the amount of chipotle may be too intense for some people. The food-processor step could probably be omitted, but it doesn't detract anything. We used just over half as much ground cumin as indicated, since we didn't have whole cumin on hand. We also used Rotel Mexican style canned tomatoes with cilantro and lime juice instead of plain canned tomatoes, and we threw a little frozen corn in at the very end. Excellent! You'll wind up with a lot of leftover chipotle peppers after this, but you can use them to make some great dips and sauces -- put them in a jar and they'll keep for a good while.

We loved this recipe. I changed a few things. I used ground cumin because I did not have the seeds. I also used jalopenos and added a few drops of liquid smoke because I did not have the chipotles. It was wonderful.

Fast and very good. I had about a half pound of ground beef on hand and browned this in the pan (and removed) before starting with onions and peppers. I only had ground cumin (used about 1 Tbsp) and it was still delicious. Used immersion blender to puree part of dish in the pot --gave it a good texture.

This was a very good, quick chili to make on a weeknight. It was the first time I used chipotle chilies and I just loved them. They are a bit hotter than I thought they would be so for those who don't like their dishes too spicy may want to taste test first. This freezes well and actually tastes better the next day.

The family said yuck and I have to agree. This was a waste of the yellow peppers and black beans. Better to have made black bean salsa with cumin and lime and the yellow peppers, chopped tomatoes, green onions, garlic, and chopped cilantro. Add a splash of olive oil and salt and pepper to taste. Serve w/ chicken or alone with tortilla chips

This is very good. DO use the chipotle chilies in adobe sauce. Several years ago you could not find this in the east. On a trip to Calif. I picked up 15 cans of it and brought it home in my suitcase. I wonder what the inspectors would think of this now! After I open a can, I put it in a small plastic container and freeze it. It will last a long time in the ref. Do use it. It makes the recipe.

This recipe is very good, and I did the following based on other reviews: 1) Put it all together in the late morning and let it "cook/simmer" (covered) all day to meld flavors. I'm glad I did because it seemed REALLY spicy to me at 2:00. By 6:30 when we ate, it was just right. 2) Didn't use the seeds in the chipotles as one reviewer mentioned. I wasn't sure if that would make a difference, but I did it anyway. 3) Used only 1-2 TBS oil; 4) Did puree the 2-3 cups. Used red pepper instead of yellow; chicken broth in place of veggie broth (didn't have any). It was really good. Hopefully it will be better tomorrow!

I thought this was very good. Will definitely make again. Added 1 extra can of black beans and only 3 teaspoons of the chipotle peppers to tone it down for a nonspicy food family member, but think it would be great made as written. First time I've used chipotle peppers. Wonderful favor.

I have to say I'm a little confused by the few people who said they truly didn't like this. I'm thinking that perhaps they were expecting a 'meat tasting' chili and not a vegetarian chili, otherwise I can't understand why they wouldn't like this. It was outstanding and delicious! My friend (who also reviewed this recipe) called and told me I had to try it. I am so glad she did!! This was not only quite easy to make and delicious, but visually beautiful with the yellow peppers/red tomatoes and black beans. I served extra chopped chipolte's on the side which added more 'heat and flavor' for those who wanted it. Note to Cheryl: More than once, Conway said, "Cheryl gave you this recipe?

I have to agree, this was pretty bland. I wanted to do a free-form chili, but my husband wanted to try this. He agreed afterwards that the first option would have been better. I suggest... saute onions, garlic, and celery in olive oil, add cumin and chili powder and a dash of cinnamon, then stewed tomatoes, spicy V-8, salsa, assorted beans & veggies (peppers, mushrooms, etc), and elbow macaroni (my favorite). Can't go wrong.

After all the rave reviews, I have to admit I was very disappointed. Followed the recipe exactly... and then kept tasting and tasting. But - nothing. It was as though all the flavors cancelled each other out. VERY bland. And didn't care for the texture. Before or after pureeing a portion. Ended up throwing the whole thing away. I guess that's why there are so many different recipes - everyone likes something different. I'll continue my search.

Excellent flavor! Thanks to earlier reviewers for the good advice about reducing the oil (2 T. was plenty) and skipping the blender step. Black beans won't ever supplant meat in my carniverous family's affections, but everyone thoroughly enjoyed this dish for a change of pace. Next time I make 'real' chili, I'll definitely incorporate the two key ingredients from this recipe: chipotles and cumin seed. The flavors beat the heck out of the hot sauce and ground cumin I've always used!

This was surprisingly good. Even my husband liked it and couldn't believe there was no meat in it. I felt positively virtuous eating this and got a good portion of my "5-a-day" fruits and veggies in, too. I used 1 lb. cooked black beans instead of the canned ones.

I have written very few reviews, mostly because I was not necessairly move to do so. However, I made this chili yesterday morning for dinner last night and there was not a drop left.

I have never tried vegetarian chili before, and was dubious about this recipe because my husband and I can't handle spicy food. I used only half of the chipotle required, but could have used more.

This is soooo good! I couldn't find canned chipotle chilis so I bought a small can of hot chipotle salsa and added that - it added the smoky flavor and a little heat. I also reduced the olive oil to about 3 tbs. and it worked out just fine. Hubby really liked it and he's generally suspicious of vegetarian recipes. And also to cook who has the gaseous spouse - it's true that rinsing black beans and soaking them in water for 10 minutes or so will reduce the "flatulence effect" (thanks Martha Stewart - it's just fun hearing her talk about gas!).

Had trouble finding chipotle en adobo in my local stores a year ago so I developed my own small quantity, quick version. Take one dried chipotle chili, remove seeds, chop, add 1/2 c. hot water, 1/2 tbl ketchup, 1 clove chopped garlic, pinch salt, and 1/2 tbl apple cider, let sit on the counter for 1/2-1 hour. Can blend if desired. I put desired quantity in a recipe and then serve the rest on the side for those who like a bigger zip. Try it in this great recipe!

So easy and soooo good! I made this one day ahead of time to allow the flavors to meld. Decreased the oil by half. The yellow pepper retained its color and added a bright note to the dish. I also did not find it necessary to process any of the chili to a coarse paste. Instead I served the chili over some cooked rice. The dish was a bit spicy for me. Next time I will likely cut the quantity of chipotle chiles a bit. However, I must admit that I am a complete wimp when it comes to foods that are hot. Enjoy this delicious and extremely simple dish!

Yummy, easy and healthy. What more can you ask? I added chopped cilantro, a tablespoon of sour cream, and chopped avocado to the top.

I used dried black beans, which I simmered with cumin seeds, a chipotle and chorizo-lard for a couple of hours, before adding in the other ingredients. This was surprisingly nice for such a simple dish.

Yum! Yum! Try this - you won't be disappointed! I have to admit an initial reluctance to make this dish, since it seemed so simple and just entailed opening and combining multiple cans. The flavors, however, are wonderful: a lovely, soothing winter dish. Didn't process the two cups at the end - simmering for 30 minutes seemed to thicken it up adequately.

Decreased oil to one tablespoon, other than that made as written and it is outstanding! Excellent!

So quick and easy. I used 2 cans of black beans and added carrots and celery. Since I had some fresh salsa that was on the verge, I used 1 cup of that instead of the second can of tomatoes. With only 1 1/2 cup of broth, it thickened nicely without the blender. The chipoltes added great flavor and lots of heat. Topped with cilantro and non-fat yogurt for a lower calorie version. Looking forward to the leftovers tonight.

Serious numminess! But don't put it in the blender. We enjoyed the crunchiness of the peppers and beans. The texture of the veggies adds to the dish. Pleasantly spicy, without being too hot. We tried the sourcream on the side. Did not like how the cream made the dish bland. However, the Jack cheese was a great addition. Cut the dish in half for my husband and me, and we had great leftovers. With cutting the dish in half (and the amount of liquid from the tomatoes) I did not need to add the broth. Stick with the yellow peppers; they add a hint of sweetness that would not be found in green or red peppers. Going to add this to my beef/kidney bean chili recipe. Wonderful!

I'm giving this 4 forks for taste and 5 forks for ease of preparation. Try it....we love it. Chilpoltes make it very tasty

This recipe was easy, smelled heavenly, and while great the first night was even better when reheated. A total success!

Great chili...better 2nd day after flavors have time to meld. Substituted red peppers for yellow, and also crushed the cumin in mortar/pestle. Great with a bit of fresh lime juice sprinkled over top! Also makes a good bean dip as well as adding to nachos in lieu of the refried beans and salsa.

This was the best tasting chili I ever made (and I make chili often). I assume the chipolte made the big difference. However, I cringed at using the food processor to "thicken" the mix and therefore used only half the tomatoes and veg broth called for. The result: thick, lush and delicious. Also, in Europe they don't have "roasted garlic tomatoes" so I used normal pureed tomatoes and added my own garlic. (PS I also couldn't get canned black beans here and so made them from scratch.) This was even better the next day. My chief food critic complained when he found it had all been eaten.

Wonderful! So easy! Great vegetarian dish. A keeper.

Initially I thought the chili dish was just good. As it matured, it tasted great. We garnished it with a sour cream. I couldn't find the chipolte chiles by themselves. So I added chipole salsa to the recipe. I really liked it b/c you could clearly taste the chipolte. This recipe was a nice way to jazz up traditional chili.

I agree with reducing the amount of chipotle chiles. I cooked this in my crockpot. Also, I garnished with white cheddar cheese and sour cream; I omitted the green onions. My family enjoyed it, but it was a bit spicy for my kids.

At first I thought this was going to be much too bland so I added a lot more of the chilis. I found it tasted much better the second day after the tastes had blended.

This is wonderful and easy. Other recent reviewers' comments were right on. I doubled the recipe but only used 1/4 c of oil. Used fire roasted tomatoes with green chiles and added 2 cloves of garlic and 10 oz corn kernels. Increased the amount of chipotles (a total of 1/4 cup for the double recipe and it had a nice kick. Will definitely make this again. Thank you Epicurious and other reviewers.

This is very good, and easy to prepare. It's done in about an hour, including chopping the vegetables. Six tablespoons of olive oil is quite a lot of oil. I used four, and it was still a little much. I found the canned chipotle chilis in abodo sauce in the supermarket. I deseeded them to reduce the spiciness, and actually used about 5 tablespoons. They weren't very spicy, but added a wonderful flavor. I topped the chili with grated pizza cheese (combination of chedder and mozzaralla), and served it with hot sourdough bread wedges. I will definitely make this again.

Very easy recipe with lots of taste!!! I was leary of how hot it would be so I used about 1-1/2 teaspoons canned chilpolte peppers plus 1/2 teaspoon chilpolte chili powder. It was rather hot for me but perfect for the hubby. Topped it off with sour cream, chopped cilantro and green onions.

Very good, and easy. I'd start with just about half the hot pepper it calls for, and if you want more, stir it in toward the end. It's HOT!

This was easy and delicious!! Wonderful smoky taste and a definite kick from the chipoltes. I would make it again and could eat it all winter long!! I liked the idea of adding corn. We served it with rice and corn bread.

Really good, try it and you won't be disappointed. Also really easy, as someone mentioned before. I needed a little more liquid so I used some extra stock. Also used green chiles instead. Definitely a keeper. Next time I'll try it with corn. I also added extra cayenne. Yum.

Good stuff... made as instructed except used a green bell and did not blend. Seems a large jar of salsa would be a good sub for the canned tomatoes.

A great vegetarian chili recipe, although it would be good with spicy sausage. To avoid a mess, I pureed the 2 cups BEFORE it was warm. For extra spunk, I added lots of cilantro, an orange pepper, and a dollop of sour creme on top of each bowlful. Easy recipe for big groups.

I would have given this recipe a 10 if I could. I think that I have found my NEW chili recipe. It was easy and had wonderful flavor

This was much better made a day ahead. I used more chipotle, added some canned white beans, and served with grated Monterey Jack in addition to the green onion and cilantro. Serve it with cornbread.

First I questioned the use of yellow peppers which was to be dumped in with the black beans and tomatoes and stewed for half an hour - WHY YELLOW PEPPERS? What's wrong with red or green bell peppers? They all end up the same color anyway. Then I couldn't find chipotle peppers - what do you expect - me living in Kuala Lumpur. So I used dried Sechuan peppers instead plus a small spoon of Trinidadian Chatak's Pepper sauce. Darn it! I couldn't find garlic - so in went Lee Kum Kee's Black bean and Garlic. Then came the tasting bit - no spoonfull at a time for this cook. I took just a small bowl and sat down to watch TV - then another smallish bowl. It was then that I realised that I was supposed to put this wonderful veggie-chili in a blender - NO WAY! I microwaved two imported Idaho potatoes to perfection - crushed and split them and filled them generously overflowing in a deep dish and topped it off with a good dollop of sour cream. Sorry next time I'll make spread as per the recipe - but please don't call this a salad - and mention colors that aren't there. Suzie Speedhump

Just delightful; the cumin and the chipotle are inspired combos, and we served it on basmati rice. A nice winter warmer.

This is very easy to make and I loved the smoky flavor. It was definitely a nice change from the usual kinds of chili. I reduced the beans to two cans, and used regular canned tomatoes instead of roasted garlic tomatoes. I will probably reduce the amount of broth next time, so that it takes less time to thicken. I didn't bother putting part of it in the processor, to save time on cleanup. Will be making this again soon!

This was so delicious and easy to prepare. I will make it again, but only when my husband is out of town and for guests who won't be staying overnight. The recipe gave my husband the worst gas imaginable...my mouth was watering when we ate, and my eyes were watering all night from his noxious gas! Delicious.

A great recipie. Simple and quick to prepare, nutritionally balanced and delicious. I've made this chili several times, and it always draws raves. Serve with a simple salad and corn bread. Rinse the chilies before adding if you want the product a bit milder.

What an EXCELLENT recipe! It was such an interesting (and nice!) change from the turkey or veggie chili my husband and I normally make this time of year. I added green onions and a spoon of salsa for garnishes and might try diced cucumbers next time for a little twist. We will DEFINITELY make this one again! Oh, and we had corn bread sticks with cheese & jalapenos and a salad to compliment the chili. Can't wait for the leftovers at lunch! YUMMY! :0)
