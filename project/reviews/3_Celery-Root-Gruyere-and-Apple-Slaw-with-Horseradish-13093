I used aged parmesan and it was delicious. Would be easier with a food processor -- set on course grate. Different, and I get sick of the same things.

Didn't really like it and was a lot of work with all the slicing into matchsticks. I wouldn't make it again.

I compete with some of our friends in a variation of Iron Chef. This was part of our winning line-up for Apple Battle.

I make this recipe every fall as part of the Oktoberfest menu featured in this issue. It's great served with the roast pork loin, the red onion sauerkraut, and the German potato salad.

have made this many times for parties. It's addictive and people always want the recipe, but are surprised by the ingredients. It is an especially wonderful accompaniment to smoked ham.

This was VERY interesting! I'll go with 3-1/2. Excites the tastebuds, for sure, very nouveau. Replace regular coleslaw at a picnic with this! Use any swiss. Add the dressing gradually, to your liking, I though there was too much-You don't want to miss the fresh crunchiness of the apples and celery root!
