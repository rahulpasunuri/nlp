Easy dish and increased to serve eight. Lime and basil were a good combination on these potatoes. I cooked these for about 30 minutes by mistake, but I don't believe it affected the dish other than to make it easier for those whith no teeth. Just kidding!

The flavours blend well together. Make sure to wait until the basil leaves are dry before you mix with the potatoes as mine chunk together.

These spuds were so easy, and tasty! I roasted them at a lower temp for a longer time than the recipe called for. I'd definitely make these again.

There is something really special about this potato/lime combination. It was a bit spicey and tangy without overdoing it. It was great with mini Yukon gold and red potatoes, salt and pepper. I didn't have any fresh basil, but I'm sure that would also be delicious. We served the potatoes with roast lamb. Also I used a Key lime for my lime juice...it took just one of the little guys for the whole dish.

Great taste, simple to prepare, good enough for company. We've made this one many times since the recipe came out in '96.
