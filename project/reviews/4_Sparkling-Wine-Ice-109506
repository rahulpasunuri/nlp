Absolutely wonderful as a palate cleanser in a 7-course dinner for my husband's birthday.

Light, fluffy, crisp, refreshing, the star of the "trio of frozen delights" we had for dessert. Paired gorgeously with Chocolate Sorbet and Toasted Almond White Chocolate SemiFreddo. Cava choices are limited up here, so I just used Freixenet Extra Dry and it was delicious.

Absolutely delicious! This was such a simple recipe, and it came out beautifully. I did remove a good amount of the zest once I realized how much there was floating around in there, but it still had a very nice, lemony flavor. I can't wait to try it again with different variations on the fruit.
