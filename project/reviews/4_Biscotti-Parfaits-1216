If you hate reviews that list lots of substitutions, stop reading now! I used amaretti cookies and amaretto di Saronno liqueur instead of biscotti and Sambuca, and fresh apricots and strawberries instead of dried fruit. Combined with good-quality vanilla ice cream, it tasted just like one of those old-fashioned almond crunch bars plus fruit. I oversoftened the ice cream -- it was pretty melted by the time we got around to eating -- but no one cared.

Easy and delicious. Made about 4 hours ahead, and was still great.

Wonderul end to an Italian meal. I prepared this the evening prior to entertaining with excellent results. Simple and easy to make...just what the cook needed

This was a real winner. Very simple and easy to put together. Next time i will be sure to actually measure the sambuca instead of free-pouring it in, as they were just a little overly alcoholic. Then again, the guests weren't complaining! I used dried pears, dates, raisins and apricots... though really, any fruit would have done.

Very nice, simple, do-ahead dessert. Use the BEST ice cream you can find. I used vanilla ice cream and substituted amaretto for the anise liquer and I (and my guest) thought it was perfect.

WONDERFUL! Easy quick dessert, especially for unexpected guests since all of the ingredients are "pantry shelf" items. Very refreshing after a pasta dinner.
