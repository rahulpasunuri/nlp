This recipe has never failed me! I have cooked these soufflés with the Creme Anglaise sauce many times, always with rave reviews! As the recipe makes 8, I started to freeze the uncooked soufflés. I fully defrost them for around 40 minutes and then cook them as normal. Yes, they turn out just as good! I also freeze the sauce. After defrosting the sauce, I heat it using a steamer over a pan of simmering water but don't let the bottom of the steamer touch the water! The sauce heats in the time it takes to cook the soufflés.

The souffles were simple delicious! I doubled the recipe and made them yesterday for 14. A couple of notes. First, I used the ramekins from Pier One Imports and they are not 1 cup each. They are 3/4 cup, so I obviously had extra souffle batter and froze a big one for later. If you have the same ramekins , this recipe would definitely yield at 10 servings. Second, doubling the recipe was easy by I can tell you 16 egg whites in a kitchen aid standing mixer is the absolute maximum. I used the whisk attachment and it was perfect. Because I needed to make them in advance, I made the souffles early in the day and froze them. Took them out of the freezer at 7PM and let them sit on the counter until 10PM before baking and they honestly did fine and tasted great. I'm sure they would have risen higher if I had baked them immediately, but once you pour the Creme Anglaise in, its not like you notice the height much. As for the Creme Anglaise, I used the 1998 recipe on this site and it was perfection. Since I knew my guests loved this sauce, I quadrupled the sauce recipe with no problems (just longer cooking time) and I didn't have a drop left.I would totally plan on a 1/4 cup of sauce per person if they are sauce lovers. I don't know if it was government food safe, but I used the 100% Orange Essential Oil from Vitamin Shoppe and was glad I did. It needed the extra orange punch to balance off that flour roux. I was a bit intimidated by the recipe but if you follow the directions, its pretty easy!

This recipe was so delicious. I did not use the recipe for creme anglaise given here. However, the recipe for the souffle is the best I've had ! You must give it a try!

Made these souffles for dessert on Christmas. They were very good and everyone was impressed. My first time making a souffle too. I made the base the day before and refridgerated it over night. I pulled it out a few hours before baking to let it come up to room temp. I beat the egg whites and folded them into the base and put them in some smaller 4 oz ramekins. Bigger ramekins just seemed to large a serving for this dessert. Souffles rose perfectly and I served them with some scratch made creme anglaise and some 150th anniversary Grand Marnier for my guests to sip on while eating this. It was perfect. Great & simple recipe that I will surely make again.

5+ forks! This was sublime, exquisite, absolutely Delicious!!! Probably the best Souffle I've ever HAD or made! I omitted the orange oil, up-ed the Gran Marnier to 4 T, decreased the sugar for the whites to 3/4 C and served it with Lite Cool Whip and berries ont the side (thought the Cream Anglaise would be delicious- but too many calories!) Definitely a 'Keeper' and so easy to prepare in advance, freeze and have on hand when needed!

You can make most souffle's in advance and the freeze them...pop them in the oven when everyone sits down for dinner!

Does anyone know where I can find the "make ahead" option? Can this recipe be PARTIALLY made ahead? (Don't want to be too long in the kitchen during a dinner party). Thanks!

I made this last night for Valentine's Day - without the Creme Anglaise - and it was positively, divinely, delicious. I halved the recipe (used four yolks and four whites) and had enough to make three souffles (I was OK sharing that third one!). I did not have whole milk so I did a hybrid mixture of my fiance's omega-3 smart milk and some heavy whipping cream and that worked out just fine. Timing-wise, next time I will beat the egg whites first, mix the yolks/vanilla/etc. second and that way I can make the roux and do all the mixing steps at the end. Seems like it will save me time moving around the kitchen like a madwoman. I also did not have orange oil so added slightly more vanilla to compensate. Again, worked out just fine.

The recipe was very useful. However, I wanted to edit it for my own use. I entered my "notes" but the web site made it virtually impossible to access the notes from my files -OR anywhere. What I'm looking for is notations that let me go to my recipe file and (from there) see my edits, Please advise!!

This was my husband and my very first time ever making souffle and it was perfect and delicious!! We have definitely saved it as one to be made again! We shortened the recipe since we didn't have 8 ramekins and it was still great. We actually had a Grand Marnier souffle at the Eiffel Tower restaurant in Vegas on our honeymoon and have been searching for a recipe that came close- this one may have topped it!!!!

Delicious, a lot of steps, definitely not something I would want to do when having a dinner party. I ended up with 10 servings. I will try the suggestion of reheating them tomorrow. I will make them again, but try the make ahead suggestion.

Perfect - I've made it with Grand Marnier and made it with Cointreau (more orange flavor) and with a combo - any way it was great. I've never used orange oil, but I've always grated a bit of orange zest into my creme anglaise (actually, I've done that for years when using it as a sauce for fresh berries, pound cake, etc.)

I've made this recipe dozens of times all with great success. I've never had the souffle "fall." I highly recommend it.

Also used 1/4 t of orange oil. This recipe was excellent and worked as advertized. We had extras -- I covered them loosely with plastic wrap, once cool, and refrigerated the collapsed souffles, still in their ramekins, in the refrigerator. 24 hours later, I baked them without a waterbath for 15 min at 400F -- they actually looked nicer then the first night and taste/moistness was great. The make-ahead option really makes this a go-to dessert for a party.

I've been making this recipe for years and it continues to be a crowd pleaser every time. To speed things along, I make the souffle base and creme anglaise ahead and refrigerate. The sauce reheats very well. When making the sauce, I add vanilla, grand marnier, and extra sugar (we like it a little sweeter). Other than that, I follow the directions exactly and the souffles are always perfect and delicious! The recipe makes more than we need, so I refrigerate the leftovers and my kids love them cold. I've tried it too, and they are surprisingly good!

This is a keeper. Delicious. I also skipped the orange oil and doubled the grand marnier. I let the souffles sit for about an hour bcfore cooking and they still rose beautifully. Next time I'll go longer. I served them with devon cream and raspberries alongside as suggested by the cook below. Lovely and light.

I love this recipe...I also doubled the Grand Marnier and I added the zest of an Orange which really made the flavors shine. My 8 year old son loved it so much that he had seconds. My guests thought it was restaurant quality. The Creme Anglaise was nice, I also served it on the side with a scoop of French Vanilla Ice Cream and a few raspberries for color. Definately a keeper and will make again.

This recipe was easy to make. The flavors were very muted because I didn't have orange oil. I would definitely recommend adding vanilla bean to the creme anglais.

Absolutely Fantastic! and very easy to prepare. Impressive to boot! I added mulling spices and steeped it in the milk/cream mixture for about 10-15 minutes. Then stained it and holy bon appetit, egg nog creme angliase. To up the level of Grand Marnier I added some to the cooked anglasie. Delicious! Used whole milk and cream to create the 1/2 & 1/2. As one reviewer mentioned this is does not have a strong eggy. Well balanced with sweetness and texture.

After I made this, my wife laminated the recipe (so I KNOW she liked it) I did not have Whole milk so I used 1/2 cup Half n Half and 1/2 cup 2% I also misunderstood and thought the recipe called for either orange oil OR Grand Marnier. Once I Started I realized but did not have any Grand Marnier so I went without. It was still wonderful.

Rating: 4
Very good recipe. I could not find orange oil and so I doubled the grand marnier. I still wanted more flavor/pungency, but my guests thought it was perfect. This souffle produced a light, but slightly firmer texture than some souffles I have had. It was not quite as soft and eggy as some. I'll make this again once I stumble upon some orange oil. I prepared two+ hours ahead of dinner, brought back to room temperature and then cookedfor exactly 20 minutes. Came out perfect.

Excellent! I made them for last night's dinner. I made the creme anglaise the day before. Yummy! and the souffles were easy and quick to make. As one reviewer suggested, I put them in the oven when we were having the soup course and 20 minutes later they were ready to serve out of the oven! I did not have the orange oil and also doubled the Grand Marnier. It was perfect!

I'm always looking for an outstanding dessert that can manage itself while I eat dinner with my guests. The last thing I expected to fill this need was a souffle! But I made the recipe in advance and froze them one step short of the baking. The night of your party, just preheat the oven during the soup course and bake during dinner. Amazing. My only suggestions are to use skim milk as it didn't hurt, and to bake a little longer than 20 minutes. Enjoy!

Absolutely fantastic! Add double the amount of Grand Marnier and tasted good. Next time I will add more Grand Marnier instead of the oil. Also prepared the dish ahead and still rose well. Definitely a crowd pleaser and will make again. Very easy to prepare. Thank you.

I did double the Grand Marnier and found that there can be too much of a good thing. I did, however, use the orange oil so that could be the reason it was bit much. Really easy, and very impressive. I froze some and cooked them 2 weeks later and they turned out fine.

My first try at a souffle recipe was such a resounding success it even impressed me. I followed others' tips about doubling the Grand Marnier - I didn't have the oil. I also made the Creme Anglaise - yum! - a must. Advice? Know the temp of your oven - mine was a little hot and the souffles browned a little more than I would have liked but didn't effect the texture.

This is the best Grand Marnier Souffle recipe I have tried! I put in almost double the Grand Marnier, which tasted perfect. I also kept them in the fridge for almost two hours, then let them warm back to room temperature before baking, and they rose beautifully! (The two that didn't get baked until the next evening were still fairly puffy and very tasty.) One tip: run a finger or spoon around the top inside edge of each filled ramekin to separate the top of the souffle from the dish, which allows it to rise more easily and evenly.

First, can anything drenched in creme anglaise be bad? Everyone ate them with great pleasure. However, they did not come out as well as I had hoped. They need a bit stronger essence of orange IMHO. They did not rise very much, only about 1 inch over the top of the ramkin. The top was flat and darker than I would have liked. Living in Colorado, I love to blame everything on the "altitude" (couldn't possibly be my technique!!!). Does anyone have suggestions about what changes might need to be made to make this recipe work better at 6000ft? I prepped these ahead of time, so could someone explain how making a well in the souffles helps to get them to rise?

Rating: 4
Great souffle! To combat the "away from my guests" fear - get them involved! (I NEVER would have done this in the past, but tried it a couple of times and have had a lot of fun). I did all the prep work making the creme anglaise and souffle base beforehand. My guests whipped the egg whites, added the sugar, folded the two, etc. and, when the souffles were done, felt great - not only because the dessert was pretty and delicious - but because they had a role in their creation. Honestly - try it. I am a convert, although only occassionally.

Rating: 4
These are absolutely wonderful. I have made these on numerous occasions each time with great success. To the cook who questioned time away from her guests to prepare the souffles I always make mine at least 4 to 6 hours in advance and place them in a cool area near the kithen. Towards the end of dinner I boil the water and proceed with baking. This has never failed. Also, to make them rise use either your finger or a small spoon to create a well around the edge of the souffle and they will rise beautifully. These are truly fool proof and your guests will be very impressed. The creme anglase is a must...

Rating: 3
Although fantastic and relatively simple, they took ~45 minutes start to finish which, if preparing for a dinner party seems far too long to leave one's guests. How much can be done in advance of guests arriving and - if any - must it be refrigerated or just covered at room temp? If a significant % of the work can't be done prior, I just don't see how they are viable for guests.

Excellent. Relatively easy and fool proof souffle. I cheated on the creme anglaise, though, using instead heated Breyer's French Vanilla ice cream, slightly thickened with some corn starch.

These things were a *huge* hit with my family! When I asked my sister recently what she wanted as dessert for her birthday, she responded with "oh my GOD... screw the cake... yes I want those souffle things! Those (as we city kids say) are the bomb. If it's not too big a deal then yes, I would love if you made those!!" The great thing is, that it is really not that "big a deal". This is a surprisingly easy recipe to make! Definitely a keeper (and one to hand down from generation to generation)!

We made these twice in one week. My husband just LOVED them. The second time we made them we added more Grand Marnier and it was better. Only complaint is that the recipe makes 8 and it's tough to divide down to 2 servings. Other than that, piece of cake to make...

These were wonderful and well worth the effort... which did seem to take a significant amount of time. I wonder if these could be partially made ahead of time and then finished up with the addition of the beaten egg whites just before baking? To answer the previous reviewer's question, "orange oil" is carried by www.Penzeys.com.
