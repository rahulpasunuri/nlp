We loved this and could eat it every night! Make sure to buy roasted almonds. I don't think it is necessary to puree the chives.. just chop them in the dressing. We will try that next time. Adding cumin is good.

I used instant brown rice and cooked the rice and the sprouts in the same pan. I've made this twice and the crunchy nuts and dressing make the dish.

Dried organic sprouts are available at Costco in our area. I make something very similar to this using lots of fresh basil and an oil & vinegar dressing - tastes great after the flavors blend for 24 hours.

Had trouble locating the dryed sprouts, so I substituted green lentils, fresh bean, alfalfa, and radish sprouts. Served with Teriyaki and Five spice chicken skewers. I also doubled the recipe and it still was not enough for our family of five, they liked it that much.Would also go well with a good white fish.

My family found this salad *incredibly* bland. The texture was ok, but the flavor was inbelievably boring. Spiced it up with some chopped fresh herbs (I think parsley, mint and basil) and cumin, and it was greatly improved. However, we won't be making this again.

Great easy summer dinner, and impossible to mess up. Random quantities of just about everything seem to work fine. Watch out for the salted nuts though - too much salt for me, I'd rather do unsalted and add a little if needed.

This salad blows me away! I LOVE everything about it; the crunch, the texture, the complexity... I can't get enough of it. It was a tad time consuming to put together, but well worth it. Awesome!

I used the scallions, chives, and zucchini from my CSA farm share, as well as fresh sprouted beans and more rice. No need to strain the dressing..I even added a couple of garlic scapes to it. Threw in some tamari almonds and sunflower seeds at the end and a sprinkle of goat cheese. This is a healthy and delicious dish.

This has excellent crunch and taste. Great summer salad. I used a brown rice/wild rice mix and I substituted 3/4 can garbanzo beans for the sprouted mungs because they have been recalled in my area. Made it with Korean short-rib tacos.

This was DELICIOUS. We have access to a great sprout vender at our farmers market, so we actually made this properly and therefore can give an accurate review. Even though my husband complained as I made it that it looked like bird seed, he could not get enough of it when it was done - crunchy, zesty, fresh, and umami, it really had it all!

I also couldn't find sprouted beans, so I used dried mung beans and french green lentils. Very hearty salad. I will probably make this again and add a little more lemon.

I couldn't find dried sprouted legumes so I used the the fresh ones from the produce dept. They probably didn't need to be cooked at all so the salad was not as crunchy as it should have been.I used leftover whole wheat orzo insted of brown rice. My vegan daughter and I liked it the rest of the fam thought is was ok. Def needs more lemon juice. Will try it with the rice and doctor it up a little next time. Different and super healthy!
