Following the suggestion of KatyaD, I substituted yellow onion for green, and chopped apple for dried apricots; I browned both together on high for 5 minutes after cooking the chicken, and then added the other ingredients. I think cornstarch makes a better thickener for this type of sauce than flour - the texture and consistency of the sauce was perfect. The result: a tasty, simple chicken dish, which I will make again, but will consider increasing the ginger, or using fresh ginger, to give it just a bit more zing.

This recipe is really delicious and perfect as is. I just wish I had a great way to use this sauce for chicken that is not fried for a healthier option.

This came out very well. I added red and yellow bell peppers with the onions to make it slightly more substantial: It worked very well.

My husband and I both loved this recipe so much that he insisted I make it again. I did make a couple changes due to lack of ingredients. I didn't have dried apricots so I left that out. Didn't have cornstarch so I used flour instead and I added about a 1/2 tsp. hot pepper sauce to the broth and about a teaspoon of cardamom to the flour mixture that coats the chicken and it came out just perfect. A definite winner!

This is a very tasty dish and a hit with my kids, who are picky eaters.

I didn't have green onions, so I substituted half of a large yellow onion. I also used fresh coriander and sauteed apples with the onions instead of using apricots. It was delicious and my roommates loved it!

Also, I used regular onions instead of green onions and (obviously) didn't use them as a garnish.

I loved this dish! I used boneless/skinless thighs and omitted the cornstarch. It was a huge hit with the family.

Amazing! I am always looking for a great chicken dish, and this is it! I revised the recipe according to the instructions listed in the reviews, and my husband and I loved it. I loved the sauce so much I wish I had made more, and I only used 3 pieces of chicken. So, I would double the ingredients for the sauce next time. I would absolutely serve this to any dinner party, and be proud to say it was mine. Thank you for your revisions on this recipe.

My guests and I loved this recipe. Can anyone tell me whether you can successfully freeze the chicken (and just make the sauce the same day or a day before)?

Oops! This is the orignial author of the recipe again. Speaking of errors...I realized that I made one myself in the last message. It's 1 t (teaspoon!) of ginger. So I try to make a correction and end up with another mistake! There goes my credibility.

I confess that I am biased since I am the original author of this recipe, sent in to Bon Apetit years ago. The recipe has been altered on the website. To clear things up for those of you who hated the consistency of the sauce, the original called for 1T of cornstarch diluted in 2T of broth or water (not the 1.5T added directly to the broth as stated on the website). Also, just heat the sauce until slightly thickened. Don't vigorously boil or it will get too thick. Other differences are that I used 1T ginger (not 3/4) and I add the onions all at the end so that they are still slightly crunchy when served. I make this frequently both for my family and for company. Everyone always raves about it. I understand that, since we all have different tastes, it might not have been everyone's favorite. But it's hard to see how anyone could hate it as much as some of the comments indicate. You must be doing something wrong. Of course, the errors in the printed recipe don't help.

The first bite didn't wow me, but after a few forkfuls, knew I would be making this again! Used white onion instead of green, was fine. Had to add extra honey to get the sauce tasting right, even though I don't usually like sweet savory dishes. Added a dash of curry powder, too. The chicken was fantastic (altho I just quick fried it then finished it off in the oven.) This was a fun dish that wasn't overly time consuming for something less ordinary.

OH Man! OK all y'all who didn't make this one that well........try again. I just made it and had to stop in the middle of the dish to write about how awesome it is. (Which was really hard to do!!) Actually, I confess it's right here and I'm taking bites between sentences. Yum!...? I don't understand how this could have gotten less than 4 forks. (Shoved two bites in mouth) The chicken is tender, brought it to room temp first, and the ginger and apricots combo~ Wow! I could serve this to anyone and rest assured. KEEPER!

My family loved this recipe. I used turkey breast tenderloins instead of the chicken otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I was looking for recipes for dried apricots because I recieved many for Christmas. This is a good use for them. I will make this recipe again.

Excellent recipe. I tried substituting orange for apricot preserve, and it altered the flavor. The honey, soy, ginger and apricot are essential. Next time I will substitute more honey if I am out of the preserves.

Delicious! I found this dish very flavorful. Although, I didn't have some of the ingredients, such as corainder, honey, and the dried apricots. It was still fabulous and very eye-appealing.

I also found that the sweet and salt flavors didn't mesh well in this recipe. I added some fresh chopped ginger hoping that it would give it a little more punch (which it did) but the overall flavor was nothing special. I won't make this one again.

I found it a bit bland & lacking in "punch" so I added more coriander, ginger and finally curry powder. The end result was good! I tried the recommendation to serve with Spiced Rice Pilaf (Bon Apetit) & was very pleased.

This was very tasty--I prepared it as written EXCEPT I cut the chicken breasts into smaller pieces before cooking, and I used chopped crstallized ginger (about 1/3 C.)instead of dry ginger. Next time I will probably use more chicken broth (or less cornstarch). It was easy, fast, and I will definitely make it again.

Something about this didn't quite go for me. I may try again without the soy sauce... There was a salty undertone that was unappealing. I added apple juice and some water which helped tone down the savory taste and step up the sweetness. Definitely cut back on the cornstarch. I used only one Tbls. and added liquid and still found it thick. I believe this has potential, just needs a bit of playing to get it right for my taste.

Instead of cutting back on cornstarch, I added chicken broth to make more sauce. It was delicious and my husband liked it very much. I confess to having skipped the dried apricots (I was out)--it was still great.

This chicken was a total crowd pleaser. I didn't find the sauce to be too thick, even with the amt of cornstarch listed in the recipe. I will make this again and again

I took the advice of the other reviewers and cut back the amount of cornstarch to one tablespoon (as opposed to 1.5 tablespoons) and it worked...the sauce was a perfect consistancy. Impressed my date. Will definitely make this again.

Cut back cornstarch to one tablespoon. Use dried cranberries with apricot preserves. Make 8 chicken cutlets from 4 breast halfs, to cook faster. Easy to prepare, can be made ahead of time. Would make it for company.

I really loved this chicken recipe and so did my boyfriend! He raved about it all night! It's definitely a great date dish!!! I did add another tablespoon of apricot jelly and another tablespoon of honey to make it a little sweeter. I hope you like this as much as we did!

Very nice dish, well balanced between sourness and sweetness without being cloying. Needs a big fruity white wine without too much oak to match, we enjoyed it with Long Vineyards Pinot Grigio 1996 (California).

Cut down a little on the cornstarch, so sauce won't be so "gluey." delish. Served with Basmati rice and steamed sugar snap peas. Fresh pear salad with a fruity vinaigrette topped off the meal.

I'm a big pressure cooker fan, so I threw everything together in my pressure cooker and it turned out great. I always use fresh ginger root, though, and I at least doubled the number of apricots. Also, I deglazed with chardonnay.

Excelent recipe and extremely easy to prepare. I like to double the sauce and use fresh apricots or peaches when in season.

Tastes great and is very easy to make. Substituting onion for green onion doesn't affect the dish. It goes really well with (Bon Appetit's)Spiced Rice Pilaf recipe.
