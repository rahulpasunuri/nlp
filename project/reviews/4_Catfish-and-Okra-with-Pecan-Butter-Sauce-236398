Great quick and tasty recipe. Like other reviewers, I used fresh vegetables and reduced the amount of butter to 4 T; next time I'll go lower still. The catfish comes out really well roasted in a fast oven, and I was glad to be introduced to Old Bay seasoning. I will definitely make this again.

This was quite an expensive recipe for me. When I added the corn to the vegetables in the oven, I dropped a bit on my hot glass oven door and the oven door glass cracked!!!!! I was so surprised! I used fresh SC flounder instead of catfish and butter flavored high-end olive oil (from an specialty olive oil store) for the veggies. The recipe was outstanding! I will be making this one again soon!

I made this in two pans on the stove instead of in the oven. It was easy and very tasty!

Great dish! I was looking for a catfish meal that did not include tomato sauce nor frying the fish. I added a zucchini to the vegetables but that was the only change I made. The roasted vegetables were sweet.

Made this last night for my husband and I. Read past reviews and included sweet potato oven baked fries. It was a big hit The pecan sauce was delicious! We will have this again. Catfish was the cheapest fish at FishTale's our local fish monger and I was determined to find a recipe with pecans in it. IT was a great success!

This doesn't knock your tastebuds off or anything, but it's healthy, inexpensive, and very quickly prepared. Good for busy moms.

I'm always on the look out for fast and easy catfish fish recipes that I can easily convert to microwave cooking. This is one of them. Instead of roasting the veggies I nuked them in the order described in the recipe. Then I made my own Old Bay seasoning because I didn't have any on hand..I Googled to find out the recommended ingredients. Used the amount called for over the fish (subbing Basa for catfish this time...)and nuked that (in a covered glass casserole for about 8 minutes on high. As that was nuking I made the nuts. Viola, it was done in about 20 minutes and everyone including the kids, aged 7 and 8 loved it. This recipe is a real keeper. Nutritious and delicious!

Can anyone recommend another nut that would work with this recipe, for those of us who are allergic to pecans?

Great dish. I served it with sweet potato fries. Fresh okra instead of frozen. Also I had to bake the fish 15 mins. It was amazing. Definitely recommended!
