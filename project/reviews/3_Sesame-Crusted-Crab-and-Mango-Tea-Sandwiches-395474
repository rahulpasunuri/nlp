This was VERY good. I did change a couple things. I had just baked my own bread so when I cut the slices I left the crust on - and I didn't use the sesame seeds I had bought. However, with that being said.. I probably won't make it again. 1 lb of lump crab meat cost $28! I have another recipe I am using the rest of the crab meat for - but unless I am treating myself, I won't buy crab again.
