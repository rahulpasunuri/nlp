I realized at the last minute that we had run out of bacon (kids home from college) so I tossed in chopped walnuts with the onions. The toasted walnuts worked well.

This is our favorite way to eat mustard greens. It's a perfect fall salad and a great way to use greens from the CSA

I 've never used mustard greens before - so as I newcomer I thought this dish was easy to make and very good.

We grow mustard in our summer garden and this is a wonderful recipe for these spicy greens. We have one Atkins dieter and another on South Beach and it worked nicely for both paired with a grilled chicken breast. Nicely complemented by a crisp Italian Malvasia white wine. I did increase the proportion of balsamic vinegar and added a bit of salt.

I made this without the bacon and didn't miss it. Next time I'll double the amount of greens--it ultimately didn't yield very must after the greens wilted. I paired it with the dijon chicken breasts for a nice dinner.

One of the vendors at our local farmers market had fresh cut mustard greens. I had never before tasted this green and decided it was time to give it a try. Looked on this site for a recipe and this fit the bill, as we had all of the ingredients in house. The greens were delicious and a nice improvement to the usual salad greens. My wife and I both liked the mild bite that the greens have and we will purchase them again in the future. Very good recipe.

My first time cooking with mustard greens, and I thought they were fabulous! I used the bacon grease instead of olive oil. My husband loved this recipe--the kids were not as impressed.

I made this and tossed it with pasta--yum! I also cooked the bacon first, then drained all but a tablespoon of the fat, then used that to saute the onion and make the dressing. I think it added an extra flavor boost. Good for people looking to use up mustard greens!

I enjoyed this salad, but my husband didn't. Mustard greens can be a little harsh, but that is their appeal. And even though he didn't like it, you can see that I will probably make this again. Tip: Red onions worked nicely.
