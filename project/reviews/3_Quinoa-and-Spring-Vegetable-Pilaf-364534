Granted I edited somewhat, but I thought this was great. Boiled the quinoa in chicken stock, doubled the garlic and left off the mint. I also used chicken instead of vegetable stock for the pea puree, which I thought was a unique and delicious element of the dish. Overall, I thought this was healthy and filling, and would work as a side dish for a wide variety of things.

Good, but not great - has too much onion.

I'm not a big fan of mint, so I substituted fresh basil which I highly recommend! I served this dish alongside garlic/herb crusted pork tenderloin and it was a big hit. Next time I will add extra garlic and lemon as suggested by other users. Overall, a hearty and healthy dish that I'll look forward to making again. Also -- if you aren't being super health conscious, top off with parmesan ... delicious.

Quinoa is NOT a grain, it's a seed!

Epicurious has another recipe in the archives called "Spring Vegetable and Quinoa Pilaf" (!) -- and I think it is much better than this one. I found this one a bit too bland, partly because the peas drown out the asparagus and leeks. The other one has more variety of tastes and is more complex. Try it too.

I loved this recipe! I took the advice of reviewers - added an extra garlic clove, lemon and a healthy portion of cayenne pepper to the puree which REALLY made a difference. Also I love leaks so I used two (white and pale green parts only) and used olive oil instead of butter to saute. Forgot to put aside peas and mint for sprinkling on top - but it was still so delish. Next time I'm sure the presentation will be a little more successful too. Thank you for the great ideas. Recommended for a fresh Spring meal! Makes a pretty large portion so would be great to bring to a party.

ONLY because of suggestions from ibwatson (review below mine). I made this last night and am currently enjoying the leftovers. I used chicken stock instead of vegetable stock as suggested and added the cayenne and lemon to the puree - which really elevated the flavors in the recipe; without this minor addition the meal would have been very bland. I did not however have manchego cheese, so I grated some gruyere cheese which tasted delicious; next time I will try with manchego. All in all with these modifications this dish is worthy of four forks (and plenty of leftovers for the week; if only preparing for two)

Four forks with these changes (the recipe didn't call for ANY spices?! Come on, Bon Appetit!): - 1 or 2 teaspoons salt in the boiling water for the pilaf - Definitely use mint, not basil - Dash or two of cayenne in the sauce - Chicken broth instead of veggie broth (NOTE: if you're a vegetarian or vegan, make sure you use a quality, fragrant broth or make your own stock. This is essential) - Juice of half a lemon in the blender, too - Salt and pepper to taste over the veggies. - Don't mix the veggies with the quinoa. Serve it on top. - Grated Manchego cheese as well as the fresh chopped mint over the top - Serve with lemon wedge garnish for fresh-squeezed goodness

I wasn't really that excited about this and probably will not make it again. I did have to make some changes due to lack of ingredients. For instance, I used regular white mushrooms instead of shitake (I can only get the dehyrdrated variety, and I can't bare to spend the $$), which may have been the culprit. Also, I only had enough peas for the broth puree, and I only had dried mint on hand. It was good, but nothing more. ...the mint was a little surprising, and not in a good way.

Dish as whole was pretty bland; I agree with others that it needs something more. Garlic, red pepper? I liked the concept and will play with it, but not impressed 'as is'.

Really enjoyed how healthy this recipe was. Couldn't find quinoa so used wheatberries and loved the different textures all mixed together. Very healthy - only nine points on Weight Watchers for a big serving (using wheat berries). Advise using salt for taste.

I used frozen peas for puree but for the remainder used fresh peas. Omitted leek and shallot and substituted onion. This was a real hit at Easter dinner.

I loved this. Having read that some people found it bland, I added an extra clove of garlic and some hot pepper flakes to the pesto and made sure to season everything well. I didn't have mushrooms or shallots on hand so I used a medium yellow onion instead. We served it at Easter dinner and it was a hit.

Surprised at the comments. I found this recipe delicious with wonderful texture. I did not follow the instructions as written but used all of the ingredients and did not add the extras as per other reviews. Will definitely make again and pass on to family members who love quinoa but need new and fresh ways of preparing it.

I'm surprised no one has mentioned the blast of mint...perhaps I put too much in? Well I would do it again, because I loved the flavor of the mint combined with the nutty quinoa and mushrooms. This is the first "real" meal I made as a newlywed! and my husband had seconds =) We do agree that it needs a little something extra...I'm going to try it next time with more shallots and garlic...and perhaps some lemon juice.

It looks good on paper but bland on the plate. I love quinoa so I'll find it tasty prepared any way, but this recipe certainly needs a kick.

I did not care for this recipe at all. My boyfriend and I eat quinoa at least once a week, so I was excited to try this recipe. Everything tasted great, until I added the quinoa. We both took one bite and that was it.

This recipe made much more than the 4 entrée servings mentioned. It was good but not great. It tasted very fresh and very Spring like. We added lemon juice and Parmesan cheese as other mentioned which upped the flavors a bit.

Really yummy! Based on other reviews I added lemon juice and Parmesan cheese at the end. I also added in some crumbled chorizo while cooking the leeks! Great dish.

I don't normally like peas or mint in my food, so I used only 1 cup of peas in the pesto, and none in the dish. However, I'm so glad I made the pesto -- it was perfect! YUM. I also used chicken broth since I had it open and was using it for another part of the dish. I converted someone who thought he didn't like quinoa, either. He had seconds!

Really yummy. Used arborio rice instead of quinoa and tasted really nice and creamy. Used olive oil instead of butter to saute the veggies and they came out great. Also used basil and italian parsley instead of mint, and tasted fantastic. Spritzed with lemon at the end. Should have also added a dusting of parmesan. Will def make this again.

This is a tasty and healthy veg meal that can be enjoyed for dinner and the next couple of days for lunch. I agree with some of the other reviews in that it was missing a little something. I added some lemon juice at the end to brighten up some of the flavors and it worked well.

Great recipe but epicurious should know quinoa's not a grain. It IS a complete protein, however, and a great addition to a cook's arsenal!

Delicious recipe. I also added parmesan cheese to give it a little zip, Great dish and would definitely make it again. My girlfriends all asked for the recipe.

This is a great vegetarian recipe. Two notes: it makes more like 8 entree servings than the listed four. I also think it could be improved by some Parmesan cheese because it is missing some flavor complexity.

This exudes the fresh flavors of spring. We loved it! Though it seemed to call for a lot of mint it wasn't too minty and the other flavors were still bright. We used half the butter and the other half substituted soy butter but it would of been just as good, and healthier, with olive oil and no butter.
