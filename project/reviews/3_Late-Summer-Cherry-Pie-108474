My brother-in-law praised this pie, "You've made a lot of good things over the (40)years, but this is the BEST!"

Loved this pie. I did not add the cinammon, but otherwise followed the recipe. I did find it too liquidy, but after pulling it out of the oven I carefully poured the juice off into a separate bowl, and then the pie set beautifully. I saved the extra juices to pour over vanilla ice cream - yummy. I guess you could add more corn starch, but I was so happy with the final result I wouldn't change it, and just pour off the extra juice for another dessert. A great pie!

I did not care for this recipe. Although some people liked it fine, I really didn't think that the nutmeg and cinnamon did much of anything for the taste of the cherries. With the fresh cherries I used, I feel like it could have been wonderful, but the spices really killed the cherry flavor. Not great.

Yum! I used fresh sweet cherries from a friend's tree, poured off the extra juice (in accord with suggestions from other reviewers) , used a tangerine juice/peel instead of orange (there weren't good looking oranges at the store) and a bit less sugar than suggested, and a pre-made crust (due to time constraints). I would probably use less cornstarch next time, as I like the filling to be somewhat runny; as written the result was sort of unnaturally cohesive. The orange/almond/cinnamon combination provided a rich counterpoint to the bright, fresh cherry taste without overwhelming the cherries. Easy as could be!

First of all, the cherries were too sweet. Don't use sweet cherries. I used fresh cherries and combined with the extra juice and such, it was WAY too watery. Don't add any juice or water or anything. I won't make it again just because it was a lot of work and nobody ate it after one bite.

Although it took me a long time to prepare, the end results was a hit with my family. Next time I make this again, I'm going to reduce the amount of orange peel, it was a little too strong for my liking. I used frozen organic cherries which were great, but I should have drained the water when it defrosted. I ended up spooning some of the extra juice out for fear of it bubbling over. It was the first time I baked a cherrie pie and it won't be the last.

I made this pie last night for the first time and it was great. Tasted good and was easy to make.

Thought I would give sweet cherries a try and, NO, sour (tart) cherries-fresh or frozen- are the only ones to use for a cherry pie. personally, i buy mine frozen from a place in Michigan in 10 lb bags. makes about 6 pies with a bit of cherries leftover for someting else. Use Rose Levy B's pie crust recipe from the Bible.

This had an unusual flavor but I enjoyed it with a la mode(french vanilla) and I used unsalted butter instead of shortening for the crust.

Fresh cherry pie.... can't beat it. Pie crust is not overly flaky but very tasty. Omitted the cinnamon. Have made this many times with great results. Fresh cherries are much better than frozen.

Bing cherries alone don't add up to a good pie. Ranier or a 50% mix of Ranier and Bing works much better.

You can't make a good cherry pie from fresh cherries, especially dark cherries. Cherry pies should be made from tart cherry's, which are difficult to find fresh but can be found frozen. Frozen is fine; doesn't take anything away from the pie.

I thought this was a great recipe. However I didn't use the pie crust part. Used frozen. The filling pretty good.(used frozen cherries) I don't think I thawed them enough though, the filling was really runny. But tasted wonderful.

First of all - I will never stray again from my never fail pie crust recipe (Flaky Pie Crust BA June 2000). That wasn't the only problem though, the filling was horrible too. What's left of the pie is being thrown out tonight.
