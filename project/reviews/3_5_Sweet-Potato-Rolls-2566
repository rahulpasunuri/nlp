I'm not a cook - I know nothing about cooking/baking, but this recipe is absolutely fool-proof - impossible to make a mistake. And it's DELICIOUS. Good thing it makes a lot of rolls because my friends were almost fighting over the rest of the rolls to take home.

I was looking for a way to use up leftover roasted sweet potatoes, & this fit the bill, but I was skeptical about the graham cracker coating. It was a huge success. I simmered the skins in water to sub for the cooking water in the original recipe. The rolls are on the dense side, and sweet. My 8yo butter addict gobbled them down plain before she realized what she'd done. Made them for a family dinner and we're eating the rest for breakfast. We did add a half teaspoon of nutmeg for a subtle hint of spice.

I have a boyfriend who's obsessed with sweet potatoes. He took the LSAT last weekend and as a fun little reward, I made these rolls during the test. They were absolutely incredible!!! 10 forks, if you ask me :)

Each year for Thanksgiving I try a new roll recipe. Usually results are fine, just not repeat-worthy. Until now. We wanted something flavorful but healthier, so we nixed rolling them in the extra honey, butter & graham crumbs. (Though we did serve with herb butter--minced sage & a little lemon.) These were delicious, in spite of over-browning them a bit. We prepared them the night before & refrigerated after 1st rise, then warmed to room temp & baked just before dinner. Definitely on our menu for next year, or sooner.

Very tasty! I enjoyed it, my husband raved, I used it for sandwiches in the kids' lunchboxes. I bake yeast bread 3-4 times a week, so I was prepared for the amount of effort involved in a recipe like this. The nice part is that you can do a few things at a time and take a break and come back later. This is a good recipe for a football Sunday; you can do it while watching the games. If you want to simplify the process, you could use canned pumpkin puree instead of the fresh mashed sweet potato, but that would deprive you of the wonderful potato water, which does something magical to yeast breads. Another reviewer commented that their yeast wouldn't do anything--the most likely reasons this would happen would be if 1) the yeast was already dead when you bought it or 2) the sweet potato water was too hot and it killed the yeast on contact. The water should feel like nice bath water (not scalding) if you were to dip a finger in it. I skipped the graham cracker crumb part because I'm into the whole health thing, and couldn't imagine using another 2 sticks of butter and half-cup of honey in this bread recipe. I thought that would negate the health value of the 100% whole-wheat flour and the sweet potato, but I'm sure that step would make it even tastier.

I made four different kinds of rolls for Thanksgiving and these were the favorites. The sweetness and the extra graham cracker crunch went perfectly with the meal and were the top choice for little sandwiches later.

An awful lot of work for a recipe that is not that outstanding. I didn't have nay problem with the rolls not rising. In fact, I wound up with three large baking pans full of very fat rolls. I just didn't care for a) the flavor (rather bland) b) definitely not the graham cracker crumbs - much to crumbly Will look for a better roll recipe!

My dough never rose! Even after double the time. I baked them anyway, thinking they would lighten up in the oven, but unfortunately they didn't.

I have become the roll-maker for Thanksgiving and pretty much any other family function after bringing these last year. I haven't made a whole lot of recipes with yeast before, but this was not bad, even for a "beginner." Seemed a little tedious/time consuming for everyday, but the payoff is worth it. The rolls came out much lighter than I expected. And don't skip the graham cracker bit.

I haven't made these before, (have made similar rolls with sweet potatoes--they are subtly sweet with a very pretty color) but I wanted to address the comment from Orange Park. What you've heard about potato water is not true. The best, sweetest, softest dinner rolls on the planet are made from potato water. The starch in the potato is a perfect yeast growing medium--my potato rolls actually call for less yeast than other rolls.

A great Thanksgiving recipe. I don't like graham crackers so substitute amaretti cookie crumbs. These rolls make a superb sandwich with leftover turkey, havarti and mango chutney. Happy Holidays!

These are a great choice when you want something more interesting than the standard plain white dinner roll. I didn't use all of the flour called for, either. Grandma always said less flour equals a softer roll!

Great Rolls! You won't be disappointed - the flavor is fantastic.

This is an easy recipe that produces very yummy rolls. The crunch that the graham crackers provide add a nice touch.

My husband & I both really enjoyed these rolls. They were easy to make with a nice soft crumb and lovely flavor.

Delicious rolls! They went over very well at a dinner party. Don't skip the graham cracker crumbs - they create a perfect contrast in texture.

These are fantastic! The sweet potato flavor is subtle and the texture is soft. Mine didn't require all 4 cups of wheat flour.

I made these rolls two years in a row for Thanksgiving. My husband raved over them, but I am the "roll-maker" for our family celebrations, and other people didn't want competition from upstart rolls (they wanted me to stick with the varieties I have made for years). Well, last Thanksgiving, my brother-in-law asked where the potato rolls were and looked at me with shock when I said I didn't make them. Other people chimed in with praise, fondness and longing for these previously unsung rolls. My husband says they are perfect because they require no butter, jelly or jam. Well, we will be having them again this holiday--along with the tradionals!

These rolls were light and sweet. The texture was good. the flavor was good. They were easy to make. and had a good presentation. The dough was just a little too sticky to handle without getting messy hands. I did discard the potato water and used reconstituted dry milk in stead. (I have heard that potato water can contain an emzyme that inhibits yeast.)
