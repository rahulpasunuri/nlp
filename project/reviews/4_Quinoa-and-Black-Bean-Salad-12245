This recipe is great! Thanks for the cooking tip from another reviewer. No need to complicate things as the recipe lays out. I left out the corn and switched the green bell pepper for an orange one. Also, if you like things a little spicy, just use 1 jalapeño but keep the seeds. I also added a little Paprika and cayenne pepper, which gave the salad a nice kick as well. Will definitely be making this over and over again!

This is a great salad as is, even better with some diced onion and avocado added. Kind of an outdated steaming method though. I get fluffy, dry quinoa by simmering covered for 12 minutes, fluff with a fork, cover the pot with a kitchen towel, then the lid and let it steam for 10 minutes. The towel absorbs all the condensation from the lid while it finishes cooking.

This is "smack-yo-mama" good! Frankly, for me, it's one of the best things I've ever eaten. It's ridiculously healthy for you, and the flavors blend with each other perfectly, yet are still distinctive. I don't think you'd ever tire of this, and it's (obviously) very flexible and adaptable to many other varieties.

Surprisingly yummy! Even my hubby enjoys it. Used regular jalapeno instead, fresh cilantro and one lime. Will definitely make it again with shrimp or chicken.

Delicious! As with most quinoa salads, I always double the dressing, and added cherry tomatoes for colour/variety. I made enough to last me the week for lunch and, on day 3, had to share with my coworkers after they complained I was hogging it all to myself. Can't go wrong with this one.

We've made this recipe over and over again. It is very filling and we've served it by itself for a light lunch or as a side dish to chicken, pork and fish. It keeps very well in the refrigerator for a few days. Great way to incorporate a vegetarian protein to a meal.

Agree that this is fabulous recipe. I do think all the fuss to rinse the quinoa is a bit much for the outcome of the grain. Will make it again but might substitute the quinoa with farro.

I always want to love quinoa...but most of the time, I just don't. It is so often lacking in flavor. This recipe is fantastic. Granted, all that boiling, draining, steaming, chopping, etc. takes some time...but the pay-off is worth it. I used regular jalapeno chilies and red bell pepper for a little color variety. Otherwise, made as suggested...the deceptively simply dressing is a winner:)

Finally found a recipe with quinoa that I like! I had never cooked the quinoa in this manner (steaming like couscous) but it really did make it light and fluffy. Substituted 1 fresh jalapeno instead of pickled jalapeno and used dried coriander instead of fresh. I also used some hot seasoned salt to add more spices. I will definitely be making this again.

I have made this twice, doubling both times. I followed the recipe exactly and both times it came out beautifully. I used canned beans and frozen corn although we have local corn now, so next time I will try roasting that instead. My guests of all ages, on both occasions, were very complimentary.

I made this as an accompaniment to fish tacos - to my surprise, my dinner guests put the quinoa salad in their tacos and raved about how good they were! I cooked tri-quinoa (red and white quinoa mix) in vegetable broth instead of steaming as suggested. I added fresh cilantro - assuming this is what they meant by coriander which is actually the seeds of the cilantro as I understand (I'm often wrong). I love cilantro and it really added a great flavor to this dish. I would definitely add this to my "I can take this anywhere to pot lucks" list!

My family loved this salad!!! I used nacho jalapeno (hot and only about half of small jalapeno) only because I couldn't find pickled.

Used carrot juice for cooking the quinoa, which creates a nice sweet flavor and orange color. Changed the green to red peppers, doubled the dressing, and left out the red wine vinegar. Loved the flavor combination and served it on butter lettuce cups for luncheon! The pickled jalepenos added the perfect amount of heat and flavor...will make again and again.

A great salad, and always very popular. I updated it by using fresh jalapenos, seeds and ribs removed and diced very small. I use a cup of diced red bell pepper for color and crunch. I've never used the corn and I don't think it needs it. The rinsing and steaming makes a very light fluffy grain and it doesn't add that much work. This is one of the few four forks I've ever given. It is really terrific.

This was a fantastic salad! It was really tasty just as the recipe was written. I made it with frozen corn and it worked out well. It was a quick dinner. I served it under sauted chicken & onions. My husband went back for thirds! Definately will make again. I might use a little more cumin next time.

A delicious and nutritious recipe. The only change I wanted to make was to the dressing, where I added a teaspoon or so of honey. It created a depth of flavor without being too sweet and complemented the salad perfectly.

YUM! This was so good, hearty, full of flavor and best of all, so nutritious and healthy! I did use a fair amount of substitutions because I didn't have all the listed ingredients, and it still ended up delicious. I substituted cooked red lentils for black beans, white wine vinegar for red wine vinegar, lemon juice for lime juice, and added chopped sautéed carrots, celery, onion and garlic. Be sure to add enough cumin and coriander for full flavor, and also the JalapeDos, all of which really made this quinoa recipe POP! This one's a keeper, and my 12 year old loved it!!

This is quite good. Added avocado and tomatoes. Roasted the corn first and made it into a salsa with the dressing - chilled several hours prior to mixing it in with the rest. 1 1/2 cups of quinoa was a little too much though.

I have tried many combinations of this recipe but this is the best so far. I have added more vegetables I put in what ever I have and what we like.

Excellent recipe! Made this to go along with BLTs, and it was a perfect summer dish. I substituted cilantro for the coriander, and fire roasted green chiles for the jalapeno to give it a little different taste. I cooked the quinoa in my rice cooker due to time constraints, and it turned out great.

This recipe is awesome! It's so simple...and wow...I was amazed at the deep flavor of this!! I didn't have pepper so I used fresh snow peas from the garden and I didn't have jalepenos so I added a cayenne pepper, also from the garden. You really could add anything to this. Mmm!

I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand, so I substituted (and added) a few things- celery instead of green pepper (though I did add a few blanched red peppers that I had frozen) and apple cider vinegar instead of red wine vinegar. I had no cilantro; I'm sure that would have made this even more enjoyable! But, it was delicious- even my 2 year old gobbled it up!

I was cooking with quinoa for the first time and made a few recipes. This recipe was the favorite. I substituted picked jalapenos for fresh. In the future I will consider adding a pinch of cayenne to the salad dressing to spice it up a bit more. Also, when I add quinoa I add until I am pleased with the quinoa:vegi/bean balance. I will be making this recipe again soon!

DON'T BE AFRAID OF QUINOA! I just make it like rice - except less water. If you rinse the quinoa you probably need less than 1 1/2 cups water to one cup quinoa. And rinsing it 5 times? Are you nuts? I don't even rinse it at all sometimes - and it's FINE! But if you don't rinse it, do 1 1/2 cups of water to 1 cup quinoa. There was too much dressing - it was a bit soggy - but probably because I didn't 'dry out' the quinoa like the recipe called for. I made this with red quinoa (stronger taste), no peppers (don't like 'em). People loved it! Even my husband, who didn't like the red quinoa the first time I tried it (we usually have the 'white' type).

This has become a favorite! Everyone likes it ( as long as they are cilantro fans) and it is perfect for any vegans on the scene. I have found using more black beans, corn and not necessarily all the cooked quinoa is the best - just add until it looks the ratio of quinoa/ vegies thet you'd like.And just thawing frozen corn works fine. Also, I sprinkle halved cherry tomatoes around the top, the juice from the tomato adds to the flavor of each bite, and gives the extra color! Great for picnics & tailgates!

This recipe is a revelation! I did not have jalapeños, so I used 1/4 tsp. of chipotle powder instead (love that smoky flavour). I also grilled the corn on the BBQ for added complexity. This one is a keeper.

Very good. I made the quinoa according to package directions. I didnt have either jalapeno or cilantro. I substituted chili powder for the jalapeno and since my husband doesnt like cilantro anyway, that was fine. I also used edamame instead of corn.

I've made this recipe several times and I love it. It's really simple but compulsively edible, and goes well with harissa-based sauces. Like a lot of other reviewers, I haven't bothered to steam the quinoa, just boiled it, and have been happy with the results. I use balsamic vinegar instead of red-wine vinegar for marinading the black beans, and for convenience sake I've substituted one fresh jalapeño for the pickled jalapeños.

Superb. I made this salad for a party, so I doubled the recipe. People raved about it and even took some home to eat the next day. I followed the suggestions of others and substituted basalmic vinegar for red-wine vinegar, cooked the quinoa with half of the cumin powder, used canned black beans (rinsed), substituted yellow and red bell peppers for green, and slightly steamed organic frozen corn to save time in the preparation. I made a couple of other adjustments as well. I always cook quinoa with chicken broth instead of water and I used boxed red quinoa. I cooked the quinoa according to the instructions on the box, however I cooked it for 5 minutes longer, and after it was cooked I placed a paper towel between the pot and the lid and let it rest for 5 minutes. Since I had them on hand I used a combination of hatch green chili peppers and fresh jalapeno with the seeds removed from both instead of pickled jalapenos.

Rating: 3
I have made this three times in past month - always great, always tweaking ingredients depending on what I have. Most recently, I only had 1/2 cup of quinoa in the pantry. I was afraid the proportions for the other ingredients wouldn't be good with smaller amount of quinoa, so I added wheat bulgur. 1/2 cup of dry wheat bulgur, covered with some of the boiling water I had used for cooking the corn - turned out great! The bulgur enhanced the texture even further, plus boosted the fiber content!

Okay...GREAT base for a recipe, but, as any of us do, I mutated and tweaked it a bit. Instead of the Quinoa I used Bulgar Wheat. When I was cooking the Bulgar wheat, I added half the cumin to the water so that the wheat took on that lovely flavor. Also, I didn't use the pickled jalapenos, I grilled the jalapenos with the corn and that gave them a much better flavor. The salad was gone within 10 minutes of putting it out...a HUGE hit. Also...add some lime zest to the salad dressing. YUM

Love this salad, is always a big hit at Mexican themed potlucks. If you like it a bit spicy-er, replace some of the vinegar tossed in the black beans with some juice from the pickled jalapenos. I also use red bell pepper, it makes it so pretty, and just a tad sweeter.

Rating: 3
My first quinoa experience... Delicious! I used Trader Joe's red quinoa and cooked according to box. Only substitution was roasted Hatch green chiles for the jalapenos. Very tasty and awesome texture. I would substitute frozen corn (gently cooked) next time for expediency. Will definitely be a regular on my table.

I tried this recipe for a birthday party at the weekend. I replaced the bell peppers and corn with chopped datterini (small Italian tomatoes), celery and green onions. I also replaced the jalapenos with red chillies. As suggested by an earlier reviewer, I used balsamic instead of wine vinegar, which added a nice level of sweetness to the piquancy of the lime. A big hit with party goers, especially the guest of honour. Because I had leftover beans, I decided to use the recipe again tonight but alter the formula a bit. Instead of quinoa, I used farro. The trick here is to cook it for five minutes less so that it remains a bit al dente and soaks up the liquids. I replaced the green onions in my earlier version with two cloves of garlic, minced. I added pumpkin seeds as well, which upped the crunch factor. Delicious.

This is a simple and healthy salad that will make frequent appearances in my kitchen. I had a plastic handled sieve so I ended up making the quinoa by the box directions. Still turned out good. Also subbed fresh jalepenos, frozen corn, and red bell peppers. Per the recommendation of others I used balsamic vinegar - fabulous! Leftover Tip: use leftovers in a taco salad. Just toss the quinoa salad with crisp romaine, seasoned taco meat, shredded cheddar, and crumble a few Red Hot Blues chips on top. Yummy and super easy!

I couldn't follow the directions regarding the quinoa, so I followed the box's directions instead. I used 4 large ears of corn instead of the 2 called for. Also, I added a little more lime.

I'm going to add chicken to the leftovers and eat tonight as a entree.

I was wonderfully surprised by this recipe. Substitutions - red pepper for green and edamame for the corn. Otherwise followed quite closely. The flavors all worked together very well, and I thought the combo of red wine vinegar and then the lime dressing really spiced this up. We had it as a side dish, but then threw in leftover chicken so I'll eat it for lunch the rest of the week.

Okay - I loved the idea of this recipe, and I would almost give it four forks. But I don't think the acids are as balanced as they could be ...

I added a bit more cumin to the dressing, and used 1/4 less quinoa since that's all I had on hand but it ended up being the perfect ratio.

After having tried many black bean salads, this is an excellent one. I did 1 cup quinoa because I was a bit short and would do this again.

This recipe was a real success. I made a couple of modifications: I used only 3/4 cup quinoa (I didn't have any more on hand.) I used frozen corn instead of corn on the cob (I simply mixed it in frozen; didn't cook it at all.) I used 1/2 a red pepper instead of a green pepper. I added chopped onion, but did not use the jalapenos. I probably used more than 1/4 cup of cilantro. The dressing is wonderful (I used bottled unsweetened lime juice.) A rave. And healthy.

Oh, puh-leeze! This is just a jumping off point for a truly great salad. I cooked the quinoa as I would rice, that is, 2 parts water to 1 part quinoa, for 18 minutes, let it cool and in the meantime, added to the other ingredients some chopped cabbage, chopped romaine, chopped green onion, edamame beans, substituted red pepper for the bell, some jicama, and about 1/4 lb. crumbled feta.

I have made this twice, and both times have been asked for the recipe. There wasn't a significant taste or texture difference when I prepared the quinoa as the recipe instructs versus just boiling it for 20 minutes - the quinoa is just a little drier and fluffier, but boiling it is less labor intensive. I used one fresh jalapeno instead of the pickled ones. I love this recipe for a nice lunch or to bring to a potluck.

I served it over a bed of mixed baby greens and it was a wonderful one dish meal. Absolutely delicious. We both loved it.

Very nearly perfect. I used whole wheat couscous rather than quinoa. One cup cooked according to package directions and frozen corn from Trader Joe's. Put the corn in the bowl and dumped the hot couscous on top which was sufficient to thaw the corn.

Made this last night to go with the Chipotle Burgers on this site. This was a very tasty salad that's perfect for the summertime with a meat side. I did not steam the quinoa since I had never done it before and didn't have time to fiddle around with it. I also used 1 fresh jalapeno pepper and added tomatoes for my hubby who doesn't like corn. I agree with a previous reviewer that 1 cup of quinoa would be enough. 1 1/2 cups made a LOT.

I made this dish over the weekend, but substituted some quickly sauteed zucchini in place of the bell pepper (I had some on hand). Worked really well.

Used red bell pepper instead of green and fresh jalapenos instead of pickled. The red makes it very pretty. Great for lunch and though I eat meat I like that this is complete nutrition without the bad cholesteral and fat of meat.

an absolute winner! so healthy, satisfies vegan diets and a multitude of flavor with a light quinoa backdrop. i chose to grill my corn on the cob after bathing it in water & balsamic vinegar for extra kick. and i used chipotle chilis which went well with the grilled corn.

Outstanding. This is the first time I've prepared quinoa, and the good reviews led me to try this recipe -- I was not disappointed! Used fresh jalepeno rather than pickled, otherwise made as the recipe specifies. Even the kids like this! Will make again soon.

This was delicious! I'll admit, the prepping and cooking of the quinoa is a bit of a pain, but it's worth it. I only used 1 cup of quinoa because that's all I had, and I think it was the perfect amount. I also skipped the jalapeno and didn't miss it. Flavorful, fresh, healthy and delicious! I might try grilled chicken or shrimp on top of this too.

this is a great summer time salad. i had to sub in kidney beans for the black beans, and a zuchini for the green pepper. DELICIOUS! i love the cilantro in this recipe. plus, i added some buckwheat as i only had about half the amount of quinoa.

This salad is excellent. I made this for a BBQ and 3 people requested the recipe. This is a great potluck dish. I've also made it for my lunch and added chicken for a one dish meal.

Easy, healthy, delicious! Just a little different from the regular salads that it will be a sure hit at your next party!

Wow, this was refreshing and just what I wanted on a hot May day in South Carolina. I used a mix of bulgur and quinoa (a red heirloom variety) and nixed the bell pepper. I will make this often! My overnite guest wanted it again for lunch the next day and asked for the recipe! As a frequent quinoa eater, I thought steaming it really made a difference. Also, to cut down on the fat I did half olive oil and half water. Enjoy!

This recipe is truly wonderful. Great flavor, great texture. I subbed in a fresh jalepeno for the pickled, and a red pepper for the green. Toasted the quinoa first in a little olive oil, too. Even better the next day! I'm making it again less than a week later.

This was super easy to make. Took me about 35 mins while distracted and talking on the phone. I totally forgot to add the jalepeno (will do next time) and didn't have coriander and it still tasted great. I also subbed red bell pepper for green due to personal preference. The dressing would be good on many other things as well.

My family and friends all love this dish, and I have made it at least 5-10 times already. I add red onion and skip the jalapenos due to one family-member's inability to eat very spicey foods. I also use red, yellow, and orange bell peppers instead of green. I think the taste of extra virgin olive oil is better than other varieties in this dish. I've been happy using super sweet frozen corn, since fresh is out of season. Also, I find that the quinoa cooks just fine in my rice cooker, and using a no-need-to-rinse brand, makes it very convenient to make. It keeps so well and makes such a great leftover dish, that I always double the recipe.

This was my first experience with quinoa and it was a delight to cook and eat. I simmered the 1.5c quinoa in 3c water for 10 minutes, added 1.5c frozen corn and kept covered for an additional 5 min. I added avocado and cherry tomatoes per others' suggestions and it was delicious. I thought there was a bit too much quinoa compared to other ingredients so next time I will cut back to 1c. And there will be a next time...

Made this as part of a Mexican inspired menu for my son's B-day party. It was a wonderful way to eat quinoa (esp. for the vegetarians). I used red peppers instead of green and added diced sweet onions. I also think that it was too much quinoa. I would reduce it to 1 cup of quinoa or slightly less. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and I really loved it. Very flavourful and will definitely make it again.

This is a come-back-to recipe for us. It works great for dinners, picnics, parties, etc. It is also adaptable to whatever veggies or other ingredients you may have. I suggest making the quinoa with chicken broth for added richness.

Rating: 3
I didn't have any coriander and instead used diced less than half of a fresh jalapeno... I don't know how that'd compare with pickled, but it was plenty of heat for me. I can see how the coriander/cilantro would definitely be a pleasant complement. This was quick and tasty.

Quinoa has only within the past year become my chosen "grain" for salads and side dishes. I made this with dried blackbeans, soaking overnight, etc. Also, having made this once with EVOO, I opted this time for light olive oil. The extra virgin seemed a bit overbearing and burdensome. Colleagues at the college Xmas party AND my neighbors at the Christmas Open House enjoyed it completely, even tho' NO one had ever heard of quinoa before! I had to copy the recipe for them to take home. **Possibly could use a bit more lime juice &/or more jalepeno pepper

Really enjoyed this recipe, so healthful and tasty. I added small cut up tomatos and cilantro and found that to be a great addition. Really enjoyed and recommend!

Okay. Okay. I know this is a superbly healthful dish, and for that it gets two stars. But, the flavor is awfully bland; boring really. If I ever make it again I will turn up the heat and seasonings in the dressing.

I love this salad. I ate something similar in our local Wild Oats grocery store deli and immediately bought a box of quinoa to duplicate the recipe but the ones on the box were kind of bland. This recipe is very close though and I have to keep myself from gorging on the leftovers. I'm not a big fan of black beans and my husband is not a fan of corn but we love this salad anyway. I add some purple onion to it and we're weenies when it comes to hot stuff so I add very little hot pepper. The quinoa brand I buy at Wild Oats does not need rinsing and the texture of the salad is still okay if it isn't steamed, just make sure to fluff it out on a plate after boiling and rinsing and let it dry as it cools. The touch of cumin in the recipe really makes it great. Canned black beans work fine, just rinse them well. Yum, yum, yum.

This is an excellent salad. The flavors blend so well together. I used red pepper instead of green and liked the sweetness it added. The salad is even better the next day and makes a great lunch.

Great salad and healthy! I always get questions on what the grain is and where to get it. Here in SoCal you can find it at Mother's or sometimes Trader Joe's. I usually put in some quartered cherry tomatos as well. Easy and crowd pleasing.

Rating: 3
Excellent! Have it made it several times w/no leftovers. Roasting the corn, 1/2 a diced onion, and jalapenos before adding them to the beans is nice. Used more corn, but that's a personal choice. Did not use canned black beans--cooked Bayless's mexican pot beans this afternoon and used some in this recipe (but have made it w/canned beans before).

This is incredible! The dressing is perfect, and I love the combination of ingredients. It's also healthy, so I can eat as much as I want.

This was very tasty, but as a vegetarian main dish the ratio of black beans to quinoa seemed low. I added another 1 cup of cooked black beans (for a total of about 2 1/2 cups) to make the dish more substantial.

Excellent dish. Received many compliments when I took it to a potluck, and the vegetarians in the group loved it - the non-veg crowd went for it too. Steaming the quinoa is not strictly necessary, but does give a nicer texture.

Yet another Epicurious masterpiece! I added some finely sliced red onion and chopped broccoli in lieu of the bell peppers (I don't jive with bell peppers). The lime juice and cumin really makes this dish special. Tastes so good you won't give a second thought to how healthy it is.

The doctor said to eat better and I had some quinoa from kingarthurflour.com (what a great source for products). Considering the healthy aspects of this recipe, low fat - low calorie - high in calcium and iron, it is exactly what the doctor ordered. When I rate a recipe I try very hard to rate the recipe. I inadvertently left out the red-wine vinegar and it was not missed. The limes I used were acidic enough and very complimentary to the corn (which I did not cook, just used raw-added nice crunch). I also love the way the quinoa balls pop, kinda like caviar.

Fantastic! This is a refreshing and wonderful new dish. I took the advise and steamed the quinoa...perfect. Also used mint instead of cilantro and used 2 ears of corn cut from the cob, pan fried with red onion. If you have never tried quinoa, this is one you should.

I just love these kinds of dishes! The flavors are so simple and wholesome but just so positively delicious! OH yum yum yum. I love to serve company things that you can't just get in any restaurant, and so far, I've still never seen quinoa anywhere but from my kitchen. Served this salad with Southwestern grilled salmon and it was so wonderful.

I've made this recoipe both by "steaming" and by "boiling" the quinoa. It is worth the slight extra trouble to steam the quinoa. The recipe benefits, as noted below, from a bit more heat (more jalopenos) and more tart (more lime/lemon). A very nice dish.

I love this salad. So refreshing, light and good for you! I added a couple TB of lemon juice and orange juice to the dressing, which gave it a nice flavor. I used red bell pepper and used mint instead of cilantro. Wonderful. Next time, I'll add some finely chopped red onion.

I took this to a luncheon recently and had at least five people ask for the recipe. It was absolutely delicious. I made a few changes, the most significant of which was using the Ancient Harvest Inca Red heirloom variety of quinoa cooked according to package directions. Since I cannot tolerate hot foods, I left the jalapenos out, but threw in a little chili powder. I also used frozen, super sweet corn.

I "boiled" the quinoa and it was fine. I didn't have corn on hand so I made it without and served it on a bed of mache with avacado and grapefruit sections and lots of cilantro on top. Yum! My partner loved this dishand he won't usually eat quinoa when i make it (I eat it like brown rice with steamed veggies and sriracha hot sauce and soy sauce).

This was my first time trying quinoa and I was a bit hesitant. I followed other reviewer suggestions and simmered the quinoa, not steaming it. I also added avocado, green onion, and lots of cilantro.....FABULOUS! I've already passed the recipe on to friends who've never heard of quinoa and I look forward to making this dish again.

I made this with a variety of other dishes for a surf and turf dinner party. I guess I had too many dishes because I completely forgot to serve the dressing with this salad. Despite the lact of dressing, this was one of the favorites (even moreso than the lobster and steak, which were made with a recipe from this site). I personally did not care for the taste. I used aduki beans instead of black beans b/c I did not have any black beans, and I think that that hurt the taste quite a bit. I will definitely make it again, with black beans, though, because it is so healthful and everyone else liked it.

I had some quinoa left over from another dish, so I didn't need to worry about the steaming. The cooked texture seemed fine, though. This is a nice, easy salad that seemed to make everybody happy, and they had no idea that they were eating something healthy!

So good... Just in case anyone didn't know, quinoa was one of the most sacred foods of the ancient Incas of South America. They called it the Mother Grain, and each year the Incan emperor, using a golden spade, planted the first quinoa seeds of the season...

What a great use for quinoa. I found a quinoa brand (Bob's Red Mill--love their stuff) that doesn't need to be rinsed, which speeds things up. I also added a minced garlic clove, minced chipotle pepper and a touch of honey to the dressing--nice balance of sweet and spicy.

Very good light dinner -- my only additions were some chopped red onion and avocado. Simmering the quinoia for 10 minutes and then letting it rest covered off the heat for 10 minutes gave excellent results. Served with hot corn tortillas with butter and salsa and a green salad. Good summer meal.

This dish is great with grilled meat, and the leftovers travel well enough for lunch at the office the next day. I use frozen corn: toss it in, straight from the freezer, with the hot quinoa - result is exactly the right temperature.

Great recipe - i make it at least once a week in the warm months. But DO NOT try to steam the quinoa. It is not worth the trouble at all. I boil 2 1/4 c. of water with the 1 1/2 c. quinoa. Bring to a boil and let simmer on very low for 20 minutes. The just fluff with a fork. I also add extra line juice and extra cilantro. And canned corn and black beans work just fine. enjoy!

My husband and I really liked this a lot. It makes a nice change from the usual salads made with pasta or rice. I also used the quicker cooking method recommended by another reviewer for the quinoa, and it turned out very well. I used canned corn instead of fresh, since it's not in season at the moment. I am sure we will be making this recipe frequently, especially during the summer!

I made this recipe because I'd just found black quinoa in a Middle East shop near my office. It was a wonderful treat & I think the black quinoa (actually different shades of browns, tans) made for a much more interesting presentation than regular quinoa. A perfect dish for a summer BBQ.

A lovely summer refresher! I used fresh jalapenos for a sharper bite, and subbed chives for the coriander (I need ways to use up the abundant crop of chives in my yard!). Even with the substitutions, it still garnered great reviews from my family! Also, I steamed the quinoa per usual in my rice steamer, with no adverse effects (the recipe preparation is a little too involved!).

Rating: 3
Quick, easy, flavorful, excellent! I had to halve it because there are only two of us, and there was plenty left over to carry in lunches. It didn't lose texture or flavor like so many grain/pasta salads do. As a matter of fact, there is a lot of dressing liquid that is absorbed by the quinoa overnight. The next time I make it I will, however, try another quinoa trick: simmer 1 part quinoa in 2 parts water 10 minutes, remove from heat, let sit (covered) 5 minutes. I think that will be simpler and require fewer utensils and towels.

I have made this several times to rave reviews. It's an unusual dish since most people are unfamiliar with quinoa. It's easy to make and a great summer party dish since it makes quite a bit.
