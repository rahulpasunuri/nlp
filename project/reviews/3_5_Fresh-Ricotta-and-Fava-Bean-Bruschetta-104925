I'm giving this two stars as is because just from reading the ingredients, I could tell it would be bland. I chose to pretty much use it as a base for my own idea. I doctored mine up quite a bit and it was a huge success at the dinner party that I brought it to. I tossed 3-4 minced cloves of garlic into the food processor along with the lima beans, gave it a few pulses to coarsely chop, added the juice of half a lemon, salt, fresh black pepper, olive oil and chopped basil and gave it all a good mix. After all these changes, it was quite delicious. The lemon brightened the flavors and the garlic and basil gave it a nice kick. The ricotta was complimentary to the lima beans. I'll be making it again, but with my original changes!

This recipe helped me re-create a dish I had at Terzo a few weeks ago, a fabulous restaurant in San Francisco. Terzo's version was ricotta, honey, mint and fava. I used fresh ricotta, and for those of you who did not, I can understand why your dish wasn't quite right. It really makes a difference. Fresh can be hard to find, if you can, try to find whole milk ricotta. I know whole milk isn't for everyone, but it does give the dish a lot of flavor. I also put a little olive oil in the ricotta, because the waitress at Terzo said that is what they do, to make it creamy. I am not sure if I did it right, it didn't make much of a difference. I sprinkled the honey and mint on the ricotta and then topped it with the favas. I used an olive bread, but it was a sour dough and that over powered the dish. So I plan to stick with a peasant bread next time.

I made this using fresh burrata instead of ricotta - super creamy but a little saltier and definitely richer than ricotta. I can see why some reviewers might have found this recipe bland as-is. I thought everything else was perfect, the garlic, basil and beans are a wonderful combination, but using a slightly more flavorful cheese (not goat cheese or anything that strong - that would overpower the fresh spring taste), or at least a little kosher salt and pepper on top would probably give it just enough of a boost to make this come alive. I love it when fava beans are in season, I can't get enough of them, and this is one of my favorite ways to show them off!

I found this recipe to be pretty bland. I didn't use fresh ricotta. So, maybe that was the problem?

Just okay. I used fresh fava, but only had sheeps milk cheese. Maybe ricotta would have made a big difference? I don't know. I am not a fan of ricotta. I need to find a better fava recipe!

I love bruschetta with ricotta and this was a nice use of the favas we had from our CSA share. I didn't add garlic or basil, but I did drizzle with balsamic, sea salt and ground pepper. Easy as an appetizer or a snack. The fresh ricotta makes it.

Nah. I feel like you would need lots and lots of favas to have their taste come out over the garlic and cheese. I think I'll stick to mozza, tomato, and basil.

Great summer starter - it was light and fresh, but I also felt it lacked a bit of flavour. Next time I'll try to get more of the garlic juices on the toast and will use a bit more olive oil to drizzle.

So simple yet so wonderful. It is also very beautiful with the white cheese and the green basil and beans. It looks like a nice treat to serve at a garden party--casual elegance. Everyone loved this recipe.

Love this recipe. But why is everybody peeling fava beans? Especially if they are young and tender, there is no reason to toss all that fiber and flavor down the garbage disposal!

When all the ingredients are fresh, this delight is elegant, sweet and savory - a spring-time treat.

This dish was a big hit! Always looking for ways to use fava beans and this one is wonderful. I would recommend looking for the fresh ricotta- it was a great treat!

Good flavors, but the hummus was a bit dry and grainy when made with lima beans. Added some milk the next day to thin it. (Would have used yogurt, but I didn't have any). Made red bell pepper, onion and tomato saute the same day for bruschetta, and it was much better than the hummus, so I spread them both on the garlic toasts. THAT was excellent.

What could be better than fava beans, garlic and sweet cheese? I've made this twice as a quick appetizer and it's a fantastic combination.
