The Consoletti girls add thyme and extra garlic. Slow roasting is the key. Authentic and great way to prepare extra tomatoes for canning. Tip: remove tomato skins after roasting.

I used the ingredients in this recipe but baked it like a confit I saw on Martha Stewart. Turned out great and very pretty too. I didn't as much oil like the other person said and it was fine without the extra calories.I took the leftovers to work the next day and the flavor intensified! A definite yum!

I make this recipe at least twice a month. Use less olive oil - it's more healthful and the taste is still delicious.
