Easy and perfect. I used boiling white wine instead of water to pour over the goose. I'm not sure if it made enough of a difference to justify doing it again. I also stuffed the cavity with parsley, sage, and garlic in addition to the onions and celery.

Onions? Yes! Parsley? Sage? Yes! Temperature 425 degrees NO! higher by about 50 degrees and keep the goose (gander) off the bottom of the roasting dish but do not baste. The fats from the pricked skin is quite enough and no basting is required. Oh, yes, I breed my own ganders. Keep the livers, they make wonderful pate. Try again please it is worth the effort.

For anyone who has never had a goose before and doesn't know anyonw who has - my husband and I tried ths recpe for Christmas dinner, and while it tasted fine, we won't do it again. It just wasn't that special to justify the cost and work involved. I think this is a good recipe for goose, though, if you are going to try it. Ours came out moist and not oily as I had heard goose could be from the one person I could find who had tried it thirty years ago. The gravy had a good flavor, although ours was fatty.

We had this for a family-and-friends feast this evening. I adapted the recipe a bit - I always do - and combined the goose-roasting methods from Julia Child with the recipe given here. We stuffed the goose with this chestnut and sausage stuffing, using homemade chicken stock for both the gravy and the stuffing instead of canned broth, and lamb, garlic and herb sausage instead of pork sausage for the stuffing. It was fabulous, a big hit with us and with our guests.

I made this last year for a large family dinner. Many people had never had goose and it was my first time cooking one. It was absolutely delicious. One of the few times after a huge prep, that I really loved the results and ate my share. We're doing it again this year.

This Christmas (2003) makes the 4th year for this dish. It's the best goose recipe ever and with the port gravy added is absolutely fantastic.

MAKE SURE you follow the directions for the gravy TO THE LETTER. I didn't, and it turned into a yucky, roux-y glop that was inedible. Otherwise, the goose was perfectly cooked and delicious!

Outstanding. I tried this for Christmas a couple of years ago and received nothing but raves from family and friends. And as other reviewers have noted, the gravy is especially good.

If your going to make goose, this is the way to go. I used the bottom half of a dutch oven and a rack to lift the goose up and I tented foil over the top for all but the first half hur of cooking. The gravy was soooo good. It got raves from my guests and I thought it was very good, too (if I don't say so myself).

I had 12 friends over, they all loved it. For the most part, I followed the receipe without modification and it turned out moist and not greasy. In order to have enough liquid to make gravy, I basted the goose with most of a bottle of chardonnay. I also added quite a bit more port than was called for to make a richer gravy. It was quite good.

I had never had goose before, much less cooked one,and this recipe was easy and delicious. I didn't even turn it once and it was very moist. I added 3/4 cup of the Tawny Port to the gravy and it was mucho flavorful. The family verdict: The goose is good, but the gravy is fantastic ! Even the young ones loved it !

I have cooked goose every New Years Day for 32 years. This is the first time I've been really proud to serve it. I'm an excellent cook but I have in the past found goose difficult to cook.

Perhaps it was the port wine that I purchased but I could hardly taste the difference in the gravy. I thought it was okay but a lot of work at the end.

I used this and the Scandinavian recipe that also appears on this site as a guide.I stuffed the goose with sage and onion dressing (also on this site) but I do not think I would stuff it again.I turned the goose every 30 minutes and that gave a good crisp skin(use rubber gloves it makes it very easy).I thought the meat was great -a bit dry but no grease at all.

The MOST terrific recipe for goose which also works well for duck, pheasant or other birds. This is the third Christmas preparation with each being a glorious success. It's the best goose everyone I know has ever had. We'll be doing it again in Y2K !!!

I made this for a family Christmas gathering and received rave reviews... so many, in fact, that I've been required to make it again this year! I even got the gravy "right" which, as a gravy- challenged person, is a testament to how good is the recipe. Delicious.

The goose was moist and tasty and the gravy was very delicious. Definitely one for the recipe box.
