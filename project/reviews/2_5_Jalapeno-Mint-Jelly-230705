This is a great recipe! I had no trouble getting it to set; took overnight. I did add 3 drops of green food coloring as advised in a previous review. I'd give it 4 forks except that I'd like to have the particles of pepper and mint suspended throughout the jelly; it mostly floated to the top. I was afraid to move the jars much during setting to try to help this happen in my 2nd (double) batch. (Had alot of overgrown mint to use up!)

This was a fantastic recipe! I made my first batch of jelly ever, and this worked beautifully. My jelly set well, and had a very nice texture. The only reason I gave this a 3-fork rating was that the end flavor was a little too sour for my taste. I will make an adjustment to the recipe to try to alleviate the sourness. To process, I inverted the freshly canned jelly on their lids for about 15 minutes, then flipped them upright and let them sit on the counter overnight. This formed a nice vacuum seal too. I am not sure why others weren't able to get their jelly to set. I had 2 cups of liquid total, including the mint liquid, lemon juice and cider vinegar. I also put the jalapenos in a food processor to get a good mince on my peppers - which may have reduced the amount of liquid that was released by the peppers during cooking.

I made it as directed but added a packet of powder pectin instead of the liquid pectin at the same time as vinegar, lemon juice, & chopped jalapeños. I heated to boiling and then added the sugar. I did boil longer than the recommended time, about 5-7 minutes. As for the recipe, I used 3 jalapeno peppers, but my family said it wasn't hot enough, so I'll probably add 5 or 6 next time. Great use for all that mint growing wild!

I used Chocolate Mint and replace 1/2 cup of water with apple juice. No problems with jelling and tasted amazing!

Didn't set up for me either. Followed recipe exactly and it failed so I did everything that all mentioned below then added more pectin - still fail. Then I boiled it for another 5 minutes and it finally set up - a bit too much. Too bad as it sounds so good.

Add 2 drops of green food coloring to make the color more attractive.

I've been making jams for years and always used the powdered pectin. Twice I bought the liquid and my jams did not set. My suggestion is to use one packet of powdered pectin. I'll be making this jelly soon and will let you know how it comes out with the powder.

I just made this recipe and it seemed not to set up - will it set more as it cools? I did pour it back into the pan, boiled for a minute as the other reviewers suggested then processed it for 10 mins, too. Honestly, we won't care too much if it doesn't set as it is delicious!! We'll just call it Jalapeno and Mint Sauce!!

I'd love to try this but can't get liquid pectin in Germany - has anyone an idea with how much "crystal pectin" I can substitute it???

This jelly is our favorite! It goes great on pork! Our family can't get enough of it, we keep finding new ways to use it, and now all my neighbors are asking for it!

Note to self: read reviews and comments before attempting recipe. It did not jell for me either. I poured them all back in a pan, added another pouch of pectin, boiled for several minutes, tried again. No jell. I call it a "syrup" and will use it as a glaze.

I emptied the un-set-up jelly back into the pot and boiled it for one minute. Poured it back in the jars and processed ten minutes. It set up this time. Not sure why the recipe omitted this step of boiling the mixture after you add the liquid pectin: the directions that come with the liquid pectin tell you to do this will all jams and jellies that use liquid pectin.

This didn't set up for me either. i think I know why: after adding the pectin, you should boil it hard for one minute, which the recipe doesn't tell you to do. I might try again.

I doubled the amount of peppers used several different types of pepers and boiled hard for abut 7 minutes. Turned out great!

I made this recipe twice and neither time did it set like it should have. I have been making jams and jellies for years, and something isn't right with this. The taste is great and once I put it in the refrigerator, it set up a little more. Fortunately I have LOTS of mint and maybe will try to fix the recipe.

An important note - when cooking jellies,jams with hot peppers be very careful not to come in contact with even the steam - it can be very painful!

Ther is a problem with this recipe that plagues jellies - that is that the amount of liquid affects the amount of pectin needed. My batch must have had particularly juicy mint, because the pectin was not sufficient to give me jelly. I ended up with a liquid goo perfect for halloween. I liked the heavy mint flavor mixed with the vinegar and jalapeno, but the amount of sugar was really overpowering. This recipe has potential, but it's not one for someone just starting to can or preserve.
