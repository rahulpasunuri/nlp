Love this dish. I can't wait to make it for Chinese New Year party.

I followed the recipe to a tee. I thought the patties turned out a little dry, but my boyfriend liked them. I served them on top of gingered noodle salad (I added green pepper, sugarsnap peas, and green onion to the salad). The dressing on the salad is super tasty so I just made extra for serving. I also added rooster sauce for a nice kick. A little labor intensive...but tons of leftovers, and I think I can reheat the patties and use them on top of romaine once the noodles are gone.

I love this recipe. I used preground chicken to save time--the patties tastes great and my small children and my husband love it. I either use the jalapeno without the seeds or omit and add some red pepper flakes. Sometimes I add fresh ginger for a little more flavor. The water chestnuts add a nice crunch.

Wow. With a few changes, this recipe is one of my favorites. Instead of scallions, I used sugar snap peas. Added a great crunch and structure to the patties. (Besides, the gingered noodle salad also calls for scallions, which I did use there.) No need for the skewers. As I formed the patties, I placed them on waxed paper and coated them in panko. I ran my scissors between the patties to make wax paper squares. That made it super easy to handle the patties to the pan. I found the non-stick skillet didn't brown these properly. Instead, I sprayed an iron skillet with cooking oil and then added a tiny bit of hot water to the pan as it got too dry. No sticking and they weren't too oily.

I made this tonight for guests. I pretty much followed the recipe and would add more jalapeno next time. Served with the noodles, a very nice combo. I think the patties will also make a good wrap or work well on a salad for lunch tomorrow.

I love this recipe, it is easy, tasty and healthy. I don't use the skewers.

What a great warm weather recipe! I added panko to the chicken mixture and sauteed rather that skewered. Also added some crushed garlic. Let the patties come to room temp and served with the phenomenal noodle salad on this site.

We LOVED this recipe. It was quick, easy but, most importantly, delicious. We did not have cilantro on hand, so did not use. We eliminated the skewers as we did not feel the need. Followed the directions otherwise cooking patties individually in a large skillet. Served them with the Noodle Salad w/ Mango and Gingered Cucumber and some sugar snap peas. Yum.

Fantastic. I add soy, oyster sauce, garlic cloves, but 86 the cilantro as I react badly to it. You can't believe how good the leftovers are as a pita sandwich. Mmmmmm.

I have made these twice and my husband keeps asking me to make them again. I didn't use the skewers and coated the patties in panko before pan frying. I browned them and them put them in a 350 oven for 15 - 20 minutes while I put the rest of dinner together. Yum!

Really good, although I made a few of the suggested mods: marinated cut up chicken in lime juice and fish sauce, with 1 t cornstarch, then used the whole jalapeno, a grated carrot, and some fish and soy sauce. These were delicious and I'd definitely make them again, though I'd use boneless thigh meat for more flavor and better texture. Also, I served them on a Vietnamese rice noodle salad.

This was delicious! I used one whole jalapeno and some soy sauce. One of my favorite dishes.

Fabulous, easy recipe! I plan on making this often. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added 1 large pressed garlic clove, 1 t. grated ginger, 2 t. jalapeno (instead of 1) and 2 T. soy sauce. Skip the skewers; just fry in a pan with Pam.

This was so easy and so delicious. I followed the recipe exactly as written, with the exception of putting the patties on skewers. I just tossed them into skillet. A keeper!

Made the patties-on scewers- for a cockail party. All raved -gone in a snap!(Felt very proud)Will try the noodles - perhaps w/ a little tweeking.

I used drumstick meat to save $ I didn't have a food prosseser and used a blender much to its dismay I think I pulverised the water chesnuts to much as I was looking for that crunch and didn't find any, but it was good. Next time I will hand chop the vegies and use ground chicken.

Rating: 3
I love this recipe. Since I don't have a food processor to chop the chicken I used ground turkey but for everything else I followed the recipe and it was delicious! Served over a pile of stir fired vegetables it makes a delicious and healthy week day meal. I'm thinking of doing them smaller as appetizers for an up coming party.

Rating: 4
This is a great and quick recipe. We made it just for us but I would make it for company anytime. Since my husband is Mexican and likes his food kicked up a notch, I used the whole jalapeno with the seeds. I was also generous with the cilantro and green onions. I didn't add ginger but definatley would next time. The accompanying noodle salad was good but I would double the dressing next time.

Rating: 2
I followed other reviewers' advice and added ginger (too much) and garlic, and as a result the patties were kind of overseasoned, and reminded me of wonton stuffing. I would make again, but would tone down the ginger (which to be fair, wasn't even called for in the orig. recipe.) It was fun pulversizing the chicken breasts in the food processor.

Rating: 4
Delicious. The only problem was with the skewers. The patties fell off the skewers and broke while we were trying to cook them...so we ended up just taking them off the skewers and cooked them individually.

Rating: 3
I don't think this dish is complicated, but it took me forever only because I have about 4" of counter space! I took the suggestions and added lime, garlic, and chile sauce to the chicken mixture. I would've added ginger if I hadn't run out. Could've used more chili sauce--I like things spicy! The noodles were good and could also be good on their own with some stir fried tofu for a light summer dish. I think bread crumbs are a good idea-I just didn't have any. I made half of the batch with a little egg white mixed in, thinking it would help them stick together, but I didn't notice any difference in consistency or taste. Maybe next time I will brush them with oil and then bake.

Rating: 4
I followed the recipe fairly precisely except that I added a splash of fish sauce to the chicken for a flavor boost and it was superlative. The only thing I noticed was that the chicken patties didn't stick together so well until they were cooked, so I speared them after the fact. The noodle salad that went with the patties was exceptionally good either with or without the patties, but it must be consumed promptly. Don't make more than you are willing to eat that day as the fish sauce gets strong with age. This is a great party food though!

Rating: 4
Excellent idea--just needs a tiny bit of bolstering. LIke others, I added fresh minced ginger, extra chili paste and a touch of soy sauce as the patties could be a bit bland. I dredged them in panko and sauteed the patties in a skillet with a tablespoon of sesame oil, then popped them into the oven briefly to finish cooking.

Rating: 3
Very good, especially on the recommended noodle salad. I would use a little more spice, maybe some chili paste, when making it again, however.

Rating: 3
This was very, very good. I added ginger and garlic and dredged in panko as per previous suggestions. Also I marinated the chicken in nam pla and lime juice for an hour. I can see how the patties can be a little bland, but it takes almost no effort to doctor it up. Excellent.

I live in Costa Rica where water chestnuts are not available. I have made this several times substituting chopped green apple and adding soy sauce, ginger and a little dried chili pepper. I also serve it with a type of guacamole made with mango, cilantro, onion and a little wasabi. It has become a family favorite.

Rating: 4
This was sooo delicious. Based on other reviewer's suggestions I added fresh ginger and garlic to the mixture; I also marinated the chicken in soy and fresh squeezed lime juice while I prepped. Skipped the noodles from this recipe, but found a super yummy spicy peanut sauce recipe from Epicurious, tossed with some noodles and threw the patties on top. All incredibly tasty!

Rating: 3
I really liked this recipe - eating leftovers the next day just as good. A great during-the-week quick meal to make - I used 2 cans of water chestnuts instead of one, added a few TBS of soy sauce, a pinch more salt and an extra 1/2 teaspoon of diced jalepeno. I didn't use the skewers and they came out like little mini hamburgers. And it's healthy for you!

Rating: 4
This recipe is wonderful!! I did make a few adjustments. I added chopped fresh ginger which was a wonderful addition. And, like others, I did not use skewers. Sounded like too much trouble. I used a big spoon to scoop a nice size out and dropped the scoops into a plate of panko crumbs. Then flipped over to cover and fried. Was so easy and I never even had to touch to raw chicken! So easy and wonderful results. I just served over pasta tossed with sesame oil, a little peanut butter and soy sauce. Perfect. Will do again!

I made this dish on a camping trip (believe it or not) omitted the Jalopeno seeds, used chopped grilled chicken thighs and made the meat mixture into a loose pile for people to serve over the noodles, spaghetti style. It was a HUGE hit. I made enough to serve 32 people, but there were only 16, nothing was left. The men said, "I usually don't like food like this, but this dish is excellent!" Some people ate 4 servings. I went to serve my plate and nothing was left. Next time, I'll serve my plate first!

I was excited to make this recipe, but was disappointed with the result. The patties were bland, and the noodle salad was cold and slimy. If you enjoy doctoring up recipes, this might be one for you.

Made this for the second time - it was even better than the first - I added twice as much Jalapeno. I didn't make the noodle salad the first time with it, but decided to this time & wish I hadn't.

What a fabulously different way to prepare chicken. Very easy and tasty. I also 86'd the skewers and breaded the patties with panko crumbs. My dh keeps telling me he won't eat anything that doesn't grill or resemble a hunk of meat (like a steak, chop, or breast), but each time I sneak a new preparation like this one into dinnertime, he nearly always ends up devouring the dish. Noddle salad is the perfect complementary side dish.

This is a great dish. After reading the other reviews, I made the following adjustments: I added one-half Teaspoon of fresh minced/crushed garlic (1 large clove - pressed); and one Teaspoon (plus or minus) of grated ginger. I doubled the minced jalapeno to two Teaspoons; reduced the scallions to 2/3 cup. I also reduced the water chestnuts to about 3/4 of a can as opposed to an entire can. I also added about two (plus) Tablespoons of Soy Sauce. You would think from the recipe that the patties would not hold together - but they do. I did not use the skewers. The end dish was SUPERB! Will make again. Would not make again without above adjustments.

The recipe was very tasty on a bed of white rice. My husband who can be a very harsh food critic loved it. It was relatively simple to prepare and I cooked the patties in a pan without oil and they turned out great.

These were surprisingly easy to cook - unlike other mixtures they did not fall apart in the skillet at all, although I didn't bother to put them on skewers. The noodle salad does have a mild flavor, but it is very authentic tasting and goes perfectly with the chicken patties

Instead of using skewers, I just fried the patties and placed over the noodles. Froze the leftover patties and they were just as when defrosted. Great to keep in freezer for a quick meal.

Since we love garlic, I added two cloves to the chicken and it was great! I tried the panko crumbs, as suggested below, on some of the patties and preferred the crunchy texture. I used the vinaigrette recipe for the noodle salad on a cucumber, carrot, onion salad. Very complimentary flavors!

My family stared at it and as we ate started giggling softly. After about 5 minutes of struggling though this mess, I finally reached the conclusion that despite my penchant for odd food items-this was definably alien. While the flavor of the noodle salad was good, the texture was just too weird. The chicken patties screamed: boring (even with a healthy side of wasabi) and frankly even any fast food burger would have been preferable. My 11-year old valiantly tried, and she is chief among the noodle lovers in the world. Sorry, I really thought this was a poor excuse for food; my final remark was "Let's throw it out." There was a race for the garbage disposal.

Made these with the gingered noodle salad for an evening concert in the park and both were very, very good and tasted great at room tempature. I omitted the chile in both dishes and didn't miss it and served soy sauce on the side for dipping.

Wow-what a fresh new idea. I did add a splash of soy sauce and 1/2 teaspoon jarred ginger to the meat mixture. I also skipped the skewers. Will definitely make again.

I found the noodle salad to be quite bland while preparing, so I increased the fresh ginger, jalapeno and garlic by about one-third. After letting it sit for a few hours in the refrigerator, the flavors intensified. I, too, made ten chicken patties, sans skewers, and covered them with Panko (Japanese breadcrumbs, available at most supermarkets) before browning them for three minutes per side in a saute pan. I then placed them on a baking sheet in a 250° oven to hold them for ten minutes. The meal was delicious - we all had seconds!

Rating: 3
This is a repeat recipe for sure!! I really enjoyed both the patties and the noodles. I, too, skipped the skewers and just made 16 small patties out of the mixture and fried them. The noodles are key to the recipe. I wouldn't bother chopping the scallions, cukes, cilantro, and carrots by hand. Just put 'em in the processor--will save you tons of time. I would probably make a bit more of the dressing next time because the noodles were a bit dry.

I made the chicken mixture into small meatballs and browned them -- they were good but perhaps a little bland. The noodle salad was a hit, but too many noodles! However, our daughter's 17-year-old boyfriend ate all leftovers without complaining.

We enjoyed this recipe. I used pickeld jalapeno instead of fresh (we just can't handle the direct heat), I added 2t of soysauce to add some flavor (some reviewers had said it verged on being bland) and used sesame oil instead of vege oil. We made 6 large patties and dropped the skewers. I used spray oil only in my nonstick skillet and it worked fine. Its quick (with a food processor) and something different.

I thought this recipe was delicious. I used ground chicken and less of the green onions and served it with rice. I'll definitely make it again.

This was soooo yummy I had to review it. We did cut down the amount of green onion we used as it just seemed to me it would over power everything else. Served it with the noodle salad as directed, but added snow peas for an extra crunch. My husband loved it, it is a new staple recipe in our house and I have emailed it to everyone I know, even vegetarians who advised to try the patties with fish instead of chicken.

This dish was wonderful! We made it according to the recipe (used ground turkey instead of chicken) and it was great! The gingered noodle salad is great too. My husband rated this as one of his favorites.

This need some tinkering - I didn't think the patties turned out as well at the ginger noodle salad. It may be my skill level but I didn't have a feel for how cooked the patties got - Nevertheless, it was good having the water chestnut crunch in with the meat and the other flavors were tasty too. A litle egg to bind the patties together probably wouldn't hurt.

Rating: 4
I loved this dish. I chopped everything by hand, except the chicken, and took care not to over-process the chicken, so as not to get a mushy mess. We had fresh scallions from the garden, and that probably added to the wonderful flavor. Next time I will chop everything in the food processor to save time. I didn't make the noodle salad because I didn't have the ingredients but will next time. I, like everyone else, it seems, did not use the skewers. I made larger patties and cooked them in more oil than the recipe called for. I served the patties with rice and a bottled mango/ginger/garlic sauce that I had in the fridge, jazzed up with rice vinegar, honey and soy sauce. Delicious! I can envision the patties cooked on the grill and eaten as sandwiches or served with homemade fruit salsa.

Rating: 2
I thought these were just okay. My husband did not like them at all. He ate a small portion, then made a P&J sandwich. I think that his seeing the chicken all mushed up in the food processor turned him off. He's like, "Why did you do that to a perfectly good chicken breast." :) On my part, I did not care for the green onion flavor. I like green onions, but it just seemed too strong. I made the recipe exactly as written, including the gingered noodles (which were good). Someone suggested serving with lime slices and some sort of sauce. That probably would have improved them for me. They were simply too bland. Lots of other folks seemed to like them, however, so maybe it's us. Bon Appetite!

This was great! The patties are juicy and quite filling. Next time I will increase the cilantro, and maybe try them in a larger size as a change from burgers on the grill! A big hit at our house. (I bagged the skewers...what was the point of them anyway?)

This is great. You could use ground turkey in place of the chicken breats. I added soy sauce instead of salt for a deeper flavor. Next time I'll try oyster sauce. The ginger noodle salad is a must. I didn't have a mango so I substituted peach slices and it was yummy! Next time I'll add slivered snow peas to the salad. A great quick meal.
