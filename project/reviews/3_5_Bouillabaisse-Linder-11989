Loved this recipe. Made it using stock from Earth Fare and it was wonderful. I also substituted shrimp instead of lobster and everyone was HAPP!

I have three comments about preparing buillabaisse that I think aren't specific to any one recipe... (1) It's time consuming to prepare and the ingredients can be quite expensive if your serving a crowd. In terms of special equipment, you'll need a large/tall stockpot, and for service you should ideally have large wide-rimmed soup/pasta bowls that can hold enough broth and fish for a main course. (2) It is ESSENTIAL to create a very strong, rich fish stock/fumet. Instead of being just a clear broth flavored with fennel, tomatoe, and saffron, the broth should have a hint of texture and density to it... certainly still brothy, but with tiny paritciulates and an intense fish flavor. (3) This "Bouillabaise Linder" recipe on Epicurious does not call for a "rouille" to be served with the toasts, but in my humble opinion, it's absolutely necessary. "Rouille" is a garlicky mayo condiment with a bit of a kick, and a dollop of "rouille" is put on the toasts/croutons and placed in the bowl with the broth and fish when serving. It adds another layer of richness to the dish. ----- All that being said, I like a couple of the other reviewers of this recipe, prepared the alternate "Food 911" version of bouillabaisse from the FoodTV website. It was good, but not as spectacular as I was hoping for... As a child I had bouillabaise a number of times at a restaurant in town of St. Tropez on the French Riviera, and I was hoping to recreate the experience. My first attempt had flavorful results, but it was still mediocre compared to good versions I've had in the past. I suspect that making a great bouillabaisse is an art that will take many more attempts to perfect.

I found this a bit time consuming, but well worth it! I substituted prawns for the lobster which made it more fun to eat and added a different look to the presentation. I also added Harrissa

I hope I'm not being impolite, but I took Hal Kendalls' advice and pulled up the bouillabaisse recipe from The Food TV Network (under recipe search) and ended up using the food 911 version. The 4 forks are for that recipe. It was by far the most indepth and time consuming recipe I had ever made and it wasn't cheap. I wanted to surprise my husband with a special meal and since it gets quite chilly in the mountains this time of year, I went for it! It was by far worth all the time, expense and effort...WONDERFUL!... Since there was just one bouillabaisse recipe in here to choose and because of both the time and expense involved in this recipe, it was nice having several recipes to choose from...that is why I thought you all would like the option of choosing from several different recipes and decide for yourselves. I don't know about you, but lobster is not a staple on our grocery list! If I have offended Epicurious in any way by this I apologize. This site still remains my first choice in a recipe search!

Am somewhat amused about reader comments that argue on authenticity of "must use" Mediterranian fish. I have eaten BOUILLABAISSE from Montreal, Canada to Horbart, Australia. In Europe I enjoined Ensalata di Mistra de Mare, the mixed salad of the sea. Nowhere is either dish the same. All reflect what is "best" of the region. Enjoy.

I thought it was wonderful, I made it for 15 people on Christmas Eve and everyone raved about it. The broth is to die for. It takes a while to make, but it is well worth the effort!!!

Well, I made this, but I made some changes. I used shrimp shell broth instead of the complicated fish stock. Instead of the fish suggested, I used mussels, scallops, shrimp and a thick whitefish--whatever looked freshest. As far as being authentic, those are pretty authentic in the part of the mediterranean I'm from. It was very spicy, but heavenly on a bad cold.

Added more spices, and crabs.

To the french cook; we have bested you in wine, so it's only natural that we would best you in fish quality as well. Perhaps the poor fish intake has muted your personality. This dish is good but the one listed by Tyler Florence at foodtv is much better.

this was very good,but I added monk fish instead of the more popular fish called for I also added some u-15 shrimp, and cut the lobsters in half.

I tried it and it was good. I agree with Margaret. Also, it is important to remember the origins of bouillabasisse; it was a working fisherman's stew. This was not haute cuisine! Any handy ingredients were used. Furthermore, the Med is mostly fished out and polluted. So getting the 'real' Med fish are dicey and not all that healthy. Here in Alaska, we have great fish and pristine waters still. So what ingredients would you rather start with anyway? The other comments are just silly.

Too bad neither of the above reviews actually *tried* the recipe, but just had to comment on the supposed authenticity of it. Should we never make Bouillabaisse simply because we can't find mediterrean fish? I think not. So call it fish stew inspired by bouillabaisse. I liked the above recipe, but wanted it to have more "oomph" so the addition of cumin, coriander and fennel seeds and some harissa and orange peel, and a splash of pastis makes for a better stock. And yes, I added dungeness crab and mussels!! And it was GOOD!

Bouillabaisse. Fine if innovation is aimed at replacing fish otherwise foundd in the Med sea. But Lobster?

Mussels and Clams in the bouillabaisse?... Why not Chicken and lingonberries...? This is a fair fish soup but millions of miles away from the original. reason being that the fish you find in the bouillabaisse can only be found in the Mediteranean see... So if you don't live there you can only try to make it but never succeed... Oh, one more thing... Never ever any lobsters!!!
