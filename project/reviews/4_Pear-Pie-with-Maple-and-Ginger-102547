I kept all these wonderful ingredients and flavors, which go so nicely with pears, but I changed this to a custard open-face tart, adding two beaten eggs and two tablespoons of melted butter to the original ingredients. Poured the mix over the sliced, arranged pears. The custard puffed up around the pears, and was smooth, beautiful and delicious! Baked at 450 for 20 mins, then 350 for 30. I will also use the original pie recipe for Thanksgiving!

This recipe is a keeper. The pie is very delicious. The ginger and maple really make it special.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it went over really well.I took the advise of an earlier reviewer and aded dried cherries,yum! It did fall apart when I cut it; it could have been my fault but it was good and no one cared! I will probably make it again, or at least some variation of it.

This pie is exceptional!!! We doubled the crystallized ginger (and used really good Ginger People brand) and used pre-made refrigerated pie crusts for simplicity. As an extra we drizzled cut slices with a fine caramel sauce (Kings Cupboard brand): looked gorgeous and tasted even better. Outstanding!

I'd rate it 3.5 forks, myself. I was out of maple syrup, so I substituted maple sugar (ratio of 1 c. syrup= 1/2 c. sugar), and added about 3 tbsp. of brandy to make up for the liquid difference, and added a little extra tapioca. Otherwise, I made the filling as written and used my tried-and-true pie crust recipe. It was a big hit for the office crowd. I loved the texture of the pie, and the flavour was excellent. You couldn't pick out the maple or ginger on their own, but everything worked to support the fruit and overall great taste. People tended to take more than one slice to try and pin down exactly what the flavourings were. I would definitely make it again.

This was very good. I doubled the ginger and added some dried cherries. Will make again.

This was stunning!! Six of us for our weekly pot luck and film group devoured it - not a tiny taste left. I did double the ginger - and it didn't overwhelm the rest of the subtle flavors. I used candied lemon peel (only because I squoze and froze the juice to a lot of lemons)and used the lemon sugar on the crust. The crust was excellent. I think that one of the secrets to this is to get pears (Bartlett) that are just beginning to soften - so they are tasty without being mushy - and then not over cooking the pie - one hour was perfect.

My pears weren't ripe enough and they never softened up, even after baking an extra half hour. My fault. But I didn't care for the ginger, lemon combination and you couldn't taste the maple syrup at all.

What a wonderful pie. The subtle intermingling of lemon, ginger and maple make a surprising and satisfying complement to the pears. I used Bartlett first time. The second time Seckel pears which are even tastier. Next time I'm going to try an even creamier pear like the Bosc or Comice. Husband and children agreed that this is the pie to be added to the traditional pumpkin and pecan pies for Thanksgiving.

This is a delicious pie. I love the combination of ginger and pear. i found this to be just the right combination of ginger to pear. Sometimes it can be overpowering. I confess that I did not make the crust but followed the recipe for the buttermilk pie crust that is on this site with the other ginger and pear pie. It was great.

Easy enough to make and tasts fantastic...the crust dough seemed sticky to me while making it...be sure to chill..and roll it out between plastic wrap...but the pie baked up FABULOUS. Everyone raved. And I liked that the crust is one that is easily cut into neat wedges...so the pie on the plate looks like pie on a plate...
