This is colourful and so appealing when plated. The pink of the trout and the colours of the greens and salsa...eye candy. I had to do a couple subs. I didn't have pineapple so I used three kiwi fruit in place of that; and, instead of the mixed greens I just used baby spinach. My children are scarfing it down with no complaints. Yeehaw.

loved it! The spicy fish went well together with the sweet mango salsa. I would though add more spice to the fish as I like it a bit more hot. very tasty. - note, next time I will not coat the fish in olive oil at all.

I caught several rainbows/brookies on an ice fishing trip. When I got back into town I had a few friends over for a little dinner party (four people total). The only thing that I changed was that I kept the fish whole (gutted) while coating the inside and out with Konriko creole seasoning and then stuffing with a few lime slices, and then baking in aluminum foil at 375 for 20 or so minutes. I made 6 fish in the first batch...I never thought that 4 people could devour 6 fish and still want more... I loved the mango salsa but have since come across a recipe that I feel is superior to this one. It includes papaya and honey...good stuff...

Absolutely delicious! Simple, easy, and lovely. The fresh ingredients were an amazing burst of summer in the middle of February.

This recipe is wonderful! I served for my parents that were visiting and they loved it. I usually don't put in as much pinapple as they call for because the taste is very strong. Other than that, I follow the recipe to the exactly and we just love it. It's easy, too.

The creole spice w/ trout was excellent and will surely do again. However, the vinaigrette on fruit salsa and mixed greens was less than average and will not be made again.

Because there was no trout available, I substituted orange roughy, and it was delicious! A big hit with the family, including my picky 8 year-old daughter. I used canned pineapple, and the salsa tasted great.

Yummy! This was such a different taste to what we usually eat. My husband usually doesn't like sweet dishes, but the mix of onion and pepper with the fruit makes it spicy and fruity at the same time. Easy to make...good to eat.

I did not make the trout - substituted shrimp. But the fruit salsa was very tasty and the dressing - out of sight! I will definately make the salsa/dressing concoction again.

This was delicious and easy. I ended up with a little too much dressing - should have drained the salsa a bit after it marinated, but not a big deal. Also I substituted red snapper for trout - I think this would be good with any light fish like that.

My husband was in the mood for fish tacos so we used this recipe. Followed recipe except used tilapia. Very pleased with results. Will probably use a little less spice on fish next time around. There will definitely be a next time.

If all chopping (for salsa) is done before hand this receipe is easy to prepare for company. Fresh trout is a must. Very eye appealing with this colorful salsa, which makes the trout a taste sensation!!! I might use a tad less ginger next time.

Creole seasoning is ready made and is usually available in the spice section. I use a brand by Louisiana Fish Fry Seasonings. In fact, I use it in lots of things that need a little spicing up.

What is Creole seasoning? Can it be made at home?
