These cookies are perfect. They are most certainly not powdery at all but moist and delicious. Use cheap peanut butter and don't overcook them.

i like a chewy cookie. i make these exactly as written, and the cookies were uber-powdery. i was hoping to take these in to work as a treat for my coworkers, but they turned out embarrassingly unpleasant. not the recipe for me, at all.

Since other reviewers mentioned the cookies not being peanut-buttery enough, I used 3/4 cup peanut butter chips and 1/4 cup chocolate. They came out wonderfully. (I also didn't have unsalted butter so I used salted, maybe that helped bring out the peanut flavor?)

So rich and chocolatey! Definitely serve with a tall glass of milk. Could use less cocoa and more peanut butter. I under-cooked them a little because I don't like too crunchy/crumbly cookies.

Moist and fudgy, a keeper! Definitely bake on parchment paper, be sure to flatten cookies before baking.

This made a nice cookie, but if you are looking for a peanut taste...this is not the one. I doubled the peanut butter and substituted chopped peanuts for the peanut butter chips. Still just not peanutty. Not a bad cookie, but not what I expected at all.

Rating: 4
these cookies are excellent...but i like my cookies soft so i took them out of the oven just as they started to crack on top and still slightly gooey in the center so they would not become crumbly. i also skipped the pb chips and replaced them with lots of peanuts they turned out oh so good. these cookies are going on my top 10 list.

Batter looked too wet - it wasn't. I added oats to the 2nd half of batter when making the cookies and I think I like the added oats better. Both are wonderful. Def. make these again. Don't really taste the peanut butter.

I love these cookies!!! They are my current favorite. However, I made a lot of changes. I replaced the cocoa with oatmeal. I doubled the peanut butter and used a chunky, unsweetened variety. I replaced 1/4 c sugar with honey. I used brown sugar not white. I added 2 t salt ( love salt!). I replaced PB chips with chopped peanuts and I doubled the amount. I doubled the quantity of choc chips and used 70% dark small chocolate chunks instead of semi-sweet. The 70% dark you can get at Whole Foods under their 365 brand name.

No fork rating because I changed one thing: I used 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar. The cookies came out very soft and crumbly, and while they were sweet enough I wonder if the texture didn't suffer for my substitution. People still liked them (what's not to like about lots of chips?) but if I make these again I'll follow the recipe and hope they turn out better.

Rating: 0
It's a soft cookie recipe which my family really loves. For health reasons, I reduced the amount of sugar and choco ships to 4/5 of recommmended amount and also replaced pb chips with pilled and coarsely ground almonds. It turned out to be better. I also baked 20 minutes instead of 10 because I noticed the cookies in the lower rack weren't quite baked after 15 minutes in the oven. All in all, it's a wonderful recipe.

Liked these cookies very much and got raves from the family. One important note I haven't seen in any reviews: I found that I had to flatten the dough balls with a fork per a traditional pb cookie recipe, as they didn't spread at all. I did modify the recipe per some suggestions: I used only 1/2 the amount of cocoa (not a huge chocolate fan), added another 1/2 cup of peanut butter, omitted the pb chips, and baked them for 15 minutes. They had a nice subtle peanut taste and hints of chocolate, just the way I wanted it.

Rating: 4
These cookies were SO good. Other reviewers are right that they are definitely cakey, but WOW! The flavor is fantastic and I don't mind the cakiness one bit. I'm baking them right now for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day, but I've already eaten three just waiting for the second batch to come out of the oven...

I was really disappointed with this recipe, after the excellent reviews I'd read. The dough was trying to be both peanut and chocolate, but didn't succeed at either, since the flavours drowned each other out and were too weak (I used good quality cocoa and regular Kraft PB). The taste came from the chips, and that could be done in any cookie- preferably one with a better texture, since this one was crumbly to the point of being dry I found, and would have worked better with a little more substance.

Rating: 4
These cookies were yummy! One minor thing that I did differently was cream the butter and sugar together before adding the peanut butter. I like to make sure that it gets really fluffy first and that the sugar is well incorporated. You HAVE to beat it a lot so that the cookies don't come out grainy! I only used 1/2 c choc chips instead of one whole cup, and I used the original 1 cup peanut butter chips. Otherwise, the chocolate overpowers the peanut butter. These cookies turn out fluffy and cakey, not dense at all! I've made these cookies multiple times and they always turn out great. Also, I'm not a fan of overly sweet stuff, and the sugar in these cookies is perfect. (:

After reading the reviews, I decided to add two cups of pb M&Ms instead of the choco and pb chips. I also baked my batch using minature cup cake pans. After the spot on cooking time of ten minutes, I let the cupcakes cool for 30 min. During the 30 min. wait, I melted about two cups of milk chocolate chips with some heavy cream. I then cut the caps off the cakes and using wax paper on seperate sheet pan, covered th cakes with the melted goodness. The result was heaven! It was a perfect match for the holiday season!

I made the recipe as stated excepted omitted the peanut butter chips. I found them to be dry and a bit cakey. I was hoping for a chewier, moister cookie.

Rating: 3
For this recipe, I used extra-creamy peanut butter and the texture of the cookie was amazing! I had no problems with crumbling after letting the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes or so before transferring them to cooling racks. My one complaint is that the chocolate taste overpowers the peanut butter taste somewhat, so next time I will add more peanut butter and maybe reduce the amount of chocolate chips. However, as a chocolate cookie, these rock!

Light, fluffy and delicious! I added a bit more peanut butter and used chocolate chips only. You MUST try this recipe... it's so good and easy!

Delicious and great texture!! I added 1/2 cup of old fashioned oats and did not use pb chips, just semi-sweet cc instead. Only thing that bothered me about this recipe is it says it yeilds 60 cookies. I could get 40 out of it at best.

Rating: 4
The first time I made these I used organic, natural peanut butter and doubled the amount. The consistency was really cakey and heavy, didn't really like that when the cookie was so rich already. I wasn't planning on making these again but a friend loved them so much that I made a batch for her birthday. This time I used regular peanut butter and kept it to the amount the recipe called for. These were so good, and incredibly light and fluffy that I'm regretting having halved the recipe this time around. I'm wondering if doubling the amount of regular peanut butter would produce as dense a cookie as my previous attempt. Also, the ten minute baking time was spot on.

Oh my gosh, these are fantastic cookies. I made them for a cookie contest at work, and they earned Second Place only because I also submitted the First Place cookie! Yummy!! I didn't find them dry, possibly because I used organic peanut butter that was very creamy. Absolutely delicious! Thanks again, Gourmet!

Just made these. They're pretty good. Did make a few changes: doubled the pb, left out the pb chips, and doubled the chocoloate chips. Used some oil spray on the cookie sheets and had no problems. The cookies are crumbly, however I had no problems with them. Not a single cookie broke.

Yum! My daughter wanted peanut butter cookies, and I wanted, or course, chocolate cookies, so I tried this and Damn am I glad I did. Delicious! I ommited the p- butter chips and added in more p-butter-- perfection. I didn't use parchment, just regular old buttered pans, perfect!

I followed others recommendation to use parchment paper and the cookies turned out just perfect. No crumbling. I just let them cool on the sheet before removing. I found that the next day, the peanutbutter flavor was more pronounced, which I really liked. This did not turn out to be an exceptionally pretty cookie but the flavor makes up for it. Yum!

Using brown sugar will eliminate the crumbling problem that some reviewers had but be careful with these cookies -they are more addictive than potato chips or Haagen Daaz Swiss Chocolate Almond.

Just tried one of these from my test batch .... they are very good cookies, no doubt! I followed the recipe exactly and they came out very good. The inside is slightly cake-like and overall it is a rich, flavorful cookie. I tend to like cookies that are a little less rich so that's the only reason I didn't give it 4 forks. Used parchmont and let cookies cool on baking sheet for 15 minutes. No problems with crumbling ... though a few cookies crumbled or split just a bit -- I could see that the problem stemmed from some of the peanut butter chips sort of falling apart or splitting. So if you are using extra peanut butter chips, you may have a bit more of the crumbling. It wasn't nearly enough though to keep me from making this cookie again.

I just finished making these cookies. They came out great! I had no trouble with crumbling at all. I baked them on parchment paper for 10 minutes.

Incredible! Moist and chocolatey and delicious. The peanut butter sets off the dark chocolate flavor perfectly. Every chocolate cookie I've tasted before has always been a bit dry - but the peanut butter keeps these so moist and tender. The best! The only change I made was to add a teaspoon of vanilla, and a dollop of vanilla rum. And I didn't have any peanut chips, so I doubled the chocolate chips. Yum!

Ohhhhhhhhhh Myyyyyyyyyyyy!! These cookies are outstanding! I followed the recipe but basically doubled the amount of peanut butter chips AND chocolate chips.

Wow. I love these cookies. But mine didn't come out like the other reviewers did. Here's what I did different: I used Adams Unsalted All-natural crunchy peanut butter, but I ran out so I used maybe 1/3 cup. They didn't seem chocolate-y enough so I added 1 1/2 bars unsweetened baking chocolate, melted over a low flame. I added more sugar (about 1/3 c.) and some salt (1-1 1/2 tsp) since the peanut butter was unsalted with no added sugar. And instead of chocolate and peanut butter chips (which I'm sure would be delicious) I used butterscotch chips - they were on sale. Sooooper wonderfully delish. They only thing I wish I had done was add some peanuts like some other people did. It would have added to the peanut flavor and an extra crunch is nice. My cookies flattened out like regular chocolate chip cookies and didn't get all crumbly. Yum. yum. yum.

I MADE THESE COOKIES TONIGHT AND I THOUGHT THEY TURNED OUT REALLY YUMMY. I USED REESES PEANUT BUTTER CANDIES CHOPPED INTO PIECES AND DOUBLED THE PEANUT BUTTER. TO AVOID BREAKING THE COOKIES LET THEM COOL ATLEAST 5-7 MINUTES ON THE PAN THEN COOL ON THE RACK. THESE ARE 'MELT IN YOUR MOUTH' COOKIES.

I used to claim that cookies were an overrated form of dessert since I never had been "wowwed" by a cookie. Sure they tasted pretty good, but nothing to exciting. That is, until these. These are fantastic but it is imperative you cool them on the baking sheets for a good amount of time. If you move them too much too soon they will crumble after a day...but then of course, crumbles are easier to rationalize than an entire cookie....

Excellent recipe! They were very dense and cakelike. I would increase the amount of peanut butter chips next time, since the peanut flavor got a little overwhelmed by chocolate.

This cookie tastes great! I made two mistakes and this cookie didn't crumble. I accidentially melted about half of the butter and I spilled some of the dry ingredients on the floor. I suspect this made for a moister cookie that held up just fine. I also used parchment paper. Don't be discouraged. Try this cookie and it will become a favorate.

Yummy, yummy cookies- but very crumbly! Too fragile to travel well. I added 1 tsp. vanilla, used a 10 ounce bag of PB chips, and I baked them on parchment paper. I'd make them more frequently if I could figure out a way to make them sturdier. (But even the broken bits disappear quickly!)

Very yummy, and fairly easy to make. I substitued white chocolate chips for the peanut butter chips (only because I didn't have any in the house). The "level tablepoons" direction seems a bit off; I used two teaspoons to drop the cookies on the sheets, and still did not wind up with the 60 cookies the recipes supposedly makes. More like 30-40, but worth it. Did not wind up with a crumbly texture, perhaps because I used reduced fat peanut butter. The resulting texture was still good, though.

This recipe is great...and easy. I just made these cookies for the first time and I'm eating one right now, it's really moist and full of flavor, mind you this is definitely a eat with milk cookie. I didn't find that they crumpled easily at all. I didn't use cocoa powder, I used Quik mix instead. I'll be using this recipe again.

Not an outstanding recipe. Even though I doubled the pb, as others suggested, added vanilla for richness, used very high quality cocoa, and replaced the pb chips with real peanuts, not a winner. Couldn't taste the peanut butter at all. Definitely a chocolate cookie, but way too crumbly. I've made many, many cookie recipes and this is not a keeper!
