made these,very quick to make, but I used brown sugar instead of white with the cinnamon, next time I will use more for the filling, found this was not enough, and will use more milk, found kind of dry, but still tasty. I also used cream cheese icing on top, very tasty.

Super quick and easy. Tasty too.

True, this is not a Cinnabon cinnamon bun. But unlike the gooey, vaguely uncooked taste you get from a Cinnabon, this recipe is warm, flaky, and surprisingly hearty. Per other reviews suggestion, I always use 1/4 cup milk with the dough, sometimes more if the dough is a little dry, and double the filling. I am very happy with this recipe and like that it's not laden with sugar and butter, unlike the majority of cinnamon roll recipes out there.

simple and delicious. you can whip these up the night before for breakfast. its a great recipe, very easy and they turned out perfect for me. mine didnt need 18 minutes, i just kept an eye on them and it was closer to 12-13. next time, ill double the recipe since they didnt last long!

Very good. I doubled the cinnamon and sugar as suggested. I also doubled the frosting recipe. They are certainly more like biscuits or scones but taste great for the amount of work involved. I haven't mastered yeast dough yet so this recipe is great for me.

Yes, these are more like biscuits or even scones. They are not ooey-gooey, sticky, pull-apart, cinnamon rolls. That being said, they are good. And fast. I used twice the filling which and I'm glad I did. Next time I'd add cinnamon chips, too.

This is a great recipe but I like to take it up a notch by combining it with another great cinnamon bun recipe (http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/giada-de-laurentiis/hazelnut-cinnamon-rolls-recipe/index.html). If you make this quick and easy dough and add hazelnuts and Giada's topping it becomes superb!

This recipe is quick but just creates cakey dry cinnamon buns similar to a dry scone. No I won't make again.

So delicious and easy to make! Definitely add a bit more milk and cinnamon/sugar as other reviewers say. A great everyday cinnamon bun recipe!

THis recipe is delicious, and just what it is advertised as. It is a shortcut to the more elaborate and traditional cinnamon bun. It's worked for my family twice, and I plan on making it again.

I agree with other reviewers that it has a more biscuit like consistency. However it is very good, easy and my family loved them.

I've made these many times, and they always come out delicious and are extremely easy. Sometimes the dough needs a bit more flour, because it can get sticky. Also keep it cool- don't stick your warm hands in it more than necessary.

Okay, my kids ate them. But these are NOTHING like cinnamon rolls. They are BISCUITS! By no means are they just as delicious as cinnamon rolls. They were okay, but I wouldn't bother making them again. The Cinnamon Streusel Buns -Feb 2001 are the way to go! You make the dough the night before, so there is little effort in the morning.

I made this with half whole wheat dough, and liked the taste of the biscuits, but they were not sweet enough for cinnamon buns. Next time I will put more cinnamon in the dough and more filling.

To the cook from Dededo...I think we have a problem with yeast because of the never-ending high heat and humidity on the island, because I can never get yeast to work here, either!

great buns!!! quick and easy to make...the kids love them!

First of all, followed recommendations to add more mile, butter and cinnamon/sugar. They would have been way too dry otherwise - thanks. This recipe was certainly easy enough and the buns were good. Not great. Would not make to impress anyone but fine for a quick Sunday breakfast.

This is the easiest, best tasting recipe for cinnamon rolls that I've tried in a while! I only made a few revisions to the recipe. I used more sugar for the filling as one reviewer did. Also, instead of spreading milk on the dough, I used fat-free butter spray. For the icing, I used half milk and half melted butter, instead of water. I also used all skim milk and it tasted great! I will be using this easy recipe for weekend mornings!

Really good - and easy to make. Especially if you are yeast-challenged like me (I have never successfully made anything requiring yeast or rising or all that).

The easiest and most delicious cinnamon buns!. I was looking for a quick and delicious recipe for a brunh and this is it!. I even used skim milk and it made no difference at all. I baked them a bit longer then the recipe called for. This is a keeper!.

Easy and yummy. A nice, quick treat on a weekend morning. My husband requests them a lot.

This is a great recipe for something sweet, fast! I added extra sugar and cinnamon and drizzled syrup on top for a sticky bun finish- mmm very good!

it came out more like a oversized cookie than a cinnamon roll, but I liked it and so did my husband. The secret is going nuts on the cinnamon and sugar. I added twice as much and I think it made it better. More milk, as previous reviewers suggest also helps.

Rating: 2
easy, quick and pretty, but when the recipe is followed to the letter, the result is simply "a scone with cinnamon" as my daughter remarked. Jazzing it up as previous reviewers suggest would certainly improve the outcome.

good basic recipe. dough is a bit dry. person who said it took three hours... I think that might be the problem. Which end of the fork is up? I added raisins and cinnamon to the dough, then more raisins before the roll up phase. YUM.

We made this for Christmas morning and it was delicious, and easy. We added extra milk like some people suggested, and extra cinnamon sugar. We also doubled the recipe and made it in a food processor. They were very biscuity but good.

A great breakfast treat on a cold winter morning! I accidentally added the full 1/4 cup of milk to the dough and the biscuits were beautifully moist and tender. I was wondering if the recipe could be doubled, so I'm going to try the suggested recipe for making a dozen (thanks!)

This recipe was a disaster and very hard to make after spending three hours making, mixing, and kneeding the dough. It turned out as a hard biscuit and not tastey at all! I would never reccomend this recipe to anyone!

Nice enough. Cinnamon-y biscuits.

I have made this recipe twice once for the 2 servings and once doubling the recipe. I had great results both times. Each time I had to add some more milk to the dough before I could knead it, probably less than a tablespoon, enough to hold it together. I also added a little more cinnamon than called for. These are very good for what they are, a quick cinnamon bun. They were even good left over.

I have made this recipe several times and found that the roll dough was dry and often tasted like a plain biscuit. I worked on the recipe for awhile with plenty of trials because it had so much potential for a easy treat. If you are interested here is my altered recipe which makes a dozen. Use a food processor: 5 cups flour, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 tsp. cinnamon, 2 Tbsp. + 2 tsp. baking powder, 1/2 tsp. salt. Cut in 1 stick of butter. Mix 4 eggs, 1 tsp. vanilla, 2/3 cup milk (sometimes I add a little half/half). Pour in the liquid mixture - pulse mixture in processor until combined - may need to add 1/2-1Tbsp. more of milk until dough is soft. Roll out dough, spread with melted butter (about 1 tbsp), plenty of cinn/sugar, and roll up. This recipe has worked well for me many times and I always get compliments.

Quick and easy to make with great results. First pasty dough that wasn't a failure! Good idea to add the extra milk in dough and extra cinnamon mixture inside.

Like the cook before said, add more butter to the pastry and more cinnamon sugar. Go easy on the floured surface or you will dry out your pastry. I also added a tablespoon more milk to the pastry. My husband is not really fond of sweets and he said they were very nice. The recipe was quick and easy enough to satisfy a pregnant woman's cravings.

These really are QUICK. My teens like to make it for a snack, however, they have altered the recipe. They spread the dough with butter, use more cinnamon sugar, make extra frosting and occasionally throw in a few nuts!
