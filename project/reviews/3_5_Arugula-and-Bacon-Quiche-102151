Wow, this recipe was delicious! I've paid $8 for a single slice of quiche - not anymore! I made the recipe as is this time but I may sub in spinach and a different cheese next time for cost and ease of time finding at the grocery store.

extremely disappointing. it smelled so good but the taste was just ok. too many better quiche recipes out there to bother with this one. only made one change which was to sub 1/2 and 1/2 for the whipping cream. it certainly did not need to be any richer. it just didn't come together. the parts remained quite layered or separate (as other reviewers noted).

Delicious quiche recipe. I used mushrooms and spinach rather than bacon and arugula. This is my new favorite quiche recipe!

made this for dinner last night and i'm eating it for lunch right now, which prompted this review. i took a couple of previous suggestions and here's what i did: about 10 slices of bacon. poured off most of the grease before cooking the shallots. shredded almost 1/2 lb of gruyere. used heavy cream. store-bought frozen pie shell (deep dish and i did not pre-bake it). two whole eggs and two egg yolks (for a more custard-like texture). poured half the egg/cream/cheese mixture in shell. added wilted spinach/shallot/balsamic. topped w/ remaining cream mixture on top. dusted with nutmeg. amazing. 13 year old boy who refuses to eat any eggs whatsoever devoured it. served w/ fresh fruit and crusty baguette.

Great recipe! Made it as written for a party, and it is delicious. I make a lower fat version for an every day version of the meal- substitute Canadian bacon, low fat cheese, evaporated milk, 1 whole egg & 4 egg whites. Still very good, but a lot healthier!

First time I ever made quiche, and it was the best quiche I've ever had. I used a frozen Mrs. Smith's pie crust due to time constraints and company in the house. So easy and so delicious! I can't wait to make this again! One note: keep in for the full 35 minutes. I removed from oven at 30 minutes because it was the perfect shade of brown on top, but once cut open, it was slightly runny. Next time maybe I'll use foil on top for the last 5 min.! An A+++++ recipe!

This quiche is delicious and easy to make. I have made it twice now and each time, people have gone back for seconds leaving me no leftovers! My rating is for the recipe, as directed. It is a great addition to brunch. Note: the second time I made this, I substituted egg beaters and 1% milk. It was just as good as the original recipe but lower in calorie and fat.

After reading a few reviews, I made a few changes like others suggested. I used spinach instead of arugula and light cream instead of heavy cream. The crust was very flaky, and the filling was light and flavorful.

Good all around quiche. I always use baby arugula which gives me all of the arugula flavor without all the bitterness of regular arugula. If baby arugula isn't available, a mix with spinach is a good idea.

Amazing recipe - better than any restaurant quiche I have ever tasted. The combination of balsamic vinegar, arugula and shallots is outstanding. We made it as written and had a little too much filling to fit in the crust.

Was delicious, but a little overkill on the arugula....I actually mixed 1/2 arugula, and 1/2 spinach and it was overpowering...next time I will cut total greens quantity in half. Also, for consistency, pour half of egg mixture into tart shell first...then greens and bacon, then finish with remaining....otherwi se it's a bit like a spinach pie topped with egg layer, rather than quiche. Did use half and half rather than cream and was plenty rich...next time will try half milk....

I've never made quiche before, and this turned out delicious! Made it for New Year's Day brunch with my friends. I was short on time, so-- like several other reviewers-- I used a pre-made pie shell. I recommend deep dish if you can find it, as the recipe filled my deep dish shell up to the brim! Also, I did use spinach. So yummy!

Rating: 4
Made this for Sunday Brunch and it's definitely a keeper. I did something I hate however and made a few slight changes before making ir as written. Used a premade frozen pie crust, 5 oz carton of baby arugula, slightly less than 2 tsp. balsamic, two whole eggs and two egg yolks for a more custard like texture and 1/2 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup half & half. I believe it's the best quiche I've ever made. I didn't find it at all bitter and will definitely make it again--with my few changes.

I made this quiche for my parents and boyfriend and they loved it...I did too of course. I did make some changes though. I used spinach instead of arugula bc. there wasn't any @ the grocery store. And I used mozzarella cheese bc. it's cheaper and I had been using gruyere a lot lately in other recipes, but the mozzarella was great. When I mixed everything together, I poured it into the pie crust and then sliced a tomato and put the slices on the top of the quiche. The remaining cheese I had i sprinkled over the top. It was perfectly brown and delicious... no doubt about it. The balsalmic gave this dish just enough flavor, but didn't overpower.

I took other reviewers' advice and used bagged baby spinach instead of arugula. Fabulous! I also used a 9 inch frozen organic pie crust which I partially baked ahead of time. Ingredients fit perfectly. Will try whole milk instead of cream next time.

This was tasty and sophisticated. Used the pastry recipe without shortening given by another reviewer. Used half whipping cream and half milk, and also a mix of arugula and rocket leaves that I had in the fridge anyway. To cut the fat, I drained off the bacon fat and sauted the shallots in the nonstick pan.

Rating: 4
I too used a frozen crust and mix of spinach/arugula. Based on feedback from other cooks, I used half and half instead of whipping cream and that was plenty rich. I think I will used whole milk next time but the quiche was delicious and turned out beautifully, just like the photo!

FantastiK......left out the balsamic vinegar did half spinach and half arugula...A little more bacon then recipe called for ..yummy.......Used a frozen crust vs making my own......My first time making Quiche and I must say it was terrific....Easy to make but a little more time consuming then I thought but well worth it......Will be preparing again in the near future......could not have been more Pleased...!!!!

I actually ended up converting these to mini quiche for our Easter get together. They were fabulous! Creamy, rich, and slightly piquant with the addition of the arugula, which I loved. But, I have to ask: Who has time to trim the stems of arugula? :-) I baked them with stems-on (it was organic baby arugula so the stems weren't tough or anything) and some of the stems stuck out of the quiches and my in-laws jokingly called them mice tails. Ha ha. Anyways, make it with the arugula, it's a refreshing diversion from your classic spinach quiche.

Rating: 3
Like other reviewers, I used baby spinach instead of arugula. This quiche is exceptional. I didn't notice lots of flavor coming from the bacon so I might add a bit more in the future. The second time I made it I used a frozen pie crust just to save some time. However the crust in the recipe is great if you have the time to make it. Both times I've made the quiche I baked it for about 15 minutes. Once cooled, I put it in the fridge overnight, and baked it for another 15 minutes the next morning. You can adjust cooking time based on your oven temp. Perfection!

This was good. It was actually the first time I'd ever made a pie crust, and it came out well - very flaky. I used a 10" glass pie plate and 1/3 (1/2 cup) stone ground whole wheat flour. The package of organic baby arugula I bought ended up being only 5 oz, so the sharp taste was not overwhelming - in fact it made for a very savory dish.

Rating: 4
Yummy. I plan to serve with tomatoes tossed in balsamic and cantalope next time for a crowd. Unlike many before I actually used the arugula and enjoyed it but I think the idea to blanch before is good. I did think it was too rich. Next time I am definitly draining the grease and using EEVO to saute the shallots, using whole milk instead of cream, and omitting the salt which was not necessary.

This is a great quiche. I'm definitely going to make it again!

My husband isn't much of a quiche fan but I made this last night and he loved it! I used a frozen crust, frozen spinach (defrosted), regular onions and plain Swiss cheese. Even with all the substitutions it was still the best quiche I've ever had and I'll be making it again!

Loved this recipe - tried to make it a bit more healthy by using whole wheat & canola crust, egg substitute, fat free 1/2 & 1/2 and draining bacon grease & adding olive oil. It was still fabulous - the slightly carmelized shallots were delicious!

I've made this dozens of times over the past couple of years, and it gets raves every time. I use store-bought frozen crust (2 in a package - I double the recipe because it freezes so well), drain most of the fat before adding the shallots and baby spinach (instead of arugula), and have never added the vinegar (because I forgot it the first time, and it was so great without it).

Awesome - I used an Arugula Spinach blend made by Fresh Express and baked it the night before and then reheated it for dinner. We kept going back for more until half of it was gone. This will be my new standard quiche recipe.

This is an excellent recipe as is, and is a great "base" for creative alternatives as suggested in other reviews. Nice crust. I did try it with extra bacon, as some reviewers encouraged, and I found the bacon overwhelmed the other tastes.

I served this, and about four other quiches to my family and friends at our house-warming party, and this particular one was definately the favorite. I have made it again, both with spinach and arugula, with home-made and store-bought crusts, and it's great both ways.

Rating: 4
I thought this quiche was one of the best I've ever had! I used a whole wheat store-bought crust and turkey bacon and it was still fabulous. I followed the advice of one person and carmelized the shallots instead of just softening them - also had to use olive oil since the turkey bacon didn't give me enough fat in the pan. Will defintley make this again especially since its such a "flexible" recipie.

I made this for a bunch of friends prior to going to watch one of them take a circus skills course. They absolutely devoured it, except for the girl who'd just split up from her boyfriend, but that's another story and not the fault of the quiche. Try this recipe! Use spinach - it works beautifully. Don't be afraid to go overboard on the bacon, and don't expect to have any left over.

You must use the Arugula. That's what is so special about it.

Okay... I made this the first time with spinach and frozen crust-- awesome, and not too time-consuming. Then I made it with arugula-- which I generally like (raw). Yuck! I don't know if it was my arugula or me, but it was sooo bitter. And my arugula looked and smelled good before I cooked it... Stick with the spinach and this is a 3-fork recipe or better.

Very good! Like others, I used a frozen pie crust, and spinach instead of arugola because it was what my grocery store had. (Substituted fontina for the gruyere for the same reason.) It turned out nicely rich and flavorful, but not overpowering, and not at all greasy. Can't wait to try it again with the actual ingredients!

I made this dish exactly as written in the recipe, precisely down to each jot and tittle, and... Just kidding - this is an Epicurious recipe review, so of course there were substitutions :) So, anyway: Like most people, I substituted spinach for the arugula, only because there was no arugula in the store that day. I used onion instead of shallots, even thought the store had plenty of shallots, because I didn't feel like buying them and I already had onions at home. Also, I caramelized the onions a little instead of just cooking until soft, as the recipe says. Finally, I increased the amount of dough by 1/6, because I didn't think a 12-inch round would be large enough to cover the pan with doubled sides (9 inch pan, 1 inch sides means an 11-inch round, but doubling the sides makes it 13 inches required). So that's an extract 1/4 cup of flour, Tablespoon of butter, 1/2 tablespoon of shortening, and a pinch of salt. Other than that, I followed the recipe exacly. ... and it was delicious! And equally good reheated the next day.

A bit of a disappoinment actually. I used my own favorite crust recipe, and sub'd quatro formaggio for the gruyere. Can't imagine that that one substitution made all of a difference, but apparently it did. First, and last time for this recipe.

I gave this recipe 4 forks based on the rave reviews I got! I sent my quiches along and joined the party later and as soon as I walked through the door, I was told that my quiches were FABULOUS! I did make some substitutions. Used spinach instead of arugula and added sauteed red onions instead of the shallots. Used about 4 eggs and had some mixture left over. I made another quiche using sauteed mushrooms, roasted red peppers, and sauteed red onions. Added a little feta cheese since I did not have enough of the gruyere. And voila, it hit the spot for many. I will keep this one in my repertoire.

Wonderful quiche recipe, have made it a few times already, great w/mixed green salad and Sauvignon Blanc (contrasts nicely w/richness of the quiche) for dinner. I love the arugula and balsamic w/the bacon, although I have substituted spinach at times, and though I tried regular Swiss instead of Gruyere last time I made it, I think the Gruyere flavor is unbeatable here. I use whole milk instead of whipping cream, and I make the crust from Pepin's Cooking w/Claudine cookbook, 1 c. flour, 6 T butter, 1/8t salt, 1/4 t. sugar, 3T ice water, which cuts out the shortening, doesn't need chilling, and works well in a 9-inch glass pie pan. Definitely a keeper.

This was delicious. Even though I had to make it crustless, as after I bought the arugula in anticipation of making it..my husband started on the low-carb diet! I loved the balance of flavors, and did not find the arugula too bitter at all. I can only dream of how delicious it would be with an unctious crust. The funny thing is.. he probably won't eat it anyway..but we'll see.

Great presentation, but straight arugula is way too bitter, and I like bitter flavors. I noticed that some of the rave reviewers used mesclun mix or spinach. If I were to do it again, I'd cut way back on the arugula and mix it with a sweeter green, like spinach.

Rating: 4
I thought the flavors in this were excellent. My house smells amazing too! I had a slight meltdown with the crust (haven't learned enough Swedish, and I bought puff pastry by mistake, and it puffed all over the place when I was proofing it) so, I baked this off crustless. The only change I made was to use 2 eggs, as I like a more custardy texture and I added a pinch of nutmeg to the custard. Very excellent flavor combination and super easy!

Rating: 4
I cheated and used a refrigerated pie crust. I also subbed the arugula with frozen chopped spinach (squeezed dry). Othewise followed the instructions. After baking I crumbled a pile of cooked bacon as a garnish (and of course for those who like extra bacon). Everyone at my brunch raved about the quiche and wanted the recipe. Also made the Hash Brown Casserole from this site along w/it. Well received by all.

My husband LOVES this quiche (and he's not really a quiche kind of guy usually). The first time I made this, I didn't have all the necessary ingredients, so I made the following changes that were quite yummy: I used a mesculin mix heavy on the radicchio instead of arugula, used a mixture of shallots and vidalia onions, and prosciutto instead of bacon. Very yummy. It's the gruyere that makes the dish (in my opinion), so don't cheap out and use regular swiss -- it won't be the same.

I made this quiche the first time as written, only with a crust using quinoa flour, which added a lot of flavor and was very flaky. My guests loved it, but I thought the arugula was slightly bitter.

I was really looking forward to this dinner, but the whole is definitely not greater than the sum of the parts! I followed it as written, despite the fact that it uses less eggs and far less milk/cream than my basic recipe. I'm surprised that no-one else has had problems with the lack of filling (I typically use 4 eggs and a total of 2 cups milk/cream) The arugula mixture was incredible on its own (and will reappear at this table as a green vegetable dish, possibly also made with kale, as previously suggested), but really wasn't great once baked. A good idea that didn't work.

No doubt that it would be delicious with gruyere or swiss also. A definite repeat.

delicious. might add more bacon next time and more shallots-- it was a little mild tasting. i was worried about my mom's potentially fickle reaction to the arugula based on another reviewer's noting bitterness, but she pronounced it delicious too. pre-made crust was just fine. hardest thing was not eating the shallot-bacon-arugula mixture before putting it together to bake! made night before and re-heated, still yummy.
