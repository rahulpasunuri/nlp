Dressing is wonderful, but I would double amount made with the exception of the capers. keep that amount the same. Capers have a strong flavor. This was very easy to make and my husband and I both enjoyed it.

i only made the dressing, and used it on a fresh buffalo mozzarella/arugula/tomato salad. it was OUTSTANDING!! we probably ate half a loaf of bread to mop up the dressing! i used jarred roasted red peppers and will definitely make this again.

Very good. I don't normally like bell peppers, but in this salad dressing, they were quite nice. I used a different cheese on the crostini and it was delicious with that substitution.

I love the combination of arugula and radicchio together and the dressing is delicious. But frankly, I actually liked the dressing better when I made it with purchased roasted red peppers in a jar.
