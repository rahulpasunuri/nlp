This is such a bad ass surprise...perfect potluck summer salad. DO NOT substitute the freshly ground coriander, it is the key to this recipe's uniqueness. I did not have a ripe avocado the second time I made this salad, found that cubed mozzarella worked nicely. Cheers.

I found this salad to be a great match with light bodied white wines. I elected to leave the cilantro out and added mint instead. The acidity of the tomatoes and the tang of the watermelon really complement each other. The balsamic finishes it off nicely and beckons for something off the grill. Separately, I got a thumbs-ups from my vegetarian/ vegan friends.

Really terrific. I served this salad with fish tacos, so our herb of choice was cilantro. I used some fresh lettuce right out of the garden on a large platter then heaped this salad in the middle and dressed the whole thing. No leftovers tonight!

OMG! This is even better than it looks! I couldn't afford heirloom tomatoes so I used Romas, instead. I did not peel the cucumber, but just scored the skin with my zester. My herbs on hand were basil and cilantro, which were perfect with tomatoes and with avocados. I did not even think about doing the beautiful mosaic. I just tossed it in a large glass bowl.

Worth making. Although, don't expect to assemble as perfectly as the photo. I tried to and the colors weren't as bright. Next time, I'll probably just throw everything in a big trifle. My friends still talk about this salad and I made it over a year ago.

I tripled the recipe for a large party. Despite a few people being dubious about the unusual combination of ingredients, everybody loved the salad and quite a few asked for the recipe. I added feta cheese and used fresh mint, coriander (cilantro) and parsley.

This is a fabulous dish. Used fresh mint, chives, and cilantro. Didn't really measure but it was definitely more than a tablespoon.Waited to mix ingredients until the very last minute which kept the mix from getting too soupy.

This is an amazing recipe. I made it for a group of girls who came for dinner and everyone loved it! I had some leftover salad and have been enjoying it for days... I tried a variation a reviewer suggested (champagne vinegar and mint) and it was delicious! I can't wait to try other variations... I'm thinking basil and mozzarella. definitely something I will make again!

This was heavenly. I used all farmer's market ingredients except the avocado - I live in VA, so they don't really grow here. This dish was so simple but so, so delicious, and it really let the flavors of the fresh fruit and veggies shine. As for the herbs, I used basil, mint, and tarragon because I had them. The mint made it, but the tarragon definitely added some interest. I also added feta, which I think was a must, flavor wise. The first day, we ate it with serrano ham, arugula and havarti grilled cheese sandwiches and an Argentinian Tempranillo, and then I topped the leftovers with a poached egg for breakfast the next day. Both pairings worked amazingly!

Really enjoyed this salad -- nice change to have a watermelon salad without feta. Enjoyed the combination of tomatoes and watermelon -- the Cumin definitely adds a great subtle flavor. Didn't have an avocado. Used mint and basil. Will definitely make again.

WOW. I made this sans avocado and with champagne vinegar. WOW WOW WOW. I used cilantro and mint. Wow. I love this. I will eat it until watermelon season is over.

This was pretty good. I would make it again. I used basil, tarragon and chives, ground coriander, and added feta cheese. Also used white balsamic vinegar on the advice of previous reviewers, to preserve the beautiful colors in this dish. All the guests seemed to enjoy it, and the host insisted on keeping the leftovers.

What a great salad! I served this at my book club last night and it was the hit of the evening. My herb combination was basil, mint, chives, thyme, tarragon and parsley. I used lemon flavored olive oil and a thick aged balsamic vinegar.

This was great! I'm not a big tomato person, but paired with the watermelon it was excellent.

I thought this was AMAZING! I followed the recipe exactly as written and loved it; however there are a few things worth noting. This will get soupy, so I recommend saving the avocado and watermelon for just before serving. I used the herbs I had on hard which were: basil, mint and Italian flat leaf parsley and thought it was just right. I REALLY think the mint made the dish! I followed the previous commentor's advice and made gazpacho with the leftovers (after picking out the avocado) and thought it too was fantastic. I can't wait to make this for an upcoming BBQ - great summer side!

I learned the hard way that this is a recipe that you really need to prepare immediately before serving. Or add the watermelon right before it goes to the table. Otherwise, the salad gets very soupy very quickly. I liked the flavors, but I got a so-so reaction from my family. I think next time I'll just make an avocado and tomato relish and serve watermelon chunks on the side.

I think the most interesting thing about this salad is the checkerboard presentation. Otherwise, I found the flavor underwhelming.

Great salad with summer dinner. Followed recipe as written, except I used white balsamic instead of dark as others suggested. I also added 1 chopped jalepeno pepper. Everybody loved it, and I will definitely make it again. There were no left overs.

Delicious and nutritious! It was pretty easy to make and colorful to boot. My guests were in awe over it.

This was a great salad, but the leftovers were even better as gazpacho, as suggested by another reviewer. I took the soupy leftovers (I picked out the avocado chunks and saved them for garnish because I wasn't sure how it would look blended in) Pureed with a hot pepper it is some of the best gazpacho I have ever had.

I liked this, but my guests seemed to love it - i think that it was the excellent homegrown tomatoes.

This was good - but not great, which surprised me given the other reviews. It just needed more umph. Also, it can get very soupy - which gave me an idea with the leftovers. I put them all in a blender with a chili pepper, and it honestly made one of the better gazpacho soups I've had - and I thought tasted better than the salad did!

This salad was simply delicious and refreshing for a summer day picnic. Everyone in our party loved it and it went together easily at the last minute. I didn't have corriander seeds, so left them out, but am curious if that would change the taste noticeably. Would definitely make this again!

This is really light and delicious. We just had it for a summer dinner, but it would go equally well at a brunch. I added cantaloupe and mint because I had them. Next time I will try a white balsamic (you lose the beautiful colors with the dark stuff) and either a fresh mozzarella or chevre cheese.

lovely and fresh tasting. I did not have coriander seeds, but it was tasty.

Although I am not a tomato lover, this is a wonderful and refreshing salad that I will definitely make again. I substituted the balsamic vinegar with lemon juice and added a little more fresh herbs then called for in the recipe. Basil and tarragon were a great combination!

Made this salad yesterday for a group of 8 and it was a big hit. I used both lemon juice and balsamic vinegar, after deciding just lemon wasn't quite enough kick. Next time I'll use pre-ground Coriander seeds because it's just as readily available as full seeds. Definitely use the best ingredients you can. If you use a flavorless tomato, you'll end up with a flavorless salad. Next time I'll try adding some feta, or maybe some chopped jalapeno, but the dish certainly doesn't need either.

It would work even without the herbs.. and fresh lemon or lime juice instead the balsamic. Perfect for summer days. :)

Use lemeon juice instead of Balsamic. It looks and tastes much fresher.

I haven't made this recipe but there is another on this site call Cucumber, Tomato, Pineapple Salad with Asian dressing. I substitute the pineapple for watermelon when I make it and its delicous. I'll have to make this one and compare.

Fantastic. Use the best produce you can find. It's worth it.

I also made this for a potluck and everyone enjoyed it. It was the first dish that was finished. I added feta cheese.

I was doubting the watermelon-tomato combination, but it was actually pretty good. I served it at a potluck and had feta on the side, and I think it was much better with the addition of feta (salt/tangy factor). Definitely invest in quality ingredients like good heirloom tomatoes and fresh watermelon. In the future, however, I think I'd just prefer a greek salad with watermelon on the side.

Loved this recipe. Reminded me of a salad I had at a restaurant in Brooklyn. Used a squeeze of lemon as opposed to the balsamic.
