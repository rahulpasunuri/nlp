Excellent basic recipe. I did not have unsweetened chocolate, so I made the basic recipe (using only a little over 3/4 cup of sugar) and added mini chocolate chips and raisins to the mix. Removing the crusts is also important.

Always a big hit with friends and family and easy to make. I add about a teaspoon of cinnamon to custard and/or sometimes substitute half Mexican chocolate.

I've been on a bread making kick lately and had a leftover loaf of french bread that was stale. The bread wasn't my favorite, which could completely be why I didn't love this recipe! Used the leftover loaf (left crust on), only had 1/2 c. of cream on hand, so used whole milk for rest. Also added a handful of chocolate chips before pouring on custard. Recipe was good, not outstanding. Think it needed a pinch of salt and a little vanilla.

I made this with 1/2 bittersweet and 1/2 semi-sweet chocolate and added only 1/2 c. of sugar. I also used leftover brioche rolls. The pudding came out great, not too sweet and not too rich. It was a crowd pleaser and I will definitely make again.

I made this recipe using leftover challah bread and 2% milk. My chopped chocolate did not melt properly in the milk mixture, but melted during cooking so it did not matter. The recipe was very good, not too sweet, and judged a winner by my teenage boys. This will be great to play with, as other reviewers have done.

This recipe made me love bread pudding. First off let me admit that I am not a recipe follower, rather I use it as a jumping off point (which is why I don't bake much). That is why I like bread pudding because I didn't mess it up by not following exactly. I just used whatever leftover crusty bread we had. I toasted the cubes before soaking them in custard. I also used dark chocolate chunks instead of making the custard chocolaty. An absolute hit with family and friends. Great with vanilla ice cream or dollop of whipped cream.

Great recipe but I jeuged it a bit...instead of adding the chocolate to the custard, I tucked it in chunks between the bread. I also added dollops of dulce de leche half way through baking...Amazing!

Simple and incredible. I used half french bread (no crusts) and half leftover ricotta bread (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/ricotta-bread/detail.aspx) and the combination worked out great. I also used unsweetened Ghirardelli for the chocolate and 2% milk. It was relaxing to prep, and the cooking time worked out nicely - popped the pudding into the oven just as we sat down to our meal and it was done as we were finishing up. Perfect at the stated cooking time in my convection oven.

I know, I know, it sucks when people post a review and didn't follow the recipe exactly. But if you're like me, you're only looking at bread pudding recipes to get rid of some half-eaten loaves in the freezer, in serious danger of getting razor- burn. Most of these recipes are calling for "french" bread. So, as an FYI, I followed this recipe, but used a combo of TJ's white whole wheat and shepherd's breads and it's totally delish. So, no, it doesn't *have* to be french bread. I also threw in some raisins. ;-)

My sister took her first bite and wondered aloud how she could get another piece! I added a Tb of instant coffee and 2 Tb of cocoa powder to the chocolate mixture before pouring over the bread. Great to prep ahead for a crowd and delicious served with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream or creme anglaise.

Like some of the others, I had a problem with this setting up. I used french bread with a crust (I like the crunchy crust in bread pudding), and felt like maybe having 1 or 2 cups additional bread would have made it less soupy. I will definitely try this again (with more bread) as the flavor was amazing!

yummy! I added 1/2 C of cold coffee to replace part of the liquid. Also used 1% milk - still plenty rich.

I just made this and thought it was great. I didn't have a problem with the presentation...it came out of the pan in neat squares. I wasn't really going for presentation, serving it to my husband and a close friend, but I think it would present well with the addition of powdered sugar, raspberries, &/or creme anglaise, as other reviewers have suggested. Overall, very tasty comfort food. Served with vanilla ice cream...will try with coffee ice cream, also.

This is a rich and creamy over-the-top chocolately dessert. To the reader who said it wasn't pretty--I live in Charlotte, NC and first tasted this at Dearstyne's Bistro in Waxhaw, NC where it was created. What the recipe fails to tell you is that it is served warm, topped with a creme anglaise (get the recipe also from Epicurious.com). Try this, seved on your best china, garnished with a mint sprig or a few fresh raspberries, and I promise your guests will be impressed. I've made it twice now at my most elegant dinner parties and have totally blown everyone away. The best part is you can make it AHEAD of time, keep it warm, refrigerate the creme anglaise until ready to serve, and voila! PERFECTION.

I like bread pudding, my husband said try this chocolate bread pudding for our dinner club. It is unattractive. Lumpy brown. I wish I had read about hiding it under confection sugar dusting. Was really concerned about presenting it to dinner club. So I looked in another cookbook, did a sauce with sugar/butter/water/whiskey. I hid the dessert under aluminum foil, warmed it during the dinner, put it on each plate with the sauce. And put a generous amount of whipped cream on top. It still was not beautiful. Everyone wanted to know what it was, and everyone ate it. One person had seconds, but this dinner club has serious dessert eaters and I went home with 1/2 a dessert. This is just not that terrific.

Very chocolate-y and delicious. I only made two slight changes...I used Hawaiian bread (crust removed), and baked the pudding in a bain marie (hot water bath.) I think both of these changes helped make it very velvety. Everyone loved it.

I used croissants to make this bread pudding and the results were super sweet and really rich! The croissants give it an interesting texture and allows it to not get so soaked with the pudding sauce. A must try!

This is just an OK chocolate bread pudding. I am going to try some other recipes on the site. It was definitely very moist, but too rich. I ended up adding bananas to the recipe. The presentation wasn't the prettiest (in fact, it's a bit messy), but we found that adding powdered sugar made everything better.

If I can't screw up a recipe, nobody can. Made this last night and used the ingredients on the shelf. Didn't have 4 oz. of unsweetened chocolate, so I used 2 oz. of Baker's unsweetened and 2 oz. of Hershey's semi-sweet. Cut the sugar down to 1/8 cup. Also replaced the whole milk with 2% and the heavy cream with 1/2 & 1/2. It was still very good, even though I overbaked it (never know when stuff is done at this elevation). Can't wait to make this with the proper ingredients!! Yum, yum.

Outstanding chocolate bread pudding! I served this to several chocolaholics and they loved it. I used challah (egg bread) and left on the crusts. I didn't find that the expensive Sharfenberger chocolate was worth the additional expense and was quite satified with Bakers. Serve warm with ice cream and whipped cream. A real treat!

My friend has been trying out recipes for chocolate bread pudding, recently, so I decided to join the fray. I've made great regular bread pudding before, but what I really want is the recipe for the chocolate croissant bread pudding from the Chocolate Bar at the Meridien hotel in Boston. Nevertheless, this recipe is pretty darn good, btw 3 and 4 forks. I would have liked all of the custard to soak into the bread cubes, but a notoriously picky friend (doesn't like cake, pasta, rice, noodles, spicy things, hot things...) liked it a lot. Go figure. My boyfriend liked it, too. It wasn't too chocolatey, just enough, and the custard-soaked bits were wonderful. BEst out of the oven, and I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe. It just wasn't the bread pudding from the Meridien...

pretty good flavor, but way too rich. it was my 2nd time eating bread pudding, and i just wasn't that impressed, even though i'm a die-hard chocolate fan. easy, but i wouldn't serve it to guests, and would probably make something more interesting & less (ugh) rich for myself. better, more classy desserts out there. even in nyc.

Very rich! Easy for kids to make. Works at high altitude. Excellent winter-time comfort food. However, it looks like bear scat and it is a lot of the same flavor and texture (it's not very complex even when made with premium chocolate). I wouldn't whip it up for a formal dinner party. I would definitely make it again for the family or for something like an after ski party.

yes, it's all true! This is an easy recipe that turns out a superb dessert that will make you fall in love with bread pudding and keep coming back for more! I doubled the batch, made a mistake (used bittersweet chocolate) and it was a huge success. It's the sort of dish that you leave on your kitchen counter with a spoon inside and you can't stop until it's gone! And yes, it's rich, but what do you expect from a dish that combines egg yolks, butter, heavy cream, whole milk and chocolate! relax and enjoy!

WOW-i cook alot and loved this recipe...i used sharffenberger chocolate and as a previous reviewer suggested, i put the chocolate mixture into the bread to soak before putting into the baking dish, and then i folded the mixture a couple of times (being careful not to mash it up)...how anyone who enjoys bread pudding and chocolate would not enjoy this is beyond me...however, it may be easy to use too much bread yielding too little custard, do not overcook and USE GOOD CHOCOLATE! enjoy this one, its a treat!

This was my first bread pudding of any kind, and I really loved it. I made it for dessert for a Sunday brunch. I used French bread and cheated by not cutting all the crust off. I think next time I'll cut off the crusts because they turn out chewy. I would also mix the chocolate custard with bread in a separate bowl, mix, let sit, and then transfer to baking pan. This will make sure the bread and custard mix completely. It was very good with vanilla ice cream

I've never made bread pudding, never ate it before, but someone I love loves bread pudding so I made this recipe for his birthday. He really enjoyed this recipe and so did I. I made the bourbon-pecan carmel sauce from another chocolate bread pudding recipe on this site. The sauce was oh so very good and went wonderfully with this bread pudding. I never would have thought that something so decadent could be so easy.

I am a bread pudding fanatic and try it in any restaurant that serves it. I've loved this one since the day Dearstyne's opened. This recipe is easy and always a big hit with guests. I've made it with both types of bread but it's worth the search for a good quality French bread.

Okay, I'm NOT a bread pudding fan, but for some reason or another, this just sounded kinda yummy (and eady). I too, used Challa bread and left half of the crust on (too much work to cut it all off). When finished, this tasted like soft, warm, gooey, chocolate cake and was much easier to make. Little dab of vanilla ice cream on the side... Super yummy!

This turned out pretty good. Being a chocolate freak it is not as chocolately as I would of hoped. But all I think it needs for those chocolate fanatics is a handful of chocolate chips. But the texture is very moist and creamy.
