This recipe is for pork LOIN boneless ribs-they have hardly any fat, they similar to boneless loin chops. They are not boneless country ribs which are marbled with fat and need about 45 min to cook. For this cut of meat 18 minutes is fair-any more and the meat will dry out

It tickles me that so many people are ignorant about the cuts of meat. Around our neck of the woods they are called boneless country style ribs. You can bake them with bbq sauce in the oven if you want or do them on the grill. To the preveous submitter, would you do boneless pork loin chops for more then 18 min's on the grill

There is no way to make ribs in 18 minutes. Now, if you want to start off with 18 minutes on the grill, then coat them with sauce and cover with wax paper and foil and pop them into the oven for 1 1/2 hours..then okay. But, please...18 minutes on the grill will only give you shoe leather. Boiling ribs just kills the meat and that is just my personal opinion. Just like boiling vegetables to death, it's just wrong.

The zipperheads who slammed this "recipe" have probably never even seen boneless pork ribs except at Mcdonalds. They're pork loin cuts close to pork chops but with a taste closer to ribs..... Yes,"low and slow" is best for these but for those who actually work for a living this recipe will do in a pinch. If you have the time,bake for 2.5 hrs in the sauce and finish on the grill. It's basic...but you have to start out somewhere.

Just a note to all those concerned with the inclusion of this recipe on the website - I was raised by a woman who did not eat pork - ever. I had never eaten pork ribs until I met my husband. So people like me need a starting point - and this recipe appears to be it. I knew to boil the ribs first though (becasue I read the instructions on the package from the grocery store, lol). I think that indicating in the review that cooking them for 18 minutes will not generate the expected results is important information, but passing judgement on someone who needs a basic recipe is unnecessary.

This is geared toward the last reviewer, Mike. Boneless ribs have been a staple of my sauce making for a decade and are very tasty. You can buy them in any larger market righted next to the boned ones. I was looking for a recipe that was a little more creative than this, as this one is the quick staple that I use every summer.

You have got to be kidding me! If you have to have a recipe to make BBQ ribs, you obviously have no business lighting a grill. Where do you buy boneless ribs? Just plain out of the bottle BBQ sauce?

I believe boneless ribs are more on the order of a pork loin not to replace ribs but for ease and speed of cooking. Relax everyone, the green onions are a garnish. Great idea for the working cook with little time but likes variety. Serve with corn on the cob steamed in the microwave and store bought coleslaw. Sometimes a quick shortcut helps even if you are an "epicure". I added orange apricot marmalade to the bbq sauce, but honey or maple syrup can work, use your imagination.

I beleive an entire step was omitted in the recipe, as pork ribs or any ribs for that matter, will never get done in a mere 18 minutes. If you take the ribs first, and place them in a pot of water to gently boil, for about 40 minutes prior to BBQ'ing, they will certainly melt in your mouth. The onions, i would imagine, would be good to boil along with the pork for added flavor, along with any other desired seasonings.

Ribs in 18 minutes??? Hardly.

First of all, I don't believe any ol' bottled barbeque sauce is a recipe! Second, like other reviewers have said, you don't make good barbeque in minutes. Good barbeque is a thing of love and although there are a few things that can be grilled off quickly, ribs are not one of them. If you don't want to take the time to make good and true barbeque, buy ribs at your local deli. They would be better than these.

This recipe is almost as good as "Sweetened Strawberries". I was confused about when to use the onions, though. Next time, I think I'll just leave them out as it makes the recipe much less complicated.

Even though it may rank high for simplicity, this recipe does not produce the succulent, tasty ribs we all know and love. Even with a gourmet or homemade bbq sauce, it lacks. May be fine for children or those who do not cook.

This "recipe" is great for those who consider the microwave their main cooking tool and want to be "adventurous". This belongs in a book titled "Cooking for dummies".

This recipe was very good. Its quick, simple, and children could help prepare it with their parents. Great for the early beginning cook. Thank You!

This has got to be the dumbest recipe I've ever seen. It should go in the same recipe file as "Boiled Water", "Ice Cubes", or "How to make Salt and Pepper Seasoning". My guess is that some food writer didn't complete an assignment and tried to pass this off as a bone fide recipe. PUH-leez!

I must say this was very meaty and tasty, I used a combo of BBQ sauces, one sweet, one smokey and one with onions. This BBQ was a big hit for all my guests especially with homade baked beans and home grown corn I had frozen. EAT HARDY AND ENJOY
