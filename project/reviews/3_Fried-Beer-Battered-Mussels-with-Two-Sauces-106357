Sauces were nothing special. I have had many different recipes with muscles and this one is near the bottom

I rarely make deep-fried recipes but I had mussels left over and tried this one. The batter was very simple, but light and wonderful. I only made the basic mayo/mustard sauce so I cannot judge both.
