excellent light supper for two, when a souffle dish would be too large. I made my own creamed spinach from a Cooking Light recipe, but I think it was less quantity. Also used asiago rather than swiss cheese, cutting the amount down to 2 ounces - which was plenty. The roasted pepper sauce added a nice contrast of texture and flavor with a little kick from the balsamic. Yummy.

Although not technically a real soufflé (as it does not call for bechamel sauce), I find it much quicker to make and absolutely delicious. Served with home made tomato sauce, this is a recipe I made once with frozen spinach and once with beet greens that I "cream" myself with what I have available. A keeper.

I've never made a souffle, and I had to make a million substitutions (including making my own roasted red peppers, and improvising on the "creamed spinach" because I only had frozen regular spinach.. but it was still awesome. You can't go wrong with this dish.

I made this without the sauce, and it was delicious! I couldn't stop eating it. It didn't puff up as much as I anticipated, but I used the frozen chopped spinach, instead of creamed, which I think weighed it down. Next time I will purée my spinach before adding the eggs.

Tasty dish, easy to prepare. Works well as a side dish. Like other reviewers, I made my own creamed spinach. Since I wanted a stronger cheese flavor, I used a mix of freshly shredded parmesan and grated romano instead of swiss cheese. For the red pepper sauce, I added some zip by using half roasted red peppers and half peppadews (a sweet piquante pepper product).

This was so profoundly awful, I couldn't ask anyone to eat it. I followed the recipe exactly and everything. Blech.

Hey Bridgewater...you are correct in your total egg quantity, but they are incorporated into the recipe separately. That's why it's stated that way. Hope that helps.

I am planning to make this recipe for Thanksgiving next week and I have a question. The recipe calls for 2 large egg yolks and 3 large egg whites. Does this simply mean 2 whole eggs and 1 additional egg white or am I reading this wrong?

Easy to make, including creaming fresh spinach, and very colorful and tasty. I made cornbread as the side and put the sauce on that, too. And I changed nothing in the recipe.

this recipe looks great but one problem: i live in australia where there is no frozen creamed spinach...any suggestions for a substitute?

I made this for my husband and a couple of friends. Everyone loved it and it was super easy to make. It was enough to feed four with a salad and bread, but would be even better just for two like it's supposed to be (I failed to notice it was supposed to be for 2). Yummy!

A quickly elegant and yummy dish. For more pizzaz, I'd definitely add another vegetable besides the creamed spinach (steamed asparagus works well for the dish's aesthetics) and use other types of cheese (this time, I used a combo of cheddar and parmesan instead of swiss). Also, I have no idea why they want you to buy frozen creamed spinach when creamed spinach takes less than 5 minutes to make - and will taste better if you make it yourself.

would make it again...definitely dont need the sauce!

This was not over the top for me but very nice. The souffle was not as light as I had hoped for but my creamed spinach may have been a little heavy as I made my own. I might consider adding and extra egg white or 2 next time.

This is a perfect dish for one who's had dental work. The souffle was delicious, so easy to make, especially since you probably have most of the ingredients on hand. However, I do not recommend the roasted red pepper sauce. We found it to be very bitter. I added a sprinkle of parmesan cheese on top just for an extra "zest" to the dish.

I couldn't find creamed spinach and made my own from Joy of Cooking. I'm sure that helped make the final product delicious plus it had less fat since I used chicken broth instead of cream. I made this a few weeks ago and the flavor of the souffle still haunts me - and it wasn't even as good as the red pepper sauce! A great dish for being so easy.

I'd never made a souffle before, so I was a bit uncertain how this would turn out. I needn't have worried -- not only was it easy to prepare, but it was also very tasty. A definite keeper.

I discovered this recipe when I was looking for something soft after dental work. What a keeper! Quick, easy and delicious. My only substantive change is to roast fresh peppers for the sauce, which I far prefer to the canned ones. I use the juice that drains from the peppers, puree two with balsamic and finely chop two (any color) to add with shallot. It's good with other things, too.

This recipe is easy and tasty. I didn't have creamed spinach so I made some homemade and then I substituted smoked gouda cheese for the swiss cheese. It was light and delicious.

For two people this made a wonderful main course along with some fresh biscuits. I loved the sauce! Balsamic vinegar adds a little "zip." And this is easy to make, even on a weeknight.

I made this as a side dish. Everyone raved!!! The red pepper sauce is a great finishing touch.
