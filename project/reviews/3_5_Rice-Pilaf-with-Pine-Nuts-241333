Holy guacamole -- could this recipe be *any* more insipid? Flavorless; refined-rice-bad-for-you; a recipe for morons who don't care about their health. Yeccchhh.

The proportions are perfect for 4 sides, and it is a terrific basic recipe that can easily be spiced up. I served this with a mustard-glazed pork tenderloin on a bed of roasted apples & onions (search recipes to find this dish - it's great!) I also brined the pork for about 4 hours, so it was very well seasoned. In this case, we didn't mind that the rice was a little bland, as all the flavors together worked very well. If you're using low-sodium broth, be sure to add at least 1/2t of salt to the broth for added flavor. A sprig of thyme adds flavor & can be pulled out easily after cooking.

I used a leek and added some raisins. Definitely toast the nuts! This was exactly what I was looking for and I'll certainly make it again.

Very good and simple recipe. I substituted 1/2 cup of orzo for 1/2 cup of the rice and used toasted slivered almonds as I had no pine nuts on hand. I agree with the other reviewers about the need to toast the nuts as it adds a lovely depth.

I made the pilaf with sauteed onions and garlic. I subbed basmati and orzo for long grain rice. very good with the stuffed chicken!

ack, forgot to add this. it's really important to use a tasty broth or the recipe is far too bland. after trying some that were all-natural and low-sodium, i've found that swanson's is the best.

fantastic dish! easy to make with basic ingredients. i added 1/4 cup orzo to give it some more texture and color. the toasted pine nuts are so nice, i definitely recommend taking the time to toast them. i've made this again and again and now all my friends ask for it when they come over.

Very simple and very good. Toasting the pine nuts is a must!

We fried together with the onion a clove of garlic and the pine nuts. We also used basmati rice which has a nutty flavor

Although my husband and I enjoyed this, we felt it was a little bland. Rice, onions, chicken broth, and pine nuts don't have much flavor! We added lots of black pepper but would consider adding more spices next time.
