The fluffy texture of this muffin is really the seller for me. Didn't have lemons for zest like other reviews said, so I used orange. Also used coconut oil instead of butter (my new thing). Only thing that wash't great was the crumble topping, maybe I did it wrong but it was too much flour... I will use less flour, more butter next time.

Unexceptional. The fact that it's all "top" is great, but the recipe itself did not wow me.

Making these for umpteenth time. This is my favorite recipe to show-off big juicy NJ blueberries. They are always delicious, especially with the addition of lemon zest & cinnamon. I've subbed yogurt for the milk with great results. I've also made these with skim milk and they still get devoured.

Excellent for a home made muffin. Tastes more like a sweet muffin than a commercial one and it's easy to make. My guests always devour them and comment about how good they are. I have made this recipe several times and have also included ground walnuts in the topping. Delicious!

This recipe is wonderful without any changes. I made these guys quite often when my kids were in elementary school. I would mix all dry ingredients and prepare topping and measure out all the liquids the night before. So it took no time to mix and bake them in the morning. I did use the special muffin tops pan. They always came out perfect.

This is a good muffin recipe that can be easily adapted. Like other reviewers, I made muffins with frozen blueberries and added the zest of one lemon. The muffins were not sweet or cake-like, yet not bitter like other muffin recipes I've made. I could smell the rich butter aroma as I took the muffins out of the oven. Yum!

These are the best bluberry muffins. if every bakery and coffee shop used this recipe we would not have to endure the sugary crumbly things that most establishments serve up. I have been making this recipe for years now and they are alwsys devoured. Observe the flour to fruit ratio here: most muffin recipes call for twice the amount of flour, but with these you have only 1.5 cups and so many berries. Amazing!

I took the advice below and added lemon zest, which was lovely. I also added white chocolate chips, and had to stop my husband before he ate the whole batch in one evening. I'll be baking these again, for sure.

Great muffin recipe! We are only two so I halved the recipe, added one lemon zest and baked them in mincemeat tins. Perfect little flying saucer muffin tops. Perfect for those reducing how much they want eat but don't want to deprive themselves of the delights of baking and eating delicious food.

Thanks to the other reviewers like brennenjo who recommended orange zest, pandafish who made it into mini-muffins and to another person who suggested brown sugar on the streusel! It was hit with the people it was given to. :)

Great recipe. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added a tsp of lemon zest and used brown sugar in the streusel topping. Recommend baking a little longer than 20 min - more like 24-28 min.

in the quest for finding the perfect blueberry muffin, i started with this one. when following the measurements exactly i came up with what looks like a cookie dough. so i added more milk. i see how some could see this would be a boring muffin, but i considered your thoughts when preparing, so i added about a tablespoon of orange zest. that was wise. so now i have a quite tasty orange-blueberry strussel muffin i am quite pleased with. i used frozen blueberries and probably used closer to 2 and half cups, singer. next time i will use brown sugar for the topping.

Blueberry muffins usually dont make my top 10 list for baked goodies but these were DELICIOUS. I made them into mini-muffins (baked for 18 minutes) and my bf and I ate almost all of them in one night! They're pretty, super easy, and better than any boxed mix I've made. Per other reviewers' recommendations I added about 1/2 tsp of lemon zest to the batter and some cinnamon to the topping. Don't change anything else because it's perfect! I used drained frozen b-berries and I think they release more juice because the batter turned reeeeally purple (which made me like them even more). If that bothers you, I've heard tossing the berries with a little of flour keeps that from happening. These are definitely a winner, especially when you consider the taste to effort ratio! Make em!

What is not to like about these delicious muffins? The only change I made was to use chocolate chips instead of blueberries. The texture of the muffins are great, and the topping is delicious. Only made 8 muffin tops for me- I guess my pans are bigger than recommended. I would double next time because of that.

These were good, but not outstanding. Other reviewers' idea to add some lemon zest probably would have helped. If I make them again I'll try that.

I made these as muffins, not muffin-tops, and they were fantastic. The butter (as opposed to oil) made for a slightly firmer muffin which helped them hold together well while still being chock full of blueberries.

This recipe is so easy and delicious. I made regular muffins, not the muffin tops and they are wonderful. Rave reviews all around.

There must be a typographical error. The sugar required for both batter and topping is EXCESSIVE. I elected to use even quantities of white and whole wheat flour, and switched out the milk with plain yogurt and a tablespoon of lemon juice. The muffin tops rose beautifully and looked appealing. Regardless of tweaking this recipe, the sugary taste was comparable to 'Captain Crunch Cereal'. Next time I'll reduce the sugar by half.

Rating: 4
I concur with all of the raves. Wonderful recipe. I made as-is except i didn't have hwole milk so I used 1/3 cup skim milk with a little vanilla yogurt for some texture and I didn't have enough blueberries so I used 1/2 blueberries and 1/2 mixed berries. Great texture, love the topper and pretty easy to make! I have to say, the taste is not too sweet but makes a perfect breakfast muffin. Will definitely make these again and again. Oh, and I too made the full sized muffins and had some extra topping and I was LIBERAL with the topping cuz I knew I would love it

Incredible. I made regular muffins vs. just the tops, but still... wow. Best blueberry muffins ever! Only note is that you could cut the ingredients for the streusel topping and still have plenty left over.

I have been looking for "the" blueberry muffin recipe for years and this is it!! I doubled the recipe and cooked them for 25 minutes. This made 12 jumbo muffins. I also added 1 teaspoon of lemon zest for a little zing. These muffins are a home run.

Made this in a 12 square muffin pan 3 X 3 X 1 inch deep, baked as directed and used fresh berries. Cooked a little longer - waited til I could smell they were done - checked with a toothpick around 23 min. Then I read the reviews and waited til the muffins cooled to see what I thought. OMG these are fabulous, all berries, enough sugar to balance the tartness and topped with essentially a crispy pie crust dough. My suggestion is to make these as the recipe states, as muffin tops. Spend the money,less than ten dollars, and buy the right baking pan. The muffins taste great and look great.

Really fluffy and moist muffin IF you really watch and don't overbake. Used 1/2 c. fine cornflour/1 c. all-purpose and upped baking powder to almost 2 and 1/2 t. 18 min in my convection oven for 12 muffins as they continue to bake a little after you pull them out.

I LOVE this recipe. Made it for the first time for my step dad because he loves Seinfeld and blueberries but I have made it many times since. Made it for my boyfriend and I a few weeks ago and between the two of us were not able to finish them all before they went stale. So I chopped up the remaining muffins and made a bread pudding by adding a bit of milk, egg, and vanilla. It turned out wonderful. No sugar was necessary as the muffins had enough.

Rating: 4
This is an excellent basic recipe for blueberry muffins that can be easily tweaked to suit individual tastes. It's simple, quick and delicious! I used more blueberries and all the streusel to make 12 regular muffins. (I might make more streusel the next time!) My husband and I devoured all of them for breakfast.

Rating: 4
OMG - These are delicious AND addictive! I made them with the juice of half a Meyer lemon instead of the vanilla. I also used Trader Joe's frozen wild organic blueberries (drained & thawed.) The whole thing took about 10 minutes to make plus 30 or so to bake (longer than it says.) I didn't have special muffin top pans so I just used a greased sheet cake pan and spread them apart pretty far. Amazing!

This is an amazing recipe! I made regular muffins, and 25 min. was perfect for bake time. I used all the crumble. Fantastic, moist--perfect! Next time I may try blueberries with raspberries like some have done. Sounds amazing.

Rating: 3
I made full muffins, not tops, and I have to say I am under whelmed with the recipe as written. I did substitute lemon extract for vanilla, as I prefer lemon with berries. The amount of topping is obviously for muffin tops, which would produce 24 needing it, instead of 12. So if you are making muffins, you may want to cut the topping recipe by half. At 375 they took longer to bake (around 30 mins) than I had anticipated. After 30 mins I pulled them, though they still did not look done on top. The topping made it difficult to tell when they were done because the tops did not brown, but the bottoms did. I think it is a conveinent recipe to have on hand, certainly one that can be tweaked to each individuals perfection. I like the gluey texture of the batter. When making the toping I suggest grating frozen butter as opposed to "cutting cold butter into little pieces." I am sure I will make this again.... just NOT as it is written.

We loved this recipe. We do not have muffin topper pans so we made them on cookie sheets. The were a bit like scones,but still wonderful! My young girls gobbled them up! I only used half of the topping.

My daughter who has celiac disease was wanting me to try a to make a gluten free blueberry muffin. After the great reviews on this one, I decided to try and modify it to make it gluten free. I used Bob's Red Mill gluten free flour mixed with 3/4 t xantham gum and 1/4 cup ground golden flax seed and made whole muffins (baked for 25 min.). The muffins were very tasty, but the crumb topping tasted very much like flour and very little like a crumb topping. I will try cutting the flour in half next time and see if that doesn't help.

I think that the muffin tops should be baked on a cookie sheet (like woppie pies). That will make them nice and crunchy all over and soft in the middle.

What a great recipe. I made whole muffins, instead of just tops and they were really moist and flavorful. I was concerned with the consistency of the batter first (dense and slightly sticky) but it worked out great. I followed the recipe almost completely (added 3T. heavy cream w/ 1% milk to complete 1/3 cup) and (per other reviews) I added about 1/2 t. or so lemon zest and cinnamon each to crumb topping. I also only used 1 1/4 c. blueberries. I could smell and taste the hint of lemon and cinnamon and it seemed to be just enough to give it an extra something. I used all of the topping and the batter gave me 7 really good sized muffins.

Rating: 4
This was an outstanding use of the blueberries from our farm share. I find most baked goods overly sweet so I reduced the sugar (3/4 cup to a little over 1/2) without affecting the taste or consistency. I was generous with the blueberries and really enjoyed the tartness. Despite the "two part" nature of the recipe, it was quick and easy to prepare. A keeper!

Trusting in epicurious recipes and the ratings on this site, I made these for colleagues at work today and was thrilled. Although I still can't seem to make muffins with rounded tops, these were the best tasting and moistest muffins I've had. Like others, I had too much topping left. I also think it needs a bit more butter to dry ingredient ratio so it's crumblier and crunchier, but definitely not a limiting factor in this recipe. I used frozen/thawed/drained wild blueberries and it was great, and made them in full tins, not tops, and baking time was comparable. Highly recommend and will make these again. And again.

I was looking for a good blueberry muffins recipe and this one got such good reviews, I thought that I would give it a try. The directions say that a regular muffin pan could be used. The recipe was easy as the others have said and the muffins were good - nice and moist and not overly sweet. Nothing exceptional though. There was more than enough topping for the 12 muffins.

These are good as muffin tops (for children) and as regular muffins for a breakfast/brunch. I use vanilla sugar in the topping and don't make the entire amount - just an awful lot. I've used various milks, as suggested by others, and I've added a little creme fraiche - it's impossible to have them come out any way but right! People always eat two and just love them. Absolutely a staple here.

Make these muffins. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and added orange zest and cinnamon to the topping. Used whole wheat "white" flour from Trader Joe's and the texture is outstanding, melt in your mouth. Easy recipe too as you melt the butter instead of creaming it (no mixer). I added a bit of milk to the batter to thin it out to spoon more easily.

I really enjoyed making this but I altered the recipe a little bit. I thought the batter was a little dry so I added about a tablespoon of half and half. I also added a little bit of cinnamon to the topping to add a little bit more flavor.I also used fewer blueberries because I thought 2 cups would be excessive. The result was fantastic and I plan on using this recipe many more times in the future.

I thought this was a wonderful recipe. So easy to follow, and the results were fabulous. Cooking time for 12 full size muffins was about 25 minutes. They came out golden, moist and delicious. I added some orange zest to the topping, and next time I think I will add a little more.

Very good except they need more sugar, and they make better regular muffins not muffin tops.

There flavor was good, however there seemed to be too many blueberries for the amount of batter (and I love lots of blueberries in my muffins). I also had an issue with the topping. When I mixed the topping with my fingers, it was not crumbly... more the consistency of wet dough. Maybe the butter was not cold enough? I ended up not adding the topping. I will try this recipe again with 1 1/2 cups of blueberries.

This recipe is fantastic. I made it with frozen blueberries since they were out of season and in regular muffin pans. They were so delicious I will make this over and over again!

Even i liked them...and i'm not a fan of blueberries! OH and loads of blue berries in every bite! They were wonderful!

Great recipe. I made these in regular muffin tins and baked for only a few minutes longer. I used fat-free milk in place of whole milk since that was all I had on hand. The muffins were very moist - kind of sticky. I only used half of the topping so next time, I will only make half. I don't know how the other reviews doubled the topping. I can't imagine finding a way to get all of that on top of only 12 muffins.

This recipe was GREAT! Very sweet, but very good! I used 1/2 c. Whole wheat flour and 1 cup all -purpose (i might even use more WW next time!) and 1/2 c. blue agave nectar in place of sugar, and frozen blueberries. Definitely a keeper and a little healthier than the original too!

Did not like the topping. Too much flour. Also, had to broil them to get them to brown. The bottoms did not brown, either. My oven is calibrated, I followed the recipe exactly and baked them as per the instructions. I will not make these again. If I could, I would not give this any forks.

I just made these muffins, but decided to improvise a bit because I didn't have any blueberries. I used frozen mango and dried coconut, adding about 1/4 cup coconut and 1/2 cup of diced mango chunks to the mix. I cut the mango into fairly small pieces. I also found the batter to be very dry when I mixed all the ingredients and so I added just a splash of additional milk. This many be because I'm cooking at an altitude of 5000 feet. I also added a bit of oatmeal to the topping. The muffins were fantastic: moist and very fluffy. The mango and coconut gave them a different flavor without being too sweet.

I decided to make these after finding some blueberries in the fridge by chance. All the other ingredients were "staples"...but the combination is SUPERB! Plus since one doesn't need the electric mixer, I was able to make these quietly before my family woke up. It was only the wonderful aroma that gave away the surprise!

Very good, very easy recipe. I also substituted buttermilk (1/3c) as previously suggested. I cut back sugar from 3/4c to 1/2c just because that is my preference (a little less sweet). I was a little short on time so decided not to make the topping for the muffins and they still turned out really yummy! This will be my standard blueberry muffin recipe from now on.

I found this receipe to be delicious! I made a couple of alterations - I used buttermilk as one reviewer suggested, and I also used frozen blueberries. I let the berries defrost a bit before I put them in. They turned out to be delicious! I used regular muffin pans, and only filled them up about halfway or less. I also let them cook for about 5 minutes longer than suggested (but I think my oven is calibrated strangely). Overall, it's one of the best homemade muffins I've ever had, and it rivals those giant muffins you find in a coffeeshop!

This recipe is GREAT, but I agree with other viewers, a little too blueberry- centric. Next time I would use about 1 1/2 cups blueberries. Also used french vanilla coffee creamer in lieu of part of the milk (ran out and it's snowing...don't feel like shoveling!), actually great. Also added sour cream and lemon zest. DELISH.

Like others, I made whole muffins out of this recipe and they turned out great! I baked them an additional 9 minutes to compensate for the large muffins. Also, when making the batter, it appeared dry so I added a few tables spoons of vanilla yogurt (its what I had on hand).

These were nothing special and I'm sorry I wasted my beautiful Maine blueberries that we picked up at a roadside stand on the way back from our trip. I did not have a muffin top pan so I followed the advice of other reviewers, following the recipe but baking a little longer. The were not dry but just blah...I think the topping is a winner, though. So, I will try another recipe for our remaining berries and keep the crumb topping.

Overall, good flavor and texture. I would definitely make again, but only as muffin tops. For this review, I doubled the batter recipe and reduced the blueberry quantity by half. I used mini and whole muffin tins, because I didn't have muffin top tins. The bottom portion of the muffins appeared and tasted plain and ordinary. The muffin tops, were wonderful, even though I didn't use all the toping. I didn't reduce the amount of sugar. These were a bit too sweet. My blueberies were at their peak, making them very sweet. Next time I'll modify the sugar accordingly, reduce the blueberries by a third, mascerate some of them into the batter and use all the topping along with a bit of oats for additional texture.

I've made these muffins about a half a dozen times- always with mini muffin tins and yielding great results. Often I add a little lemon zest to the topping and the batter to brighten them up a bit. You do need to cram the topping on the batter to make it stick- but it's worth the effort!

Delicious! I've been making the same blueberry muffin recipe for almost 20 years and decided to give this one a try. This is my family's new favorite.

Rating is based on recipe as is. However, the 2nd time I made I made several changes and it was still good. Used 1/3 c soy flour, 2/3 c cake flour, 1/2 c white wheat, 1/4 c sugar and 1/4 c xylitol, mixed wet and dry separately stored in fridge overnight then mixed, added 1/4 c lowfat milk. For the topping I doubled it and used cream cheese instead of butter. Baked at 350 for about 40 min since I made large whole muffins. Still worked - very forgiving recipe!

These are delicious - I used 1% milk as that is what I had on hand and blueberries I had frozen from this summer. I did have to cook them for an extra 9 minutes - probably because I made whole muffins. The batter is quite thick and I had a little trouble getting the topping to stay on top of the muffin mix which ended up being in stiff peaks in the pan. Next time I will squish the batter into the cup to get as much topping to stay on top as possible. A keeper for sure.

Fantastic!! These transcend ordinary muffins... you could serve them as a dessert for a party!! I've made these as is. I've also made them as regular muffins (I lined them with paper liners).

I made this exactly as the recipe dictates, minus the topping, and while I had reservations about the thickness of the resulting batter, it turned out to be just fine. Suggestion, though: double the batter for the amount of blueberries called for. I say this despite being a fanatic about muffins having enough berries (and clam chowder having enough clams, etc). There ended up being almost no muffin in relation to the pockets of blueberries.

I made this recipe when it first appeared in Gourmet in 2000 and loved it. I used an antique muffin top pan which is the key, I think. I loaned the pan to someone, can't remember who, so now will have to improvise to get the flat muffins.

This is the recipe I've been looking for... moist, sweet, full of blueberries and with a crunchy top. I followed the recipe to the letter but had only a regular pan and blueberries which I froze from fresh last week. Worked well with both changes. This made 12 smallish regular muffins, baked about 25-27 minutes. Really delish!! By the way, in my husband's family the topping is called "rivel" and is used often to top sweet baked goods.

These muffins are divine. They have just the right amount of sugar and are so moist. The recipe went smoothly and I followed everything except the pan. I opted to use a mini-muffin pan and the results were fabulous. The muffins are now the perfect size to snack on. The only isssue with the recipe was the blueberries. I used 2 cups of blueberries but that was only an 8 oz package, so I had a whole package of extra blueberries. These are the best muffins ever- do try them!!!!!!!

Terrible! I made this recipe as written, with the exception of making them as mini muffins and adding some grated lemon peel and some flavored sugar crystals in addition to the topping in the recipe. The "stumps" were lacking in sugar and flavor (thank goodness for the abundant blueberries), and the tops had a predominant flavor of flour (the main ingredient). And, the topping mostly fell off. I would not even give these muffins one fork, if the system allowed that. I recently bought some fabulous raspberry and chocolate muffins and blueberry muffins at Norman Love's in Fort Myers. Will search for a better recipe.

This recipe is fabulous! The topping was a bit difficult to sprinkle, though, as the butter started melting a bit. Next time, I would probably do the topping ahead, using a hand mixer, instead of my fingers and will refrigerate them for a bit -- a trick I picked up from the apple crumb pie recipe. I cut down on the sugar, using just 1/2 a cup, but used cream instead of milk since I didn't have any. Baking time was about 25 minutes. Mighty tasty and worth all the calories!

If I could give this muffin five forks I would. Instead of tops - I made jumbo muffins. This recipe is outstanding.

Simply the best berry muffin recipe! Tender, moist, sweet, scrumptious. This is the way a berry muffin should be, whole or tops. For reduced fat & sugar, I substituted 1 TBSP egg white for the large yolk, used 1% milk, used Splenda with an additional TBSP of sugar, added 2 tsp lemon zest, & I used the crumb topping from Martha Stewart's Blueberry Crisp. A keeper!

Moist inside, nice crunch on top. Good texture - not 'floury' or 'pasty' tasting. I planned on 'test tasting' only one, but have eaten two so far and only strong will power keeps me from the third one.

I have made this recipe several times now. About 6 years ago we were shopping and saw the "muffin top" pan. We bought it for our home as kind of a joke because we are both Seinfeld fans. Then, I saw the recipe in Gormet Mag. Of course we had to make it! They are great muffins. My copy of this mag is dogeared from all of the great recipes, particularly this one! Yummy.

These muffins were probably the best I have ever had...A co-worker of mine rated these as "thats how a blueberry muffin should taste". Of course I did not make the muffin tops, but why would you want to? These muffins are so fluffy and you can controll how much crumble you put on the top.

Great muffins- although I didn;t get muffin top tins. I agree with "Seinfeld"s Elaine- you have to make the whole muffin, then "pop the top, dump the stump". The flavor isn't quite the same. Nice, moist muffins with an unbelieveable topping. This one made my personal recipe book.

I used the recipe to make muffins and they were fantastic. My boyfriend enjoys blueberry muffins and said that these were the best he has ever had. Then again he may just be sucking up to the cook :)

Very delicious muffin tops. Some reviewers were saying that there was too much crumb topping, but if using the muffin top pans to bake your muffin tops, about a tablespoon of crumb topping goes over each muffin. I was unable to put two muffin top pans side by side on the upper-third rack so I had to put one pan on the middle rack and one on the upper-third rack. The muffin tops baking on the middle rack had a more crispier bottom, which tastes pretty good (like a crust). Next time, I will rotate pans so all the bottoms will bake more evenely. Overall, delicious muffin tops.

I've already made these twice in the last 3 weeks. Very moist and extremely tasty. I absolutely love butter, so I brushed a little more on top which also helped with the browning and gave the topping a little extra crunch.

I think these are the ones-- making it to my permanent muffin recipe collection. Pantry dictated the use of buttermilk, less sugar, and some ground oats in place of 1/2 c flour. Also used fewer berries. Awesome!

Unbelievable. I took the advice of many and substituted the crumb topping with brown sugar and cinnamon ( I pressed down lightly with the palm of my hand) made a great crunchy topping. I also used regular muffin pans, stumps were just as delicious. Will definately make again.

Quick, easy, yummy. I make six big muffins and bake 1/2 hour. I usually double the batch. Often make extra muffin mix to save and just add liquids later.

i made the full size muffins with the topping. i may try just sugar and cinnamon on top next time, it will be less messy and taste better that way. i used buttermilk instead of whole milk and they were still good. i think i will try with cupcake liners because all the berries in it made them tricky to remove from the pan in one piece. i wouldn't dream of putting less berries in it.

I made them as mini muffins. They didn't have a good flavor. The "tops" are ok, but nothing special. I wouldn't make them again. The only redeming part was the crumble on the top.

Wow! Quick and easy muffins that are delicious! No more boxed muffins for me! After reading the reviews, I decided to be lazy and skip the topping, opting for a heaping amount of granulated sugar instead. My muffins cooked for 21 minutes at 365 (heat lowered due to using a dark nonstick muffin pan). A single recipe made 12 muffins in 1/2 cup muffin cups, more than enough for my small family -- although two muffins have disappeared already!

Quick and easy, however a bit too sweet. I would definately cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup. I also agree with other reviews about the topping, it really adds nothing to the muffin. Perhaps use a different ratio to create that crumbly effect. I added coconut and sliced almonds to half just for fun. I will try these again.

My kids love this recipe (and we have difficulty pleasing everyone, usually.) I get 12 regular size muffins from this recipe; we sprinkle extra sugar on top of each muffin for extra crunch. Excellent!

Did anyone have trouble with the muffin tops burning? I placed my rack in the upper third of the oven and they started burning when I checked in on them after 12 minutes of cooking. I was surprised to hear that some people had to cook them longer than the 18 to 20 minutes stated in the recipe. Mine were never brown on top because they would start to burn on the bottom. Please let me know if anyone else has this problem.

So easy, so delicious, so perfect. Do these as full muffins, mini-muffins or muffin tops -- all are great. Just be sure to adjust baking time to baking tin. YUM!

Yum! I made these as muffins. The one thing I would say is that if you're making the muffins, not just the tops, you'll need to extend the baking time quite a bit. I forgot that they were in the oven and left them in w-a-a-a-y too long, and they came out perfect. I, too, sprinkled with sugar and that worked out really well.

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe adapted just to make muffin tops. The only thing I have changed in my encore efforts is to eliminate the topping in favor of a sprinkling of cinnamon/sugar on top. The original topping ended up after baking as a dusting of flour, looking and tasting a bit weird. Otherwise, fantastic!

Very good. I made full muffins rather than just "tops" and they were delicious!

These muffins have become a Saturday morning stable in our house. Once my mother-in-law bought me the pan and we gave them a try we were hooked. My husband likes them even better when I substitute a third of the flour with corn flour for a bit of crunch.

This recipe was quick and easy and the muffins were delicious. The batter is just sweet enough and the berries make for a nice contrast. I used frozen blues instead of fresh, didn't have vanilla and didn't make the topping -- and they were still wonderful. I did have to bake them about 5 minutes more than the recipe called for, though, and next time I may use a bit less than 2 cups of berries. I'll absolutely make these again.

Recipe was excellent. Muffin tops are best served the day they are made. I agree with other reviewers - topping recipe made TOO much topping. I used one recipe's worth of topping for 2 batches. Would cut the topping in half next time and might even add cinnamon to the topping. I used frozed wild blueberries and they worked just as well as fresh.

Made these in regular muffin tins- u do end up with too much topping. Did the topping with brown sugar instead of white and added 1 t or so of cinnamon- made the muffins with cranberries instead of blueberries. They are great!

This is a blueberry muffin recipe sent down from heaven by the Blueberry Muffin Gods. They are delicious and everyone that eats them loves them. They are fine baked in muffin tins of all shapes and sizes but you obviously have to adjust baking time. Please make these muffins because they will definately add a happy moment to your day.

These were fabulous! I don't have muffin top pans, so I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the batter recipe to make 6 jumbo muffins. I probably baked them for close to 50 minutes. I used nonfat milk to cut down on the fat a bit, and just added two whole eggs. I used a 16 oz. package of frozen blueberries, and it was more than enough. I also halved the amount of topping, since there were half as many muffins. Sweet morning treats that disappeared quickly!

I made this in a loaf pan because I don't have a muffin top pan, or muffin pan, for that matter--I usually use the stand up cups, but they aren't available here and the pans are low quality and very expensive, but I digress. It worked really well as a loaf. I baked it longer, until a tester came out clean. The only change I made was to use buttermilk instead of milk. I'm thinking next time I might try it with yogurt. The crumble on top really gave a professional finish. A keeper!

I too think these are the best blueberry muffins I've ever made. Loved the topping. Did need a few more minutes for medium sized muffins. Also used 2% milk since that's what I had and added all 2 cups of blueberries. They came out light, fluffy and very tender. Even my husband (not a hugh muffin fan) thought they were awesome. A definite keeper.

Rating: 4
after reading all the reviews, here's my take.- i used 2percent milk because thats all i use, no problem, thickness of batter, no problem, i used just under 2 cups of berries, (all i had), no problem, but i put all the batter into one set of muffin top pan, maybe mines just bigger, i don't know they were delicious.

I have made these twice but I used a extra large muffin tin (holds 6 muffins)......just sweet enough!!!

I live in Alaska and I made these with wild blueberries picked growing in the mts. on tundra. These are the first blueberry muffins I have been able to make that aren't tough. This recipe is excellent! I made it exactly as it called for except I sprinkled a dash of cinnamon on the top. I did not throw away the stumps. The only change I would make is to gently pat the crumb topping next time so it adheres better to the tops. A great bakery style blueberry muffin!

Rating: 3
I too doubled the recipe and made whole muffins - I don't object to them at all, especially when homemade! As I don't like my baked goods extremely sweet, I used just one cup sugar. Also didn't have any more vanilla extract so used two packets of German Vanillin Zucker that I had left from my last trip abroad...I think the muffins are really enhanced by the egg yolks, which also give them a lovely hue. The batter was very thick so I just added a tad of extra milk. Also baked them an additional 3 or 5 minutes than the muffin tops directions call for. These are the best blueberry muffin recipe I've ever made!

Rating: 3
Thought this was a great muffin recipe. One piece of advice: if you're making whole muffins (with the stumps) you only need half (or less) of the topping since there are less "tops" for the topping.

Fantastic!! I also doubled the recipe and made these as regular muffins. I rolled my fresh blueberries in flour to make sure they didn't sink to the bottom. YUMMY.

Rating: 4
Wow! Yum! These were great! I doubled the recipe for "full size" muffins (not just tops) and actually used 2x the blueberries called for (they're in season right now and YUMMY). Since they were so full of blues, they turned out more like individual "crumbles" rather than muffins, but we didn't mind eating 'em with a fork and topping with vanilla ice cream... this is the best blueberry muffin recipe I've come across!

This is a good, easy recipe. If you're going to substitute ( margarine for butter, etc. ) you are not following the recipe and shouldn't review it. Your results will obviously differ.

Good, not great. I read about the thickness of batter, but stuck with the original recipe (as I try to do the first time I make anything). The thickness made it really hard to evenly distribute the blueberries in the batter. The result was pretty good, but I prefer a lighter fluffier muffin. Also I would thin out the batter with some milk or cream next time (shoulda listened to others!), as it would ensure a moister muffin all around (and not just in parts where a few blueberries had gathered.) BTW, I disagree with those who think there are too many blueberries in the muffin- I think they are the highlight of this muffin. Perhaps reduce them only if yours are not in season or sweet.

I made it as a cake instead of muffins and used frozen mixed berries in lue of the fresh ones. Came out delicious!

I gave these muffins 4 forks because everyone who tried them that morning thought they were the best blueberry muffins they had ever had. I followed the recipe to the tee and I thought the batter was far to thick - but stuck with it anyway. They baked up just great. I made them in a regular muffin pan and the batter made enough for nine big muffins which took about twice as long as the recipe calls with the tops. The last five minutes they puffed and browned up so nicely. They looked like they came from a gourmet bakery. The topping makes them sweet and crunchy. I used about a cup and a half of fresh blueberries. My husband keeps asking me when I'm going to make them again...

Surprisingly good, considering I thought these would be a dud because the batter looked way too thick/dry (I added a little extra milk to give it a little more batter-like consistency in the end). Makes a kind of cupcake-like muffin -- I did not do it as "tops" -- very tasty!

This is THE best blueberry muffin recipe. I made these in the Flexipan Tartlet Tray (www.gourmetbetty.com) and they were the perfect size to fill all 12 'muffin tops'. When I first added the blueberries (I used frozen), I thought it was too much, but it ended up being perfect. - Very moist muffin. My husband loves the taste and thought it was the pefect size too. Thank you Gourmet.

Sorry, These are not real "muffin tops." These are just really short muffins. A real muffin top has to have the jagged, exposed underside. Also, this wrongly absolves one of the guilt (a.k.a. pleasure) of knowing that you are wasting half of a perfectly good muffin just to satisfy your own personal muffin-lust. Where's the fun in that?

I really liked this recipe. The topping is great. Of course if you are going to make only 1/2 of the regular amount of items (12 muffins instead of 24 muffin tops) you should use only half of the topping recipe. I think they keep fairly well too but everyone at home kept taking one with them whenever they went out that they were finished in no time.

Rating: 3
This recipe is light and buttery. The topping offers a crisp contrast to the soft cake of the muffin tops. I made these in a Madeline pan for 12. It worked really well and saved me from either buying an absurdly specialized muffin top pan or missing the point of muffin tops by using a standard muffin tin. They came out in a oblong shape on top with a soft, ribbed belly on the underside. I too found the topping portions to be too much. I made 2/3 of the amount specified and still had too much. One-half should be plenty.

This recipe is great...very tasty!Don't use less blueberries in this recipe! May I suggest that you mash 1 cup of blueberries and mix into the batter. Fold in remaining 1 cup of whole blueberries. I have a muffin top pan and I love it!

Rating: 3
I agree with the previous reviewer, too many blueberries. I made mine as regular muffins because I don't have a muffin top pan, who does? My suggestion would be to double the batter recipe, not halve the blueberries (unless you only want to make six regular muffins.) This way you'll still make a dozen regular muffins. About the crumb topping...yes, there was a lot. However, as the muffin bakes, it spreads out and absorbs a little, so I think the amount is appropriate, especially if you're making muffin tops which will yield more muffins, thus more tops to top! Other than that, it's a great basic recipe. Truly delicious!

Rating: 3
Delicious! I made these as whole muffins and they were great- so easy to make. The only things i would change are: halve the blueberries (there were just too many in each muffin!), and halve the amount of flour in the topping. Make SURE the butter in the topping is cold or else it won't stay as bits. It will all blend together in a lump. Will definetly make again!
