I took the suggestions from other reviewers and increased the garlic, used chicken stock, onions and added cumin. Thought that it might be improved by the addition of semi-ripe plantain... finished with a capfull of tequilla. Yum!

Nice, clean taste! I used water rather than stock (although I'll try using stock next time). Our household likes extra spicy, so I used two jalapeño peppers (what I had on hand), and we found it to be a good level of spice. This was the first time I had prepared chayote, and the sap made my skin shiny and tight and severely dried out my hands. I was alarmed at first until a few quick Internet searches suggested that this is a common experience! Gloves would be a good idea. Any other suggestions to avoid the drying of the skin? The soup is delicious enough to endure the peeling hands regardless!

I was surprised at how much flavor this had, actually. I have never cooked anything with chayotes before, and I had no problem pitting them with a paring knife. I used a jalapeno instead of the serrano chile, then added extra garlic, chix bouillon and some cumin. Very good, and it tastes more rich than one would think. It would be an excellent addition to any Mexican-style meal.

This soup was fantastic. Seems like most of the reviewers are finding it too bland--I did not find that to be the case at all, and I used a water base. I pretty much stuck to the recipe--do not skimp on the serrano chile, garlic, and salt. Next time I'm going to strain it, because I ended up with too much tough fiber from the chayote.

I served this soup as the main course this evening accompanied only by honey wheat bread. My family likes very spicy foods, so the recipe was a bit bland for us. I increased the garlic to 3 medium sized cloves, and used half a medium sized yellow onion in place of the scallions. I used a tablespoon of low salt chicken bouillon in place of the salt, and added a hefty teaspoon of chile chipotle, and a tablespoon of oregano, as well as several fresh red sweet chiles. I mashed the soup with a potato masher instead of putting it in the blender. It looked very Christmasy with the red peppers among the green chayotes.

This soup was a bit too bland tasting for me, even with the background flavor of the hot chili (I used Serrano). I added some freshly ground black pepper, which helped a little. It'd be a nice soup to have in a small quantity to accompany a more boldly flavored entree.

I always wondered what to do with chayotes. This soup is very different and quite tasty. Great for a light meal.

I would definitely recommend using chicken or vegetable stock. Even with these options, I found the soup mild. Also be sure to get every bit of the pit out of the chayote, lest you get annoying fibers in your soup.

Quite good. I had some fresh chayote given to me and was looking for a way to prepare them. I'm not a huge fan of cilantro, but it blended in nicely and I liked the kick that the chiles gave the soup.

The soup has a lovely flavor BUT, to add to the previous comments, needs to be made with a chicken or veggie stock.

I went with the suggestion of cumin and added a bit of fresh ground black pepper. I made a bit of Spanish rice (rice, onions and tomotaes sauted in olive oil until golden then cooked like normal rice) and threw a scoop in the middle of each bowl. Pretty presentation and great delicate flavor.

Used 1/2 habanero pepper (it's what I had on hand) and chicken broth instead of water. Excellent, and even better the next day. The habanero gave it just the right punch!

Chayote is an extremely bland vegetable whose charm is that it tends to absorb the flavors of the foods it's cooked with. This soup recipe needs to be based on a vegetable or meat broth, not water. It's impossible that this could have enough flavor without it.

Meeds more punch as it is a little bland. Maybe a little cumin? New e-mail lanbar@hotmac.com
