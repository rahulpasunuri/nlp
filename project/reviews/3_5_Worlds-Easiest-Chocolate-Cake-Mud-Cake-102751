Made this cake for my husband's birthday yesterday and it was a big hit! I took a risk and made it in a bundt pan - glad I did as the shape was gorgeous and the cake came out just fine and the guests loved the sugary/crunchy outside and extremely moist inside. Dusted with powdered sugar and decorated the edges with halved strawberries. Adjustments to recipe: made in bundt pan (well buttered, floured and knocked out excess flour), baked at 275 for for 75 mins and cooled in pan for 15 mins before turning out onto cake plate. Used one shot of espresso and added water to make 1.5 cups of coffee - next time will use 2 shots as the coffee flavor was not very strong. Used Maker's Mark bourbon and didn't notice the alcohol flavor too strongly - just came out caremalized tasting and delicious!

This cake has a few things going for it: It's dense, rich, and perfectly moist, just as a chocolate cake should be. The sweetness is right on target for an adult's chocolate cake (that is to say, it's not cloyingly sweet). It's really easy to pull together, with ingredients that you probably have laying around already. However, the flavors didn't quite come together for me. For me, it needed a stronger chocolate flavor to balance out the bourbon. Maybe some cocoa powder? Waiting a couple days definitely helps, but I would need to make a couple serious tweaks to the flavor profile of this to make it again. That said, I would make it again with those changes in mind.

Extremely easy to make. Well, am not sure if it's world's easiest to make, but it was easy. I halved the recipe and make just 1 layer, baked up nicely. 275F (or 130C) for 55 minutes like suggested by "A Cook from Boston". I ate it with icing and serve it to 5 people, gone in one sitting.

Here's my feedback: EASE: The easiest cakes use cocoa powder and vegetable oil. By no means is this cake difficult, but it's not the easiest ever. TASTE: I used Amaretto. The cake tasted better second day. TEXTURE: Like some other reviewers (e.g., the one from Portland, ME) I found this cake to be "crummie;" it kind of disintegrated when we cut it. Maybe it should be refrigerated?? My cake did not have a brownie-like consistency. It was just a crumbly cake. PAN: I used 7" springform pan, and my cake sank noticeably in the center. So maybe a bundt pan would have eliminated this problem. There are better recipes out there; I won't make this again.

We had this a few hours after I had made it ... it was good,but not great - HOWEVER, this is a cake that gets better with age! After 2-3 days, the coffee mellowed and melded with the intense alcohol and bittersweet chocolate flavors and it was still very moist and fudgy. It was great with chocolate ganache. I also didn't have bourban and used Alberta Springs whiskey. Definitely a keeper and pretty easy to mke.

An amazing recipe, even if misnamed. I used Kahlua instead of bourbon and really enjoyed the undertone. I used Hershey baking chocolate and Ghirardelli Semi-Sweet Morsels, and it is the perfect balance of sweet and bitter. I used a Bundt pan, and needed to let it cook at 275 degrees for an hour and 35 minutes. I turned off the oven and allowed the cake to to rest in the oven for half an hour after delicately using a knife to peal the sides away from the pan. Thia allowed the very moist cake to have the sides dry out a little so it could be removed from the Bundt pan all in one piece. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar and served with Breyer's Black Raspberry Chocolate ice cream and coffee. Great combo for a birthday cake for someone who doesn't like desserts that are too sweet.

This cake is absolutely fabulous. Its rich, dense, moist, just delicious. I made the recipe as written, except I used a regular cake pan instead of a springform pan. It came out easily. I just used whipped cream and raspberries to decorate. My four-year-old and my husband loved it.

Rating: 4
Great, easy cake. I followed the recipe as written but had to use one 9" springform pan and one 8" springform pan. I put 3 2/3 cup of batter in the 9" pan and remainder in 8" pan. Baked at 275 for 1 hour and they both came out perfectly. Very moist and I did not have the crumb problem others mentioned. Great with homemade whipped cream.

I made this for my business partner's birthday and she is a connoiseur of chocolate cakes. She loved it so much she asked if she could pay me to make it for her in the future. I used chocolate ganache from another recipe as icing. For visual interest I used a layer of some vanilla betty crocker frosting under the middle layer of ganache so that when the cake was cut there was a stripe of white below the ganache in the middle.

So delicious! And so easy. I always have all the ingredients. I just use all bittersweet chocolate (52%) and bake in one 10" springform about 80 minutes.

Really great easy cake--particularly if you have any experience at all making an unfrosted single-layer French chocolate cake. I cut the recipe in half, and used a 9" springform for 55 minutes at 275 degrees. Reversed proportions of bittersweet and unsweetened chocolates (Ghirardelli). Used Maker's Mark bourbon. Came out great. Nice and moist. The person who had trouble with a dry cake defintely shouldn't have used a bundt pan.

Yes yes yes. Easy _and_ interesting?! This is a total keeper. Melt stuff in saucepan. Stir dry ingredients into saucepan. Voila. Batter. Pour into springforms. You're finished. The cake was _plenty_ moist (note that the people who are complaining about lack of moistness are the ones who baked the cake in a bundt pan instead of 2 springforms -- I love it when people don't follow a recipe and then complain that it didn't work!).The coffee and bourbon flavors work gorgeously together and are very subtle, and my favorite thing about this cake is that it's incredibly chocolate-y without being too sweet. I used high quality bourbon, coffee, and chocolate, and the cake was absolutely excellent. A big hit with our party goers last night. Served with freshly whipped cream and berries.

After reading all the comments, I expected this cake to be super moist. It just wasn't! I baked it in a bundt pan for one hour at 275. I didn't have any trouble getting it out of the pan, but I had greased and floured quite heavily, based on other comments. It has a nice texture, and an ok chocolate flavor. I did use high quality 72% chocolate, and good bourbon. I was a little disappointed in both the flavor and the moistness. Also, I didn't think it was much easier than a standard cake to put together. I'll probably stick with a 1,2,3,4 for my basic cake.

This was fairly easy and very good. I used Ghiradelli chocolates, decaf espresso (watered down with 1/4 cup water), and amaretto for the liquor, baked in a bundt pan. I turned it out too early and a good part of it stuck to the pan (so I flipped the cake and it looked fine), which allowed me to taste it when warm. The flavor of coffee was overwhelming (I do NOT like coffee). However, after refrigerating it overnight, the coffee flavor was virtually absent the next day. The amaretto flavor never really came through, though. Overall, the texture was fine (moist yet it fell apart in chunks when sliced), the flavor was deeply chocolatey and my book club raved.

This is a keeper! I am not a baker, but I definitely will be making this again and again! I was making cupcakes, so I was a bit anxious about the cook time, but 20 minutes at 350 was perfect. I only had rum on hand, and used Valhrona 71% for both types of chocolates, and halved the sugar as I always do....they were perfection, even without a topping. I will find an excuse to make cake soon!

Eh. Sure, it's easy, but even with really nice chocolate you can't hide the fact that it tastes like a brownie. Next time I want a chocolate cake, I'd rather wash an extra bowl or two and have something to oh and ah over.

I make this cake everytime I have extra leftover coffee. It is fantastic! I use Old Crow Bourbon and add chocolate chips (Ghirardelli bittersweet are best) and toasted chopped pecans. Really easy and delicious.

This recipe is truly easy to make. One only needs one pot to make it in. I only baked it for an hour and it was done. As the cake started to cool-off, it started to crack. By the time I assembled the cake, I was transfering chuncks of cake onto my cake platter. As I was trying to frost it, the bottom layer seemed to be easier to work with cause it was more manageable with only a big crack down the center, but the top layer, well it totally fell apart. I couldn't even spread the frosting on top, and it was impossible to do on the sides. I made this for my son's 22nd birthday celebration. It is the most ugliest cake I have ever placed in front of anyone. It is moist, but so what, it looks like a 2 year old had a field day in it. My 11 year old said I should call this cake "crummie cake" cause it looks like a lot of crumbs...won't make this again...

I made this for my fiance's b-day and she literally drooled when she tasted it for the first time. I'm a self proclaimed snob on chocolate cake and this one is beyond all others. The use of fine chocolate is the key along with using a great bourbon such as (shameless plug) Makers Mark. I will most definitely make this cake again.

This cake was easy and delicious! I was able to make the cake in University dorms with barely any cooking utensils- a coffee mug works as a 1 cup measure- which says a lot about the prep of this cake! Easy, but an absolute winner for traditional birthday cake with butter-vanilla frosting- what could be better for someone's 21st??

I don't understand the 90% rating on this cake. It doesn't taste that great and was quite crumbly (meaning I couldn't slice a nice piece). I stayed up late to make it for dinner guests tomorrow, I'm planning on making something else in the morning.

My husband loves good chocolate. Every year I try a different recipe for his birthday. This was, by far, the best ever. I'll never try another. Although, I don't know if I'd call it "easy." Great with a semi-sweet ganache and some rose petals for decoration.

Cake had a great flavor; the bourbon was great but next time will increase the amount for a stronger flavor. It's a heavy cake, so a little goes a long way. Topped the cake with ganache and mousse for a great dessert for my daughter's 21st b-day!

This cake was good, but not great. It was moist, but not as moist as I would've liked it. There wasn't anything wrong with it, it just wasn't the fantastic chocolate cake recipe that I'm always looking for but can never find. It was just a very standard cake - nothing special. I have other recipes that I like better, and that are simpler. Although this was by no means a difficult cake to make, it wasn't the easiest cake I've ever made (mainly due to the fact that it involves wax paper and chopping chocolate) and bourbon isn't an ingredient that I typically have on hand. Overall, not a bad cake, but not fantastic.

If you like the taste of dark chocolate, this recipe is fantastic! It's very easy to make -- as the title promises -- and it comes out very rich. I've served it a couple times and both times I've received plenty of compliments on the cake's moistness. Like the other reviewers, I didn't use two cake pans, but consolidated all the batter into one bundt pan.

This cake was absolutely wonderful! And very easy to make. Instead of making two cakes I made one big one and it came out perfect. I sprinkled powdered sugar on top, and each piece put a dollop of homemade whip cream accompanied with raspberries and blueberries. I will definitely make this again in the future!

This was lovely, and I made it extra sinful by serving with dark chocolate ganache instead of the sweetened whipped cream. Yummy.

To the SanFran Cook who had flat, dry results: you can't just half the recipe because the amount of baking soda you need will not be proportionate. Also, you used an 8.5 inch pan which contributed to the failure. That half inch might not seem material but adds more volume than you might think. I would say, try it again, this time following directions.

Rating: 4
Mmmmm Delicious! I used "Chocolove" brand Rich Dark 65% chocolate for the bittersweet and added just the right amount of creamy richness. I made it for a birthday cake with two 9" cake pans - baked for just an hour. I put whip cream between the layers and a little confectioners sugar on top with some berries around the rim of the cake. It didn't even need any ice cream!

I made this cake for my daughter's first birthday (skipped the liquor.....it was still fabulous) and baked it in a bundt pan. She loved the cake, as did the adults. I used Scharfenberger chocolate and the taste of the cake was terrific. I've baked chocolate cake from scratch for many years and this beats most other recipes in terms of ease and taste. Will try an "adult" version sometime ^_^

I've tried many chocolate cake recipes over the years but this one, well, takes the cake (sorry!). Just what a chocolate cake should be. It is, as others have mentioned, REALLY easy to make. Warm out of the oven it was moist and light and very chocolately...delicious with whipped cream (no sugar needed I think) and raspberries. After a night in the fridge it got denser, but was still yummy, and the alcohol flavor showed through a bit more (I used whiskey rather than bourbon). In both states it was scarfed up by adults and children alike. Oh yeah, like others, I used a single bundt pan, rather than two eight-inchers.

Rating: 4
This was easy and wonderful, very chocolaty and rich. I substituted amaretto for the bourbon and used a bundt pan, but otherwise followed the recipe. The result was delicious, almost brownie-like in consistency. I served it with some whipped cream and lovely strawberries, but it certainly could have stood on its own. I've never made a cake from a box so can't compare whether this is better or worse, but it's certainly a winner in my book.

Rating: 3
Rather than using two 8-inch pans for the cakes, I used 10-inch ones. Before serving, I layered the thin cakes with a filling of whipped cream in between and a layer of cream and mixed berries on top. It looked festive and tasted great. (I also cut half a cup of sugar from the recipe with good results). After a night in the refrigerator, the cake was dense, moist and delicious, with the berries' flavors melding in beautifully.

Wow - not only was this cake fantastic, but it was fun and easy to make (just like the title promises). Rich and delicious - I used Scharfenberger chocolate for a fabulous taste (best American chocolate, in my opinion). When it was done, I decorated it with strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries - then drizzled it with chocolate and served it with fresh whipped cream. Everybody was amazed, as it was so beautiful and delicious! I'll definitely keep this recipe on file. Thanks.

I agree--this is an easy cake. But, it's also delicious, and it looks elegant when served with the raspberries and whipped cream. I also love that the recipe makes two cakes--perfect during the holidays, when there's a good chance of having back-to-back events that require you to bring something!

Yes I would make it again and, in fact, I have. Unfortunately I did not have vanille or bourbon so I substituted almond extract and vodka. The only problem I had is that I had a hard time not eating the batter before I baked it.

The liquor gives the flavor of this cake an interesting undertone. I know this is "mud" cake and all, but the consistency very much reminded me of a Duncan Hines chocolate cake. Yes it is light and fluffy and that is exactly why I am reminded of store bought. This cake is not a good value, especially if you are going to use expensive chocolate.

This cake was absolutely great. I made it for only my boyfriend and I, so I halved the recipe, baked it for about 40 mins, and it turned out perfect. I topped it with a warm chocolate, sour cream and honey ganache, then let it firm up in the fridge before serving. Would be perfect with a few sliced strawberries on the side to cut the richness. Would maybe add a bit less booze next time. Thumbs up!

I made this cake in a bundt pan and after an hour of baking time it was still liquid in the middle so I turned the oven off and left in for another hour. This cake was so moist it doesn't need icing, not even a dusting of confectioners sugar. It was a hit all by itself, this recipe goes in my recipe box. clean up was a breeze.

This is a rich, moist (VERY moist) cake. I made it in 2 layers with whipped cream in the middle and a choclate/sour cream ganache. Next time I will do it bunt cake style and only sprinkle powdered sugar on top because it is simply too rich. It keeps very well in the fridge, though and the moistness can't be beat. The oven temperature IS correct although it does seem low. I used scotch instead of bourbon with lovely results.

I got excited when I saw this recipe. Wow. World's easiest chocolate cake.

I have made this many times. The cake is so moist and great chocolate taste. The best is it is so easy. Betty Crocker can't match this and it vertually takes the same time. I usually make it in one springform pan and incease the baking time. I have prepared it with a chocolate frosting for a childs birthday party and with a ganache for a more adult taste. Very versitile. I highly recommend it.Keep it at room temperature for the best texture. It gets much firmer in the fridge.

I, too, made this in a bundt pan with a great result. I only had bittersweet chocolate and no bourbon but it was still spectacular. I served it warm with vanilla ice-cream.

I baked this in a bundt pan as was suggusted and it turned out beautiful. It was light and springy to the touch but had almost a brownie-like quality to it.

This was dead easy to make, used semi-sweet chocolate instead of bittersweet, otherwise had all the ingredients on hand already. Made it for a birthday cake, cut up some strawberries and blueberries, soaked them in Chambord for an hour before serving, topped each cake slice with fresh whipped cream and poured the berries with Chambord over the whipped cream and cake, tucked a few mint leaves under the whipped cream - delicious without being too sweet and looked very pretty, too.

My husband loves chocolate and this cake fits the bill for him. I thought it was easy to make. I took the hint from a previous reviewer and prepared the cake in a Bundt pan.

This is an excellent version of Mississippi Mud Cake; I've made it several times and it is pretty simple. It's quite intense, so I reduce the chocolate by an ounce, and I also reduce the sugar to 1-1/2 cups. Importantly, I use a bundt pan dusted with cocoa, making one cake which is much moister--and it still takes the same time in the oven. You can mix the bourbon in with the coffee while you're melting the chocolate if you don't want to taste it as much--but I love that bourbon flavor! Everybody loves this cake...

It was the weirdest thing. I made this cake for a dinner party and served it with Tiramisu, and it barely got a glance. I froze the second cake and later took it to work. It got some of the highest praise that anything I have made has gotten. I am going to try making this again in order to settle the confusion. I tried it only the second day and it was very, very good. I am interested it others trying it.
