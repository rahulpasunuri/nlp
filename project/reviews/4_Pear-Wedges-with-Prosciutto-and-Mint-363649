I DEFINITELY WILL ADD PECORINO CHEESE STAGIONATO .... IT WILL BRING UP THE FLAVORS MAKING IT DIMENSIONAL .....

Crisping the prosciutto in the oven gives this a very nice crunch and deepens the flavour. I put it on a small bed of watercress.

This was a super-easy, elegant, delicious starter to the pork tenderloin we made last night. Skipped the aniseed and didn't miss it. I agree that the better the prosciutto, the less required. We will serve this again and again.

Lovely combination of flavors, a hit with every one at our lunch. Did not have the sherry vinegar, so I adapted by reducing port to syrup consistency and using a champagne vinegar that was in the panty. Would give it 3 1/2 forks if I could.

Easy, pretty and very delicate in flavor. I used imported Martelli's Italian prosciutto which is expensive per lb, but you don't use a lot and the flavor is worth it in a simple dish like this. I also doubled the dressing except the aniseed. Delicious.
