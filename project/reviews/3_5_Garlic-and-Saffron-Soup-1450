Not good at all. I followed the recipe exactly and my husband and I were very disappointed. The soup had a gluey consistency from the cooked and pureed pieces of sourdough bread. The soup was also really tart and difficult to swallow. I would not recommend wasting saffron on this recipe.

Agreed, this is a great and inexpensive recipe. I would only add that the saffron is more effective if you soak it first for half an hour in a few tablespoons of hot water, and then add it with the water.

Have made this a couple of times for friends and family with rave reviews. I have noticed that using sourdough does give it a more unique flavor and have opted to use that over french bread.

This was extraordinarily easy and quite good. I also substituted the sourdough in order to use up the baguette I had bought. It was a tiny bit bitter, even though I steeped the saffron. I'm not sure if the bitterness was intended.

Exactly what I was looking for on this particular evening: a garlic soup without potatoes or eggs. With the saffron, reminiscent of those Provencale fish soups. Used regular French bread, but I'm sure it would have been good with the sourdough too. Just a bit surprised that no one has reviewed this one yet.
