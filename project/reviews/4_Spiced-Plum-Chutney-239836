Wonderful flavor, but this didn't thicken at all. I ended up cooking down the first batch, with some added apple juice (for natural pectin) and then stirring in extra plums and another dose of spices and cooked very gently so that I had pieces of plum in a plum sauce that would not separate on a plate with cheese or in a sandwich. Luckily I had extra fruit.

Really, really good! I did have to adjust the sugar slightly but that's to be expected when cooking with fruit. I also didn't have star anise but had Chinese Five Spice which includes star anise - don't miss out on this flavor - it works so well with the plums. I served this with roast turkey - delicious!

Outstanding. I dry-roasted the spices (adding cardamom pods) before grinding them. I also included 1/4 cup of chopped crystallized ginger. The finished product is a bit more liquid than a commercial chutney, but the flavor and color are first rate. So far, we've enjoyed it with grilled chicken, pork, cheese (brie, manchego), and on pound cake with vanilla ice cream. Good thing we doubled the recipe to can extra!

i didnt have anise or clove, so made it with cumin corriander and cinnamon. found the red wine vinegar quite overpowering so to balance the tartness, caramelised 1/2 a red onion in some honey and then added that to the reduction. de-lish, as in scrump!

What a beautiful finished product. The color is out of this world! I only wish I had more plums...

I had to be flexible with this recepie ... I had plums at home that couldn't be kept any longer, but couldn't get fresh ginger so I used powdered (but I'm sure with fresh it's much better!), also I swoped mustard seeds for ground coriander, it worked really well! Yummmy!

I will make this again but will definitely reduce the pepper to 1/2 teaspoon. The chutney has a wonderful color.

Delicious served with roast pork. I would recommend adding pepper to taste.

nice... made a double-batch and processed in 6-oz jelly jars. Even with the lid off, it never really thickened so I added a bit of pectin, and the texture is still soft but pleasant.

I had an abundance of plums, and this seemed like the perfect fit. I thought it would be good, but it turned out amazing, way better than I expected. I served it over cream cheese with crackers, but pairing it with pork would be delicious as well.
