I made this delicious recipe with whole milk rather than whipping cream and with one thinly sliced apple rather than the wedges of several apples. I cut out the first baking step by cooking the apple slices slowly in the buttered skillet on the stove, while putting together the other ingredients. The cast iron skillet went into the oven hot with the next combination of ingredients. Easy enough and I'll try it again with the apple wedges.

I saw the recipe and thought "wow - I have all of those ingredients in the house". I neglected to read the many steps! Oh well, it kept me awake so I could ring in the new year. I used french bread, as that is what I had leftover from a party. Pre-sliced granny smith apples were also a leftover, but I peeled the slices. I used a large Calphalon saute pan but didn't have a cookie sheet large enough for the diameter, so I skipped that and didn't have any problems. I also used the pan lid instead of foil, which was easier to deal with during the multiple steps. Incredibly yummy, we'll be having it for breakfast this morning too!

Made this on Thanksgiving, and it was absolutely delicious. Instead of using the skillet, I did everything in a glass baking dish. It seemed to work very well. YUM!

eating leftovers as I type this. Warmed in the microwave, and added a bit of cream. Great recipe. Heavy cream isn't necessary, but I did use 1/2 n 1/2. The toffee comes up every now and then for a nice surprise. I should have added as much as the recipe called for.

I made this for friends to serve after supper at a fabulous local restaurant. Everyone said they were too full for dessert, but once they had a taste, they couldn't stop. It was great. Yes, it took a long time to prepare, but the results were worth it.

This was FANTASTIC. People couldn't stop going back for seconds, thirds... Made exactly as written except only had 1/3 cup tart dried cherries so had to use 2/3 cup dried bing (sweet) cherries. Also, had to cook it for 35-45 minutes on the last step to get it brown and make sure the custard was cooked. There are a lot of steps but well worth it. Mine came out exactly like the picture except it did not bubble over the pan.

Really good and very generous-sized portions, but lots of steps.

Wonderful Fall flavors, plenty to share.

This dessert was outrageously good - my guests couldn't stop raving. I couldn't give it 4 forks, however, because of the time and effort involved in the preparation. Although I prepared it exactly as written, there just has to be a way to cut down on 4 separate 20-minute bake times, with multiple steps between each. I will make it again, but will definitely look to consolidate the prep.

This bread pudding has way more steps than any other I've ever made, but it is worth it. I've made this recipe twice now check how much more sugar it needs. I typically use less sugar than called for in most recipies, but thought this one seemed low for the quantity of bread and the tart apples. So the first time I made it exactly as specified and thought it did need more. The second time I nearly doubled the sugar in the custard mixture and added a couple of tablespoons to the caramel mixture. Came out much better tasting the second time around and it still is not overly sweet, which I dislike. As a tip, I suggest lining the cookie sheet/pan placed underneath with foil, so you can dispose of it. The sugared liquids will bubble up and over and harden on the bottom, making for some difficult scrubbing afterward. A lovely, rustic dish, worth trying.
