I found these boring and hard to cook evenly. I added some rosemary to the mix, but they still came out bland. I think I'll stick to regular latkes.

Comment about the introduction: the oppressors were Greek, not Syrian.

It does take some practice to succeed with this recipe, but the result is worth the trouble. I sometimes add some feta to the mixture. And you can always add some flour if the dough is too moist.

Followed directions to the "T", and after hours of prep time, "croquettes" fell apart upon frying/ browning them! very dissapointed!

a nice break from latkes, but, next time I would use corn flake crumbs instead of flour.
