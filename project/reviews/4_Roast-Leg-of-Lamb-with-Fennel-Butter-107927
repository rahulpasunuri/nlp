Wonderful! I was out of soy sauce and substituted worcestershire sauce. I used 6 cups of wine and made a demi-glaze. I also used four 8" branches of fresh rosemary cuz there can never be enough rosemary! My guests were happily stuffed with second helpings - a sure sign of recipe success!

Delicious! 2 people even said that they usually do not like lamb, but loved this recipe. The sauce is what made it. And I did substitute olive oil for the butter.

Very Very Wonderful! To the bane of people who prefer to try recipes unaltered the first time I did make a few pretty minimal choices. I substituted olive oil for the butter as i had people dining who were not able to eat dairy. I ground the fennel, rosemary, and some whole mustard grains with a mortar and pestle. I then added them to the olive oil and fried for a while and put this oil in the little blender to emulsify and further break up the seeds/leaves of the seasonings. I made about 2X the amount as suggested so i could get a really good covering on lamb. I also used sea salt instead of Soy sauce. Timed every thing more or less the same, mostly as an oversight i did the 1st 30minutes with the meat covered, which i would not do next time. turne out wonderful, but i think i would have got an even more wonderful crust on the meat with the entire time uncovered. Also the meat was pretty much cooked all the way through, VERY tendely and beautiful flavoured , but i think having it covered make have cooked it a bit faster than intended. for the reduction, i added a 1/3 cup of farm cream with a few table spoons of corn starch to thicken just a tad. (the dairy-free people had to have meat with out the sauce...) The reduction was ABSOLUTE HEAVEN!!!!! a bit salty, (less sea salt next time, and from scratch broth would have remedied this, but i was short on time so i used commercial veggie broth) Will make this again for sure!!!

I used a 4-lb vaccume-packed New Zealand leg of lamb from Trader Joes to make this for 2 people (with left- overs in mind!) I followed the other reviewers' advice to stick with the recipe and watch the heat. Whomped the fennel and dried rosemary in a blender before adding to the rest of the butter mixture. The butter mix smells terrible, but you won't believe how wonderful it tastes. Stick with the recipe, really. Used sea salt and fresh-ground black pepper to season the meat and browned in a seemingly small amount of olive oil in the roast pan as directed. I live in Phoenix, AZ, where the altitude is about 1,000 feet. Food cooks faster here than at sea- level, so I watch roasting times. This little roast was as oven-seared as I wanted it to be after 10 minutes at 450. Worried about burnining, I watched it carefully at 350 and pulled it out when my meat thermomter reached at 145 degrees--about 30 minutes later. We had a perfectly roasted medium-rare result. So, do watch the heat, especially if your roasting a smaller leg as I was. I used cheap, jug, Chianti to deglaze the pan, along with Swanson's low-sodium chicken broth. Great recipe. Make it. Enjoy!

Made exactly to recipe and this was FANTASTIC! Definitely a keeper.

Technically I used a lamb shoulder roast so I don't know how valuable this review is... But this dish was absolutely the best meat I have ever had the pleasure of putting into my mouth. My roast was 3 lbs and I cooked it for 20 minutes on 425 and 30 on 350. It came out perfectly medium rare. I made the full amount of butter which I think really took it over the edge--put all the dry ingredients and the soy in a blender and it made a really nice fine paste. Halved the sauce ingredients, except again, the butter. The more of that insane butter the better! Served it with polenta and poured the gravy over everything. Best meal I've ever made.

Followed this recipe to a T, but just reduced the time for smaller lamb shanks. If you are a fennel and lamb-lover, then this recipe is for you!

Not great...I picked the wrong red wine (too tanic) and the soy overwhelmed the rest of the ingreds. Great idea to use the coffee grinder to pulverize the dry herbs. Easy enough. Had to "rescue" the wine reduction with 1/4C b'sweet choc chips and a tsp of rasp jam. The Costco lamb was good, tho'.

I made this for Easter on Sunday. I trusted the reviews, and because I enjoy the taste of fennel, I used the 3T. I regret it. The smell and taste are overpowering. The lamb itself was tender and tasty, but it smacked of dessert and not entree in flavor. I recommend you try another recipe.

After making this a few times, I found it was key to grind the fennel (well!), and then measure 3 tbs (in other words, more fennel = good). You've GOT to pair this awesome gravy with mashed potatoes of your choice (I like mine with goat cheese).

Excellent recipe, easy and flavorful would not change a thing. Even the anti lamb people in my family had seconds.

This lamb was PERFECT. I'll definitely make this again without changing a thing - BUT if there isn't any broth on hand, I'd view the chicken broth in the sauce as optional. I'm sure the wine reduced on it's own would be wonderful with the fennel butter.

Delicious. Used a smaller roast, just under 3 lb, so I adjusted the roasting time. It came out beautifully. The sauce is essential -- don't skip it! My husband thought this was amazing.

Fantastic. I used a 3.5lb leg of lamb, halved the recipe for the fennel butter and sauce and cut about 10 min off the roasting time - it was perfectly pink inside. Served with green beans with caramelized shallots also from Epicurious.

Delicious! I used a 4 1/2 lb boned & rolled leg, so cut the recipe in half and cut a few minutes off the timing. It was perfect! My husband kept commenting on "all the little flavors". The blackened bits are savory and wonderful to chew on.

This dish was well worth the effort put into it. The lamb was excellent. I made parmesan asparagus and rosemary mashed potatoes to pair it with. Will cook this again.

Delicious!! I will make this again and again.... I used a spice mill to grind the fennel. The smell of the sauce is divine. A big hit!

VERY TASTY! I used a organic grass fed bone in leg of lamb. I followed the recipe as written, except I crushed the fennel seeds in a mini cuisinart. The fennel butter was lovely with the lamb. A good recipe for company or a special dinner. I served it with Fresh Fennel Scented Mashed Potatoes (also a Epicurious recipe). A definite keeper.

Delicious. Be sure to completely crush the fennel (maybe next time I will put it through the spice grinder) because otherwise the flavors don't integrate as well as they should. Also, next time I will slice the lamb in the kitchen and drizzle some addt'l fennel butter on the slices before serving. The flavor of the butter is phenomenal, but you lose it after you've eaten the edge piece.

Good but make sure all fennel seed are fully crushed for the best possible result.

We absolutely LOVED this recipe. We also used a butterfly cut instead of on-the-bone. The roasting time had to be cut in half. If we had followed the recipe's cooking time, it would have been ruined.

I had a bonless butterflied leg that was rolled and tied. I was unsure of the cooking time but after reading several reviews and other recipes settled on 20 minutes at 450 degress and 30 minutes at 350. Measured temp and put back in for 10 more minutes. Took it out just at 130 degrees. Let it rest 20 minutes and it was perfectly pink. The sauce was really flavorful and easy. My guests all loved it.

The fennel made the difference in this lamb recipe, it was a nice contrast to your typical lamb recipes with rosemary/garlic. I used a much smaller leg of lamb, and cut down the cooking time in half and it still turned out very well.

I live in France part time and made this recipe for some French friends who grew up on Le Gigot d'agneau. They absolutely raved about the lamb! The boucher advised me to roast this 5 lb gigot for only 45 minutes -- no longer! I followed his advise -- 15 minutes at 425 and 30 minutes at 325. It was perfect! Rose!

Amazing lamb! The fennel butter is perfect...I actually ended up not making the sauce (because my pan was not quite heavy enough apparently and scorched making the "brown bits" completely black and unedible) SO I just used the extra fennel butter as the sauce and it was wonderful...I might just do it like that next time and completely eliminate the wine/broth reduction...it was a very special dish -- and there is so much going on that those iffy on fennel might like it anyway!

Wow...where to begin? This dish has earned raving reviews every time I've made it. Definitely took a little more time to cook than indicated in the recipe but fabulous results every time. If you're unsure about the fennel, take a chance and do it.. you won't regret it. One of my most cherished finds on Epicurious.

Delicious! I made this with a butterfly / boneless leg. It was definitely done after the first 30 minutes in the hot oven. Next time I'd probably reduce the cooking time a bit. Didn't have chicken broth, so I used vegetable broth and it was still fantastic. Super easy, wonderful dish.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was excellent. My mother was convinced that not all of our guests would like fennel so she made me leave it out. The red-wine sauce was delicious, even without the fennel, and I would definitely make this again.

I made this for a mothers day lunch and it was enjoyed by all. I did have a problem with the sauce being a little bitter -- I think too fennel-ly. Or maybe it was the wine I used? It was easily fixed with a little sugar. The leftovers were devoured cold. I will probably try other recipes before making this one again, but this one was yummy and got compliments all around.

Wonderful! I made this for my husband in his birthday and he LOVED IT! I made a rice with mint and coriander and Portabella Mushroom with a balsamic and wine sauce. Simply perfect!

This dish was VERY easy to make!!! If you are a spice fanatic like me, I suggest you use less of the fennel seed called for in the recipe. It was too overpowering the first time around. The second time out produced WONDERFUL results. Enjoy :o)

This was SOOO delicious and so easy to prepare. It made the kitchen smell wonderful. I cooked two 2.5 lb boneless legs of lamb and it came out perfectly when cooked as instructed. There were 4 of us for dinner, so I made too much... I could have easily served 6-8 people. It was very, very good and I served it with green beans sauted in butter and garlic, with parsely added just before serving, and rice pilaf. Yummy. You should make this!

I am not a big fan of lamb but, made this as early Easter dinner last Sunday for family and friends. It was easy, cooked well and everyone including myself loved it!

Just made this yesterday for an early Easter dinner for 12. Everybody loved it, and the sauce was delicious. Making the butter in advance made this is an easy recipe, but you need to assign somebody to do the sauce at the last minute while you're tending to the rest of the meal.
