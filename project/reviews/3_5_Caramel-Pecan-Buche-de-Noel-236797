I did not care for the cake part of the buche de Noel. The frosting was delicious but the cake was dry and tasteless. Would not make again.

This was my first time making a yule log so I was a bit nervous. I had some problems with the cake cracking as I rolled it, but it was not too big of an issue as the icing covered it nicely. I made the frosting the day before - make sure you get it fairly soft again before icing - makes it much easier to spread the icing. I also had some problems when we cut into the cake - the frosting separated from the cake so it didn't slice very nicely. These are all just cosmetic issues though. The cake was delicious and got rave reviews. Definitely serve it with the bananas and caramel sauce.

Great Recipe! I only made a few changes - since I only have a stand mixer with one bowl, I whipped the egg whites first and then transfered them to a separate and then mixed the yolk mixture and folded the whites into them instead of vice versa. It worked fine. I also added vanilla to the batter for the cake in addition to the bourbon. I made the cake two days ahead and refrigerated it covered with waxed paper. I let it come to room temperature before serving, and everyone loved it. Very rich and delicious.

A lot of work but totally worth it!

I had never made buche de noel before. This is a great intro recipe -- since I wasn't used to making this dessert, I followed it pretty faithfully. It really wasn't difficult at all, and it came out exceptionally delicious as well as lovely -- everybody in my family loved it. I did pre-roll the cake -- I worried that it would dry too much to roll well if I didn't -- and pre-rolling it worked well. I served it with the bananas and the praline ice cream, and the caramel sauce (as suggested), and I thought that it was best served and eaten that way.

Presentation is everything with this dessert. I went the extra mile and made meringue mushrooms as garnish, really added to the overall look and feel. I made the cake and meringue mushrooms on day one, then made the frosting and assembled on day 2. Was afaid the cake was too bland, but understood the flavor when paired with the icing. Icing benefits from cooling in fridge or outside. Thought it spread beautifully and it was easy to make tree-like lines and swirls. In all, a huge hit, and a nice addition of a traditional dessert to the holiday table. Definitely one for the vault.

This was my first attempt at Buche de Noel and it was a total success! The cake was pretty easy to roll, the frosting set up without any problems and held the cake pieces securely in place. The caramel sauce was sooo good with the cake. Served butter pecan ice cream as recommended-delicious! My family raved over the rich flavor of this dessert and the beautiful presentation. I think I'll make it again next year.

This is a delicious dessert. I, too, found it took longer than one hour for the frosting to thicken. After 2 hours I stuck frosting in the frig for 45 min. or so and it was ready to go. The cake rolled with no problem, even after it sat around,uncovered, for 4 hours. I love butter pecan ice cream, but I found it to be too much with this cake. Would suggest vanilla ice cream, maybe, or just whipped cream.

Will be making this for the third year in a row this coming Christmas Eve. It always receives rave reviews and is absolutely fantastic!

This is a wonderful recipe. The sponge is quite "springy" and so it rolls beautifully- the caramel sauce and the icing are delicious and the pecan icecream goes very well with the cake.

This is the second year I've made this cake. Both times, it has turned out beautifully and tasted out of this world. I always get rave reviews on this one. I use the caramel sauce for so many different things. Great topping for mascarpone or cream cheese to create a fruit dip.

This was a fantastic recipe. Time-consuming from start to finish, but I had so much fun making the log and then decorating it to perfection. My frosting took about 3 hours to set up, which was starting to make me really nervous. I put it in the refrigerator and about 10 minutes later it was gorgeous! I too made meringue mushrooms and the entire platter got many oohs and ahhs at the dinner table Christmas night.

Cake was delicious - all raved about it at our Christmas dinner. I did have an issue with the frosting, but was able to fix it. My frosting began to seperate and have an oily look to it. I put it in my stand mixer and whipped in a half cup of heavy cream. It worked beautifully and was delicious. It was a request for next Christmas!

This dessert is fabulous. Very easy to make. If the cake breaks when you roll it, don't worry, you can cover anything with frosting and no one will ever know. Pecans really make the cake delicious. I even made meringue mushrooms to put alongside the buche. The frosting was a little too sweet. Next time I will use less sugar.

Very beautiful and also quite easy. Make sure to butter the parchment. I didn't and my cake stuck just enough so I worried about tearing the cake as I rolled it. The icing sets up to perfection and the caramel sauce is really to die for. We didn't have Bourbon in the house so I used vanilla instead which was fine.

I made this easy easy recipe and impressed my entire French Canadian family. It is definitely an intermediate recipe worth trying for the novice. The pecan ice cream was a nice touch even in cold weather. Ice cream recommended.

My guests thought this was the best cake I had ever baked. I am planning to make it again. The caramel sauce was fantastic!

Made two of these for Christmas '06. My first attempt at a buche de noel, so I was a bit nervous. I followed the recipe exactly (no pre-rolling) and what do you know...it rolled perfectly! The first cake cooked a bit long and was a little dry, but the second was perfect. Still a very dense cake; all the nuts, I think. I made the caramel and the icing 2 days ahead of time and that seemed to work very well. The icing spread easily and held it all together great. The caramel sauce was honestly my favorite part of this recipe. I'll add the caramel to my collection for certain! As for the whole package, it was honestly so-so results for a lot of work. It was a good experience, but if I make a buche next year I think I'll try a different recipe.

PS: I did serve with banannas - which I think was the "icing on the icing on the cake." The combination of the rich pecan roll, the chocolate-carmel icing, the carmel sauce and the smooth banannas was amazing. What a great mix!

What I complement I received - "who made the piece of art?" Even better - after they TASTED it, they loved it even more! This worked out fantastic. I followed the first review's suggestions on rolling this while still warm with a kitchen towel. Only thing I'd change is to add/keep the parchament lining, so the roll doesn't stick as much to the the towel. The icing was fantabulous. I agree - it needs to cool, but spread beautifully when you do. I was a little "stingy" on the 1cup inside - I was worried I'd run out on the log outside. But, I actually had some leftover. So use the full cup. I also used the fork tines to draw out some bark lines along the log as well as the concentric circles on the end. I decorated the plate with some fresh pine garland we had, a little holly sprig from the front yard - and it was a major hit. It will become my regular Christmas dessert. Note: when I first started spreading and setting it up, my partner didn't think it looked at ALL like a log...well, not a natural wood log. He used other terms to describe it! I was heartbroken and afraid it was going to fail. Fortunately, it cleaned up great and nobody had any problems knowing this was a true Buche de Noel!

Very good and cake rolled easily. I took suggestion from previous reviewer and rolled without filling first while still warm. To the reviewer who did not like the icing, maybe she did not wait for the icing to set. It is clear on the recipe that the icing must cool to spreading consistency. My only suggestion would be to make sauce and icing the previous day in order to give time for the icing to set. Caramel sauce was scrumptious.

What a disaster!! The "cake" was easy to make but the icing! UUGGHH!!! I followed the directions and the icing just ran off of the cake. I served it on Christmas. The people that tried it thought it just tasted "ok". I just tossed the cake into the trash. I'll be looking for a new cake to make for next Christmas.

This was a hit at Christmas dinner. Served it with homemade butter pecan ice-cream. I'll be making it again next Christmas for sure.

Christmas eve 2006 Very Good-my husband was munching on the leftovers first thing Christmas morning. I was tempted to pre-roll as the other reviewrs suggested, but decided to give the recipe a chance and it worked beautifully. Next time I would start the frosting first and it should be even easier (agree it took more than 1 hr. for the frosting to set up. I could have let the carmel go a bit longer, but didn't want to risk burning and having to start again. Also wanted the traditional meringue "mushrooms" but ran out of time - so I used meringues from Trader Joe's and they looked great. Need to work on log look a little, it had a bit of an X look because the piece for the "top" seemed a bit heavy so put it near the base - next time I'll make it a bit smaller to get the desired effect. It does take a very large platter (had to cut off a slice for sampling to make it fit!)

Delicious, beautiful and easy to make. Was worried about the frosting not being firm enough but it is easy to spread and firms up once on the cake.

This recipe was pretty simple. The cake turned out beautifully....after cooling in the pan for 20 minutes, I flipped it over onto a towel dusted with powdered sugar - the parchment came right off...I rolled the cake with the towel and let it cool. The caramel sauce set up perfectly - thick and pourable and delicious. The frosting was not as firm as I would have liked (I let it set for 2 hours), however it firmed up on the cake after sitting out for a couple of hours...I then covered with parchment and let it sit overnight. Served with the best butter pecan ice cream, bananas and caramel sauce, this is a super rich and sweet dessert but impressive and delicious.

Just did a practice run on the cake only. Very delish. I only used 1 cup of nuts and vanilla w/some water instead of bourbon (this is going to a school party). It is very good and rolled nicely. I have made several yule log cakes and offer this tip. Let the cake cool slightly in the pan. While still warm place a clean kitchen towel that has been sprinkled with some 10x sugar over the cake. Flip it over and unmold the cake onto the towel. Gently roll the towel with the cake into the jelly roll shape. Let it cool this way. This helps with cracking and it is easier to reroll once it is filled. I'll edit this review once I make the whole thing.
