Sorry to buck the trend, but we won't be repeating this. I used a half recipe salsa for the two of us and 1/2 chipotle pepper gave little discernible heat to the salsa. So it was pleasant, but once was enough. We also didn't get much smoky flavour inparted into the shrimp, so they were rather bland.

Made this recipe several times last year...always to rave reviews. I am expecting guests tomorrow, and this was the appetizer my husband requested...pretty unusual for him to remember a dish, even one he loved, for a whole year. It really is remarkable, and low carb too.

Excellent! Did not use the cedar planks, just grilled on the stove top. Used 1/2 chipotle amt and it was perfect!

I doubled this recipe for a dinner party last night, and wish I had tripled it. My family and guests loved it, and I'm looking forward to trying the leftover salsa with other dishes. The only change I made was adding some extra adobo sauce to get it a little spicier and smokier.

This was a very interesting recipe. I have cooked many a fish fillet or entire side on cedar planks but never shellfish. It imparted a strong flavor that was definitly unique, we chose for simplicity sake to leave the shell on as I doubled the recipe. I think that the salsa is a bit misleading (not in a bad way) because it is primarily roasted red peppers and that flavor,which I enjoy, is quite predominate. The spice from the chipolte is nice but not discernable as again there is so much roasted red pepper, but it sound cool to say chipotle anyway. I had a lot left over and look forward to using it on other things. I would certainly make this again.

A great salsa! I even used it in an eggplant stir-fry the next day. This recipe is a keeper, even though I wasn't lucky enough to get fresh shrimp off the boat...

I have used many epicurious recipes, but this is the first I have felt compelled to review. IT WAS AWESOME!!! My husband and I high-fived over the table! We wondered what we were doing cracking the seed out of the shell, but that is the way they came in our area. However, the fresh shrimp directly off the boat made it all worth while. I give this a 10!!!
