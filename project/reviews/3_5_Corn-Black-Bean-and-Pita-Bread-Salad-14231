I have made this so many times. I can't stop making it. I don't use the pita and I add red pepper. This is so easy and so good

Very good recipe for being so simple. Next time I won't bother with the pita, I just don't think it added to the salad, and there is already plenty of crunch with the celery.

Pita bread in a corn and black bean salad? You wouldn't think so, but yes, it works. The balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and red onion add the perfect flavor. I recommend salt and pepper for the pita.

The first time I made it, I halved the recipe since I wasn't sure my family would like it. They loved it! I added cilantro, left out the celery, and served the toasted pita bread on the side. What a great, easy side dish.

I have used this recipe for so long, and started adding things, that I forgot the original. I hope you won't mind my suggestions for additional ingredients. I add 1/2 cup of fresh or roasted red pepper. 2 cloves minced garlic. Sometimes some green onion as well as red. This recipe has way too much onion for us. I would reduce it and then taste. You can always add more. 1/2+ cup fresh basil leaves, chopped. Farmers' market celery w/ leaves is the best. More feta, for sure. We serve ours on the side. If you can't get pita, croutons or melba toast w/ garlic work fine. You may need more olive oil. It's good for you...go for it. Hope this works. It works for us!

Excellent side dish! I made it with just a bit more of the liquids since others said it was dry... great! I had to bake the pitas WAY longer than instructed to get a nice, crisp chip. They ended up getting pretty soggy after several hours, which was still good. Yummy!

Although I toasted the split pita breads for less time than suggested, they still became like cracker bread, and never got soft when added to the salad itself. I guess that is partly because there is so little dressing on this salad. I liked the ingredients and the overall taste, but would do things differently the next time: perhaps toast the entire pita bread; use more oil and vinegar, and add some other seasoning (cilantro, parsley, basil?), and possibly tomatoes as well. Good concept, needs some help!

I used 2 cups of frozen corn, 1 15oz can of small white beans and substituted goat cheese for feta, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. We all loved it at my house and I plan on making it again for a company dinner on the weekend.

delicious, easy, filling and refreshing. i leave the pita out and serve it as a salad or pita filling.

This dish was pretty good. I hate onions, so drastically reduced the amount of onions called for. I also should have kept the pita pieces separate from the rest of the salad. The pita gets pretty soggy when the salad is more than a few hrs old.
