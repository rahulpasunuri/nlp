I've used this recipe for both tenderloin and rib roast and both were wonderful. This is an easy and impressive dish for entertaining a crowd.

Excellent combination of spices makes this distinct. If you are going to make this please buy the best quality tenderloin you can find. I've made it twice, the second time with a lesser cut of meat and the difference was very noticable.
