I made this torte twice and my husband loves it. He calls it "Apple Pie for Grownups". It is labor intensive and I can see how the rest of the reviews reflect frustration. I'm wondering if the negative reviewers toasted the breadcrumbs(important for the texture) and toasted the hazelnuts(important for the taste). Thanks to the cook from Minneapolis who provided the Lidia link....I think I will follow these crust instructions next time to save some labor. I used Pink Lady apples the first time and cooked them in Late Harvest Gewurtztraminer. When I made this again, I used Granny Smith apples and Apple Ice Wine. We REALLY like the Pink Lady/Gewurtztraminer combo...adds more sweet apricot depth to the apples.

Not the first time Bon Appetit has featured/touted a famous chef's recipe(s) but I have ended up only being extremely disappointed. What gives BA?

I would have given this recipe NO forks if I could have. This was, without a doubt, the worst dessert I've ever made. The crust never really set and basically tasted like soggy crumbs. I reviewed all the steps and ingredients and am certain I made it correctly. Truly terrible!

Check out this link from the Lidia's Italy website. It uses the same filling ingredients and amounts, but changes the crust recipe amounts considerably: http://www.lidiasitaly.com/recipes/detail/855

This recipe is both incredibly flawed and confusing, AND results in something barely edible. Don't bother. We were so disappointed!

So I was a bit dubious after reading the reviews but made a few select changes that I thought should pull this recipe through as it look quite intriguing. However even with the modifications (such as extra sugar, amaretto and limoncello in the crumb mix) I not only ended up with 2 extra cups of crumbs but the most boring and bland crumple possible not to mention the mixture wouldnt stick so I couldnt roll it out and ended up making a kind of crumble instead. My guess is that when a recipe has a celebrated chef attached no one bothers to actually test it out before putting it in the magazine, sorry to say this is one that wont be made again.

my first review because this is so bad yet it made the cover!! read everyone's reviews on amount of breadcrumbs...the only reason this made it to the magazine, yet alone the cover, must be because of the famous chef but shame, shame on Bon Appetit. Select something else to make!

I am 1/2 way doe with this recipe and wish I had read it before I started or I would have just made a rustic apple tart. Added a bit of melted butter to get more depth in crust mixture and some cardamon. After reading all the reviews, I think I will add some more apples, uncooked, before I bake it. I agree with the rest, who tested this recipe and I will read reviews before starting.

Very poorly written/edited recipe, I agree with all. Searched on web and found this: http://www.bellalimento.com/2010/10/08/torta-di-mele-apple-torte-with-breadcrumb-hazelnut-crust/ Basically 8 cups of torn bread, after being baked and ground in food processor, ends up with 3 cups breadcrumbs. I had no issues with the apples, cooked them on low heat. Best way to make the bottom crust is simply to press it into the tart shell with your hand. I agree after making with another reviewer that the end result would have been much better if I had simply sprinkled the remaining crumbs on the top rather than rolling out on plastic - it was simply too much breadcrumb crust for such a light filling. All in all it was a lot of work for a dessert that ended up very quite, nothing special, the taste reminded me of a Danish applesauce dessert with breadcrumb topping. The nuts were barely noticable in the crust flavor. I wouldn't bother making again.

Hhhburger really knows what she/he? is talking about. When I made this recipe and came to the 3 cups of bread crumbs, I wasn't sure what to do with the other 5 until I went to Epicurious and saw that someone wrote in a review that 8 cups really does become 3 once baked and dried. I even put mine through my food processor after baking and then they measured 3. My apples almost became applesauce so I stopped cooking them before the liquid evaporated. I think I cut them too thinly. But all in all it came out beautifully and was delicious and well received by my dinner party. Whenever I have questions about a recipe, I will always turn to the reviews in Epicurious because the users really do help.

Dear Bon Appétit: Do you have a test kitchen, and if so, why did you not utilize it before publishing this recipe? When all was said and done, I could not believe the waste this recipe resulted in. Like so many others, I also wound up only using 4 cups of breadcrumbs / 3 cups of the crust mixture. I could not imagine the disaster this would have been had I tried to use all of it. I also have no idea why one would roll out any part of this crust: press in the bottom, hand cover and press the top. All that said, the figured out end result looked wonderful and tasted even better. I"ll certainly be making the modified recipe again.

The subtle combination of lemon, nuts and apples was delicious and the torte was gorgeous when plated. I had 10 people for dinner last night, and everyone agreed it was wonderful -- even more so because it was not the ubiquitous pie or cake. I did not have any problems following this recipe, although I agree it could be better written and edited. The disparity in the bread crumb measurements didnt throw me as it made sense that moisture evaporating from bread drying decreased the mass. I cooked the apples uncovered (because I didn't have a big enough pan lid) over medium heat and the cider cooked down in exactly 20 minutes. After baking, the apples yielded to the fork, but still held their shape. Following the recipe, my crust mixture was the consistency of wet sand and did not need either flour or additional liquid to come together. You don't need to roll out either top or bottom crust. For the top, scoop out a 1 cup measure onto a piece of plastic wrap, top with another piece of plastic and using the tart pan bottom as a guide use your hands to press the crust into shape. It is easily transferred in the plastic to a dinner plate and then to the fridge to chill, and easily maneuvered to the tart top before baking. For the bottom crust, just dump the crumb mixture in the tart pan and use your fingers to press it into place. Bake the tart on the lower middle rack of the oven, and check after 45 minutes. If the edge of the crust is getting too brown, cover the edges with foil. This recipe didn't take me any longer than the time indicated, and didn't present any unusual challenges. It would be lovely on a holiday dessert buffet.

I have not even got this in the oven yet, but was so perplexed by the breadcrumb issue that I went to Epicurious to check the reviews. Glad to see that I am not crazy and when something doesn't seem to make sense it isn't that I can't follow a recipe, it is because sometimes the recipe is just bad and or poorly written. We know it isn't right because we CAN cook. My husband saw the picture and said, "Make this for Thanksgiving". I am so glad I test recipes before the big event as even if this ends up being edible - it is not worthy of Thanksgiving. As other reviewer said, great picture; bad recipe.

I created an Epicurious account for the first time specifically to rate this recipe: it was outstanding! The nutty, not-too-sweet crust balances the apple filling perfectly. I used white wine, not cider, for the filling, cooked it in a non-stick pan, and had no problems getting all the liquid to cook off. The apples were tender and held their shape easily. I agree that the recipe could have been edited better about the bread crumbs. I started with 6 c. (from one supermarket loaf of Italian bread) fresh crumbs, and ended up with about 3 cups after toasting them. The crust is a little temperamental, but if you have any experience working with pastry, you'll have no trouble. Just be gentle, and definitely press the top crust out on plastic wrap, not a floured work surface. I chilled both overnight, and it came together beautifully the next day. One final note: keep an eye on the crust while baking -- mine started to burn, so I just covered the edge with foil. But otherwise, a really good apple dessert, and a nice change from apple pie.

How this recipe made it past the testers at Bon Appetit, we will never know. No wisdom was shared with the recipe to ease up the tiresome breadcrumb process. For a 5 hour devotion to an outcome which looked delicious, we were sorely dissapointed. My breadcrumb crust scorched on the sides and was only so-so, even with great Italian bread as the basis prior to adding the sugar, milk, and lemon rind. The apple filling is near impossible to keep from collapsing if you follow the recommended times to reduce the hard cider and even with careful handling. Anyhow it looks way better than it tastes - move on to something with a higher rating!

After reading all the reviews, I'm really confused as to how I should go about to make this recipe since I'd like to have this dessert with the menu. Doesn't anyone at Epicurious read these notes and respect the users time and money enough to comment, at least in this case, and correct the recipe if required. Maybe we should write to Lidia Bastianich and make her aware of what is happening to her "cover recipe"...And a big thank you for all the reviewers!

Not only was this a time consuming recipe, but it did not live up to expectations given the inviting picture on the cover of Bon Appetit! When we cooked the apples, they got all mushy, despite cooking them for less time than the recipe called for. The result was an applesauce like texture that lacked flavor and the "bite" of a more typical apple pie. The crust was okay but again the texture, having used breadcrumbs instead of flour was more grainy. The flavor of the crust was okay but didn't do enough to elevate the taste of the torte. Overall, one of the more disappointing experiences with Bon Appetit recipes!

Thank you to all the reviewers for writing about your experiences with this recipe. I knew I could count on you. We went apple picking and have bags of fresh apples waiting to make themselves into pies, tarts, and other delectables. I saw the picture on the front of BA, my husband salivated, and I bought all of the ingredients (including 2 loaves of french bread). I kept reading and re-reading the recipe and it seemed off and very time consuming. Also, it seemed a bit crazy. Vis-a-vis flour, 8 cups fresh french bread crumbs is a rather expensive ingredient. The rationale for bread crumbs was the lack of availability of flour (I laughed at the poster to commented that bread is made of flour). I came to this site because I hoped a reviewer would say that they made the recipe with flour, rather than breadcrumbs. After reading all of your experiences, I am so glad I did not embarked on this recipe. I will stick with a basic apple crumble/crisp.

Sadly, I have to agree with every review. Halfway through making this, I couldn't figure out where the rest of the breadcrumbs went, if I needed to oil and/or flour the pan, and, oh yeah, again, where do those extra breadcrumbs go? Luckily we have resources such as Epicurious to go to. We no longer have to suffer alone! Had the recipe read "3 cups of finely ground fresh, toasted breadcrumbs" there would certainly have been less trouble. That said, I listened to other reviews, both here and on the BA site. I added 1 stick of butter, 1 cup of sour cream, and enough extra milk to moisten the crumbs. Added nutmeg too. Used an 8" springform. I can't imagine how thin the filling would be in a 9". That might explain some of the dryness. Added about 1 Tbs. crystalized ginger to the apples. Just pressed the top on, crumb style. Chilled the whole thing for an hour. End result: I think the sour cream helped make a more tender crust. The ginger cut the winey flavor of the apples. All told, not as bad as I thought, but wouldn't make again. BA, you have to do better than this! I certainly don't feel like trying any other recipies from that article.

I cannot even give this half of a fork! I too was confused by the 8 cups- then only using 3. This was wierd and I almost threw it out as well.. but decided to stick it out. Very dissapointing.. impossible to get the crust to climb the pan let alone stick together to drape down half way. it was expensive and wasteful... I saved the left over 5 cups of breadcrumbs and made the meatball recipe in the same issue. I tend to trust the publication but maybe a bit more of a skeptic now. I won't make this again.. I did scrape the apples out and will warm to put over ice cream.

I haven't even finished making this recipe, and am considering throwing the entire thing away! I'm amazed that Bon Appetit can let their cover recipe be published, even though clearly no one read or tested the recipe before going to print.

After reading these reviews, and still wanting to make the torte, (I planned and did make the entire menu), I searched for Lidia's original recipe, which I heard was published in her book. I was able to find this version online; noting the large differences in proportions. For instance, it only uses 1.5 c of dried breadcrumbs and one half cup of hazelnuts. Even with the adjustments, the dough is a challenge, but tasty enough and worth a try.

I was eager to try a torte with a different twist to the crust...what a huge disappointment! I did exactly what the receipe called for and got a rather tasteless, dry crust with quite good apples. For the effort, I plan to stick with a tart crust. I also was chuckling over the reason for using the bread crumbs...that flour wasn't available!!! What is the main ingredient in bread?? Personally, I wouldn't even give this one fork.

I am a food writer who has been writing about food and testing recipes for articles for 25+ years. Tempted by the gorgeous photo on the cover of Bon Appetit, I attempted to make this torte. Halfway through, I realized there were several problems - not just a missing ingredient or omitted step in the method but several serious mistakes. The amount of breadcrumbs, quantity of liquid in the dough, method for cooking the apples - all are questionable. I persisted in making the thing, knowing full well there were problems. The result: a dry, flavourless version of apple crumble. A corrected recipe is called for, Bon Appetit editors. Please, publish one and do the right thing.

After reading other reviews I wasn't sure about making this, but it turned out great! I ended up with a little over 4 cups of the toasted crumbs and used them all. I added a touch more milk, half tbsp of butter and a tbsp of Amaretto to the crust. I used a 10 inch tart pan. Tip: I pressed out the top crust on a extra tart bottom so that I was easily able to flip it over on the torte after chilling. I made a honey vanilla ice cream to go with this and everyone at my dinner party raved!

I was pretty disappointed with this recipe--it seems to have great potential, but I really didn't like the finished product. I had to read the recipe a few times to get what was going on with the breadcrumbs, too, but it does make sense if you start with fresh bread crumbs that they'll reduce down to 3 cups or so after being baked. I started with dry crumbs, so I just used the 3 cups called for. As for the hazelnuts, I had ground hazelnuts (which is the reason I wanted to make this torte), so I didn't have to go through the trouble of husking, toasting, and grinding as another reveiwer did. I ended up adding about 2 tablespoons more butter and a quarter cup more milk into the crust to keep it together, which then worked out fine. The filling was pretty straight-forward. But the finished torte was less than spectacular. The crust is entirely too thick (and I didn't even use all of it), pretty dry, and it completely overtakes the apple filling (which itself is really good). It's too bad because the flavors all work really well together--maybe with different proportions this could be awesome, but not as is.

The recipe did seem confusing - but when you take 8 cups of fresh bread crumbs and toast them in the oven for 20 minutes as indicated, they reduce down to about 3 - 4 cups. Also, the recipe did state that you should finish the apples uncovered so the liquid would reduce - this took slightly longer than 10 minutes, but the liquid did reduce. I made this for my husband's birthday, and we both found it quite tasty!

This recipe sounded so fabulous but I ran into the same thing as the other reviewers. What do you do with the remaining half of the breadcrumbs??? I wound up adding the remaining bread crumbs and the resulting crust was okay in flavor but awful in texture.

I cannot believe the trouble I went to to make this recipe! I almost went out and bought a second loaf of french bread because one loaf made only five cups but thankfully I pulled out half a loaf of bread I had frozen so I used that. I spent so much time reading and rereading the recipe to see where I missed what to do with the other five cups that I actually thought I was losing it! But the real issue for me was the "one cup of hazelnuts, husked" ingredient. Unless you know how to toast and husk hazelnuts you cannot believe how time consuming it can be. I actually went online to see how to do it. Toasting and rubbing them together in a towel or blanching them and then peeling them....come on! At least there should have been some instructions for this step since we all aren't up on this proscess and just how time consuming this is. I followed the instructions to the letter and the dough was like paste. Did anyone at Bon Appetit try this? I agree that to feature that recipe and have it incorrect is a real problem. I spent all day and some real money to make it....shame on Bon Appetit!

This recipe was highly disappointing on so many levels and in so many different steps.... In order to get all the liquid to evaporate, we finally figured out on the second batch (we were making two of these, unfortunately) that we had to take the lid off the saute pan after the apples soften. And.... 8 cups of breadcrumbs?!! Shame on me for not taking the time to internalize the entire recipe before I started, but we actually made 16 cups of breadcrumbs, just to find out it really only called for SIX. Quite a time-waster when we were already pressed for time. Once we got over that disappointment (figured we can use the crumbs in other ways), we found out that to form a 9" round if this mix on a floured surface was not possible. We formed it on plastic wrap with the disk from the tart pan underneath to transport them. We decided to freeze the tops in an attempt to hopefully move them to the top without disaster. And, finally, to form the bottom layer to rise .5 in. above the top of the pan, just to fold it over ultimately proved to me that no one at Bon Appetit attempted to do this. Very disappointed in the recipe, but more in Bon Appetit for publishing it as their COVER without testing. Ultimately, it tasted 'fine', but not without a lot of time and unnecessary stress.

Agree with above poster - I read this recipe originally in this months' Bon Apetit. Calls for 8 cups of breadcrumbs and i read and re-read the body of the recipe and could not find the other 5. And I don't know how anyone could keep the top crust in one piece - I just crumbled it all up on top instead. Tasted good but won't repeat

This seems to be a flawed recipe. First, the recipe calls for 8 cups of breadcrumbs, which is a lot, but only uses 3 cups. You cook the apples with the hard cider, but the liquid never evaporated, even after cooking for twice as long as the recipe recommended so I ended up just discarding a lot of it...that may be another measurement error. I would have continued to cook the apples, but thought they'd eventually just fall apart. The "dough" is held together with the milk and the butter, but seemed like it needed something else....perhaps an egg...to keep it from falling apart and make it more workable. I was able to form the top crust between 2 sheets of plastic wrap and carefully place it in the fridge. It was much easier to work with when chilled. The flavor was fine and the recipe was ok, but I would not repeat.
