I won't rate this because I only made the dressing - - and it is SUPERB! My only change was to use anchovy paste in place of the anchovies.

This was so delicious! I made my own croutons from an extra piece of baguette I had thrown into my freezer a couple of weeks ago with a bit of the garlic and parmesean. Great complement to the yummy dressing. I was a bit nervous to throw the egg on top of the greens but I did it anyway and it was all very good! I will definitely be making this one again.

Great dressing, the lemon adds a fresh taste. Already have requests for recipe.

I love caesar salad, I do make my own croutons(real garlicky), I appreciate the one minute egg. Have made this recipe a million times, my family love it!!!

I make this all the time and it's wonderful. I don't put in the lemon zest (too overpowering) or the egg (too gooey) and we love it.
