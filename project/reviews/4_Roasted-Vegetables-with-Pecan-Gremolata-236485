I thought this was good, but not great. I used carrots, parsnips, watermelon radishes, and brussels sprouts, and the directions for cooking them was perfect. I just didn't find the gremolata fabulous. And I don't know why they say to cool the veggies; I think they would be better served warm. They don't have to be hot out of the oven, but warm would be nice.

I used golden beets and small yellow onions. Omitted the turnips. Only used 1/3 of the gremolata as the veggies were so good without it.

This is a bi-weekly go to for dinner at our house, and perfect for taking advantage of fall/winter veg from farmers' markets and CSA boxes. The gremolata definitely adds that perfect finishing touch. I include any fall/root veg we have on hand, in addition to those called for - leeks, squash, potatoes (sweet & regular), rutabaga (this is a must), beets, kohlrabi, etc. We often serve over quinoa or plain couscous for a main dish. Also great as leftovers (cold or hot)!

I hardly need to add to all the great reviews other than to say you could probably vary the vegetables to taste/what you can get. And that my skeptical sisters were completely impressed when all of our children polished this off at thanksgiving, event the vegetable-averse!

Absolutely outstanding veggie side dish - even non-root veg lovers gobbled. Key is the toasted pecans - HEAVEN in this dish! I only roasted for half the suggestion time to keep them a bit crunchy too, as we don't like mushy veggies. Taste is an A, texture an A (great variety of textures), ease of preparation a B, expensiveness an A (lots of flavors but very inexpensive), presentation an A (looks so pretty on a serving dish), so overall this dish gets an A!

Ok, I have never been one to follow a recipe exactly- so I made a few improvements. I added cauliflower, thick chopped pancetta and butternut squash and fresh beets to the mix. For the gremulata I chopped the pecans roughly and added fresh ground pepper to the mix. Served this with a marinated pork tenderloin last night. Warm filling and tasty!

Very filling but light and delicious! I put everything for the gremolata in the food processor together, it had a really nice texture mixed with the veggies. I didn't toast the pecans and it was still great, but it would probably be even better as people suggested.

My family tends to indulge in creamy casseroles for the holidays - and this is the perfect antidote to all that richness! Refreshing to the palate, easy to make, and delicious, this is perfect veggie dish for any day of the week and special occasions. Definitely toast the pecans (I did it in a skillet instead of the oven). I omitted the garlic since I'm breastfeeding my newborn and the garlic gives her bad gas, and it was still really flavorful! I realized after making this dish that I don't like turnips (so bitter), so I would omit them next time and just use the parsnips and carrots, or even substituting regular potatoes would be fine if you are looking to keep a variety. Also, I loved on reviewer's idea of keeping the different veggies separate and arranging them on a platter - I did it on Christmas and it did really look pretty...plus, I could successfully avoid the turnips!

Just made this for our Christmas eve dinner and it was a huge hit. I included carrots, parsnips, cauliflower, zucchini, brussels sprouts and radishes. The dish looked beautiful and all ages liked it. The gremolata absolutely made the dish, though. This one definitely goes into permananent rotation.

I prepared this recipe as printed, and it was both delicious and beautiful. The gremolata added a welcome freshness to the root vegetables. . . come February and March I'll probably be making this all the time!

These veggies were the hit of Thanksgiving! The gremolata is the key, though I used half of the cheese called for. I'm going to keep the gremolata in my arsenal for use on all sorts of things - chicken, fish, pasta, etc.

I didn't care for the gremolata. It smelled wonderful, but the texture didn't complement the roasted vegetables to my liking. Perhaps it would have been better if the pecans were finely ground, rather than coarse.

I doubled this recipe for a Thanksgiving side dish that served 18 people. I also substituted one pound of the parsnips for 1 lb of zuchni. Felt that a a red onion in chunks would have been a good addition as well - will do that next time. In any case, it was very delicious and is quite beautiful. Another thing I will do differently is use freshly grated Parmesan cheese as it didn't melt that well. With all the things I had going on for Thanksgiving I bought a little container of the shredded cheese. Oh, and everyone is right - you really must toast the pecans.

I love roasted vegetables and I'm always looking for an inventive way to take them to the next level. This is it. The gremolata was special, delicious and unexpected Like another reviewer, I also roasted the pecans. Can't wait to share this with my friends on Thanksgiving. Don't be afraid to give this one a try. Even my kids liked it.

WOW. YUM. The gremolata really kicks it up a notch for roasted vegetables! A big hit at Thanksgiving. People wanted the recipe. I used walnuts instead of pecans, and only brussels sprouts and carrots.

I just tried out this recipe to see if I wanted to use it for Thanksgiving, which I certainly will. I used my own combination of vegetables, broccoli, zucchini, parsnips and carrots. I was very surprised that the recipe didn't call for the pecans to be toasted, which I did for about ten minutes at 375. The toasted pecans made this dish! I also added some fresh dill. This was one of those rare occasions when there were no leftovers!

The gremolata was great. Next time, though, I'm going with just the roasted carrots. I guess we just don't like turnips all that much.

Our family ranted about this at Christmas dinner. I roasted (with summer savory) cauliflower, broccoli, brussel sprouts and in a separate pan, turnip, sweet potato, carrots, and mini-potatoes then tossed together. That way nothing was over-cooked. The topping was a huge hit.

I made this dish last year for thanksgiving, and thought it was beautiful and delicious. The only problem I have it that the leaves of the brussel sprouts burn a bit. As a bonus, the crowd seemed scared of it, so I got to take home lots of leftovers!

I made this dish for Thanksgiving when it was first published and it was a huge hit with my family. It has become a staple entree in our house. I now serve it over a bed of rice and use it as a main dish and everyone is always impressed.

Used only carrots and sprouts but all else the same. VERY popular at the potluck. Served at room temp. A keeper.

I thought this recipe was excellent. I made it on Thanksgiving for the first time and made it again on Christmas Eve. I stayed true to the recipe the first time I made it but altered it the second time and just used carrots to accomodate my anti-brussel sprout guests. Both versions turned out great!

There's nothing I can say other than....FABULOUS! I made this for Thanksgiving without the cheese (for a non-dairy meal). I was delicious and presented beautifully. Instead of mixing the vegetable together, I laid them out in rows--a line of turnips, then brussels sprouts, then carrots, then parsnips. It came out looking s little more sophisticated that way and not such a mess. The gremolata had the most sedutive scent. I use a Microplace zester so I got lots of delicious lemon. (I didn't measure--I used about 1 lemon's worth). This dish is my new winter staple. My only change would be toasted the pecans next time to enhance their flavor.

I made this last Thanksgving and it was such a hit that I am making it again! The only thing I added was some chopped fennel bulb, which worked well with the other flavors.

I made this recipe for my Thanksgiving family dinner. It a the hit of the meal. My guests called the next day to let me know how different and flavorful it was. The first time I made this recipe I did not use the cheese in the gremolata. It was great with out it too. The 2nd time I did use the cheese. That was also great. Either way works well. I strongly recommend this easy recipe which is a nice alternative vegetable dish to any dinner.

Made this for Thanksgiving, Substituted the Brussel Sprouts with mini green squash (only because I made brussel sprouts seperately) and added extra cheese. Everyone LOVED it Will definately make it again

Made this for my Thanksgiving menu. Simple and easy to prepare. I roasted the vegetables half way and held them till I took out the turkey to rest before carving.Finished them during that time. My guests loved them. The gremolata adds a nice finish to the roasted flavors of the vegetables.

I cannot understand how anybody could rate this below 3 forks. This was one of the most delicious roasted vegetable recipes I've ever had. Everybody loved it at Thanksgiving. The roasted vegetables were delightful and the pecan gremolata was amazing, adding wonderful, delecate flavor to the already sweetened, by roasting, vegetables. The only thing I changed was to add 1 more Tbl of lemon zest and an extra clove of garlic, even though it wasn't necessary. YUMM!!!

I'm always looking for new ways to prepare roasted vegetables and this looked so beautiful in the magazine -- I had high expectations. Alas, it was not as wonderful as I had hoped. It was good, just not wonderful. In future, I'd try it with walnuts instead of pecans to make it healthier. And to make it much healthier, I'd follow the traditional gremolata mixture that just includes parsley, lemon peel and garlic and skip the nuts and cheese. Also, it did not need an hour to roast -- 30 minutes was fine.

This is the first dish that I have made from recipes on Epicurious that I was disappointed with. I thought I would make in advance of company coming....I am glad I did, it is not something that I would make again, let alone for company. You have to try everything once...this was my once.

I made a test batch of this and decided it was definitely Thanksgiving worthy. The flavors of the gremolata brought out the sweetness of the roasted veggies.
