Delicious!!! A great sophisticated but totally accessible flavor combination. I made it with pre-made polenta because I was short on time. It was very easy. I made it twice in one week it was so good.

I make this frequently; it's great to make the night before and than just reheat for dinner. We eat it plain or with tomato sauce or mushroom sauce. The secret to having it always turn out is to stir it for the FULL 6 minutes....by the clock. At 4 minutes it looks pretty thick but it is not enough. Set the timer for 6 minutes after you have whisked in all of the polenta. I've never had it fail me. Gruyere, rosemary, walnuts....what's not to love?

I make this for dinner parties and people love it! It's so easy, you can make it ahead of time, and it's absolutely delicious! Polenta goes so well with pork dishes, and it's a nice change from pasta. Love this recipe!!!

Excellent and easy to make the day before. Next time I may make 1.5 of the recipe so the triangles are a little thicker and more substantial. Just a thought...

Blob. Never really firmed up. when I baked it - it got worse. What a waste

Great side dish ! Used the many suggestions (cooking the full amount of time and more, using coarse grain (ie polenta) cornmeal, and letting the flavors develop for a day in the refrig)and it worked out fabulously.

I had very good results with this recipe. I followed it exactly with the exception of using vegetable broth. I thought there was too much rosemary and butter (esp. on the top -- it made it a bit greasy), but otherwise good. Next time, I'd reduce the rosemary or use a different herb, and definitely not use the butter on top at all.

Followed the recipe as written and didn't have any problems with the polenta holding together. However, neither my husband nor I thought this was anything to write home about. It's a little bland, but nothing that extra rosemary or a sprinkle of salt couldn't fix. If I made this again, I'd leave it soft and pair it with a dish that has a lot of pan juice or gravy since polenta (like mashed potatoes) seems to work best in a sauce absorption role. We made this with lamb chops and it just didn't contribute much to the meal.

I guess I'm just not a polenta person, however my daughter liked it, and my husband put tapatillo sauce on it, then ate it. In a hurry I put it in freezer for 15 minutes, shortened up firming time.

Wonderful, make ahead dish. Made for company and not a crumb left. Took the advice of others and really cooked the polenta so had no problem with the shape when reheated.

I made this dish a few weeks ago for a dinner party. I wish I had doubled the recipe... it was soo good! I substituted pine nut for the walnuts because I didn't have any at home. I had trouble getting the triangles to stick together after reheating, but it didn't matter. The dish was delicious and extremely simple(perfect since I'm a new mom with little spare time). I took the advice of another reviewer and paired it with the stringbeans - YUMMY!

This dish was absolutely wonderful!! My entire family loved it. I used a good fresh romano because that is what I had, and it was perfect! TO THOSE WHO ARE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE POLENTA HOLDING TOGETHER..Be absolutely sure to cook the polenta for *at least* the full amount of time recommended. Mine was very, very thick after only 2 minutes, but you have to continue cooking and stirring (for what seems like forever) to reduce the moisture content enough for it to stay together once cold. Also, I sprayed a bit of butter flavored Pam on my baking pan (did not use foil) and they lifted off the pan very easily. My husband's exact words to me last night were..."Make this again!" I think I will! (smile)

I used parmigiano instead of gruyere, left out the walnuts and added sage. You can improvise endlessly on this recipe.

This is delicious with any meat.It is creamy, crunchy and flavorful all at once. I always hope for leftovers.

Very rich but very yummy! We pair it with a nice cut of pork. Either pork tenderlon or a nice cut of pork chop. Would also be good with lamb. Enjoy!

Delicious. I substitued Monterey Jack cheese since that what was I had on hand. I made this with the menu suggested in the Bon Appetit article (Pork Tenderloin with Cranberry Port sauce) and it was a great combination.

This is a very tasty polenta. The second time, I used cheddar cheese and didn't bother with the business of transferring it to a dish, cooling, slicing, and reheating. I served it fresh and mushy right after adding cheese, nuts, and rosemary. It had a nice texture and was delicious.

This polenta was delish. I'm going to make it for a party again next week. I used corn meal and cooked it for 30 minutes until it was very thick, and there was no problem holding it together into the triangles. I also brushed the tops with olive oil and broiled until golden, mmmmmm very tasty.

Delicious. Used yellow cornmeal that the recipe calls for(not "polenta" corn meal) and it turned out perfectly. It did thicken more quickly than recipe indicates. Great flavor, nice for entertaining as it can be made a day ahead. Nice alternative to potatoes.

I made this exactly as written and would not change a thing. My dad, who turned up his nose at the thought of eating polenta ate two helpings. I have made it three times since all to rave reviews.

This dish is wonderful, tasty, elegant and fast. You cannot get much better quality-time ratio. I actually had to stop stirring after 5 minutes because it was getting too thick; everything held together wonderfully. I don't know if the brand makes a difference, but I used Dal Raccolto Polenta and seriuosly boiling chicken broth. I will definitely do this again!

This is the best polenta!! I followed the recipe exactly except it must be stirred much longer than 6 minutes. Keep stirring until it gets very very thick. Absolutely delicious.

I don't know why anyone had trouble with the polenta holding together? I've made this at least 6 times, and I've not had that trouble. Knowing the way I cook, I probably put a bit more cheese in it than the recipe specifies...perhaps that helps mine stay together. Combined with the green beans from this same issue, I comsider this a great addition to my recipe box.

Easy to make, but what could be easier than polenta. The second time I made this, I left out the butter and coated my pan with olive oil and noticed no taste difference, nor did I have any problem with the slices falling apart. I served it with a simple spinach salad which really balanced the creamy cheesiness and nuttiness.

I made this again and cooked the polenta til it was very, very thick. I also kept a very close eye on the oven while reheating and it turned out beautifully. To reduce the fat to almost nothing, I left out the butter and could not tell any difference at all.

Did anyone figure out the secret to having this dish hold together. While the flavor was good, I couldn't get the triangles off the baking sheet.

The BEST polenta ever!! Anyone complaining is doing something wrong - I've never had such good polenta anywhere, anytime as this recipe! It's become a staple in my recipe box and I change the rosemary to whatever herb suits my meal - cilantro, basil, etc. and the nut to match, such as walnuts or pinenuts - it doesn't matter, it's still a GREAT recipe!

YUCK - despite homemade broth, good cheese, rosemary from the garden, etc. YUCK, YUCK, YUCK.

This a a great dish for dinner parties. I have made it several times. I usually prepare it 1-2 days before serving. The flavors intensify. I also use toasted pecans and add alittle more rosemary and cheese. It doesn't get much easier than this!!!

I thought this was absolutely delicious! And simple to make. I am shocked that anyone would think it bland at all. I followed directions exactly although I used pecans in place of the walnuts due to a walnut allergy. I will definitely make this again and again. Perfect for do ahead side dish!

I made these for a holiday appetizer party. I lvoe polenta and really enjoyed these and they were not hard to make. Although, when asked, a few people said they thought the recipe was a little balnd--not enough flavor. Though, I would definitely do them again. It's a good pop-it-in your-mouth type of appetizer.

Loved this recipe. I cooked it longer in order the get the right consistency.

Tasty and very easy. The first time I made it, I used a "natural" chicken broth, which was cloudy and it turned the polenta a sickly shade of gray. I grated extra cheese on top to disguise the color. The second time I used a clear chicken broth, which worked perfectly.

Rating: 3
Great flavor!! The problem is the ratio of liquid to polenta, which is why it doesn't "gel". I added more cornmeal and left out the butter..there's plenty of fat from the cheese. Also, you have to be patient with polenta; it takes a long time to release its glutens. Cook it as long as it takes.

Yes, the pieces are a little bit soft when you transfer them from the baking sheet to a platter and from there to plates. Use that device that you use to serve cake (is that called a cake lift in English?). If the polenta wedges were not soft, I suppose they would be rubbery, and who wants that? They are absolutely delicious just the way they are. A wonderful, impressive side dish and really not very difficult to make. And the fact that you can make them ahead of time and just reheat them before eating makes them perfect for dinner parties.

Fantastico! I always thought of polenta as a colourless, tasteless blob on a plate. I did have to cook it rather longer, about 12 mins. in all, but sitting out on the terraza on a beautiful day with 16 friends it was well worth the time. I might sandwich it next time with a little pesto sauce.

This was a great polenta recipe, but needs some work. I agree with the writer who said he cooked it longer than 6 minutes. The end result tasted great, but was quite soft and broke easily in moving from baking sheet to plate. The taste was fabulous, and even won over some non-polenta eaters.

Loved this polenta! Excellent flavor and texture. Even my 2 little boys ate it. Great make-ahead dish.

I'm not sure what the problem was. I followed the recipe to the letter and everything came out perfectly. In fact, I prepared the entire dinner from the Bon Appetit article and this recipe was the one everyone wanted at the end of dinner. Very flavorful and an excellent side dish.

The flavor was very good, but my polenta was way too soft. I cooked it until it was quite thick, but the whole thing loosened up as soon as I added the cheese and butter. (By the way, I did use polenta, not cornmeal, and I have cooked polenta before.) I was very disappointed with these icky-colored polenta blobs. If this really needs to be cooked until the mixture is very thick, the instructions should say so. "Thickens" does not imply cooked until you barely move a whisk through the mixture.

I'm not a polenta fan but this was great. The entire menu complimented flavors perfectly. Made it for a wine-tasting dinner.

This is a delicious, impressive side dish. After reading about the troubles the other readers had in holding the wedges together, I decided to use stone-ground corn grits (polenta) instead of the corn meal. I also cooked the polenta closer to 10 minutes instead of the 6 called for in the recipe until it was quite thick. I then followed the rest of the directions to the letter. My wedges held their shape beautifully when reheated the next evening.

I tried this recipe for a dinner party although I am not a polenta fan and had to make it the next night for another party because it was so delicious and easy! Will definitley make it over the holidays!

Based on the picture of this dish on the October issue I did a dry run of this recipe to serve at a dinner party I throw every year during the holidays. I am really glad I did. This recipe is a disaster. I am an accomplished cook and this gave me fits. As others have stated it does not hold together even if it is made a day ahead and has plenty of time to set up. This one is not a keeper.

Rating: 4
This dish was fantastic & one of the best appetizer dishes I've found. Made for party of 15 & everyone absolutely loved it. Very easy and inexpensive to make. It is quite rich due to the butter & cheese so I would say it serves more than 8 as an appetizer by cutting into smaller pieces. (I doubled the recipe & spread into a rectangle baking dish). Will definitely make again.

I too had a problem with the polenta spreading all over the cookie sheet. flavor is delicious, a bit salty. how do I keep it from spreading?

The polenta in great. However the proportions are slightly incorrect as the triangles did not hold their form. It was also slightly salty although I did not add any additional salt. Maybe I will try different nuts or a different cheese.

I really enjoyed this dish. Is a great compliment to pork or poultry as a fall or winter dish. Has bursting flavor with the fresh rosemary. Substituted almonds for walnuts but used walnut as garnish.

I LOVED this recipe - but the proportions are off for it to be served as the recipe states. Between the cheese and the butter, the triangles do not maintain their shape to be reheated. So we wound up with some wonderful tasting heaps of polenta - not triangles! However, I will play with the recipe until I get it right!
