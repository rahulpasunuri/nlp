This was nothing I would make again at all - I threw the left overs out.

I thought it was great, make it a little spicier and it is great for a cookout with "some" beer

A great way to get the Thai coconut taste without the fat

You've got to be kidding.

I made this, but with so many changes it was no longer the original recipe... used low fat coconut milk instead of milk and coconut extract, and skipped the parsnips. It was really good!

the only thing i hate about thai is that yuo have to have coconut stuff, and it doesn't keep well after it is opened. it is a bit of a waste! otherwise i love it!!!

The chicken and rice were good, but instead of making the sauce I would rather just pour some cream of chicken soup over the dish. Are there any other ideas for a good sauce?

Sounds good, but the parsnips were too sweet. It was that type of meal where your wife gives you that smile that says-"Thanks for the Effort, don't do this one again".

Parsnips don't work well with this recipe - not good, would not make again!

I didn't like this dish at all. I think that he parsnips were too over bearing and made the dish not taste well. Would not make dish again.

I've made this several times, both in the oven and on the bbq. It's turned out great. I assume that the fourth ingredient is supposed to be 4 large cloves garlic. You can also substitute coconut milk for the milk and coconut if you don't mind the fat.
