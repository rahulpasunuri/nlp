Fantastic! I am Persian and it was my first time making this aash and it was definitely satisfying, even for my Iranian guests!

This was very satisfying and tasty. I used a couple of shortcuts and made parts ahead. I used a bag of mixed beans. I soaked them for 24 hours and that made the overall cooking time of the beans down to 60 minutes. I refrigerated that overnight. The next day I used 4 oz of cooked rice instead of raw and then added the herbs. This also gave me the time to actually made the garnish which is delicious. My total cook time day of was only about 35 minutes so it actually turned into a pretty fast and nutritious meal for a busy day.

Easy recipe if you plan ahead. Flavors are delicious, but subtle. Not overpowering. We substituted dried herbs for fresh and adjusted the amount accordingly. We also used fennel seeds for the tarragon and a combination of thyme and sage for the summer savory. We used Trader Joe's 7-bean bag instead all of the beans.

This soup was lighter in flavor and consistency than I expected but still very tasty. It took so long to cook though I got too tired to make the garnish and just added some fried shallots that I got from the asian market on top, and it was very good still.

Delicious! This was a very simple soup with a great depth of flavor. I used a non-MSG bullion soup base and I didn't get a chance to make the garnish. None the less this was a very satisfying soup. I will definitely make it again!
