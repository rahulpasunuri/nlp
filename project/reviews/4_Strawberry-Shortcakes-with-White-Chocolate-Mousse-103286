Great recipe. I've made this several times. Always very popular. The mousse was a bit runny, so next time I'll chill it a bit longer. Great for entertaining as everything can be made ahead.

These are absolutely WONDERFUL! I made a double batch for my family for Mother's Day (there were 6 of us, and I figured we'd have left-overs) and they were all gone in minutes! No one could stop eating them! They have a beautiful, flakey texture and really nice flavor. HIGHLY recommended! This is our new favorite shortcake recipe!

This is fabulous! Well worth every minute that it takes. I use Lindt white chocolate with coconut for the mousse. Perfect for entertaining. Everything can be made the day before and assembled just prior to serving.

This was simply delicious! The chocolate chunks in the shortcakes are an added bonus! Simple to make, but as my husband commented, "This tastes like a fancy restaurant dessert". I didn't have white chocolate for the mousse, so I used high quality milk chocolate and it was delicious. Will definitely make this one again!

I have used this site for many recipes and enjooyed them all (mostly) but never felt the desire to write a review. But this one really turned out great and my guests were astonished (no more than me since I'd never made a mousse before). Delicious. I may have rushed the mousse and not allowed it to cool enough, but that's my inexperience. A winner I'll make every strawberry season from now on.

I have made this recipe numerous times and it is always a hit. I don't usually make the white chocolate mousse, but the shortcake recipe is simple and quick to pull together and the chocolate chips make a nice addition to such a traditional spring dessert.

The chocolate in the shortcakes is great. I will make this again but be sure to keep the shortcakes @ 1/2" thickness. My husband now prefers white chocolate mousse to whipping cream! Very good.

The blend of the white chocolate and cream and strawberries is great in and of itself, but when you add the flecks of choclate into the shortcakes. . .delicious. I have made this a few times, and I absolutely love it. Plus, it is so so easy to make. Highly recommended.

Normally, I only enjoy desserts that involve decadent milk chocolate, but I thought this was delicious. I will definitely make it again; it is simple to prepare, looks very good and tastes great too. Next time, I will also make dark chocolate mousse and create a swirl with the white- then it would be 4 forks!

I never made "real" shortcakes before this recipe so I was excited to try this out. This recipe wasn't difficult just a bit time consuming. Everything tasted great and looked nice, too. I think I whipped my cream too much. My mousse wasn't exactly mousse as much as it was a curdlike white chocolately filling but it tasted good anyway!

This wasn't hard to make, but I thought it sounded a lot better than it tasted. We thought the mousse was too rich and that the strawberries would have tasted better with the shortcakes and some light whipped cream or cool whip. I served this to 4 people and no one finished their serving or asked for seconds! If you make the shortcakes, just spray your baking pan with baking spray: I didn't use parchment paper and didn't have any trouble.

Not only pretty presentation, but easy to make, and just delicious! Rave reviews!

Since we went strawberry picking today, I decided to make this recipe. It was incredible! Nothing beats the combination of chocolate and strawberries. I didn't have semi-sweet baking chocolate, so I substituted chocolate chips with good results. Be sure to use the parchment paper; I think the chocolate would stick.
