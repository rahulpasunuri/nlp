Easy to do if you stretch the process out over a couple of days (things need to be chilled in between anyway, so it makes sense to do it this way). I was worried that the filling wasn't set enough, because it was still runny, but after re-chilling all was good. Adding a raspberry on top of the glaze was a nice touch that impressed all.

I made it exactly as specified, added a mint leaf and a raspberry on top and everyone loved it. It wasn't too terribly time consuming either. Just a note, it is very important to whip the filling after chilling as this is what makes it thicker. Nothing extraordinary, but very good and simple...a definite keeper.

Although this is a little time consuming (it could be easily stretched out over several days), the end result is amazing. I actually forgot to do the last step (dipping the final tartlet in chocolate and they were still yummy. Instead I piped in some filling, squeezed in two or three raspberries, then more filling and then finished off with another berry, upside down. I got a very good compliment on these... These are New York City quality... YEA!!! If you want to look like a pro, go for these!

The filling does change from a liquid to a pipeable solid with chilling - I froze the filling and made this more of an ice cream dessert but it still did not come out well.
