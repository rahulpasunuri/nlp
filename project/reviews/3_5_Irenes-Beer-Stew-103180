I have made this a number of times and it is always great.

I have made many, many excellent recipes from Epicurious..... this isn't one of them. It's very bland and not worth the effort when there are so many amazing recipes for stew elsewhere.

This recipe totally saved my life when I realized it was St. Patrick's day and I wanted beef stew and I didn't have any beef stock. I almost gave up, but reading this recipe and learning you can just use beer (?!) saved the day. That being said, it did require a lot of seasoning and fidgeting, but I've got to rate it 5 forks out of the ingenuity of a tasty beef stew completely lacking in beef stock.

Delicious and easy. My husband and son polished off several helpings. To save time, I sauteed the onions separately while browning the meat. As the onions were turning lightly golden, I added a rounded teaspoon of sugar. For the sauce, I cut back the Worcesterhire sauce to 1T and the steak sauce to 1T. I added two bottles of beer and it didn't quite cover the meat. Next time I would use another half bottle of beer since I would like to have more sauce. Before putting it in the oven, I also added some sliced carrots. The meat was incredibly tender and the onions were delicious too. I will definitely be making this again soon. It is perfect fare for a cold winter evening.

This was a great winter-time/early spring dish. I used Yuengling (spelling?) beer and the flavor was great. Next time I won't add the ALL of the two beers, but maybe more like one and a half, as it was a little too much liquid. With about forty minutes of cooking time left I also added some carrots. They were cooked through, but still nice and bright when I brought the whole pot out of the oven. I will certainly be making this again! I think it would be nice with brown rise or egg noodles. I just had it plain. It is a bit more like a pot roast than an actual stew, fyi.

This has been a family favorite for years now. Great for cold winter days. It is a very hearty, thick stew, with great flavor by my tastes. I add carrots for the last hour of cooking and serve with mashed potatoes.

Ok. Not the best beef stew I've ever had, but not bad either. I threw in some portobella slices and a cup of beef broth. It was good on a cold winter day, but I want to try other beef/beer stew recipes to see if there's one I like better.

Horrifyingly bad. I found this to be flavorless.

I rate this recipe as a not really that good at all as a stew. It would be better fitting under the gravy recipes... If you make this recipe be ready for a gravy style, heavy and meaty tasting gravy, not stew. It is very much a northereners recipe. I would probably make it again as a side for my roast beef and potatoes...

This is a great recipe. I used a homebrewed stout -- and yes, you should counteract it with the optional brown sugar to taste. I also added carrots and celery 45 minutes before done and frozen peas about 5 minutes before done.

This was excellent. Boyfriend went crazy over it. I cooked red skin potatos, carrots, and frozen peas seperately and added during last hour of cooking. You can add what you like. Easy to double as well, freezes great, definitely best a couple of days old.

This was awesome! I do not like steak sauce, but I used A1 anyway. It then tasted too much like steak sauce, so I added another Tablespoon of soy, and Worchestershire. I used a little of the leftover flour to make a little roux that I stirred in before putting in the oven. I used part yellow onion, and some pearl onions. Made a day in advance, cooked about 2 hours, reheated for about an hour and a half, adding potatoes and carrots. This was really great.

I added a can of green chiles to the stew before I put it in the oven. Gave it a little kick, but not too much. Good advice on waiting 'till the next day to eat it. It was delicious!

I love this stew. Forget the baking method unless its frigid cold outside. The oven heats it up too much. I used a crock pot with outstanding results. Put carrots in at the last hour. Thickened slightly with flour at the end.

Easy to prepare....I used a crock pot to finish it off. Came out great!

I have prepared this twice. I have used both Harp and Bud. Both were good. I used lean chuck, not "stew beef." I added carrots before baking. I served this over extra wide egg noodles. My guests loved this recipe. With a green salad, and potato dill bread, you are "good to go." YUM!

Very good. I did add 2 more table spoon of soy sauce and sugar for more flavor. More vegetables the better...

i have been making this recipe since the day the magazine arrived in the mail. my family of picky eaters all agree the flavor is great! i used coors light, don't think the beer brand matters.

Rating: 4
Wonderful flavor. I used Corona Light which had a nice aroma. The only change I made was to add flour & beer in the last half hour as a thickener.

This is a great, basic stew recipe. I made it in the crockpot after browning everything on the stove. Added carrots, celery and turnips a few hours later, then mushrooms just before serving. I would increase the amount of seasoning next time, as I ended up with quite a bit of food in the pot. And I would also add a little cold water/flour mixture 20 minutes before serving to thicken it up.

this is a wonderful fall recipe. i've made it 3 times and still haven't managed to keep enough for leftovers. i always add more veggies to it. we have a large loaf of warm sourdough bread with it to soak up the gravy. it's great dish to take along to the snowmobile cabin too.

This was absolutely delicious, and I certainly would not hesitate to make it again, as it was a big hit. Make enough for leftovers!

In the words of my 13 year old son "This is the best stew Ive tasted" We cut down on the beer (we used a 375ml can) which didnt overpower the dish. We will certainly be having this again.

DEEE-LISH, but maybe I'm biased! My fiance gobbled it up twice, with rice and pasta to soak up the yummy sauce.

I followed this recipe to the letter. While I like to drink beer, and I expected to taste it in the stew, I found it too bitter. The rest of the recipe was very good - it made a rich gravy. I just couldn't get past the strong taste of beer in the final product.

Has anyone else tried this in the crock pot? I don't have an oven proof pot so once the meat was browned I threw everything into the crock pot. It was still good but I didn't get a rich gravy like some other reviewers described. Any thoughts?

We've made this stew twice now and it has been wonderful both times! Perfect for company or a potluck dinner, especially on a cold winter night. Great with crusty bread and dark beer.

I used two cans of Coors for this. All I gotta say is that you'd better like beer with this stew. It was pretty strong in my opinion and my boyfriend wouldn't eat it(not that that says too much since he won't eat half of what I cook anyway!)

Delicious just as is, but would be great with vegetables. Have lots of bread to soak up the extra gravy; it's superb!

Rating: 3
Superb! I couldn't get over how dark and gorgeous the gravy was in this dish, will definitely make again! I used Harp beer as well. I halved the recipe and I added carrots when I put it in the oven and served over egg noodles. My husband thought it needed more salt, I personally did not think so. Even my son ate it and he's such a picky 6 yr. old! This is so much better than my usual beef stew, but next time, I might add some more veggies, like a previous reviewer wrote.

This is the best beef stew I ever tasted! The onions cook down to a sweet, molten texture and the rich gravy is fantastic. I add carrots and/or turnip pieces when the stew goes in the oven.

Wonderful dish for a cold night! It does take all of 3 hours. This is a good recipe for 2 people to cook. We used more garlic and since we don't like steak sauce we increased the soy and worchestershire, added some carrots and mushrooms during the last hour. Used 2 bottles of Harp Ale, served over wide noodles. Nice complex flavor, perfect amount of "gravy", this is definitely a winner. Might add more vegetables next time.

This recipe takes every bit of the 3 hours to prepare. I used a 25 ounce can of Fosters Special Bitter and the stew didn't come out bitter (my husband was reluctant to have me use a microbrew because we didn't want it to be too bitter). I also followed the suggestions of other cooks such as adding carrots and mushroom and serving over egg noodles. My husband and I love this stew and I plan to make it again.

I didn't have a trusty beef stew recipe, so checking Epicurious.com, I found this fantastic one! I sauteed the onions with a bit of the brown sugar to carmellize them. It was a nice touch. I added sliced mushrooms during the last few minutes of cooking, which went well. It was a real hit! The gravy got real thick and tasty!

I don't know whether it was the beer I used or the oregano, but my stew seemed pretty bitter. However, I doctored it with about 1/4 cup of brown sugar to balance out the acidity. After that it was pretty good. Definitely filling. Although I wouldn't make it again soon, I suppose I will make it again eventually.

As a rookie chef and having the need to provide an evening meal twice a week to the family of my daughter with whom I recently began to reside with I was saved by your web site and my first effort was Irene's Beer Stew. I stuck strictly with the recipe and my back is still sore from all the congratulatory back slaps I received from the family. Terrific taste and the bit that was left over was even better for my lunch the next day

I added 4 sliced carrots but otherwise just followed the recipe. It was wonderful over egg noodles and it does keep and freeze well. Thanks Irene!
