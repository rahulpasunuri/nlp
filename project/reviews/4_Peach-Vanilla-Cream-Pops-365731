These were yummy. I used Truvia vs. sugar w/no ill effect. I didn't strain the puree from the blender, just added proportionately more of everything else.

Delicious! I didn't have ice-pop sticks on hand, so I ran the chilled puree through my ice cream maker and it turned out great. Making it again today!!

Sooooooo delicious. I forgot to grab my vanilla bean before I left (didn't make them at home), so I had to use a good liquid vanilla, and it was still wonderful. We used frozen peaches we'd picked last summer - very flavorful! Most people couldn't eat just one.

Ok, so I really enjoyed the flavor of these! The icy texture however left something to be desired. I'm not sure if that resulted because everything was essentially liquid? I wonder if having a strainer will slightly larger holes (or not straining at all) would've helped give it more body and substance..but they do call for a fine-mesh strainer. Anyone else have this problem? Any suggestions on how to fix it?
