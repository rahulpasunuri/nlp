I have a variation on this recipe that I use with brussel sprouts. Self-proclaimed brussel sprout haters love this recipe. It is 1/2 cup olive oil, 1/3 cup white wine vinegar, a tsp of molasses, and 1 tbl of dijon mustard (I usually use a smidge more). The amounts vary a bit every time I make it, but it is always a hit. Happy cooking!

There's no subtlety to the sauce. The large amount of sugar prevents the dijon mustard from imparting any 'bite' the beans. A quarter cup of sauce would have been sufficient - the recipe makes over a cup of it. Perhaps my distaste for honey mustard dressing colors my review.

The sauce is terrific, altho I agree that cutting it in half makes more than enough. I also use the sauce for asparagus--nice change from the usual vinagrette!

This was a nice surprise. I made it for company and everyone raved. I found there was plenty of sauce. I think next time I would cut the recipe in half, or refrigerate the extra sauce and have it again in a couple of days.

So easy and delicious. I served this for Easter dinner alongside roasted potatoes and a boneless pork loin. It does make extra sauce - but it is so good you'll want to run out and buy more green beans!

WOWIE WOW WOW! This was delish! a sweet and sour kind of flavor, perfect for this. It is much better than just having boring green beans on the side. I only made half the amount of sauce that is said and still had leftovers. I used about a pound of beans. very tasty and not too tough! *:)*

Great recipe! I have made this many times with wonderful reviews. This is excellent with steak because the mustard sauce works well with both beans and steak.

I loved this recipie, as did my parents and brothers. I went with the advice and did not add as many ingredients to the sauce though. Many compliments.

This is a nice way to serve green beans. I served it at a dinner for ten and it was raved about. I highly recommend this dish though I listened to other reviewers and cut the mustard sauce in half.

I actually roasted the green beans and then I poured some of the sauce over them. It was delicious. I only made half a recipe of sauce and there is still plenty left over. I really would like to roast a bunch of fresh veggies and then toss them in a salad with this sauce as the dressing. It would be delicious.

Great flavor in this sauce, would also be good as a salad dressing. Everyone else is right, it made a lot!

This is a great sauce and not just for green beans. It's delicious with meat as well, which is good since it certainly makes a lot!

The mustard sauce goes very well with the green beans... but it sure makes a lot of sauce. Not that having extra is usually a problem, but hey.
