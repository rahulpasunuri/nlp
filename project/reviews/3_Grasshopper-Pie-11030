I made this and it turned out really good. One note though if you have not worked with gelatin before. The recipe says to sprinkle the gelatin on top of the cream and let stand for 5 minutes. I did this and the top of the cream turned into a hard crust that could not be dissolved back into the cream or blended. I started with a new batch of cream and mixed the gelatin powder in right away - then it worked like a charm. Not sure what method author is using but do not let sprinkle it and let it sit - it will form a crust. Otherwise, yummy recipe!!

While it definitely doesn't make "30 cakes", it does make a delightful summery pie that is always a hit with my friends and family. It's always gone in a flash at large gatherings, with many recipe requests from people who taste it. I prefer this version to the one with marshamallows.

Why does it say "Makes 30 cakes" at the top? Does anybody copywrite this stuff?

Umm....don't know what I did wrong, but it had a medicinal smell, and a funny consistency, and it was edible, but would have been easier and tastier to just throw some mint chip ice cream in the oreo crust. Next time I'll just go with what I already know....

I made this for my son's teacher, who said his grandmother used to make it. It came out fine, good texture, like any bavarian, mint flavor was mild. Topped it with green chocolate dragonflies & grated chocolate (couldn't find a grasshopper mold!) teacher was happy!

Followed the recipe to the letter and ended up with a rubbery pie with an odd mouth wash taste that eminates from the creme de menthe and smothers the creme de cacao. There was no chemistry with the chocolate wafer crust. I am told a much better grasshopper pie is to be made with mint chocolate chip ice cream.

I made this for my boyfriend, whose favorite desserts include mint and chocolate--mine don't really. I decreased the creme de menthe just slightly because it seemed like a bit too much. Also used pre-made oreo crust, which was great. He loved this recipe!

This is a great, traditional way to make GP. It's the best I've ever tasted.

I made this and it turned out wonderfully, although I absolutely LOVE Grasshopper pie! I used this recipe since I don´t have marshmallows, which I usually used according to Betty Crocker. Anyhoo, it clearly says where to use the sugar, but maybe they have corrected the recipe since the previous reviewer pointed it out...

I would not recommend using this particular recipe. Mine did not come out too well. Be careful, the recipe calls for sugar, but does not say when to add it.

I used a pre-made Oreo crust. The pie very creamy and a nice summer dessert.
