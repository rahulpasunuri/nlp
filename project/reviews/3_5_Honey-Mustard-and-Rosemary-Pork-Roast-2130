Easy enough but I would back the honey down next time by at least half. It was too sweet. I used a good quality dark beer (21st Ammendment), 365 organic honey, spicy dijon... and it was just too sweet for me. If you're not a person with much of a sweet tooth, like me, you might consider doing the same.

Unf!! Sauce was A-OK, but this recipe really shone as a marinade/brine. Not wanting to use a plastic bag to marinate the meat, I doubled the recipe so as to (mostly) submerge it, & turned it several times over the course of the half-day I let it soak. Per many other reviews, I used only 1/3 - 1/2 the honey, which was a good call. Despite dialing back the honey, it resulted in a gorgeously caramelized surface on the roast, and the interior was meltingly tender. I used a grainy dijon, and some of the mustard grains and bits of chopped rosemary adhered to the surface of the roast. Anchor Brewery's Brekle's Brown complimented the other flavors well. That thang was purty, and yielded many oooh and ahhs when it was ready to carve!

I rarely follow recipes to the letter, but this only had a handful of ingredients and I had them all. It was absolutely amazing. The only thing I didn't do was strain the marinade before adding the drippings and whipped cream and boiling - who doesn't like little bits of garlic and rosemary in their gravy? It was absolutely spectacular.

Not my favorite recipe for pork roast. Maybe I am just not a mustard fan. Agree fresh rosemary would have helped.

Delicious! Didn't save enough time to make the roast, so sliced into pork chops, marinated for a half hour then grilled. It was fantastic. Also didn't strain the sauce. I would for guests though.

Delicious. Used Sierra Nevada's Tumbler, which was great for flavor in this mix. I did brown the roast before putting in the oven for 55 minutes, but otherwise, my 2.75lb roast was cooked as directed and was tender and flavorful. I do not think the honey is too much, I just think it probably depends on the sweetness of your beer and the strength of your mustard.

Addendum: Yes, what to do with the cream is in the recipe, I overlooked it and the sauce still came out thick and delicious.

Absolutely delicious, moist and tender. I didn't use the whipping cream (the recipe doesn't even say what to do with it) and I browned the pork roast in a dutch oven, put in the other ingredients and cooked it right in the dutch oven at 350 for 55 minutes. The sauce cooked down perfectly and the pork was incredible. My husband is not wild about pork, but he LOVED this recipe.

This was soooo easy and delicious! I subbed maple syrup for the honey b/c I was out, used creole mustard and an amber lager for the beer. I marinated one hour and roasting took a little over the 55 minutes suggested. My husband and I ate the 2 lb pork loin all by ourselves in one sitting! Mmmmm....

This very simple to make & wonderfully delicious! Whole family loved it, including picky kiddos. I made two changes per other posters...I used sage instead of rosemary & half/half instead of whipping cream. Turned out beautifully! Had hoped for a nice, dark beer, but used a Heineken which worked well. Also used the old fashioned dijon with seeds. The flavors worked so well together. Definite keeper in our family!

Rating: 3
Followed others suggestions and decreased honey by a 3rd and didn't find it too sweet. I didn't have whipping cream (used homo), so used a little floor (shook it the milk in a container before adding) just take sure it was thick enough. But I'm sure the cream would have been lovely. I made the gravy right in the dish I cooked the pork, so didn't have to work to scrape the drippings. Does mean you have to stir more often. Marinated the meat all day and it was very moist. Will certainly make again as economical (will serve family of 4 two meals) and easy.

Not pleased with the sauce. Very sweet. I had read former reviews and cut way back on the honey and it was still too sweet. No depth of flavor. Tasted like sweetened dijon mustard. Ick. Roast was very tender.

Rating: 4
It was a little sweet. Might put in less honey next time but thought it was great. To speed up the cooking time of the sauce I started cooking down the marinade while the meat was cooking and it got really thick. The pan juices that I deglazed with some extra beer brought the sauce to a great thickness.

Rating: 4
I'm giving this one four forks for a family pleasing meal that's easy on the cook: ready ingredients and simple prep. I didn't marinade the meat as long as called for, just dredged it in the marinade before sticking it in the oven, and it came nicely browned, tender and tasty. Recipe calls for baking meat on a a rack. Only snafu for me: my drippings dried out underneath the pork, and I had to add water to save them. This may have made the sauce thinner than it would have been; thick enough though, and really good IMO. Try it!

Rating: 2
I did not like the pork or the sauce, my husband thought it was great...so I give it two forks. I used dried rosemary because I wanted to use up some that I had on hand, and if I ever try it again I will use fresh with less honey. I used a local microbrew ale and I'm wondering if that was part of the problem, the flavors just did not complement each other.

Rating: 3
This was definitely pretty tasty. I used a whole grain mustard, which gave the roast a nice texture. For beer I used Newcastle for that dark, balanced flavor. While roasting the pork, I also added baby red potatoes, onions, and brussel sprouts to the pan. Super tasty with the gravy spooned over (I had to add flour to help it thicken, and splashed some more beer and chicken stock).

mmmm, this sauce was so rich; I deglazed the roaster with about another 1/4 cup beer so the sauce didn't thicken enough even after 15 min., so added about 2 tsp cornstarch. Sandra McNally Calgary/Panama

This was delish. They gobbled it up at home. I didn't use honey used agave nectar and brown sugar and used sage instead of rosemary after reading so many negative reviews about it. Also for the beer I used Becks which worked out well.

Dynamite easy recipe. I adjusted as follows for speed and nutrition: I did not create this marinade until right before I cooked the roast. I mixed it up (substituting Agave sweetener...just like honey but does NOT spike your insulin the same way!!) and cooked the roast in it the whole baking time, occasionally spooning the marinade over the roast, every 10 minutes or so. FANTASTIC. I did NOT use whipping cream. At. All. Simply sliced and served. IT WAS GREAT, my husband concurred.

Delicious and incredibly easy. I've always avoided making pork because it's always dry and over cooked. My farmer butcher talked me into trying a pork roast - this recipe was easy, delicious and i even used the marinade on 6 lamb chops on the grill for the same dinner party. Scrumptious!

Very good dish, easy to prepare, although it took longer to bake than 55 minutes and I cooked it to 145 degrees. It came out perfect and the sauce was delicious. The only change I made was I used white wine in place of the beer.

Easy prep and delicious results. This is also a great family pleaser or a simple dish for entertaining. The pork roast I used was quite lean and I found that it needed some additional moisure while in the oven. Save the extra beer to add to pan once it's started browing. I didn't realize this and didn't have any more beer so used about 1/3 cup of apple juice instead and both the roast and pan drippings turned out wonderfully.

Rating: 3
This was pretty good - I cooked the meat until the thermometer was 135 and then took it out and let the meat rest and the temp went up to 145 after 10 minutes of resting and it was medium which my family prefers over well-done. I used the dried rosemary and would not recommend it unless it is fresh-it did not go well with the other flavors. Next time I may use brown sugar instead of the honey as others have suggested. Also, I would probably sear the pork first and put salt and pepper on it before cooking, as this gives it a nice crispy texture on the outside.

Rating: 4
This was a great recipe, but made even better with a few modifications. I used brown deli mustard instead of dijon--gave a richer and more robust sauce. I didn't like it so sweet, so I used 1 T brown sugar in place of the honey. This is a hit with the family.

This was sensational. I marinated overnight. Added potato wedges mixed in the marinade and roasted underneath the pork loin. This left me with less marinade for the sauce, so I reduced the amount of cream to only 1 or 2 tablespoons.

Made last night after reading many good reviews and halved the amount of honey after reading that the sauce came out too sweet. I followed the recipe exactly for the other ingredients and my sauce came out TERRIBLE and had to be thrown out! It was very bitter, which could have something to do with the kind of beer I used - Redhook Longhammer. Be careful with the beer you choose...some just do not work in this dish!! Thankfully the pork did not have the bitter aftertaste of the sauce and was very tender. Served the pork with a delicious caramelized pear sauce instead thanks to the chef friend I had invited to dinner.

This dish was a huge hit for a 40th birthday dinner for a friend and his family. I had some minor deviations: I added more garlic, as well as 3 big shallots, to the marinade. I started the oven off at 425 degrees to create a seared crust, then dropped back to 350. When I dropped the temp I added 1 can of low-salt chicken broth so we could make gravy, and used a bit more to deglaze the pan. I also spooned the remaining marinade over the roast after about 40 minutes for extra flavor, 'cause it smelled so wonderful cooking! I'll definitely make this again. It's already been requested for an upcoming holiday visit.

i only had 45 minutes to marinate. It still tasted incrediable! My pork roast was still a bit frozen in the center so I cooked it 15 minutes more...just sweet as could be. I strained the ground fresh rosemary out of the sauce after the reduction, then added 1/4 cup cream & juices from roast. (Pan had nothing in it, but blackeden cooked in drippings). My 3 year old, 9 year old, husband & father-in-law all loved the meal!

Lovely and simple. I had no heavy cream and intended to use the reduced marinade as sauce, but had about 1/2 cup Quark (like a German yogurt cheese, not lowfat)in the fridge, so I used that.

Other side dishes were sweet and sour red cabbage, warm German potato salad, and homemede dark rye bread.

This dish was succulent and delicious, perfectly cooked (thanks to my trusty meat thermometer). I forgot to marinate the pork ahead, so I just baked it in a small enough pan that the marinade covered most of the roast, and basted it a few times during cooking.

Have made this several times, finding it easy, flavourful and well-liked. I, too, reduce the honey by half, but this is obviously a matter of individual taste. The recipe is great as is, but also flexible, and differing degrees of flavour can be achieved by using different types of mustard and/or beer. I also find that roasting on a rack with a pan underneath, rather than having the meat on rack inside a pan produces more even, thorough, cooking while leaving the meat juicy. I also marinate in a plastic bag. Honey can also be substituted wholely or in part with corn syrup, molasses, etc.

I've made this dish 3 times with slight variations. The first was the best....I had no Dijon mustard and used Frenches yellow....also, I didn't have time to marinate it overnight in the fridge so, I marinated for about 4 hours mostly on the kitchen counter......IT WAS FABULOUS. THE SECOND TIME I USED A COMBINATION DIJON/HONEY PRODUCT AND MARINATED IT OVERNIGHT........GOOD, BUT, NOT AT ALL AS GOOD AS THE FIRST. The 3rd time, yesterday, I made it exactly following the recipe, marinating it over night in the fridge........GOOD, BUT THE FIRST TIME IT HAD MUCH MORE TASTE!!! Moral of the story is that if you don't have the absolutely correct ingredients it doesn't hurt to experiment! I usually make the recipe as called for first and THEN experiment and revise...FUN.

I use this recipe (using tenderloin instead of a loin roast) as the marinade and later made the sauce which I doubled the mustard and halfed the honey. After I marinaded the pork overnight (using wine instead of beer), I followed another recipe on this site (Pork with Herbed Breadcrumbed Crust) for the breading and baking method and adjusted the baking time accordingly. I also followed a lot of the recommendations on the Breadcrumb recipe such as coating the pork with mustard prior to rolling in crumbs and using seasoned breadcrumbs instead of plain. This combination of recipes makes for a SPECTACULAR dish with an elegant presentation with the mustard sauce on the side! I made this for a family function and my Mom (who is an incredible cook) said it was the best pork loin she's had (and I grew up on a farm with plentiful beef and pork.) My "doctored-up" recipe has been requested by many!

170 is not necessary for an internal tempature for pork, according to the pork advisory council's website. I always cook pork tenderloin and other lean cuts to 155 internal to avoid over cooking. I've been cooking for years both personally and professionally and have never had a problem. If the pork advisory council doesn't know, then who does? http://www.otherwhitemeat.com: To ensure juicy, tender results, lean pork cuts should be cooked to medium doneness - 160 degrees F. For small cuts - chops, kabobs, burgers - use time guidelines and cook until nicely browned, turning once. Use a meat thermometer to judge the doneness of roasts. When the internal temperature reaches 150-155 degrees F., remove meat and let stand for 10 minutes. The meat's internal temperature will rise about 5 degrees after cooking. For large, less tender cuts like ribs and pork shoulder (Boston Butt), cook slowly follow time guidelines until meat is fork-tender

The sauce is definitely too sweet, I wish I had read the reviews before making it. However, the meat itself was very flavorful, and definitely good for sandwiches. Will try next time cutting down the honey. Also struck a happy medium and cooked to 160, it was tender and jucy.

This recipe was unique due to several factors - Beer (as well as mustard) has as many variations as wine and a lot depends on what types of beer and mustard you use- I used a pilsner that was very blonde and light (not light in calories but in color.) The mustard was a sharp Dijon and was a bit too pungent in my opinion - I had reservations about this mustard but used it anyway. I cooked the roast longer than the suggested time which was wise - it needed it. I served it with mashed garlic potatoes and roasted asperagus, nice. I would make it again using a different mustard and substitute a dry, white wine for the beer- The sauce would be nicer with wine as its base as apposed to beer. Go ahead and give this one a try-

The meat was delicious but the sauce was not. It was way too sweet!!! (I made the recipe as is). Also, there was too much rosemary in it for my taste. I would probably try this recipe again but use half the amount of honey and half the amount of rosemary. Also, cooking pork to less than 170 deg. is dangerous! I can't believe this was suggested. I cooked it using a meat thermometer to 170 and it was perfect. Hasn't anyone heard of trichomonas????? And resting the roast for 15 minutes will simply not do it.

I made this recipe over the holidays for my family and they loved it. I followed the advice of an earlier reviewer and seared the meat for 20 minutes at 450 degrees before reducing the oven to 350. As with all marinade recipes I find, I poked holes in the meat and used the ziploc bag method. I also cut up potatoes and carrots and cooked them along with the pork. They were excellent, especially the carrots. I will add more of them next time and try marinating them. I will also try the recipe with a little less honey.

I heeded everyone's advice about the sauce being overly sweet. I believe that I hit the right proportion. I made 1-1/2 times the recipe but only used 4T. of honey. It tasted perfect. Wouldn't exchange apple juice for the beer. It would take away from the flavor. As a few others stated, I also didn't have any pan drippings to add to the sauce. It might be that the recipe was written for using a convection oven because the cooking time was right on for me. Also it's very important that you let the roast rest. During carry over cooking the temp could rise another 10 degrees making it perfectly done. Going to try with chicken or pork tenderloin next time. Thumbs up on this one!

This one has been a hit every time I have tried it. It also works very well for chicken on the grill. I have had nothing but rave reviews. Fresh rosemary really helps.

I agree with some of the other cooks. The sauce was way too sweet and I even cut the honey in half. Yuk. Don't waste your time with this one.

Of all the recipes I have tried on Epicurious, this is the only one I have felt lukewarm about. The cooking time was really off. The roast was good but not exceptional, and the sauce really did nothing for me.

This dish was wonderful. My family loved it! I servered it with a garnish of broccoli florets, french style green beans, and mashed potatoes with sourcream, bacon bits, cheese and chives. I have already been informed that I must make it again.

What a disappointment after all the rave reviews ! This recipe was way too sweet, despite halving the amount of honey. And as another reviewer mentioned, the cooking time was WAY out. We had to cook this for almost 40 mins longer than specified. Annoying when you have hungry people waiting to eat & side dishes to prepare on time. There was virtually nothing in the way of pan drippings to add to the sauce as these had caramelized on the bottom of the roasting pan. It was an easy recipe to prepare but not one that we'll be trying again.

Although the pork itself was delicious, moist and well-flavored, the accompanying sauce was far too sweet. The honey overwhelmed the dish.

The pork roast had a nice flavor from the marinade but I found the sauce to be too sweet. I also found that the cooking time should be increased atleast another 30 minutes. We like this dish but it's not one we will be hurrying to repeat.

This dish was delicious! The sauce was a nice change from everyday gravy! Served it with Potatoes with Carmalized Onions and Chevre from this website. The different flavours complimented each other well. Found Pork required more cooking time than 55 min though.

Absolutely loved this! The sauce was heavenly. Did substitute apple juice for the beer - and added in a little fresh thyme and sage which I grow indoors during the winter months.

This is one of my husband's favorite recipes. I would agree that the sauce can be a little too sweet for some tastes. This is one of the those great recipes that I place in a Ziploc bag in the fridge on Sunday so that when I arrive home on Monday from work, I just pop into the oven. A good way to start the week.

Rich, satisfying, juicy. I added fresh horseradish and extra rosemary to cut the sweet and give it a kick. Another fantastic addition was little baby red and white potatoes, cut in half, and roasted with some of the sauce and the pork. They took a good hour to cook. The pork roast was seared in a 450 degrees oven in the beginning, and then turned down. All was served with chilled, chunky, cinnamon apple sauce, and steamed brocolli. Yummie, yummie.

This was really delicious and easy. Cooked the roast for over an hour.

Served for a dinner party and it was a hit. Made the gravy with a stout beer which overpowered the mustard and the honey a bit. While the gravy was a rich brown colour, I think I will try with a lighter beer. The roast was in the oven for 1 hr and 15 min and was still quite pink. Leftovers were excellent on toast with the gravy!

Loved this recipe. So simple and yet so delicious. The sauce was great with little extra work involved,just reducing and adding cream, so much better then making complicated, time consuming gravies that no one touches. I brought leftovers to work the next day and everyone is still raving.

I made as written. The pork was moist but the sauce was too sweet, tossed the sauce and served the rest of the roast with the balsamic cranberry sauce.

I have made this recipe (using 1-2 cups of apple juice instead of beer) at least 6 or 7 times, and it has been a smash every time. The pork always comes out moist, tender and flavorful. The sauce is unbelieveable! I had to increase the reduction time substantially, though. This recipe is also so easy to make. I just add mashed potatoes and a green vegetable. now I'm going to have to try it using beer.

This dish is so easy to prepare and comes out tasting really good. I made it one night for company and got rave reviews. I took the suggestion and did the marinating in a ziplock bag and left the recipe as it was in respect to the ingredients. We did not find the sauce too sweet as did some of the other reviewers. The blend of sweet and savory was just right.

It was delicious. However the next time I make it I think a bit less Rosemary would be preferable...for some reason it overpowered our first try at this recipe.

Instead of a glass dish, I used a Zip lock bag and took all the air out it I could. The marinade left the meat moist and delicious. There is no question that we would make this recipe again. In fact, I have two other friends at work that have made it after myself.

Is it just me, or did anybody else find the sauce overly sweet? I had to add extra cream and spices to tone it down. The pork, however, was very good, although it took much longer to cook than the recipe indicated. I'll probably make this again, but cut down on the honey. Six tablespoons is way tto much.

Rating: 4
The sauce is excellent and easy to prepare. I don't strain out the rosemary and garlic. I've served this for Christmas dinner and for a large dinner party where I doubled the marinade and used two pork roasts. To make a compete meal, I add new potatoes and carrots to the roasting pan. The carmelized veggies go well with the sauce.

Rating: 2
This was easy and fun and easy to prepare. I used two pork tenderloins because they are easier and less fatty, and they grill well. Only additions: after tasting sauce, added salt and pepper and a little marsala wine to punch it up. But the whole family enjoyed it.

As an expat living in Japan, I love great American recipies. I couldn't get a pork loin here (too expensive), but pork tenderloin is dirt cheap, so I used that (2 1lb pieces). I cut the roast into medallions after cooking, and drizzled with the sauce. I took this dish to a friends potluck, where the remainder of the sauce was used for dipping, and the folk there were BLOWN AWAY. Please expect increased traffic from Japan on your website!

All of my family loved this-esp. kids! I used honey dijon mustard the second time, as I too found 6 tbsp's of honey a bit too sweet-it was perfect!

Thought this was a very good recipe. I made it in the crock pot(!), and it did turn out very well. Everyone raved about it. And my guest did think that it was a keeper. I did leave out the oil in the marinade since I used the marinade for cooking the meat in the crock pot.

Absolutely delicious!..... Drippings were key to gravy. Taste was spectacular. Needs to be at 160 degrees.

Fantastic, and easy to make. Ran out of cream and had to use half and half instead...it worked fine. Don't know about substituting apple juice for the beer though. I think that would change the flavor considerably.

The pork was delicious. I saved calories by not making gravy and we enjoyed its flavor very much.

I'm not sure I can say I actually made this recipe. I used reviews to alter it to what I wanted. I made this for country ribs which I baked in the oven instead of grilling, but grilling would probably be good too! I substituted the apple juice in for the beer and since I did not have any honey, I used an equal amount of brown sugar. MMmmm-mmm! Because of the brown sugar, I did not have to finish the sauce with the cream b/c it was plenty thick enough. My husband even spooned the sauce over the rice I made along side! I will definitely use this one again! I may even make it according to the recipe next time and use a pork loin!

I made this recipe and used apple juice instead of beer. I also added thyme as mentioned in another review. I found the taste of apple juice and garlic too strong. Overall, it is a good recipe for roasted pork and I would highly recommend it.

Rating: 4
Delicious! In order to prevent it from drying out, I took it out when the middle was SLIGHTLY pink and let it rest for about 10 minutes. It finished cooking perfectly and was extremely moist. The sauce is great and easy too, but if you didn't want to bother, the meat is fantastic alone. Also, I put my frozen loin in the marinade in the AM and it was perfect by the time I got home from work.

We loved this recipe! I served it New Years Day with Horseradish Mashed Potatoes, and Green Beans and Red Bell Peppers, and my husband said it was the best meal I ever made. Not only was it easy to do, it was delicious! However, I did cook the roast to 165, because 150 did seem rare to me also.

This was terrific. My new favorite recipe for pork roast. However, I cooked the roast to 160-165, because 150 seemed a bit too rare for pork. I had no problem with it being overdone. It also reheated very well. I stored the remaining meat in the sauce and microwaved it. It tasted just as good the second time.

I used apple cider instead of beer, half and half instead of cream and fresh rosemary. The roast was marinated for 24 hours in a zip lock bag. Sauce was superb, a subtle blend of ingredients. I will definitely make this recipe again, it was easy and delicious.

I love the beer-honey-mustard combination, but this recipe calls for too much honey! You can cut it down to half and get wonderful results. As for replacing the beer with apple juice - it might be good, but I think the flavor would be VERY different.

My husband printed out this recipe but not the reviews. I wish I would have had them as I used beer and think the apple juice would have been a better alternative. As it was, it was kind of a bland marinate. Going to try again though, liked the dried fruit add.

Rating: 4
I took this recipe one step further and stuffed the pork roast with dried fruit. Take a knife and make a slash through the middle of the roast and then, with a long handle of a wooden spoon, insert pieces of the dried fruit down the length of the roast e.g.: pears,apricots, prunes. The plate presentation is really nice when the roast is cut. Sauce the plate and lay the pieces of the roast over the sauce. I am a professional chef and have gotten nothing but rave comments on this adaptation.

Recommended substitutions: 1. 2 cups Apple juice instead of 3/4 cup beer. 2. Dijon mustard with white wine (Grey Poupon) instead of plain Dijon. 3. Use olive oil that has had cloves of garlic in it for added flavor. 4. Add 2 tablespoons of Thyme and Sage. 5. Cook for the first 20 minutes at 500* to sear the outside and seal in the juices, then cool oven temp. to 350* and continue baking. 6. Baste frequently (approx. every 20-25 minutes). Was able to reheat leftovers several days later and still recieved rave reveiws.

This recipe is marvelous. We did cook it on the barbeque over a medium heat until the meat was white. For the sauce, we were unable to use the drippings but it still had a wonderful taste! ...even my timid eater wanted seconds.

I thought this recipe was very easy to make, and would be a good "Company" dish. My husband and I thought it was wonderful. I used Grey Poupon Honey Dijon Mustard, instead of the regular, because we don't like anything too sharp. It was great.
