Really difficult to make and very time consuming. And, unfortunately...very dry in the end. But, that is often the problem with Kosher for Passover desserts.

I made this over Passover for my stepmom's birthday. It was VERY time consuming and, unfortunately, it was pretty dry. Passover cakes are notorious for being dry and while this wasn't over-the-top dry, it was too close considering the trouble and prep time.

I was dubious, but proved wrong. This is a GREAT recipe and would stand up anytime, passover or other... A big hit

Make it with 6 oz ground hazelnuts instead of pecans, and frost it with the glaze recommended for the hazelnut torte in the same group of recipes (it will firm up enough to spread if you refrigerate it for 1/2 hour or so) and you've got the star outstanding dessert at my Passover seders for several years running. I think I'd be un-invited if I declined to make this for my hostess.
