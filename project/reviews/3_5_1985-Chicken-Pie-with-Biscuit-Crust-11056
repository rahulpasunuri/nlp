I was attracted by the nutmeg seasoning, which I thought might please my son, M.Ego. (He reviews my meals like the character in Ratatouille) I tweaked a few things-- used sweet corn and peas, omitted the celery, and added crumbled sage to the filling. Happily, he was pleased, and I will be making this again

Excellent! I added green beans instead of the potatoes as another poster suggested and I doubled it so I had one for the freezer. I used frozen biscuits in the bag and they were just fine and easy. This is a keeper.

A GREAT chicken pot pie! I made it for dinner today and my guys all went back for seconds (good thing I doubled the recipe.) I ran out of shortening, so I used all butter in the biscuits. They were fine, just a bit chewier than usual - but no one complained. This recipe is a family favorite.

I've been making this many years -- it's always delicious and a big hit. I find the combo of the potatoes and the biscuits a bit too starchy -- I omit the potatoes, and fold in 1/2 to 3/4 of a box of frozen peas when combining the sauce/chicken/carrots & celery.

This is excellent. We love the biscuits and I make them for breakfast now. FYI I have learned not to touch the dough or pat it down. I scoop the dough out with a spoon and drop it in lumps on the baking sheet. This way your hands dont warm up the butter and you wont loose the fluff in your biscuits

A perfect cold evening's dinner. I substitute mushrooms for the potatoes and usually add leeks, peas, or whatever I have that seems a good accompaniment. Very satisfying.

I've been making this recipe for about 2 years. I double the recipe,add frozen corn and use puff pasty. I freeze most of the pies. I cook for 15min @ 400, or just long enough that the pasty is brown. Cover with foil, then 40-50min @ 350. Just as good as fresh! Depending what veggies I have on hand, I sometimes add leek, mushrooms, zucchini...but always use carrots and potatoes. One of our favorites!

I hesitate to suggest a major change to a twenty-one-year-old classic, but one option for the time-pressed cook is to make the filling, put it in a shallow buttered baking dish, and cover it with a sheet of defrosted puff pastry (from the grocery store freezer), cut a little larger than the baking dish so it covers completely. The result is delectable. Like many stews, the filling is even better made a day or two in advance. Leftovers with the puff pastry crust reheat beautifully (cover loosely with foil).

This chicken pie recipe is to die for! I like that this version is lighter than most, with a flavorful, broth-based filling that does not rely on heavy cream. I added peas to the vegetable mixture and two minced garlic gloves with the onion for extra flavor. This dish does take some time to prepare, but is well worth-it. It makes for an excellent Sunday dinner. Highly recommended!

YUM! Have made this several times, first time it was too dry, not enough liquid. 2nd time I added an extra cup or two of broth and also halved the butter and flour. I did end up having to thicken the sauce with a bit of cornstarch but got the same great flavor with a lot less fat. Added a couple of minced cloves of garlic with the onions and also a little cayenne pepper with the nutmeg. Jazzed it up just enough for our taste. It is a bit of work but I usually make the filling early in the day or the night before, and generally make this only when I have leftover cooked chicken on hand. My whole family ADORES the biscuit recipe and I often make them by themselves for brunch etc. Drop biscuits would be easier but my little ones love to roll and cut. If I was making the pie for a dinner party I would probably double the biscuit recipe to cover and maybe add a few chives or other fresh herbs to the dough.

I absolutely love this recipe, as does my husband. When I first started making it two years ago, I also thought it was too time consuming and finicky to make very often. With a few modifications to the prep, I now do this dish in one pot and 1 bowl, like the cook from Fort Worth. I don't peel my veggies either, and I keep prepared stock in my freezer. I sautee chicken while cutting up the veggies, then add them to the pot along with the broth and seasonings. I let that simmer for 15 minutes, thicken the broth with flour and a little water, top with the cheese biscuits (changed to drop biscuit consistency) and bake. Fantastic, and with the snow, yes snow that's falling outside my window right now, I'm looking forward to warming my tummy with this tonight!

This is a fabulous dish - very hearty and satisfying. The flavors are perfect. I also add frozen peas for color and flavor, too. I recommend using another biscuit recipe (on Epicurious - note made in reviews) for the topping, as it is particularly delicious and there is enough to cover the whole pot pie. Wonderful!

This was absolutely delicious. I will definitely be making this again. Next time, though, I think I will add peas to the veggies. I will also double the biscuit recipe so that the whole dish will be covered.

This was awesome! I made a couple mods but generally followed the recipe as written. I sauteed some cubed chicken breast which had been lightly coated in flour seasoned with poultry seasoning, salt and pepper. I cut the amount of flour used in the roux to 2 T due to the coating of flour on the chicken. I left out the nutmeg because I didn't have any but I didn't miss it because of the nutmeg and other spices in the poultry seasoning. I also added some half and half to the filling. Since I got such a late start at preparing this I used Bisquick mix prepared according to the directions on the box. Instead of cutting out the biscuits, I put the whole sheet of rolled dough in the pan over the filling. I baked it in a stoneware fluted bundt pan and it made for a nice presentation. My husband said this was the best chicken pie he had ever had.

I used store bought rotisserie chicken and ready-made pie crust - this recipe took a little over an hour to prepare and was absolutely delicious.

Delicious! I think next time I would add a little milk or light cream (1/2-1 cup)to the sauce to enrich just a bit. I also added peas for color and taste. I took another reviewer's suggestion and lowered oven temp. to 425. Allowed chicken mixture to heat for about 15 minutes until starting to bubble then added the biscuits. The biscuits were really brown after about 10 minutes so I toppped with a piece of foil and continued to cook 5-7 more minutes until the biscuits were completely done. Perfect. Everyone (including children) loved the dish. It was just what I was looking for in a pot pie.

I make a lot of dinners based on recipes on epicurious, and I really think this is the best one yet. The flavors are sweet yet spicy, the textures crispy yet creamy. It's the perfect winter dish. And soooo easy to make, especially with leftover chicken from a Sunday dinner. My boyfriend really, really liked it. He even said, "In your face Rachael Ray!"

Chopper phobics: find another recipe. Agree that starting from scratch takes all afternoon. That said, I've made this as printed half a dozen times; family of 5 remembers and LOVES it. Today, however, I decided to clean out the refrigerator - leftover steak, roquefort-stuffed pork chop, elk medallions, goat stock, baked potato, assorted vegetables, fresh herbs. Biscuits cut out (as usual) with seasonal cookie cutters, ie autumn leaves, Xmas trees, George Washington's head. Result? Meat-based pie was as delicious as the original.

I must agree with the previous cooks on the statement made by Cook 08/02/03. Where do you get off putting someone down about the speed that they chop vegetables? Why do you care? Besides at least they took the time to chop them and not use frozen. Keep your negative comments to yourself!

This is a great dish for a large party. I made it for a party of 30, was able to do everything ahead of time and just pop it in the over (and a neighbors oven too). This gave me time to enjoy my dinner guests. Everyone loved it.

Imagine my surprise when this recipe turned into cannon fodder. I have made many a pot pie in my cooking life but I must have done something wrong with this one! It was pasty, and then I added a can of soup. Still pasty. The biscuits were like hockey pucks. I would say make twice the liquid filling and stick with Bisquick!

To A Cook on 08/02/03 Why do you have to be mean this is probably the first review I have read where a person atacks another person simple because they found something difficult whoopy do du for you if you can cut vegetables fast, maybe that other cook has talents you don't have like manners for starters Maybe you have been cooking for longer big whoops everyone is entitled to their own opinion I am in disbelief that a grown person (and I am assuming you are grown if you can cook so fast) can act like a kinder child "I can do this better than you nah nah" because thats what it sounds like

Okay. Here's the deal. This pie is a TON of work, especially if you DON'T have cooked chicken on hand and have to cook it and de-bone it, plus chop and simmer the vegetables, do the whole roux thing, make up the dough, etc. Next time I will follow Ft.Worth's advice and cut the corners she suggested; she is right, there are probably some unnecessary steps in this recipe. So for all this complaining on my part, I will say that it is a delicious pie; the biscuits are really tasty and it was a perfect Sunday night meal.

Made this recipe back when originally published but have lost my copy over the years. My husband to this day still says "remember that chicken and biscuit recipe you used to make..." Thankfully, I was able to find it again in time for his birthday. It is labor and time intensive, but well worth the effort.

To the previous cook: If it took a long time to cut up this small amount of veggies, you either need a decent knife or some skills. I can cut up that amount of vegetables, including washing and peeling, in well under 10 minutes.

I have never made anything like this before, so I was nervous but it came out great. Everyone from my boyfriend to my three kids (5 years and under) loved it! I followed a previous reviewer's advice and prepared the veggies in a skillet, then mixed it with pre-cooked chicken and the broth. I added mushrooms and 3 cloves of garlic, and used Italian seasonings in place of the spice. I used Bisquick for the dumplings (I did add some cheddar cheese). It took a long time to cut up all the veggies, but it was worth it. Will definitely make again!

This is a good pie, but the procedures are poor and unnecessarily complicated. In my cast iron dutch oven, (any oven-proof large pan will do) I increased the butter to 1/2 cup, sauteed my vegetables to tender (I added leeks, fennel, mushrooms, and at the last minute - peas). This kept the flavors in the pie, and not diluted through the stock. Then I added the chicken / seasonings and heated through. I reduced the flour to 1/4 cup, incorporated it into the mixture and added stock as needed to achieve the filling consistency I wanted. Instead of rolling/cutting biscuits, I increased the buttermilk to about 3/4 cup for a moister batter and simply used the 'drop method'. This is a rustic dish, and I wanted a rustic look. Bake and serve. One pan. One bowl. I made the biscuits while sauteing the vegetables, and assembled the whole thing in less than 45 minutes. (In all fairness, I keep homemade stock and prepared chicken as standard items in my freezer. And I scrub, but don't peel, carrots & potatoes. It's faster, healthier, and I don't end up throwing perfectly good vegetables down the disposal.) This process also enabled me to make a little larger pie, which fed 4 poor, deprived, bottomless pit, starving teenage boys who DO NOT eat vegetables! Yeah right! There were no leftovers. They even skipped dessert!!

This was excellent for comfort food! I was afraid that the vegies would be over cooked but maybe that is why we take them out of the broth for a while. It was very good and everyone at this dinner party said it was fabulous! Yum!!

It took a while, but in the end, this dish was a big hit. I made the recipe as written and had no complaints. It wasn't full of complex flavors, but a dish like this isn't supposed to be. It's basic comfort food done right. I gave it three forks just because it took me so long (the finished product didn't quite seem worth two hours!). But I'll make it again streamline it, and I'm sure it will be great.

Inexpensive ingredients, but, oh my lord, this was good. Even my supposedly-vegetarian teen-ager gobbled this up. I would not omit those lovely cheese biscuits, and I would not use frozen vegies because fresh ones are so much better. My only changes to the recipe were to add some sliced sauteed mushrooms, 3 cloves of garlic, and about a quarter-cup of sherry to the sauce. I had to hold this in a warm oven for 1/2 hour after baking it, as I was waiting for the kids to get home from a meeting, and there were no ill effects from the delay.

Fabulous. This is the main course for my Country French dinner party and folks rave. I modify the recipe to add a bit more Thyme and use smoked chicken breast. I also will use canned biscuits or frozen biscuits if I am in a pinch for time. I will let the dish begin to bubble before I add the biscuits. This is also a great recipe to freeze.

If I could give this a 2.5 I would. My boyfriend and I agreed that this is a good, solid, healthy meal that's just missing something...we found it a bit bland despite the fact that I added quite a bit of vegetables, including peas and corn, and seasoning. (The filling had a good consistency with the added vegetables.) Good, but I don't think worth all the effort (it took a good 2 hours to make.)

Rating: 4
I thought this dish was spectacular! I took the advice of earlier reviewers and seasoned it a little more. I added a big clove of garlic to the sauteed onions, along with extra thyme, onion and season salt. I also used a can of cream of chicken soup in place of half the broth and only used 1 tblsp of butter - so I could cut the fat. The taste of the nutmeg really makes the flavor of this dish.

This recipe fit perfectly into a chicken double header for me. I had made a chicken vegetable soup with a whole chicken so I had left over chicken, broth and vegetables. All I had to do was make the sauce and the biscuits! Worked out great. The only change I'll make next time is a little lower temp. in the oven. Biscuits were brown in 15 minutes but a little raw on the bottom.

My boyfriend has a certain very specific noise he makes when I serve this -- or even tell him I'm going to serve it -- I call it the "Chicken Pot Pie Moan." In fact, we have even bartered around it: a brake job for my car in return for X number of chicken pot pies in his freezer. It's really scrumptious. I followed the recipe pretty faithfully...until I'd memorized it, that is. The only change I make on a regular basis is omitting the cheese from the biscuits -- it's not necessary, as there is so much flavor in this to begin with; why not save the cheese for crackers? This recipe freezes beautifully (before the biscuit stage) and is always a hit. It's spoiled me -- and my boyfriend! -- on any other potpie recipe.

I started using this recipe in 1985 and was pleased to see it in the anniversary edition.This is the ultimate in chicken pot pies and I have brought tears of joy to the comfort food crowd. I agree the flavour can be mild so here are some of my variations. Turkey works as well or even better than chicken. I usually boost the broth by substituting 1 cup wth dry white wine and try to keep the rue soft so the sauce is not too stiff. I use a strong aged cheddar and bake the biscuits separately to avoid "soggy bottoms". The best flavour enhancer is to let the pie sit for a day to blend and develop flavour, then reheat and add the biscuits.

This chicken pie was just as good as I hoped it would be. I cut the recipe in half and just made one pie. I also used the plain "Biscuits" recipe from this site because it looked easier and I didnt see the need for cheese in it. I also used some heavy cream in the sauce to make it creamier and cut the biscuits into triangles rather than rounds.

Good recipe but very time consuming to make. You also end up dirtying a lot of different pans and mixing bowls and such. It took almost 2 hours from start to finish. I didn't even bother with rolling out the dough and cutting out the biskuits. I just patted them flat in my hand. It had a good flavor though and was tasty over all. Made a lot of leftovers too which was nice.

A great looking and tasty dish, a hit with the whole family. The bottom of my bisquits did not get done the first time, while the tops were dark brown. The second time, I reduced the temp. to 425F and put the filling in the oven to pre-heat while cutting out the bisquits. Substituted margarine for the butter and shortening.

They looked so good when they came out of the oven..I could hardly believe I prepared something that looked so good! But I was disappointed. For the amount of time it took to make these pies, the taste was sub-par. Biscuit round size needs to be adjusted for individual pies, and veggies need to be cut into smaller pieces. Also, I would recommend cooking them at 350 for 20 minutes or so, then kicking the temperature up to 400 to brown them on top.

I wish there was a 2-1/2 forks rating choice!!! Very good, but I just can't say delicious.

I had some chicken breasts uncooked, so cubed the chicken, and fried it up with about 5 cloves of pressed garlic and some oil or butter.
