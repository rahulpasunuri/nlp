Interestingly the soup was kind of bland when cold, so I reheated it and turned out great. The heat made it more aromatic and tasty. I used 1/2 of the olive oil, butter, and vegetable broth required. I guess 6 cups of broth would make it too liquid. Instead of two onions, I used an onion and a shallot, and 3 garlic cloves. I also followed the recommendations of the cook from Ontario and made his mix of spices. Thank you, it was really good! I am sure I will use it for other indian food. At the end the soup was very colorful!

I made this as written and it was OK. If I did make it again, I would leave out the tomato. One tomato did not add any flavor and turned the soup sort of a yuccky pink color.

The reviews made this dish sound good, but it is rather bland and uninspired. Substituting coconut milk was a good idea, though.

This is a great dish, and it's as good hot as cold. I replaced the heavy cream with coconut milk, which matches the curry flavor better, I think. Really, really good...even better than a cauliflower soup I had at a fancy restaurant the week before.

Since Curry is a combination of spices, I have decided to make my own. I mixed 1tbs fresh ginger, 2tsp ground turmeric, 1tsp cumin seeds, 1tsp mustard seeds, 2tsp ground coriander, 1tsp curry powder, 1tsp black cumin seeds (optional). To garnish I used fresh coriander leaves. Very colourful and tastes great.
