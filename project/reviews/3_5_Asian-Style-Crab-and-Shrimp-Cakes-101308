I love this recipe and use it as a goto crab cake recipe. I've used both the fresh breadcrumbs as well as panko and either work well. Serve it with a dollop of plum or hoisin sauce. Standard crab cakes don't hold a candle to these.

Excellent - my go to recipe for crab cakes. You must let them sit for an hour in refirgerator before you make into patties or they will fall apart.

My husband loves Asian food, and He enjoys seafood second to the Asian. This was not impressive at all. If you want a crab cake, make one. If you want Asian...make something other than this dish.

I've made these several times as appetizers. I shape them as big as a circle between my thumb and index finger. Right before I serve them, I sprinkle each cake with just a bit of rice wine vinegar and serve them on a bed of arugula

To Kristen in RI - I've had the same problem with crab cakes before, until I tried this little trick. Make your crab cakes, and then refrigerate them for about an hour before frying. Now mine all stay intact. Good luck! Oh, excellent recipe. Used panko as a sub.

Mine totally fell apart...WHY? so frustrating, there was nothing but a big plate of crab/shrimp mush that tasted pretty good, but a bit salty. I was so excited to make these too. I used panko and I cooked shrimp ahead, which was probably wrong; I'm a crab cake novice...any thoughts on why they wouldn't stay together? Suggestions?

De-lish! Will definitely make this again. Here's what I did with it: 1. Used thawed, previously frozen raw prawns, well chopped. 2. Used mayo sparingly, just to bind ingredients. 3. Used chopped fresh basil instead of cilantro. 4. Drizzled finished cakes with hot wasabe-sesame oil that we found in Hawaii. 5. Used Panko crumbs...the VERY BEST for crispy fried fish! 6. Served on a romaine salad tossed with a light vinegarette. Very good stuff!

Loved this recipe. I used fish sauce, wasabi mao and "Bookbinders" bread crumbs that are seasoned with lemon. Other than that followed the recipe and it was a big hit! Would give it 3 1/2 forks if I could.

These are my first attempt at crab cakes, and I was very impressed. I used the panko crumbs like others suggested, and I baked them instead of frying. They were delicious! I loved the fact that the recipe used shrimp as filler because so often crab cakes aren't meaty enough. I also added scallions per others suggestions. Another keeper!

This was really good, I think using shrimp to bulk up crabcakes is helpful(where I live, a jar of fresh crabmeat costs 30 dollars!)I did use scallions instead of cilantro, I added an egg, and I cooked these in the oven drizzeled with peanut oil for 20 minutes instead of pan frying them(they were too mushy after I added the egg) They were good with a wababi ginger aioli...

This recipe always gets rave reviews! The only changes I have made are to substitute panko breadcrumbs and to add a touch of wasabi sauce to the mixture. It is also tasty when using shrimp instead of crab. This one is a keeper!

Add more cilantro and ginger to the recipe to provide greater up-front flavor. Consider adding scallions to the recipe, as well.

I expected this recipe to be a loser but it turned out unbelievably good. I used fish sauce instead of soy. My only change was to add a beaten egg as suggested by another reviewer. I made no attempt to form them as regular crab cakes but simply used a large spoon to drop the mixture on the bread crumbs. Then I flipped each cake over to cover both sides and carefully transferred them to the skillet. They were wonderful.

I left out the cilantro, added ground red chile and one egg. I didn't think they were going to hold together, but they fried up nicely. Very good flavor.

I found this crab cake to be very good, but I am from Maryland where crab cakes reign, so it was not my favorite recipe, nor would I make it again. If you have never had a Maryland crab cake, this is an excellent recipe.

Sorrreee...must be something wrong here...a lot of trouble for minimum reward...much too salty (and I like salt)and couldn't even get through one. Normally love Bon Appetit recipes but this one didn't do it.

These were the best shrimp/crab cakes I've ever had. After making and eating these, you'll cringe every time you see them on restaurant's menu, 'cause you'll know you can do better...

I love this recipe. I've made them four times, and they're a big hit everytime.

Try it this way. Omit the fish or soy sauce and add 1 tbl chopped fermented black beans and 1 tsp red chili paste to taste. Serve with pineapple mango salsa.Awesome!

Made it with 100% shrimp. My wife was impressed with how well it came out. Will try with a shrimp / crab mix next time.

I didn't have both crab and shrimp on the same day, so I made it once with all crab and once with all shrimp. The shrimp was superb - I'd use a bit more of the fish sauce. The crab flavor was muted by the treatment.

These are very tasty crab cakes. But why use French bread crumbs in an asian style food? I used Panko bread crumbs with excellent results. They are available at most well stocked grocery stores and asian markets.

This is a relatively easy, extremely tasty and impressive dish. We used light/fat-free mayonnaise. Also, we cut the amount of fish sauce in half, to 1 teaspoon. Fresh crab was used instead of canned. We made fresh breadcrumbs using our Cuisinart....fresh breadcrumbs make the crab cakes very light!
