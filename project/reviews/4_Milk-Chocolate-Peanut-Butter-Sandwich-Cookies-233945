Amazing. Loved them. The cookies are also addicting by themselves.

After reading reviews by some that the filling for this recipe was overwhelming, I instead made ice cream sandwiches. I modified the recipe quite a bit (e.g., used sunflower butter) to make the recipe vegan and allergy-friendly. My chocolate chip granola sunbutter cookies and ice cream sandwiches were a huge hit at my Memorial Day cookout and with office pals! Even a couple friends with peanut allergies didn't believe the modified recipe was peanut-free. I will definitely be making these again!

Amazing!! Everywhere I take these, people hunt me down to get the recipe. You need to 1 1/2 the filling, its not enough as stated.

I have made these multiple times and always receive rave reviews. Since I am not a big milk chocolate fan I use semisweet chocolate and double the filling to ensure that there is enough. You can always find a creative use for the leftovers.

These were good but not as good I was expecting. The cookies were very powdery - I think because of the powdered sugar, and 11 minutes is definitely too long to bake them. I personally like chewy cookies and next time will use all brown sugar and only cookie for 8-9 minutes. Also using coarse kosher salt means you get big grains of salt in your filling - if you like little hits of salt in your food, this is ok, but just beware of that. And if you are counting on this recipes making 2.5 dozen sandwiches, it won't. I made small cookies (about 1.5 inches in diameter) and I got 16 sandwiches.

Absolutely fabulous cookies. I used all butter instead of part oil. This adds a richness to the cookies. Also, you may need to add a few tablespoons of flour to the batter, which may be a bit too wet. I use a small ice cream scooper to make the cookies uniform in size.

I've made these cookies multiple times and they are amazing. Just brought a whole batch to a staff picnic and they raved. With full size cookies and the filling they are like a meal unto themselves - but everyone loves them. I do like the milk chocolate with them. While I agree that the cookies on their own are excellent, they are truly something special when presented as sandwich cookies.

Great cookies, but skip the veggie oil. 1/2 cup of oil is a LOT!!!!!

These are great but rich with the icing so I subbed a lighter peanut butter-confect sugar type icing; using a lower fat pb as well as reducing sugars a bit. I made for clients (am a caterer) so made them much smaller, i.e. bite sized, which makes the shortbready consistency easier to handle. Also good with dark chocolate. They freeze great and with smaller size are elegant dusted with a bit of confect sugar.

I love this recipe! My husband loves peanut butter and chocolate and he ate 4 before I even got them off the rack. I didn't make the filling because the cookies were so good on their own. However, next time since I only make the cookies I will have twice the chocolate chips for texture and more chocolaty goodness!!

Rating: 4
Wow, the texture on these cookies were amazing. Such a great crunch on the outside, yet soft and yummy on the inside. I had to 1 1/2 the filling, I ran out by just making the recipe as stated. A keeper!!

I made the cookies only... they were so delicious that they didn't make it off the cooling rack! Maybe next time I'll make them when my husband is out and give the filling a chance!

These cookies tasted good but the consistency was too brittle. These were not chewy at all and I made it a point to not overcook!

Tasty cookies. Decreased sugar to 1/2 cup each of powdered and brown. Didn't do chocolate filling as they were rich and sweet enough on their own.

These were great peanut butter cookies. In my opinion, they don't necessarily need or want the filling - the chocolate chips more than do the job. A tasty snack that definitely warrants some milk.

Really good as written. I went easy on the oil, and next time will use a bit less sugar. You don't absolutely have to have the filling if you want traditional PB cookies.

I make these cookies whenver I'm asked to bring dessert or if I need to make a quick easy dessert for a casual dinner and I'm always begged for the recipe. I think because they're so sweet semi sweet chocolate chips work better for the filling and the cookie. These are my other mods: - Make tiny cookies and bake for 7 min. - All butter No oil, - Adjust the sugar to 1/2 cup of powdered sugar and 1/3 cup granulated. - Double the filling recipe and make the cookies way smaller than you think would be necessary then fill them generously.

These cookies turned out to be a big hit! However, I had some trouble with making the cookies small enough, though I rolled the dough into, what I thought, were small enough little balls. The small, bite-sized cookie sandwiches I had planned for turned out to be a fairly heavy main dessert dish. Any suggestions on how to make this recipe a bit more on the small, appetizer-side?

These cookies were way to sweet for me! If I make these again I'm definitely reducing the sugar.

This is wonderful cookie sandwich recipe. The filling is perfect. I like the cookies, but think that the filling goes better with a recipe I got from Recchiuti.com for Flourless Peanut Butter Cookies. Regardless, I have made these several times for friends and family, always to high praise.

kind of a complicated recipe, but they came out great! just make sure to make the cookies small enough, and i also would recommend smushing them flat a bit before baking so they can support the frosting.

I really like these cookies! I followed some other suggestions--I used all butter instead of vegetable oil, and I added 2 eggs. I used all powdered sugar, and I'm not convinced it made a difference. I also used semi-sweet chocolate instead of milk chocolate, which I think is good for people who want to avoid a sugar high (I used semi-sweet for the frosting as well as semi-sweet chips).

I love peanut butter so I love this recipe! It was a hit at a cookie party I went to. If you use a table spoon to dish out the cookies the cookies will be too big. Try using a teaspoon instead.

Can I ask why the vegetable oil is a necessary ingredient? After mixing everything, I folded in the flour. It was still a little wet, so I added just a little bit more flour. Then I mixed in the choc chips. The batter stood for less than 1 minute before the oil separated itself from the batter! I tried to dab away as much oil as possible... and the cookies still turned out ok (except just slightly singed at the edges)... so I'm thinking, is the oil really necessary???

I used butter instead of oil and... they were excessively soft. But still amazing and gooey and evvvveryone in my apartment loved them.

Rating: 2
Let me start off by saying that I am not a baker. So I heeded the advice of others and used 2 eggs, granulated sugar and powdered sugar, crisco instead of butter, and I doubled the recipe for the filling. The cookies were still crisp and crumbly; but I think they need to be that way to support the filling. I do not recommend adding the salt to the filling - TOO SALTY! These are very rich cookies, and should be made small. I probably will not make these again.

Rating: 1
I'm confused about this recipe. I used 1/2 shortening, 1/2 butter. The cookies are too hard. I measured precisely the whipping cream and there wasn't enough to melt the chocolate. Something doesn't measure up. They taste nice though.

Rating: 4
Excellent!!! So sweet and so good. Very good with a glass of cold milk. For those of you complaining about the cookie not being chewy enough substitute 1/2 the butter with Crisco. Butter is what makes the cookies crunchy not the type of sugar you are using.

Love this recipe! If you're in a hurry or need to make a cookies for Christmas but just don't have enough time, cheat and buy pre-made chocolate chip cookie dough then just follow the filling recipe for this cookie. I've done it before. It's done in an instant and tastes great!

I also took suggestions from other reviewers and substituted 1/3c granulated sugar for the powdered sugar and added 2 eggs instead of 1.I also used semi-sweet morsels. I thought these cookies were really yummy, but very rich with the filling.

These cookies are so great - very rich! I followed the advice I found in many of the previous reviews. I used 2 eggs, cut the powdered sugar in half and substituted granulated sugar - they turned out not-too-dry and not-too-chewy. Next time, though, I am definitely going to double the filling. And because they are so heavy, I think I probably won't be making them again until winter time. They really don't strike me as a light spring cookie.

This is a hit for everyone we make it for. Just did a dessert reception, not a crumb of these were left. Everyone I make these for are in a happy sugar coma!

Whoo hoo! I made these twice in a week and totally stalled my diet! Sooo good! I didn't make the recipe as written, but made a few adjustments. Added some granulated sugar and cut back on the powdered, added more butter, less oil. And also added an egg yolk in addition to the egg. The cookies turned out awesome. People were totally blown away by them. I don't really even like PB cookies, but I will be making these frequently. I am sure these would be perfect for a peanut butter cup lover.

Rating: 0
Taking many past reviews into consideration, I made this recipe with 2 eggs instead of one, and substituted half the powdered sugar in the cookie with regular sugar. Eggs always make a dry cookie moist. The result was a chewey cakey cookie that held together very well. However, I only got about 18 cookie sandwiches. I suggest dropping them in half tablespoon rounds. If you only use enough filling to cover cookies you should have enough, barely. 4 forks.

Rating: 1
Maybe I did something wrong, but I was thoroughly underwhelmed by these cookies. My friend liked them, but she likes anything sweet. My boyfriend agrees with me that the cookies were greasy and dry. I agree with other reviewers that the dryness makes the cookies brittle, which makes them difficult to fill. I managed, but wasn't all that impressed by the filling, either. I would certainly try other people's suggestion of using half powdered and half granulated sugar if I ever made these again, but I don't think that will be happening. There are too many good recipes out there for me to waste my time with this one again.

Rating: 4
These cookies were really awesome. I changed it just a little though. Instead of making big cookies, I shrunk them and make two-bite cookies instead. I substituted mini chocolate chips for the big ones. They were adorable and everyone loved them. For more details and pictures, check out my blog here: http://tinyurl.com/2lz4k6

The only thing I did not love about this recipe was the use of coarse salt. It was a little disconcerting to come across a salt crystal in the middle of a cookie. Next time I make these, I will definitely use regular salt. Also, I made the cookies with semi-sweet chocolate chips because that's all I could find, and while the cookies tasted fine, I will use milk chocolate next time. All in all, a wonderful cookie.

This cookies are awesome. They need the frosting though. They are too dry without it. I dipped the bottoms of the cookies in the frosting (so there wasn't too much on them) & then let them dry in the fridge. I didn't make sandwiches out of them. This seemed perfect.

Man oh man, these are awesome!! I couldn't keep my hands out of the cookie jar (gained a couple of pounds this week- worth it). At other reviewers advice I used equal parts powdered and granulated sugar to make the cookies more chewy and it worked. The cookies are great on their own, but don't skip the filling!!

These were so delicious-- pure decadence!

Still, they tasted amazing and were very easy to make. I'm definitely adding these to my permanent repertoire.

These cookies were pretty delicious and chocolately. However, the texture was quite different from regular chocolate chip cookies. They were a bit crusty, not like regular chewy cookies. Overall, I think there are a lot of better cookie recipes out there to try. Also, I didnt make the choc. filling because the cookies were such a crumbly texture, they would fall apart.

I used a high quality dark chocolate all around. Though people were very thrilled by the concept of a sandwich cookie, I thought the stand-alone cooke without the filling was even better!

A great cookie which was a big hit with both kids and grownups. It is not a delicate cookie to be nibbled on with pinky raised; it is a hearty mouthful of a delicious combination of chocolate and peanut butter with a perfect texture. Get out your glass of milk and dunk away!

this recipe is being rated by a 3 & 7 yr old. These cookies were delicious!! They were really choclately. I really want to make these again - they were fun to make. These were the best cookies I ever tasted in my life! I could taste the peanut butter. The sandwich cookies are cool. Comments from Mom: these cookies definitely require milk or coffee to deal with the peanut butter and chocolate - the filling is yummy!

Rating: 3
I liked these, but my guests liked them more than I did. As a matter of personal preference I think that semi-sweet chocolate would be better, and I'll try it again with that. The cookies seemed a little dry on their own, but sandwiched with the filling were much better.

If you like cookies a bit more soft and chewy, subsitute regular sugar instead of powder sugar and keep everything the same. That turn out like the toll-house style of cookies. They turn out absolutely perfect and you will not be able to keep these around for very long!!!!!!!!!!!!!

These always turn out to be a perfect cookie. The oil makes for a stick free experience without any messy cleanup. The kids fight over these and can't get enough. I made the original cookie and then left out the filling, peanut butter ingredients and used semi sweet chocolate in lieu of milk. No matter what, these come out a perfect 10 every time. Two thumbs up!!!

We make these everytime a chocolate chip cookie craving occurs. The oil makes for a stick free experience. They just slide right off the pan. The original recipe is sinfully wonderful, but I've made these without the filling, without peanut butter and with semi sweet chocolate and they all turned out superb. My kids fight over these and we just can't keep enough in the house. It always turns out to be a perfect cookie!! Two thumbs up on this one!!

Wow. These are excellent cookies - crumbly and chewy at the same time, and sickeningly sweet (think kid-friendly cookies, these are not for sophisticated, 90% cocoa palates, although I doubt they would be bad with semi-sweet choc chips). I was looking for a way to use up left-over Easter chocolate and I typed "milk chocolate" in the recipe search. This was the first recipe that came out and I looked no further. Followed the recipe exactly, but I didn't bother with the filling as I like them the way they are with a big glass of cold milk. Will freeze half of the batch (made about 50 cookies) for later enjoyment!

When I first read the recipe, I thought, "This sounds like the best thing in the world." I was right! I made them for a party, and everyone raved. Yes, they are thick, but just take them apart. Or share. To the cook who commented that the recipe didn't make enough, I say use a measuring tablespooon and make it level. It made exactly 30 cookies.

Awesome cookies. My friends really loved them. Used semi-sweet chips for filling - this is a very rich dessert and although I love milk chocolate I think it would have been too much. The other reviewers are right in that the cookies are good by themselves. Some of my friends took apart the cookies to eat them, claiming it was too rich. Definitely recommend this recipe and it wasn't too hard to make either (I was 9 months pregnant with twin two year olds helping me make them and we still got it done easily.)

this makes a really delicious treat - kind of a substitute for ice creams sandwiches in the winter months. i think if i made it again i would use my standard recipe for pb-choc chip cookies as this one was just a little crumbly. i used regular choc chips and semi-sweet choc for the filling since i prefer it to milk chocolate.

This is certainly, in my opinion and those who tasted the cookies, a delicious, palate pleasing, chocolate (peanut butter) chip cookie. I know it's the best I've every made. However...and it's a huge however...The idea of marrying two cookies with the filling, just does not make for good eating. It's too thick that way, and takes away from the delicious single cookie, as well as adding unnecessary calories. I've just almost finished baking a double batch and there is no doubt in my mind that I'll make this recipe again and again. Thanks so much for the recipe. Helen

These cookies are awesome! This is my favorite flavor combination so I couldn't wait to try them. The kosher salt was an added "touch" to the milk chocolate chips in the cookie. The batter was very easy to work with and really held their shape during baking. I used "nutella" as the sandwich filling and it was fantastic. It saved me time and I really enjoyed the taste. One container of the nutella was enough for the entire batch of cookies.

Delicious! Cookies are good on their own, but even better with the filling. Since it is a sandwich cookie, they were a little too big when made with a tablespoon. Will try a bit smaller next time. I only yielded 22, not the 30 the recipe says it will make.
