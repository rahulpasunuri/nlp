I agree that the ripeness and quality of the pears cannot be overlooked. I have made this several times to rave reviews, and always use the best pears I can find, allowing them to ripen a few days beforehand. Rather than crumbled cookies, I serve them with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, a sprinkle of sliced almonds, and a drizzle of additional amaretto. Fabulous!

This is a delicious, elegant and low-fat dessert. I thought it had a lot of flavor. I agree with earlier reviewers that good-quality ingredients are key in a simple recipe like this one.

In response to the cooks who found their resulting dishes bland, it is worth pointing out that the taste and quality of the fruit that you began with is of utmost importance. If the pears started out flavorless and not sweet enough (as is sometimes the case) your results would be less-than-perfect. Using fruit that is perfectly ripe, not to mention in season, is essential.

Not worth a repeat - very bland. I even doubled the Amaretto and Balsamic Vinegar.

It was very easy to make, but I was disappointed in the flavor. Very bland with mostly a pear flavor and not even a hint of the almond flavor.

Very simple and elegant. I served it after risotto with great results. Definitely a keeper!
