A really delicious and light broth. I added some chopped mint to the cream, so that I could garnish the dish with mint, as I had no pea shoots. This is a definite keeper - very straightforward to make - I had to chill the broth over a bowl of ice in the fridge, as it was not cooling fast enough, given the time restrictions in the recipe - other than that, all went very smoothly - many compliments from guests.

Sugar snap peas look like snow peas but the peas are larger and visible in the pods; you eat the whole thing, pods and all, leaving the peas right in the pod. Either steam or quickly sauté them. It's generally a spring/fall item, cool growing season.
