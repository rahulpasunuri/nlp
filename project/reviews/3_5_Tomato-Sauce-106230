Great basic recipe to use as a jumping off point. Skip the food mill - not necessary. I made this with a few additions. Had a little spinach from the garden which I chopped along with a handful of fresh basil. Also have added a little fennel seed, some garlic and then simmered this with the rind of a rind of an aged Italian cheese I had left over (pecorino romano, but anything would work). Fresh and delicious!

Lovely sauce, easy to make, delicious, and you can do what you want with it. I had a can of carrots to use up, and threw them in lieu of the celery/carrot mixture. I think it made it even better. The peperoncino is a wonderful addition.

The flavors in this sauce are simply divine. I love that the simplest foods are often the best tasting. I made one alteration to the recipe and used hot sauce in place of the crushed pepper. The second time I made the sauce I added a small amount of heavy cream -- yum!

Nice basic sauce - a good way to use up the garden tomatoes! We added garlic and a little sugar. I don't bother seeding or coring tomatoes, just peel them.

Our garden tomatoes are overflowing and we needed some good quick recipes. This is a winner. I didn't feel the need to supplement with other ingredients, but sounds like some changes are just as tasty and good.

This sauce was really good. I never made my own sauce before so I was kinda scared because I though it would be so much harder than this was but it came out really good. I made a few changes because my boyfriend is kinda picky. Instead of celery I used a green pepper, I only used half of a really small onion and a bit of shopped garlic to replace the rest of the onion I didn't use. The sauce did come out a little bitter but I'd definitely make it again. I'll try to add some unsalted butter like the exact recipe says in her book to make it less bitter. My boyfriend liked it too.

I am enchanted to find a recipe that holds true to the tomato sauce I enjoyed as a child growing up in Milan. This sauce features the flavor of the tomatoes with a spicy bite from the peperoncini. It's simplicity makes it a perfect compliment to al dente spaghetti - a nice lunch dish or first course. Italian food in America tends to rely heavily on garlic, but it is seldom used in tomato sauce in Northern Italy. The carrots provide the needed sugar content; there's no need to add more. The milder French bay leaves won't overpower this dish. If you'd like to try the cuisine of Northern Italy for a change, I recommend making this recipe as is. Simply squisito!

Although somewhat close to an authentic italian sauce, feel free to cut out the celery and a bit of the carrot. Start with some diced up onion and garlic (a must) and use basil and thyme instead of the bay leaves (leaves too strong a aftertaste). Also, helps to throw in a pinch of sugar to negate some of the acidity. Also, never cook for more than 30 min, as the cooking changes the taste of the tomatoes.

Good Basic sauce. Of course, Garlic if you so choose. Always add 1 tbls of sugar (white or brown) to any cooked tomates along with 1 tsp of vinegar or just use 1/4 cup dry red wine plus sugar or a sweet red wine.

My family loved this sauce, it even worked with whole wheat spaghetti! I added 5 cloves of garlic to the other vegetables. I chopped the carrot, celery, onion (I used a shallot), garlic in the cuisinart all together before I sauteed them. I added 1/2 a cup of a dry red wine and dried oregano during the last 1/2 hour. I used 1-28 oz can of tomato sauce and a smaller can of diced tomatoes. It was a little dry, so I then added 1 cup of water. Delicioso! I also served turkey meatballs on the side.

Eh, so-so. Needs garlic! And maybe oregano.

I love making fresh tomato sauce, especially on cold Sundays when football is on... I can't believe there is no garlic in this, though! I always start with at least 6 or 7 cloves with the onions and throw in Italian sausage...Cheers!

A very good basic recipe. I always add a pinch of sugar and a splash of red wine, which seems to bring out the essence of the tomatoes more. I sometimes use fresh or dried basil and oregano instead of Bay leaves. Adding sun-dried tomatoes gives it a deeper richer flavor. Cooked Meat or sausages can be added to the sauce or in separate layers as in Lasagne.

This is a classic simple Italian Tomatoe Sauce recipe. It is fantastic with fresh summer tomatoes, but I use canned San Marzano tomatoes since great tasting summer tomatoes are scarce in this part of the country. San Marzano tomatoes create a richer sauce. This sauce is meant to be simple with the essence of vegetables and very few spices. It is great on dishes where the flavor of the main ingredient is meant to be enhanced by the sauce, such as Eggplant Parmeggiana.

I used 1 28 oz can crushed tomatoes and 1 28 oz can diced tomatoes and 4 dry bay leaves. It was a nice fresh sauce with the Gnocchi and Olive recipe, but probably needs something more than just what is on this page.

Okay recipe - probably better with summer tomatoes - didn't really find it inspirational....
