i make this salsa for parties whenever i put tortilla chips out. it's delicious, fresh and beats any salsa out of a jar hands down.

We love salsa and this one just had very little flavor. We prefer more ingredients such as garlic or cumin to add more punch.

YUMMY! This is the first salsa I've ever made. I mixed it in with some Mac and Cheese. Don't know how I've lived so far with out having a bowl of this stuff perpetually in my fridge. Hey, it's healthy too? - hard to believe for such an addicting substance.

Excellent for tortilla chips, too.
