Interesting flavor. I heated up the broth since I didn't feel like a total cold soup. Liked the crunch of the vege's but would not make it again.

Delicious soup, just the right lightness and exqusite flavor. The lightness of the miso and ingredients combine to make this either a light lunch, or more formally as an appetizer are its genuine qualities. Plus it's easy to make. I found that after it cools down to room temperature and it's then refrigerated overnight and reheated the next day make it evben more tasty!
