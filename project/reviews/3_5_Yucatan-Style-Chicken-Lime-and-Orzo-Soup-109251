This really is a great twist to chicken noodle soup. I did tweak the recipe, but only a tad so this deserves the full rating of 4. My husband says this was the best "chicken noodle soup" he's ever had, and we are foodies. I caramelized the onions first, added diced celery and carrots for added nutrition, and used a little less than 2 jalapeños (caution - jalapeños vary in heat) and I deseeded/demembraned them to accommodate my 3 yo toddler (she loved this soup, btw). In addition to fresh lime juice, I zested the lime and tossed that into the soup with the broth. At the end, I added freshly ground pepper, fresh spinach along with cilantro. I omitted the tomatoes as I didn't think it needed them. Next time, I might try it.

Rating: 1
Sorry, I didnt care for this recipe and would not make it again. I reduced the lime juice by half and it was still bitter, so maybe something else (not the quantity of lime) makes it bitter. I particularly did not care for the long strands of onion and the large pieces of garlic and onion. I think it would be better with chopped onion and minced garlic and jalepenos. And I think the chicken would have been better if it been well seasoned, cooked separately, and then shredded before being added to the soup.

I love this soup! The only thing I do differently is I omit the tomato. I had a similar soup at a restaurant in Tijuana and loved it so much I began searching for a similar recipe. This comes pretty close. The soup in TJ had a rich chicken broth base, no chicken, but had mexican rice instead of orzo, and had thinly sliced slivers of fresh onion added on top. The rice tasted like it had been cooked with garlic, and had a slight orange tint (from tomato sauce I assume). I dont recall any jalapenos, but I like them in this version. One of these days I will try to copy the TJ version, but for now, this will do just fine.

This soup is amazing! I can eat it FOREVER! It's not too hard to make but it is easy to overdose on the noodles, so be careful to only put the amount of orzo that is requested in the recipe :) I make this soup often because it is SO great with TOFU instead of chicken! The tofu soaks up all the flavor and it tastes fresh and healthy!

Rating: 4
I did make some minor alterations. Instead of using plain chicken boiled in the broth, I used the leftover lemon, garlic, and rosemary roasted chicken breasts from a previous meal. I also added a couple handfuls of fresh spinach, some dried basil, and some roughly chopped baby bella mushrooms. I couldn't be more happy with the results. I loved the spicy/sour broth and all the ingredients. It tasted light and fresh but was wonderfully filling.

Rating: 4
I LOVE this soup! I started making it when I got it out of Bon Appetit and it has never failed me. I dont like onions so I finely chop celery instead. I just made it for a gathering and quadrupled the recipe and it turned out perfectly. It is chicken noodle soup with a twist!

I love the idea of this soup. The flavors are all favorites of mine, but something about this soup just doesn't work. Ive made this soup many, many times. At first I thought I could work with it, but after the last attempt, I have decided I am tossing it and looking for another. The recipe as presented is too bland and requires something to kick it up.

Rating: 4
I am eating the leftovers of this from last night for lunch as I write this - it's even better the next day! My non-soup-eating boyfriend is now a convert and demands this. It's a wonderful wintertime classic, with an interesting twist. I would DEFINITELY seed and membrane the jalapenos. It may just be the batches we've been getting, but those things are atomic and will render this soup inedible if you don't. Also, I'd cook the onions a little longer until they are mostly carmelized - the recipe as is leaves them a little raw. I also like to let this simmer on 'low' for about 20 minutes after everything is done - let's the flavors mellow more, and I get the kitchen cleaned up in the meantime. Win/win. Definitely recommend.

I didnt care for this soup. It was simple, but bland and lacked a kick. I would not make this again.

Such a great and easy recipe. My husband gave it a 9 out of 10 and he's never given anything a 10!! I cooked the orzo with a bit of olive oil, garlic and chicken bouillon to add a little extra flavor. We both like things with a little kick and this soup had it. If you don't like spicy things I would suggest cutting back to 1 jalp. Also, I hate cilantro so I omitted it completely. Next time, I'll also dice the onions instead of just thinly slicing them.

Rating: 3
Delicious, but we found it too sour -I would add less lime juice next time.

Rating: 3
Excellent soup! It really hit the spot on a chilly spring day. I used 2 limes worth of juice, and it probably should have been 3. I also chickened out, thinking that 2 jalapenos would be too spicy, so I only used 1 small one. It really could have used 2. Sometimes we served this with the orzo, and sometimes with tortilla strips and it was great both ways. This is going to become a regular thing at our house, filling but not too heavy and good year round!

Rating: 4
My family (husband, 2 teenage boys) liked this well enough the first night, but after a couple of days in the refrigerator the soup mellowed and rocketed to favorite status. If I say we're having soup the boys ask hopefull whether I mean this one. Next time I'll just make it a couple of days ahead.

Rating: 3
This tasty soup was even better when reheated for lunch. The combination of chicken, lime, garlic, and cilantro is heady indeed. The only negative feeling I have re: this recipe is that too much orzo is called for. Next time, I will probably halve the orzo and add a chopped squash.

Rating: 4
A version of the simple but addicting Sopa de Lima of the Mexican Yucatan peninsula. My boyfriend and I fell in love with it while visiting the ruins at Chichen Itza and went back to the same roadside restaurant three separate times for this soup. This is delicious and similar tasting... although not exactly the same. (obviously it didn't have orzo). Go easy on the amount of orzo, or for a lighter soup, omit. I like it with an extra tomato and extra garlic. I added chayote (Latin squash) chopped into cubes, excellent addition. I prefer using chicken thighs with the bones and then after they've boiled in the soup, pull them out, debone and return the meat to the soup. Make sure to salt well. The broth is the best part!!

Rating: 4
This soup is absolutely refreshing and delicious, yet at the same time a great comfort food when there's a chill in the air. I took the advice of another reviewer who added zucchini, and added about 1.5 yellow zucchini to the soup. I added the seeds of just one of the jalapenos, and that provided just enough zing and kept the soup interesting. Also kept the orzo separate and added to the bowls when ready to serve. This soup has such a great flavor in addition to being simple to make - a wonderful twist on a winter classic. I've already made it 4 times this winter!

Rating: 3
i tried this healthy recipe on a day when my husband was sick, and it turned out great! i was a little hesitant because it's a pretty easy recipe, but the flavors work really well together. a few changes i made to the recipe were as follows 1. seasoned chicken with chili powder as it was sauteeing. 2. added boiled carrots 3. i ground up the jalapenos in a grinder instead of slicing them. i found that this way the spicy flavor is well blended throughout the soup. i will definitely make this again, and especially if we have guests.

Rating: 4
This was great, and prep time was pretty quick. I didn't have jalapenos on hand, so I used crushed red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper. That was ok, but next time I'll try it with jalapenos. I like the texture of the orzo (I've had other soups with rice before, and I like the smoothness of the orzo better).

This was really delicious. Super spicy.

Rating: 4
This soup is so yummy...you don't need to make many revisions....I sauteed the chicken in olive oil and seasoned with a touch of cajun spice, cumin, salt, and ground pepper.....i added the juice of two limes....not sure about quantity...just eyeballed it. This is a VERY easy recipe, really delicious, with clean, fresh flavours, which is a welcome relief from so many cumbersome, elaborate recipes. It's great when you can taste, see, and identify what you are actually eating!! I am making a big batch of this for my cousin and her husband who just had a little baby, and she is looking for some healthy, yummy recipes to stockpile her fridge and kitchen in the coming weeks.....I hope this will be a tasty and easy recipe for her to add to her repertoire.....P.S....it's a boy!!!!

I just finished making this soup. I chopped, and then browned the onions (as someone suggested). I added 3 cups of chicken broth and one cup beef broth. I simmered the soup at a low temperature to keep the cilantro and tomatoes bright. I added a dash of crushed red chili pepper, and I served the soup over the orzo (as another cook suggested). Then I dropped in chunks of fresh avocado... it was lovely.

Rating: 4
And one (or two) more things: It's absolutely essential that the chicken is sauteed and given flavor, carmelization, and texture. Otherwise, you have flaccid bits of white protein ... might as well use tofu. The other is that your broth should be reduced. Concentrates the flavor and is an amazing foil with the lime juice.

Rating: 4
Quick, easy, and unexpectedly delicious! I used peppers from my garden that are moderately hot, and the amount was perfect. What I'd do differently: Not mix the orzo in the soup. I plan to serve it again, but will put the orzo in bowls before ladling the soup on top. Why? Because it's even more tasty the next day, and the orzo tends to get waterlogged. I'd also try this with another pasta or rice.

Rating: 2
It was good but not a rave. My husband liked it more than I did. Only used one pepper because he doesn't like a lot of spice but it turns out it would have benefited from two, and he could have taken the heat. Next time I'll add more lime.

I did like this soup but like others felt it needed a bit more zip. I added some jalapeno Tabasco sauce which did the trick. I liked another reviewer's idea of adding a can of sweet corn. I didn't try it but will next time I make this. The flavours would seem to fit.

I seeded the jalapenos and that resulted in no heat whatsoever, so I ended up adding about a tsp. of pureed chipotle in adobo. I subbed white rice (1/2c.) for the orzo since I didn't have any on hand. The lime gives a nice kick, but I ended up adding more than the recipe called for. I liked this soup, but I don't know if I liked it enough to make again.

Very impressive, and easy. I omitted the chiles (we are very wimpy!) and substituted 1 can of diced tomatoes for the fresh. The flavors are perky and interesting.

I LOVED this soup. Now to be clear, I did make adjustments to the recipe as printed. This is what a good cook does when they know that they and their family have flavor requirements outside of the mainstream. If you get really excited by complex and potent flavors like me and mine, here are the adjustments that I made: half again the garlic, double the lime, add 1-2 Tbsp of sugar(I've found from eating Thai food I like just a hint of sweetness with my spicy) as for the heat, it's up to you but 2 seeded jalepenos is alot of spicy for most people. Next time I make it I plan to coarse chop the onion and cube the chicken, its faster and I didn't really find the shape of the onions or chicken exciting enough to put in the extra effort. I also like someone else's suggestion to use chipotles. This is not a bland or dull soup as written, I think for the majority of people ( the target audience of this and most recipes) it'd be very full flavored, and for the rest of us punch it up a little. You won't be sorry.

Rating: 1
Bland and mediocre overall but not bad tasting in anyway. I will not make it again.

Rating: 3
This is a very delicious soup if you like straightforward flavors without too much subtlety. In style, it reminds me of tortilla soup except not so tomato/garlicky. The lime juice is essential, without it, the soup would be quite bland. Be careful with the orzo, it's easy to add too much as those little things really do plump up. I used 7-8 cups of chicken broth, as I wanted a more liquid soup, and used chicken from a whole boned fryer. The more varied texture of the dark and light meat seemed more authentically Yucatecan.

I haven't made this soup as yet but because it sounded so interesting, I was curious about others' opinions. So many people questioned this chipotle chili business I just wanted to say that if the food dictionary on this site doesn't help or if an ingred. is unavailable in your area (big problem here) check out kitchen conservatory.com. They are really helpful and answer questions quite promptly. A few days, my fellow foodies, not minutes or hours. And BY THE WAY - someone mentioned also subbing habanero peppers for the jalapenos....BEWARE. Someone just explained to me that the heat in peppers is measured in Scoville units (maybe Scofield). But whatever, habaneros have a bizillion at least. For a recipe that serves four, start out with a bit no larger than a newborn baby's pinkynail!!! And that warning comes from someone who enjoys spicey food. That said, habaneros do have a better, more complex flavor.

I made this for my sister and her husband while visiting (her hubby is the pickiest eater ever...think meat, potatoes, cheese). They loved it and so did I, so when I went home, I made some for the fiance and myself. The lime juice is a must, lending a brilliant, tart zing to what would otherwise be run-of-the mill chicken soup. I left out some things and added others...this recipe has great versatility.

After a long day of work and feeling under the weather (with the weather!), I wanted something fast, hot, and yummy. This one fit the bill! I used one Thai chile and it was the perfect amount of heat. I also sauteed some carrot chunks with the onions, garlic, and chiles. Tossed in some zucchini and corn close to the end and the tomatoes at the very end with the cilantro. I was nervous about the lime juice based on other reviews, but only complemented the wonderful flavors of the soup! Surprising at how develop the flavors were for this soup that was put together so quickly!

The second time I made this, I omitted the orzo, and added a diced zucchini and a few chopped tomatillos with the tomatoes. Additional lime juice and diced avocado at the table made it even better.

Rating: 3
This was great but... I made home made broth which created a richer flavor for the base. I also pan braised the chicken to carmelize it a bit before placing it in the soup. I made the dish twice and the first time was best. I substituted rice for orzo. On the second try I used a chinese rice that dissolved and made the soup thick and starchy. The first time I used a white Indian style rice that worked perfectly.

For a soup lover, this is a great one. I think from now on, to any chicken soup that I make, I think I will add a bit of lime and a jalapeno. The first time I used it, I couldn't find any orzo at my local grocery, so I used cous cous, which was an odd addition, but it was kind of a nice difference in texture. I tried the second time with shell pasta, and that is good too. You can always add more lime, salt and jalapenos to this recipe.

I don't think the flavors really come together. There's too much lime juice, and it gives the soup a metallic taste.

Made this recipe again for friends and they all loved it, even the kids.

I am printing out the recipe for my friend now!

Rating: 3
Light and flavorful, with a nice combination of tangy citrus from the limes and mild capsaicin spice from the jalepenos. I used a mixture of thinly sliced chicken breast and thigh meat, and found the thigh meat more juicy and flavorful in this soup. The recipe was a hit with everyone who tried it, and everyone went back for seconds.

Wow. I am a huge fan of very spicy food, but this was over the top. I should have seeded the jalapenos. I'll definitely make this again as the overall flavor was great, but alter the peppers for sure. So hot that my boyfriend, who pretty much likes everything I make, didn't want to take the leftovers home.

Rating: 2
This is good but reminds me of another much better recipe. The only differences are: *omit the orzo *bake some tortillas (brushed with olive oil) cut into strips and serve on the side for either dipping or to crumble in soup. *dice up one avocado and add just before serving *include 2 teaspoons of Emerils creole seasoning (recipe below). These additions should satisfy those who found recipe a little bland. 2 1/2 tablespoons paprika 2 tablespoons salt 2 tablespoons garlic powder 1 tablespoon black pepper 1 tablespoon onion powder 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon dried leaf oregano 1 tablespoon dried thyme.

We made this with a garnish of diced avocado, mexican farmer cheese, and tortilla strips. Still, it was not very good. Maybe if we had very rich chicken stock (or greatly reduced) it would have been better. On another reviewers suggestion, we did not cook the tomatos, just added them at the end. This is a good idea, but I think the broth needs so much help that extra tomatos would improve it: some cooked in the broth, some not. The onion, garlic, and chili strips were slimy from the broth and tasteless. I think a better method would be to saute them as directed, add to the broth for a little cooking, then strain them out. For this method, add way more chili peppers. Need more lime, too. The chicken was tastless and colorless. Definitly punch this up some how, some way: add spices, grill it, smoke it, something. Also, it was impossible to get the chicken to matchstick size when it was raw. Better to first cook the chicken to 80% done, then shred or finely chop, and let it finish cooking in the broth. This recipe needs a lot of work to earn my forks. Alas, I am still on my quest for the recipe that mimics the Tortilla Soup from Xiomara's on Melrose.

Rating: 3
I'm not an orzo fan, so instead I used very small pasta in this soup. Next time, I will precook the chicken so I can shred it into matchstick size. I'll also try increased the lime juice as above. I'll also add some chili paste. So...I agree with some of the changes suggested above and I will definitely make it again.

Rating: 3
A nice surprise of a soup. I used adobo chiles & added my lime & cilantro just prior to serving as suggested. It was very good. We jokingly called it "Thai meets Mexican Soup" It's a nice one for company, as long as they can take some heat. Not crazy hot, tho.

Rating: 2
Despite the raving reviews, this soup didn't particularly thrill me for two reasons. First, I thought the chicken was rather bland; next time,I would season it with salt and pepper prior to slicing and cooking it. And secondly, heeding the comments of others, I left the seeds in the jalapeno to give the soup a little more heat. The end result was a not altogether pleasing fusion of Asian-Mexican-Italian cooking. If I were to make this again,(and I may because it was quick, filling but light, and tasty)I would substitute rice for the orzo, seed the jalapeno, and add a bit of roasted red chili paste.

Rating: 4
This recipe is heartier than I thought and could really be a meal in itself. I doubled the lime juice (a must) and added pre-cooked chicken. The leftovers really thicken up so have some chicken broth on hand when you reheat.

Rating: 3
I agree that this was "surprisingly unspicey," but still quite good. Made exactly as written, plus 2 sliced carrots added with the chicken, just to increase the vegetable content of tonight's dinner. This could lend itself to lots of other veggies: broccoli, zucchini, corn and/or cauliflower come to mind. As for the addition of chipotles: probably delicious, but a completely different soup. Really enjoyed the purity and straightforward freshness of this.

I really enjoyed this soup, but it is at it's very best when enjoyed freshly-made. This is a (rare) example of a soup that does not get better as it sits. It is so quick to prepare, however, that to make it just-in-time is no trouble at all!

I made this soup tonight for my family, and even my picky 8 year old liked it so much he had "thirds"! I jazzed it up a bit by throwing in some frozen corn, and used a can of diced plum tomatoes in place of some of the broth, left out the jalapenos but added some chipotle tabasco sauce to give it a bit of depth (I put the bottle on the table so my husband and I could add more afterwards; if it was too spicy the kids would not have eaten it!). We sprinkled some grated cheese on top, and, muy bueno!!

Very simple! I used more broth because that's how much came in the can; didn't have orzo so broke up some spaghetti into small pieces, but followed the recipe closely besides that.

I halved this recipe to serve 2. For my 1/2 recipe I used 1/2 of a chipotle pepper in adobo sauce in lieu of the jalapeno pepper. Also used the required 1/8 cup of lime juice. It turned out so sour and limey that I had to add about 2+ tsp. of sugar to make it edible. The final product was very good, but next time I would cut the lime juice in 1/2. It also could have used more orzo.

This soup is outstanding! I've served it to many family members as well as guest and everyone loves it. It isn't too rich or heavy but is still quite filling. I've tried a number of very similar recipes but this one is the best! It is also very quick and easy to make.

On the subject of chipotles, I'm gonna make y'all jealous. I have a friend who grows quantities of jalapenos, and each year, he smokes and cans them. I think we are using some from 1999, and they are still good. I added more lime, and a can of rotel tomatoes. I like cilantro, so I added a little more, and I also garnished with the avocado and tortilla strips. The addition of the carrots is a good idea, too.

I live in northern Minnesota & get chipotles in every grocery store I shop in. Even the super Wal-Mart has them. Like about $1.40 a can. They are in the Mexican section. I love the smokey flavor they give dishes. I add them to anything that calls for spice. But add a bit at a time. The heat can get pretty intense. Hint: After opening a can, place them on a plate in tablespoon portions, freeze & then bag for use later.

I'm surprised by the comments for chipotle. The local Ralphs (i.e. Krogers) carries them along with other basic canned Latino staples (maybe it's a West Coast thing?). I actually prefer the taste of fresh jalapenos however, and will put in more vegetables (carrots and maybe corn) to this dish next time.

Very tasty. Use more lime juice (2 limes' worth) and add it at the very end with the cilantro, or the flavor will cook off. And definitely use a chipotle in adobo instead of jalapenos, for a smokier, more interesting heat (my chipotles were muy caliente, so one was plenty!).

Nicely-surprisingly good flavor! The two jalapenos take it out of the league for anyone that can't handle food with a KICK. Once the ingredients are all sliced up, this soup is instant gratification - no long cooking required - following the time given works great. I ended up using 4 small Roma tomatoes (seeded), and added them at the very end with the orzo to prevent over-cooking, and it retained more red color which made for a more colorful presentation. Definitely a keeper! Hits the spot well with a glass of Pinot Grigio.
