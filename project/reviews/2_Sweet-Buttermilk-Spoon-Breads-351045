This was just not appetizing at all. maybe you have to live in the south to enjoy this, something you grow up with. We, in California, are not fans.

Delicious. These raised beautifully for me and the texture was great. They were even good for me. My batter was very light and airy prior to baking.

I am a very experienced cook and I followed the recipe exactly. The spoon breads did not rise at all and certainly didn't look like the photograph! The flavor was really delicious so I will try again but it seems to me that the batter is too dense and heavy to allow the egg whites to help it increase in volume. Has anyone else tried? It really is a nice flavor.
