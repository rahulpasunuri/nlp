I didn't have high expectations for this recipe but tried it just because I had all of the ingredients. I used garlic cayenne rice bran oil for the vegetables instead of olive oil for some kick. The salt was way over the top, and yes, I used kosher salt. My son (a cook at a high end health food market) came home just as I was dishing up and said, "great presentation". Almost left out the chives but it made the dish pretty. Thought it would be too simple to serve guests but now that I tried it, I would have no problem serving it to others with the salt cut in half.

I roasted cauliflower on the side and didn't add it to the chicken pan. To keep the juices from splattering everywhere, at about 30 mins, I covered the chicken with a foil tent. The chicken was moist, the skin was crispy and my preschooler loved it. He gave me two thumbs up and told me to make it again!

I would give 3 1/2 stars if I could. The chicken was moist but not as tasty as the potatoes and carrots, which were really yum.

This is one of our favorite go to recipes for chicken and I can't count the times I've made it using whatever vegetables may be available. We have done sweet potatoes, butternut squash, carrots, parsnips, and cauliflower in large chunks. Never fails, always delicious and great for when you are having company on a week night.

This is my fave roasted chicken recipe. You MUST use coarse kosher salt or cut the amount at least in half. I've read others reviews and apparently I'm the only person so far who adds quarters of onions... yum! Can't imagine it without them. One thing that is not mentioned: while the chicken is "resting" and the veggies are cooking I place the thighs on a dish and wrap with alum foil. I'm a decent cook but for some reason I've never been good at chicken... my kids refer to this as "the chicken dish mom does well".

This is in our standard weeknight rotation. I modify things a bit as follows: I cut back on the salt (1/2 T) and I roast the vegetables for a total of 20-30 minutes so they don't get too soft. I think this depends on the size of veggies you prefer. The salt makes the chicken skin crisp up so nicely but we don't usually eat much of the skin (in a somewhat weak attempt at being healthier) so the salt doesn't bother us as much as it would if we were to eat the skin.

Rating: 0
This was OK for me but I probably wouldn't make it again as there are more interesting recipes out there. I generally don't use salt in cooking (prefer to let people add it themselves after serving) so I didn't have an issue with that. I just added a tiny amount of table salt to the chicken before roasting and that was plenty.

We love this recipe and use it with fresh herbs and whatever veggies are handy. I made it again tonight with less salt (it is a bit salty), but the skin didn't crisp up as well.

Rating: 4
Really, really good and very quick and easy. Made it with baby carrots and new potatoes, so no peeling or cutting required. It was not too salty--I think folks whose dish came out salty probably used table salt instead of coarse kosher salt. Remember that you get more table salt in a teaspoon than you do coarse salt, and only use 3/4 of the amount if you need to substitute. I do agree with others that it was way too greasy. I think I'd skip the olive oil on the veggies completely, then partially de-fat the drippings before tossing the veggies with them. I definitely would NOT skip using at least some of the chicken fat, because it absolutely made this dish delicious.

Rating: 4
This was tasty and super easy. Maybe people who thought this was too salty used regular table salt??? To the salt mixture, I added 1 tsp. chopped, fresh rosemary and 1/2 tsp. garlic powder. To the veg, I added one onion, sliced into wedges and a few cloves of garlic. I also cut back on the oil a bit b/c there were plenty of drippings.

Rating: 3
Made this tonight using boneless skinless organic thighs. Added some onions & mushrooms. Very good! I'm sure I didn't use the full amount of salt or oil & it was fine. Probably could have used a little more oil, since my thighs were skinless. I look forward to making it again with skin-on, bone-in thighs.

Rating: 4
This is one my families favorite recipes. I don't reduce the salt and I think it tastes great but from a health stand point I suppose I should. I brush the chicken with a tiny bit of olive oil and I cook the veggies separately and then combine the chicken and veggies for the last half hour.

Rating: 1
Seriously?? I cannot believe the great reviews. I just wasted time and food in making this inedible dish. WAY too much salt, the vegetables started to burn, and were mushy and greasy. Nearly inedible. I wish I had read to the end first before deciding to make this one, and realized that the vegetables get cooked separately (holy waste of time, batman!) and that nearly everyone is saying use less salt and oil. Bleh.

Rating: 4
This was outstanding! After reading the reviews I did decide to use a lot less salt, and it was perfect! I cooked it with turnip and sweet potatoes cut into chunks and they were both spot on! I also cooked the chicken and veggies in separate pans but at the same time before combining and cooking a little longer to cut down on cook time! I'll be making this recipe a lot!!!!

Should have read the reviews about the salt... definitely too much on the chicken. otherwise the recipe is good. I used large red potatoes cut to wedges and broc. instead of carrots just cuz thats what we had. Turned out good and only had a bowl and pan to clean on a week night- always a bonus.

This dish was excellent. I'm not fond of carrots so i used turnip and butternut squash. just had to make sure the turnips were put in before the potato and squash for about 1/2 hour. The chicken was crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside. Just the perfect fall dinner.

This was easy and yummy. Garlic is my go to ingredient with chicken, and I was glad to have a recipe that did not include any for a change of pace. The veggies were homey and delicious. I used small red potatoes because that is what I had on hand and added some celery.

I took advantage of a sale on chicken thighs but then didn't know what to do with them. So glad I found this recipe. Only change I made to the recipe was to decrease the amount of oil to about 2T. Everything came out fine. I loved the veggies, even cold straight from the fridge the next day. A definite keeper!

This recipe is so simple but it's so good. I follow the herb part exactly, but for the potatoes I use a mix of, well, potatoes, and usually onion, cauliflower and broccoli. It's always delicious, and the kids beg me to make it all the time. It's in our bi-weekly rotation, especially in the winter months.

This is sooo yummy! I used less oil, and baked chicken and veggies at the same time in 2 separate casserole dishes for 30 min. to save time, then combined together with drippings for another 15 min. For veggies I used sweet potatoes (so good), carrots, and purple onion-colorful very flavorful dish. I added garlic cloves. Friends raved for days!

Second time reviewing this recipe, made it for the second time this evening - absolutely delicious and so easy, yet again! For veggies I used red potatoes, onions, carrots, and broccoli, cut up into big chunks. The broccoli was especially tasty. Once again, I cut way back on the oil and skimped on the salt (I would use less than a teaspoon). I will make this again and again!

Easy, cheap and delicious for a quick weeknight meal. Like many other reviewers, I cut back on the oil - I hardly put any on the chicken. My chicken also didn't render a ton of fat, so I used it all over the vegetables, but if you render a lot of fat you may consider pouring some off. I also included parsnips and onions with the vegetables, and the onions were particularly enjoyable. Last modification - I sliced a lemon cross-wise and slipped a lemon slice under the skin of each chicken thigh for a little added flavor. My husband loved this, and I will definitely make it again. It also heated up nicely the next day for lunch!

Great recipe and great comments/tips from everyone! I especially appreciate the notes regarding the potential smoking (I am totally paranoid of setting off the smoke detectors in my condo). I noted this and tried the recipe at 375 for 30 min. then pump up the temp to 400 for 35 min and it worked great! Also, I put the chicken and veg in separate baking pans (not sheets, to help keep it cleaner in the oven) to start then after the first 30 min. put the chicken on top of the veg and finished it at 400 deg. for 35 min. Very simple and delicious, plus the chicken looks really good. Definitely making this again.

My mom used to nestle the chicken pieces in the potatoes and onions(not carrots), dot with butter and roast all together at 350. This was to die. The spices gave off such a great flavor and the high heat made the chicken crisp. I used much less salt than called for. What a great variation on an old comfort food dish.

Epicurious is such a great site - I come home with chicken thighs, type it in the search field and this pops up. I read the reviews and decided to try it. I used boneless skinless thighs, carrots, onions, potatoes, and garlic, and cooked them at the same time in two dishes for 35 minutes at 400. The sage/nutmeg rub is very good on both parts of the recipe. I will try this again when I have bone-in and skin-on thighs too. I recommend it, the kids ate it right up.

Easy but not quick, but worth the time! I also cut back on fat - but I skim some of the chicken fat, instead of cutting back on oil. For the veggies you can use what ever is around - sweet potatoes were great, onions, some garlic cloves...

A delicious dish, which is in regular rotation at our house. The crispy, highly-flavored chicken skin is the best part. As written, the original receipe is a little greasy, so we always cut back on the oil.

This was really really easy and although I did not roast vegetables and meat together as some suggested, I would certainly give that a whirl next time. I only had two sad looking carrots on hand (that I'm ashamed to say I used) but I did have the yukon gold potatoes (that never happens). The recipe is very forgiving and as substitutions I threw in onions, sweet potatoes and some brussel sprouts that were also on their last legs. It was delicious and again: EASY!!! I love anything that makes it look as though you know what you're doing.

I have made this many times as my kids and husband love it. Followed others advice of cooking chicken and veggies at the same time and found it much easier and less time consuming. Recently added onions and garlic to the veggies and it made flavors so much better! Also cooked it for 25 minutes at the end which made the skin crispy delicious. Have fun and enjoy!

Simple, quick, and delicious. I ended up using only half the saltthyme mixture and it tasted great (I eat less salt than the average person). Also followed the others advice and cut the carrots in big chunks, and quartered the potatoes - they cooked perfectly. I cooked the chicken and vegetables in separate sheets, at the same time, to save time. In the end, I did not put the chicken on top of the veggies for fear it would make them mushy, instead I put a cooling rack over the veggies and the chicken on top. Veggies were nicely caramelized and chicken crispy.

This was way too salty and greasy. I made it exactly as written, using kosher salt, not table salt. The carrots tasted like salt. The potatoes were like little sponges soaked with oil. I'm going back to roasting potatoes my old way, with a very little bit of olive oil and a sprinkling of kosher salt.

I used this recipe as a sort of "baseline" -- we already had julienned carrots, zucchini, and yellow squash, plus some thinly sliced yellow onion, so I used that as the vegetable mix, in addition to some garlic and the salt and pepper. Also, we used rosemary instead of thyme and omitted the nutmeg. This is the first time I made chicken (George Forman grills don't count, right?) when I was actually happy with the results. In short, it was delicious. I would definitely make again -- maybe next time I'll try the nutmeg!

This was a lovely and delicious dish that I'll be making again and again. So simple and quick! I decided to save time and followed other reviewers' advice by cooking both chicken and veggies simultaneously in separate dishes for the first 30 min, then placed the chicken with juices on top of vegetables for the remaining 15 or so minutes. My oven runs hot so I decreased the heat to 375, however 400 would probably do for everyone else. I added sweet potato, onion, and whole garlic cloves to my mix which absolutely MADE the dish! Subbed allspice for the nutmeg as I was out, and doubled the amount. Next time I make this I will prob double the nutmeg as well and still add allspice. To spice things up I added cayenne pepper (to taste). Because coarse kosher salt is in fact less salty than table salt, I used the entire Tbsp and was glad I did. Don't be afraid! This was a huge hit. My boyfriend raved and I was pleased with the outcome as well as the minimal work and cleanup!

Easy and excellent! I used boneless thighs, so cut back cooking time and finished crisping skin under the broiler. Also cut back potato and carrots and added onion, sweet potato, parsnips and garlic. We disagree with the wine pairing; we tried a chard, but maybe because of the additional veggies, we found a chianti was a much better choice.

Like several other reviewers, I used olive oil instead of butter and I did not have a problem with smoke. I also added onions, and used boneless, skinless chicken thighs (which took less time to cook) and cooked everything in 3 ceramic baking dishes (split up the veggies for maximum crispiness) at the same time and it turned out great. Even my picky kids really enjoyed it! Next time I will add chunks of sweet potatoes and whole garlic cloves to the mix.

This dish was dee-lish! My picky grade school kids said it was their favorite chicken ever. I had to sub in one boneless skinless breast with the thighs b/c it's what I had on hand. I think next time I will use half thighs and half breasts (with skin and bones). The potatoes I had were a mix of yukon and regular Idaho which worked fine but the yukon's flavor definitely won out in this recipe. Also added some peeled whole garlic cloves to the mix b/c we love them. One thing to be aware of - as others have said, this recipe could be quite smokey. I had a heavy duty hood fan going and the kitchen still smelled like smoke. And the oven was a bit of a mess. Still planning to make it again this week though!

Quite good and quite adaptable. The sort of 'no recipe needed' recipe. I used 2 whole chicken legs, 1 parsnip, 2 small carrots, 2 shallots, 1 yukon potato and 6 unpeeled cloves of garlic, and fresh thyme sprigs. Following the cooking instructions, I think that the chicken legs could have roasted a bit longer and the vegetables were overcooked by the time they were brown. So, next time I will use only thighs (or try bone-in, skin on breast), and I will leave the vegetables in larger chunks.

I had to reduce the initial 450 chicken temp to 375 after the first 15 minutes to control the smoke, my smoke detectors went off I had to open a few windows,but it was worth it, next time I'll add onions and cut carrots larger.

This was simple and delicious. The initial separate cooking of the thighs and veggies made the components much crispier than they would have been if cooked together. I added about 1/4 cup minced parsley and 1/4 medium minced onion to the salt and herb mixture and rubbed it on the chicken (the onion made it too moist to sprinkle). Just a down home comfort dish that fit a weeknight without stress. Will definitely make again and again.

I ave made this 2X. I reduce the salt; reduce by 1-2 Tbsp some of the chicken fat before adding veggies and pan juices. I also parboiled my potatoes and carrots. The carrots really carmelize nicely. I could serve this for company -- looks great on platter.

I found this very boring and basic and not interesting enough to make again. I followed the recipe and thank all who mentioned the oven splatter and made it instead in a large roasting pan, which fit all the veg in perfectly. I was wary about the salt measure, but recall that coarse Kosher salt is less salty than table. Moreover, I did use whole chicken quarters (thigh and leg)--which I highly recommend doing--so the salt mixture is spread over more protein. While it was fairly easy and tasted alright, it just wasn't anything special.

Easy and satisfying mid-week meal. I used a 9x13 glass baking dish given previous complaints about smoking oven and messes. I used Russet Potatoes instead of the Yukon because that is what I had on hand. I also added sweet potatoes and onions to the vegetables mixtures to diversify a bit. I didn't think things were too salty, but I did cut back on the kosher salt a teensy bit, added a few shakes of cinnamon, doubled the nutmeg, and added garlic powder as well. Cut about 10 minutes on the last step. Everything was cooked up nicely!

My husband and I thought this recipe was absolutely delicious. We used half the amount of carrot and added the same amount of parnsips as they are a winter favorite. My only change would be to use a scant tablespoon of kosher salt rather than a full Tbs. We couldn't taste the nutmeg probably because we used too much salt. Also, rather than making potato spears, we just quartered them to save some time. Even my 3-year old loved this dish. We highly recommend it!
