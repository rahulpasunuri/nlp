Not worth the effort. I would skip the caramel sauce and simply make peach turnovers. However the lemon ice cream is absolutely delicious.

I thought this was a great recipe to do for a dinner party. I didn't peel the peaches since I was pressed for time but no one noticed. The carmel was a cinch and made for a nice presentation. I had to use Lemon sorbet and put it on the side but can see where ice cream would've been perfect. Loved it! Low amount of prep.

Never again. Sigh. My caramel went from clear to dark, dark within seconds. I yanked it off the heat immediately, but gee, it sure didn't take 10 minutes. Maybe because I halved the recipe...? In any event, I didn't like the caramel with the peach, even taking into account that mine was probably a little too dark and bitter. Plus, splatters of hardened caramel all over the stove and counters. I didn't even think I was being messy. I've made caramel before, no problem... I don't know. Cute idea, but won't do it again.

This dessert looks far more complicated than it is. It has a beautiful presentation, but is a cinch to put together (except for peeling the peaches, I hate that part.) I hope to remember it for next summer too. I served it with the Greek Yogurt Ice Cream from the same issue of Bon Appetit. I'm not sure I would like it with Lemon Ice Cream.

This was a hit last night. Used 4" custard cups (about 1 cup) which worked out just fine. If you pre-cut the puff pastry you don't need to go out and buy that odd 9th cup. Our peaches were slightly under ripe put pared with vanilla gelato the tartness of the peaches balanced nicely. I can see using this recipe for other seasonal fruit.

This was great. I put the custard cups on a baking sheet as placing them on the oven rack would cause them to spill, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

The picture is not correct, but the recipe is, and it's delicious. Very easy to prepare.
