Very good, very easy. I used more bread and more cream, and I used some swanky 70% chocolate, chopped up. I wouldn't use more chocolate or cherries -- there was plenty, even with an increase of the bread ratio.

This was delicious. I used challah rolls for the bread and tossed it with melted butter for ease. I also baked it in one large shallow dish. The dried cherries were wonderful.

Outstanding! Can't wait to make it again. I had an old loaf of Italian bread - used 4 slices instead of 3; also used choc. chunks instead of chips. Next time, Ill remember the nuts and also add fresh nutmeg to kick it up a notch. Cream is an essential addition at the end. WOW!

To Rory from Ireland: half and half is a commercial dairy product that is half cream and half milk. I would imagine you could simply mix cream and milk together if half and half is not available in your country.

Could someone tell me what half and half is. Recipe sounds nice enough but would like to know what goes into it...

This was easy and delicious. I actually used canned tart cherries and instead of the Kirsch, used some of the juice from the cherries. Awesome dessert!

This is a wonderful fast and simple dish for all occasions. I melted the chocolate chips which gave a decadent dimension to the already fabulous dessert. The addition of toasted pecans would really push this recipe to four forks! I will also serve this with brandied custard during the cold winter months. Comfort food for the soul.

Cook from Pennsylvania, since when do the marshmallows have more flavor than dried cherries? I think this recipe is great, and I loved the combination of chocoate and cherries. The only thing I would change is substitute wheat breat for white.

Very nice texture and flavor. I especially liked the addition of the cherries. They cut the sweetness and was a nice change to the flavor of the traditional bread pudding

I think you could make any bread pudding in ramekins this way. It really is quite fast and easy! The bread pudding was quite tasty and I loved the sugar crust on top. That being said, I don't think the dried cherries are worth the expense in this pudding--they didn't seem to have much flavor. I added chopped pecans to half of the servings--wonderful. I think a better substitution for the cherries would be marshmallows and pecans.
