An excellent fall soup, very easy. It really does need the creme fraiche or a substitute like plain yogurt, that really makes it.

Very lush and flavorful but easy to make. Can be made a day ahead and reheated just fine. I would say watch how much chicken broth you add so it doesn't become diluted or thin - I though thicker was better. I had a little trouble getting it smooth and I left out the celery which suited my tastes better.

I will come back with more information and a rating after I make this, but here's a tip for people having difficulty finding chestnuts. I found them in a small bag in the snack aisle of my local Asian market. $1.00 for 150g! I've used them before in the Brussels sprouts and chestnuts recipe on this site, and I couldn't tell the difference between them and the vacuum-packed ones I can find about 2 months of the year for $7.

This soup was tasty but too sweet for our taste. The apple flavor was overwhelming.

After searching 2 organic markets and a major grocery chain, I couldn't find chestnuts here in March. So, I substituted some Butternut Squash. I can't say if tastes the same as chestnuts, but the overall product turned out quite nice. I agree that an immersion blender is the way to go.

A word of caution: We encountered a teensy problem blending the hot soup; our blender has just two speeds, fast and faster, and not once, but three times the hot soup spewed out of the shut lid. Finally we learned to pulse rapidly, but we should have used our immersion blender instead. Chestnuts are not easy to find in Southern California in March, by the way.

great recipe. i often make soups from whatever vegetables i have around, normally carrots and potatoes, so this soup definitely changes things up a bit. i used tips from another reviewer and used leeks instead of onions, and i did not have any brandy so i used cognac instead.

This was a great recipe! Easy and yet very unusual. I used 2 medium leeks instead of the onions and liked the flavor. Definitely will make again.
