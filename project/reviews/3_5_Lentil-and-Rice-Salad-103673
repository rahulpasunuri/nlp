Yuumy salad I tripled the recipe and used brown basmati rice and didn't have the tomatoes or parsley but added toasted caraway and some sea salt and it turned out great.

Yumm. I'm eating leftovers and enjoying more than I did at dinner last night!! I used a brown rice mix from Trader Joe's, and 1/2 cup french green lentils, otherwise followed the recipe. it was great - would still be great with any combination of fresh herbs and chopped veggies added in. This will definitely be a keep in our rotation.

Excellent recipe! Can virtually add any veggie you like to the salad. I added yellow pepper. Next time I will either reduce the amount of rice or increase the amount of lentils so that there is more of an equal amount of the two.

Delish! Great for a summer dish/side. I made it with brown rice and added about a tbs of fresh mint which gave it a nice light bite. My two year old even loved it!

This was surprisingly delicious! I served it to 70 people for lunch and it got lots of wonderful reviews. It goes perfectly with lamb.

This was very easy to make and tasty. Everyone loved it. I will definately make it again.

Yummy, healthy snack to take in Tupperware® bowl on a hike since it does not require intense refrigeration!

This salad is very tasty. I think that the cherry tomatoes add something that regular chopped tomatoes would not, so I would be hesitant to make that substitution. I used dried instead of fresh dill, and much less fresh parsley than called for (Never liked all that parsley in tabouleh salad much either). I served it with hummous and pita. Yum!

I made this recipe one night when looking to use up some of my fridge contents...LOVED IT! Took it to work and my friend loved it too. I've since given the recipe out...people keep asking for it...go generous on the lemon...it gets a little lost in the starch and grains..ENJOY!

I used cilantro in place of about 1/2 the parsley which gave it some extra flavor. Excellent served with pita bread and hummus.

This is one of our favorite recipes to make. We made one substitution, and make the citrus dressing with lime juice instead of lemon (and serve with a lime wedge) Delicious!

I am not a rice salad person, but the was outstanding. Could very easily be a main course. Left a very good after taste.

This dish was a supreme disappointment. It took a long time to prepare and in the end was bland and uninteresting. I added corn, which slightly improved the flavor and texture, but overall, I would not recommend it.
