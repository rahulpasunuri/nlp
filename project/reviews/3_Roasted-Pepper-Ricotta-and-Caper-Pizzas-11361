I wasn't sure about the ricotta without any other cheese in this recipe, but it was quite good. This method of roasting peppers was particularly painless and resulted in bright and tasty results. Loved the balsamic vinegar with the peppers! I used a different crust , so can't comment on the crust recipe.

While, I'm planning on using roasted bell peppers in place of sauce again. I'll use a different crust and probably skip the ricotta. The crust is like a cracker and the ricotta has a somewhat grainy texture heated like in this recipe. The capers and peppers were terrific together and I'm not a caper fan. I put some anchovies on top and those were devine. So I'll add just a little mozzerella and/or feta and a tastier crust and this will have a few more calories and better taste. But, it won't be this exact recipe again.

This pizza had a nice balance of vegetable, cheese, and the capers added just the right touch. The recipe was fairly easy and absolutely delicious, a favorite of ours and our guests.
