Good, not great, and probably not one we'll use again. The compote was a lot of unnecessary work and the honey was overwhelming the fruit making the fool too sweetish. We generally like fools,but a basic rhubard compote ould have been better.

This is much more trouble than necessary; good rhubarb, sugar and a little lemon juice makes a fine fool. I would have made the rhubarb strips except that I have no idea how much water to use for the syrup.

Tasty, but too rich. I might cut the cream back to a half cup if I made it again. Fascinating spicy notes, maybe from the great local honey I used. I made killer nutty shortbread from Maida Heatter's Book of Great Desserts to go with it, which kind of outclassed the fool.

Really interesting, but probably wouldn't make it again. About 1/2 my guests enjoyed it. If I were to make it again, I would be more aware of the type of honey I used. This time I used a basic store brand organic honey and it was too strong.

I really enjoyed the flavors of this recipe and my husband loved it! This is the first time either of us has ever tried Rhubarb and unfortunately for me it will be the last :( Turns out I'm extremely allergic to it lol. I ended up in the emergency room.

Nice recipe. I've never tried a fool before, but I like the combination of flavors. I don't think I'd change anything, although I'm somewhat curious to know how this would taste if the fruit were processed and given a finer texture.

Everything about this is great. But kids and adults would both enjoy it at the same time if you do everything the same, but after you trim and cut the rhubarb, put them in a bowl and lightly coat them in sugar for a few minutes. You can still taste the wonderful rhubarb flavor, but then kids would be able to eat and enjoy it with the adults. Doing that doesn't make them too sweet, it just takes that extra bite out that the kids don't like.. Enjoy. :)
