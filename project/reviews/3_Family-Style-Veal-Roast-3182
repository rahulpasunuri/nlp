This is a wonderful dish and no one seems to know about it. It's simple to prepare (except for the time-consuming meat browning and I omitted the ham hocks), fills the house with wonderful smells and is absolutely delicious. Try it!

Made this for a birthday celebration; my Hungarian son's eyes popped out of his head at the sight of all those different meats on one platter (very Transylvanian!). Flavor of all meats was very good, but the sauce was problematic: there is a tremendous amount of liquid left in the pot, and the short ribs and sausage are so fatty that it really should have been degreased before boiling it down, but I was out of time and so blew it off, boiling liquid down and serving as-is. There were no complaints from the males at the table, but to my taste it was very greasy. Be sure to make the vegetables, as they were the hit of the evening and very easy to prepare after all the peeling and chunking are over. In fact, the whole thing was easy to prepare, a good make-ahead feast with the sauce caveat.
