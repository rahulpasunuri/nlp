I added 1/2 cup extra milk and the batter was still too thick... not a conventional crepe recipe as I know it. I made a variation on the cider syrup using a blueberry beer and the outcome was delicious! Thumbs up for the syrup.

The addition of baking powder to the batter made the crepes strangely spongey and the batter too thick. I had to add about 1/4 c. more milk. I also used melted butter instead of oil so that I didn't have to chill the batter. I much prefer the Betty Crocker cookbook recipe but can't find my cookbook!

Airy, thick-type crepes. Never tried cider syrup, used maple syrup instead. Now our standard recipe, yummy.
