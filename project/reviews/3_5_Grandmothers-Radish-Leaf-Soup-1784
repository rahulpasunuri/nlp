Wow, delicious! I would add more seasoning that just salt and pepper, personally, but very good. It uses a part of the veggie I've always just tossed out.

I made a vegan version of this with pea sprouts in addition to the radish greens; it was delicious. I replaced the dairy with almond oil and homemade almond milk, which worked brilliantly. The essential flavor of the greens still remained bright and the milk adds a bit of lusciousness.

This is as soothing as oatmeal. I like it well enough to give it 2 forks, but I increased it to 3 forks because of its virtue - I paid only 11 cents for a bunch of radish tops at my local Asian produce store, and you could substitute other greens for the radish tops. Make sure you use the russet potatoes, because the starch helps to make the soup creamier.

Great way to use ALL the radish when in season - I include chicken stock to boost the flavors.

This is a simple soup that my family enjoys, even my kids. Easily customizable to fit what you have in the refrigerator.

I reduced this to 1/3 and it made a very quick and tasty lunch for two. I used green onions, and I sauted the potatoes with the onions, and only cooked the greens for about 12 minutes. Lovely.

This soup was just potato soup to me. It is a good way to use up the greens though and I feel like it makes potato soup a little healthier. I put some Franks hot sauce in the soup because I think it goes well with greens. That really perked up the flavor nicely.

I always make this soup when the first radishes appear in the farmer's market. It is soothing and subtle in flavor, a lovely prelude to a meal.

Mild, gentle flavors. Excellent way to use those radish greens. My husband thought it was bland but everyone loved it at the party where it was served.

This was so simple, healthy and delicious. A great new use for radish greens. I did as the other cook and added some radish slices to the top and it gave it a nice flavor and a pretty presentation.

I've made this twice before, but keep losing my copy of the recipe, so this is the third time I had to find it by this, your invaluable web-site. The soup is very easy to make, uses radish tops which I used to throw away (always a pity) and is very tasty in a simple, satisfying way.

Had found a good deal on radishes with lovely greens and wondered what to do with them. I tried this soup and it was wonderful

i liked the soup very much but i went a little further i used my braun chopper i chopped some of the radishes and put a table spoon in the middle of each bowl of soup very good.
