This was a huge hit in our home. They tasted delicious and we loved the mix of chestnut, rosemary and butter. Easy too. Will make again! They are a wonderful treat to serve before dinner.

I love roasted chestnuts. The recipe sounded good and I was really looking forward to making it. However, the butter mix seemed to mute the sweetness of the chestnuts and all I tasted was spiced butter. Disappointing. I peeled the chestnuts and mixed them w/the butter, let it sit for awhile. It was just ok but the flavor of the chestnut got drowned in butter. People who like butter more than chestnuts will love this. I much prefer the flavor of the chestnuts alone.

The buttery, salty, peppery chestnuts smell incredible and are really good even though the flavor mostly on the outside. The problem I have is that here in MPLS I haven't found good quality chestnuts(old and moldy)many of them. If you have access to nice plump fresh chestnuts do try this!
