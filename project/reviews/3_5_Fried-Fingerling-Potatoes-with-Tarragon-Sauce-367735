The idea is very nice. However, made by the recipe, I found the flavors to be a little unbalance. Too much salt and the lemon flavor was a bit too forward. I ended up adding two egg yolks and some more olive oil, a bit of white wine vinegar, and a little sugar. With the rebalancing, it was delicious. When I make it next time, I will totally replace the lemon juice with white wine vinegar. Also not totally convince on the toasted capers, I will probably just use them straight from the bottle next time.

So yummy! The fried capers are delish!

I made these for a party and they were a huge hit! Guests were hovering over me as I assembled the second batch. I couldn't find fingerlings so I used small gold potatoes. Also, watch the fry time; my potatoes were brown by about two min.
