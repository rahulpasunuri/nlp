well I gotta say it was an easy dessert to make but not so impressed with the outcome. There was no way for me to get 4 or 5 layers. max was 3. Plus the mousse was difficult to spread out over the matzo. When it thawed for the hour it was easy to cut but fell apart as I plated it. Which made for an ugly presentation, big bummer! It was an interesting idea but I won't make it again.

I gave this recipe 4 forks because everyone LOVED it and some even had seconds. I didn't love it but it was definitely an easy, fun dessert for Passover.
