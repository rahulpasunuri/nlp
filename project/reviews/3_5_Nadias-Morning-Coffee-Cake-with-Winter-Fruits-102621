This is an excellent cake, especially the 2nd day. The texture is very palatable and it keeps it's shape well. I add fennel and dried fruit as suggested by others and it is a welcome switch from overly sweet coffee cakes. Even the teenagers request it.

I made this using the recommendations of previous reviewers including less sugar and flour and lots of extra fruit. Yet I still found this bland. I regret the time I spent on it and will never make it again.

This was amazing! We don't enjoy really sweet breakfast foods so it was perfect for us. The only change I made in the recipe was to sub half of the oil with applesauce. I brought it to a friends for brunch and got rave reviews!

Great recipe, and truly Italian, I throw in some anise or fennel seed too.

Good fruit blend, but orange zest is a clincher. I substituted whole-wheat flower and it worked well but next time will blend whole wheat pastry flower.

Excellent morning coffee cake. Definitely not too sweet and my daughter who is allergic to all dairy loves this recipe. We throw in lots of apples - Matsu in particular - which are just sweet enough.

Having read earlier suggestions, I added 2 cups flour, a splash of vanilla, hand full of chopped, dried apricots, and one of my child's cinnamon applesauce containers (about 1/2 cup?). The result was a fantastic, even baked it in a heart shaped bundt pan and served it to my family on Valentines...great!

I have made this for years from the cookbook. It is a sophisticated coffee cake - NOT an ooey-gooey, loaded with sugar, damp, might as well be dessert coffee cake. I fiddle most recipes, but make this one as written.

Excellent, not-too-sweet coffee accompaniment. Consistency was perfect. A hint of golden brown gave the strongly yellow-colored cake a nice glow. Cake slices held their form and the layered fruit looked great. Parchment paper instead of butter allowed the cake to pull away from the springform pan easily and w/o the calories and fat of butter. Modifications for a slightly healthier version: 1/2 cu sugar 1 tbsp olive oil 2 cu flour 2 tsp baking powder Retain skins on 2 small pears and 1 large apple. Parchment paper to line springform pan, not butter. Used juice from 1 of the 2 cara oranges I used for the grated peel to mix w/fruit instead of lemon juice. Slices of the second orange, with it's reddish flesh, made a pretty presentation on the plate.

Very tasty. I followed other reviewers suggestions and added one of my own. I used canned tart cherries. ...about a 1/2 C. This added color and taste.

I added 1 tsp. vanilla & 1-2 TBSP. chopped candied ginger to the recipe. I also used 1C. gran. sugar & 1/3C. brown sugar. It was outrageously delicious - my husband had seconds and said this is a keeper. I made a caprese omelet to go with it. Yummy!

I love this cake -- not too sweet, not too dry, and the fruit makes it seem, you know. sort of healthy. I've made it many times over the years.

Very much like a scone in consistency...I only added pears and also a bit of shaved chocolate (no banana or apple). You definitely need a great cup of cappuccino to acompany this cake.

Much better modified to reflect the tips from other bakers: less flour (2 cup), less sugar (1 cup), lots more fruit, and 3 instead of 2 T oil. Nice for breakfast

I made the recipe just as it's given and the result seemed to me quite bland and tasteless and the children didn't ask for seconds.

Flour problems? Here's the answer: This recipe takes you right to the edge of too little flour on purpose, in order to get just the right texture (thick cake and moist bits of fruit), but the problem is that the amount of moisture in milled flour varies considerably. Also, the size of eggs varies even more considerably. The solution is to have some cream or milk handy and just add a touch if you think the dough is going to be unworkable. Do this just after the first couple strokes as you combine the ingredients. However, don't try to make the dough runny. You will have to practice until you get a dense but workable consistency. This kind of touchy-feely cooking is favored by many traditional cooks, such as Marcella Hazan.

I followed the recipe as given and found this cake to be moist and more like a tea bread in texture than a traditional cake. My family enjoyed the light fruitful flavors and they definitely want me to make it again.

lovely cake for any meal or snack.very versatile! i have made this a few times,shared it with my work mates,and my 14 yr old son even has made the cake into small loaves and heart cakes.

I served this as part of my Easter Bruch and my family loved it. The test I use is 'Would you like me to make it again?' The response was a unanimous 'yes'. I made it 2 days ahead and wrapped it in foil and put it in refrigerator and it was perfect - just sprinkled some powdered sugar on it before serving. I did use a bit less sugar in the recipe.

I made this twice this winter and thought it was delicious as is, especially the next day. The second time I added some cinnamon and extra orange peel and sprinkled the top w/ sliced almonds and cinnamon and sugar. It dressed it up for a company brunch.

No, no...the flour amount was perfect. Remember, this is an Italian cake, and not meant to be super-moist like a store-bought cake, more like a Pannetone. I love this one because it's not too sweet, stores beautifully, and is just a simple, perfectly plain cake that needs no artifice or garnish or frosting.

I made this cake for my church's coffee hour. I added the 1 tsp. vanilla and used butter instead of olive oil and it went over very big. Moist and delicious. Definitely too much flour, though.

Tasty and full of fruit.

I also altered this receipe based on the other reviews. I used butter in place of the olive oil. I used a generous 1T of orange peel and 1/2t of almond extract. I reduced the flour to 2C and then added buttermilk to get a nice thick-batter consistency. I was also generous with the fruit. It was delicious.

I substantially altered this recipe based on other reviews. I beat the sugar and eggs until light and thick; substituted butter for olive oil; used 1T orange peel plus 1t vanilla and 1/2t almond extract; cut flour down to 2 cups, and topped the unbaked cake with chopped macadamia nuts. Only needed about 40 minutes to bake, and it is delicious!

I used much less flour, just a bit over a cup, and it was much better.

I did find this batter to be a bit dry, but adding a little applesauce made it much easier to mix. I also spiced it up just a touch with cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger. It really turned out quite tasty.

the batter was so dry i had to fold the fruit in by hand. my son said it needed cinnamon, my daughter said to much orange peel, and my husband said throw out the recipe, so there you have it from my family, don't waste your ingrediants or time.
