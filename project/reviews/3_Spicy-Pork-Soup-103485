made a few changes....sauteed in a neutral vegetable oil and added the sesame oil as a condiment at serving, i added suggested clove of garlic. i had to skim the soup for it to be clear perhaps as the pork had been frozen. i added diced red bell pepper and sliced mushrooms toward the end of cooking along with ramen noodles as i didn't have fresh noodles. garnished with chiffonade of basil and added a dash of black pepper. the broth and vegetables were delicious but the pork was not tender. i think next time i will saute the pork as stated but remove it and add at the end of cooking. a variation could be made to make this soup "thai" by adding jalapeno pepper, fish sauce and lime instead of the soy sauce and the sesame sauce. one could even add coconut milk.

I made the recipe as specified except I substituted beef broth for the chicken broth. I was surprised that it tasted as bland as it did given the use of fresh ginger, sesame oil, soy sauce and cayenne. I will definitely make it again but play with the spices a bit.

We loved this recipe. It's a great way to use leftovers. Had 1/2 lb of left over pork. Added thin slices red bell pepper, minced garlic, and one jalapeno. Did not have chix broth so we used used beef broth and it was wonderful. This is a keeper and so easy to put together!

really good if you double the chicken broth, ginger and soy sauce, add diced jalapenos and mushrooms.

It was good. I added some juliene red pepper, as suggested, and asparagus (left over in the frig). When it was about done I thought it needed something, so I put about half of the broth in a seperate pan and added 2 eggs and beated them really fast, then add back to the soup. It thisckened the soup a little and gave it what I thought it needed.

This is a nice 'base' to work with and obviously lots of cooks were inspired. I doubled the amount of pork called for, using chopped pork from the grocer's and chopped it up a bit more. I added 3 cloves of minced garlic, a large shredded carrot, diced sweet pepper, some celery. I added about 2 cups of water as well and also used whole wheat pasta. I used the amount of soy called for with no issues (a preference thing and perhaps as I increased the broth/liquid.) I simmered it a little longer than called for. It was quick, it turned out great and I will make it again for sure.

This was yummy and fresh and great for a chilly Spring evening in the NW. I doubled the recipe and added 4 cloves of garlic and a jalapeno (would've added a couple more if I'd had them). I added an additional cup of broth for a total of 5 and only used 1/2 soy sauce. Also, used bean thread noodles - seemed more soup-like to me than linguine.

This was, for all its simplicity, excellent. I used a pork broth I made in an hour from a shoulder bone and a pound of ground pork (Madeleine Kamman's trick). I added a bit of celery and savoy cabbage, used chinese wheat noodles and doubled the quantity to make it more of a soupy noodle dish. This was so good that I made it again the same week by demand! It may not be authenticly Asian, but who cares? It rocked!

This soup is fast and delicious. Next time I will double the ginger.

To the cook from NY, my, what a food snob you are. I certainly hope you are not a native of Asia, because you are making a rude representation of it if so. Part of what makes the food in this country great, particularly in the last few decades - is the wonderful fusion of East meets West.. which is so appropriately AUTHENTIC for AMERICA and the wonderful fusion of cultures. How lucky we are! If it suits you, find a cuisine-specific website to visit and critique it, if you do not have anything nice to say here. To my fellow foodies, I apologize for taking up space here to address this but I felt it necessary. Now I will try the recipe.

This soup is good and easy. As others did, I added my own embellishments: a generous TB of garlic chili paste, some bok choy and whole wheat pasta. If you are a soup fan...give it a try.

My 12year old son loved this soup...and wants me to make it again. I made this after New years with my leftover fresh ham. He's a chile head. He added some of his personal habenero hot sauce to his bowl. I served with wonton crisps.

This soup was a good starting point, but definitely can be improved upon. I used one and half times the broth called for and thus it is necessary to increase the amounts of ginger, green onions, etc. I also added a few mushroom and 1/2 a red bell pepper(diced). Next time I will add a clove or two of garlic. In any case it was very easy and a good way to use up leftover pork.

New York, your claws are showing as well as your bad manners! No where in this recipe did I see any claims to "authentic". If I want "authentic" anything, I make sure it is part of the wording in the recipe. If it's not, I know I am getting someone's variation. This is an excellent variation!

Did anyone read this recipe? Its in duplicate! Did people just ignore the double of everything? Hopefully the webmaster can change this...

Uh, can I not give forks? Yet another poor soul who thinks they can create an 'Asian' dish with a few soy sauce packets. Spare me. Goes to show how pathetically unworldly the reader base is. Puhleez, lay off home-concocting Asian dishes if you don't know what authentic tastes like.

This is a wonderful dish--simple, easy to prepare, delicious and open to variations. I will definately make it again, next time perhaps with mushrooms and miso...it's open to the imagination and the ingredients in the kitchen

Loved this soup! I did take the suggestions from some to add less soy sauce. I did double the liquid, added tofu, and shredded cabbage. I would maybe add some fresh basil and julienne strips of carrots next time for color or even some shrimp.

Easy & quite good...I added some fresh shredded spinach leaves and I think asian wheat noodles might be something to try next time...garnish with a wedge of lime (for those of you who like it spicy, as I do). I think you could even add some peanuts to complement the nuttiness of the sesame oil-add them in the beginning with pork & ginger to toast them. Will make again.

This was great!!! I did reduce the soy and added a few ingredients, 1 clove of fresh garlic, 2 fresh jalapenos and 1/2 fresh red bell pepper. Quick and wonderful, we'll be having this again!

Super-easy and delicious. Would probably be just as good with chicken or tofu. Try it!

Yummy and very easy to make. I would suggest adding soy sauce to taste rather than the amount given in the recipe. The flavor of the green onions and ginger alone are satisfying enough.
