I barely review recopies but this is a definite winner. Bacon over pork tenderloin and the chutney all delicious! I used maple syrup instead of brown sugar, raspberries and blueberries instead of plum + two spoonfuls of a wild berry jam and powdered ginger instead of fresh ginger. It was still great.

Absolutely delicious. I used prosciutto and red plums (had more flavor than the black) and the entire family loved it. In my opinion, the chutney combined with the pork is what makes this recipe special.

Made for company last weekend -wife loved it & wants me do make again. I think the chutney adds a lot to the dish. Also had issues getting plums out of season but was able to, will hold the substitution suggestions for future reference.

Recipe and reviews sounded great, but unfortunately, plums aren't in season right now. Substituted plums and brown sugar for a jar of plum preserves. Family all voted yes as a keeper. Tested to see if ok prepared ahead - may even be better a day later.

Have made pork twice, was excellent both times. Have not made the chutney -- pork does not require it (though I am sure it would be great with it too). Used prociutto first time, was easier to work with; pancetta was also excellent, just took a little extra effort to wrap. Browned in cast iron skillet and finished it in the oven. Made the pork for a dinner party with rave reviews ... but will keep making for weeknight family dinners too (it is easy enough to prep and quick to cook)!!

The chutney is the perfect compliment to the meat. Fantastic! I made this last night, but substitutions did abound: didn't have pancetta or twine or charcoal, so I used regular bacon and the oven. It was still perfect. I didn't have mustard seed or fresh ginger, so I used Gray Pupon and powdered ginger. It was still perfect. I am a big believer in The Sunday Roast as a sort of special slow-down, family-together event, and this recipe fit the occasion. Really so delicious. I served with pommes de terre sarladaise and mixed greens with olive oil and lemon juice. It was a really great dinner, children and husband agreed.

OMG! Made this in the oven versus grill as it was getting ready to storm outside. Put prepared tenderloins on sheet pan and cooked bottom using two burners until it started to crisp. Then finished in 350 degree oven for about 30-35 minutes....put broiler on to crisp up the top. Other than that used the recipe to the "t". Fantastic...although the wrapped tenderloin was good the plum chutney made it "POP". Can't wait for leftovers!

Made it this weekend for the dinner and a movie crowd and they when wild over it. I made the pork as written but didn't have plums but I did have lots of fresh garden tomatoes so I used them with less of the sugar!!! Some just ate the pork and said it was the most tender and juice pork they had in a long time. This will be a keeper for me.

Made this for a large gathering last night and it was a big hit. I used peach chutney and tomato apple chutney I had on hand, but followed the recipe for the pork itself. Pancetta and herbs really added flavor!

Wonderful. Made this wih procuitto so omited any additional salt. Served with rice and grilled carrot slices and naan bread. Even the kids ate this!

Why bother? The pork is fine. The chutney just does not make it. I should have made sauerkraut and plum compote! I just wasted 4 beautiful black plums making the chutney. Vinegar and plums just does not work for me...

I hate when people change the recipe before making it as written and then review it. But, alas, here I go: I had a bounty of sale-purchased peaches and replaced the plums with peaches. It was delicious--I expect that it will be the same with any fruit. I will do plums when they go on sale at my supermarket!

The plum chutney is absolutely a perfect accompaniment with the pork seasoned with that mix of herbs. Even my husband thoroughly enjoyed it and he normally wants plain food. The weather was not conducive to grilling and since we are in Alaska at the moment and not near a store to buy pancetta, I baked the two one pound tenderloins without the pancetta in the oven at 350 deg. for 30 min. and let it stand tented for 10 min. Absolutely perfect.

The reviews are so good, I'm going to try this with the abundance of apricots I have raining from my tree in place of the plums.

Made this dish last weekend-it was excellent, very simple to make-both the tenderloin and the chutney...Used fresh herbs. Make sure you have enough pancetta to really wrap the meat-its the quite popular so you'll want to make sure you have enough.The chutney is very flavorful; the mustard seeds and ginger punch up the spiciness. I'm even considering canning some for the fall, think it'd be great with turkey.

This was outstanding -- the whole thing was very simple and easy to make -- and a lot was do-ahead so a great dish for guests. The plum chutney on its own is absolutely fantastic and oh so very easy. I also used the chutney with dinner the next night as well -- it really complemented a mini-turducken and a Herb & Bacon Cornbread stuffing (this site) made with Buttery Cornbread. Highly recommend this dish. My partner declared this the best meal he has ever eaten!

With the 90-100 degree heat this summer, this was a must. Followed recipe and it turned out excellent! I only seasoned the pork w/ salt and pepper BEFORE I put the rub-marinade on. Husband cooked it on charcoal grill. Everyone loved it! We have it tagged as a "keeper" family and company dish, as a lot of it is do-ahead. The sauce does get thicker, just let it simmer on stove. Who doesn't love sweet and savory? And the next day... it only gets better!

This recipe is absolutely delish...my 9 yr old asked for seconds. I followed the recipe to a tee-as i usually do first time around-and it was divine. Leftovers are phenomenal!!! Defiantly a keeper as is. Thank you BA

What a great (mostly do-ahead) dish. I omitted the pancetta (only because I forgot to pick it up at the grocery store). I think it is crucial to make the plum chutney the day before you are planning on serving it. The flavors really came together after they sat for 24 hours. This will be a new go-to recipe in our house.

WE REALLY ENJOYED THE RECIPE. HAD THE LEFTOVERS TWO DAYS LATER EVEN BETTER THE FLAVORS HAD A CHANCE TO MELD. I COOKED MINE ON THE GRILL AND IT WAS VERY EASY DIDN'T HEAT UP THE KITCHEN. BE SURE TO TRY THIS

I did not want to use the grill for this so I seared it on all sides in a pan until golden brown and transferred the pan to the oven and roasted it for 15-20 minutes. It turned out great!

This was so delicious. I made it with pancetta, and it turned out perfectly. The chutney was amazing, and I've made it again to serve with pork chops. An excellent recipe.

Any suggestions on doing this on stovetop/oven? Do I have to drag the grill out? Tips appreciated - Thanks!

My husband said this is the best meat dish I've ever made. I served it with the nectarine salad with plum vinaigrette from the same article in bon appetite and the blue cheese in the salad really complemented the chutney and pork!

Rating: 4
Loved this recipe, but in reality you almost don't need the sauce. The favors of the herbs and pancetta are so pleasing that the sauce (which was yummy!) almost over shadows the pork's flavors! And it's the sauce that is more time consuming than anything. Anyway a major keeper!

Rating: 4
Definitely super delicious and it will be a company meal the next time that I make it. Followed the recipe a written using thinly sliced pancet6a. Also had the sandwiches with chutney the next day and that is definitley worth having leftovers. Cooked the chutney a little longer to get it thicker and will probably use a little less sugar but this is definitley a keeper.
