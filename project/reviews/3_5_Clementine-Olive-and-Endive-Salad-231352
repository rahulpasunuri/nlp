Very good. I used canned mandarin oranges to cut down on prep time and it worked very well. I also left the olives while (pitted) and only cut the onions in half unless they were abnormally large. It took less than ten minutes and was a hit.

While preparing this I dubbed it "insanasalad". It's a crazy combination, but WOW, does it work. A lot of prep, but well worth it.

This was good and worth making again. Segmenting the clementines is a little labor-intensive, I might try substituting Mandarin oranges next time to reduce the prep time.

The mixture of flavor is wonderfull. I will do this one again. My girlfriend tried endive before and she didn't like it. However, after tasting this salade she didn't have the same opinion.

Simply excellent - a wonderfully refreshing, sophisticated blend of flavours and textures. I substituted blood oranges for the clementines and did not remove the membranes from the segments. This worked very well and the salad drew rave reviews from all diners.

This was a refreshing and contrasting start to an otherwise robust meal (followed by roast leg of lamb, potato lardon casserole, cheese course, and maple creme flan).

I have made this twice, to rave reviews...it is a delicious salad with many distinct flavors. Could not get endive so I used bibb and romaine. Also substituted naval oranges once.

This was delicious, every bite was a different taste sensation. I served this as one of the appetizers for a progressive dinner. It was a big hit. Everyone requested the recipe.

Wondeful. I had to use Spinich instead which worked out just fine. I would definately make this again. Very simple dressing that could be used in other salads.

Yes, it seems to be a wierd combination but it is VERY good. Made this for a New Year's Eve dinner following the recipe except added a few red currants for additional color. Everyone raved about it and it's a great way to use up those clementines!
