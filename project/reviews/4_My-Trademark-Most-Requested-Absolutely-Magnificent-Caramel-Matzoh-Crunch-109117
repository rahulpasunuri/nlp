An absolute must for Passover. More than one of our family call this dessert crack. One family calls it Swarm or Locust cookies because everyone attacks them like a swarm of locusts. Very easy to make. I serve it directly from the refrigerator.

This was my first time making a candy type dessert - super easy! I couldn't find any pre-made (store bought) matzohs, so I followed this recipe: http://voices.yahoo.com/unleavened-matzo-bread-recipe-passover-2841429.html?cat=22 The matzoh was thin but not crispy so it ended up being perfect combo of chewy and crunchy in the end. I made the matzoh recipe 10 times (about 30 round disks - thats a lot), then covered them with this recipe (x10) and it fed 75+ people with enough to give people a few to take home for treats. It was a hit - I was nervous making it but everyone loved it!! Because the home made matzoh was thin, I took the pieces (covered with the caramel, chocolate & nuts) and put them in the freezer to set for 10-15 before cutting them into perfect little squares. Awesome!

it is true that kosher for passover margarine doesn't combine with the brown sugar the same as butter does. after boiling rapidly for 3 minutes, if it seems broken, cool and stir until it reforms into caramel. if it seems like there's too much margarine on top, first carefully pour the "butter" on top of the matzo, then follow with the remaining caramel in the pot. the baking step somehow corrects it and the stuff is kosher crack after all! this time i made half with pistachios and half with chopped dried apricots. let the pan cool a bit, then pop into the freezer for about 5 minutes. breaking into pieces is easy. a very forgiving recipe with endless variations!

I have made this recipe six way til Sunday (whatever that means) and each time it is amazing. White chocolate, chocolate chips and peanut butter chips, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, with nuts of all sorts. My family's favorite, however, is the simplest- milk chocolate with some sea salt. I make several batches every year and give some as gifts and bring some with me. It's baking in the oven right now and I can't wait to eat it!

This is hands-down the best Passover treat (ANYTIME treat), and so easy to make. I make it every year and it is hoovered down almost immediately. It's rare to find a Passover dessert that is "good" as opposed to "good for a Passover dessert." In my gas oven, I find I need to go down to 325 degrees (not 350), but in my mom's electric oven, the recipe works to the letter. I also find that mini-chocolate chips seem to melt more easily and are easier to spread than the regular ones. (I found out by necessity when the minis were the only ones we had handy.) Absolutely delicious. THANK YOU!

My guests request this every year and once again, this year the crack didn't disappoint- I had to make a double batch! I use butter, turn oven off and put the trays in with choc chip and let the residual heat melt them. I top with generous spinkling of maldon sea salt flakes and slivered almonds. I keep them in the freezer and serve them frozen. We much prefer the texture of frozen. It's great to do ahead and it keeps forever (theoretically) but usually disappears within days.

I brought this to a seder and it was a HUGE hit! It was the first thing finished and a group of women were searching for me to get the recipe. I made it exactly as written (using butter). Be sure to pour the caramel quickly as it can become grainy. As others suggested, I returned it to the "off" oven for a couple of minutes to help the chocolate melt. I used chocolate chips and chopped white chocolate. Will try with almonds and sea salt. Easy and wonderful. Will make again and again!

I made this for two seders this year, one that was kosher and one that wasn't. The toffee was easier to make with butter but was successful with kosher for Passover margarine. The only think I found with the margarine was that it took longer to come together and didn't really "gel" until it cooled slightly, so I recommend letting it sit for a minute or two before pouring it over the matzoh. This candy was really delicious! kIds and adults alike all enjoyed it. The candy made a great gift - I made two batches for each seder, then bought a pretty plate or candy jar, put the candy in, covered with cellophane, and tied with a ribbon. It made for a nice host/hostess gift.

The chocolate chips do NOT need to be chopped. Just wait a few seconds. Don't cook the caramel too long. Martha Stewart suggests adding water & salt to the caramel; it worked well for me.

I first made this last year at Passover as a treat for my children. Now two weeks before Passover my Father is asking me if I am going to bring it to their Seder. It was super easy to make and simply delicious. Will be making probably a triple batch to ensure that there is enough for me to bring to work for my coworkers to have a taste.

This stuff is terrific! I've been making it for a year or two, now and everyone loves it. I use only the foil but spray it with pam and wipe it with a paper towel.It comes free of the foil easily.I use semi-sweet or dark chocolate chips/morsels. I put the pans back into the "off" oven for ten minutes to melt the chocolate. Spreading it evenly works out OK then. I also sprinkle with sea salt before adding a topping of chopped almonds. Score it while it's warm and cool in the freezer. It breaks into realatively uniform pieces when scored and cooled.Finally, dust both sides with confectioners sugar. Usually do a double batch at a time. It doesn't last long when the kids and grand kids come around.

hmm..interesting reviews! Growing up, Mom would make this with saltines..I was soo happy to find it using Matzoh. It seems to me that the Matzoh would be more sturdy..also-my recipe from Cooking Light suggests toasting the matzoh to enhance the flavor and crispness of it. I like the idea of breaking the matzoh up instead of starting with whole sheets for better coverage. Also, to dress it up for gift giving - why not drizzle colored chocolate (or contrasting colored-such as white over the brown chocolate)? Or perhaps dress it up with sprinkles or other decorative tops? I have all the ingredients and cannot wait to make this tomorrow! And I love the suggestion of freezing it - I didn't think that would work too well!

One of my coworkers made this recipe and brought it in to work, and oh wow, it was so delicious i had to find out which one she used and make it myself! it didn't turn out quiiiite as good as hers, and i am wondering what i did wrong. I used a fairly large pan, as the recipe calls for, and 5 pieces of matzoh, so it sounded like the right amount. did the toffee part correctly, and poured it on top...but it didnt seem like there was enough! i spread it out, but i dont think there was enough to really seep under the matzoh and coat both sides. i think next time i make it (...potentially tomorrow) i will try doubling the toffee recipe to REALLY coat it. and then, because i left it in the full 15 minutes, and probably because it was spread so thin, parts of it burned a little bit. which, i mean, its caramel, it doesnt taste horrible burnt, but it just wasnt as good. extra chocolate on top was delicious. i put the whole tray in the freezer and crack it up after - just easier that way. anyway this was still delicious, and my family is enjoying the batch i made...which means maybe which i make the double-toffee version tomorrow, i'll get to keep it all to myself!!

Rating: 4
This was the hit of my seder too. Just when people were reclining, holding their bellies and complaining they were too full, out came the crack...and it disappeared! Some tips: 1) use real butter (if you can) 2) use great chocolate (i use ghiradelli choc chips) 3) sprinkle with maldon sea salt flakes (it needs salt to offset all that sweetness) 4) toast thin almond slices and sprinkle all over (press them into the chocolate so they stick). Fortunately I made a double batch and have more in the freezer!

Rating: 4
Soooo good! Served this at our Seder, and everybody said I should sell it! I did use real butter. Also followed reviewers' suggestions to cool caramel-covered matzoh first, then drizzle on the melted chocolate. Much prettier. Then I freeze it, break it in pieces, and store it in a freezer bag in the freezer. I kept dipping into the bag for one more piece, and then one more piece... highly recommended!

Rating: 4
this was amazingly delicious- I would recommend a 1/4c more brown sugar- and use a low heat to bring the caramel up to temperature. After adding the chocolate chips I also sprinkled on diced dried fruits (mangoes, papayas, cranberries) and some whole almonds- I will make this again even when it isn't passover :D

Rating: 4
I first chose this recipe because I thought with a boastful name like that it better be good. It was AMAZING. Super easy to make, and my family LOVED it. It didn't even make it to dessert, people ate it waiting for the seder to start! I doubled the caramel and used it for 2 baking sheets of matzoh. I made two flavors but the hit was white chocolate with pistachios. I made some other passover desserts that took a lot more time and not as good as this. I will be making this every year now.

Everybody else loves this, which is why I make it, but I don't really see the appeal myself. Food snob that I am, I also find it kind of trashy, but without tasting fabulous enough in order to compensate. I'd rate it as one fork, but my friends and family gobble it down, so I'm giving it two.

I'll bet everyone who rated this 4 forks used butter. I made it with Kosher for Passover margarine. What a waste! The margarine does NOT have the same properties as butter and it never combined with the sugar. It was just an oily mess on top of blobs of fatty sugar and baking it only caused burning and LOTS OF SMOKE after just a few minutes.

I make this every Passover. It's really easy and, yes, it freezes well. After breaking it into pieces, I leave it on the pan in the freezer. Once frozen, I put the pieces in a zip lock freezer bag and store in freezer.It's almost just as good frozen, so my Passover supply can sometimes be much smaller.

We also use a variant of Bonny Stern's version (below) which is quite similar, except you don't stir while boiling butter and brown sugar, bake for only about 12 minutes, use way more chocolate chips, and you don't need to break it while hot. We break the matzah into smaller pieces so caramel seeps between and below, and we grind the chocolate fine before sprinkling, and then don't spread it. Whichever variant you use, it is frighteningly good. Bonny Stern's version: "CARAMEL MATZAH CRUNCH Passover would not be complete without this irresistible treat. Marcy Goldman, a terrific Montreal baker and cookbook author, takes credit for inventing it. " 6 pieces regular matzo (about 7x6") " 1 cup (250mL) unsalted butter or margarine " 1 cup (250mL) packed brown sugar " 2 cups (500mL) chopped semisweet chocolate 1. Preheat oven to 350F (180C). Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil. Arrange matzah in a single layer on foil  dont worry if it overlaps. 2. Place butter and brown sugar in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Do not stir. Cook a few minutes or until mixture comes together and does not look oily. Pour mixture over the matzah. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until mixture is bubbling. 3. As soon as matzah comes out of the oven, sprinkle with chocolate. It will melt from the heat of the matzah. After 4 to 5 minutes, spread chocolate as evenly as possible. 4. Chill until the chocolate and the caramel are set. Break into uneven chunks. Theres never enough!"

I'm not kosher, not even Jewish, but I'd be willing to buy a matzoh factory just to be guaranteed a supply to make this delicious dessert. Actually, it's not a dessert, it's a drug. (We served it to my in-laws and introduced it as "crack cocaine.") Added a pinch of salt and some vanilla to the caramel when it came off the stove. Used the Reynolds non-stick foil and you should, too. If you don't have a massive freezer that can accommodate a cookie sheet, you can simply let this cool to room temp, fill another cookie sheet of similar size with ice cubes, then set tray with the matzoh crunch on top of it. It will harden nicely in about 20 minutes. Yes, we'll be making this again...

This went over exceptionally well at Passover dinner. Got several requests for the recipe. I wanted to give it 3.5 forks. My only criticism might be that the toffee had a hint of graininess (I might try boiling a little longer next time). I added a pinch of salt to the toffee, used Felcor swiss bittersweet chocolate, and sprinkled toasted pecans on top. I also tried to keep the toffee from spilling to the bottom side of the matzoh -- useless effort and it's far better when both sides are drenched with the toffee. Will definitely make this next Passover.

I hate matzoh but this recipe redeems it...by turning it into toffee! A delicious treat, and easy to do. I also added a big pinch of salt and a splash of Mexican vanilla. Removed from the oven after 10 minutes as I was paranoid about burning it. And used a cup of milk chocolate. YUM!

This was easy enough and tasty enough, but not "pretty" enough to give as a gift. I was looking for a candy recipe that I could make a bunch of, but this is not it. I also went ahead and baked it at 325 and I think it was okay. I used a jelly roll pan and a little over 4 matzohs. I am not sure if I too much surface area, but I felt like the matzoh part was too evident in the finshed product, like if I had used a smaller pan maybe the matzo would have absorbed more of the caramel mixture and been less obvious. Good but I would probably not make again.

I'm sort of shocked to see this recipe listed as the writer's "trademark". I grew up on this sickeningly sweet stuff, only it was made with saltines, not matzah, and topped with walnuts. Folks in the neighborhood passed it around at Christmas time in little wintery-themed tins.

I don't know how I lived this long without hearing about this stuff, but everything people say about it is true. It is phenomenal. The hit of our seder and thank goodness I had reserved some just for us, because there were no leftovers! I preheated the oven to 350 and lowered it to 340 as soon as the matzoh went in, and it was fine. I used chopped toasted hazelnuts on two of them, chopped toasted almonds on another two, and left the last two plain. Today I'm going to make more with macadamias!

Truly fabulous! I've made two batches already, one was taken to a seder and everyone raved, and one I'm noshing on myself. Adding some salt (maybe a 1/4 tsp) to the caramel is a must; it tones down brown sugar. I didn't have any problems either with burning or sticking. It came out perfect both times. (I did line the baking sheets with foil and parchment.) The tip about melting white chocolate in a ziploc bag and piping it over was easy and produced a more professional- looking result than plain, since I wasn't sure about people with allergies. Next year, I intend to try other suggested variations with nuts. A real keeper!

This is a very easy and fun recipe for Seder. I have the same recipe from a family friend, but the oven starting temp is 350. I have never burned once! To shir932: This year I used Kosher Margarine and found that the texture was way off! Definitely use butter. With margarine it didn't mix well and was more of a caramel; butter makes it more crunch.

I thought it was delicious but I should know by now that if a recipe tells you how to recover from impending disaster - burning in this case - it will happen. Next time I will use a lower oven temp and definitely use Silpats instead of parchment, as someone else recommended. When directed to this recipe I was told to use butter, not margarine.

My first batch was a mess since I tried to cook all 6-8 matzahs at once--the edges burned as my oven isn't large enough (standard 36" oven). After the first round, the others were fine. I put in half a recipe at a time. I used more chocolate chips than called for to completely cover the matzahs. I really didn't find this to be all that great, but my guests absolutely loved it, so I gave it 3 forks. It just wasn't my type of treat, but it's great as a gift for any family with teenagers. I package little 4.5" x 3" gift boxes; one batch of this recipe filled 3-4 of those boxes, so it went really far.

I was so excited by everyone's reviews,but somehow my recipe just didn't want to work out. I started with vegetable shortening (the equivalent of parve margarine/butter) and the brown sugar. Somehow, they just never mixed together over the heat, and I ended up with a clumpy hot mess. Could it have been the sugar or the butter?

ohmygoodness this is delicious! so surprising - it tastes like english toffee! the look on my husband's face when he took a bite was priceless. He clearly didn't expect much and his eyes almost popped out of his head! I did add a bit of salt and vanilla to the carmel after I took it off the heat. I made a couple of batches - one with semi-sweet chocolate, another with semi-sweet and white chocolate, and then some without chocolate. Also noteworthy is that you can't use butter unless you are having a vegetarian seder, so beware of that if you are a guest bringing this to a seder. I don't know if it would be AS good with kosher margarine, but I'm sure it would still be yummy!

very good and so very easy. This was gobbled up by everyone at our seder, while the chocolate almond cake I found on Martha Stewart's website took so much longer and, while good, was not worth the effort.

As usual, gone again. But thanks to the person who suggested using this recipe for leftover matzah. That is exactly what I will do, then keep the crunch in the freezer! Who ever knew that matzah could taste this good????

Even though I made this with butter, my mother-in-law couldn't keep from eating it! It was delicious and will be made again & again during this Passover as well as during the rest of the year with saltines.

For those of you who keep kosher and keep kosher-for-Passover: the kosher unsalted margarine works great and Manischewitz now makes a PARVE bittersweet chocolate! I can only find it this time of year, so I stock up. It all works together perfectly. I used Reynold's Release foil and no parchment. No sticking problems. Yum!

Made this for Passover last year and was asked to bring it again this year - it's unusually delicious and easy to make. Just use heavy duty foil to line cookie sheet (with sides), you don't need parchment. Add 1/4 tsp. salt to caramel before it boils. Use 1 cup mini-chocolate chips and freeze before you break it into pieces.

I printed out this recipe last year, but I didn't make it until today. WOW! I just put it back in the freezer, taking someone's advice here that it won't get soggy. I made it with margarine, and it thickened up fine. Have to use stick margarine, not the stuff in a tub. I love it - we'll see how it goes tomorrow night!

I made two batches and not a single piece survived. There wasn't a single person at our Seder of 20+ 20-somthings who could resist it's siren call. The host even fessed up that she had hidden the last two pieces away when she saw the stash disappearing. I made two versions: one with the recipe as written but with a very light sprinkling of fleure de sel over the melted chocolate and one in which I omitted the chocolate and added toasted pine nuts and a light sprinkling of red chile flakes and fleure de sel to the hot, straight out of the oven carmel. Out of this world either way.

This is a must-have passover treat in my family. We refer to it as Matzoh Crack, too!

Rating: 4
This is the best used of matzo in the world. I just made a double batch and hope there is some left for my company. It is easy, and delicious. I used white and milk chocolate for one batch and swirled chips for the second batch. Definately a keeper and a recipe to pass on to the next generation.

Rating: 4
So I made this again last week and froze. As it happened, I didn't chop the chocolate into small enough chunks so it was a bit goopy. No problem, I just put in hot oven for 30 seconds, then spread the chocolate and then cooled the crunch. Broke into pieces, placed in ziploc bag and put in the freezer. I've only sneaked one taste but I"m certain there will be no leftovers.

Thanks to the cook from Brooklyn, we now call it Matzoh Crack too...I can't keep my hand out of the bag I stored it in.

I have made this recipe for years using saltines (of course not for Passover)and chopped pecans sprinkled on top and it was excellent, but I found a variation by Nestle a couple of years ago using a can of sweetened condensed milk in the topping, and it was even more decadently rich, although I know that is hard to believe. Wonderful toffee candy, and two points I like about using saltines is the flavor of the salt with the caramel topping, and they break fairly easily into neat squares.

Rating: 4
This is such an easy Wow! maker, I feel guilty telling people the recipe cause it's so easy. You can improvise and use white and dark chocolate for a nice marble effect. A richer variation (non-Passover) is to use graham crackers instead of matzoh. Fast, easy, delicious, easy to have the ingredients in...I just cannot say enough about this recipe! I bake a lot, I know a keeper, this is a keeper! Print it out now!!!! Make it now! You won't be sorry!! (watch the baking time, I have convection ovens and never let the caramel bake longer than 12 minutes)

Rating: 4
I make it just according to the recipe, sometimes I melt white chocolate and make a decorative design on top. Sometimes I add nuts, sometimes not. This is the most requested Passover dish I make! I have orders in from all over. It is truly one of the easiest, most uncomplicated recipes ever. And, my chocolate does not separate as one reviewer wrote, and certainly it never gets soggy, but maybe that is because we eat it too fast!!! Really YUMMY!

Rating: 4
Even better using salted matzoh and chopped toasted almonds on top of the melted chocolate!!

Rating: 4
I make this every year and people love it. One change I do is to let it cool in the pan before adding the chocolate. Then melt chocolate in a freezer ziplock bag, snip off a corner and "pipe" on the chocolate in a decorative design. I found that if you put the chocolate on when hot, it will separate when cooled, and can look lumpy.

Rating: 4
One of the top 2 Passover desserts ever (the other is a rocky road brownie which is also divine). One caveat - I found that this must be kept frozen or it gets soggy. If you make it for someone else's Passover, make sure you tell them if they plan to use it for the next night too.

I've been making this for years, it is a huge hit every time. During the year, make it with saltines (the salted ones, believe it or not), and they are fabulous. Graham crackers would be too sweet.

Fantabulous! So easy to make and had no difficulties. Added toasted pecans atop the melting chocolate (used Cadbury cause it was on sale) My husband thought the idea wouldnt be good now he's not saying a word because his mouth is stuffed with these crunchy gems!

Rating: 4
I've made this for a few years now, and when I bring it out at seder, people moan in delight (one guest calls it "Matzah Crack"). My tips: No need to chop up chocolate. Regular chips melt just fine. This dish is easy to make, but also easy to destroy - be careful not to burn them. I chill on the sheets, and then break them up once cold. Enjoy!

Rating: 4
After making about 20 batches of this over the past several years, here are my "refinements": No need to use parchment paper and oil. Just foil. Wait till they cool (I put the pan in the fridge be) before breaking into pieces. Bake at 350 for 10 - 12 minutes. Use mini chips. Also toasted chopped almonds; they will stick if you sprinkle them right after spreading the chocolate and pat them down with a spreader. One or two reviewers said that the butter and sugar mixture never thickened and combined. This has happened to me twice--and I'm not exactly sure why. It happened this year. So I tried it again but the next time with a new box of brown sugar and it was fine.

Four forks, of course. But try my updates... Use mini chocolate chips and cut with a pizza cutter.

After reading the recipe and the reviews I had to make this but had no brown sugar or bittersweet chocolate. It tasted great with white sugar and milk chocolate (also added some salt to the sugar mixture). My nine year old son says this is the best dessert he's ever eaten. He's given to exaggeration -- still this is terrific stuff and terrifically easy to make.

Fantastic. I added toasted, salted almonds between the caramel layer and the chocolate. It's lumpier, but the nuts don't fall off! AMAZING! I think I'll try making it with saltines when it's not Passover.

Rating: 3
This recipe is growing on me. I think the only change that I made that I really think it needs is the addition of salt. Following another user's recommendation, I added about 1/2 tsp. to the caramel and sprinkled a little on top of the chocolate after it was spread on the matzoh.

WOW ! I've made this for several years now and always have to hide from my husband before the Seder, lest it be gone by the time the guests arrive.

This recipe freezes will in re-sealable plastic bags!!!

this was a big hit at the seder, but the cooking time listed in the recipe is definitely too long. i started the oven at 350 (not 375) and baked it for 12 minutes (not 15) and it was slightly burnt around the edges. still yummy, though, and i'll definitely make it again!

Rating: 4
this recipe is a huge Passover favorite in my house--my boyfried's mom made it last year, so this year it was my turn! I managed to do nearly everything wrong: I used 3/4 c of sugar instead of a full cup (I was out of brown sugar, so I used granulated sugar with a teaspoon of molasses stirred in); I forgot to line the pan with parchment; and I forgot to start the oven at 375. And it's STILL delicious! I had to whisk the butter and sugar together to get them to combine--but they did so beautifully and I had no problems pouring or spreading the caramel.

A winner! So easy to make and everyone loved it! How could you ask for more, especially at Passover time!

My sedar guests definitely liked it - but I was a little disappointed because I thought it tasted like the caramel was burnt. I'm going to try it again turing down the oven a bit. For other people who had trouble mixing the margarine and brown sugar - I had no problem! I may try it again using butter, but the margarine worked just fine.

Easy and fabulous. I used ghirardhelli semi-sweet chocolate bars and it got RAVE reviews. If you've heard of "I-can't-believe-it's-not-butter!" This recipie was like "I-can't-believe-it's-not-goyish!"

Rating: 3
Made exactly as written and then fine tuned it, using dark brown sugar and an entire bag of mini chocolate chips. Once butter and sugar came to a boil, only boiled it for 1 minute (much easier to spread over matzoh). Baked at 450 degrees for two minutes, took it out and sprinkled with chocolate chips, back into the oven for another minute. Spread chocolate with knife, and sprinkled with toasted slivered almonds (Trader Joes), let cool until I could safely throw it into the freezer. Let freeze 20 minutes, take out and break with hands into pieces. WOW!!!

Rating: 3
I topped the chocolate with toasted chopped almonds. This was a real hit at the Seder. Everyone's eyes widened as they tasted it, and they reached for more. I had to use parve margarine, but can only imagine how good it would taste using butter. With other users' warnings about how eady this was to burn, I turned the oven down to 325 after 8 minutes, and the recipe came out perfectly. I also used Brownulated sugar, which is so much easier to deal with, and it was fine.

Easy and good-will definitely make again. I added a little bit of salt, maybe 1/2 tsp, to the caramel-I think the combination of unsalted butter and unsalted matzoh's was a little too sweet and bland. Used almonds, and probably more caramel to a smaller amount of matzoh-yum

Made this recipe this weekend with leftover Passover matzoh. I ate a few pieces, not too impressed. Put it out on a plate in the kitchen, the two teenage boys pretty much ignored it, my husband ate one piece and proclaimed, yuck. Threw it away Monday, morning. Face it, matzah is a dry bland food, I appreciate the attempt to create something flavorful, besides matzoh brei haven't found much.

Maybe there's a problem with the proportion of butter and sugar???? I've done this recipe with 1 cup light brown sugar and *one* stick butter -- it may help the sugar to melt into a caramel better if less butter is used. Or start with less butter and add more if needed. It's even nice to have an assortment of the suggested variations if you're having a large group over.

Rating: 3
This is divine. Like homemade Skor bars. I've already made it twice in the past two weeks!!! The key is to use real butter- I tried the margarine and it never solidified- it was a soupy, soggy mess! Real butter works perfect. Don't even have to be Kosher to enjoy this yummy treat.

Rating: 3
I did not have any problem combining the butter and sugar. Granted, it did take quite a while for the ingredients to blend in the pan. I used a whisk until everything was combined (and close to bubbling), then switched to a heat-proof rubber spatula.

Rating: 2
I had the same problem as a previous reviewer; the butter and sugar didn't really combine to make a caramel, so the matses became buttery and there were crunchy lumps of sugar all over. It separated from the matses once it was cool. Having said that: it was yummy, but not a hit.Maybe I need to cook the butter/sugar longer??? Any suggestions? I'm willing to try again!

Rating: 4
This was one of the best passover recipes we have had. My family couldn't stop eating them (adults and children alike). Most passover desserts have an aftertaste from the matzoh cake flour, but you couldn't tell that there was anything with matzoh in this recipe.

Rating: 4
This is a winner!!!! I needed to keep my husband away from the container so there would be enough for the seder. Easy and delicious - I'll be making this again to use up my leftover matzoh - won't wait til next Passover to indulge in this. BTW - also tried the Passover Chremslech on Epicurious and that was also a big hit!

Definitely a must for future Passovers. The full amount was finished with coffee after the seder, with no leftovers for the next day. Grownups and children, both, loved it.

After all the great reviews, I was not as blown away by this as I'd hoped. And I'm a huge Skor bar fan! They were good and I probably would make them again as they're incredibly quick and easy. I sprinkled half with toasted, flaked almonds, and left the other half with the simple chocolate topping. I was tempted to add a few more chocolate chips to the 'bare' patches but was glad I resisted as the given quantity turned out to be just fine. I think they'd look great, cut into long diamond shapes and bagged up in clear cellophane bags for gifts - I just wasn't that excited about the taste. With just a little extra effort, I can make 'Mom's Turtle Brownies', a family favourite with similar ingedients and layering, but with a patted-in, shortbread style base. Worth the extra effort, IMO. But many thanks to the previous reviewer who suggested that the crumbs left on the cookie sheet would be good over icecream. Boy, were they ever!

What am I doing wrong? I could not get the sugar and margarine to combine. As long as I cooked it, it stayed separate. I gave up trying, but poured it over the matzoh anyway, and then had oily matzoh with a clump of cooked sugar which I could not spread around. An utter disaster, but I want to try again. Any suggestions from anyone who has been successful with it??

Having ventured into the rhealm of cooked sugar on other occasions all I can say is Holy Moses! What a recipe! You simply have to love a recipe that is this good and can be made in under 30 minutes.

I made this with Vegan margarine and Ghiradelli Double Chocolate Chips (which are vegan), patted chopped walnuts on top of the melted chocolate..fabulous! I have 3 vegan children and desserts, especially for Passover ,can be a problem. I make this all year using a sleeve of Saltine crackers instead of Matzoh. The salty Vegan margarine made up for the lack of salt in the Matzohs. Whole Foods sells their version of this for $6 or $7 a pound.So easy to make who would purchase it? I put the cookie sheet in the freezer for 1/2 hour prior to breaking up the crunch, much easier to handle.

Outstanding. Great treat to make with kids. I used salted butter instead, and we loved the slight saltiness to enhance the sweetness of the caramel and chocolate. I did increase the chocolate to a little over 1 cup and didn't have a problem with it being too thick, although I can see the point made by other reviewers and would hesitate to get too crazy with the chocolate. I drizzled melted white chocolate chips on top and then cut into neat squares, which made a much prettier presentation for company. Everyone loved it!!

I would advise heating the matzohs in a 350 oven before spreading the butter/sugar. Also, light brown sugar appears to look better that dark brown sugar.It is important not to overcook the brown sugar/butter allowing it to become thick as it must spread over the toasted matzoh. It was the most admired dessert among many contributed ones at our seder. The children loved it.

i made this with kosher for passover margarine, and the brown sugar and melted margarine didn't really combine, causing the caramel to get very hard and sticky and unmanageable. next time i'll make it with butter -- even though then it can't really be used as dessert for the seder, but it's still a yummy treat to have throughout passover.

Oh my gosh! My friend brought me a box of matzoh because apparently it was on sale at the grocery store and she bought too much.

Easy and delicious. Both kids and adults will love it. Immediately after spreading the chocolate, I sprinkled on some Skor toffee chips. Really adds a finishing touch in both how it looks and how it tastes. As an earlier reviewer said, resist the urge to add additional chocolate chips. When you first sprinkle them on the caramel, you don't think there will be enough to spread. Once it softens, there's plenty.
