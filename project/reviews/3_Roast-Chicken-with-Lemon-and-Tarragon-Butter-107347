Recipe was delicious and easy BUT do NOT cook this at 500 degrees as the recipe indicates - that is WAY too hot for chicken. 25 minutes at 425 degrees will do the trick.

I also agree -- great weeknight meal. My butcher often has leg & thigh combos on sale and they're great for this. Crispy skin, moist, flavorful meat.

Easy and tasty. Great mid-week dish.

Very tasty, crisp skin and moist bird. Substituted herbs de provence for the tarragon. Great weekday meal with the potatoes (and picnic food).

I used double the chicken, almost half the butter & at least double the herbs & still found that for all that butter, it was still only so-so.

I liked this because it is a tasty and simple dish to prepare. (My husband put it together!) I removed the skin and baked it for 45 minutes at 375 in my convection oven. It's easy and quick. This would be good for a week night meal. Anything would go with this and children would eat this.

Needed more tarragon. A little boring. Would taste better with multiple herbs.

I've made this twice now - the first time as written, the second with sage substituting for the tarragon. I really enjoyed it as written - the lemon peel actually adds quite a bit - but I think it needs more tarragon. The sage was nice too. The skin comes out amazingly crispy and tasty when you cook it this way. Not especially different or special, but a nice weeknight dinner. Especially easy if you remember to put out some butter in the morning to soften.
