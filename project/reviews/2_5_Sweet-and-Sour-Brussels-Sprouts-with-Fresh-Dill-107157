It was tangy but delectable! Reminded me of German meals from home. I ended up with a lot of sauce and would in the future serve the sprouts immersed but not swimming...still, a taste sensation!!

Actually, in contrast to the other members, I think this dish was awesome! Sweet and sour is a perfect description...it is definately a new way to enjoy this vegetable!

I can't imagine why in god's name you'd ever make this- farty, pungent sprouts with piercing vinegar, sweet tomato sauce, and then dill to top it off. Eeeurgh!

I agree with another review -- a great way to ruin brussel sprouts. We served this dish at a dinner party recently it was it disguisting... I dumped any left overs (mostly from the guest's plates which shows you how bad this was!) and will never make this again. The "sweet and sour" did nothing for the sprouts, the dill added to the mess of flavors. Yuck -- double yuck. I love brussel sprouts so I will keep looking for other recipe ideas!

This should be called "How to totally ruin brussel sprouts." The vinegar was totally overpowering. Next time I'll just serve them boiled in salted water... which is an improvement.

My husband loves brussel sprouts and this is a great break from mundaness. If you are a sweet and sour candidate at chinese take out then you will find the taste pleasing. Fantastic served with grilled pork and rustic artisan bread. Here he gets his vegetable and I get my Czech out.
