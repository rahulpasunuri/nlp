I make bread pretty regularly (lets say buying bread is a rare occurrence around here) and know my bread baking quite well. After having read the rotten reviews I was not entirely hopeful but was guided by the positive ones -- this is amongst the finest bread recipes that I have ever encountered. The bread crumbs perfectly and is substantial yet not so soft that it falls apart. I used a stand mixer to mix and knead the dough which likely also affected the consistency of the bread. Used boiling water to soften the oats and once it was the right temperature sprinkled the yeast. You have to kinda tend it so it gets incorporated into the mix. The machine pretty well mushed up the oats which gave it this superb consistency. Not sure if it would be as good had I merely used my bare hands to knead. Works really well with that stand mixer. Excellent recipe and excellent bread. I could happily eat this morning noon and night with just butter and nothing else. Oh Glory!

I agree with foodiefiend, this bread has no taste, though the outer crunch is nice.

I have made this several times, following the recipe exactly as written. Excellent and so easy. One rising makes it relatively quick for yeast bread. Great texture. Good for toast as well as sandwiches. Nice flavor that compliments a variety of toppings/sandwich fillings. If you have never made bread before give this one a try.

Excellent every-day bread. This bread was very light, even though I substituted 1/2 cup of wheat germ. I also doubled the salt and did a second rise as other reviewers suggested. Did not use the egg wash but the bread browned nicely anyway. Also did not use a loaf pan but just shaped it into a log. Did not bake for quite as long as the recipe suggested, but I'm at 5400 feet so that may be why. Will definitely make again.

This is a soft tasty bread, my Family enjoyed the bakery smell and wonderful taste. I let the yeast set for 30 minutes and waited for a second rise. Fairly easy to make with a healthy edge. Nice!!!

Exceptional bread. Modifications: 2 tsp salt. 1/2 cup buttermilk and 2 cups water (instead of 2 1/2 cups water), I didn't have oatmeal, so I used 3/4 cup pinhead oatmeal, and 3/4 raisin bran minus the raisins. It's wonderful and hearty. I always use a high gluten flour like King Aurther's to make it nice and soft. Try it!

I love this recipe. I added more salt, as others have done, and it was very good, not to mention lovely. The extra oats on top made a pretty presentation.

Excellent bread! I made a few slight changes.I used half graham flour and half all- purpose flour, brushed the top with melted butter (out of eggs), and upped the salt to 2 t. I also did two rises, although I'm sure one rise would have produced good results and saved some time. The result was very good and I will make again.

An easy, delightful oatmeal bread! I prepared it according to the recipe, and yes, it is a little bland, but I actually like it this way, because it doesn't overpower any topping. A warm slice topped with butter or honey is just delicious. I will certainly make this again!

I've made this bread three times now and it's come out perfect every time. I made just a few modifications. As suggested, I added more salt -- 2 1/2 tsp. Also, I followed the method used for the Yankee Oatmeal Molasses Bread on Epicurious (which is also great), soaking the oatmeal in 1 3/4 cups boiling water (along with the butter and most of the sugar). I used the remaining 3/4 cup water to proof the yeast with 1 tbsp. of the brown sugar, then after 10 mins. added it to the oatmeal mixture. I let my Kitchenaid do most of the hard work mixing the whole thing (until it starts bumping up and down!), then have fun kneading it on a board for a while. I also did two rises. With regular bread being so expensive lately, not to mention artisan breads, it's been fun to return to bread-baking over the past few months. You get healthier, tastier bread for a whole lot less money.

Great recipe. I used half the yeast, let it rise for an hour each time (what's the rush?) and also used part milk for the liquid and added the wheat germ as someone else suggested. Also, added used almost 2 tsp. of salt (as others suggested.) A slow rise is always better. Turned out really great.

I've made this bread three times now. The first time was exactly as written. Wow. Not enough salt, too wet, too much yeast and not enough kneading time. My other attempts yielded much better results. I added one tablespoon of salt, used half bread flour, half all-purpose (adding all six cups of flour before mixing and kneading, half the yeast and kneaded for about one half hour. Also, I glazed the tops with an egg beaten with a tablespoon of cream. Very nice.

this bread is amazing... so far i've made it three times (but i half the recipe each time so i get just one loaf when i bake it up), and each time i changed something slightly. so far, my favorite variation is to add a half-cup of wheat germ in place of one half cup of flour. it gives the bread a really nice nutty flavor on top of the oats, and adds some additional nutritional merit as well. just be sure to add salt (i do about 1 to 2 tsp), or the bread is a bit flavorless.

This was a good tasting bread. I added 1/2 cup of cold milk with 2 cups boiling water (instead of using only water) and then added the yeast immediately because it seemed to be a perfect temperature. I definitely agree with other cooks that more salt is needed - probably double if not more and will try it that way next time. Texture is very nice.

Fun bread to make! I doubled the recipe and it worked just fine - I got six mini loaves to give as gifts and two full sized loaves. The dough is sticky to work with, but after that fifteen minute rest (which maybe was a little longer in my house 'cause the dog got loose in the backyard!), it was absolutely beautiful. A simple, delicious bread. I would highly recommend it. One note: I didn't add the extra salt as recommended by other reviewers and will next time. It's just a wee bit flat.

Really good bread! To the cook from Chicago on 11/18/02, mine definitely made two large loaves. I'm wondering if yours didn't rise properly, or maybe the yeast wasn't good . . . What I did: when it calls for 2 1/2 cups "hot" water, I used boiling water. "Lukewarm"--I cooled the mixture to 110F. Ideal bread water temperature is between 105F and 115F. Instead of "sprinkling" the yeast over the cooled mixture, I stirred my yeast into the mixture. Thanks to other reviewers, I added 3/4 teaspoon of kosher salt and it was perfect! Thanks everyone! I used the "breads" button on my oven and the loaves cooked perfectly in 35 minutes. Will definitely make this again and again.

I really like this fast bread recipe. only one rise makes it so quick. nice flavour and texture. definitely will make it again. I would add a bit more salt next time to balance the sugar but otherwise the recipe can be followed the the letter. great for beginner breadmakers.

Excellent bread - good texture for both toast and sandwiches. Nice flavor, too. With really only one rising, preparation is not especially time consuming.

I thought this was a great recipe...it was very easy to make and tasty as well. For a finishing touch, just before baking, I added a few pats of butter and some raw oats. Next time, I might try making adding another 1/2 of the recipe...I want to use the bread for sandwiches and it didn't rise quite as much as I had hoped. Regardless, very good!

This was a very easy recipe to make and one that could easily be made on a regular basis. I am going to try adding milk instead of water to make it a little richer, possibly more salt, but it did make two very nice loaves of bread with my 9 yr. old daughter's help.

I thought this recipe looked too easy to be good, but I was wrong! It tastes delicious & has a yummy texture - my whole family loves it. And it's so easy to make, I've been making it and giving away loaves to friends (who think I've worked really hard). I agree that it needs a bit more salt. Other than that, it's a keeper for sure!

This bread was delicious and my husband raved about it with every bite. I followed a suggestion made by one of my baker friends-- I sprayed the walls of the preheated oven with fresh water just before closing the door to the oven. This made the crust really crisp & pleasing. I do agree with one of the other reviewers who said it could use a tiny bit more salt. Great bread.

I was a little apprehensive about making a bread with only one rising. The loaves looked beautiful when I put them in the oven, but when they came out they had caved in a bit in the middle. Not sure what caused that, but the taste and texture were wonderful - very light and fluffy.
