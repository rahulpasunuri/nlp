Terrific main dish. Rave reviews from squash-hating family! Omitted the cream (plenty creamy without), garnished with a little crumbled bacon and Italian parsley.

This is one of our favorite risotto recipes. Served last night to accompany a turf and turf dinner, and everyone raved about it!

Very good, everybody loved it! I didn't use the cream and didn't have leeks so I used shallots instead. I also used some fresh Romano cheese with the parmesan.

I utilized this recipe and a magazine article one I posted on my fridge. Did not use leeks - just a white onion. No cream but used mushrooms and wine. Hard to find a squash under 2 lbs so used the 5-6 cups of broth, 2 cups risotto or just under. 1/2 c parmesan as in the recipe. I've made other risotto and don't believe I used cream - the risotto creates cream so no need to add more calories - IMO. Delicious. And my dog loves raw butternut squash!

Oh.My.God. This was so delicious! Yes, it is time consuming to make risotto, but what fabulous results! The only substitutions I made were to reduce the amount of leeks by 1/2 and add an equal amount of shiitakes, and to replace the sage with thyme from my herb garden. We served it with the "Crisp Roast Duck", which was a perfect pairing.

Most of my family really enjoyed it (my son doesn't like sweet food, he says). I'd make it again. I had some goose stock in the freezer, but I'm not sure how much it matters. I could have used some veggie stock, too. The big difference, I guess, is that I used Kabocha instead of Butternut. Kabocho is a much sweeter squash. I sliced it thinly so it would cook faster. I have no idea how much stock went into the rice. I just cooked until it was the right texture. Seems like if you do that, you won't get something too hard or too mushy for you. I'm a cream guy, so I used cream at the end. I also didn't measure the parmesan. Just grated until I was tired of it. It was kind of funny how I got here. I had the squash and the leeks and I wanted to use white wine and cream. I googled squash and leeks and this recipe showed up. Perfect!

This risotto was good, but I don't think I will make it again. It just didn't "wow" me.

Given the rave reviews, I was expecting this to be a lot better. It was ok. I followed the recipe to the t, and honestly am not getting the hoopla. It was good, I will give it that. But it was definitely not worth all the work. I'd rather have eaten the squash baked with brown sugar and butter.

A great winter meal! I made it omitting the cream and subbing 2T butter as per other reviews. Also added 4oz of diced pancetta--highly recommended. The salty of the pancetta played nicely against the sweet of the squash. I think it would have been too sweet without it. Will definitely be making this again!

Very tasty! Butternut squash and feta cheese were made for each other....so I sprinkled a little feta on top of my serving and it was the bomb! Save yourself the calories and fat and skip the cream and butter that has been suggested. It's not needed at all.

Every year I make this dish for my husband around the fall. He loves it and says its now a tradition for the start of his hunting season. Delicious comfort food!

Rating: 4
I made this exactly to the recipe with the exception of reducing the amount of cream (used lite cream instead of whipping). The flavors blended beautifully -absolutely loved it. It would be amazing with a pork roast as the butternut squash made it a sweater risotto. Will definitely make it again and highly recommend it.

I too left out the cream, and added some reconstituted porcini mushrooms, fresh sage, thyme, and oregano from the garden. I only made half the recipe, but had 3 med. leeks, so it was perhaps a little "leek-happy", but really good flavor. Oh, also sprinkled some truffle salt on it before serving. Can't wait to try the leftovers- they'll probably be even better.

Rating: 4
Wow, this was amazing. (confession: I did not add the whipping cream, and instead added 2 Tbsp. butter at the end, per another reviewer's suggestion. great tip, thanks!)

We added sauteed rapini and ~1T Aleppo pepper from Penzey's (http://www.penzeys.com/cgi-bin/penzeys/p-penzeysaleppopepper.html). The wines we paired with this risotto were a 2006 Sonoma-Cutrer Sonoma Coast Chardonnay and a 2000 Arnaldo-Caprai Sagrantino di Montefalco. The former pairing was a great blend of flavors - together better than either alone. The latter pairing was OK by simply not being in conflict; the wine "stepped" on the food, but not in a bad way. One flavor simply overwrote the other.

Rating: 4
Loved it. I roasted about 8 cloves of garlic with the squash and stirred it all in together at the end - fabulous. Also added to sage with what was in my early spring herb garden - some oregano, thyme - very yummy.

Very good. I skipped the cream and the cheese and just added a couple tablespoons of butter. My friend suggested serving with a lemon wedge next time.

Rating: 3
This really tasted great--to me and my teen boyz. I also subbed butter for cream and shallots for leeks. I think, tho, I may have cooked it too fast or using too high of heat because it was a bit more crunchy than al dente. Will slow down next time, because will definitely make again!

I halfed the recipe; substituted a shallot for the leeks, cooked it in the microwave (yes, you can make a really good risotto in the microwave) and minimized the amount of cream to a tablespoon. Very good, almost too good: comfort food extraordinaire.

Great recipe, but the cream isn't really necessary.

I made this and served it as a side with smoked duck breast. It was delicious. I liked that I was able to roast the butternut squash early when I had the time. I like the idea of adding some mushrooms to it next time.

Oh, this recipe has caused problems! Followed the suggestion of VA and made with mushrooms & served with leftover cranberry sauce...now we're in an endless cycle - ran out of cranberry leftovers but still had risotto, made more sauce, ran out of risotto, made more to go with the sayce...it's so delicious! Of course the texture gets gunky, as with all risotto, but the leftovers still taste great!

A definite keeper. Time consuming but wonderful flavorful. I used a dry champagne instead of dry wine just because that is what i had.

I´ve made a variety of Butternut Squash Risotto´s in the last couple years and have found this to be one of my favorites. I substituted veg. stock for the chicken, a splash more of the white wine, and some extra sage. On two different occasions I´ve used this dish both as an app and a main dish, and have had nothing but satisfied guest.

Very good. Took suggestion to drop cream and use butter instead and it was fine. Also went a bit light on the sage and the flavor was just right.

Rating: 4
We've got various problems with leeks in the household, so I substituted 8 oz of those pre-sliced mushrooms and about 4 oz of more interesting mushrooms that I sliced myself. Sauteed those with a shallot in place of the leeks. Also didn't add cream, but just 3 Tbs of butter did the trick - it was almost unnecessary. This went really great with the Thanksgiving leftovers, ESPECIALLY the cranberry sauce. YUM, it added a little tart note that really elevates from good to awesome.

Rating: 4
delicious! I didn't have any sage and sprinkled in some parsley at the end mostly for color. Otherwise followed the recipe as is. Took a bit more liquid than suggested. Creamy, tasty, flavorful, and great colors too - for those who eat with their eyes too like me! Definitively a keeper

I made this last night and served with smoked sausage (my husband doesn't think a meal is a meal without some meat!), and my husband loved it. It was okay for me- but he loved the taste and said it was a perfect winter meal. I replaced the whipping cream with 1 stick of butter, and the grocery store didn't have fresh sage, so I had to use dried. I think it would've been better with fresh.

Rating: 4
We all loved this. I doubled the cheese, added 1/2 more wine (1/2 less stock), and wish I had more squash than called for, but otherwise kept everything the same. Will definitely remake this many times.

We thinned our leeks last week and I was looking to make something delicious with them- this did the trick! Even the two people who "hate risotto" ate every last bite! The squash brought some great sweetness to the dish, and we went light on the sage (also fresh from the garden) and it was just right!

I added 1/2 cup toasted chopped hazelnuts. I've made it twice. Once for my husband and myself. Another time for 9 friends. I tripled the recipe, did not need all of the stock. Got rave reviews both times.

Disappointing. After reading other reviews, I thought this would be a winner. Wrong! It was so-so. The fresh sage was overpowering and the leeks were stringy. I'm actually deleting this one from my recipe box. Will not make again. Having to throw away some leftovers because they aren't getting eaten...

Rating: 3
i made this recipe a bit reluctantly because cream is a real nono in risotto. the results were good although adding butter at the end instead of the cream produces a more luxurious dish. i made my own squash stock by frying the innards of the squash in a little butter then I added chicken stock and simmered it for 30 mins. the extra effort is well worth it. i can't wait to try it again. i was thinking of serving it with roasted maple salmon, would anybody have any other suggestions?

hi,thks Houston for your comment on the risotto, making it ahead. I actually did make the base in the afternoon, let it sit until cool on a pan, then put into a airtight container until serving time. At that time I brought the other half of the broth to the boil, and completed the recipe adding the parm and the squash at the very end. (These instructions were in Jaime Oliver's cookbook)...so it worked beautiful, and certainly allowed me more time to visit with our guests!

I came back to the website to find this recipe after making it back in 2002 and remembering HOW DELICIOUS this is. Yes, a bit laborious, but worth it. To the person with the question about reheating...well, yes, but there's a certain intensity in the flavors that gets lost when reheated. Would recommend against it.

I would really love to make this next weekend...anybody any advice on making it earlier and reheating risotto?

Made this last night. Followed the recipe exactly, although a fellow epi-chatter suggested the use of stock over broth which I will try next time. But this recipe is to die for, so rich and yummy, the butternut was perfect. I chose to roast until tender as the recipe stated. I served as part of a main dish with seared scallops...next time I won't bother with anything else but the risotto, it was enough of a meal on its own.

Delicious! I've made this twice. First time I followed the recipe to the "T". Second time, I skipped the cream all together, added 1/2 the parmesan and sprinkled 1 tablespoon of fresh grated parmesan on top when I served it. I'll happily make this again!

Flavorful and simple to make, although risotto is always somewhat time consuming. We really enjoyed it. I threw in some cooked, diced chicken at the end and that was nice, but the recipe can certainly stand on its own without the chicken.

Used turkey broth leftover from Thanksgiving and added 2 slices chopped bacon in with the leeks. It was delicious as a main course with steamed veggies.

Followed this recipe to the letter. Came out exceptionally. Easy to double and then save leftovers (which reheat well). Paired this side with "Brown Sugar and Bourbon Ribs". have executed this recipe often and time seems to vary for squash roasting so keep on an eye on the time and check after 25 minutes to ensure squash does not get mushy.

Fantastic fall comfort food! Saved a little work by roasting halved squash (cut size down) at 375 degrees x 50 minutes, cooled, then peeled and chopped. Can decrease stock and time if you cover pan between stirrings.

I made this for a casual dinner party and got raves. I did add shitake mushrooms that were sauted in olive oil and some shallot to the leeks. I also added some butter along with the cream at the end. Next time I would add either toasted pine nuts or hazelnuts to garnish.

Made this last night and thought it was delicious. I added half-fat creme fraiche at the end, but agree with the reviewers who say you could add butter instead. And by the way, if you make this with brown rice, it's not a risotto!

Would give 3.5 stars if possible. I used brown rice and it took almost TWO HOURS of semi hands-on work (stirring, etc). However, it turned out yummy and more nutritious than white rice, so if youre up for it, go ahead & use brown! Cover pan and let it simmer on low for a while, stirring often. I added more sage and some toasted pecan pieces.

SO GOOD. I love butternut squash and I am new to risotto. This dish is so good. I made it last night for dinner and I ate some for breakfast and lunch today. Really a great dish.

Wow. I made this last night and it was amazing. I work in the food industry and eat great food every day, and this. blew. me. away. I did end up using 8 cups stock, instead of 6, and like everyone else, i didn't leave the stove. I poured myself a glass of wine, parked myself in front of the pan with a wooden spoon and just stirred for 30 minutes. Well worth it. Excellent. I served it with a green salad with roasted cherry tomatoes and artichoke hearts.

I first made this dish for a group of friends several years ago, on a cool fall evening, and have been making it twice to three times a year since (whenever I see nice butternut squash at market). What a great dish. I usually make an extra amount because guests always ask for seconds (or to take some home). Although not necessary, I increase the amount of leeks and add the additional cooked leeks halfway through cooking for more texture. As with all risottos, keep adding broth and keep stirring.

I made this as a first course meal on New Year's eve, (before surf and turf)and it came out a bit mushy. I think that I added too much broth, so I will follow the recipe directions more closely next time. I added some pancetta to make it more smoky although it is a vegetarian dish, and it was very flavorful. My suggestion is to put some more grated cheese on top and then bake it to melt the cheese before serving. Actually tasted better the second day.

Creamy and delicious. I couldn't oven roast squash due to shortage of oven space, but pan roasting worked very well.

I make risotto frequently and this recipe is definitely a keeper. I added 2 tbsp. butter at the end, and used enhanced quantities of parmesan and sage. Make sure that you use only quality regianno parmesan. I also saved about 1 cup of the cooked squash to top the bowl for presentation sake. Try this one.

This is a nice, hearty cold weather main course. I serve it with a simple green salad. I also throw in some chopped prosciutto or pancetta if I have it around. I don't bother roasting the squash (although I'm sure it adds a nice depth) because it sometimes gets discolored and too carmelized. I cut it to small cubes and sautee it with the leeks then add the rice, broth, etc. It will cook in the same amount of time as the risotto with less hassle. I also nix the cream but add more cheese. Still very rich.

I served this risotto with a magret de canard in a blackberry sauce. It received rave reviews from my guests. An attractive addition to this risotto is the addition of some wild rice. It adds great color and goes well with duck.

This dish was easy to put together. Risotto always makes you stay in the kitchen because of the sirring, but it is so satisfying and hearty that it is worth it. This recipe is a great one for using up seasonal squash from my farm share. My family loved it.

My husband RAVES about this risotto; it's his favorite. I used butterCUP squash, and added about a tablespoon of fresh ginger after the rice. I also use 2% milk (or whole, if I have it) in place of the cream, and it's just fine (I have never tried the cream, but suspect it would simply add to calories without adding enjoyment.) I left out the fresh sage; I have never been a big fan. Delish!

Rating: 4
I have adapted this over time and in my opinion, adding some garlic and fresh grated root ginger at the addition of the rice makes a world of difference. I often omit the cream and just put a spoon of butter in at the end instead. My favourite winter dish I think!

Rating: 2
I was looking forward to this recipe but ultimately was unhappy with it. The sweetness of the squash, the creaminess of the cream, and the somewhat mushy consistency of everything (cream, squash, cheese) made it just way too rich for my taste. It's certainly too rich to be a main course, and if I were to ever serve it again, I would serve very small portions as a side dish only, making sure there were other firmer foods to balance things out. If I dared to try this recipe again, I would do a few things differently: 1) I would use Arborio rice (instead of medium grain) and decrease the liquid slightly. 2) I would omit the cream entirely. 3) I would consider roasting the squash for less time, leaving it with a litle bite for texture.

This was so unexpectedly delicious! I, too, substituted cream for 1% milk - and it was fabulous. My husband who is a notorious food snob declared it "restaurant quality" and asked for seconds. I am going to make this a staple.

I thought this was lovely but my boyfriend (who actually made it) found it too sweet. We're going to try it again, this time with less squash (or maybe even - don't tell - a can of pumpkin) and use lots more cheese, possibly romano this time.

Excellent dish ... the butternut squash provides nice color and a sweet flavor. I, too, left out the cream and still found the dish wonderful. I had a chicken breast in the fridge that I needed to use, so I cooked it in olive oil, sliced it and added it to the risotto. Made the dish a nice filling entree. I've been to the Bread and Ink cafe in Portland and would recommend it highly.

I've made this with and without cream - less rich and just as flavorful w/out. Adding shallots gives this dish more flavor. The sage and butternut squash are nicely paired. I crumbled some leftover chorizo sausage on top. Yum!
