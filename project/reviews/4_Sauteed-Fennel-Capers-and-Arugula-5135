It was used as a main dish over quinoa and it was very quick and easy to make. The many flavors played very well together. Overall, very delicious, and definitely not "bitter".

Hi Pittsburgh, If you haven't tried this already, try boiling the fennel for 10 mins or so to tenderize the veg before you sautee it. If you try this and give it another try, I bet you like it much more.

I have to admit I was disappointed by this dish; I've tried the recipe twice and won't bother again. Despite my fondness for fennel, capers, arugula, and olives, I found the result bitter and texturally disappointing. (But it was colorful.) Sadly, after eating half a serving, I had to toss the rest of it. I'm sure some of this depends on the quality of the ingredients, so I encourage anyone else who ventures to try it to use baby arugula and the freshest fennel and leeks. (I don't know how to control for bitterness in either of those vegetables.) I would also recommend increasing the olives by at least 50%, and possibly the capers as well.

This side dish complements the poached mahimahi and shrimp perfectly. We agreed that it would do the same for grilled or poached salmon, and certainly for any mild fish, whether poached, grilled or sauteed. This is a real winner made in accordance with the recipe.

Surprising flavors that fit fantastically together.

This is one of my all time favorite side dishes. I serve it with filets and a potato side and it is perfect. It's hard to imagine how well the flavors go together if you haven't tried it.

This is great with the associated wine-poached mahimahi and shrimp but I'll make it as its own side dish. The mix of flavors and textures is great. It's got a variety of colors and looks good on a plate.
