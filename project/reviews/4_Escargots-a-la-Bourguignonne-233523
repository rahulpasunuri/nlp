Absolutely the best recipe ever and so easy. I do add more garlic, then it calls for, but I am a garlic lover. Highly recommend!

So simple, but so good. I increased the garlic to two cloves and used brandy instead of white wine. End result was delicious. Makes an impressive appetizer.

I used 3 garlic cloves, and gave a quick finish under the broiler, just until it bubbles; otherwise the garlic & shallots are a bit undercooked. After that... tasted like Paris.

My kids loved it, and I alo found a new use for the leftover butter.. put it on bread and toast it and voila! you have great tasting garlic bread! Oh, and I didn't have kosher salt to stabilise it, and substituted it with rice, which works just as well!

It was okay. Needed much more garlic.

My husband and I loved this - didn't have snail shells so I put them in mushroom caps and baked them ten minutes. I might try prebaking the mushrooms for about 5 minutes next time to get some of their liquid out first. Butter mixture was great on bread also

Can you replace the snails with scallops?

This was a delicious dish and easy to make. Wonderful for garlic lovers and the garlic is not overpowering.I will make it again! I may add some fresh thyme; that would add a nice flavor. This is a great recipe as is, but you could play around with fresh herbs and maybe use sherry or cognac, instead of the white wine, and still have a great dish. Placing them on a bed of grey sea salt is also a nice presentation.

Is this any different from the common escargot appetizer in steak houses?
