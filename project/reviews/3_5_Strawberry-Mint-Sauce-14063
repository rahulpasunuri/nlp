I made this over Aunt Rose's Pound cake and added about 2 T of light Bacardi Rum into it.... it added a nice kick. I threw some fresh strawberries on top, and decorated the plate with some basic Hershey's Chocolate Syrup... it was delicious!

Served as a plated dessert after a Thai buffet dinner. Everyone loved the texture of the mousse and commented particularly the strawberry/mint combination of the sauce. 3 out of six asked for the recipe.
