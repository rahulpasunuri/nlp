A tradition for New Year's Day in my home - three years running. My family adores this. I double the eggs and cheese, triple the garlic and minimize the mushrooms. Also - I use a sweet pre-cooked apple- chicken sausage to counter the sourness and reduce grease. Serve with fresh fruit salad/yogurt and ciabatta bread or raisin couscous.

I, too, thought this would make a great brunch meal. The taste was disappointing to my family -- not enough zing. If I were to make it again I would add more eggs again, (1 additional whole egg at least for the given measurements but if using a jelly roll pan, just increase the egg part by one third), chop all the contents in the food processor, and use whatever mushrooms available, plus add more sausage & some herbs or more seasoning. On a more positive note, it did roll easier than I expected. It cools down fast so don't rest if for 10 minutes as directed.

I've made this recipe a few times because it makes a perfect brunch dish. I modify the recipe slightly to my preferences, but the recipe is good on its own. I prefer a sturdier egg base, so I add one whole egg and one egg white in order to make something more substantive to hold the filling. I also chop the entire filling mixture in a food processor because it cuts down on prep time (you don't have to chop things as finely in the prep). Also, I buy whatever mushrooms I can find because shitake mushrooms get expensive. It tastes good with any kind of mushrooms, in my opinion. I actually think that this would be better with more sausage and less mushrooms, but I haven't tried that yet. Maybe next time... One final note--parchment paper is essential. Trying to make this with a well-greased pan or with wax paper will ruin the dish when you get ready to roll. I know because I tried using wax paper the first time I made this--learn from my mistake!

Surprisingly this is not difficult. Only complaint - after letting it cool for 10 min..as per the directions, the dish was really too cold. Much better served warm (who likes cold eggs?)

This is a keeper. My family just loves this dish. I have subst. bacon and even leftover chicken for sausage and it still tasted great.

man, i didn't check off the "make it again?" part and it totally skewed that aspect of the rating system. sorry - should be 100%

yum! very very good. seems complicated but it wasn't too bad. i messed up a little b/c i didn't measure my pan and it was 2 inches longer and wider. therefore my egg layer was a bit thin and fragile (plus it stuck a little bit to the wax paper i used in place of the parchment i didn't have. overall, very flavorful and kinda cool looking.

Fantastic...my family loved it...even the one who doesn't like eggs. The 2nd time I used bacon instead of sausage and was still great.
