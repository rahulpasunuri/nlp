Wow, I forgot to add brown sugar and these were still delicious. Used dried cranberries instead of currents and used braeburn apples. Can't believe that a baked apple without any sweetener - no sugar, maple syrup, honey - could still be this good! Certainly the healthiest baked apples I've ever made. Next time I will add just a touch of sugar.

These are delicious and quite simple. A great fall/winter recipe. We didn't have currents so we used raisins instead, but this still turned out great. Highly recommended!

This was a lovely winters dessert. I used green apples (granny) instead of red but it still turned out really well. I put photos of my attempt up at www.whatkimate.co.nz Strongly recommended.

I made this with dried cranberries instead of the currants and walnuts instead of the pecans, just because I didn't have what was required on-hand. YUM. Easy and satisfying. I think another reviewer said they like this for breakfast, which I can easily see.

This is my favourite baked apples recipe. Not only do we eat it as a dessert, but also for breakfast with vanilla or plain yogurt.

This recipe is excellent. I used Gala apples as the recipe indicates, and I thought that they worked very well. I used a melon baller to scoop out the core, and I packed a lot of stuffing into each apple (I think I doubled the stuffing recipe, but I didn't quite use all of it). Everyone loved them.

Does anyone know if this would work with Fuji apples? (And what kind are usually best for baking?)

This dish is wonderful! Gala apples taste great, and do not mush. Presentation is beautiful--our guests just raved about them! Followed recipe exactly--assembled night before with no problem.

Most of this recipe was good--the apples smelled wonderful while they were baking and the stuffing tasted delicious. I was disappointed in the apples themselves though--I used Gala's and they seemed very bland. I would make it again using different apples.

I added some dried sour cherries. Otherwise I didn't change a thing. This was really delicious and I plan on making it again soon.

Instead of apple cyder, I would use Porto red wine flambeé, when being served, with chantilly cream instead of yogourt.

This is very tasty and pretty. Addition of dried cranberries with the other fruit is very nice too.

The Rome Apples work best because they hold their shape during baking. Macs, although my favorite apple, will tend to mush.

I loved it. I have made variations of this many times, but the yogurt makes a diffrence. This is one of those recipes you can pull out of things you have hanging around in the kitchen. I made this for a High Tea I did and it was the favorite.

Will keep this recipe. Why the Rome apple?? Will Macintosh do as well?

This is a quick and easy dessert that dazzles! I made a double batch and did the second one with dried sour cherries. The yogurt was a great low fat touch that made me feel less guilty about the sugar!
