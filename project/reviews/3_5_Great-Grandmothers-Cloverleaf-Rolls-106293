How long do you refrigerate the dough?

My friends and family LOVE these rolls. They are tender and slightly sweet. Just what I think dinner rolls should be. It mixes up easily, almost like a batter. I sometimes simplify a little by using Instant Yeast. Then you skip the step mixing the yeast with water. I add the water to the milk mixture (cool water, to cool down the milk), and just add the dry yeast with the flour. I also shape differently. Usually just divided into 16 balls in a 9x13 pan. It make large square rolls you just pull apart (and requires much less butter to roll in.)

I incorporated others' suggestions before trying these, i.e. I used half the sugar, kneaded the dough after taking it out of the fridge, dredged the balls in 3 T. of melted butter in a large bowl, and baked them for an additional 4-5 minutes. I thought they were good, but not great - though they were a hit at the party where I served them. Not as flaky and soft as I like, and not as yeasty. They were relatively easy for a yeast bread.

Delicious. I suggest cooking longer than 15 as mine were not totally crisp and golden as I prefer after that time period. Suggest adding in all manner of extras--fresh herbs, nuts, seeds or dried fruit would all be great addition. I kneaded after taking out of the fridge as I like my bread smoother but it seems optional. All in all a fool-proof, delicious and people-pleasing recipe.

These smelled a lot better baking than they actually tasted. They could definitely have used some kneading--they rose so fast that they ended up collapsing before they were baked, since the gluten hadn't been worked at all to hold them together.

These were very good. Kids loved them. I was trying to replicate some clover rolls that my aunt makes for Thanksgiving but hers are better. These are so easy though, I will make again.

These were so easy and so good. They were a tiny bit sweeter than I like, next time I'll cut the sugar just a bit. My husband love them!!!! I made all the little balls and tossed them all in a large bowl that had the melted butter but I only used 3T (not as much as this recipe called for) I quickly tossed the little dough balls in the butter instead of dipping each one, then I quickly popped them into muffin tins...worked great and it was a fast way to do it. These are great. I made them to go with homemade chicken noodle soup. I'll put this recipe in my box for holidays!

I thought these turned out nicely--fluffy, pretty, with a mildly sweet taste and enough butter to be satisfying but not heavy. I feel silly asking this, but are you not supposed to knead the dough? I didn't--just mixed in the flour as recommended--but it seemed as if the rolls could have a had a smoother texture. I'd appreciate any advice!

Very nice. THought the cupcake tins wouldn't work, but they were fine.

This recipe is exactly what I consider to be the ideal dinner roll, plus it was very simple to make! It's moist, tender, just barely sweet, salty, with just enough substance to know it's homemade. My leftovers were still getting raves when day old, too. I made 6 batches to serve to a large function, and I can't say how many people popped back into the kitchen to praise the cook! Doing such a large batch, I didn't think I had time to make the cloverleaf shape (nor did I have enough muffin tins) so I made full sized rolls, baking 18 rolls(recipe and a half) in a 9x13 pan. I coated the pan with butter and then buttered the dough at the start of the final raising, and repeated after baking. It only took about 2T of butter to coat the rolls (instead of 6T), and the salted butter I had on hand tasted great. The rolls stood higher than the pan and looked like the pull-apart packs from the bakery. I think a doz would still fill a 9x13 but they wouldn't pack as tight and high. I mixed mine in my KitchenAid mixer, first with a regular mixing blade and then switching to a dough hook when it sounded like it was straining a little halfway thru adding the flour. It went to the refrigerator in the same bowl. It was the easiest bread I've ever made.

These were good, but I was hoping they would be like Bridgeford frozen rolls. Not wanting to "cheat" for Thanksgiving, I made several homemade rolls such as these--NONE were as good as the Bridgeford rolls. Wish I could find a recipe like that...

Awesome. Very easy, and great right out of the oven. Perfect for our Thanksgiving dinner. Destined to become a family tradition.

This is, without a doubt, the easiest and tastiest roll recipe ever! I too cut out the 6 tablespoons melted butter. Instead, I brush the tops with butter as soon as I take them out of the oven. This recipe is very versatile--makes a great dough for sticky buns too. The ultimate compliment came from my boyfriend's sister who is a Chef--she couldn't stop eating them!

THIS IS AN AMAZING RECIPE!! It was very simple to make, and my father - A a very picky eater - could only say "how did you get these to be so delicious?" I made them for a dinner party and they vanished. I made more the next day just so I could have them with leftovers. Absolutely the best dinner rolls I have ever had.

Very yummy.....best when hot out of the oven. I replaced about a cup of the flour with whole wheat, and found that I didn't need six tablespoons of melted butter.

I searched for a quick recipe and came across this one. I put these together very quickly in the morning, and baked them before dinner. They were so easy to prepare and were DELICIOUS. I put the buttered side down and lightly brushed the tops before baking. Also, you do not need all of the melted butter called for. By the way, the only sounds at my dinner table were YUMMMMMM.
