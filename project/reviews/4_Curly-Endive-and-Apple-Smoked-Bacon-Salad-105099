we loved this dressing. fairly easy to get together. I only used 5-7 slices of thin sliced bacon - only 2 T fat needed for dressing. Seemed like 1 pound of bacon just for bits was not needed - and it wasn't missed. I added other 'salad' stuff like tomatoes & avocado. Yes, endive is a bit bitter but with this dressing, it was a nice change from the usual salad.

Lovely. I combined this recipe and another similar one - balsamic rather than white wine vinegar, adding steamed asparagus, and skipping the croutons. My company loved it.

Woah, this was amazing. If only food this delicious weren't so bad for you. *Sigh* The mustard/bacon grease/vinegar dressing was fantastic. Didn't care for the shallots in the dressing (and I halved the amt called for), they were too acrid. Used butter lettuce, red wine vinegar (all we had), and added carrots and pink lady apples (which were a perfect mix of tart and sweet and went really well with the salad). Will make this again . . . in a couple of months after our cholesterol levels have recovered.

The dressing was delicious, especially with the bacon fat. Nice and creamy. I mixed all ingredients in a jar and they emulsified nicely. Also, I added sliced pears and omitted the croutons, as well as using mixed greens instead of all curly endive, as I couldn't find any in my grocry store. A lovely, bistro style salad.

Although I was unable to find apple-smoked bacon (! sorry, ML) I did use thick-cut smoked bacon from a quality butcher. Otherwise, followed exactly. The slight bitterness of the endive is balanced by the richness of the bacon and dressing. Very much a winter salad, very delicious. A classic.
