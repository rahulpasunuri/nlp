Sorry to sound negative, but the 1 Fork is being generous. The coasting on the chicken while roasting turned out beautifully, as did the bird generally. However, the sauce was a different story. We felt it ended up tasting like oily Dijon mustard. While we love Dijon and we love the oil we used, we did not like this sauce at all. For those reading the reviews, our recommendation would be to move on to another one. Epicurious has so many wonderful recipes. We feel this is not one of them.

What a wonderful recipe. Use a smaller chicken and cut the veggies you choose to use bigger and cook in the same pan. Love it!

This smells amazing while it's roasting. I used a 4.5 pound roaster. For vegetables, I included 9 medium knob onions, 2 garnet sweet potatoes, 2 large baking potatoes, 2 parsnips, 2 turnips, 3 large carrots and 1/2 pound of button mushrooms. I omitted the sauce step; everything was delicious as it came from the oven. The volume of vegetables made it necessary to divide them between two pans, with the onions and mushrooms in one, and the remaining in the other. I also used a more oil (about 4 tbs) for tossing the veggies before I coated them with the sauce. In my convection roaster, the whole thing was done in 1 hour 25 minutes. I rotated the chicken for more even browning throughout the process and basted it with the pan juices as well. 1 lime quartered was stuffed into the cavity for a moister bird and a nice complement to the seasonings. The chicken and vegetables need salt and pepper to bring out some more flavor.

Such an easy recipe yet soo delicious! The market didn't have turnips so I used potatoes, onions, and sweet potato.. fantastic! The hubby loved it..

A tasty, tangy, and slightly unusual preparation for roast chicken. I added potatoes to the root vegetable mixture, and greatly preferred them to the turnips -- I'd leave those out next time, probably. I'd also recommend putting the vegetables in the oven to roast at the same time as the chicken... our veggies came out a little crunchy. Otherwise, delicious!

I have made this recipe several times and last time followed a few other reviewer suggestions of putting the tossing the veggies with the sauce and putting them right away in the pan with the chicken. Brushing the chicken a couple of times during the roasting brings out the flavor. I think you can cut back on the olive oil a bit and not lose either the flavor or the moistness of the chicken. You can change the veggies, I've done it with a mix of white and sweet potatoes, portobellos, carrots and onions and I think you could vary this as much as you want. This is a keeper recipe!

Of all the chicken preparations this is my family's favorite. I use a full jar of mustard but only half as much olive oil and rub the sauce under the skin of cut up chicken pieces. The veggies go in an oven-proof skillet so they can be shaken around, and it is also easier to add in veggies in case some require less cooking time. This recipe never fails me.

This was good, but I love roast chicken and that is probably the only reason I enjoyed it. I found the mustard overwhelming and also found myself wishing for parnips instead of turnips in the veggie mix. Out of the recipe box it goes.

This unassuming recipe turned out to be the best chicken I have ever roasted! Not sure if it's the recipe or m brand new oven but it's AMAZING. I accidentally stirred the remaining mustard mixture over the veggies, not in the sauce. But it was delicious anyway.

This was good, but not great. The roasted veggies were tasty, but I added potatoes like other reviewers suggested and I think that really made the veggie mix much better than it would have been without it. I also stuffed the chicken cavity with an onion, and that kept it moist. The sauce was too thin and honestly, a bit bland. I think this needs modification before making again, such as the addition of salt, pepper, garlic, and perhaps lemon zest?

The chicken was much smaller than specified but still wasn't quite done, and the vegetables were way overdone. The sauce was nothing to write home about. Would never make this again/

This was excellent -- delicious sauce; tasty, tender chicken; wonderful vegetables. I put a whole onion, parsley sprigs in the cavity; rubbed the chicken with a cut lemon half, which I also put in the cavity. My chicken was 6.81 pounds, and it still took 15 minutes longer than the prescribed time. I added flour to the drippings before making the sauce, for a delicious gravy. I cooked the gizzard and neck in the broth to fortify it, and added the chopped giblets to the gravy. This size chicken, and the vegetables, made quite a lot of food; no way would it all fit on the same platter. Served with mashed potatoes.

Rating: 4
Like the other reviewers, I found this dish easy and delicious. I too appreciated that you just put the sauce on, and don't have to fool with putting anything under the skin. I used fresh rosemary (big difference), and reserved a whole sprig for inside the chicken. I also found the Perdue over roaster to be excellent. My only dissasatisfaction was the vegetables. They ended up tasting fine, but they looked dry and pale and unappetizing. How do people get that golden roasted look?

Rating: 4
Bon Appetit is right! This dish is magnifique in it's depth of flavor and simplicity. I added parsnips, cut in to 1.5" chunks, doubled the onions and rosemary. We enjoyed it last night for dinner with some green beans and now I am throwing all the leftovers in to a pot with some low sodium chix stock to make soup. Excellent! This is going on my heavy rotation recipe list. Bon Appetit!

I make this recipe all the time, as it is absolutely delicious and so easy! Sometimes if I don't feel up to roasting and carving a whole chicken, I use pieces, set on a rack over a foil-lined half-sheet pan. I don't always make the gravy, either. I've found that doubling the sauce is practically a must, and I use more than a tablespoon for the veggies (which vary, depending on what I have on hand... usually red potatoes, yams, parsnips, red onions and carrots). If you roast pieces, rather than a whole chicken, start the chicken and veggies at the same time, and cook for about an hour. This makes the house smell divine!!!

I rarely give 4 forks, but this recipe deserves them for great taste and ease of preparation. The chicken was so moist and flavorful and the vegetables were so tasty -- I added sweet potatoes and golden beets. Didn't bother with the sauce -- just wasn't needed. I'll be making this again soon!

Very yummy. I used little fingerling potatoes, parsnips, a sweet potato and a couple of beets. I started the veggies first at 425°, and then 20 minutes later added the chicken to the same dish (I used split breasts since it's just 2 of us). The mustard isn't overpowering at all--I didn't even tell my husband it was in the recipe until after he tried it and like it because he's a mustard hater. The rosemary is absolutely wonderful with the veggies. Very easy dinner.

This was perfect - next time I will not make the reduction sauce, since neither the meat nor the vegetables needed it. I served it with potato/yam gratin and it was a great hit.

This is one of the best roast chicken recipes I've tried. The chicken stays moist with the addition of a couple slivers of lemon/lime, and I also added a couple garlic cloves. Even better if you double the mustard/oil combo and add a bit extra to the chicken and veggies (we rubbed it under the chicken's skin as suggested by several posters). I also added it to fingerling potatoes. I'll probably use the mustard sauce often, even without the chicken.

Rating: 2
Took other's advice and made extra mustard/rosemary sauce and rubbed it under chicken's skin. I used beets,carrots and sweet potatoes as the vegetables. The veg turned out yummy and the chicken was very moist, but I didn't think the flavor from the mustard sauce came through much. I like other chicken preps better.

This was a fabulous recipe. It was easy and very tasty. I added 3 cloves garlic to the cavity of the chicken, before roasting, to add flavor and fragrance. The chicken turned out moist and succulent. I found the gravy to be delish, yet at the end a bit thin for my preferrence, so I added a small amount of beurre manie, whisked and brought it to a boil for a few minutes to thicken it up. The gravy compliments the chicken and the mashed potatoes I made, as recommended in the recipe. The veggies also were delish. This is a great recipe that I highly recommend and is now in my keeper file!

Fantastic recipe! I made this for my boyfriend and some friends and everyone loved it. I also double the dijon sauce, rubbed under the skin and over it. Chicken had a great flavor and was so tender. I also took the advice from another reviewer and put a lemon wedge inside the chicken. I used sweet potatoes, carrots, and sweet white onions with only a very small amount of the dijon mix. Like some of the other reviewers said, the veggies were great with olive oil, salt, pepper and rosemary. Easy and VERY yummy!

My father-in-law, inevitable hates everything I cook (he claims I'm "too gourmet"), but he absolutely loves this dish. The recipe is so simple, but yet it appears so elegant on the table. I use baby carrots, white onion instead of red and baby portobello mushrooms. The leftover chicken, if you have any, makes great chicken salad. I have made this several times and actually am in the kitchen working on it again.

This is a wonderful recipe. I made it yesterday and my husband and kids LOVED it. I made 1 1/2 the amount of mustard/olive oil/rosemary mixture. Kosher salted and peppered the outside and cavity of the chicken b4 I applied the mixture. Applied the mixture to the cavity as well. Also halved a lemon and sqeezed into the cavity and added the lemon to the cavity while the chicken roasted (a reviewer said this would help keep it most and it worked!!!). Also added sliced baby portobello mushrooms to the last 5 minutes of roasting time for the chicken....My 10 year old son was picking at the chicken well after dinner was finished...and my 7 year old son couldn't eat enough of the vegetables (and he tells me he doesn't like carrots or mushrooms). Definitely a keeper!!!

Rating: 4
Absolutely fantastic, especially considering how simple this dish is and how little time you actually spend in the kitchen. I used a smooth Dijon (from Dijon, purchased by an aunt who visited) that was blended with honey and balsamic vinegar, sweet white onion instead of red, regular carrots cut into large bite-sized chunks, and no turnip. Try stuffing the cavity (of all roasted chickens!) with cut-up citrus fruits (I used halved limes), it adds a bit of flavour and a LOT of moistness to the meat. The chicken was to tender it was falling off the bones.

One word of caution if you take the suggestion of doubling the mustard part of the sauce. While this is good for putting it under the chicken skin (does not run away so much) it made for a not too sightly coating for the outside of the chicken. I made vegetables with and without the mustard sauce (the increased mustard version I have to admit) on them and much prefer those with just olive oil,salt and pepper and rosemary. The very flavorful gravy can be put over the veg on serving anyway and the mustard mixture as I made it just gummed onto the veg and did not look good. I would be interested in the experience of those who increased the mustard.

Very good. Made it with Boetje's mustard(locally made near Quad Cities, Iowa)chicken breasts and kohlrabi(instead of turnips), leftover from last years garden, we ate the last of the turnips last week.

I didnt follow the recipe exactly but took the 'idea' and took some suggestions from other cooks - what a great and easy dinner - it got rave reviews! Here is what I did - I whisked the broth, mustard, rosemary, oil and 1.5 cups of white wine. I poured all of that over a large bowl full of cut veggies - mushrooms, red onions, red potatoes (quartered), and celery. I mixed it all together and poured over the chicken to cook - brushing the chicken with the juices occassionally during the time - it turned out great and seemed even easier than the original recipe!

This is a great chicken recipe - the flavor is fantastic, and the chicken came out really tender and juicy.

The dijon and rosemary add an incredible flavour to the vegetables and caramelize the onions so well. Everyone loves this dish and the chicken is always so juicy.

Whoa! I was ho-hum when browsing thru this recipe. I made it tonight because I had all the ingredients on hand and everyone on this site seemed to like it (even though I had combined mustard and chicken before with less than AMAZING results). Honestly, it was the best roasted chicken I've ever made. White meat was so juicy! Veggies came out a little dry, might add a bit of broth and cook in a smaller pan (not baking sheet) next time.

I made a few adjustments for what I had on hand, regular dijon mustard for the whole grain, yellow onions for red and red bliss potatoes for turnips, and I sprinkled the vegetable mix with salt, pepper and granulated garlic after mixing with the tablespoon of reserved sauce. As it all roasted, my house smelled absolutely wonderful! Apparently the my neighbor thought the same, because she had to come over to ask what I was making! It was fairly quiet around the dinner table except for the compliments because they were all too busy eating to talk!

A great variation on the normal roast chicken. A word of warning - I didn't have salt reduced chicken broth on hand and as a result, my sauce was very salty. Next time I will reduce the amount of oil and won't put the veggies in until half way as they seem to pass their prime before the chicken was ready. A good recipe for beginners.

Wonderful recipe - boyfriend said quite possibly the best chicken he's ever had. I used turnips, parsnips, celery & carrots for the veggies and put them right in the roasting pan. I then roasted the chicken on top of the veggies. The veggies gave a great flavor to the liquid in the bottom of the pan, which I used to make a thickened gravy, instead of the reduction the recipe recommends.

This was so good! I didn't want to roast a whole chicken, so I broiled 4 chicken breasts (about 1.65 lbs of chicken). I saw that someone else used thyme instead of rosemary, and so I did that too and it turn out great. This is a great meal.

This is why I LOVE epicurious. I have a great roasted chicken with rosemary recipe so I took one suggestion from a review and used tarragon. I used the ratio of 2:1 mustard to oil from another reviewer. Finally I pushed the mustard mixture under the skin a la a third reviewer. Substituted potato for turnips. Only drizzled veggies with little olive oil and sea salt since the sauce sounded so good. FABULOUS chicken. The leftovers will make a great french inspired chicken salad.

I have made this recipe many times and I get great raves everytime I make it. The only thing I would suggest is to keep the skin of the chicken on and put the mustard underneath the skin by running your fingers under the skin but above the breast. I found that this way the chicken stays moist and the flavor can go into the meat for those who don't like to eat the skin. For veggies, I used carrots, potatoes, onion and celery. I also put them in about an hour after I put the chicken in to keep the texture from getting too mushy. After I made this a couple of times, I experimented and put white wine in the bottom of the pan and it adds another layer of interest which is nice.

This is the easiest and most impressive chicken I've ever made.Like the cook from Palastine, doubled the sauce. First time I was out of Rosemary so I used Taragon, which worked well. After it was cooked I added some extra broth and flour to make extra terragon gravy. Definite repeat!

Incredible! I used chicken breasts, too, but cooked them separately as I was concerned about the veggies soaking up the grease from the skin. I used beets, parsnips, turnips, potatoes and shallots. (I've never cooked parsnips and turnips and wanted to try them). The beets, of course, leant a nice color to the rest of the veggies, but I got over that once I tasted it. Fabulous! For leftovers, I sliced the breast up real nice and poured the sauce over the chicken and the veggies. The chicken kept its flavor and tenderness. I have decided that rosemary is my winter herb and basil is my summer herb. I will be making this again soon.

Made this tonight. The mustard sauce is AWESOME! I substituted parsnips for the turnips and marinated the veggies a while before placing them around a defrosted, undressed 7-3/4 lb. "Family Feast" hen. Used 1/2 cup mustard, 1/4 cup oil, and 1-1/2 Tbs. of dried rosemary leaves for the marinate/brushing mixture. After 2 hours in the oven the veggies were tender and the hand held thermometer registered the chicken at 190 degrees F., but the chicken was tough, and one could not break the thigh off from the body of the bird. Had to bake the bird another 1+ hrs. to get it done, while keeping the veggies warm in the microwave. Eventually, about 2 hours later than anticipated, dinner was served, and it was a delicious meal (including the chicken). Served this with MASHED POTATOES WITH GREEN ONIONS AND PARMESAN (from this site) that I had made last night, refrigerated, and nuked at the last minute tonight. (The moral of the story: read the label on the bird you are making, even if you are an experienced cook and have made many birds in the past!!! When all went wrong tonite I pulled the label for the chicken out of the trash and found that they recommend 350 degrees, covered, for 3 to 3-1/2 hours!!! This bird apparently was not fed hormones to grow fast or injected to be tender, so it took much longer than the Epicurious recipe would lead one to believe!) Next time I would use potatoes or turnips instead of the parsnips, as I felt the veggies were too sweet.

Fabulous! Made a few changes-- used chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken, and cooked it all together--put onions, carrots and potatoes in the bottom of the dish, added chicken breasts on top, then put sauce over all. After that, I pour about a cup of white wine over it all, and the chicken comes out moist, delicious, and your sauce is already made!

Excellent and easy dish, way better than an "ordinary" roast chicken. We used about a 6 lb chicken but, kept all the other measurements the same. That was a good idea. The more sauce the better. Vegetables on the side were terrific. Good left overs. Will make it again. Highly recommended.

This was absolutely excellent. I didn't have time to do the veggies separately, so I arranged them around the chicken (and 2 slices of onion under it) and then brushed the sauce on it too.

I look forward to making this many more times!

In altering a few things, I think I have found a family favorite. First, no child eats turnips--for that matter neither does my husband! Replaced with potatoes and instead of baking them separately I added them to bake with chicken and coated them in the mixture and then added them, making sure the left over oil and mustard didnot grease it up too much. Lastly, I added whipping cream and cornstarch to thicken up the remaining juices that would simmer out of the chicken and the potatoes. Perfect!

My kids and I liked this recipe, but my husband, who is not picky, didn't care for it. I used parsnips instead of turnips and roasted the veggies with the chicken. The amount of olive oil seemed excessive, even though I skimmed the juices. The extra virgin oil had too strong of a flavor for the subtleness of chicken. I would make it again with half the olive oil and allow the juice to settle alittle more before skimming the oil.

Great dish, very flavorful! To make it healthier, I used chicken breasts only and cut the oil down to 2 T. Peeled the skins up and placed the mustard mixture between the skins and the meat. For the gravy I sauted 2 T. shallots, added 1/2 C. chardonnay, and one can of low-sodium chicken broth plus reserved mustard mixture. Reduced to 3/4 C. Used 1/2 C. broth to deglaze the roasting pan and added juices to gravy. Thickened with cornstarch.

This was a great recipe. The husband loved it! I rarely rate a recipe a "4" forker, but this one, for a combination of ease, price and presentation, I bestore the "4" forks. I am not a turnip fan, so I used a yam and a yukon gold potato, as well as the carrot and one yellow onion (I was out of purple). I put the veggies in a ziplock bag, added the mustard mixture and then added more olive oil (shake well). I also used Pam spray on the cookie sheet. For the gravy, I added two-three dashes of flour and a splash of white wine. It was fabulous! Great Sunday dinner. There are just two of us, but if I were making for more, I would double the mustard mixture part recipe.

Delicious, but I found that the recipe instructions were a bit vague. (I have never before attempted to roast a chicken!). I referred to my Joy of Cooking book a lot. Also-- to echo many of the other posters here-- it really is best to double the mustard sauce. I one-and-a-halved it because I used a 4.5 lb chicken, and I found that I just had enough for the chicken + vegetables + "au jus".

This is a great chicken recipe; easy, cheap, especially for a middle-of-the-week dinner. I used a regular Foster Farm's chicken (only 4 pounds), and halved the vegetables. This was my first attempt at turnips, and from now on I am definitely a turnip fan! I would recommend doubling the mustard sauce if you will be using the larger chicken and the called-for veggies. I found the sauce barely covered a half of the intended. Plus, the vegetables needed more olive oil during the baking, and needed to be liberally misted to achieve that desired-for browned look.

I used a Perdue Roasting chicken, which was very moist and tasty -- it even included a thermometer that pop-up when it was done!!! If you are a beginner like I am, make sure you have a wire rack inside your pan so the fat can drip into it.

I roast chicken often and this recipe ranks as one of the best yet. We really enjoyed this dinner and will definately use this recipe again.

Great flavors!! Also made the pumpkin soup. Easy, excellent and very company worthy. Don't change a thing.

This dish was absolutely delicious. I wasn't able to use fresh rosemary, and substituted dried, and it was still excellent. I am looking forward to making it again using fresh. My mother-in-law claims this is one of the best dishes she has ever eaten.

FABULOUS!!! This is about the best roast chicken I've ever had, and it's incredibly easy - once you put the rub on, that's it, just let it cook! It came out moist and tender, and the rub and the sauce made for a succulent flavor. The vegetables were a hit with my guests as well and I wouldn't change a thing with this recipe. This will become a new classic in my recipe collection!

An excellent dish. The chicken was cooked perfectly, the sauce was heavenly, and the vegetables were tender and tasty. I finished the sauce with a few pats of butter to enrich it, but would be excellent without. Easy to make, too!

This was delicious and easy and my chicken came out moist and tasty. My vegetables came out badly because I forgot to stir them while cooking, so they got burned on one side, oh well, next time I'll know better. I also added parsnips to them and less turnips. The sauce was great with mashed potatoes, although it took me much longer than the recipe stated, to reduce. My family liked this alot, even my picky 7-yr. old!

This was a fantastic and easy dish to make. Wowed the family even with the turnips! I couldn't find an 8 lb chicken so I used two 4 lb chickens. I did double the mustard sauce to cover two birds and I threw in some fresh whole button mushrooms 20 minutes prior to the finish.

This was one terriffic chicken! Delicious flavor and easy because you just brush with the sauce - there was no trying to rub anything under the chicken's skin as with some roast chicken recipes. The vegetables were also very nice along side. I used potatoes instead of turnips and they were delicious. Definitely a keeper.
