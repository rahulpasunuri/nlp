To prevent sticking, grease the ramekins with butter prior to adding the carmelized sugar. Also reducing the water to 2 tbs when carmelizing the sugar will make it less crystalized (I have other flan recipes that do this and it works just fine). You can also submerge the bottom of the ramekin in hot water for 30 seconds and then run the knife around... The orange in this flan is definitely a must and I would not leave it out..!

This was very tasty and everyone enjoyed it (even some who didn't even like sweet potato). My custard cups aren't particularly large but the serving only filled 6 cups. And I had a problem getting the carmelized topping out of the cups - so we just served it as is. Will certainly make again.

Why on earth would you hold the orange zest!? This recipe is fabulous exactly as it is! I found it very easy and not extremely time consuming. My company loved it as well.

I made this dish by following the instructions and had no issues. I thought it was a great recipe and people seemed to really enjoy it. Next time I will hold back on the orange zest though.

Okay, I prepared this w/ trepidation given the cauation on the caramel topping. I really buttered up the custard cups, especially on the bottom and then prepared the recipe as called for, adding a tad more vanilla then noted in the recipe. I also roasted the potatoes in the oven. I have found this helps to bring out the natural sweetness of the yams. I also do it this way when I make sweet potato pie. I refrigerated over night, brought them out and let the cups come to room temp. I then placed the cups back in a baking dish, added almost boiling water and then placed the dish in a 300 degree oven for about 15 minutes. I then removed the pan from the oven and let the cups rest in the water for another 10 minutes. Whe I removed the flan, some of the topping had liquified and when the dish was inverted it made a great presentation, not unlike many Latin restaurants. I consulted with a friend, reared on Latin cooking, evidently the caramel is supposed to stick them bottom of the pan. If it all came off it would be hard and difficult to eat. I will make this again, but the dish is a lot of work. This was a perfect compliment to rich dinner party meal: salad w/pears and blue cheese; crown roast of pork, stuffed w/ wild-rice pecan pilaf and haricot verts.

Actually, I was hoping to find a recipe that I remember from a Bon Appetit magazine ca. 1987-1988. It was made in a single baking dish instead of several small ones. Also, I don't recall putting whipping cream in it. Does anyone else remember that recipe?

I love flan and sweet potatoes; had high hopes for this recipe. The caramel turned out well and the texture was very nice, but it was just too sweet for a flan. Maybe less sugar in the custard would help. In future, I'll stick to regular flan. Had same experience with much of the caramel sticking to bottom of pan.

The flan is delicious, but there is one major problem with the instructions in this recipe: there must be some trick to getting the caramel not to stick to the baking dish. Ours set like concrete in the bottom of the dishes. Anybody know? Another recipe in Bon Appetit suggests spraying the baking dish with a non-stick vegetable oil. Is that what's needed?
