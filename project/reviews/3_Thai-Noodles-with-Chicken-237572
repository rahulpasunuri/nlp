This is one of my go-to recipes for summer -- or sometimes in winter when I just WISH it were summer. It's healthy, tasty, and makes pretty good leftovers. Like others, I use coleslaw mix to save on prep time. The only downside is that as leftovers the noodles get mushy (I add them to each plate when serving to avoid this.)

Love it when healthy meets delicious! This is a great summer dish, when all of the produce and herbs are either local or gathered from your garden. Even though the ingredient list may look a bit long, it goes together pretty quickly if you have a sharp knife or a food processor with a julienne blade. We made this for our community garden bi-weekly dinner - half with roasted chicken and half with some sautéed tofu. The other best part about this one is that the leftovers make great lunches!!!

I thought this had a lot of flavor and was quite good. I also saved a little time and cheated with bags of coleslaw mix and julienned carrots. Perfect meal to make in this heat wave we're having and I doubled it so no cooking the next night. Yay!

I cut the fat by using boiled skinless chicken breast. Tofu would be great this way too. I cut the time by not preparing my carrots julienned. Instead I used a vegetable peeler to make strips. Aside from that method, this recipe is best done with a sharp knife. I also cut the sugar and the tastes in here are already complex enough without it. Didn't seem missing at all. Had a truly authentic Thai taste. Healthy, simple and delicious!

This sounded great. I made the crucial mistake of not reading the whole recipe before starting my prep. Once all my veggies were julienned and chopped, I realised there was no cooking of anything BUT the noodles. I was after a hot dish. So I adjusted the recipe a little and cooked all the vegetables with the oil/lemon mixture and wha-la....not bad.

Really good, always a hit at our house. Save time by purchasing a bag of shredded cabbage from the grocery store.

Tasty. A little time intensive, but good and refreshing!
