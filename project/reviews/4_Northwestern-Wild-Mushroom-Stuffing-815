I've been making this stuffing since 1994. Still have the original magazine. It's wonderful...why change? Plus my family would have my head!

This stuffing was good, but not as stellar as I had hoped. I would definitely only use 2 Tbsp's of thyme making this again rather than 3 (maybe I chopped it too small and had too much but the thyme flavor was a bit much). As much as I love mushrooms I still like cornbread/sausage/pecan/cranberry stuffing much better.

I was disappointed. Used expensive wild mushrooms and the shitakes and others were over-cooked in my opinion at 20 minutes + all the time in the oven. Next time I would brown them nicely and then save some for a topping as well as some hazelnuts, otherwise too mushy. Expected a more exotic flavor, but tasted a lot like standard stuffing. Also, would suggest a heartier bread if you like a stuffing with more texture.

A hit, just a everyone commented. I couldn't find the porcini mushrooms, so I omitted. Instead, I used an entire can of chicken broth to moisten.

Having the opportunity to make this recipe in Oregon for Thanksgiving, in a bumper year for wild mushrooms... is a dream! We made this to go along with grilled wild salmon and local cranberry relish. Cantrell mushrooms made an excellent addition. We also used dried wild mushrooms (including morels) instead of just porchini. Crusty sourdough bread worked wonderfully in place of egg bread. The only draw back is that it makes a seriously huge portion. Even attempting to half the recipe we have pleanty of leftovers after five of us doing our best. Don't tell anyone .. but we ran out of fresh thyme (3 T. is a lot to pull off your little potted plant) and had to supplement with 'dried Italian seasoning'... which worked out fine. Seriously: this is a total home run.

I've made this many times and everyone loves it. I sometimes use egg bread, sometimes sour dough or buttermilk bread. This recipe also works well as a side dish for beef. Just swap out the chicken broth for beef broth and add a bit of rosemary. You can't go wrong. The flavor is always rich and delightful.

Does anyone have any suggestions on what to substitute for the egg bread? I can't find it anywhere and I want to make this recipe for Xmas.

This was a delicious stuffing, but it was a lot of work, and it makes a ton! I had 20 people for Thanksgiving, and I still have a substantial amount after 2 nights of eating leftovers. I didn't remove the crust, and if you cut the bread the day before and turn it at least once, you won't have to toast it. Also, husking the hazelnuts is a pain, but if you toast them first, some of the husks just slide right off.

I have made this two years in a row, and every year the compliments come pouring in. We had vegetarians for Thanksgiving this year so I used a veggie-broth as well and it came out perfectly. I make this with a Shiitake mushroom gravy, which tastes divine on the stuffing. All the chopping is well worth the results.

Out of this world! I made this for Thanksgiving, and the only change that I made was to use vegetable broth instead of chicken because I'm vegetarian. Everybody LOVED this - the mixture of mushrooms gives it so much depth of flavor, and the toasted hazelnuts were a perfect compliment. This will be a holiday favorite from now on.

This is another yearly request, and coming to Thanksgiving with anything else is not acceptable! I pair this with a rubbed turkey and wild mushroom gravy, and my family goes nuts! I will try using chestnuts this year, as recommended by another. It takes some time, and lots of mushrooms (especially if you are doing the gravy also) but it is well worth it!

This is a MUST MAKE Recipe. It is such a home run. If I discuss making something new, I have to make this stuffing PLus the new dish because everyone loves this. Who cares about how much the mushrooms cost, people love it. Order the egg bread a few days before and make sure that the bakery (at the supermarket) doesn't cut it. Yum Yum. Enjoy!

Used portobello, crimini, porcini and shitake mushrooms and added white wine. Also subsituted chestnuts for the hazelnuts - it was wonderful and my guests loved it. Will definitely make again.

I began making this stuffing in 1994 and have done so for every Thanksgiving since. It does take some time, but the payback is in the raves you get from those who enjoy their food. I'm going to try several of the variations that I see in some of the other comments and see if they improve on the original. That will be hard.

I used all of the liquid required last year & found it to be a bit mushy - though still very popular. I suggest adding liquid sparingly & to taste. We'll make it again this year - may become a tradition! Very yummy.

This is an excellent recipe, and fairly easy to make. It has become a family tradition in our house. It works well with glazed, basted, or rubbed poultry; I've tried it with turkey and hens. A must for Thanksgiving!

Very Delicious! We use vegetarian broth and always substitute with homemade cornbread. This a great hearty stuffing for vegetarians to enjoy...last year I baked it in a hollowed out pumpkin and served it as the main course! Other years, I have prepared it with the Apricot Glazed Turkey that it was originally paired with in the magazine..they are a perfect combination of gourmet flavors!

Was very good and everyone loved it. It was a lot of work though. I cut a corner by using store bought dried bread cubes and I highly recommend this as a time saver. I halved the butter, used portabello mushrooms instead of shiitakes (couldn't find), omitted the eggs (for a less dense texture) and doubled the fresh sage. I just added chicken stock to the desired moistness I wanted. Don't worry about husking the hazelnuts, it's very time consuming and no one will ever know in the end.

Alot of trouble and expense for just "pretty good" results. I had really high hopes for this stuffing but was disappointed. Next year I will return to using my recipe that is based on packaged stuffing mix and includes dried cherries, sausage and lots of mushrooms and celery. It has a much better flavor and consistency.

For Thanksgiving 2000, I made this recipe substituting pine nuts for the hazlenuts and using oyster mushrooms instead of porcini. I also slightly increased the butter which resulted in a stuffing so moist, I did not need to add any broth at all. The egg bread I used was quite sweet. It was declared by several friends to be "possibly the best stuffing" they'd ever been served.

It has become a standard for our Thanksgiving meal.

I've been making this recipe since 1994 and will continue to make for our Thanksgiving dinner. Everyone who's eaten it raves aout it. I also add 2 lbs. of portabello mushrooms and use pinenuts instead of the hazelnuts.

I used pecans instead of hazelnuts, portabello instead of porcini mushrooms, and only half of the butter, but the result was delicious. Moist, nutty and mushroomy!
