As others have noted, the proportions are way off and if you make the recipe as is your sauce will be very thin. Go ahead and use the 6 oz of chocolate, but instead about a just use approx a half cup of whipping cream....

If you find the sauce too thin add a teaspoon of corn starch whisked into the cream before it boils. That's what Jacques Pepin does.

I reduced the cream to 1 cup and it was still amazingly thin. I suppose I could try making it with 3/4 cup of cream, but I'm not sure that would help. Yet if I go all the way down to 1/2 cup that is almost a chocolate glaze. The flavor was good - plenty of chocolate.

So simple, and so good! You might want to use less cream if the dessert you're pairing this with needs a thicker sauce - this sauce as it stands is very thin. I can imagine using this with so many desserts!
