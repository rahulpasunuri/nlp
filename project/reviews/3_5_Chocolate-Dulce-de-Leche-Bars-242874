These bars were delicious! I could not say anything else about them. Besides the time, they were super easy to make and taste like a little piece of heaven. Outstanding recipe.

These bars are okay. I think there is a better use for the dulce de leche, you cannot taste it, the final bar tastes like a good chocolate pudding bar but not extraordinarily good.

@ tbjay - I made these using the Argentinian dolce de leche - which came in the form of a caramel creme spread, not a solid block. I've also made them before with cajeta substituting for dolce de leche.

Okay, I have a problem with this recipe. It sounds really good. But i need clarification. When they say dulce de leche what do they mean? Cause Mexican dulce de leche is not the same as Argentinan dulce de leche. Mexican dulce comes as a long block of candy. Which is not how i believe the Argentinan's have thiers. Anyone have a clue?

Personally, I think that the bars were good but not great. I'm not sure but there was something about that just didn't really seem right, if you know what I mean (although you probably don't or won't)

A terrific little treat - easy to make and family-friendly. Although this recipe was first published in July, the bars could be served at any time of year. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

Wow, these are sooo good. I have never made my own dulce de leche but did for this recipe. My first method didn't turn out but my second one did. I am so glad for it... I think that is what made these so yummy. They ended up being a hit at the home school party I took them to. I would do these again in a heart beat. So rich and creamy!

These are quite delicious. They are time consuming to make, especially if you are also making your own dulce de leche like I did. But I felt it was worth it. Like many others the fat separated when I added the chocolate. This is the reason I gave it only three forks because they don't address this in the recipe and it is obviously an issue. I just keep beating it with the spoon and as it cooled the fat eventually reincorporated. It's a bit tedious as it probably took an extra 10 minutes (and my arm was about ready to fall off) but it worked and the layer was totally smooth and delicious.

Rating: 4
So there are a few balancing points with this recipe. A balance between chocolate and Dulche, a balance between sweetness and saltiness, and a balance between firmness and gooiness. For the first, I use exactly 6 oz of 70% cocoa chocolate to the one cup of Dulche. For the second, I add Fleur de Sel while heating the chcolate/Dulche mixture, and for the gooiness, I use 3 yolks. It sounds a bit restrictive, but this combination of modifications makes this dessert amazing...

I made these yesterday and they taste really good, but I'm not sure if I did something wrong because the top layer seems to be too soft of a consistency. They're hard to cut without messing them all up, and they're impossible to pick up without getting a big mess of chocolate all over your fingers. Is this how they always turn out or did I do something wrong?

Rating: 4
Extremely tasty and easy to make. I did find that there was a little bit of separation of the fat as the bars chilled but they taste so good, I'm definitely willing to accept the aesthetic.

Rating: 4
Very, very good. I took others' advice: only 4 oz of chocolate, added sea salt on top, and refrigerated overnight. It tastes like a very sophisticated Twix bar. Big hit at a party.

Rating: 3
This was easy to make, but my final top layer wasn't perfectly smooth as the dulce de leche clumped a little. Didn't affect taste or texture, both of which were good - just meant they weren't as pretty as the ones in the picture. As other reviewers indicate, you probably haven't had anything quite like this before and thus will either think it's not chocolatey enough or not dulce de leche-y enough... but regardless, you'll have to agree it's very good. I will probably stick with something that tastes more "classic" to me in the future, like toffee bars with a chocolate layer.

I have the same question about the at separating. what did we do wrong?

Takes a bit of time to make. Mine did go up to 180 degrees, looked a little grainy but was fine when cooled down. Taking them to a Superbowl party- will see what the reaction is.Added the sea salt to the top- a wonderful idea.

I haven't tasted the bars as I just finished them. I added my egg yolks no problem. The mixture did get to 180 degrees extremely fast. I pulled it off the fire and added the chocolate. The mixture then began to separate. Right now I'm cooling it down so that the fat while rise to the top. Can anyone tell me what I did wrong?

Rating: 4
These are perfect! Must refrigerate overnight for best results. Sprinkle some Maldon Sea Salt to bring out the chocolate and caramel flavors!

Rating: 0
Once I put the chocolate into the egg yolk mixture, it separated. I am assuming it was too hot? I used 70% cacao, does this make a difference? Any advice? I will try again when given some guidance.

Rating: 3
An amazing taste, the richest possible flavors combined in this bar cannot be denied. However I would suggest the shortbread-to-chocolate ratio is too small. The chocolate overwhelms the shortbread base. Not if, but WHEN I make it again, I will increase the shortbread by at least half-again. I was a little confused by one instruction: not having a candy thermometer, I wasn't sure if it was okay to remove the mixture when it made "tracks from the spoon in the saucepan." Did that mean it was ready to go to the next step?

I have made these bars many times, always to rave reviews and requests for the recipe. Easy and different, and always delicious. Try freezing them and then serving right from the freezer on a summer's evening. Fantastic.

Very happy with the results, I couldnt stop going back for one more bite!

Very good but I would prefer them to be a little firmer than the pudding- like texture it yielded so next time will use 6 oz chocolate and I think that will be just right for my taste. I used Alton's recipe and it made the perfect amount. (http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/a lton-brown/dulce-de-leche- recipe/index.html). I will definitely make these again but next time I will buy President's Choice Dulce de Leche because it wasn't worth the hassle of making it for a dessert that is mixed with chocolate but it does lend a wonderful background note

Absolutely amazing! Very creamy delicious..The perfect amount of chocolate. I made my own dulce de leche through a website search which came out perfect. I made it for our Christmas eve party tommorrow but am afraid they wont make it that long!

Rating: 4
Thanks to user reviews, the second attempt at this recipe worked like a charm by using less chocolate and chilling for a longer period of time. The rectangular shaped cuts are very pretty and a more unusual presentation. For those of you in a hurry, pre-packaged dulce de leche imported from Argentina or Uruguay (find them in specialty shops) are quite good. My Latino friends raved!

Beware - these are dangerously good.

I think people are getting too caught up in the Dulce de Leche (DdL)...the first word is Chocolate, and so chocolate is supposed to be the highlighted taste, or else they would have called it Dulce de Leche Chocolate Bars. That said, yes, chocolate trumps the DdL in this recipe while the DdL provides a smooth fudgy texture. These taste like fudge with a cookie crust. I used nestle's canned DdL from the Hispanic aisle...I wouldn't waste homemade DdL on a recipe where it's flavor isn't the keynote. (I tasted the canned DdL before adding it, and it was really very good.)

Rating: 4
Beautiful and impressive party food. I wiped off the knife and dipped it in hot water between every cut, but it was worth it to get such pretty little bars. Great contrast between the soft pudding-like chocolate and the buttery shortbread crunch.

Rating: 4
These were delicious. I made them for a party and they were gone in a flash. Next time I will make the dulce de leche ahead of time, as these bars were a bit time-consuming to make. I used the dulce de leche recipe from another site as others have suggested.

Rating: 4
Phenomenal! Made these for coworkers and everyone loved them. Definitely make sure you refrigerate them overnight before cutting- 2 hours is not long enough for them to firm up. I took others' advice and used the Alton Brown recipe to make my own dulce de leche. I *loved* the end result! Much more creamy and "real" tasting than when I make DDL with condensed milk. If making the Alton Brown recipe, definitely make sure you cook it long enough, otherwise the bars won't hold their shape (I think this is why some people had gooey bars.) It should be very deep caramel-brown, and when refrigerated the DDL should be thick and essentially solid.

I was looking for a more dulce de leche flavor than a chocolate flavor. Next time I'll add maybe 2 ounces of chocolate and an extra egg.

Rating: 4
These bars are incredible and worth the time. I also made my own dulce de leche using Alton Brown's recipe. (It took 5 hours to reduce the mixture to about 1c. but I had the time.) I used a 10 in square pan with removable bottom for the crust and it was thin and crispy. Added only 4 oz. of 60% chocolate for the filling. It did take away a bit from the caramel taste of the dulche de leche but I wanted to pretty much follow the recipe as written the first time. Sprinkled the top with a little sea salt as suggested for the sweet/salty taste. Wonderful! The bars freeze well.

Rating: 0
This was pretty good, actually. I made the Dulce de Leche using a simple recipe, so that wasn't a problem. After I was done with the bars, I could still taste the dulce de leche but the chocolate was slightly overpowering, but not in a bad way. My shortbread crust was a little strange but it was probably because I did something wrong. I'd definitely make this again.

These are delicious! I used homemade Dulce de Leche from Alton Brown's recipe (http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/dulce-de-leche-recipe/index.html)--sorry Epicurious! I preferred this recipe, as it uses just milk and sugar rather than condensed milk. Takes a bit longer, but is surely worth it. Yum. At the advice of some other reviews, I reduced the chocolate just a wee bit and topped it with a sprinkle of sea salt. The salt is a great touch, as it helps to cut the sweetness. I'd recommend letting these chill for quite a while before cutting. With an overnight chill and 30 min. in the freezer, they were still rather gooey and messy. Easily worth the trouble, though!

Rating: 4
These bars were amazing! I made my own dulce de leche as suggested by other reviewers. A nice touch if you like salty-sweet: sprinkle a little salt (like Maldon) on top. I'm not a huge chocolate lover and appreciated the caramel flavor coming through.

Rating: 4
These are a definite keeper! I used the dulce de leche sauce recipe on epicurious as another reviewer recommended. I only had an 8" square pan, but that worked fine. I made them on a Sunday and on Tuesday the shortbread was still crunchy. Wish they weren't all gone already!

Rating: 3
This is an interesting recipe. I had never had dulce de leche before. I was hoping that the chocolate would override the dulce de leche taste, as other reviewers state, but I could still taste the caramel pretty clearly. It was very tasty but since I mainly wanted a creamy chocolate bar, not sure if it was what I was looking for. If I have company and want to impress them, however, I will definitely make this again. :) It was extremely easy to make. I used a smaller pan than the instructions state (8" round pan) and the crust was a bit too thick. If I make it again, I'll definitely use the size pan called for so the crust dominates less.

Rating: 3
these turned out great! i followed others' advice and only used 4 ounces of chocolate. i was short on time so i had to make the dulce de leche in the microwave (couldn't find it in my neighborhood) which i was not happy about. i also used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream. even after all the tweaking everything turned out fine and i sprinkled coarse sea salt on every square (i made little squares instead of bars) they were perfect. today is day 2 and they are even better straight out of the fridge..so chewy!!

Rating: 2
i didn't want the dulce de leche flavor to be masked by the chocolate, so following another reviewer's advice, i separated the chocolate layer from the dulce de leche/cream/egg combo. this failed miserably. the chocolate layer was hard and cracked in irregular shapes (not squares or rectangles), and the dulce de leche layer oozed out underneath, because it never firmed up enough. so DON'T separate the two layers! my husband still liked the way they tasted, but they looked awful and i was too embarrassed to send them to work with him.

Delicious. I loved these bars as did everyone who tried them. Taking the advice of other reviewers who thought the chocolate taste was overpowering, I put in only a handful of chocolate chips; just enough to give it that chocolate color and it came out great.

I think this was a great bar cookie. I used Ghiradelli semi-sweet chocolate chips, made my own dulce de leche. I will made it again, and do it with out the chocolate to see if it is as good.

I made this for a friend and her sister for their birthdays, and everyone liked it a lot. It was my 1st time cooking with dulce de leche (which I found in a jar in Whole Foods) but from previous commenters, it seems that it'd be easy to make myself. The one thing I wonder is whether or not I messed up the look of the dulce de leche by 1) substituting half and half for the heavy cream (I forgot to buy it the day before and had only half and half in the fridge). And I also wonder if I overcooked the mixture? because it came out a little lumpy. It wasn't because of the yolks, that I know. it didn't affect the taste (I could easily taste the caramel) but look-wise, it wasn't exactly the prettiest. But as everyone said, once you tasted it, who cared? I plan to make this again, and will definitely make sure to have the heavy cream on hand.

Rating: 4
I don't agree with the other reviewers. These were a huge hit! In fact, they liked them more than my key lime pie which is required at every Christmas and Thanksgiving. I will definitely be making them again. I found them to be very easy and liked by all.

All I know is, whether or not you can taste the dulce de leche, these puppies made people's eyes take on a dreamy look. The chocolate lovers at my dinner party ate them all. I will definitely make again.

Like many of the other reviewers, I thought the chocolate overpowered the carmel flavor. If you prefer dark chocolate you will probably love these; I prefer semi-sweet, and so I would make them with semi-sweet chocolate next time or add sugar. After reading the reviews, I might also consider using cajeta instead and/or making layers of dulce de leche and chocolate. I love the shortbread crust and the combo of it with the fudge. The recipe is quick and easy to make and very good; for those reasons this recipe is worth tinkering with to get right. FYI: as mentioned by another reviewer, the concoction quickly turns 'grainy' soon after reaching 170 (not noticeable after it is cooled though). Try 165 degrees instead(or just prepare to act quickly). Question: Do they spoil after a day or two? I'm not sure why they can be made only one day before. This is the second day and my shortbread has not softened.

Rating: 2
I was excited about these but I thought they were way too sweet. I served them after a dinner party and we each had one small one and that was more than enough. Then the next night I took them to a party and they still didn't get eaten. Eventually I tossed the rest. If I were going to make them again I might try doubling the shortbread or halving the dulce de leche. But I would probably just try another recipe.

Rating: 4
Wonderful! I disagree with the some of the reviews about the dulce de leche being lost. I found the flavor was there---but more so the excellent texture of the cookie top. And the cookie was so yummy. I found them to be best on the day made because on the next day the cookie had softened. Do try them you will not be disappointed!

These were really tasty and very popular with my family. I do agree with some of the other reviewers that the dulce de leche was overpowered by the chocolate, but I don't necessarily consider that a bad thing. Just don't make these expecting a whole lot of caramel flavor. I didn't want to use store-bought dulce de leche so I searched for a recipe on epicurious and found a really easy way to make your own. Just type in "dulce de leche sauce" and it's the first recipe that pops up.

Rating: 0
Unfortunately even though I reduced the amount of chocolate I added, it still overpowered the dulce de leche flavor. I doubt I will make it again, but if I do I will probably use milk chocolate because the 60% cacao was too bitter. I loved the shortbread crust, and the consistency of the dulce de leche was great, but kind of sticky.

Rating: 2
I used 4 oz. of chocolate because of previous users commenting that the dulce de leche is drowned out by chocolate. I could barely taste it even w/reducing the chocolate. The consistency and flavor are lovely but you won't be bowled over by a caramel flavor.

I just made these! YUM!! After reading reviews saying the chocolate over powers the dulce de leche I changed a couple of things. I only had a 10 in. pan so I made a double batch of shortbread. Then for the topping I made the dulce de leche with the cream and egg. I poured that over the shortbread and spread it out. Then I sprinkled bittersweet chocolate chips over the top of that. I let it sit for a minute. Then I spread the chocolate around. It worked perfectly. It is like a double layer bar! So good! I had some hazelnut praline crumbs leftover from another recipe so I sprinkled that on top of the chocolate. These are so awesome and so easy to make.

I made homemade dulce de leche as per http://www.davidlebovitz.com/archives/2005/11/dulce_de_lechec.html Boiling a can of sweetened condensed milk may expose you to 1. an exploding mass of sticky goo 2. a number of chemicals in the inner can lining. I thought these bars were delicious, but was disappointed by the crumbliness of the shortbread. I agree with the other reviewer that commented on the dulce de leche being overpowered by the chocolate.

For the cook from Boca Raton: You can buy dolce de leche but the best thing is to make it. Put an unopened can of sweetened condensed milk in a pot, cover it with at least 3 inches of water and bring to a simmer. Simmer the can for three hours, let cool and use. You can keep unopened cans in the fridge for months, so I usually make 3 or 4 at a time. Stir before using. To use as a nice caramely topping warm in a saucepan, add a teaspoon of vanilla and a tablespoon of butter. Happy cooking

This was okay. The deliciousness of de dulce de leche was lost in the chocolate. It would be great witholding the chocolate and then drizzling it on top.

Rating: 4
Despite a few problems, these were wonderful and worth the trouble. Could only find cajeta, which is much thicker than dulce de leche and has a higher sugar content. When I added the egg yolks, I cooked very carefully and took the temp to 170. I turned off the heat and reached over for a spatula...in that short amount of time (about 5 seconds) my egg yolks started to scramble! I just strained the mixture right over the chocolate, stirred to melt,and they came out great! Next time I will use a double boiler to cook the cajeta/egg mixture and not take it all the way to 170 degrees. My husband devoured them!

VERY GOOD - - & worth the calories!. I made these for a July 4th picnic. ...a few tips: * Freeze bars a few hours (this makes cutting much easier) * Cut bars in small bite-sized squares (very rich-tasting) * Use the best quality bittersweet chocolate that you can find. This was a quick, easy and sinfully-delicious picnic/potluck dessert.
