This dish was wonderful and heart warming. I used vegetable broth and a little cherry liquor for the liquids, and dried thyme instead of fresh (didn't have any marjoram). 19 minutes were enough for the arbiorio (package instructions called for 18). Topped it with fresh pepper and fresh parmesan shavings, and we just couldn't have enough...

I will tweak this recipe for the future, most importantly omitting the cream (dessert) sherry - too sweet! The squash is sweet, the chestnuts are sweet - just too much sweet for my taste. The fresh herbs help, as does the umami of the cheese, but recipe will be better without the sherry (IMHO).

This dish was wonderfull. I made it for Christmas and by the time I went to get a serving there was none left.

Fantastic recipe with a complex, rich flavor! I substituted vegetable broth for chicken broth, vermouth mixed with half-and-half for the creamed sherry, tarragon for the marjoram and thyme. Otherwise the cooking procedure was as written. Personally I loved the chestnut addition (bought peeled in a jar from Trader Joe's)... This recipe will become a standard for me.

I made this as a thanksgiving side- no one ate it. It wasn't good at all. It was tossed out at the end of the dinner. What a shame- a lot of effort for nothing.

I made this as described except for using a bit of rosemary in place of the marjoram. It didn't work for me--I couldn't taste the squash, and the chestnuts (frozen from Trader Joe's) made the dish mealy. That said, my husband liked it reasonably well. If I were to do it again, I'd try the previous reviewer's suggestion about keeping some squash out til the end, and I would greatly reduce the quantity of chestnuts.

This is insanely good. I've made it many times and have experimented with technique to make it just about perfect (I think). The only shortfall of the recipe as written is that the squash gets so soft by the end it sort of gets lost. I withold 1/3 of the diced squash, steam it until almost fully cooked, and add it toward the end. That way you have more distinct squash bits. Prettier too. And for those concerned with time-- you can add 3 full cups at the beginning (maybe even more), stir until absorbed, and then start the 1/2 cup at a time method. The end result is virtually indistinguishable from the 'textbook' version, and it's far less tedious.

Would it change the results much to use vegetarian broth rather than chicken?

I made this recipe exactly as described (but doubled it). I tried to roast the chestnuts myself, but it didn't work out too well - I couldn't get the shells off about half of them. I used 1/2 roasted chestnuts and 1/2 jarred chestnuts. The result was good, but not great. I served it as a main course, but I think it would be better as a side dish only. I might also add the chestnuts earlier next time and/or chop them more finely (?) - I found them not hot enough and too overpowering for the risotto (in terms of volume/texture, not flavor).

This was fabulous! I just used all of the butternut squash and I used the recommended amount of chestnuts. I think the proportions don't really matter that much - it would be hard to mess this up.

This recipe was excellent. I received tons of compliments for the 12 people I served it to for Thanksgiving. I doubled the recipe and only used about 1/2 of the chestnuts. You can really taste the sherry. Or maybe it's the aroma? It wasn't super easy though. And I mean that as far as the time it took for the risotto to soak up the broth. Lots of stirring and a big time commitment. Thankfully, everything else I made just had to be baked because I prepped ahead.

This dish is delicious but I would suggest adding the chestnuts slowly and to taste, as two cups would have overwhelmed the other flavors.

Very good! I only used 1 cup of chestnuts - thought 2 cups was too much.

Pretty good risotto but not great. Since butternut squash comes in such a range of sizes, it would be better if the recipe specified a quantity. I cooked them along with the rice as instructed and found they were done properly. Canned chestnuts are more soft than fresh but are more convenient--I used mostly canned cut up small and a few fresh ones cut larger for garnish. Flavors work well together but it seems to need something--maybe prosciutto or smoked ham.

It was great! The only change I made was to start cooking my rice before the squash. I want the squash to be a little firm. I was full of different flavors.
