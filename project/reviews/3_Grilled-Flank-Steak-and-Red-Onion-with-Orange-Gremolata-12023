I served this buffet style for a party of 8. I put the flank on big cutting board with the gremolatta sprinkled generously over the meat. I then put the onions on top of that. It not only looked great but tasted wonderful. Will make it again.

There are so many great steak recipes on this site, I cringe to think of how much steak I've eaten since I discovered Epicurious. I totally haunt the butcher counter at my local grocery store and the butcher always wants to know what I'm making--I also turned him on to this site and he thanked me for it the next time I saw him! Anyway: this is a good recipe. I was looking for something different (but still steak) and this is certainly different. I told my boyfriend as we were eating the little story about gremolata that heads this recipe, and a couple days later I heard him regaling someone at a party with the history of gremolata, condensed. Thanks Epicurious, for making us look smart.

Sorry cooking fans. This wasn't a great success. It was welcomed with less than enthusiasim by the Family. Too bad for me though, I reather enjoyed the new flavors

I wanted to try something different and was ready for complaints about the seasoning. My husband and two sons loved it. Not too spicy just "juicy with flavor" commented by 10 year old. I had to make some substitutions: I added chopped shallots to the marinade. The Gremolata included dried garlic powder,orange peel and fresh parsley. I sprinkled it on both sides of the meat and grilled it a little longer. We all like our beef well done. Definitely will make again. Not even left overs for sandwiches...

This recipe was not time consuming, wasn't ingredient intensive, yet was delicious. I would recommend it to anyone who would like a nice grilled steak with subtle flovars but doesn't want to spend the entire evening in the kitchen. The dish I served was accompanied with angle hair pasta in a parmesean cream sauce and steamed broccoli.

This dish has become a staple in our house. We make it for company all of the time. Everybody is surprised at how well the orange gremolata tastes with the beef.
