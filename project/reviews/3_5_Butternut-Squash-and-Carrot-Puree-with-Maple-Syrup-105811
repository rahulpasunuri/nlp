Delicious! Made as written and I wouldn't change a thing. Brought this dish to Thanksgiving dinner last night and everyone loved it. Just sweet enough. Very simple and easy to make with great results!

My cooking time to soften squash and carrots was much longer then indicated on recipe. I live at 8000' but normally do not have this problem. The taste was good but it took some time to puree and I was afraid it would turn to soupy. Overall, it was a good accompaniment for Thanksgiving but would not make it otherwise.

First time I made it for Thanksgiving and it was a fabulous substitute to mashed potatoes. Made my life easier b/c I could prep it in advance and the guests loved it b/c it was not as heavy as mashed potatoes...even though I do love mashed potatoes. It also presente beautifully. I did add a bit less maple syrup though b/c I had fruit in my stuffing already and didn't want it too sweet. Excellent dish

Such a beautiful color and a delicious addition to a basic meal! The prep of the butternut squash was a bit time consuming; however, worth every moment.

My family requests that I make this dish for Thanksgiving every year. My two year old nephew loves it too!!

I made this for Thanksgiving a couple of years ago and forgot about it but everyone raved about it. Preperation is simple and it can be made ahead and reheated in a covered dish in the oven. I'll definitely be making it again this year!

so so so good! I almost had to make another batch because i couldn't stop "tasting" it! Kids loved it too!

Everyone loved this except for me - too sweet for my taste. But you cannot argue with a dozen clean plates.

Great recipe! Perfect as is -- all my guests (from 3 different generations) raved... only modification was I cut the OJ to 3/4 cup to keep the flavor from dominating. Puree was thick and hearty.

I put the squash in the microwave to cook it and used all the 250mL of orange juice as I added it slowly. The consistency remind me of baby food so I added a cup and a half of chicken stock and served it with a dollop of sour cream as a soup before our Thanksgiving dinner. One of the best soups my husband said he has ever had so I will use this recipe for a fabulous seasonal soup.

This recipe was great...a total comfort food! I didn't have any OJ so I used water and 3 packets of splenda. It was so delicious and I can't wait to make it again!

I didn't have any orange juice (substituted grape, sounds weird but it worked) and used fake maple syrup and still the dish was good. Instead or pureeing it I used a potato masher -- still smooth and incredibly tasty. Made this on a weekend to use up a big squash I had. It was yummy!

Made this last night as a trial run for the holidays- absolutely delicious-and can be made ahead which I love! Definitely a keeper-tastes "special", slightly sweet, and reheats beautifully-

This was a wonderful side dish with chicken roll-ups stuffed with goat cheese and basil. It was a bit too sweet for our tastes so I will cut OJ with chicken broth next go round.

The photo in the magazine looked so good I just had to add this to our Thanksgiving menu - and I'm so glad I did. I followed the recipe exactly - as I always do the FIRST time, and everyone LOVED it. A delicious, light addition, not too sweet, good flavour and superb texture. I'll definitely be making this again throughout the winter months as part of our regular meals.

PS Good idea to use previous reviewer's suggestion to cut squash in 2 pieces first but I used a knife to cut the peel away - much easier than a peeler. Try it - cut the ends off though so it holds steady, good luck!

This was really good & I am not easy to please. Tastes great without the orange juice & maple syrup. I did not have oj so I subbed pineapple juice & did add the maple syrup as well but this really did not need either one. I also just used a potato masher b/c I prefer more texture. You & your family or guests will love this recipe.

By the way, the easiest way I have found to peel butternut squash is to cut it into two pieces, the neck and the bulb. Peel the neck vertically, like a carrot, and the bulb like an apple. I use a Y-shaped peeler, and have never had any problems.

I microwaved the carrots and squash in the orange juice for about 10 minutes (covered) while the onions were sauteing to speed things up a bit. Then I added the mostly cooked vegetables to the onions and let them finish cooking. Then I used an immersion blender to finish up. It didn't need any salt or pepper, even to my jaded palette. It was superb! I am looking forward to wowing my guests at Thanksgiving with this one.

i was expecting this dish to be okay at best, just a change. it was phenomenal- a huge hit. i could taste each ingredient, and they worked very well together!

I took this to a potluck and got rave reviews--the dish was practically licked clean. My only change was adding in a bit of acorn squash I had on hand.

This recipe needs nothing more. No need to add or substitute ANYTHING. Leave it alone! It is blissful, fabulous, delicousness - and quite easy to prepare. I can't seem to keep enough in my house - it has become a "craving" food.

I worried when I saw puree that this might be a little weird, but I listened to the other reviews and decided to try it. It was delicious. It was a beautiful blend of all the flavors (squash, carrot, onion, maple) and even people who don't like squash complimented the dish. Using real maple syrup added flavor, but it wasn't too sweet. Everyone at the table liked it, so I would definitely make it again. It was a nice change from the normally very sweet sweet-potato or squash recipes.

Great, easy way to eat your veggies...I had some bacon fat around and subbed that for part of the butter -- it was, of course, great. Next time I make this I think that I will use less orange juice (probably half) and grate a bit of the zest (probably 1 or so teaspoons) for the orange flavor. I found it just a tad too watery even after cooking out...wonderful taste, though. Added a bit of salt and a pinch of cayenne pepper (to not take away from the beautiful color with black pepper bits).

I didn't have any orange juice so I used a mango/pineapple/kiwi/carrot juice blend (Western Family Tropical Blend) instead. I also carmelized the onions with a little brown sugar. It was great! Even my 18-yr-old son loved it.

I consider cooked carrots "evil little orange things". But, knowing they'd be blended beyond recognition, I sucked it up and added the offending roots. This was absolutely heaven on a fork. I had to add a bit more juice and a lot more maple syrup to my taste, as well as salt and pepper. There is about 1/4 c. left and I bet it doesn't make it through the night. Dip the Garlic & Rosemary Pork Loin Roast in it...Fabulous!

Nixed the OJ and added cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. "real" maple syrup is not sickeningly sweet like "Log Cabin" or "Mrs. Butterworth" so make sure you use the real thing. very nice!

I made this for Xmas. I thought it was delicious and rich, with only a mild orange/maple flavor. A nice change from sweet potatoes, which several people thought it was. Incidentally, I made it vegan by subbing margarine for the butter.

Rating: 4
Wow! This was great - everyone loved it and asked for more. Liked nutmeg, much more than the cinnamon suggestion When I tried it again with Turban squash, and omitted the carrots, it became even more carmelized - which made for beautiful colour and a more intense flavour. Enjoy!

This was the star of our Thanksgiving table. I have a mandate that we must have it every year. It was the best leftover in the fridge.

I was craving butternut squash and couldn't wait to try this recipe. I found that the orange juice and maple syrup made it a little too sweet to my liking. However, my husband, who doesn't like squash much, really liked this.

Wonderful recipe! I used tangerine juice instead of orange juice, which added a little extra tang. I served it with roast chicken, but I think it would be even better with roast pork. Highly recommended.

This was an awesome recipe....as an aspiring chef at the age of 15 i loved this. My family begged for me to make more. This was a fabulous touh to Thanksgiving dinner. Add some rose mary and it is so delicous.....I will make this whenever i can!

This is fabulous and I like the fact you can make it 2 days in advance. I used only 3/4 cup OJ and 2 1/2 T. maple syrup...the perfect combination. I will make this often....

Don't be lazy like I did and neglect to peel the butternut squash. The food processor did not destroy the peel completely, leaving bits of hard peel in an otherwise silky puree. Everyone liked this dish very much. Since it was being served at a Kosher table, I used parve margarine rather than butter so it could be eaten right next to the (Kosher) turkey!

Delicious! My dinner guests liked it alot too. Next time I will lessen the orange juice a little and try adding a pinch of orange zest and some rosemary.

Peeling the squash is a pain, so just cut it in half in width and length. Then seed and oil the pieces. Bake until soft and you can easily scrape out the flesh. Baking it also makes it darker and sweeter. A bit of bourbon adds another depth of flavor.

The squash eaters in my family really enjoyed this dish at Thanksgiving. Great dish to make ahead and reheat. Will definately make again!

I thought this was delicious and extremely colorful, but it wasn't a huge hit at my family's Thanksgiving. I was initially intimidated by the thought of having to peel and cut the butternut squash, but a regular peeler did the job and the squash really wasn't that difficult to cut after it was peeled. I'll definitely make this again.

I liked this, but the family sure didn't gobble it up. I had 3/4 of it left after our Thanksgiving, disappointing. "Tastey", but not "earth shattering good".

I halved the orange juice and maple syrup, and added a small sprig of rosemary. Excellent warmed up on the second day and even better the cold the third day.

My entire family enjoyed this delicious side dish at thanksgiving so much that there was not even one bite left over. I did cut the amount of maple syrup in half since I didn't want it too sweet, but I definitely will make it again.

I was a little surprised by the other reviews as I made this according to the recipe and got rave reviews from the guests at our Thanksgiving table. I'll make it again - even my semi-fussy teenagers liked it. Great do-ahead side dish.

My family wanted it chunky so I didn't puree it. I thought the orange juice was overpowering when the dish was hot. It is much better cold the next day!

I too cooked a variation of the recipe. I baked to squash first, pureed the carrots by themselvesd, then cooked it together with the orange juice and syrup, then pureed it all again. I served it it a huge bowl, and put a smaller bowl in the middle filled with black beans, then garnished with orange maple leaves. It was a great dish, but I've seen better squash options.

I made this recipe two ways; one as printed which seemed to sweet; to compensate guests added sour cream. I revised it and make it by roasting the squash, yams, and carrots in the oven, then pureeing them with the orange juice, eliminated the maple syrup and instead added curry powder. guests rated this variation 4 forks.

My husband liked this, but I wasn't crazy about it at all. The fresh orange juice gave it a tangy bite that I wasn't after. I used frozen butternut squash that was already cut and cooked that in the microwave, maybe that was it. I would make the recipe as stated and don't use short cuts on the squash like I did. There was just something funky about this so that I wouldn't serve it at Thanksgiving.
