I've also been making this for about five years now. I love the updated take on pumpkin pie. It has a lighter, fluffier texture and a clean, pumpkin-y taste. The crust, when done properly, is crispy and delicate. However, by now I've learned to tweak the recipe to my liking, which includes cutting way back on the sugar in the filling. I agree with other reviewers that the sweet filling paired with the sweet topping is too much! My adjustments: In the filling, halve the sugar (at least). I've made the topping with and without nuts. In the last few years, I've made this with fresh butternut squash instead of pumpkin, with excellent results. Finally, last year I doubled the filling recipe and cooked up the remaining filling as a pumpkin custard.

Reading from the reviews, I used this crust recipe but the filling from anouther. It turned out so satisfying and delicious! The crust was a little tricky and mine, the 'dough' for the crust was not so much dough. In the end it was very good and the crust was a bit flaky (not as much as I hoped) but still good!

The taste is not bad, but the consistency is awful. I felt as if I were eating pumpkin purée straight out of the can. You would have thought that I'd forgotten the eggs, which I hadn't. I used a bit more ginger in the streusel and wished I'd quadrupled it, as you couldn't taste it at all. After reading the reviews, I was expecting a much better pie.

I'm a working pastry chef but pies are not generally my fortay. I made this pie (doubled the streusel) and added spices and evaporated milk in place of the butter for the filling. I loved it and more importantly everyone at dinner ate every crumb and offered kudos to the pie! I also cut the white sugar in half... Really a tasty pie with different textures.

While this is a good recipe, I would not make it again. It is way too sweet. The crunchy topping is a very nice addition, but with all the sugar in the pumpkin filling, it's over the top. I can't imagine how much sweeter it would be with sweetened whip cream as the recipe suggests. I also learned from this recipe that I much prefer pumpkin pie with cream as an ingred. This recipe doesn't have it and the filling lacks the smoothness that the cream gives. Also note that the picture attached to this recipe is not accurate. You'll have a pie with a fully covering crunching topping. Not that it matters too much, but I was doing double takes between looking at the recipe instructions and wondering how on earth the final result would look like that.

This was so yummy! I added pumpkin pie spice to the filling and I doubled the streusel topping just for fun and I'm glad I did, it was great! I also used a store bought pie crust from Trader Joes instead of making the crust and that made things very easy.

Had a first go at this recipe. Didn't make crust but used store-bought to save time because I used real pumpkin. (2 pie pumpkins). Because I used storebought crust I had enough to fill the 2 shallow crusts in the box. Pie turned out great! I would, maybe, cut back a bit on the sugar as well, but it is still very good. Will definately try again making my own crust, for a thicker pie. Using real pumpkin gave the pie a lighter, texture that storebought pie. Very good!

This is simply GREAT! so far who ever tried it, licked his/ her fingers. They wouldn't believe me it was pumpkin... since we don't have the canned ones here, I used fresh pumpkin, cooked it shortly & then mashed it - it works just as well! I'm sure going to make this again.

Wonderful recipe. I have been making it for about three years and always get raves from guests. I use a bit more butter in the crust and it comes out super flakey.

Made this today for a belated Thanksgiving dinner-would have used my normal recipe but was out of evaporated milk so I searched for a recipe that didn't require it. It turned out very well but I must say was a bit sweeter than I would have liked.Next time I would cut the sugar,at least by a third, since the streusel adds sugar too. Used pecans instead of walnuts and that was yummy. Also didn't use the crystallized ginger only because I didn't have any and it was totally OK without it. I would definitely make this again, with a few alterations.

Different from many pumpkin pies because no cream-- which makes it softer-- while the pie part is mild, the streusel is spicy and the flavor and texture contrasts of the soft and the crunchy are great-- this got great reviews from family, along with their previous favorite, the honey pumpkin pie (also on this site). Another favorite. Not too mild, but not so spicy it overwhelms the pumpkin. Even my husband who is not into nuts founnd the streusel a nice touch, not too nutty for him. Kids still preferred the honey-pumpkin pie.

I was served this pie as a guest so I cannot comment on the making process. It was heavenly!! The crusty topping against the smooth pumpkin is a knockout and the ginger just makes it. Top with whipped cream this is a can't miss for pumpkin pie lovers.

I read the reviews for this pie and saw that a lot of people recommended to cut the sugar for the pumkin filling, I agree. I cut the sugar in half and it turned out great. If you like the taste of spices to come out in your pumkin pie use less sugar.

This pie was excellent! Didnt have the ginger on hand so I left it out, it really didnt need it anyway. Everyone devoured this pie. It is very rich however, so small pieces and good coffee are essential!

I made this for Thanksgiving and my husband liked it so much we are making it for Christmas. I substituted extra-virgin coconut oil for the butter in the pie as well as the crust. It was excellent!

Wonderful! Used Pillsbury crust. Couldn't bring myself to use a whole stick of butter in the filling--used 1/2 stick butter and 1/2 cup of milk and a little pumpkin pie spice. Used pecans in streusel. A big hit for Thanksgiving!!

Yum! This was easy to make and everyone loved it. The streusel makes it just different enough.

Even I loved this pie and I am not fond of pumkin pie. Have made this a few times and everyone raved how great it was. Plan on making again for this Thanksgiving. I do believe the cooks who thought this was to sweet used pumkin pie mix (which is already sweetened) instead of plain pumpkin, as it is not overly sweet if using the right ingredients.

I made this for a Thanksgiving potluck last year, and it was very well-received. I loved it for it's lightness (it was at the same time rich with an almost custardy flavor) and freshness. I used the pulp of a fresh sugar pumpkin rather than canned filling, which I think gave it the fluffier texture. My only qualm is that the filling was too sweet, so this year I plan to cut the sugar by at least 1/3 if not more. I skipped the crystallized ginger in the streusel and didn't miss it. The BUTTER PIE CRUST DOUGH (Bon Appétit, November 2003) was perfect for this pie.

My guests were among those who lowered their faces to their plates and ate in awed silence. I used pumpkin, not pumpkin pie filling! This is a wonderful but rich recipe. Like cheesecake, it is not designed to be consumed by the truck load. Serve thin slices for happy, and healthy, guests. It's a great alternative to tradition.

I am not a fan of pumpkin pie, but my husband really loves them, so I found this recipe and decided to give it a try. I actually enjoyed it and my husband said it was the best he had ever had. So, there you have it.

This recipe left A LOT to be desired. I made this instead of the traditional pumpkin pie, I ate the only piece and I was not impressed!!!! Would definately have been better with pecans as the walnuts were too strong. DON'T BOTHER!!

We really enjoyed this pie. Four people nearly finished it in one evening. I took several suggestions and used milk instead of butter and added 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice to the filling. The streusel is a nice touch, however, my husband thought the filling was a little too sweet with the streusel on top. Next time I will cut the white sugar from the filing in half.

My guests lowered their faces to their plates and silence fell over the table during the consumption of this dessert. Every single person said that it was the best pumpkin pie they had ever eaten. I concur - and I take no credit since I followed the recipe exactly. Next time, I think I would like a crustier streusel so maybe more butter (?) or whatever the hell makes it a little harder - and maybe a little more streusel too - what the heck. Also, I love crystalized ginger so I'd probably add a little more of that too. Really, really excellent dessert!!

Addendum: I wonder if the ccoks who complained that this recipe was too sweet used PUMPKIN PIE FILLING instead of canned PUMPKIN puree in their recipe by error. This is a common mistake and would double the sweetness of the pie and produce a fluffier consistency?!?!

My daughter (a relatively novice cook) made this recipe for the second year for us. She used the recipe as printed except for using my secret pie crust recipe. This now replaces my mother's pie as our regular Thanksgiving pumpkin. It disappeared way to fast...even the non-pumpkin lovers devoured it! It is not too sweet nor even very sweet. It is not too "fluffy" or fluffy at all. It does have a different density than my standard custard-like pie, but so what. The butter crust may make it richer than a shortening crust. If you think it is too rich, try a regular crust. This is now part of my recipe book.

Too, too sweet. You could halve the amount of sugar. Filling is very light & fluffy, different than the usual dense pumkin pie.

This pie was FANTASTIC!!!! I used no ginger due to allergies but used fresh grated nutmeg, added 1/2 again as many walnuts. Got RAVE reviews!!

I have made this pie 2 times and it is such a hit, even among professed non-pumpking eaters. I replaced the walnuts with pecans. Also inserted ground ginger for the crystallized, given cabinet deficiencies -- still delicious. Finally, I recently suggested that my roommate 1 1/2 the crust recipe to get a more substantive lip around the pie pan; the result was perfect and I'll do the same in the future.

All I have to say is WOW. This is my new pumpkin pie recipe, but I like it best with a pecan pastry crust. I don't usually like crystallized ginger, but it is a must for this recipe! I made two, and every crumb disappeared. This is a great recipe...Thanks!!!

I am baking this pie right now for a party. It smells fantastic - but I tasted the uncooked pumpkin filling and am worried that it is EXTREMELY sugary! The batter doesn't taste like pumpkin at all, it tastes like brown sugar and butter...I have my fingers crossed it will taste as good as everyone writes!!!

I received rave reviews for this pie. I'm not a big fan of crystalized ginger so I left this item out. would make again. I also liked that this recipe was less 'fluid' than other pumpkin pie recipes. I get tired of waiting for the pumpkin pie to cook thoroughly with so much liquid included. I disagree withthe other reviewer who said it was too rich to eat. I could've easily eaten the whole thing! LOL

Very good pie but I did make some adjustments that other reviewers recommended: instead of the crystallized ginger in the topping I used 1/2 tsp of ground ginger; used pillsbury pie crust; for the filling, added 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice and used 4 tb butter with 3 tb heavy cream. The filling had a custardy consistency with a nice spicy flavor. The crust was nice and crisp without a soggy bottom and the topping was the best!

Everyone at two different Thanksgiving dinners loved this pie. Since I tripled the recipe, I too cringed at 3 sticks of butter, so I left one out(used 1/3 less butter). I couldn't detect any problem. Next time I will use more nuts and ginger in the streusel

Very Tasty. Will definitely make again.

Made this pie for Thanksgiving and got many compliments. However, most of the servings of pie were not finished. Nor could I finish mine: the first bite was fantastic, the second good, and each following bite was progressively difficult to swallow. Like enjoying one rich chocolate truffle, but not eight or more! Unfortunately just too cloyingly rich for our taste.

I felt the need to add some spices to the pumpkin custard itself, such as 1/2 tsp. cardamom, 1/4 tsp. allspice, 1/8 tsp. cloves.

I thought the filling was a little off--too soft and not seasoned as well as some others. I actually cringed as I added all that butter. Yikes. Next time I will go back to the Ultimate Pumpin Pie from this site.

This pie was so good, it just disappeared. Since it was for Thanksgiving, I opted to carmelize my pecans before making the struedel topping. Next time I'll make individual tarts. Took the hint from another below and added pumpkin pie spice, great idea! Simply delicious.

This is a wonderful recipe! I will defintely make this for Thanksgiving. The streusel was wonderful with the crystallized ginger - it's expensive, but don't skip this ingredient! I was surprised by the amount of butter for the pie filling - I decided to use about 1/2 of the butter and a few tablespoons of heavy cream instead. The only other change I will make for next time is to add some pumpkin pie spice to the pie filling. I did not think this was too sweet at all - I can't believe someone actually made it and threw it away! What a waste!!

Made it for 10 people and was told it was the best pumpkin pie each ever had. Some even were not big pumpkin pie fans and they loved it! I used pecans instead of walnuts and organic pumpkin for a very pumpkiny flavor, also added 1 tsp allspice to filling! Yum!

Fantastic variation to the classic. I substituted pecans for the walnuts, egg beaters for the eggs, and 2 T. milk, for 2 of the T. of butter. The filling is lighter, more orange in color and more pumpkin-y tasting that "normal" pumpkin pie. One of my friends said it was the best pumpkin pie she had ever had and another said it was the best pie she had ever had! Delicious!

This was fantastic! I didn't use candied ginger and only put about .5 teaspoon ground ginger in the streusel. This was out of this world and even better the next morning, real cold for breakfast... Very rich and pumpkin-y! Yumm!

I baked this to see if I would like to use it in place of our regular pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving as we are also having squash pie. The family tried it and loved it and I will be baking this for our Thanksgiving feast. I did make one change in the recipe. Instead of using all that butter, I used 1/2 cup milk and it was great. We loved the streusel topping.
