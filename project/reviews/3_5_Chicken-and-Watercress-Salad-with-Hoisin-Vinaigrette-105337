This was a very good no-cook recipe and easy. Needs a little more texture. Perhaps some sliced toasted almonds or bean sprouts. Dressing was yummy. Please double the amount.

Loved the dressing. Prepped everything in advance and then tossed together. Added waterchestnuts, baby corn, snow peas and bean sprouts. Perfect summer meal.

I use a combo of red and yellow peppers (for the color) and double the sauce recipe -- but I use 2 bunches of scallions and a little more ginger. I prepare everything the night before, store separately and throw it together just before serving.

Really worth making. Instead of fresh ginger, used 3/4 tbsp. chopped ginger-in-a-jar, and instead of watercress, spinach (husband doesn't like cress), and as another reviewer mentioned, mixed about a loose handful chopped fresh cilantro into the spinach. Great hot-weather salad.

This was great! I made it with and without waterchestnuts and I liked it with them better. I used a mix of lettuce instead of watercress and then threw in some chopped cilantro. Hint: double the dressing.

A friend made this recipe, and I loved it so much I had to get online and pull it up for myself... definitely plan to make again!

It's rare that my grocery store has good looking watercress, but one day it did, so I bought several bunches, but had no idea what I was going to do with them. I found this recipe and tried it. Sooo good! I love the exotic flavors! I didn't have any bell peppers on hand, so I french cut green beans and steamed them and tossed them with the dressing. So healthy and delicious. Will definately make again and again. For the rest of the watercress I had on hand, I did PANFRIED TOFU ON SESAME WATERCRESS WITH SOY-ORANGE DRESSING also on this web site and also very, very tasty!

Loved this recipe. It was quick and easy. I prepared it for my niece and her husband who'd just come from their Thai honeymoon. They loved it. I mixed watercress with salad mix of lettuce and made the vinaigrette the day before.

I made the salad according to the recipe with two exceptions: I added sliced fresh water chestnuts and grilled the chicken. I took a huge bowl of the salad to a potluck dinner and it was a great success! It was eaten so quickly I barely got any. There was nothing left in the bowl but two leaves of watercress and a tiny slice of waterchestnut. Totally delicious!
