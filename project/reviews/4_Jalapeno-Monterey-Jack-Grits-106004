I have made this recipe on several occasions. Even those that don't like grits love this recipe. It is real comfort food and is easy to make. Love it! This is a keeper. Great with grilled chicken - or just by itself.

great recipe. I've been making it since the issue came out. My family loves it. I've even taken it to a church potluck and the pot was the first empty.

This tasted okay as I was eating it, but it just wasn't interesting enough to go back for seconds. I used a whole jalapeno and only half the amount of bell pepper listed, but all the flavors still got lost in the bell peppers. I used cayenne pepper to try to round it out. Maybe some ancho or chipotle chiles can help by adding smokiness, but I don't intend to try again. I'm sticking with the Creamy Grits (July 1999) recipe from this site.

Made yesterday for brunch. Delicious and everyone asked for more. Plain grits will never be the same.

Fantastic recipe and oh-so easy. Definitely goes well with all things spicy or even just a nicely grilled steak. Great for breakfast the next morning, too!

WOW! As a true southern girl I give this an old fashion 'oh lordy' It was easy and so fantastic. Served with dinner and leftovers for breakfast! This is the best way I have ever had grits!

Absolutey delicious and so easy to make. I sauteed the peppers and grated the cheese the day before. A very big hit at my luncheon!!!!!

Bar none, these are the best grits I have ever eaten. Living in the South, I have eaten many variations and have several grits recipes that I like. These were unparalleled and so scrumptious I wanted to eat all of them. I served a grilled chicken breast on top of the grits and garnished them with cilantro. I accompanied the chicken and grits with grilled eggplant and zucchini and served sliced, homegrown tomatoes for a salad. My husband says he thinks I should make Shrimp and Grits and use these ever so creamy grits instead of my regular recipe using cheddar cheese.

In Websters a "chili" is a pepper whether hot or sweet. Of course, as you suspected, Bon Appetis understands proper spelling and grammar.

Very easy, tasty and colorful. I don't particualrly like the flavor of hot pepper cheese in cooked dishes, so I used plain monterey jack and it was still great; would stand up against a spicy entree. Husband loved it!

This dish *is* as good as it sounds, and easy enough to make it into my weeknight rotation. I had imagined that it would be spicy, but it's really more savory -- and that way it can stand up to highly spiced sauces, marinated grilled meats and such.

For heaven's sake, ChefP, writing "I don't mean to go off on a rant" doesn't excuse you writing the exact same thing about two (at least) different recipes. (See chicken mole with chipotles for a case of dejavu). If you can't wirte something helpful, no one wants to read it. Good bye!

This recipe does sound good, and I plan to make it in the future. I am writing because I have a comment on Chef P's self-righteous attitude regarding "chile" vs. "chili". If you are going to rant about proper usage and spelling of a word, why don't you learn how to spell "purist"? Just a suggestion...

I haven't made this recipe yet, it looks pretty good though. This is a comment on the use of the word "chili" and "chilies". I am a chef born and raised in the Southwest. It is CHILE or CHILES. Chili is the tex-mex dish made with chili powder and beef, sometimes beans (although not if you are a chili purest). I don't mean to get off on a rant here, but if you are going to write recipes for Mexican and Southwestern dishes at least have the common courtesy to spell the ingredients correctly. I know that this is sometimes accepted, but that is by people who frankly do not know any better. We would never write fwa graw, or bree, so lets not bastardize the Mexican and Southwestern cuisine ingredients. Thanks, Chef P
