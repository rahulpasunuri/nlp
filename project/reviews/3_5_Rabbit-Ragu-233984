Such an easy dish, everything was super easy to make. I basically just added the tomatoes, red wine and stock into a pot, mixed everything, and bung the vegetables in with the rabbit and slow cook it for 4 hours. Afterward I shred the meat of the bone, place it back in the ragu mix it and served with pappardelle pasta

Bought a whole rabbit at the farmer's market today, and so used an entire bottle of three-buck chuck to cook it down, rather than the 1 cup. Pulled the meat off the bone at the end, and bang. Dang good meal. Served with Bittman's polenta with more sage and rosemary and his Brussels sprouts with pancetta, walnuts and balsamic. Food coma.

I had a wild rabbit that was very lean, so I first did a slow braise at 275 degrees in red wine with the mirepoix. Then I made a ragu with garlic, tomatoes, carrots, celery, and fresh herbs, and then added the rabbit meat, which I shredded off the bone, along with the reduced wine from the braise and as much of the braising vegetables as I could force through a fine sieve. The wild rabbit is slightly gamey and the ragu is exceptionally flavrful. Great recipe! Will serve with polenta or fresh pasta tonight.

This made a delicious Easter Buffet item. Good luck getting a butcher to bone a rabbit! I just cooked the meat on the bone and pulled the meat off after it was cooked and shredded it, alot of work but my guests were ecstatic. Went well with the Polenta.

Fabulous recipe. Our rabbit was whole and we cut it up the best we could and then decided to put the rest of the pieces in on the bone. I think it added more flavor. I cooked it longer until the meat fell off the bone and served it over creamy polenta and with brussel sprout with pine nuts and marjoram from this site. A wonderful meal. Would be great in a crock pot!

Exceptional. I didn't have bacon, so used a smoked paprika to give it the smokiness it needed. Wonderful recipe and versatile (I didn't have sage or rosemary), but still delicious. Easy way to impress. Went wonderfully over thin spaghetti and pared with a light pinot noir.

Amazing, delicious, absolute repeat. changes? I used guanciale instead of pancetta, because i had some. I added the rabbit liver for additional earthy taste. I added the aromatics (celery, carrot, onion) after the guanciale rendered and then I pulled it to the side when the onion was soft and added the rabbit. I used about 20 ounces of tomato since i had opened a 28 ounce can. I used a bold chewy, Wolftrap, a South African Mourvedre Viognier. And I added 2 fresh bay leaves. made it in the afternoon, shut it off and let it mingle and then reheated it for dinner with hand made pappardelle. Seriously good and an absolute repeater!

This was a delicious dish...didn't change a thing. I'm lucky to have all the fresh rabbit, herbs etc. right at my fingertips.

Delicious - a lovely warming dish. Like others, used chicken thighs (which took longer to cook)and regular bacon, but, other than that, followed the recipe. I served this with Creamy Baked Polenta with Herbs and Green Onions from this website.

I used this as an appetizer. I cut everything into smaller pieces and then spooning the ragu into premade phyllo cups. I placed a small piece of dubliner cheese on top and baked for 5 minutes at 350 degrees to melt the cheese. It was a big hit for our regular dinner club crowd.

Great basic recipe. I love rabbit but couldn't find any locally, so I too made it with chicken thighs. Used regular bacon instead of pancetta and dried herbs instead of fresh (halved the amount). I also added a few chopped crimini mushrooms and a bay leaf, then thickened it with a little flour.

I made the recipe with veal shoulder instead and followed those instructions. A very delicious hearty dish.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I used it as a filling for a gougere (kind of like a popover that goes around the edge of a casserole). I'd definitely make it again.

Made this with chicken thighs instead of rabbit (just can't do the rabbit thing), and added sliced black olives and a bay leaf -- it was lovely. Simple and delicious, I'll definitely make this again.

I'm always on the lookout for rabbit recipes and this one was very easy -- and made a nice change of pace from my usual winter stew repertoire. Served with polenta and baby brussel sprouts -- and everyone wanted seconds.
