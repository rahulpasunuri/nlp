Excellnt dessert. I microwaved the chocolate with the steeped cream as some of the other reviews did, doubled the pepper, and because I wanted a more floofy texture, folded another cup of so of whipping cream that I had beat with a touch more sugar. I was very happy with the results of that, as it made the dessert even airier and more mousse-like. Also couldn't resist throwing in a tablespoon or so of drambuie, it was just calling for some liquor and it was spot on. Fabulous recipe.

Simply delicious - I added dusted coffee powder on to the whipped cream to decorate.

Incredibly good -- and very easy. I used Telicherry peppercorns because I didn't have Sichuan, but will use them next time. And decaf coffee, a little more than called for, and a little more sugar than called for. Wow!

This recipe is amazing. I took other reviewer suggestions, doubling the pepper and microwaving the chocolate. It turned out perfectly. I will without a doubt be making this again.

Always comes out amazing. Replaced sichuan peppercorns with chile powder once when they weren't available and it was just as amazing.

Easy and delicious! I've used instant coffee powder (1 tbsp) instead of ground coffee, and followed lotusmoss' review, 1/2 tbsp of the sichuan pepper powder, for a more exquisite touch.

This was amazing, easy, and delicious. I substituted sichuan for normal pepper and it worked great. Great recipe.

This was excellent and very easy to make! i brought them for a dinner party, and everyone loved them. Added some fresh whipped cream and a few blackberries on top, which added a nice contrasting flavor. couldn't find the sezchuan peppercorns, so just used black pepper, which added a nice spice to it.

I followed the directions scrupulously, and it turned out grainy and hard. The peppercorns were undetectable.

I doubled the recipe and used a very heaping 1/2 tsp. of ground Sichuan for the recipe. It worked beautifully and everyone at our NYE dinner party loved the flavor. A nice change from the typical mousse. Instead of melting the chocolate over a hot water bath (a pain in the butt, if you ask me), I added a few TB. of the steeped cream to the chopped chocolate and nuked it at 50% in the microwave for 10 second intervals until melted. Worked beautifully.

This is easy and delicious from what I can tell right after making it. I will be curious as to how the Sichuan pepper comes through after a thorough chilling.

Perfect.

Absolutely delicious. The only reason for not giving four forks is that the Sichuan pepper (which I bought for the recipe, and so I hope was still potent) did not come through at all. One left-over mousse was delicious two days later. A real keeper
