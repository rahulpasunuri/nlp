this is the 5th year that I have made this for Thanksgiving. I always increase the bacon and oysters in this. Everyone that tries this usually loves it.

I have been using this recipe every year since 1992 when it was in an issue of Gourmet. Yesterday, my 30 year old son called to ask for the recipe! I think that says it all.

This recipe has become my family's Thanksgiving Dinner favorite for the last 3 years. Surprisingly, no fishy taste--just moist! Shucking oysters took a little practice.

I used a mixture of ciabatta bread and onion rolls. My stock was packaged broth, which I enriched with chicken necks, carrots, onion, and celery. I think fresh sage is a must. My sister pronounced it perfect. Will make it for Christmas and plan to use gluten free bread this next time.

Wonderful dish. Double the oysters and use fresh herbs. For 6 people, I used 8 cups of bread crumbs (instead of 12) and only half the amount of butter. I kept the rest of the recipe as is--it was wonderful. This is a real keeper!

I made this dressing for Thanksgiving and was delighted with the results. Incorporating the suggestions of previous reviewers, I increased the amount of celery to two cups and doubled the amount of oysters. The resulting dish was absolutely delicious and a huge success with my guests. No more packaged dressings for me. This is my new standard recipe.

Since I prepared my 1st turkey in 1981 (yikes!), we've tried multiple recipes, & this is the best. It is less labor than our former favorite chestnut dressing, & everyone loves it so much we must double the recipe. In spite (or because?) of some 'mudifications', it is wonderful. Major change is addition of 8 cups of mixed wild mushrooms (sliced & sauted). I also dramatically increase fresh sage & parsley (prolific garden), omit the bacon, halve the butter & sub some olive oil, plus add all the oyster liquid. Whether stuffed inside the bird or baked alongside it, this is a terrific dressing.

Made this for Thanksgiving this year, and it was great! Better than the oyster dressing that we've had before, and even my grandparents (from Louisiana) loved it. I used less bread than the recipe called for -- or maybe my bread cubes were bigger so the cup measurements were off -- but I'll definitely make this one again.

I grew up with oyster stuffing on Thanksgiving so when it was time for me to host my own, I knew I had to have it. This recipe is fantastic and was a hit with my family. I think the bacon is a fantastic addition and really adds so much to the dish. I also had some leftover wild mushrooms and decided to sautee and add them to the mix. They added great flavor...will definitely be making this dish again next year!

Absolutely fantastic. Last night was my first experience making an oyster stuffing and I will definitely add this to my regular holiday rotation. I cheaped out and used Bumble Bee canned oysters and it was still fabulous.

I've made this stuffing ALMOST every single year since it was first published in 92. It is sublime. The only years I didn't make it were when I was traveling and didn't have access to oysters - those were the years my family and friends complained MIGHTILY: they all wanted this recipe back in the menu!

Very good-although in the future I would cut the bread smaller-it seemed like too much bread and not enough of the other stuff. I think I would also double the oysters-I will certainly try again!

it's a lot of work - but it's worth it! Will make it again for any excuse!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it came out very good. I was a little confused as to what type of bread to use (loaf or rolls)or what type of oysters to use(fresh or canned. I ended up buying a large loaf that weighed about 1 lb and buying 3 jared fresh oysters. Everyone raved about it so this will be a dish that I make every year now. :)

This too has become my standard dressing for Thanksgiving with turkey. As a Southerner I substituted homemade cornbread for the French bread and as a shellfish lover doubled the number of oysters.

Oyster dressing has always been a tradition in my family - passed down through generations - however, the old version is soggy, doughy, and full of whole oysters. This recipe dresses up the dish - makes it more interesting - and incorporates bacon which adds a smokiness that marries well with the oysters. This is our new tradition.

This has become part of our family's Thanksgiving tradition. Even the non-oyster lovers love it and the grandkids think it's "our stuffing." Make extra because it's better the next day.

This is hands down the best stuffing recipe out there. It was quickly integrated into our holiday traditions and I'm often asked to make it at other times as well. I always make a double batch for leftovers and I actually think it tastes better a day or two later.

My family LOVES this stuffing! Its actually the only stuffing I will eat! My sister is a vegetarian so we leave out the bacon and substitute the chicken broth for vegetable broth... Makes for a great vegetarian side dish! I completely recommend!

The oyster lovers in my family like this recipe a lot. We make it every year. This Thanksgiving I left the oysters whole instead of chopped. Some folks preferred it that way, most of us liked it better with the oysters chopped as directed. I added plain pork sausage, cooked and fat drained. That was a good addition people might want to try.

Excellent oyster stuffing recipe. Our new family standard for stuffing. Using fresh herbs and making the turkey gizzard stock are critical to it' success. Enjoy!

This recipe is the as close to my grandmothers pacific northwest stuffing as i can get. My husband from Missouri was a little nervous to try this because it had oysters in it, but now it is a family tradition! This recipe is so good that a land locked country boy and his family even love it. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!

This recipe is a tradition at my house - my family loves it so much that I don't actually have a choice! I cut the bread cubes a little smaller and use a little more celery. It's amazing and tastes fantastic every time.

Excellent recipe. Very flavorful and everyone loved it. This year's bird could not be stuffed, so had to find a replacement for my usual oyster stuffing recipe - this was even better. But be careful when considering how to prepare this if you only have one oven (and the turkey is in it). Used regular white bread and added twice as many oysters.

Not bad, but not especially good. There must be a better oyster stuffing, possibly involving cornbread. My search continues

My Grandmother made yster stuffing for as long as I can remember - I had the family in for Thanksgiving this year and this was pretty darn close to her recipe. Even the kids ate it (not knowing it had oysters in it). One note regarding the last review, you use day old bread or dry out bread cubes iin the oven, because it allows the bread to soak up more stock and flavorings than if it was fresh bread. I will be making this stuffing again!

Excellent. My family always asks me to make the dressing for Thanksgiving as I use an old family recipe everyone loves. This year I decided to make half of the dressing with oysters and looked for a recipe, finding this one. It is VERY similiar to my old family standby except for the oysters and use of fresh herbs (I used the same ones only dried). So I decided to make the whole batch from this recipe instead of half. Everyone raved with many commenting it was better than ever (I never told them about the oyesters and not one person knew what the new "secret" ingredient was). The oysters definetly add a layer of depth but do not overpower the other flavors. I do not bake my bread cubes (dry them out just to make them moist again??? this technique was developed as a way to preserve bread for later use and unless you want the crunch for a topping or something, skip that step). I also recommend Applewood smoked bacon, again it really enhances the flavors.

I found this dressing to be wonderful! I agree with the others that fresh herbs are essential! Just in case of too strong of an oyster taste...I soaked my oysters in milk for about 20 min. This will be a must have for next year!

Absolutely fabulous! You can taste the oysters, but as anyone who regularly eats them knows, they are not, nor should they ever be "fishy". They lend an incomparable richness and depth of flavor that cannot be matched. Fresh herbs also essential.

This was a very tasty stuffing for those that like oysters, which I do. Next time I will cut the french bread into smaller pieces as 3/4-inch cubes were a little too big and did not present as nicely as it could have.

I've been searching for the perfect stuffing recipe for 4 years now and after making this recipe for Thanksgiving...I'm still looking. It was good, but not anything special. And the addition of the oysters at $10.99 a pound made for an expensive let down.

This stuffing was awesome, it does not taste fishy at all. I used thick cut hickory smoked bacon. The dressing had a wonderful smokey flavor!!

made this for thanksgiving and it was delicious! it was perfect as it was but portions can be modified for your taste or to make it a bit healthier. for example olive oil can be replaced for the stick of butter and the bacon fat. be sure to drain the oysters well so it doesn't taste too fishy. and go for the fresh herbs instead of dried.

Great recipe. I'll definitely make it again, but most likely put more oysters than 3/4 cup.

I cut the bacon in half and felt it still overpowered the dish. Next time I will make it without the bacon.

This is the BEST all purpose stuffing you could want to make! The ingredients are easy to find, and you don't have to be exact....we all loved the rich depth of flavor!

This was excellent. I may try substituting 1/4 cup oil for the bacon and grease and add 1/2 pound mushrooms to sauteed vegtables. This will probably become my standard stuffing.

So, so, good! I wouldn't change a thing! Make sure that you use fresh herbs. Very moist unlike most stuffings.

Made this for a large group at Thanksgiving and it was a huge success-so good that there was none left and we made it again to eat with leftovers! The combination of herbs and oysters were great and the proportions were just right-wouldn't change a thing.
