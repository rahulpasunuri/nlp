love this recipe, on the menu for ThxGiving but using Sausage rather than ham. Trick for re-heat is to put it in a small skillet, perhaps with your leftover stuffing, and add a couple tbspns water and cover, rather than the microwave. Works perfectly. Cut the corn closer to the cob and it reduces the mess, plus you get all the wonderful sugars and texture of the meal. Will follow up with the "Sausage" menu results - Happy Turkey Day!

I really enjoyed this - as always I made adjustments to suit my tastes as everyone should. Perfect texture, great combo of flavors, easy. Would be a good way to reinvent leftovers. As mentioned in recipe - will not reheat - curdles.

My husband made this last night for dinner. He used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream or milk. It was a little runny from the 1/2 and 1/2 but the flavor was really, realy good. He made a mess grating the corn,lots of clean up but we will definitely be serving this again.
