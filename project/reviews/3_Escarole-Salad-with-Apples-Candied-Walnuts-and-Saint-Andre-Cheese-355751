This salad was a major disappointment. I rated it two stars because it was edible, but it wasn't tasty. The best thing about it was the Saint Andre cheese and the candied walnuts, which would have been better served alone as hors d'oeuvres with a glass of wine. The escarole and radicchio were a bit too bitter and the apple got soggy and cold while it was sitting on the plates waiting for the rest of the salad.
