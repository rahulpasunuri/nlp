I have had rave reviews for this recipe. I have even made it without the husks - still good! The husks make it look great for the presentation, but were not easy to assemble. The first time I made this, it needed much more than 45 minutes - still bloody inside. The next time, I made the pieces smaller and had more husks to fill. This is a keeper!

Although you can cook the pork without the corn husks, cooking with them will give you a nicer presentation. The dish is delicious and comes out very tender. This is a must repeat recipe.

The pork with the corn husks had such a nice flavor. I wouldn't go without. I've made this recipe twice, and although the cranberry salsa is good, it's too much. The pork is delicious without.

Excellent Recipe, Suggestions for a quicker version and smaller amount would be to slice the tenderloins into desired thickness and only use the amount desired, then rubbing all sides of the filet. Infuse with a fork for faster marinating.

I left out the corn husks and grilled the tenderloins as suggested by another cook...It came out tender and delicious. I was a bit leary of athe combination of roasted sweet pepper, avacado and cranberries for the salsa but I did it all (I only had a red pepper but it worked well). I used dried reconstituted cranberries that were presweetened and left out all that sugar. I was surprised at how much everyone enjoyed this salsa with the pork, it was yummy. Only problem is that as someone else warned, the recipe makes way too much salsa. Halve it and you will still be fine.

I made this last weekend for some friends. Everyone loved it, even their 2 1/2 year old and my 18 month old! The pork was extremely juicy, even though I overcooked it a bit (at 30 min it was 160!). I especially liked that everything could be done ahead, so I could spend time with our guests. I served with the Southwestern Corn pudding (excellent) and green bean with carrots.

I have to agree with San Francisco's comment. I thought the pork was good but nothing fantastic. Yes, the salsa was good and gave a "holiday taste" to the dish, but I was expecting more. I served it at a dinner party and didn't think it was a 'WOW' dish. Probably will try other recipes before I make this one again.

Great contrast between the pork and the salsa. I didn't have time to find the corn husks so just roasted the pork without. It turned out fantastic! Makes a lot of salsa.

I have made this recipe three times and each time it is fantastic. I could not find frozen or fresh cranberries so I used dried cranberries and soaked them in hot water. This recipe is a lot of work, but 90% can be done ahead. The pork is best if marinated over night. Enjoy

At first, I was intimidated by this recipe. I am not from the southwest and have never used corn husks, but the whole process was very easy. I don't have a spice grinder, so I ground the coriander, pepper and cumin in my mouli grinder. Worked fine. I marinated the pork and let the corn husks soak all day so it was ready to cook when I got home from work. The pork was extremely tender and juicy with just the right amount of spice. I did make one small change to the salsa. I cooked the cranberries, orange juice, and sugar for about three minutes and then added the avocados. I served it with the Southwester Corn Pudding (a lot of work, but great.) My family said I was a 4 star chef. It doesn't get better than that.

For ease of preparation, this dish can't be beat. It was so nice to have a dinner party main dish that allowed me to actually hang out with my guests instead of in the kitchen. That said, it was a little hard to gage the "doneness" of each of the tenderloins. I also wasn't that happy with the color; I think I will use the grill next time. Great flavor, the salsa was perfect.

I really thought I was going to like this recipe, but it wasn't that great. It really just tasted like pork tenderloin with spices rubbed all over it, rather than pork with good flavor from the spices, if that makes any sense. I did let it sit overnight, which I thought would help the flavor infuse, but to no avail. Oh well.

This recipe was very good but I think next time I will grill the tenderloin rather than using the corn husks. We loved the cranberry salsa and the corn pudding with the pork. The stuffed peppers were perfect to start with. Very nice presentation for the whole menu.

A new favorite for us! We started with the stuffed peppers and had the corn pudding with the pork. I was surprised to find corn husks in our grocery store, but was very glad I did -- they kept the pork very moist.

This recipe is absolutely fabulous! It looks beautiful and the taste is unbelievable. I recomend following the recipe.Everyone loved the southwestern corn pudding. I would serve it again!

After enjoying the cheese and shrimp stuffed poblano peppers as the starter to the southwestern menu, this dish was anticlimactic. It's not bad, it just didn't dazzle us. Because the pork was cooked inside the corn husks, it took on a rather unappetizing hue. The spice rub is good. Next time I'd skip the entire corn husk step and just use whole pork tenderloins. The cranberry avacado salsa is good but the cranberry completely overpowered the roasted yellow pepper and avacado so it really wasn't worth the effort.

Made the whole menu ten days before Christmas and everyone raved about it so did it again on Christmas. It is definately a keeper, especially for us in Arizona who love southwest flavors.

I prepared the entire Southwestern Meal from the 2002 Bon Appetit issue. This is the first time I have used an entire meal suggestion. I always want to change something. Not in this case everything was delicious. Also, most of the work was done the day before. I was able to really enjoy the day with my family. In lieu of corn husks I did substitute banana leaves. This meal will become a holiday tradition.

The pork was good, especially with the cranberry/avacado salsa. The seasoning/rub for the pork was excellent and simple to prepare. We put the pork in a large zip-lock bag and added the seasoning, and marinated overnight. This was the first time we wrapped anything in husks, but it was actually pretty simple and fun! Excellent results. I took the pork out of the oven when the instant temperature read 150 degrees, but by the time I had unwrapped and plated everything, but pork seemed a little overdone. Not bad, but next time I'll take it out a little earlier and let it rest to the desired doneness. The salsa, in our opinion, made the dish! Without it, the pork might not have been as remarkable. We put everything but the avacado & cilantro in ahead of time, and just added these final ingredients immediately before serving and it looked fresh and bright! Overall, very good. Our guests loved it and wanted the recipe. I'd definitely make it again.

This was a wonderful recipe - I did make a big change though - my family does not eat pork so I used boneless skinless chicken thighs in place of the pork tenderloin. 2 small thighs were perfect. I actually made the whole meal except for substituting my own cornbread and all my guests raved!

This was so good. I made a whole tenderloin for my husband and me and took the leftovers to a tailgate the next day. Everyone wanted the recipe. I think the corn husks are key. Next time, I will try making the whole tenderloin in a corn husk lined dish.

This recipe is fabulous! It was very easy and the pork was incredibly moist and juicy. I served it with the recommended cranberry/avocado salsa, which was terrific! However, the pork is fantastic even without the salsa.
