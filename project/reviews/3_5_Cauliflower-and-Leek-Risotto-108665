I made as written and didn't care for the taste or texture of this recipe. If I made it again I would roast the cauliflower and serve on top of the risotto.

For those who think this is a bland dish, consider it as a side dish with a spicy or flavorful italian sausage, almost like you would a polenta. I added a small amount of saffron and paprika to excite the color. As such, it was a hit. There is nothing wrong with a mild, but sublime risotto.

This was delicious. What a great and different way to eat cauliflower. Because I am a vegetarian, I substituted veggie stock for the chicken stock and added just a touch of white wine, but other than that made it as directed. So much flavor with so few ingredients. I will definitely make this again.

Very nice - with - some minor adjustments: First I saute 1/2 cup sweet onion and the cauliflower for 3 minutes in equal amounts of butter and olive oil... then I add the rice and saute for 2 minutes... next I add 1/2 cup of white wine to "season the rice" as Julia Childs used to say ... then I add chicken stock and cook as the recipe reads from there. Another delightful staple in our regular risotto routine.

Very nice and simple dish. I added chopped mushrooms at the saute stage which added some extra flavor. Served it with pan fried cod loin.

this was good, but really the leek and cauliflower don't have enough flavor to make it a keeper. At the last minute I threw in some sausage which helped. I might also try roasting the cauliflower separately with garlic or something to give it more flavor. but really I will probably just go back to my standard asparagus and walnuts.

I did this recipe many times with a lot of success. I had concerns initially that the cauliflower would not be cooked enough but it ends up being perfect everytime.

This was my first time making risotto. I think it turned out well. I adapted it a bit. I used chicken BROTH, Arborio rice & grated parmesan cheese.

Subbed vegetable bouillon for chicken broth, otherwise followed recipe. Bland/flat result was probably a consequence of this shortcut. We liked the cauliflower and leek, though.

Unlike most here, I made this as a side dish to go with pork tenderloin medallions in a green peppercorn, mustard cream sauce. I agree with the reviewer that said it was very white, and followed the suggestion to garnish it with chopped parsley and roasted red pepper pieces. It was a HUGE hit with friends who used to own the best gourmet restaurant in the area - high praise indeed! The only change I made was to reduce the amount of cauliflower - 2 lbs. (4 cups) is a lot - I used 3 cups and it was perfect.

Very good, though time consuming. Homemade chicken stock is a must. The cauliflower stays nice and firm, and the leeks and parmigiano are perfect.

This was fantastic! I used veggie broth cubes instead of chicken, and added half a cup of dry white wine before I started adding the broth. I also added a scoop of truffle pate at the end. It was so creamy I didn't even add the parm, though my husband did and he said that was equally good.

Found a leek, cauliflower and fresh chicken stock in the fridge and made this recipe. Risotto was fabulous with wonderful taste. Cauliflower still firm, not overcooked. Paired with a little salad with basil dressing and it was dinner for 3 people. Lovely.

Very simple and tasty. A nice hearty meal for fall and winter. Because it ends up being mostly cauliflower, it doesn't make you feel as overfull as some other risottos will.

this is so simple and really wonderful. I took the advice of using garlic powder instead of fresh, which i rarely switch-- great. I also added some cumin to give it a nutty, savory flavor and that really turned the dish into something special. highly recommended!

I definitely agree that it was bland bland bland until the adding the cheese and salt at the end. Even then, it wasn't as flavorful as I'd hoped. But good.

This dish was pretty good, but a little on the bland side for my taste. You can't really taste the leeks and cauliflower doesn't have a strong taste. Also, too WHITE! It could probably use some herbs to jazz it up a bit.

I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. It was delicious.

This risotto was FABULOUS. It tasted deceptively unspectacular during the cooking but blossomed at the end with the addition of the salt, parmesan and a bit of black pepper. I used half of a good-sized cauliflower and regular Arborio rice.

I love this risotto and a delicious preparation for cauliflower.

This was very good, but we were slightly disappointed after anticipating blow-you-away wonderful. The only reason I wouldn't make this particular recipe again is that we have a couple of other risotto recipes we like better, including truffle risotto. This was a nice change though, and we enjoyed it. About the instuctions, I always chop the leeks before washing, as a time-saver and because they get much cleaner that way.

This was "blow-you-away" wonderful. I made it with an extremely fresh cauliflower from our local farmers' market. It probably wouldn't taste as good with supermarket cauliflower--but I'd still use it if that was all that was available. I made it in a pressure cooker using 1/3 cup dry white wine and 1 1/3 cup chicken stock diluted with 1/3 cup water. I added 2 teaspoons of coarse salt--it needs it--maybe even a bit more. It also needs a bit of color. Garnish with some chopped parsley and steamed julienned red bell pepper.

The proper way to way a leek is to split it down the side, top to bottom. Then rinse out the sand. They can be very sandy! I'd guess from this recipe if you finely chop and then rinse it may be quicker.

I can't wait to try this recipe. Since it says to drain in a sieve I would take that to mean you chop the vegetables first. However, I will probably chop them afterward.

Anybody else a little confused with the instructions? The ingredients list refers to finely chopped leek, but the first step in the instructions are to wash the leek, which I've always done when the leek is still WHOLE. So, do you think I should blanche first, them chop the vegetables or chop, then blanche?
