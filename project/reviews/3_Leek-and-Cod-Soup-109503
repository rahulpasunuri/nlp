I used roasted cubes of butternut squash instead of pumpkin and 2 sweet potatoes instead of 4 regular potatoes. Also added some cumin and paprika as I like spice. And used half water, half clam broth, with 1/2 c dry white wine. I guess I really didn't make this recipe but it gave me a nice base on which to build a soup of my own that I really liked!

A keeper, definitely. Substituted pumpkin for half a cup of cooked white beans and added 4tbsp of white wine, a dash of paprika and one handful of chopped parsley before serving. Very good.
