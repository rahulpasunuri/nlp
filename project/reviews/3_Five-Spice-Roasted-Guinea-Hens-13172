Made with a whole roasting chicken. Used pastry brush to brush the chicken with the oil and five spice powder. The sauce was really wonderful. I had some problems when I added the corn starch, though (it congealed), so I may try a slurry of flour next time. My seven-year-old son loved it and just asked if there were leftovers he could eat tonight. Will definitely make this again.

I was very disappointed by this dish and don't understand the high rates of previous reviewers. I found it very grainy, sandy almost, because of the 5 spice powder coating and it tasted and smelled like the food of the Chinese take away shop on the corner. Not special at all.

Big hit. I thickened with flour instead of cornstarch and it worked well.

This dish pleased everyone, from a picky ten-year-old to a guest from Shanghai. Our local farm had fresh guinea hens, I had all the ingredients (but substituted fresh beets and their greens on the side for the broccoli rabe), and the result was excellent!
