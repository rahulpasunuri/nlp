Great recipe! this recipe was very easy to make and a great way to use bulgar. Simple, rich, delicious, and a great substitute for risotto!

This is delicious and easy. I made it with the chicken broth. The chile flakes add just a bit of heat to give it an unexpected punch. My husband loved it, so I'll be making it again next week.

Quite Good - a great, hearty winter dinner! I made it with water and it wasn't as creamy as I'd hoped - I'll try broth next time.

I really like this dish! I used fine bulgur (that's all I had) and just reduced the cooking time a little bit. Also, I used two small canned roma tomatoes instead of one large fresh one, and paprika instead of the ground Aleppo. Served with roasted asparagus, it was great!

Yummy comfort food. Tastes rich and creamy, as if there's dairy in it, but without the feta it made a great vegan side dish. Grating the tomato seemed strange to me, but it actually was easy and worked out quite well.

This is a wonderful dish... with fantastic flavours. I think it is even more fantastic, however with the addition of two things. I grilled two pesto coated chicken breasts and cut them up to throw in the pot and also roasted a medium sized eggplant without the skin and threw that in as well. The one drawback to this dish is the presentation... it looks a bit gloopy and I don't think I would serve it at a dinner party for this reason. As far as flavour is concerned, however, it is a four forker... the feta cheese transforms it.

My husband & I enjoyed this one = esp with the grilled squash on top. Creamy with subtle tomato tastes.

Really terrific--simple, creamy, and comforting. I made this dish last night, and all morning I have been thinking about how good it was.

Delicious. Kids asked for seconds. It was easy to make. What more could you ask for?

Very simple and good recipe. I served sauteed yellow and green squash and served over bulgur. Makes an excellent summer time meal.

Yummy hot, straight from the pot. Can't stop eating it-real comfort food. I think using a good quality Greek feta is a must. Stirred in an additional diced tomato and some chopped fresh mint at the end. Can you tell I loved it?

This was exactly what I hoped for - fast, easy, and filling - a great alternative to risotto for sure! The most time consuming part of this recipe was grating the tomato. Next time I would like to see what happens if I don't grate - that would halve the time I spent on this recipe.

Wonderful! This is a great side dish with anything grilled; it tastes of summer. I use regular dried chile flakes and chicken stock. I don't think this would work with winter tomatoes, but it's one of our summer favorites.

Nice dish, added chopped red pepper for colour. but what is Aleppo? It's not in the epicurious dictionary. I added dried basil ???

I didn't care for the combination of textures/flavors in this recipe. I like bulgar, but I didn't find it to be a good match with the feta cheese.

I LOVED this! The cheese makes it so creamy. I used one small dried pepper and the spice wa s just right. I am eating the leftovers as I write and I can't wait to make it again!

This dish was very tatsy, and my husband loved it. I really liked it, too. I wouldn't put it on my list of favorite things to eat, though. It's a very good vergetartian dish, and it is very filling. It is quite spicy, so I might cut back on the red pepper. A very satisfying dish.

Love this recipe, used less oil and feta and placed on a bed of lettuce.
