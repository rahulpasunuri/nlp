I used Blue Cheese and it was delicious on the burger!

Fabulous upgrade for burgers. My husband raves about this recipe.

I've made this dish several times following the recipe exactly. I once used Maytag Blue cheese instead of the roq. This is a great recipe, and it makes an outrageous burger.

In a pinch just used pre-packaged, crumbled bleu cheese. Huge hit with the husband and family.

Flavor was ok, but the consistency was not. Very thin.

Very good. Used Gorgonzola cheese which is alittle milder than Roquefort and we really enjoyed it. I served with an avocado salad dressed with balsamic vinegar and extra virgin oil and it was especially good with that.

Add a couple of slices of crispy bacon and it is perfect! I did cut down on the cheese a little as we were serving little ones too.

These hamburgers were outrageous. The roquefort mayonnaise is what really makes them, and the red onion is much better than I'd thought it would be -- sweet and mild. Made it for a cookout, and even my kids liked it!

This is fabulous and easy. And a real hit if you have blue cheese lovers. The purple onion tops it off nicely.

I love these hamburgers, the cheese is strong for me but I simply cut down on the cheese and add roasted garlic to it...yummy.

I was skeptical that the sweetness of bbq'd onions would complement the strong flavor of roquefort on a burger. In fact, it was one of the best burgers I ever had, due largely to the mayo.

I enjoyed this mayonnaise. It's excellent on burgers and very good on grilled boneless chicken breast sandwich!
