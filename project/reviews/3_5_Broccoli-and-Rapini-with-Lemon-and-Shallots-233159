Ellen, you're right. half of the amount of butter you mentioned would be just right. Especially since the recipe says so. Duh.

I'm not a big broccoli fan and this recipe was good. The lemon sets off the flavor of the broccoli nicely. This was fairly fast and easy too. I will add this to my regular set of recipes.

This recipe is very good as written, nice change to just plain steaming. To Ellen in Washington, it isn't fair to review a recipe that you have not prepared, especially when you base your review on incorrect information. The recipe did not call for one cup of butter; it called for 1/2 cup.

I'm sure this is delicious, but one cup of butter is waaaaaaaaay too much butter. If it needs greasing, use some evoo, but I am sure that half as much would be just fine.

I just tried a modified version of this but with less butter (mixed with a little olive oil), actually, what i did was make a lemon garlic ginger sauce to pour over the cooked broccoli. (Had no rapini so didn't do that part) I got this recipe for the sauce from the net, but the one thing i didn't have was sherry. (It would be great to make it with sherry.): Lemon Ginger Sauce: 1 tbsp fresh lemon juice 1 tbsp slivered ginger root 2 tbsp honey 1 clove garlic minced 1 tbsp dry sherry 1 tsp cornstarch

When I saw this recipe I was surprised that it didn't call for parboiling the rapini before sauteeing, as all the other recipes I reviewed did. Thought I'd give it a try anyway as I'd never cooked rapini (aka broccoli rabe) before. Mistake! -- too crunchy, not mellow enough. I will not be making this dish again, at least as directed.

I love love love this recipe. It is quick and delicious. What more could you ask for. When I don't have a lot of time, I skip the grated lemon peel and just squeeze a little lemon juice instead.

This was a delicious dish, even though I substituted a Vidalia onion for the shallots. I also squeezed some lemon juice on top as other reviewers suggested. It was, however (dare I say?), just a little too much butter for me. Might try to cut back to 4 - 6 tablespoons next time. Otherwise a staple side dish.

I didn't think this was anything special. The mix of broccoli and rapini is good, but I found the lemon/shallot mixture too bland. If I make it again I'll try a squeeze of lemon to brighten it up, or maybe a good shot of garlic.

Made this with baby broccoli and broccoli rabe. Delicious! Loved the mixture of flavors.

I sprinkled just a tiny bit of lemon juice on this before serving and it tasted great.

Great vegetable dish, (if you enjoy rapini). Made it for a dinner party and unfortunately there was no leftovers for me the following day.

This has become a staple in our house. Often I just use broccoli, Rabe is not always easy to find locally and can be expesive.......but the shallots and lemon compliment many dishes. Love it!

The lemon and shallots were good flavors for the rapini, and the broccoli gave the dish a nice texture where rapini alone would have been more like greens. They're not kidding about the very large skillet...I did two batches of each veg in an 8-inch. Reheated beautifully, too.
