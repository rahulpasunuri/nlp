My favorite salad! Wonderful blend of flavors, and textures. It has everything - sweet, cool, bitter, pepper, salt.... Great way 6to impress dinner guests with minimal effort.

This has become my "go to" salad recently. The flavors work so well together. It also looks great with the green and red for the holidays. The only substitution I make is I usually use a mesclun lettuce mix instead of all arugula. Also, I've added shaved Parmesan to it, but it really doesn't need it.

Loved this salad. Great balance of flavors (sweet, salty, nutty, tangy) and textures. I enjoyed the dressing as well.

Delicious - to get pomegranate seeds out easily - follow Nigella Lawson's tip and cut in half - hold over a large bowl and thwack the pomegranate with a rolling pin - keep gently thwacking until the seeds start to release - they will fall into the bowl as if by magic!

This was pretty and tasty and I especially liked the bites with pomegranate in them. The prosciutto balanced out well with the other flavours.

I substituted leeks for the fennel, as I don't like fennel, and absolutely loved this salad. Elegant, beautiful, and the mixture of flavors was fabulous.

Love it! Easy, stylish and delicious. Flavours speak for themselves. Guests raved. I admit however, to being so seduced by the look of a box of perfect poms at an italian market that I actually paid AU$8 just for one! The price was enough to heed the advice of other reviewers and patiently learn the art of gently removing each segment of juicy seed bubbles. Entirely worth it.

Um, oops! I just came online to review & realized I totally forgot the fennel. I did just the mint, arugula, pom seeds & prosciutto & it turned out delish. Instead of balsamic, I mixed lemon juice, olive oil, salt & pepper together and everyone loved it! Next time I'll do the fennel. My friend who is a chef helped get the pom seeds out: split pom in half turn seeds facing down toward salad bang pom with a large serving spoon seeds fall out!

A definite keeper. Getting the pomegranate seeds out is a pain but make the salad worth it. I would give this recipe a "10".

This salad rocks my world. We had a friend over for dinner who told us repeatedly and then again the next day how it was the best salad she ever had!

I was not very impressed by this salad. None of the ingredients complimented each other. It all just tasted like exactly what it was: pomegranate seeds, fennel, lettuce, and prosciutto. I agree with the other reviewer that the dressing was also lacking.

I loved this salad - such a great combination of flavors, very simple, yet bold, a perfect start to a dinner party. Wear an apron though! The pom juice will stain whatever it touches.

This salad was very good. The dressing could have used a little more flavor. The sweet/tartness of the pomegranate seeds went really well with the saltiness of the prosciutto. Both my husband and I really liked it.

We really enjoyed this. It was a nice combination of flavors. If you've never de-seeded a pomegranate before, it's really fun. :) If you want to know what to do, check out: http://www.elise.com/recipes/archives/004100how_to_cut_and_deseed_a_pomegranate.php

Fabulous and refreshing, however cut the pomegranate under water or you and your cupboards will be wearing red. I used Romaine for arugula and had no fennel and it was still fab. Will make again!
