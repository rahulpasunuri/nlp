Nice guilt free sauce. Added 1/4 tsp ground cumin. Served over skinless chicken cutlets that were charcoal grilled. Very healthy until I added melted cheddar and jack cheese. Makes a lot. Going to try in mashed potatoes and this would be a good sauce over chicken and cheese enchiladas.

This sauce is awesome! I added cilantro and did not remove all of the charred skin from the chiles which gave it a nice smokey flavor and added texture. This sauce would work well with alot of dishes!

Great sauce!! Light and tasty. Perfect compliment to the cilantro-stuffed chicken!!
