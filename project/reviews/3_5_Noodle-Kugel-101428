I rarely follow recipes exactly, but I did this one. It was absolutely delicious -- sweet without being overpowering, soft and crunchy. The apples slices were a wonderful treat. This is a true comfort food, but for special occasions. I highly recommend it.

I lost my "perfect"' kugel recipe... and I'm so insecure! This sounds like the closest to "mine" but I swear I don't remember the cottage cheese. But the apples and golden raisins sound on target - Phew- glad I found this!

This recipe was delicious! I will be making it again very soon.

Fantastic. I made this for the first time several years ago and it's my only kugel recipe. My boyfriend swore that he couldn't stand eating kugel and then had like 3 pieces of this... and with good reason. I love kugel and this is one of the best.

Yummy, I also cut down the amount of butter because it looked like too much when I poured it in the batter. I am glad I did because the flavor of the apples and raisins really came through I am sure it would be just as good with the full amount.

I actually did make this for Passover this year by using Passover noodles made from potato starch (those allergic to wheat, please take note!). Delish. Even my nephew who doesn't like anything with pasta loved it. I made it again using egg substitute and yolk free noodles, and cut way down on the butter. Still used real sour cream. Very rich and creamy, and my family hardly noticed a difference.

So the Not a Noodle Kugel kind of guy said it was "okay" and I watched him eat a couple of servings. I have to agree that it was good but next time I will try to keep to the recipe as close as I can. Or maybe try another recipe

My first ever noodle kugel is in the oven now. I cut back on the sugar, used ricotta cheese and used 1/8 tsp of french vanilla extract instead of 1 tsp vanilla. I used apple pie filling chopped, crushed pineapple and diced apricots. As I was pouring it into the baking dish, I stole a taste. Very comforting, very creamy and I can't wait to taste it cooked! I still have to get it past my "not a noodle kugel kind of guy" husband. I'll let you know what he thinks!

Really creamy and delicious. I was much more generous with the cinnamon that the recipe and I grated the apple instead of slicing it. I also covered it with foil part of the time so it wouldn't dry out. Everyone loved it.

Delicious! I used 12 ounces of noodles instead of 8, and I liked the consistency it came out.

This recipe should not be included in Passover recipes as it is made with noodles!

This is now my one and only basic noodle kugel recipe, no others are needed. I made it as written the first time. Very very good. The second time I tweaked it a bit, and found it outstanding. Some tweaks were merely to increase the number of portions. Increased noodles to 12 oz of wide noodles (one standard package). Proportionally increased to 1.5 pounds cottage cheese, 1.5 cups sour cream, 4 eggs, 1/2 tsp cinnamon (or more, to taste), 1 tsp vanilla (unchanged) 1 stick butter (unchanged) and a scant 3/4 cup sugar. Instead of the apples, the 2nd time, I used one 20 oz can of crushed pineapple, drained and squeezed dry and I topped the kugel with sweetened grated coconut--a sort of pina colada kugel, but with subtle flavors. Allowing it to come to almost room temperature makes it very easy to cut and serve neat portions. You can always reheat the cut portions slightly, in a microwave, if you want it hotter. This can be made ahead and refrigerated, but it dries out a bit, so if reheating in a regular oven, drizzle a bit more melted butter over the top (half a stick, melted), and cover it with foil. Reheat in a slow over, 300.

Increased noodles to 12 oz. and this seemed like a good balance.

I made this with fresh Chinese egg noodles, because I love their chewy texture. Left out apples, raisins, and pineapple, but served with berries on the side as a wonderfully comforting breakfast.

I made this dish for a hanukah party for my mostly non-jewish friends. I am a college student so do not have a lot of cooking experience but this easy and delicious! I made it with low fat cottage cheese/sour cream and splenda! Yum, even my pickiest eater roomate made everyone else try it because she loved it so much. I will make this again, because as another guest said "with this food, your on your way to being a great jewish mom!)

Excellent Dish! To the Cook from San Francisco... Noodle Kugel at a Passover Seder? Sorry dear, but this is about as far from a Passover dish as one can get. You might as well have served ham and swiss on white bread with mayonnaise!

I didn't add the apples, but this was very good. A little too sweet for the meal, but moreso as a dessert.

This is one of the best Kugel's I've had. They are generally dry, but not this one. I made it for a brunch and everyone raved!!!

I have never tasted or made kugel in my life, but had noodles and sour cream and wanted to try something different. I know my family likes stuff sweet, so I doubled the sugar and omitted the cheese and butter (who needs all that extra fat). I used a pear instead of an apple and the flavor was wonderful. Unfortunately, my kids took one look at it, and no matter how hard I tried to convince them it was sweet like pudding, they just could not deal w/ the look of it--browned, hard noodles on top. So now I have enough for a small army,hope it freezes well. I liked it okay, but would rather take the same ingredients and make a delicious bread pudding. The noodles didn't do it for me either.

Served this at our Passover seder and it was delicious! Made a few modifications: used a 12 oz bag of noodles; used half granulated, half brown sugar; and was a bit more generous with the cinnamon. Would definitely make this again.

I think the last reviewer may have too high a regard for authority figures; let's keep on telling each other how we might improve on recipes...we all have a lot to learn from each other. This kugel was excellent comfort food. We too used 12 oz. noodles; otherwise it's a lot of work for too little food. We used no-yolk, as we watch the cholesterol, and they were great. Also used the half raisin/half apricot mixture, lemon zest, ricotta instead of cottage, about a quarter-cup brown sugar and a quarter-cup white, as well as fat-free sour cream. Forgot the vanilla but didn't miss it a bit. This recipe lasted a long time...had it for a couple of breakfasts and lunches.

I made this for Christmas brunch and it was very successful. My only alterations were: I used spiral egg noodles for texture, I used 1/2 cup raisins and 1/2 c. chopped dried apricots, and I added a teaspoon of diced lemon zest. The apricots and lemon added a bit of tartness to offset the creaminess of the cheese and sour cream. I made the kugel the day before and it reheated nicely for the brunch. I'll definitely make it again.

I altered the recipe a bit - used 12 oz. noodles, 2 extra tablespoons butter(not necessary), substituted apricot jam for apples, and took out a bit of the sugar. It got rave reviews.

As one who stops in the kitchen only once or twice a week I marveled at how easy it was to produce such a marvelous kugel. Add a bit of pineapple as a final touch.

Mmm.... taste-ee. I left out the sweet stuff and added parsley and basil instead to make a savory dish - maybe not too authentic but really good anyways!

Like Ken, I cut back on the sour creme. Added a tablespoon or so of finely diced lemon zest. No vanilla.

I admit I modified a bit first.....light and less sour cream, a little less butter, one apple, a bit less sugar....tasted VERY good, but i still thought it was pretty sweet. I used a smaller pan so it came out a bit more like the consistency of bread pudding, so if you like a crispier, less dense kugel follow the baking info. One more thing, if you are a rookie with kosher rules.... no dairy with a meat meal..right? Please forgive me. Enjoy!

This recipe was really good. I modified it by using Ricotta chees insted, and putting pinapples in it insted of apples. It was great!

I would add some crushed pineapple, slightly drained. It makes a great addition to the raisins but since I don't like raisins I leave them out and think it tastes better and sweeter. It is a very good compliment. You can also serve it with frozen strawberries that are defrosted as a sauce.

I made the original dish which my scout troop loved. I then made it with a mixed fruit, apricots, cherries, apples, pears, and peaches. I also added a touch of light brown sugar to sweeten the cherries a little. yummmmmm
