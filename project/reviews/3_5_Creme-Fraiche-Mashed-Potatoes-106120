They were good & EZ, went well with the short ribs. I think I prefer a true mashed potato with butter & milk and then add the sour cream too.

These are so good, easy and wonderful. I will definitely make these again and they are the perfect pair with the Ribs. Another reviewer mentioned using Yukon Gold potatoes, which I may try next time as I really enjoy those potatoes.

I used red potatoes with the skin on and replaced the sour cream with stoneyfield plain yogurt. I used the immersion blender to blend it and added fresh parsley when I served it. Was delicious with the Short Ribs Provencale.

Made them with the shirt ribs. Everyone loved them I used the entire tub of creme fraiche and added even more butter because mine was a little dry. Really good.

Oh and don't forget to oven dry the potatoes once they finish boiling, and are drained..this creates a much lighter, fluffier mashed potato...

I doubled this recipe, and loved it more the next day when I reheated it in the oven and toasted the top, making it crunchy.. Divine

Wonderful! But remember to let the potatoes cool a bit before adding the creme fraiche so that you don't lose the benefit of the cultured dairy. Add the butter while you mash the potatoes and then just let them sit a bit before stirring in the creme fraiche.

Delicious!! I thought it needed a little warmed milk too, as I like lighter consistency. Great with the ribs.

Made with the braised short ribs recipe. Very good mashed potatoes, but were far better with the addition of some sea salt and fresh black pepper. Also used Yukon Gold potatoes.

Since I first made this a few years ago I've never made mashed potatoes any other way. You can play with the wet ingredients to get your desired texture. Great under braised meat dishes.

I would make these again, but I would use Yukon Golds or some other potato that is creamier than the Russets. Worked well with the short ribs though.

My mother makes this exact recipe with sweet potatoes and a *pinch* of sugar.

Creamy and delicious. Great with the Short Ribs Provençale.

This was a good dish just a little bland. I think, however, it goes well the with Short Ribs Provencal because it doesn't compete with the flavors of that dish. On its own though it would just be ok mashed potatoes. I really couldn't taste the creme fraiche.

Loved these!!!!!!!!! Tangy and so good.

I should never have made these at Thanksgiving before I will now forever be responsible for supplying them. Creme fraiche is expensive and hard to find but worth the search. I add a few springs of fresh rosemary in a cheesecloth pouch when I'm boiling the potatoes for extra flavor.

I have made this dish several times for dinner parties, and each time is a success. I was trying to copy this one dish from a restaurant that we love around here, and this is a pretty close copy of it. It is a lot of work, so plan accordingly, but it is worth it...the meat doesn't even need a fork because it is soo tender. the mashed potatoes has a whole new level because of the creme fraiche...definitely worth it. enjoy this dish...its so tasty!

delicious! and I didn't even add the listed amount of creme fraiche & butter. went great with roast beef. I'm going to make the short ribs this winter, for sure.

Easy and delicious, I too make my own Creme Fraiche. Terrific with the short ribs!

Delicious!!! Goes perfectly with the Braised short ribs.

These were great! I added about 8 cloves of roasted garlic, used fleur de sel, white pepper and only about 2 lbs of potatos. I gave it three forks because I don't think mashed potatos can qualify for four, I reserve that for the amazing. Definately a keeper, though!

these are the best short ribs ever. Easy to make and delicious. We have made them several times and are planning them for dinner party this weekend.

The first time I had crème fraîche mashed potatoes was when I lived in Paris and nothing has compared since! I made these with my Valentine's dinner and used only half of the potatoes, but all of the creme fraiche and butter! (won't be eating these everyday) I always use red potatoes because I find they consistently make much better mashed potatoes, and I live in New York, so crème fraîche wasn't hard to find. Definitely use crème fraîche - sour cream is not the same! These are what mashed potatoes should be: elegant, smooth, decadent.

Creme Fraiche ============= makes 1 cup 1/2 cup heavy or whipping cream 1/2 cup sour cream whisk together in small bowl. pour mixture into jar, cover, let stand in warm place for 12 hours. Stir and refrigerate for 24 hours sour cream is acceptable, but not equivalent.

I added more creme fraiche. For those that live in areas with an hispanic population..Cacique makes a Mexican Crema that is actually creme fraiche. It's in the deli section with the Mexican cheeses. The Mexicans learned to make creme fraiche during the 5 minutes they had a French emperor. Maximillian didn't last, but his cuisine did. I also added some celery seed, a personal quirk.

This is one of my favorites. I followed the recipe to a "T". The garlic is wonderful. The Creme Fraiche mashed potatoes was perfect. It just doesn't get any better than this.

To make this dish really SING, add whipped butter AND horseradish!!!! WOW Another variation would be same ingredients, PLUS roasted garlic pureed and snipped chives. To Die for!!

I was shocked by how well this turned out. So simple, I never used sour cream in mashed potatoes before. Couldn't find creme fraiche anywhere, so I used the alternative, and it was so wonderful. Definitely not dry. Definitely a recipe to be used over and over again.

I can't believe some people did not like these - I don't think I'll ever make mashed potatoes any other way ever again. In NYC, it's easy to find creme fraiche - usually in the refrigerated section with the soft cheeses (goat, mascarpone, etc.).

This was a really good- actually like the first recipe I've ever made with mashed potatoes. It was rich and buttery except I used sour cream which probably didn't have the same flavor as the creme fraiche. Does anyone know were to find that in the grocerry store and where?

Excellent! Dry? add more creme fraiche........ FYI, sour cream would NOT have the same rich flavor.
