I wanted to create a special cake for my parent's 60th wedding anniversary celebration. I had never taken on a tiered cake before, so I was nervous, but this recipe sounded so good. I decided to do a two-tier test before the event, and the cake part didn't turn out good at all for me. I confess that I did add 1/2 cup sour cream to each batch of batter, so perhaps that threw the balance off. The cake did not cook through, and was way too dense, and it wound up in the garbage. My second test was using the basic butter recipe from wilton.com as my batter. Then I followed this recipe for everything else. Like other reviewers have mentioned, a little lemon and vanilla added to the cream cheese frosting works well. The Magicake Baking strips are a amazing! Test #2 received rave reviews at work. I used apricot spread instead of rosehip jam (as I was saving that for the final). The final cake was delicious. And the rosehip jam has a lovely texture and not-too-sweet flavor. I used blueberries instead of blackberries. I also found the assembly instructions easy to follow. Also, others have questioned whether this recipe is true to the original as printed in Gourmet magazine. Well, I purchased the original mag on eBay, and I can report that is exact to the letter.

The cake baked perfectly. The grain looks good, but I, too, think it is a little on the dry side--a bit flavorless as well. I would only rate it 3 forks. The Elvis Presley poundcake (it uses sour cream) is the best I've found at epicurious.

No one has reviewed this for awhile. I'm going to try it because of the controversy and because of the unusual directions for the cake method. I've never seen a pound cake that doesn't incorporate one whole egg at a time. But there are lots of issues with grain etc. when it comes to homemade pound cakes. I've a cake for early February, so I will check back with the results.

Everyone loved this cake! It was my first tiered caked & it came together great. Just start early, at least 3 days in advance, so you're not stressed. You only need 1/2 the lemon syrup, and not as much jam as it calls for. Make sure the butter is REALLY at room temp or you cakes will come out with "craters" in them. The frosting is AWESOME. I already made it a 2nd time for a different cake. The finished product weighed 25 lbs!

This is an excellent cake. I have made it several times and it always gets rave reviews. You have to follow all the steps however- don't leave out the lemon syrup or the preserves or it will be bland and probably dry.

It has been a year since eating this cake. I pulled it out for my daughter's first anniversary and the cake still was fabulous!

It just amazes me, the unfavorable reviews people who are obviously not cooks/bakers write and submit. The fact that someone believes that 6 sticks of butter are 3 lbs. is unbelievable. The recipe states from the very beginning that this is a pound cake. Pound cakes do not require a leavening agent, they are meant to be a dense texture. They do raise while baking due to the air incorporated while mixing. My suggestion to other reviewers is, if you do not know what you are talking about, do not review a recipe. You appear stupid.

I'm thinking the difference in reviews is the fact that it is a pound cake recipe and not your typical wedding cake recipe.I, however LOVE any type of cake.I always thought that 1 lb. of butter was 4 sticks.Anyway, I would not make this for anyone unless they love pound cake.

I just made this cake for a wedding for 250 people and it was a smashing success! And my first attempt at such a feat. I did one tiered cake and 3 sheet cakes. Each batch of batter provides a layer; the sheet cake only has two layers. I did have access to a commercial oven for a full size sheet, but the cake is so dense and forgiving, you could probably do a half sheet at home that yields 4 layers. Thankfully blackberries were in season and I found an organic pick your own for the 20# I needed. Everything about the recipe was easy and delicious. I froze the cakes a week and they thawed out in about 4 hours so I could work with them. You need no other tips!

I almost forgot...if you are wanting several layers, I would bake each layer and not plan to cut the layers. We had difficulty cutting the layers because of its density. Also, the cake froze beautifully and did not dry out.

This cake was used as one of my daughter's layers for her wedding cake. The flavor of this cake is fabulous. it has a cheesecake density and melts in your mouth. We had no difficulty with baking, but we followed recommended magic strips for even baking.

there is no leavening bc it is leavened from the air incorporated during the creaming of the butter and sugar. This is why it is important to fully cream the 2 together for 5 minutes, until very fluffy.

This turned out great!!! I made it in square pans (12", 8" and 4") and covered the layers in a white rolled fondant and fresh flowers - gorgeous. As for the other comments - I would suggest being VERY generous with both the lemon syrup and the preserves and the cake stays very moist this way. I did a blackberry, raspberry and blueberry layer just to liven it up and I used butter cream for the berry layer instead of cream cheese and it was fine. Also I froze the layers about 2 weeks before frosting - and I think they were even MORE moist!!

I don't know what the matter with this recipe is but I made it and no one ate it !! Embarassed beyond belief. 4 squares of butter is l lb. Some butter comes in four sections - wrapped separately - its 1 lb. therefore 1 square is 1/4 lb and so on. Only thing I ever made from Epicurious which was a disaster. Crying in Ottawa

It felt like my tongue was being put through a wood chipper. My sister will have this cake in her freezer for the rest of her life. No one asked for seconds. In fact no one could make it through their firsts. Your tongue would feel better if you ate the roses instead of the cake.

I used this recipe to teach a class on how to make wedding cakes. The cake tasted great but I think leavening was left out of the recipe as the cake was dense and very heavy. The recipe was almost identical to one in Beranbaum's "Cake Bible" and her recipe used baking powder, so in a repeat class, we are adding 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder. Will let you know how it turns out

I can't believe the bad reviews on this! Weird! I made it (almost) exactly as the recipe stated and it was wonderful - I usually hate fancy cakes - esp buttercream icing...this one satisfied on all counts. I made it for a birthday, and colored the frosting pale yellow. I also used thawed frozen blackberries patted dry. Served with a simple rasberry coulis. I made it from the recipe in the actual magazine - perhaps there is a typo in the online version?

I used a different filling for the cake, apricots and almonds to good effect. Let me say, too, congratulations to the mother(?) of the bride who made the cake with seashell decorations. What a beautiful, wonderful thing to do, I'd love to know how you did seashells.

My first wedding cake! A spin-off of an English Trifle, I loved the idea. The cooking and technique advice was great, and the results were fantastic. We had rave reviews. I live at the beach, so instead of roses, I made white choclate seashells, dusted with seashell colors. It was a challenging project, but well worth the effort. My daughter was thrilled when we served this cake on a large antique silver tray at a family reception two months after her wedding.

the explanation says that the cake layers are pound cake -- they generally do not have leavening agents because some if not all pound cakes are not intended to rise -- they are dense.

I just found this recipe. I thought it sounded good, but when I read the wildly contradictory reviews I decided to read over the recipe very carefully. It appears that the reviewer who thought something might have gone wrong between the publication in 1999 and the recipes arrival on the website is right. Of course, this is only hunch on my part but it seems very strange to me that the recipe for the batter (which is not a genoise) has no leavening whatsoever. How's it going to rise?

my review of this recipe is that it was abosoulty wonder ful i have never tasted something that good in years. i love it you just have to try it!

I gave it a trial run for a party before making for a wedding and the cake passed the taste test. I love it because I'm not personally fond of overly sweet cakes, and this cake is rich without the susgar shock.

in response to the cook who thinks that 6 sticks of butter are 3 lbs, get a clue, it IS 1.5 lbs like the other cook said!

I would like to request that you include pictures with your recipes especially desserts. But, it helps to be able to see what the finished product looks like. Kinda like a pattern for a wedding dress. Thanks.

I made this cake for a friends wedding last September and feel compelled to come to it's defense. I found no problem with ingredient quantities or recipe outcome. I had a small technical problem with the jam layers - the cake was heavy and a fair bit of the jam squished out, no big deal. It took a bit of time (I spread it out over 4 days) but it was well worth the effort. Not only was it beautiful, it was delicious - everyone ate it and LOVED it! I even took leftovers to the restaurant where I work and the food savvy staff loved it as well. I can't imagine what went wrong for all the other reviewers. Maybe an error was made when the recipe was transcribed from the print format to the Website. I worked from the August '99 Gourmet and would recommend that everyone else check that issue before they write this recipe off.

For the cook from DC, a pound of butter has 4 cubes in it and a pound and a half is 6 cubes of butter. Hope this helps you out in your cooking!

WHY is this recipe STILL listed??? I never had any trouble with any recipes from Gourmet Magazine, until this one came along. I didn't make it for a wedding, and thank God I had extra deserts as back ups. Perhaps someone can work out the ingrediants to this one and re-vamp it.

This recipe is still terrible. However, in reference to the previous comment, usually 6 sticks of butter is 1.5 pounds. Generally, recipes refer to sticks of butter you buy at a grocery store. These are usually 4 oz each (4 sticks to a pound carton). 4 oz X 6 is 24 oz, which is 1.5 lbs. I can't believe this recipe ever got published in a respected cooking magazine.

Last time I checked, 6 sticks of butter was 3 pounds, not 1.5!!!!

I'm so glad I'm not alone! This was a terrible cake. It sounded so good, but I think I'd have better results with a cake mix.

Fortunately, I gave this recipe a trial run. I could tell while it was in the oven that it would not work. GROSS. It literally fried in its own fat. The other day when I chose this recipe no one had rated it, I now see that someone else had the same results. Did you really test this recipe?
