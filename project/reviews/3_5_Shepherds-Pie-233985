I make Shepherd's Pie frequently, and although this is a good recipe, If you have never made this dish before, there are simpler versions out there.

There was a great deal of concern regarding the cheese curd. I used cottage cheese, which is easy to get and a light version. I also put a bit more onion and garlic in the potato mix. Very good.

I did a much quicker, more low-key version of this dish. Instead of venison and pork shanks I simply used ground beef and ground lamb. I browned the meat along with some fire-roasted tomatoes. Didn't add the cheese curds, they weren't missed. I did the rest of the recipe as stated. This only took 2 hours instead of 4. It makes a great family meal, the leftovers are delicious. I also do a vegetarian version, using vegetarian 'beef' crumbles. Quite yummy.

I have made this recipe 4 times in the past 6 months. The only adjustment I make is to completely omit the cheese. This dish is already quite heavy...and I think the cheese would be too much.

I forgot to mention that I too left out the cheese; certainly didn't miss it, and I wonder if I would have found the cheese too heavy, too sticky, too gooey, etc. for an already gooey (albeit very tasty) dish.

I followed the recipe pretty well, but made a few adjustments. First, I avoided the brown mush scenario described by the last poster by only blending about half of the corn. I also could only find frozen white corn, so it had a pretty different color than the layers above and below. I used venison and pork as recommended, however, only ground was available. It still came out great and was cheaper, too. However, since venison is so gamey tasting, next time I might try either increasing the pork ratio and/or adding lamb or beef into the meat mix as well. I also put a touch of tomatos and tomato paste and red wine in the meat potion to help harmonize the gamey taste I was getting. It did not conflict with the corn/white wine flavors or the mashed layer flavors at all. Finally, I skipped the cheese addition. I made my mashed super creamy and buttery, but cheese with meat is just really heavy. Didn't miss it a bit...and I'm a cheese lover!

I made this with beef and lamb, and didn't find it horribly time-consuming. It was delicious, but not beyond compare (maybe it's beyond compare when made with venison). While it might be very convenient to serve this dish at a dinner party, it's pretty ugly. :-) Beneath the potatoes, it's all just beige-brown mush -- suitable as comfort food for good friends, but I'd never serve it as part of a more elegant dinner (it goes well with stoneware soup bowls, but not with china and crystal). In fact, I found it alittle too mushy; next time, I'll skip putting the corn mixture in the blender, and I'll find a way to make the potato topping have more of a crisp crust. But, still a keeper, and the dog was beside herself licking the empty dish (I put it in two baking dishes, so I could have one left over to freeze; worked out nicely).

This looks like a great entertaining dinner for a hostess who wishes to spend time with her guests.However I would agree with PB from Lindsay,England.It should have another more exotic name like, for example"DELICE DE CHASSEUR" which would indicate wild meat.A shepperds pie is an old comfort food made usually from leftover roasts.I will definitely try this recipe,leaving out the cheese curds and instead using grated old cheddar.

I made this dish for a large group and by special request I did not include the cheese curds. The potato layer was lovely and rich on its own. It is true that the recipe is time consuming but the favourable comments and second helpings made the effort worthwhile.

Good this may be, but it's nothing to do with Shepherds. The last time that I looked, Shepherds looked after Sheep not Deer (herdsman or drover) or Pigs (pigman or swineherd). A true Shepherd's Pie's meat is minced / ground or cubed lamb. So please, if you make this, call it by another name. Alternatively, take a look at the brilliant Shepherd's Pie recipes which contain lamb within the recipe search pages.

i substituted lamb as i couldn't find venison & added some brined green peppercorns to the meat. a very rich dish. it was very time consuming but the results were very satisfying. it easily feeds 10 people. i would make it again if i needed to feed a lot of people, but would make the meat & corn portions ahead to save time.

I took a gamble making this dish for guests because the ingredients were intimidating (venison, haloumi) and I wasn't even sure I could find them (but Whole Foods had everything). It seemed a bit time-consuming and at one point I wondered what I had gotten myself into. HOWEVER, my guests absolutely raved about it and everyone had seconds. It's a great do-ahead dinner party dish. The potatoes on the top were incredible. I didn't have a potato-ricer so I used a food processor for just a little bit of the potatoes and all the roasted garlic, then I mashed the rest of the potatoes by hand--do not beat or you'll get a gluey consistency. I was told that the meat tastes "wild and intense." This is a very impressive dish.
