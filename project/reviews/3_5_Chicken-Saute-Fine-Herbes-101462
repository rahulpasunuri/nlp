I'm shocked that this just wasn't that good. I love butter and herbs, but the chicken didn't benefit from either in this preparation. Not much flavor, even with my fresh garden herbs. Used organic chicken and butter. When I roast chicken using butter and herbs it's fantastic, I just don't think the saute works here.

This is so easy and fresh and delicious, hard to beat. I used an inexpensive sauvignon blanc (my go-to cooking wine), tarragon, parsley and chives. Served with steamed carrots, rice, a lovely simple meal.

I used leg quarters and found the recipe delicous! I found that the browning in butter made all the difference.

A tried and true recipe I make often. I usually use tarragon, parsley and shallots as my herb combination. Tastes great with mashed potatoes and peas!

Very good, quick and easy to prepare. I used 4 lbs. breasts and 1 lb. thighs (all bone in). In addition to the wine for the deglazing, I added about 1 1/2 c. chicken broth simmered for 10 min. then finished it in a 425 oven for 15 min. After removing from the oven, I added the herbs and simmered on the stove for 5 min. If necessary, remove the chicken and boil a bit longer to reduce to the desired concentration of flavor. Mashed potatoes and asparagus rounded out the menu. Yummy and fairly light.

The wine and fresh herbs make this dish seem so elegant that your guests will never guess how easy it is to make. I've tried most of the herb combinations, and they've all been absolutely delicious.

Went with the chervil/chives/tarragon combo, and added cream at the end, and loved it.

My partner and I absolutely loved this recipe. The dill is really what made the dish fantistique!
