Had a similar rendition at the Wine Spectator Experience in New York. The staff couldn't keep up with the demand. People LOVED these! I make theses at home with cheese and without. I like to serve them standing in a clear glass tube filled with sea salt purchased at TJ Max. This saves valuable tray space and heightens the overall presentation.

I will not make this again. It was a disapointing use of good Parma prosciutto. Plus, I had to buy a whole packlage of the figs when I only needed a few for the jam. The guests left them on the tray, so there you have it. The only good thing about this was that it got me to open a fantastic bottle of Port and we drank it into the wee hours!

I love how these breadsticks present on a tray. I use mini breadsticks and store-bought fig jam from the market. I add Mascarpone cheese and pine nuts to the filling. A litte tricky to roll, but what a delicious combination!
