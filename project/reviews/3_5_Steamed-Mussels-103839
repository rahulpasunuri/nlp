This is such a great versatile dish that you can add to or delete whatever you want. It is a wonderful dish for the full on mussel flavour!! I added garlic and used shallots instead of onion. I reduced the broth and sopped that wonderful liquid with bread afterward as well. Yummy!

I took the suggestion of various reviewers and added mustard to the mussel "juice" from the pot and man was that GOOD with some baguette slices. I think I probably liked the bread and dipping sauce better than the actual Mussels, but maybe that is mostly novelty talking.

Delicious! I used shallots instead of onions and then added some butter to the oil. I also added garlic while I cooked the shallots. At the end I added some heavy cream. This is a hit for my family.

Wonderful - but I used a leek instead of the onion and added some fresh rosemary sprigs. Also added a pat of butter or two at the end to add a little richness. Mussels and a crusty french bread make a wonderful supper.

Made the mussels according to the recipe, but then made my own dipping sauce - mayonnaise, Jack Daniels No. 27 mustard, and Old Bay seasoning. It was amazing! I'd never have believed 4 pounds of mussels could disappear so quickly. Definitely a keeper.

Wonderful, but try adding chopped celery, carrot and misced garlic to onion. Then add 1/2 cup chicken broth plus the wine. Cook liquid down some before adding mussels. Use hard seasoned garlic bread to enjoy the broth with mussels. Very good.

It's hard to review this recipe since it's impossible not to add to it! I made it more or less as written, but I did add butter to the olive oil, then added chopped fresh parsley, fresh chives and dried thyme when I added the wine. Also (thanks Brussels!) I did add some mustard to some of the juice and we dipped the mussels in that. Absolutely delicious!!!

Soooo easy and tasty. Used green mussels (already cooked) and chopped a bit of fresh tomato on the plates. And the suggestion to mix a bit of mustard with cooking liquid for dipping was GREAT. Will do again for sure.

Hello from Belgium, the #1 consumers of mussels. Add some green celeri in chunks, 1 carrot in slices, 1 big onion in rings (i.s.o. 1/2) and 1 branch of dried or fresh thyme. When done, take a small cup of the juice and add 1 teaspoon of mustard to use as a dipsauce.

Don't ever throw out the broth!! I have been cooking clams and mussels for 50 years. I fight to save some of the broth from the bread-soppers and nectar drinkers. I freeze the broth (which is now enriched by the mussels/clams) and use it as the "starter" for the next time. It gets better and better. I also add butter (lots), dill, garlic, parsley, lemon juice, and finely chopped tomatoes and celery to the broth (and less onion). Bring to a boil, then add mussels. Don't overcook. Serve when they open (5-10 minutes).

SIMPLE AND FABULOUS! FRESH MINCED GARLIC IS A MUST TO ADD AND DON'T GET RID OF THE COOKING LIQUID UNLESS ITS WITH SOME GOOD CRUSTY BREAD!

Hi All, I actually use Vidalia Onions for this one and ensure the white wine is really big and out there. For fun, I toss in some chopped garlic, a wee touch of Worstershire Sauce, and approx 1/3 to 1/2 cup of cream. MMMMM!!! A cottage favourite with freshly baked bread.

We used garlic oil to add a little kick. All mussels are not created equal. I used the cultivated ones and boy are they good. The size, the texture, well everything!

As wonderful as you would get in a restaurant! My mother (who hasn't eaten shellfish in 18 years even ventured to try it and thought it was delicious). The key is.....buy cultivated mussels!!!! And...don't discard the steaming liquid...sop it up with some really great French/Italian bread!
