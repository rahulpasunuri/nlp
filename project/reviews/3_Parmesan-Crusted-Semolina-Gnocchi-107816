Loved this recipe. Easy to make and the results were as I remember Gnocchi alla Romana growing up in Italy. If you have a round or flower shaped cookie cutter, you can make them even more authentic. I would cut the salt back to 1/2 tsp next time. I made mine in the toaster oven and cooked them a little longer than suggested.

This is a very bland version of a very good dish. My version uses whole milk, and adds eggs and cheese to the gnocchi dough, along with the nutmeg and pepper already mentioned. I'd use a whole egg, beaten, and a handful of parmesan or gruyere for this quantity, and beat it in off heat, before cooling. Then I'd follow the recipe, except pour a little cream over at the end and run it under the broiler till golden. Yum!

These were fine, and good for a change of pace. I won't go out of my way to make them again.

Extremely easy, tastes very good. I added a little nutmeg and pepper. A nice healthy meal that can be made with short notice (having semolina)

Delicious and actually very easy. I would make this anytime as a simple, but different, side dish. It has very little in common with gnocchi -- more like polenta squares -- but still very good.
