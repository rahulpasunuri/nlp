this is the first time i've cooked with figs. these are very time-consuming. not for the newbie baker. i think the flavor combinations are interesting, but the cookie itself is not sweet, so if that's your thing, you will love these. i'm a little more happy with more sweetness. i probably won't do these again.

I love these cookies and have made them every holiday season since I discovered them. Due to the fact that there is no sugar listed in the ingredients, it should be pretty obvious that these aren't very sweet cookies. Any sweetness comes from the figs and the honey, but they're good as they are, made perfect with a cup of tea. I've made these cookies several times, and have make subtle tweaks over time. I no longer make the S-shape pattern, though it is pretty. It's so much easier and just as cute to make a pinwheel shape. Occasionally I sub in white whole wheat flour for the regular flour, though it makes the dough a little dry (so I only use a scant 1 1/2 cups when I do that). Also, I use about half the amount of honey. Slightly sweet, with a slight crunch from the fig seeds, these cookies are wonderful!

In 50 years of baking Christmas cookies, these are hands down the WORST cookies ever -- awful from the labor-intensive preparation, to the convoluted assembly, to the (wrong) baking instructions and RUINED pans, to the taste -- blecchhh. Do NOT make these cookies! Horrendous. ZERO stars.

I have the dough ready to go and the filling...and decided to read the reviews to see if anyone can explain the "s" shape. I have NO idea how this is supposed to work! So I'll probably just roll them up. The recipe appealed to me because it reminded me of cucidati, but "s-shape" is ridiculous.

The first time I baked these, they looked exactly like the picture, but were bland-because I followed the recipe exactly. This time they were good but with plenty of adjustments. I used 1 1/2 C of dried figs for the filling (the first time did not turn out with enough I thought), added 1/3 C sugar to the dough, backed way off on the honey adding only 1 1/2 T, didn't have OJ on hand so skipped the zest and used blueberry cocktail juice I had on hand, also sprinkled the cookies with a bit of sugar before baking 12 mins. These were still only just ok/good. Really not worth the time refrigerating, etc. The best thing about them is that they can be made in the food processor for ease.

I have made the Fig Swirls five years in a row. They are truly a favorite on my cookie table. I follow the recipe exactly. I cannot imagine why anyone would add sugar to the pastry. The filling is very sweet and the pastry is a perfect balance. The pastry dough is very easy to work with. I usually have enough filling left over to make a third log. I just make half of the pastry recipe. I do make the "s" shape, I think it looks very classy!

I tried the S shape my first go with this recipe, and then changed to a pinwheel. It came out cleaner and still looked elegant. I also agree with the reviewers that leave the pastry as-is - crispy and not too sweet.

I added 1/3c. powdered sugar to the dough and it was the perfect sweetness. Lovely cookies even if I did burn the bottoms of most of them :(

The recipe is perfect, it doesn't need anymore sugar. In fact I only put 1/4c. of honey in the filling and used dates instead of figs. The unsweet dough is a great match for the sweet filling. A wonderful match with a cup of coffee or tea.

I have made these twice now and plan to make them again this year. The filling is really, really delicious and the pastry is particularly lovely and flaky. I prefer that this cookie not have a very sweet pastry as it would detract from the filling. All that said, last year, I gave up on the figure S business and just rolled these up into a pinwheel log. I found it easiest to cut these by sliding plain dental floss under the chilled log and bringing the two ends together to create a clean slice.

I've made this recipe twice now and I've got the hang of it. The dough definitely needs 1/4 or 1/3 cup sugar added when you are mixing the butter and cream cheese - I like having not- overly-sweet cookies, but the dough was really too bland without a little sugar. The rolling instructions might be helped if it said "Flip the dough completely over to the other side." Once that finally dawned on me it was a snap to get the "S" shape. I made the filling exactly as the recipe instructed and I had enough extra to make another batch of dough. The filling didn't squish when sliced and the finished cookies look just like the picture. Do be sure to use the mildest honey you can find - I thought mine was very mild but the honey flavor still overwhelmed the fig flavor - I think I'll cut back on the honey next time. Absolutely use parchment or Silpat - they didn't stick at all. If the recipe didn't require tweaking I'd give it 4 forks.

I really hate to say this because a)I think of myself as a pretty competent baker and 2)I hate to admit defeat but these cookies were just short of disaster. I read the reviews and agree more sugar in the dough would have been good. I had a little trouble with the S shape but the second log worked better than the first. Also refrigerating the logs for a long time was crucial. The thread trick for "cutting" the cookies from another reviewer worked great. But there was too much filling and it oozed out when I cut the cookies and when they baked. They aren't attractive or that tasty. I won't try this again.

I really enjoy these cookies. I do not have a food processor, so I did the whole thing the old-fashioned way and they came out perfect. I did not even try the S-roll I did a jelly roll and they look great and not a single cookie broke. I did not use a knife to cut the rolls, I used my mothers cinnamon roll trick... cut a piece of sewing thread and put it under the roll at the cookie thickness you desire then cross it on top and pull Ta Da perfect slices with no smashing or squishing of the pretty roll. I will definitely be making these again!

These were absolutely wonderful. I loved the sweetness of the honey and figs against the unsweetened but rich dough. I used clementines since I didn't have any oranges, but oranges would have given a stronger hint of citrus - next time I won't substitute. Also substituted a pinch of cloves and a pinch of cardamon since I don't care for cinnamon with figs. Definitely the fig cookie recipe I've been looking for.

I agree that the pastry dough could use just a bit of sugar, but I do like that these are less sweet than most Christmas cookies/candy - a great addition to the cookie buffet. I only had fresh figs so I made a jam ("drunken" fig jam from this site) for the filling. Overall I think it needs a little higher ratio of filling to pastry- so maybe I'll roll the dough a bit thinner next time. I had no problem making the s-roll and thought that it made the final product especially pretty. But, I had a few crack after baking (even though I didn't have a problem slicing them). I guess I'll just have to eat the mistakes!

I had to use a dough hook on my mixer to make the dough and it worked just fine. I made the dough and filling early in the day and left them in the fridge all day. I rolled and filled them and left them in the fridge over night. I gave each roll a little squeeze to pull them together and give them a uniform shape. I baked them the next morning and had no problem with breaking (lucky first timer???). I found that if you cut them whne they are really cold they hold their shape. I am going to try them with a raspberry filling next.

I had a bit of trouble getting the dough to come together in a ball so added about 1 Tbsp of cream. Based on other reviews regarding the S-roll, I went for a "palmier" shape: spread filling to edges of dough, then roll from the long edge of rectangle to middle of dough, repeat for other side. The dough stayed together nicely during baking and not too many have broken. Using the serrated knife was a good tip! Thanks.

These were not difficult to make. I would add a little more sugar next time to the dough. Rolling them out was not difficult. I used a serrated knife as someone recommended & that was very helpfu. When spreading the fig onto the dough, make sure you spread it all the way to the edge of the side away from you so when rolled, they have fig in the entire swirl including the end piece. Use a thin metal spatula to remove them from the cookie sheet & if you start at a long end, they are less likely to break. great cookie.

These are just what they say they are. There is a bit of pastry and a bit of fig in every bite. I make them every year without fail. They are delicious!

I thought these were fantastic as did everyone else, especially mom. I have made them years previous using the magazine - per request/demand. After a move (and no longer having the mags), I had to come online to pull the recipe, and am reading the reviews for the first time. I didn't have problems rolling into the "S" swirl. It is a bit cumbersome, at first, but like another reviewer said, when you get the hang of it, it becomes much easier. Of course some of the slices from the end of the rolls weren't as pretty as the center cut, but I used those for my 'taste testing' and put the prettiest on the cookie platters and in gift boxes. I found a good serrated knife works best to get clean cuts, and make sure to wipe the knife clean after each cut to keep the fig filling from mucking up the cuts and dough. I also find I have to let them cool a bit more than other cookies to fully set before moving to a rack.

This is a great recipe! Tonight is actually the third time I'm making them. Now that fresh figs are plentiful, I reduced them into a jam and spread that out on the dough before rolling. I also roll them into jellyroll spiral shape before cutting to keep it simple. Everyone raves over them.

I thought these cookies were delicious but agree with others that they are hard to make pretty! I didn't even try the double roll, I just did a single roll. They still crumbled on the edges and I lost about 1/4 of them right off the bat. Then after baking they stuck to the sheet and lost about 1/3 more...anyway, a lot of work for a heartbreaking result. Very yummy though.

I loved the filling in this recipe. It was wonderful. The pastry was very easy to make and to work with. I had to read the instructions on how to roll the dough to make the swirls a couple of times. It's a bit complicated to roll. Next time, I'm going to make tartlets with the pastry and fill it with fig mixture instead.

I just finished baking these cookies and happy I looked at the reviews last night before filling the logs as I could not understand the rolling instructions. So I just rolled them like a jelly roll cake and they look just fine. Some of the filling oozed out when slicing the log so the finished cooking is not flat. I used parchment paper and let them sit a couple of minutes before moving cookies to wire rack. They taste wonderful, not a gooey sweet cookie.

These cookies taste fantastic; the filling is divine before it's cooked and the flavor just deepens and becomes even better after. They're not too sweet and have a perfect texture. However, as per another reviewer, the shape just doesn't come out as described. I would roll the logs into a simple spiral rather than try the S-roll again the next time I attempt this recipe, and i definitely will attempt this recipe again!

This cookie has great flavor. I was thinking it would taste similar to a fig newton, but the flavors in this recipe are much more complex. A more sophisticated fig newton. :) For the excellent flavor, I give it three forks. However, the picture makes them look too good to be true. I guess you just need a lot of experience making them to perfect your "S" roll. Mine looked much more deformed. ha ha. Also, being a university student, I do not own a large cuisinart mixer. I am, however, in possession of a mini one. I was able to make the dough and filling with this smaller contraption, but the dough, I had to mix in batches. All-in-all though, the cookies turned out well... definitely one I will try again closer to the holidays to try and perfect for the family. :)

Flavors were great and melded well, but silpat was essential (parchment might have worked well too)...but the double rolling was unsatisfying...cookies broke apart a lot and did not travel well from baking sheet to cookie tray. Still, nice mediterranean flavors.

I thought these cookies were good and pretty easy to make. Like a previous rater, I made the filling in advance and chilled it overnight. A day or so later, I made the dough and assembled the cookies only making mine in one small roll (half the swirl) because i wanted bite sized cookies. I then rolled them in parchment and stored in a ziploc bag in the freezer for about a week. I partially thawed them before baking and they didn't break -- cooked nicely.

These are really tasty cookies - love the orange-scented figs. However, mine didn't get attractive until the second roll. Make them for yourself or your family first to get the hang of the rolling and cutting. I did discover that it's best not to freeze the rolls. I accidentally froze one and chilled the other over night. THe frozen one was hard to cut and the dough broke, making unattractive swirls. THe chilled roll sliced much better. When I make this again, I'll just take the filling recipe and divide it into two bowls. I found the "use 1/4 of the filling" and then "use 1/3 of remaining" to be confusing. Divide it and you know you get a bowl for each roll. Finally, using a Silpat baking mat makes a big difference.

I made these cookies because competing with my 98 year old Sicilian grandma's cuccidatis would be impossible. This "dummied down" recipe is much easier, and satisfies the need for a good fig cookie on Christmas (for Italians, at least). They taste like a much more refined fig newton, and not as sweet. The rolling instructions don't seem to agree with the picture, so I had some trouble figuring out how to roll them properly. I probably overfilled them too, as a lot of filling oozed out and they don't look too pretty. But they taste great, and I'm very pleased with my simple fig cookie debut.

Homemade Fig Newtons!! If you can get these cookies to look like the cover of Gourmet...then you're probably in the wrong profession. They are so yummy but look just awful. Next time, I'm cookie cutting these bad boys and making them into little fig cookie sandwiches!

This recipe is cross between Rugelach and my Italian Fig Cookies (cuccidati). I found the pastry not sweet enough and the filling too bitter. They went together nicely but when stored became rather mushy. Sorry... I will keep my old recipes that I know will turn out delicious.

These cookies are divine. The dough and the filling are both very easy to mix up. I mixed the dough on a Saturday when I had a few minutes & then filled them on another evening when I had a few more mintues. I had trouble rolling them up and making them look as good as the photo though. I think I could use the filling as a rub for a pork roast or as a jam type side dish with some cheese as well.
