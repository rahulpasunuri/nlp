I'm going to try this recipe but after reading the last review I'll try seperating the pita as I do when I make them for hummus. Seperating the pita makes them crispier when baking them. I also use a hot oven (around 400 degrees)

I love the flavor and the color is nice, but they do not really crisp up well and if stored in a bag or tin, they are soft and tough. I was disappointed because I had planned to give them, along with homemade hotsauce.
