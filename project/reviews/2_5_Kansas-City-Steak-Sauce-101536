I find that very often the name of a place is assigned to a recipe without regard to whether or not it is something that is actually served in that place. For instance, you will find many un-authentic Mexican recipes on this site. Perhaps, this is a local favorite somewhere in the city, but it is NOT the KC "theme sauce". And who care's really, cooking is about trying new things. Why else would we all be here? Really, Compton, I wonder at two things, first that such vile ejaculations are neccessary; and second, that you gave this recipe two forks when you detested it so.
