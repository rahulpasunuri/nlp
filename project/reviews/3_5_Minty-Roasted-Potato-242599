I quartered the potatoes before I cooked them on the grill. The grill gave them a great taste. Great flavors with a hint of the grill taste. Crazy good.

Perfect with our Easter lamb. I used Yukon Gold potatoes. Definitely make sure you make the time to let them sit and absorb everything. I think the leftovers would make a quick Salade Nicoise, just add some tuna, green beans etc.

Good recipe, even with a few modifications. I quartered the potatoes before I roasted them and used thyme instead of mint. The outer sides of the potatoes got crispy and formed a nice skin, while the inside was soft and creamy. The thyme added good flavor and it was easy for my preschooler to pick up and eat.
