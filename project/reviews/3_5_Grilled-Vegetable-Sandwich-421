A nice sandwich. Used ciabatta rolls and it was very good. Added in a thinly sliced and grilled sunburst squash. Brush some of the olive oil and vinegar onto one half of the bread for extra flavor.

WOW! This sandwich exceeded my expectations. I followed the recipe exactly, and I plan on making this often. The mashed garlic and balsamic dressing add just the right flavors. Yum!

Instead of grilling the vegetables, you can also roast them in the oven. It's easier and tastes the same! I also roast the garlic in the oven. I cut off part of the top of the garlic bulb then drizzle with olive oil. They're done when they're brown and soft. Delicious! Another variation is to spread one side of the roll with pesto and the other side with the mashed roasted garlic. You can also insert a slice of cheese for protein and a creamy taste. Use your favorite. Enjoy!

My sister and I really like this recipe, the mashed garlic is amazing! We also use portabellos... delicious.

Really tasty. I have also made it with portobellos and asperagus, when in season. I like to keep a container of roasted veggies in the fridge for quick, cold veggie sandwiches.

Great recipe. As well as using the mashed garlic for a spread, I have also used hummus.

I love garlic, so I used twice as much. I used grilled videlia onion slices instead of green onions. Serve with napkins - it is juicy and good.
