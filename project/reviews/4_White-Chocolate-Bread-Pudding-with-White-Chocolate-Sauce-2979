Very good recipe. Used a 3qt dish and a 1 lb, challah loaf. It was on the drier side (solid, but still moist...probably because I used more bread than the recipe called for), but it still was very good, and the sauce made it perfect. Served 15 people with it and everyone loved it.

This is one of the most delectable bread pudding recipes ever. The white chocolate adds just the right touch of flavor. So rich you don't even need butter!

It was great but, as another reviewer commented, it was too big for a 2Q dish.

I had never had bread pudding before and this is by far the best dessert I've ever eaten! I substituted Challah bread for the french bread. Everyone who tried it couldn't believe it was bread pudding. They loved it!

I made this twice for both sides of the family this past Thanksgiving and had everyone begging for more. I used challah bread, cutting off the crust, and added dried Bing cherries that I first poached in brandy. Awesome!!!

As previously noted by several reviewers, this was excellent and even people who are not fans of white chocolate enjoyed it. However, the amounts listed were too voluminous for my baking dish. (I think mine is about 1-1/2 or 2 quarts). By using less cream (2 cups) and fewer eggs (8 rather than 9 total), and only 8 oz of the white chocolate, I managed to fit it into my dish.

This is wonderful. One of the best bread puddings I have ever had. Didn't have enough cream so used 2 cups cream and 2 cups whole milk. Served with a fudge sauce instead of white chocolate (again because I misjudged how much cream I had on hand)

I also made this bread pudding for the New Orleans v. Indy Superbowl. Having lived in New Orleans I have had some great bread pudding. This one was second to none! It was so much easier to make than I thought. It was very rich and a wonderful end to our meal! I will definitely make it again and again.

Amazing! I made this dessert for a Super Bowl party (New Orleans v Indianapolis), and everyone raved...they said I should make it again. Even my Mom (who doesn't cook) requested the recipe to make for her bridge group. I wasn't sure what do to about the crusts, so I left them on...that was fine...Will definitely make this again :)

I've been making this exact recipe since it came out in the 1996 Bon Appetit magazine and everytime, it gets rave reviews! I've served it with the white chocolate sauce - which is excellent, but also with a whiskey sauce. I think I prefer the whiskey sauce to balance the sweetness of the dish and add an unexpected tanginess. I always credit Bon Appetit but am secretly pleased when I hear family and friends request "MY" white chocolate bread pudding for a special occasion treat.

I've made this 5 times in the past 2 weeks (long story) but it's delicious and I've made a few tweaks to get the consistency I like. I use 8 oz. of both french bread and challah bread, prepared and dried in the oven as directed. I tried it in individual ramekins, but found that a ceramic 9X13 baker worked best. I prepared the sauce as directed but used 6 yolks and 3 whole eggs. Once I put the dried bread in the baking dish, I added one whole diced banana and a handful of white choc. chips (ghiradelli). The extra bread gave me a firmer texture as I do not care for soggy, soft bread pudding. Baked as directed with maybe 5 more minutes added to the 15 with the foil off. I didn't make the white choc. sauce, but instead served it with a choice of choc. fudge, caramel or blackberry merlot sauce. Each are decadent. Many raves and return customers :) Excellent recipe and very adaptable.

So I made this over the weekend, only I did it in individual deep-dish pizza pans. I didn't toast the bread in the oven, I let my bread dry out for a couple days. I also let the bread soak in the mixture overnight. I ended up adding 1/2 cup cream poured over the top of each one so the pudding was not dry and then I covered it with caramel sauce after it came out of the oven. I would make this again anytime.

I made this last week, and it was wonderful! In St Augustine, FL there is a Cuban Restuarant called the Columbia, which serves the BEST white chocolate bread pudding. People wait for hours for a table and their bread pudding is the perfect end to a lovelt meal. This recipe is EXACTLY like theirs. Next time, I think I'll make smaller individual servings, instead of one, big dish. Will be making again soon!!

As a native Louisianian I like to think I know bread pudding. I now make this recipe over the traditional one with rum sauce every time and always to rave reviews. and so easy

I have made this dessert 6 times and each time I have taken it to a party, it steals the show and everyone loves it. The last 4 times I have made it, I substituted Sweet Portuguese Bread for the french bread and it is absolutely lovely. I have never made the white chocolate sauce, only fresh whipped cream....

I would give the recipe 4 forks with these modifications: Bake in a water bath as I did the second time, and add a package of frozen or fresh raspberries.

I poked in small chunks of semisweet chocolate into the pudding, which relieved the white chocolate's tendency to be overly sweet. i also omittd 1/2 cup of sugar. there was no need for the white chocolate sauce.

It pains me to say this about a dish loaded with such good things as cream, eggs, and white chocolate, but I have to agree with San Fran's comment a while back that this recipe's a bit boring. We're definitely in the minority here, but I too felt that it was lacking even a hint of contrast in texture or flavor. It's not worth the calories in my book, but pretty much everyone else loves it, so give it a try and see what you think!

WOW! Calorie overload, but ideal for any special occasion. I mistakenly added all the chocolate to the pudding but omitted the sugar to compensate. I served it without the sauce ( no chocolate left!) and the rave reviews were gushing! I have made this several times more including the mistake!

Easy and delicious. I used one cup of cream to the remaining 8 oz. of white chocolate and added 2 tablespoons of bourbon for the sauce.

Although I haven't made this recipe, I do have a similiar Bon Appetit recipe that someone gave to me. The most delicious bread pudding I've ever tasted! The difference in the two recipes is that my recipe calls for 1 cup whipping cream and 8 ounces white chocolate for the sauce. Also, 1 lb. French bread, (not toasted). I don't understand why Bon Appetit would make these two changes to this recipe. Seems as though the ratio of bread would make a difference. This recipe has good reviews, but I'm staying with the older version.

This is a GREAT recipe and easy. I'm going to make it for Easter. My friends & family LUV it!!! I made only afew changes. I used raw sugar,Pepperridge Farm French vanillia bread(bake 12-14 mins after you cut into 1-inch pieces),3 eggs 6 yolks. I baked it in a water bath(put the baking dish with the bread pudding inside a larger baking dish then fill half way with warm water)bake covered 55 - 60 mins.@ 350.This really is the only way to bake bread pudding.I do not uncover for the last 15 mins. Bread pudding should be moist with no crusty parts. I made Spiced Rum sauce instead of the white chocolate sauce. I found the white sauce toooo sweet. 1 stick butter, 3/4 cup light brown sugar,1/2 cup cream and 1/4 to 1/3 cup Spiced Rum ( to taste). melt butter add sugar cook until sugar is melted 3-5 mins, remove from heat add cream and rum. Can be made ahead and heated in microwave 30 -40 seconds before severing.Enjoy!!!!!!!

My family thinks this dish is scrumptious, especially if you are a white chocolate fan. We prefer to eat this dish without the white chocolate sauce as we find it too sweet. The bread pudding itself is rich and flavorful.

i'm giving this one 3 forks only because my guests loved it. but being the dessert snob that i am, i just wasn't that impressed with this dish. yes, it's easy, and yes, it's very very rich and sweet. but it's definitely lacking something--sort of a boring recipe, more like a thick overly-sweet custard. only one other reviewer agrees, so i guess we're a minority! i added amaretto to the sauce, and served it with fresh rasberries to liven it up (and lighten it up) but that wasn't enough. others suggest adding bananas, vanilla, cutting back on the chocolate, and if i make this again i will try all of those suggestions. but my first instinct will be to try another chocolate bread pudding recipe...

I am not a dessert-maker, but this one was too easy to resist. It was a huge hit at an office party. Although the recipe says not to use low- or non-fat milk, I used soy milk with good results. I also sprinkled some cinnamon into the bread pudding before baking, and added some bourbon into the chocolate sauce. I will make it again.

So here is the deal. I was going to a Cajun night and was asked to make a dessert so I chose this recipe. It was quite well received, however, if you don't love bread pudding: this recipe will not change your mind. It must have a million calories (between the chocolate, whip cream and egg yolks) and I just felt it wasn't worth the calorie intake. That's my two cents for what its worth.

This dessert was such a hit at my bunco party. I had made it once before the party to make sure it would be good and I had shared some with my neighbors who came back over to see if they could have more! I have compared white chocolate chips and found that Ghiradelli was the best.

Awesome!! I've made this several times for many different people and everyone loves it! Everyone wants the recipe. It is very sweet and heavy but that's what desserts are all about. Pure indulgence! I've also assembled the pudding and let it sit for hours before baking. The bread absorbs the custard and I think it gives it a creamier consistency.

I agree with many of the reviews that this dessert is very rich and sweet, however if you're a white chocolate fan, that's what you like.

My passion for bread pudding, and my favoritism of white chocolate, made this dish seem a natural for me and my significant other. Unfortunately, both myself and my partner found it MUCH too sweet and rich. The white chocolate needs to be reduced (I felt like I was spooning gobs of sugar and eggs in my mouth), and perhaps some bourbon to smooth out the sweetness and liven it up.
