The pie is rich and delicious as promised, but it requires more cooking time than stated. It requires 55-60 minutes, no less! A bit too sweet for my taste, a tiny slice will do. I would also add a touch of salt.

I gave this 4 forks...for its simplicity.Made it for Thanksgiving just because I had the ingredients on hand....Came together perfectly. The baking time is off a bit---I baked it 15min longer and it came out perfect. The inside was firm enough to slice beautifully. Note---extremely rich!

I've been making this to serve along with the standard pumpkin pie the past 4 Thanksgivings. I'm puzzled about some of the previous reviews, as I follow the recipe and so far it has turned out perfectly every time. It IS very sweet and rich, so I top it with unsweetened whipped cream to balance the flavors. Very decadent!

I was very excited when I saw this recipe. It sounded just like my aunt's recipe. But to my surprise the filling came out very runny. The longer I left the pie in the oven the browner the crust became but the filling remained runny. Maybe this recipe is missing a thickening agent or something. This is just a BIG, HUGE DISAPOINTMENT the day before thanksgiving. I wounld NOT suggest this recipe to anyone. I don't think that this rating is strong enough to express my disapointment.

Used a store-bought crust, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly. Despite baking it for 50 minutes, at which point the top was becoming too brown, the filling remained runny. The chocolate (Baker's) had a gritty texture, also. Very disappointing. I think this is my first one-fork rating for a recipe on this site; don't know why one fork is for "just so-so", though; where is the rating for "this was terrible"?

Easy and delicious, (I used only 1/2 cup of brown sugar in the filling).

Very easy and delicious. I used a store bought crust and maple syrup instead of corn syrup. Other than that I followed the recipe and it came out great! I plan on making it again for a friend's shower.

Easy. Very rich, looks like you spent alot of time on it. My 16 year old daughter who helped make it thought it was "wicked good"

This pie rules! I'm a novice at baking, but I wanted to impress my family and our guests at Thanksgiving dinner and this pie definitely did the trick - and the best part is the simplicity in making it. Preparation time is so little and all you have to do is wait for it to bake and it came out rich and sweet and very well-received! I love it!

It was good, but I think I prefer plain old pecan pie. I love chocolate, but in this dish it just makes it a little too sweet.

It's not a bad pie, it's just not the kind of pie I really like. There was too much chocolate for my tastes, and all those walnuts were a bit of an overload. I might make this pie again, but I'd cut the amount of chocolate in half, and go 50% pecans, 50% walnuts.

This is an excellent alternative to the pecan pie, which I tend to find a little too sweet. Walnuts are a perfect compliment to the chocolate. I've made this pie several times and it's never failed to impress.

This recipe was a total flop. I served this pie for Christmas and was pretty embarrassed. There were four things wrong with it: 1) The pie turned out like soup! There was so much liquid that never set. You needed a spoon to even try to eat it. 2) The chocolate at the bottom of the pie was really hard. It was very difficult to cut through it (and to eat it). 3) The pie was WAY too sweet! Needed much less sugar and corn syrup. 4) The recipe never even tells you how much vanilla to use! Did Natalie Dupree even read her recipe before she published it??

I was nervous making this for the first time for my guests but it turned out perfectly and even though everyone was already stuffed from thanksgiving dinner they still made room for this beautiful pie

I made this pie using pecans instead of walnuts and it was a big hit at Thanksgiving. It's very sweet and rich and the chocolate is a nice surprise.

This was quite good, and is very similar to the Chocolate Kahlua Pecan pie recipe. I was hoping for something more fudgy in the center though. Has anyone tried mixing the melted chocolate in with the corn syrup mixture before baking?

wow! fantastic. This was superb. I love her recipes. I have several of her cookbooks. I will definitely keep this recipe handy!

I added vanilla to mine, 1 teaspoon, that makes the chocolate and butter have a smoother taste than if you don't use it.

Decadence couldn't be easier! This was a big hit. I used 1 tsp of vanilla. I highly recommend serving with fresh whipped cream otherwise I think it could be a bit too rich and sweet - not that that is a bad thing! Very Good.

I agree with the first rater, who had a question about the vanilla. It's not mentioned in the ingredient list, but it's in the preparation instructions. Does the recipe need vanilla, and if so, how much?

How much vanilla?
