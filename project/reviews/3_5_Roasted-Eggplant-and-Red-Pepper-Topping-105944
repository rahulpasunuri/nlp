I thought this recipe was delicious. I used a 1.5lb eggplant, 1 red pepper, 6 cloves garlic, 1 pint grape tomatoes, and 1 large onion. I chunked the vegetables into 3/4 inch pieces and roasted for 45 minutes. It made a delicious side dish with some grated parmesan.

So easy! Believe it or not, did NOT use garlic or basil- Had really fresh, tender eggplant & the flavor was superb!

Also added garlic, plus made the mistake of adding the basil at the beginning. It was delicious anyhow! And super easy. I served it with farro and mozzarella.

This recipe is so easy and delicious. My sister i and fell in love with a roasted vegetable dip made by the hummus company, Sabra. We haven't been able to find the dip anywhere in months so I had to take matters into my own hand and create a replacement. I didn't pay much attention to the measurements since this seemed to be a chop-what-you've-got and season-to-taste recipe. I used one whole eggplant, 1 medium red pepper, 1 medium orange pepper, 1 medium sweet onion, 6 gloves of garlic, kosher salt, fresh ground pepper, crushed red pepper flakes, and olive oil. I chopped veggies, seasoned according to recipe (adding a few shakes of red pepper) and roasted everything for 40 minutes, stirring every ten minutes. While the veggies cooled, I pulled the garlic gloves out and mashed before adding them back to the mix. I had chopped the veggies small enough that I didn't do any additional mashing. I finished the dip by adding a bit more salt to taste, red pepper flakes, more crushed garlic, basil, and red wine vinegar. The red wine vinegar really finished this and made it a refreshing topping. This is the perfect replacement to the store bought. I will definitely make this again and try different variations - tomatoes, olives, and/or capers.

I don't give 4 forks to many dishes, but I thought this deserved it. My husband, who loves vegetables but prefers them steamed because he's not crazy about the texture of roasted, even loved it. As others have said, no garlic in the recipe? What, are you kidding me? I threw in about 5 cloves. I also took the other extremely good advice to use more oil (4 Tb) and roast until everything was softer and more caramelized. I love salt, but 3/4 tsp seemed like a lot; I thought it was perfect with 1/2 tsp so I would start with that. I also think the black pepper is pretty important. Finally, my eggplant wasn't quite big enough so I ended up using 9 ounces of eggplant and 3 ounces of shitake mushrooms. Worked beautifully. As a side dish or eaten with crackers or whatever you prefer, I thought this was just outstanding. Enjoy!

Decided to make this as a side dish vs. a spread. Did not have peppers, so chopped in tomato instead. Roasted a little longer to carmelized veggies and served with grilled pork. Topped with shaved parmesean. Yum! And low carb. Will add garlic next time per previous reviewers.

as everyone has said, garlic, garlic, garlic. also, when i cook eggplant i usually use a nice dry white when sauteeing and it adds a delicious flavour to it. i know it says roast but if u could sautee it for a minute or two to let the wine's flavour soak up into the eggplant it really tastes lovely. and def salt and rinse before u cook eggplant. ciao

Thought it was very tasty. I did add a couple cloves of garlic and doubled the amount of extra virgin olive oil...

I didn't care for this as a topping, but I liked the flavors, so I cut the vegetables in larger chunks and otherwise followed the recipe, roasting it a little longer until they were nicely caramelized. I served the result as a side dish with grilled lamb tenderloin. We all liked it - even those who previously avoided eggplant as "too oily"! Oh, and I did add a bit of garlic as suggested by a previous reviewer. I woiuld definitely make this again as a roasted vegetables rather than a topping!

I'm getting ready to make this but had to add a comment - a previous reviewer mentioned an acidic taste. Every recipe that I've ever done with eggplant has you coat the eggplant with salt and let it drain for at least half an hour. I have found this to make a huge difference in mellowing out the eggplant. Also, garlic and parsley are a must.

I noticed some of the other ratings had mentioned something about garlic. I looked back at the recipie after making it, and didn't notice anything about adding garlic. I agree that this dish is not appealing, and did taste somewhat bland. Garlic may have added some flavor to it, but not sure that it would have saved this topping.

This recipe has potential. I did add extra garlic and that helped, but it did seem rather bland and not a very pretty presentation when served on a crostini. I might make it again and try to vary the dish a little.

Didn't have eggplant so added tomato and extra garlic. Another worthy addition was to add a combo of goatcheese and cream cheese to the crostini before adding the vegetables.

The first time I made it , I hadn´t got any peppers, so I made it with tomatoes, and it was better. Try this.

It was good. I didn't add the garlic and I think next time I would. The only problem I add was it seemed to have a very acidic smell before I mashed it. Could that have been the eggplant skin?

My epicurean family loved this as an appetizer for Easter dinner. I added the garlic as recommended.

This is absolutely delicious. My husband and I can't get enough of it! We used a grilled flatbread to accompany and it was a perfect combination.

The aroma alone would make you want to make this dish again. It smells like a really good pizza when you mash it all together. I made this recipe for a very large, formal pary. The event was catered, but I made the hour d'vours to save on cost. This dish definitley tasted as good as the "expensive" food. Best of all, it was very easy and fast to make, even for such a large amount of people.

A very savory dish. Added a bit more olive oil for roasting and tossing vegetables and cooked for 10 minutes longer in the oven which gave the vegetables a more carmelized flavor. Guests loved it!
