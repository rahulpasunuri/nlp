An unusual and yummy combination. Great picnic fare!

Also very nice grilled as a panini!

Tastes great. Serve open-faced so people can see the beautiful mix of colors! I recommend increasing the arugula and using much thinner bread, or even crackers (which would make them more like appetizers, true).

Delightful! I didn't have arugula, so used fresh spinach instead. Worked out great! Carmel, IN - don't fault the recipe if you don't like goat cheese!!

my husband and his friends absolutely adore this recipe and can't wait for my homegrown figs to come into season.

This was a yummy sandwich.It was easy to make and had a wonderful flavor. Accompanied with a mixed green salad it became a great Tuesday night dinner.Definitely will make it again.
