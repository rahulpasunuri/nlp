I read everyone's post and combined some tips to make a beautiful luscious frosting. Cream cheese at room temp, beaters but no other modification. Only used 1 tablespoon of lemon at first and saved the rest. Chilled it for a few hours and asessed whether I needed more liquid right before frosting the cupcakes. Topped with candied violets for a fab platter of cupcakes for a special high school graduation. A major hit with the grads!

I like this recipe because of its relatively low sugar content, but I approached it with some caution, after reading all the reviews about its being runny. So instead of using an electric mixer, I creamed the cheese and lemon curd with a wire whip. If the cheese is truly at room temp, this does not take much effort. After adding all the other ingredients, however, sure enough the icing was a bit looser than I wanted. So I chilled it overnight, and it became just the right spreading consistency. And oh so yummy! Thanks to all the great cooks for taking the time to share your tips.

Believe all the reviews that say this frosting is runny! I more than doubled the powdered sugar and it was still runny, with a consistency more like a glaze. I wouldn't even consider making it again if it didn't taste so fabulous. It may be more suitable for a non-layer cake, as the worst problem was the sliding layers.

I love this frosting. I read the reviews saying it was runny, but it was not. Yes, it's a rather soft frosting, but not at all unmanageable. It's lovely and luxurious.

So I read all the reviews, and decided to chance it. I softened the cream cheese, and added 2 cups of powdered sugar just in case. It had a lovely taste and all, but was soft to spread. I did chill the cake, and it was a pretty smooth finish. Here's my thought: why fuss so much when there are at least 5 other lemon & cream cheese frosting recipes on this one site alone? I won't make this version again.

I used this frosting recipe for a layer cake. Delicious - BUT I did find it to be runny, as noted by other reviewers. My layers where sliding off of eachother -- I started calling my cake "The Leaning Tower of Cake-a." The runniness might have been my fault- I was very ambitious and made my own lemon curd; maybe a store-bought would have been firmer. But since this recipe was so so so tasty, I think I will have to try it again - maybe with a firmer curd, or slightly different proportions.

I have made this frosting ever since I received this issue of Bon Apetit in 1998. It was made along with a lemon layer cake. The frosting is delicious and I have never had a problem with runniness. The ones who had this problem have great suggestions of how to avoid this problem.

I haven't tried this frosting yet but plan on using it for my daughter's birthday celebration at her daycare (cupcakes). It sounds delicious and I know that overbeaten cream cheese coupled with the citric acid from the lemon could make this slippery, but has anyone tried reducing the amount of lemon curd or adding a touch of prepared gelatin to the recipe? I use it all the time to stabilize whipped cream (especially during hot months of the year)

It's so helpful to be able to read the reviews. I softened the Neufchatel cream cheese (yes, I used low fat) in the microwave so it wasn't lumpy and I didn't over-beat. The icing was not runny - it was perfect, and not too sweet. Great. very easy recipe.

Like so many others have reported before me, this icing was 1. delicious and 2. completely runny to the point of hilarity...even refrigerating it didn't really help. I think I know the mistakes I made though...first, I didn't soften the cream cheese sufficiently, so it was lumpy at the lemon curd stage and second, I then over-beat it to try to smooth the lumps out. One of the earlier posts mentions that overbeating the frosting will cause it to be runny...well,, there you go! A case in proof. I'd try it again.

This was one of the best cakes I have ever had. My cooworker made it and I am defnintely going to add it to my recipe collection. Tip: add additonal grated lemon peel for more flavor.

The icing was WONDERFUL. It was a little drippy at first but some time in the refridgerator cleared that up right away.

I have just made this frosting, according to recipe, for the third time and for the third time it was quite scrumptious. Never any problem with runniness. However, in the heat of summer, I promptly put my cake in the fridge immediately after frosting. I use this instead of the white chocolate frosting called for in the lemon-blueberry cake from Bon Appetit's July 2000 issue. (I also cut the sugar in that cake by one half cup...). Try this - just refrigerate!

I made this Frosting for lemon cake from a cake mix. It is not too sweet and it compliments the lemon cake very nicely. Since I read about the runny problem, I put about 3/4 jar of the lemon curd and refrigerated the frosting for about half hour before I frosted the cake. No runny problems, just delicious and easy to spread.

According to Kraft foods (makers of Philadelphia Brand Cream Cheese)any of the following could be reasons for runny icing. Using anything but the full-fat regular brick Philadelphia Brand Cream Cheese. Too much liquid. Overbeating. Cream cheese must be beaten in ONLY until combined. If it is overbeaten, it will stay loose. So by beating longer to thicken, you're exaggerating the problem. My guess is that 2 minutes is WAY too long for this frosting. I have not made it, but my suggestion is to soften the cream cheese first, then lightly beat in the remaining ingredients until just combined. :-)

Despite some of the disastrous reviews, I went ahead and made this frosting for a birthday cake. I should have known better--despite using full fat cream cheese, my frosting also slid down the side of my cake (along with some of the decorative fruit on top). I successfully hid my disaster by sprinkling toasted sliced almonds on the sides. The frosting tasted good, but never again...

I used this frosting with the Lemon Buttermilk cake and it was wonderful! I received so many compliments and the color was perfect. I took the advise of the others and chilled the frosting while the cake was thoroughly cooling. It did not slide, it smoothed to a glossy perfection. I did not, however, include the the lemon rind.

Unusually delicious lemon taste. One problem that I have encountered with a cream cheese frosting, that also slid down the sides of the cake, and it wasn't due to the humidity. REGULAR CREAM CHEESE _MUST_ be used. I thought I could substitute LOW FAT or neuchaftel, it DOESN'T WORK!

I decorate cakes all the time, but this frosting turned out a cake that my husband descibed as "something you'd see as a joke on a sitcom". It slid down the sides of the cake and was very hard to work with. Tasted good, but nothing spectacular. I had the frosting cooled down but then it was hard to spread, as it warmed up enough to work with it started slip-sliding away.

This frosting is absolutely delish and is so good on that four-layer lemon torte. I don't know why anyone would have problems with this frosting "dripping down the cake"? It's three packages of cream cheese whippped with curd... very dense and thick. I had no problems at all. Highly recommended!

Absolutely terrific! You will do well, however, to let the frosting chill a bit before spreading. Yummy!

I had the worst luck with this Cream Cheese Frosting -- it just DRIPPED off the cake. Tried adding confectioner's sugar -- and ended up with tons of drippy frosting that I had to throw out.

This frosting is fabulous. When I have extra, I spread it between graham crackers and freeze them. It's a wonderful treat!
