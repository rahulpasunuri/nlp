Even though I slightly charred the chops, this was great, prepared on the barbecue. As I used the grill, I didn't bother with the butter, and I incorporated chopped fresh thyme into the marinade. I served it with a couscous and some of the Cilantro- Garlic Yogurt Sauce http://www.epicuriou s.com/recipes/food/v iews/240167 which is a variation on Tsaziki. A very middle-eastern, and satisfying meal.
