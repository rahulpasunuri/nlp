This was a nice and easy way to jazz up mashed potatoes. The lemon and the chive really go well together. This is going in my permanant collection.

I love this recipe and have served this version for Thanksgiving for the past couple of years. The only change I make is to use red potatoes; just love the color bonus as I don't peel then and do make more of a 'rustic' mashed potato. I have a food blog and have included a picture here: http://vinolucistyle.com/2009/10/mashed-potatoes-with-lemon-garlic-chives/ I don't get the need to roast garlic as the garlic is sauteed before being added to potatoes; cook just a bit longer if you want to, but I've never had a strong flavor of garlic overpower the dish.

I like the "tart" flavor of these potatoes when serving fish. I do either roast the garlic, or cook it with the boiling potatoes, as the raw taste is too harsh.

I love all the ingredients in this recipes, so no surprise that I loved these potatoes. I also served with fish (citrus grilled salmon) and the lemony flavor complemented the fish very nicely. I didn't have buttermilk, so just used regular whole milk. There's plenty of butter anyway, so I don't think buttermilk is necessary. I made half the recipe, and my husband devoured them. I didn't even get seconds! Next time, I won't put the chives in with the sauted garlic, because I like that little crunch in the potatoes.

As a die hard mashed potato fan, I was VERY sceptical about this recipe, but I was serving fish to guests and wanted an excellent side. By all accounts, this was it! I am definately keeping this recipe!

I think these potatoes are a unique compliment to certain dishes. My husband was kind enough to prepare a Thanksgiving dinner for Canadian Thankgiving and we found that this dish does not really go with turkey, gravy, stuffing, and the works. Although I haven't tried it yet, I would prefer to eat this side with shrimp scampi, pan seared scallops or fish.

I was in a hurry and didn't have lemon peel, so I substituted lemon juice. It still gave it a great flavor. Even my pickiest eater loved it and the only complaint was that I hadn't fixed enough.

I, too, made these per the recipe - they were delicious. If you want to serve a different mashed potato dish, try this one. It was perfect with fish.

As usual, I monkeyed with this recipe a bit. I used roasted garlic for a more subtle flavor, and I used half and half instead of buttermilk, which gives potatoes, I think, a sour or vinegary taste. I also wanted smooth-whipped potatoes rather than mashed; so I baked my potatoes in their skins and then scooped them out and pureed the potato with all of the rest of the ingredients in my processor (freeze the potato skins for other uses). My daughter told me that she would have preferred real mashing to pureeing because she felt the more rustic texture would have added to the dish -- it's a matter of personal taste.

The lemony flavor is definitely what makes these mashed potatoes different from the usual. Very nice.

Amazingly delicious. Excellent with ham on Easter dinner.
