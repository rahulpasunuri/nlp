I thought this was good, but nothing exceptional. Kind of an alternative to a grilled cheese sandwich. I couldn't see serving it to guests, but it's a guilty pleasure when you want something salty and cheesy.

I found this recipe to be completely pedestrian. It was messy, and like the cook from Luxumbourg said, it tasted like a wierd cross between french toast and fried mozzarella (the crappy, cheap bar-food kind). Seems like there must be a better way to make this great dish. Perhaps higher quality bread, perhaps less egg, I don't know. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Oh, and by the way, insulting other cooks just seems so ridiculous, counterproductive and utterly unnecessary.

Decidedly messy to make (the capers kept escaping while I was cutting off the crusts) this was a recipie I used for dinner, rather than an appetizer. I made 1 1/2 sandwiches per person, and then topped them w/fresh diced tomatoes. Wickedly rich!

I needed to make an appetizer fast and had all the ingredients for these. I thought they were pretty good. I did'nt have quite as much cheese as was called for, next time I will use the full amount. I liked the cheese and caper combo. I often do a similar thing with proscuitto and manchego that we love.

Stuffy Europeans aside, I really liked this dish. I did not have capers on hand, but I don't feel that they are really necessary. It is messy, but if you squish the edges of the bread together after coating in the egg mixture, you'll have no problem keeping the cheese in its place. Overall this is a great afternoon snack. I serve it to my boyfriend with a spot of tea!

My previous experience with this dish was something truly sumptuous and decadent. This was a weak cross between french toast (with no maple syrup) and croque monsieur. I followed the recipe quite exactly and found it messy and difficult to keep the cheese inside the bread. I will look for a better verison.
