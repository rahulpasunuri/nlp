I followed this recipe quite closely, and was mystified to find that the end result was really quite bland. That surprised me, as porcinis, goat cheese, and the vinaigrette are all quite flavourful ingredients on their own, but there was definitely something missing in terms of flavour in the final product. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't great.

Unless I missed something, if you start with 1/2C of liquid, it is not possible to reduce to 2/3C liquid as stated in the sauce recipe. Sooo, I added 1/2 C of the porcini soaking liquid & reduced at that time. Much better. I loved this! Love that you can do components ahead of time.Earthy and rich. Going on my list!!

Used onions instead of shallots. Excellent. Easy to make. Guest left with recipe! Nice balance of flavors.
