Delicious! We halved the time the celery root cooked (by doing a taste test as they cooked) and they were just right. I have never eaten celery root before and was very curious, and the flavor and texture exceeded my expectations. What a great comfort food. You could even skip out on the other veggies and just roast the celery root with a little olive oil and salt and you'll never need to eat french fries again!

This vegetable dish was one of four I served on Thanksgiving, and it was probably the best. I made it the day before, shortening the overall roasting time by about ten minutes as suggested by another reviewer. Then on the big day I just stuck it cold in a 350 degree oven for about 25 minutes. The mushrooms stole the show. Their texture was excellent, juicy, tender, yet slightly chewy. I was skeptical about the amount of salt called for, thinking it was a bit too much, but it turned out to be perfect. I couldn't get fresh sage, so I used dried, which worked out fine.

This dish was easy to prepare and tasted delicious. In my opinion, the more mushrooms you add the better (I added portobello and oyster mushrooms in addition to the white mushrooms). To make this dish in advance, save 10 -15 minutes of cooking until just before serving.

A big success for Thanksgiving. It was a wonderful change from my usual celery root purees.

If you already like celery root you'll love this recipe! My grandmother always made celery root salad for our Italian holiday dinner, but when I found this roasted celery root recipe I knew I'd have to try it out. I'm glad I did!

This dish was easy to prepare and made a generous amount, but it was my first (and probably last!) experience with celery root. I just didn't like it! I might make it again and substitute potatoes for the celery root.
