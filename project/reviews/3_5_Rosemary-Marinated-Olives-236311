So simple and reasonably priced. I chopped up some sun dried tomatoes in olive oil and cubed up some feta to add to the mix. Yummy

A solid recipe for marinated olives. I stuffed mine with goat cheese & slivered almonds. While this did result in a pretty salty dish, a drizzle of good fruity olive oil & some lemon zest evened it out nicely.

I've made these for years, add a tablespoon of good vodka as a preservative; for parties I marinate with thinly sliced lemons for a beautiful presentation

Great make-ahead idea - and so easy! My guests were raving about these olives (how often does that happen?), and now I get the leftovers for yummy martinis. I don't know why I didn't think of doing this myself ages ago, but I will definitely use this recipe - with variations - for entertaining on a regular basis.

A question: the olives with or without their brine? I'm making mine with kaffir lime zest, tarragon, and garlic. My preview olive tasted good--will keep marinating.
