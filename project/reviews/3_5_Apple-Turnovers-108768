BEST AND EASIEST RECIPE EVER! my 12 year old daughter made this in about 20 mins all by herself.

I too doubled the filling and I used 10 sheets of filo per turnover instead of 20 (20 sheets are in a roll). Then I cut the stacks in half and filled the 4 sections. Because the pieces were rectangular instead of square i brought all 4 corners of the filo to the center and sealed the pastries that way. I subbed raisins for the cranberries and lemon curd plus a little brown sugar for the apple jelly (as that's what I had on hand). These were wonderful and easy to make. I'll definitely make them again.

For another fruit option: I only had a couple hail damaged peaches so I skinned and cut them into 1/2 inch peices, added some chopped walnuts, dried ground ginger and a tablespoon or so of tapioca. They were wonderful.

To bozzo27 sounds like you used Filo dough instead of Puff pastry. There is a big difference in the two products. Try it again, it is worth the effort. I also tried this recipes with blueberries.

The filling was good but I am not sure what I did wrong with the puff pastry. I had frozen pastry and was not sure how many sheets to use. I used about 1/4 inch thickness worth of sheets. They were dry and didn't stick together even with a fork pressing them together. When I tried moistening them with water so they would stick together, they began to peel. I was under the impression that frozen puff pastry was easy to work with but I had a hard time and therefore wouldnt try this again. There is probably nothing wrong w/ this recipe, I just didn't know what I was doing.

I doubled the apples mixture for this recipe and next time I might triple --but I like turnovers with lots of filling --That said, this recipe was so easy --puff pastry is a great secret quick ingredient! --anyway these were a big hit.

This was a huge hit at our house! I made them for brunch on morning, and they were gone in seconds! The only problem I had was that the recipe is very scant. So i think I'll double it next time. But other then that, they were fantastic! I threw in some powdered chai tea mix, delicious!
