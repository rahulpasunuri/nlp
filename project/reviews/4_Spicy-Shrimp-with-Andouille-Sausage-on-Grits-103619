I just made the sauce and put it on the shrimp and grits. I thought it was delicious. Mr. Picky thought it was ok.

This was fantastic! Usually when I cook anything I have at least one "it needed a little more of this or less of that" criticism, but not this time; the dish was basically perfect! I used chicken andouille and stone ground white (corn) grits, both from Trader Joe's. I also added some fresh scallions from my herb garden. I'll be making this again!

Honestly, this is the best shrimp and grits EVER. I will admit, I skipped over some of the instructions reading and just threw all the hot sauce ingredients in a pan and simmered them a while. It was amazing, though, and very easy. If you're in a hurry, just do that! I made this for a good friend on my first night in my new home - it goes well with champagne and sitting cross-legged on the kitchen floor! I will be making it again and again - as early as next week for visiting family, who I'm sure will appreciate the southern flair.

This was the best shrimp and grits I have ever had without a doubt. I forgot to add the tomatoes, but did throw in a handful of fresh spinach, kale, and bokchoy mix. I have raved about this recipe to everyone who will listen, and will definitely make it again.

I live in a town where fabulous shrimp and grits can be easily found, but none hold a candle to this recipe. Outstanding! The only thing I added to the grits was some smokey gouda, which really emphasized the complexity of flavors, but I'm guessing that even without the addition, this would still be a definite keeper.

Made with Tabasco green sauce. Baked the grits (Quaker quick grits) for 1 hr at 350 F. Served with braised beet greens. I like polenta but think grits are better for the spicy cream sauce.

I like to serve with pasta instead of the grits. The sauce is really good.

I've made this many times, and we both love it! The first time I made the hot pepper/cream sauce exactly as written and it was good, but not enough to justify the time and ingredients. Since then I've always made the sauce with green hot pepper sauce (I use Tabasco Jalapeno) and cream. It's yummy and much quicker than reducing all those other ingredients. You can also save time by using instant polenta, which cooks much quicker, making this an easy work night meal.

Made this for a Sunday brunch and it was awesome. I did forget to add the cream to the green pepper sauce but added it when re-warming to serve. There were a lot of grits.....so I am having polenta fries with red pepper ketchup for dinner this evening (also on epicurious.)

As a native South Carolinian, I've been eating shrimp and grits all my life. Guess you could say I'm a bit of an expert. This recipe is wonderful! I made it for my Gourmet Club for our "Eat Local" night, and it was a HUGE hit. Made 2 small adjustments: (1) I couldn't find andouille sausage at the local farmer's market, so I substituted chorizo, and it was delicious; (2) I used grits with fontina cheese (from another recipe). I will definitely be making this again!

I made this for my book club themed dinner. The book was "The Help". It was everyone's favorite part of the meal; awesome. Would definitely make it again.

Rating: 3
I am giving this 2 reviews: 4 forks for deliciousness, but less forks because (1) it took so freaking long to make (more of a weekend meal than a weeknight dinner) and (2) I had to use so many pans. Obviously this is a small price to pay for culinary sublimity, but it took almost as long to wash all the dishes as it did to cook the darn thing. That being said: I made my own cajun seasoning, followed the directions for cooking the grits on the grits container, added a jalapeño, and I used fat free half and half instead of whipping cream. Truly, truly delicious.

Having grown up in coastal Georgia, I have eaten shrimp and grits my whole life. This is one of the best versions I have eaten! Followed the recipe almost exactly. I used Louisiana hot sauce instead of the green sauce because I like the flavor better. I also used stone grits and grated fresh Parmesan cheese into the grits just before they finished. This recipe will become a regular in the rotation. My girlfriend and I almost ate ourselves sick it was so good.

Rating: 4
Wow. Just made this recipe for my boyfriend's 28th birthday. We're both from the south, living in nyc. Boy was this a treat. I cut the recipe in half... it would have easily fed 4 people. I couldn't find green hot pepper sauce at two consecutive grocers (whole foods! and key foods.. shame on ya'll) so I just used red Louisiana hot sauce and it worked like a charm. This is a decadent, delicious dish meant for special occasions. If I make it again, I'm using skim milk and maybe substituting greek nonfat yogurt for some of that cream.

Rating: 3
I cut the recipe in half and made it for two. It was really outstanding. I didn't remember to pick up heavy cream at the store, so I skipped the first step (with the green pepper sauce and shallots). It was still delicious. We used the green pepper sauce on the side. I will make it again.

found this recipe on Epicurious,read the reviews. Made it tonight and served it to a dinner party of six. Rave, I mean Rave copliments, from some very tough critics. Will make again and again. Great flavor! I doubled the sauce. and I added extra shrimp, for six per person.I always use mill ground grits from Tenn. I cook them in Chicken broth and then add in cream and then Asiago cheese.

Rating: 4
This was exceptional, but VERY rich. I added in the chevre as suggested by a previous reviewer, and I wish I hadn't. The richness of the shrimp/andouille topping needed something to offset it. The grits would have been better as written. I used Aidell's andouille which had a kick, but not too spicy. I also used wild-caught Carolina shrimp (in season) which taste way better than farmed shrimp from those muck farms in SE Asia. The final taste will depend on the quality of your ingredients (duh) and this was delicious. My children loved it as well. For us, it served 8 and we have grits left over.

Rating: 0
Very good S&G recipe. Very rich and heavy, but a crowd pleaser. The pepper sauce is partiularly nice and can be used in other recipes. I use stone cut grits mixed with about a cup of cheese (something hard and nutty like romano or asiago). Regular grits cook quickly and are more authentic than polenta.

Rating: 4
This is awesome...just made a few changes. I didn't make the hot pepper sauce, and sprinkled applewood smoked bacon, white cheddar cheese and smoky barbeque sauce on top of the plates before serving. Passed red and green tabasco on the side.

Rating: 2
I thought the dish was too tangy with the wine, vinegar, lemon juice and hot sauce. You could just increase the cajun spice then add straight cream at the end to the sauteed veggies and meat. Serve with lemon or tabasco if you want to add a little tang.

Rating: 2
Used McIlhenny green (jalapeno) tabasco for the sauce, and found the result too vinegary, with a taste I just didn't enjoy. Followed the recipe exactly, though I doubled it to serve 20 as an appetizer portion. Had WAY too much (too many?) grits. Normally I like spicy, but these flavors were harsh. Not a repeat for me.

TRY THIS!! I have made it many times and it's always a show stopper. Don't skip the hot sauce part, it's what sets this apart from the many other shrimp and grits recipes out there. By far the best one I have had on this site or any other.

Great meal but made a couple of changes the second time. I had to cut the pepper back for my kids and my wife preferred it over white rice. It made it a little more cajun... i guess. I also used Chorizo because i couldn't find the andoullie (i wrecked that word). And by the way... What is a grit? [from my cousin vinny]

Excellent! Followed the recipe exactly - eccept increased seasonings and had polenta instead of grits and reduced the amount of that. The green pepper sauce makes it special. Served four with (sadly) no leftovers.

Rating: 3
This was very good... even the leftover (and I am not a fan of leftovers) I have to be honest, I didn't reduce the hot pepper sauce mixture. I just added the the shallots to the other vegetables and sausage. When that was done I tossed in the shirmp with white wine, green pepper sauce and a little cream and butter. It was awesome. If actually following directions can make this even better it'll be outstanding. BTW, here is my favorite no fail Pepper Spiked Polenta from My Recipies. No fuss and done in 12 minutes. Coat a 2-quart casserole with cooking spray. Combine water (4c), cornmeal (1c), salt, and red pepper flakes; mix well. Cover with casserole lid; microwave at HIGH 12 minutes or until thick, stirring after 6 minutes. Stir in parm cheese to your liking. Serve immediately.

Absolutely fabulous! I have made this several times and decided to serve it to first-time guests last night. They were blown away!

I love Cajun food and this dish is at the top of the list. Not only is this recipe full of flavor, it's forgiving of substitutions, which makes it just about perfect. I reluctantly used the Italian sausage I had in the fridge instead of the andouille, and it was still delicious. The sauce had a bit more heat than my family enjoys, so I tamed it a bit by doubling the cream. If you're wary of spice, I'd suggest keeping some additional cream on hand to adjust.

Fantastic, Awesome! I followed the recipe exactly. I am also not a big fan of grits (probably never made them right) but these turned out OK, would not make as much next time, and would try adding the chevre cheese as another person mentioned, thought they could use something and maybe I would like them more. Also would double the cream sauce, was not hot at all and could have used a little more. This is definetly a great recipe! Will make again very soon!

Wow! Listening to other reviewers is the secret. Used Polenta, skim milk, Parmesan cheese. Terrific. For shrimp mixture, butterflied shrimp, used Linguica, a Portugese sausage, Loui's Louisiana hot sauce(red). Cooked nuggets of sausage for two minutes; added shrimp which had been shook in a plastic bag with Penzey's Cajun spice and Bay seasoning and cooked for two minutes; added onion and cooked for two minutes; added green and yellow pepper and sliced, stewed, Roma tomatoes for two minutes. That was it!

I do not like grits. Was hoping this recipe would change my mind. Didn't happen. However, the shrimp with andouille is absolutely delicious. And the hot pepper sauce was a very nice accent. Will certainly cook again but with RICE! :-)

This was phenomenal. Exactly how shrimp & grits should taste. I used Sriracha sauce for half of the hot sauce in the hot sauce mixture, and it complemented the taste really well. For the grits, I used instant grits that I boiled in a combo of cream and water. Then I mixed in a 4-5 oz. pack of chevre cheese (for 4 servings). This was something I learned from a Chef at the Ritz-Carlton. It makes the grits extra creamy (they even reheat well) and the chevre tastes pretty mild with all the other rich flavors. I will make this dish again and again. Probably my favorite on the site!

An awesome dish! Fine dining brought into your home. Company will love it. Nice spice...enough grits (I would call it polenta)for six but not enough of the rest for six. The green sauce is a lovely touch. This one is a keeper!

My husband said that if he ate this in a restaurant, he would go back the next night and have it again! I used something called Iguana Mean Green Sauce because that is the spiciest green sauce that my store had. It was perfect! I served it on mashed potatoes, not at all Southern, I know, but just what my family likes. I fried the andouille separately to give it a nice crisp. Next time, I will increase the amount of andouille. A really great dinner.

I served this dish at a dinner party and did not have any of the left overs I had planned!! A huge hit all around. This is a little different than your standard low country shrimp, cheese grits, and bacon...there's more to its prep and the sauce is GREEN! It definitely takes some time to prepare. I'd would strongly advise making the sauce the day before if you're serving it to guests. I was skeptical of the bright green sauce, so I served it on the side. Everyone loved it though and I should have just served it on the dish. I also added shredded cheese to the grits before serving which was a nice addition.

I have made this dish 3 times now since I last wrote about the onions in Aug -- and I have to say it is a fabulous recipe! Last night we tripled it for 12 people and they pretty much wiped it out. When I cleared the table some of the plates had been wiped so clean of sauce that it almost looked like they had not eaten dinner. One guest sat in a daze the rest of the night muttering, 'that was the best meal I have EVER had...EVER.' The only tweak is I use Durkees hot sauce (red) rather than green, and maybe green peppers instead of a yellow. We learned last night that it can be made ahead and reheated with no adverse effect and it makes for very easy entertaining. If you like spicy food AT ALL you will love this recipe.

haven't made it yet, but if it is as good as the version I had at the Bistro 1896 in Asheville, NC it will be a keeper. Stupid question before I attempt it: how much minced onion does it call for? the font it displays in on my PC makes the number into some funky squiggle character. I figure it is just my settings since I saw no other ratings mention it. I can swag it but thought I would ask.

This was fantastic! I used quick grits because it was all I could find at the store and milk instead of cream (trying to make it lighter). I was skeptical at first - didn't think my husband would go for the grits, but he loved it and requested it as part of our regular dinner rotations. This was very easy to make, full of flavor, and not as heavy as one might think.

This is sooooo good. A truly excellent restaurant quality dish suitable to impress any lovers of "cajun" cuisine. Really so good and satisfying. Comfort Food for sure.

My husband and I loved this. I used green tobasco and creole seasoning, and thought it had only a little kick. Next time, will make my own cajun spice mix to add and find a hotter green pepper sauce. The sauce was ok on its own, but really complimented the dish. I used large shrimp (16-20 per pound), 1 1/2 pounds total, and this easily served 6. And I agree that Andouille sausage is the only way to go.

Used the "milder" green Tabasco, and only 1/2t of the Cajun seasoning, and it was still plenty spicy, so definitely add the heat gradually. A delicious dish, fit for company; the cream sauce is the crowning touch. Only used green peppers, still great.

This dish is wonderful, but beware -- it is very, very rich! We followed the recipe exactly, and the result was beyond divine. However, it'll be a long time before we want to see grits again -- and we're true grits-loving Southerners. They are almost too creamy, resulting in a dish that is heavier than we would like. The next time, we'll use more water/chicken broth, less milk/cream -- or maybe lower fat milk. In any event, it's well worth fiddling around with, becuase the recipe is terrific! The hot peppery sauce is especially great, and a nice contrast to the mildness of the grits and the flavors of the shrimp mixture. Note: Although the receipe suggests substitutions for andouille, I think andouille would be crucial here (we had it and used it) -- I can't see any substitution being comparable.

We use to have a condo on Isle of Palms and for years the Boathouse was just one of our favorite restaurants. I've made this recipe twice, first time I didn't have the andouille, the old bay or the green pepper sauce. Made the sauce with tabasco and also for a quick meal just used instant grits for cheesey grits. Second time followed the recipe exactly for a dinner party. Our friends want to know when we're all going to the Lowcountry.

Not knowing what "green hot pepper sauce" actually is, we substituted Tabasco Green Pepper sauce and adjusted the heat to taste. We also guessed that we needed about 1 cup of onions. After that we stuck to the recipe. My family and out guest loved it and voted 4 forks; I liked it a lot but not quite so much. The sauce (probably due to the substitution) did not thrill me although it was very good as a topping. This recipe is definitely a repeater!!

Rating: 4
only made a few substitutions - used white (long-cooking, not quick or instant) Jim Dandy grits, chicken broth instead of water, and added some grated parmesan cheese right before serving. we in the heart of dixie are picky about our grits! made everything else as stated in recipe - this dish is awesome! will make it many times again!

Sausage & Shrimp & Grits? Oh my! Sauteed the shallots a bit before saucing and used Emeril's mix to kick it up to notches unknown. Adding salt to the grits is a habit. If there had been no hominy grits (as if!), I would've used polenta - not the same but a highly plausable substitute. Zingerman's on-line sometimes carries grits from Anson Mills - A1!

I made this for a Mardi Gras dinner, and it was perfect. The only thing I did differently was to add about a cup of grated parmesan to the grits when they were almost done cooking. Also, you really should at least salt the grits, otherwise they will be pretty bland. Low-fat or even skim milk is a reasonable substitution for whole milk. You'll still get the creaminess from it, without the fat.

This is fabulous!!! The only changes I will make the next time is to read the corn meal package(couldn't find polenta)for cooking time since the kind I used was good, but cooked in 5 minutes rather than 30, AND to salt and pepper the corn meal grits after preparing them--they were a bit bland. Otherwise a stellar recipe. It will become our New Year's Day tradition.

After a trip to North Carolina, had something similar at a restaraunt on the coast. Tried this recipe and is much better. Unfortunately, I used green taco sauce, which could have been hotter. I could only find quick grits, and should have cooked them longer to make them creamer. All in all this dish was great. I used the peppers and tomatoes from my garden. Great recipe!

I made this for Mothers' Day and it was a great meal. Since there were 7 of us I doubled everything except the grits and ended up with about 1 or 2 servings left over. Also, I used chicken andouille instead of pork. The cream sauce is very good but pretty spicey, so use it according to your taste. I had to use instant grits because I couldn't find anything else and they worked just fine. I cooked them for the hour as directed but at a low setting. I will definitely make this again.

My husband's new favorite recipe. He loves polenta, I historically have not. I hoped for the best and I was pleasantly surprised! The recipe is very good but serves 4 at the most. You will have left over polenta which can be chilled in a form and grilled for another meal. I used roasted red peppers one time when I didn't have fresh peppers on hand and was pleased with the results. I made the hot-pepper cream sauce with a smaller amount of red pepper sauce (tobasco) and liked that too.
