I've been making ice cream all summer and this was such a fruity favorite! Used about 6 plums and didn't have the wine but it was still very flavorful. Subbed 1/4 maple syrup for the corn syrup. Was a great consistency after about 30 minutes in my ice cream maker.

Yum! I made this on a 100-degree day, and it was perfectly light and refreshing. Not wanting to go to the store in the heat, I used what I had on hand -- orange-pineapple juice instead of orange juice, agave nectar (1/4 cup) instead of corn syrup and no orange peel or plum wine. Despite the substitutions, it was delicious. I will definitely make this again.

This was a delicious sherbert! I had some plums that were on the verge of going bad. My guests thought it was just perfect for a hot day! Love it and will be repeating this for sure.

I agree with Ronni in that the orange flavour is pretty strong; however, it is still wonderful sherbet. I used port as I was too lazy to hunt for some plum wine. I just wish I discovered this recipe at the beginning of plum season rather than at the end.

This was a wonderful way to finish off a Japanese style supper! I have only two comments though: The orange juice is a bit overpowering reminding me of a orange creamsicle with a "fruitier" flavor. Sherbets (or sherbert) and ice cream take much longer to freeze when there is alcohol added to the mixture. You might want to add the plum wine as it's mixing in the maker, or just save it to drizzle onto the dessert. Relatively easy and definitely worth making. Great texture and wonderfully exotic.

Fantastic. Very easy. I used canned plums with juice, because the fresh weren't ripe. My company loved it!!

I didn't know an ice cream maker was so difficult to use... However, the sherbet turned out great. I made this as the dessert to accompany a japanese meal & the guests loved the idea that it was homemade.

Since when is sherbet spelled with two R's?
