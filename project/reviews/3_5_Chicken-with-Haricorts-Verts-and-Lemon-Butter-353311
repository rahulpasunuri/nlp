While I wouldn't be as brutal as the cook from Naperville, I think that this is good but definitely not great. That said, I'll make it again because it's fast and easy. If your haricots aren't the really, really teeny ones, they won't cook in the allotted time, so plan on more time or maybe even parboiling to give them a head start (mine were the somewhat thicker ones from Trader Joe's and didn't cook enough). Also, I think this needs more liquid; next time I'll add a few tablespoons of chicken broth; maybe that will help cook the beans. I pounded the chicken to give it a more uniform thickness so it cooked more evenly. A good, quick weeknight meal and just one pan to wash.

Brined the chicken as those before mentioned. Left out lemon and chives and added more butter. Really good! and the kids even liked it. Will make this again for sure.

Just made this with brussel sprouts b/c I had them and not green beans - its fantastic. I followed directions for the chicken then after removing it I added chopped shallots, quarteres brussel sprouts and the rest. Didn't have chives so I used basil and green onions for a little extra flavor. Its great.

Nothing special, like something an aspiring bride learns in home ec to prove they really can cook... Lemon pepper the chicken (sans flour) and bake it. In a separate pan make a reduction of chicken broth, white wine, lemon, butter. Blanche the beans and toss with butter, salt pepper and a hint of lemon. Finish off the wine. Done!

A new family favorite! The lemon is not too much. I actually made the green beans separately and served with tomatoes and corn on the cob. Perfect for summer!

This was really delicious, and with the lemon, a good summer dish. I would recommend adding the shallots half-way through the chicken's cooking; mine got burned. Also, remember to remove the tenderloin piece on the breast, or it takes too long. I added 1/4 C. water when the bean were simmering, and this helped cook them.

This was both fantastic in taste and easy to make! I skipped the chives, and am not sure if they would be worth it, it it such a great dish without them. I haven't had it with them, so I guess I can't judge.

I made this with green beans and skin-on boneless chicken thighs... wow. It was great. I love simple recipes in which the final product is more than the sum of its parts and this was that. I did brine the chicken. Very tasty.

This absolutely goes into my rotation! Healthy, beautiful and delicious, the lemon zest just raises the flavor to a new level. I love this dish!

This is a wonderful spring dish-simple and delicious. I couldn't find haricots verts, so I made it with green beans. I brined the chicken breasts-as I always do for chicken dishes.
