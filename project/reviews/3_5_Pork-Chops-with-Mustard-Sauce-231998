This was fantastic. Made a couple of changes. While the pork was in the oven, went ahead and cooked shallots. Instead of broth, used some pan drippings that I had from a chicken I roasted last week to which I added some water. Stirred in the mustard and instead of cream, added goat cheese (about 2TB). Then added drippings from the pan along with the lemon! WOW what a sauce!

Made a couple of changes to the sauce. While the meat was cooking in the oven and cooked the shallots until tender. I then added chicken stock (from the pan from a chicken I had roasted last week) and cooked for about 5 min. After adding the mustard, I then added 2TB of goat cheese instead of cream and stirred until it thickened. Lastly I added the lemon juice. WOW... what a sauce. Pork was tender and juicy and with the sauce I had to give it 4 forks.

Very good recipe, must like mustard. We used Stone Ground mustard instead of dijon but it was awesome!!

Rating: 4
Excellent for easy and quick! I suggest you must be a mustard fan to enjoy it, as it has a strong mustard flavor...but it's also a bit sweet. (Not sure where that comes from, other than the mustard.) No problem making it a thick sauce, which I like and often have trouble doing. I even lightened it a bit with extra chicken broth. I'll keep this for an easy way to serve pork chops.

This is an outstanding pork chop mustard sauce! I have found myself making it to accompany pork tenderloin as well. It is absolutely delicious. I highly recommend giving this one a try.

I made this recipe exactly except with half and half, as with most others didn't have cream on hand. It was delicious. The pork was cooked just right and still delicious. Pan browning time was between 3-4 min per side. This recipe is easy and delicious. I made the sauce a second time that week and free styled the measurements still great. Served with mixed rice with sauteed onion, black beans, and parmesan, and a side salad. Next time will try with rosemary potatoes.

What a delicious recipe and so quick to make! I didn't have any heavy cream so used creme fraiche instead - I thought, with the lemon juice, it made it a wee bit too sour, so I'll use the cream next time. The children didn't care for the sauce so I just served it on the side.

Made this for my dad and siblings over Winter Break from school and they couldn't get enough. I appreciated how simple both the ingredients and cooking are. Only change was adding fresh rosemary after the shallots. Served with cornbread and roasted carrots. Made a whole bunch, as Dad never cooks and wanted a ton of leftovers...I found myself sneaking bites from the fridge the next day!

Made this exactly as the recipe directed and it was great! I love cooking with mustard. Usually my wife is not big on mustard - especially Dijon - but she loved this dish. I worried it would be too tangy but the broth tones it down well.

This is a great recipe in terms of breaking up the monotony of everyday cooking. We have made it numerous times and everyone always enjoys it. The one thing we do occassionally add though is sliced mushrooms, assuming we have some extras lying around. We just saute them with the shallots,but it is a delicious dish either way.

This recipe was fantastic! I wanted something that had nearly everything I had around the house, and this was the closest I could come up with. I wound up using mushrooms, not shallots and brown mustard instead of dijon, but it was delicious! Even my husband, the picky eater loved it! I will try it with the shallots and dijon the next time I make pork. We were both impressed at how moist the pork was and how tasty the sauce came out. I'll definitely be making this again--except, next time with the right ingredients!!!

This is a good down-home recipe with a kick of mustard. I did not add the lemon at the end, and it turned out fine.

This recipe is quick, simple and delicious. The mustard I used had plenty of vinegar to it so I would recomend adding lemon juice to taste (I used none). I also tented the pork chops after browning and they were cooked through, they would have been very overdone if I had put them in the oven as well.

Rating: 4
Tasty--loved the sauce...I added more chicken broth than the recipe--just so there would be extra sauce. And I added dried rosemary. SO easy and delicious. The only downer was that the pork took longer than the recipe (in the oven)...maybe my chops were too thick.

Rating: 2
The only change I made to this recipe was to use boneless loin pork chops from the butcher. The meat was tasteless, and was definitely not overcooked. The sauce, which helped rescue the meat was much too "in your face" mustardy. I'm removing this from my recipe box.

Rating: 4
The sauce was easy to make and was totally delicious. It complimented the pork perfectly. I used regular rather than country style mustard to end up with a less grainy sauce and I used about two thirds of the recommended mustard.

Rating: 4
This probably doesn't need another good review, but I was amazed how EASY and QUICK this was to prepare. Not too mustardy for us and I followed the recipe. The only substitution I made was 2% milk instead of cream and garlic for shallots because this was a last minute search for a mid-week dinner and that is what I had on hand. I'm sure cream would make it extra spectacular! My kids (who don't like mustard) also loved it.

I agree that this recipe probably doesn't need to have a single thing changed - but I had no chicken stock or shallots on hand so I substituted white wine and garlic respectively (I also added Thyme as suggested!).

This recipe has become a standard part of the rotation at my house. I read the reviews and made some of the suggested changes. First of all, I just brown the pork on the stove and skip the baking step. For the sauce, I substitute Vidalia sweet onions for the shallots as I don't generally keep them on hand. I also add a couple of cloves of minced garlic. While cooking the onions and garlic, I add 1/4 tsp. of ground thyme per another cooks suggestion. I have prepared it with both a creamy Dijon and a more grainy mustard, both are good, but I do prefer the grainy mustard preparation. As recommended, I halved the amount of mustard and sometimes add a tbsp. of white wine or dry sherry as well. I also substitute balsamic vinegar for the lemon juice because I don't usually keep fresh lemons on hand in the winter. Be careful of the vinegar proportions, start with 1/2 tsp. and adjust as necessary. Because I love the sauce, I usually prepare a double batch.

I guess it is a matter of "different strokes".... we thought that (without changing the tiniest little thing) that the recipe is superb. Delicious!

With all the suggestions for changes, I decided to try the recipe as is. It is delicious. Onions are not a good substitute for shallots as they contain too much sugar and would change the nature of the sauce.

To those who think the sauce is too mustardy take a cue from the cook from Silicon Valley and reverse the measurements on the cream and mustard. Use 1/4 cup cream and 2 T of mustard instead of the opposite. We did and the sauce came out PERFECTLY! Practically worth licking off the plate. Will definitely add this to the mid-week repertoire.

With baked sweet potatoes, broccoli and some applesauce, this makes an easy, pleasant meal. I was out of country-style Dijon so used a mixture of regular Dijon and Inglehoffer stone ground. Perhaps that's why I thought the sauce was a bit too mustardy. Next time, I'll use the listed mustard.

Agreed with the reviewer who thought the mustard flavor was too strong. Maybe it is the type of mustard; I used smooth Dijon. Worth making again but I would double cream, halve mustard and add garlic with the onions. Thyme is a good additional also.

My husband brought home pork chops, so I logged in for ideas. I didn't have a lemon, scallions, or cream, so substituted pantry items--cider vinegar, garlic and whole fat plain greek yogurt. After reading the last two reviews, I mostly pan fried (and accidentally scorched) the pork, leaving only a few minutes to finish in the oven (in which I was roasting carrots, broccoli and rainbow Swiss chard to serve with it). I used around 3 tbs regular dijon, and 1/2 to 2/3 cup yogurt. I added dill to the sauce for an extra flavor, worrying that the cider vinegar alone wouldn't provide the kick of lemon juice. Result? We will definitely make it again--hopefully without scorching... The sauce is wonderful with pork, and great with vegetables, too.

To the previous reviewer: brown the chops on a skillet set to medium high heat, not in the oven. Besides that, good recipe. Solid. I prefer to flatten boneless chops and just cook them on the pan w/o the oven step-- quicker and easier!

Rating: 1
There's something wrong with this recipe. There is no way that one is going to brown pork chops in a pan in the oven set to 325 degrees. The Dijonaise Sauce with Shallots has the proportions of Diijon and cream almost perfectly reversed. It overpowers the delicate flavor of the pork and the shallots become nothing but an interesting texture in the omipotent flavor of mustard. I wouldn't use this recipe again if the ingredients were free. My advice? Pan fry the pork chops over medium-high heat, about 5 minutes per side or until cooked through. Keep warm on a platter covered with foil. Saute 2 tsp flour and shallots in butter until soft, whisk in 2tbsp dijon, lemon juice, and 1/2 cup cream.

This recipe is excellent simple and packed with a flavor punch. The pork chops came out moist, slightlty pink and wonderful. Its a keeper.

Thought this was easy and delicious midweek meal. Used no butter or oil, just cooking spray. Per other reviewers, added mushrooms with shallots. Instead of dirtying another pan to put pork in oven, after making sauce I put the chops back in the sauce, covered, and let simmer for 5 minutes. Also, didn't use cream - and didn't miss it all. Served over fresh fettucini. Delish.

Sauteed the shallots in butter in a seperate pan, then added back to the pork chop pan with what remained after frying (fat & all).

The 1/4 cup of Dijon mustard was a bit overpowering. The next time I will use no more than 2 tablespoons. I am also going to try the addition of mushrooms. This dish goes well with roasted vegetables,(zuccini, yellow squash, onion, cauliflower, carrots, tiny new potatoes or any other veggies you have, cut in 1" pieces. Mix with olive oil (about 2 tablespoons) season with salt and pepper and bake at 400 degrees for 25 minutes.) Great served with a California Viognier or Fume Blanc!
