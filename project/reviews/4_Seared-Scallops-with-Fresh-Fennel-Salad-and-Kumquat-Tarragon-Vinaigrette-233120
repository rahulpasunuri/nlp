This dressing is phenomenal! It was really good with the combination of salad ingredients here, and I had some leftover that I used on a regular lettuce salad - also good.

Very nice dressing indeed. However I did not love the salad and the scallops together, too much of the same taste. I did like them individually though. Next time, I'll probably make the dressing just for the scallops and serve them just with fingerling potatoes. Dressing modifications: much less olive oil, a little less mustard, meyer lemon juice instead of vinegar and fresh orange juice instead of concentrate.

Fantastic dressing! My first experience with kumquats and now I'm psyched to try more!

I had friends over for dinner last night and I wanted to to make a nice, fancy and tasty appetizer. So I made this recipe and they loved it! The kumquat dressing with the scallops is a really nice combination and you can use this vinaigrette with another salads as well!

I picked some scallops on sale @ Loblaws, looked for a recipe, came upon this one and I must say This was fabulous. It is a keeper. Very easy, quick and tasty.

This is so good. I'm on a Kumquat kick before they go out of season in a few weeks. Make the vinaigrette with 1 cup of oil and then taste because with more oil it loses it's tartness. Once I figured out that this is cole slaw it was easy to put together. I separated all of the radicchio leaves painstakingly and then read that they are quartered and thinly sliced! The fennel doesn't need to be cored either. This has such a nice flavor and compliments the scallops well for a dinner party starter but the salad on it's own would hold up and be great for a picnic or buffet too. I made the whole recipe not realizing that it really serves 8. My husband ate the whole thing and I thought he was going to try and drink the remaining vinaigrette!
