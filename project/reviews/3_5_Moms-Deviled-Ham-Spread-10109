I'm not sure I should review this recipe since I substituted Tabasco sauce (several shakes) for the habanero, omitted the Worcestershire sauce, salt (hello! ham!) and pepper, and added some finely minced onion and celery but the results were very good!

Simple and terrific. Like a few other cooks, I used the canned jalapenos that I had on had, and a tablespoon finely chopped which gave it a nice tangy heat. Great on toasted sourdough baguette slices with a tomato slice garnish. Also made a breakfast version by adding a chopped hardboiled egg, piling on an English muffin half and sliding under the broiler for 1 minute. Handy little recipe for ham leftovers!

Very tasty, great comments from my guests. Served on celery boats at a recent brunch. I used the leftovers in a sandwich the next day and didn't like how the minced pieces fell out of my sandwich, but I think that was because my ham had been packed in water and released moisture into the mayo. Still, Tasty!

This was OK, but seriously not special. Perhaps my expectations had been set too high from the other reviews. Very fast and simple. And it was OK after all.

I used Texas Pete hot sauce instaed of the habeneros. Otherwise followed the recipe. Good use for leftover ham. Very nice served on crackers or stuffed into celery.

After reviewing about a dozen recipes online for how to use up our New Year's ham, I decided on this one. WOW! I added Tabasco (liberally) because I did not have an habanero. This was outstanding, and I used minimal mayo. This would be great on crackers topped with some capers. Mmmm!

This is sublime. I make it every year at Christmas and New Years and it is gobbled up.

I didn't have habaneros on hand, so I just used Tabasco instead. Wonderful. The stuff you buy in the can just can't compare.

I was looking for something to do with some leftover Easter ham and came across this recipe...we did not have Serranos, so I used regular, jarred jalapenos, and it was great. Nice hot flavor; the peppers and worsteshire wprk well together! I ended up eating most of this by itself for lunch--didn't even need bread or crackers!

I was looking for a recipe to use up some leftover New Year's ham. I gave this a try, and honestly did not expect much. My husband and I were both pleasantly surprised- the spread was delicious! We had it on leftover biscuits, which we'd warmed in the oven, and then ate "open-faced" topped with the spread. I think this would make nice appetizers as bite-sized ham sandwiches on tiny biscuits. It would solve the problem of many ham biscuits-- the ham being tougher then the biscuit and the sandwich crumbling.

a last minute thanksgiving morning creation with ingredients from the fridge. my husband was grilling me on what "expensive" ingredients i put in it to make such a delicious hors d'oeuvres. i think worcestershire sauce and few shakes of tobasco did the trick.
