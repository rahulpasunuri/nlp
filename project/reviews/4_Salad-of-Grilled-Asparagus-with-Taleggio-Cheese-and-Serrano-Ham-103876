Excellent! it is both a salad and a vegtable. I broiled the asparagus (easier than grilling) and used fontina and prosciutto. I only added 3/4 cup of oil and that was too much. Maybe 1/3 to 1/2 cup next time. Way more dressing than needed.

This was an amazing salad! My dinner guests practically licked their salad bowls. I increased the balsamic vinegar in the dressing to give it less of an olive oil taste and I used fontina cheese to melt over the asparagus. It was perfect!

Oh my god this is so decadent! The did have to substitute quality prosciutto and fontina (could not get serrano or taleggio) but it was great! I made this for a main lunch course and was very satsifying. It's still winter here so I used the broiled for the asparagus and it turned out great (lightly browned and tender). I loaded up the plates with greens which was needed because the prosciutto, pine nuts and fontina made this a very rich salad.

one of the family's all-time favorites.Easy, fast, impresses visitors. No need to grill asparagus, just broil it. Use Black Forest Ham if you don't have prosciutto. Change up the cheese too, I made half of it with Dill harvarti cheese when I didn't have enuf Fontina. Very forgiving recipe, the secret is in the vinaigrette.

Love, love, love this salad! The flavors and textures work together perfectly. Do yourself a favor and make it tonight!

Ambrosial! That's the best way to describe this salad that my husband made for me last night. He said it was amazingly easy, too. This compares quite favorably to the types of salads you would bay upwards of $10 for at fine dining establishments. The sweet succulance of the grilled aspargus, the toasty, nutty goodness of the pinenuts, the delicious saltiness of the ham, the bubbly, scrumptious gooiness of the cheese, and the sweet/tart shallot vinaigrette all just come together so well it's impossible to do it justice with mere words. The shallot vinaigrette is so simple and yet one of the best salad dressings I've ever had. This is going to become a regular springtime dish at our house! Yum! And to the reviewer who won't make this again because the asparagus gets over-cooked, I say: "Don't throw the baby out with the bath water." If you like the flavors of the salad, but just feel that the asparagus gets a little too done, just decrease the cooking time to your liking. My husband mentioned that he thought the asparagus looked done far sooner than the recipe stated, so he just took it out a little early. Problem solved!

This is a lovely first course salad. i made it with prosciutto and a beautiful taleggio I had just purchased in NYC. However, I would not hesitate to substitute brie or fontina or perhaps a bel paese or port du salut. I also had no trouble keeping the asparagus deliciously crisp by grilling them on a gas grill and then melting the cheese under the broiler.

I happened upon this recipe when looking to use leftover Taleggio cheese. The flavor combination was spectacular -- and I did not have difficulty keeping the asparagus crisp-tender, possibly because I "grilled" them on a stove-top grill for the six minutes rather than over charcoal. All the elements can be prepared ahead, with the asparagus re-heating in the oven when melting the cheese. The dish is hardy enough to be used as a luncheon main course. We will definitely make this again!

For anyone who loves asparagus and has never grilled them on the smokey joe, please do so....they are wonderful . Just brush with a little olive oil, salt and pepper. They are great right off the grill without any dressing or mayo. As for this recipe, it's difficult to grill AND place them in the oven without over cooking. I would not recommend this recipe.
