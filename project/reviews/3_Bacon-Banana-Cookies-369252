Not a typical cookie... Came out like soft banana bread, but had no flavor. (I cooked a pound of bacon and didn't weigh it out after, so it could of been less than what the receipe calls for) Next time I would use 2-3 bananas and substitute the bacon fat for the butter. Also my cook time was 14-15 minutes and I did smaller cookies and got about 5 dozen.

This is surprisingly awesome. Best with saltier, savory bacon (as opposed to, say, maple or apple smoked) to maximize the sweet/savory contrast.

missing the bacon flavor... use the rendered fat in place of the butter

I prefer a more savory taste, so I used a modification of the Sweet-and-Spicy Bacon recipe from Epicurious (1/4 c brown sugar, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/4 tsp black pepper, 1/4 tsp cinnamon) to sprinkle on top of the cookies. (If you're thinking about substituting "candied bacon," try the Sweet-and-Spicy Bacon recipe - it's very tasty!)

Had some very ripe bananas and was tired of making banana bread so thought I would give this a try. Did cut back on the cinnamon to 1/4 tsp based on other reviews. Slight cinnamon taste but not enough to overpower the bacon/banana. Doubled the bacon. Tried the cookie method and thought they were good. Using a tbsp for each one they do not spread out too much. Topped first batch with turbinado sugar mixed with a bit of cinnamon. Nice soft cakey cookie with pleasant crunch from the sugar and the bacon. Next batch I went with the mini cupcake pan and topped with 1/4 tsp maple syrup. Baked for 14 minutes. Great mini muffins. Maple syrup compliments the bacon well. Next batch went with 1/2 tsp maple syrup and thought they were even better. Only complaint is that I think the banana flavour competes too much with the bacon (even after doubling the bacon). Might omit the bananas next time just for fun.

good ingredients but no flavor. I even added mini choc chips. Will not save the recipe.

I used 3/4 pound of bacon and I diced the bacon prior to cooking it. I also cut the cinnamon to a total of 1 teaspoon as suggested. I made two batches using a mini muffin pan coated with cooking spray and then about 10 drop "cookies" although it's really not like a cookie. I would highly recommend using the mini muffin pan. The taste is like a banana muffin with a little added salt. Good way to use old banana's.

I wasn't hugely impressed by these. The bacon does get lost quite a bit behind the banana. I was thinking of making it more savory by using a quality liquid smoke in place of the vanilla extract...too gross? After rendering all the bacon and preparing the cookies I was really hoping for a total keeper cookie recipe. I like reviewers ideas of the mini muffin tin though.

Just the idea of these is fun, so I had to try them. I too would add more bacon. Thick sliced is best. They work well either dropped on a cookie sheet or as mini muffins. Note to self: use very ripe/overrripe bananas. The oven trick described in the recipe softens them but does not sweeten. I will also try subbing chocolate chips for the bacon. Maybe I'll go all Paula Deen and add the chips AND bacon!

I followed the recipe exactly and honestly; they are nothing to write home about. I am not a huge fan of the cinnamon sugar flavor with the bacon. I think I would prefer them all the way savory or without the bacon and all the way sweet. Maybe with a candied bacon?

Incredible! The second time I added about 1/4 cup of real maple syrup and my boys ate them as fast as they cooled.

These are yummy! I did add more bacon and as one reviewer suggested, I made these in mini muffin tins, and also on a cookie sheet to compare them. I had no parchment or wax paper so I lightly greased with vegetable oil. The mini muffin tin makes "daintier" cookies, and they are so cute! By comparison, the baking sheet lets the cookie spread out more and makes for a larger cookie - especially if you are like me and guesstimate how much dough you are using for each. Either way, I would make these again. They are super and something a little different. Love the story that goes with them! Thanks!

I agree with the other reviewers who call for extra bacon. I really couldn't taste the bacon at all - I would probably almost double the amount of bacon next time, and reduce the amount of cinnamon (I think the cinnamon just overpowers everything as the recipe stands now).

I would add oats to this, to balance the fat in the bacon. Looks delicious!

Many of the reviews said the cookies where cake-like, so I made them in the Baby Cakes Mini Cupcake maker - came out perfectly. Oddly enough, I don't think they taste like bacon OR bananas - mostly tastes like cinnamon. Bacon tip: put the bacon in the freezer for about a hour, then it is easier to slice - frys up faster and more evenly too.

OMG, these cookies are wonderful. The recipe is perfect as-is, any more bacon and it would overpower. My teenaged son and I ate nearly the entire batch in one sitting. We like "cakey" type of cookies best, they are so soft and well... cakey.

What a great story, and a great recipe, will definitely make many times.

I also found them more cakey than I'd expected - the name "cookies" is slightly misleading, perhaps. Anyway, they're absolutely delicious! The bacon works surprisingly well: next time I'll actually put extra bacon in.

I would definitely make this again, especially for the bf. brought these suckers to work and they were a hit. Perfect and very cake like. Loved it! Definitely for a bacon lover

Pretty good. A lot more cakey than what I would expect from a cookie. Also, could use a but more bacon. I'll probably make them again.
