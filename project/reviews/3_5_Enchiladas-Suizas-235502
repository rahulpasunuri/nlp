Great verde sauce but will definitely double it next time. Used rotisserie chicken to save time. Also, topped with avocado and cilantro for the last 5 min in the oven. Delicious! Next time, will put cheese inside them.

The recipe has all the makings of a 4 star recipe, but due to the changes I had to make, it gets 3 forks. First, I doubled the sauce. Second I added the water from the cooking chicken to the tomatillo's for more flavor. Third I added cheese, black Beans and Corn, and the green sauce to the chicken filling. With all those changes the recipe is to die for, and next time will double or triple the recipe, because it disappeared and I would have like to have some leftovers.

This is a great basic recipe for this, but...you really need to make MUCH more sauce (double or even triple the sauce) and mix half of it plus a little of the grated cheese in with the chicken before assembling. Then follow the directions for topping them with sauce and cheese also. Otherwise the tortillas end up tasting good, with a lot of very bland chicken. I also microwave my tortillas for 20-30 seconds instead of warming them in a skillet. It's just as good and I find it makes them more pliable for assembling.

We made this earlier in the week with a few changes. We bought our local whole foods out of tomatillos but still only had half of the amount we needed (we doubled the recipe to make it last for several meals) so we substituted cooked tomatoes for half the tomatillos. But it was still really great! We also used a rotisserie chicken, just removed the skin and broke it up and voila! Much easier and faster than doing the chicken yourself. Didn't bother putting the bit of sour cream in the recipe and just saved it to put on top after cooking. I feel it's more flavorful that way. Also found no need for the oil. Next time I think the onion addition will be a good idea. Oh... and we definitely used more cheese than the recipe called for, a must, I'd say. Enjoy!

These recipes always take me longer than the specified time, but, still, it was simple and very delicious. First time using tomatillos! Also, I found that microwaving the tortillas for 20 seconds warmed and loosened them up pretty well rather than using a skillet (one less thing to wash).

Put a little shredded cheese in with the chicken and used regular sour cream. Amazing enchiladas!

This was OK but came out pretty dry. I think melting the cheese in the sauce before baking would have been better, but then again I used a fat-free cheese which wasn't the greatest anyhow.

I've made this recipe several times and have found a few things helpful: 1-toasting tortillas is putzy, particularly after a long day at work...so I layer mine like Mexican lasagna 2-using a store-roasted chicken is much juicier 3-over-buy on the tomatillos by about 1/3 to 1/2 a lb. I never seem to have enough sauce, even without reducing it per the directions. Living in Texas, we do 1 serrano and 1 jalapeno.

I used two cans of green chiles (instead of serrano chiles) and cooked those and the tomatillos in the chicken stock. I also soaked the tortillas in the stock to soften them up instead of using oil to cook them. In addition, I added a line of fresh salsa inside the enchilada. Everyone loved it.

I doubled the recipe and it made a nice sized pan of enchiladas, enough for 8 people. If you are trying to cut down on fat the oil is really not necessary in this recipe as the tomatillo sauce is fine without it. I added additional cilantro as well as half a large onion and more garlic to the sauce and it was perfect. I served with cotija cheese instead of the Jack. This would also be good over chicken without tortillas. I served it with Arroz Verde al Poblano, lettuce, sour cream with chili and lime, avocado slices, radishes and white onion.

Really good recipe... I highly recommend reading other reviews and using some of their tips. I mixed light and dark chicken meat, and for the stock that the chicken simmers in I used half of the water and the other 3 cups I used chicken stock, I added a half an onion, lots of garlic, and oregano. The person I made this dish for loved it. It's hot which I normally don't like, but this was really good!

These are great! The only thing I would suggest is to remember to make a chicken broth with the leftover stock from the boiled chicken.

These were absolutely phenominal...You do have to use your immagination however. I boiled the chicken breasts with a half onion, salt, a dash of oregano and salt. Used the broth to make rice. DELICIOUS!!

I think this is very yummy. I did use some thigh meat and not all breast meat. I tucked some cheese in with the chicken and used regular sour cream in the sauce. So maybe not as low fat as the original recipe but very tasty. Worth the effort. Assembled everything earlier in the day and then popped the enchiladas in the oven when we got home from soccer practice. Would like to try some pork instead of the chicken. Also, a bonus saved the broth from cooking the chicken for chicken noodle soup the next night.

Made this for the first time and it was the best enchilda recipe ever. I used roasted chicken per the other reviewers. THIS IS A KEEPER.

This was great, my family loved it. To give the chicken a bit more flavor, I suggest tossing it with a bit of sofrito before you put it into the tortillas. If you want a recipe for sofrito here it is: 2 cubanelle peppers 1 onion 2 cups of packed cilantro 4 cloves garlic 4 tbsp tomato paste 2 tbsp olive oil 1/4 tsp salt Put all ingredients in a food processor and process until smooth. This makes a bunch, and to flavor the chicken, you'll only need about 2 tbsp. (depending on how much kick you want in your chicken.)

Excellente! My husband and I loved this dish! The recipe made exactly 8 enchiladas! I cheated to cut my time down and used a store bought rotisserie chicken. Shredded it and did exactly what the rest of the recipe called for. Oh..and another substitute I used was nonfat plain yogurt (instead of sour cream). It turned out great! Next time I make it, I may even try shrimp and/or crabmeat instead of chicken. Muy bien!

Loved the sauce! It was a little bit hot but not too bad. I think I might try to add some beans next time. Chicken was a little bland though. Spicing it up would def help.

Unfortunately, I did not see that this was a "most of the fat removed" recipe before I made it. This was tasteless; absolutely tasteless.

The salsa verde with the sour cream is very good, but the chicken -- which is really the main ingredient in this dish -- is amazingly bland. Would some other way of preparing it make it better? Maybe even rotisserie chicken would taste better than plain old poached chicken.

The tomatillo sauce was very good...I think I'll add more of it next time.

Did some changes. I have some picky eaters here who don't do hot, so I took the tip of the other folks who made this and used 1 ancho chile pepper, seeds removed. I used a little more fresh cilantto as well. I had a mix of chicken breasts that were cooked and a whole roasted chicken from the store (the price was too good to pass up). It came out great. All but one kid ate it (he never eats anything I make, but one out of four's not bad) and everyone, but the one, asked me to make it again.

Absolutly fabulous! My husband & I love hot food, so this was perfect. if you can't stand the heat, use half a chile--you have to keep some if it just to get the authentic flavor. I was just annoyed because it took so long to make. If you want it be softer, add more water to the tomatillo sauce-mine absorbed all of the sauce and came out cassarole-like, with a crispy top...but I liked it like that.

Muy rico! The sauce is lovely! I simply used less of the serrano to make a more mild sauce. I also added sauted onions inside the enchiladas. For the vegetarians I substituted the chicken with small cubes of tofu that had been boiled in veg boullion- came out really moist and a great veggie dish!!

Cutting the heat was a priority after reading the two postings regarding the high heat factor. In place of the 2 serrano chiles, I used one jalapeno pepper. After boiling the tomatillos and jalapeno - I cleaned out the seeds in the jalapeno before adding it to the blender. The sauce came out perfectly. Just to give it an additional kick, I used pepper jack in place of the monterey jack. Finally, I was in a pinch and wanted to crank this out quickly so I used a rotisseried chicken from an organic market - it all came together wonderfully! *Even with the rotisseried shortcut* Disfrute!

I also found this to be too hot to enjoy. It ruined the flavor of the tomatillas. Next time, I think I'll omit the hot pepper and just stick with the tomatilla sauce. Otherwise, it is a quick, easy, and delicious dish!

Loved it, but it was so hot we had to stop eating it. Does this mean I didn't add enough of the tomatillo water? Any ideas?

These were so good, I followed the recipe, with the exception of the chicken, I had some beer can chicken left over so I used that, low fat sour cream was used and worked well. For a side I opened a can of black beans, added some chopped onion and a small amount of mexican four cheese mix. Cook beans with onion for about 10 minutes and add cheeses after you remove from heat. I had saved some of the broth from the tomatillos and used that to thin out the beans as they cooked. Some homemade Roja salsa and chips rounded the meal off. My husband really liked it as well as I did. I also really like this site.

Great dish! I even used lowfat sour cream and made the using left over pulled pork. That was just as good.
