Excellent, versatile recipe. I didn't bother with the rinds, either. I just put the fruit in a baking dish under the broiler. Then I served it over Jamaican coconut rum cake with vanilla ice cream. Easy and elegant dessert for company.

I normally don't mess with fresh pineapple, but this recipe turned out really well. I didn't bother with the rinds as serving platters and had to add some cornstarch to the remaining sauce since the pineapple was so juicy. Otherwise, I followed the directions and liked the results. I didn't blacken the pineapple per se, but I did let it brown up quite nicely in a foil-lined pan under the broiler. My guests loved it.
