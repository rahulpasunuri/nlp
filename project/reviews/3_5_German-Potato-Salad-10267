Great recipe for German potato salad. Good flavor without the really heavy taste of other potato salads. Made it for dinner and it was a big hit with the family.

UPDATE!!! Served the leftovers COLD 2 nights after making this, and Hubby and I think it was EVEN BETTER COLD---Do try this simple recipe!!!

Have had this in my recipe file since 2004, but had never made it until last night; in fact I have never attempted German Potato Salad before. It tasted just like I remember it from gatherings at my German Lutheran Church/School in Oak Park, IL when I was a child (perhaps a bit less vinegary, which is good). DELICIOUS as written!!! Definitely make this!!! It does make a lot, though. Followed the recipe exactly to make 1/3 of it (for 2 people), and have about half of it leftover. Only changes I made were: subbed O/M Turkey Bacon Bits for fried bacon, and didn't have any scallions greens to mix in at the end.

This recipe is VERY easy and quick to make- and tastes wonderful. The recipe as written is quite mild- I used extra bacon grease and onions to give it some more zest. Got rave reviews from the neighbors. Would make again.

I thought this was very good - reminded me of my aunt's potato salad (who is German). I left out the eggs, but the pickles are a must. Very good!

I omitted the celery, eggs and pickles (they weren't needed) and made a really delicious, classic german potato salad with this recipe. Would definitely make it again.

mustard and celery seeds, among others, do not belong into German Potato Salad. Sat basic and true to the tru recipe
