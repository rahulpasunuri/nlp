After reading the great reviews of this dish I admit I had some expectations but this really decieved me, this was a very simple dish, no dimension in the flavors, no dept, no particular texture. I was not impressed. It is something I would make again, just if I want a little change from my reguar tomatoe sauce by adding the olives and the crushed peppers.

Very delicious if you like olives as much as I do. I used Italian diced tomatoes, so I didn't need to add oregano or garlic. I may try this with artichoke hearts and/or feta next time, although it's perfect just as it is.

I was able to make this on the spur of the moment with items already in my pantry. Everyone loved it! I substituted dried basil for the oregano and grated romano cheese for the parmesan. I'm going to forward this easy recipe to my friends.

This came out great! I made 1/2 a recipe for just two of us. It came together quick and easy. We both ate it for lunch the next day and it was even better then!

Easy, quick, and hearty. If you like olives (lots of olives), you will love this. My hard-to-please gang scarfed it up and pronounced it very good.

I made this recipe tonight for my family and it was well received. The only change I made was to add about 1/4 cup port wine before adding the tomatoes and olives and letting it reduce by about half. That seemed to mellow the sharpness of the olives in the dish.

It is a delicious dish. It's time consuming if you have to pit the olives, but good quality olives add an incredible flavor to the dish. If you want a meal for meat eaters, a couple of grilled Italian sausages sliced on top are wonderful.

Great reviews so far, but this recipe didn't knock my socks off... we judged this recipe as just plain good. I used only quality ingredients, and followed the instructions precisely. Good points: this was easy to prepare, and a relatively inexpensive meal with large portions for 6.

This recipe was surprisingly good -- and very fast. I wanted a more smooth sauce, so I blenderized half (before adding the cheese and pasta). Also, I cut the amount of cheese in half, but added 1/4 cup of sour cream. Perfect for one of those days when my refrigerator looks bare and I am too lazy to go to the store for fresh veggies.

My husband, who waited tables in SF's North Beach for a time, said this dish belonged in a fine Italian restaurant.

I added more crushed red pepper (1 tsp instead of 1/2) and that added a little more kick.

Exellent - Easy - Very, Very Good. I have made it several times since then and have passed it a long to family & friends.
