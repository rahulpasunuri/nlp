Followed recipe exactly. I don't know, maybe my taste buds took the day off, but I was surprised that the soup and dumplings were incredibly bland. I'll not make either again, but if I did, I would use all of the previous reviewers' suggestions which might make them edible.

I read the reviews and made a few changes. In soup added 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes and made it with 3 cloves garlic and made it with chicken stock. Used a medium size potato and skipped the cream didn't need it. On dumplings didn't have fresh basil so used 1 1/2 tsp dried basil, 2 tablespoons white wine and 2 tablespoons finely chopped sun dried tomatoes and 2 chopped garlic cloves sautéed with shallots. Didn't have goat cheese substitute it with crumbled feta cheese. To cook dumplings I heated non stick pan with about a tablespoon of oil coat pan medium heat brown each side of dumpling the add 2 tablespoons water and cover immediately and turn down the heat to low for about 5 minutes. I think that the sun dried tomatoes add the extra zip that when you bite into the dumpling with the soup it adds to the soup.

I must admit I haven't prepared the dumplings yet, though I do plan on stuffing them in fresh pasta instead of wonton wrappers, and will check back in to review that process, but this soup is delicious! I grilled the eggplant instead of roasting them, and it gave a nice smokey flavor. The soup came out quite thick and would certainly stand on its own without dumplings to accompany it

Delicious! I have to say, I made some modifications out of laziness and availability of ingredients - the food store closest to my house has a limited produce department so I was unable to add the leeks. I roasted 2 large eggplants, 1 1/2 red pepper and the garlic all together. I added 2 Idaho potatoes. Did not add the cream, but did add a bit of goat cheese I had on hand. In lieu of the dumplings, I added 2 packages of frozen, store bought, bite sized cheese raviolis. Served with a fresh salad, pain rustique flat bread and some red table wine - great dinner for a cold, October evening in NJ.

I think the flavors in the soup are fantastic. The eggplant is mellow but delicious and the potato gives the soup a creaminess before the heavy cream is even added. I made the wontons early in the day and placed them on a cookie sheet sprayed with non stick spray and covered them with a wet towel. Then I baked them before adding to the soup! This recipe was easy and great!

Just a note to those who have problems with the dumplings sticking. When you are done prepping, place them on a sheet of wax paper that has been lightly oiled. I use this method for another soup and it works perfectly. No goo.

Poach the dumplings separately in slightly less than a rolling boil. Otherwise, very tasty soup.

I cut this recipe in half (just the hubby and me here) and it was a definite 3.5 forks. He hates eggplant and didn't even know it was in there! I used low fat chicken broth & 1% milk and it still had loads of flavor. I admit to adding a couple of shakes of red pepper flakes because some reviewers stated it lacked flavor, but it could have stood on it's own. I did take everybody's suggestion on deep-frying the dumplings - and I agree that they are delicious that way. A great appetizer on their own with perhaps a hot/sweet sauce. General Chow's comes to mind. There were no leftovers!

I don't understand the rave reviews for this soup. I thought it lacked a lot of flavour punch - pretty bland. Not difficult, but a bit time consuming and not worth the time invested. However, the dumplings were very good. I added some red wine to the shallots when sauteing to boost flavour and fried them as suggested by others and I would make these again as a stand alone appetizer. I couldn't understand them in the context of the soup - the flavours didn't seem to enhance each other.

I cannot even tell you how much I liked this soup. We also fried the dumplings, which I think gives a great added texture to the dish. I don't even like eggplant and I thought that it was out of this world.

This soup was amazing! We deep-fried the dumplings to give them a little crunch, and they were out of this world. The dumplings would make a wonderful appetizer on their own as well.

this is my favorite vegetable. Very taste soup. Just very hard to make. Have made it for large parties and the wontons are just hard to make in advance without them sticking.

An excellent soup for the end of a long, grey winter. The dumplings are definately needed to give spice to the soup (which is mild but delicious). I skipped the whipping cream, which is really not necessary). It is a fair amount of work, but if you have a friend working along side and make it a fun project (rather than time-pressured meal) it is a fun and delicious way to spend an afternoon.

I don't understand why someone would think the dumplings are strange. They add interest and tang. The ingredients are a perfect match for eggplant - you don't get much more classic than that. The soup was fantastic. I wouldn't change a thing, except that I would add that I didn't use the portion of eggplant that came into contact with the baking sheet. It tasted bitter to me when I tried it. Great recipe.

The soup was good but the dumplings were strange. I think the filling would be better on crostini or a toasted baguette. I also used a hand-held blender for easy preparation.

This receipe is very rich. The soup is better w/o the cream; maybe half and half is the way to go.

The soup is wonderful! I assembled and boiled the dumplings the night before. I stored them in a Tupperware bowl. It was impossible to get them out of the Tupperware without ripping and tearing them. And they tasted a bit gummy. Next time I'll use ravioli or tortellini.

This soup was absolutely delicious! All my guests were extremely impressed as I was myself!I followed the recipe as is, but next time I will try milk or half-and-half to see if I can save on calories per others suggestions. Also, a handheld blender would be perfect as it was a bit messy to do all the transfering. This was definitely a huge hit!!!!

This was good. I didn't use goat cheese, because sometimes it's too pungent, but in this soup it probably is a compliment. Chopping up everything and beginning the sauteeing while the eggplant was roasting speeded up the rest of the soup and the dumplings. /I used 1% milk, but don't think it was really necessary.

This soup was smooth, flavorful, and filling - comfort food at its best, in my opinion. Due to diet restrictions, I substituted the cream by leaving out about 1 cup of the chicken broth and added approx. 1 1/2 cups skim milk. It was still thick and rich-tasting. I'll be making it often.

This soup was wonderful!! I made this for my relatives and even my uncle who said he hated eggplant said this was one of the best soups he had ever eaten! I would try and do the prep before guests arrive next time as this is a fairly lengthy process. Worth every minute of the work. The dumplings were easy and could be.

Couldn't find fennel so left it out. Still yummy. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Just finished this soup. Velvet! WONDERFUL. I did add more garlic, per other suggestions, and I did punch it up a bit at the end by adding a Knorr Chicken Bullion cube. I used non-fat half and half (never tried it before)....and it was excellent. However, I did taste the soup before I added the half and half. My feeling is that it could stand on it's own even if it did not have milk added. (for you dieters). Just wonderful. RICH!

I'm a HUGE soup person and this recipe is fabulous. I cut back on the chicken broth the third time I made it because I like a litte creamier soup. I also used Anise Bulb instead of Fennel for similar flavor. Fabulous soup. I would recommend it even to non-eggplant fans!the

This was a delicious soup. A beautiful blend of flavours! The dumplings were a bit thin with the wonton wrappers, so next time I'd use pasta dough. Definitely a hit in my household!

This thick soup or "potage" was marvelous and I highly recommend it. Of course, I may be biased in that I love thick soups (especially in cold weather). But this was no regular "vegetable soup". Delectable and hearty all at the same time. And the dumplings made it look straight out of a four star restaurant. I have to say it made quite an impression. You can prep all the veggies and and the dumplings when the eggplant is cooking... This was subtle and delectable. Two thumbs up! My boyfriend was very impressed!

This soup is wonderful! I tweaked the recipe by adding a lot more garlic and omitting the cream to save on fat and calories. I didn't have time to make the dumplings so I just used pre-fabricated cheese ravioli from my grocer and I still got rave reviews. Like all soups, this one is even better the next day. Enjoy!

This soup was outstanding. One of the best new recipies I've tried in a long time. A bit of prep, but well worth it. The contrast between the creamy soup and the dumplings made the dish. I added a little cayenne & some lemon pepper to the stuffing for the dumplings,it accentuated the contrast, & used a 'boat motor' to blend the soup in the pot. Definitely a winner!

This was delicious. Contrary to what some other reviewers have said, this was fairly easy to make. It's especially easy if you have a hand-held blender to do the blending of the soup -- just do it straight in the pot, instead of trasferring batches to a blender. And you can make the dumplings while the eggplant is roasting. The dumplings really "made" the dish. Delicious.

This was a smash as a recent dinner party. Flavor was outstanding and everyone asked for the recipe. Did not serve with dumplings - thought it would be too rich. And, substituted milk for half and half. Will definitely make again - only this time will double the recipe for take home bags!

This was impressive, delicious and well-received but it is a bit labor-intense. Save this for a special occassion and a crowd that you are sure likes eggplant.
