I looked this up so I could make some mushroom ravioli. You know...there were times when Gourmet was great, and then there were times when they really phoned it it. Should I mention the doughnut sundae recipe, in which one was instructed to purchase a store-bought doughnut, store-bought ice cream and store-bought fudge, then told to assemble them into the inevitably sugary, cloying mass one would expect? I think I shall mention that, and compare this recipe for ravioli in which one is told to go buy...ravioli. Premade. Frozen. Duh. Yeah, semi-homemade is okay some of the time, but I look to other conde nast pubs for that sort of thing. Gourmet recipes should strive for a bit more.

I have fresh lasagna sheets and wanted to make ravioli with it. This recipe should be under the sauces catagory not ravioli

My family liked this very well. Because I live in the rural south, I couldn't find any of the mushrooms. I used baby portabella and white. These mushrooms never juiced up so I added some chicken broth. I also couldn't find ravioli (yeah, I know, the grocery stores here are horrible!) So I just used rotini. The fam said they thought some cream in the sauce would be nice, so next time I'll had some half and half.

This was pretty good. A nice change from red sauce. I agree with another reviewer that the mushroom sauce goes well with other pastas too.

Delicious. Tried it first with ravioli and then tried it with just bowtie pasta the second time (cup and a half) and it was a nice, light alternative. Topped it with grated romano cheese. This was an attractive dish that's simple to make, attractive and is definitely going into my rotation.

We skipped the additional butter called for at the end of the recipe and it turned out great. The flavor was good and it was very easy. We also used baby portabella mushrooms that were pre-bagged at the grocery store. That substitution makes it easy to have the ingredients on hand.

Quick to make and delicious. Used about 1/2 the butter called for. Next time I will save a little pasta water and add to the ravioli and mushrooms.
