These are very good. I only add half the sugar. I like to add mini chocolate chips or date puree(put a bit between 2 cutouts before cooking) or dipped in chocolate.

I've made this recipe twice. The second time I doubled it, added three tablespoons of honey, but forgot to add any sugar. Loved it! Made the cakes in mini muffins tins.

For my own personal taste, I found these a bit sweet--other than that they are excellent. Next time I will halve the sugar. I also made substitutions to make these both dairy and gluten free (I used Earth Balance in place of the butter, So Delicious Unsweetened Coconut milk for the buttermilk, gluten free oats and a cup of gluten free flour blend with 1 teaspoon xanthan gum. Rather than rolling and cutting, I formed them into balls with my hands and flattened them with my fingers on parchment lined baking sheets. Bake time was the same.

Love these! Used 1/3c brown sugar and 1/2c greek yogurt instead of buttermilk and they were perfect! The only problem I had was that they were impossible to roll out...so I spooned them onto the sheet and then flattened. Definitely a keeper!

Pleasing to eat and easy to make. But sweeter and more like a regular oatmeal cookie than expected, just not quite as cloying or rich. Will try a recipe with less (or no) sugar next time.

Although I really enjoyed these, they are nothing like a genuine Scottish oatcake, which traditionally contains only oatmeal (steel cut is close but a bit too chunky - Scottish pinhead is difficult to find in America), salt, fat - traditionally bacon fat or lard, and water. They should be slightly crumbly and nutty- flavoured. When I used to cook for a living, we produced zillions of these to go with the cheeseboard after dinner - which, since we were an ultra-traditional establishment, had Cheddar, Stilton and Caboc, no other cheese.

I used steel-cut oats rather than oatmeal and got a chewier biscuit. I also doubled the salt (used celtic seasalt) and baking soda, and put the sugar to 1/3c. I think I would put the baking soda at 3/4tsp next time, as I could taste it slightly.

My ten year old daughter made these for our Burn's Supper and they were wonderful. We served them after the haggis for the cheese course with an aged white cheddar and they were devoured! Next time we will be sure to double the recipe.

This recipe was excellent-- I made it with half butter and half vegetable shortening and skim instead of buttermilk. It was so easy: the dough held together well when I roled it out and the rounds crisped up in the oven. A big hit!

This is one of my favorite quick breakfasts - I don't like very sweet breakfast food, and it's kind of like a cross between a scone and a cookie. My son loves to make these with me, they're pretty easy, but can burn, so you have to watch them in the oven.

these are the best oatmeal cookies!

My son had a project due on Scotland and I searched this website for something other then shortbread that he could make. These were very easy to make and very tasty also. They were so good the whole batch was wiped out at school and I have to make some for us!

Last weekend I hosted a May Day party for several friends and made these oatcakes -- bannock or oatcakes are an ancient Celtic tradition for that day. I've never had a recipe so demanded -- and the suggestion to serve with chutney and stilton was excellent. A guest from Northumberland thought the combination spot on (we also had gorgonzola as an alternative.) Perhaps best of all, the South Beach Diet/Weight Watchers folk in the groups could eat the oatcakes. I substituted butter for shortening to avoid trans-fatty acids, and one could use Splenda instead of the sugar. These were excellent with the May Wine (reisling and woodruff) as well.

I had oatcakes topped with Stilton and chutney at a teahouse, and these were exactly what I was trying to duplicate. Not too sweet, but not bland, not too chewy and not too crispy. Just right!

very good, not too sweet and and excellent "to go" breakfast, texture reminded me of a biscuit.

These are like slightly sweet and dry tea biscuits. (Are Scottish oatcakes supposed to be like that?) If I make them again, I will increase the buttermilk/shortening slightly. That may help bring the dough together more easily as well. Be careful about baking time; even though I used an insulated baking pan, the bottoms got a little burnt even though the tops were still deceptively pale.

I really like these either for quick breakfast or snack - they are satisfying, keep well, are easy to make, and are not overly sweet.

Substituted 1/2 c. old fashioned oats with 1/2 c. steel-cut oats -- still delicious.
