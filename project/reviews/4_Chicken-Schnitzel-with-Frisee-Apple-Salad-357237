Made this for a German themed potluck and everyone loved it! Very easy and delicious!

I actually have been practicing making homemade wheat bread, and used those breadcrumbs for the breading. One dinner guest commented, "The breading is amazing! What did you use?" One thing I'd change next time is that since the chicken thigh is rather fatty already, and frying in oil and butter made it even more fatty, I'd set them on paper towels before serving. The salad was light and fresh and a perfect accompaniment.

I make this more as Chicken Milanese than Schnitzel by using Italian flavored bread crumbs (Progresso). Also, since my wife only likes white meat, I just use skinned and boneless chicken breasts, pounded out to about 1/4 inch thick and cut into manageable pieces; no need to slice the breast. We find it goes well with capellini and fresh basil/lemon/tomato sauce. Also, grilled green beans as a side. It is one of our favorite dishes.

What's this about: "breadcrumbs made from crustless country wheat bread (preferably organic)..." Any specific reason or just good old bread crumbs would do? Maybe seasoned if preferred...

Salad very tasty! for the chicken, I used my usual recipe - boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut in half crosswise, pounded, dipped in egg substitute (or egg whites) and then in seasoned panko, sprayed with butter or olive oil and baked at 400 for 15 minutes. Much healthier!

Vibrant tastes in the salad, added some walnut oil. Great idea for quick-ish dinner. Unless you had an exceptional bread for the breadcrumbs, additional seasoning helps. I put some pepper & salt in the flour, and could have rubbed the bread (pre crumbing) with cut garlic.
