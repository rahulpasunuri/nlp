I made this last night for my boyfriend who is a much better cook than I am, but I knew that even I couldn't mess this up, based on the directions. He loved it, & will be taking the leftovers for work this week. I added a little too much lemon juice & will stick to the recipe as written next time. Served it with french bread & greek white wine. Easy & yummy.

I agree -- REALLY simple and decious. Next time I'd add a bit more orzo, and would try it with lime instead of lemon, just for a change.

Easy and delicious! Be sure to squeeze fresh lemon juice (I used half a lemon), into the pot after adding back the chicken and the dill.
