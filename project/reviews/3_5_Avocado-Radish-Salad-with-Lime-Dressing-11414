I wanted an easy salad that would go well with chili and this was it. I added a spoonfull of the soaked dried chilis and water mixture I used as the base for my chili and it was awesome.

I served this at a dinner party for four non-picky eaters, and only the perpetual member of the CPC (Clean Plate Club) was able to choke his down. The avocados were the only edible portion of this salad.

This sounds so simple as to be boring, but with good olive oil and a nice fresh avocado, it's great! i took the suggestion to add a dash of hot sauce.

So easy, and so delicious - I cut back substantially on the oil, and used a spring mix instead of romaine, and it was something we could eat weekly. definitely goes on the repeat list.

I only gave this three forks because I felt it needed more flavor. This definitely needed salt and pepper which I added to the dressing and I also added a dash of scotch bonnet pepper hot sauce, but any hot sauce or red pepper flakes would be good. This gave it just the right (subtle) kick. I also added tomato to the salad just because I love them and I had a fresh one from the green market. This really was a wonderful summer salad if you're looking for something a little different!
