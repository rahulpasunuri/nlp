this cake is the only chocolate cake besides Bakers German's chocolate cake that I can make that doesn't fall in the middle. It could be a bit more chocolatey tasting. Make sure you add all the mayo...I was a bit short therefore it wasn't as moist as it should have been. I will definately make it again but i think I will add 1 T. more cocoa powder to kick it up a notch.

Before I made this recipe, I looked at the reviews and saw a few that didn't rate it well, but I thought those people were just being grumpy. They weren't. I didn't find anything remarkable about this cake. In fact, a boxed mix might have been better. A bit bland, lacking in pizzaz. I will keep looking for a great, fall-back chocolate cake recipe.

A friend brought this over to our house for a celebration for my husband's birthday . One of the guests owns a bakery/cafe and when my friend saw her vehicle in the driveway she had thoughts of going back home with the birthday cake, fearing it might not be up to par. Thank goodness she didn't. Hands down this is one of the best cakes we've ever had. I'm not too fond of cakes and the first thing I had the next morning with my cappuccino was a slice. Even the cafe owner's 6 year old exclaimed at the table "oh this is just delicious!". My friend also amended the chocolate frosting with espresso, perfect touch. Kudos to creating a wonderful recipe for the "home baker".

This is a great, all-around chocolate cake. I,like many others, used 4 oz of semi-sweet chocolate and a full cup of cocoa powder instead of the amounts called for in the recipe. I also added instant decaf coffee to the boiling water. The extra chocolate and the coffee flavor combined to make it a richer-tasting cake. I made it for my husband's 59th birthday, frosted with whipped cream, and everyone, young and old alike, loved it.

Meh - I was hoping that this would be like the mayonnaise cake my mom used to make - dark and very, very moist. Because of all the great reviews, I was really excited to try this cake. But the result really underwhelmed me. I made the recipe basically as written, except that I did not have two ounces of bittersweet chocolate - only one ounce. So, I added a sizeable handfull of semi-sweet chocolate chips to the chocolate mixture - at least 1 1/2 to 2 ounces to make up for the 1 oz. of lost bittersweet chocolate. I found the cake to be a bit on the dry side, and the flavor was just disappointing. It couldn't carry the simple butter cream frosting I made for it. Also, I did not find this to be an "easy" recipe in the least. I think I used four bowls, two mixers, and almost all the measuring cups in my kitchen to make this cake. It's a very large recipe - enough for three layers. This recipe was definitely not a good choice for just whipping up a chocolate cake on the spur of the moment - but I don't think it would be worthy of a special occasion either. Bottom line - too much effort for too little payoff. I'll keep looking.

This cake is worthy of the four stars. I made the cake with the recommended 4 oz of chocolate in the cake batter from the reviews below, it had just the right amount of chocolate. All I had was 50% reduced fat Mayonnaise from Hellman's and it turned out fine. The measurements are so exact in this recipe and the cake baked in the exact time it said it would. This cake would go well with any frosting you chose.

Made the recipe as is, used Ghirardelli 60% chips and Hershey's cocoa; thought the chocolate factor could have been upped a notch, but overall, a good and moist chocolate cake. 3.5 stars.

This cake is absolutely delicious. I made it for my husband's 30th birthday, and everyone raved about it. My cousin, who will never finish the dessert on her plate, had two pieces! This is now my go-to chocolate cake and frosting.

I made this for my 9 year old's birthday and she loved it, as did the rest of the family. Caution: this could send you over a chocolate cliff so be prepared if you serve it after dinner and before bedtime... 2 changes I made were to replace 3/4 C water with hot coffee (which might explain the evening kick) to deepen the choc. flavor and reduce the frosting by 1/2 C powdered sugar and adding instead some unsweetened cocoa and a dash of salt to the sifted mix. Truly, a great cake and easy to make once I had everything assembled.

I'm more of a savory cook than a baker. But this makes me think twice about baking. I made it for a friend's birthday and people are still talking about it! I maybe have added a hint of cayenne b/c I just can't help myself. It was stellar! Yum!

I made this cake recently for my husband's b-day. Yes it is very good and very rich, however I had a devil of a time removing the cakes from the pans when it was time to cool them on racks. Extra butter and parchment paper would have helped I think.. This was not listed in the recipe.

Yes, it is moist and chocolatey, but after I served it my good friend admitted that she thought that it may have been a box cake. It was good but not all that much better than a cake mix. Next time, I'll try something else.

I found this cake disappointing. The cake itself was a little dry and I thought the frosting was too sweet. I followed the recipe as listed so maybe I should have added more chocolate as other reviewers suggested.

This was easy to make, and a GREAT birthday cake! Guests raved about it and all took pieces home. I made 2 9" layers, and reduced the frosting recipe by 1/3, added a bit of cocoa to make it less sweet more chocolatey and it was perfect. Had to slice the top off the bottom layer to create a flat top, but my boyfriend devoured it with ice cream later. Delish!

Wonderful! I made for a family friend who wants cupcakes and it turned out wonderful. Easy to make. I took suggestion and added more chocolate. I used bittersweet and doubled it,4 oz. Did not make frosting (I use my own). I will keep this one. Perfect! P.S. I baked cupcakes 19 min.I like big full large topped cupcake.

excellent. made recipe as is...delicious. moist. rich. cake is just the right sweetness. icing is decadent-soft, rich, buttery, chocolatey and light. i made two 8" rounds and 12 tasty cupcakes. plenty of icing for everything. will use this as my cake to impress!

Extremely easy to make and tasted great! I thought the icing was a little too sweet, I added 1/2 cup whipped cream cheese to mine to temper the sweetness. Everyone loved it!

Awesome, awesome awesome!!!! instead of chocolate icing my husband requested cream cheese coconut; I toasted the coconut topping which contrasted well with this soft, rich cake. The only thing I tweaked was I added more chocolate. I read a previous reviewer saying it wasn't "chocolatey" enough and looking at the batter while mixing, I had to agree. I added 1/2 then 1/3 more cups of Ghirardelli 60% Premium baking chips (they look like big chocolate drops) so I guess that would be 5/6 of a cup instead of the 2 oz indicated. It turned out fine. This cake tends to rise quite high so wondering if the 1/4 tsp of baking powder is necessary, might leave it out next time.

Stupid easy to make and totally nice to eat. It kept well for two days and would have kept longer but it was gone. I had heard about these type of cakes from my mother but had always shuddered away, my Bon Appetit arrived and this cake picture was staring at me daring me to make it.....So happy I took the dare

Raelly good, mine took less than 30 minutes to bake, one layer I left a little logner dried out a bit so watch for that. Frosting amount was perfect, didn't make too much for my cake. Really easy and delicious. A keeper.

This is my new favorite chocolate cake recipe. Wonderfully moist crumb, and the icing was as sweet as you'd expect a chocolate buttercream-type to be. I made exactly as written and wasn't disappointed.

You might have to have a defibrillator handy when serving this cake but it was probably the tastiest chocolate cake and frosting combination that I've made in a long time. I found it VERY chocolately and not the least bit dry. Thinking it might make awesome cupcakes as well!

Surpringly good. Not quite chocolately enough. Frosting, even with all that butter, is light and fluffy!

I followed this recipe exactly and it was absolutely amazing. This was the BEST chocolate cake I ever had. I took it to an Easter gathering and not one person left without trying a piece (or two). I will definitely make it again.

THE best chocolate cake ever. I made two 9" layers rather than three 8" layers, and the cooking time was perfect. I used a vanilla butter cream frosting.

Delicious and moist, perfect Easter splurge for the family. Used dark chocolate Ghiradelli chips. Loved the amount of frosting, easy to spread and made a beautiful presentation. Since pans were 9 inch and dark, layers cooked in far less time. Lined pans with buttered parchment to aid in removal, and though the batter was strangely liquid, it stayed put.

Cake was dry. I checked it 5 minutes early and it was already a bit dried out. The recipe for frosting made a TON, so I used most but froze the extra so it's wasn't grossly over frosted. Not a fav that I'd try again. There are better recipes around.

Made this for a family dinner night (meatloaf, mashed potatoes, etc), and it was phenomenal. Moist, light, and the frosting is amazing. Would also do well on cupcakes.
