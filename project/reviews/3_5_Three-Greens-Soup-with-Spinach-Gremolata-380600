Excellent recipe. Delicious soup. I followed all steps as instructed, with one exception. I substituted Yukon Gold potatoes for sweet potatoes. Think it complimented the greens perfectly.

Coming from the south and growing up eating greens seasoned with fatty pork like bacon and ham hocks, I really miss my greens. We just don't eat like that these days. This recipe is wonderful because it is loaded with flavor without all the bad fat. The gremolata is the star of this dish for flavor while the soup offers the wonderful nutrition of the greens. This is one of my favorite recipes. Thanks, EPI!!

Really wanted to like this soup. I followed it exactly and it was just ok. The second day I added a little chicken and some black beans. Still just ok. Although I am sure my body loved it, health wise.

I took the suggestion offered and purchased a bag of pre-washed, mixed greens, which contained, collard, mustard, turnip and spinach greens. I added the whole bag after cooking the potatoes for about 5-7 minutes. It worked beautifully. I also used baby spinach for the gremolata because it's what I had on hand, and it too worked beautifully. I love this recipe and will make it over and over again. It's absolutely soul satisfying!

I tried this recipe. It started out a bit bland but after adding some paprika, rad pepper and a little bit of mustard powder it perked right up. I will deff make this again.

Add 1-2 cans of cannellini beans or chick peas for protein (to make it more filling). Double the gremolata, and, if you like heat, add some crushed red peper flakes. Next time, I'll use parsley for a traditional gremolata (rather than spinach) and/or mushrooms for more flavor. Good and practical for lunch for the week--but not a showstopper for guests.

Very delicious. I used Leaks instead of onion and added White Pepper for a kick! Also added the mushrooms as in another review which gave it nice added dimension.

Very healthy and satisfying soup. I upped the lemon juice and broth. Also, used frozen spinach (had it on hand) and fresh chard and kale and that worked fine. Doubled gremolata as others suggested. Yum! Also, threw in some proscuitto I had on hand.

I didn't have chard, so I used turnip greens. Delicious! hearty for a greens soup. I will make again!

I'm giving this soup four forks because it's great to find something that pleases omnivores, vegans, and gluten-intolerant friends. Could have doubled the gremolata (yes, it's deceptively, explosively good). I had no time for all the chopping, so went with bagged, chopped Southern-stlye greens and did without the chard, and I used boxed vegetable broth. A great optional garnish is grated parmiggiano, but don't skip the toasted pine nuts. I'm already planning to try some of the viewer-recommended variations (cannellini or black-eyed peas, baconor how about smoked turkey?) Love my Microplane, but pureed the garlic by running it against the end of the tines of a fork held against the cutting board. Somehow I fear grating my fingers while holding something so small against a grater.

Being from Alabama, this is comfort food for me. Made this with some of the suggestions of others, two slices of bacon, and a handful of sliced mushrooms sauteed with the onions. I replaced the pine nuts with pumpkin seeds just because pine nuts are so expensive. This dish has layers and layers of flavor. Served this up with sesame seed cornbread, Yum!

I thought this recipe was great, although next time I'll either add salt to each layer or use regular chicken broth instead of low-sodium. I might make a little extra gremolata as well, it's lemony flavor really added to the soup!

Really liked this soup. Quick and easy. Great on it's own, but the addition of the gremolata really takes it to another level; bright and fresh. I used kale instead of collard greens (sometimes you're limited in selection with organic produce) and switched the proportions (8 cups kale, 2 cups chard). Also added some shiitake mushrooms.

Thanks to all of you other reviewers with the good ideas, this was probably the best soup I've ever made. Started by sizzling 5-6 chopped strips of thick-cut bacon, then added a little drizzle of olive oil before throwing in the onion. Used frozen chicken stock rather than boxed/canned broth. Added hot red pepper flakes when the chard went in. Added 1 can cannellini beans with the spinach. End results were most yummy. Love the trick of grating the garlic (used a Microplane). Will do it that way whenever I make gremolata from now on.

I followed this recipe exactly and we were completely disappointed. I spent nearly an hour chopping all the greens. And with all the garlic and onion you'd think it would have a great flavor/smell but it was bland! The gremolata helped but in no way overcame the blandness of the soup. Glad it's healthy!

This soup is delicious! It is bright and cheerful and perfect for a gloomy Sunday.

Loved loved loved the Gremolata with the pine nuts! I can't stop eating it. However, the soup was very bland. Use the BEST broth you can find, preferably homemade. It was more time consuming that I expected with the "quick and easy" symbol. I disagree with top ratings; a first for Epicurious reviewers and me. I wanted to love this but didn't. :(

This was a refreshing meal after the meat and fat-saturated holidays. The soup actually tasted better the second day. Don't skip the fresh gremolata; that's what makes the dish. Next time I'd skip the potatoes and just eat it with fresh bread.

This soup was easy and delicious. I followed the recipe almost to the letter, but added some leftover mushrooms that I had on hand with the spinach. The lemony, garlicky hit of the gremolata and nuttiness of the pine nuts added a ton of flavor! I do think that a little something was missing... I used a little sriracha to add spice at the end. Maybe some red pepper flakes with the broth? I like the idea of adding prosciutto or bacon, too. Will definitely make again!

This dish is very delicious. We made it pretty close to what the recipe called for but with one change, we added proscuitto to the spinach gemolata. It added a little saltiness that was made that part of the dish even more wonderful. Prost!

Hearty, healthy, and delicious all in one! I substituted the chicken broth with Rapunzel bouillon cubes and the result was delicious. I especially loved the gremolata's spicy flavor burst. The pine nuts absolutely completed the soup; do not skip! This recipe yields about four servings. I only wish I doubled the recipe.

Made this during the holidays for a houseful of family to great reviews -- with veggie broth (some vegetarians in the mix) and without the gremolata (some were sensitive to raw garlic). Have made it since with other greens; I'd say the collards are a must, but other greens in the mix, including kale and shredded brussells sprouts, work well. My new go-to soup when a robust infusion of greens is needed to ward off winter doldrums!

Made this ahead of time for a quick Christmas Eve dinner with the family. Everyone loved it. The gremolata is a must, we decided to have that as a side for dinner the next day. I used vegetable stock and don't recommend it. Thankfully the lemon juice saved the broth.

My husband and I were looking for a veggie-filled meal - and this fit the bill perfectly! It was filling, warming, and super flavorful. The lemon really adds a whole other layer. I will definitely be making this again - soon! Only thing I did differently was add a can of Northern beans and sprinkle with fresh grated pecorino romano cheese. Whatever you do differently, though, do not skip the gremolata - it's amazing with the fresh lemon rind and grated garlic!
