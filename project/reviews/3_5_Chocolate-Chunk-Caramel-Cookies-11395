The caramels made a mess on the cookie sheet.

Rating: 4
These cookies were REALLY good. The reviews were very helpful because we took a lot of the advice. My friend wanted to make kick-a-- cookies to win a cookie contest at his office. (He normally does not bake at all.) Here's what we did: We added about 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. We also used about 1 & 1/2 times the amount of chocolate and caramels. We used both dark & milk chocolate. We wanted to make large cookies so it helped when we refrigerated the dough. After placing the balls of dough on the baking sheet, we stuck some extra chocolate & caramel pieces on top to make them look really enticing! We baked them at 325 and played with the baking time for the larger cookies - I think we ended up with about 15 minutes working well. He WON!

Great cookies and yield was close to the 50 stated (I was able to make about 46 or so) with medium size ice cream/ cookie scoop. No vanilla extract listed in ingredients (odd) but I added about 2 teaspoons at same time as egg and flavor of dough was delicious. I followed previous reviewers advice and tossed the unwrapped caramels in a tablespoon or so of the measured flour in a medium size bowl before cutting and then added the chopped chocolate and chopped caramels plus pecan pieces back in with the remaining tiny bit of flour in bowl and mixed together before adding to the recipe when called for. Baked at 350 for 12 minutes and edges were just turning brown. Perfect! I used non-stick foil on the cookie sheets for baking and then cooled on the cookie sheets before transferring to a regular cooling rack. No problems at all with sticking using this method.

These taste absolutely delicious! I baked for about 10 mins (small cookies) at 325 on parchment paper and had no problems with them sticking to the paper. But, wherever the caramel ended up being around the edge of the cookie, it just melted out into the other cookies! Next time i think i'd place a few chunks of caramel in the top of the cookie once placed on the sheet.

I made these for a coworker's birthday and they were a HIT! I followed other's advice and cooked them at 325 for 12 minutes and they turned out perfectly. In fact, I got many compliments about how chewy they were!

I used caramel bits that I found in Arthur Illinois at Beachys (Amish Country). They worked very well especially when I used nonstick baking stones. I used a Cuisinart and pulsed the bittersweet bars which allowed the chocolate to be chopped into small chunks. Overall great recipe. Oh, and use foil instead of wax paper for cooling. Otherwise, the caramel will stick.

I left out the pecans and added a handful more chocolate chips. I took the other reviewers' advice and coated the caramels in flour before and after I chopped them up. I agree with the suggestions to cut the caramels into small pieces. I used Kraft and cut them each into 6 or 8 pieces.

Followed reviewers suggestion to chop caramel into smaller pieces and coat in flour and mine turned out fine (note: tried to be lazy and use food processor slice blade to chop the caramels and bent my blade--duh!) But I would up the chocolate quotient by at least 1/2 next time--I prefer my cookies to be little batter, lots of treats!

I made these for a cookie contest. My roommates and friends loved them. I made a couple of different batches for different degrees of hardness, and melted the caramel into the batter. I stacked the cookies on top of one another with a mixture of melted caramel and cream holding them together and sliced them into triangular pryamids. I then melted chocolate and coated only one of the sides. They came out gorgeous. My roommates ate the scraps greedily. If I was to do it again I would of put some more chunks of caramel into the batter, I was afraid of this making them too hard though. Delicious cookies.

Here's the trick for the caramels! 1. Use the Hershey's brand of caramels. 2. Use a paring knife and slice it like you'd slice garlic. 3. take 1/2 cup of the flour, put it into a bowl, and put the chopped caramels into the bowl with the flour. Keeps everything nice and separated. I don't know if it was the brand of caramel, or the flour trick, but it all worked like a charm..

Rich and tasty cookies! To chop the caramels, I first measured out the flour and coated the caramels in the flour before chopping. I think it helped. I tried cooking at 325 for 12 mins., too light, so tried 350 for about 13 mins. That seemed to do the trick. Cooked on a Silpat and let cookies to cool slighty on the cookie sheet before removing. They didn't stick to the pan or spatula. These are best served at room temp. otherwise the caramel is hard and sticky. Used double-chocolate chips instead of a chunk. I might make again, but Jose's chocolate cookies are better and easier!

These cookies tasted really good, but there are a lot of things about the recipe that could be improved upon. For one, I'd certainly try cooking at a lower temp for longer, as the caramels were still fairly hard after cooking them the recommended time and temp. Also, I added milk chocolate chips to the mix, of course that may just be my personal preference! Be prepared to spend a good bit of time on the kitchen, as the caramels are frustrating and time-consuming to chop coarsely. Like I said, though, tastewise, they were great and my family is insisting I make them again!

awsome! I followed the suggestion of baking at 325 for 12 minutes and they came out chewy and soft. I have had to send this recipes to several friends.

These cookies were a disappointment. I expected them to have chewy strings of caramel but it was just hard-to-chew, brittle nastiness. They spread out a lot and the chunks don't appeal the same way chocolate chips do. Of course they taste good if you you make them right, because you can't go wrong with these ingredients, but they are mediocre and if I were you I'd look for a better recipe more worth your time.

I added 1 teaspoon vanilla and baked them at 325 for 12 minutes. I also used parchment and didn't have any problem with sticking. Due to the lower temperature, the cookies came out very soft and the caramels were not hard. They were a big hit and I would definitely make them again.

I made this cookie 5 days ago and they vanished. I'm making another batch today. It's a realyy great cookie to have one hand for whoevery drops by.

This recipe is frustrating to make for the following reasons: 1. the caramels are very difficult to coursely chop as they are soft and stick to the knife and eachother etc. Don't try freezing them as this is not a viable option. 2. when baking the cookies the caramels too close to the bottom of the cookie burn and stick to the baking sheet.

The melted caramel is quite a mess, I've found that spraying the cookie sheet with non-stick cooking spray helps a lot. I also spray the spatula before I lift them off of the sheet. But for all the trouble, these cookies still kick ass! I've made them about 1/2 dozen times and am always asked to make them again.

I substituted white chocolate chips for the bittersweet ones and they were quite good. However, I found the caramel chunks a little to chewy and they turned hard. Cutting the caramels into smaller pieces helped the second time I made them.

Though the cookies tasted quite good, the caramel chunks turned hard (like sugar crystals) after they cooled. Also, the caramel made them very difficult to remove from the baking sheet; they stuck badly. Possibly baking them on parchment or on greased and floured cookie sheets would remedy this problem.
