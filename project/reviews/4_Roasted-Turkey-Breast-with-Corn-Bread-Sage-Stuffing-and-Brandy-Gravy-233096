Made the turkey and stuffing, not the gravy. They were delicious. Took longer than 55 min to cook 1 (1/2 of whole) turkey breast that weighed about 3.5 lbs. Brined it beforehand so didn't need to salt before roasting.. Used olive oil instead of butter for the stuffing and made corn bread from Marie Callender's mix in 8x8 pan that made just a little more than needed for recipe. Yummy!

Finally a way to serve a moist roast turkey breast - and sooooo easy. I used my own stuffing recipe (store bought stuffing with veggies added). Both the turkey and stuffing were appropriately moist with a nice crunch! It took only the 55 minutes noted in the recipe.

This is a good old fashioned recipe for stuffing.

Pretty unimpressed with this recipe in general. The stuffing does not need any egg and I found the flavor of the egg very unpleasant alongside the sage and cornbread. The turkey took much longer than the directed time, and I used a turkey breast half that was almost 50% the size of the one recommended in the recipe. A nice idea but really poorly conceived and written recipe. Would require many tweaks to be passable.

This was delicious. Easy too. The gravy was nothing like what the recipe indicates. After adding the cream, it looked like a milk shake and not at all caramel color. I had to add veal demi glace, and red wine (lots of it) to get a medium brown color. Then I added turkey broth and flour to thicken. I don't know how that gravy is supposed to taste like anything other than cream the way it is written. But, the cornbread stuffing and the turkey breasts were delicious.

My kids (ages 6 and 3), as well as my husband all liked this dish and wanted seconds. The breast turned out very moist (and I didn't make the gravy, which was not necessary). I was very lucky to find this recipe, because is gluten-free and worked out wonderfully. Thanks for sharing!

First of all, I doubled the recipe for an 8.5 lb turkey breast. I bought 6 boxes of Jiffy cornbread mix, made the cornbread the day before and let it sit out for a day so it became stale. I made too much, probably needed only 4 or 5 boxes. Threw the veggies/herbs into a food processor and it took only seconds to chop everything up. The scariest/most treacherous thing was splitting the turkey breast down the middle. Cutting the skin first helped a lot. I used a large knife, and instead of whacking the sternum as suggested, I used a sawing motion which gave me more control. Next time I'm going to used a small hand saw. It only took about 1 hr 40 min to cook the 8.5-lb turkey breast on the stuffing. It came out perfectly! Juicy and flavorful. My guests said it was the best turkey they ever had. It was certainly the best turkey I ever had.

I'm not particularly fond of turkey, especially the breast, but this came out great. I used half of a 5-pound breast that I had the butcher split. Brined the breast using this recipe, Honey-Brined Turkey with Giblet Cream Gravy, reduced appropriately, of course. Roasted for an hour and did not cover the breast. Came out moist and flavourful. To the cook from Arlington, I see your point about the fat and general unhealthiness . . . but stuffing saturated with turkey juices and fat is pretty much the entire point of turkey stuffing, isn't it. ;o) One night of buttery decadence won't hurt you!!

This is a great recipe. A few things.... I removed ALL of the skin on the turkey breasts. I did NOT split the breast into two halves. I used a good sourdough bread instead of the cornbread, added more celery, pistachio nut meat (which I had on hand) and diced red pepper, all of which I sauteed, to the stuffing. I place a piece of aluminum foil over the turket breast for the first 40 minutes and added 1/2 cup of chicken broth to the pan for the last 20 minutes or so, to moisten the stuffing. The turkey was moist and flavorful, as was the stuffing! We'll make this again.

I split the breast as suggested, but instead of making both halves, I only cooked one and saved another (as I was cooking for just two people). The roasting instructions for the turkey breast worked just fine and produced a wonderfully juicy breast. Just the right amount of leftovers (gone before we got sick of eating them), and even a good soup from the frame. Note: I modified the stuffing to work with whatever I had on hand, still worked fine; also I didn't make the gravy, which wasn't necessary at all, that's how juicy the meat was. Highly recommended!

Demi-Glace can be purchased online from Club Sauce. Williams-Sonoma also stocks it.

I usually don´t bother roasting a turkey as it is to much for two people, but I am very glad I tried this one out.The turkey was done in 55 mins, and came out moist and tender. The stufing was quite nice,but I had to change it around to use things I had on hand, like whole wheat bread that I dried in the sun(it was scorchingly hot)and I replaced the celery with dried wild mushrooms whitch suited the sage and turkey taste. Any way what matters is that the method does work with the turkey whatever the bed it lies on!!!

I had my heart set on trying this, but have not been able to find the chicken demi-glace and nobody I asked seems to even know about it. I don't know why anyone would put a recipe in the easy section where one ingredient is practically impossible to fine!

Worked out great with a 3.5-lb single bone-in turkey breast. A yummy Thanksgiving, more than enough for my husband and me.

Used this for our small family on Thanksgiving, it was perfect and tasty. Since them I frequently pick up a single turkey breast from Trader Joe's and fix it for just the two of us,(obviously without the stuffing ) with leftovers for sandwiches and salads. Will be on our menu again next year, but with the stuffing, even if unhealthy.

I didn't get this prepared in under and hour, but I still thought it made a quite tasty turkey.

I will make this again, because it does have great flavor, but it has a big flaw that I'd like to figure out how to fix. When the stuffing is heaped on the bottom of the pan and the turkey roasts on top of it, the stuffing ends up sitting in a deep pool of turkey grease. That (and the meat juice that drips into it) does make the stuffing very moist, but it seems awfully unhealthy. Also, the quality of the cornbread is important. I got mine from the deli department at Safeway, and it was waaaay too sweet. I found the gravy too salty, but I added low-sodium chicken stock and it was fine. The turkey does cook very quickly in this method. However, the headnote's claim that the whole dish can be prepared in "under an hour" is wishful thinking; don't count on it.

I actually screwed this up a fair bit...discovered I had accidentally purchased boneless turkey breast, had to use day old french bread (I dried it in the oven as suggested), used the dried sage and nutmeg I had on hand, and didn't have the demi-glace either. I winged the gravy with chicken stock and made it in the roasting pan after removing the turkey and stuffing. I was astounded at how good it was; the turkey wasn't tough at all and the stuffing was terrific! I thought it would be dry with the boneless meat. I did, however, cover it for the first 1/2 hour or so. My husband loved it. Even raved about the sauce/gravy. I absolutely will make again! De-lish!
