I agree with caerphilly from Nanaimo. It was delicious but a little too simple the first time I made it. Try caerphilly's tweaks and feel free to go heavier on the avocado. It's perfect for hot weather picnics.

Flavourful and original; my guests loved it when served as a first course on a very hot day. I followed the recipe in all but one respect; I used only 6 celery sticks and the celery taste was not dimished at all. I shall certainly make it again.

Quite delicious! I used a bit less EVOO and added about half a teaspoon of dried mint.

I love this recipe and can't wait to make it again this summer. I tend to eat it as a snack since it's very light. The flavors are very soft and subtle, which is a nice change from the savory onion, garlic and herb-heavy recipes I tend to use. I didn't have the almonds on hand when I made it, so I'm expecting it to be even better when I make it correctly next time. Definitely not a taste for everyone, but if you love veggies and enjoy fresh, subtle flavors, it's a win.

Easy, but a bit too simple, I made it twice, the second time I used Chicken Consomme instead of water and Avocado instead of Olive Oil....that really pumped up the complexity. A lovely beginning to a summer meal.
