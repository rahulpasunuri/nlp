I'm making this tonight. It will be about the fourth time. Its so simple, each time I make it I have to look it up because I can't believe it is so simple. Its a great week night meal. Its sum is more than its parts.

This is a staple dinner recipe. The salsa is what makes the dish. It gets my raves for being so simple yet delicious. The chicken by itself is only so-so, but with the avocado salsa to punch it up, is quite nice. Do try this one! And if you can't grill, just pan-fry or bake the chicken.

My husband loves this meal. I add an equal amount of chili powder to the cumin and rub that on the chicken to give it that extra kick. I serve with sliced zucchini, yellow squash, and red onion which are tossed in olive oil, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes and roasted in the oven. End the meal with a very cold caesar salad. Yum!

This was so easy and so tasty. I used avocados fresh off the tree for the salsa and served with Cuban style black beans. Can't wait to make more!!!

Very tasty! And easy to prepare-will be a regular for our dinner table. I made the chicken in the skillet as the BBQ is buried under mounds of snow! Avocado salsa is excellent. Be sure to be liberal with salt and pepper when seasoning chicken before cooking.

I thought the chicken needed something more (or less). But I loved the salsa and have made it several times.

Delicious and moist chicken! This was a very easy recipie for a weekday dinner. I also added tumeric to the chicken and cooked it stovetop and found it to be just fine. The avacado salsa is going to be one of our new favorites!

This was a great simple chicken recipe! I made just the breasts to accompany black bean soup and cornbread. There was a lot of cumin in the soup recipe, so the flavors were harmonious. I squeezed fresh lime juice on the breasts after they came out. The only suggestion I have is to make sure cooks add enough salt (to their taste). Next time I'll try the avocado salsa.

A big thank you to the cooks who reviewed this recipe with a "thumbs up". I thought it was fabulous, delicious and easy to make, even though it did consist of "chicken and one spice", to quote another reviewer. By the way, the avocado salsa is an integral part of the recipe, so I wouldn't discount that particular ingredient as not being a part of the spices required. The avocado salsa was terrific by the way, and a perfect accompaniment to the chicken. I added cilantro, garlic powder & a dash of cayenne to the salsa to spice it up a bit. I used Kosher boneless, skinless chicken breasts, at the recommendation of a friend, which are pre-brined, delicious & moist (I never knew!). Also, I cooked the breasts in olive oil on the stove-top, which worked out very well & I topped them with sautéed onions, then the salsa. Divine!

It was a hit, i will be making this again. The salsa needed a bit of salt and black pepper.

I agree with other cooks, I substituted the simple cumin recipe for the posted Cuban Mojo Chicken recipe (only the marinade) but made the salsa. I liked the salsa only I would definately cut down on the amount of salt and a little less fresh lime juice (but just a little less). GREAT salsa.

How can you can call something a "recipe" that consists of chicken and one spice?! I tried it based on the reviews and it tasted as I expected it would: chicken with a lot of cumin on it. I did like the avocado salsa.

Unbelievably easy and delicious - what a concept!!! I used bonelss and skinless chicken breasts, and the rub worked just fine, resulting in a moist and flavorful outcome. I didn't do the salsa, instead made curried basmati rice and ratatouille as accompaniments, but this recipe leaves itself open to many possibilities. This will become a staple on my main course list.

Yum yum yummy! This meal was soooo tasty. I'm glad I have enough for leftovers for lunch! I didn't really bother with measurements for the cumin the chicken breasts. So easy to make! For the avocado salsa (guacamole, really), I left out the oil (avocado's rich enough!) and the jalapeno. we ate this with a turmeric-flavored rice and a spinach/orange/red onion/goat cheese/walnut salad.

Very tasty. We've actually had a similar dish with the salsa, accompanying cajun blakened swordfish steaks. Add a little (1-2 tsp) Cilantro to your salsa for extra flavor.
