Even though I made several adjustments, this dish is yummy.I only used 1 bag of spinach, used short grain rice, and got really friendly with the lemons. I intend on making this dish again!

Welllll... there is just no way to cook this much spinach in the time called for... so - I used 2/3 amt of spinach - cooked it for at least 10 minutes - and added a little feta in the end and it was quite tasty.... (also took alot longer for rice to absorb broth---is there a mistake in this recipe?).

I've made this a couple of times and I love it. It's yummy without making you feel like you are eating something "bad". I agree lots of lemon is the key.

spinach + rice + butter&oil + garlic + lemon...what's not to like? i love dishes like this. p.s. leftovers make great rice cakes, or baked in an 8x8" dish and cut into squares for a yummy snack.

This is a great recipe! Would definately make it again. Don't even think of using dried herb! Doesn't taste nearly as good. Heavy on the lemon for more flavor too!!

I agree with the last reviewer. This was awful and a huge waste of rice and spinach. Not adding to my recipe box!!

UNIMPRESSED!! HUGE let down after reading all the reviews here. All this is sautéed spinach mixed with rice pilaf. If you never made either one of those dished before then I assume you'll love and rave about this recipe. If you looking for an exciting way to cook spinach then this recipe is not the one. You'd be better off keeping these dishes separate. It's simply spinach and a rice pilaf thrown together and the final look and presentation is rather ugly. Keep these dished apart from each other. They do not add anything new to the palette once mixed together. Keep looking if you are searching for innovative spinach recipes, like I was!

Very tasty. We made this with fresh spinach from our garden. We substituted leeks for shallots and chicken broth was substituted for a veggie broth. I topped it off with a finely grated fresh Gruyere cheese and coursely ground pepper. It was fabulous. Highly reccommended.

Good, easy, and versatile. Have made it adding leftover wild rice w/almonds (another recipe on this sight). I cooked the rice in chicken broth for added flavor.

This was a very nice dish. I thought it was fairly easy and very tasty. I did follow the suggestions of other reviewers in using half the amount of spinach in the recipe. I also added lemon zest and a hand full of parmsean to the dish, at the end. It turned out yummy and would be a great do-ahead dish for a buffet or dinner party. I will be making this dish again soon.

This was pretty good. I also made it with brown rice (add more liquid and increase cooking time considerably) and used only 3 6-oz. bags of baby spinach. All that butter with the shallots and sauteed garlic made this a little too heavy for my liking, and I found I had to add a lot more lemon juice (1/2 lemon's worth) to cut through the heaviness and to be noticeable. Also, be sure to drain off the extra liquid from the spinach after sauteeing - otherwise the rice might turn gummy after adding it in. I'd make this again, but with less butter.

I can't say enough good things about this recipe. It is delicious, healthy, and easy to make. I used brown rice and have also made it with broccoli instead of spinach.

This recipe was great. I added sliced sundried tomatoes with the garlic and the dish had an added kick of flavor. I could not really taste the lemon so next time I will add lemon zest.

The lemon provided a nice zang to this dish. I added a touch of nutmeg and 4 tablespoons of shredded parmesan. Fantasti! However, the spinach called for is too much. I used 12-14 oz of baby spinach and it was perfect.

This was a very nice dish. The rice was great, though I agree with other reviewers that the amount of spinach specified is excessive. I used a 16 oz bag and felt liek it was plenty.

We loved this new side dish. I served it with lemon basil chicken and used brown rice. (I only needed 1 big bag of spinach-not as many as the recipe calls for). Super easy and healthy too.
