Surprisingly elegant way to put extra arugula to good use. The sweetness of the cherry tomatoes on top makes it a complete summer meal, fresh out of the garden.

Yuck. Used fresh, spicy arugula from the garden, and fresh tomatoes also from the garden. Followed the recipe to the letter. The first few bites were "interesting," but after a while, my husband and I both realized we couldn't bear to finish the meal. Probably better with store-bought arugula, which is less spicy. I still have a lot of this pesto left over, and I'm not sure how I'm going to be able to use it. Sad :(

I had a bumper crop of arugula to use so gave this a try. It was fantastic! Other than cutting back on the salt, I made it exactly as written. A definite addition to the recipe file.

Good recipe...I added some meatballs and thought that helped! Quite tasty!

Oh, I forgot to address salt. I realize now that I forgot to salt the arugula puree, which suited me just fine. The pasta was cooked in salt water and the tomatoes had a healthy sprinkling of salt and that was just fine.

SO GOOD. (By which I mean it's not going to turn heads at a fancy dinner party, but it's going to knock the socks off of your unwitting Tuesday night dinner companions.) The pine nuts (which I forgot to toast) gave this pasta a creamy richness that balanced the other flavors really well. The arugula tasted fresh and grassy (owing in part to a lovely, grassy olive oil), and the tomatoes were thick and sweet - almost caramelized. Together, this was a hugely satisfying and incredibly easy dish I would make again and again. Since I made this with leftover ingredients and was only feeding two people, my proportions were probably off. I used: About a tablespoon of pine nuts, About a third of a plastic tub of baby arugula, A healthy amount of good-quality olive oil, About 2 tablespoons of freshly grated pecorino, with more sprinkled on top at the end, One pint package of cherry tomatoes, Half a box of linguine, and Two sizeable garlic cloves. Otherwise, I followed the recipe quite closely. Keeping the tomatoes whole was new to me, but they were wonderful to eat. I hope others will have the same luck I did - this one is a keeper.

Right about the salt, cut it in half. Besides that, it's fresh and delightful! Added sun-dried tomatoes and left the garlic in.

whoa- hold the salt! 1 teaspoon of salt in the pesto is waaaaaay too much. It's overpowering. I feel like I wasted a beautiful bunch of fresh, spring arugula :(

Amazing!!! This is an absolute crowd pleaser and everyone I have ever made it for raves about it. Also a great alternative for those who dislike basil pesto (I know, I know, can you believe they really exist?!) Sometimes I add a pre-made marinara or vodka sauce to the cherry tomatoes, if I don't have many cherry tomatoes on hand. I also add red pepper flakes to the tomato sauce to give it a little kick. TRY THIS RECIPE!

I followed the example of the cook from Boston, who roasted the tomatoes - excellent suggestion. I used a shell pasta (like Conchiglie) instead of fettuccine, which worked well.

After reading the review about cooking the tomatoes (I found the recipe lacking in its description about how to actually cook them), I opted to slice the tomatoes pole-to-pole, toss them with sliced garlic, salt, sugar, olive oil and a bit of vinegar and roast them in a 350-degree oven for 20 minutes. Then I tossed this with the pesto (I added a bit more cheese) and pasta and served it to rave reviews. Really a satisfying dish with all the strong flavors.

Tasty and easy, although next time I will cut the salt back just a bit. A word of caution: hot oil + tomatoes = a lot of spitting. Stand back!

Absolutely delicious! I see from one earlier reviewer that he/she found it bitter. Make sure to use baby arugula for best results.

This was yummy! A refreshing and tasty change from the usual pestos. We gently combined the puree and tomatoes together in the pan just before serving, and also added a few finely chopped sun dried tomatoes to the cooking cherry tomatoes. The intense sweetness of the former provided a nice foil to the mildly bitter taste of the arugula. We'll definitely make this again!

I am going to add this to my regular repertoire. The pesto was fresh tasting and the tomato sauce added just enough sweetness to offset the spicy character of the arugula. And, it was super quick and easy!

This recipe is a loser all around. I love arugula, but the taste became bitter rather than peppery when pureed. I can't say anything good about the tomato sauce either. When you saute cherry tomatoes until "collapsed but not falling apart", you're left with unappetizing skins and tons of tiny seeds. The puree and the tomato sauce totally clashed and made for a very disappointing dish. If you like the combination of tomatoes and arugula, try one of Biba Caggiano's recipes. My favorite calls for canned plum tomatoes pureed through a food mill and sauteed in garlic and olive oil. Cooked pasta is then added to the sauce and tossed with arugula and grated cheese. Simple and delicious.
