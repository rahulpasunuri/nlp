Delicious. I cut down on the onion per earlier reviews and ignored the 1/2 tsp salt and just added to taste. I also put some white pepper into the soup. Next time I'll try some fresh tarragon on top.

Made this for dinner last night and everyone loved it even my husband who also hates asparagus. Made the following modifications in an effort to cut down on prep time. I just snapped off the woody ends, rinsed, drizzled w/ olive oil, sprinkled with salt and pepper, then roasted the asparagus in a 550 degree oven for about 15 minutes or so until tender. I roughly chopped the asparagus and added to the soup to simmer for about 5-7 minutes to meld the flavors and further tenderize the asparagus. I used olive oil to saute onions and then deglazed them with about 1/2 cup white wine. This gave the soup a slightly smoky note with more depth of flavor. Finally, didn't have cream on hand so I used Trader Joe's French Village Cream Line Plain Yogurt with fresh basil from the garden and salt in the blender. I agree that the basil cream is essential to the flavoring of the soup. The kids want it for dinner again tonight. My 7yr old took the leftover in a thermos for lunch today.

This soup was good, but not outstanding. I made it exactly as written. The proportion of onions to asparagus may have been what I didn't like - just didn't get a strong asparagus flavor. After deciding the basil cream wasn't going to do much for it, one of my guests tried it and loved it. So then we all added it. Definitely gave it some pzazz!

Very good, but not spectacular. The soup itself tasted fine, but the drizzle turned out very runny, very salty, and, amazingly, lacking in basil flavor. Additionally, the drizzle was practically the same color as the soup. Next time, I will omit the basil altogether and add more salt to the soup.

I've been looking for a really good cream of asparagus soup for my vegetarian friends. This soup is fabulous, very easy and of course, since I want it creamed just add cream at end. My whole family loves it. PS you can substitue broccoli and get cream of broccoli for the asparagus and still get the great vegetable taste.Many thanks for listing this basic recipe.

Simple elegance. Needed a little balance as I found that 2 medium onions was overpowering. Switched to shallots to taste. You could use 1/2 of a medium onion for a less lusty onion flavor. The basil cream was too salty so I cut the salt in half. I used Orrington Farms Gourmet Soup Base and made broth that way. This product is far above any cube or powder mix. I also use it in my chicken soup to taste to add depth to the flavor. Not salty, not artificial tasting.

This is a great recipe after it was helped. I found it to be lacking in taste (prior to adding the cream) and had to doctor it up a bit. I added garlic powder and a couple tablespoons of flour to thicken - it was way to runny. A bit more salt and pepper and it turned out great. The cream really makes the dish excellent. I had no trouble swirling it in the middle, some sunk to the bottom but most stayed on the top. I will definitely be making this again and again - a great starter.

The soup itself was good with a delicate flavor. The basil cream was a bit of a problem, however. It was too runny and sank to the bottom of the bowl. I put it in a squeeze bottle and tried to make a pattern on top of the soup, which did not work. The basil added a nice taste, though. Next time, I'll mix chopped basil with room temp sour cream and dollp it atop the soup.

I made this yesterday then reheated it and made the basil cream sauce tonight. It was excellent and would make an elegant yet easy do-ahead first course. I served it following a large salad and my husband asked for seconds. The basil cream gives it a specialness without adding too many extra calories!

This soup was excellent and had wonderful presentation value. The basil cream gave it a nice touch of richness and extra flavor. It was a big hit at my dinner party!

This soup is yummy and easy--I didn't have fresh basil, but I did have pesto on hand, and folded that into creme fraiche as a topping for the soup--delish!

I was forced into Opal Basil for the Cream Sauce and purple drizzled on the green soup looked a lot like something out of Star Trek, but tasted wonderful. Food from Mars rarely captures the asparagus flavor so richly and I added a little extra cream for texture. I'll do it again within the month.

This recipe had rave reviews, however, I felt it was not creamy enough and that although it had 3 pounds of asparagus it still tasted like a watery basil soup. My family was very dissapointed with it!

Delicious! I made this for a small dinner party and there was hardly any left over. One person wanted to know where I got the recipe, she said she made it the next day for her vegetable-hating husband and he devoured it.

This is an excellent dish for a holiday or special occasion - easy, elegant and delicious. Even a picky dieting teenager went back for seconds! I would suggest putting the pureed soup through a sieve to remove all tiny fibers for a truly luxurious creamy texture.

Struggled with fourth fork - soup was absolutely wonderful with a true essence of asparagas. I added 1/2 tsp. of garam masala for different dimension. Very attractive and appealing dish. Would suggest you be very careful with seasoning throughout preparation. Could tend to be bland if not seasoned sufficiently. Great recipe and the basil cream was the crowning glory! Already passed the recipe around to the office. Will definitely be added to my recipe file!

Outstanding, though the basil cream was difficult to "drizzle." Our guests inhaled the soup, and we were all disappointed that there wasn't enough for seconds!

Excellent. Made this ahead and it was devine. He must have loved it too, because he says that was the night he decided to marry me!

This recipe is very good with or without the basil cream. My family really enjoyed it.
