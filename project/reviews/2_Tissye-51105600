Thought it would be fantastic given the ingredients, but it's just okay. The yogurt needs more tahini and garlic than the recipe calls for - it simply tasted like greek yogurt or sour cream when I prepared it as written. The chickpeas also need more cumin - one teaspoon for 3 1/2 cups of chickpeas doesn't go very far. I will make it again, just with some adjustments.
