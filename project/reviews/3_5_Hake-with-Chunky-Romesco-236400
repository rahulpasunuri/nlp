Really delicious and different. I accidentally browned the almonds and bread a little too much, and it was still amazing. Be sure to season sufficiently with salt and pepper.

The romesco sauce for the fish was delicious and added a very nice texture. I felt the fish itself - I did use hake - was bland and its texture was a bit mealy. I would make this again but may also try the sauce with other proteins.
