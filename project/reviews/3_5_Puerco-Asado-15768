Very good. I couldn't give it exceptional, but I loved explosion of lime & cumin as I ate the pork. Had a smaller roast than described, so I cut the "covered" times to 45 mintues each, then watched through the uncovered stage until I reached an internal temp of 160 near the bone. It came out great. Served with "Roasted eggplant & Red Pepper" from Epi and YUM!

We thought that it was delicious. I did not have a full cup of lime juice so I used about a third of a cup of lemon juice with the lime juice. I also used cider vinegar. Easy to make and good

Does anyone know what the internal temperature should be when it is done? I cooked mine to 180 degrees and it was a bit dry in areas. I would have liked it to be more moist.

I have made this ten times over the last couple of years. Whenever this cut of pork is on sale, I buy it and keep it in the freezer. It is an amazing feast meal to have with friends. I serve it with yellow rice and green beans and do not bother any more with trying to make the skin edible.

This is easy and delicious. I used white wine instead of water and then deglazed the roasting pan with more wine to use as a sauce.

I also used the bones that came with my piece of meat. Really nice tasting. It's different.

This is my fifth time cooking with this recipe. It is better each time than the previous one. We have a big family, and this recipe go a long way,very economical.

Yummy! I cut the garlic down a little and like to add about a half-cup of fresh orange juice, more like the sour oranges used in Cuba. The leftovers make awesome sandwiches. Save leftover pan sauce for sandwich dipping! I have shared this recipe many times... makes everyone happy!

I just did a search under "enhanced" for lamb in Indian cuisine and came up with this, Cuban pork. Something is not working well here.

In Atlanta, there is a fantasic Cuban restaurant hidden off the beaten path called Las Palmeras. I found this recipe, hoping to duplicate the Puerco Asado from Las Palmeras. To my surprise, this Puerco Asado came out of the oven even better! Tender AND tasty! Only changes I made to the recipe: I marinated the pork roast (rotating regularly) for a good 12 hours in the Cuban marinating sauce "Mojo Criollo" (can be found these days at most grocery stores). Also, I found the recipe's cooking times to be confusing, as they are currently described. I ended up cooking it uncovered for 1/2 an hour, covered for 1 hour, marinated then covered again for another 1 hour...and then finally cooking uncovered for about 40 minutes. Too much time. I'd reduce the "covered" time to 1-1/2 hours, and the final "uncovered" time to about 30 minutes, depending on the size of the roast. Regardless, it turned out great. This is now definitely "my" way of doing Puerco Asado.

This was very good. I think that it might need to cook longer with a cover, however as mine seemed to be getting charred on the outside a bit while the meat inside was quite pink. The pan juices were awesome!

Wow!! We loved it! Served it with cuban-style rice and beans, yucca, and fried plantains. We actually used the same roast - (bone in) but couldn't find one with skin. It still turned out great!

I have a question about this recipe: has anyone tried to make it with a boneless/skinless pork shoulder roast (Boston Butt)? I'm just wondering how much of a difference it would make. Any input would be appreciated!

I made this for a party of 8 guys at our summer beach rental last year and it was a hit. The best part was putting it in the oven and being able to hang out by the pool while it cooked - just checking in every once in a while. Then, once the sun went down, and everyone had rinsed off the day - one amazing pork roast dinner was ready to go!

This is an absolutely authenticly Cuban recipe. It is so easy to make! Very little prep time--most of the time involved is just cooking time where the roast is sitting in the oven. If you have ever had Cuban roast pork in a good Cuban restaurant or prepared by a Cuban cook at home, you will love this recipe.

Wonderful Sunday night dinner in the winter when you need a hint of warm climates. I did cut out the garlic and still found it to be a great dish.

Absolutely delicious - I bought a 3.5 lb. roast since it was just two of us, and (3) limes but followed the recipe to a "t" w/ the rest of the ingredients since we love lots of flavor! Cut the cooking time in half and it turned out perfect! Moist and delicious...recommend highly!!!

My family loved this recipe. I would definitely make it again. It is a great recipe for company as well. The flavor is wonderful.

While it tasted great, it was a little labor intensive. Plus, manipulating a big slab of pig skin can be a bit disconcerting.

Turns out very tender and the sauce is a great compliment. We served it with plantains and rice.

I have made this recipe for many groups of guests, and it is tangy and tender. I add the juice of one orange to it, as well, and it makes it a bit richer. Great for large groups. I am not Cuban, and my Cuban friends tell me I make a mean Puerco Asado!
