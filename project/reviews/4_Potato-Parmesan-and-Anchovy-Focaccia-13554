This recipe is absolutely fabulous! The potato makes the focaccia soft, moist, light and fluffy. I did not have anchovy paste and just used 1/2 a mashed anchovy instead. I cut the coarse salt by about a third; the parmesean has a tang that makes so much unneccessary. Rave reviews and clean plates from everyone at my lunch table. (Paired with snapper it was wonderful!).

This is just delicious. I have not baked much with potatoes before. This made a surprisingly light and tasty bread. The potato topping with the garlic rosemary oil is wonderful. Don't leave out the anchovy paste; it adds a wonderfully subtle touch. My mandoline must make very thin slices as I could only get about 1/3 of the sliced potatoes on top and that was stacking them in at least 3 layers. I also think I would use a larger jelly roll pan than called for. But this is just great as a bread side dish or a pizza-like lunch.
