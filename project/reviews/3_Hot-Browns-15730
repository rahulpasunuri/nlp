I only rated this 2 forks because I made so many modifications that I felt it would be misleading. I combined the other Hot Brown recipe from Gourmet with this one; I added cayenne pepper and also used 1/2 cup parmesean and 1/2 cup cheddar - this helps the color of the sauce a great deal. It needs a generous helping of salt. I also made the roux with equal parts of butter and flour since that is how it is typically done. My sauce turned out very thick. Could probably do without the heavy cream - can't figure out what it added. I also made the recipe in a tart dish, with crumbled bacon on top for 3 of us. Not much leftover! We all loved it. Served with asparagus - a nice light side dish with butter and lemon.
