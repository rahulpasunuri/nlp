Simple, fast, and delicious - exactly what I needed to accompany a lamb dish. I halved the recipe and used a regular cucumber instead of the hot house cucumber. Made more than needed for two people with some left-over.

Very fresh & cool tasting - delightful accompaniment for curry. Easy - made it exactly as written, except used nonfat Greek yogurt.

This is a great recipe. To reduce the calories I used Greek nonfat yogurt (Fage or Chobani)which is very thick. It is so thick and creamy no one would ever know it is nonfat!! Great for dipping veggies too.

I make this all the time only I don't strain my yogurt and I always add the juice of 1/2 a lemon. I also add a pinch of garlic powder. I use European style yogurt. It's very good and excellent served along Naan bread.

Best Raita recipe on Epicurious.

Very good....drained my Nancy's lowfat yogurt in a coffee filter in a mesh strainer for an hour, and squeezed the water out of the cucumber with a potato ricer. Makes a good fire extinguisher for my Chicken Phall :)

This is so easy and so good. I barely strained the yogurt (maybe an hour?) before adding the seasoning and thought it was perfect. Have made this twice - first time with mint as called for (fabulous) and the second time last minute no mint so I subbed parsley which was fine. Will keep this in rotation to go with grilled chicken, flatbread, etc. Yum!

Very good. A clove of garlic, minced, would be good. I drained the yogurt before using it.

This is a great recipe. I would add a little more cumin. Very easy; healthy and refreshing too.

I made this with "Home style Greek Yogurt," manufactured by Krinos. This yogurt is very thick, so the raita was the perfect consistency, without straining.

I haven't made this recipe but I often make tzatziki sauce, which is very similar. To make a thicker sauce without sacrificing flavor (like the one cook that strained the whole mixture at the end), strain the yogurt before you add it to the other ingredients. I usually do this through a coffee filter that's sitting in a fine-mesh strainer over a container to catch the liquid. You can also substitute cheese cloth or a lightly moistened piece of paper towel. It only takes a couple of hours.

This gets served with the flat bread recipe on Epic. For easier pick up I strained the mixture briefly to make it thicker. Light, summery, very unique.

Fixed this for a dinner party where the theme was Indian food. Put together with Tandoori chicken, from this site and peach chutney, again from this site, along with indian potato salad (suprise) from this site, brought many ohs and ahs from those that have been to India. Loved the combo. A curried califlower and potato veggie rounded it out. Use Indian peppers if you can find them, or seranno peppers easily found at most grocers. Have an Indian beer to go with it...
