To Stevecooks, why do you blast the recipe and give it one fork when you didn't even make it???

Okay, I get it. There are indeed jerk/Caribbean marinades available in stores. I enjoy them and have used them. However, I was looking for a recipe on how to make Jerk shrimp. The dish sounds delicious, but the recipe made me laugh.

Shrimp was spicy and delicious.

My husband & I both thought this was OUTSTANDING! I made about 15 shrimp for the 2 of us (6 would never do). Grilled for 5 min over indirect heat. I accidentally bought 2 different kinds of cantaloupe instead of a cantaloupe & honeydew but still loved the salsa and it was perfect with the shrimp! To those who comment about the amount of cilantro, when you're not sure about the amount, add a little at a time and taste it before dumping the full amount in.

Good, and easy. I made a different fruit salsa, just because all I had was nectarines. I chopped them with sweet onion, jalapeno, basil and added some lime juice and salt. It was great, and went well with the shrimp. I put the shrimp under the broiler instead of grilling it- took about 2 minutes a side.

I didn't bother with the salsa, but the shrimp is amazing. I spoke to a Jamaican woman who had never heard of putting lime juice with Jerk spice, and my father never did either when he made it when I was a child. This is now in my weekly circulation.

Very good salsa. If you don't like so much cilantro, just add less. Also, make sure you use good jerk seasoning, not the generic store brand. Try this stuff...Walkerswood Spices The second time I made this I tried something a little different that I think improved the taste of the shrimp. Try combing the oil and jerk seasoning with the melon salsa ingediants. Wrap the shrimp around pieces of cantelope and the skewer. Then marinate the shrimp in the marinade mixture for 30 minutes or so. Cook the shrimp over high heat and brush on more marinade while cooking. Excellent!!!

The shrimp were awesome, but the salsa was only ok. The reason I say this is that there was too much cilantro - it overpowered everything else. Also, I think it would be a lot better with some spice to it, like maybe one finely diced jalapeno.

The shrimp was great, and the salsa was nice with it. However, I made this recipe for 8, and had WAY too much salsa and not enough shrimp. Next time, I'll make it with more shrimp per person and about 1/3 as much salsa. I accompanied it with the Mango Salad also from this site and some rice, I believe.

i followed the recipe exactly, and i felt that while the shrimp was superb, and the salsa worked well with it, there was too much cilantro and lime juice, so that i didn't enjoy the salsa by itself. . .
