I've never made a flan before but this sounded delicious and quite simple to make. Indeed, it was about as simple as I can imagine and it turned out *beautifully*. I used only one can of sweetened condensed milk and made up the remainder with whole milk. It was still quite sweet enough and I'm glad not to make it any sweeter.

Maybe I didn't make it correctly... the sugar melting worked fine, but after the prescribed oven time, the flan wasn't "set" in the center. So I cooked it longer... and longer... finally after 30 minutes over, I decided "set" or not, the flan was coming out of the oven. Then when it was time to take it out of the dish, it wouldn't come out. We scraped it out and ate it. It was okay, but not worth all that work. :-(

This is by far my favorite flan recipe. I've eaten it only once at Fonda San Miguel and was blown away. I love the light flavor and density of the custard. It is my favorite dish to bring to any gathering. I occasionally omit the almonds because I don't always want the crunch.

Took the suggestion of adding a bit of almond extract which significantly ramped up the flavor of almond; might not be to the liking of all.I also used 1 can of condensed milk, making up the restwith whole milk...worked well.Almonds provided a nice, slightly crunchy crust. My family was not wild about the desert but I think only because they are not flan fans.

I've tried and tried to like flan, but it just wasn't meant to be......until this. I made this for dinner with friends thinking I would have a couple bites to enjoy with the company. I couldn't stop! Now, I know why people love this stuff! Definitely will be making again and soon.

This flan is scrumptious. My husband and I can't get enough of it... However, I had a hard time getting the sugar to melt as it was clumpy- eventually I was able too and then I cooled it till it hardened... but after cooking and cooling overnight it was just liquid sugar on the bottom. Any suggestions? This was a pre-make for a party so I will be making it again soon and even if the sugar doesn't work, it is still beautiful and very tasty!

I give this 3 forks as written; but with some modifications, it can become a 4 forks dessert. I reduce the sugar to 1/2 and I only add 1 can sweetened condensed milk, making up the rest with whole milk. I add 2 tablespoons of amaretto to the batter, to complement the almonds. Spectacular! I get rave reviews every time. It is the only flan recipe I follow.

This is delicious. I'm not a big fan of custard type desserts but this was worth trying. I added slivered almonds to the base (w/ the melted sugar) and also to the recipe as called for. I also, as another reviewer mention added some almond extract to the batter as i love that flavour. Turned out perfectly.

Where is the "cruncy almond crust on the bottom" that the description states?

I loved this recipe !! I made it for my gourmet group. I used organic sugar for the carmelization and slivered & toasted almonds in the bottom of 8 buttered ramikens in place of 1 large pan. I added a 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract to the flan and did not add the almonds to the flan mixture as called for in the recipe. The results were excellent !!

Great, easy recipe. I didn't have a 9 inch round pan that was 3 inches high, so I used one that was 1 inch high. The flan just barely fit in, but it did make it easy to remove it onto the platter.
