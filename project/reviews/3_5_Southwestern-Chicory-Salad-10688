Great dressing! Make ahead so flavors blend. Used mandarin oranges when in a hurry.

We live in Florida so get a lot of wonderful oranges from friends' trees and need new recipes. This is a keeper. To the dressing, I also added 1-2 cloves minced garlic, 1/2 t salt and omitted the vinegar because of all the juice created when I prepared the oranges. Will use this recipe again when trying to use up oranges.

might use slightly less chile powder, but add a bit a cayenne for a kick. A little garlic as well. Really very, very good. If you can't find arugula, the escarole makes an excellent subsitute.
