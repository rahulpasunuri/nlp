Delicious! I omitted the onion and garlic because of food allergies, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. Everyone loved the combination of flavors.

Outstanding!!! Terrific blend of flavors. Easy to prepare. Perfect for a warm summer night. Must use fresh oregano for the best flavor. Used 2 cloves of garlic, medium shrimp and 4 oz. or crumbled feta. Not a morsel left. Will make again and again!

This was a great summer salad! I used Romas because I like the flavor better, and I also didn't have any fresh oregano. The feta is such a perfect touch to this vegetable and shrimp dish, and the grilled peppers and pita croutons were really good. I will definitely make it again!

I left out the tomatoes and used whole wheat pita, and this salad turned out wonderful! I loved the method of marinated the red onions/cucumbers in the dressing while everything else grilled. My BF thought there was too much shrimp, but I thought the proportions and flavors were perfect. This is an exceptionally easy and tasty dinner for a hot summer night. It's definitely going into my weeknight rotation.

fabulous and a crowd pleaser! great and light for summer freshness. delicious. the only thing to keep in mind is that the pita croutons will get soggy when it comes to left-overs, so you may want to keep it on the side.

This is a great summer dish. Add extra garlic and oregano plus lots of salt and pepper. I put on a bed of baby greens. Will add greek olives next time.

I haven't made the salad yet but the dressing is great. Exactly what I had been looking for when making a greek salad!

This dish was absolutely fabulous. So tasty and my family loved it. I used the whole cucumber in the salad, and grilled the pita, yellow pepper and shrimp in a grill basket. I served the pita triangles on the side and cut the yellow pepper into bite-sized peices before grilling. Easy, delicious and healthy!

To the cook from Roosevelt, NJ - Why did you even bother to try this recipe, you totally changed EVERYTHING!!!!! You tried to make a Greek dish, Italian.

This recipe was terrific. It was simple, tasty and healthy meal. Fresh oregano is one of the keys to the great taste. I wouldn't change one thing.

I hate to be the lone naysayer but this was awful! The flavors just didn't come together. The peppers were harsh and dominated the recipe. Even my very diplomatic husband said "there are better recipes to use".

Delicious! I substituted basil for the oregano and mozzerella for the feta. Instead of grilling pitas, I grilled some italian bread brushed with olive oil and sprinkled with garlic powder, and served the bread alongside the salad. Excellent hot summer night dinner.

This was so easy to prepare. The textures and flavors in the dish made this a definite repeat in our house. The salad was also special enough for summertime company.

This was an excellent main course salad. It was a little dicey in cooking everything in time on schedule, but it was worth it. I prepared everything and my husband grilled. It turned out great. I used whole wheat pitas, but just regular cucumber which I peeled entirely. Even my 6 yr. old son ate it! This was very good! I highly recommend this! Unusual and perfect for a hot night.
