I agree with Boy City - - SELF mag recipes generally kind of SUCK. They're lousy both on epi and in the actual magazine (which I unfortunately subscribed to a couple years ago). This was a typical SELF recipe - - off kilter. I'd give it no forks if I could.

Although the taste of this dish was rather good, it turned into complete mush. I would drain the diced tomatoes before putting them into the sauce mixture. Also, unless you like spicy food I would cut down the number of chiles you use. I used all four, and it was quite piquant--which is something that I like--but I am not sure why you would go to the trouble of soaking the shrimp in lime juice when the chiles overwhelm the entire dish. The subtle mixing of flavors found in, say, an Indian curry is not apparent here...

I think the overpower some people found is probably the 4 chipotles -- one's enough, 'round here, as they're hot hot hot. Perhaps maybe I make it differently, but it's been delicious every time.

This recipe was really good. I would have added more quesadillas, but other than that, it tasted really good. I think that all of the negative reviews are only because people didn't realize that they aren't supposed to use packaged mix and that the bolded text is a clickable link. Next time, read the reviews first!

Like many of you I made what I thought was a few smal changes to the recipe but came out with something different. I enjoyed this and will make it again.

Why do we continue to get recipes from "Self" magazine? I can't remember one that was worth mentioning. It doens't matter if it's a "health conscious" dish - If no one eats it and dives into a frozen pizza to fill the void than thats not healthy!! My biggest problem with this dish was that you could NOT taste the shrimp. Everything overpowered it. No I have much healthier alternatives for shrimp dishes that actually taste good. Epicurious -STOP USING "SELF" MAGAZINE FOR RECIPES!!

My recipe came out pretty good. However, I made some changes to it: Instead of using the broccoli, I just cooked the onions, garlic and bell pepper together and then added the tomatoes and serrano chiles (instead of chipotle)and cooked the sauce down to thicken it. I used low fat mexican style shredded cheese and added some chopped fresh mexican onions (like green onions but with more flavor) on top of each layer. I would definitely make this again.

I, too, followed the recipe and have to agree: Not worth the effort. My husband just sat and picked out the shrimp, pushing the rest away. I reheated the leftovers for breakfast to see if they had improved. Not by enough.

There is a lot of confusion around this recipe and the 4 others that were featured with it on page 170 of the October issue of Self magazine. 5 recipes for 5 nights come out of one shopping trip and 2 hours of cooking the first night -- here are the original article and recipes: http://www.self.com/fooddiet/2009/10/cook-once-eat-healthy-all-week-slideshow

This was terrible. i made this for my boss and her family and instead of eating it they had a frozen pizza which I ever preferred. Don't make this. Its truly, as my daughter would have put it, "barfy."

This isn't made with packet mixes. If you click on the bold it takes you to how you make the mixes.

Such a shame, this looked good (pic) but a recipe with not ONE but TWO packet mixes...ewwww! Sorry, but I'll be skipping this one too.
