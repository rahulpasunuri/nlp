I think this was great. I made it to use up some extra nuts that were in the freezer...it's pretty forgiving. I used the sunflower seeds and almonds that were called for, and also added a few macadamia nuts and pecans in place of the walnuts. I used milk instead of water and powdered milk and I think it was fine...not sure what the difference would have been. I used a little more than half a cup of 2% milk. Also increased the vanilla and maple to 1 tsp+. Also used quick oats. Next time the only thing I would try is adding some raisins.

My husband and kids loved this granola. I didn't have dry milk or old fashioned oats so instead just used quick oats. Also substituted maple syrup for honey and maple extract. With the addition of dried fruits this was irresistible. Only gave it three stars because of all the changes.

I have made this many times and have found the following substitutions make for a better granola. I omit the dry milk powder since it makes the chunks stick together in huge clumps. I bake at 225 F for 2.5 hours and add nuts and dried fruit only in the last 20 minutes of baking otherwise they burn. I add 3/4 cup of oat bran plus I sub out the honey for maple syrup. I also evenly spread the mixture between 2 shallow baking pans. It's a huge hit when relative visit and everyone wants the recipe to take home!

This is much less sweet than many other granolas. I substituted wheat germ in place of the flour. It needed to be baked much longer than the recipe calls for to become browned and crisp. I would bake it in a larger pan the next time.

This is a great recipe. I added sesame seeds, coconut chips, and cinnamon. Kids loved it too.

Have not yet made recipe but have a question (granola-making newbie): I notice that this recipe says it will keep for two weeks. Is that because it uses oil instead of butter? I'm a butter fan and was thinking about substituting it for the veg oil but am now reconsidering, since I notice some of the other granola recipes that use butter don't have nearly the shelf life. So, even if I refrigerated (and used butter) would I still be looking a 2-3 day use window? Thanks!

We are granola junkies and this is the best recipe for big, 1"-1.5" fat chunks of granola. It may seem like a lot of flour and milk powder, but just follow the recipe and you will not be disappointed. You can add any dried fruit or nuts that you like, as long as it is mostly towards the end of cooking or they will burn. I toast this at 250-275 for 75 minutes because I like the granola to be crispy. A testament: Tonight my husband and I were in the bulk section at Whole Foods and he said, "Since you made that granola, I'm hooked. How come it's so much better than what's at the store?" :)

Universally loved at my house, from toddler to teen to adult (even an avowed granola-hater!). Only addition/change was to add a cup of coconut, and substituted pecans for walnuts as that's what I had on hand. Everything else was the same and perfect.

I wasn't sure about this at first but everyone in my house enjoyed this granola as did I. Initially it wasn't quite what I had expected (a little nuttier than I had imagined) but turned out great. Will make again since my 3 yr old daughter loved it.

Thought it tasted a little floury with all that flour and milk powder in it, and the resulting chunks just aren't worth it-- it didn't cook up like one would hope. I added dried blueberries, which helped, but this isn't my favorite granola recipe. Oh, well.

All of my granola-loving friends say this is their favorite. I add dried blueberries about five minutes before I turn off the oven, and I let the granola sit in the cooling oven to get really crunchy.

Great easy recipe. My 4 year son helped and we made it for him to take to school for his snack week. 45 minutes was not long enough for a true granola crunch. We added coconut, cinnamon and after cooking added Craisins and yogurt covered raisins. The kids loved it.

Excellent recipie. I made this for Holiday gifts instead of cookies.

My family enjoys this recipe and I regularly serve to overnight guests. For more flavor I double the vanilla and maple extracts, and have substituted soy powder for the dry milk. I prefer to add dried cranberries after baking.

I followed the recipe, except I was out of powdered milk, so I substituted powdered buttermilk. Very crunchy and delicious with a dollop of yogurt on top!

This recipe was pretty good, though I will admit I made a few changes. I substituted dates for the walnuts, and added a sprinkling of cinnamon. I also used only half the oil, and I thought the end result was fine. I was wondering, since the recipe calls for both powdered milk AND water, could you just use regular milk instead? I might try that variation next time since it seems easier. I also might use wheat germ instead of the flour.

Do you like your granola to have big chunks? If so, then this recipe is for you. When you mix together all the ingredients, you will have a thick paste the consistency of raw cookie dough, mainly because of all the flour and milk powder. Other granola recipes I have made from this site (e.g. Almond-Raisin Granola, Chunky Date Coconut and Almond Granola) didn't have those two ingredients. Their "raw batter" had a consistency like that of raw oats or trail mix. After baking for 45 mins, the granola was still very soft, so I continued baking, trying to get it to be cruncht. After 75 mins, I suddenly remembered that the other granola recipes baked up soft but hardened upon cooling! So I immediately took it out... If you like big chunks, don't bother stirring until 2/3 done baking. Then stir minimally and try not to break up the chunks when you do so. Taste-wise, I prefer the two aforementioned recipes over this one, which I found a little flat. It needs more flavor from ingredients like dried fruit, coconut, and/or more nuts.

Excellent! Added 1 cup toasted coconut and 1 cup chopped dried cranberries. The 45 minute cook time isn't long enough for a true granola crunch! Cook longer. I've made several batches for friends and they all ask for the recipe. You must try this one!

My whole family loves this recipe. It keeps for a couple of weeks at least (never lasts longer than that here). The kids eat it for breakfast w/milk or in yogurt, plain at night for a snack, sometimes in a baggie for dessert w/their lunch. We're not big granola people but we really enjoy this one. Cook one hour instead of 45 min.

I made this recipe for my Christmas gift baskets last year and plan on making it again!

Very good. End result is actually something like Quaker 100% Natural Cereal. It took me more like an hour of baking, rather than 45 minutes.

Very tasty granola! The texture was very nice. The only addition I made was adding dried cranberries to the baked granola; their taste and texture complimented the granola nicely.

I've been making granola for years. This was a great recipe, but to make it even better I added some 1/3 c. pumpkin seeds, 1/3 c. sunflower seeds, 1 c. coconut, 1 c. dried raisins, cranberries, apricots, blueberries and cherries. I used wheat germ instead of whole wheat flour.
