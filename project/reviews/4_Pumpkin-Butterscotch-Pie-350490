This is my third year making this recipe and it is now our family's pumpkin pie recipe. Made it completely to the recipe and had no issues whatsoever, though it helps in doing the recipe to go ahead and have all the ingredients at hand. Love it.

Excellent! Loved the butterscotch flavor!

By far a keeper! Elegant texture and phenomenal taste. Second year making it and it's up there with the Brandied Pumpkin Pie I've been making since 1992, maybe even better. Following caramel instructions carefully will yield a perfect result. Cooking it after adding cream to dissolve the "candy" takes a little patience. It will dissolve; never had to strain it. Be sure to use a larger saucepan than you think you need because boiling cream needs room to boil up. For those to whom it is available, no need to mess with the crust--use Trader Joe's all- natural/butter frozen crust. Follow the recipe's instructions for blind-baking and cooling. It's easy and the result is awesome. Hint: Use a Pyrex pie plate sprayed with Pam to ensure best browning and easy removal.

This is the 3rd year in a row I am making this AMAZING PIE! I will admit i was a bit nervous the first year, but I conquered it. My mother hates pumpkin pie, but she happened to be my taster that day. GUESS WHAT!!!?? She loved this pie, it is the only pumpkin pie she will eat.. Last year I baked about 10 of them and gave them to friends and family for a tasty thanksgiving gift. GREAT RECIPE...I am sure this will live on for a long time in my family!

Fabulousespecially with a smoky single-malt Scotch like Laphroaig! It has become a Thanksgiving favorite with family and friends.

I love this pumpkin pie. I am a big butterscotch fan, and I have to disagree with the other reviewers--I could definitely taste the butterscotch flavor. Even if you can't, it still makes a nice light pumpkin pie. One word of warning however--the first time I made it I used Dewer's scotch, and the recipe worked great. Not realizing how much the flavor of the scotch could change the overall flavor of the recipe, this year I used a single malt scotch called Laphroaig because that's what I had in my cabinet at the time. It has a really smoky flavor, which ended up dominating the pie to the point where I couldn't finish my piece. Definitely a big disappointment, but I will make it again next Thanksgiving with a milder scotch. I use a frozen pie crust, because I think pumpkin pies are all about the filling. That saves a lot of time for this recipe.

This was a very tasty pumpkin pie variation. The only reason for the lower rating is that I'm not sold on the extra work the butterscotch takes. I'm not sure it's worth it. Definitely don't work when your caramel seizes up upon adding the scotch. Just follow the directions and heat & strain it. I freaked out the first time and remade the butterscotch think I had done something wrong.

Everyone who ate it, loved this pie. But it was time consuming to make. If there's a faster & easier way to make the butterscotch mixture, it would become a tradition!

The pie was nice and silky and not too sweet. My husband loved it. I didn't have problems with the caramel, however, my crust turned out awful. It didn't matter that much since the pie itself was so delicious but next time I will use another crust recipe.

This pumpkin pie had a sophisticated, complex flavor. Making the caramel wasn't too much trouble - I followed the instructions to a "t" and didn't have the difficulties other reviewers had. Yes, the caramel solidified, but after stirring for some time (over medium-high heat) the texture became perfectly smooth. There wasn't a strong scotch flavor - if that's what you're after, you could increase the amount of scotch. This just tasted like a nicer, slightly more serious (and yes, pleasantly less sweet) pumpkin pie. I would certainly make it again.

I have been making the same boring pumpkin pies for years.I am so glad I tried this recipe. It was outstanding.

I just made this pie for Thanksgiving, thinking it would really wow everyone, including me. What a disappointment!!!! To try and mention only a few points...when the scotch and cream are added to the sugar mixture, the recipe says the mixture will bubble...then mentions to place back on heat until the carmel 'bits' melt. It failed to say, when you add the scotch and cream, the ENTIRE sugar mixture will turn into one huge 'bit' of carmel. At this point I thought I would have to start over, but, eventually, the huge chunk did melt. The end-resulting carmel mixture tasted wonderful and I really thought this was going to be one great pie. I did have to bake it a little longer than stated, but the end result was just an overly- ordinary tasting pie. I am just very glad I was able to borrow some scotch, instead of spending more money on that too...I try to be selective in recipes, but I have to say I would not recommend this one to anyone unless you are looking for an ordinary pie.

I had trouble with this recipe. First, I burnt the sugar mixture. Then, on my second try, when I added the cream, huge chunks of caramel formed, and despite the additional heat and stirring, stayed in chunks. The resulting pie wasn't bad, it was just a little less sweet than it should've been, and the scotch flavor was very weak. Based on the other reviews, I think I need to try this one again.

This is a very elegant and complex take on pumpkin pie. I used half & half instead of whipping cream which was fine, but I think that the whipping cream would have given it a lusher texture. I also used a pre- made pie shell, but I don't think that made much difference. The great thing was that my very traditional pumpkin pie loving husband really liked it and said that I should make it again! Which I'm sure that I will.

Great pie. I tried this because I'm a fan of butterscotch and my husband is a fan of scotch. Doesn't have a strong taste of either, though, just tastes like a really good pumpkin pie. Baked a little longer than recipe called for (10 minutes more) to cook it all the way through.
