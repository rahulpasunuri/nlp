Have made these for the past 17 years. I make them small, under bake them (8 minutes at 325 using a convection oven) and don't roll them in powdered sugar but sift it over them while they're still warm. These are my husband's favorite cookie.

As with some of the others, I first used this in 1994 and it has been part of our Christmas tradition ever since. These balls have been included in many 'thank you' baskets at school, friends, family, hospital and other event. If made right, folk always ask for more!

I've made these cookies for several years and they work best sitting next to other desserts which makes them great to bring to parties. I think they have a nice presentation and are a welcome break from the overly sweet desserts. They are dry so make them small enough to pop the whole thing in your mouth.

These are a nice change to add to a holiday cookie plate. There not too sweet, and delicious with coffee. Roll them while warm, but let them get almost caked in the powd sugar, it makes a nice almost icing on them.

These were pretty good - Mexican Wedding Cakes with a chocolate/coffee flavor. I only had instant coffee - not espresso and I think this gave the taste a disadvantage. Fine - nothing spectacular, but fine.

The reviews sounded so wonderful, but I hated these cookies. I just made these cookies and they were very dry, crumbly, very dull tasting and not sweet at all. If I would make them again I would use melted chocolate instead of powdered and more sugar. I would try rolling the cookies in the powder sugar before baking instead.

These are one of the few cookies I make every Christmas. They taste just like ones my mom used to make. Rich and just sweet enough, and delicious straight out of the freezer!

I make these every Christmas as one of a batch of assorted cookies I give to friends. They always compliment these. They're a bit messy to make, but keep well in the freezer.

I amke this every xmas for my xmas cookie tines that I send out to family and friends, it's impossible to keep my husband out of them and I get so many call backs beging me for more-even my Mr. Gourmet boss. SO I strongly disagree with Lincoln who musn't have done it right. Wait til theyre completely coolled before rolling in sugar and I used dark roast coffee in place of expresso and they were fantastic! (and not dry at all!)

Yummy! I substituted the cocoa with dutch cocoa, which gave them rich flavor. And next time I will wait to roll them in the powdered sugar as another cook suggested. These will become a tradition at my house.

In short, the best cookie recipe in my collection. I've been making this one every Christmas since I first read it in Gourmet back in 1993.

One of my favorite recipes from this site. My extended family often requests these. My sisters and mother now make them too. Always receive rave reviews. Very easy to make and freeze well.

Fabulous! Best results using butter-flavored Crisco rather than butter. Dough is quite dry, but that keeps the balls from flattening when they bake. I also prefer waiting to cover the cookies in powdered sugar after they've cooled completely. These have become a universal favorite with my friends & family.

Very dry and bland. Mine were incredibly dry after refrigerating and, although they held their shape while baking, became fairly brittle when they came out of the oven. The taste, which was too subtle, was not worth the trouble of baking. Also, the powdered sugar turned greasy (and very unappealing) after dipping. Unless you are baking for someone who is easily overpowered by traditional chocolate cookie recipes, don't make these. If you do make them, have liquids (milk, coffee) nearby for dipping.

Really good cookies and very addictive too. I am making them for the third Christmas now. They are my favorite cookies.

Is this recipe missing something? Ie an egg? I tried made this for a company party, the balls came out flat & broke up as soon as I touched them. A real waste of expensive Pecans.

If you are looking for a strong taste of chocolate, this cookies is not for you! It wasn't difficult for me to work with, I just think there are much better cookie recipes. It doesn't have a recognizable taste of anything! Just alot of calories!

Wonderful! The texture is like a heavy meringue cookie with sugar crystals. I like things sweet so I doubled the sugar but many would enjoy it as is. To make it easier to handle after refrigeration, roll into logs before chilling. Then form balls from slices of chilled dough. I tossed half the balls in powdered sugar and half in powdered sugar/cocoa mix for more colorful presentation.

Needed more sugar. DIfficult to mix. After refrigeration too stiff to make into balls which become flat cookies after baking.

My husband absolutely loves these cookies, and he's very hard to please.
