I cubed a loaf of country style bread and put them in the oven for about 15 minutes, dried right up (for those that do not have day old bread). I think this stuffing does well on it's own with other main meats. Leftovers are great as omelette filling also.

Such wonderful flavors! I made this for a Christmas dinner and everyone loved it. I used regular sausage instead of hot because of my family's preference, but it was just delicious. Will definitely repeat this one.

Worth the effort and is great with the Standing Rib Roast

Great recipe! Added 3/4 cup of reserved water AND 1 cup of chicken broth, or else it would've been much too dry. Cooked covered in a glass cooking tray for 30 minutes at 350 degrees. I would recommend uncovering for the last 10 min to crisp the top. (Used stuffing mix from a grocery store package, as I didn't have day-old bread, and it turned out great)
