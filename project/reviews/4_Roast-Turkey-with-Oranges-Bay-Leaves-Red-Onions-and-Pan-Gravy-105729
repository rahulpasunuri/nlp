This has been my go-to recipe for the bird every year since it came out. Nothing makes a better flavor. The brining makes a tender, moist, flavorful bird every time, as do the onions and oranges. It's just a variation on the yellow onion and lemons that I use when I roast a chicken, but it makes turkey taste special to use something different.

Tried this slightly-different-but-not-off-the-deep end variation for our Thanksgiving dinner reprise (turkey x2) this year. The aroma from the oven was just weird, and the citrus and bay did little to flavor the meat overall. Made a nice garnish for the plate. Pan gravy seemed less greasy than typical - perhaps because if was cut with all that orange juice? Hard to say. Would go for a different "different" turkey recipe next time.

Made this for Thanksgiving in 2010 and it was great. . .actually quite simple and the pan juices for the gravy were excellent. A terrific result with not too much work.

My son and I agreed that this turkey was the best we'd ever made. I followed the recipe with no changes. The brining process was easy. I was unsure if I should leave the rind on the oranges, but since there was no direction to remove them, I used the whole orange. I was basting the bird at the 3 hour mark, and my son thought it "looked done". We tested it with an instant read thermometer, and it was! A moist, succulent turkey. Yay!

I made this last year at the suggestion of a family member. It was a huge hit and I'm planning to make it again this year. I have a question: I am allergic to dairy. Can anyone suggest a substitution for the butter used in the recipe?

I have made this turkey 5 years in a row. It is always amazing. It makes the best gravy...when I describe it folks ask me if it is orange-y... it isn't...but is very addictive. There is rarely any left over! The turkey is the most lovely golden color all over and the breast is nice and juicy. Love it!

Decided not to brine the turket and it still came out beautifully. Even the pickiest eaters loved it.

I made this for Thanksgiving, but with a fryer chicken because cooking a turkey scares me. I still trussed it the same and added some orange juice to the pan and it turned out perfectly. I will make this again

I brined the turkey overnight as directed, and followed the recipe exactly, basting about every 15-20 minutes. The turkey was a HUGE hit-- very moist and delicious. Will definitely make again next Thanksgiving!

This is the only turkey recipe I will use! Brined the turkey overnight. Cooked breast side down for 1 hour, flipped and continued roasting. Used half butter and half evoo to baste. I roasted an 18 pound turkey 2 1/2 hours. I'll never stuff another turkey!

BEAUTIFUL turkey! So simple and turned out perfectly! Definitely make it again. We did BRINE the turkey the night before & perhaps that's what made the difference - it was so moist and not dry. Everyone loved it. Yummy leftovers too!

This is the first roast turkey I ever made, and the only one I make to this day! Very delicious and easy. I've never tried the gravy because I don't like gravy, but the meat of the bird is juicy and flavorful. Don't pack the cavity too tight or you'll up your cooking time. The onions that roast in the pan are so sweet and are my favorite part of finishing this recipe.

Wow, I made this recipe last year and was a big hit. I plan on making it this Thanksgiving with the edition of brining the turkey 10 hours before I cook it. That way I can add the Bay leaves in with the brine.

Perfect turkey on my first try!! This was easy and turned out perfectly!! It was my first thanksgiving cooking by myself and this recipe was a hit!! The turkey was soooo moist!

I didn't brine, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The turkey turned out fine, but there was nothing distinctive about it. Somehow I thought with all those oranges and bay leaves the flavor would something spectacular. This is a perfectly good, but safe turkey recipe, with no WOW factor, as they say on American Idol! (wonder if the key is the brining process, as everyone seems to be saying)

Rating: 4
An excellent recipe! I didn't have 2 oranges so used 1 orange and 1 lemon. I also used 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 butter instead of all butter. The results were superb. I am now simmering the carcass, and all the fruit/onion/bay (plus a couple carrots and celery stalks)to make soup stock.

This is the most amazing, flavorful, moist and truly decadent turkey I have ever made! I've now made it three years in a row and everyone who tries it is truly a convert from the usual turkey dinner options. I've even tried different variations by using yellow onions or blood oranges. All turn out magnificent! My toast to the creator of the recipe that has become a staple in my kitchen! Bravo.

This recipe worked great and the flavors were wonderful but the gravy was outstanding! It was so good sometimes we make it for company using a small turkey breast in place of a large turkey. This turkey's flavors are almost "lite" instead of the normal "heavy" Thanksgiving flavors. We can't wait to make it again

OK, this was worth all the work. I brined the turkey for 12 hours in kosher salt, fresh rosemary, thyme & garlic. I baked it breast side down for several hours and then flipped it over for the remaining hours. The result was a tender, moist & juicy golden mound of perfection. Three days later the white meat is still moist for sandwiches. Loved it, just wish the oranges had given it more of a citrus-y flavor. Definitely would make it again.

I am famous in my family for the best Thanksgiving Feast every year, a title that I take very seriously, so much to my chagrin when I made this recipe from my trusted and always reliable epicurious only to have my bird come out so so. Yes I brined with salt,honey,and bay leaves, yes I made home made turkey stock I am not a short cut cook. If there is anyone out there who could please recommend a bird recipe that will knock them out please let me know. As X-mas is around the corner I must, must, must regain my status.

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner and we all raved that this was the best turkey we have ever had. Used a fresh kosher turkey and was amazed at how easy this was to prepare with fantastic results. The gravy was exceptional too. With this recipe, turkey will no longer be reserved for holiday meals.

This has become our Thanksgiving turkey recipe. It is foolproof and the red onions and oranges make for astonishingly good gravy. A 12-16 pound turkey can brine overnight in one of those smallish ice chests with a handle; it keeps it cool and is just the right size. Of course, if you live in the northeast as we do, you can leave it outside for the night instead of making room in the fridge! Make this recipe -- you won't regret it!

GREAT RECIPE! This was our first Thanksgiving as a married couple, and we had many family and friends come to the house. Needless to say I was a tad bit nervous, and I wanted everything to be perfect! The Turkey was a hit! Everyone loved it, and similar to what others have said in their reviews, all guest said that this was the best turkey they've every tasted! And they've already requested the samething for next year! We brinned the Turkey prior to cooking, and we basted the Turkey every 15 min as suggested. End result...very juicy turkey, not dry at all! All together this was a terrific and fun recipe to make and eat! I am sure you and your family will enjoy it!

I made this Turkey this past Thanksgiving. This is the first turkey I ever made. It was simple and everyone loved it. They eat the whole turkey (18lbs). They all wanted the recipe. Will definitely make it again!

The gravy was nothing to get excited about, but the kosher turkey was absolutely fantastic, and I shall use no other turkeys in the future. Thanks to all who warned about the need to remove pin feathers; it took about a half hour with a needle nosed pliers, but the juicy, tender turkey was well worth the plucking. Even the leftovers were better, and by the end of the weekend, the only thing that remained of the big bird was two quarts of stock I had made from the carcass and stashed in the freezer.

I have made this turkey 3 years running and everyone says its the best ever and asks for the recipe. Definitely brine it. I use cheesecloth to baste it and it comes out beautiful. I am still trying to perfect the amount of salt to use in the brine. When I use the recommended amount, the turkey tastes great but the gravy is a tad bit too salty.

We just used this recipie for our first Thanksgiving turkey ~ oh boy was it great. I don't know which was better, smelling the rich citrus/butter/bay leaf scent of roasting turkey or actually eating the delicious meat and gravy. Used an organic turkey but no salting (not on our first try, thankyouverymuch). Turkey did brown a bit fast, so we covered the breast w/foil and added chicken stock when the juices in the pan started to burn. Basted every 15 min as I'm paranoid. All in all a great recipe that you and your family are sure to enjoy.

I made this recipe for Christmas 2002 and I'm back again doing homework to make it again for Thanksgiving. That's because family members are calling to make sure I cook the turkey "just like the last one". The kids are even asking for it. All said it was the best they'd ever had by far and I agree. I did a lot of research since I had just started cooking (50 year old male) and if you're looking as I was, look no further. I have no great tips except to highly recommend the brining process. It's worth sacrificing fridge space even if you have to use cooler kits and ice for a couple of days.

I used this recipe with just a regular ol' turkey and it was incredible. Early on I thought it would burn because of the high temperature to start, but I was soooo wrong. I think this makes quite possibly the most beautiful turkey ever. The onions and oranges are delicious-like candy. My suggestion-add more oranges and onions to the pan for everyone to enjoy and increase the amount of butter used for basting.

I always try to make a different turkey, but I always brine it. I loved the oranges with the turkey and this recipe was both easy and delicious. The gravy (drippings) were fantastic.

This was my first try at a Thanksgiving day turkey at my house. I thought it was great. Even my dad confirmed this with an e-mail message the next day that said, "This was the best turkey I have ever had! Don't tell your mom." I was able to use the crisper drawer itself in place of the bucket for the brining process. However, make sure your drawer can handle the weight of the turkey and the water. It is heavy.

This is far and away the best turkey I've ever eaten. I brined a 13 lb. bird in the frig in a small bucket. Took out the vegetable drawer and made room. The turkey was moist and browned beautifully. The gravy was excellent. Loved the flavor given by oranges, and onions. Will make this again for our big Thanksgiving, but will probably use a Kosher turkey since I'll need a bigger bird. Really good!

I used this recipe this year for Thanksgiving. It was my first try at a turkey and the results were awesome. Brining the turkey is a must. The results were a very tasty and succulent turkey.

delicious! I made a few changes that may have made it easier with very good results. 1st, i rubbed the bird with cut side of cut garlic. Then I rubbed a mixture of Kosher salt, blk pepper and a pinch of cayenne all over skin. I also substituted fresh rosemary for bay leaves. Also, used a little less butter. Oh, also used water instead of turkey stock in gravy. Lots of little changes but same basic idea.

This Turkey was by far the best turkey (and the easiest) that I have ever made. The brinning was so easy and made such an incredible difference. The Oranges, Bay Leafs and Onions were a perfect combination inside the bird. My guests and my family loved it. I will make it again for sure!!!

YUMMY! Made this for a New Years Day Party and the guests loved it! This was the second turkey I brined and I swear by it. The turkey stayed moist all evening, and I am sure the left overs will be great too! If you want a perfect bird you have to give this one a try.

I am not a professional in the kitchen and this year was my first to cook a turkey. I brined a 12 pound turkey in a small cooler overnight. It was extremely easy to do and the turkey was fantastic. Everyone raved about how moist and tender it was. Don't let the comments about brining in this recipe keep you from doing it yourself. I also started the turkey roasting breast down, turning every 20 minutes and finishing by turning the breast up for the last part of the roasting process.

I have never made a turkey before so I followed the whole recipe, making the stock and the gravy. I did not want to brine so I used a kosher turkey like they recommended. It was delicious! All of my guests raved that the turkey was very juicy.
