Had this on a snowy night with friends. Super easy, fast and great for company. I added a little tomato paste and grainy mustand along with a few spices and some pepper to the broth after I added the clam juice.

This was a good stew, but could have been a great stew if the broth was enhanced. I haven't figured out what it needs yet. It was a bit thin and needed a flavor boost. Spanish vinegar? Some tomato paste? It may be that it is just not possible to get a great broth cooking so quickly and by using only wine and clam juice. Any ideas? I would like to give it another try?

quick and easy one-pot meal, good for weekday dinner or a special occasion. I left out the olives because I don't care for them, but otherwise prepared the recipe as is. Served with crusty bread and a crisp white wine. I'll definitely make this again.

A beautiful dish for the eyes and taste buds. The chorizo to be found round hereabouts isn't very spicy, so I kicked the dish up with dried chili flakes. Yum!

I don't understand why people liked this dish. The broth was thin, the flavors didn't meld, and the dish didn't come together at all. I made it exactly as written.

This stew was very easy and wonderfully tasty. This is a dish to rely on when making dinner for friends. Chorizo where I buy it comes raw, so I broiled before chopping and adding into pot. I did everything else as written, and it was finger-licking delicious!

I love this. The loads of vegies were a real treat. I've not cooked with this kind of sausage before - it adds a really nice flavour.

Fabulous recipe. I make this often for my portuguese relatives and they rave about it. Woudn't change a thing about the recipe.

This dish is quick - after the veggies have been chopped. The chorizo adds great flavor! I cut the recipe in half to serve two.

This was delicious, chorizo is my new favorite ingredient for everything! I substituted frozen scallops and shrimp for the shellfish, it came out very flavorful and the leftovers were delicious. It was surprisingly quick and easy to make too, after cutting the veggies into matchsticks. I will certainly make it again.
