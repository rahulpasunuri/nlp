I understand Frico is traditionally served in Venice to celebrate the Feast of St. Lucy. Can't wait to try these.

After reading most of the reviews, I was a little skeptical about making these, but forged ahead anyway. They turned out GREAT! My niece & I made them last weekend; and we couldn't stop eating them. They were not too floury at all. After baking I did place them on paper towels to absorb some of the grease. I will be making these again & again

OMG,so delish. I didnt have parchment so used non stick foil, perfect. Cant wait to serve them with a Caesar salad, until them I am just eating them off the pan, with a glass of cab, yummy!

Omitted flour after comparing several similar recipes. Line cookie sheet with parchment, and use any kind of cheese and spice/herb combo that sounds yummy -- it will be! These are awesome!

I recently had this on a cruise ship--big frico formed into cereal bowl-sized cups served with fettucini Alfredo. Awesome!

This was a new idea for me, served with the spinach and parmesan custard. I liked the frico part a lot better than the custard part:-) And I like the suggestion of filling them .

I first made this recipe for my sister's bridal shower and everyone loved it. Since then I've made it at her baby shower, her son's first birthday, my brother's engagement party, and many other family gatherings. Everytime it's always the first thing to go. This really is a great recipe and I've tried it with asiago cheese.

I keep Parmesan crisps of all varieties on hand...great for when unexpected guests pop over. I either form the crisps into frico cups (push the warm crisps into a mini muffin tin) and fill them or, while warm, I wrap them around a wooden dowel to form a curl. Both of these can be quickly piped with cheese, filled with tapenade, etc etc. I, like another reviewer, don't use flour (makes the crisps too doughy) and just use really good parmesan and make them in a hot fry pan on the range.

This was a fun recipe to make--one of those that doesn't sound like it's going to work, but does. Nice accompaniment to the spinach parmesean custard.

Frico is wonderful, however in real Italian cooking you don't use flour---just spread an even amount of cheese (you can use most any type of firm cheese)in a non-stick fry pan and SLOWLY fry the grease and liquid out of the cheese. It will melt down and turn crispy. It takes patience, but oh man, is it good!

I tried this three times, adjusting the temperature of the oven and the flour/cheese ratio. Every time I ended up with a brown "lump" of grated cheese with bits of flour floating around it. The "crisps" looked exactly as they did before they went into the oven, only golden instead of white.

I have not tried this recipe as of yet. However, as a "chef" myself, I find this to be a great idea as a garniture for a pasta dish or rustic Italian soup. I will defianately be trying this one soon!
