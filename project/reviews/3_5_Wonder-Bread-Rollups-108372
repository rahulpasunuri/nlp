one more thing. Wine pairings for this recipe? Seriously? It should be PBR or Natty Light. Cmon!

Easy and delicious. Great for a white trash theme party. You can even do them inside out with the bacon on the inside of the pinwheel if you like the bread to be crustier. Make sure you slice the bacon to the length of the bread "thirds." You end up with too much bacon if you follow the directions and just randomly slice the bacon slab in half.

The biggest problem with this fun retro recipe as written is the swiss cheese: after the called-for 30 minutes bake, it's in a puddle around the bottom of each appetizer. It hardens and looks terrible. My solution is to leave the swiss cheese out and substitute cheddar soup for the golden mushroom. You get the cheese flavor without the mess of the cheese, and you don't really miss the mushroom soup flavor.

I too was almost embarassed to make these. White bread, bacon, soup and cheese? Who'd have thought that they would be one of the best hits at my party. And I made several other wonderful canapes and hor's doevures from Epicurious (chicken satay rolls, shrimp rolls etc). Everyone loved these and I have been asked to make them again. Try These! But be SURE to use thin sliced bacon or else too greasy.

Weirdness of the recipe aside.... Wonder Bread roll-ups made with Arnold bread?

The bacon & mushroom soup mix simulates the flavor of a swiss cheese pastry (but much less expensive). These do tend to be a just bit greasy. The bacon fat to blame, however it does get absorbed by the bread, which produces a nice crispy outerlayer. These are fabulous for showers and quick party starters (the men at our party especially seemed to like them). Try adding a bit of thinly sliced onion and tomato to the mix! Yum!

I'm so thankful that I decided to attempt this well before my party. Awful, greasy and fat laden. The texture and flavors are frightening.

I made these as sort of a joke, and as I was rolling them up was thinking they were pretty disgusting, but, no lie, THEY WERE GREAT, and all gone in less than 5 minutes. Really, try this recipe but double it.
