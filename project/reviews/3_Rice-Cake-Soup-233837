This recipe is in its full bells and whistles for company or special events. I grew up eating it boiled in plain water and seasoned with nothing but a generous amount of black pepper. It's very zen and it showcases the subtle flavor AND texture, It's somewhat challenging to get the window of time to cook the rice noodles so that the texture comes out al dente chewy but not hard. Overcooked it becomes slimy.

Who the heck would make this recipe as it is written? it's a bit overly fussy for a homey dish. I like substituting dried anchovies instead of beef stock..that's a bit more traditional. the boolgogi is nice but not necessary. gim is also a nice frill, but you can substitute with furukake, if you have it handy. This dish needs kimchi as a side when it's served, by the way. Otherwise, it's like dancing the tango wtih yourself.
