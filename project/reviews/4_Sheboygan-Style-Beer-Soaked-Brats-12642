Made a huge amount of these for an Oktoberfest Party. Followed others advice and grilled first then put in the beer mixture. Served the brats with the onions from the mixture. There was not a single one left!! Great flavor and putting them in the beer after grilling made them extremely tender.

best brats ever. I actually used a very dark beer, a Chocolate Belgian Ale.

This was very good, far better than the last time I made beer brats. Very easy and very flavorful. It might have something to do with the different brats I bought, but I think the ketchup and mustard added a lot of flavor as well. I only made 5 brats, so I just used the onions that were cooked in the beer and grilled some peppers. This is a keeper.

Who cares about authenticity when the recipe is really good? Tonight I did two rings of smoked sausage this way, with three bottles of Leinie's Red, a large sliced onion, a generous squirt of ketchup and a more generous squirt of good old French's yellow mustard. Crisped the sausages up on the grill afterward and served them with baked beans and homemade cole slaw alongside. OMG. My husband claims that the sausage tasted just like the "landjaeger" served at Veigel's Kaiserhoff in New Ulm, MN.

The key is to boil the brats BEFORE and AFTER grilling. Doesn't matter if they are bob evans, johnsville, chichi butcher down the road. . . the moisure in the beer (go ahead and use expensive, but PBR or Miller Lite works great). Don't forget the green peppers!! A heart attack waiting to happen!

Don't do what I did! I followed the recipe with the exception of the type of bratwursts. I bought turkey bratwursts from the Whole Foods meat counter, thinking that surely they would be good. Well, the texture was dry and the flavor was bland. Next time I'll try a different brat. I'll try again because I think the recipe could be fabulous.

I followed THIS recipe, (as written above) but I cooked the brats & beer mixture in the crockpot for a few hours with a package of sauerkraut. Grilled the brats afterward & served atop the kraut. YUM!

I followed ellen's version. They turned out really good. We just served them with the onions from the soak and spicey mustard. Very authentic

use the cooks comments and grilled the brats and onions first. .made this in winter so used my trusty George Forman grill. Worked great. Did not serve on bread.. just with some noodles as a side dish. My spouse does not like brats and she enjoyed the dish.

This was great!!! I followed the recipe but took Jackie advise and grilled the brats first. my husband is raving about the dinner the day after!

I followed the recommendation of grilling first, followed by simmering in beer, and it turned out perfectly! I didn't follow the recipe here, just mixed beer, sliced onion and a dab of butter, and simmered for about 40 minutes. Such great flavor!! Thanks for the tip!

There is no other way to make brats. I agree with the native 'Sheboyganite'. Soak them in the beer and onions after grilling. And a good horseradish mustard works well. Another grilling tip - NEVER use a fork or anything that might puncture the skin to turn the brats.

Jackie Choy is right, it is best to reverse the order of cooking. Over the 4TH of July I grilled brats like this: make a foil "boat" by double folding aluminum foil and crimping the corners. slice an onion and add with olive oil to "boat",place on grill, grill brats(I always buy pre-cooked, and think Usingers are best & Johnsonville are OK too)place brats in "boat" add beer and let simmer for at least 10 minutes. add more beer if it cooks off too fast. manga!

As a native "sheboyganite" I was surprised to find this recipe. As we grew up, however, we reversed the order of the cooking of the brats. You can also cook the bratwurst on the grill first and then allow the brats to simmer in the pot of stewed onions and beer for an hour before serving. It makes preparation for a group a lot easier.

Good question, Louisville, and one I can't readily answer. It's not as if the delicate flavor of the bratwurst is going to be overwhelmed by a little malt and hops. I can't wait until grilling season so I can make this again. And, since it's my impression that once you post a second review, your first one goes away, let me reiterate: my family loved this, my German SO said I should never cook brats any other way, and next time I make this I want to try it with at least a dark lager, such as an amber bock.

Question. I've noticed many recipes using beer specifically say "not dark beer" but it seems to me that dark - ales or lagers - would give such great flavor. Any ideas?

I made this recipe the day before our party and used an Pete's Wicked Oktoberfest ale. To me, the mustard makes all the difference in the flavor, so use a quality brand. I let the sausages sit in the beer broth overnight. Scrumptious.

As an American of German heritage, a Brat and a Beer is soul food. This recipe was great, use a good German beer such as Spaten Munich. The hard rolls are nice. This recipe will go in to my Wurst recipe box.

Terrific do ahead recipe. I simmered the brats in the morning (being a beer geek I used a dark german alt beer from a local brewpub) then left brats in liquid in fridge till we were ready to grill. Very simple and very moist

Easy and delicious recipe. I used dark beer and was quite pleased. I also added sauted green and red peppers in a little bit of red wine vinegar cooked seperatly and added it to the sandwich. That made a wonderful addition. Served with fruited sauerkraut.

This was a fun recipe, the beer (I definitely suggest DARK, as they suggested light.. not enough flavor)made these babies extra good. Serve at a picnic with a good beer.

A formidable recipe, but try using a dark or a more hearty beer than your typical Miller Beer. (No slef respecting brat lover would cook brats in Budweiser). If you use a nut brown ale, your brats will have a more "pronounced" beer flavor. If you don't want to waste any of your good beer on the brats, use malt liquor like Colt 45. Also, if you boil the brats the night before your cookout and marinade them in beer overnight you will have even better results.

Absolutely spec! We cut the receipt in half but only used one 12oz bottle of beer, it worked fine.
