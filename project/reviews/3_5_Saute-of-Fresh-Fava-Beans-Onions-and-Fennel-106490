This was very enjoyable! I haven't cooked much with fresh fennel before (I know, what was I thinking?) so this was a bit of an experiment for my culinary skills. I swapped the pancetta for prosciutto just to be a little healthier and unfortunately could get either fresh or frozen beans so I was left with canned, but it worked just fine and cut the cooking time down considerably. Big hit with my hubby, not so much with my picky teen eater. I will definitely make again and look forward to using all fresh ingredients.

A bit too heavy of a treatment for the spring-green beauty of Fava beans. The fennel got pretty mushy after all that cooking which was a thumbs down for texture and the pancetta obscured the brightness of the favas. I was surprised to hear my boyfriend, who is a huge fan of pork, say it was "too meaty".

This dish is very tasty and simple if you use frozen lima beans. I made the recipe as described but crisped the pancetta ahead of time and reduced the oil as suggested. The dish was predominately lima beans, which was fine but Im a huge fennel fan, so next time Ill double the onion, fennel and lemon juice to bring out the flavors that drew me to this recipe in the first place. I made this for a foodie friend and served it with lemon marinated BBQ chicken and sautéed kale. It was delicious!

all that work for the favas, and the pancetta stole the show...

This was my first attempt at making fava beans. I blanched a 2 lb bag of Goya fava's and shelled.Let sit overnight in the refrigerator. The 2 lb bag yielded about 4 cups of shelled beans. I only used half with this recipe considering I was cooking for 2 adults and 2 children. Left out the Fennel, not a fan. Included a 1/2 C of a nice winter white from a local winery. Substituted pancetta with 2 slices of Smoked Organic Turkey Bacon. Last, I cut down the olive oil and added three tablespoons of salted butter. Added some white pepper for a little kick. Overall the slight variation gave the sauce a richer flavor. Served it with a tenderloin roast medium rare and whole wheat penne. Absolutely deliciious! Kids loved it!

Lovely side dish and combination. I did not have the fennel seed, fresh dill or savory on hand and instead used fresh mint. Fava beans and mint work great together! I too crisped the pancetta prior to adding the fava beans, which worked out great. Do not cook the fava beans as long as the recipe states - they will be mushy. These tender beans require very little cooking time. After blanching the beans for 2 minutes once they have been removed from their pods - refresh in cold water and remove their outer shell. The beans only then need to be cooked another few minutes which is done when they are added to the onion/pancetta mixture. Next time I will be sure to have fennel seeds/fresh dill on hand.

I used this recipe as a vague outline for a recipe and I love the combination of flavors. I used vidalia onion and after cooking it with the fennel, I added some thinly sliced apples, wild peas, and instead of beans, brown rice that was well, al dente. Also, fenugreek works as an addition to the spices. I wish I had pancetta in the refrigerator!

Used frozen baby lima beans and did not boil them. I sauteed the pancetta first then followed the recipe expect I used about 50% of the oil. It was an interesting dish and I would make it again.

Simple and tasty if you use frozen favas (sometimes avail at Whole Foods!) or limas instead of unshelled fresh. I subbed garlic chicken sausage for the pancetta (hazard of using only what you have on hand!) and dried instead of fresh dill, but followed the recipe otherwise. Would make it again.

Served this last night to 2 Greek people, two other friends, and to my husband who hates lima beans. Everyone raved and everyone had seconds. I sauteed the pancetta as recommended. This is an interesting and delicious side dish. It was a perfect complement to the roasted lamb and eggplant/tomato dish I prepared.

WOW! This is so good. I used frozen baby lima beans and was short some herbs. I placed the fennel and beans on a bed of fresh baby spinach, topped with butter- garlic shrimp and finished with pepper bacon. Even my 6 year old was devouring it! Also had some crusty garlic butter bread to soak up the broth - so good!

My CSA delivery was spring onions, leeks, fennel and fresh favas! A simple fresh combination that has flexibility. I used both leeks and spring onions.

This recipe was perfect for using ingredients I bought at the farmer's market. I used local country bacon instead of pancetta and served it with a big romaine salad. my friends loved it.

Very good combination. I just love fava beans! Will put this on the list of favorites.

I significantly substituted for things in this recipe and it is still fabulous. I didn't have fava or lima beans, so I substituted chickpeas. I used oregano for savory and omitted the dill. It was still great! I can't wait to try the real recipe!

Can't seem to ever find fresh fava beans, so we use frozen baby lima bean and it's still wonderful.

Excellent flavors! We love fava beans and I think they are worth the effort. As with many cooks, I changed this a bit and waited to near the end to add the fava beans for a second "cooking" for just a few minutes. we like them ala dente'. Do try this recipe.

This is truly an elegant dish. The ease of making the dish belies the rewardingly rich and complex flavors it provides. I did follow A Cook's approach to saute the pancetta first and hopefully make better use of its flavors. Now I'm counting down the hours to lunch so I can warm up the leftovers!

The dish was delicious -- very flavorful and interesting. It has so much flavor that it's probably best paired with simple grilled fish or similar. I would definitely make again but try to improve the presentation. The fava beans were cooked after the initial 2 mins and turned to mush in the subsequent cooking. Also, sliced endives leave large rings. Next time, I would cut the endive into much smaller pieces and add the fava beans later. But based on taste/interest alone, the recipe merits 4 stars.

An absolutely suberb and imaginative dish. I made it exactly as written and served it with a Greek meal - the 3 cheese phyllo triangles, cucumber yogurt dip, and orzo tomato feta salad, all from this site. There were no fava beans available and I used the suggested frozen baby lima beans instead. It was delicious.

Fantastic! An interesting blend of flavors. Sure the fava beans are a bit of hassle, but they're definitely worth it. I used fresh fava beans, so I skipped the initial step (boiling them in water for 2 mins.). I also sauteed the pancetta first, then added the onion and fennel, etc., so they could soak up the pancetta fat.

In Australia it is hard to get fresh fava beans but the frozen ones are excellent. Worth every minute of effort! My family always request this dish.

Fava beans are work-intensive, but worth it. I think this would be less interesting with limas. I left out the pancetta and there was plenty of flavor anyhow. I didn't have dried savory, nor did Whole Foods (what is it anyhow?) so I used oregano. Took this to a potluck and everyone enjoyed it.

Seeing fresh favas in the market I jumped on them, but what to do? I think this dish plays both the favas and the fennel to their best. A very good mix of flavors; cant go wrong with a bit of Pancetta! I served this with Grouper baked with S/P, garlic. lime juice/zest, and capers. Also I served a nice Chianti. Fava beans and a nice Chianti (insert Hannibal Lechter slurping sounds here)!! Worth the effort.

I actually didn't make this recipe, it was part of a menu at a dinner party I attended. It was incredible that I had to ask for the recipe! While I heard the process was time consuming, the dish was WELL worth it, from my perspective. Next time I won't make the same 'boring' vegetables for dinner. It was GREAT!

I learned with this dish that making a fava bean dish is a rather laborious process! However, the results certainly justify the effort. I brought this dish (along with grilled artichokes) to a Tuscan dinner party. The fava beans were the favorite! Next time we have a special occasion, this recipe will definitely come out again.
