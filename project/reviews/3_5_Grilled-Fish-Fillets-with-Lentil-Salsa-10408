Ok, help me out -- what did I do wrong? I have such success with Epicurious recipes and have had such good guidance from the user reviews -- I made the lentil salsa recipe exactly as written and it was a HUGE disappointment -- just so blah. I couldn't believe how not very good it was and tried to revive it with a shot of Garlic Expressions and Borsari seasoned salt, but it didn't help. And now I seem to have about 42 pounds (kidding) of a lentil/onion/pepper/tomato mixture that wasn't that great to start with so how can I save it and use it up? Who need more salsa than main dish anyway? This was my worst epicurious experience ever -- and I've been using this site for years and years. I cannot believe anyone raved about this and scarfed the salsa up with a spoon -- I am facing days of penance eating this horrible leftover because I can't bear to waste this much food.

I have made this several times and it's always a winner. I prefer the fish sauteed without the flour, but the lentil salsa is perfect as is. Highly recommended.

Very, very good--with a few additions: we used catfish, dusted with a blend of finely ground cornmeal and regular flour. Substituted red pepper for green and, since we were also having fresh corn cut off the ear, added this to the salsa. The weather didn't cooperate, so we did the fish in a pan on the stove. It was delicious, and we look forward to grilling the fish next time.

STUPENDOUS salsa - lentils give it an unusual meatiness and depth. Served with chicken breasts prepared as indicated - had to brush liberally with olive oil during the grilling process to get rid of that dusty- dry look. Beautiful presentation, great flavor.

3 1/2 forks. I made it with red snapper. Grilling on a real grill would have been better than the ridged pan that I used. (shoot me, it was raining) Chop the vegetables as finely as you can, especially the peppers. Jalapenos sound like a decent addition to the salsa. Sorry, but feta cheese and cucumber don't sound like something I would recommend. We had it with the broccoli and parsnip soup, which was a decent match.

This recipe is terrific...with a few adjustments! First time I followed it exactly...but there was something missing. I made this again and added cukes and feta cheese to the salsa. Pow! It really punched it up. Got rave reviews from friends when I took it to a BBQ. This gets better as it chills and also, the lentil salsa with feta makes a nice dish all on its own.

We loved this recipe - the salsa is terrific - I was eating it out of the bowl after dinner as a snack!

Easy and wonderful! I spiced it up with roasted jalapenos and doubled it so I would have extras, great with ceviche, grilled chicken or just tortilla chips! Even had it with a quesadilla! Really heathly too! Can't wait for the summer tomatoes to really give it some extra zing!

This is ugly, but good and refreshing. The salsa makes the dish. I cut the pepper and the tomatoes into large dices and I served the salsa as a salad. It would make a good summer salad. I agree with the previous review, this is a good way to introduce lentil in ones diet.

This salsa worked well with the fish, but is SOOO good that I could have eaten the whole bowl as a sort of tomato salad. I did add a jalepeno to give it a little heat. Great way to sneak lentils into your diet.

The lentil salsa is delicious. I used shallots instead of onion and served it with plain broiled salmon. I think this salsa would be great with almost anything.

Awesome recipe and very easy to make. I use any kind of fish that can be grilled (cod, snapper, halibut) and as an added zip, chopped up some fresh thai chilis or other chili's into the salsa. It gives it a real zip (if you have kids, save a little of the salsa in an extra bowl before you put the chilis in. Very good. highly recommended.

Simple, excellent dish. Exchanged red bell pepper for green. Was concerned about flouring filets b/4 placing on grill - worked perfect & fish was quite moist.

Fabulous recipe! It also works wonderfully with boneless chicken breasts. Rub chicken breasts with crushed cloves of garlic and half a lemon, dust with salt, pepper, paprika, and cumin, and grill in an oiled, ridged pan. Serve as you would the fish.

Fantastic recipe! I've made it a few times now - I don't get stressed on salsa quantities (and make it the day before)- Just throw it whatever amounts you have at this time. And I put the salsa on top of the fish because its so colourful and hides the fish if it had fallen apart a bit. Also a little chilli oil in the salsa mix gives it a bit of spice and I marinade the fish in a bit of garlic, lemon juice and salt and pepper to start. I serve the fish and salsa on the plate itself and put a simple rocket salad and roasted rosemary and garlic potatoes on the table to share. Delicious, inexpensive to make, very low in fat and everyone wants the recipe!

I used fresh caught walleye fillets and this recipe was very good. Any of you fisherman out there should try it with any firm white fleshed fish.
