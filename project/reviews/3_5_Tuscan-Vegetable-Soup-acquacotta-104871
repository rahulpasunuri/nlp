I was so excited to find this recipe, as one of my favorite restaurants makes a wonderful version of this. But reading the recipe made me think it might be blander than what I was used to. I used both kale and the mushrooms together, and used beef broth instead of water. I added a bit of super-concentrated tomato paste and used red pepper flakes instead of the hot pepper. Delicious!!

This is FABULOUS! What's even nicer is there are choices -- no swiss chard, use porcini mushrooms, to name one. It is easy to make, very filling and extremely tasty. This also can be a low calorie dinner by slightly adjusting the evoo, bread and cheese. Really GREAT!

I am hooked on this rustic style due to Lidia Bastianich and decided to try this recipe. I was worried that it would take all afternoon, not even close, it hardly took any time. I did add a little more time to the preparation because I wanted a richer broth, so I took a portion of it and blended it down and added it back to the soup. This is my new comfort food.

Was happily surprised just how easy and good this recipe was! I added regular button mushrooms and just added the parsley near the end. This is a keeper!

My husband liked this soup a lot! It's pretty healthy and satisfying. I used a regular red bell pepper and added pepper to make a bit hot, since I didn't have any hot red pepper. I forgot to put the cheese at the end, and it still tasted really good. The egg with the runny yolk gives it a really rustic flavor. Next time I´ll make sure to add the cheese because it will be even better!

Both versions of this recipe (chard and dried mushrooms) are much better than you can imagine a stockless soup could be. (Sometimes I do use half vegetable broth; and usually I add a bit of tomato paste or sauce, but even without the flavor is excellent and subtle.) We usually eat this without the egg, using only croutons we have made from a good baguette (1 inch thick slices dredged in good olive oil and baked on foil on a cookie sheet at about 325 until toasted, then rubbed with a garlic clove).

This a wonderful healthy delicious dish. I am a great fan of Faith W. (her Red, White and Greens is one of my absolutely favorite cookbooks). Make sure to use organic eggs, so you needn't overcook them. In fact, underpoach and they finish firming up in the soup liquid. I used thick sliced ciabatta bread sauteed in a little first rate olive oil. Oh, and I did add 2 garlic cloves.

I really enjoyed this simple recipe. It's perfect for a cold winter night during the week. It is healthy and it warms the soul since it tastes like a Tuscan farmhouse meal.
