I used to teach Mexican cooking and absolutely love any and all Mexican food. When I made this, the sauce was a little flat!! I ended up adding some pureed fresh tomato and to deepen the flavor of the sauce, I added a tablespoon of cocoa. The cocoa really improved the depth of the flavor and the fresh tomato added some zip!!

I forgot the oregano and added a few handfulls of toasted pumpkin seeds to blender. Served with rice, beans, and a dollop of sourcream. Awesome! Tasted like home (South Texas). Work intensive but worth it.

I used 3lb pork shoulder so the 6C water was just about right except that it did take longer to boil off than suggested. Additionally, I cannot imagine using the 12-20 chiles suggested - I used 3 and ended up with a very flavorful but not hot dish. I also used about 2.5 lb tomatillos and just enough water to cover. Added a little brown sugar to balance the acidity of the tomatillos as well. We served this with corn tortillas and a cabbage slaw seasoned with lime and chile powder - a great contrast to the richness of the pork.

This was fantastic. I used the pork with tortillas and guacamole., etc. I did add more water and garlic like the other reviewers. Otherwise receipe was prepared as is. Have made many times. Great for leftovers.

Thanks to the previous reviews regarding the water. I used a 4lb. bone-in pork shoulder. Trimmed and reserved the bone to cook with the meat. I used 3 cups of water. More garlic. After 2 hours I took the meat out and reduced the liquid. I will use less water next time. Put pork back in pot to brown. Also, took the advice on the liquid for the sauce and used less. Fabulous taste and very easy.

It's true that the 6 cups of water to cook the pork was too much (at least for a slow simmer). But no big deal: just pour out extra water . . . or use a little less. Just make sure that pork is fork tender and then do cook it up w/out water in the fat. I also strained the sauce (got ride of chile pieces and tomatillo seeds that way). It was a delicious and easy dish.

Joined the site just to write this. The six cups of water is insane - I cooked the pork for two hours and only maybe a cup and a half had evaporated. Figured I wasn't cooking it hot enough so I left it in for another fifteen minutes, and by that point the pork was insanely moist. Adding two cups of water to the tomatillos is even more insane. I added no additional water other than what came over inside the tomatillos and the sauce came out with a good texture. Too bad it didn't taste good! The amount of effort it takes to deal with the chilis isn't remotely close to worth it, nevermind the fact that you've gotta wash a blender and three pans after making this. If the recipe had been written correctly I still would have hated it, given the taste/time/effort/cleanup ratios. Probably the worst recipe I've ever tried.

Very much enjoyed making this new (for me) recipe. The ingredients were readily availble at my local grocery store as well. I bought a 2.35 pound boneless pork shoulder roast and felt, after trimming and cooking down, that I would use more pork as it seems I had more sauce than pork. I watched the added liquid to the blender step and wound up only using about 1 cup. As a bonus, for my taste, I added a 1/2 Tablespoon brown sugar as well to the finished sauce. YUMMY!!!!!!!

Love this one. I've made it 8 or 10 times since I discovered it. Very authentic and very tasty. Always a hit. The brightness of the guajillos and tomatillos works extremely well with the well cooked pork.

LOVED THIS! It went right into my permanent file. It is a little bit of piddling around, but well worth it. We liked it better the second day, and after refrigerating, the excess fat can easily be removed. A quick word about the tomatillos -- use the small ones. The large ones can be quite bitter.

Good but not great. The recipe called for too much tomatillo water. I used just under 2 cups, and next time I will cut it down to one and puree in the food processor instead. The flavor of the simple sauce was memorable, and I will use that again for other dished, probably with a few hotter chiles included. Also, I chose to drain the fat out of the pot after browning the meat which I feel was a good move. There was so much fat! Served with the recommended corns tortillas black beans. Pared well with a Wiedenmayer Jersey Lager, a Marzen-syle (Oktoberfest) beer.

This recipe is is like a Mexican-flavored version of North Carolina pulled pork barbecue. I made it as taco stuffing once (a big hit) and plan to serve it in barbecue sandwiches next time - one toasted buns with cilantro aioli and red onion. The water took forever to cook off, so once the meat was flaky-shredded I just strained off the porky water and froze it for later use as a stock for Vietnamese noodle soup or to soak black eyed peas.

Water fully boiled off in 1hr 45min. Meat was falling-apart tender at that time. Maybe I used less water or simmered a bit harder? Pretty much made this exactly as given here. I love guaijillo chiles for their bright clean flavor which went very well with the tomatillos. Very nice, easy recipe. Will definitely add to my repertoire.

agree with the previous comment; it took longer than two hours to boil-off the water. tomatillos were not in season when i made this, so i substituted and made a chile colorado with tomatoes, garlic and chile japones (red peppers) instead. worked well though it makes the dish much more spicy.

This was a great technique for cooking pork, though it took lots longer than 2 hours to boil off water. I suggest using less water, though you'll want to cook for at least 2 hours so meat gets tender. I used only 3 oz of peppers for 2.7 # meat (w/ bone -- boiled and meat eventually separated.
