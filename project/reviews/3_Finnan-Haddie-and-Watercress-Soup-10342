It was just bland. Too bad because I had high expectations.

A very good soup and easy to prepare. Not sure what it has to do with St. Patrick - finnan haddock is best known as Scottish.

We loved this soup and so did our friends one St. Patrick's Day a few years back. The finan haddie we bought was frozen and not very flavorful. So we substituted a domestic smoked whitefish and it was delicious! We are making it again this St. Paddy's.

An easily prepared soup. Makes a wonderful entry into a S Pat's dinner. I'm using it again this year.
