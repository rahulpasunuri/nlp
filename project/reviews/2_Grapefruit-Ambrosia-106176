I used 3 grapefruit and 3 oranges. Substitued triple sec for the campari. Added bananas and used chopped pecans. It was delicious. Made it for an Easter brunch. Everyone loved it!

the real art of ambrosia is the sectional seqwuence of the types of fruits that you use so, to use fruit such as grapefruit rather it be pink or red it should be used in a sectional state to enrich the other flavors of the salad. als, you may want to think of using shedded carrots to give the ambrosia body to gather it's flavor with the fruit. including the carrot also, gives the succulant exposer of the true ambrosia taste.
