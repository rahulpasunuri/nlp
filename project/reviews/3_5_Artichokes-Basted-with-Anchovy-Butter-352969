Wonderful recipe. However, I never use canola oil and I used an entire head of garlic. Use good olive oil and mince the garlic if you don't have the fancy microplane grater. A recipe is a starting point, then you go where you want with it. I would not eat an anchovy, yet they are fantastic in a sauce.

I hate to be the sole dissenter, but these were a tremendous disappointment after all the fanfare. Seemed like a waste of good artichokes.

My wife, who is typically a brave eating partner, said I should find another recipe after I presented this recipe to her. I persisted and boy am I glad I did. This artichoke was the best artichoke either one of us has ever had. We were trying to recreate one of our favorite meals (Hitching Post in Bulleton, CA) and the artichoke stole the show (over a filet mignon). I look forward to serving this at a dinner party.

These are "killer" good! The weather was bad outside, so did this all in the oven. Okay, so no grill marks, but these were exceptional just the same! It's a little more work using the fresh artichokes, but well worth the time and effort!

First time I made this with canned artichokes and felt I had committed a crime. Second time, I engaged some love and laboured fresh. Totally understand this being a 'food group' in tetoncook's family. Anchovy butter is addictive and terrific as read, but especially mashed with fine green onion, finely grated lemon rind and a squeeze of lemon juice. Generously slather over grilled steak and fresh grilled artichokes with no apology necessary. Absolute magic.

made these for father's day. Finger licking good. Great flavor and not that hard to make with a sous chef. I am making them again this weekend. Make extra butter and keep in the freezer so it is easier to prepare the next time.

The anchovy butter is unbelievably good, though somehow the artichokes were not as tender as i would have preferred (probably more a problem with the artichokes not being as fresh as they should be). I think i would do this again with jerusalem artichokes.

This recipe is now considered a food group in my house - all the ingredients are my favorites. It is definitely worth the time spent. I had Himalayan salt in the house and used it in place of fleur de sel and garnished each 'choke with a single marinated anchovy(no salt) and kept 2" of the stem(very edible!).
