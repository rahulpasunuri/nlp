Perfection. Everyone loved this and it made a LOT of mushrooms, which we loved. The leftovers were great, too. This will definitely be in the rotation from here on.

It was good, but not the best chicken marsala I've had. Still searching for the best recipe.

Must double the sauce. I thickened the sauce with just small amount of buerre manie, otherwise it's tasty but runny. I also added minced garlic to the mushroom saute. Next time I will use a bit more marsala. I think I will also cube the chicken rather than keeping it a whole piece, and serve over pasta with the sauce and mushroom saute. Easy and tasty for minimal ingredients/prep/time.

A terrific "go to" recipe for ease of prep/cook time, flavor, and presentation. I'll definitely put this in my "last-minute-guests-over-for-dinner" rotation (don't really have a formal "rotation" and if I did that would be a pretty specific entry - but you get the idea). There also seems to be room for play in the recipe as I sub'd reconstituted dried oyster shrooms and shitakes and they performed well. I used dried marjoram. No problem. Though not necessary, more of good thing, especially this easy is worth it, so I'll make it with 1 1/2 - 2 times sauce next go round. For those fretting the chicken cooking time: best way around that is to pound your breast with a mallet to get it even and flatter (it'll even look bigger so you plating becomes easier too). I usually cover the breast with plastic wrap so as to not have to clean the mallet after. Also, relatively high heat and a little less oil gives it that nice fond to deglaze into the sauce.

We loved this! I never tried marjoram before but it was delicious - a mild, fresh taste. Adding the 2 bags of spinach after removing the mushrooms/shallots and before making the sauce was a great addition. My husband said to be sure I served this with french bread the next time so he could sop up more of the sauce. I served this with Frisee and Fire Roasted Potato Salad, also from this site.

I doubled the sauce and mushrooms and this came out great. I'll be making this one again.

7 minutes is way to short to cook a thick chicken breast half. I didn't have fresh marjoram so I used a mixture of dried Italian herbs, mostly marjoram. Used fresh shitake mushrooms which were the best thing about this dish. Needs more sauce as well.

Rating: 3
Doubled the sauce and the mushrooms. Used Shitake and Baby Bellas. It's a great meal that we would serve to guests. I'd realy say 3 1/2 but couldn't.

This recipe is delicious; even picky DH liked it. I used sage instead of Marjoram as sage is what I had. Used more chicken broth and mushrooms than the recipe calls for. Instead of cream, I used an extra 1/2 cup chicken broth mixed with about 1 teaspoon cornstarch to thicken. I put the chicken and mushroom mixture back into the saucepan with the sauce and rewarmed before serving over al dente capellini that had been mixed with a little olive oil and shaved parmesan. This recipe is a keeper.

Very tasty and easy enough for a weeknight dinner. I didn't have Marsala so I used a dry sherry. The sauce came out lovely. I had sliced crimini in the fridge so I just uased that and the mushrooms were great, the best part. There just weren't enough of them. Next time I'm doubling the amount of mushrooms.

Rating: 2
And I second the comment from Ypsilanti. It needs at least twice the sauce.

Rating: 2
Yum. Make sure your mushrooms have enough flavor. I used mostly baby bellas. If I make it again, I'll use more shiitakes and criminis and probably some porcinis, and/or portobellas and/or morels. I forgot the chicken broth, and I didn't miss it, possibly because I reserved the drippings from sautéing the chicken breast halves.

Rating: 3
Used this as a start to an ad hoc recipe based on what was in the house. Used white wine instead of Marsala, skipped the chicken broth and shallot completely. Changed marjoram to tarragon. Here's the deal - why not place the chick on the plate and cover with the sauce? It's the best part.

I was disappointed. Chicken was not done and I cooked it for at least twice the time. Sauce was runny for our taste but flavor was good.

Made this tonight. It was very good. Served it layered as others had recommended. First, rice,(had unexpected guests and not enough spinach) then spinach sauted in olive oil and garlic, mushrooms, a big spoon of the cream sauce, with the lovely looking chicken breast on top. Three generations loved this meal. A five year old, two thirty somethings, and two pushing 60. I made the recipe exactly as stated. It looked and tasted like a restaurant meal.

This turned out well, and even better reheated another day. I added garlic and doubled the Marsala. As some of the cooks suggested, I used sage vs. the majoram. Served the mushrooms over pasta and placed the chicken breast on top of mushrooms and spooned Marsala cream sauce over the chicken and pasta. You cannot go wrong with this recipe. I would give it 3-1/2 forks (somewhere below "awesome"), but we have to work with whole numbers.

Delicious! Doubled the recipe as there were 6 for dinner. Everyone loved it. Watch the sauce so you don't boil it down too much - or you won't have enough! I used 5 different types of mushrooms. I didn't weight them - I just purchased a bunch and used all of them. Made a rice (mixture of wild, brown and white) and steamed some fresh asparagus (in season now). I'll make this again!

This was a great recipe (and I've tried many). The only substitution was using summer savory for marjoram (I'm not a big fan of marjoram, and the summer savory is a nice mellow substitute for me). I made more sauce and glad I did. The sauce is wonderful. did.

This is a restaurant-quality preparation that is great for company, as well as a romantic dinner at home. The only change I would make is to add a bit more Marsala to the sauce. I think this is definitely a matter of taste, so use the 3T as a guideline, not a rule and adjust accordingly. I also didn't have low-sodium chicken broth, but used regular with no ill effect. I simply adjusted the salt down in other aspects of the recipe.

A big hit! Used sweet sherry instead of marsala, doubled the sauce quantity, served over linguine. Used a combination of oyster, shitake, and white mushrooms. Everyone loved it, even the kids (ages 10 and 12).

My husband and I loved this. Didn't have a good mushroom selection so I used half fresh brown mushrooms and half reconstituted dried shiitakes. I also served over fresh linguine as suggested by a few others, I should have doubled the sauce. Very easy to make and quite delicious.

Forgot to add. I served it with wild rice and roasted asparagus.

I loved this recipe! I used sherry instead of marsala because I couldn't find it at the store. It still turned out great! Used fresh marjoram and it was delicious. I will definitely follow some of the suggestions of using spinach or linguine underneath it next time.

I have several similar recipes in my EPI box and am happy to realize we hadn't made this one before. We made as is, except used dried marjoram. I cut chicken breasts in half to thin and cook faster, this worked well for this recipe. we loved the contrast of the crispy shallots w/ mushrooms on top of chicken and sauce. other recipes we've tried simmer this together, and i think this worked really well.

Great recipe. Fed the chicken to my 3 and 5 year old with no sauce but a little lemon juice. I would double the sauce for four adults eating the chicken and mushrooms over rice.

Nice, simple recipe for a delicious entree which I served over linguine. I pounded the chix until even and substituted half and half for the whipping cream and used crimini mushrooms.

Rating: 4
Quite delightful! Used dried marjoram- 2 tsp each for chicken, mushrooms, and sauce--which worked well. Also used regular mushrooms. It did take a little longer to cook the chicken--I was afraid it would burn but it didn't, and the marjoram was nicely cooked into the outside of the chicken. Sauce wasn't thick as other cooks noted. But since you don't need much, reducing it well works fine. I like the idea of adding garlic, although I don't really think it needed anything else. Next time, will probably use fewer mushrooms and try evaporated milk instead of whipping cream.

I was looking for a monkfish marsala recipe, could not find one soI chose this one, I substituded the monkfish for the chicken and it worked out great, prepared the monk fish just like the chicken is prepare here, I did add a few more ounces of mushrooms and it worked out great, I served the fish over barley risoto and the dinner went wonderful.

I also had marsala and decided to try this - I picked this rather than some similar recipes because it seemed less complicated. It was delicious! As others noted the sauce did not thicken too much. However, I served it over linguini which absorbed the sauce. Next time, I think I would make more linguini as it disappeared with the sauce. But the chicken was also excellent. I didn't look closely at the recipe when I went to the store so I only had about 1/3 cup of shallots, but it didn't seem to matter. Do try to find the fresh marjoram as it gives it a very distinctive and excellent flavor. I will definately make it again. Everyone loved it and it is fairly quick and easy to make.

Good but not as delicious as others raved about....I too did not include the marjoram or any other spices and it was still tasty....agreed with another reviewer and used spinach - very tasty....took much longer to cook the chicken than was mentioned....my husband enjoyed it so we'll make it again for a change of pace.

I was searching for a recipe to use some marsala I had and some chicken. This recipe was really good. Like someone else noted, I didn't get a very thick sauce, but it was nice anyway. I'll make it again and see if I can get the sauce thicker. I may also experiment with a little bit more Marsala and see what happens.

Rating: 4
This recipe was WONDERFUL! I varied a few small components, as suggested by other posters. First of all, I used sage instead of marjoram to give it a fresh feel. I also added a bit of parmesan cheese (very little) to give the sauce a richer flavor. Finally, I added garlic which was a huge bonus. I cooked it with green beans with garlic (as another poster suggested) and it was a delicious meal.

This is the second time we've made this receipe and it definitely turned out better the second time. I think it was the sauce this time that made the difference. I agree with some other reviewers that it's missing garlic and will definitely add lots of it the next time we make it.

Very good and fairly easy. Will make again and with the following changes becomes elegant enough to serve to company: 1) Added 1 clove garlic and 1 Tbls Marsala to mushroom, shallot and herb mixture(used sage b/c I couldn't find marjoram with lovely results). 2)Used chicken tenders and stuffed with mushroom, shallot and herb stuffing, closing with wooden skewer. 3) Cooked in 350F oven for 20 minutes. 4) Doubled sauce ingredients and added grated parmesan(great for thickening this otherwise thin sauce) and all the leftover mushroom stuffing. With wild rice this is a rustic and elegant dish.

I had never had Marjoram before this recipe and I have to say I think it is horrible. I think this recipe would be much better if you left the marjoram out. The sauce was great, but I realized 1/2 way through cooking that I didn't like marjoram so I didn't put it in the sauce, that was the best part. Not my favorite recipe but I will try it again without marjoram

Rating: 4
The marjoram adds a subtle something to this marsala recipe, and of course shiitakes are so delicate with the sauce. Not a ton of cream either, so it's healthy; antioxidants in those mushrooms, too. This is my new version of Marsala!

Next time I will add more Marsala and cook sauce down more. Was a little thin.

This recipe was absolutely delicious, but we added our own special touch! We added lots of fresh crushed garlic to the chicken while it was browning as well as fresh garlic to the mushroom shallot mixture. Additionally, after removing the mushrooms and shallots, we then added two bags of fresh baby spinach and cooked that down in the pan juices. After we removed the spinach, we added the broth, marsala, marjaram and creme and cooked that down as directed. We layered each plate as follows: Spinach, mushrooms, chicken, sauce. My family ranted and raved about this meal. We'll definitely make it again! A dish certain to impress guests!

This was a simple, tasty dish. Perfect for a weeknight meal. The sauce didn't thicken enough for my taste and I followed the recipe so not sure what happened with that. Nonetheless, I will make this again but probably not 'special' enough for company.

I made this on a whim last night. It said it was quick, and it was!! I did add two cloves of minced garlic to the mushrooms and shallots. MMMMMMMMM garlic! It plated up beautifully and even my kids enjoyed the mushrooms! Don't skimp and go for dried marjoram use fresh and make the sause! It was delish with sauted spinach with garlic.

another winner recipe! my young daughters (8 & 10) loved this along with hubby. Great weekday dinner... easy and quick. Make sure to season each layer as you cook (mushrooms need salt when sauteeing... easier to season then, or else more salt will be needed afterwards). I added more fresh marjoram than called for and a little garlic with the shallots. Made Roasted Green Beans with Garlic along with this, also from this site.

I made this last night for my husband & I and it was fabulous! I reduced the chicken, mushrooms and shallots amounts to make the dish serve two, but I made a bit more sauce to have over pasta. I plan to make this for our Supper Club next Saturday.

This is a solid dish to cook for the family at the end of the day. Simple and tasty, but nothing spectacular that you would want to make for someone you were trying to impress. It can easily be made for 2 instead of 4.
