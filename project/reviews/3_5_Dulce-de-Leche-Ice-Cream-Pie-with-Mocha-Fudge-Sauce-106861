More work than necessary. Ice cream and sauce would be just as good. Crust is very fragile and ice cream can't simply be "spread" in crust without breaking. Would use mixer to soften ice cream better and allow gentle spreading.

I have made this dessert several times since Thanksgiving 2006. When I made it that first time, the only sound coming from family and guests were, "hmmms." It has been given the name "crack pie," because it's so good and addictive. As other reviewers have said, the sauce alone can be used for ice cream. I plan to make it again this weekend.

Well, I suppose I should have listened more to the great reviewers on Epicurious! This was a nice dessert, but as mentioned previously, it's not as good as it sounds. The sauce alone with ice cream might be better. This doesn't quite come together as a pie. Oddly, the crust is good, the ice cream is good, and the sauce is good. My sauce was also VERY thick prior to putting onto the ice cream...watch the cooling time. While this was a fine dessert, I wouldn't make any of the components again.

I made this pie for our gourmet club last weekend. It got four forks from all twelve people - it is sooooo delicious. I agree however that 30 min. is not long enough to cool the sauce before drizling on the first layer. Cool the sauce completely by putting it in the refrigerator. And, use Haagen Daz ice cream - heavenly. Sauce recipe makes to much sauce. It could easily be cut in half but why when it tastes so good on other desserts. Is this recipe a keeper - YES!

This is one of my all time favorite recipies - quick, easy & gets rave reviews any time. And if you're in a rush, you can always cheat and buy a gram cracker pie crust.

Ok, so anytime there is ice cream, it has to be good. Just wasn't as good as I expected. The sauce was FABULOUS, but I had the opposite as many reviewers - my sauce was WAY to THICK! I can't even get through the pie with that layer in between. Just ends up smooshing all together. I think I may have gone passed "slightly thickened" while melting my chocolate. I think the sauce just on regular ice cream would be great - don't go through the trouble of making the pie.

I've made this pie several times now and continue to get rave reviews. The sauce recipe allows for 2 maybe 3 pies so you could cut it in half. I used a pre-made crust one time and regretted it, make the one from scratch!

I thought this recipe looked prettier and tastier in the magazine. But, all things considered, it was pretty darn good. I love dulce de leche ice cream as it is, but to make a pie out of it...yum! It wasn't as fabulous as I thought it would be, but it was still tasty.

This recipe is fabulous. My guests loved this pie. I agree with previous comments that waiting 30 minutes for sauce to cool is not long enough before drizzling on the first layer of ice cream. Put it in the fridge and let it cool completely so it doesn't melt the ice cream. I used the Haagen Daz caramel ice cream and the pie was so good I've thought about it every day since! Bravo!

This is one of the most amazing pies I have ever eaten, the perfect combination of coffee and mocha flavors! Amazing!

Rating: 3
The mocha sauce was delicious, but it was fairly thin and hard to control the drizzling. The pie itself was delicious, but the assembly was kind of messy. I would just but the ice cream and use with the sauce and some whipped cream, since the pie presentation was only so so.

This was a success with my guests. Everyone loved it. However, I found that the sauce gets even runnier when you drizzle it onto the ice cream layers, so it doesn't hold together like in the photo. I think if you refrigerate it and stir it really well, you can form better "lines" on top of the pie, so it will be pretty. I also ladled the sauce around the pie slice on the plate for effect. Very nice.

Agreed with all the other reviewers. Excellent and easy. I tripled the crust recipe for two pies and had about 1 C. crumbs left over. Doubled the sauce recipe and had a lot of sauce left over. Also used Hagan Daz and everybody was raving. I wouldn't use this for a formal dinner party, but for fun summer gatherings it is absolutely perfect!

this recipie is really quick and easy, albeit a little time consuming. The integral part of this recepie is good ice cream, i used hagandaz tres leche with caramel and piece of cake mixed in it. the crust is really good, the peacans make it nuttier and crunchier. really simple to make, but to make yourself sound better, pretend u made the ice cream too

This pie is THE BOMB! It is easy to make for such elegant results. I have made it several times now and it always gets very quiet in the room when people start eating, then there are many ooos, aahhhs, more silence and always people needing seconds and thirds! (And later requests for the recipe.) There is always a lot of sauce left over and it is great over regular ice cream, dressing up a last minute dessert for company. Make this pie and enjoy!!!!!!

I made this for a large, summertime BBQ, and it was a fantastic addition to a great meal on a hot day. I've even had people offer to pay me to make it for their family events! Definitely a do-again!

I have made this several times now and it has been a huge success each time. Indeed, it will be my contribution to our New Year's Eve progressive dinner. I love the fact you can make it ahead - even more than one day before.

I made two pies for Labor Day and everyone loved them. (I had 3+ pieces myself...) I needed about a batch and a half of crust for each pie. As for the chocolate sauce, it was really delicious but made way too much. I will definitely make this again!!

This pie is delicious. It's kind of time consuming to make, but if you're patient enough to make it, it's definitely worth it!! The sauce is excellent served on other things too, such as stirred into coffee for a mocha treat or on top of vanilla ice cream.

I made this for my dad's birthday, and received rave reviews all around. I used a 9 1/2 inch tart pan with a removable bottom in lieu of the pie plate, and followed the advice to double the delectable crust. It was just right. I have lots of mocha fudge sauce left over-- I'm sure it'll be just as delicious over vanilla ice cream.

Fantastic! Very easy to make and I got a lot of raves on the crust. Unfortunately, while a great summer treat, melts very quickly even in an air-conditioned building, so eat fast!

This was INCREDIBLE! Everyone loved it, and the sauce (swoon) was heavenly. I've since made it to top ice cream and a plain pound cake and it was great. Oh, and just between us, I ate it by itself one night very late when I had a craving for chocolate. Definitely a keeper!

Wow! What a great mocha sauce! I served this at a dinner party with great success. I used 32 vanilla wafers and ended up adding additional melted butter for the crust.

This pie was delicious - especially the sauce, which I would make by itself to have on hand for ice cream topping. I also really liked the crust and based on previous reviews made more than what was called for. Would be great with coffee ice cream, too.

This was a hit at a summer dinner party. Cool and refreshing after a nice light supper, yet packed with lots of rich flavour! Next time, I would try making the pie with a chocolate cookie crumb crust instead as I sometimes find nuts bother me. Plus, there is tons of yummy fudge to eat before, during and after!

This pie was a HUGE hit at a neighborhood party - would definitely make again!! I also had a tough time making the crust cover the entire bottom and sides of my pie dish- I would suggest making another half recipe or doubling it for an even thicker crust. The crust was very tasty and overall this was a great-looking pie!

I thought this was excellent! Served it for Father's Day dinner and it was a hit. The sauce is fantastic ~ thickens upon cooling so be careful if you reheat it because it will get runny again.

This pie was very easy to make! It was a little difficult to find the carmel ice cream, I had to go to several grocers to find it...haagen daz makes it. I found that the crust did not fill my 9 inch pie plate very well...I ended up using 1-1/2 of the recipe for the pie. My guests loved it! Its a keeper for those hot summer nights!
