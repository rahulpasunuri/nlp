Add a speck of dill and some chives. Perhaps some salt and pepper and it would be really good. I love new potatoes. There isn't too much you can do to ruin them.

Yeah...I don't know what happened...this really didn't turn out. I think I must have slipped up somewhere in the recipe

New potatoes are always delicious, but why didn't you print a recipe with a little umph to it, like new peas and potatoes or something different?

What is so special about this recipe? I usually add 1 tbs of chopped fresh dill, and that enhances both the taste and the looks of this dish.

A very easy dish for a person living alone, by cutting it down or leaving it alone it is still a good dish, goes with anything

I really like this recipe. It is great as a side dish to most anything or to eat alone.

This recipe sounds very delicious, but will probably taste even better when its prepared.
