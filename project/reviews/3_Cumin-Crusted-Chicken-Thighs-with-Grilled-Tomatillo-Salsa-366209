If you're thinking of making this without the salsa, don't. It tastes terrible with just the cumin rub.

I gave this 4 forks as it was a very simple and quick weeknight meal. The chicken does not need to marinate and the cumin crust tasted great with the grilled chicken. One thing the recipe is missing though is salt!! Definitely add some salt to the spice rub. I did not make the salsa, but grilled some corn and also made Mexican rice and a spicy cilantro slaw (from this site). Pretty quick and satisfying weeknight meal!

The cumin spice rub was delicious. Next time I will add a little kosher salt. I used boneless, skinless thighs, which are kind of a pain to grill, but the flavor was great. I chopped the cooked chicken and served with yellow corn tortillas, the tomatillo salsa, black beans and some avocado. I thought the salsa was good - and I omitted the oil. I roasted the tomatillos in the oven instead of on the grill - just easier. Nice change from tomato salsa.

After reading other reviews I decided to not make the tomatillo salsa and used a peach chipotle salsa found on this site for a similar recipe for pork. The chicken was delish and the salsa paired nicely. Served this with Jasmine rice with garlic, ginger and cilantro also available on this site.

Hi Chilipepper - if you use your mouse to click on the words "Cumin Spice Rub" in the recipe ingredient list, this will take you to the spice rub recipe page

I'm looking for the recipe for the cumin crust rub.

We made the recipe as written - the ingredient list is easy and other than tomatillos everything was in the pantry or fridge. The chicken with the cumin rub was delicious. The tomatillo salsa was nice, but tasted mostly of lime and cilantro. The charring of the tomatillos on the grill did not seem to impart any flavor, and they basically fell apart when chopped in the blender. We will be making the chicken again, but probably with a different salsa.
