This was delicious. I could not find chocolate wafer cookies and thank you for the suggestion to use chocolate graham crackers.

Very good and easy. Found the cookies with ice cream toppings, not in the regular cookie section. Before I found those, I used the 100 calorie Oreo thin crisps.

Perfect. A little under 1 1/2 sleeves of chocolate graham crackers did the trick, and I used Ghiradelli semisweet chocolate.

This is one of the best pie crusts I've ever had.

This recipe is perfect for a dinner party! It's easy to make and is always a big hit. I've made the pie twice now and each time it gets better. I wasn't able to find chocolate cookies for the crust, but Oreos with the filling scraped off is a nice substitution. Also, I strongly recommend using Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate for both the filling and crust recipes.
