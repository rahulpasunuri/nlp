I have been making these cookies every holiday season for at least three years now. They are such a fan favorite that I make them for the birthdays of people who love them as well. I double the amount of coffee (I buy a small amount of fresh ground coffee and make the cookies the same day), add an extra cup of chocolate chips and omit the nuts. They freeze well and are are fantastic for cookie exchanges.

I'm always a bit nervous to make something new without a picture to go by, but these cookies were worth the risk. I baked these cookies to bring to my boyfriend's house for a big-family-Thanksgiving and they were a HIT. I highly recommend! The espresso flavor is subtle and the blend of chocolates is delicious.

Pretty-much perfection. More like a brownie in the shape of a cookie. I am not complaining. Sometimes I do get soupy batter... sometimes I don't. When I do, I just put the batter in the fridge for a 15 minutes or so, also let the cookie sheets sit in the freezer for awhile.... then they don't over spread in the oven.

Horrible! Were soupy, not thick at all. This is not a batter cookie. Something is not right with this recipe. There is absolutely no way any enjoyed wasting so much chocolate. My son, loves chocolate! He threw them in the garbage. Wish I could add photo if $25.00 of chocolate in the Toluet.

Every time I make these things I am showered with a mix of compliments (oh my god these are heaven!) and complaints (I hate you, I cannot stop eating these!), so I have started referring to them as "My famous chocolate espresso cookies" even though it is not my recipe. These come out kind of cakey....almost brownie like....and they are absolutely delicious!

I messed up the recipe the first time I made these--I melted all of the chocolate and baked them as brownies. I am making them again today and will make the same "mistake" because my daughter loved them!

I have made this recipe in a bakery for a while now. It is a favorite and really so low maint. It works very well with a gluten free flour (bob's) or a lower gluten but not gluten free variation such as spelt or emmer. I have used ground espresso, instant espresso, chunked white chocolate rather then the chocolate chips in the last phase, a splash of grand marnier (in the true recipe) dried cherries and walnuts for the holidays and decaf espresso for the kiddies. Make a large batch and scoop them out in 1 or 2 ounce balls, freeze, zip lock them for a quickie. Love love love this recipe. Just have fun with it and make it your own.

This is one of my favorite cookies ever (and I bake lots of cookies). I can't understand why people say that they're brownie-like as if that's a BAD thing - the texture of these cookies is one of the best parts! Mine came out perfectly - the only alterations I made were to use 1.5 Tbsp espresso and pecans instead of walnuts. Batter was not runny at all. Amazing, tasty cookies.

I reduced the sugar to 1 cup, and the cookies were plenty sweet - but then again, I melted all the chocolate in Step 1 by mistake. Didn't seem to make much difference, the cookies is as described (delicious but more brownie than cookie). I would make them again, but this really isn't a traditional chocolate cookie.

FABULOUS!!Everybody loves these!

Rating: 4
I made these today, followed the recipe exactly and they are fabulous!. Nice shiny, crackled exterior and moist interior. In reading the problems some cooks had with the texture of the batter, I offer some suggestions. Let the melted chocolate/egg mixture cool down before you add it to the batter. Make sure you use large eggs, not extra large eggs. Beat the egg, sugar, coffee mixture as directed until it is thick...it took about six minutes with my KitchenAid. When you add the flour mixture, stir only until combined, not longer. Same with chips/walnuts. Bake only one sheet of cookies at a time. I think if you do all of this, you will not have runny batter. My batter was thick and when I scooped out the last of it, it had become almost fudge like in consistency, There really is no need to chill it.The cookies retained their shape and are about 2 inches diameter and 1/2 inch thick.

Definitely comes out the consistency of a cake/brownie... very delicious though. I tried them for the first time tonight and I love them:)

If you are debating whether or not to make this recipe, you are only wasting time between now and you eating these delicious cookies.

Yummy but not so much of a cookie... more like a brownie seperated into smaller portions... I'd make it again but in a 9x9 pan and call it Chocolate Espresoo Brownies!

Loved these! I read many of the reviews, and cut down the sugar by 2 Tbs and I also used bittersweet chocolate for the 1 cup of chips that was melted (I am not a fan of sweet...). I used 1 full Tbs of ground espresso (would even add a touch more next time!) and chilled the dough for about 15 min in the freezer before baking. I was rewarded with absolutely wonderful little bites of decadent chocolate flavor! Slightly crisp on the outside and chewy inside. Just right for an after dinner glass of red wine or a cup of coffee.

The BEST and only chocolate cookie we bake! A winter specialty; my family doesnt like chocolatey things in the summer. Ive been bringing these to an office cookie exchange since the recipe came out in 1997. I thought the only cookie that could outshine these was the Chocolate Cherry Rugelach(epicurious), so one Christmas I made the effort, but everyone asked after the Espresso Cookies. Go figure! As many reviewers seem to lament the effort these take to make, I have gradually streamlined the recipe to be food processor friendly, keeping all measurements intact. I made a mistake once and added the ground coffee to the flour instead of to the egg mixture. Consequently, we enjoyed a great burst of coffee flavor with every bite, and I have been making them that way ever since.

Wish I'd found this recipe before a cookie exchange last week! They are amazing and very easy to make. Will make them again and again.

These are FABULOUS!!! Chocolaty & sooo yummy!!!! A keeper!! My modifications included: Used 1 TBL fresh espresso coffee [finely ground, Turkish grind] Used Baker's Bittersweet Choc squares. Used Pecans rather than walnuts as didn't have walnuts. I was out of unsalted butter so used regular salted butter. These were FABULOUS!! OMG!!!! Used sm. scoop [1 1/4 inches in diam] & got 50 cookies w/ 4 bites per cookie. Like flourless choc cake...so delicious...one is not enough! Just let the Kitchenaid beat while preparing rest of ingredients. That was longer than 3 min for me. Used silpat liners on pans. They were perfect...how unusual for me as I am not a cookie maker at all!!!! Can't stop eating them!

This is, in my opinion, the perfect chocolate cookie - dark, chewy, rich but not too sweet (the espresso cuts the sweetness just enough and gives it a depth of flavor that is heavenly)...I doubled the recipe as well and used Medaglia D'oro brand instant espresso coffee. To die for.

Fabulous! I doubled the recipe (thankfully I have a set of 'odd' measuring spoons, including a 2/3 tsp). I made it as written except: 1.5T espresso (Sbux french roast) per batch, no walnuts (subbed white chocolate chips). Really they came out great. Some notes: to get to the level of thickness the recipe called for I beat (in my kitchenaid) about 10_ minutes. But I also had more eggs to work with. I think most reviewers with trouble with the batter didnt get the eggs thick enough. I didnt add extra flour or refridgerate it at all and my dough was quite thick and the cookies held their shape well. Only tip I have is make sure not to make the cookes too big - a teaspoon over-full is just right.

I made these cookies for my chocolate-loving friends and they loved them. I prefer bittersweet chocolate, so used that instead of semisweet. I also cut back on the sugar a bit as I prefer not-so-sweet desserts. After reading the comments, I made sure to beat the batter until it reached almost a pudding consistency. It took a bit longer longer than noted in the recipe, but the cookie batter was not runny. I did not need to chill the dough - the cookies turned out beautifully.

Absolutely outstanding everyone raved. The best chocolate cookie recipe I've made. I followed the recipe exactly and I agree with a previous reviewer that the batter/dough needs to really cool so that the cookies retain their shape.

The taste of these cookies, with the extra ground coffee is excellent. I followed the instructions and cooked the first two batches immediately. I didn't care for the large thin cookies, which were not appetizing to look at! However, by the time I was ready for the 3rd batch, the dough had cooled to a more manageable consistency and I was able to make a lovely 2" cookie with a dense center and slightly cracked & crispy exterior. Next time I will let the dough stand for 30 minutes before starting to bake.

One of my favorite cookie recipes. I add a bit more espresso for a stronger coffee flavor. Also, I substitute white chocolate chips for the walnuts. Delicious.

Excellent cookies! When I made my first batch, I accidentally melted all of the chocolate together. They still turned out great--with a molten chocolate center. My second batch was by the book, and fantastic as well. I drizzled both batches with white chocolate to make them more festive--and they were a hit with all!

Rating: 4
This is a great, rich cookie. A must for chocolate lovers. You only need a couple to satisfy a craving. Next time I'll use less sugar and more espresso because they are a little sweet in addition to their richness. You get enough sweetness from the chocolate chips without needing all the sugar. Used pecans instead of walnuts for personal preference. Definitely try this recipe.

Rating: 4
This may well be the best cookie recipe there ever was. If you have the ability to bake all the cookies at once and immediately, do it: they spread out gloriously thin and have a divine chewiness that highlights the inclusion of the walnuts and the espresso flavor. If you must wait between batches, the second batch is still amazing, but results in something more classically brownie-like. Either way, a cookie not to be missed.

Wonderfully rich! I made some with and without nuts. The batch I made with the nuts was much better (toasted pecans), but they were both unbelievably tasty. You really must like chocolaty deserts to enjoy this.

These were lovely. They were a bit tricky to shape because the batter was so soft, so I omitted the chocolate chips and walnuts in the final mix, put the batter in a pastry bag and piped it out. I added walnut halves on top before putting them in the oven

I am disappointed in this recipe. Even though I used high quality chocolate (Scharffenberger's and Green and Black's organic baking chocolate) and coffee (Peet's), and prepared as directed, the cookies were dry. The only alerations I made the recipe were 1 tsp cinnamon and 2 tbs ground coffee. The flavor is complex, chocolatey, and rich, but the texture is unappealing. The cookies are even difficult to swallow. I don't know what would make them moist. Any suggestions?

Rating: 3
So good!! I upped the coffee to a bit over a tablespoon, which was perfect for me because I love coffee. It was the perfect cobination of sweet, fudgy bitterness. I might try chilling dough a bit before placing on tray. It was more like pancake batter and hard to keep cookies from running into eachother. Only other downfall is that it doesn't appeal to all audiences. I have a few friends who don't care for coffee and it was definitely not for kids. But for me, it was one of the best cookie I've ever had.

Rating: 4
Wow, these are GREAT! I upped the coffee to 1 1/2 TBLS and omitted the walnuts. The dough is runny, but I found that if I just let it stand for a few minutes (don't refrigerate) it scooped out better and gave a slightly thicker cookie. The previous poster is correct in saying that you really need to make sure your eggs are at that ribbon stage. These are moving to my all time favorite cookie list!

I made this recipe exactly as stated and it turned out just fine. No need to add extra flour or chill the batter; the batter is thin and the cookies are on the thin side and chewy, almost an under-baked texture. I got rave reviews on them from an office party. For my own taste, I might add extra coffee next time.

These were fantastic. Extremely rich in chocolate, especially since I used the 60% cocoa chips. Out of curiosity I tried baking half with freshly-made dough and half with refrigerated dough. The half made with fresh dough were significanly better - softer as well as more flavorful. I think I'll add more espresso grounds next time, but that's the only change I'd make.

Just a side note from the creator of the recipe..the sundried tomato cafe. I (chef and owner) kept reading through the reviews and several people were chilling the batter. The recipe was created to cook these cookies imediately, and if they are two thin, then the recipe failed. They should cook up nice and plump. I tried the chilling method and all be it the cookies were good, they were not the same at all. I am glad so many people are enjoying these.

i love these cookies - chocolate and coffee are a great combination. i've made this twice: once at a home using just the microwave to melt the chocolate+butter and once at a friend's home (no microwave) using a metal bowl set above barely simmering water. turned out great both times. yes definitely chill the dough for a while before baking and you won't have the cookie-bleeding problem. i also tried freezing the dough for about a week before baking, and that turned out fine too.

Rating: 4
great cookie recipe. No need to add extra flour, as long as you refrigerate the dough for about an hour before baking. I melted the butter and bakers chocolate (in squares- no need to chop it) in the microwave for 2 minutes. Then stirred in the 1 cup of chocolate chips- they melt from the heat of the butter. Makes for a little less cleanup.

Rating: 3
I tried to make three diferent types of cookies with this recipe; Choc chip espresso, choc. choc chip, and choc chip walnut cookies. It was my fault for not thinking it through a little more. I ended up only pouring the melted chocolate in one 1/3 batch, and obviously that was too much chocolate (too dry), plus my recipe as a whole had too much butter, so all the cookies oozed out over my backing pan, and were flat. All in all, besides my mistakes, the cookies were still yummy. Next time follow the recipe or 1/3rd it for each batch, and the results = perfection.

Very chocolatey, very tender cookie. No teeth required! I followed the recipe exactly, had no trouble with the batter. Kind of one dimensional, though, espresso taste was very mild. You could definitely increase the coffee to 2T, as suggested by previous comments. I won't be making these again, though, I like chewy cookies and not cakey cookies.

These are great cookies for the chocoholic! I messed up and melted all the chocolate. Followed the rest of the recipe as stated, increasing flour to 1 1/8 c and threw in just a handful of unmelted chips since I had SO much chocolate melted! Put in frig for one hour and baked. Even with my mistake they came out great. Somewhere between fudge and brownie. Very rich so I made them small. I will have to try again doing the recipe right!

This is a great cookie. I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was perfect. I followed others' advice to really whip the eggs/sugar/espresso, and found that the consistency of the cookie was perfect. No added flour needed.

Just going by the sheer quantity of chocolate in this recipe, it should go without saying but this cooking is @#$%ing good. I followed the suggestions of a number of other cooks and upped the flour to 1 C and the espresso to 1 T and it turned out great after being refrigerated for 30 minutes and baked for 9 to 10. I used the espresso roast from Chicago's local favorite roaster: Intelligentsia Cafe. The coffee was recently roasted and very intense, and its flavor is quite distinguishable in the cookie.

These cookies are exceptional. If you have ever made The Best Ever Brownies from _Baking with Julia _, these cookies are the cookie version of those brownies. I did make one small change to the recipe. Instead of using semi-sweet chocolate chips, I used Lindt bittersweet chocolate. The cookies are exceptional. When I made the recipe today, it only produced 26 cookies. This is truly a great cookie recipe. Do be aware that the batter is a very loose batter. Only 6 cookies fit on a cookie sheet at a time.

The taste is decadent. But I followed the recipe as is with the 3/4 c flour and found the cookies much too soft. I baked them for 11 minutes. They were the consistency of a chewy brownie but with cookie thickness, so they just fell apart. I'll have to play around with the flour because the taste is definately worth experimenting with it, just need to make the presentable.

My first reaction when I made these: I can't believe *I* made these!! I mistakenly used a full cup of flour--a serendipitous error! These were divine. The only other change I made was to bake them for 11-12 minutes, giving them a nice crunchy outside & gooey, luxurious interior. Oh, and before baking, I refrigerated the dough for about 45 min. These are chocolate perfection!

Heaven for dark chocolate coffee lovers. I used a bit more espresso, and Valrhona 70% chocolate. Yum!!! And the consistency of these cookies was great - not too crunchy, not too gooey, just right. Hubby thought they were not sweet enough...that's ok, more for me!

These were fantastic. I have made them 2x. I wouldn't recommend the extra flour. I added the extra flour the first time I made these and it was a bit dry for my taste. The 2nd time, I used the recommended 3/4 cup. I think the key is the part where you whip the eggs, sugar, and espresso until it's pale and thick. If you do this, you won't need the extra flour.

Incredible! Everyone loved them! They have the consistency between a brownie and a cookie. I also increased the amount of flour and coffee.

Next time I will try without the coffee --- just for a change in flavor. Wonderful!

This cookie is so, so good. Since this one's ALL about the chocolate, I used Scharffenberger Bittersweet and Semisweet home-cook bars (they had no unsweetened, so drop 2T sugar). I chopped the semisweet for the chips... Between the complex flavor of the chocolate and the smoky coffee, the flavor was remarkably rich and "adult" for a cookie. One note: GREASE a cookie sheet? Use a Silpat... duh!

Rating: 4
I agree with the other reviewer; there is no other cookie in our house anymore, either! These are to die for... We are not nut fans, so I leave them out, but otherwise I follow the instructions precisely. Every now and then, to change the fudgy consistency to a more cake-like texture, I use a full cup of flour instead of 3/4 c. Either way is delicious, just depends on what you're in the mood for!

These are yummy! I did substitute pecans for the walnuts as I like them more and also used a whole tbsp. of ground espresso. I also heeded advice and let the batter rest... it greatly improved consistency. Unlike some of the reviewers, both my husband and I felt the cookies VASTLY improved with aging... even better the 2nd day than the ones before! Beautiful crusty outside, moist center, extreme chocolate adult cookie... I don't think kids would like them as much. Definite "make again" for us, though!

I made this recipe for a Christmas cookie exchange. All the reviews are not in yet, but so far so good (I loved them). I got the espresso coffee from a local Italian restaurant I frequent. The deal was I get the coffee in exchange for some cookies. I was there today. They loved them and they want the recipe.

Whew! These were soooo good. I made to recipe, except I used pecans instead of walnuts. Wonderful.

These cookies are fabulous. I've made the recipe several times and cannot say enough good things about them. Intense chocolate and espresso flavour. Definitely don't overcook them.

FANTASTIC! A chocolate lover's dream! I used 1 T dark roast coffee for more flavor & although the recipe leaves this step out, I chopped the walnuts into choc chip size pieces. Heavenly.........

This is a great recipe for chocolate & coffee lovers! My husband and I loved this so much. I didn't put full amount of chocolate chips, but it was still rich and tasty. To add more texture and flavor, I added cacao nibs.

I agree with Del, they're better right out of the oven than they are the next day - but they're still lovely! I beat the eggs a little longer (about 5 minutes), as suggested, and had no problem with the batter. Living in a chocolate chipless country, I improvised by cutting up Dutch dark chocolate bars. Delicious.

These were definitely four forks coming out of the oven, but only three the next day. Made them without pretesting the recipe for a party, to go with catered Thai food and a platter of sliced oranges. A big hit, not difficult and not bitter at all (I used espresso-grind coffee from a coffee shop, their special espresso blend which I assume is Italian roast). Will certainly make again.

These are great. And if you really like the coffee flavor, add a little extra coffee to the mix.

Great cookies! Used instant Italian espresso powder, so no bitter taste. Definitely let batter stand five minutes before scooping. Very rich - small is good.

I thought it was too rich but my co-workers loved them. I used Italian Roast and thought that made the cookies too bitter. I probably won't make it again.

These cookies are delicious but rich so make them small. I got 60 nice sized cookies from the recipe.

Every time I bake these cookies they're a huge hit! I'm no expert when it comes to baking, but I've had no problems with this recipe, the directions are easy to follow and the results are delicious!

A real keeper. Brought a batch to my French class; none left. I followed the recipe as is, and it was fine. I would advise not overcooking if you want the inside moister, as it can get a little dry.

Made these omitting walnuts, substituting good quality semi-sweet chocolate for the chips, and melting all of the chocolate together. Turned out fantastic - the cookie plate emptied in no time and my guests were commenting how amazing they tasted. Alas, no one took pity on the cook and left me one...

These cookies are AMAZING! I've made them a few times and everyone always loves them. One suggestion is to let the batter cool to room temperature before starting to bake -- it helps the cookies retain their shape. Make them today!

When I read the poor review from Boynton Beach Florida I knew I had found the recipe I was looking for. My wife asked me to make dessert for her fellow workers at the hospital. It was her turn and she suggested chocolate chip cookies. I knew that this meant GREAT CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES. My wife and her friends are true chocaholics and the words "too chocolately" would be considered an oxymoron by her and her friends. Refinement in a chocolate dessert, they could not even relate to. I followed the recipe, but did not chop the walnut halves. I used Starbucks dark french roast coffee using the turkish grind. I used the entire recipe to make a total of fifteen cookies. The hospital therapy staff literally inhaled the cookies. A warning to anyone who makes this recipe: DO NOT STAND BETWEEN THE PLATE OF COOKIES AND A CHOCAHOLIC.

This is a very good recipe. The cookies that I made was soft inside and crispy on the outside. I changed the recipe a little by only melting 1/2 cup of choc chips and stir in 2 cups of toffee chips at the end. The result is amazing. the toffee taste definitely gives an edge over the regular chocolate chip cookies!

Rating: 1
Much too rich, gooey, and heavy - an overdose of chocolate. I love rich, deep chocolate desserts, but with some finesse. This one went over the limit and ended up like mud in my stomach. It was like eating chocolate pudding, chocolate mousse, chocolate chips, and chocolate fudge all in one dish - Enough is enough! This recipe needs some refinement. I would have liked it better without the extra cup of chocolate chips stirred in at the end. It was chocolatey enough without them. Would never make this again.

If you can't decide between this Chocolate Espresso recipe and the one from Bon Appetit, this is the one to make. While the flavor is the same, this recipe makes firmer dough and fluffier cookies that are more aesthetically pleasing as well as easier to handle.

They were easy to make. Did not chop the unsweetened chocolate, but just added as is and it did just fine. I omitted the walnuts and stirred in white choc. chips instead of the reg. choc. chips. Adds a different flare in taste as well as appearance. Did have a problem with them sticking to the cookie sheet, I used a spray release. Might try wax paper or shortening next time.

Rating: 3
Yummy! These are rich and delicious. As per other reviews, I let the batter stand and they were easier to scoop out. I used pecans instead of walnuts. I think that cinnamon would be a good addition, as another reviewer suggested, to break up the intense chocolate flavor slightly. Surpringly, I think I prefer these at room temp vs. warm because they firm up a bit.

A beautiful and wonderful tasting cookie. Subtle undertone of the coffebean, but you can feel the caffine. My husband has become an instant addict. For variation I added 1.5 tp of cinnamon. My batter turned out thick, but I did beat the egg mixture longer.

This was such a delicious cookie recipe! Not too espresso-flavoured, but very chocolatey! I did not use walnuts, and thought the batter had enough chocolate without adding the other cup of chocolate chips at the end. The batter itself was so good, it was hard to stop eating it to make the cookies!!

Rating: 3
i used lavazza coffee powder, and there was hardly any hint of coffee taste. Otherwise the cookies is really excellent. I will make it again without the coffee, and keep it as a decadent choc cookie instead. you definetely have to stand the batter for 10 minutes for it to 'thicken' before spooning out on the tray.

Rating: 4
These are really excellent and easy to make. As one cook said, let the batter rest awhile (5 minutes) or the batter will be too runny.

Rating: 4
These are possibly the best cookies I have ever made. I served them in my cafe and they have been requested on a daily basis ever since. One small problem is getting good consistency in the batter but no matter whether they are puffy or more flat they taste great.

*EXPECT RUNNY BATTER* and you will be ok.When the first batch was in the oven, I noticed that the batter had thickened up some for the next batch.The first batch came out flat and difficult to get off the cookie sheet after 1 minute of cool down time. The second batch was a little puffed and easier to get off the pan. I used my heavy duty shiny aluminum cookie sheets for the first two batches. Well lo and behold the third batch had thickened quite a bit therefore they came out puffed and beautiful! I also had my heavy dark aluminum cookie sheet for third batch. I wonder if the cookie sheet makes any difference? I will make these again now that I know to let the batter thicken.

A definite favorite around the office and so easy to make. I would recommend making a double batch.

Very good. I omitted the walnuts & added some black cherry juice that I got from a store on River Street in Savannah. Sooooooo yummy.

These cookies are wonderful!! They have a perfect soft, chewy texture, so I would like to try them as brownies. I did not have whole coffee beans to grind fresh, so I used regular old pre-ground drip coffee and they turned out great~ I left out the nuts because I cannot tolerate nuts in desserts (allergies), but if you like nuts, I am sure you will find these fantastic!

Rating: 4
Easy recipe, impressive-looking AND tasting cookie. Kind of brownie-like. Made them for a baby shower and took some to the office. RAVE REVIEWS BY ALL. I don't have anything that measures 1/3 teaspoon, so I did a heaping 1/4 teaspoon of the baking powder, and subbed 1-1/2 Tbs. Instant Espresso Coffee for the ground beans. I didn't notice any actually coffee flavor, just some of the bitterness of the strong espresso. Guess it worked out okay. These were the most impressive reviews I've had for a cookie recipe!

If you like coffee and you like chocolate, you will appreciate these cookies so much! They have an extremely chocolate-y taste! I sat there and ate one after another because they are kind of addictive. Kind of like coffee! And they are very simple cookies to make. They are soft and so good!

Made this as brownies as suggested by an earlier reviewer and was very very happy with the results. Made in a 9" square pan pyrex pan, baked at 350 for about 25-30 minutes. Heavenly. Very rich.

YUM YUM! Rave reviews all around from me, my friends and co-workers. Suggestion: I also thought the batter was runny, but found that when I waited about 15 minutes after first done mixing, the batter solidified and was easier to work with (and didn't run on the cookie sheet). But oh my - what a cookie!

They were pretty good, but I think they would have been better if I had had the dark roast coffee the recipe called for, rather than medium. Very tasty, nonetheless.

I took these cookies to the family Christmas party with my 6 extremely finiky Italian Aunts. Let me just say that for the first time in my life, I have gained acceptance and approval within my family, *sniff*, and each and every one of them swooned and asked for a copy of the recipe. As dificult as it was to work with the dough, I must say that these are the absolute in chocolate cookies!

I tried this and for some reason the batter was runny. So I have a cheaters was that tastes the same: 1 box brownie mix, 1 cup flour, 1 tbs finely ground coffee, 1/2 bag semi-sweet chips. Mix as directed on box, with extra flour and add coffee and chocolate chips. Bake at 350 on greased cookie sheet for 10-15 min.

OH MY ! This is a wonderful addition to any cookie repertoire. We used Starbucks Espresso Beans (no, I don't work for the company). I found the dough very easy to make and work with. Use the double spoon method to tranfer the dough to the cookie sheets. Can see that the brownie alternative would be a simple way to get your "fix" sooner. YUM !

I made these as brownies and liked them much better that way than as cookies. The batter was too hard to work with as a cookie batter, so I poured it into a 9 inch square baker and baked for 20-25 minutes at 350. Delicious if you like fudgy brownies.

We've made them 3 times and all that taste love them.

I made this recipe and followed the directions as stated, but I found that when mixing the sugar and the eggs that 3 minutes wasn't nearly long enough to thicken the batter. I have a Kitchenaid Mixer and it must have taken at least 10 minutes or longer to get it to the right consistency. Also, I found it much easier to let the cookies cool completely on the cookie tray before removing them. Other than those problems, they were absolutely delicious. Very rich and chocolaty. The espresso adds a great flavor.
