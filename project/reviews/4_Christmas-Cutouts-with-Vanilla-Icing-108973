This has been my 'go-to' cutout recipe for many years. These cookies always get rave reviews as they are a perfect balance between a sugar cookie and a buttery shortbread. I roll them out in flour rather than sugar. On a few occasions, the dough is slightly crumbly and dry - but I think it may be something I do or the weather because this is quite rare. I've used the icing recipe, but am looking into some closer to royal icing so that they will dry a little faster and so colors won't run together.

I almost didn't make this recipe because of the bad reviews and that would have been a mistake! This recipe was great. It was NOT too sweet. I am living in Germany with my German husband and Germans don't like a lot of American desserts because they are too sweet but they loved these cookies. They were very easy to shape and cut also! I will def make them again!

This is the BEST cutout recipe. I have used this one for awhile and just recently by accident used the Holiday Cutout Basic Butter Cookie recipe and could DEFINITELY taste the difference (and so could everyone else). Though all cutouts are basically the same ingredients I think the ratios and the addition of the sour cream really set this one over the top. It's simple and easy to make (I follow recipe exactly, though do cheat often and buy frosting). Note, I do roll out in flour rather than surgar (too much sweet). I have been told by several people it reminds them of their mother's or grandmother's recipes. I just went through my recipe box and deleted Holiday Cutouts and Basic Butter recipe so no confusion for me going forward:)

I love this recipe, quick, easy and delicious. It's definitely my go-to recipe for cut out cookies. I've never used the frosting, I have a powdered sugar glaze I use instead, but the cookies are awesome.

This is definitely one of our keeper recipies! I served them various times throughout the holidays and they always were eaten with requests for more. BUT, I have to roll out the dough with flour, not sugar, as the dough is sticky. I tend to make mine on the moist side by being generous w/ the sour creme and sifting the flour before measuring to avoid an overly floury taste I find so prevelant these days (I started baking 27 yrs ago and flour seems so much heavier these days...). The icing is way too sweet for me. I didn't have whole milk so ended up using 2 T. non-fat milk, 1 T sour creme and 2 T melted butter before I got anything that I could live with. These are good thin and crispy or thicker and soft - do some of both and definitely keep some (or all!) on the simple side by just sprinkling w/ colored sugar before baking. These cookies are wonderful!

I'm living overseas right now and couldn't find my old recipe. I wish I would've looked harder. The dough tastes great, but like other readers mentioned, it stuck to everything!!! I followed the recipe "to the T". Perhaps it should indicate how big the disk is supposed to be when put in refrigerator to cool, as I took mine out expecting to be able to roll it wider, only when this occurs it softens and sticks. Not my idea of baking with ease. Now I'm gonna have to call my mother-in-law and ask for her recipe. Ho ho ho.

Sorry - I forgot an important ingredient. I also added about a 1/2 tspn of xanthan gum. Important! I made them again and just sprinkled colored sugar on them, rather than the icing and they were still terrific. Be sure to keep the dough cold.

Gluten Free works with this recipe! First, I used my GF flour mix from authentic foods. I added an extra egg yolk. Was generous with the sour cream, and a dash of almond flavoring. I used 3 cups of the GF flour but needed to add more until it was the consistency I wanted. Very important to use parchment to flatten it into a disk and cover with parchment too. I made two disks and refrigerated until very solid. I dusted with a little more GF flour to roll and for one, I used the two sheets of parchment. It was easy to pick them up and place them on the silpat. You could also just transfer the parchment with the cutouts onto the cookie sheet. I baked them for about 13 minutes. GF cookies don't brown up very much, but you want them to be a bit golden. Some were thick and others were thin. Both came out well. The best GF cutout cookie - no one can tell they are GF!

I've made this recipe several times with my kid's classes. Due to classroom limitations, we don't cut them out. Instead, we roll into a large cherry sized ball and then press down with our thumbs once they're on the cookie sheet. The kids then decorate with sprinkles and sugar. They come out perfectly every time!

What a delicious recipe for cookies. I made these just before Christmas and my kids loved them. I did not use the icing recipe as I was short on time--I used Betty Crocker's cream cheese frosting on some of them which was fine. On the rest of the cookies, I sifted a bit of powdered suger on them while they were still warm and they were as good as the ones with frosting. I did make the cookie dough one day and baked the cookies the next day and I had no problems with the dough.

Icing was too sweet and tasted like pure powdered sugar. I made a half batch and still had leftovers. The dough was easy to work with and rolled out great

Not sure what I did wrong-- I've double checked the ingredients and they are all in there-- but my dough was so soft, even after 2 hours in the fridge, that I really couldn't roll it out and cut it.

This is the best recipe! My husband took a big batch to work and they were a big hit. One person even guarded the tray to make sure people didn't get too greedy! I had to make a double batch and send more. I will always make this recipe, not just for Christmas, but any holiday!

This is hands down the most delicious sugar cookie recipe I've made. I will never make another for decorating Christmas cookies. The sour cream adds a delicious flavor. I agree with the previous reviewer and suggest you stick to the 1/4" direction on thickness. It is sort of a soft dough if you don't refigerate it long enough. I suggest you roll the dough out on parchment paper with a sprinkle of sugar and you'll reduce the sticking.

I just found a recipe for my family cookbook! If you cut the cookies nice and thick, remove from oven when the edges start to brown and the tops look leathery, they will cool down perfectly. For those working with youngsters (or just like to make things look perfect), Craft Stores carry a product called "Frosting Doodles" for $2.00 per color. They are like writing on your cookies with pen but are really dimensional frosting . Super easy to work with, taste great and your cookies will look fantastic. The kids get a big kick out of the "perfect" results. How about swapping vanilla extract for peppermint for your candy cane cookies?

I made these for a cookie decorating party. We noted that while the cookies were good, we had a really hard time with them sticking (worse than I've ever had happen in my cookie past) so it took extra labor to get a batch in the oven. Our cookie cutters were standard to small sizes, but no way did this yield 5 dozen cookies. The icing was really powdery so it took a bit more milk to even it up.

these are the best butter cookies- follow foofy's review and roll between parchment which solves the sticky dough problem.

These (sugar) cookies were delicious and easy to make. My toddler had a blast stamping the dough with the cutouts. Using a convection oven, they baked perfectly in 12 minutes. I would definitely make them throughout the year using different cutouts, say for Valentines, etc.

I've never had much luck with cutout cookies, but I read Foofy from Cranberry Township's suggestion of rolling the dough between 2 sheets of parchment paper (don't know how good the American paper is, but the Italian version is great), using the cookie cutters, removing the dough around the cutouts (cookies don't spread much, so can be placed quite close together), and then putting the parchment with the cutout cookies on the cookie sheet. Worked like a charm. Thank you Foofy - it there were a culinary Nobel, you'd deserve it!

I was surprised to see so many positive reviews for this cookie! I found them to be mediocre--taste was OK, they were not especially easy to make, and the frosting was so sweet even my 2 year old wasn't interested. And the recipe b-a-r-e-l-y made 3 dozen cookies. Next Christmas I'll look for another recipe.

I made these with my daughter's kindergarten class and they were delicious! We did everything by hand and chilled the dough overnight before baking. Rather than roll them out, the kids made small balls and then pressed them flat with their thumbs. We decorated them with colored sugar and then baked. Very easy and very delicious!

I agree this dough is hard to work with. I had to work in 4 batches, refrigerating the rest of the dough while I worked with one. However, these are delicious. Also, I have made these twice and never get 4 dozen, 3 dozen at the most.

Wow. I have NEVER seen a recipe in which my experience has been so vastly different from everyone else's. This dough was HORRIBLE to work with, got stuck to everything, the sugar was useless, I had to use a ton of flour to keep it from sticking. They're not that amazing, they're just 'okay' and the recipe is waaaay too high maintenance for the outcome. Put dough in fridge for at least an hour before rolling out...chill cookies on baking sheet for up to an hour...nope, not worth it. Keep looking.

This was a lovely, delicious cooky. I particularly liked the fact that the little crenellations of the heart cutter I used remained crisp and distinct through baking.

These cookies were a big hit with everyone. All in all, I found the dough easy to work with as long as it was chilled. I did not use this vanilla icing, instead I used a favorite buttercream recipe that I thinned to a spreading consistency. I have looked for a good sugar cookie cut out recipe for years. I think this is the one.

I made these for my neighborhood cookie party this past Christmas. What a fun project! The results were quite pleasing: a pretty cookie, full of buttery, shortbread-like flavor. And, as another cook mentioned, tasty with or without the frosting. This one's a keeper. Thanks!

This is a great recipe. The cookies roll out and cut well, and are delicious! I froze extras uniced in a ziplock bag and used later. They were as good as fresh. (they were even good frozen with no icing.)

This is really a good sugar cookie recipe. In my experience, most cut out cookies look nice, but do not taste so good. These are very buttery and tender. I did take them out of the oven before they looked done. I watched for a barely brown edge, then they were just right w/ out being dry and crumbly. I also only made 1/2 of the icing recipe and still had some left. Yummy! Just finished the last two, instead of saving them for my kids!

The easiest recipe. I have never made cutouts before and this turned out perfect. The only thing is I didn't sift the flour, and so had to add more milk than the recipe called for to make up for it. But the cookies and frosting were pefect and I now plan on making these every holiday season.

These were great. Made two batches of dough (separately) one night and used up one for my daughter's class's Christmas party -- rave reviews. Made the second batch last night for my son's class party and he told me kids wondered which bakery we got them at. The second batch for some reason was easier to prepare (24 hours in fridge?) and didn't seem to stick to the rolling pin as much, but I did rub some flour into it for both batches. I omitted the step of putting sugar under and on top of the dough when rolling it out because with all the flipping of the dough it just seemed to get lost. I also opted again frosting them and instead stuck bits of colored chocolates (kind of like mini M&Ms) on cookies before baking. They looked and tasted wonderful!

This worked for me: I rolled the dough out between two sheets of parchment. Use your cookie cutters, then remove excess dough, and slide the whole parchment directly onto the cookie sheet. No mess!

I have not made cutout cookies for years because every recipe seemed to focus solely on the decorating. None had much flaovr and too many were just hard rocks of sugar. These were absolutely lovely. The dough could not be easier to work with and the re-rolled dough came otu as tender as the first batch. This is a keeper for me and I make TONS of cookies every year for Christmas.

I've always avoided rolled out cookies because the dough is generally very finicky, but this recipe was a pleasure. I made it exactly as written with no additions or substitutions, and the cookies and icing were fantastic. The icing does dry quickly, so if you're planning to add sugar crystals, work quickly.

Made these exactly to recipe, and they didn't disappoint! Easy dough to work with, although it started sticking to the rolling pin right at the end. I found 1/4 inch to be just right. I cut out many stars and frosted with different colors for a church kids' party, and they were a huge hit. I'll use this for future holiday baking.

I tried this because the sour cream addition in this recipe sounded good. The cookies were much too salty for us. Later batches of 1/2 - 5/8 inch thick cookies were better than our early thinner batches which also came out too crunchy and dry. I ended up throwing away some dough, and that's hard to do three days before Christmas. Thank goodness butter is on sale everywhere. I prefer the butter cookie recipe on epicurious.
