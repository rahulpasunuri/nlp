What would you put this topping on? I wish they'd give some suggestions because it looks interesting.

I added the bleu cheese and the kalamatas to this, and served it all over spinach as a salad. It was delicious!

This was amazing! Everyone at our weekly potlucks loved it. I added the optional blue cheese and halved kalamata olives... will definitely make this again!

Blue cheese with this is GREAT! I like the previous reviewer's suggestion of adding pears (or even mission figs would be good!). Toasting the pine nuts I felt was essential to really bringing out the flavors.

this recipe was outstanding. i did make it my "own", by adding sliced pears (peeled) and gorganzola cheese...added these on the last 10 mins of baking...untill bubbly and golden brown i love a crispy crust... so i made it quite thin with a little olive oil brushed on and precooked it for about 7 mins., before adding toppings. all my dinner guests enjoyed it so much .. with a glass of chilled white wine, a lovely baby greens salad with a lemon and greek oregeno, and a touch of stone ground mustard vingrette. it was a huge hit,the quests raved about the combination of a blue cheese pears and the caremelized onions it all work together beuatifully, and complimated each ingredient i was asked for the recipe... by 8 of my 10 guests
