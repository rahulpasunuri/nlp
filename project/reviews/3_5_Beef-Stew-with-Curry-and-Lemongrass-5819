This is so much better than a regular beef stew. I never use the lemongrass beuase I'm always making this recipe on the fly and never have lemongrass on-hand. Serve over rice or add barley to the stew for a hearty meal. Love this recipe.

Followed recipe with addition of 3T very fresh curry powder from a local spice store. Served over egg noodles. Very tasty and very easy,

I made this nearly as written. Added a dusting of flour to the meat before browning with the hope of thickening the stew. Also, I used about half the amount of meat called for and used sliced porttobellos instead of button mushrooms. Also, my huge chunks of potato may have contributed to the soupyness. It came out a bit loose, but that was my husband's opinion. Anyways, I thought the curry was fragrant and subtle and delicious. I did throw in 2 leaves from my allspice tree since I have been wanting to use them for something. They added fragrance, but I am not sure how much flavor. Salt was needed at the table. Hubby enjoyed, even though it was too soupy for him. I served with steamed rice and garlicked and sauteed kale. Will make again with a bit less broth.

With some modifications, this was wonderful. I upped the curry to 3 T. as suggested, and left out the carrots and potatoes. I used portobello mushrooms in place of button, and I added them early on, shortly after the onions. I also ended up adding an extra cup of water, because the soup seemed a little too thick. Served it with brown rice. A very do-able weeknight meal that I'd also be very proud to serve at a dinner party. 4 forks.

Very tasty & easy. We used the 5 spice instead of curry powder, took the beef out after 1 hour, thickened with a beurre manie (2TBS soft butter & flour) and squeezed lime on the dish, and served with boiled new potatoes w/ butter & parsley. Deelish! The tomatoes & mushrooms soak up the flavor. We can't imagine it w/o the 5 spice, you can literally drink that sauce! We are always looking for beef recipes bc we love beef. We're making this one again!

I followed the recipe faithfully. The meat turned up tender and the consistency of the sauce was just right. But, it wasn't tasty. Not at all. As dull as dirt.

I read all of the review before making this. I made 3 adjustments: 3 tables spoons of Curry (still could use more), no lemongrass (none on-hand) and I used canned beef broth (College Inn). It was very tasty! Served it over jasmine rice. I did thicken it with corn starch. We really enjoyed it and will definitely make this again.

Yum! one of the best beef stews I've ever had - and certainly the best I've made. Very easy and delicious. It was very much a "what we had on hand" meal - no carrots, only chicken stock, no mushrooms. It didn't matter - we loved it!

I thought this was fabulous! I followed the recipe exactly, cooked it in a pressure pot for the first stage and that seemed to really make the beef tender.With steamed rice it was delicious!

This is the best stew I have ever had and everyone at the table said the same thing. I followed the recipe with the only substitution was that I used lemongrass in a tube that I purchased because the fresh lemongrass was dried out. I found it in the produce section. I used between 2/3 to 3/4 of the tube. Although the whole recipe took 2 hours the prep time was only about 20 minutes. Great for busy moms. We served it with bread.

thought this was pretty ho-hum. The sauce lacked something, needed a little richness. There was lots of curry and strong flavor, just needed a little something to smooth it out a bit. It was ok for variety but not a keeper for my family.

It's the day after and the stew is just O.K. at best. Edible, but nothing special. I think that using the original curry, instead of the 5 spice might have been better. Good luck.

Was expecting much better based on the reviews. Cooked today to serve tomorrow as I usually do with stews. Used beef broth instead of bouillion. Browned beef in main pot, and sauteed onion, and garlic in another, then combined with tomatoes, 5 spice, bay leaves, and lemongrass which I cut into 3" lengths and pounded flat with the side of my knife. Taste tested the sauce after simmering the meat until tender. The most prominent taste was the sour from the lemongrass, but the 5 spice was barely detectable so I added 1T. more. After the veggies were added, and the cooking complete, I was disappointed with the final product. I'm thinking that I should have used the curry powder instead of the recommended 5 spice. I'm hoping that it will improve after resting for a day. Not likely to repeat this recipe.

Excellent taste. I, too, added the Chinese five-spice powder. After browing the meat (seasoned with salt/pepper/flour), I put it in a PRESSURE COOKER. I then proceeded with the recipe, substituting 1 32-oz can of Beef broth and 1 cup of water. I added sauce to pressure cooker and cooked the stew for 12 minutes. Perfect! I then thickened with 1 Tbsp. cornstarch. Served over egg noodles. Great weeknight dinner.

Very tasty! I did use the previous reviewer's suggestions to use Chinese 5 spice powder (was out of curry powder). Great flavor (used about 1 tablespoon). I also used shiitakes instead of button mushrooms and proceeed to tie up the mushroom stems, lemongrass, and bay leaves in cheesecloth. Great flavor enhancement without having to worry about tough pieces of lemongrass. Oh, and I used canned beef broth instead of bouillion (it's usually higher quality -- at least to me). The stew didn't thicken up, however, all that well with the potatoes. I will probably omit them and just thicken with cornstarch slurry next time.

This is a very close but incorrect version of Bo Kho, or simmered Vietnamese beef stew. The potatoes are superfluous. Most importantly, Vietnamese people don't use curry powder; we use Chinese five-spice powder. Try it, it's excellent. Also, squeeze fresh lime or lemon juice on top of each bowl before serving.

On the subject of curry powder- it really depends on what type you're using. I used 1.5 Tbsp of a hot Madras curry powder and it was a little intense. I would Have preferred something a little more subtle.

Delicious! Make sure you use a strong curry, I used a thai curry. Pounding the lemongrass brings out more of its flavor. Excellent dish. Perfect for the cold weather!

I used beef shank and halved the amount called for , increased all vegetables to make up for that, it was great. The key with lemongrass is NOT to chop it, but smashed/bruised in removable lengths when you are done cooking, as the other reviewers said.

Rating: 3
This was simple and delicious. I think the curry is supposed to be subtle in this recipe, 3 tbspns is enough. For those having trouble with lemongrass, I suggest you bruise it with a knife along its length, then cut it into large pieces and remove before eating.

This is good - not overwhelming.

Extra curry; about 4 tablespoons is a must. Next time I may be cutting the tomatoes in half or using whipping cream. Definately needs some work.

this was great! i incorporated many of the other reviewers' suggestions. i used lots of curry. i added a teaspoon of cinnamon and a 1/4 teaspoon of allspice. i added a cup of frozen peas at the end. to avoid hard bits of lemongrass, i chopped it very fine and sauted it with the onions and garlic for 2-3 minutes before adding the other ingredients. my kids hated this dish-thats a good sign.

I was initially horrified at the overwhelming taste of bouillon but after 2 hours of simmering I was truly amazed with the final product. Here are my alterations which worked very well -- use boned chuck roast and throw the bones in with the stew, double the garlic, use about 5 Tbsp curry powder (depending on intensity of curry powder being used), add fresh ground black pepper, add 3 sticks celery cut into 1-inch pieces with beef during first simmer, during last 15 minutes of cooking add 1 cup frozen peas and carrots. I skipped the potatoes, large carrots, lemongrass and parsley and made the stew more like a soup. A must try for a satisfying heart warming meal.

Definitely need to add lots more curry than recipe describes. I also added a bunch of cinnamon and allspice which made it taste yummy! Hard to get the lemongrass to work so I just threw it in and took it out before serving. This stew might work better with lamb rather than beef.

I have made this stew more times than I can count, my husband loves it. I always add more curry than called for. As for the lemongrass, try using a grater instead of chopping it, then you wont have those rather unpleasant hard bits. This recipe is a keeper!

I made this with venison instead of beef, and it was excellent. Like with tougher cuts of beef, it is a good way to tenderize and flavorize. I substituted 2 1/2 pounds of venison, and used a bit more oil since the venison is drier. I also added 2 cups of instant brown/wild rice in the last 5 minutes of cooking to make a thicker stew. This recipe, with the spices, is a very nice alternative to the traditional beef stew. The curry is very subtle, it can be smelled more than tasted.

I would not make this stew again as we could not force ourselves to eat it more than once. I expected more given the rave reviews.

Very nice balance of flavors. The Curry can't be identifed in the dish, but adds a nice depth to the flavor. This is now my standard beef stew recipe.

Rating: 4
To save time and effort I toss all the ingrdients excluding the water into my clay pot and cook for 2 hours at 425. I also use a cheaper cut of beef. I cut the lemon grass into 4" pieces, slitting the bottom so I can remove it before serving. I use at least 5 pieces from my garden.

Stew was okay, good, but not great. It is rather time-consuming, so I wouldn't necessarily make it again just because I don't feel the results justified the time it took to cook. I also agree with another reviewer that the lemongrass probably wasn't necessary. It was a pain to chop, and the little bits were, IMO, unpleasant to bite into. If I knew it would be like that, I would've tried tying them in a small muslin bag so the pieces don't float all over the place. I did use a fairly cheap cut of beef and it turned out nice and tender, the best part of the entire dish. I couldn't taste the curry in the final product.

WONDERFUL!!! This is a fabulous stew recipe. As another noted the curry gently blends too add a nice touch. It is not overwhelming; one may not even be able to correctly identify it's inclusion. The cooking time is long, but the prep work is easy. Fancy stew that could comfortably be served to guests.

Rating: 3
very time consuming (what stew isn't), but worth the time. The Lemon Grass is not really neccessary.

I live in Fl. I am used to the large lemongrass found in CA. I wouldlike to find that here. Any Ideas?

An excellent stew, in the truest sense: all the seasonings blend together in the final dish. The curry powder, for instance, just adds to the overall flavor. There is no classic curry dish taste to it. Also, the long simmering time made the meat very tender. I served it over rice.
