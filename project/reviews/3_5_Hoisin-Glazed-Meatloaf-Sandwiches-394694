The meatloaf was very moist and tasty - we've tried a couple of other recipes since, but the asian flavors here are subtle and delicious. I loved the glaze. This is going to be our go-to meatloaf recipe in the future...

This is a lot of work but worth it. I made this for guests staying at our house and they adored it. Make it as stated with the salad on top....it's a great presentation and the flavors are fantastic!!

We found this to be way too salty without the garnish (which I basically just forgot to buy ingredients for). We didn't even use stock, so that wasn't it, and made our own hoisin, so that also wasn't it. We did use all pork (locally raised free range) and that made it taste way more like banh mi than meatloaf. Anyway we prefer the banh mi sandwich recipe elsewhere on this site, and I'd say don't add the salt.

OH and I used ground chicken, I always use ground chicken, you must add more bread crumbs due to chicken's wetness, but still very good :)

The meatloaf was delicious! But the glaze needs some help, I'm going to play around with it, I'll comment again if I figure it out, good recipe though!

I'd do everything as written, but I would use the loaf pan only as a mold. I suggest that you fill the pan up to the edge, making sure any air bubbles are filled and the top is level and smooth. Flip the pan onto the foil-lined rimmed baking pan and let the meatloaf slip out (absent a non-stick pan, parchment paper lining might be prudent), and proceed. This way, instead of just the top, you will have five out of six sides to crisp up and accommodate whatever end-of-baking glaze captures your imagination.

This was a lot of work. It was tasty, but it was still essentially meatloaf. On the plus side, the leftovers lasted for several meals.

My husband made this the other night; we ate it as a meatloaf, not as sandwiches. I think it's safe to say it was the best meatloaf either of us have ever had...love, love, loved it! The leftovers were great too, and I imagine it would make a terrific sandwich, but we were too impatient!
