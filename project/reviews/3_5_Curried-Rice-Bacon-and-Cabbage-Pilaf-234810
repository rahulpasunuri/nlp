I have made this as a side dish many times, served with jamaican jerk chicken. Our friends love it!

I enjoyed this very much and will make it again with a few changes. I added roasted chicken to serve as a main meal. Also, the flavor was nice, but I think it would remain just as tasty with half the butter. I didn't cook the rice quite as long as I should have (I substituted brown rice which was perhaps the problem, although I would use brown rice again) and would watch the cooking time a bit closer next time. Overall, really tasty!

Just made this this evening for my husband and he scoffed the lot. I did leave out the bacon, and subbed olive oil for butter for health reasons. The rest I followed but I cooked it all in a large non-stick skillet. Excellent!

Great crowd pleaser, try adding plump white raisins. And using whole grains like brown rice, quinoa, and farrro.

A nice side dish, nothing extraordinary but will probably combine well with something else.

This is a great rice recipe. It is easy to make and has great texture and flavor. My daughter can't have any dairy products so I used olive oil instead, and couldn't resist adding extra cabbage. Wonderful! I'll make it again.

I can't believe how flavorful this dish tastes although the only seasoning used is curry and a little salt and pepper. I followed this recipe as written except used campari tomatoes instead of plum. The recipe was fairly easy to make and can be easily converted to a main dish by adding chicken. Everyone enjoyed and thought it tasted great except the kids complained that it was a tad too spicy.

This surprised me. I really couldn't imagine this combination flavors, but I had all the ingredients (and especially a lot of cabbage) and so tried it anyway since the reviews were good. It was great! I made it exactly as written, except for halving the butter. And we ate it on its own, as a main dish. My husband not only liked it but said enthusiastically that we should make it again (that's rare!). All the flavors blended really well.

This was tasty but not the best thing I have ever had. There is no need for so much butter in this dish, especially when you are using the bacon fat. I would also recommend using some more tomatoes, cooking the cabbage a little less and making sure to slightly brown the onions, garlic and ginger (and make sure they are chopped very fine). Also, since I use a gas stove, the temp was a little high for the rice and it stuck quite a bit to the pan and was tough to get out. I actually added the veggies to the rice and cooked them a little longer (2 minutes or so) to get the rice and curry mixture to come off the bottom. All in all, this is a good side-dish but nothing to write home about.

Very easy. I only included 3-4 T of butter and found it to taste pretty buttery. The bacon added enough oil for my tastes (I did use a nonstick pan). I made this as a main dish and multiplied the last three ingredients x2. It was a spectacular!

Very nice side dish. Tons of flavor. I could eat this as a main course. I would add more cabbage next time. I sprinkled the bacon on top just before serving. A definite keeper.

I added a ton more ginger, curry and garlic. I used veggie broth--all of the usual epicurious changes. Friends loved this recipe! It is a good any time of year recipe. Cabbage is so great!

Nice rice recipe. A definite change of pace. Curry adds more flavor and the cabbage adds good texture.

I hate when people say, I made so and so but I omitted just about everything so with that I will apologize in advance... I used a lot less butter and I did not use any curry powder because I don't really care for the flavor and this dish was FABULOUS! The flavors of the bacon, the butter, the cabbage, green onions and tomatoes all melded together were wonderful. We used this as a side dish with lemon pepper salmon and a baby spinach salad. YUM!

A wonderful combination of light flavors. I substituated ground pork for the bacon (though I still used bacon fat) and we had it as our main dish. Quite tasty.

Used all listed ingredients but not in given amounts. Tossed and tasted as I went. Great dinner for one.

I will make this dish again. My 2 year old and my 10 month old along with my husband and I loved it! I was also wondering what to do with the bacon so I just threw it in with the cabbage and tomatoes at the end. So good.

I was looking for a recipe to help me get rid of a lot of cabbage--this was yum. I have never made rice pilaf of any kind before; not sure if it is usually this heavy on the butter. I'll use half the amount next time, and add more cabbage as it was a little sparse in the final dish. The cook didn't say what to do with the fried up bacon-I added it back in to the finished dish. Yum. This is not on your diet. : )
