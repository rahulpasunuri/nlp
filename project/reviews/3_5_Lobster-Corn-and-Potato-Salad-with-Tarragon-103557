Haven't tried the recipe yet but would like to soon. But have the same problem as the previous reviewer. I hate tarragon. What is best replacement?

This recipe looks great except that I happen to hate Tarragon. Does anyone have any suggestions for a substitution?

Use 2 tbsp. tarragon (1 1/2 is too light). The flavors of the dish work very well together (not at all strange) for a light, summer entree salad to do ahead. If you're interested in saving money, use 1 lobster and 1/2 lb of shrimp.

Recipe works very nicely. Would recommend letting it sit overnight to chill and absorb more flavors

My friend made this for our book club meeting and everyone was in heaven. I am NOT a fan of lobster, but absolutely love this and will make it myself (if I can get someone else to deal with the lobsters.)

We trap our own lobsters so I'm always looking for new and interesting ways to prepare it. This is one I will NOT be repeating! Pretty to look at, but strange tasting.

Although both my husband and I thought this was very good, the lobster got lost. Considering the cost of lobster, I will try shrimp next time or serve it as an accompaniment without the seafood. This is a great salad for picnics or tailgating parties. Since there isn't any mayonnaise in it, you wouldn't have to worry about keeping it chilled or leaving it out for an extended period of time.

Had this dish at a friend's house this past weekend. It was delicious to say the least. I would definitely like to try and make this dish myself. It seems very easy. You can even have the supermarket steam your lobsters for you! What's easier!

oh. my. god. This was unbelievably good. It was all I could do not to eat the whole bowl myself. I added more lemon juice and reduced the amount of oil by a tablespoon or two and really couldn't tell. Fresh tarragon is essential. Rather than dumping out the liquid after cooking the corn, we tossed the lobster shells back in and simmered to make stock. Looking forward to nice lobster risotto this fall...

I don't know what the fuss is about either.Maybe those folks over or under cooked the meat and vegetables. I made this for a Superbowl Party. Everybody loved it and they all have asked for the recipe. I doubled all the ingredients, but keep the lobster to 2 lbs. meat to cut costs. I used creole mustard ( the theme of the party was Mardi Gras) and increased the amount of the dressing. ( I like lots of dressing) I also added extra frisee and could have added more potato. I purchased cooked lobster meat, and the fish monger gave me about 8 lobster heads that I used to make stock to cook the potatoes and corn. I added Crab Boil and white wine to stock and lowered the meat into the stock for a few minutes to add flavor, then proceded with the vegetables. We Floridians loved it and will make it again.

Have made this salad several times and it is delicious every time. A wonderful summer meal with a fresh baguette and a bottle of wine. Excellent!

Made this for houseguests from Texas when it first came out last year and have added it to my summertime entertaining recipes, especially when the guests are not from New England. easy to prepare ahead, leaves plenty of time for relaxing with your guests who feel very special indeed!

I made this when the recipe was first published to rave reviews and have made it several times since. Everyone loves it!

I was looking for another recipe and saw this one which reminded me to add it my recipe box.. I made it twice last summer when the June issue came out and it was outstanding. A bit of work..but well worth it and it got rave reviews from everyone. It also looks so pretty in the presentation. All you need it some warm bread and a good glass of white wine and you have an elegant meal. I'll definitely be making it again this summer!

Don't know what the complaints are about--Lobster with Corn and/or Potatoes is classic combo--at least here in New England. This is a bit of work and expensive to make but have made twice and enjoyed thoroughly both times.

Very delicious. A great meal for a warm summer night near the beach.

The dish is bland with an odd (and unpleasing) mix of textures. A waste of $45 worth of lobster and for me an unfortunate choice for a picnic party.

I was disappointed in the outcome of this dish. The preparation was easy, but the flavors did not blend well and did not complement the lobster. We also found the texture of the potatoes to be too dense with the other ingredients. I would recommend trying the lobster salad recipe from Gourmet 1998 with snap peas and mint - it was delicious!
