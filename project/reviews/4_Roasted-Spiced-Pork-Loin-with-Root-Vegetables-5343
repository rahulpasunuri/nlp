Wow, yum!!! I didn't make the veggies with this dish because I was also making this dish (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Braised-Turnip-Greens-with-Turnips-and-Apples-356069), which was a perfect compliment to the pork loin. But I did make the pork loin with the currant sauce and I have to say I just loved the cardamom flavor especially in this pork dish!!! Sooooo good. And the sauce is fantastic too. I will definitely make this again.

Delicious! Subbed apple juice for white wine, and cranberry sauce for red currant jelly. Definitely worth making this one!!

Outstanding! My DH, who is *not* a pork fan, said this should be THE house pork roast recipe. Halved the recipe, skipped the cardamom (didn't have it) and the beets (neither of us care for them), but otherwise followed as written.

Absolutely delicious! Everyone rqaved. It's an easy make-ahead recipe--nerly all done the day before. The sauce was slightly sweet and savory and moistened the pork nicely. I omitted the beets and did not miss them. Will make this again.

This was excellent. My only comments are 1...Why would you discard the bacon fat?? I poured it over the pork tenderloin and veggies. And 2...Why would you strain out the bacon bits from the sauce?? I did not strain my sauce.

Made this tonight and it was excellent. I used ground spices rather than seeds (because it's what I had) but used 1 tsp ground cumin and 1/2 tsp. ground cardamom, 1/2 tsp. black pepper and it worked fine. Like many reviewers, I did not have red currant jelly, but I used about 1/2 cup of apricot jelly and threw in 1c of currants. These easily strained out at the end, but added full flavor and were a nice surprise addition to the plate, adding texture and flavor to the sauce/pork combination. I cooked the vegetables for 30 minutes (based on another review) and the pork for 50 min. The pork was perfectly cooked and tender, while the vegetables (though fine) could have used about another 5-10 minutes, which is consistent with the original recipe. Had trouble getting the sauce to thicken, but next time will add corn starch. Will definitely make again.

Very Very good! The sauce was fantastic, followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing. Don't understand what the problem some others had. I had a 4.5 lb loin and set it in with the vegs after they roasted about 30 minutes, but then only did the pork about 40 minutes. 1 hour is too long - hate dry pork. Maybe I'm reading the recipe wrong, but is it a total of 1 hour 45 minutes on all the veg? that also seemed too long. This said, it was delicious and my husband and dinner guest are still talking about this dish 2 days later! will definitely make again and will watch the time on the veggies and pork. Giving 3 forks for the somewhat confusing instructions.

I have to agree that the sauce makes the dish. I have no idea how another reader tried the sauce and hated it, because when i tasted it and my 12 other guests, we were in rapture. The other cook must not have made it correctly. It took time, BUT well worth it. The meat was also well spiced and tender.

Was a huge hit! Sweet potatoes were brought as a side dish and were delicious, so I did not put russets in, however I did add turnips. The rub on the pork was tremendous! The only advantage to baking the beets separately is that they don't turn the rest of the veggies and pork bright red. It's a colorful enough dish as it is!

This dish is all about the sauce, so reviewers who skipped it didn't make this recipe in any way. It took me over an hour to reduce the sauce because I was afraid of burning it, but next time I will start out with a much higher flame. I used a combination of what I had in the fridge - blackberry & red cherry preserves. It was really delicious. My roasting pan isn't that big so I had to roast the pork partly on top of the veggies, and it worked out nicely - they were moist and delicious, though the beets could have used 10 more minutes. I put the beets in with the pork, I don't see why you would have to separate them and clean up yet another pan. I served this with a spinach grapefruit salad.

I made this for dinner last night. My roast was only two pounds, but I didn't halve any of the other ingredients except for those in the sauce and I cooked the roast for the same length of time. I used sweet potatoes instead of russet because I had them and used yellow onions instead of shallots because I forgot to buy them at the store. I also used blackberry jelly instead of red currant. I think the sweetness of the blackberry holds up to the smokey bacon better. The results were delicious. I was relieved that I couldn't fit all the veggies on the serving platter because I could snack on them right out of the roasting pan while I was waiting for a late guest to arrive. I followed another reviewer's lead and made collard greens, deviating from my standard method and using the greens recipe from the vegan soul food cookbook on this site. Marvelous. Dinner was a silent affair as no one had time to talk between bites. Next time I might sear the roast before roasting it and cook it for a little less time.

I liked nothing about this recipe. Pork was not notable. Vegetables did not cook in over 2 hours in 400 degree oven. Parsnips inedible. And I DID cut them into the sizes recommended.

Delicious Christmas dinner showstopper. I substituted one large leek for the scallions. It's helpful to be able to do so much preparation ahead of time . . . makes the holiday event that much easier. I only wished I had cooked more root vegetables -- they were so delectable.

Rating: 4
This is an easy, ordinary recipe that everyone will love! you can substitute sweet potatoes for regular ones. The sauce I substituted mango chutney because I didn't have currant jelly and wa la! The bacon as others have said is not needed. The pork really does need to marinate for that long. Do not leave out the cumin or the cardamom--it's what makes the recipe pop. a crowd pleaser served with collard greens.

Rating: 3
This combination of spices always works well with pork. And a version of Cumberland sauce works as well. The veg are just roasted veg and nothing special, however. I don't really understand the need for the bacon in the sauce but I think this is a recipe that would be fine with lots of tweaking in any direction.

Not a fan. The roast was ok. THe veggies were fantastic. The sauce. Well, my husband tasted it off a spoon and ran to the sink to wash his mouth out.

We skipped the root veg but made the sauce & pork. I was very disappointed in the sauce & poured it down the drain. Instead I served the pork loin with a sauteed apple/star anise topping also on this site. The spiced rub for the pork was interesting, but I wouldn't bother with this recipe again.

I could not quite understand what all the other reviewers were raving about. The meal was just slightly above bland. It was definitely too much work for such a mediocre result. My advice is not to bother with this one as it is really nothing to write home about.

I added 1 cup chicken broth to the vegetables to keep them moist. I also cut about 1/2 inch off the end of the roast to cook up with the sauce and I used honey instead of black currant jelly. I put the sauce in a blender and pureed it. This recipe is great because there is no last minute fuss.

Rating: 4
The best complement of sweet and savoury I've tried in long time! The sauce itself seemed a liitle salty - used oxo - but cut with the carmalized veggies - cooked them slow, before the meat with lotsa evoo and served with a side of red current jam - heaven. One more thing - subbed fennel for potato and beets for lighter lo-carb and easier time cooking and cleaning. This baby is a keeper! Also a dish this simple is probably as good as the ingredients - organic veg , and wine - go gewertraminer or muscat - you use. Pork out!

I found this recipe very tasty and easy to prepare. I will reduce the amount of currant jelly to 1/3c or 1/4c as, to my taste, it was too sweet. I will also next time cook the pork and vegetables simultaneously as I found that I needed to remove the vegetables before the pork was done to save them from becoming complete mush. Oh, one last thing, I bunged the beets in with the rest of the vegetables - why not?

Rating: 4
I made this for company last night. It was really quite good. I replaced half of the white potatoes with sweet potatoes. The sweet potatoes do not need as long as the other root vegetables to cook, so they were softer than I would have preferred. Perhaps separating them out like the beets would be the solution to that problem. The sauce really isn't necessary. I made it but forgot to serve it to our guests, and I don't think we missed anything. I served it with a green salad, but even that was superfluous. The pork and root vegetables stand beautifully on their own.

Rating: 4
Loved it! Easy prep, low stress and loaded with flavor. I added some allspice and clove to the spice rub and used a pear-blackberry preserve instead of the currant jelly in the sauce (which is a real pain to find even in a gourmet market) and cooked it to an internal temp of 160 instead of 150. All 8 seriously finicky foodies loved it.

My sister-in-law made this dish for a family gathering and I asked for the recipe. Shouldn't have been surprised that it came from epicurious.com. It was wonderful. She made it with turnips instead of the parsnips and didn't use beets. I'm going to use this recipe next week when friends and family come to visit. I loved the sauce.

Smells great as guests arrive, presents well on a large platter, and tastes delicious. Consider adding sweet potatoes. Sauce adds more work than it's worth. I doubled the recipe, which works fine, if you have an extra large roasting pan.

This is quite possibly the most delicious, visually beautiful meal I have ever made. It was a big hit at a recent dinner party. The frangrance of rosemary and spices that greeted my guests was intoxicating. It is not difficult to make and is a complete meal as it includes meat, copious vegetables and potatoes. I served only crusty bread and wine alongside it. Even a green salad would have been overkill. The pork was moist and tender, the vegetables are colorful as well as tasty. I sliced the roast about 1/2 inches thick and served it on a very large platter amidst the vegetables, everyone helped themselves. When I make it again I will spray the roasting pans with veg spray to avoid sticking, but other than that I wouldn't do anything differently. A pino blanc worked well with it.

Pork is to be eaten for good luck on New Years Day. Yesterday I made smoked pork chops with sauerkraut and followed up with the pork roast today. I used a 2 lb. roast since it's just my wife and I now. I used the full dry rub however and I'm glad I did. I coated the roast and let it marinate for about 7 hrs. I used 1/2 the vegatables and 1/2 the sauce and was a little reluctant to roast the vegatables for the full 1 3/4 hrs., but they were perfect. I have a good quality electronic thermometer from Williams-Sonoma that I used to monitor the temp. of the meat. I removed it at 150F internal temp. and after a 15 minute rest it was perfect. Any more and it would have been overdone. This recipe is outstanding and my wife was absolutely delighted.

Excellent! I did not have currents preserves on hand and used rasperry and am so pleased. I do not think the sauce is too sweet. Just right. I used a very dry white wine and alittle extra bacon and rosemary in the sauce and generous with the salt and pepper. I did not have enough potatoes so added in sweet potatoes. Very nice. Did not use rutabegas. Also, the whole house smelled wonderful and warm on this January night!

The roast and vegetables are delicious. The spice rub on the pork really made something special. The sauce was too sweet for me. Next time, I'll make it without the sauce.

This dish was very, very good! I doubled the rub because I used a roast a little over 5 lbs. which came out beautifully even though I cooked it a little longer than suggested--internal temperature 175. I was pleasantly surprised by the parsnips--a nice addition; but would not go out of my way for the beets. Even though I like beets most ways, these were a little bland. I will make this again even with and without the vegetables.

Rating: 3
The spice rub was excellent. This recipe alerted me to the fact my oven temperature may be off. The roast cooked way too fast and and the vegetables were caramalized perfectly in the first hour. (2 hours?!?-has anyone really roasted them for 2 hours?) The vegetables were so good I have made them several times since. And the parsnips-who knew!!

I just tried this recipe out yesterday in hopes it would work out for christmas. It was a resounding 'yes!' This was such a delicious recipe. Regarding the potatoes, I used only two russets and the rest sweet potatoes. I made the sauce a day in advance and the spice rub a day in advance. Simple, simple! I plan on having a cherry-cranberry chutney on the side with peas in a creamsauce. Just finished up some leftovers for lunch too. All the coworkers wanted to know where I got the recipe.

Was expecting great things judging from the reviews but results were mediocre. Initially was intrigued by the pairing of cumin and cardamom in the spice rub but in the final product the taste was a mis-match. There is however a great recipe for a pork roast (boston butt, or shoulder) under Six-hour Pork Roast.

Until now, I've been a lurker on the Epicurious board, but I signed up to weigh in on this outstanding recipe. Everyone raved. I also vote yes on the parsnips - they were my favorites. Everything else stays, though the bacon's necessity is questionable. Sweet potatoes were also a big hit. In a word, wow!

Made this for a special man in my life - never tried before - did it in 2-1/2 hours after work and got raves from everyone. Needs more of the spices, needs to cook longer, but is fabulous - and the aromas you meet coming through the front door are worth the effort!

This recipe is fairly easy and the taste was great. The vegetables carmelized making them really sweet and cripy. And the sauce was delicious! I did not have all the ingredients on hand so I used a onion instead of the shallots. This is definitely a keeper and plan to make it again - soon! Only recommendation is to keep the pork roast until it reads 160 on the thermometer - 150 is just a little too pink.

This pork loin was juicy and tender at the end of its cooking time. The vegetables were absolutely FANTASTIC, well cooked without being too soft. THe presentation was beautiful with the roast and veggies spread around it. I got rave reviews on this one!

The spice rub was good, and the vegetables were delicious, but we didn't care for the sauce. I thought it was too sweet; next time I'll just add a little water or broth after it's cooked to scrape up the pan drippings and use that as the sauce.

I have made this recipe many times and am requested to do it again and again. I use small pork tenderloins and tend to double the reduction (watch the amount of pepper). I don't always do the root veggies as it is always the pork and sauce that are a hit. I served it with a baked polenta once...fabulous!

The highlight of this dish for me were the vegetables, which were fabulous. In fact, my guests finished them before I could have seconds! The pork was good although not as tender as I would have liked. The sauce tasted great but was very thin and took much longer than 35 minutes to cook down. Next time I will add a little corn starch.

This is excellent. I used red onions instead of shallots and they carmalized and tasted wonderful. My husband usually does the cooking, but I made this and he said he was never cooking again. I thought the sauce was perfect as is, it didn't need thickening. The Beets are a must!

This was a huge hit -- especially the sauce. I cooked the pork a little slower for fear of it being dry. Also added a little flour to the sauce so I could end up with a little more. I didn't do the beets & no one seemed to miss them.Definitely will make it again.

This recipe was perfect for our holiday dinner! The pork was so tender, we cut it with our fork, and the rub added an almost-sweet indian style flavor. The sauce was sooo delicious and went with everything I made. It was rich, sweet and buttery, almost like carmel or butterscotch. I used different veggies (sweet potatoes, parsnips, carrots, fennel, turnips, shallots, garlic), and they were perfect with the dish. This is going to become a new holiday tradition.

I served this entree as the start up to our gourmat club. I have been asked for the recipe by most of them. The spice rub is awesome! Make sure to use low salt BROTH for the sauce as the recipe states - I initially used OXO and it was way too salty!

The aromatic spice rub for this dish is incredible, especially if you can get really fresh cardamom pods. The first time I made it, I had to stop myself from eating the whole thing in one sitting! The sauce was okay -- could use some tinkering to make it more worthy of the roast. I skipped the sauce the second time I made this and didn't miss it a bit.

A wonderful winter dish, just right to serve when the snow is falling, the temperature is plummeting and you need to take your mind off the elements! Very tasty. All it needs is a salad, good bread, and a light red wine.
