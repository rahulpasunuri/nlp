This is fabulous mousse. We followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly with no hitches of any kind. Worth using the best chocolate available. And I think it would not be the same (or as good) without roasting the nuts. I recommend machining the nuts to a completely grainless state if you want a trully smooth mousse. And it's perfect with the whipped cream. Also note that there is relatively little sugar in the recipe, and we found that a little extra jolt of sugar in the whipped cream fits nicely. We also found that the flavor of the roasted hazelnuts comes through better when the mousse is at room temperature. I definitely plan to make this again.

a super yummy but intensive recipe to make, I doubled the recipe for a dinner party and it worked out very well, the flavour is very rich, i accompanied this with fresh strawberries and a chilled bottle of Veuve Cliquot, fabulous!

This is a very good mousse. I have made it many times for a variety of guests and all have enjoyed it. Grind the nuts very fine and be sure to follow the preparation steps very closely, missing the correct temperature or consistency will give poor results.

It wasn't terrible, but was not worth the trouble. If you try it, make sure to grind your hazelnuts until they form a smooth paste or you will end up with chocolate mousse with gritty, ground nuts in it.

I made this just for fun and was amazed at how rich it is. I would make sure to grind the hazelnuts very finely or you get grit. All in all it's a great dessert for fall.
