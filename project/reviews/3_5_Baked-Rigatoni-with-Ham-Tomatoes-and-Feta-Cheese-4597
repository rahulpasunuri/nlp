This was easy to make. We had some ham left over at our home. Wanted to do something wiht it and found this recipe. I did add some fresh thyme, oregano & basil.

Rating: 0
well as the dish is still cooking the results on taste are still TBD. However, I'm feeling like an ametuer because I used uncooked ham. Now I'm reading all the reviews about how people used leftover ham. IMO, I think the recipe should be more specific when it comes to that. Leftovers, were not the first thing that came to mind when reading this recipe.

Very good weekday dish. I needed more cream, and feta cheese to make sure the dish wasn't too dry and also added a small dash of crushed red pepper for spice. My meat-aterian boyfriend loved this dish and we put it in the "save" recipe box.

I was looking through my old Bon Appetit Magazines which I have kept and decided to try this one. This was just great. My husband and I just loved it. I made the recipe as called for, which serves 6, and with just the two of us, we had leftovers that we enjoyed the following day. Definitely would make again. This is a recipe that can easily be adapted for other meats, such as cooked chicken, turkey, or sausage which I will definitely try. Wished I had tried it 10 years ago.

Made as directed except used a full lb of pasta, italian seasoning instead of thyme and a more than healthy dash of crushed red pepper.Turned out delicious-I just wanted to have more. Next time I will add more tomatoes & a little more cheese but its delicious as is

This is delicious and easy as can be. We make it every year for Christmas Eve and never long for anything more elaborate.

For what this is-- essentially an adult version of mac and cheese--it was surprisingly good. It is also a very flexible recipe. I used penne, a 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes with basil, oregano and garlic, and 1 c. of fat free half and half in place of the cream. The FF 1/2 and 1/2 clumped a little, as it will do if heated too long, but it was not noticeable and definitely helped to cut the calories of this dish. I also followed the advice of another reviewer and used a 1/2 t. each of thyme, oregano and basil. A nice touch. I prepared this dish in a hurry and did not read the directions all the way through so the result was that the dish baked for 30 minutes uncovered. A serendipitous deviation from the recipe, however, since I liked the crispy noodles and so did my boyfriend. A good weeknight dish.

I was desparate for something new but didn't have time to get by the market....sooo...I used a packet of serrano ham, a jar of spicy spaghetti sauce in place of the tomato's and shredded swiss in place of the mozzarella. Backed off the cream by 1/4 cup and we had a great dinner. What a forgiving recipe! What a great dish!

3 1/2 FORKS! I loved this dish because it's so easy, tasty, and kids go for more. Few changes I made: *Barilla Plus penne pasta (cook 10 min) *used 'feta with basil and tomato' *added 1/2 can baby peas *used whole milk instead of cream *took foil off for last 5 minutes to get some crispy penne's (I love that) If you enjoy pasta like I do, be careful..you'll want to go for thirds.

Excellent and easy here where grocery shopping is a challenge-used penne pasta, deli ham, a 2-cup package of "pizza cheese", 2 cans of chopped tomatoes that included mushrooms & garlic in the can. Great taste!

Rating: 3
Tasty-- a good weeknight meal. My 3 year old who usually only likes plain pasta had seconds of this. I did the following modifications: *1 lb pasta (penne or rigatoni is fine) *2 cups ham *1 1/2 c whole milk instead of cream *about 24 oz chopped tomatoes plus about 1/4 c of the juice *about 3/4 to 1 cup peas *do 1/2 c parmesan and 1/2 c mozz instead of all mozz *1/2 tsp EACH thyme, oregano, basil (instead of all thyme) *1/2 c fresh parsley *sauteed mushrooms would also be good, but adds extra work. To me, the baking time and method seemed as if it would yield a really mushy pasta. I undercooked the pasta by about 3 min. Rinse with cold water to stop cooking. Just bake uncovered in 400 oven until bubbly, about 20-25 min., stirring occasionally.

Great,easy weekday meal using leftover Easter ham. Used diced canned tomatoes w/ basil garlic flavor, herbed goat cheese and skipped the thyme. Added a little grated Romano at the end. Everyone loved it.

This is great for quick and easy. I add sauteed mushrooms and spinach - fresh or frozen. If fresh, wilt with mushrooms. Used whole mild for the cream. Used more of the cheese. Quite tasty!

I LOVE this recipe for holiday parties! My only change is that I use fresh rosemary instead of thyme. I've also omitted the ham and put in extra tomatoes when I've served it to non-meat eating friends. :)

This is wonderfully different from the usual pasta and ground beef. I've used leftover baked ham, leftover country ham (for a stronger flavor) and even deli ham. I've used can tomatoes, too, in a pinch. The whole family loved it.

Do yourself a favor and make this recipe exactly as written. The aroma is wonderful, and it has a taste to match. This is a "full fat comfort food" that will get rave reviews. And for Heaven's sake do not add canned spinach, as suggested by another reviewer.

Rating: 0
Didn't make this as shown due to variations (some planned, some not), so no 'fork' rating: I sauteed some carrot, celery, onion, and portobello mushroom in butter to boost the veggie content, but couldn't add the cream (oops -- way past expiration date). Instead, I added some flour, cooked it through a couple minutes, and used 1% milk to make the sauce. Also forgot to add the tomatoes at this point (it was hectic in the kitchen), so I took the canned ones I had planned to use based on others' reviews and spooned them over the top. Added a few grates of mozzarella so it didn't look like a mistake. Baked until bubbly, and it was great. Not a company dish, perhaps, but tasty, and for us, a little different.

My husband and I had tons of left-over ham and since I had all of the ingredients for this recipe, I gave it a try but tweaked it just a bit. I first sauteed the diced ham with shallots; I added two cans of drained diced tomatoes as well as cooked, drained spinach for nice color; I also substituted shredded parmesan cheese for the feta since feta doesn't really melt well. One other change was that I used whole milk instead of cream. It was delicious.

We have made this dish for the past 3 years. We love it and it is the perfect dish for young kids. We have a lot of picky eaters in our family and everyone has loved this dish. We always make it whenever we have leftover ham. It makes enough for us to heat it again for a lunch or dinner. My children will often pick out the tomatoes, so sometimes I make it without them.

My family (with small children) LOVE this recipe! It has been a hit with guests, as well. I have had lots of people ask me for the recipe. Usually, I modify recipes to add or omit things, but this one is perfect, as written.

I made this recipe to use up lots of leftover ham. My boyfriend thought it was extremely good and took leftovers for lunch the next day. I substituted Parmesan for the Mozzarella but otherwise followed the recipe as printed. It is easy to make which is always a plus on a weeknight when you are tired and don't want to cook.

NO WAY! ARE YOU SERIOUS? THIS RECIPE WAS NOT RIGHT I THINK THE MEASUREMENTS WERE OFF AND THE WHOLE FETA CHEESE AND MOZZARELLA WAS A BIT MUCH IF YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE THIS RECIPE PICK ONE OR THE OTHER THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT VARIATIONS YOU CAN DO TO MAKE THIS DISH 10 TIMES BETTER TO GET FOUR FORKS IT SHOULD BE CALLED THE VARIATION DISK BECAUSE YOU CANT USE THE ORIGINAL RECIPE YOU HaVe TO ADD OR TAKE AWAY I WAS DEFINITELY NOT IMPRESSED WITH THIS DISH AND IT WAS A REAL BUMMER BECAUSE IT SOUNDED REALLY GOOD I WILL MAKE THIS DISH AGAIN.......THE VARIATION VERSION (HA HA HA)

As baked pasta goes, this was very good, although by no means the best I have ever had. Still, it was simple, and very tasty, and there were no leftovers. I made it to spec, except I added some tiny peas and used fresh thyme. It probably could have used more tomatoes; four plum tomatoes didn't go very far with this much pasta.

Rating: 4
I rated this 4 forks because it truly is a recipe that can be personalized and according to other reviews, with much success! I used grape tomatoes (love their sweetness) and added fresh baby spinach and fresh mushrooms. By adding more ingredients, I used more cheese and half and half (which worked fine). A pretty dish, as well!

Rating: 3
Great recipe. I too used pancetta instead of ham, and added extra cream and mozzarella because it seemed too dry when I stirred it. Next time I think I'll take the suggestions of adding peas or spinach and mushrooms.

Great to use up leftover ham. Also made it with a few changes: used a (pre-packaged) "Mediteranean" mixture of grated cheese; added Parmesan; more ham; increased half & half to 1 1/2 cups; used drained, canned tomatoes; etc.. Will continue to make with changes.

I've made this dish many times and it's a hit with everyone. I love the fresh thyme and use three three different sorts directly from my garden.

One of my families favorite recipies - I take to other peoples homes and they have all loved it. A few adjustments - I buy pre cooked and diced ham and double the amount, extra tomatoes, use feta with sun dried tomatos and basil, a little extra whipping cream, Broil a few minutes at end to crisp up

Rating: 4
My husband and I think this dish is wonderful, although, admittedly, I made a few changes... We didn't have ham, so I fried up some pancetta instead. I used parmesan cheese instead of mozzarella and added peas for color. Awesome! I'll make this one again and again.

This is so easy and so delicious! The feta and cream together make a great mild sauce for the ham. I'll definitely make it again and may try adding spinach and/or mushrooms.

My husband and I love this recipe. I've made it many times. The recipe is very easy to adjust: I've successfully been able to use 16 oz pasta instead of 12 oz, and typically I use 1/4 - 1/2 cup of whipping cream instead of 1 cup. You can also take off the foil to cook it faster or make the top crispier.

I wish I could give this recipe THREE and A HALF stars... it was really super good, not awesome, but very good. I wasn't too sure of the flavor combinations, but I trusted the number of rave reviews, and was not dissappointed. I had to substitute the thyme (thought I had some but no) with oregano and I also used 2 cans of chopped tomatoes - and it was GREAT! I imagine with the thyme it has a real "french" flavor to it. A great way to use up leftover ham!

This was a HUGE hit with my family. My husband claims that I have never made anything better. I did use 2 14oz cans of chopped tomatoes with garlic and onion. Instead of baking it (I was short on time), while I cooked the pasta to not quite al dente, I put everything else in a large skillet. Then I drained and added the pasta after rinsing with cool water. Brought the whole thing to a simmer, covered, simmered 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Then I uncovered and added 1 tbsp cornstarch mixed into 1/4 milk to thicken the sauce. I also substituted Land-o-Lakes fat-free half and half for the cream. Total cooking and prep time was about 25 minutes.

First try at any Epicurious recipes. This was a great hit, just happened to be one of those days unexpected company came and they loved it as well. Substituted canned tomatoes as per another reviewer (be sure they are welled drained). Otherwise a great make again recipe.

Wonderful! This was very, very good and quite easy to make. I substituted half-n-half for the whipping cream, and used olive oil spray instead of butter; the dish didn't seem to lose anything. Also didn't use the ham (because it wasn't on hand), but I will next time. I think I may throw some fresh spinach in it next time and add another plum tomato or two.

This was great. We substituted fresh chopped basil and oregano for the Thyme. We also substituted Fontina cheese for the Mozzarella. To round it out a bit, we added two cloves of chopped garlic and sauted them with the tomato prior to adding it to the pasta.

I followed other reviewers suggestions and used two 14 oz cans of diced tomatoes (really well drained). We had a huge amount of left-over ham from Easter too, but unlike the previous reviewer, both my husband & I loved this dish ! OK, its not haute cuisine, but it was tasty, SO easy to throw together, & went well with a crisp green salad & crusty bread. I used a feta cheese flavoured with sun-dried tomatoes & basil & left out the thyme. Definitely a make-again for us.

I should have listened to the little alarm bells that went off in my head when I read the recipe and "tasted" it. I couldn't imagine these ingredients working very well together. However, I went ahead because I had a ton of leftover ham from Easter. Absolutely awful. Worse than the casseroles my mother forced on me in my youth.

This was really good and easy to make. A great recipe for leftover ham! I used 2 14 oz cans of diced tomatoes instead of fresh and added 2 cloves of garlic. I made a mistake and forgot to recover the pasta when baking it so the top was crunchy which added to the flavour. Next time I think I'll up the garlic and add basil and oregano.

A fantastic dish! I too added garlic and substituted canned tomatoes for fresh. Since whipping cream is not a usual staple in my house I used whole milk. Didn't seem to affect the flavor. My husband seemed to like it, called it more than edible which I guess is high acclaim, but my two year old wouldn't touch it. His pasta has to be plain! I will definitely make it again for me if for no one else!

My husband tonight asked me where I got this recipe. I told him the same place I got the ham jambalaya. Wonderful--make it again he said. Next time I will cut the cream way down. There was plenty of moisture without the extra calories. I used the last of a Honey-Baked Ham (brand name) which I made for Christmas; it made this a wonderful dish.

Terrific family pleaser, great way to use up leftover ham. I doubled the recipe and used farfalle pasta, oregano and basil and extra plum tomatoes. It baked in less time than called for, since you only need to heat it up. It fed 10 hearty eaters.

Save your leftover holiday ham for this recipe. It's quick and makes a great weekday meal. I saved time by using diced canned tomatoes. We love tomatoes so I used 2-14oz cans. This is a keeper!!!

This was a great recipe for using left over ham. I also used evaporated skim milk and it worked well. Easy to make and delicious too! Fresh tomatoes made it great.

Three and a half knives and forks. Effort - Reward ratio is near maximum. Baking time is short enough so that the tomatoes hold up beautifully, and leaven the lump, so to speak. Ham is the taste highlight, so I sauteed it softly while the pasta was cooking. Substituted Reggiano Stravecchio for half the mozzarella, figuring it's always good with cream. Bull's eye, even though it's me saying it.Next time I make it, I'll up the tomato quotient.

We were really surprised how well this simple recipe turns out. This is true comfort food. Great when you don't have a lot of time and have many diners. Buying good black forest ham and quality cheeses makes all the difference.
