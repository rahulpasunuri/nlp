We really like this for a fast and meatless meal. Even tastier the next day. I saute chopped onions and green pepper, and use 3 cans of beans, draining 2. I use a mixture of water, red wine, and a bit of v-8 juice instead of the tomato juice. Also use less salt and add ground pepper.

I found this a bit bland but with a few adjustments it makes for a great, quick dinner: I added 1/2 small onion (diced) and 1 tsp coriander when sauteing the garlic and cumin. Then I used 1 cup diced tomatoes instead of juice/water, and added the juice of 1/2 lemon. As suggested by other readers, I just used a sprinkle of salt to adjust flavor at the end. Served with sliced jalapeno, avocado, and sour cream over rice. Delicious!

This is so easy to whip up in 5 minutes. I add lots of fresh, chopped coriander at the end. My kids and husband love this recipe.

This is an easy, healthy favorite to fall back on. I usually add chopped tomatoes and onions for a little more flavor. I highly recommend it as a side for "Potato, Greens, And Goat Cheese Quesadillas".

I served this last night with some simple beef, onion & cilantro tacos and Mexican Rice with Cilantro dressing. Doubled the recipe and substituted cans of Mexican-style diced tomatoes for the water/tomato juice. It was simple and very good.

You can make this with kidney, pinto, or whatever bean is in your pantry. I double the recipe and use a little can of V8 or tomato juice...it is the perfect amount of liquid. Definitely adjust the salt to your taste. Leftovers are great on tortilla chips!

This is an excellent recipe and quick! I used one can of rotel tomatoes with green chiles, with V-8 and chicken broth (1/3 cup each). I added 2 slices of smoked thick bacon cut up, and sazon by goya. These black beans tasted just like the ones that take a day to prepare. Definitely will use this recipe again!!!

Considering this dish took 2 min. to make I gave it 4 forks. I substituted 1 can of Del Monte diced tomatoes with zesty jalapenos instead of the water/tomato juice. EXCELLENT.

This was pretty good. I added some canned tomatoes instead of tomato juice. I agree with Marietta, GA, reduce the salt a bit.

Very good, easy for Mexican meal. I added 1 chopped tomato when sauteeing garlic and cumin; did not add water or tomato juice.

So easy, it's almost ridiculous. It could earn 4 forks for its simplicity alone. Delicious and versatile; this easily could be a side dish or the main course over rice, which is what I (brown rice, tho). I followed the advice of the Tampa cook at doubled it, using a can of diced tomatoes and about a third cup of water, plus only a teaspoon of salt.

This is one of my favorite dishes! I always double the recipe and add a can of diced tomatoes, with the liquid instead of just tomato juice or water. Delicious and healthy!

This is a great recipe to turn black beans into a nice side dish. It turned out a bit salty so I will halve that next time. Also I will add a more liquid as it evaporated quite a bit and left the beans a little dry. Other than that, very good.

I made this dish almost exactly as instructed, with one exception: I used v-8 juice instead of tomato, as it's all I had in the house. I thought it was delicious. I might increase the amount of cilantro next time.

Rating: 4
I tried this recipe and added fresh basil and fresh jalapenos. I cooked the beans in a combination of salsa fresca and ranchero sauce, and it was delicious. To those who don't like comments changing the recipe, don't read them. I enjoy the ability to see what other people have done. After this is cooking, not a biochemistry experiment. Recipes are guidelines only.

I've made this several times-it's easy and very good-tastes like you've spent more time on it than you have! I made the recipe as printed but omitted the salt. I've also made it with V8 and it is good.

Well, to add to the reviews of those that didn't follow the recipe, I didn't have black beans, so I used Pinto Beans. I did follow the recipe but added chopped serrano peppers and tomatos. Served with Tamales and it was awsome.

Our family loves this recipe. I use mint from our garden instead of cilantro. We also use V8 because it was on hand the first time we made it. Wonderful and very adaptable.

I followed the recipe exactly (used tomato juice)and didn't change a thing. Served it with white rice and "Grilled Chicken with tricolor Salsa". Made this meal on Father's Day and everyone loved it. My husband thought the beans were "amazing". Thought I made plenty, but everyone kept getting more beans and before I knew it, it was all gone. It's amazing how simple and fast this recipe is. Definitely try it (serve with white rice). Don't need to change a thing (except add a little bit of water to make it less salty).

Sometimes people really do change the recipe beyond recognition. For a hilarious example see "Cornish Hens with Sweet Vermouth Garlic Glaze." I like to play with recipes that are simple and lend themselves to embellishment or substitutions, and I like to read other cooks' suggestions and add my own to my review if something turned out really well. Creative reviews also help when you don't have all the ingredients called for. This does beg the question whether to rate the recipe as written or as actually prepared! I try to split the difference.

So what's up with cook from the west. I thought the whole point of this website was to share creative ideas. Afriedman's variations were pertinent to the recipe and totally appropriate. I made the recipe with his variations and thought his contributions were very valuable.

Rating: 0
So what's with afriedman? Says he (she?): I love this recipe and make it all the time, then goes on to describe something totally different. Folks, this is a review forum, not your place to tell us all what creative cooks you are. And what could be more creative than opening a can of corn and adding it to a can of beans? I am so impressed, ariedman.

I make this recipe all the time. Drain and rinse the black beans to remove excess salt, add some sauteed onions, substitute hot chunky salsa for tomato juice and water, then throw in a small can of corn five minutes before done. Great over rice, in tortillas with jack cheese with some sour cream and guacomole on top or alone as a fast pick me up or dinner.

I love this dish! It's so easy and makes a perfect companion to fajitas, enchiladas, and quesadillas. I use 3/4 can of diced tomatoes with jalepenos instead of tomato juice or water, and a handful of cilantro. Super easy and super good.

4 forks with revisions. Added one can Ro-Tel diced tomatoes with chilis drained. 1 to 2 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, using about 1 teaspoon of the adobo sauce. At least doubled the cillantro cuz I love cillantro......Awesome recipe. Hope this review doesn't appear twice. My computer locked up on the first try.

With all the great cook that frequent this site it is a rarity to see a review where the recipe has been prepared as written, this is no exception. I had no cilantro and had to use spicy V8 instead of tomato juice...one word, YUM!

Rating: 3
I didn't have cilantro, and didn't have tomato juice (so I used water). I cooked down most of the liquid, but still had a bit when I was done. I added 1/2tsp cayenne pepper as well as some curry powder. I think it could use something to brighten the flavors a bit - perhaps diced tomatoes with juice as others recommended would help.

Rating: 4
This is great with some slight changes. I used a can of diced tomatoes and their juice instead of water or tomato juice. I also added some chipotle chili powder and that's what makes this 4 forks. The second time I made it I forgot the chili powder and it didn't compare.

Rating: 4
It's amazing how deceptively simple this recipe is. I've found the secret is, at least when adding water, is to let the whole thing cook down until the beans absorb the liquid and anything else in the pan is thickened. I've used water and some chopped tomatoes and it's amazing. Goes great with rice, would go well with anything.

Wow! I was just looking for a quick supper and a way to jazz up a can of black beans. I just threw everything in the pot together, adding some tomato paste and diced tomatoes, and it was fantastic!

Took the advice of another reviewer and add chopped tomatoes instead of water. Though sometimes add a bit of water too. Add a bit of chopped red peppers if they're around. Also, add some minced jalapeno. Have topped with shredded cheese which really makes it a rich.

I would make this dish again, but it was really salty...& I love salt. I think I may try it using water instead of tomato juice (or use low-salt tomato juice) - or tone down the salt I added.

Delicious! Easy to make and easy to eat. I feel good about eating this dish because it's healthy and your body needs a break from animal products sometimes too. Instead of tomato juice, I pick a soft tomato from the fridge (there's always one too soft for a salad) and puree it in the mini-chopper. I serve it over brown rice as a main course.

Absolutely delicious -- it was the surprise hit of our taco party. I sauteed a diced red onion and two cloves of garlic in olive oil, then added three drained cans of black beans, one drained can of shoepeg corn, one can of tomato sauce (about 8 oz.), one drained can of diced tomatoes, a healthy dose of cumin, and a full bunch of cilantro (chopped). Seasoned with salt and pepper and let simmer for a bit. Wow, was it good.

This dish rocked! I used tomato juice (even though I don't like tomato juice but it is actually quite good with it). This was a wonderful side dish to Asain Chicken. I would perhaps use a less salt than what is required next time. Overall though, it was a literal taste explosion in my mouth!

Rating: 4
Very tasty dish & easy to prepare. I used 2 fresh tomatoes instead of water. I also added fresh chopped onions(white) & extra cilantro. I cooked 3 dishes from Epicurious last night & this was by far the best one. The other dishes I tried "WHITE BEANS WITH SAGE AND OLIVE OIL" and "roasted vegetable soup with kale & white beans" weren't as good as this one!

A word of advise.. definately use tomato juice/sauce rather than water. I used water first and ended up re-heating them with crushed tomato which at least made them edible (and I love black beans)

I find this recipe very easy to make. I add green onions, and usually just use water (not terribly happy with tomato in this dish). I serve with some shredded Monterey Jack, sour cream, and cilantro. I use it as a side dish to chicken enchiladas and a rice casserole dish (rice, green chilis, sour cream, and Jack)

This was a quick-dish hit. I would double the garlic and cumin, and definitely add a tomato for more flavor. I had it with cheddar cheese, sour cream and salsa -- yum. All in all it's something I'll be making on nights when I want something hot and filling, but can't face cooking too long.

I'm puzzled by the reviewer who said this dish had an unpleasant taste and smell. This has classic mexican flavors and aromas. I followed the suggestions of others and substituted a roma tomato for the water/tomato juice. Next time I'd add 1/2 cup of chopped red onion. An excellent (and easy) side dish, well worth the minimal effort.

These beans are very good and wonderfully easy. I served them over homemade corn tortillas, grated monteray jack cheese and tropical fruit salsa (also on this web site). The results were terrific. As for changes, I chopped up a roma tomato instead of adding water or tomato juice; I also added a sweet yellow pepper for taste, texture and colour. Just one caveat, if the beans you're using already contain salt, taste prepared dish before adding the suggested amount.

This makes a great late night meal and uses items that I normally have on hand. I didn't have any cilantro in the frig, so I added 1 tsp of ground coriander along with the cumin and garlic. I also followed the advice of others and added the tomatoes, green chiles, and a few splashes of tabasco. Couscous makes a great substitution for rice.

Outstanding, far tastier than it sounds. For a little variety I chopped and sauteed a red pepper in the oil before adding the garlic and cumin, replaced the water with tomato sauce, and stirred in a quarter cup of diced red onion just before serving.
