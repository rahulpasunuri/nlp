I've made this tart about eight times so I consider myself an expert;) Here are my tips: 1. peel the apples, it works better 2. pie crust works just as well as puff pastry 3. once you have caramelized the sugar, pour the apple juice and vinegar on top and just let it slowly simmer, don't stir! Stirring creates a big hot mess! Just allow the liquids to dissolve the sugar and all will be well. 4. use the suggested amount of apples, it seems like too many but they really collapse once marinated in the syrup. 5. continue to reduce the liquids (once tart is in the oven) for as long as it takes to create a thick syrup (not quite hot fudge thickness, but almost). It will reduce, just be patient. Enjoy, this is way better than a tart-tartin, less sweet due to the vinegar and rich and flaky - truly delicious!

I made this for our family Thanksgiving & everyone loved it. Slicing the quartered and cored apples in my food processor was fast and easy. I doubled the recipe -- using two sheets of frozen puff pastry -- to make one large tart. I sprinkled crystallized sugar on the crust rim before baking. My caramel sauce never thickened so I simply painted it on as a glaze just before serving. Great presentation and flavor for so little effort.

i haven't even made this yet, just eaten it! i fell in love...my friend told me where to get the recipe and i can't wait to make it. she did peel her apples, and i think i would much prefer it that way. also, she added cinnamon and made just one very large pastry (it was for a get-together). she didn''t bring any whipped cream and it was still absolutely yummy-and gone! (and i LOVE whipped cream, but this didn't even need it-imo.) thanks, bri!

This dish turned out better even than pictured here. I got really good frozen puff pastry dough, which instructed to thaw it slowly in the refrigerator, then at room temp. I believe this made all the difference, because the dough created a miracle puff in the oven. I put the apples etc on each square, and then awkwardly folded up the edges and kind of crunched them together at the top-very unprofessional looking when putting them into the oven. However, once in, the dough which was already bursted with warm yeast action, bloomed around each apple handful. The end result was glorious flowerlike (literally looked almost like lilies!) pastries with lovely tart apple filling. Almost like I knew what I was doing from start to finish! I did try to make the filling with Splenda, and that did NOT work, because the Splenda did not carmelize. Since this is so high calorie anyway, don't use a sugar substitute unless you have to.

These turned out nicely although I was worried about the recipe as I made the caramel. The sugar hardened so much with the addition of the apple juice and vinegar that I thought it would never dissolve again. But it did, after 10 minutes or so and a lot of patience. I tried slicing the apples two ways. I used the regular Cuisinart slicing disc (4mm) for the majority of the apples, and also tried the ultra thin disc (1mm) for the remainder. The problem with the 4mm is that it took nearly 30 or more minutes to soften the apples in the caramel because they were so thick (about 3/16th"). Also they never really softened to the point where I could achieve the curves shown in the photo. The problem with the ultra thin disc was that the apples were so thin, they turned brown almost immediately. However, they softened in a minute or two. So what I did was place the thicker slices at the bottom and mounded the thinner ones, twisted/curved like the photo showed, on top. Also I agree with the other reviewer that 20-22 minutes is enough time in the oven. Not sure I will make this again. I used the Pepperidge Farm puff pastry, but if I make it again, I would use the Dufour brand which is made with real butter.

This really is a winner. Follow the recipe exactly. The crust is light and flakey. I like the look of the big sugar pieces baked on top. Impressive tart.

This recipe was a disappointment. Leaving the peel on the apples made them chewey and unappetizing. The Gala apples held their shape, but had little flavor. Rolling the puff pastry compressed it so much, that it did not puff up, and remained tough. I'm throwing this recipe away.

This was absolutely amazing. I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted Apple Jack Brandy (Calvados was very pricey) and it was just fine. I also served them warm with cinnamon ice cream from Oberweis. The only thing I'd do differently next time is to quarter the apples and then slice them thinly from there; I think the apple slices would be easier to arrange in a more artistic manner. My guests raved about them!

Bellissimo! Easy and just delish. Did not have Calvados, used Pear brandy and it was lovely. Served warm with a dollop of vanilla bean ice cream. Can't imagine it being any better with whipping cream...

This turned out deliciously! My second attempt was even better because I buttered the pastry and sprinkled quite a lot of unrefined sugar. We had them for breakfast and used Cox apples.

We were very pleased with this - a perfect, light dessert for four and a great addition to a New England fall menu. I do have a mandoline and it made the apple slicing fast and easy, plus the slices are thin and uniform. Next time I will bake just 20 minutes, double the whipped cream, and fold in the Calvados after the cream is whipped.

Wonderful and fragrant. Recipe actually makes 6 tarts (4 makes the tarts too big). We served it with a selection of blue and aged cheddar with the presentation.

I made this as written, except without the aid of a mandoline or other slicer. I just used a paring knife and had no trouble. I served them with ice cream instead of the whipped cream and they were a smash hit. I'll definitely make them again, next time with whipped cream.

I made these as written, and since I don't have a mandoline or other slicing tool I just sliced the apples thinly with a knife and they were fine. I served the tarts sans whipped cream and served them with dulce de leche ice cream instead, and they were a smash hit. I'd like to make them again, next time with the whipped cream.
