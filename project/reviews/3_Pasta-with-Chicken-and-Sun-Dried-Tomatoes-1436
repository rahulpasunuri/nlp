I agree with other reviewers -- you definitely must double veggies, including garlic.. I also added a zucchini and next time I will add two. It could also use a little chicken broth or pasta water; it was a little dry. This recipe is promising, and it just needs to be tweaked. I will definitely make this again. Good week night meal.

This dish was delish! I will definitely be making it again, with a few tweaks. I added sliced zucchini, which was excellent. I would sub goat cheese for the parm next time, and save some of the oil to drizzle on at the end, as one reviewer suggested. It was a little dry overall, so some time I'm going to make it with a tomato/cream sauce. Should be great!

This was a pretty good basic recipe for weeknight cooking. The quantities of vegetables can easily be upped, according to preference of course. I cooked the chicken with balsamic vinegar as well as the olive oil. I also added pine nuts and black olives and put in way more fennel. Yum!

I have made this recipe many times - it is one of my husband's favorites - but it does need quite a bit of tweaking! First of all, if you use all that oil to brown the chicken, the chicken won't brown properly, it will absorb all the oil and there won't be a sufficient amount to make a sauce for the pasta. Use 2-3 tablespoons of oil to saute the chicken and vegetables, adding a bit more if absolutely necessary and adding the remainder at the end when you add the pasta to the dish. I also triple the amount of garlic this dish calls for, two cloves which are cooked with the oil and one which is added in at the very end of the cooking time; this will add a substantial amount of extra flavor to the dish. I also increase the amount of fennel to a full teaspoon and the amount of carrots to about a cup of chopped carrots. I generously season everything with freshly ground black pepper at the end. It's a hit every time!

This recipe needs a lot of help. First of all, where's the salt and pepper? Second, there isn't enough flavor. I deglazed the pan with white wine after cooking the onion, added pine nuts, used salt and pepper, and added a cup or so of the pasta cooking liquid to make it more "saucy." It still needed something. It would be good with a lot of mushrooms, especially porcini or some other strong-flavored mushrooms.

It was okay. I might make it again.

This dish was very delicious and easy to make! I made some changes however, and added sun dried tomato alfredo sauce over the chicken garlic mixture, and I sauteed the chicken with the onions and things to give it more flavor. If you are adding alfredo sauce, drain the oil and set it aside after you are done cooking the onion and garlic, and use it to dip bread in. Its safe from chicken

This was alright. Nothing really special. I don't think I'll make it again.

This dish is EXCELLENT!! I, however, made some changes: I marinated the chicken in Cesaer salad dressing, grilled them, omitted fennel and carrots, added red onion and fresh parsley. I use my own sun-dried tomatoes in organic extra virgin olive oil- I use that oil so it has the flavor and use 2 cups chopped sun-sried tomatoes. At the end of cooking the onions and tomatoes I throw in the chicken I have cubed to heat it through. EXCELLENT- my husband has requested it again!!

I think this dish has "potential". We added some dried chili peppers and parsley for a little more flavour. I found the chicken very bland but if I made this dish again I would saute the garlic & onion first then add the chicken and perhaps a handful of chopped arugula or toasted pine nuts just before serving.

This was not at all what I expected. I thought there would be a terrific blend of flavours, instead it turned out to be non-descript and unappealing. Probably more sun-dried tomatoes and flavouring would help, but I don't think I am going to experiement with this one.

I too had lost this recipe and found it again on Epicurious. This is not a highly spiced or sauced pasta, but it is very tasty, and relatively low on fat and calories. I add extra fennell and extra sun-dried tomatoes to give it a little more zest.

My family loves this recipe. My husband, who normally only likes pasta heavy with sauce, enjoys the tomatoes and fennel. My young children, who typically hate dishes with more than 1-2 ingredients, chow on the pasta and chicken. Like others, I increase the amount of all vegetables. This is such an easy week-night dish - will be making this one for years!

Very very bland and oily. I would not make it again.

This is an old favorite. I had lost the recipe, but thank goodness for Epicurios I have it again. My whole family loves it

I've made this dish several times but I too think it's better with the onions, fennel, carrots, and sundried tomatoes doubled. It's one of our old favorites.

I thought this dish lacked flavor. It needs a sauce to go with it.

Although I doubled the onion, garlic, fennel, carrot, & tomatoes we felt that the flavor was quite bland. It was an easy preparation but with all of the great pasta recipes out there I won't be making this one again.

Excellent dish. Have tried it and sent it to two family members on the West Coast. It was a big success with them. My only recommendation: increase the amount of sun dried tomatoes. 1/4 cup is too little. I doubled the amount and it was great.

This dish is excellent! I added broccoli- yum. I've made it for guests twice and it's been hugely successful. You must try it! P.S. My mom's maiden name is Susan Tollefson.
