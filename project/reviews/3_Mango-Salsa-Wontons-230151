What a great vitamin fix in the cold months! The sweet salty mix of this little concoction was a delight. It was easy and I will be making this again!

I brought these wontons to a Christmas brunch for something light, fruity, and flavorful. The recipe overall was tasty, but whoever says that they take 9-12 minutes to cook completely must have a magical super oven. It took 20 minutes for mine to cook completely (when I pulled them out after 15, there were a couple that were still droopy in the middle). Definitely a tasty dish, but it took way longer to cook than I expected. Save yourself time and get some equally delicious pita chips instead.

Instead of the onion, I added about 3 tablespoons of high quality salsa, and sprinkled with sea salt and pepper. It is very easy and quite good.

I couldn't find wonton wrappers so I served on toasted bread like bruschetta. I also used black pepper instead of cayenne (personal preference). Nice fresh flavors and easy to prepare. Of course I pretty much like anything with mango in it. I will be making this again.

The salsa was delicious, but I wouldn't go to the trouble of baking the won-tons again. Next time I'll just make the salsa and serve it with chips.

Normally I'm the one who loves the recipe that everyone gives bad reviews on but here I'm going to have to say this one is not for me. Like others said, it is light. I also served it at a dinner party and found that it was way too light, even with crab added for that setting. It might be good for a morning snack but was not substantial enough for evening. The flavors were not intense like I hope for. Even with the lime juice and salt and perpper, I think it could have used a sauce. If I did make it again, I think I'd puree the mango so it would serve as a thicking agent and clarify the flavor by dominating and also serve them with a jalepeno jelly and soy sauce mix.

I loved this! Very simple and light. Made this for a book club get-together, and everyone really enjoyed it.

I served this at a dinner party, and it just wasn't fly. Everyone much preferred the other items I had, and I would have to agree with them.

Nice and light. I made this for a bridal shower and it looked as good as it tasted. Even my hubsand enjoyed his taste samplings and asked for it again.

This is a great recipe. I made this several times now (particular during mango season). Instead of cucumbers I somtimes added ripe tomatoes and green onions

Just perfect for a lazy Sydney Saturday Springtime afternoon in November. Went down a treat. You can forget the extra olive oil if you are trying for a low-fat option and even the spray on the pan by using non-stick pan.

These were a hit for a graduation party! Am making them again this week for a bunch of ladies. Didn't change any of the seasonings, but I did add snowcrab, which worked well.

So pretty and easy for a summer party. Everyone was so impressed with the wontons, and they were so easy! Made all the night before and plated just before the party started-- couldn't have been easier. Definitely will make again.

These wontons were just boring. I would much rather just enjoy the mango by itself!

This is an attractive looking appetizer and the salsa was good, however, the baked wontons had the consistency and taste of bark. Guests couldn't eat them.

I made these for our book club last night and everyone loved them. I did substitute Chipotle Chili powder for the cayenne and it worked brilliantly. I would definitely try adding crab as the other reviewer suggested. They were great on their own but that would be a wonderful addition. I also found that 9 minutes was too long to brown the wontons - check them after about 7 minutes. I also found no need for the olive oil which makes them even more low fat. A definite keeper!

Made this for Super Bowl Party -- a big hit..I too sprayed the won tons with cooking spray for that "junk food" taste..just be careful when serving them on a platter..slippery little suckers slid right off the plate and broke very easily (d'oh!). Otherwise: a great snack!

I made this as part of party hor d'ourve table. I used a (thawed) bag of frozen mango from Trader Joe's. People kept asking what it was----an inhaled it! Very good and most certainly a keeper!

Made these for thankgiving and everyone loved them. The wonton cups taste fried if you spray them with the cooking spray. These would be excellent with any type of salsa. The ease of preparation was incomparable.

I assigned this recipe to my friend to make for our gourmet lunch group. Everyone thought they were great! When I make them, I may add some crab meat to make them a bit more substantial. The balance of herbs, crunch and spice is perfect!
