Made this for dinner because we had lots of zukes and onions to use up. I doubled the quantity which made for a LOT of work! If I make it again, I might try chopping and roasting the zucchini instead of slicing and sauteeing them, which took forever. I added some mushrooms and sage to the zucchini layer -- yummy. Followed another reviewer's suggestion and served with a simple tomato-cucumber salad to cut the richness. Everyone liked it.

This was really delicious and I'd definitely make again. The flavors were interesting and different; I wouldn't change anything because the flavor profile, which was lovely, would be altered. These onions really cook down and are almost liquified by the time they are finished; for those who thought the onions were overpowering, maybe they didn't cook them long enough.

I thought it was nice and simple. Maybe too much butter for me and I didn't find the onions overpowering. Like the other reviewer, I simmered the onions for a while with the wine, so the flavor was mild. I added pancetta to mine as well. If I did this again, I wouldn't add any salt.

We really enjoyed this - it was a nice change, with a subtle but yummy flavor. I did substitute mozzarella & fontina cheeses for part of the parmesan, to use what I had on hand. I'd make this again.

Mmm this was very good. A nice mix of flavors and I will definitely make it again. It lasted a week in my fridge too.

Very bad. I like onions, I love zucchini, I hated this lasagne. Perhaps I did something wrong, but it had no flavor. I ended up digging through the mess, eating only the zucchini slices.

This was very good! It could stand to have more zucchini (it's that time of year after all), and let's face it, Cooking Light ain't never gonna feature it, but still very tasty.

A summer must with zucchini fresh from the garden.

This is a very rich and unusual lasagne. I think the recipe is perfect as stated but I believe when cooking with this pasta it should be foil covered when baking. Do bake for 30 to 35 minutes. Top with chopped parsley before serving. Reminds me of very creamy casserole dishes from years ago.

EXCELLENT!!! I was tempted to used a red sauce instead, but ended up following the recipe, YUM! I see some thought the onions were overpowering, but I thought they were wonderful. Maybe its the type of onions used? I used Vidalia. And maybe they didn't cook it the length suggested? I was a little confused by the directions and cooked the onions a full hour, (45 and then 15 after adding wine) but maybe the intention was 45 total minutes. Anyway a keeper.

Made this recipe a couple of times. As suggested I would cut down on the onions (maybe 2/3's).

The onions were a little overpowering, perhaps cut onions in half.

I added a little mozzarella and decreased the parmesan a little. Make plenty of sauce. Three of us finished the whole dish at one sitting.

This is the BEST non-traditional lasagne I have ever had. My husband, who is a traditionalist to the core, even enjoyed this.

I made this for a holiday brunch. Yes, I know it's not very festive, but I needed an extra dish to cover the extra guests who *invited* themselves. I had to pump up the volume, so to speak. I didn't even get to taste it. Frankly, I don't like onions all that much and by the time I got around to serving myself, it was ALL GONE! People raved about it and demanded the recipe. They truly seemed to enjoy it. Based on their reaction, I would make it again.

This was an unusual lasagna, a bit rich, so perhaps best served with something to cut through that, like a tomato salad. I had a load of courgettes to use up though, so it was a good recipe to ring the changes.
