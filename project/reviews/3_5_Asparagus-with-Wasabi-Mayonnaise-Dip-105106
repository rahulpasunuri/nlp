I add green food coloring. The color of the dip looks so much better than a tan.

I loved the idea of asparagus shooters from other reviewers. I put the asparagus standing up in a vase and surrounded it with mini liqueur glasses filled with the dip (so each person could have his own). It made for a very nice presentation and solved the double-dipping problem that a long asparagus spear presents. I thought the dip tasted too strongly of mayonnaise, so I tried substituting some of it (half maybe?) with Greek yogurt. It improved the taste and made it healthier and lower fat. Great EASY recipe!

Served at an outdoor picnic fundraiser in mini-parfait glasses with a single stalk in the glass, arranged on a platter with a fan of asparagus. All the college kids came begging an "asparagus shooter". My guests were very creative as they attempted to scrap every last bit of the dip out. A winner all around.

Made it for a veggie tray the other night -- yum! I'm still looking through the refrigerator for vegetables to use up the dip. The color is not fantastic, but with the right container (I've got little ones that are brightly colored), it's not a big issue.

Very good. Used for a dip for artichokes. I think I would try Mirin rather than sugar next time,as a sweetener.

Fascinating ...it's always a challenge to find apps. I've made this three times in the last 2 weeks - people really liked it. One of the reviewers gave the idea of putting a few in a small glass with a bit of sauce, this way everyone has their own - it's a great idea. I found tiny 'coke' glasses at the dollar store. Simple - try it!

I have made this recipe a dozen or more times, always to rave reviews from anyone who loves asparagus! But it also delicious with any veggies you might use with a dip. I think the sugar is key to the balance of flavors and have found that it is best when made ahead at least a few hours. That gives the wasabi time to really blend in well and for any potential harshness to soften nicely. Definitely use the wasabi paste (so much better than the powder). Keep the recipe on hand after serving this as your guests will definitely want it.

I tried this, but didn't like the sugar in the wasabi dip. My version: 1 C mayo, 1 T wasabi, 1 T fresh lemon juice, 4 tsp soy sauce. Also good on baked or sesame-crusted salmon...

I served this for an Easter brunch and it was a huge hit with everyone! So easy and yet so tasty. The asparagus was wonderful with it, but I can see almost any vegetable being enhanced by this simple recipe. Don't scrimp on the Wasabi! I added some extra just to give it a little more kick. Definitely use the paste rather than the powder.

Had this dip last night at a party with sugar snap peas and the asparagus, it was awesome. My friend used sushi soya sauce and the wasabi paste, not powder, it is too strong, everyone crowded around and ate it all! Can't wait to make it for Christmas! Thanks very much!

I get requests for this recipe all the time. Wasabi paste gives a little more of a kick, but I have used powder also. The powder needs time to "bloom" in water to get the full taste out of it. I also blanch the asparagus for no more than 25 seconds. I prefer them slightly firm - better for dipping!

Rating: 3
Yum. Per the Asian gentleman at Whole Foods, I used an Asian brand of Wasabi powder- he insisted it was better flavor. All I know it tasted great! Not great for a buffet cocktail- tough presentation. I mixed the wasabi powder with super hot water before adding to the mayo & had no issues with a gritty feeling from the powder.

A simple, tasty, healthy (if you are conservative with the dipping sauce) appetizer.

Dip was not exciting nor memorable, even with the extra wasabi and other ingredients as others suggested. At the last minute, I mixed up some store-bought roasted red pepper pesto with a little mayo and sour cream...it was SO much better than this dip, and guests thought so too.

truly delicious. i used 1/2 packet of sweet & lo because we are trying lo-carb - the wasabi is strong enough that you dont have to worry about residual sweet & lo flavor.

Sorry, I also substituted one small package of Splenda for the sugar, as well as the low fat mayonnaise. I do not recommend using wasabi powder, as it is more difficult to get that great taste (takes a little more experimenting for the perfect taste). Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. You will love it!

One of the few recipes that I actually give a four-fork rating to. This is by far one of the best, if not the best, dipping sauce I've had. I use non-fat mayonnaise for this recipe for no-guilt dipping. My husband loves it as much as I do, and I make it almost once a week. It goes good with broccoli as well.

The rave reviews for this recipe prompted me to make it as an appetizer. I followed the recipe exactly. While I didn't care for the dip--it should have been obvious to me that I wouldn't since I don't like horseradish--the guests at our party seemed to love it, asked for the recipe and finished it all. If you like horseradish. . .go for it. If not, well keep looking.

This was delicious! I love asparagus so I usually don't do much more than steam and squeeze some lemon, but there was something (probably the wasabi) about this recipe that attracted me. A very refreshing dish on a warm night. Like previous reviewers I used half mayo and half sour cream, and I used more wasabi. This will make a frequent appearance on our table this summer.

Rating: 3
This was very good and different. I added some lemon zest, used a WHOLE BUNCH more wasabi paste, less sugar, and added some thinly sliced green onions for a little crunch and color, since I was using it as an appetizer with sesame crackers. However, everyone liked it so much that we ended up using what was left on the asparagus that I happened to be serving as well! I think the next time I make this, I'm going to try half mayo and half sour cream to lighten it up a bit, if I'm using it as an appetizer.

What a great recipe. Easy and elegant all in one. I followed the recipe exactly. I was tempted to add a bit more wasabi paste, but didn't in deffernce to those that might not tolerate it as well.

This is fabulous! I had it at a friend's holiday party and just made it for my sister's birthday. The asparagus blanching directions resulted in perfect spears. Wasabi mayo was great. Used powdered wasabi (extra 1/2 tsp.) Every spear was eaten and recipe was requested. Definite keeper!

FABULOUS!! I added a bit more Wasabi paste to the dip and served 5 pounds of this at a party. It was all gone by the end of the evening, and I must have been asked for the recipe five times. Love this dish!! It will be my new standard. Make it the day before and stash it in the fridge. Thanks for sharing!

Impressed my seasoned mother, picky sister and wary boyfriend. Delish! I'd like to find other things to dip in this - like shrimp or other veggies. I might try scattering some black sesame seeds on it, as another reviewer suggested. Otherwise, it's just a boring beige color; but tastes absolutely fab. I did have to add more wasabi paste, more soy sauce, a little more lemon juice and a little more sugar than what the recipe calls for to bring out the flavors. Definitely try it!

Served this at my luau-style dinner party last night. Added baby corn to the mix. It was good, but one guest kept asking people to "Pass the mustard." I made the dip with homemade mayonnaise that contained dijon mustard. Maybe that was it? The wasabi flavor didn't shine through, and the soy sauce color really made it look like mustard.

Absolutely delicious -- a huge hit! I purchased the wasabi at a specialty store that carries wonderful sushi. Because we like wasabi, I used more than called for in the recipe, whisking it in until the dip tasted right. Really, really good!

This was a smash. I did tinker a little...but that comes with the territory. The tinkering just meant increasing ingredients to our liking, although very ittle xtra sugar.

Made a double batch of the wasabi mayonnaise dip for Thanksgiving dinner. It was great. Used a little more wasabi paste because here was just a little squeese left in the tube.

I LOVE wasabi, but this sauce was gross. If I made again, I'd tinker with it a good deal. I didn't like the sugar in it but most of all, the soy sauce turns it an ugly brownish-orange.

Talk about zip! It really added some much-needed zestiness to the asparagus. I went all-asian on this one. I used ponzu (lemon-infused soya sauce), a little sesame oil and mirin (sweet japanese rice-wine)to get the same result. This mayo dip is excellent with chilled shrimp which has been sauteed in garlic. This one's a keeper.

Definitely would recommend using wasabi paste. I used wasabi powder in a pinch, and it was rather average. Based on my experiences, I think the paste would have added a better kick. Also, think the garlic addition is a good idea. I'll have to try that next time.

We call this "Sally's Asparagus" after a friend who always brings this to parties because the rest of us all LOVE it! It is a nice compliment to all of the heavier appetizers people usually bring. It's fresh and light, and so pretty on a platter. Guests always flip for it!

This dip is good, but if you want to really bump it up, take 2 or 3 cloves of garlic and finely mince it or press it and mix it in with the rest of the dip. It has the flavor of an Italian garlic aioli with a great Japanese twist to it. Don't be timid, go ahead and try it!
