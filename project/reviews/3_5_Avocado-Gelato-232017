I couldnt believe anything that is made without cream could be so, well, creamy. I brought this to a party and it was a hit, although I think it seemed more of a novelty than a best-ice-cream-I-ever-tasted kind of thing. I wouldnt recommend this to people who dont love avocados. But for those who do, it is surprisingly tasty! I followed the advice of other reviewers and used lime instead of Vitamin C. I used quite a bit of extra lime for flavor.

Wow, a surprisingly good gelato recipe. I just got back from Italy, so I feel like I have an idea of what good gelato should be like and this nailed it. Hard to believe you're eating avocado! I took the advice of other reviewers and used lime instead of the vitamin c and it worked out great. Also, I didn't have whole milk, so I used 2% and a little heavy cream. I will definitely be making this one again!

I love this recipe and tell everyone all about it. I used to make a vegan version back when I was vegan...so yummy! To the person asking about garnishes, I don't think this needs anything at all! However, if you just really need something...how about mint sprigs, mini lime wedges, strawberries, or citrus zest?

Haven't tried this exact recipe, so I won't rate it. But I wanted to share a similar (and easier) recipe that has become my husband's and my favorite 'ice cream'. We combine plain yogurt, pureed avocado, sugar to taste (probably much less than this recipe), lime juice and pistacchios and put it all in the ice cream maker. Rarely does any of it last long enough to be stored in the freezer!

A few ideas for the individual who is wondering what would go with this ice cream; Try a tropical or citrus fruit salad &/or a delicate cookie

Made this gelato for a small group of friends, to which it was given rave reviews and licked- out bowls. Prep was a cake-walk, and the color is amazing. My only dilemma with this dish is an appropriate garnish and accompaniment. what would go well with this ice-cream?

Instead of the vitamin C, I added the juice of two small limes (and lime zest instead of orange), which was probably too much, unless you want to make Avocado-Lime Gelato. Nice texture even without using heavy cream!

I made this for an Iron Chef party, and won the top prize for best all around dish: presentation, taste, adherence to the secret ingredient (avocado). Everyone loved it; many went back for seconds. I used lime juice in lieu of the vitamin c tablet, which I think enhances the flavor. I also substituted heavy cream for some of the milk. I garnished the dessert dishes with a thin slice of lime. It was divine. I will definitely make it again.

I bought avocados for the Superbowl and never used them.. was looking for an alternative to guacamole (an old standby, but..), and boy did I find it! It's not even fully frozen yet, but it is YUM! I added about 1/4C key lime juice to the avocado mixture and it made a fabulous complement. Will def. make again!

Whipped this up on a whim to use up some over-ripe avocados. I substituted about .5 Tbs lemon juice for the vitamin C and the color was gorgeous. Also, I used only 2% milk and it's as rich and creamy and decadent as I'd ever want it to be.

A friend I had in the 70s (she was from Puerto Rico) made a"pudding" using avocado, sweet whipped cream and a small amount of espresso coffee - but not frozen. Now I will try this recipe with that added flavoring.

This recipe is suberb if the idea of eating an avacado for dessert appeals to you. Most of us thought the taste was too strong, not concealed enough, and rather bad. Nontheless, we gave it three forks because it tasted fresh, original, flavorful, and a few of us liked it.

Very fun and interesting. Half the table admitted later that they planned on taking a polite bite and then hating it, but every single guest scraped the bowl clean. I didn't own an icecream maker, so I just put the bowls in the freezer for 2 hours. I was lucky and it turned out great. I worry that any longer in the freezer would have produced avocadocicles.

Creamy, but only make this recipe if you are really fond of just plain avocado. Very easy recipe.

This was wonderful. Very creamy and luxurious with a unique flavor and impressive colour. I would, however, make the following changes: a.) Use some amount of heavy crean, or simply use 1/2 & 1/2 in place of the milk. b.) Not bother with the VC tablet, and use lemon or lime juice instead.

I made a batch of 1.5x (the perfect amount for my ice cream maker) and followed the previous user's suggestion, adding 1/4 cup key lime juice, 4 tbls sugar and 1/4 tsp vanilla to the avocado puree. The ice cream is very light, delicately flavored, and delicious. (Nothing like gelato, though - so don't expect that custardy flavor.)

This was quite flavorful and a good way to get nutrients. Made with soy milk it could be good for allergy diets. I served it with heated, chopped pistashios and bittersweet chocolate chunks. Yum. It has a nice texture but be careful not to add too much sugar.

I'm not sure if I would make it more than once a year but I would make it again. The flavor is very distinctive but good. Instead of taking the orange peel out I pureed it in the gelato. I think this kept it from being like frozen quacamole. I think I would like to try it again topped with spicy chocolate chili sauce.

I've been searching for an avocado ice cream recipe for years--they're my daughter's favorite food. This turned out very nicely and it was very well received by our dinner guests. I substituted lime for the orange since my daughter doesn't like them and lime is a natural pairing with avocado. The gelato base was incredibly easy and I ended up using it for other flavors as well. Very smooth. The biggest problem occurred when the avocado wouldn't puree easily and I ended up having to squeeze in additional lime juice. Next time I'll use a little milk since the lime flavor did threaten to dominate the avocado. The hardest part about making this is finding great avocados--I suggest buying extras since you never know until you open them

I followed the directions 100% and the sorbet turned out to be spectacular!

Absolutely creamy and lovely. served it with strawberries which was fine. I liked someone's idea of adding citrus juice, so I am thinking of adding O.J. next time. that might work better than lime or lemon. didn't have a chewable vitamin C, so I used a time-release capsule!! seemed a bit crazy but it worked and added to the nutritional value of the dessert. A friend told me that she once had a chocolate avocado pudding that was to die for.... that could be an interesting addition and then even my 2-year old who refuses to eat green foods might go for it.

This is the second time I'm reviewing this recipe. I made the gelato again, but this time I saved the orange zest and folded it back into the gelato at the very end. It provided a nice color contrast and the taste of the peel also went well with the avocado flavor. I tried some with a little Cointreau spooned over it, but that definitely did not work. By now a lot of my friends have sampled this gelato and everybody loves it...I don't think they needed to "acquire a taste"!

Make this gelato! The previous reviewers are right that you should only make it for more adventurous palates, but this is delicious, it's smooth, and the color is absolutely beautiful...especially when offset with a few fresh strawberries.

Wow. I have to differ with most of the reviews for this. I made it for my family as a dessert for a Mexican dinner. They hated it!! While it was smooth and creamy, the taste was overwhelmingly sweet. I should have read the reviews first on making changes to it. It seemed to be lacking something. My sister-in-law suggested scooping it up with corn chips and the added saltiness worked great. I think I'll make it again, but as an appetizer with the chips--a new form of guacamole. But I'm only going to serve it to my more sophisticated company as it is an acquired taste.

I made this gelato without any deviations from the recipe. Wow! So smooth, beautiful color and mild avocado taste. I wondered about adding cointreau to the recipe, but in the end I decided not to. This is a recipe that requires no tweaking. If desired, one could always pour some cointreau over it. I like the other reviewer's idea of adding a strawberry sauce...if only for the color contrast. Can't wait to make this one again!

Update to a previous review. I've made this a couple of more times and added 1/4 cup key lime juice, 3 tbls sugar and 1/2 tsp vanilla to the avocado puree. I might back off on the lime juice to 3 tbls next time so as not to overwelm the avocado. These additions make this recipe for us. We feel it is company quality.

Very good. For the cook a few reviews below, I think adding the lemon juice caused the tartness as mine was very, very sweet. The vitamin C tablet can't be tasted and just makes the gelato healthier!

Rich and luscious, this is definitely a dessert to serve to open-minded connoisseurs...they won't be sorry.

This was interesting and definitely different. Used lemon zest instead of orange. Also added lemon juice to maintain the color (instead of that bizarre ground-up vitamin C tablet. yuck!). It stayed a lovely green, but the taste was kind of strange. A bit tart. Maybe it does need more sugar? Some vanilla extract? Overall, we liked it, but recipe might need some tinkering. Easy to make though and will impress guests. Serve with vanilla wafers!

Y-U-M-M-Y. You must try this. What a great idea to use avocados! Very smooth and creamy and a perfect avocado flavor. I purchased organic avocados from Wild Oats. My instincts told me to stay away from conventional ones from Mexico, which is what all the other stores had. The organic ones were much larger too.

It made a very creamy and rich ice cream desert, but it was missing something. Maybe it was the avocados I used. I think it has possibilities, but it needs some tinkering. If I make it again, I'll add some lime juice, more sugar or orange liquor to try to make it better. The question is how much so as not to overwelm the avocado taste.

This gelato is just amazing. Everyone with an ice-cream maker should be compelled to try this, it is so so good! I think the hardest thing about making this gelato is to find good quality avocados. The best frozen dessert I have made so far.

I served this with fresh strawberry sauce. My whole family really enjoyed it. Fantastic recipe.
