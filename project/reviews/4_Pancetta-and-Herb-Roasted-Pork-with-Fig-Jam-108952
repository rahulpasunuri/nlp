Fabulous, only change I make is using pork tenderloin as I like the texture better.

Have made this recipe for the last several years for Xmas brunch by popular demand. Can easily prep ahead and pop in oven while opening presents. Think we would be disowned if we ever had the audacity to change up the menu and didn't make it. :) 1. Half the fig jam...way too much. 2. Last year, we followed butcher's directions for cooking the pork (lower heat -350, longer cook time). This eliminated the pancetta burning or becoming too crisp and was the best result to-date. 3. Enjoy! One of our favorite holiday recipes.

outstanding and fairly easy. made 1/2 amount of jam with less sugar. got rave reviews from guests. i would make this for any dinner party including Christmas.

Turned out very well with minimal effort. Next time I'll reduce the amount of sugar in the fig jam (it was super sweet) and maybe add ginger or shallots to add some complexity to the flavor. The recipe definitely made much more jam than needed. But it's easy enough to think of other great ways to use it up in the next couple weeks and a small jar will be a nice gift for a friend as well. We served it with Brussels sprouts, miso eggplant and brown rice. Definitely worth repeating and our guest loved it.

Excellent recipe. I used this recipe for a party of 30 people and it both tasted great and presented well. My first attempt (pre-party) I burned the fig jam. Second time I cooked the jam very slow and and it turned out great. I did end up cooking the jam for hours - probably user inexperience with carmelizing. Will make again.

Excellent dish! Pork was very moist and herb marinate gave it a great taste. My fig jam caramelized and we had to add more liquid to it.

Love, love, love this recipe. A great winter dish to have when it's cold and snowy outside. I use bacon instead of pancetta, since it's always on hand. You can half the recipe for fig jam as it makes a lot. Serve with oven roasted yellow potatoes.

This was really good and easy. The fig jam is wonderful and great with champagne!

I messed this recipe up a little bit, and it was still yummy. I neglected to rub the pork with the herbs until a couple hours before I cooked it, and it still had a nice herb flavor. I'm sure it would have been even better had I followed the instructions. I listened to some of the other reviewers and added the pancetta only halfway through the cooking, which I regretted as it did not become at all crispy and instead got lost in the rest of the dish. Next time I'll add it in the beginning, especially because my pork took only about an hour to cook. I do agree, though, that it might be a good idea to get more than 3 ounces of pancetta. I made half of the fig jam and still had a lot left over, but I thought that it was delicious. However, I have made a similar recipe for fig sauce which I much prefer. It can be found in the prosciutto and brie sandwiches with fig confit (or something like that) recipe on this site. I would highly recommend it. Overall, I agree that this dish is worthwhile.

pork is a hard dish not to dry out, i usually make the pork loin with garlic and rosemary from this site, but thought to try this one. I am glad I did, its the new favorite. I also cut sugar after i made it the first time (prob to a 2/3 of what recipe calls for) I use a rotisserie, the set it and forget it actually. -- i know, i know BUT it really does make a great moist pork loin. i wrap the pancetta all around and with the bands let it hold on and it just turns and drips the juices back onto itself. it ends up amazing. i make the jam ahead of time and have to cook it longer to get a thick jam like consistency- i found leaving the figs a bit larger size helps. the only change i make to the pork is to add a clove of garlic to it. its really good as long as you don't overcook it and dry it out. try it. i serve now with new potatoes with butter and parsley and green beans with dried cherries and pignoli (pine) nuts

I recently made this dish for the third time, this time trying brining the pork loin and implementing many of changes based on others helpful reviews. The changes I incorporated after brining were to add garlic with the herbs, requesting thick cut pancetta (but buy extra in case you need to add a second layer), roasting in the lower middle oven rack and quite importantly, checking the internal temperature after 1 hour (mine was at 150 degrees at 65 minutes). I also made only half the recipe of fig jam with good results. I found Mission figs this time and I think the seeds are smaller and less intrusive then the type I used previously. As many have said, the consistency of the jam can vary but it does thicken after refrigeration. Crumbling the pancetta over the top for serving is a nice finishing touch. It's a nice medly of flavors and textures, herbed pork, salty and crunchy bacon offset by the flavorful wine imbued fig jam. I find this recipe to be a reliable performer and consider it beyond normal fare and and very fitting to serve guests. In our opinion a nice cab made a good pairing. Bon appetit! (P.S. If interested in trying brining, I dissolved 1/2 cup kosher salt and 1/4 cup sugar in 2 quarts water for one pork loin. I left it in the brine solution-- refrigerated--for one hour, then drained the brine and rinsed and dried the pork loin before proceeding with the recipe.)

this was very tasty.. I did the chicken broth and wine as another reviewer mentioned.. It was very moist.. and did the twice the pancetta.. and put some on top just before it was done.. Also I should have paid attention to your notes.. WAY TOO MUCH FIG JAM!!! we will be eating it for a long time.. We had 11 guests.. I should have halved it.. I still would have had leftovers..

Easy and delicious. The fig jam is wonderful. 7 pounds of meat for 12 people seems excessive (and expensive). One roast of this size would have been plenty for my group of 12.

To Die For!!! I make this at least once a year over the holidays to rave reviews. The combination of flavors is just fantastic. If you can, find pepper crusted pancetta (I find it at Whole Foods) and it brings this dish to a whole new level. I won't even bother with "plain" pancetta with this dish.

This is great for large gatherings. I did the pork on the bbq using indirect heat as I had run out of room in the oven. It turned out perfectly.

Excellent combination of tastes. I doubled the pancetta to cover the pork and it was great. Tasted the fig by itself and thought it was too strong. Then put it on the pork and it was heaven. Great flavors, easy to make and wonderful tastes. Definetely a keeper.

It was yummy, but I was a little underwhelmed after reading the reviews. I made this for Easter and found that the pancetta (while delicious) shrank way too much and fell off the roast, which did not look pleasing. I had the butcher cut it to "bacon" thickness as another reviewer suggested, but would probably ask for it to be even thicker. The jam was good but will 1/4 the recipe next time. I was eating it for a week and had to throw the rest away! :( Added one garlic clove, minced, to the rub which had a nice subtle flavor.

Everyone loved this dish! I haven't been able to find a loin roast that I love so I used pork tenderloins from Whole Foods. I prepared everything the same except that I cooked the tenderloins for 18-20 minutes. I tested it as I would my steaks by pressing on the meat and when it felt like the base of my thumb I removed them, covered and let rest for 5 minutes. I wasn't thrilled with the sauce when I tasted it but it was delicious when combined with the herbed meat. The simplicity of preparation of this dish could make this my favorite for dinner parites allowing me to spend more time on everything else. I served this with roasted asparagus. I would also serve some type of potato with this but I had pasta with shrimp and sundried tomatoes as a first course.

A no fail dinner party hit! I stuffed the pork loin with chorizo cranberry stuffing from my local farmers market and it was amazing. The second time I made it, I didn't' stuff it at all, but put pancetta in between the loins and it was still fabulous!

Rating: 4
Easy and delicious. The combination of flavors really worked. I erred in the opposite direction of many reviewers and cooked the jam too long and ended with fig syrup--turned out tasty anyway. I served a citrus salad on the side which seemed to cut the sweetness of the figs but compliment the winey aspects of the jam.

Rating: 3
Loved it, made it for new years eve and it was huge hit. I also doubled the pancetta, found that it was "shrinking" too fast so added another layer. I also let the pork get to about 150 degrees, 145 was a little pink--some ovens may vary. It was delicious!!!

This one surprised me; I'm usually adept at anticipating how a recipe will taste, but this one so far exceeded my expectations. I was expecting something much more nondescript, but decided to try it based on the reviews.First of all, it's effortless. Probably one of the easiest dishes around and can be made far in advance. Secondly the flavors were exquisite, and finally, it was probably the most tender pork loin roast I've ever made. The only modifications I made in the recipe: cut a whole pork loin in half, divided the marinade over each half, and froze one half for another time. I also used double the amount of pancetta. My only regret: serving this two days before Christmas instead of on Christmas itself.

Rating: 4
This was simply outstanding. Made it for Christmas dinner exactly as written, except reduced the sugar in the fig jam to 1.5 cups and cooked it for 1.5 hours. I asked for the pancetta to be sliced the same thickness as normal bacon and it came out to be the perfect texture, soft and cooked but lightly brown and crisp where exposed. Everyone ooh and aahd and one even asked if there was extra fig jam to take home. Will make it again and again for company, as this was fairly hands-off, looked beautiful and tasted great.

This recipe was great. I served it to a classic meat and potatoes bunch who were very suspicious of fig jam. They are now thoroughly converted. Some were getting up to get fourths! I doubled the rub and substituted fig jam for the figs and sugar in the jam recipe to save time. I also cut the water out of the jam recipe and it thickened beautifully. The pancetta just curled up and burned a bit on me like the other reviewers said. Tasted great with the Roasted Acorn Squash and Chestnuts.

Rating: 3
Loved it. Reduced the quantity of pork to 2 1-lb loins as I only wanted to serve 4. Didn't reduced the marinade, and only marinated for 6 hours or so, but the additional rub/pork ratio worked in our favor. I'd do a fairly fine chop on the figs next time, they were a little too large for my preference at 1/4 in thickness. This isn't drop-dead fabulous, but pretty damn good and a cinch to prepare.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious. Marinated overnight. Did not use sage. Roasted 1.5 hrs. at 350 degrees in a convection oven. When I put the roast in the pan, I added 1/2 cup chicken broth and 1/2 cup dry white wine. I repeated this every 20 minutes until the roast was done. The liquid almost evaporated between each addition. At the end I added about 2 cups of water to the pan to deglaze. This made a delicious accompaniment. The pork was tender, tasty, moist & done -- we don't like rare pork. The pancetta did not burn; nor was it dry. Served with purchased fig jam. Also served with crimini mashed potatoes (recipe from this site). Outstanding meal. Guests (and I) loved it. Was hoping for leftovers, but no luck there!

I cooked it following the recipe except I added tin foil over the roasts when the pancetta started to brown. The roast ended up tough and dry. Thank goodness for jam and pancetta - otherwise it would have been unedible. I won't make this again.

This is simply just ok. I honestly do not see what all the other reviewers liked about it. Plus the figs were not the easiest thing to find. No one at the table said anything positive about it and they usually are quick to compliment. Total waste of time and money.

This was absolutely fabulous...four forks because it was so simple, but really delicious! I didn't have time to make the jam, so I used purchased fig and pepper jam...MMMM! The salty pancetta was in perfect harmony with the sweet fig and subtle pork. My usual complaints about pork is that it is tough to keep moist, however this recipe makes it easy! Juicy and tender. I made this for my boyfriend for our 1 year anniversary...I think I just further solidified our relationship! ;)

Delicious! My friends and boyfriend raved. I overcooked the pork a bit but it was completely my fault. I threw in some baby red potatoes and yellow onion that I marinated in the same herbs to the roasting pan halfway during cooking and they soaked up the pan juices and were delicious. The fig jam is awesome. I also threw it into the processor to make it more jammy, but I wonder how it would have been with the small bits of fig. Maybe I'll have to try that! At any rate, awesome, and pretty easy too!

This was excellent and very easy. The fig sauce (not really a jam, in my opinion) was divine. The pancetta curled up in the oven and didn't add too much flavor unless you got a piece on your serving. Fabulous recipe to impress.

Fantastic dish. The fig jam is just outstanding! After it had cooked and thickened nicely, I forced most of the jam through a fine sieve to remove the seeds and now it is a lovely smooth jam. I use it constantly as an enhancement to pan sauces, especially for pork. It is just super! As I had made this for Christmas dinner, the jam is all gone. I plan to make the jam again this weekend - not something I want to be without!

This was a huge hit for my family's Christmas dinner, and very easy to prepare. Don't skip the fig jam; it's a crucial part of the dish. Following other reviewers' comments, I did halve the jam recipe, and also cut back a little on the sugar.

this was an amazing dinner! couldn't find the mission figs for the jam, so i used regular figs. still delicious. the pancetta did curl up when it was cooked, but it added great flavor. everyone, even my ex-chef brother, loved it! i will be making this again.

This was a lovely Christmas Eve dish. The jam took closer to 2 hrs to reduce, rather than the 45 mins in the recipe, but it was worth it. The pork was delicious. The pancetta adds great flavor, but by the time the roast was done, the pancetta was crisp--I didn't like the crispiness, but I see that other reviewers did. All in all, a wonderful dish, enjoyed by everyone from a 4-year old to a 92-year old.

This was an amazing dish! Everyone in my family loved it and my mom and I couldn't stop eating the fig jam leftovers the next day. I only made a few changes - I added garlic cloves to the herb paste and I accidently used proscuitto instead of pancetta. The proscuitto burned while it was in the oven but I just took the pieces off the pork, crushed them, and sprinkled them over the roast, which gave the roast a nice cruchiness. I am usually not a fan of pork but this dish has completely converted me. My family has requested that I make this for next year's Christmas Eve dinner!

Rating: 4
Outstandingly tasty and simple to make! Huge hit for Christmas dinner! The key is to definitely "marinate"/refrigerate the seasoned pork loin over night. Incredibly flavorful-- the pancetta makes kicks up the flavor, so don't omit it. Rather than making the fig jam, I purchased Dalmatia Fig Preserve/jam--it was wonderful. Also, I roasted potatos (peeled, cut into quarters) in a separate pan with a little olive oil, some diced raw pancetta and then "basted" them occasionally with the juices from the pork pan-- they were fabulous! The baon pieces crisped nicely and then basting added a great flavor to the potatoes. Definitely a keeper for holiday dinners to come...

It came out perfect and was a huge hit on Christmas eve. My butcher trimmed each loin just right, no fat on top, but enough on the bottom. I cooked it exactly for 1 1/2 hours at 400 and let it sit for 30 minutes lightly covered with foil. It was juicy. In the interest of time and preparing for a large crowd, I cheated with the jam. I purchased Dalmation fig jam.

Really liked the fig jam- I also pureed it in the Food Processor. We had one large pork loin and I over cooked it a bit, but it was still quite popular- all my picky eaters really suprised me with their willingness to try fig jam- they all loved it! The flavor is great and next time I will take extra care not to overcook

Rating: 4
What a fabulous entree this is! Comments: I had the same experience shared by many others, in that my jam didn't reduce significantly. So I used a hand blender on it to puree it coarsely and give it the necessary thickness. Sure enough, it also thickened with refrigeration. Really outstanding when paired with the pork, and also works well as a jam for toast. As for the pork, it was very flavorful and tender. I halved a whole pork loin, marinated it, and tied it up myself. Using advice from others on this site, I tented the roast after 45 mins. to prevent the pancetta from burning. That worked like a charm, and I got a lovely, crisp garnish on the meat, as well as lots of deep, rich flavor. A major winner, and possibly a new Christmas tradition!

I made this for a 50th Birthday buffet dinner and it was very good. I had only two problems and one had nothing to do with the recipe. The pork roast I used was too fatty, so next time I'll look for a leaner cut and my fig "jam" was nothing like jam no matter how long I boiled it. It was like pieces of figs floating in sugar water. I finally put it all in the food processor and minced it very fine, then reboiled it with some Certo. That seemed to do the trick. It was still liquid enough to pour - like a sauce - but nice and smooth.

Rating: 4
Wonderful main course dish. I found using a combination of both dried and fresh figs gives the jam a smoother texture - more of a sauce than a "jam". Removing the string ties from the pork can be a bit of a challege, as most of the pancetta slices will fall off as the string is pulled out. I just placed the pancetta back on after removing the string and carving.

This recipe was fantastic. I made it for Christmas last year for a group of 8 very picky eaters. There was not one complaint in the group! I ended up putting the fig jam into the food processor to make it more jam-like. We had a TON of leftover jam but it was so yummy that I ate it on toast.

I made this recipe for a buffet and it was absolutely outstanding. It was nice to prep the roasts ahead of time so that they could marinate and the pancetta added a wonderful depth to the flavor. If you cannot find fig jam you could substitute raspberry sauce.

This was truly delicious. I made it for my husband's birthday and he enjoyed it immensely and felt it was an appropriate celebration dish! My market didn't have the black Mission figs, just "dried" figs in bulk. The jam still turned out deliciously and was a nice dark color. Based on other reviewer's comments, I cooked the jam closer to one hour, but I think I would prefer it thinner and more sauce-like. I also added an additional three slices of pancetta to the top of the roast during the last 10-15 minutes to keep the first layer from becoming over dry. Quite yummy!

Very good recipe. After reading previous reviews, I had my butcher slice pancetta a bit thicker and it worked perfectly. Nice and crunchy as a garnish. The jam also took a bit longer (a little over an hour). But the next day, the jam had thickened and was possibly even better. Easy and a great do-ahead dish.

This roast was really good--the herbs were great. I did have trouble with the pancetta, though. It ended up turning black about 25 minutes into cooking time, so I took it off and added another layer about 20 minutes before the pork was due to be finished.

Prepared this for dinner last night. I DID NOT prepare the Jam however, as I knew my wife would not care for it. Thanks to my new meat thermometer, the roast was perfectly done; very slightly pink in the middle and all white at the ends- something for everyone. The herb/Pancetta crust added a nice flavor that infused the meat with some spice and sweatness that is usually lacking in basic pork loin preparations. BUT- be carefull with the amount of salt in the marinade. I understand that some in necessary, but the Pancetta is already quite salty.... In the roasting pan along with the roast, I placed diced potatoes and onions (seasoned with salt, pepper and olive oil). The potatoes/onions were nicely done and had a slight hint of herb/pancetta flavor. Vegetable was baby spinach, sauted in butter, garlic and pancetta and I added pine nuts just before serving. When I prepare this recipe again, I'll try encasing the pork in slices of Pancetta, all around. Overall, an easy dish to prepare and perfect for dinner parties as most of the work is done beforehand.

I'll admit, this was my first experience with pancetta. It curled and crisped and started to smoke well before the roast was fully cooked. I removed and discarded it and left the roast to finish by itself. Even so, everyone enjoyed the roast and fig jam. I made the jam one day ahead, and the consistency was perfect.

I cook a lot of pork loin, and this is one of the best ways I have found to give some flavor to today's bland and overly lean cuts. I didn't have time to marinate the meat overnight, but it took on some wonderful characteristics after only a couple of hours. The jam was quite thin, even after being reduced by half, but my guests pointed out that it worked well as a sauce, soaking into the meat in a way that would have been impossible if it were more jam-like. The pancetta is a key ingredient; after the roast was done, I chopped up the cooked pancetta and sprinkled it over the sliced roast on the platter.

What is so wonderful about this recipe is that the roast is so simple to make, but incredibly juicy and delicious. The fig jam takes some time, but can be made well in advance. It does seem thin when you first make it, but if you refrigerate it overnight, it takes on the perfect, jammy consistency. An absolute winner.

This was a fabulous dish and easy to prepare. The fig jam and the pancetta were a great combination. The fig jam is especially delicious. The only change we made was to emulisfy the jam to thicken. The leftover jam can be used for many dishes. Our company raved and asked for the recipe!
