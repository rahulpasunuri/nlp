Neither the green tomatoes (from our garden) nor the watermelon (from the farmer's market) really had enough flavor to give this any "punch" and this despite my generous quantity of cilantro, lime juice, and the thai chili. It needed something more to bring the flavors out.

Simple and easy, but not enough flavor for me. Personally I like more bold flavors, especially in a salsa, but for those who like more subtle flavors, this was an easy and presentable dish. Note: to allow more advanced prep, the salsa could be made with everything except the watermelon longer than an hour ahead, and watermelon mixed in last minute.

Delicious and easy. I used mahi mahi. The salsa is very versatile. I ate the leftovers the next morning with eggs and that was yummy, too.

my fish guy did not have striped bass so i used halibut and it came out good. will give it another try thistime with the bass, but i will also tweak the salsa. i used red and yellow tomatoes and shallots and red onions and it was tasty, but i think it would be better by increasing the amount of watermelon

Because of an early frost this year we have been searching for green tomato recipes. This was great on perch and will use it on Halibut. (Oh for fresh seafood again!)We can only eat so many Fried Green Tomatoes! This was a refreshing substitute. Will try it on chicken and pork.

Quick, easy and really delicious. If I had paid money for this in a restaurant, I'd have considered myself lucky.

The first time we prepared it as written and served it with grilled salmon. Excellent. The second time we had no green tomatoes or chiles, so we used tomatillos (available at Mexican markets and some supermarkets) and served it with seared scallops. Fabulous!

Very tasty. Striped bass is a delicious fish and the salsa adds a nice summer freshness. I used yellow cherry tomatoes since i couldn't find green tomatoes.

This recipe was wonderful!! I made it with Bass last night and the salsa was so good we had it over chicken tonight. If you want to make the salsa in advance just leave out the lime and salt till right before serving. I did not think it was too salty.

Excellent recipe. We used mahi, and did not include the seeds of the chile. Cook from Maryland, your green tomatoes must have had more sodium than ours, because we needed to add salt. We had pasta on the side, dressed with a sauce of garlic, ginger, parsley, lemon, and butter. Delicious dinner.

I served the salsa over grilled pork chops and it was very, very nice. The salsa was too salty for my taste (I'd maybe start with a scant 1/2 teaspoon and work up from there). I also thought that it could use a little more heat. I chickened out on adding all the seeds from the serrano to the mix, but I think I did it a disservice. We'll make this again and definitely try the bass.

Very lovely and summery!!!! No green tomatoes in this part of the world so I used yellow cherry tomatoes.
