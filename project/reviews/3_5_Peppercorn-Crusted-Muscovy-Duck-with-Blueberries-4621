The sauce got gummy and thick. My dinner guests said they liked it, but I think they were just being nice.

We love this recipe, and served it at our son's wedding. The caterer has used it since then.

This recipe is spectacular - great flavour balance between the duck and the fruit sauce, without too much sweetness in the sauce. I modified it slightly, by using a bit less dried fruit (selected apricots and cranberries, incidentally) - around 3/4 cup instead of a full cup - and I did part of the sauce reduction during the re-heating process to get the blueberries and other berries more homogeneously mixed into the flavour. My fiancée and I agreed that it was great - and very simple, to boot. Served with a bit of buttered sourdough and lightly buttered / Parmesan-ed fettuccine on the side - glorious!

Absolutely succulent sauce. Because my small college town doesn't have a store that carries duck, I had to make due with chicken breasts. Yes, some cooks would consider it a travesty, but when you are a budget, you gotta do what you gotta do. After going heavy on the fruit and adding a bit more ginger, I followed the advice of a previous suggestion and pureed the sauce after letting it stand for thirty minutes. Excellent color and much more aesthetically appetizing. Port was also an imperative additive. Consider the ripeness of your blueberries before tossing them in; some guests did not enjoy the imbalance of the tartness (not in season) and the sweetness of the sauce. I heavily peppered the chicken and cooked with a bit of butter; the end result was both attractive and tasty. Served with cooked spinach with cranberries and almonds and roasted fingerlings. A hit amongst my peers. No one complained about the lack of duck. Don't be afraid to use this sauce with chicken; its richness would definitely compliment duck beautifully, but it was not a loss on chicken either.

I have made this twice once was fantastic the other time was good. The taste of the sauce varied greatly...I am not sure what I did differently.

An excellent recipe for your next special occasion. My friends (and myself) are still talking about it!

I thought the nightmare of dried fruits, coupled with a massive amount of blueberries, would make the sauce a little confused. Rather than using matchstick-cut dried fruit, I used whole dried fruit but then strained the sauce after the 30 minutes getting-to-know-you period. What's good about the sauce is that it is a bold, brazen sauce that is in-your-face to the duck. This is necessary. But I thought the blueberries ended up being a little over the top - I wondered where the whipped cream was to complete the dessert. I would probably stick to one of the port-cherry or blackberry dishes on this website for future duck endeavours. I have no real comments about the duck preparation method other than to say that I found that earlier review about the method of duck preparation taught in Paris to be ostentatious. So, what you're saying is that you cook the fat side for 9 minutes instead of the 15 minutes called for? If only I too could learn from those culinary geniouses in France.

I made this dish this past weekend for 10 people and I doubled the ingredients. After making the sauce, I didn't like the consistency of all the dried fruit in there, plus it was watery, so I pureed it in the food processor. It became nice and thick, so I wound up adding more chicken stock to get it to the right consistency. I also added about a half cup of port wine during the reduction process. I added the blueberries at the end, but left out the butter completely since it was nice and thick. I used mostly dried mango for the fruit, along with some dried cranberries, prunes and apricots. I also scored the duck in a criss cross pattern with a razor knife. Everyone wants the recipe!

This recipe was incredibly easy to prepare and the flavor was excellent. Special-occasion worthy. I had to sub Moullard breasts for Muscovy and I used fresh blueberries otherwise followed the recipe. I did take other reviewers suggestion and cooked breasts in a cold cast iron pan and the results were excellent. Very crispy and medium rare inside. Excellent recipe, will make again.

Excellent way to prepare duck. I too start this in a cold pan, after scoring the fat and cook for about 10 minutes before turning. A bit of port in the sauce is a wonderful addition. Usually serve it with basmati rice that has a few chopped scallions thrown in at the last minute. Yum.

This was relatively easy and quite good. I too used a cold pan, scored the skin and the result was a beautifully crispy skin when cooked at a moderately high temp. To make this easier, I boiled down the sugar/H20, added the blueberries and further reduced, mixing in the only half of the butter and grated ginger. total time 30 minutes and outstanding for a weeknight meal.

Someone has a duckomplex, don't let that detract anyone from making this. I agree that the duck should be started in a cold, cast iron skillet, but that does not make the recipe flawed (actually it sounds like someone never made the recipe to begin with). I've made this before and added a bit of port to the blueberries and everyone loved it. Watch out and don't let the fat brown too much. Score the fat on the duck before cooking.

This recipe is flawed. While it is interesting to read and sounds like it will be good, the technique for cooking the duck breast is all wrong. To do this properly, make sure that the duck breast is patted dry, so you won't have alot of splatters, then season with salt and pepper. Then place the duck breast in a cold pan to sear it. Turn on the heat to medium high. Set your timer for 9 minutes and cook on the fat side. As it gets further into the 9 minutes, start to pick up the breast to check that the fat is not burning. If it is getting toooo dark, lower the heat. At 9 minutes, drain the fat and turn the duck breast over and cook on medium high heat for 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and let sit covered with foil to retain the heat and have the juices return stay in the meat when you slice it. When ready to cut, cut on the diagonal (at an angle), slicing into the breast with the fat side on top. The breast should be rosy inside like a medium rare steak. This is how I learned to cook duck breast in France. It is easy and fool proof. If you are cooking Peking Duck breast you need to adjust the cooking time to compensate for how much smaller the Peking Duck breast is.

Made this the first time on the barbeque cooking the duck on a cast-iron pan and it came out great. Works just as well on the stove. We generally used dried prunes and apricots for the sauce, but one time we used the dried fruit from some trail mix and that was delicious as well. Works best with true muscovy duck since the breasts are bigger.

Absolutely fabulous. Do not - repeat do not - forget your spatter screen, though! We served this with wild rice risotto. Mmmmmm.

I prepared this twice for small dinner parties since the duck breasts are still so expensive and it needs to be cooked at the last minute. The sauce is wonderful and everyone always raves about this recipe!

Mistake 1: This is not a weight watcher's special like a chicken breast. I forgot how much fat is in duck skin. Mistake 2: I didn't put a splatter holder over the searing breasts and had quite a job afterward. But this is a good dinner. I'm looking for hints on how to test for doneness. Mine came out a little more done than I hoped. The sauce my husband first rejected as sweet but when paired with the duck was perfect. He loved it and said it was wonderful. I served it w/ Near East Creative Grains.

I made this for a quiet Christmas dinner for two, and it was wonderful. We used apricots, figs, and dried cranberries as well as the blueberries. Watch the cooking sugar carefully...we burnt our first batch!

Made the sauce for Christmas dinner. Rating the sauce only - outstanding!!! My husband did grill two whole ducks on our outside grill which is like an oven & maintains a constant temp of 350 degrees - he only used salt/pepper seasoning on the ducks - they came out terrific, so moist and tender not greasy at all. BUT I received rave reviews on the sauce what an award winner - we will definitely make it this sauce again. I used dried pineapple, banana, prunes, payaya, apicots and the blueberries. Fantastic!!!

A fabulous, tender, malt in your mouth recipe. I made this for my husband and me. I'm happy that I didn't make this for guests, only because we devoured every last bite. Our guests wouldn't have gotten any.

My husband loves the duck we have on vacation in the South of France. Found a place that sells decent magrets near here (Trader Joes). We both absolutely loved this recipe. Next time, I'll put in only half the amount of fruit (too much for a 2 person recipe). Can't wait to make it again, hopefully at Christmas for the inlaws.

I am only rating the sauce here, as I use it over rare sliced pepper-crusted filet mignon, but the sauce is superb. I like using mixed berries and cherries for the dried fruit. My only alteration is to add 1/4 cup tawny port and 1 tbsp sugar and simmer a little more, just before adding the butter and blueberries. Spectacular!

This is a really fabulous recipe! The sauce is wonderful - and not at all sweet as one would assume from reading the ingredient list. I bought a package of blueberries that pictured what looked like American blueberries, but alas, it contained the European variety - (purple, not white, insides that stain like crazy) everyone had purple teeth after dinner!

This recipe is outstanding. Instead of pan frying the duck, I grilled it (spectacular flames; barely controlled arson), and served it for Thanksgiving dinner. Even the hardline traditionalists raved.

I actually got a standing ovation from my dinner guests. Recipe is perfect and the off setting flavors of the peppercorns and fruit sauce are sensational.
