These are yummy. Some previous reviews described them as bland, but I used salted butter--perhaps that helped. I also used leftover cranberry sauce (which I pureed a bit) in place of the preserves. As for the yield, the recipe produced 30 cookies.

These are my favorite cookies. They are fabulous I usually skip the dusting of powdered sugar, just because I like them a bit more rustic. Yum!

These cookies are delicious!! I used pecans instead of walnuts, all butter (no shortening), and dark brown sugar instead of light, and they turned out fine. They didn't make as many as the recipe said.When I make them again, I will be sure to make smaller cookies (they spread out a lot with the nuts, being pressed, and being filled with jam). I didn't have the problem others have mentioned about them cracking..possibly because of my use of all butter. Unsweetend raspberry jam is the best in these (no sugar added, just sweetbess from the fruit itself)- it makes the cookies a perfect combination of sweet, oaty, and tart.

These were really amazing. The certainly didn't make 36 cookies. I know we ate some cookie dough but surely not half of it! 18 cookies, lots of leftover nuts and preserves. I would definitely make again, probably a double recipe.

Cookies spread out like pancakes, even after refrigerating dough overnight (which I always do with cookies). Tasted very good. Next time would try lower temp, smaller cookies.

This is a tough one to write. The cookies that come out are tasty and present well. That said, this is one crumbly cookie that is really tough to get any consistency. Out of 13 dozen made, we probably had no less than two dozen that didn't look good enough to use for a cookie exchange. The cookies are quite delicate. The cookies have a tendancy to crack while baking and provide the preserves with an escape.

After tasting this cookie, my 4 yr old hugged me & told me I deserved a kiss. My husband said he could eat the whole tray. The toasty shortbread flavor with the hint of jam make it impossible to stop at one. I made these at our cabin, so had to make do with the ingredients on hand - substituted canola oil for the shortening & Pecans for Walnuts. It made the dough a bit sticky, but floured my hands & it was fine. I thought there was too much pecan mixture at first, but actually ran out. Used a variety of jellies, which made the presentation very colorful.

These were really good. You could easily use any jam you have on hand for variety. They were light without being crumbly and the perfect amount of sweetness.

Varied it a bit - used whole wheat flour, added flax meal and reduced the butter, and rolled the cookies in ground hazelnuts instead of walnuts. Very easy and tasty cookie.

Really great flavor and texture. I did have some trouble processing the walnuts - the result was sticky and didn't adhere to the dough evenly. However, you couldn't tell that at all from the finished product. I did the full cooking time and a little more, but my oven runs a little cool.

From reading the reviews I thought this recipe would be a winner. Sad to say it probably ranks in the top 10 worst cookie recipes I have ever made. The cookie is bland, too crumbly and greasy and spreads too much. If I were to make this again these are the changes I would make: Reduce the amount of shortening; increase the sugar just a little; switch the amounts on the flour and oats. Too many oats. Love oats - just too many here. Add 1 teaspoon almond extract. Hopefully, this will remedy the greasiness and the bland flavor.

These cookies always turn out very tasty. They also work well with other types of preserves.

I left off the walnuts because my son is allergic - still fantastic! I agree with other comments about over-cooking. Definitely worth a try, and not hard to make at all.

Great cookies, and they looked nice for Valentines Day! I used pecans instead of walnuts. Cook no longer than 14 minutes on dark nonstick pan, or 16 minutes on a baking stone.

Also cooked less than recipe called for. My husband's co-workers were fighting over these--they LOVED them!

The cookies turned out great! Just the right combination of sweetness and saltiness, and a great texture. Don't cook too long though, take out of the oven when the just start to brown. Used cherry jam instead and the recipe was still great.
