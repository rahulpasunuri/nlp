I have made this many times- always for dinner parties in summer. It is the perfect ending to a heavy meal. I always make a sauce out of blueberries or blackberries- to drizzle on the plate which I think it needs. I am only sad that I think I've made it for everyone and must come up with a new finale!

This is a delightful hot summer dessert. Personally I skipped the sugar in the jelly, the fruit was sweet enough without it and the crisp flavor of the Prosecco was just right. The candied orange peel, while an attractive touch, needed serious reworking to avoid crystallization. It was definitely worth the effort to modify the recipe.
