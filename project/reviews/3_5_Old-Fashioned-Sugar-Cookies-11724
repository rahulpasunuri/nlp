Very very salty. This recipe is an epic fail. Please take this recipe off this site so that others do not follow it and are just as much disappointed as i am.

I wish I had read the reviews before I made these cookies. There is too much baking soda and salt in these cookies. I also had a hard time rolling them out, but they did fine rolling rounded tablespoons.

Very good! I used shortening, and rolled out the chilled dough, used cookie cutters, then froze the cookies for about 15 mins to keep them from spreading out while baking. Tasted great, doubled the vanilla and it gave a great flavor.

Followed the recipe as written. Came out too salty. Can also see why others indicate to cut down on the baking soda. Dough was dry and crumbly and hard to work with.

Rating: 3
While these cookies taste good when made as written, this is definitely not a cutout cookie dough. I made this dough to make snowflake cookies, and, with al of the baking soda, they puffed out and my snowflakes ended up looking like fat flowers; all the detail of the snowflakes was lost. Additionally, the dough was dry and crumbly and very difficult to work with. I would go for a different sugar cookie recipe next time.

I think this is a decent sugar cookie recipe, assuming you read the reviews beforehand. I reduced the baking soda to 1.5 teaspoons, and just used a dash of salt. I can't imagine that the recipe would need anymore than that. my cookies came out of the oven golden brown on the edges and chewy in the middle. I also think that this is a great cookie recipe to use if you plan to decorate with frosting, as the cookie itself is not overwhelmingly sweet (for a sugar cookie!). The dough takes no time to prepare, so I think I would make these again.

This is my all time favorite sugar cookie recipe. Easy! I also cut back the soda to 1 t. No other changes necessary.

This recipe is simple to make but taste is only okay in my opinion. I used butter instead of shortening and cut baking soda in half per other reviewers recs. I thought they still tasted salty/of baking soda. I scooped tablespoonsof dough, rolled into ball, rolled in sugar and mashed with bottom of a glass. That works fine and speeds up process although I'm sure cutouts could be more festive. Overall, I think there are better recipes and would probably not make this one again.

Ditto on cutting the baking soda. I did like this recipe b/c it was easy for my 4 year old to do most of it. I didn't roll any. I had my daughter scoop balls with a tablespoon and mash it with a glass. She loved it.

Rating: 2
This was only ok. They were easy to make, but the dough was really sticky when I laid it out to roll. I had to add a ton of flour just to roll it out so it wouldnt stick. Unfortunately, since I had to add so much flour, the finished cookies taste too much like flour. I decorated the cookies with frosting and even that couldnt hide the flour-y taste of these cookies. Will be looking for a new sugar cookie recipe to use instead of this one.

Great classic cookie. Everyone raved about them. As other's have suggested after first following the directions exactly, I made a second batch using less baking soda, 1 1/2 v 2 tsp... less is best. These are easy and for the holidays are easily made festive with the use of colored sugar.

I have been making these every Christmas since this recipe came out in 1993 (as well as Easter and St Patrick's Day and Valentine's Day and any other holiday where you can make a themed sugar cookie). It's the best one I've found and depending upon how thin you roll them (and I roll them paper thin) you can get a ton of cookies. I use butter instead of shortening because I like the taste and texture of butter. But if you are making intricate cut out cookies, then definitely use shortening or a combination of butter and shortening so that the cookies stay hearty.

I used lard (because I can't find vegetable shortening here in Eastern Europe). The cookies are ok, but hard as a rock. I won't be doing it the same next time.

Just a suggestion: I haven't tried this recipe yet, but I wonder what substituting 1 cup of the flour with self-rising flour - and then omitting the baking soda - would do? In my mind, this should work well, and NO bad aftertaste problem!

11 YR OLD IN MADISON: I cut the backing soda in half. It left a taste, but it wasn't bad. I used 1/4c white sugar and 1/4c brown. I didn't roll them in sugar, either. They were a little dry. I've tasted better cookies, but they weren't bad. I'd make it again, but NOT for company. : )

Even though I reduced the baking soda by 1/3, I could still taste the soda, and not only in the background. I mean these cookies turned out naaasty. However, I will try to make these again with only 1tsp of soda, and see how they turn out. Maybe i'll even use 1/2 tsp soda and 1/2 tsp baking powder.

Awful, easy to make, looked great in the oven. Way too dry for me, and the taste, too much salt or baking soda or both, very dissapointed

Rating: 3
Soooo easy! And very tasty. Take the other reviewers' advice about the baking soda, tho; cutting it by 1/2 tsp improves the flavor immensely but doesn't affect the size or texture of the cookie. Also, I used all butter and had a very easy time with the dough.

This recipe is so good I wanted to comment for the sake of those who haven't tried it yet. Don't hesitate. It's an old fashion recipe but it will work great in a modern kitchen as well - just use your hand mixer to blend the ingredients. You won't have to melt the shortening and butter, just bring it to room temperature, blend with the sugar until light and fluffy (like a modern recipe), add egg, vanilla and then blend the remaining ingredients. You won't need as much baking soda to get the cookies to stand up, and you won't need to chill the dough either because the shortening has not been melted. The baking soda in the past tasted better than what we have today, so use 1 1/2 teaspoons but change nothing else. This recipe is absolutely delicious. Noone cannot like these cookies! There is another old fashion recipe on this site that got a bad rap. Vanilla cherry pie. The recipe calls for several tablespoons of vanilla - which commercial vanilla will ruin - but with old-fasion homemade vanilla, I won blue ribbon at the fair. Yeah, I'm turning into my grandmother :)

I doubled the recipe for a cookie swap but didn't double the baking soda per other reviewers. Added a dash of fresh nutmeg, these were great. Would even be good without the roll in sugar and just frost them.

Great cookies! We doubled the recipe for a school bake sale using only butter (we were out of shortening), and used 3 teaspoons of baking soda for the double batch (per other reviewers' opinions that there was too much). Warning - they just about double in size during cooking, which was perfect for us - we sold out at 50 cents a cookie!!

I found these hard to roll out, a bit crumbly, but they tasted great. I added tsp almond extract.

The cookies were great. After reading the reviews I made the following adjustments - cut the baking soda to 1 tsp and added 1 tsp tartar; added 1/2 tsp nutmeg. We also made variations from the base, like one were we "stuffed" the cookie with mince meat filling...yum. Will use the modified recipe over and over again!

Rating: 3
Very good recipe. I halved the amount of baking soda and replaced it with cream of tartar. I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon. As an added treat, I topped each cookie with a walnut half dipped in homemade caramel before baking. When they baked, the caramel partially melted into the cookie and the walnut sunk down a bit into the center. So good.

Great cookies. Since we live in Romania right now, this recipe is great since it does not have American baking specifics like brown sugar which does not exist everywhere. Enjoy!

Rating: 3
This is a good "master recipe" for old-style cookies. Some cooks mention the taste (presumably from the soda). I use 1/2 the soda called for and a pinch of cream of tartar, solid veg shortening (I like Crisco bricks), and I use vanilla AND almond (50/50) for the flavoring, and nutmeg. I use "superfine" sugar to roll the dough balls in. This combo makes a great "snickerdoodle", slightly crisp on the edges but chewy & toothsome overall. HMMM...I guess that makes it a different recipe, doesn't it??!

Made the recipe with butter and margarine. Texture was good, strong after taste from the baking soda--will cut to 1 tsp next time and maybe increase the vanilla. I like crisp cookies with just a little bit of chewyness in the middle. These were ok--not great but maybe if I play with the fat types I'll be able to get them the way I like them. Also I'd make the balls bigger than the tablespoon sized balls to get slightly oversized cookies.

I made these cookies for my father-in-law who's a huge fan of sugar cookies. Having never made sugar cookies before, I was anxious to find out how they would turn out, especially with the mixed reviews. Well, they turned out GREAT! I used regular Crisco (not butter-flavored), decreased the baking soda to 1 tspn. and added a dash of nutmeg (as my great-grandmother's recipe called for). I refridgerated the dough for about an hour, then formed it into balls as the recipe called for. They baked for 10 minutes and turned out crunchy on the outside and just a bit chewy on the inside. I liked them, but next time will add a little more nutmeg and cook for about a minute less.

I have been on the hunt for a good sugar cookie recipe for a few months. This recipe was easy to make. I liked that it required no mixer because the last sugar cookie recipe I tried burned the motor in my handheld mixer. It also was delicious. However, rolling out the dough was very difficult and time consuming. It fell apart into a big crumbly mess any time I touched it. Maybe if I rolled it into the balls they suggested it might be easier, but trying to do cookie cut-outs was nearly impossible. So, the hunt continues...

Rating: 3
I really liked these! I used vegetable shortening, not lard. And I used margarine instead of butter which worked fine, except I didn't use unsalted so the cookies came out a bit salty... I doubled the recipe, they were a hit and were gone in two days! Make sure you let them cool before taking them off the pan.

Rating: 3
Pretty good, a little too crispy for my taste. I usually like my sugar cookies soft and chewy. Thanks for the cook who introduced the "1/4 teaspoon baking soda for 1 cup flour" rule. The cookies had no problem rising a little. One glitch- I halved the recipe to make a test batch, and had difficulty getting the dough to form. I used an extra half egg to get the dough to bind, so surprise- the cookies turned out a little eggy. Any tips from fellow cooks? Should I add extra butter, shortening, or just water next time?

My 8 year old son has claimed this as "his" recipe now. It's a great recipe to make with a kid--I roll 'em, he sugars 'em. Really outstanding! We added a bit of red food coloring for Valentine's Day. Make a lot--they get eaten as soon as they come out of the oven:)

Wonderful cookies...will be my "new" Old Fashioned Sugar Cookie recipe. Simple, easy to make, nice consistancy, great flavor. I did read all of the reviews and made a couple of changes. Absolutely just use 1 teaspoon of Baking Soda. Overnight chilling is too much. One hr. would be fine..I made a small batch without chilling just to test, was fine, just easier to roll when chilled a bit. Overall a great Sugar Cookie! An improvement on my "old" recipes..This is a keeper.

These are always a favorite for family gatherings (my mother always requests them whenever she's visiting). I agree that they are hard to roll out, so I allow the dough to come to near-room temp after its overnight "rest." A delicious treat!

I regret making this recipe before reading the reviews. I completely wasted the ingredients on a disgusting cookie. No one in their right mind would make this recipe as-is unless they were trying to cure a sour stomach (with all that baking soda) I may try this again, if I get up enough courage - and of course with less baking soda.

The main plusses of this recipe were the fact that I had all the ingredients on hand and how easy they were to make. I used veg shortening and tasted the same bacon-y aftertaste that someone else mentioned. Actually, I'd describe it as more of a pre-taste smell.

I've tried several different cookie doughs for cut-outs and this is by far the best. The dough is easy to work with, just make sure to follow the instruction of chilling the dough before rolling it out. The cookie is absolutely delicious. Most recipes are not very tasty but these are perfectly buttery tasting and yet they rise and do not turn out flat because of all the butter. A definite hit and a keeper in my family.

Also cut the baking soda in half - thanks for the heads up. These were great, and quick to throw together. Have not tried the lard route yet, but they were fine with shortening. My kids ate almost all the dough before it was cooked!

Since I've never baked, I was worried that my first try would yeild inedible scraps. This recipe was simple and good. I rolled the balls in green and red sugars before baking. The cookies do have an aftertaste, maybe that's the soda. I will use less next time. These aren't to die for, but maybe that's my fault. But they're easy and tasty and are perfect for mothers of young children who are just learning how to work in the kitchen.

Cookies are a bit to sweet, I would use less sugar. This recipe should not use baking soda. All ingredients are sweet. Baking powder should be used instead of baking soda then there would be no sour taste.

I followed the recipe exactly except I put the dough in the freezer for an hour and jumped in the shower and got ready for a visit with friends (needed instant gratification ;-) Well, I got it! The cookies were perfect! I made them for a spur of the moment, you have two hours to throw yourself and something lovely to take to someone's home together kind of thing tonight, and it was perfect. I made the dough, threw it in the freezer for an hour, jumped in the shower, got myself ready, and then made the cookies, tossed them in a tin, and off we went! Before we left our friend's home, they were going on and on about how they just couldn't find the time to bake. Ha ha! These were scrumptious, and took so little time to make! Perfect cookies!

I made this with my neice and nephew. We also used only half the baking soda, and they tasted just like we were hoping. We used an ice cream scooper to get a nice ball of chilled dough and the kids warmed it in their hands by squeezing it and that worked well. We added a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the rolling sugar and the kids liked that. That way the recipe only yielded about 20 cookies.
