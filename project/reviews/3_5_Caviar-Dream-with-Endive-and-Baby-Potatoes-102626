This was easy and delicious - what I didn't do was realize that the recipe was for 30 servings, though I had 8 people over for Christmas dinner, I had to throw half of this away the next day - I'll half the recipe next time since it is relatively fatting and not really good for leftovers. I also served the caviar on the side since i thought the dipping would quickly dilute the caviar in the dip.

I made the sauce, and served it with a separate bowl of caviar and little toasts. It was a terrific appetizer for New Year's Eve dinner last year, and I will do it again this year...with Champagne, of course! I like it because it's an easy way to mix all of the good accoutrements for caviar (shallots, sour cream, egg, chives) and have it not fall off the toast as it does when they are offered separately. (For purists, you can offer simply sweet butter.) Yum! My mouth is watering at the thought......

This recipe was very easy to prepare. The potatoes were delicious; prepared the day before. The sauce was very good, and frankly, my guests ate almost every portion I put out, but I used good caviar both as a dollop and as a side dish, and found they didn't eat the accompanying caviar...I think it's too expensive for its impact. Wouldn't do this recipe again.
