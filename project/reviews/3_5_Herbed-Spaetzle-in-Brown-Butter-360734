Great recipe. My batch turned out a little salty. Make sure to taste for seasoning. Definitely make sure to add the lemon juice. Boyfriend loved it.

I'm not providing a rating for the recipe as I did not make it in its entirety (I omitted the spinach and radicchio); the spaetzle were a fun and delicious alternative to the more typical starches one would serve. A word of warning though, not all low-sodium broth is created equal; my batter required only 1 1/2 tsp salt...the spaetzle would have been inedible with 2 1/2 tsp. Also, I used only 2 tbsp butter to saute the noodles. Definitely worth repeating.

I used this as a perfect opportunity for 'use up the herbs in my kitchen' spaetzle. I used dill instead of thyme, and arugula instead of sage, and it turned out deliciously. The sqeezed lemon at the end of the recipe brought out the dill flavor very nicely. Also, instead of spinach and radicchio, I just used up the arugula. Good sub, for sure. To go with the light "lemon/dill" theme, the spaetzle was served with Tuna Schnitzel (cooked to medium rare), topped with a small arugula sald dressed in lemon juice and olive oil. I must say that, altogether, the flavors blended stunningly. Note: BIG batch of spaetzle! It really can easily serve six - with leftovers.
