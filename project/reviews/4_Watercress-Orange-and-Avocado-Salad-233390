This dressing is amazing - what a bizarre combination of ingredients. Served on mixed greens, avocado, watermelon radishes, oranges. Didn't have red cabbage, just put sauteed red onions on top. Looked beautiful. Dinner entree was ham/onion quiche.

I think this salad is all about the special dressing. I used a bit of extra pomegranate juice + a bit of sugar, instead of the molasses. I also just roasted the onion slices with the garlic and a little oil in the oven, rather than fussing with the separate broiling and sauteing. Otherwise I stuck to the dressing recipe. For the actual salad, I just used baby arugula, orange, and avocado (no cabbage, etc.) It was still so unusual and lovely. I'm sure the original recipe is even better, but even with simplifications and cheaper ingredients, this deserves four forks.

Used a Pomelo instead of orange. Everyone was very pleased. A fine XMAS salad.

i used fresh chopped garlic and onions instead of cooking them first and i thought it was much better. i served this at my parents christmas party and it was a huge hit. delicious!

Good salad, but a fair amount of work. There's more to it than just chop-and-drop. When I first made the dressing earlier in the day, it was WAY too hot from the Serranos. However, a couple of hours later when I went to dress the salad, the heat had dissapated, and the dressing was lovely.

This salad was positively yum - and I'm not a huge salad lover most of the time. The only substitution I made was pomegranate molasses for regular molasses. I mean really - who has time to hunt that down three days before Christmas? My husband and I both loved this salad and happily ate every bite. Can't wait to enjoy it again.

Oh, how I wish to have that salad, here in dominican rep we can't find pomegranates.

This made a terrific meal, with some pan-sauteed shrimp added. The dressing is wonderfully sweet-tart with the pomegranate, lime and hot peppers (I used habaneros -- just s smidge). I went ahead and roasted the garlic cloves but I think I could just as well have used some of my roasted garlic puree. Make this when you can get really nice fresh watercress!

Complex, yet light and refreshing. Made this for Xmas dinner for 12 together with standing rib roast with porcini gravy, white cheddar cheese puffs, roasted root vegetables, devilled egg and caviar starter. Lots of work, but quite original and worth it for a special occasion.
