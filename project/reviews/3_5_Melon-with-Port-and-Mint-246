guests always love this. I bring it places too. always get raves. Summer time and holiday time too if you can ripen the melon. I use honeydews and add chunks of blue cheese. It is amazing!

This was wonderfully flavorful! I used a cheap port and you couldn't tell. It got rave reviews!

Yummy! But it worked better with honey dew than cantalope (sp?).

I liked this a lot - especially when I tested it just after making it. After dinner, and loads of wine, it wasn't so obvious just how nice the port is in there. oops!

While -I- didn't care for it so much (I thought it was a little too syrupy/sweet), I still found it quite yummy, and my guests raved and raved. It was a perfect accompanyment for an asparagus and greyere tart I made. Light and yummy. Next time, more port, less sugar syrup, but it's definately on my "repeat" rotation list.

This is an outstanding summer dessert. I served this at the end of a cocktail party where I served all finger foods. I cut the melon into chunks and served it with toothpicks. It was such a nice, refreshing treat on a hot night, and it even went well with cocktails.

It's amazing how something so simple and with so few ingredients could taste so delicious. I prepared this for a tennis team picnic and it went over very well. Used fresh mint from my garden and steeped syrup for only 2 hours. I also used a melon baller instead of slicing. Am happy to find another use for port that otherwise just ages in my cabinet.

i made this for a dinner party and it was a hit...i thought the port and mint added a refreshing and light flavor that enhanced the taste of the melon without overpowering.

I prepared this for a large dinner party and it was a definite hit as a refreshing side dish. Leftovers also last well.
