This flan is so silky and delicious! It is incredibly easy to make too. The hardest part is spreading the carmelized sugar, but don't fret about it. Spread as best you can before it hardens, and pour the custard over it. Once its done, that carmelized sugar turns into a wonderful sauce for the flan.

love the flavor and consistency- it does need a bigger pan to cook in. I put foil on top to keep it from getting too browned. I find it takes longer than an hour to cook in order to set. maybe the eggs don't need to be separated because the egg whites rise to the top.

Okay. This has a 3 1/2 rating and I don't know how it earned it. The amount of liquid (based on the can sizes i have available in my area) makes waaay more than will fit in a 9 inch pie pan. I do see in the reviews that people have various sizes. Amounts are helpful. Can sizes vary... apparently. Because of the "amount of milks" question went with a "custard" ratio of 2:1 for milks/eggs. That turned out VERY eggey. (guess i don't know how to spell that. hm.) anyway... My 7 year old described it as "poached eggs with syrup on top, which tastes good to him." Yikes. It took me 3 tries to caramelize the sugar and to get enough of it to coat the bottom of the pie dishes... and it still didn't turn out very carmelized. Well, unless you count the one that smoked up my kitchen and then glued my wooden spoon to my pan for an hour while it soaked. Too funny. THAT was a first for me. I also ended up with the foamy/weird bottom layer that some of the other reviewers mentioned. Although it was VERY thin it was definitely present. Followed the instructions best I could and I am not a total novice. Although this was my first flan it was not my first custard by any means. And I do a lot of cooking, especially baking and desserts. It just seems like it should have been easier... maybe a few more details in the instructions would have gone a long way. Seems like the writer had a lot of back info that didn't make it onto the page. ??? lol. aaaahhhh... better luck next time, right? :)

I have a question about this recipe. I couldn't find just "condensed milk". Is it "sweetened condensed milk" instead? Please advise.

Excellent recipe! Several people told me it was the best flan they'd ever eaten, and a young Latino told me it tasted just like Grandma's. I did make the following adjustments, some based on other comments: 1. Cook sugar/water mixture WITHOUT STIRRING until a dark amber, almost mahogany. Basically, I burned it. However, the flavor was like that of a marshmallow toasted over coals until crispy-brown on the outside. LOTS of flavor. 2. Preheat pie plate in 250F oven so the caramel stays fluid a little longer while you're swirling it around. 3. Substitute 1 can coconut milk for the evaporated milk. This makes the flan less sweet and--obviously--adds coconut flavor. 4. Omit the vanilla. 5. Cook at a lower temperature (275F or 300F) for a much longer time (2+ hours), until center is set but still jiggles when shaken slightly. I hesitate to actually put a time on it, since I was baking four at once (on three different racks in a non-convection oven, moving them from rack to rack at intervals). 6. Toast 1/2 cup sweetened coconut in a dry skillet until fragrant and lightly browned on the edges. Let cool. Top the unmolded flan with the coconut at least 20 minutes before serving.

I'm not usually a fan of flan, but this was amazing! I made it in 8 individual ramekins, and had to double the caramel sauce (also used 1/4 cup water per 1/2 cup sugar) - and had to hustle to coat them quick before the sauce hardened. I omitted the milk, and didn't separate the eggs - just mixed everything together. I put in the oven (in two glass baking dishes) for 50 minutes, and they came out perfect!! Super easy and very budget conscious!

This recipe is perfect. I served it to my friend from Mexico who said it was the best she'd had outside of her mom's. I usually use glass ramekins rather than the pie dish to create individual servings (still bakes for 45 min). Delicious

Sometimes I have a hard time following recipes, and I had an awful lot going on when I was attempting this one. My major blunder? I left out the extra cup of milk. Imagine my surprise when, after eating it and deciding that it was the -perfect- texture, really rich and creamy (except for the egg-white puff on the top that is very easily removed) and perfectly set, I missed a whole cup of liquid. Really, this recipe does not require it. I made ramekins of flan, instead, and cut the baking time down to about 25 minutes. :D

I am from Mexico, and my mom used to make us Flan, now and then. I totally LOVE flan. I haven't been able to make it since I got to the US because I don't have a pressurized cooking pot. And that is the way she makes it. Anyway, I try this recipe and its ok.. it's tasty but the consistency of this flan is not quite right. I followed the instructions as it is read. The caramel turned out well, I didn't get too much change in color but I knew it was done when it was bubbling a lot and the weird thing to me was whipping the egg whites, I don't remember my mother doing this and I will ask her. But I did it any way... at the end I got what is seams half a flan and the bottom part (the part that was on top while cooking) looks and tastes just like angel food cake (very fluffy and not like a flan at all) Anyway if you take this part off, then you get a good flan... so I am debating wether I should beat the egg whites or not... any suggestions. The top part of the flan.. it was the consistency of a flan, a little bit too soft but it taste really good. I will keep experimenting .... or I will get a pressurized cooking pot. :D

Ok, I reviewed this recipe previously because I was SO frustrated with how inexplicit it was. Now that I've tasted it, I think it is quite good! I left out the milk, and added about 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. My guests LOVED it, and even asked to take some home with them, so it was definitely a hit. However, I'm taking off 1 fork for the bad directions. For anyone else confused about the caramel sauce I'll say this: Cook the sugar and water until it bubbles vigorously, swirling the pan every 30 seconds. If you are using organic sugar, do not expect much color change. Allowed to bubble for a minute or two, until the sugar dissolves. If there are still a few granules of sugar, don't worry because they will dissolve during the baking process. When you pour the caramel sauce into your baking dish, it will cool and harden slightly. Don't worry, this is supposed to happen. I was so worried that I'd ruined the sauce because it didn't stay a liquid as it cooled, but when I got ready to serve the flan and turned it out onto the serving dish, the caramel sauce was perfect.

Rating: 1
I could not figure out how to make the caramel sauce! This recipe is not detailed enough- I made the sauce 3 times and each time I overcooked it without achieving a "deep amber color". I finally learned (from reading other recipes!) NOT to stir the sugar and water, but just to swirl the pan occasionally. That would have been helpful to know the first time! Also, I used organic sugar, which is darker than regular granulated sugar, so maybe that is why I didn't see a change in color. I'll write a separate review once the flan is out of the oven and we've had a chance to taste it, but I can say so far that this recipe needs to be WAY more detailed. Also, how is someone supposed to know how much condensed and evaporated milk is in a "can"?? Measurements, please! Good grief.

Rating: 4
Okay, I goofed. In my review below I stated you shouldn't bother whipping the egg whites, I WAS WRONG! The result will not be a velvety as it should. Please DO whip the whites and then fold in. Sorry for misleading, my intentions were good and the rest of my tips stand true. Thanks.

This recipe is fabulous and easy! I've made it several times over the last few weeks and it is always great. However, there are a few things to know to ensure success: this makes more than a 9" pie plate so prepare 2 - 3 ramekins with caramel as well; don't bother seperating and beating the eggs, its not worth the effort; double the amount of caramel (so you'll have enough for ramekins and lots of syrup for main pie plate); cover the pan with foil after about 30 minutes to prevent over-browning; after 1 hour it will be done even though it may still seem 'wobbly', it will set as it cools. I used 300 ml/10 oz can condensed and 370 ml/12 oz can evaporated milk. Tasty, creamy and very impressive. Enjoy!

Rating: 4
The rule of thumb I know for all custards and flans is that it's 2 large eggs to 1 cup milk (250mL). So if you do use the one cup milk in this recipe, you'd probably want the condensed and evaporated milk to add up to another 8oz cup. If you like a sweeter flan use more condensed milk than evaporated (but stick with the 2:1 proportion). Also, if you like your flan a little richer, you could substitute just the yolks for one or two of the four eggs in this recipe. Bon Appetit! =)

I love it. I don't know how you can mess it up. I used 14oz sweetened and condensed, and a 12oz can of evaporated milk. I used a 8.5x4.5x2.5inch pyrex dish, bake it in a water bath. And I do not beat the egg white, I just mix the 4 eggs with sugar and add the milks. I have done it with eggs beaten, didn't look so good. Good luck, don't hesitate it's delicious and impressive.

I made 2 of these for a Cinco de Mayo party. The first one, made as recipe descriped. Second one, I did not add the 1 cup of milk. When I make this again, and I have been warned that I will be asked to bring this to several parties this summer, I will be omitting the 1 cup of milk. I used a 12/14 cans of the evap and cond milk. Was wonderful! Friends who travel to many latin countries for work said that it was wonderful.

I tried flan for the first time with this recipe and had some of the best flan I've tasted. The only thing I'd change is letting it bake for 1 1/2 hours - 2 instead of 1 because it was not ready after 1 hour. Will use regularly. Adding some cinnamon helps also.

Rating: 1
I had the same set of problems as some of the other cooks - soupy texture, seperation of eggs, and a burnt top. I will stick to flan recipes that involve tempering the eggs before cooking in the oven - the flavor and texture are far better and the results are more reliable.

Loved it!! So easy..so fast..so yummy. Mixed all the custard ingredients together- no need to sparate the eggs. Took 50 min to bake. Unmolded and sliced beautifully. I found the texture was perfect and loved the not too sweet taste. Thanks so much for this great recipe!

This is my family recipe also, with one difference - you don't have to whip the egg whites. Just mix all the ingredients together (I use a hand blender). As far as can sizes I use one 14 oz. can condensed milk and one 12 oz. can evaporated milk. You can use as few as four eggs or as many as eight depending on how creamy you want it. I usually use 4 -5 eggs.

This flan is excellent. I have tried to make flan in the past and failed miserably. I made this recipe for family friends who are Cuban, and they said it had the most traditional flavor they had ever tasted. I used a 9 inch glass pan, carmelized the sugar until a very light amber, then poured it in the glass dish. It continued to cook and get that rich dark amber color. I used the recipe verbatim- ended up cooking it at 325 degrees (using a convection oven) for 50 minutes. I did not wait over night to serve it. It cooled down in about 3 hours. I flipped it into a serving dish and presented beautifully with the caramel pooled around the delicate flan topped that beautiful amber color...excellent

I forgot to mention, I used a rectangular pyrex glass dish, 8.5 x 4.5 x 2.5 work very nicely, much easier to clice and serve than a round pie dish.

Perfect, I too used a 12oz can of evaporated and 14oz can of condensed (and sweetened) milk. I forgot to beat the whites..oops, but didn't seem to affect the recipe. The recipe calls for too much caramel. Much richer than my traditional creme caramel made with just eggs and regular milk. Will do it again and again.

Despite a few of the negative reviews you may read below, this is a wonderful, foolproof recipe. If you're worried about the size of the cans, use this: 1 12-oz can of evaporated milk 1 14-oz of condensed milk 1 cup whole milk This will fill an entire Pyrex glass pie pan. I had five people for dinner, and no flan left. It was excellent, restaurant quality and the recipe could not have been easier. Serve with coffee and the candy-like, Spanish after-dinner liquer "43" (Cuarenta y tres)

The last time I had flan was at an authentic mexican restaurant just north of the border in New Mexico. This was 'ok' at best. Thanks to the other reviewers, "a can" of evap milk and 'a can' of cond milk turned into 5 oz of evap and 14 of condensed. Didn't the writer know that things come in different size cans? Also, do not go with the deep amber on the sugar mixture, go with a light gold as the sugar cooks more in the oven or you'll end up with burnt sugar like I did.

I made this recipe for a dinner party for the first time and got rave reviews. Based on other reviews I used 14 oz. condensed milk, 5 oz. evaporated milk and whole milk. I also decided to make individual servings by making the flan in 8 ea. 6 oz. ramekins. Because of the smaller portions, I reduced the oven temp to 300 and baked them for 1 hour and 10 minutes. Even baking at 300 and on the lowest shelf in the oven still resulted in browning on the top. But it can be easily removed prior to serving. The only problem I had was carmalizing the sugar. The first attempt resulted in the sugar hardening immediately when poured into the ramekins. I was afraid it would not melt during cooking so I remade the sugar this time cooking it til it was light amber. It came out just right. Will make this recipe again!

Rating: 4
If you want the caramel to be softer, you have to cook it over a lower flame. It's all science with sugar! The higher the heat, the tougher the candy. This is a really easy, delicious recipe! I put all the ingredients in a blender, covered it the entire time and it was fabulous. No need to fuss with teh eggs. Have fun!

Rating: 4
To keep the carmel from getting hard, let the sugar cool for just a moment after it has turned the right shade of amber and then add two table spoons of water (or your favorite almond or coconut or peach - you get the idea - liquor) and swirl before adding to the pie pan. I also like to cover the flan with foil before putting it in the water bath and baking it the entire time covered.

My family absolutely loves this recipe and I make it often. It's fabulous with fresh berries! The only problem I have is that most of the caramel hardens.

I have made this dish 3 times - it's always a hit and is so easy to make. Last time I may have over whipped the egg whites b/c they seperated from the mixture and rose to the top. Luckily it wasn't noticed onced I flipped it over and it was still very yummy. A keeper!!

In Honduras, my country of origin, we all know flan. I tried this recipe and my German boyfriend absolutely loved it. In a country where "kuchen" (cake) is loved by all, he has seldom had the chance to try something so exotic, as he described it. Next time I'll try coconut flan-- very popular in tropical Honduras!

This reminds me of LECHE FLAN, a similar dessert popular in the Philippines traditionally prepared using duck eggs (origin is way back during the Spanish colonial times, hence the similarity to the Spanish crema catalana from which the English creme caramel and the French creme brulee evolved). These days chicken eggs are used (farm fresh preferred- makes for a brighter colored flan) as they are easily available and the custard is poured into oval-shaped metallic molds called llaneras. As with any traditional recipe, there are many versions of leche flan. My favorites: A. 6 egg yolks, 1 large can evaporated milk, 1 large can sweetened condensed milk. This makes a melt-in-your mouth flan. B. 6 egg yolks plus 2 eggs, 1 large can evaporated milk, 1 large can sweetened condensed milk. Whole eggs are added for a bit more structure but still tender flan. C. 6 eggs plus 2 yolks, 1 large can evaporated milk, 1 large can sweetened condensed milk. Makes a less rich flan. D. 4 eggs, 1 large can evaporated milk, 1 large can sweetened condensed milk. For a less eggy version. Ingredients are just mixed together using one direction when mixing being careful not to make the mixture bubbly, then preferably strained through a cheesecloth to remove the chalazae especially if using egg whites in the recipe. Caramel prepared as usual. Vanilla extract or a strip of dayap rind (similar to key lime)is added for flavoring. The covered custard mixture is either steamed or baked in a bain marie. This recipe brought back memories of Philippine fiestas and parties. Another wonderful variation of an excellent dessert.

This was an excellent flan. I followed the suggestions of 7ozs. less milk/evaporated milk. I think the person who dropped the milk had the right idea as my mix had more evaporated milk than milk. In that case use 12 oz. can of evaporated milk and 14 oz can of condensed sweetened milk and skip the milk. I consistently cheat one the caramel step and use a caramel sauce.

This was a very good and easy recipe for Flan. Having had this throught my childhood from a spanish mother, it brought back many memories.

I've made this recipe many times and it always is perfect. It's always a hit! To those who have had trouble: be sure to use whole milk, and don't overbeat the eggwhites.

Help!!! Just made this flan and had to toss the whole thing out. Total disater! What am I doing wrong?? It smelled and tasted absolutely wonderful, but it was, just like another reviewer said, all egg whites on top (after I peeled off the crust), and all liquid underneath. AM I beating the egg whites too long? What is the consistency supposed to be like before you fold in the whites? The recipe uses the word "batter." Mine was definitely not what you'd usually call batter. It was much thinner, more like pancake batter. I used the same milks as others who said theirs came out great. Anyone??? I'd ove to try tis again and get it right!

Rating: 4
Excellent! A comment for those who got a dark crust on top of their flan. This is due to excessive heat on top. Your oven is too hot and/or your pan is too high within the oven. If you lower your temperature setting and lower the pan to a lower rack, you will not have a dark crust. In my oven I do it at 300F for 1 hour and 30 min and in the low rack and never get a crust.

I made this for a party last night. The recipe is very easy and it turned out wonderful. Mine cooked for 1 1/2 hours and probably could have used more time because it was a little liquidy. Could be oven problems though. The brown skin that formed on top while baking peeled off easily once it cooled. Everyone commented on the creaminess and one friend offered to pay me to make her another one. A definite success! I love creme brulee and this is very similar to the flavor and texture of that custard. Thanks for the recipe, I'll be making another one soon!

This was a dissaster both times I made it. First I had too much liquid...so I tried again with smaller cans of evaporated milk, and condensed milk...this time, all the egg whites floated to the top and burned. Both times I ended up with a pie plate of slush. Does anyone know of a reliable flan recipe?

I made this dessert for a mexican themed lunch at work. It was a huge hit and was gone in a flash. My first attempt at the caramel resulted in a hard rock of sugar in my saucepan. I then found out that you should not stir the water and sugar as it rapidly boils. Second attemp yielded the dark amber syrup that is desired. All of the custard did not fit in my 9 1/2 inch pie dish; maybe 10 inch would be better. I also had the very dark "crust" on top but that ends up being the bottom so I didn't worry about it. My flan baked 50 minutes and a knife inserted in the center came out clean so I took it out and it was perfectly done. It is rich and smooth and delicious. Everyone at work wants me to make it again next week.

I made this recipe for a mexican themed party and I was extremely impressed at how good it was. It was certainly a big hit, (very velvety and rich with a great caramel flavor.) I used a 14 oz can of sweetened cond. milk and a 5 oz can of evaporated milk and it came out perfect. Also, it did take about 1 hr 20 min to bake, and it was still very jiggly... but firm around the edges. A dark skin formed on the top as it baked, but it peeled right off after the flan had cooled and did not effect the taste. I will definitely make this dessert again.

I prepared this Flan even though some commented that amounts were not specified . . . i used an 8 ounce can of condensed milk and a 12 ounce can of evaporated milk. I think this is what Sarah meant when she said "typical size." Also, my first attempt at carmelizing the sugar failed . . . i went to another receipe from another site, and used that one. I took one cup of sugar, and heated it (with no water)until the sugar carmelized. This took about eight minutes, another step (amount of time)that the original receipe fails to mention. As for the taste, the flan was very, very good . . more than two forks, not quite four!! Enjoy!

As another review mentioned, the amounts required aren't listed for the milks, so I too used what was available, with terrible results. The custard was way too soupy and never set, even after 2 hours in the oven. It did smell great though!! I'm going to attempt another recipe tonight, the Pistachio-topped version. It appears to have less liquid and more eggs, so it should set(I hope).
