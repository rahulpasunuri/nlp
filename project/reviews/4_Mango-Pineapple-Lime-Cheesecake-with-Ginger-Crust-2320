This is a delicious cheesecake. 3 stars instead of 4 because the top of my cheesecake turned very dark brown and cracked around the edges. I think that another reviewer had the same problem. The filling is very creamy with just the right amount of lime. My husband is not a big fan of fresh fruit so I followed another reviewer's suggestion and made a fruit salad of mango, kiwi, pineapple, guava jelly and mint. I garnished the top of the cake with guava jelly, chopped macadamia nuts and chopped cyrstallized ginger and whole macadamia nuts around the edges. I'll make again next time but will try a water bath and maybe reduced oven temp.

This was amazing! So light in taste, the hint of lime was perfect. For the topping I made a fruit salsa out of drained canned pineapple chunks, mandarins, mango which I large-diced and piled really high on the whole top. Then I put chopped macadamias around the edge, and slivered crystallized ginger in the centre. It is on the epicurious Facebook page. Loved this!

I found there wasn't enough crumb base mixture to go all the way up the sides of the pan, and, in common with other reviewers, that 8 minutes was too long to set the crust - 6 would have been better. I cut the sugar in the filling to 1 cup and that was sweet enough. It was fine, we enjoyed it, but it wasn't anything special and I am deleting it from my recipe box.

it wasn't a big hit at my party. It was kind of chunky inside, more like Italian cheesecake.

This is honestly the best cheesecake I've ever tasted. I used ricotta as well as cream cheese, omitted the pineapple, and used plain cookies with fresh raw ginger and no nuts in the crust. Most importantly, I used a third of the sugar called for and the cake was still very sweet and delicious.

We love ginger, so we almost doubled the ginger in the crust. It had a wonderful flavor, not over powering at all. The cheesecake it self had a great lime kick. Blotted the fruit on a paper towel first so the cheesecake wouldn't get soggy. Huge hit at the family BBQ!

I have made this cheesecake so many times and had so many beg me to make it again, that I felt compelled to rate it online. It's a total winner, and perfect for a hot summer night. The tang of the fruit and ginger married with the creaminess of the cheesecake makes even the most die hard of dessert deniers come back for more.

I made this recipe for a Luau in a mini cheesecake pan. I halved the filling recipe and made whole crust baking it for 6-7 minutes @ 350 degrees, then turned down oven temperature to 275 degrees filling cups 3/4 full aked for 30 minutes. It made 2 dozen perfect mini tropical cheescakes that my guests thought were divine!

I had to admit, I was skeptical about this cheesecake since the top of mine turned very dark brown (maybe I did something wrong). I fixed that with a serrated knife, though and topped the cake with mango, mandarin oranges and (canned) pinapple. It was a hit. Everyone loved the texture and flavours of the cake. Definitely a keeper and a nice twist on your traditional heavy cheesecake. Yum!

Very good, will make again with some changes. Crust didn't really taste of ginger enough to me, and ginger isn't even one of my favorites. I'd add some ground ginger for a little more zing. Texture of cheesecake was very smooth (unlike the uneven texture mentioned below) and the cheesecake is N.Y.-style dense. Not dry, I just wouldn't call it light or fluffy. I did mix the batter in a food processor because I've found that leads to a smoother filling. I also added 1/4 tsp pure lime oil (available Williams Sonoma and elsewhere) for additional lime flavor, and would add an additional 1/4 tsp next time for a total of 1/2 tsp. I also baked at 325 for a longer period--use the jiggle judgement mentioned in the recipe

Delicious with a very creamy texture. A big hit for Easter Sunday and was actually prefered over the tropical carrot cake (also on this site). The crust will be used for all future pies and tarts - it was outstanding! Also made a tofu tart for our vegan guest using firm silken tofu in place of cream cheese, sour cream, and eggs (oil in place of butter in crust). Used one package and cut remaining ingredients in half. It made three individual tarts. Just reduced oven to 325 and watched closely - about 30 mins.

Made without topping. Flavor was fabulous!Texture was uneven like a cheesecake made with ricotta cheese, kids liked but spouse didn't. Watch crust cooking time-8 min might be too long (I burned mine and taste was not so good). I would also cook cake at a lower temp - top was too brown.

Made this for a dinner party, and it was a huge hit. I used Neufchatel (light) cream cheese instead of the regular cream cheese and it turned out beautifully. One little tip -- the pineapple slices in the center made it a little difficult to slice the cheesecake -- next time I will chop the pineapple instead of slicing it.

One of the best flavor combinations in a cheesecake I have found. The ginger crust is a nice and very tasty change from plain graham crusts, and the lime, mango and pineapple are a fantastic combination. I made a fruit salsa with mango, pineapple,strawberry and kiwi (so pretty!) and spooned this over each piece individually. I'll try plating it with a puddle of mango coulis on the bottom next time. A keeper!

This was a distinctive and refreshing cheesecake. I love ginger, citrus, and mango, so the elements were wonderful. Only two things: I overcooked it just a bit, so the crust was a bit too browned; I also assembled the fruit on top the night before serving, and it got slightly soggy. I will not do that next time, and I'm sure my results will be superb. Even as it was, my guests loved it.

This cheesecake rocks!! Ginger and lime is a classically yummy combination, and the macadamia nuts and tropical fruits make this luscious beyond your dreams. We served this dessert following a home-made Thai extravaganza for friends. After hot tom yum kun soup, Thai beef salad, and satay, this cheesecake was a welcome cool-sweet-tangy ending. You MUST try it!

AMAZING! Made this for Mother's Day dinner, and will be making it for Father's Day, too, as Dad was eating it off OUR plates on Mother's Day! Really great crust, and not so "heavy" feeling as some cheesecakes.

Fantastic cheesecake. Easy and looks like a million bucks. Don't skip the pineapple leaves as decoration, makes quite the centerpiece. Makes a large cheesecake and yet, with a gourmet club dinner of 8 we had a slice or two left. Ranks high up there is cheesecake successes with this group.

Yum! Don't leave out the fresh fruit. I actually prepared it the morning of the dinner (instead of the night before) -- which allowed plenty of chilling time.

I made this cheesecake for a luau and it received rave reviews. It was fabulous. I borrowed a spring form pan from my Grandmother because I made two and she told me to be sure and return it with a cheesecake in it.

I got so many complements about this cheesecake. Everyone loved it. It is especially creamy and tastes great with very ripe mango. I would recommend using a slightly larger pan or not using all of the filling because the cake cooked over the top of the pan. I would also recommend cooking at only 325 degrees.

a perfect ending to a perfect meal. The creamy, citrusy filling complimented by the gingery crust are beyond compare.

Cheesecake is the ultimate dessert if made well. This particular cheesecake is fantastic as an ending to a wonderful summer meal. The tropical flavors create a fabulous compliment to the creamy consistency in this cheesecake.
