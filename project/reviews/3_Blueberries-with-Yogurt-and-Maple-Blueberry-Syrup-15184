There was nothing special about the syrup. I own a b&b and was looking for something special to do with blueberries and yogurt. This was good, but not special enough.

I'm not a huge fan of blueberries, but when there was a deal on them at the farmer's market, I could resist, so I've been trying all sorts of blueberry recipes. This has been one of my favourites. I used vanilla yogurt instead of plain. The recipe is simple and delicious, and equally suited for breakfast and dessert. I'll be making this again and again.

This is delicious ONLY if the blueberries that are eaten raw are reasonably sweet. The sweetness of the blueberry syrup (which is delicious, by the way)will not compensate for sour raw blueberries, since plain yogurt is also a bit tart. That said, if your blueberries are sweet enough, this is a luscious summer breakfast dish. Also good over pancakes or waffles.

this was delicious. super easy for a summer barbeque. i was concerned that it was going to be a bit too much like plain old blueberry yoghurt so i but the blueberries in shortcakes before i topped them with yoghurt that i'd mixed a bit of sour cream into. yummy! the only other thing i changed was to add a bit of lemon zest to the syrup. and then decorated them with a curl of lemon zest before serving.

Hmmm. I was a little under-impressed. But it would probably be a whole lot tastier using small, wild blueberries.

Absolutely delicious and ridiculously easy for such tasty results.
