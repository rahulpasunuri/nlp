I loved how easy this was to make. However, I think it would be richer with one more egg yolk. I haven't tried it that way yet. I am a huge fan of dill so that just made it better. I served this with ham, poached eggs, and steam asparagus. Absolutely yummy brunch.

This sauce was not much more than melted butter. I will not make this agin.

This is a super easy recipe but tastes very gourmet! The dill was perfect with smoked salmon eggs benedict.

Will add the dill, but my recipe for Hollandaise sauce is wayYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY easier

This is an excellent hollandaise recipe. One suggestion: start with 1 tsp of lemon juice instead of 1 tbsp. I used 1 tsp of dried dill - very nice!

Flavorful, relatively easy to make (and clean up) and certainly rich enough for company! Can adapt by substituting 1/4 olive oil for 1/4 of the butter if preferred.
