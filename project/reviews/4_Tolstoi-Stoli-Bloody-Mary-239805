Thanks for the inspiration. I tackled the freezing problem a little differently and I recommend it. I froze my tomatoes the day before. Then I put them in the blender with the rest of the ingredients. Blend and serve -- lovely!

I have made this recipe many times. Instead of freezing it, I just blend all the ingredients in a blender and serve in glasses with vodka. I would definitely recommend adding a small can of tomato juice as the mix comes out quite thick. This recipe is fantastic!
