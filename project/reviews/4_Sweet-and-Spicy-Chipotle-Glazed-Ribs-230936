I thought these were fantastic! Maybe the best ribs I've ever made. The sauce came out surprisingly delicious once it was baked on and the frequent basting with sauce really makes these special. A little intensive, but so worth it. I will make these often. I used regualr molasses with some lime juice added to mimic the zing of pomagranate molasses. Worked out well.

Excellent recipe. The sauce was pleasantly sweet. I would have kept some of the solids from the chipotle as I could have used more spice. I also cooked it at 300 degrees for 4 hours instead of at the higher temperature because I wanted them to be cooked to nearly falling off the bone doneness and to get a browner chewy crust. YUM.

The sauce is perfect. I will make this sauce every time I make ribs. It is so much better than BBQ sauce, which can be cloyingly sweet. However, the ribs themselves weren't all that tender. It may have just been a bad cut of meat. But, in the future I would tenderize the meat, or cook it at a lower temperature for a longer time.

I never made ribs before I tried this recipe, and I'll never try another way. This recipe is amazing, exactly as it is written. I think the people who wrote they just used regular molasses have no idea what pomegranate molasses is. It's a very tart, concentrated pomegranate syrup, and nothing like sweet molasses. Find it in Middle Eastern shops, or if you're lucky, at the grocery store like I did.

THis was a decent recipe but here's how I will do it next time; Sauce is Great ! I woyuld double the sauce recipe, then marinate the ribs overnite and cut into peices and add all to a dutch oven and braise. the suace was a bit thin but fully reduced would be fine. Very tasty

Fantastic - this has become my default ribs recipe. It is unique & so flavorful with the sweet/spicy combo. Definitely use pomegranate molasses if available.

These ribs smelled wonderful while cooking, They tasted good too, but I would prefer less sweet, more spicy. Next time I make them I'll cut the red currant jelly way down, maybe to 1/4 C. There was was plenty of sauce.

This was my first attempt at cooking ribs and the reaction of my guests was unanimously very positive. The reviewer who said that the glaze would be too hot was completely wrong. Tasted on its own it was very hot but cooked on the ribs it was most delicious and not overwhelming at all. The next day I drizzled remaining glaze on chicken tenders in the saute pan and they too ended up being very tasty. This is definitely my rib recipe. Very versatile.

I used regular molasses and some preserves that is what I had laying around. Recipe turned out great!

OK....I think a small word of caution here is appropriate. I love the smoked chipotles that come in small cans with adobo sauce. I use them in many recipes. But...they are hot. I am afraid that 1/4 cup of them would blow most people away. One tablespoon might be a better place to start from.
