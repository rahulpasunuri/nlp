Definitely not the best stuffing recipe I've used. Despite the fresh herbs it was not very flavorful and lacked the complexity of a good stuffing. Also, the recipe is partially incomplete - it does not give baking times or temps and does not call for any added liquid. I added a can of chicken broth because it was just dry bread with some herbs without it.

I made this for Thanksgiving, it was THE BEST stuffing ever! I did add about 50% more bread than the recipe called for. Also I added chicken stock as others have mentioned.

This stuffing was great. I used it for Game Hens and froze the rest. I will not use fresh chestnuts again.....once was enough! It came out delicious and and moist.

I made this last year for my first year hosting Thanksgiving. It was the biggest hit of the evening! It also pairs well with a Turkey brined in the William Sonoma brine!

I haven't made this yet, but have a secret chestnut source to share. I buy vacuum packed bags of them in the snack section of Asian markets. Be sure to get the shelled ones! There are no added flavors, just roasted chestnuts and they are not dried out or anything. Really good and less expensive than any others Ive seen.

My partner dies for this stuffing every Thanksgiving and Christmas. He would forego the turkey just to munch on the stuffing. Fresh herbs cannot be substituted, they MAKE the dish.

Maybe I am missing something but I don't see any broth/liquid mentioned in the list of ingredients(except the water to go in with the chestnuts.Looks good though!

Delicious. This was my first time using chestnuts, and they were wonderful. I roasted my own, because the jar was too expensive. I baked it separately from the turkey, so added a lot more broth, maybe 2-3 times what's called for. Perfect.

This is the Queen Momma of the Stuffing Recipes! Perfect recipe that will make your family and guests thrilled with the flavor and the old time memories!

The recipe is ok, but there is nothing really "wow-worthy" about it. It needed more liquid (I used vegetable broth), the chestnuts needed to roast much longer (and need to be chopped up), and the whole thing was rather bland. I think there are other, better chestnut stuffing recipes out there.

THIS IS OUR STUFFING RECIPE EVERY HOLIDAY MEAL.LIKE THE COOK FROM QUEENS I USE VACUUM PACKED FRENCH CHESTNUTS, YOU LOSE NOTHING OF THE FLAWOR AND SAVE YOURSELF A TEDIOUS JOB. I BAKE IT OUTSIDE OF THE BIRD IN A LIGHTLY OILED CASSEROLE DISH ADDING ABOUT 1/2-3/4 CUPS OF CHICKEN BROTH TO MOISTEN AND COMPENSATE FOR THE LOST JUICES. IT IS ALWAYS A BIG HIT!

I made this exactly as written and found it to be flavorless and just kind of blah. For the work it takes to make a stuffing for Thanksgiving, I'd like more exciting results. I won't be making it again.

This stuffing was delicious. I agree with the other reviewers that additional liquid is necessary. I used a little more than a cup- half canned bouillon and half turkey pan juices. The amount of vegetables is very good. I didn't want to be bothered cleaning chestnuts so I bought some imported French vacuum packed chestnuts. I chopped the chestnuts into medium dice/slices. I used an Italian loaf bread, crust and all, cut into cubes, and dried them in the oven overnight using the pilot light. This is definitely a keeper recipe.

This recipe is very much like to one I have been using for years. However, after struggling with the chestnuts for many years by scoring them with an X, a couple of years ago I discovered that you can gently hit them with a mallet to break them instead of scoring. As long as the air escapes, it doesn't matter how they are opened. It saved my fingers and the time it takes to score and peel them. It works beautifully. But my family complains because of the hammering :) Also I add apples to the mix. The taste is beyond compare!!

I preferred chopping the chestnuts more fine. Better texture and flavor.

this stuffing was very good. i cheated and bought a bag of torn bread pieces that were already toasted, but it turned out great. i made it the night before thanksgiving, then added some of the pan juices from the turkey and a little chicken stock before reheating it in the oven.

I made this for Thanksgiving, this stuffing was delicious(and I don't even like stuffing)! My husband said it was the best stuffing he ever had. I used day a old baguette torn into little pieces and added some chicken broth when baking (baked the extra stuffing for about the last hour of roasting the turkey). Loved it & will make it next year. . .

This last Thanksgiving, I took the suggestion of some previous reviewers, and added a can of Swanson chicken stock to the stuffing. It was the absolute best chestnut stuffing ever!

This was the hit of our Thanksgiving table. I made three kinds of stuffing, and this is the one that disappeared. I'd make this again in a heartbeat. One note--be sure to use cooking spray on the pan for the dressing cooked on the side. Mine stuck.

I have made this stuffing recipe yearly since it was firts published. It is a hit! Everyone wants to take home the leftovers (if we have any). Sandi

Perfect stuffing, a great hit at my Thanksgiving table. The sage flavor really comes through. I, like others, used Williams-Sonoma chestnuts. I also added approximately 3/4 lb of browned seasoned sausage meat. This is the best stuffing ever.

When you imagine stuffing...this is it. This is classic, home-style stuffing with no wierd ingredients. I have been making this recipe for years. You do need chicken stock to moisten. Note: I used fresh chestnuts the first year--not worth the trouble!! I have since purchased chestnuts sold in a jar from William's Somoma. [Note: This year I baked this on the side (instead of inside the turkey, which was brined). It wasn't nearly as flavorful--next year I will pour some reserved turkey fat over the stuffing prior to baking!]

A very tasty recipe but a bit time consuming if using fresh chestnuts.

This recipe saved the day when my father-in-law announced that he wanted the perfect Bavarian Christmas dinner--goose and chestnut stuffing. Delicious. I would recommend adding a little broth, and--if you're cooking a goose anyway--frying and mincing the goose liver and tossing that in too.

Yum! We will definitely make it again! Note: we added LOTS of herbs, a good deal more than the recipie calls for, and it was great. Thanks for the tip about moistening!

Easy and delicious. I was expecting to have to add broth to moisten this, but it was perfect without it.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year and it was a big hit. I am planning to make it again this year and use canned chestnuts instead of fresh as the fresh took way too long. Definitely add some more chicken broth to keep it from drying out and doubling some of the spices adds some zest.

IMHP, chestnut stuffing is my favorite of all stuffing recipes. This is a classic recipe, and if you love chestnuts, you'll love this recipe. A note about buying fresh chestnuts. The recipe calls for 1 pound of fresh chestnuts (and it's definitely worth buying fresh chestnuts). The only problem is that the chestnuts we've been buying have several bad ones in the pound. The last few years, I've bought 2 pounds of chestnuts, which ends up yielding 1 pound of good chestnuts

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was good and I'll make it again since we love chestnuts--but I think I will add larger amounts of the herbs since it was a little bland. I used canned chestnuts which saved time!

I have been experimenting for years with different stuffings but this one is now going to be my standard. I used canned chestnuts in mine and it was much simpler. As other reviewers mentioned, you really must add some broth to it as it was too dry especially any that you bake on the side. Other than that I didn't change anything.

IT SUCKED!

This is one of those recipes you dream about. Easy to do and the note about roasting chestnuts with a little water really helped with the peeling. I only had about half a pound of chestnuts so I added about a cup of chopped walnuts and it added a nice crunch and flavour. I also had to add about 1/2 cup of broth to the stuffing as it was a little too dry for my liking. Next time I will double the recipe - I had a small uprising at the dinner table when we were down to about a spoonful of stuffing.

Typically I follow directions on new recipes without making any alterations. However at Thanksgiving, I used what I had already purchased. Instead of white bread I used a bag of corn bread stuffing, and we added italian sausage (skin, break and brown first) and some walnuts. It was unbelievable. It was finished before any of the other dishes, and there was not one non-stuffing eater who didn't have seconds. Don't miss this recipe. It is terrific.

Everyone loved this stuffing at Thanksgiving! I used foccacia (plain, with only thyme) instead of regular bread. My sister said it beat my mother's heavy (fatty) stuffing. I added homemade chicken stock to the stuffing that I baked separately in a pan which didn't fit into the bird.

This stuffing --- the first I've ever made from scratch --- was absolutely one of the hits of the entire Thanksgiving feast. We added extra sage to give the flavor a real boost. Also, instead of browning the bread, we cooked it for a minute or two with the vegetables and herbs, thereby giving it a darker color and a richer flavor. Delicious!

This receipt is always the favorite at Thanksgiving. We like the stuffing moist, so I used vegetable broth and baked for 20 minutes and then broiled for 5 minutes.

My husband grew up with his mother's chestnut stuffing which he didn't think could be matched. Neither did I... her's is awful! This is absolutely delicious! My boys even ate it and enjoyed it. I add a can of chicken stock the recipe to moisten it and it's tremendous!

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was completely delicious. It has just the right combination of herbs. I doubled the amount of sage which tasted great.I baked the stuffing separately - poured a little turkey broth on top and covered it with foil - because I cook my turkey at 200 degrees and didn't want to give everyone food poisoning.

Delicious stuffing if you like chestnuts. All the right spices. I did not stuff the turkey with it, I made it on the side and added gravy from the turkey before cooking. I used plain(no seasoning)bagged stuffing instead of stale bread and it worked out great! Definitely would make again

This stuffing is very tasty! I used fresh chestnuts, which was a pain to clean after baking; but it was definitely worth the effort. I used this recipe with "Roast Quail with Cranberry Madeira Sauce" (also from Epicurious)for our Thanksgiving Dinner and my husband was thrilled.
