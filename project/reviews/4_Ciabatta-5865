I followed the recipe exactly and found the bread to be way too salty. I am thinking to half the salt. Otherwise nice textured bread with big bubbles.

A very good, reliable recipe, for excellent bread. I've made it twice now this way, and I can highly recommend baking on a hot pizza stone, or terra-cotta tiles. I couldn't fit both loaves on my pizza stone so started one on the stone and one on a baking sheet, and the loaf on the stone rose nicely, while the loaf on the sheet fell relatively flat. It was still great eating, but wasn't as nice as the other loaf. As mentioned, you'll want to adjust the water to your flour, and usually you want to go wetter. As for Semolina, it is coarsely ground, high-protein-wheat, so use pasta or strong/bread flour with more water, or fine cornmeal in a pinch.

I live in Mazatlan, Mexico, and for some reason or another, we do not have Semolina here. What can I use as a substitute? I read another reviewers comment to use Cornmeal instead - is there any other suggestions?

FINALLY, a very tasty bread recipe that doesn't use oil! It can also stand up to being thrown in my messenger bag. That said, I need to spend some time perfecting this one. I was running slim on time and had to cut many of the resting periods 5 minutes short. Next time I will also let the biga come closer to room temperature before I start the dough process. I also hate my oven, I often burn the bottom of my bread before the inside fully cooks. I would say you MUST use Semolina for this recipe, it really is the only thing that makes this recipe tasty.

This recipe worked out better than any other ciabatta recipe that I have tried. Most other recipes that I have tried ended up having a typical white bread crumb and texture, not the large bubbles and texture you expect from ciabbata. I used all purpose flour for this because the local Safeway doesn't sell bread flour. Everything went as described in the recipe except for the quantity of semolina required. I made a double recipe, but needed more than double the 1/2 cup plus 3 tbsp given in the recipe. I measured out the stated amount, mixed it with the biga and water. After waiting the 10 minutes, the water was fully absorbed, but the dough was still a big gooey mass that could not be kneaded without having 3/4 of it stick to yur hands. It stuck to everything. Even after adding another 1/2-3/4 cup of semolina, the dough could just be kneaded on a floured board without having half of it sticking to my hands. I know ciabatta dough is supposed to be wet, so I stopped adding semoiina at this point and everything turned out right. The final crumb and texture turned out excellent.

I have made both this one and the Gourmet one. This is a much better bread. The biga did not have the texture as described and actually had dense lumps. I was worried, however, the end result was fantastic! this bread is not good for my diet. I stayed with the semolina, I thought it enhanced the texture nicely. I did pull the biga out of the fridge several hours before starting phase two. I was very happy with the texture and I am currently making some more :)

I love this recipe! If you are a bread maker this recipe goes against everything you know but it is amazing. I have made it many times and everyone always raves. I add vital wheat gluten to the dough, increase the yeast and use bread flour instead of semolina.

I needed to make several loaves to take to a get together, so I decided to make both the Bon Appetit'98 and the Gourmet '99 recipes so I could compare them. I followed the recipes exactly and found the Bon Appetit recipe to satisfy what I was looking for: a chewy crust and a moist, airy interior, much like a sea sponge, and similar to the ciabatta I buy at Trader Joe's. It wasn't as salty as the other recipe either and took about 1 1/2 hour less time to make. With both recipes I made one plain loaf and the second I incorporated walnuts, oil cured olives and rosemary. All four were delicious but I will make the Bon Appetit recipe in the future.

I thought this recipe was very good. At first, I didn't think it was going to work out because my biga wasnt the right texture, but the bread turned out fabulous. I would definitely recommend this recipe.

*instead of semolina in comment above. Then, sprinkle cornmeal on baking pan and on loaf.

This is a keeper, but you must add more water to the biga, maybe another 1/2 to 3/4 cup depending on how fine your bread flour is! Be patient. It's worth it. For a wheat version substitute 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup ground flax seed meal for white flour in the dough portion. I use a dough hook in my mixer. This chiabatta is better than the bakery. Trust me.

Excellent - this is real Ciabatta - read all reviews which were helpful - loved the bread

Rating: 3
This worked out great - you really have to trust yourself - the dough is so wet I was convinced something was wrong. Also the description of the bita looking like textured oatmeal in the morning is not really what mine looked like - much firmer. But it all came together in the end. Delicious.

great directions and delicious bread.

This recipe ROCKS! We can't get good bread in the middle of nowhere Nebraska, so I have to make my own, and this is one of my favorites - and my friends! I've been making it since it first came out in 1999 and was pleased to see it in the Recipe Flash this month.

I have no idea where I went wrong. The other reviews were so promising. My dough took twice as long to rise and was far too wet to even shape. I ended up with a flat oval on my parchment paper. I followed the recipe exactly but I wonder if the room temp wasn't warm enough to rise? Can anyone help?

Someone threw a curve. I'm an old ciabatta baker and think this recipe rates 0. Biga was too stiff even when warmed up.I mixed by hand. Too much yeast and flour, no sugar or honey to give it pep, no salt. I'll go by my Italian recipe - but a Kitchenaid mixer is great for kneading.

Maybe someone can offer me some advice? My loaves *always* end up with a very hard crust, although the center is generally just like you'd expect from ciabatta bread, very porous and delicious.

this is a very good ciabatta recipe. I would suggest one wonderful addition-- roughly cube (1/4 inch cubes) some asiago cheese (maybe a half cup altogether) and mix that into the batter...MMMMM. Seriously yummy.

I make a lot of different kinds of yeast breads. This one gets the best reviews of any. It is a lot of work, but if you have time to plan, plan on this one!

My best friend who is a wonderful chef raves about this ciabatta. I took it to a family gathering recently and got good reviews,too.

This was a great! loaf of bread. However, it was too much work to make on a regular basis. I'd rather just buy it at the grocery store.

This recipe never fails to please. I cut the work down to a minimum by adding the biga to the rest of the ingredients in my breadmaker then setting it to 'dough only'.

This wonderful recipe always fetches compliments and requests... even better, it keeps getting me invited back for dinner ("We'll make the pasta, you bring the ciabatta!")! I've found that the texture of the ciabatta is better if I don't over-knead or over-mix the dough... That final dough should be lumpy and not smooth like most other breads.

The texture of this ciabatta is too dense! Searching for a better recipe...

I have made Ciabatta severa; times from other recipies and decided to try this one. The texture and quantities were not so good. The taste is good but I can give you a super recipie if you ask me

I have tried this recipe 3 times already and find it FANTASTIC. I truly would not change anything in the recipe. Have a daughter (a professional chef)to whom I have sent this recipe. She has previously remarked about trying other Ciabatta recipes and trashed them! Stay tuned for a critique.

Came back to this recipe because my friend begged for it after I made it to go with dinner the other night. Found some reviewers having difficulty with the texture of biga. My biga is much firmer than oatmeal also, but I just don't worry about it. It gets softer the more you work it when making dough. Made three times now, and still love it. My 12 year old still likes playing with the dough, which takes all the hard work off me!

Good recipe but my starter did not resemble oatmeal, too. In addition, the bread is quite salty - maybe American taste? I would recommend one teaspoon of salt. Gitte

I have made this bread twice. I'm still having trouble getting the correct texture in the starter, but the end result both times have been a delicious tasting bread. The second time I made it I let it rise for two hours before putting in the refrigerator and brought it to room temp before proceeding. Texture was better, but I still wouldn't call it "thick oatmeal." This is a cooking class receipe, could use more instructions. Maybe the other reviewers 12 year old could help me. Great receipe but could use more instructions.
