We didn't care for this mashed potato version at all. We missed the fullness of the milk and butter and found the olive oil potatoes too bland. Since I made the full batch for just two of us, I added grated cheddar cheese and some butter to the leftovers, plus poured on some turkey gravy I had in the freezer. This helped some.

I thought these were a little too watery after adding the potato water. Next time I'll start with 1/2 cup and go from there. They were tasty, though, and the olive oil added an earthiness that went nicely with the new coq au vin recipe on this site.

i used this recipe as a backup when i realised too late that there was no milk in the fridge. It was wonderfully flavourful and light, i mashed with a fork and slowly added the cooking water until it was creamy. I prefer it to the usual too rich milk and butter version and will probably use as my standard mashed potatoes from now on.

This is a great way to have mashed potatoes if you can't have dairy like me. I've used this recipe many times over. Of course it's not as creamy, because there's no cream. A hand mixer can add some fluffiness, but you have to be careful so as not to overwork the potatoes and make them gluey

As you can see from the photo, these are not fluffy and creamy, but rather pasty. Maybe if you are looking to reduce fat in mashed potatoes, otherwise this is dry, not rich, very disappointing.
