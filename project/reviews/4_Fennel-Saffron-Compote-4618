Absolutely gorgeous! This is such a lovely bed to serve the Monkfish on, if a bit expensive, but then we're talking about Monkfish here, so it's never going to be a budget dish. I finely chopped the fennel and onion, so as to cut down on the cooking time, and end up with a smoother, more uniform consistency. Serving a pescetarian, I subbed vegetable broth for chicken, and was generous with the saffron.
