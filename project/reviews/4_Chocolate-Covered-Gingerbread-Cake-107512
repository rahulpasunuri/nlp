Wonderful holiday cake. I like to make it a day ahead to give the cake and frosting time to meld together. cake is not dry if you bake it correctly. Do not add oil as a previous reviewer mentions.

Made for Christmas Day dinner we had so many after dinner treats the gingerbread went untouched. Took a chance and froze it. Needed a dessert to take to a New Year's dinner party. Popped the gingerbread out of the freezer. It was a hit! I never let on it had been frozen for a week.

Since it's gingerbread, I was skeptical about how dry this cake would be. However, the recipe sounded so good with the chocolate glaze, that I had to give it a try. I'm so glad I did because it was outstanding! I made the recipe as is with no deletions or additions, and it was perfect. My Christmas dinner guests raved about it, and there wasn't a piece left! I will definitely be making this cake again for next year's holiday parties!

I made a half recipe and used a 7-inch springform pan. I thought the cake was ok, but just ok - nothing special. It wasn't dry, but it didn't have that sticky moistness of a lot of gingerbread recipes. I decorated it with green and red candied cherries, and it looked beautiful.

This was a very good cake. I can't find molasses here in the UK so I used maple syrup. I made this into a layer cake with a maple cream cheese frosting in the middle. Spicy and festive!

Fabulous! I made it with rice flour for a GLUTEN FREE version (for my Mom)and brought to Christmas dinner. I added a 1/2 cup applesauce and it was just the right level of moistness. Big hit!

to chicken girl...the cake pedestal may be by Fostoria a glass company in Ohio which produced a total line of glasses. plates, large serving pieces.

this is completely unrelated, but where did that pedestal come from does anyone know!?

Excellent cake. Last year I made this cake for Thanksgiving, and it was a hit! I didn't have any candied ginger so I just used mint leaves. Its a different cake, something out of the ordinary. I highly recommend this cake.

This tastes very "Christmasy"! I made a few small changes: I used regular molasses instead of light, and I baked it in a 9-inch round pan (for about 45 minutes). Also, I made the cake a few days ahead of time, froze it, and glazed it the day before serving. The recipe made a lot of glaze. Next time, I'll reserve more of the glaze, reheat it, and add it to individual pieces before serving.

This cake is so yummy and moist. The moistness makes it!! It is easy but with an incredible look and flavor.

Wonderful holiday dessert. I made it in a round pan. Applied the chocolate glaze, but instead of decorative frosting I garnished with thinly sliced ginger that I candied myself.

oh my! This is amazing. I didn't decorate it quite as nicely as the picture, but this seems no fail to me. I used a round cake pan and baked for about 37 minurtes. Perfect.

Except for substituting bittersweet chocolate for semisweet in the glaze, I followed this exactly and it was fabulous. I have a convection oven so that may have helped with keeping the cake from being dry. Candied ginger was expensive in the spice rack but there was also a box (Dynasty Sugar Ginger) in the Chinese food section of my grocery store that was much less expensive.

Good recipe. German cake recipes do tend to be too dry. I just add 1/3 cup of canola oil to the recipe. It makes a big difference.

Delicious combination of flavors. Made the following modifications: took cake out of oven 5 minutes early, added 1/3 grated ginger that the recipe calls for. Unfortunately, cake was a bit DRY.

This is a fabulous recipe! Everyone that has tried it loves it! The only thing I changed was to add a little extra ginger and clove to the recipe.

After all the rave reviews, I was disappointed. Interesting combination of flavors (especially with the ganache), but the cake was dry (fortunately, it came out of the oven 5 minutes early--still didn't help).

I've made this cake twice and it has been delicous both times. I made a non-dairy version using non-dairy margarine instead of butter and Rich's Whip instead of real whipping cream. If it is this good using these non-dairy ingredients, it must be absolutely amazing when you use the real thing!

This was really great - the rich chocolate ganache contrasted nicely with the slightly spicy gingerbread cake. I made a few changes; for extra chocolate oomph I added about 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate morsels to the cake batter, for the ganache I used dark chocolate instead of semi-sweet, and I used dark corn syrup instead of molasses because I didn't have any. I made it the day before and brought it to a birthday party and everyone loved it. Plus, it is really easy to make.

Easy, straight forward recipe. I made it for a Valentine's Day dinner and everyone loved it. I added rows of fresh raspberries between the candied ginger.

I wanted something different for a Christmas dessert. I made this cake in mini bundt pans. I poured the chocolate sauce over them and decorated them with red and green sugars. I don't care foor crystalized ginger. They were delicious! Everyone loved them.

I made this last night for an office baby shower today, and it is all gone. Everyone loved it. The cake was nicely moist. As I was preparing it, I was a little irritated by the need to use three bowls. Although, when I re-read the recipe, I realized that the water and the baking soda could have been left in the water's measuring cup. I agree with adding the extra teaspoon of ginger. I did not add it to mine because I wanted to see how strong the fresh ginger would be. I think that thencake would have had a little more of the ginger "zing" with the increase. I had more than enough glaze. It was easy to make and so good that I was actually eating the remainder out of the bowl. :-D

Lost my family gingerbread recipe and made this at the last minute for Christmas dinner. Whole family of very picky eaters loved it. I did add 1 more tsp powdered ginger than recipe.

When EVERYONE at the dinner table -- both men and women -- ask for a recipe, you know you've got a hit! I didn't have any fresh ginger, so added another teaspoon of ground, upped the cinnamon a scoush, and some nutmeg. The icing recipe is easy and very delicious. I will use it again for other desserts. For decoration, I simply made rosettes of the frosting around the edge of the cake, one in the middle, and pressed some candied ginger into each of them. Easy, gorgeous, and delicious. It's a keeper!

This was delicious. The bite of the ginger combined with the semi-sweet chocolate was wonderful. The cake was moist and cooked perfectly in the amount of time stated. The only thing I will work on next time is presentation and garnish. The cake was beautiful before cutting but lost some of the glamour once a single piece was on the plate. Maybe I'll save some of the piping chocolate for plate garnish next time...

this cake was heaven for a gingerbread lover like me!!! It's now our family's favourite. I used whole wheat flour for this one and there was no noticeable difference.

This is DELICIOUS! The cake is moist and the flavors are wonderful. I made it for the holidays last year and will definitely make it again this year!!

I baked this cake to celebrate a friend's 40th birthday. The recipe was simple and the flavors a fantastic juxtaposition of sweet and spicy. Instead of piping the chocolate on top, I decided to make the Pear Crumble with Crystallized Ginger also on this site to serve on the side. It was a decadent combination!! Needless to say, the birthday girl felt duly spoiled!

Great recipe -- very moist, wonderful flavor. I used an 8x8 cake pan without a problem. Instead of piping and crystalized ginger on top, I made a wreath out of red & green sugar chrystals. Looked great and was easy.

I was looking for a recipe that would produce cakes similar to the "spice cakes" my mother would pick up at the local German bakery. Those cakes were thin 3x3 sqaures with a choclate frosting. I made this recipe and it turned out to be very very close to the product I was looking for. I brought them into work and people were raving. The president of the company called them "to die for". I used 2/3 the fresh ginger because that was all I had. Ginger gets a lot smaller when you trim and grate it. Next time I make it, in order to get closer to the goal I was striving for, I'll probably use a 9x13 pan for one recipe to get a thinner final product, add a little nutmeg and cut down on the fresh ginger even further. The fresh ginger flavor was great, but a little too "bright" for my purpose.

We LOVE this recipe! It has become the birthday cake of choice for autumn birthdays. It's easy and very, very spicey, and my hubby requests it often. I also added a bit more fresh ginger to the batter, but that's just a personal choice (we really like ginger). If you like the combination of ginger and chocolate, you'll love this one!

Delicious and different! If you want to make something impressive but not spend a lot of time in the kitchen, this cake is the answer. The cake was tasty and moist ( I did kick up the ginger a little bit by another 1/8 t. ground ) and came together very easy. The chocolate coating was very easy to do. I used Ghiradelli dark chocolate, which complimented the gingerbread very well. I used some white chocolate to decorate the cake. Definitely a keeper!

Very easy to make. The batter is rather thin. Interesting combination of flavors. A big hit a home and with co-workers. A good dessert for people who do not like desserts that are too sweet. I will make this cake again.

I just had this at a friend's house for dessert. It was wonderful. Really tasty gingerbread (the fresh ginger is a great addition) and the chocolate frosting brought it to a whole new level! I will definitely make it in the future.
