Some say bland, I say it lets the flavor of the trout shine. I made it just as described and it was delicious. The bones -- I took them out with my tweezers. Yeah, it is time-consuming, but better than a ride to the emergency room.

I had a terrible time taking the bones out. I seemed to take out more fish than bones. The flavor was good. I added butter at the end and added a little vermouth. I just wish I knew how to take the bones out.

This recipe borders on bland if you ask me. I toasted the pine nuts and added 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic. I didn't have any parsley to sprinkle over it, but I doubt that it would have made much of a difference. I will make it again, but it needs some spark to it. I might put a small amount of Tabasco directly on the fish before I coat it with the crumbs. If anyone has a better idea, I am game to try it.

My husband is very particular about his trout and I prepared this recipe for him. He liked it enough to request I make it again. It was tasty and I recommend it to others.

On a recent vacation to the Eastern Sierras, I prepared this recipe on a coleman stove just minutes after catching the trout. The ingredients traveled well and I served the fish with fresh tomatoes and hearty bread. Great tasting, great looking,simple to prepare. You'll definately impress veteran campers and fish lovers with this lakeside dish.

Easy to make. Used a peanut-pine nut mixture and it was very good but will use only pine nuts, next time. Very appetizing when presented well.
