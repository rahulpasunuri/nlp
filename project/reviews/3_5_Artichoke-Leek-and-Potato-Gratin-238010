Made this to go with Easter ham and received rave reviews! I used regular ol' swiss cheese, but ran out of pepper (when does that ever happen, seriously), only used 2 leeks as I had originally intended to make a half recipe, but was still very very good.

Amazing! Made this last night as a test and it came out wonderful. Used the cream instead of half and half and a little more cheese than the recipe asks. Sliced the potatoes on a mandolin blade which made bake cook evenly and beautifully. This recipe is a huge hit

I just made this, took some tips from other cooks, sauteed the leeks in butter, and used heavy cream in place of the half and half, and I simmered it before putting it over the potatoes. I cooked it with foil at 400 for 1 hr, then raised the temp to 425 took the foil off and added parmesan and breadcrumbs and cooked for 20 min more. Best gratin recipe I've tried!!

Made this as our Easter dinner potato dish. Altered the recipe to conform to the most frequent tips: use cream instead of half and half and saute instead of boil the leeks. I also used both types of recommended cheese. Followed all other directions to the letter. Delicious! Had leftovers which reheated well enough to make me think you could do this recipe ahead of time and reheat later.

I made this for Easter and it was a huge hit. Based on other reviews I substituted heavy cream for the half & half and added some cheese and breadcrumbs to the top for the last 20 minutes of cooking. I will definitely be making this again!

One word - YUM!!!! This was such a delicious update to a traditional scalloped potato recipe. I used Yukon Gold potatoes because they are so creamy and more flavorful than baking potatoes. I used frozen artichoke hearts and next time I make this, I will leave them in bigger chunks which will add texture. Also, I added about 2/3 c. bread crumbs to the parmesan topping because I thought it would be tasty - and it was!

I usually love all Epicurious recipes, but this one left me down this Christmas with a party of 10. I followed the reviewer-suggestions: sauteeing the leeks in butter, using cream instead of half & half, added extra cheese, but the potatoes never really cooked through (even after keeping them in for a very long time), it was runny and it desperately required more salt or seasoning. It may be that I made it the night before and refrigerated it overnight? Or that I used light cream instead of heavy cream (but I only used 1.5 cups of it so it wouldn't be liquidy). I honestly threw most of it out, it was embarrassing.

This was fantastic. The adjustments I made: I split it up into serving sized portions in little 5"x8" rectangular cast iron servers/casserole dishes. I added some additional gruyere on top before popping it in the oven and didn't cover it (as the recipe suggested) to allow the cheese to brown on top. I also mixed russet potatoes and sweet potatoes. I cooked it for half of the time on 350 and then increased it to 425, checking the potatoes for softness. A hit.

Made this gratin for brunch with the following changes: instead of boiling, I sauteed the leeks and artichokes with butter and garlic. Then instead of half and half, I used heavy cream that I heated before adding. Made and cooked the day before - then baked uncovered the next morning until golden brown and bubbly on top. My guests RAVED about this dish!

These were delish, a definite make again! I did make a few changes based on other reviewer's comments, namely that I sauteed the leeks in butter & olive oil until caramelized (along with a finely diced yellow onion), and used heavy cream versus the half-and-half called for in the recipe. I did make this for Easter dinner and assembled the dish the day before, covered it with foil befoire putting in the fridge, and popped it in the oven the next day at 350 degrees, and it turned out well.

I also changed up the recipe a bit and it was a huge hit for Easter dinner. Used heavy cream instead of half and half, sauteed the sauce with the vegetables and then poured over the potatoes, and added a bit of chicken stock at the end for a touch more flavor. Would definitely make this again!

Rating: 3
Very good recipe. Based on the consistency comments in other reviews, I used cream rather than half-and-half. I also sauteed the leeks in a small amount of butter, rather than boil them as directed. Finally, I added some dijon mustard to the cream before pouring over the potatoes for a little extra tang. Delicious!

Rating: 2
Outcome was a disappointing. The half and half curdle throughout the dish. Strong leek flavor which is okay with us. I would not make this recipe again.

Rating: 1
I also followed the recipe as written, and ended up with the cottage cheese consistency that others mention. it was dry, not creamy or cheesy, and hardly qualified as a gratin. I am so glad I wasn't making it for company as we threw the entire lot in the bin after dinner. I cannot recommend this recipe at all.

Rating: 4
Very good! My father felt it was the best gratin he had ever had. I had no trouble at all with the consisitency, although I did cook it a little longer because the rest of the meal took some extra time. I doubled the cheese, as I always do for gratins. Lots of calories, but who eats this every day?

This dish came out perfectly. Even I was impressed with the texture and consistancy of the dish. My husband and I absolutely loved this gratin. I will make it again, but only for a holiday meal! It is so rich and creamy we ate too much.

Rating: 4
I did also alter this recipe based on reviews and reading other gratin recipes. I sauteed the leeks and artichokes, used heavy cream and half stick of butter and brought to a boil before pouring over casserole.Not runny or clumpy at all, great texture. Used gruyere and parmesan and it was fabulous and loved by all at the table including the kids! Will definitely make again.

Rating: 4
Well I definately adapted this recipe based on the reviews. I made a bechamel sauce, added dublin swiss cheese, and sauteed leeks. Layered potatoes and artichokes then covered it all in the sauce. Topped it with more grated cheese and sauteed leeks. Rave reviews.

Rating: 4
After reading other reviews, I was afraid this recipe would be too liquidy. So, I sauteed the leeks and used 1 1/2 cups of light cream as opposed to the 2 cups of half and half. It turned out wonderfully, not at all soupy.

Rating: 1
i found it very hard to give this even one fork.... it was the WORST dish i have ever made. i generally make the white cheddar gratin and thought i'd make something a little different this year. ALMOST THE ENTIRE DISH WENT INTO THE TRASH! The consistency was a milky and clumpy. It tasted nasty ! I followed the direction exactly as written. Do you self a favor... Do not make this!!!

Rating: 2
This was a good concept - who doesn't like artichoke and leeks - but like everyone else has said, if you make the recipe as directed then you get kind of a gross consistency of cottage cheese. Agree as well that the leeks should be chopped and sauteed, which is what I had done.

Rating: 4
this goes in my 'keeper' file. Everyone loved it. Used whipping cream instead of half & half. Half & half is not stabilized and will separate making your dish look like cottage cheese.

Made this for Easter, it was delicious! I doubled the cheese, (using Irish Swiss), and I did not peel the potatoes. I used the prescribed amount of potatoes, and I had to use two casserole dishes for the potatoes! I used the large slicing disk on my food processor for the leeks, and used a v- slicer for the potatoes. Needed quite a bit more salt on each layer of potatoes, and I added fresh nutmeg to each layer.

This was easy and flavorful. It's a great accompanyment to lighter meats. Its also a perfect dish to make ahead and bring over to a hosts dinner. I halved the recipe but used an entire can of artichoke hearts and it was tasty.

I have made this several times since Easter 2007 and gotten lots of raves, even from those who "don't like artichokes or leeks"!. Only difference I made to recipe is to saute leeks instead of boiling, much less "liquidy"

Rating: 1
i found this recipe very frustrating. i followed everything it said, even though i was worried when at the end it says to pour the half and half over the potatoes and put it in the oven. In the end, my worries were confirmed when i pulled it out of the oven and saw that the cheese/half and half mixture had broken and were completely separated into white chunks. it was not at all creamy as stated! i think there needs to be a revision in regards to the application of dairy into the dish.

This recipe is incredible! I made it for Easter Dinner and got enthusiastic compliments. I cut the leeks into 1-inch pieces and cooked them well before adding to the rest of ingredients. I used Emmentaler cheese for the Swiss cheese, topped it with Asiago instead of Parmesan, and baked it longer than called for (until the top was very nicely browned.) Yummy!

Rating: 1
The textures in this dish didn't wok at all. The leeks needed to be chopped, as did the artichokes and both needed to be cooked down much more before assembling and baking.. The overall flavor was okay, but there are other gratin recipes on this site with better results.

Made this for Easter Brunch, there was not a crumb left, even the young ones loved it. Will definately make again.

Made this (as well as the lamb in this Easter menu). Seeing as one reviewer found it "liquid", I made mine earlier in the day, in order to reheat, so that liquid would have a chance to re-absorb. I used the Ementhaler cheese, and found that it still did not hold together well; taste was very good, and looked good with nice golden crust, but I think I was expecting better consistency.

Delicious and special. Used Jarlsberg and Romano, had no problem with extra liquid. Not a spoonful was left and I had to wrest the casserole dish from my husband, who was scraping up the last bits.

Was much better the next day. On Day 1 found there was still too much liquid.
