Great grilling summer recipe! Simple but very good, I added some fresh rosemary and thyme. Great with Lamb

A great accompaniment to Sicillian Grill- Roasted Chicken. Unfortunately, I was unable to find baby artichokes, so I substituted by using regular artichokes cut in half, and they worked. I was able to find Japanese egglplants at the farmer's market, and they were absolutely delicious! The drizzle adds wonderful flavor to the veggies.

Made one modification, since my husband doesn't like artichokes - used yellow squash instead. Had only eureka lemons - the grilling brought out incredible juices. Can make this with other types of veggies, just include the lemons. Made this with the Sicilian grill roasted chicken, but the chicken was overdone - veggies were the stars in this meal.
