This was awesome--I used home made duck stock. I served it with some of the braising liquid and that put it over the top. In addition I added a garnish of diced preserved lemon and chervil--those two things cut the richness and made the whole dish sing.

I used an heirloom pork belly from a local farmer to make this. Super easy to make, but thought it was a bit greasy...even after removing a lot of the fat from the pork belly. I made the mistake of scoring the fat and setting on the grill to crisp up - stupid! The thing briefly caught fire. On the bright side, it melted away some of the fat, but it was still pretty greasy overall. The flavor was pretty good, if a bit salty. Would try it again, maybe removing some of the fat prior to curing it. Could be that my particular belly was extra fatty. Although I say these things, the entire thing was eaten up by four people!

I tried the overnight cooking method last night (not the rub) and after 8 hours, my pork belly was not particularly tender. However, when I checked my oven temp, it turns out that it was only around 160 instead of the required 200. I raised it to 250 and cooked the pork for an additional hour and half and it turned out perfectly tender. Great method, just make sure your oven is calibrated!

This was my first attempt at cooking a pork belly. I followed the recipe exactly and cooked it over night at 200 degrees for 8 hours covered in a rich homemade chicken stock. I then let it cool in the liquid until the next day. I chose to pull it rather than sear it, my belly didn't have the nice layer of fat. I got rave reviews from some serious skeptics and it made great leftovers....I served it with some pickled radishes and black eyed peas...as well as some steamed mustard greens topped with local chevre. Yum! Can't wait to do it again!

What a fantastic recipe! I have to comment, though, on those below who claim that they had too much "spice rub" left. This is not a spice rub -- it's a cure mix. So, you bury the meat in the mix, like you would with salt pork. In doing so per the recipe, you just get perfectly succulent results.

Terrific! Served with choucroute (Alsatian sauerkraut). Tip: chill the pork belly before portioning and searing. It holds together much better. Use a rocket-hot cast iron pan or outdoor grill.

Fatastic recipe. Well worth the wait as it came out superb. I also had plenty rub left, but this will come in handy for other pork dishes, especially pork chops/ribs for the BBQ. Served the pork belly with creamy mashed potatoes and oven roasted veg. It did not need a sauce as it was moist & tender - everyone though it was excellent.

I bought some pork belly at the grocer's and bought it on a whim. Not knowing what to do with it, I tried this recipe. It turned out wonderfully and I can't wait to make more! My pork belly was pre-cut to 1"x5" strips so I cured them for 1.5 days instead of the full 3 days.

A good spice rub, but I had to make several modificaitons to the method to get the desierd results. I had a 4 pound pork belly (skin on), so I thought it would need less time. In fact, I ended up cooking it much longer to get it tender enough. 7 hours overnight, then I let it rest in the fridge during the day, then scored and seared the skin, then put it back in a 275 degree oven with enough chicken broth to come 1/2 way up the meat. I let it sit in the oven until I was ready to serve it, about 1 1/2 hours. It was perfectly tender, and would not have been had I served it after only 7 hours of cooking. I had tons of spice rub left over.

Wonderful preparation for one of my favorite cuts of meat. The cure ads the perfect amount of spice without flavors that are too pronounced. Great for a dinner party as you can make ahead and reheat(either in the oven or by pan searing). As with many braised meats, the pork belly astes even better when it's had a chance to rest and for the flavors to mature.
