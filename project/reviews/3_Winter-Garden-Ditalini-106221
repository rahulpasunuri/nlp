As other reviewers noted, it was surprisingly flavorful. I didn't find it too sweet, but I doubled up on green beans and broccoli as the other reviewers have suggested. I didn't find the parmesan to be sufficient to cover the whole dish (and I'm a fan) so I tripled the amount of parmesan cheese. Next time, I'll add some sliced chicken. It's a lot of food. I froze about half of it.

I must have done something wrong...this was one of the most generic recipes I have ever made from this site. I looked at it and wondered how it could be so "flavorful" and figured the fennel must do it. This was just veggies and pasta. Nothing special, nothing complex, very boring. I suspect it started out very healthy but I had to add so much salt and cheese to it that I probably cancelled out the health factor.

This is excellent; I plan to make this often. I added 1 cup of rinsed black beans, and 1 tsp. each of dried oregano and basil.

Very easy to make and suprisingly flavorful!

I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut back on the sweeter veggies. I also added 3/4 lb. of shrimp -- more could be added for heavier fish/meat eaters (use the medium size, and add it at the very end to let them steam through but not overcook). Cayenne pepper flakes added a nice spice! BTW, I didn't have fresh fennel on hand (my fault) but added a bit of anise -- worked well.

This was a wonderful light pasta dish. The sweet vegetables made it very satisfying to me.

This was quite tasty, very easy and kind of different. It is pretty sweet, though, with the parsnips plus carrots plus bell pepper. If I made it again I'd cut down on some of those and increase the broccoli or add a little hot pepper to balance it. The fennel adds a nice touch.
