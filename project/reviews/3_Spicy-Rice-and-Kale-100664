This is terrific - I made it with the cajun shrimp tacos so it was a perfect combination. I gave it 3 stars because it was terrific but not exceptional.

Very good and healthy. I used Bobs Red Mill whole grain wild and brown rice and it was yummy! Be careful of the salt in your spice mix. If yours doesn't have any, add 1/2 teaspoon. It needs salt just not too much.

It is good.It's not like:"OMG,yummy!" but it is a tasty and afforadble way to incoporate some grains and veggies in a way that isn't a snore (i.e,I love the creole seasoning in this recipe)! Next time,for added flavor and nutrition,I will try using brown rice and beef broth...(I'll post again here when I do!)

I made this with quinoa and it turned out really well! I also used half kale and half Swiss chard.

Definitely a great use of kale and super easy to prepare. I added about 1/2 c. cooked white beans halfway through to make it a little more substantial, then served it as the main course along with some leftover vegetables sides (coleslaw, pickled beets, and green salad). I think it would go very well with a roasted chicken, which was my plan tonight except for that the grocery store was closed due to a power outage! oh, winter... :(

This recipe is not boring at all and a great way to use Kale. Add sausage or not but healthy, easy, and flavorful. What more can you ask for?

I suspect that this would have been colossally boring as written. i fried some sausages with garlic while the kale and rice cooked and cut them up and added them at the end, and it was still not that thrilling. dressed up with some hot sauce i was not bad, but def needs more flavor.

This was quite good. Some may find the appearance a little, curious? But tasty and healthy.

I used the Tony Chachere's "More Better More Hot" seasoning, which is low sodium. Excellent recipe!

I made this with a veggie buillon cube that I dissolved in hot water, then put brown rice, the water with buillon, and the kale in the rice cooker. It came out so tasty, the rice was moist and flavorful, and with cooked onion and Tofurky italian sausage on top it was delicious. A great way to be introduced to kale.

Made this last night using the rice cooker, as suggested by the previous reviewer. It came out smelling and tasting horrible! I didn't want to just throw it away, however, so I added a jar of spaghetti sauce and some grated cheese and that did the trick. Edible, I'd say, but I wouldn't make it again. My dear husband wouldn't even touch it.

A healthy combination of rice and kale.. what more could you ask for? I would reccommend using a low sodium broth so there is not an overpowering saltiness. I made it with blackened red snapper and a black eyed pea succotash. Overall a nice tasting dish I added to my recipe box.

This is one of my favorite dishes and was the first one I put in my epicurious recipe file. The first time I made it, I didn't have cajun spices on hand, so I just created some with paprika and peppers. This dish is very forgiving of any modification you want to try. My modifications: I cook this in a rice cooker. I use brown rice (which takes a lot longer to cook) and all the kale I can possibly stuff in -- definitely don't stop at 4 ounces. I throw in some chopped tofu, which tastes fantastic after being simmered in the liquids and which adds some moisture to the dish. I know it seems obvious, but be sure to put the rice in the bottom of the rice cooker with the liquids; once I tried adding it on top of the kale, and that didn't work at all. I think if you eat something this healthy, you will live forever.

Very easy, tasty, and a good low-fat way to get kale into my diet (more greens! I have been told). Next time I will double the Cajun spice (the recipe was a too bland for me) or add garlic as others have suggested.

Haven't made this yet, but intend to try it. For those who, like me, look for low-salt recipes, go to the foodtv web site, get Emiril's special seasoning recipe, and make your own without salt.

We love this recipe, especially when we add tomatoes. It is easy to make and tastes great. Although we usually try to avoid healthy foods, we don't mind the "good for you" qualities of this recipe.

I found the Cajan seasoning to be icky with this!!!! I prefer kale with chopped garlic and chick peas. I served this to a crew on our commercial fishing boat,some thought it was o.k. and others disliked it. Over all 7 people gave it a don't re-do!

My entire family enjoyed this dish. It was a bit too spicy for my little one but she picked out the Kale and gobbled it up. I added chopped tomato.

We followed the recipe exactly (using collard greens, though, instead of kale) and thought the dish tasted good but not great. I added a little salt to the finished product after sampling it, but in order to avoid going overboard on sodium I would probably look for a Cajun spice mix with more spice, not more sodium. The recipe was very easy to make, however, and likely healthy.

I must really like this recipe cuz I keep coming back to it. This time I used double the Cajun spices and it came out with a nice little bite. I also used collard greens instead of kale. Everyone I served it to loved it. Still think I should add a little chopped garlic next time.

Easy and delicious. It goes well with cottage cheese for a work-night, easy, nutritious dinner.

This is a simple, yet DELICIOUS recipe! I make it all the time.

I didn't like this as much as everyone else seems to have. Maybe the brand of cajun season makes a difference.

Very good -- low-fat, healthy, delicious -- who could ask for more? Even the kale-haters in my family liked this dish! I worried about the amount of cajun seasoning in the recipe, because it is such a salty seasoning mix, but it was the perfect amount (I used both Paul Prudhomme's brans and Tony Cherere's brand).

I made this to go with the recipe for Seafood and Turkey-Sausage Gumbo (Bon Appetit (2/99). I used short grain rice and put everything in the rice cooker. Turned out great.

I couldn't find kale the day I went to the market so I used Spinach. It was fantastic
