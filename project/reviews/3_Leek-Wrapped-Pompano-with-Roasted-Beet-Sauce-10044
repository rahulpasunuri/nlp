I think there are lots of alternative for cooking a fish, perhaps some not so creative, but much better-tasting. It's out of my book now.

I made this with petrale sole. A little effort but it worked well.

The quality of the fish makes or breaks this dish. the presentation is beautifule with the green of the leeks the white flesh of the fish and the deep red of the sauce. It made a nice visual at my annual Xmas dinner. I loved the sauce but others found it uninteresting.

My local fresh fish supplier had Pompano that had been caught fresh the morning I was there. I had never eaten this fish previously, but learning that it is the most expensive fish per pound to purchase, I had to try it. When I searched my computer for a method of cooking, this recipe caught my eye. I followed the recipe entirely and both my wife (not usually fond of fish) and myself were blown away with the delicate taste of the pompano not to overlook the unique consitency of the fillets that seem to have a dover sole meatiness to them. This is one of those rare recipes that will haunt you until you make it again.
