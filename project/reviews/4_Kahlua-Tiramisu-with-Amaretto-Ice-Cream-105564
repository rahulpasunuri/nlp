Really good. Slightly reduced gelatin, because I didn't want it set too solid. I didn't make the ice cream, but used vanilla gelato instead. I would make again, but also not sold that this is the "best" out there.

Fantastic recipe, a crowd pleaser, Ill definitely be making this Tiramisu again! After reading other reviews, I wanted to avoid the jello-y firmness that some people experienced. The gelatin is great insurance, especially if youre hand whipping, but you can cut down on the gelatin if you can get your whipping cream into firm peaks. I also added an extra splash of Marsala to the gelatin and extra splash of whipping cream to increase the liquid to gelatin ratio. When heating the Marsala/egg yolk mixture I gently whisked instead of stirred. Its important to get this mixture to a pale yellow by incorporating some air; it also helps keep the final mixture light and fluffy. I doubled the espresso mix, because I hate to run out. I lined the sides of the pan with lady fingers, tops facing outward, and only dipped the bottom-side of these cookies. This makes for an impressive presentation. I did 3 layers, which required ~1 ¾ packages of lady fingers. Served it 24 hours later, topped with a dollop of freshly whipped cream and a scoop of Baileys Haagen-Daas. Delicious!

This recipe has very good flavor, but the texture, for me, was not quite right. It was very gelled and I prefer it a little more creamy. Next time maybe one tsp of the gelatin.

This is by far the best Tiramisu recipe I've ever had. This has become my signature birthday cake for all my friends. The only change I make is to double the coffee dipping liquid, otherwise I run out.

I love this recipe! The only thing I've changed is that I make a little extra of the kahlua / coffee sauce. I like the lady fingers really soaked. I've never tried making the ice cream.

The taste of this tiramisu is exceptional! Not too difficult to make, and certainly the perfect end to any Italian meal. I used one 8oz marscarpone with one 8oz cream cheese - very good! I also assembled the entire dessert in a trifle - lovely!

I have made this several times and it is always a hit. Sometimes i use 1/4 cup marsala and 1/2 cup Kahlua. I think the marsala can be overpowering depending on the brand. I love it!

it's a husband /wife collab, i make the tiramisu and he makes the amaretto ice cream...this recipe works well as a trifle

It was very well received by my friends and colleagues. I also ened up with more mascarpone mixture than I needed. Dessert goes down very well with a cup of green tea.

I liked this, made it with the extra ladyfingers as suggested. Used chocolate leaves for the top instead of cocoa or ground chocolate. I thought it was a little stiff and heavy for me. Might try adding more whipping cream incorporated into the base to lighten it up a bit,

LRoddenberry, did you cool the mascarpone custard (zabaglione) before folding in the whipped cream? I'm assuming you did not, hence why it curdled. Whipped cream should never be added to anything that contains heat, as it melts and separates On another note, great Tiramisu! One of the best I've ever had!

When I added the warm marscapone custard to the whipped cream it curdled/separated. What did I do wrong?

Hello. Have a question- regarding the ladyfingers, when the instructions say to "DIP HALF" the cookie, do you dip the length of only half the cookie and leave the other dry, or just dip one side at a time, eventually coating both sides?? Help!

Rating: 4
This was easy and unbelievably delicious! I made it in a 9x13 pan to serve to a large group. I made it with Frangelico instead of Marsala and Kahlua. Also just used ladyfingers. My market had a coffee flavored marscapone which was a nice addition. It was not too sweet, and so creamy and good! I topped it with extra whipped cream and chocolate shavings and it made a great presentation. Very impressive dessert.

Made this dessert for supper club with Italian theme tonight--it was great! I used a 10" springform pan and decided to line the sides with the ladyfingers, and to do two layers, as suggested by other reviewers. To do that, I needed 2 packages of 26 lady fingers each, for a total of 52, vs. 26 as called for in recipe using 8" pan. It's a very impressive dessert--looked store bought! It's a keeper here!

Wow!! This is our new favorite dessert! Our guests love it, and all asked for the recipe. We used fresh brewed espresso coffee, and added more Kahlua than the recipe calls for, to give a stronger coffee flavor. Really superb!

Rating: 4
Excellent! I had to make a couple minor changes because I didn't have the ingredients on hand: used Kahlua instead of Marsala, and replaced water with Kahlua (in general lots of Kahlua :)) Nonetheless, the tiramisu turned out wonderfully. Everybody loved it. As some other reviewers suggested, I would probably omit the sugar in the whipped cream next time; the marscapone mixture was sweet enough and serve it a day later, as it tasted even better the day after I made it.

The first time I made this was my first time making tiramisu. It was the perfect first time recipe! I didn't have Kahlua (thought I did), so I substituted amaretto and I did brew my own espresso. I used only ladyfingers which I found at Trader Joe's. Two packages was enough to line an 8" springform pan (nice presentation!) and make three layers as some had suggested. It worked out beautifully, and got great reviews from avid tiramisu lovers. This is one recipe to hold on to!

Am definitely going to make this recipe again! I got rave reviews. Even the friend who doesn't like tiramisu really liked this recipe! I used double the coffee (no espresso) like someone else suggested and did three layers of lady fingers, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

I made this fabulous desert for a dinner party of 26...so i actually made up two! I got rave reviews from several people who claim to really know their tiramisu! From reading other recipies before deciding on this one, I am positive that the addition of the gelatin contibutes to a fail safe presentation! Thanks to some great hints and advise, I used frozen pound cake for the layers, and the lady fingers just to line the edge of the pan. I also used amaretto instead of the marsala, and was generous with the kahlua :) This desert was definately rich enough by itself, so I served it without the icecream, and instead, a nice flute of champagne.

Outstanding! Quite a crowd pleaser. I'd recommend getting an extra package of Lady Fingers and stand them on end (browned side out) and line the sides of the springform pan with them. Makes a great presentation.

I made this for New Year's Eve and everyone loved it, including me! Lining the pan all around the edges with upright ladyfingers made it very impressive. I used strong coffee in lieu of espresso powder and needed to double the amount. I only used half the cocoa on to. I lined the pan with foil in case of leakage. Awesome!

The store didn't have ladyfingers (apparently they're considered a specialty food item) so I made cake layers from the Tiramisu Wedding Cake recipe on this website. Even though I accidentally overbaked it a little, it still came out very well. Liberally brushing the coffee mix onto the cake layers hid the dryness perfectly. Made three layers, used choppped chocolate between each layer and on top instead of the cocoa powder. Had leftover coffee mix so I added a little gelatin to that and mixed it right in with the remaining custard before spreading it onto the top layer. Cake is rich yet fluffy and not too sweet. Serve thin slices, because a little goes a long way.

Delicious and not bad for a first attempt at Tiramisu. I do think that in the future I would do the coffee mixture as a double and increase the lady fingers by one more package to make three layers of lady fingers rather than 2 because there was so much marscapone cheese mixture for two layers. Very delicious though!

Rating: 3
Didn't have marsala so subbed with Kahlua. I thought the marscapone mixture was too sweet and I think it may have been with the Kahlua substitution (should have reduced the sugar!). Made it the day before and on the first night I had it, I didn't think the cream mixture was very smooth in texture and too sweet. However, over the course of the next three days, I found I liked the tiramisu more and more.

OMGsh-OMGsh this was EXTREMELY HEAVENLY!! I made this for dessert for a dinner party and everyone just melted! I personally find that using lady fingers makes the presentation a bit sloppy looking, so I use the cake recipe from "Tiramisu Wedding Cake with Mixed Berries" cut in half. The extra cake was just delicious to eat warm out of the oven. Using a cake is easier and tastes much better. To top of my Tiramisu, I used whipped heaving cream flavord with a little sugar and dusted with cocoa powder. For my friends birthday I GENTLY placed a beautiful cutout design on the cake, sifted the cocoa and removed the cutout, it came out FANTASTIC - Extremely 5-Star quality and appeal!!

This is excellent! I made 2 sponge cake layers instead of lady fingers. Two thin layers plus custard filled the 9-inch springform pan to the top. Grated chocolate on each layer. The gelatin was a great addition. I used Coffee liquor in the custard and also in the expresso liquid. Two cups was not enough. I will try three cups in the remake today.

This is a great recipe. The only change that I make is to use brewed espresso instead of the instant. But I am sure it would be the same either way. Makes a beautiful presentation at a Italian dinner party.

This dish was a new one for me.... I made it for my boyfriend for his birthday. It came out perfect. I wasn't that difficult to make, just lot of steps. But, it was fun. The gelation really made the cake hold together nicely. I actually decorated it, so it looked like a birthday cake. We both loved it.

I've made this twice and must say this is absolutely the best tiramisu I have ever tasted! I would suggest using an 8" x 3" springform pan lined with standing ladyfingers. Otherwise, it's total perfections!!!

Our neighborhood Dinner Club's theme recently was "Taste of Tuscany" and I made this for dessert. Everyone loved it. I lined the rim of the pan with lady fingers (standing up) before adding the filling- it made for a beautiful presentation. Also added shaved chocolate between layers and on the top as suggested. Couldn't find Amaretto ice cream so used Haagen-Dazs Bailey's Irish Cream Ice Cream - perfect! This recipe was easy, quick, beautiful and delicious!

A real crowd pleaser - very good recipe. I made a few changes - used frozen pound cake instead of biscuits, and used water instead of Marsala. Nice to be able to cut this dessert and see the layers. Doesn't need any ice cream with it - great all by itself!

I made this dessert for easter and it was an absolute hit! I had a little leakage problem because i think i soaked the lady fingers a bit much, but overall it was delicious. I used a bit mor wipping cream to make the mousse stiffer, worked wonderful!

I made this as dessert for an Italian-themed bridal shower and it was awesome! I followed other cooks advice and used strong coffee and Kahula; instead of Marsala, I used amaretto--very good. In addition, grocery shopping w/o list left me with 24 ounces of the marscapone and double the whip cream. I used it all--reserved some of the whip cream for the top--and it was perfect. Grated chocolate between the layers is a must!

Great recipe! but I didn't have spring form pan to make it nice layer, is there any trick to make nice layer?

This recipe turned out great. The taste and the presentation were awesome. I followed other suggestions and added extra Kahlua, used already brewed strong coffee, made three layers instead of two, and topped it off with whipped cream. I also added chopped chocolate between the layers and on top of the whipped cream. It was a nice touch. I'll definately make it again.

I used water instead of Marsala and it still came out great. I did not have time to set it over night in the fridge, so I set it in the freezer for one hour and I could not be more pleased.

Made it for the first time for guests and it was a big hit! Took advice of others and made it three layers, added an extra shot (or so) of Kahlua and dipped the lady fingers in extra strong cooled coffee instead of expresso powder/water.

Was extremely rich! This would be a pretty good recipe with a few tweaks: Add another layer of lady fingers and brush a little more kahlua on top of them after soaking the bottom half in the espresso mixture, sprinkle chopped chocolate to one of the layers, marscapone layer should be no thicker than 1/4 inch, and top off with a layer of whipped cream!

Made this exactly as written, and there were no complaints from my guests, but personally to give it three forks, I would make three layers of ladyfingers, or use pound cake layers, and use more of the expresso mixture. To me, there was not a strong enough coffee presence. The marscapone custard was excellent though and overall it is a very good tiramisu.

I made this for a cocktail party I hosted. I cut the tiramisu into 1 inch pieces and found the texture was firm enough to stand alone for some time. Nice flavor from the marsala, but I would have liked to have tasted a stonger presence of Kahlua.

This was a huge hit with my friends! It presented beautifully. The only thing was I over-dipped the 1st layer of biscuits (causing some leakage)then barely had enough liquid to finish the 2nd layer.

Delicious. I made this for a party this weekend and everyone seemed to enjoy it immensely. I did add a few finishing touches to the recipe however. I very lightly dusted the top of the tiramisu with cocoa powder and then piped the top of it with an ameretto-chocolate whipped cream (I did not make the ameretto ice cream). I also coated the sides of the tiramisu with slivered almonds. The presentation was very nice. Forget about the diet...totally sin city!

This is wonderful! I went to a lot of trouble to make this (we live in a small town and had to drive 60 miles to the nearest city to buy mascarpone and Marsala), but it was worth it. Our group of friends had just returned from a trip to Rome, and we decided the tiramisu was (almost) as good as any we had in Italy. I followed the recipe exactly, but didn't make the ice cream. We certainly didn't need it!

I made this recipe to bring to a dinner party, and it was a huge hit! It set up beautifully, and I had no trouble cutting it. My friends loved it, said it was some of the best they had ever tasted, and begged for the recipe. The only thing I would alter was the way I dipped the lady fingers - I dunked them in perpendicular to the coffee, and I should have laid them in on their side. I probably misunderstood the recipe - mea culpa. It was still phenomenal.

Supurb! I did not make the Amaretto icecream - I just made the tiramisue. I've had tiramisue from Ferrara's in NYC and this recipe is even better - but only if you like Kaluha. It took me an hour to prepare. Very rich - great flavor and texture. I did not use a springform pan - I just put it in a regular 9x13 lasagna pan and used extra ladysfingers (had to make double quantity of the dipping liquid). This recipe made A LOT - there is probably 12 or more servings. Will definately make it again for my tiramisue loving friends.

This dessert was fabulous. The first time I made it with the Marsala and it was good, but the second time I substituted Kahlua and it was terrific. Next time I might try Amaretto.

Made this the other night. I guess it's not good for a person to make this without ever trying a Tiramisu. I didn't know that this was more of a custard texture than the "whipped creamy" version. People still liked it, but thought the texture was different. It was easy to make, though, but I think I'll try another recipe with a different texture.

I tried this recipe for a dinner party I gave last night, it is absolutely delicious, some of my guests returned today to have leftovers with a cup of coffee, it is even better after 2 days. I'll definitely make often.
