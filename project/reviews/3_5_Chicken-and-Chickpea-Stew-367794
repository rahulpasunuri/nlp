This dish was "missing something" as my husband said. We ended up putting Sriacha (sp) sauce on it. I followed the recipe exactly, even putting the more coriander in a little before it finished cooking as one reviewer recommended. It doesn't make it as a Moroccan dish and a similar Indian cauliflower and chick pea dish on this web site was more interesting. Too bad as it is healthy and has simple ingredients.

This is an easy, flavourful, and filling stew. I used chicken thighs, cut into 1 inch pieces, subbed quinoa for the couscous to keep it gluten free, and used fresh mint and as garnish. I think I might add a half tsp of curry or spice of some kind next time, as I did miss that dimension, but it's great to know I could serve it as written to my spice-conscious friends.

Really delicious - I love the North African flavors that the cinnamon and cumin lend. I made this vegetarian by swapping veggie broth for chicken and adding cubes of firm tofu in the last few minutes of cooking (just so they'd get hot and absorb some of the flavors).

I am so pleasantly surprised with the way this turned out. Easy, tasty, and healthy. A few modifications based on what I had, which I will use next time: chicken breasts with bone and skin and so simmered them a little longer. Then shredded meat and discarded bones & skin. 28 oz can of whole toms. Raw spinach added to bowl before adding stew. Will have it again soon.

Was even more delicious than I had expected and very easy to make.

This is delicious, filling, easy and healthy. You don't really need to follow instructions and measurements exactly, after the first time you can play by ear. I am also not convinced you need the zucchini. Important not to overdo the cinnamon though so it doesn't overpower the other flavors. I do recommend adding a few handfuls of cilantro, not just as garnish but in the actual cooking process. This has become a staple in my household!

This recipe was wonderful! Quick and easy and full of flavor that keeps you full. I added garam masala that I had on hand and really thought it was good but it would be fine without. Great weeknight find!

This was a very delicious meal that could easily be made vegetarian since couscous and chickpeas are so filling. Instead of zucchini, I used diced butternut squash and added extra cumin. Also, I added a bit of coriander and cayenne for some extra spice.

This was quick, easy, delicious, healthy, and didn't have fancy ingredients that required a last-minute grocery store dash. The broth was suprisingly substantial, probably because of the tomatoes, not watery like a basic chicken or vegetable broth. The cinnamon and cumin add such nice, but subtle, flavor.

Started this dish and didn't realize I hadn't any cinnamon, so I used curry powder. Loved it. Will make this again.

I am not rating this because I modified it by substituting tofu and fresh tomatoes for chicken and canned tomatoes, but even with these substitutions it was FABULOUS! A perfect healthy, warm weeknight meal.

I made this for a quick weeknight dinner. I cut the chicken breasts into cubes but made everything else according to the recipe. It was easy to make and delicious. This will be a keeper for an easy, healthy dinner option.

Since the other 2 posts are quite cryptic, I am actually reviewing this recipe! It is FANTASTIC. Significant other loves this as well and we're making it again tonight! This recipe lends itself well to any vegetables on hand. Have made it with yellow & green squash, tonight with carrots & celery. The flavors are wonderful in this stew. The Mr. likes it over noodles while I prefer whole wheat couscous, so we're both happy. Try this wonderful, healthy recipe!!!
