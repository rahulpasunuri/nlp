I have used this dip recipe countless times with grilled smoked sausages. It is outstanding, easy, and loved by everyone who tastes it!

I, too, have made this repeatedly over the years. It's especially good with grilled sausages.

I have used this recipe for years when entertaining...since it first appeared in Bon Appetit. I get raves each and every time I serve it.

This sweet chutney has a great and unuasual flavor. The curry gives it an uncomparable taste that is great with shellfish.
