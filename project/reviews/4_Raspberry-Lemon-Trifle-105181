I thought this trifle was very good. I made it for a july 4th party and was looking for something light and festive. I sliced the pound cake and let it sit for a day or 2 (a trick my mom taught me about trifle). Also, i cheated and bought 2 jars of Stonewall Lemon Curd. I used a mixture of 2 bags of frozen berries and fresh strawberries and raspberries and added a heap of sliced strawberries to the top of the whip cream. Most people loved it and it made a beautiful presentation. I think I would add some type of liquor next time, perhaps limoncello, chambord, or kirsh.

Made this for a family dinner and received rave reviews. I used local raspberries and blackberries. I made a lemon pound cake from this site that worked well. The only thing I will change next time is that I will use lemoncello and make 50% more lemon curd.

Used this recipe as a way to use the leftovers from the Raspberry Lemon Heart Cakes that I had in the freezer. Also took some of the liberties suggested by other reviewers(Lemoncello for the syrup, mixing 1/2 of the whipped cream with the lemon curd to lighten it up) I actually whipped the cream in two steps, 1 cup at a time. Because I was making it with ingredients I had on hand I substituted frozen wild blueberries for the raspberries. The flavor combo was great but the appearance would be better with fresh fruit-the berries turned a blueish grey next to the cake/curd/cream mixture. But definitely no Cool Whip for this household!!!

I've made this twice now - once with the strawberries, as suggested by other reviewers, and once with raspberries. I definitely think the strawberries are the winning berry in the match up. The raspberry was okay, more than edible, but the strawberries added a nice hint of sweetness whereas the raspberries were quite tart - even with the sugar. Also, I used the lemon curd recipe from the 2001 Gourmet found on this site.

Very tasty desert, although you can't eat too much at once. It wouldn't be a bad idea to double the amount of lemon curd in this recipe.

A refreshing summer dessert. We made it on the 4th of July and added blueberries and strawberries to give it a little more patriotic flare. The blueberries really evened out the tartness of the raspberries. The strawberries were unnecessary. I would have liked a little sweetness in the cream so will probably add a tablespoon or two of powdered sugar next time. Overall, a great tasting dessert which can be modified to fit your tastes.

We thought this recipe was good, but it was a little too tart for our taste. My husband usually loves everything I make from this site, and he thought it was good, but not outstanding. I think people who tried it with strawberries may be onto something; the raspberry/lemon combo was just too tangy tart for us.

I made this for a couples dinner and it was well-received, but it didnt produce peals of oohs and aahs. Since there were only six of us, I divided the recipe in two and assembled it in individual martini glasses, topping each with the berries and a sprig of mint. In retrospect I think you could have used twice the lemon curd and whipped cream, but otherwise it was a refreshing end to the meal.

I have made this many times. It is amazing. I bit of preparation, but worth it. If you love lemon and custard, you will like this.

I made this recipe exactly as it is except I used an Entenmann's pound cake. It is a really great summer dessert recipe and I get raves for it every time I make it. One of my friends even said it was so delicious he just wanted to stick his face in it. As far as store bought vs, homemade, I say it's cooking, have fun with it and do what works for you.

If making this for a crowd that includes children or teetotalers, I make it as written. If making for "The Ladies Who Lunch", I substitute lemoncello for the lemon syrup and brush rather than drizzle it on the pound cake slices. I also macerate the berries in a little framboise instead of sugar. And, add a little homemade vanilla extract (vanilla infused vodka) to the whipped cream. If I'm making this for a pot luck and I know it is going to sit on the buffet for a while, I beat 1 part mascapone into 3 parts heavy cream to help preserve the texture of the whipped cream while it stands. One of the women that asked me for the recipe tried substituting angel food cake for the pound cake and cool whip for the whipped cream. The cool whip was acceptable, the angel food cake didn't work.

Everthing I like is either fattening or wrong to do..lol. So, I improvise, being diabetic, I make my own cake using sugar substitute and fresh berries. Low fat cool whip saves on calories & fat, so I use it. I love natural foods as they are recommended for good health, however, condition does not permit it all the time. This recipe is terrific and will make again. Enjoy!!

I thought this recipe was fantastic. I layered the whipping cream with the cake/lemon curd layers. Has anyone done that instead of putting all of the cream on top? It certainly wasn't soggy - maybe even a bit too dry. I also used store lemon curd and it was still very good. I agree with using cool whip if I was making this for just my family - no need for all those fat calories except for special parties!

Everyone LOVES this, and I've made it over and over since it was first published in 2001. I now take short cuts galore when I prepare, and believe me, it is still a family favorite. I use jarred lemon curd, I substitute strawberries for raspberries (and even use frozen strawberries for the center sections), and I use cool whip (shhhh, don't tell). Like I said, it's still absolutely YUMMY!!!

I have made this at least a dozen times since the recipe first appeared. It's my go-to dessert for summer parties. I have always used good-quality jarred lemon curd, as I've never found that homemade is worth the extra effort in a dish like this...with that change, the dish takes no time to put together.

I made this for a BBQ and it was a hugh hit! Easy to make. I followed the directions but goofed and did not have enough fresh lemon juice and used jar lemon juice and did not notice in the end result. A guest requested I make it for her cookout. I will make this one again and again.

I made this last night and added the whipped cream and berries this am. for a teacher lunch, and it was devoured. Great contrast to all the cookies and chocolate they had, and one teacher said 'It was to die for!' I followed recipe as written, with shortcuts of Trader Joe's curd (two jars) and two packages of frozen raspberries, thawed and drained over the course of two hours, then garnished with a half-pint of fresh berries. It has a lovely fresh taste you want more and more of!

Excellent trifle. I also lightened the curd with whipped cream to make a mousse. Next time, would make an extra half recipe of curd. I strained the curd before mixing with the cream.

I made the recipe exactly as is and it is a sublime treat. The lemony cake and fresh raspberries meet with the sweet cream and it is dazzling. I encourage the use of fresh raspberries. Served this at a birthday celebration to high acclaim.

I made this for my Mom's retirement party and got rave reviews. Since I was preparing several dishes I took an additional shortcut and used 2 jars of Trader Joe's lemon curd. I thought it was great but not over the top. I'll probably try it with a mix of berries next time.

I didn't double the lemon curd as some reviewers suggested, I whipped 1 cup of cream and folded it into the lemon curd to make a lemon curd mousse. I layered the cake, mousse and berries (a mix of raspberries, stawberries and blueberries) and topped with unsweetened whipped cream. I decorated with a mound of fresh raspberries in the centre of the trifle. Delicious! Everybody had seconds.

I changed some things around. Made my own pound cake (Martha Stewart's) put it didn't turn out the way I liked it; also used frozen mixed berries. This dessert was ok, if you like tart lemony desserts - I guess I just prefer the "traditional" trifle with strawberries and vanilla pudding... I just wasn't that impressed with this overall dish (granted, it was probably my fault). The lemon curd was nice, though. I doubled it, "fished" out the white clumps and strained the curd before chilling. The curd turned out beautifully! I didn't think it was too sweet at all.

To make it super quick, I purchased lemon curd (I found Dickinson's to be best) as well. I only used the recommended 3 Tb. of syrup per layer and had no sogginess, even on the second day (I did have syrup left over, however). Delicious!!

have made this several times, always resulting in raves. haven't tried increasing the amount of curd but will, since that's the best part of the dish.

I took this to a potluck and received rave reviews on presentation and flavor! I doubled the lemon curd and used frozen raspberries (I used the small amount of leftover lemon curd to make individual trifles). I found that the trifle got too soggy when I made it the night before; much better when it only sat for 6-8 hours before serving. Easy recipe that was a huge hit!

Rating: 4
Took advice from others and made 1 1/2 recipes of curd (use Martha Stewart's recipe for this, it's excellent). I also made it the day I was serving it since some others said it got soggy otherwise.....great advice, it worked perfectly. Great dessert, everyone loved it.

This is a fabulous dessert. I follow the recipe to the T with the added step of straining the lemon curd before chilling. I have made it several times and always receive rave reviews.

A very canny English cook told me to always strain my eggs though a sieve to get rid of the white goop in the eggs when making lemon curd. It gives a much better texture, so you don't get that grainy taste in your mouth.A little extra work but WELL worth it.

Rating: 2
so many things to say about this recipe... first, use the lemon curd recipe from the lemon mousse with fresh berries. i've made that lemon curd a zillion times and it's so much better than the one in this recipe. this one is way too sweet, the whites coagulated a bit while cooking, and it tastes grainy. second, i must've mushed the berries too much, but the trifle doesn't have the nice layers that it has in the picture (i've never made trifle before). i'd probably say to do 1 1/2 x the lemon curd - i doubled it and it seems like too much. anyway, my end result looks like a big lemony mess. the lemon ran over the sides as did the berry juice. i'll definitely play with it next time, maybe make cake layers to fit the trifle bowl. also, i had to reboil the syrup after it chilled - it wasn't syrupy enough. so i boiled it for like 10 minutes and then chilled it in an ice bath before proceeding.

I have made this recipe several times a summer since published, and want to share my tips: substitute strawberries for the raspberries (because the lemon curd is tart, I like the contrast the sweeter strawberries provide), double the lemon curd, make it a triple layer, and only make up to four hours ahead. If it sits in the fridge overnight as recommended, I find the texture of the pound cake unappealing-- too soggy. Enjoy this-- it's so refreshing when you want a different, lighter tasting dessert after a hot summer barbecue.

I would definitely make this again, however, I did replace the cake with ladyfingers and everyone loved it. Marrying the raspberry and lemon made a nice light flavor. I also had to double the recipe to fit my trifle dish.

The flavor combo and presentation are great here! I cheated a bit and used 2 jars of purchased lemon curd. I was in a hurry and this saved soooo much time and still tasted wonderful. I used a combination of fresh raspberries and blackberries. Attractive, easy and yumm!!!

This trifle was delicious and very lemony. I wouldn't say it was a dish "beyond compare" but it is definitely one of the nicest trifles I have had. I doubled the lemon curd (a must!) but beyond that I followed the recipe exactly. Will definitely make again when raspberries are on sale!

I'm not going to score the recipe because I didn't follow it exactly, but since I find the comments so helpful I wanted to add my two cents. I used the easy and delicious Lemon-Sour Cream Pound Cake from this site instead of store-bought and the lemon curd from the Lemon Mousse with Fresh Berries recipe (lightened with a little whipped cream) because I realized too late that I was out of butter. I made it the morning of and chilled about four hours and that was fine. The extra lemon in the cake gave it a nice kick, and layered with thawed frozen raspberries and fresh strawberries it was absolutely delicious. My book club devoured it. Would definitely make it again!

This was very good. I cut the pound cake into smaller pieces. I doubled the curd and my only suggestion is to try to remove the white stringy things from the eggs before mixing them - they don't disapear in the curd. Other than that this is a very tasty recipe and everyone seemed impressed. Thanks Epicurious!

This trifle was delicious. It does get soggy rather quickly from the berries and the syrup so I recommend putting the layers together the day it will be used. The curd is delicious, but doesn't cover the layers very much--do double the amount.

I made this for a July 4th picnic last month, to rave reviews. Instead of fresh raspberries, I substituted one layer of defrosted, frozen raspberries and one layer of defrosted, frozen blackberries. On top I used fresh blueberries. The frozen berries worked perfectly in the middle and the red/white/blue combo made for a great holiday dessert. When I make this again (not if, I've had a zillion requests for it already!) I'll probably double the lemon curd. It was my favorite part!

This was very easy and made a pretty presentation. I did 2 (in trifle bowls) for a ladies' brunch for 30 I catered and we had leftovers. I used strawberries instead of raspberries, primarily for cost considerations and it worked very well. I did think the recipe could have used a little more lemon curd, and I have other lemon curd recipes I like better. This one is rather "eggy" rather than strong lemon flavor.

Wonderful dessert. This is great for a crowd, easily serves 16. Expensive to make with raspberries, but really good. I served it in tall glasses, which made a nice presentation of the layers. The lemon peel in the curd added a really nice little texture to the whole combination of flavors. This dish will hold-up for 2 days quite well. I used most of 2, 10 oz frozen Sara Lee pound cakes and assembled it about 8 hours before the meal.

Made half the recipe and it fed six with lots left over. I substituted strawberries for the raspberries (too expensive) and it worked very well. The trifle does get to be unappetizing after a few nights in the fridge, however-- soggy, and watery, so try to eat it up the day it's made.
