So disappointed in this recipe. I should have read the reviews before making it, but how can anything with browned butter be bad? Nice flavor and smelled devine while cooking, but SO SO dry. I'll try it again, but only with modifications--either more butter or I'll take the advice of another reviewer and perhaps add some alcohol.

I LOVED this. Served it at a brunch and everyone raved over it. I did use a little more butter than was called for, which I think helps with the dryness some are complaining about.

I got this recipe from the magazine and so did not read the review first. so funny that my adaption made it yummy and more moist! I wanted something for holiday gifts so I added 1/2 cup of rum to the mix and while at it, 1 cup of chopped walnuts. House smelled divine and cake was superb; I unknowingly corrected the need for more moisture and this is a real keeper!

It wasn't dry at all and it was delicious. I used all purpose flour (minus two tablespoons per cup of flour) since that's what I had on hand, and it came out wonderfully.

Good Cake recipe that can be made better. Great start to a fine dessert

The only thing I modified (because of complaints of dryness) was add an extra TBS of of butter. It came out moist and flavorful.

I thought this was excellent and didn't have any issues with the dryness that other reviewers mention. I made it as written, with the only exception being that I already had brown butter in the fridge, so I didn't measure it exactly; maybe I used a bit more than others? Mine was definitely dense but quite moist (except on the outside, where it got pleasantly crispy in a way that seemed unusual for pound cake).

This was tasty, and the house smelled great while it was baking, but like other reviewers, I found it dry. Flavor was good, so I may experiment with adding more moisture.

I baked this pound cake this morning. Smells awesome. Good flavor. But, I too found it dry. Excellent choice as a base for a fall trifle though. I'm using roasted pears, apricot preserves, almonds, sherry, and a basic custard. While it hasn't had a chance to properly meld, the little tasting portion that I made for myself is very promising.

I love brown butter, but I did not care for this poundcake. It was much too dense and dry. We didn't even finish it.

don't do as I did and use a smaller loaf pan. Otherwise it'll bake unevenly and you'll have a pound cake that's on the dry side. That said, this recipe was very easy to follow, the smell of the butter browning had me salivating, and even though the pound cake was a little dry, people still ate it up at brunch.

There are few more satisfying moments in life than when the newest Gourmet arrives and you have everything on hand for a recipe that looks absolutely irresistible. I made this w/in minutes of taking the October issue out of my mailbox. The pound cake is nutty and buttery with hints of caramel and vanilla. It's absolutely lovely.
