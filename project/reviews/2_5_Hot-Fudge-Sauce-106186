I like that this recipe is easy to prepare, but I didn't like the overwhelming flavor of butter. My solution was to substitute the 1/2 cup of butter with 1/4 cup of butter and 1/4 cup heavy cream. I like the flavor and texture better this way and it is a big hit with my friends and family.

I feel the need to defend this recipe. I have not tried the other hot fudge recipes, but as I like the texture of chewy hot fudge when it hits the cold ice cream, this is a great recipe. I agree that maybe using half bittersweet, half semi-sweet might be a better balance. This recipe is simple and quick, with ingredients easily on hand. I love it, and so do my sons!

The corn syrup overpowered the taste and made it sickly sweet. My husband said it had a "fake" smooth texture, again, because of the corn syrup. My kids, who will eat anything sweet, said it was good, but for the adults it didn't fit the bill as a good, fudgey, natural tasting sauce.

This sauce is super easy and quick to prepare. It gets very chewy as it cools on ice cream. I liked it, my husband who is a chocolate lover really like it.
