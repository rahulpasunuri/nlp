Fantastically good. I topped with a splash of Chambord, raspberries, and a mint leaf. Poured them into small goblets and they looked like I spent hours in the kitchen. No one has to know how easy this recipe is.

These adorable, easy-to-make desserts are absolutely delicious -- they are an extended family favorite around here. This recipe skips fussy steps from other panna cotta recipes, such cooking it in a water bath or inverting it before serving. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

Made to recipe and found it to be a smidgen too sweet. Maybe 1/3 cup of sugar with the cream instead of 1/2. That said, it was delicious! Set up well in three hours. Silky smooth texture. Topped with straight fresh blueberries.

Great recipe! I didn't change anything. I wasn't sure about the balsamic vinegar and berries -- but my vinegar hating husband LOVED them!

My cousin made this dessert for my birthday dinner and it was an absolute hit. It was just the right amount of sweetness, and so creamy and rich. It was better than the panna cotta that I had in Italy a few weeks ago.

Mmmm, Mmmm, Great. I used custard cups and added blueberry syrup to coat the bottom of the cup, so when I took a knife to the edges it came out beautifully. I got a gold star rating from my husband on this one. Sooooo easy to make.

great-loved that I could pour it into glasses and not have to use custard cups and unmold like other panna cottas
