Nothing special.

I guess I must suck at chopping because it took me a long time to chop all the veggies for this recipe! I doubled the "essence" as per another reviewer's recommendation-if I hadn't there wouldn't have been NEARLY enough sauce. For all the work and TIME this entailed, it just didn't pay off. Not good enough.

A really delicious and versatile recipe. I doubled the "essence" part of the recipe, and used mushrooms, green beans, brocolli, asparagus, carrots, celery and onions for vegies, and then substituted sauteed chicken breasts for the tofu. The ginger flavor is nice but not overwhelming - it's a terrific sauce! Served over jasmine rice w. garlic, ginger and cilantro (recipe from this site). Will definately make again.

I won't rate this since I didn't actually make the whole dish....I just used the sauce for my own chicken and brocolli stir fry. It was pretty good but a little mild for my tastes. If you're looking for a more robust Asian flavor, try a different recipe or try doubling the garlic, ginger, soy sauce, fish sauce and oyster sauce. But if you're looking for something light, this would probably be perfect.

I have made this twice and loved it. Once I left out the corn and fish sauce, since I was out. The second time I made it just as written. Wonderful combination of tastes.

This is an easy and delicious meal. The ingredients are flexible (couldn't find lotus root, didn't have many mushrooms, etc) but you can substitute almost anything. Next time, I might double the garlic and shallot essence because it wasn't as much for the vegetables, but I may have let it boil down too long. Anyway, the sauce is delicious and would be yummy doubled. We served over rice, with extra soy sauce to serve. I highly recommend this recipe, and it is a good way to get more tofu in your diet!

Why aren't there more reviews of this dish? It's so good! And simple! I'd never cooked with lotus root before, but it's totally worth seeking out. Because asparagus is out of season right now, I just upped the green beans. Oh, and I did add a little more soy sauce. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly and served it on a bed of soba noodles. Drizzling each serving with sesame seed oil was a perfect touch. I'll definitely be making this again!

Tasty and light. Like the last reviewer I added a bit more soy. Also tossed the pot of veggies with linguine noodles and added corn starch to the sauce to thicken. Was enjoyed by all, even my picky 6 yr old.
