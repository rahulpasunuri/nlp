yum! a small detail that will make a lot of dishes special, i think. i put a small amount on top of risotto with ramps, and it was a lovely spring treat. i will surely keep this on hand all the time.

this is one that i love to give as a little foodie gift! love it with olives on baguette toasts as an hors d'oeuvre with a glass of sherry

This is one of those recipes I'll make forever. The suggestion of serving it with black olives & warmed bread is fantastic. The flavour only gets better over the month that you can keep it.

Bettybus -- be sure not to skip the repeated blanching. That's what removes the bitterness. We use the same technique when making candied citrus peel.

Bettybuss--I used my vegetable peeler to peel the lemons, but had to pull it in the opposite direction I usually pull in order not to remove pith with peel. The peel did not come out in pretty strips, but it tastes great

Mine came out extremely bitter, even though I was careful not to get any pith with the peel. Any suggestions anyone?
