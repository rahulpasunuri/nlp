Wow! Great and easy recipe. I used mild Italian sausage, will try a hotter sausage next time for a little more taste. Used whole grain spaghetti pasta. It all tasted delicious. Will definitely put this recipe in my "favorite recipe's" book.

Im addicted to this recipe. Started making it this winter and it is truly a regular dish for us now. We moved to a very italian neighborhood last Fall, so I have my choice of sausages to use, altho weve used store-bought as well. Each time its a little different but still excellent. Love the lemon/garlic mixture with the greens. This dish light and flavorful.

I have incorporated this pasta into my regular weeknight recipes. I cook it with farfalle most of the time and use any of the bagged lettuces that is available at my nearby grocery store (although I also think that the baby romaine kind works best). Great dish for an easy dinner.

I just stumbled across this recipe but have been making it for years, since the original magazine was published. For me, it it one of those perfect "go to" meals. It is satisfying, not too heavy and has a rich yet uncomplicated taste. Plus it looks gorgeous: like something I remember from Capri. Perfect for a light Summer's evening dinner poolside.

Yum! Easy and delicious, even for a beginning cook (like me!). I took the advice below regarding bow-tie pasta. For everything else I followed the recipe. Would make it again and for company.

Delicious. The only thing I added was sauteed onion. I made it with the Romaine as well and a little lemon zest in the dressing. Oh, and the only sausage I had was crumbled but it went well with the spaghetti. Yumm...

This recipe is not only easy but delicious. It has become a staple for us and is great to make during the busy week days. I add a little lemon zest to the oil and lemon mixture, it enhances the flavor.

I've been making this recipe since it appeared in the magazine but had never thought to check the reviews of it until now. Funny my comments are exactly opposite those of the most recent reviewer--this has become a staple meal for us--I do it almost once a week and we never tire of it. It's perfect when you want to make something delicious, simple, and fast. I roast the sausages at 500 degrees, 10 minutes on one side and 7 on the other; they are still slightly pink when I slice into them. I've discovered the pre-washed bags of hearts of romaine are the best green--the sweet crunch goes well with the pasta. And the heat of the pasta (I use spaghetti, as directed) does wilt the romaine, but I dress the romaine with the oil, garlic and lemon juice mixture about 10 minutes before tossing it all together just to make sure the greens are completely incorporated. We LOVE this thing!

This was the WORST recipe I have ever made from this site. All of the ingrediants sounded so yummy, I couldn't wait to try it. My daughter and I ended up throwing it out and eating grilled cheese sandwiches. What did I do wrong? I was a personal chef for years, so it's not lack of cooking experience - the lemon seemed off maybe? Anyone else have a bad experience with this one?

Mmmm.. this was very tasty! We often eat pasta on those nights when dinner's a rush. I added sliced black olives for additional color and flavor. Might even try adding a few sundried tomatoes next time.

This is such a good, easy, delicious recipe! I had some leftover cooked hot sausage and half a bag of baby arugula to use up, so I made this dish. Outstanding! It's so fast and easy to prepare and the flavor is wonderful. I will make this dish often.

I have to admit, I tried this recipe, because I just couldn't envision what it would end up like. What a great surprise! The dressing makes it (I used extra garlic), and a rotelli pasta instead of spaghetti. A great dish to make for a bunch of friends, guaranteed you'll get asked for this recipe! Easy and quick to make. We loved it.

This is good! I followed the advice of one of the reviewers below and used bowtie pasta. Easy, yummy, meaty, spicey (I used hot sausages), this dish scores high in all categories.

It pays to follow directions. The first time I made this it was terrible because I thought I could improve on the recipe by frying the sausage with garlic, wine, etc. The next time I just followed the recipe and it was terrific!! This is a fast and easy weeknight meal for one--I keep Italian sausages in the freezer and just pick up some greens if I want this--easy and satisfying.

I made this recipe with farfalle (bow-tie) pasta, I think it is a much better match to the sausage. I also added about 1 1/2 teaspoons of red pepper flakes, which is always a nice match with italian sausage. This is a SUPERFAST recipe, you should be ready to serve in 15 minutes, TOPS.

I substituted broccoli (steamed before) for the rabe and added some fresh parsley and more garlic. It was probably milder than with the rabe but it was still yummy! Good quick recipe. Definately worth making.

What a nice dressing. I think it would work really well with chicken too. Chances are I'll never try it since I'm always looking for good sausage recipes. My husband just loves it and this recipe didn't disappoint.

Interesting combination of flavors. I didn't run the numbers but should be healthy. I might try wilting the greens in the saute pan that the sausage was browned in next time. Making it a warm dressing in other words.
