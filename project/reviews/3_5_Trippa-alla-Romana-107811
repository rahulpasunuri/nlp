I've always found that it's better to boil the type one day, freeze it, and make the dish when you've forgotten what it smelled like.

Do I add the vanilla scented candle to the mixture before or after I get it to a rolling boil? Eeek....all the hair in my nose fell out.

To get rid of the smell add vanilla while boiling. Makes a big difference.

I have not tried this recipe but the ingredients are good, so, I will give it 3 forks. I have cooked tripe a number of times. It is important that you clean it properly. I wash it several times in cold water then let it soak in salt water, drain and repeat the process. I also simmer it in just plain water and then drain. It workes very well.

The tripe smelled rank while cooking, but encouraged by other reviews, carried on with the recipe. I think this may be a food that either you love or hate. The sauce was lovely (added cream and lemon as others had suggested) but the tripe tasted as awful as it smelled, it was left behind on the plates.

This was the first time I'd had tripe other than in menudo, and though I am a very adventurous eater, the barnyard smell of the boiling tripe almost made me give up on this dish before finishing preparing it. However, I had faith, and this turned out to be a very nice recipe. I added a couple of tablespoons of tomato paste, fresh marjoram, lemon, pepper flakes, and a cup of cream to the sauce, which really rounded out the flavors. I only used half of the tripe called for and froze the rest of the cooked pieces for future menudo. My only advice is to do the pre-cooking when the others you will be serving this dish to are not around. :-)

Fabulous dish and sooooooo satisfying! I added some chicken broth in place of the final water, no mint, some hot pepper flakes and some lemon juice to pop the flavor. Cook it way down and cover ith with grated parmesan and sit back to enjoy a treat! Yum!

This is great! I do the tripe in the pressure cooker first, and add capers, or corn- Lots of variations, and if you like tripe anyway, this will be a favorite for you, too!

I use this recipe whenever I make tripe-Best recipe yet-Excellent with lots of cheese, and fresh bread. I usually have to double or triple the recipe to keep it around longer than a day- Better even left over!!
