Made for "football night", had pizza, enchiladas, buffalo wings and tacos. The south american fried chicken was devoured first and they "whined" for more. A complete winner

I added fresh ground ginger and bourbon to my marinade and thought that put it over the top. Everyone who tried this along with my batch done without lime prefered this recipe over the more traditional stuff. I also tried some with water added to the pan and allowed to steam for 20 minutes. I'll be doing that again as well. While it was a little messy'er, it sure was tender and juicy. For those who might be scared off by the lime, I'll just say that in my case, the lime was very subtle and almost unnoticed until you tried this alongside the sutff without. It was then that I really noticed what it did for the flavor, and how much I liked it. Also, the lime marinade tends to make the chicken brown a good bit darker, so, be careful trying to judge doneness with color. If you have some of multiple recipes side by side, they'll really look different.

My husband and I are both big fans of lime and found the flavor excellent.

To weak in flavor for my taste.
