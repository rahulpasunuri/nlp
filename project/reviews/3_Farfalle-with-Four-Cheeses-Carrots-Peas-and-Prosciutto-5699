Bland and because of the mozzarella, the dish had clumps of cheese. Needed something to brighten the flavor.

This is a good recipe but not a WOW! like I thought it would be. I did not have a problem with the cheese clumping.

Pretty good.. but the cheese does tend to get clumpy. Also directions are not totally clear as to when/how much of which chees to add vs. save for later adding. Could improve with pactice making.

The dish tastes good and I'd make it again. We served blue cheese on the side and it really kicked it up a notch. The colors are pretty with the orange carrots and green peas. The dish was easy to make and the sauce was less thick than an Alfredo sauce and better. Overall, it is recommended to those of you who love these ingredients. Maybe just for the family since the proscuitto sticks together.

I thought this dish was bland (it tasted like a big bowl of whipping cream) and entirely too rich. The cheese didn't really melt and just made all the prosciutto pieces stick together. I took the leftovers and added garlic and fresh rosemary. Hopefully it will taste better tomorrow.

Surprisingly this dish tasted me much more on the second day. Looks that I liked it more than my husband. As I did not have Fontina and Romano cheese at home, then I added partly blue cheese and doubled just mozzarella. But more mozzarella was a mistake, it did not melt the best way and made sauce too sticky.

For a restaurant-quality dish, this was quite easy to prepare. I had no problems at all, but the carrots took longer than 5 minutes to be cooked through. My husband loved this dish!

I made this dish last night for some friends, and although it was beautiful to look at, I thought it was entirely too rich (and this is saying a lot, because I usually don't mind rich foods!) Also, the cheese did not melt completely smoothly into the cream mixture. Next time, I will try using half and half and probably a little less cheese.

Excellent pasta dish. I shared it with my cousin, and it is now one of her favorites. It's a keeper!

Used olive oil instead of butter, ham slice instead of prosciutto, low fat alfredo sauce instead of cream, still good and makes a nice presentation with the carrots.

I made this for guests - it was good and had a nice presentation. I chose this recipe thinking it would please not only my guests, but also their 5 year old daughter. She didn't come along that night, but her parents enjoyed it, and I think she would have, too.
