yum! Got a lovely pancetta wrapped pot roast from my local butcher. I forgot to grab onions at the market so i used several large shallots i had at home. used a pint of mushroom broth I had from soaking dried mushrooms for a previous recipe and about a cup of good red wine and a few splashes of worcestershire for the liquid. added in a couple bay leaves, one small cinnamon stick, whole coriander, whole fennel seed, whole black peppercorns, rubbed dry sage, herbs de provence, and a couple sprigs of fresh rosemary. put in some large pieces of carrot and celery to add more flavor while it cooked. when it was done i took out large pieces of spices, the celery and carrots and discarded as they we all spent. reduced the remaining liquid down and then ran the stick blender through it to make the shallots more cohesive in the sauce. GAH! Heavenly!

Easy and delicious. Used Bennett's Chili Sauce, white wine, rum, peppercorns, parsley and dill for the sauce and herbs. Made it in a dutch-oven on the stove top, simmered for about 4 hours. Added potatoes, fennel and mushrooms for last 45 mins; potatoes should've been in for at least 90 mins as they were still pretty hard, although not inedible.

I LOVE this recipe. It's both easy to modify, and make. I made it during a hurricane, fully expecting the power to go out. I thought dried fennel was a good addition to this dish.

I am trying to make the pot roast my mother always made and this looks great; just one question for any of you willing to comment-why does it have to stay on top of the stove instead of being moved into the oven after browning? TY!

Save time and energy with a pressure cooker. Done in about 50 minutes, fork tender. I prefer a lean rump roast.

Okay, the recipe calls for 1 cup of liquid. The variations tell you to use a 10-ounce can of tomatoes for PART of the liquid. Has anyone done the math? One cup also seems ridiculously scant for 5 pounds of meat.

This was the best roast I have made to date. Added mushrooms the last 40 minutes- good earthy taste- it was wonderful on a cold winter night.

Use this as a Slow Cooker recipe. Add a extra liquid and there is no need to pre-brown the meat. it is one of my family's favorite. Toss a few white potatoes in about 3 hours before serving and you have a whole meal.

Definitely a keeper - I love to cook, but have always failed with pot roast - finally a success! Cooked it in the crockpot on the back porch on a summer day, 8 hours on high - moist and tender!

Wow, this was really good for something so simple. The flavor was superb. The meat was a little tough and chewy, but that may be the cut I had (conventional boneless beef chuck pot roast) and not the recipe's fault. I used a good red wine for the liquid, garlic instead of onions, eliminated the carrot, put shiitake mushrooms in for the last 20 minutes, and put chopped fresh parsley in the last ten minutes.

Excellent recipe and so versatile! I use 1/2 cup red wine and 1/2 cup beef broth for my liquid, and add thyme, minced garlic and a tablespoon or two of concentrated tomato paste. I also add those small red creamer potatoes (slicing the larger ones in half) about 1/2 hour before the end of the cooking time. It always comes out wonderful and makes its own gravy, for the most part.

This was really exceptional, considering how easy it was. And the variations crack me up. It sounds like no matter WHAT you put in it the flavors are delicious. That was certainly our experience. We enjoyed it over couscous. We tried the suggested tacos for leftovers, but prefer flour tacos to the corn type they suggested. My preference was to warm the leftovers, and make a sandwich on french bread with a creamy condiment, like mayo.

Outstanding~! I tried this for Christmas dinner, because that is what my dad wanted. I have never made a pot roast before, and let me tell you, the most difficult part was shopping at the farmer's market for the ingredients! After the searing portion of the recipe, I reduced the heat to as low as my cook top goes, and let it do it's thing for four hours. Perhaps because I had the heat on low, I did not have any trouble with not having enough liquid, I used the called for one cup of beef stock. I used a three pound rump roast, peeled small onions, baby carrots and whole small red potatoes (I added potatoes at the same time as the carrots, and they were cooked perfectly, I wouldn't wait until the final 20 or 30 minutes), and a sprinkling of herbes de provence. I wound up with two cups of liquid with which I made gravy.

Pressure cooked 8 lb Chuck Roast for 50 mins after browning instead of cooking for hours. Used Coriander seeds, Rosemary, Celery, red onion, 2cups white wine, 1/4 cup brandy, little Tabasco. EXCELLENT. Thickened drippings with flour, added sour cream+cream (~ 1/2 cup), some xtra water + wine so cream doesn't curdle (wine in ANY cream sauce can then be boiled without risk of curdling. Try this with fish cooked in a cream sauce also!) Lots of gravy. Meat fell apart. Excellent!

made this recipe for a family get together last night. It was my first time making pot roast, but this recipe did not disappoint. I let the roast simmer for closer to 4 and 1/4 hours and used a mix of red wine and beef stock as my liquid (i found that there wasn't really enough gravy at the end with just one cup, so I used 2.5c - which boiled down dramatically). I used fennel, oregano and thyme as my spices and carrots, potatoes and parsnips as my veggies - - can't wait for the leftovers for dinner tonight!

My husband and I loved this, although our kids (2 and 5 years old) didn't eat it. We used chuck roast, and for our liquid we used crushed tomatoes, red wine, demi glacee and a bit of boxed vegetable stock. It was delicious. I forgot to add herbs but that didn't turn out to be a problem. I used more liquid than called for so that the meat would be covered and cooked the dish all day in a slow cooker. I have a lot of leftover sauce which I will use for pasta sauce. Highly recommended.

This recipe is foolproof. I used a top round roast, pearl onions, baby carrots and beef broth for the liquid. Added oregano and Montreal Steak Seasoning. Cooked in dutch oven for 5 hours. Meat was SO tender and I thickened the gravy with a bit of corn starch & water. Served with Yorkshire pudding, also from this site. Gave us both fond memories of a wonderful trip to the UK in June.

This is a great starting point for a first time pot roast maker. I used low sodium chicken broth, triple sec, and balsamic for the liquid with some cinnamon, garlic, & touch of cayanne. Used sweet potatoes, celery, and baby portabellos in addition to the onions and carrots.... YUM! Huge hit with my husband and my three year old... next time we need to buy a bigger roast because we finished a 2.5 pounder between the 3 of us!

So versitle and sooooo good. My husband said it was even better than his mom's! I soaked some sun- dried tomatoes in red wine I used as the liquid, and added root veggies and mushrooms the last half hour. I used celery root, which gave it a mild celery taste, but not that stringy celery texture I loath. Oh yeah, I used a 7- bone chuck roast, hather than a cut from the round as suggested.

My second review for this...had to come back and comment again because it's just so excellent. It makes the best tacos ever...even my skinny SIL ate about 8 of them when I served this. Shredded, then combined in warmed corn tortillas with avocado, snipped cilantro, green salsa and a squeeze of lime juice, it's a total crowd- pleaser. I will definitely make again and again.

I was making a pot roast for a group of 20 something so I decided to practice some recipes in advance. I tried a couple and they were terrible! The day of the event I tried this recipe and the pot roast was amazing! I recieved rave reviews! I would just suggest adding more liquid, enough to cover the meat.

I pretty much made this as shown, except I didn't have carrots on hand. The herbs I chose were rosemary and coriander, and I used a combo of chicken broth and white wine for the liquid. For the pounding part (!), I used the flat side of a meat tenderizer instead of a plate. I turned it periodically as it cooked. It came out soooo good that my boyfriend said it reminded him of the barbacoa (meat cooked in a pit for up to 10 hours) he used to eat in Mexico. We shredded the meat and made tacos with corn tortillas, avocado and thin green salsa. I will definitely use this recipe again and again. Four forks from me!

This was delicious. I varied it a little: put all the veggies in at once (celery, carrots & potatoes) after the onion part. I also added fresh garlic and basil. My boneless chuck was only 2 1/2 pounds, but I found that I needed a lot more liquid than what the recipe called for. For liquid, I used a combination of chicken broth, red wine and water. Even with modifications, this is a great recipe to go off of, and I'm sure would stand alone as is.

I addded a tablespoon of balsemic vinegar, and 3 peeled but whole parsnips the last 40 minutes.Onetime it came out tasty but the meat was not tender, even after 3 hours in a dutch oven. So I tried a crock pot and had a better result after an 8 hour cooking time, but sometimes I wonder if some meats are just tough? How can one tell when shopping which meats will not be tender?

I happened to have a 4lb chuck roast instead of a rump roast. It turned out great. I used peeled white onions and some carrots. I put it in a 300 oven for about 4 hours instead of simmering it on the stove. Wow, did the house smell good. I served it with buttered noodles. Yummy.

I've made this pot roast several times using 1c beef broth, spash of and 3/4c red wine as the liquid and adding mushrooms and carrots to the veggies - throw in a little roast or steak seasoning blend and some garlic and put it in the crock pot for 8 hours on low - fabulous! My husband insists on mashed potatoes with this since the juices make a great gravy. Excellent and the meat is so tender it falls apart.

This dish is well-named -- it really is basic pot roast, and the same recipe you would probably find in any basic cookbook. But there's a reason for that: it's delicious. And it makes excellent gravy. The recipe gives you the leeway to add the seasonings of your choice, but it is interesting that very few of the rave reviews actually followed the recipe even a little.

Delicious and fool proof! I had never made pot roast before, but got a craving for it and used this recipe. I used a 3lb rump roast (but would probably purchase a more tender cut next time) and cooked the roast for 3 1/2 hours on the stove. I added just a bit of dried rosemary to the flour mixture, and omitted the salt, before browning the roast. For the liquid, I used 1/2 bullion cube in 1/2 cup of water, 1/2 cup of no-salt-added tomato sauce, and 1/2 cup of shiraz. I removed carrots and onions to warm in the oven (200 degrees just to keep them warm for serving) about 1 hour or so before the roast was done, and cooked 1/2 lb. of fresh green beans during the last 30 minutes of cooking--then, I removed them from the roasting pot and set aside with the carrots and onions. After the meat was removed from the pot and set aside for carving, I added 1 cup of sour cream to the remaining liquid and served that with the beef. I also served plain rice pilaf, rather than potatoes, with the meal. This dish was EXCELLENT and I will definitely make it again. Enjoy!

I've been experimenting with pot roast recipes for the longest time and this one was so simple and good it was almost scary. I used red wine for all the liquid, 1T. of herbes du Provence, a couple cloves of garlic, and grilled the onions hard before throwing everything into the Crockpot (except the carrots, which I detest) What's this instruction about banging meat with the side of a plate? Who does that? HOW do you do that? Plates don't have sides. I just salt and peppered the meat and dredged in flour before throwing in a hot pan. No banging.

Magnificent pot roast! Mine has never been this good & the only one I loved was my mother-in-law's. She used a pressure cooker, Lipton's onion soup mix(we're talking '60's), beef broth & probably some wine & was wonderful. Couldn't decide which ingredients so followed Snep's lead and went with beef broth, red wine & just a few bay leaves. It literally fell apart as it was cut & the gravy was delicious & plentiful. Had removed all fat so didn't have to skim. When I blended the gravy for leftovers, I didn't care for the sweet flavor the carrots gave it, so would not include those if I blend it again. One of the best reasons for eating pot roast is horseradish on the side. Served with buttermilk mashed yukon golds and a big salad. Can't wait to try some of the other ingredient options. The leftovers are an added bonus. Used some with beans & some in tacos. This recipe served three of us for a week!

My dad always made and excellent pot roast when I was growing up and I have never been able to get it right. This recipe was wonderful. I ommitted the carrots, since my husband doesn't like them, and used 1/2 cup red wine and 1 cup beef broth for the liquid. It turned out great.

Fantastic and incredibly easy. I have made roasts in the slow cooker a few times but was never completely happy with the results, not tender enough no matter how long I kept it in there. This time a I used a dutch oven and was very well rewarded by the results. Extremely tender. Followed basic recipe and used 1/4 cup port and a 1 cup beef broth as the liquid. Cooked with onion, carrots, rosemary and some brown sugar. Added some cut golden pototoes the last 45 minutes. I pureed some of the sauce and veggies for a thicker sauce at the end. Simple perfection!

Fantastic. This was my first pot roast, and it turned out marvelously, especially due to the reviews posted here. For my liquid, I used red wine, beef broth, and a few shakes of Worcestershire. Put it in the crock pot for 8 hours with some onions, carrots, garlic, and rosemary. I must admit though, what brought it to a four fork experience was the sauce I made to go on it...strained solids from cooking liquid, added liquid to some mushrooms sauteed in red wine and butter(reduced that). So maybe the recipe on its own is three and a half forks. The in-laws loved it, and my hubby, who's never had pot roast, raved as well. All around good and tasty experience.

This was so yummy!!! After browning the beef I followed one of the recomendations and added 1/4 cups of port, 1 cup of beef broth, a few sprigs of rosemary, 3 cloves of garlic and let it sit in the slow cooker for 4-5 hours. And I added small golden potatoes, onions, and carrots at the last 45 mins. It was so beautifuly tender. I like it with a lot of juice but if you don't reduce mthe broth to 3/4 cup to get a more rich flavor. I like my gravy thicker than my boyfriend does so I took some of the juice, carrots, onions, garlic from the slow cooker and blended it. It was so yummy and I will make this again. Enjoy!!!

I really enjoyed this recipe in many ways however, using the recommended amount of liquid, it almost burned/all of the liquid evaporated. I "saved" it by taking the roast off of the stove and putting it in the crock pot for two add'l hours with some wine and stock. Used dried rosemary, fresh thyme along with 2 tbs of rum, and white wine variation and the flavor was perfect.

I pretty much followed the same as genescott (reviewer) and also did the crock pot method. It turned out great. The only other doctoring up I did was to as 1/3 cup red wine and a heaping tablespoon of brown sugar. I removed the meat after it was cooked and placed the liquid in the blender, and then returned it to the pot and added the meat again. I served it with buttered egg noodles and a dash of freshly grated parmesan. My guests went nuts. This is even better the next day. Note: rememebr to NEVER reheat any foods in crock pot. Use the stove-top method. Happy Eats!

I love the simplicity of this recipe! However, I think I botched what could have been excellent by trying to make a richer variation, which was good, but I think I overdid the rosemary & port. My variation: Liquid: 1 can (14oz) beef broth (about 1 3/4c in a can), and about 1/4c port. Veggies: carrot (as written), 3 sprigs rosemary, about 1/4c chopped parsley. In the end I added a bag of small baby red potatoes, removed them when done, strained the gravy, added about 1c sour cream, and had to thicken further with cornstarch. I thought it was great, but it probably would have been superb if I had just let it be basic! I'm not the most experienced with creating good experiments! :)

Made this very basic with one cup of beef broth, a big sweet onion, the flour and garlic salt and pepper. No vegatables. Cooked in a crock pot on low for 3 hours and then on Keep Warm for another 8 hours. After it was finished I threw the onions and the beef stock in a blender for a sauce. More than half my guests asked for the recipe, and almost everybody had seconds.

My husband claims this to be the best pot roast he's ever eaten, bar none. I did a smaller roast for the two of us, so reduced the amount of onion and carrot, but not the liquid. Used beef broth and vermouth, added chunks of garlic and shallot, and a few fennel and cumin seeds for seasoning. Stirred in a bit of sour cream to the gravy. This was so amazingly good and easy to do, and the house smelled fab! Will make again often, it's a new favorite.

I have never succeeded with a pot roast. I think I always added too many vegetables, seemingly giving the meat second billing, and no matter what, there was always something missing. However, this recipe made me a STAR. I skipped all the vegetables. I followed the rest of the instructions as stated. Did the flour with salt, pepper and Lawry's perfect blend Seasoning and Rub. 1 cup beef bouillion. That's it, and both my husband and I loved the tender, meaty taste. There is "rump roast" on my next shopping list. Thank You.

I made this recipe a while back and it came out superb. This time around and used the same cinnamon rub with 1 cup of merlot, 2 tbsp. worchestershire sauce and bayleaves and placed in the oven on 275 for 4 hours.

I'm giving this 4 forks, because it does say BASIC Pot Roast recipe. Which is exactly what it is. A couple of great things about this recipe is you can add so much more to it, if you so choose. For me, I added mushrooms, beef bullion, rum, wochester sauce and Italian Seasonings. Cooked with potatoes for a true 1 pot meal. Also, this recipe makes a LOT. Therefore, I will be using the shredded beef to make enchiladas- take shredded beef, add some salsa or hot sauce, put in flour tortillas, add shredded cheese, bake at 350 for about 20 minutes until hot. Let cool a bit then top with sour cream if desired. These are wonderful!!!

This was spectacular. I'd never made pot roast before (and the idea didn't sound particularly pleasing to me) but my sweetheart begged for some of what he called "home cooking". In my family, "home cooking" was synonomous with "bland and mushy". This was neither of those things. I used the recipe for "Braised Lamb Shanks With White Beans", follwing the recipe with a few changes: 1.) I used a big 'ole slab of beef 2.) kept the vegetables cut large (turnips, parsnips, carrots, onions) and added only the onions and carrots at the begining. The rest were added during the last hour or so of cooking. 3.)Didn't strain or whisk in butter or use the beans or the gremolata (though that probably wouldn't be a bad idea :) It came out VERY rich, very nutritious, and incredibly tasty. Oh--for the wine I used a Pinot Noir. This helped keep it rich but not tasting like a barrel of wine.

I was wary about making a pot roast on the stove top, too easy! My 1 cup of liquid was soy sauce, grainy mustard and chicken broth with miso. Strange combination but really good. The vegetables were chopped fennel and halved mushrooms. At the 2 hour mark the beef was pretty hard ...I was worried... at 4 hours it was falling apart beautifully! Glad I didn't add more liquid.

Will make this again. Very easy to prepare.I did use the meat rub - 1 tsp. thyme, 1 tsp. paprika, 1/2 tsp. cinanmon, 1/2 tsp ground cloves and pepper. Then I dredged the roast in flour and browned the roast. Carmilized the onions and carrots with galic. Added 2 bay leaves,1 cup of merlot and 2 Tbls. of worchershire sauce, though it needed more liquid so I added a cup of beef broth which I didn't need to add. Ended up with too much liquid. Cooked the roast covered in the oven at 275 for 4 hours. The meat was fork tender and very tasty!

I used the basic recipe, using a five pound rump roast. I added 3/4 cup Kendall Jackson chardonnay and 1/4 cup Barcadi rum for the liquid along with a Tbs. hot sauce and some peppercorns. I cooked it on top of the stove for five hours. This was a wonderful pot roast, better the next day. I thickened the gravy by blending in a Yukon gold potato I had cooked with the roast.

I said that YES I would make this again, But... good grief. Add anything you want??? Basically, you can make a roast by browning it in some oil, adding water/wine/beef broth/ what ever you have or like and some herbs. I used fresh herbs and a mixture of beef broth and balsamic vinegar.

I love stringy beef pot roasts (boneless chuck) and I tried this method with it. I absolutely love it. I have "tweaked" the herbs and liquids a bit to my tastes...I add 1 TBSP of Herbs de Provence (found in specialty herbs stores), garlic powder, pepper to the flour dredge - NO SALT. I add 2 TBSP soy sauce instead. Gives it a richer flavor than salt. May need to add more soy later on in cooking time - taste to see. Gives it a spectacular flavor. Also, my liquid mixture is beef broth, 1/3 Cup red wine, 1/3 Cup black coffee -- yes, coffee! Okay to use from a.m. coffee pot, and a few dashes worcestershire. This makes the most spectacular gravy by merely thickening it a bit with cornstarch slurry. This is a really big hit with all!

I slivered a boneless 5 lb. blade roast w. garlic. and then rubbed it w. flour and seasoning salt. After browning, I threw it in the crock pot, 1 can beef broth and 1/2 to 1 cup of red wine, 1/2 to 1t of chinese 5 spice. Add water until just covored and cook on low overnight. In the morning, add lb of carrots and 2 onions that have been quartered. The best pot roast i've ever had. EVER!!! Do not even attempt w/o the 5 spice. I tried it. Its just not the same. With the leftover liquid, boil it down to a semi-thick glaze scraping off and scum that may surface and use it as a gravy for the roast and the mashed root vegetables with horseradish. It's fabulous.

After all the rave reviews, I figured I'd try it, with the cinnamon rub, and cabernet with Worcesteshire sauce for the liquid. I made it in the oven on 275 for around 5 hours. It came out dry, and I HATED the flavor of the rub! It was a strange, sickening sweet, I guess from the cloves...It was disgusting. If I tried it again, I would NOT use the spice rub! I would also cook it a little less. I am very disappointed since the reviews were so rave.

I too used the cinnamon/paprika combination as a base for the rub and then added dried crushed lemongrass, Chinese 5 spice powder and dried ground cloves.

I did the basic recipe and added Montreal seasoning to the flour for a little kick. Added 1 1/2 c red wine & 2 c beef stock with a little Chinese 5 Spice in it -- it was delicious! My husband devoured it. Cooked it with celery, onion, carrots & added potatoes with 1 1/2 hours to go. So easy to prepare, especially with little children who needed tending.

I have made many successful pot roasts, but this recipe made with the previously suggested spices outshines them all. I studded a rump roast with garlic slivers & browned it well then removed. Sauteed chopped onion & carrot to near carmelization, returned meat to pot and added 1 cup cabernet + 2 tbl worchestershire + 1/2 tsp cinnamon + 1 tsp thyme + 1 tsp paprika + 2 bay leaves + 1-2 tsp ground pepper, salt (or a boullion cube?). The covered pot stayed in a low oven for about 4 hours adding small potatoes, shallots, & carrots after about 3 hours. I reduced the sauce & strained it and... YUM!!!!! It truly was great. Thanks for the tips!

This was absolutely the BEST pot roast I've ever made. Used the cinnamon rub recommended by the Bumpkin Gourmet on previous page.Used 1 cup of white wine and added baby carrots and potatoes. Baked at 275 for about 4 hours.The gravy was great.Even my 90 year old grandmother said it was the best pot roast she'd ever had.A definite keeper!

Ok...I grew up on pot roast...overcooked, with carrots & onions. I've never wanted to try cooking one until I was laid off & am now on a budget - no more filet or lobster for a while. They had pot roast on sale for .89/lb today...bought a 6lb one. Took that bugger...cut it up to fit in my dutch oven and yanked off any fat I could...sauteed a large onion, celery, shredded carrots and 6 cloves of minced garlic in olive oil...rubbed the pot roast pieces with a mixture of the flour, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp paprika, 1 tsp thyme, a dash or 2 of cumin and ground cloves. Browned the pieces of pot roast then tossed them into the dutch oven with the sauteed veggies, a cup of beef broth, a cup of Merlot, 5 bay leaves, 2 tsp of Worcestershire, put 2lbs of quartered red potatoes on top along with some baby carrots and simmered it for 2hrs. I didn't have time to reduce the gravy tonight, but even if rather thin, it was incredible. I'll definitely be making this again. It's NOT the pot roast I grew up with. :)

Yum! I used the vermouth option in the recipe, and also made the cinnamon rub listed on the next page of the comments. Dinner guests were asking for leftovers to take home! I added the following vegetables to the pot: baby carrots, small white onions, turnips, and bulb fennel.

Be careful, novice chefs! I tried cooking this pot roast stove-top in a dutch oven, and it came out way, way overdone. With my gas stove, it was difficult to predict a cooking rate. Next time, I will put it in the oven @ 275 per previous reviews

Really tasty and unusual with the addition of cloves and cinnamon--my husband LOVED it!! Here is what I did added 1 1/2 cups cabernet to the sauteed onions and 2 cloves garlic; added 1 chopped carrot, dash of ground cloves, 3/4 teas. thyme, 1/2 teas. cinnamon, 1 teas. paprika, 3 bay leaves, 2 T Worcestershire sauce and 1 14-oz can pureed tomatoes. Covered in a 275 degree oven for 3 1/2 hours. Removed fat then reheated in a 350 oven the next day for about an hour. I like a smooth sauce so I blended it with an immersion blender. Bon Appetit!

I love to cook, and everyone needs to know how to make pot roast. This is a great starting point, and the best thing about pot roast is you can add anything you have in the house, and it still tastes great! The secret to tender roast is to cook it long and low. I suggest taking any of these flavoring suggestions and putting the roast in a crock pot or the oven at 250 for about 8 hrs! So easy, and so good! Thank you Epicurious for providing us with basic recipies in addition to wonderful gourmet ideas!

Well, I am in the process of making this. I had to try the rub consisting of cinnamon, paprika, ground cloves, thyme, salt, & pepper (Because so many people have RAVED about it....can anyone tell me HOW MUCH of each spice they used....I had no idea what the quantities should be). I put petite red potatoes in the bottom of my crock pot, then onions, then carrots. Put slightly less then a quarter cup of tapioca (someone recommended that to me for added thickness). Laid the rubbed beef on the veggies and poured one cup of wine, 1/4 cup of water a dash or 2 of worshester and a dash of hot sauce. I just turned the crock pot on low (the first time I've ever used one!) and we'll see what it ends up like when I get home tonight. I was a little wary about using an entire cup of wine and no other liquid...not sure how that would come out but we shall see in about 10 hours, right!? I'll let you know. My fiance thought the rub smelled "interesting", he wasn't sure why would would put cloves and cinnamon on beef..... Well, it turned out pretty good. I wasn't wild about the flavor and will probably opt for a spicier version (something cajun) next time but the beef was very moist and tender...just fell apart. We are eating beef sandwhiches today for lunch.

SUPER! Excellent! This is one of most versitile recipes I have ever used. I have made it many times and each time it is a hit no matter what I put in the pot. This time: 1 C white wine, 1 14 oz can diced tomatoes, bay leaves, paprika, 2 buillion cubes, parsley, potatoes, celery more carrots. The result was almost soup like (lots of broth)!!

Deliscious! My brother came over for dinner tonight and I made this. He couldn't eat enough of it. I use pureed tomato for the sauce. It's sooo good.

Outstanding. I used the red wine and the spice rub and added a couple of sprigs of fresh thyme and sage as well as some cut celery. I cooked a 2lb chuck roast for just over 4 hours at 275' and then refrigerated overnite, skimmed the fat off (there was a LOT!) and removed the thyme, sage, bay leaf and overcooked celery and onion. I added more carrots and reheated at 275' for over an hour. Wow.

loved the recipe, it was excellent. i used the leanest meat i could find and it turned out tender and moist.

This pot roast was simply outstanding! I used the spice rub as suggested by another cook and for the liquid 1 cup of red wine and about 1 cup of French onion soup I had made the day before. Also added 2 bay leaves and a sprig of fresh rosemary. Cooked for 4 hours, then removed the roast, added sliced fresh mushrooms to the pot and reduced the sauce to thicken and concentrate the flavours. It was delicious served with Mashed Root Vegetables with Horseradish also from this site. A very hearty and heart warming dinner perfect for a wet and stormy winter day. This is most definitely a keeper!!!

I had never made a pot roast before and had no idea what to do. I read all of the reviews and used 1/4 cup soy sauce and 1/4 cup water for the liquid. I also used the cinnamon/paprika/thyme/pepper/salt combo. I will definitely make this a regular item on my menu!!

Excellent. I too used the cinnamon etc. rub. The aroma while it was cooking was divine. I used red wine and worchestershire and one cup was sufficient. There was plenty of liquid for gravy and the meat was S-O tender.

When I served this dish, I received compliments from everyone who ate it. This was the best pot roast I've ever made in all my 55 years of actual cooking.

I, too, followed the other members advice and used the cinnamon, glove, garlic, nutmeg, and thyme rub, and simmered the roast in cabernet and worchestire. For my first roast, it was quite a crowd pleaser. The left-overs made for great sandwiches the next day.

This basic pot roast recipe has been my standard pot roast for years, but I can't believe how delicious my pot roast was tonight! The best I've ever made, and I used to think I made a pretty good pot roast! I used the paprika/cinnamon rub as previously mentioned and then added a Cabernet Sauvignon and Worcestshire after browning onions. Too good to be true. Smashed garlic, oregano and bay leaf and then I added carrots in the last hour and served with mashed potatoes. My whole family loved it, and my husband gave it rave reviews. There was a slight tangy-ness to the gravy, which I thickened with a flour paste. This will be my standard pot roast from now on. Thanks for the great suggestion!

Absolutely delicious. I used one cup of beer, about 3tbsp of brown sugar, a dash of cinnamon, a little thyme, 2 bay leaves, salt and pepper, dash of paprika. Everything in a oven proof dutch oven. Cook in the oven at 260 for about 4 hours with no peeking. Then I removed the meat and reduce the sauce on medium high heat to thicken. The best pot roast I ever made.

I was just looking for a basic pot roast recipe, but that's not what I ended up putting on the table! There was nothing basic about this meal! It was a delicious, mouth watering, flavorful pot roast and I owe it all to the comments of another reader....she raved about how her husband is a pot roast officinado, how he had eaten more pot roast in his life than he cared to admit, so I went with her recipe. I was on a mission to impress that night. She used spices like paprika, cinnamin, and garlic salt. For the liquid she used merlot and worschtershire. It all sounded bizarre, but I couldn't resist trying with a review like that, so I did it. It was an absolute hit! My husband was amazed and everyone walked away from the table stuffed and wanting the recipe. Thank you for allowing people to share their comments...I would have made a BASIC pot roast otherwise!!

I took the advice of another review and added the beer, onion soup mix and cream of mushroom soup. The gravy was wonderful! The meat was awesome but our roast was done much faster that 3 hours

Rating: 3
Okay, pot roast isn't typically very exciting, but I must say... this one rocked! My guests could not stop raving about it. I rubbed mine down with the Cinnamon/paprika/thyme/pepper rub(as per previous reviewers recommendations) and inserted slivers of garlic into the meat. Browned the roast and finished it off on "low" in the crock pot with sliced onions and a little splash or two each of Worcestshire & Sherry, YUM! Served with Epicurious' Garlic Mashed Potatoes. I made this last week and my mouth is still watering!!!

There is a reason why this recipe has been held onto since the sixties! I am a thirty-something foodie who has been a subscriber to Gourmet for the past 20 years and this recipe is in my own personal top ten list. Why?? -- Well, (1) it is delicious exactly as written (2) the variations are just as great, and it keeps the recipe from getting that 'overplayed' feeling (3) inexpensive (4) EASY to make (5) so comforting, it makes you look like an absolute goddess of hearth and home (other people's husbands may even look at you wistfully...it's happened to me...) (6) even better the next day. -- Tjis recipe is so good that it even has my family happily anticipating chilly New England autumn weather because they know that pot roast season has arrived.

This was a big it at my house! I added thyme, a bay leaf and garlic to red wine and put in the ol' crockpot. I can't wait to try some of the other variations it shows. A keeper!

This has to be one of the best recipes I have come across. The flexability is built right into it. I pureed fresh tomatoes and used Sherry for part of the liquid. I threw in various spices put it all in my big blue Le Creuset and let her rip! Fantastic!

I thought I knew how to make a good pot roast. I was wrong! This is my new pot roast..even the teenager told me how good it was.I used some brandy and what a conductor of flavor. Try using a product by Kitchen Basics. They make beef and chicken broth. Really almost as good as homemade and puts Swansons and College Inn to shame. More expensive, but worth it! It comes in aseptic containers..perfect for the pantry!

I thought this recipe was very strange when I first read it but figured if so many people liked it, I would give it a try. I ended up very pleasantly surprised! I used the wine and rum and added 4 cloves of crushed garlic and about 1/2 cup of apple juice. I also added the peppercorns and corriander seeds and some celery. When I tasted it while it was cooking I didn't think I was going to like the end result but it ended up tasting delicious and my husband and his friend raved about it. I cooked this considerably longer than the recipe suggested (hours in a crock pot and then simmered on the stove for a few hours) and the sauce seemed to get more delicious and smooth tasting as it cooked. I will make this again!

What a wonderful recipe! My fiancee says it is the best pot roast she has ever had. I used a cast iron dutch oven and cooked a 4 lb. beef rump roast 3.5 hours. For the liquid I combined 3/4 cup white wine, 2 tablespoons brandy, 2 tablespoons chili paste, 2 tablespoons folgers instant coffee, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, 1 bay leaf, 2 cloves crushed garlic, 1 can vegetable broth and added to this freshly crushed: 3 pieces allspice, 1 teaspoon black peppercorns, 1/2 teaspoon thyme, and 1 teaspoon celery salt. After cooking roast completely, skim 95% of the fat off of the top of the broth/au jus and discard. Enjoy.

I liked this recipe. The only thing I changed was that I put it in a crock pot for 8 hours on low. I also added some rosemary.

This was wonderful. I really was surprised. We did the white wine and rum. Also added salt and pepper,peppercorns,some thyme,garlic. Added celery,green beans. The amount of liquid (1 cup) was right on. That surprised my husband. Sliced roast and poured veggies and gravy over. Served with mashed potatoes. I think next time I will cook potatoes along with everything else and serve an eggplant casserole or greens on side. We did option 2 with chili sauce.

Rating: 3
I prefer option 2. The chile sauce and peppercorns add just the right amount of spiciness and the wine and rum create a delicious sauce.

Everybody loves it. I season with a bay leaf, garlic salt, allspice, ground thyme, cajun seasoning, salt & pepper. I use 1/2 cup Jack Daniels, one can veg. broth, 1 tbsp. each of worcestirshire and soy, and two cans water for cooking liquid. Add an apple to the liquid and mash it into the liquid once soft. Delicious

I'm not a pot roast kinda gal. However, this one rocks. Tender & lovely. I cooked it in red wine and used the rub of cinnamon, ground cloves, paprika, salt & pepper. Use a lot of the spices, dont be afraid it will be too overwhelming. Also, 5-6 cloves of whole smashed garlic.

My family loved it. I used the tomato based liquid and added minced garlic to the sauce. Suggestion: simmer in a slow cooker instead of the stove.

This was my first pot roast and it was great. This is nothing like I normally cook but I was looking for comfort food. I added potatoes and turnip. Next time I think I will make it with herbs de provence and have mashed potatoes on the side like my mom does!

What a wonderful recipe! Everyone, even the cats, went crazy over it. I followed the suggestions made by The Bumpkin Gourmet: meat rub consisting of cinnamon, paprika, thyme(very little), pepper, ground cloves and salt. Dredged with flour and browned well. In the pot I added some Cabernet Sauvignon and Worchestershire, also four cloves garlic, oregano, and bay leaf. Added the carrots during the last hour of cooking. Served that great gravy over mashed potatoes. Just the best!!!

A wonderful receipe. I used baby potatoes in addition to the carrots and onions. Also, I added garlic and some herbs (basil, thyme, oregano) and used tomato sauce and cabernet for the sauce. Cooked it for longer than the recipe called--turned out very tender and tasted even better the next day. Great comfort food.

Husband LOVED this dish. It came out very tender, but next time I think that I'll add more herbs,maybe some garlic. I used red wine and beef stock for liquid. And some thyme, oregano, rosemary and worsteshire. It just needed a little more flavor.

This recipe has got to be the greatest! After the browning of the meat I used a packaged onion gravey mix w/a cup of red wine,added onions & carrots, a bay leaf,salt& pepper & cooked for 5 hours..then added about 5 crushed ginger snap cookies just to thicken. This recipe was to die for.Slice and serve with mashed potatoes & extra gravey YUM!

The simplicity of this recipe is what makes it so good. You can also add whatever spices you like. Here's what I did: I made a meat rub consisting of cinnamon, paprika, thyme(very little), pepper, ground cloves and salt. Dredged with flour and browned well. In the pot I added some Cabernet Sauvignon and Worchester. It was excellent. I knew this because I caught my wife cutting off a slab when I wasn't looking.

Easy and delicious. It is nice to have everything on hand. So simple and easy and it doesn't heat up the kitchen. Thanks.

Really very good. I added extra carrots, and used half merlot and half tomato sauce as liquid. I seasoned the flour with lots of pepper, salt and probably 1-2 teaspoons of thyme. Add potatoes just in the last 30 minutes (depending on size) and added two bay leaves. It was tremendous... sweet and savory and just tender as all get out. Would have served with noodles but I had run out.

I've spent 25 years looking for a good pot roast recipe and this is it! My whole family raved and I appreciated that after years of not so good, dried out roasts. This is one I'll pass on to children and grand-children.

For the liquid I used 1/2 c Japanese sake, 1/4 cup dark soy sauce, 1/4 cup water. For the herbs I used 12 black peppercorns, 2 bay leaves, and 4-6 dried anise seeds (the Vietnamese kind that you can find in most Chinese supermarkets). It gives this pot roast a wonderful Asian flavour and is just as delicious!

Rating: 4
This recipe was easy and very good. In addition to the carrots and onions I added green beans and turnips. I also used vegetable broth as the liquid and added worchestire (sp?) sauce. I had 6 pounds of meat and it took 5 hours to cook. I would definitely cook it again.

This is a great basic recipe that can be adapted in many different ways. Once I tried it with Italian style stewed tomatoes, carrots and potatoes and it was great. The last time I made it, I used red wine and a mix of Provencal herbs and it was just as delicious.

I used 1 cup black coffee, 1/4 cup dark soy sauce mixed w/ 2 T. water for the liquid and oregano and bay leaf for the seasoning. Then I let it all sit while I went about my business. Terrific, easy to follow base recipe that can be easily improvised upon by the cook.

I was looking for just a simple pot roast super great

It is sooooooooo gooooooooooood and so easy, it's brilliant! Oh yeah, when I browned the meat in bacon fat it came out nice, but it was nice when I used sesame oil instead. I just used parsley and marjoram as seasonings, and chopped tomatoes and beef stock for the liquid. I used potatoes and green pepper for the veg, it was lovely, but it was also nice when I used peas instead of green pepper. Highly recommended eat! Oh, it tasted better when I used less liquid (one cup is fine, just like they say) and when I cooked it on the loooooowest possible heat, not even one or two, but LOOOOOOO!

Tender delicious meat and vegetables. I used Green Peppercorns and Cognac as a flavoring, and stirred in cream for a thickening agent to make an outstanding sauce. Kohlrabi, red potatoes, carrot chunks, small onions, and button mushrooms as the vegetables were added during the last 45 to 5 minutes of cooking. I served this with a mixed greens salad with a vegetable salsa of sweet red and yellow pepper, jicama, and plum tomato marinated in an olive oil, balsamic vinegar dressing flavored with honey, fresh ground black peppercorns, sea salt, and fresh cilantro. As a great garnish, I stuffed a lightly steamed small red apple with sugared grapes, walnuts, and chopped dates that had been soaked in brandy for about two hours. This definitely has that "old time at home on a snowy day" ambiance with a colorful and tasty twist to enhance the presentation! We love it!!
