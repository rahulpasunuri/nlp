found this recipe while looking for something to do with leftover red delicious apples and chipotle chiles in adobe sauce. made half the recipe and added pine nuts to the apple/sugar mixture and crumbled 1 Field Roast Italian sausage into skillet while cooking. then sprinkled cheddar cheese over mixture in an omelette. sooo tasty!

This was a perfect side to the pork. I was tempted to skip it but had just purchased an apple corer (about time!) and it was just too easy. My husband never eats seconds on principal but he devoured these and the pork. This is a keeper.

Also made this to go with the Roast Port with Port Au Jus for Christmas dinner. Hubby who doesn't like cooked apple raved, and compliments the pork perfectly. Made exactly, only I made some very thin, so they went like crunchy toffee (for those who don't like cooked apple), and some normal slices. Both were lovely. To stop the smoking (like napalm), simply add the chipotle to very hot oil then remove as flavour permeates oil well, then fry apples.

Very good. I just sliced the apples with an all-in-one corer and slicer. Might have sliced them thinner if I had time to get more of the taste. Went great with the roast pork with port jus.

I made this to go with the Roast Port with Port Au Jus. It was really an excellent accompaniment. I couldn't find canned Chipotle, so I used dried ones which I softened by soaking for 20 minutes in hot water. The only problem I had was that during cooking, the fumes were so toxic, everyone in the house (3500 sq ft) was coughing and rubbing their eyes! If you make this, open the doors! We were all nervous about trying it for fear that it would be too hot, but it wasn't at all. It was great.

I decided to make this an accompanient to my husband's broiled pork chops. Since we were cooking for two, I just made one batch of the apples. Just as I finished the apples, my husband decided to finish his pork chops in the scrapings in the pan. A great pairing!

We loved this served with grilled turkey kielbasa and quinoa/beet/fennel salad. Couldn't help but think "Gee, this tastes like Stouffer's Escalloped Apples only with chipotles!". Hmmm... wonder if that would be a 'cheater' for a hurried supper??? Will for sure make again!

A Family favorite. Great with turkey or over ice cream. A great way to use up apples that are a bit old.

This is an absolute must with the pork dish. My guests always comment on the wonderful sweet-hot flavor of the apples. And it's okay to use the chipotles in adobo sauce; I did because I couldn't find anything else and it was delicious. Wonderful!

In a word, Yummy! In two words, Really Yummy! We recommend: Fresh cinnamon! Peel & slice the apples into a big bowl. Wait a little bit. In the saute pan, use a little less oil, make sure the pan is hot & add a little bit of the apple juice that settled to the bottom of the bowl to each batch. Make sure you get a can of JUST chilies, not in a garlic whatever sauce...

Very good, even though I used less chiles than required. The hot and sweet work very well together and the dish goes well with the roast pork with port jus.

Tasty and intense side dish, try this if you like big flavors. But take care not to get distracted and scorch these even a little bit -- the smoke, with volatile chili oils, is tough on eyes and throat!
