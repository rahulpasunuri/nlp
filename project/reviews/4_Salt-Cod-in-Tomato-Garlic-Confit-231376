I made this dish as part of my Christmas eve seafood dinner. My husband and I loved it. I did manage to find the center cut cod, it was being sold at the regular grocery store down the street. Perhaps just for the holidays. I followed the soaking instructions exactly, and sliced the cod after the soaking. For the confit, I decided to use my garlic press for the garlic rather than attempting to smash the cloves after cooking. I felt the garlic would be better distributed that way. So, I only cooked the small pieces of garlic in the oil for a minute before adding the tomatoes. There is absolutely no way for this mixture to achieve confit consistency in 45 minutes. Especially over low heat. It took me more like 2 or 3 hours. I added a small amount of red pepper flakes for a bit of heat, which I recommend. The mayonnaise mixture browned very nicely. I subbed sour cream for the creme fraiche, which worked fine. The garlic, tomato, and cod flavors were much too strong for the difference to be detected. So I would not look all over town for creme fraiche, just use sour cream. The presentation is very pretty.

I made this dish this weekend. I liked the idea but found the confit bland and thin for my tastes. I adjusted by cooking much longer than the recipe specified - 3 hours on a very low light until the sauce thickened. I also added some red pepper flakes and a bit of orange zest.

This recipe is one of the simplest and most delicious you'll find out there. We tried with non center cut salt cod. The presentation was still decent and the taste was outstanding. The creme fraiche we didn't find at the local grocer so googled it for a substitute. The recommendation was to use Mexican Style sour creme and it worked perfectly.

This dish is absolutley delicious -- served with rosé. One caveat, however: I had never worked with salt cod before attempting this recipe, so I followed the instructions to the letter. NEVER try to cut salt cod into smaller pieces before soaking, as indicated in this recipe. Three stiches in my index finger later (and reading through other salt cod recipes) I realize it needs to tenderize before safely taking a knife to it. So tasty it's almost worth it, though...

I made this for Christmas Eve for our Seven Fish dinner and it was great! Everyone loved it and said it was a refreshing spin on the traditional baccala we used to eat as kids. Will definitely make again next year.

Absolutely fabulous combination of flavors. Well written recipe - easy to do. I added browned cubed potatoes to the confit just before layering with the fish and used equal parts mayo and yogurt with chopped parsley for the topping.

Huge hit at dinner party, even made with the apparently sub-par chewy end pieces (which I poached in milk). I accidentally chopped the garlic before cooking (did not ruin anything) and used heavy cream and sour cream in place of mayo and creme fraiche, but this was one seriously delicious fish dish. And not too labor-intensive, if you ignore the soaking and cooking time.

I'm not sure I should really be rating this recipe since all I did was use it as an inspiration for my own salt cod experiment, but I did love it as a concept to work with. I didn't use the mayo, used just a splash of regular cream, added black olives, and instead of poaching the cod beforehand, I just added it to the tomato mixture and simmered in that. It was a hit with the guests, and I would definitely use this flavor combination again with salt cod.

I haven't made this recipe, but I want to answer the question about creme fraiche. It's a French product that now can be found in most supermarkets in the dairy case by the sour creams. It's similar to sour cream, and if you can't find it, sour cream can make a good substitute for it.

Anyone know what creme fraiche is???

The confit was outstanding--and so simple. The salt cod was disappointing, though I don't think I had center-cut pieces as was recommended. I would make this again using shrimp or fresh fish instead.
