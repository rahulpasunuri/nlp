Made half a recipe. Used 2 lbs lobster claws from Costco, figuring after taking of the shells it would be about 1.5 lbs. I used Jarlsberg and Champagne Cheddar. The Jarlsberg sort of granulated instead of melting...not the best choice. But the flavor was great and the dish overall was perfect for Valentine's with champagne. And yes, do strain the sauce before adding the cheese.

Made half the recipe, had a great taste but hard to get the cheese and cream sauce to blend. Cheese clumped with veggies when I strained so luckily I had extra cheese to add again. Should have strained before cheese as another review mentioned!

I modified this recipe a bit to keep my cost down. It was delicious and we never missed the Lobster Meat or the Truffle Slices. I also cut this recipe in half to feed a smaller party of 3 and we still had a bit left over which reheated nicely in a saute pan. I added a touch of milk to keep it moist. I can't wait to make it again.

I consider myself to be an experienced cook. I kept the temp very low to try and melt the cheese. It turned out to be a lump of cheese in cream sauce. Would love to know why all these ratings are positive. It was a complete waste of time and effort.

Made this for Fathers Day Dinner, DELICIOUS! I substituted crab for lobster. For cost efficiency I used Truffle Infused Olive oil and added a few drops to the pasta after it cooked for the truffle flavor. Used these cheeses: Beechers, White Cheddar and Applewood Smoked Guyere along with the Fontina. After cooking on stove I transferred to a glass baking dish and baked in 350 degree oven for 20 minutes. SO GOOOD!

Delicious results! Added a tablespoon of Congnac to the cream,white wine and veggies then strained after the reduction period (much simpler than straining after the cheese has been added). Did not use lobster (too pricey) but added shredded crab meat. Rave reviews from friends at luncheon.

YUM! This was quite good. I made as written, except I forgot to add truffle oil at the end, DRAT! Still was good. Note, with two pounds of pasta, this makes a lot of pasta.

Great recipe. Made one half exactly as written and would not change a thing. Amazing!!!

Way better than Kraft mac n cheese. Just kidding! Couldn't find any lobster (even though we are in the middle of the Pacific Ocean) so I substituted scallops and jumbo shrimp. Would probably be beyond exceptional with lobster though. Left out the carrots and celery and used pear and grape tomatoes instead. My boyfriend usually doesn't care for pasta dishes but he has fallen in love and claimed this one of the best evers. He's even begging for round two tonight.
