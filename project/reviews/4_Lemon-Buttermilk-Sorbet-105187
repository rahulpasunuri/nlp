So simple and so exceptional. I've made this several times and it's great as written but with just 1.5c sugar. Served with a blackberry tart with lemon mascarpone filling at a dinner party and received rave reviews. I've also made this with half buttermilk and half greek yogurt (both low/non-fat) and found the end result still creamy and rich. I'm throwing in a few Tbsp of vodka and one Tbsp of corn syrup at the end this time to see if it results in a slightly more scoopable post-freezer product.

I agree with other reviewers that 1.5 c sugar is perfect -and a needed recipe change. That said, this recipe is a winner. Super easy, refreshing and elegant. Voilà. You are a dinner party genius.

One more thing....stirring in the zest just before putting in the freezer to harden works for me...and avoids the clumping in the ice cream maker. Don't forget to cut back on the sugar!

Delicious every time. I haven't tried it with vodka, but I did make it with lime instead of lemon, and a little tequila added. Very tasty.

Wow - fabulous! I halved the recipe (I have the cuisinart ice cream maker) and it seemed to fill my machine. I like things sweet, but I still followed other's advice and reduced the sugar and thought it was delicious that way. I also added 2 tbsp vodka (4 tbsp for a full recipe) because if you're not going to eat it out of the mixer right away, the alcohol keeps it from freezing too hard, and keeps the perfect smooth consistency. Vodka works in any flavor of ice cream. I will definitely make this again, but my zest did clump up around the churn and wasn't mixed in, but I stirred it around and it was fine.

I love this recipe BUT in my freezer it takes more than 24 hours to "harden" after being in the ice cream maker for 20 minutes, ANd two cups of sugar makes it too sweet, I would use 1 and 1/2 or 1 and 3/4.

A co-worker recommended this recipe on Friday. I realized I had a quart of buttermilk and 4 lemons in my fridge, so today, Sunday I made it, and I'm not sure it will last the night. We had friends over for grilling and swimming for the holiday weekend and I thought this would be a great time to try out a new recipe. So glad I did. And as we were all eating it, we talked about all the different citrus we could use instead, and now that I've read the reviews, it seems that many have. I will definitely be making this again!

This is a very refreshing recipe although we have reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups without a problem.

This is by far the EASIEST sorbet recipe I have some across in my search and it tastes AMAZING! Try serving it with some sliced pound cake and fresh red berries for a light summer dessert. To DIE for!

This is one of my all time favorite recipes from this site and the first recipe I have reviewed. I almost always make it with lime or meyer lemons from my tree. Like others I cut back on sugar to 1.5 cups. Great with blueberry topping when in season.

Rating: 4
I adore this recipe, with a big caveat. Once the sugar is adjusted, this recipe becomes one of my favorite summer desserts of all time. However, if I follow the recipe as is, I find its sweetness nearly obnoxious. I cut the sugar in half and then added just a bit more to taste. Once you get the proportions right, it's a real crowd pleaser.

Works with both lemon and lime juice, but I prefer to leave out the grated rind (makes it quicker that way, too). Using superfine sugar ensures that it will mix well before freezing.

Rating: 4
So easy and very good! Mere minutes to put together, most of the time is chilling and churning. The end result is smooth and incredibly lemony, yet not "puckery." I can see doing this with any number of citrus - tangerines, blood oranges - go nuts! This one is so good and easy, there's no reason not to.

This sorbet was wonderful; a nice, clean taste that was delicious on its own and as part of our Thanksgiving Day feast.

My sorbet isn't even completely frozen yet (I keep sticking a spoon into the ice cream maker) and I have to say, it's DELICIOUS. Definitely a keeper!

I've made this with lemon and with lime and both are delicious.

Delicious! I used the full fat version of buttermilk - it is creamy and has just the right amount of tartness. Very refreshing - it would probably go well with a blueberry or blackberry tart or crumble. I have not written an Epicurious review in over a year but was inspired by how good this was and had to put my two cents in!

Easy, delicious and relatively guilt free!

Outstanding sorbet - light, tangy, and refreshing! I used 1.5c sugar as suggested and strained the buttermilk to get rid of yellow flecks (they don't alter the flavor, but they do impart a greasy mouthfeel if left in). I've made this 4 times now for guests, each time to rave reviews.

This was fantastic, though I will definitely cut down on the sugar next time to 1.5 cups, it was way too sweet. But so simple and delicious, served with a pear cake--yummy!

Would I make this again? YES, and again and again and again! Actually I have made this sorbet (actually a sherbet) nearly a dozen times, and always to rave reviews. As another person suggested, a micro-plane zester is perfect for a no-pith result. I always use our homegrown Meyer lemons, which are less acidic and substitute low fat buttermilk. A tiny pinch of salt adds a great foil to the sweetness. Serving with strawberries and/or blueberries results in a sweet/tart explosion on your tongue that is awesome! Try!

I cut back on the sugar, and next time I'd cut it even more (to about 1.5 cups). I used the juice of two lemons and one orange, and also a big splash of limoncello. This was really really really good and so easy to make. I would not add more lemon rind than is called for, as it tended to clump together.

Made this for my husband's birthday dinner, it was well received by all. I used meyer lemons and cut back on the sugar a bit, as I love lemon desserts to be more tangy than sweet. Great with crisp ginger cookies on the side.

ALWAYS a winner and couldn't be easier. Try by first putting zest and sugar in a food processor for a few minutes then add remaining ingredients. Add your favorite orange or lemon liquer. Great using limes as well. Can also substitute plain yogurt for the buttermilk.

So delicious-- the perfect amount of tartness and sweetness. Highly recommended! Does anyone know if this would work with another type of fruit besides citrus?

This is one of those rare recipes where the texture turns out great even if you don't have a top-of-the-line ice cream maker. Highly recommended!

This is a wonderful sorbet. I've prepared in the past with lemon and absolutely loved it. Today, I made it with orange juice instead while leaving out the peel. It was similarly yummy. The one thing I would recommend is to cut down on the sugar if you're making this recipe with orange. A wonderful refreshing dessert regardless.

This sorbet had just the right texture and "bite" to make it one of my favorites, I will definately make this again.

Delish. (Had leftover buttermilk from the low fat banana bread recipe from this site-also good) Wish I had found this during the summer! I made it with half lemon and half lime. Used a microplane to zest so it has very fine, tiny yellow and green flecks. I used Splenda in place of the sugar and no one noticed. Can't wait to experiment with other flavors.

Very refreshing I am on a lemon feta and added extra lemon. Do not! add extra lemon this recipe is fine just as is. Luckily I had raspberry syrup on hand to drizzle on my pucker up sorbet to calm the lemon down. Yummy

Best sorbet I've ever had. I'm not a buttermilk drinker (eww) but this was amazing. You get the creamy texture on your tongue and all kinds of zing. I zest my lemons in a cool but laborious way. Start with washed organic lemons. Put the sugar the recipe calls for in a big wide bowl. Rub the sugar into the lemon (with the palm of your hand, energetically). As the sugar drops into the bowl it takes the lemon oils with it- you'll see it color. You'll notice it only takes off the topmost layer of zest. It takes a little more time but the flavor is superior (all the good oils, promptly dissolved into all of the ingredients) and you don't have the bits of zest in your mouth.

I saved this recipe several weeks ago when I bought my ice cream maker, and finally had time to try it out. The result was wonderful, although I should have looked back on the reviews and followed advice to reduce sugar, as this is a bit sweet for my taste. I'll just use it over blueberries to balance. I'll definitely try this as a base for other flavors.

Outstanding taste on a hot summer night with fresh berries. I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups sugar and it was perfect---everyone kept giving me complements and phoned for the recipe. The buttermilk gives this sorbet a very special taste.

I don't like buttermilk but LOVED this dessert. I only gave it 3 forks because half the family found it too lemony. If you like lemon-flavoured desserts, you will love this. I couldn't stop eating it! The fact that it's low fat is a bonus.

This recipe was better than I had imagined, and very easy. Friends and family ask for this every summer. I have even replaced the fresh lemon juice and rind, with fresh squeezed orange juice and rind, and it was just as smooth and delicious.

This sorbet recipe couldn't have been easier. I haven't had good luck with sorbets because they often set too hard. The buttermilk in this made for a nice smooth texture. Even my husband requested that I make this again - and he's pretty picky about ice creams.

Great stuff. I agree it sounds to simple. It has a great complex taste and you would never guess buttermilk was in it. With a few fresh berries and a cookie it is perfect as a light desert.

Wow. Talk about the sum being greater than its parts. Thought this would be so-so but easy so I tried it and loved it. My husband (who's iffy on anything lemon and not much of a cook) even made it for himself one evening when I was gone-that's the highest praise there is in our house. Make it. You'll love it.

I have made this several times, using different flavorings each time. A little extract or flavored syrup can sub for the lemon juice, making a completely different experience. My latest: toasted almond made with almond extract and chopped toasted slivered almonds stirred in at the end. This is now my basic ice cream recipe.

Delicious and refreshing! I made it with lime instead of lemon -- key lime, to be exact, and it reminded me a little of key lime pie. This is a knockout dish that is incredibly easy to make! Sticklers for aesthetics may want to strain the buttermilk through cheesecloth to get rid of the yellow flecks. I can't wait to make this for friends -- I have a feeling they'll be wowed!

this is excellent and so easy to make. i had oral surgery last week and made this to munch on while healing. although i can't recommend trying lemon-anything on a fresh incision (duh!!!), this kept me going. it's very refreshing and has held up for several days in the freezer. i will definitely make it again.

I thought this was a little too sweet, so next time I will reduce the sugar a bit. Liked the combination of buttermilk and lemon, though. Very easy to make, even though I don't have an ice cream maker (I used the pan-in-the-freezer method like another cook).

Yummy, and appreciated by everyone in our household. We liked the strong flavor (made it with lime and lime zest) and the low-fat buttermilk yielded good results. It's still in the freezer, but not for long. Will be using this often in the hot months.

Luscious with the lime!! Do chop the zest -- I didn't and the strips were a little stringy. We still devoured this, our favorite sorbet/ice cream among four in two weeks (yes we have a new ice cream maker).

We did not care for the buttermilk flavor. I wanted a sorbet with more zing but the buttermilk mellowed it out too much. It was very easy to make though, I will give it that.

This will now be a standard in our house. My husband doesn't like sweets and he really liked this sorbet. I agree that the lemon comes through too much. The buttermilk/lemon ratio was perfect the day we made it. However, after it had been in the freezer for a day it overpowered the good buttermilk flavor. Next time, I will try it with half the zest or even with the juice and no zest. Regardless, it was delicious. I am going to try it in the fall/winter months with gingerbread. I think it would also be nice with a blueberry tart or blackberry cobbler.

We are a family that makes home made ice cream often. This is a fabulous recipe. The buttermilk gives the sorbet a rich, creamy texture. We have already make it three times and each time topped it with different fresh berries.

This recipe was very easy, delicious, and refreshing. I also tried making it with lime juice instead of lemon, and it was every bit as wonderful. Las time I served this, I made one-half a recipe of each the lemon and lime, and served one small scoop of each alongside one another. Next time I try this, I am going to substitute Splenda for the sugar, and cut out most of the calories. Splenda does not have the artificial tast of other sweeteners such as nutrasweet.

This was also good. The lemon flavor is there. Next time I may consider reducing lemon peel a bit. Lemon flavor comes through almost too much. Froze in a 9 by 13 pan with good results. Very easy to prepare.

Always on the lookout for lower fat desserts, I absolutely loved this sorbet. It tastes very rich and creamy, but the freshness of the lemons leaves a nice clean finish. Even though my ice cream maker crashed and I had to make this using the granita-freeze-in-the-pan method...it still worked beautifully. Yum...I can't wait to make this again.

Wonderfully refreshing and unbelievably easy to make! Perfect summer dessert! Towards the end of the time in the ice cream maker, I added about 1/4 cup of Limoncello liqueur. If you wanted something not quite so sweet, a bit of Absolut Citron would make a nice palate cleanser but haven't tried that version yet so I don't know for sure.
