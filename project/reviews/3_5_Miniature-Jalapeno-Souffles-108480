I thought these were good, but not great. I probably won't make them again.

I have used this recipe for years and is a favorite. Doesn't mixing the flour and pine nuts together and then pouring excess out of the tins wastes the pine nuts? I spray the tins with Pam for Baking and sprinkle the pine nuts in the bottom. Or dust the tins with flour and shake out excess THEN add pine nuts. I use 1 heaping tablespoon jalapenos, and 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard and maybe a little more cheese in each recipe. I usually double the recipe each time I make it as the flour jalapeno mixture makes such a little amount. It is important to use whole milk and not low fat. Exceptional!

I love this recipe. Was extremely easy to make and was consumed in a flash. It is worth it to take the extra effort to get some Gruyere cheese, the flavor just shines through.

My BF and I made these for a dinner club appetizer. We used sauteed peppers instead of pickled. They were very popular and not a bite remained. We felt they were a tad eggy and in need of more peppers and pine nuts, but maybe that's because we used sauteed fresh instead of pickled. If you use fresh, add more. I would try it again with more peppers or with pickled, as described. As a great side, my BF roasted dry red chilis in olive oil, salt and butter and they were a knock out. A throw-back to his youth.

This was one of the easiest receipes, and got rave reviews even from my picky family. Only got about 9 mini souffles though, will use more generous portions next time.

Loved this recipe. I used as part of a large spread for a "modern tea party" held in honor of my mother's 60th birthday party. Made ahead, lovely reheated or even room temperature. Used canned (pickeled) jalapeños, doubled the amount. Fab!

I've made these souffles as holiday appetizers for a few years now. This year I tried making them with pepperchinis instead of jalepenos, doubling the pepperchinis. Oh my, they went over even better than usual. It think it was because those who normally steer away from the "too spicy" ate them as well. I will definitely continue to make them but with the pepperchini substitution.

Made these as appetizers for Christmas. Quadrupled the recipe and there wasn't even a crumb left! I thought they could have used a bit more jalepeno, but I like my food spicy. Everyone in our family raved about them and made me promise to make them again.

Just made these last week and have already had several requests for the recipe. They really are easy to make and taste great. I followed the recipe to the letter.

Amazingly delicious and easy. I do not like Gruyere so I substituted with plain old sharp chedder which is how I make my standard cheese souffle. It came great! I made mine a day in advance and reheated them. I going to try to make a miniature spinach souffle or just plain cheese as well.

These are tasty little treats. I'll definitely make them again, but they'll be spicier...

While I thought these were just so so, most of the reviews I got were fabulous. Texture I heard was very light. Everyone else loved them. They were also very easy to make. I too used fresh jalapenos.

I have made these several times and think they are terrific. I even made them omitting jalapenos for those who can not eat spicy foods, only adding more cheese and Dijon mustard for more flavor. When using jalapenos, I ad about twice the amount called for. I made it even easier by spraying muffin tins with cooking spray with flour and then adding pine nuts to the bottom. Then proceed with the recipe as written, awesome!

These disappeared at my party Saturday night, even though they had cooked overly long (I got distracted on the phone!), and had been reheated. Still delicious, and easy!

These are so delicious and surprisingly easy! I made a single batch and a double batch for a church function. The recipe is versatile also. The first batch I made exactly per the recipe, the second batch I made with sharp cheddar cheese and smoked ham instead of the jalapeno and mustard and put grated cheese on top when they came out of the oven. Both batches were excellent!

YUMMY! this is an easy recipe that renders great results. I used my favorite Chapsmackers pickled jalapenos and the flavor mixed with the gruyere was perfect- not too spicy, but a nice, smooth, slow burn after...I had to keep eating them! Between my 17 mo. old and my husband, there were none left. Will make these for our next get-together. I do like spicy hot, so next time I will likely add a bit more peppers.

These were delicious! I was a bit concerned after reading some of the reviews that I would have trouble getting them out of the pan. I have non-stick muffin pan and had no trouble whatsoever. They freeze well and are great served warm or at room temperature.

I thought this recipe was fair to average but my guests were gobbling them down faster than I could put them on the plate so go figure.

So they fall! They're mini *souffles* ... Per a previous reviewer's request, I used fresh jalapenos, minced as small as possible with NO seeds. I added a teaspoon of lime juice to compensate for the pickling. Per other reviewer's comments, I used white cheddar instead of gruyere for a little zing. They were fabulous -- light, fluffy, good flavor and a just spicy enough. They were also gone in 15 minutes. :) I chanced using a regular muffin tin and didn't have any problems with sticking. Definitely a keeper.

We thought these were great. Yes, they do deflate fairly quicky but they have a great flavor. I used a teflon pan and had no problem at all with them sticking. Made them with the spicy corn chowder also on this site and it was a very nice weeknight meal (although these are a little more work than you might want on a weeknight).

Nice flavor, but disappointing spongey texture. And they stuck to a buttered, floured pan. Not worth the effort to make them again.

This recipe turned out well as an appetizer at a dinner party I hosted. I buttered the mini muffin pans and they still got stuck so use teflon coated if you have it. They had a great tangy flavor and a light consistency. I made them ahead, baked them, cooled them and re-warmed them and they turned out great and there were only crumbs left. A lot of people with different ideas and beleifs use the wesite for a common love of RECIPES. I recommend taking political beliefs and arguments to a different forum desgined for that purpose.

These definitely are't very pretty, and while I thought they were a little bland, others at the party seemed to love them. (No leftovers, anyway). And to the cook in LA, it's amusing that it "scares" you to see others' comments regarding their opinions, but you don't seem to have any qualms about sharing yours. Hmm. Should I be scared?

Just made these for a party and they were gone in 5 minutes. Double or triple the recipe. As for the op-ed critics from LA, you forgot to add Hillary Clinton and Tipper Gore to your list of censorship advocates.

I think that rude comments and profane language do nothing but embarass the person who made them, and render any statement they attempted to make meaningless. However, what scares me are the people who are so "offended" by this nonsense. Are there really that many Bill O'Reilly-watching, Presence of Weapons of Mass Destruction-believing, Patriot Act-supporting, Lee Greenwood-listening, real-life Hank Hill clones out there?

Thumbs up to the teen cook from Montreal! And a big thumbs down to the reviewers from San Francisco and New Milford. While I agree that this is no place for offensive language, don't jump to the conclusion that only kids will do such things. There are many vulgar adults, and far more incredible kids/teens, who deserve our support and encouragement (to cook, as well as other things).

These are not difficult to make if you have a mini-processor and a hand-held mixer and a non-stick mini-muffin pan. They also are very tasty, and a perfect side for roast/grilled meats on a no-carb diet. That said, they look awful. They fall immediately after being removed from the oven, and come out like little round omelets. Forget re-heating, that makes them taste like little re-warmed round omelets. Unless someone has a solution to that, I'd recommend you move on.

Well, though you get an occasional kid who thinks these reviews are funny, don't group all teens together in that lump.. some of us really do enjoy cooking and would never post a review like that.

Hi Los Angelos, I was wondering the same thing. I asked a chef I know and here's what he said: the pickled jalopenos have a mellower flavor that distributes more evenly in the body of the souffle, so each bite will seem to have the same heat and spiciness. Using fresh will add bursts of strong jalopeno flavor to specific bites. Either one sounds good to me. Hope this helps. If you make this recipe with fresh, be sure to post your results in the revew section. I'm sure they will be appreciated!

do you have to use pickled jalapenos? why not just regular ones that come fresh? i would be very happy if someone would please share their info with me

Thanks New Milford, NJ for setting people straight! The offensive email was clearly from a kid (who else says 'brutal' and thinks 'hemmorrhoids' are funny!) Don't let one review ruin a very useful website/tool for you. Teenagers aren't usually interested enough in cooking to spend much time on this site, and those types of offensive comments are uncommon.

The review obviously had to be written by a kid, not an adult. Call it the internet version of a crank call. I e-mailed Epicurious and asked them to remove the review. I see they did the same thing on another one of the recipes that was featured as well. (Shouldn't these kids be in school already?!)

I initially thought this recipe sounded quite good, and checked the reviews to see what other peoples' opinions were. Well, I was so thoroughly offended by the crude insensitivity of the Toilet reviewer that I have decided to discontinue my epicurius subscription rather than bookmarking the recipe. I'm shocked that a review like that would be printed. And here's a stupid question: If you don't like jalapenos, why did you make the recipe in the first place?

I cannot understand the crass rudeness of one of your reviews. This is the first time I have read the reviews and was appalled!!! If a person doesn't like the recipe then that is all that is needed to say! I think it is great that you ask for reviews and hope this kind of rudeness will stop.

I liked these, but they are a tad on the salty side. And, as already noted, they really do deflate. But the leftovers heated up nicely one (or was it 2?) days later, so this is a good recipe to keep in mind for a do-ahead party food. I may tinker a bit with the cheese and/or salt next time, though.

These are just lovely. I can imagine they would make nice small hors d'oeurves. But I doubled the recipe and made 5 individual 1st course souffles in ramekins. They are easy to make and the recipe seems quite forgiving. As promised, they make a nice puffy presentation but they do deflate rapidly.
