I tried the pretzel shape, but it turned out to be a pain... not because of the dough, but because I'm impatient! These have a wonderful flavor and texture, almost like a biscotti. I ended up making simple "sticks" out of what would have been the pretzels (same skinny strips) and melted some bittersweet chocolate chips, drizzled them over the sticks, and served them in shot glasses. They were a hit! I'm going to try this recipe with cinnamon, or ground pistachios, etc. If you don't like espresso, I think anything that can be finely ground would make a good substitute in these crispy snack cookies.

Seemed like a good idea...but surprisingly difficult - the dough was too soft to shape easily, and then, making the chocolate stripes wasn't too easy either. Mine looked ugly. Oh well.

I found this recipe to be very good, although a tad on the greasy side. I made them very thin, so that they were crunchy like pretzels and I didn't grind the beans to cocoa powder consistancy, i let them be a little large, almost like instant coffee, so that you see specks in the pretzels and it's so pretty, I mean, I think that's what the recipe wanted. PLus, I had a lot of fun eating most of the dough.

1/7/02: 4 forks. Wow, I had no idea these would be so good! Even the non-coffee drinkers found the coffee flavor of the cookies just right and so appealing. (I had no espresso beans, so used instant coffee powder.) While baking, the cookies do not flatten out or expand, but they do lighten up in color and end up as light brown pretzels -- a unique presentation for cookies. Next time, I will be sure to make the cookies small enough to get 60 cookies out of it. Not only will the resulting cookies be sized more like the pretzels you buy in stores, but the cookies will taste better too. You see, I got 49 and found that the outside was crisp but the insides were just slightly chewy. Though I generally love chewy cookies, somehow I felt this one should be crisp throughout -- maybe because of the pretzel illusion? Anyway, if I had made the cookies slightly smaller, they would have cooked through more. Just break off a ball of dough about 1 cm in diameter and roll it into a rope. Also, we found the drizzled bittersweet chocolate very visually appealing but much too sweet. Perhaps I will try drizzling unsweetened chocolate with a little bit of sugar instead. 12/9/02: 2 forks. Hm, not sure why these didn't taste as good the second time around. This time I used finely ground espresso beans, not instant coffee powder. And the bittersweet chocolate was of the perfect sweetness, so I didn't try the sugar-unsweetened chocolate combination after all.

Good espresso flavor. These freeze well although the chocolate drizzled over them breaks off very easily.

disaster! Probably the only thing I've baked that I had to throw out the entire effort. maybe I got a measurement wrong but these plumped up and lost their pretzel look. and I had some trouble with the chocolate so they looked ugly too. maybe bcs they plumped up, the taste was weird and chewy but granular. I'll try again when I'm feeling more patient to get these perfect.

A big hit in the X-mas cookie trays this year. They were easy to make once you get the knack of the twist, look fantastic, and taste wonderful. They are a bit rich to be served on their own, but with coffee, or ice cream, or in a selection of other cookies they are beyond perfect.

These are fantastic- I have been making them every year since 1997 and they've always been a hit! Fun to make and easy to do, these cookies are favourites that I always include in my holiday care packages.

I like the fact that they are very different fom other cookies. The recipe does not yield 60 pretzels like it it indicated in the magazine but they are easy to do.

These are so good and so different. They've become a Christmas tradition that my mom asks for annually!
