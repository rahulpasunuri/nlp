You can easily alter spiciness by choosing to keep the seeds of the jalapenos (which are the spiciest party). We like spicy, so I used the seeds of 1.5 jalapenos. Unfortunately, I put everything in my Cuisinart to chop and it ended up more like a thick sauce than a stew... had to cook a little extra b/c the lamb didn't get tender as quickly. But it was great and had some real kick!

Very yummy. I added a few sprinkles of ground coriander and red pepper flakes to punch the spice. I served it with peas and couscous.

This one was quite bland and boring. In fact I was so bored half way through eating the dish that I decided to mix a half cup of yogurt to the dish to give it sort of a Turkish Iskender Kabob taste...and it actually worked out pretty nicely!

This dish was OK for me. It seemed a little too tomatoish. Perhaps next time I will increase the amount of spices that the actual recipe calls for. In the mean time I'll be looking for other easy lamb recipes. Any suggestions?

I thought it was really tasty, would try to incorporate some veggies into it, such as red pepper or carrots

I added more jalapenos, deglazed with red wine, but have to say this recipe just does not rock my boat. My honey didn't think much of it either.

What a lovely, simple recipe! I had some leftover roasted lamb which I tossed in close to the end of the cooking time. Rather than serving it over mashed potatoes, I presented it over split biscuits and increased the cilantro so that I could sprinkle it over the whole plate. The next time I'd increase the number of jalapenos and would pass some crushed hot chile flakes too. This is a marvelous recipe.

After reading the previous reviews I was a bit confused as to how spicy this dish would be. I'm not really big on "hot". I find the "medium" Pace brand salsa hot enough. Any hotter and I loose my tastebuds in the heat. I stuck to the original recipe and used 3 jalapeno's and found it a bit too spicy. I will make it again, but only use 2 peppers, as I love to taste the lamb.

This was my first time cooking lamb. Luckily, I started with a great recipe. I was timid with the jalapenos and stayed with the recommended 3. The dish had just a taste of heat. My husband had 2 helpings over mashed potatoes and then remarked, 'he thought he didn't like lamb'.

This is one AWESOME recipe!! I doubled the jalapenos per another review (and added some seeds, too) and the spice was just right. I also tried 1/2 diced tomatoes, 1/2 tomato sauce. Used loin lamb chops, so cutting the meat off the bone was a bit of a chore, but the rest was soooo easy and the results were soooo tasty! Served over couscous. A dream!!

WOW! Made this for friends last night and it was amazing. I added 4 hot peppers with seeds and a dash of cayenne. Still it was not to hot just a nice heat. I also used a combination of home canned tomatoes crushed and home canned tomato paste. I served it with the garlic herb mashed potatoes. YUM!

O.K. in short this is one good meal. I was a chef in South Florida for over 10 years and the rule of thumb "make it simple make it good". This one does both. Double the meat and the peppers and it can not be beat. Hey 100% would make it again! I used it with the mashed potatoes combined with herb cheese.

Yummy recipe! I did double the number of jalapenos and added a couple pinches of red pepper flakes to boot, and it STILL could have used more pep! But any more heat and the dish might overpower the flavor of any accompanying wine. The only other alteration I made to this wonderfully simple recipe was to deglaze the pan with a splash of red wine just before I added the tomato sauce and beef broth, to get the brown bits up off the bottom of the pan from the onions and meat. Serving with plain cous cous really allows the flavors of the dish to stand out.

This is incredibly easy to make and really delicious. Not spicy though - I would probably double the jalapenos next time.

I never had lamb stew before -- this recipe was delicious. I kept some of the seeds of the jalapenos out thinking it would be too spicy, but next time I'm leaving them in! I added some diced carrots with 30 minutes to go, and that was a nice addition. I had some leftover for the next day and it tasted even better then! The flavors really blended together.

Well, I just couldn't stop eating it until the whole pot was finished! I guess that says something (and it wasn't just that I was hungry!). I did add extra garlic and used crushed red chili peppers instead of jalapeno. Also added a dollop of red wine. I used lamb neck bone meat, which was a pain to cut off the bones, but very flavorful. And I added a few of the bones to the stew while cooking for even more flavor. Serve with red wine (who cares about the mashed potatoes!). YUM!

This dish was delicious! Instead of putting in 1/3 cup of beef broth, I used the entire can. I then added oil and flour mixture to thicken the stew. Served it over mash potatoes and crusty bread on the side, it was to die for! My boyfriend and brother LOVED it! This is definitely a crowd pleaser.

As suggested above, chopped olives are a great addition to this dish. I served it over Jasmati rice - and had my husband licking the plate!

This is an excellent recipe, full-flavored and fairly spicy. I couldn't find lamb stew meat, so I used lamb shoulder instead. The meat came out very tender, rich and savory. As noted, this dish goes perfectly with mashed potatoes (I made "Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes," also from this website).

Very easy to make and quite delicious. I used beef and served over Kasmati Rice. Also, I added spanish olives 10 minutes before finishing and they added a marvelous flavor to the dish, augmenting the jalapenos.

I make this with beef instead of lamb. It's great! A cross between an Indian-style and Mexican-style dish. It can get quite spicy.
