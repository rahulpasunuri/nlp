a great start. read as many reviews as you can and play with it. add a lot more garlic, a touch of sesame oil, mushrooms, and whatever veggies you have around. this time I added a handful of carrots, a bag of snow peas, a package of sliced white mushrooms and a stick of celery.

We thought this had good flavor. Whether breast or thigh that doesnt seem to matter. However, I think this is a good base for a larger stir fry. We added snow peas, but next time probablly peas, cabbage and water chestnuts. It does need more veggies.

Awful. Bitter and practically inedible. Very sad throwing out those expensive ingredients. Ive been using Epicurious for many years and this is the first crashing disappointment.

It was decent, and my husband really enjoyed it. I would recommend halving the cashews, and using chicken breasts not chicken thighs as I don't think this recipe needs the extra moisture. I served it with noodles sauted with garlic, ginger and soy, and garlic-sesame stir fried veggies and it went very well. I might make this again, but am still on the lookout for GREAT stir fry recipes.

Looks good, smells good, tastes delicious. I am, however, not a fan of chicken thighs so I would make this with boneless breasts next time and hope it isn't dry. This is a keeper for my recipe box!

Very easy to make. Short preparation time. Really enjoyed this meal. Would consider adding more dried hot peppers for extra spice.

I served this with brown rice for my mom and a friend (both teachers) on a busy school night. I used the ground ginger equivalent and low sodium soy sauce, plus an additional red bell pepper and just made a little extra sauce. A bit spicy for their tastes but perfect for mine, and wonderfully easy. Next time with tofu and a bit of steamed broccoli!

This was delicious and I will definitely make it again. The whole family enjoyed it.

This is a home run. Far and away the best stir fry I could ever make at home. Always, always make a double batch!

This is one of our household favorites: reasonably fast to make, very satisfying and with the red bells, nice to look at. I've made it (by accident, I forgot) without the cashews, I always add more garlic and ginger, usually no cornstarch, the best organic chicken I can find. Its also a nice dinner for guests, and we serve it over black wild rice which stands up to it well. I typically make a bunch and freeze some, it freezes well. Give it a try, I don't think you'll be sorry.

My family loves when I make this one, I have served it three times. this last time I added wide slices of white onion and mushrooms and they did well. I love ginger and garlic so I add a little extra of each! This also goes great with sauteed bok choy, green beans, or asparagus!!! Yum!

Added Green bell pepper and celery. Thought it was delicious and easy to make, especially since I'm not big on stir fry. Loved it and will make it again.

This was the first time in a while that I have made a stir fry. I found that this was an easy receipt to make and was flavorful, although I feel that less ginger is needed as it seemed to over power the dish.

So easy and colorfull!! loved the simple but spicy flavours. An instant favourite!!

Very good with a few changes, and additions. Used peanut oil to saute. My veggies included diced mixed peppers, celery, carrots, and white onion. Sauce needed sherry wine. Stir-fried the veggies first then removed to bowl, then added pepper flakes, garlic, ginger & chicken. Add sauce & cook the chicken through then add back the veggies & scallions. Drizzle with sesame oil after removing from heat.

This is a great quick stir-fry recipe. I have made it a dozen times, using what extra vegis I have on hand. Vegi broth or water can be substituted for chicken broth, as the soy sauce is salty enough. The cashews are a must!

I can't figure out where I went wrong here. I followed the recipe exactly and I ended up with something more akin to soup than stir fry. It tasted fine but it was definitely a liquid, not a solid. We weren't impressed.

Rating: 3
Nothing wrong with this recipe! My red-pepper flakes always seem to be extremely potent, so I doubt that my few shakes added up to the 1/4 tsp. called for, but the resulting heat was just the way we like it. I will definitely put this into our meal rotation!

Its OK. Easy but just OK. You have to work with it to get great flavor.

very tasty and colourful and easy to make. We added 1T of whiskey at the end (with the chicken) as per many other chicken and cashew recipes.

Rating: 4
Overall, an excellent recipe, even from a Chinese perspective. Some suggested tweaks has more to do w/ the approach of cooking this dish. Start w/ garlic into that wok before cooking the chicken. Do the same w/ the vegetables as well. Let that garlic cook a little (it should be a little golden brown) before putting any of those ingredients in. Feel free to mix it up w/ any vegetables - celery, onions, etc. And don't chop the ginger, use a grater. Much better ginger flavor.

Simply delicious! I took other reviewers comments into consideration. I added 2 cups diced zucchini, 1 cup of sliced cremini mushrooms and 1 can of sliced water chestnuts. THE KEY: I added 2 TBL Hoisin sauce and a little extra red pepper flakes. Served this with steamed jasmine...my kids were licking their bowls.:-)

This is no great shakes. I've made it twice now - once with the nuts and once without. It's clearly got a lot of potential, but as written, it's nothing extraordinary.

This was good! The family really enjoyed, even the kids who normally don't like a stir fry. I used boneless chicken and added mushrooms. Will definately make again.

This dish is super delish. The only thing I changed was I used boneless skinless chicken breast and used spray butter to cook everything. I served it with brown rice. Low cal dinner that was super yummy.

This is a wonderful recipe. I was hesitant to try it, as I haven't done well with stir-frys before. But this one was really easy, and my husband just loved it. Next time I'd make more sauce, and add mushrooms.

I've tried several online chicken & cashew recipe's and this is by far the best. I like to substitute carrots for the bell pepper. I also add a bit of chopped onion and stir-fry them just before adding the chicken.

My husband and I thought this was very nice. It's a really flexible recipe: I made as written, but you could easily sub in beef or tofu or broccoli. The sauce came out nice too. Will make it again.

This was a great recipe, namely because it is so easy and uses common ingredients that are often on hand. I actually doubled the sauce and increased the amount and type of vegetables used. So versatile. This will definitely be a staple in our house.

This recipe was really easy and delicious. Added asparagus and twice the amount of cashews. Would make again.

Tried this last night and with a couple additions, loved it! Added onions and straw mushrooms and used Splenda (instead of sugar) and Arrowroot (in place of cornstartch due to allergies to corn) and increased to 3/4 C of cashews. Wasn't quite as fast in prep as I had hoped, but well worth it. Made my husband VERY happy! Would have added more red-pepper flakes but wasn't sure how hot it would be so we added hot chili sauce instead! Will make this again and again, thanks!

Wonderful flavors, easy, added water chestnuts for additional crunch. The bit of zing from the pepper flakes was yummy. Everyone LOVED it, even a formerly "fussy" eater. Used breasts instead of thighs, worked great.

Very good but...would take the chicken and after cutting it put it in a bowl and add soy sauce and cornstarch to mix into a thick paste..then let sit for a few minutes 15 if you have it...it will be moist and taste so good

I've made this several times so far- it is delicious and fast and flavorful. The chicken thighs stay moist and tender. I always add a ton of ginger for more of a kick, and I serve with brown rice. A fairly healthy alternative to Chinese takeout, and all the ingredients are easily on hand. Will make again.

I just made this last night. It was a success. I did add snow peas at others suggestion. I also grated the ginger to break it up a bit. The whole family.... husband, kids & a family friend who went to culinary school all loved it. Definitely will keep this recipe & make again! I served it with sticky rice. Delicious.

An excellent recipe, with an incredibly great taste. I say it's incredible because it's so easy to make! You can make this dish in 30 minutes, including the tame it takes to chop everything. And it's spicy flavor is something you really don't want to miss.

Reading the recipe, I thought this would be a riff on Kung Pao, but the flavors were different. Fast to make and pretty good. Not as good as my favorite Kung Pao recipe. Would recommend holding the ginger and garlic back from step 2 and throwing them in right before the sauce ingredients--they began to burn when I made the recipe as written.

So easy! I didn't have the bell pepper or regular cashews, so I used what I had on hand - bok choy and trader joe's salt and pepper cashews over brown rice - a good bit of spice and so good. Even my kids loved it!

Just OK--nothing new or particularly exciting here. There must be more interesting stir-fries on this site.

This is a simple, easy and delicious dish. I made a few small changes: I followed other reviewers' recommendations to add snowpeas and to use sesame oil instead of vegetable oil. I also used chicken breasts instead of thighs. A highly recommended meal!

This recipe rocks! I even made substitutes and it turned out wonderfully. I didn't have any scallions so I used regular chopped white onions. It didn't compromise the taste but the color (added green) would have been more stunning. And I had roasted peanuts rather than cashews on hand. It tastes a little like Kung Pao Chicken of which I am a huge fan!

Easy prep, very tasty. I was cooking for my Dad who is watching his salt intake, so I used reduced-sodium soy sauce, and toasted some raw cashews rather than using the salted variety. The toasted nuts added another layer of flavor, and between the broth and soy sauce, the dish had plenty of salt to bring out the other flavors.
