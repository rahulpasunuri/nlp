I used this combination of flavours with Cornish hens for a New Year's Eve dinner. The red currant jelly glazed the hens beautifully and the sauce was wonderful. I just deglazed the roasting pan with the jelly and added chopped sage, then reduced a little - didn't need to thicken with cornstarch.

We have been making this for three years now and it's always great, especially the gravy it makes. Brining the turkey first also gives it that added salt to contrast with the sweet jelly. The other thing we've done the last two years is stuff the turkey with two oranges. The meat near the bone is wonderfully flavorful and citrusy (we then squeeze the oranges and use the juice when we cook down the bones for soup)

This is a simple recipe and the red currant glaze produces a gloriously browned bird. This has been a hit for the past 3 thanksgivings in a row.

I prepared this dish for my extended family Thanksgiving 1999. The flavor of the currant glaze on the turkey and in the gravy paired well with the '93 Sonoma Valley Joseph Swan Estate Pinot that we served. Several guests asked for the recipe ,which is the best recommendation I can give for a dish. I cooked the bird with sprigs of herbs in the cavity, which added a delicious finish to the meat. I later made stock from the carcass with all of the herbs and currant in the pot. It was magnificent.
