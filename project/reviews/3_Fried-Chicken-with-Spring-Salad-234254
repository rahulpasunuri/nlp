Obviously you missed the Epicurious 'boiled water recipe' saga a couple of years ago. I think you're being very harsh - a) it is the simple recipes cooked perfectly that truly define a 'great cook' and b) preparing artichokes is not that simple ... so I for one was pleased for the advice. BTW - great recipe, good balance. Cook as instructed!

Hey now. Be nice. Obviously your arrogance has made you think that you need no assistance. There are other people in this world other than you over there. Humility friend.
