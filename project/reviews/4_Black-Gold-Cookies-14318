These are delicious cookies. They taste like brownie cookies and are similar to the Chocolate Whopper cookies in Maida Heatter's wonderful cookbooks. I used to make them for my cookie business a few years ago. Everyone loved them!

Delicious cookies! I agree with other reviewers that these are too rich to make in the 1/2 cup size. I used an ice cream scooper that was around 1/4 cup and they baked for only 15 mins. The batter seems strange, but they are wonderfully gooey and chunky! Love the espresso taste with them.

This was a STRANGE! recipe and I had my doubts as I was making it. I must say it turned out great!! Could not find espresso powder and next time I will add more instant coffee like the other reviewer. Could not really discern coffee flavor with one tbls. This is a keeper for Christmas Cookies!

I omitted the nuts, reduced the semisweet chips to 9 oz. and replaced it with 1 pack of Andes mints, which I melted into the butter and unsweetened chocolate mixture. I topped each cookie with a mint after baking. YUMMY! Also, I did not make them near so large, but you have to add quite a bit more flour to prevent the cookies from coming out too flat. More espresso powder wouldn't hurt either.

I first tasted these cookies at Upper Crust Bakery in Austin. They've remained my favorite for years. They're rich and delicious. One cookie is too large to eat in one sitting--so make them smaller, savor a large one over a few days, or share one with a friend or two.

I was so excited when I heard Gourmet had published this recipe! These are my all-time favorite cookies, and I'd been trying to talk Upper Crust out of the recipe for years; but they wouldn't give in even though I was "a regular." Although it's been a decade since the publication, and I'll bet it's still a favorite with your readers!

These taste like a good brownie, rather than a cookie. In fact, they taste almost exactly like my favorite chocolate walnut brownie box mix, just heaped into a GIGANTIC pile on a cookie sheet. The 1/2 cup size is way too big. 1/4 cup would be more than enough. Sure, they taste good, but it would be tough to make something out of almost solid chocolate and nuts that didn't. A bit disappointing.

These are the best cookies EVER! I made the smaller version too because 1/4 cup is ridiculous and these cookies are too rich to eat 1/4 cup. Please note, if you're going to make them and you can't find espresso powder, use instant coffee NOT GROUND ESPRESSO!!! They are not the same thing AT ALL. I can only think that all of the bad reviews of this cookie are a result of this mistake. Using ground espresso instead of instant would be akin to trying to make instant coffee by throwing some grounds in your coffee cup, adding hot water and drinking it.

I would give this 4 forks, except that it's a cookie, and I can't quite conceive of a cookie as being a dish beyond compare. But these are truely scumptious. We made the smaller-sized version, using a heaping tablespoon, and they stayed round and thick, ie didn't melt all over the pan as many chocolate chip cookies do. Also made them non-dairy. Will definitely make again, though only when lotsa company's about, because otherwise I eat too many.

Love it, love it, love it! I've made this are single, double and even quadruple batches without a problem. Fabulous cookies, rich as all get out, but GREAT! Toast the nuts for extra flavor.

Rating: 4
Lands' sake this is a damn good cookie. Not for the faint of heart, obviously - just look at the amount of chocolate required. But it's so worth the effort and expense - chocolatey but not too sweet, a brownie-like consistency that is just heavenly - there's really nothing bad to say about these babies. I made mine much smaller - they are way too rich for the larger size, but if you can handle it, more power to you :)

I could not find espresso powder at my local grocery (aka SuperWalMart) and didn't have time to go looking all over town, so I used instant coffee and tripled the amount to three tablespoons. The cookies were superb and got rave reviews by my fellow Kinder teachers, all die-hard chocoholics. If I ever come across espresso powder, I'll be sure to try it in the recipe to see the difference. I am sure there is one (a difference, that is), but in my opinion instant coffee makes a good substitute in this recipe.

These cookies are awesome. My husband works for a pretty big firm here in Manhattan, and they have a dessert bake-off every year. I won 3rd place w/this recipe...pretty good considering that New Yorkers have been exposed to a lot of delicious food and desserts. I would agree with the other rater, to go with more espresso and make sure it's well distributed. Some of the cookies seemed to not have enough of the espresso flavor while others were fine. Also, make sure to chop the walnuts really well. I bought pre-chopped walnuts that were too big and gave too much of a nutty flavor. That being said, these cookies are delicious!

I have been making these cookies since the recipe came out in Gourmet in '96, and people say they are the best cookie they've ever eaten. I even have to bake 2 batches to take to seven different friends in Turkey each time I go. I make MUCH smaller cookies, a heaping tablespoon-sized which makes about 36 - 2 1/2" cookies. Bake about 19-20 min. If your raw dough is a little cooler, or starts to set, the cookies retain their height and won't spread out flat. I also sometimes add different kinds of choc. chips, like white or milk chocolate. Also, using better chocolate (than Hershey's) makes a better cookie. And, using Ghiradelli chips for example, instead of a bar, for your semi-sweet chocolate, is less expensive.

These had a deep,rich taste, but they are extremely unattractive cookies. I felt they spread out too thin. I was expecting so much more... Don't bake for the full 25 minutes- my first batch was too dry & fragile...

You can trust the reviews. This cookie is as good as they say. I made this cookie (and Mocha Molly's Molasses Cookies) for last nights Valentine's dinner, and guests couldn't stop raving. Be sure to slightly toast the nuts.

These cookies are amazing! I rate these best of all! Even since I am from dalas Tx, I love chocolate! I moved. So I looked at recipes I found chocolate cookies, They were too hard! But I saw an Interview of Black Golds, so I tried it! They are sooo good!!!

Great cookies and easy to make! I used a 1/3 cup scoop and made 18 cookies from the recipe. They kept well, and were even better the next few days.

I've made this recipe every christmas for the last four years and every year since the first, people start asking about it. It's the only thing i make that people ask me for the recipe. The only thing i change is this: the cookies in the recipe are way too big, even for the biggest chocoholics. So i roll the "dough" into small balls (about 1-1/2 inch in diameter) and make a smaller cookies that bakes for 15 minutes or so, depending on your oven.

YUM!!! The best chocolate cookie recipe I've run across in a long time. Rich and fabulous. I couldn't find espresso powder, so I just used a very heaping tbsp of instant coffee crystals, and the taste was exactly right. They're huge, like the kind you'd find in a bakery, and would make nice party favors (especially if they were decoratively wrapped and put at each person's place setting, etc.). I'll be including these in my holiday baking from now on!

For all the chocolate I had to put in I thought these would be richer - ok but not nearly as decadent as I thought they would be. I think adding more espresso would do the trick.

Rating: 3
Not reading the recipe carefully I melted all of the chocolate accidentally so I decided to do two batches, and even though I forgot to add another stick of butter they turned out pretty good. I still think the Chocolate Brownie Cookies on this site are the best chocolate cookie you can find.

I have been making these cookies since the issue of Gourmet came out. They get nothing less than raves and swoons when people eat them. The recipe is easily adaptable - less coffee, no nuts/more chocolate, etc. These have become a Christmas standard at our house.

These cookies were a hit with my youth group -- though even a bunch of teen-age boys thought they were too rich to eat more than a few of them. I would definitely make them again, however I did notice that either my oven is wrong or the cooking time is -- those I cooked for the stated time came out being more like brownies, and didn't hold the cookie shape very well. I left in the next batch for about ten minutes longer, and they turned out perfectly.

I couldn't find any instant espresso powder, so I just omitted, and they turned out fine. They were a big hit, but a few of us thought it was too rich and too much like a brownie. Next time I will make them 1/4 like the other reviewers.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! I had to bake from scratch with 3 oz. of unsweetened chocolate and 9 oz. of semisweet, also reduced the size of the cookie and baked on parchment paper

Very good cookie. I found them a little tricky to safely remove from the cookie sheet. On the second batch, I lined the cookie sheets with parchment paper. Much easier.

I made these for visiting relatives over the weekend, and although everyone thought they were great, I will definitely tweak the recipe a little bit next time. I think the batter needs a tablespoon or two more sugar. Also, the salt was a little too prominent, so I'd probably cut it down to 1/2 tsp. Overall, it's a great recipe that would be just incredible with minor adjustments.

This is the BEST cookie. I too used 1/4 cup scoops, I don't think I could eat a bigger cookie, it is just too rich. I plan on making this my trademark cookie.

These cookies are yummy! A splurge kind of cookie. I made the to complement an assortment of cookies for a brunch and they were a huge hit. I doubled the recipe and they still came out great. I baked them for 20 minutes instead of 25 and the texture was perfect- I feellike they would have been overdone.

I cut this recipe in thirds and got 8 very big, thick cookies using a 1/4 cup measure. I think that was just right. I used instant expresso and think that the coffee helped the cookies from being overly sweet. I thought they were easy to prepare and were a real hit with chocolate lovers I know.

My goodness. I had no idea about the calorie and fat content. Setting that aside for the moment... these are some of the most wonderful cookies EVER. Whenever I make them people just cannot get enough. All in all, they are a perfectly hedonistic delight.

These cookies were O.K., but difficult to make. Just melting all the chocolate was a chore! The cookies also turned out very dry and more fragile than I had originally thought they would (I send cookies overseas to my boyfriend in the Army, so this is a main concern!). I used espresso grounds, as I couldn't find anything labelled "espresso powder". While my boyfriend and his buddies liked them well enough, but I can't stand espresso, so these cookies tasted as if they were burned to me. I wouldn't bother making these again!

Oh my! Perfect chocolate cookie! Had different chocolates left from x-mas so made the dough with unsweetened and a mix of half milk and half bittersweet, then put semi-sweet chips in the dough. Also used 1/4 cup to make them and that was just the right size. That size bakes in about 16min. Can't imagine making any other kind of choc. cookie again.

I tried out this recipe to use a cookie to send out for Christmas. They disappeared in a day. Denfinately a hit. I do however suggest making the cookies smaller then what is suggested in the recipe. They are wonderful.

I reduced the size of these cookies to about 1 1/2 inches, baking at the same temperature for less time (around 10-12 min, but my oven temp is inconsistant). I ended up with 46 cookies and was glad I did when I figured up the fat and calories. Maybe we should rename them black gold fat-bombs! Check this out: at 12 cookies per batch, each has 615 calories and 106 grams fat (more than 1 qt. premium ice cream!) At 46 smaller cookies, each has a more reasonable 160 calories and 27 grams fat They were really good. I will cntinue to make them small and serve them in situations where people will not be likely to eat many of them, because there are equally delicious sweets that are not nearly this unhealthy (yeah, I know, we don't make cookies as health foods, but these just go off the charts)

This was a great recipe. I personally found the espresso a little overwhelming, but as I don't drink coffee, I'm likely just not used to it. Reducing it to 1/2 Tablespoon next time would warrant even better cookies. Perfect for chocolate lovers.

The cookies were not as sweet as I thought they would be. I think the next time I will try to add some more sugar. They were real good any way I like anything that has that much nuts held together with a lot of chocolate!!!

OK I did not make these cookies but I gave the recipe to my friend who made them cause she is always looking for something different in cookies,These were absolutley fab-Iloved the subtle coffee flavor. She can make them anytime for me!

These were great; they were very rich, but not too sweet. I substituted finely ground coffee beans for the espresso powder and it seemed to work well. When I make these again, I will make them smaller, because they are almost too rich to eat a whole cookie. I tried a slightly smaller one, and as long as you reduce the cooking time, it turns out fine. I also suggest waiting until the cookies are mostly cool to handle them. The first one that I tried to take off the baking sheet totally fell apart!

I have made these cookies several times and they have become better known as my "Killer Cookies." I have substituted super-finely ground espresso beans for the powder for a more enhanced coffee flavor. Outstanding when served with dark-roast coffee. One of the few cookies I know of that can stand on their own as dessert.
