Easy to make...light and crispy...powdered sugar was unavailable and cookies were delicious without!!! Great treat, fun to make and not too heavy a desert

There is a problem with the recipe when so many cooks have the exact same problem! Followed the directions implicitly (very easy) and could not get the cookies off the paper! Extremely frustrating-a waste of time and ingredients as everything ended up in the trash! Don't try this recipe.

My 6th grade niece and I made this today. Very good but we had problems with stickiness even with the parchment paper. It worked best with a very light coat of canola oil spray on the parchment paper, and then we let the cookies sit for a few minutes after removing them from the oven - removing them immediately was a mess. Fun to make the names of other family members!

The stickiness reported by the cooks below is probably why the recipe recommends parchment paper or a non-stick baking mat.

treid this receipe with the previous reviewer problems in mind. I did not use parchment. I tried on an ungreased cookie sheet. impossible to get off. with crisco, tasted disgusting (like using olive oil in baking). and once I buttered the baking sheet, that worked when hot out of the oven. the tasted wonderful, but needs some refining on how to get them off leaving the ABC's intact.

These were fun to make (my 4-year-old daughter loved squeezing out shapes), but the fact that these cookies were just about impossible to remove from the baking sheet makes them too frustrating to try again.
