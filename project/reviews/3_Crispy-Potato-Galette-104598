This is a very good recipe for a special occasion breakfast. It was simple and well written. Very crispy with a creamy center. We put scrambled eggs on top to serve. I didn't have Russets so I used a Yukon Gold and had no trouble with it turning brown or gray. The trick is to grate very quickly.

This is just a gussied up hashbrown, really. The trick here is to squeeze the water from the potatos, integrial step. Then make sure you are using a nonreactive pan to fry in. It should be hot enough to sizzel upon entry. Also, you might want to try an egg white mixed with the potato. It gives status to the bits and helps hold it together! Good luck - we love ours (w/bacon&onions)

I first made this several years ago while living in France and it has since become a family favorite. I have never had any issues with discoloration (though I have never tried making it ahead of time and reheating it either). I always wring the potatoes out REALLY well rinsing them with cold water once during the process which may help to ensure they are crispy. I've used both a nonstick pan and a cast iron. Both have worked well.

A little bit tricky. I shredded half the potatoes and put in the pan with boursin, cooked about 10 minutes over moderate heat. While cooking I shredded the other half with food processor and placed on the top. This way I seemed to avoid the discoloration of the potatoes. It slid out of the pan easily on the first side. I was not using a nonstick pan just a well-seasoned anodized aluminum. The second side did stick a bit, but I think if I had washed the pan out before cooking the second side it would have worked better. Great flavor, both adults and kids loved it.

Crispy outside, lovely inside, an absolute delight. Will absolutely make again and again. (I made this with some trepidation after reading other reviews. I used a cast iron skillet, very hot. Wonder if that made the difference?)

Very easy recipe. We used the food processor to grate the potatoes. The entire thing was gone, everyone loved it. The only complaint I have is that the potatoes turned a strange black color after they were cooked, maybe because I kept it warm in the oven?

Potatoes were slightly undercooked and a gray tinge on inside of galette, while crispy and done on the outside. Took much longer to cook than described here. Perhaps it was too thick, or my heat too low, but will definitely not be making again.

I made the Roast Chicken, but I needed everything else to go quick. I used hash browns in a bag found in diary dept. Make sure the cheese is warmed to spead easy. I used olive oil with a clove of garlic lightly sauted and removed prior to adding potatoes. I love this. Made for a brunch, big hit.

If you are making this ahead, and don't want your galette to go black (see reviews, below) there are a couple of alternative methods. One is to use a sheet of baker's parchment between the galette and the pan. Another is to put the galette on a pizza stone instead of a pan. I find that parboiling the potatoes makes them easier to work with and less inclined to stick like barnacles to the pan.

I don't know what I did wrong. The potato just stuck to the pan, so I turned it out, washed the pan, tried again, same thing. Gave up and am trying to make sort of a scramble out of them now. Hope they taste good cause they sure don't look it. I'm sorry I didn't make latkes instead.

I made this with my own cream cheese and herb mix and it turned out fabulous! Nice and crunchy on the outside, oozing with yummy flavor in the middle. This recipe is a keeper for sure!

I have made this so many times, and all to rave reviews. It is easy and very tasty. You can sub. any herbed type goat cheese or spread. My husband loves when I make it

I thought this was very tasty, but it did not come out as crisp as I would have liked. In fact, it was on the mushy side. I squeezed the moisture out of the potato in batches and really thought I had it down, but... I would not make this again.d

I set mine on an aluminum pan and it also turned black. It tasted fine but the color was unappetizing. I turned the lights down when my guests sat down for dinner.

Tried this and it was delightful - easy to make and very tasty. Couldn't find Boursin, so I concocted something similar out of cream cheese, butter, sour cream, garlic, and herbs, and let it chill overnight. I didn't have a rimless cookie sheet, so I just turned a regular one over and used the bottom, which worked fine. Judy - grated potatoes will naturally turn pinkish in just a few minutes as they begin to oxidize. It may not have been your towel after all.

It came out wonderful--but (heh heh) be sure not to use a colored dishcloth to wring out the potatoes. Mine turned a not-unattractive shade of pink.

This is delicious, and I will make it again. However, what I won't do is what the recipe suggests: "Can be made 2 hours ahead. Turn out onto baking sheet. Let stand at room temperature. Rewarm on sheet in 350°F oven until crisp, about 15 minutes." I followed these instructions, with the the galette on an aluminum baking sheet. It turned BLACK. While it still tasted fine, I was rather appalled at how it looked.

This was really delicious. If your correspondent can find this in his local McDonald's, he is extremely lucky. We had a wonderful potato galette on a recent cruise and our 10 year old grand-daughter thought it was terrific, so I've wanted to make something similar myself. I turned to my old "Potato Potpourri" (not sure, but maybe by James Beard?) from the January 1968 Gourmet, and thought about the Shredded Potato Cake recipe which I've made so many times, but this recipe outdoes even that. Thank you again.

I made this after returning from France, craving the food I ate when I was there. I shamelessly love Boursin, so I used way more than this recipe calls for. I thought these were very, very good--what could be bad about fried-up potatoes and Boursin cheese?

I've been making this recipe since I first found it 6 months ago. It is great as written but lends itself to "tweaking." Almost any cheese and any pungent vegi work well. Crispy outside and smooth inside. Very easy and quick. I press the shredded potates between paper towels (about one potato between sheets) and then go over the whole thing with my roller. It babysits itself well and frees you up to do other things while it cooks. I have re-heated left overs and wasn't very impressed. Not very fancy unless dressed up with some sour cream or the like and a few chive sprigs.

I had this Galette tonight with a roast chicken, and it was great. I was a little nervous about the flipping etc., but it was no problem in a non stick pan. Crispy on the outside, cheesy in the center, I would certainly make this again. The only alternation I would make is to use less oil. I found I didn't need all of it if using a good non stick pan.

USE A NON-STICK PAN!!!!!! The only non-stick pan I had was a Wok so I used a regular Frying pan!! I had to use waaaaaaay to much oil to prevent burning but despite that this dish was absoulutely terrific. Goes great with the Roast Chicken with Herb Butter Onions and Garlic.

This dish was pretty good, but not what I expected. I think a thin layer of ham would add a bit more zip to it . . . I'll try that next time.

Having lived in Paris this reminded me of the wonderful Bistro cooking I use to love. This is an easy, tasty and wonderful recipe. Yes, I will make it often.

I was skeptical about making this galette after the mixed reviews, but I'm so glad I did. It was crispy with a creamy filling, and not greasy at all. I used a non-stick skillet with no oil, and a mixture of cream cheese and feta. My husband gobbled it up and begged me to make it again.

This was a simple dish to make. The only change I made was to grate the potatoes and soak them in cold water before wringing the heck out of them.

Wonderful--this would do well alone with a green salad and a white wine. I used the boursin cheese. McDonald's?? what???

It's just a fancy hash brown, give me McDonald's instead.

This potato galette was simple to prepare and following the directions, it turned out fine. I used grated havarti cheese that I had added some of the extra chopped fresh herbs to and I'd say any cheese could be put in the middle and I'd be more generous with herbs next time and follow the suggestion of heating up at a higher temperature. Everyone loved it anyway!

I followed the recipe exactly, but my galette turned out greasy with a strange flavor from the Boursin cheese (and I love Boursin cheese). We threw the whole thing away. What a disappointment.

I'm not sure what went wrong tonight, but this turned out to be a big flop. I found that the potatoes turned brown almost immediately after grating them. I added exactly what the recipe called for and the finished product was too greasy. They didn't get crispy either. It just must be me, because others had rave reviews of this. Oh well....

This recipe was delicious and so easy to prepare. I prepared it 30 min ahead of time and just kept it warm on the stove. It was crispy on the outside and the shredded potatos with boursin made it creamy on the inside. I used garlic and herb boursin which gave it a nice flavor.

This was absolutely wonderful. It's got great flavor and texture, and it's a snap to prepare (provided you've got a mandoline for grating the potatoes). I used reduced-fat Boursin cheese flavored with herbs and garlic. I didn't think it lacked flavor at all; in fact, I omitted the green onions and it still tasted great. It looks exactly like something you'd get in a Parisian bistro or brasserie - very pretty and yet homey at the same time. I'll definitely make this again.

Well, the others warned that this wasn't as good as expected. I disagree! It was the perfect dish with the roasted chicken. I did make it ahead and reheated it. Thanks to an earlier review, the oven was perfect at 425*. It was very simple, and everyone loved it!

Unlike previous reviewers, my problem was not a lack of taste. That said, I added a nice pinch of salt, pepper and thyme between the two layers of potatoes, and I used grated gruyere cheese. Flavors were wonderful. My problem was with the crispness. I made mine an hour ahead, as I was entertaining, and a 350* oven did not crisp it back up. Next time I'll try a 425* oven instead.

I have to agree with the last reviewer. It was basically bland hash browns. The cheese wasn't strong enough for the flavor to come through. I used double the green onions and it still lacked flavor. I'm not sure what would zip it up.

I'm not sure why I didn't like this recipe more as I love potatoes, scallions & Boursin cheese. It was very easy, if a bit messy, to put together & didn't take long to make. I used my 8" cast-iron skillet & the galette slid out fairly well with a few prods. I guess it just tasted a little flat & uninspiring to me

Essentially, this recipe was hash browns with a rich creamy filling. It was very tasty.
