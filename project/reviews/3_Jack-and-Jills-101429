This is like one step up from junk food! I cannot believe this is on Epicurious. While I did eat sloppy joes and hamburgers on occasion as a kid, I just don't think I would serve this up to a child. I grew up with wholesome ingredients and complete meals. This is like teaching your child to have a pallet for over-done, caloric ladden convenience foods, which is what too many parents slip into these days. People who defend this recipe for kid's sake are insane. Kids don't need rich foods packed with calories. Keep it simple.

My kids, and their friends, thought this was great. We served it for our son's birthday party (got tired of ordering pizzas). It is exactly what kids like to eat, and the grownups ending up trying it too. Sometimes the joy of cooking is making others happy!

I believe those that are objecting to the ingredients in the recipes from the cookbook (there are a few more on this site) have forgotten that Mom's used the ingredients that they had on hand. And American cheese is what most of them had. When I want something "just like Mom used to make", I go back to the old simple ingredients. To this day, I cannot eat a hot dog or sausage with anything except French's plain old mustard. Dijon just does not taste the same. :) But I love it for today's recipes!

My mother always warned me about people who go use all three of their names to be identified. David Clint Watson (Lee Harvey Oswald?). It's elementary my dear Watson! or perhaps that is where you should go back to.... Elementary school.

A very filling meal. Used red pepper in place of green because I like it better. Also used provolone cheese and a bit of fresh basil (overload from the garden). Be careful with the tomato sauce or this could become spaghetti sauce on a bun. I added sauce a bit at a time (didn't use all), and kept ground beef in about 1-2" chunks. Served with a nice green salad (with Jersey tomatoes, of course). Very easy meal, especially for a week night or lazy day.

Give me a break, Mr. Watson. There are still many of us who would pass up the Grey Poupon for French's yellow anyday. Although I can be a great cook, most nights I'd sacrifice gourmet taste for ease of preparation and time saved. (The exception would be if I'm having company, for whom I wouldn't make a "Sloppy Joe" anyways). My kids love the simple version of this recipe, and although I am sure your snobbed up gourmet version is very delicious, most kids probably wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole.

I know Mr. Watson and he is by no means a cook. we spent the same year in the Culinary Institute and he was always doing this type of things to recipes. If you see his name in a reveiw, I can assure you, disregard.

I didn't make this but had to comment on Mr. Watson's review. I think he just missed the point, an easy yummy recipe. All the work involved in his "revised" recipe is ridiculous for a simple good sandwich meal.

This recipe is flavorful and satisfies all. It allows for a lot of variation, which is good, because otherwise it is a bit boring. I added garlic, basil, and barbeque sauce (I didn't have enough tomato sauce) to the meat, and used provolone cheese. It turned out well.

This dish was very good...reminded me of being a kid as well! I must counter David Watson's comment about American Cheese...while presliced/wrapped american cheese is a rubbery mess, I love american cheese from a deli...ie; Land O'Lakes.

As I kept reading through this recipe, I was thinking, bland, bland, and more bland. #1: American cheese is about as exciting and exotic as American cars. Here's the new recipe: Slice hoagie roll in half, butter the cut side and fry in teflon pan butter side down till light brown. Set aside. Spread thin layer of Dijonaisse on bread. Brown hamburger and drain. Slice onions as thin as possible and saute them in butter and sugar till the onions are candied. Set aside. Skewer the red, yellow, or green bell peppers (all three for the most eye appeal) and roast over a flame till skin is charred completely. Place peppers in a paper bag allowing them to "sweat". Peel skins and slice longways. Slice tomatos and line the bottom of a small greased pan. Top with shredded cheese mixture of: swiss, provalone, and mozzerella. Broil till cheese melts. Now for the assembly: bread topped with meat, then peppers, then onions, then tomatos and cheese, then bread again. Serve with baby sweet pickles.
