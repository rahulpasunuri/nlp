Yellow foot mushrooms were on sale, and so was rib eye steak, so I looked this recipe up. I was a bit worried about rosemary and vinegar overpowering the mushrooms and meat, but I chopped up just a small sprig of fresh rosemary and it was good. I added shallots and a dash of white wine to the mushrooms. I poured off the mushroom liquid to use instead of beef broth, and also used a splash of red wine to deglaze the steak pan. I needed more than 3 minutes per side to get it past raw-rare. I made this just for my DH and me, along with a potato and steamed kale with lemon. The touch of balsamic made the sauce very rich, not vinegary. There was only a spoonful each, though, so sad. I'll certainly make this again.

Maybe I'm just not a fan of Rosemary, but I thought it was overpowering and uncomplimentary to the beef. If I did make it again, it would be definitely be without the rosemary!

Great recipe. It was all so tasty that we were picking the last tiny pieces off our plates hoping for more. The sauce was so tasty that we were dipping anything we could find into it. I used fresh Italian brown (Crimini) mushrooms sliced. Otherwise made the recipe exactly as written.

As the previous reviewer mentioned, you have to doctor the mushrooms up a little. I added a little garlic and played around with the sauce (which is what makes the dish). There's nothing really new in this recipe, which reminds us that sometimes the basics are the best.

I would definitely use this recipe again!!! My husband loved it! I twisted the recipe a little to match our taste. Instead of rubbing rosemary and peppercorn, I used ROSEMARY, GARLIC POWDER, BLACK PEPPER AND SALT. This will add more flavor to the steak. Also rub minced garlic to enhance the flavor, if you really like the taste of garlic. I used balsamic vinegar and it was so flavorful. Also, I didn't just saute the steak, I broiled it in the oven for 350 degrees for 15 minutes each side. It is so flavorful! Love it with red wine!!! (preferably Black Swan Cabernet Sauvignon 2004 from Australia)

My husband made this tonight and it was delicious, although the beef broth got left out inadvertently. The proportions, as other reviewers have pointed out, are off. One 3/4 lb. steak is plenty for two, and a scant inch of thickness still allows for a nice medium rare steak.

WOW! one 16-ounce rib eye per person?? 10 ounces of mushroom for 2? This recipe is just okay. It is basically a steak topped with mushrooms and a lackluster, thin, skimpy sauce. As for the preparation, searing 2 minutes per side on high is not nearly enough even for rare - this is supposed to be an 1 1/2" thick.

It was lovely. I only had large button mushrooms and since it's spring I used fresh rosemary. the flavors were wonderful. We had steamed leeks with dijon vinegrette and string beans with sun dried tomatoes. I would use this for company.

Too rich-the strong pepper flavor added with the sting of rosemary is overpowering (and i'm a huge fan of rosemary) - to use these flavors for this expensive, very rich cut of beef is too much. If i were to spend the money and time i would just stick to steak au poivre- or use these flavors for a less rich piece of meat (like filet)

This was an excellent recipe! The mushroom saute was so good that next time I will make more of it. Had it with the garlic and rosemary crusted potatoes and green beans with bacon and shallots. Great fall dinner! Will definetely make this one again!

The flavor of the sauce was fabulous! Definately make extra sauce. I added a little port to it and it turned out great. I reccomend the "Resteraunt Style Onion Rings" .My husband just could not get enough!

We used porterhouse steaks with this recipe and it turned out very nicely.

The mushroom were delicious and the sauce was very tasty. The vinegar adds a nice kick. I used 3/4" thick steaks which ended up more well done than I like, but it was still very good. Really didn't take too much effort and could be done on a week night. I served with fresh asparagus and rosemary sliced baked potatoes - Yum!

Wonderfull flavor, it makes it a very rich meal.I would definatly make it for company. This is not the way you would want steak all the time but great for a romantic or small dinner party.
