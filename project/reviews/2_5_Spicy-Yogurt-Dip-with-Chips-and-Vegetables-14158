A definite miss. It's not terrible, it's just very very weird. The shallots were the best part. I will not be making it again.

I'm shocked by all the bad reviews. This dip is amazing and my guests actually request it. I have made it for Thanksgiving several times.

I was curious about this dish because I was looking for a healthy dip. I saw that the reviews for this recipe were polarized, but thought it might be what one reviewer said, that people who like Indian spicy foods would like it. I love Indian spices, had all of the spices called for in this recipe in my cabinet, and couldn't stand this recipe! I didn't even offer my husband a taste of it.

I'm so glad I tried this dip. I think it should be named Indian Spicy Yogurt Dip and then people who don't like that type of flavor can avoid this recipe. I was leary at first when I added the coriander seed, because it's so fragrant, but it mellows when incorporated and heated with the other ingredients. This dip has a complex layer of flavors and it's making me drool just thinking of it. It tasted especially good with raw cauliflower, broccoli, and wedges of green cabbage (carrots don't work). For a party I think I'll try baby bok choy too and keep everything green and white in the cabbage family. I'm craving it already!

This is a horrible recipe, I can't figure out why all of these unnecessary ingredients are in here. Less would have been better.

I was surprised at a previous review of this, because I have been making it for a few years now, and everyone who tastes it loves it. In fact, I had one friend stand at my counter eating it non-stop one day. I usually don't bother with the shallots, but it is definitely high on my list of lowfat, flavorful dips.

Despite the high cost of buying all of the ingredients, this was the most disgusting thing I ever served. I was embarassed to have it in my house, and my guests nearly got sick to their stomachs.

Unusual and delicious. The few steps are well worth the taste! Would be great with lamb or chicken.
