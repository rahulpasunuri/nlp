This was a big hit. My only suggestion would be to use the herbs you enjoy the most. Basil was not the best compliment to the flavorful cheese. I will make it again using sage, parsley and thyme. I think this will make a much more pleasing flavor. Basil was just too sweet. Also, this gets very thick. Cut back on cornstarch for a much more "dipping friendly" consistency.

I first made this recipe in 2001 for my first dinner date for my now husband. It's increadible and a delight every time we make it! (By the way, the rating was "97% would make again" back then, and I have no idea why it went down) A perfect recipe to entertain with ~ everybody will go crazy.

Made it once for a couple of colleagues after work--they raved. Will definitely make again for casual meal.

What a BIG disappointment.It broke my heart to waste vermouth, wine and gruyere cheese ( not to mention how expensive gruyere cheese is -cost me $10.00 in cheese alone!) My kids held their noses because of the smell and the taste was no better. I generally don't bother to rate recipes but I thought I would pass the word on this one. Maybe my garbage disposal liked it better than my family did.

Ours was a bit runny, but it was a pleasant break from our other two savory fondues (thicker). We used gruyere & havarti and only 1/2 the salsa verde (cheese too runny to pour atop & marble-ize).

This is an excellent sauce. Also works well as an appetizer. I've taken it to several parties and it's always a huge hit. Simply the best fondu I've ever had.

I followed the recipe exactly - and all the guests enjoyed it, dipping bread, steamed broccoli and zuchini. First time out in a new fondue pot - very easy.

Good and easy. I have made this using home made pesto sauce also, both are good

Fantastic and easy.

The green sauce had a minty quality that helped make the fondue not too cheesy. At the beginning, the fumes of the vermouth were still a bit strong, but after a while all the flavours merged together perfectly.

Easy to make but the favour was...yuk. I guess you have to like vermouth.

This is as easy as 1-2-3,fondues have been put on the back shelf since the late sixties and good to see this coming back with such a great recipe. This fondue gets top shelf in the recipe book.

Wonderful and Easy - the Salsa/vermouth was a great addition to the gruyere.

Very good. I had to add more than the 1 1/2c white wine in order to get the right consistancy. The fondue did not "stick" well to the shrimp but it was delicious all the same.
