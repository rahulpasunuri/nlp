Terrific, easy, and impressive. Double the mushrooms for 6 servings (or half the polenta for 3 servings). Next time I'll pull the polenta earlier (changing total cook time to 10-15 mins) as it really does solidify quickly after you've plated it.

This was simple and delicious. I added a pinch of red chili flakes to the polenta when I was whisking it. I poured the polenta into a pie dish, put the chanterelles on top, and put dollops of the mascarpone all over the top and baked it for about 20 minutes on 350.

I made this as a vegetarian main course with roasted asparagus on the side, and it was filling, rich and delicious. I added about 1/2 tsp. of truffle oil to the mushrooms, which was lovely. Previous reviewer was right--the lemon is essential. Mascarpone a nice touch.

I served the Spiced Pork Tenderloin on a bed of this, and it was heavenly. I couldn't find white grits, so used instant polenta - shortcut that still tastes wonderful and cuts cooking time. Used combo of white mushrooms and shitakes to cut cost as well. Do NOT skimp on the marscapone...I added a touch more than what was called for. I will make this again and again!

I served this at a dinner party and it won first prize ahead of prime rib. I used polenta, which I prefer to grits and I added a few tablespoons of gorgonzola to it after it was done cooking but still hot. I used about 1/2 cup dried porcinis and a pound of white mushrooms, which cut the cost down by about 1/2 compared to using chanterelles or hedgehogs. And it is about the easiest thing in the world to make!

very yummy indeed. used mostly chanterelles and some shittake. the lemon made the dish so fresh and I did find the mascarpone did make everything much creamier, however not essential. I did not find organic stone-ground white grits anywhere and I live in the Bay Area!!

Very rich and delicious!!! Lots of butter, so don't eat it if you're on a diet! You'll definitely want seconds! Mushrooms were amazing!!!!

This was wonderful. I also used all chanterelles. I found the Mascarpone unnecessary and would not include next time. The lemon, on the other hand, was essential.

An excellent side dish! Tasty in every way, but felt more of the mushroom mixture and mascarpone was needed.

Pleased with the results. Haven't made polenta alot but it turned out well. Used yellow instead of white. Took about 15 minutes to cook as noted by others. Would bring the mascarpone to room temperature next time so not so cold.

Delightful vegetarian meal and easy enough for weeknight. I only used chanterelles and followed the directions. I served roasted asparagus on the side and a nice glass of Pinot Noir. Really lovely dish.

This is absolutely the best polenta recipe I've ever had. I made it for Thanksgiving one year and it got RAVE reviews from everyone, and now it's September and I've already had 4 people ask me if I would make it again this year. It's DELICIOUS. Highly recommended as a side dish or even main dish.

Over all this was pretty good. The exotic mushroom's textures were a little bit too strange for me. Next time I will make this with button mushrooms. Dont bother paying more money for the exotic ones. The polenta was very good, especially with more parmesan than called for. This was enough for a main course for 4 with a salad ( I made the grilled pear salad with bacon and port vinaigrette, aslo on epicurious) and dessert.

Absolutely delicious. Perfect for a vegetarian main course if you serve a large portion--I served sauteed kale alongside. The lemon juice makes the mushrooms heavenly, and the mascarpone is KEY. All in all, delectable and different.

I made this for my book group last night and it was delicious. Almost everyone had seconds and, when I went to clean up, I didn't have to scrape a single plate! The only changes I made were to add some vegetable broth to the polenta water and instead of putting the mascarpone on top, I put a big hunk of goat cheese in the polenta. One of the most successful meals I've made in a while. (If you don't have a good source for polenta, try the Old Mill of Guilford NC website.)

I rarely rate a dish 4 stars, but this recipe is fantastic. The mushrooms just sing with the addition of the lemon and the simple butter sauce. I used a mixture of button mushrooms and dried (reconstituted) porcini mushrooms. The polenta, mushrooms and mascarpone is a combination made in heaven. This is an excellent option for a quick, but delicious midweek meal.

Delicious with cheap white mushrooms. I substituted plain white stone-ground corn meal (not the coarse kind usually used for polenta), and the polenta cooked in about 15 minutes. In that case the mushrooms can go on the stove first rather than second. To make mascarpone at home, heat 2 cups of cream & add one teaspoon of cream of tartar. When it reaches 180°F, remove from heat & cool in the pan. When cool, drain in a coffee filter or cheesecloth 12-24 hours. I'm not sure whether real mascarpone is made with a bacterial culture, but this acid version tastes delicious and is cheaper. I love that this recipe makes an exciting dish from ingredients I keep on hand.

Husband loved it and keeps asking for more! A winner all around. I've even made just the mushrooms as a side; they'd also be great atop a steak (use a little less lemon juice).

This was sooo tasty! I substituted merlot for the water in the mushroom sauce and it was AMAZING! My boyfriend and I ate the entire dish in one sitting.

This was AMAZING. It made the perfect autumn dish. I used wood-ear, shittake, and oyster mushrooms fresh from the farmers market. My husband (who typically doesn't like polenta) asked "what did you do to this polenta...it's really good". The marscapone matched the flavor of the shittakes delightfully. Made plenty with leftovers for two.

Yum Yum Yum Yum! Used regular yellow polenta (which cooked in 3 minutes not 30) and oyster mushrooms. Was an excellent dish all the way around.
