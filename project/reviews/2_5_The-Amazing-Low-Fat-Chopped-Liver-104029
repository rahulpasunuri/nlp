Not bad, although agree that spurging on real occasionally is preferable. It tasted Might try next time with the yolks or by sauteeing mushrooms & onions till caramelized for more depth of flavor.

Usually a liver pate is very heavy and fattening. This is wonderful and everyone liked it. It is a nice change from serving cheese. There is a wonderful Jewish restaurant in Ottawa that serves delicious chopped liver and this recipe compares!
