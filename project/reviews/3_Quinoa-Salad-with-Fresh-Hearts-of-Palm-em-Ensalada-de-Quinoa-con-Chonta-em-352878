I didn't have hearts of palm but made it without and it still tasted great!

Yummy. Everyone loved it - but we are also huge hearts of palm fans. I agree the cooking method produces the fluffiest, most perfect quinoa I've ever made. Please note: don't be like me & put the towel over the pan BEFORE you turn on your gas stove. I lost a good kitchen towel today, sniff.

I used much simpler instructions for cooking the quinoa. Following the instructions on the package I bought, I rinsed the quinoa well, sauteed it in 1 Tbsp. olive oil for a few minutes, then added 1.5 cups water and simmered it for 15 minutes. It came out clean and not at all sticky or mushy. I also added cold, diced cucumber and cherry tomatoes and served the salad cold. Both were great additions. With those changes, I'd give this recipe four forks. I'll definitely make the slightly modified version again.

This is a fantastic recipe. I made it last night without the hearts of palm; added a can of drained and rinsed black beans and some chopped red pepper. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. We loved it, and I just finished enjoying a nice lunch of leftovers. Great with fruit.

i've struggled with making quinoa that is fluffy, and this does the trick beautifully! i've made this many times and it turns out perfectly. i like the hearts of palm recipe but i've taken the cooking method and extended it to many salad variations.

The 4 forks is for the cooking method--the best approach to Quinoa by far. I actually use this method and a recipe from Martha Stewart for "Spicy Lemon Quinoa" that is great. Her method of cooking, not great. This recipe, not great--combined=GREAT.

I followed the recipe exactly, adding chopped celery, red pepper and halved cherry tomatoes. It was delicious. The quinoa cooked perfectly.

Haven't made this yet... but will try soon. I would *definitely* not steam the quinoa -- you're going to get much better results by cooking it like you cook rice, using chicken/veggie stock and adding a bayleaf. I would also consider replacing the raw onion with 2 onions that have been sauteed in olive oil until caramelized for 30 mins. And then maybe add some goat cheese or blue cheese. just sayin'. :)

One fork is being generous. Not one person in my family wanted a second bite. It needs something sweet, possibly an apple or a cucumber to even it out.
