A very simple and tasty way to get your vegetables. I sauteed the onion with a few carrots in a little butter before adding the broth and peas. The freshly toasted cumin and salt sprinkled on top adds a nice savoriness to the sweet soup. Next time I'm going to try it with some plain yogurt swirled in, as suggested.

A+. As others I recommend a generous handful of mint and cilantro on top.

I thought this soup was simply divine! I love green peas, and I love cumin, but I have never tried pea soup since it was so creamy looking, and I am lactose intolerant. This was very delicious served along with a grilled cheese sandwich. I added a sprinkling of cracked black pepper to my bowl, and it was simply divine. I will definitely make this again, many times. If you cannot get this soup to a blended, creamy state, perhaps you need a new blender.

This is a very good basic soup. The basic recipe (peas, onion, broth & cumin) make this a great recipe for experimenting and trying out spices. We added extra cumin and turmeric (and would have added some hot curry powder if our guests could handle it). It would also be good as a cool summer soup with fresh mint instead. The original recipe is not very flavorful, but as long as you are creative, it makes a nice starter.

I really thought this was just OK. My husband really liked it though, which is why I'm saying I'd make it again. I didn't like the texture--I couldn't get it creamy--there were little lumps of peas throughout. I'm not sure if I needed to heat the peas a bit longer, or if that was just the intended texture. As I said, just OK for me.

I thought this was the easiest, tastiest pea soup I've made. I added a little fresh mint, yummy!

Very easy, very tasty and low-cal soup. I used fresh peas, which I highly recommend. Would be such a great starter for a dinner party; simple, easy to prepare, but impressive.

This was really a good variation on a basic winter staple--cumin adds great subtle flavor. However if you use split peas you do not need to puree it. If you let it cook for an hour it will cook down very nicely and thickly. I added carrot to the onion, which I think is essential to pea soup. I also used water and boullion instead of chicken broth. You need to add more water with the veggies because the soup it gets very dry very easily!

I have done this recipe several times. I use more peas than what the recipe calls for. The result is a cremier, tastier soup. One of my family's favorite soups.

OK, I have to weigh in on this one to help tilt the forks back in the 3-4 range. I made this for company and everyone loved it and asked for seconds. Toasting the cumin seeds and grinding them fresh made all the difference. I just tried it again cold... my husband like it better cold but I liked it better hot. I'm going to try mixing the freshly ground toasted cumin with a little yogurt and swirling it in the cold leftovers I have to see how it comes out. Sorry, for the ease, low cal/fat and great taste... this recipe is a definite winner!

Very easy to make, but not very exciting. There is a recipe on this site for a cauliflower and cumin soup that is divine. Even though it takes a little bit more work, I'd make that again but not this. It isn't bad, it just isn't anything special.

Didn't have cumin seeds so sauteed cumin powder with butter and onions first. Used only broth, no water. Turned out very nice, with a sweet-savoury creaminess.

My husband loves pea soup and compliments even the most ordinary, but even *he* didn't like this recipe. It has a broth-like flavor, instead of a creamy pea consistency. Very bland and watery. Not your classic pea soup. The seconds ended up down the drain.

Perhaps I just don't like pea soups at all, but this "thing" was really underwhelming.

I haven't made this soup, but to see three reviewers in a row correctly spell the word "definitely"--my faith in America is restored. Now I must try it!

I made this as a starter for an Indian meal. The guests all loved it, one even commented that this was the best pea soup he'd ever eaten. I will definitely make this again.

This soup was a wonderful blend of creamy peas and the warmth of the spice cumin. It was almost like a comfort food. Kind of like the best of both worlds. I loved it. I will definitely add it to my list of fast easy tasty recipes.
