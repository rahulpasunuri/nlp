Blah! You have to add so much to this dish that you should just consider this a base. Think.. garlic, fresh herbs, Italian Sausage, wine, lemon zest, etc. I would also change the fontina, to smoked gouda... or maybe even goat cheese....anyway, play w/ this one.

I used whole wheat pasta, sweet yellow onions, and added a little crushed red pepper to spice it up, and it was a great dish.

Sorry I just submitted a review and forgot to mention I added a little white truffle oil at the end too, and used strong-tasting mushrooms...maybe that's why I liked this as much as I did!

I did doctor this up a bit like other reviewers by adding 3 links of turkey sausage, sauteed with the casings removed, and used the leftover oil and some additional oil to coat the pot to saute the vegetables. The only change I would make is to add the cheese SLOWLY, a bit at a time, to the vegetables and add pasta water as needed before adding the pasta. I only needed about 4 oz. cheese, and this way it can melt with the liquid without "globbing" as noted by a previous reviewer to make a nice sauce. My pasta broke apart with all the stirring (I used whole wheat rotini which may have been part of the problem)so that's why I'd wait til the end to add the pasta. Needs salt & pepper too. In the end it tasted pretty good, even for someone who likes strong flavors.

A correction: the marjoram should read CHOPPED FRESH.

I didn't rate this recipe because I changed it quite a bit. Based on the reviews of it being bland (but I loved all the ingredients) I added crushed red pepper, Italian sausage, and substituted some white wine for the water, plus lots of salt and pepper. It was great. I like lots of 'stuff' in my pasta so the proportion was good.

Like others have said, it was bland. We added a bit of balsamic vinegar and that made it better.

this was so mediocre. I'm still a novice in the kitchen and I turn to epicurious for instruction, but this was a real disappointment. I was drawn to this recipe because it's easy and I followed the other commentators' advice by adding garlic and S&P, but still it was so bland and boring - a waste of my mushrooms.

NO, this was not a success. There was way too much veggies in ratio to the lb of pasta. I should have realized the recipe was missing some basic things like garlic and S&P. Add the cheese as you serve so it doesn't blob all over your pasta in the pot. Liven it up with some freash basil.

I did not add the water, because the peppers, mushrooms and onions released enough.Fontina in Italy, where I live, is a gooey, smelly cheese that does not lend itself to grating. The smell and taste were off-putting to all present, and the end-result was on the bland side. Perhaps it could have used some garlic, and grated parmegiano or pecorino might have been a better choice.

We followed the advice of "Seattle" below. Instead of adding the cooking liquid I added the juice of one lemon plus enough wine to make 3/4 cup (we halved the recipe). I also added 2 t. lemon zest in with the marjoram. We used half oyster mushrooms and half chantrelle. I also added quite a bit of salt and pepper. It's surprising the recipe omits this basic seasoning! Then, we added about 1/2 cup of chopped basil on the top, as suggested by another poster. When I make it again I will leave all of the cheese out until the very end where I will pile it on top of each serving. We added it to the sauce and it congealed in the sauce and stuck to the bottom of the plate, the tines of the fork, etc. Over all I thought it was a simple and hearty way to feature and enjoy the taste of wild mushrooms while they are in season.

Where's the garlic, the chopped fresh herbs (Italian parsley, sage...)? For non-vegetarians, a handful of chopped pancetta, fried with the onions, will give this ordinary recipe a much needed kick.

Fabulous and very easy to make. I purchased the mixed mushrooms already sliced which cut down drastically on the prep time. The rest was a breeze. I made this for 6 people and had more than enough with everyone having seconds and some thirds. It was a hit with both the men and women. I used Dream Fields low carb Penne pasta instead of rigatoni for a lower carb count. I had to give the recipe to the other two couples. A SUCESS!

A recipe should be your best foot forward, this just doesn't cut it! ! We can all list a set of basic ingredients that constitute the premise of a good recipe, yet I'd rather hear from someone who has added their flair to an awesome rendition of one

I found this to be a great quick weekday supper for the family. It is what it is,nothing fancy but a blend of good earthy flavors. simple recipes like this are meant to be improvised. I never make it the same way-sometimes lemon somtimes wine, whatever is in the house.

I make a similar dish often, but seasonings are crucial. Saute the mushrooms with a little white wine, black pepper, & italian seasoning blend. When tossing the pasta, I add some chopped fresh basil leaves and salt.

To those who thinks this recipe is bland - try this recipe again, only adding some salt and pepper. I added 2 tsp. kosher salt and 1 tsp. ground black pepper to the vegetables. Makes a huge difference.

I think the cook from Seattle has a better view of the possiblities this recipe has than the cook from Montreal. Though Montreal's ideas may be good, the dish becomes pasta with vegetables al forno: maybe good, but a different dish in my view. Seattle's advice is, I think, much more in keeping with the spirit of the recipe and a great improvement without changing the basic aim of the dish: pasta with the simple yet elegant flavors of peppers and mushrooms.

Very bland and boring. I made it after reading it in the magazine. I should have checked out the reviews on the web first.

I suppose it might be a good recipe for someone who's satisfied with ordinary food. The cook from Seattle says add roasted red peppers, preserved lemon, white wine and butter... "try it again". Sounds better, but that's not the recipe I recieved. Should've done like the cook from Montreal.

I'm amazed how picky the reviewers have been. A recipe is always a starting point--do with it as you may. My family loved this pasta. Thanks

We make this dish often. It is a refreshing change to cooking meat dishes. We do however add tomatoes and red chilli flakes to sauce it up a bit, the noodles work well with the additional sauce. Another variation is to use three medium size peppers, one yellow, one red, one green. (still adding tomatoes, and red chili flakes too)

I started out making this dish, but realized halfway through that it was going to be bland, so I added tomatoes, zucchini and herbs and put it in the oven to make it au gratin. The first night it was very bland, but the leftovers seemed to develop flavour and they were better, but not great still. If my recipe with additions was bland, I could just imagine what the dish would taste like as is. There are much better and tastier pasta dishes out there.
