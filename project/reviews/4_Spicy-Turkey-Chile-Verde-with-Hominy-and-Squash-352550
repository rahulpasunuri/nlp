I really liked this. The flavors and textures were good; I served it over rice. The recipe makes a lot so next time I'll freeze some. My only complaint is that it seemed too salty and I'm not sure why.

Used andouille sausage and Herdez salsa verde, but this was just not good. I'll be able to finish it off, but just so I don't waste food!

This is a great recipe. Instead of turkey sausages, I used ground turkey, adding sausage spices: fennel seed, chile powder, cumin, coriander, smoked spanish paprika, and a little cayenne. Exceptional, especially being so quick and easy.....

Great dish! I altered it a little, but the butternut squash was a great touch. I used ground turkey instead of sausage, and cooked it with habanero and green chile peppers to spice it up. I also added anaheim peppers to the chili to add a little more color and flavor. I used Frontera's Tomatillo Salsa, and that worked wonderfully. I added a bit of water because it was really thick, and I like a little juice in my chili! I served it with a little sour cream and crispy tortilla strips and everyone loved it!

Quick and easy. I was unable to find the proper sausages so I used hot Italian sausages instead. It turned out great.

amazing! very fast and delicious. my boyfriend is picky and doesn't like sausage, so we used ground turkey instead. we cooked it with some taco seasoning and then followed the recipe. we also used potatoes instead of squash (just about 1 large brown potato). I did cook the potato a bit before I put it in the mix. delicious recipe!!

This was so good! I made the recipe exactly as stated and put it over some brown rice - it was perfect! Great mix of flavors and textures, filling, and healthy! We will definitely make this again.

Really good for a weekday meal. I used pre peeled and cut squash which made it super easy. Very tasty and spicy. Topped it with plain yogurt.

Easy one-pot meal--great for a weeknight. I doubled the recipe as one reviewer suggested because I wanted an additional day of leftovers. The recipe as it is written, however, makes MORE than enough. Now I have leftovers for a week--far too much for two people! The dish itself is flavorful and has a nice spice level, although the butternut squash adds a rather incongruous flavor that doesn't combine well with the tomatillo sauce. My husband, who is Mexican and usually picky about any variation on Mexican dishes, did like the dish, but carefully ate around the squash pieces. Next time, I'll substitute potatoes for the butternut squash or perhaps just leave it out. I served it more like a pozole, topped with chopped onions, cilantro, and avocado, along with warm corn tortillas.

Delicious as the recipe is written. Used Aidell's sausage. Added chopped avocado and grated farmhouse cheddar as garnishes. This would be good over rice too. Quick and easy to make

Really excellent. Reading the recipe it didn't wow me but I went with the good reviews and wasn't disappointed. My husband is not a "stew" person kept raving and said that it was one of his favorites. Don't skip the hominy. It also might be good with the addition of cubed potato.

This is fantastic - I would double everything except the following amounts I used in my second batch that came out perfect: 3 andouille turkey links (9 oz), diced 3 spicy chicken sausage links (such as habanero and green chile-9 oz), diced 1 large fresh poblano chile 1 32-ounce can hominy in juice This will make a perfect consistency and plenty of sausage without it being overkill.

Fantastic and very easy to make. But if you want a decent amount, you MUST double or triple the recipe. I find that his only makes enough for two or three adults for one meal.

We really like this and the only reason I did not give it a 4 is that it was a bit thick. Related to the comment below that it was overly spicy, I used smoked turkey sausage, not the spicy kind, and it was just right.

This was good but the amount of green sauce wasn't nearly enough for the amount of sausage and other things so I ended up adding water and a boullion cube. I would plan to at least double the salsa verde next time.

This was great and easy for a weeknight dinner, but with the spicy sausage and salsa verde, it was too much. I will make some modifications for next time.

Excellent and very easy! A good way to get squash haters to eat squash. My store didn't have peppers or turkey sausage so I substituted 16 oz. of chile verde (green) salsa and used cut up Johnsonville brats in place of sausage.

This was quick and very good! My store was out of the fresh pepper, so I used a small can of chopped jalepeno instead. This was very spicy but very flavorful! Try it!
