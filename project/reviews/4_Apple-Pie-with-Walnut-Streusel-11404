I make this pie ALL the time. It's super easy and everyone loves it - kids included. There isn't as much crust since it's almost like a tartine and the streusel is so good! I sub walnust with pecans since I prefer pecans. So good!

A really fantastic apple pie! I used Gala and Cameo apples, will make this one again.

I received rave reviews from all picky dessert eaters this Thanksgiving! This pie is not overly sweet and lets the delicious apple flavor shine through. I will definitely make this again next year.

I make this pie every Thanksgiving and it is FANTASTIC. I use golden delicious and granny smith in combo. It bakes down quite a bit--at first it looks like the apples will overflow the crust, but it deflates quickly while baking. I also make double the amount of streusel!!! People in my family look forward to this pie all year!

Made this for the second year in a row after apple picking. Have no idea which apples I used but it always comes out perfect!!! SOO YUMMY, only apple pie recipe you need!

Delicious! The crust is very easy to make in the food processor and very forgiving if you overwork it. I used only half the amount of sugar called for in the filling and thought it was just right. I also doubled the amount of topping. I baked it for the first hour in the morning, and then put on the topping and baked it for the last 30 minutes later in the day.

Excellent apple pie. I too didn't use the piecrust because I was in a hurry. Nor did I make the ice cream, but the apples in the pie and the topping was one of the best I have ever had. It was really carmel like and what dripped from the pie pan was very sticky and looked like candy. The only thing I did different was I browned the walnuts before adding them to the crumb topping.

Delicious. I used half Granny Smith and half a mix of the eating apples (gala, fuji, red delicious) I had leftover. Used a Pillsbury pre-made crust and doubled the streusel. The ice cream was lovely, and a small scoop with the warm apple pie was a little bit of heaven, but it is a very, very rich dessert. 8 egg yolks?? Wow.

I've been making this since 1998 and I love it. My daughter told me about it. I have started adding dried cranberries for Thanksgiving and Christmas and if my niece who is allegic to nuts is coming, I substitute cranberries in the strussel. I double the crust recipe and make a top crust and cut a hole in the center for the strussel. This is definately a family favorite.

This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving. The only change I made was to double the streusel. Absolutely delicious.

Dough was really soft, hard to work with, despite using only 1 tbsp of water. I was surprised that 3 lbs of apples actually fit into my 9.5" pie dish, but it did but I had to arrange them to pack them all in. I used mostly eastern McIntoshes for this. I felt that there should have been a bit more dough in the recipe in order to get a 15" circle of appropriate thickness (I measured). Tripling the streusel topping is way over the top, as I discovered. Doubling it is PLENTY. I'd make again with a few changes - firmer apples and more of them as it collapsed a bit when it was done and the topping to apple ratio was slanted towards topping. I didn't make the sour cream ice cream so no comment on that portion of the recipe but B&J vanilla did just fine. Four stars because despite the issues with dough, it was simply stellar.

pretty good- but not as 'wow' as it seemed with all the reviews... I will make this again and it wasnt too hard, but tasted like other apple pies i have had...

it was awesome!! i have made this apple pie soo many times. ive come to learn you don't need walnuts so now i just do regular streusel and triple the called for amount and cover the whole pie. it is so good. my family won't stop asking me to make it. I got sick of making it so often, but i love it.

Big hit at Thanksgiving! Had to make a second pie for guests staying for the weekend - but tripled the topping (double on first). Slight modifications - used all brown sugar, corn starch vs flour, and no lemon juice as it changes the flavor. (No one cared that the apples were not "white").

Rating: 4
Fantastic pie! I didn't have the deep dish pan nor the right size cast iron skillet but went ahead and made with my regular old pie plate. It turned out perfectly and it was so delicious...I got raves at Thanksgiving and was rather proud of myself too as I have only made a pie one other time in my life and was pretty nervous. I think next time I will experiment with using oats instead of nuts in the crumble to create an apple crisp like topping but the whole pie was superb. I also doubled the topping as others suggested. I can't wait to have a reason to make it again.

Rating: 4
Made this for Thanksgiving dinner and was so pleased with how it turned out. I did not make the ice cream, but made the pie exactly as the recipe directed. The streusel was plenty for just the center of the pie. The crust was fantastic; I ended up using the same recipe for my second (pecan) pie.

I made this for my husband's birthday party since he likes pie instead of cake. I had to increase everything because I only had a 12-inch skillet available. I doubled the streusel topping and added nutmeg (a personal favorite). The pie got rave reviews from all the guests and my husband. I liked the idea of the cast-iron skillet presentation and think it contributed to the great baking of the apples. Thanks! Linda

I've never made a decent apple pie until I tried this recipie. It was wonderful. I used a deep dish glass pie pan and doubled the topping as others suggested (I used pecans). Everyone raved! I doubt I will ever try another apple pie recipie. Why bother when perfection is realized?

We really enjoyed this pie - everything was great, including the crust, filling and topping. I didn't follow other reviewers' recommendations to increase the streusel and I'm glad because it's a very sweet pie as it is. Next time I might decrease the sugar in the filling a tad, but otherwise a great recipe.

This is an amazing pie recipe. Do not use a different recipe for the crust!!! It is what makes it so special - it is almost like shortbread. Also, do bake in a cast iron skillet if you have one. I have been known for my apple pies for year and decided to take a chance on this recipe - glad that I did - everyone loves it.

What a wonderful fall treat!!! This pie was absolutely delicious. My family loved it so much it disappeared in a matter of days. Used a different crust recipe (I like butter and shortening in my crust). Tripled the streusel topping and didnt bother folding over the edges of the crust. I also didnt bake it for as long as the recipe required...better just to check the apples :)

Wonderful pie! The crust is so easy to make; it only takes a few minutes in the processor and turns out beautifully. My guests also loved this pie. It will become my go-to dessert for fall.

With our McIntosh apple tree having a banner year, I wanted more than the standard recipes. This one is an enormous hit with my husband and it was very straightforward to make. I'm not fond of walnuts and always use pecans, but that's a minor alteration and had no impact. The McIntosh hold up nicely and add a little more flavor than Golden Delicious. A great pie that will be made again and again.

This was DIVINE. Yum!!!!

Delicious! And an interesting twist...apple pie and apple crumble all in one. It was my first attempt at pastry from scratch but it turned out just perfectly. The only thing I changed was to double the streusel topping as other reviewers suggested and thought that was perfect. This will definitely go into my list of "tried and true" recipes.

Rating: 4
This is such a hit, it's requested for every party I go to. I use Granny Smiths (less juicy) and a frozen deep dish crust, then triple the topping. I've even soaked the apples in vodka for about 30 min. before continuing the pie. Wonderful Pie.

Heaven in a pie! I followed everything to the T using half Granny Smith (medium to small size only), half Gala with amazing results. Easy to make with amazing flavor. I'm still drooling on the computer.

I made this for Thanksgiving dessert this year and it was a big hit, as was the ice cream. I love making ice cream and this one is a definite do-over. It's very rich, however, and may not be for everyone. I also agree with previous reviewers that it's best to double or triple the ingredients for the topping. To save a bit on time, I used a deep dish store bought pie crust and it worked perfectly with this recipe.

Rating: 4
Great pie! The texture of the apples is perfect (used Jonagold). Tripled the streusel - glad I did. Made for a better presentation. Had to cook in pie pan and just crimped the edges b/c I couldn't use my cast iron. It turned out great! I added more cinammon, some allspice and some nutmeg. Also subbed pecans for walnuts. Not necessarily my favorite crust recipe, but this pie is AWESOME!

Rating: 4
I've made this for several dinner parties and it's always a great hit. I definitely at least double the topping. The crust is easy to make and I usually use a combination of regular flour and whole wheat pastry flour, which gives the crust a more home-made look, taste and feel.

Rating: 3
Wow! What a great apple pie. The crust was flaky and tasty. The filling was simple to make, and came out delicious. I did not have Golden Delicious, so I used Granny Smith. The topping was terrific. My only problem is that I did not think there was enough topping. Next time, I will double that section of the recipe.

Rating: 4
This is a great pie! This was my first time making a pie in a cast iron skillet and it did a great job! I also loved the presentation with the casually folded over pastry border with the streusel center. I would not increase the amount of streusel, it would be too sweet. I did use the previous suggestion of using 2 T shortening in place of 2 T of butter. I used braeburn apples. Did not make the ice cream.

Rating: 4
Wow, I certainly got lots of compliments for this, my first apple pie! I used a Pillsbury pre-made crust and tripled the streusel topping (everyone's favorite part). It had to sit for 24 hours before serving, at which time we warmed it slightly while we ate dinner in a 350 degree oven that had been turned off. It was soooo tasty, albeit quite a 'soft' pie; it truly came out as sort of a combination cobbler and apple pie. Not that there were any complaints! I used a combination of Granny Smith and Pink Lady apples; perhaps next time I will stick to just the Granny Smiths, as they were less juicy....

Rating: 4
This is a perfect pie. Make the 15 inch crust and fold over - then you won't need to triple the walnut streusel. You should only need fill a small center opening. Add 2 tbl. shortening with the stick of butter to make the crust.

This recipe is excellent as written. The crust definately makes the pie, and is very easy to make using food processor. I don't how someone would rate it 4 forks when they really did not use the recipe? The effect you get by following the recipe is beautiful. The only thing I changed was to double the streusel.. I am a sucker for streusel topping. Got raves at 3 different holiday gatherings.

Oh my gosh!!! This was a huge hit. I followed alot of suggestions and added a few extras. Definitely use a cast skillet for one. Crust was SO easy, substituted 2 TBL of Crisco as suggested. I did triple the topping and used pecans instead of walnuts--would probably use a full cup next time. I used a hodge podge of apples we picked (mutsu, ida red, winesap, granny smith)--what a delicious combo. I cut the sugars in half for the filling and increased cinnamon to 1 tsp.; added dash of nutmeg and 1/4 tsp of cardamom. What a beautiful and delicious pie!! I can't wait to make it again!

Rating: 3
Gorgeous outcome! I made it in a spring pan (didn't cover the fold over the shell) and followed the previous recommendations (used oat for the topping made both more of it and of the filling)... the only downside is the guilt one feels after looking at the rate the pie has been eaten!

I made this for my mother-in-law for her birthday instead of cake. She couldn't get enough of it. Apple pie is her favorite and she said it is the best she has ever had....and she's had a lot of apple pie!! I tripled the streusel recipe and would do that again. I didn't have time to make the crust, but just used a premade one. It was delicious! This one is a keeper!

Just finished the last bite of this wonderful pie! I used a purchased Pillsbury pie crust. Used more apples (used 1/2 brown sugar & 1/2 Splenda) and just filled the dish. I tripled the crumb walnut topping. (used 2 TBL light brown sugar, 2 TBL dark brown sugar & 2 TBL Splenda and 1 cup chopped walnuts) It was great! After the pie was in the oven for the last 20 minutes, I spread the topping with a fork after in was in the oven 10 min.. so that it was evenly spread. I served this with Haagen-Dazs dulce de leche (caramel) ice cream. It would be just as good without ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream. This would also be good in a crimped tart pan. My husband said it was the best! It served very attactively on dessert plates.

Delicious and easy to make, a crowd pleaser! I made this for my mother-in-law's birthday (she wanted an apple pie). She likes unpeeled apples so I left the peel on. I tend to agree with her about leaving the peel on. I used three varieties of apples (macintosh, braeburn, and granny smith). I used more apples than the recipe calls for and a smaller dish (9in.) I ran out of butter so I used a ready made refrigerated pie crust. I doubled the recipe for the streusel. Next time, I would triple it, like the other reviews suggested. The end result was a very easy, very yummy apple pie that I will surely make again!

My dinner guests liked this more than I did. I thought the crust was way too thick despite rolling it out per the instructions. I would make the filling and topping again, but need to find a better crust. I liked another reviewer's suggestion of not doing the crust overhang and tripling the struesel topping.

Rating: 4
The best apple pie I've ever made. To avoid the filling shrinking and leaving a gap between the crust, I cooked the filling on the stovetop for about 15 minutes til the apples shrunk, then when cool, baked it for 1/2 the time. Since the filling is already reduced, there is no gap betwwen the crust.

Rating: 4
this was fabulous ! I didn't have time to make the crust - so bought a soft pie crust - will try the recipe next time. I followed the advice of others - tripled the topping and added nutmeg and ground clove to the filling ...this was a hit ! Made one mistake - Cut the apples in 1/2 cubes instead of wedges - but it was still great ..this one is a keeper

Rating: 4
The crust was fabulous - I took a reviewer's advice and substituted Crisco for the add'l two tablespoons of butter. The filling is scrumptious - very much like the pie filling a grew up with, but the brown sugar was great. I used MacIntosh apples. The streusel is confusing. Very pastie - not crumbly. I tripled the recipe in order to get coverage over the pie. Okay-it may have been pastie, but it is to die for!

This pie is incredible!! I decided to not use the pastry overhang, and instead tripled the walnut topping. My husband and I absolutely loved the walnuts. He probably ate 3/4 of this pie himself, and he isn't really a treat freak (like myself).

Rating: 3
I made this recipe exactly as written and it was great. The key to working with this buttery a dough is to roll it out on the plastic wrap you chilled it in while it is still cold. This makes it easy to transport to the pan. I also baked it in a cast iron skillet for a new experience. It worked wonderfully! I think I'm now hooked on cast iron instead of Pyrex for deep dish pies. I would double the streusel without doubling the walnuts if I were to make it again.

This has become a favorite with family and friends. I get requests for birthdays and family get togethers. I've never made the ice cream, but I never have a crumb left so I guess we don't need anything extra.

Wow! This was fantastic. I had no trouble with the separation issue..but 3 lbs of apples is not 6 apples.. I went with a few more. But then again, it could just be that I ate some of the pie soon after it came out of the oven and it didn't have time to separate! Serve it warm out of the oven. Show all your guests.. let them say "oohh" and then you won't feel bad when it does get messy after cutting.

This should win an award. For the final 2 TBS of butter in the crust, I substituted crisco -- easier to roll out. It looks like something from a French Country Inn and tastes even better.

This pie tasted fantastic. I combined two different varieties of baking apples but it came out fine. My only complaint is the same as other reviewers; as the pie cools, the apples shrink away from the folded-over pie crust which leaves a strange-looking gap. Why not make a regular "crimped" edge crust?

I made this for four different families during the Thanksgiving holiday. All raved. The only thing I did a little differently was add ginger and nutmeg to the spice mix to "kick it up a notch" and it came out great!

I made the pie with Golden Delicious apples, a little extra cinnamon a heaping teaspoon), and my favorite recipe for crust (from Craig Claiborne's old New York Times cookbook--if you have a pie crust recipe that works, why fool around?). Thought it was absolutely delicious served warm with store-bought vanilla ice cream--everything an apple pie should be. I deducted a "fork" from my rating, though, because the filling does shrink away from the folded-over crust as the pie cools, and so despite my pains with cut-out pastry oak and maple leaves, it didn't look very nice with a big gap between crust and filling. If you can't serve this straight out of the oven and want a good-looking pie, I'd recommend just making a regular single crust and not doing the fold-over thing. Those of you who like an apple pie that's more tart than sweet should probably look elsewhere for a recipe where the recommended variety of apple and the seasonings are adjusted accordingly-- streusels are sweet by definition. I will definitely make this again. It was a wonderful finale to a supper of pot roast with a melange of root vegetables.

Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous. This is my all-time favorite pie. I use granny smiths and substitute pecans for the walnuts. Baking it in a cast-iron skillet produces a crust better than any I've ever had out of a pie tin or pie plate. It's so easy, I make it once a month at least.

I used granny smith instead, and felt it was still a tad too sweet-cut back on the sugar a bit. I also used a prepared whole wheat crust and covered the pie loosely with foil for the first bake. It was really delicious! MY family loves this pie, so after making it a few more times, I must say the sugar needs to be cut back. Also, I substituted oatmeal for the flour in the streusel, and it was delicious!

I used a variety of apples such as gala, red delicious and rome. I did the recipe accordingly, but I didn't add enough sugar due to the tartness of the apples.. but it turned out PERFECT.
