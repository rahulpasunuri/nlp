My boyfriend made this with a more traditional egg custard base and vanilla extract, but he did the whole procedure with steeping the skins. It was very flavorful and fresh tasting. I loved it!

Ice creams can be made with a custard base or without. See the Epicurious food dictionary entry at http://www.epicurious.com/cooking/how_to/food_dictionary/entry?id=3011 for details.

I just printed this out and wonder why it doesn't use eggs. Every ice cream I've made -- and I make a lot -- uses an egg custard base. Any ideas?

WOW! This recipe is amazing. Using the pits and skin really helps promote a fresh fruity taste. The ice cream has a nice creamy finish.

Delicious ice cream that I have made on numerous occasions. The preparation of the fruit is a bit of a bother so I recommend preparing at least this portion not on the day you will be serving. I usually use more fruit than indicated and often mix soft peaches and nectarines.
