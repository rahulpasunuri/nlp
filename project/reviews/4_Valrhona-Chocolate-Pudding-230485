Wonders and easy. Added a pinch of cinnamon to the liquid before pouring into ramekins. Used 64% Cailler chocolate and didn't strain because no vanilla bean available. Subbed 1 tsp. Penzey's single strength vanilla extract. Served with fresh whipped cream and shaved a bit of chocolate on top. Great with a glass of Kahlua!

Made this for a holiday party this weekend and it was quite good. The flavor was perfect--used Scharfenberger chocolate as I couldn't find Valrhona. I made a double batch, though my ramekins were 6oz so they ended up a little larger than the recommended size. (Worked fine but these are rich, so if you're serving after large meal I'd go smaller rather than larger.) I also made it 2 days ahead and it tasted fresh. Unfortunately the puddings were a tiny bit grainy. I assume the fault was mine since no other reviews mention grainiess. Guess I'll have to try it again and see!

This sounds very easy, and I'd like to make it. However, do I understand correctly that it IS TO BE COOKED in a bain marie? If you took hot custard cups out of a hot oven and put them in a water bath, I think you'd have cracked cups. This recipe is not complete, I don't think. Can anyone get the Gourmet mag and clear this up?

I enjoyed this pudding so much at City Limits that I came on epicurious to see if I could find a comparable recipe. So happy to find the real thing! Great pudding, it came out beautiful. Needed a little more time in the fridge to set properly.

absolutely delicious. Would have appreciated a bit more instruction on bain marie technique but they turned out yummy. Used a mix of 100% cocoa mass and madagascan 85% chocolate. wonderful!

No review, but I love epicurious. Went to City Limits last night and was hoping to find a recipe similar to the amazing Chocolate Pudding I had there. I can't wait to try it at home.

Amazing pudding -- has impressed every guest I've served it to! Keep in mind that it's all about the quality of the chocolate -- my local Whole Foods was out of the excellent El Rey chocolate (58%) that I used the first time, so I tried substituting a cheaper brand. It ended up grainy and lacked flavor. Likewise, milk chocolate will not work, so make sure you stick pretty closely to the percentage of cacao in the chocolate.

Perfect. Absolutely delicious! I believe part of the directions are missing, second to last paragraph, 'Bake in a water bath'. It helps to put a tea towel on the bottom of the pan so the ramekins don't slide around when you are transporting in and out of the oven.

Unbelievably superb! I only wish it wasn't so fattening. The recipe was perfect.

I think part of the instructions are missing. I don't see a reference to the bain marie until the cooling part. I am baffled. I hope my puddings turn out okay.

This was delicious. Used a high-quality vanilla paste from Trader Joe's instead of the vanilla bean, and also their semi-sweet chocolate chips. Came out beautifully. Next time will add whipped cream and berries.

Exceptionally yummy! The labor to payoff ratio makes this well worth the time! Used a mix of a few local high-caliber dark chocolate brands and the flavor was fantastic, added a dollop of homemade whipped cream just prior to serving.

Delicious! I had a quart of organic whole milk/cream eggnog (watch out for the artificial everything in the regular eggnog) and used that instead of the whole milk and heavy cream. Made for a holiday flavored pudding - YUM!

Unbelievably delicious!! This is far better than the chocolate pudding recipes calling for cornstarch that you cook only on the stovetop. Don't let the idea of baking the puddings in a warm bath intimidate you. It really was quite simple, yet the results are a sophisticated chocolate pot de creme.

I have made this two times. I use Scharffen Berger Chocolate and it has been spectacular. I am putting it in my recipe box.

Awesome! I am a chef, but not a baker. Even I can make this recipe taste terrific! I made this dessert to go along with a Mexican-themed dinner, and with a sprinkle of cinnamon it was a perfect compliment to the meal.

This recipe is just amazing, I wish I could give it 5 forks. The texture is so smooth, the taste is so right (not too bitter, not too sweet)... If there was such thing as the perfect dessert, that would be it.

Absolutely delicious. Silky smooth. The only unexpected part was a thick brownie-ish layer on top. Maybe baked too long? Will try again (and again - such a hardship) to get it right!

Superb. I had some Valrhona chocolate on hand having purchased a quantity to make Cuban Opera Cake (which I urge you to try!). This pudding is wonderful. It is simple to make, silky smooth, lush chocolate flavor and just the right amount of sweetness. I might put a dash of cinammon in the future.

the word was: "best chocolate pudding ever". Not too sweet, either. As always, the trick is in the quality of the chocolate. Skimp on that and might as well buy Jello-O for the time it takes.

The most amazing chocolate pudding ever. Worth the time. I made it even better by topping with fresh whipped cream that I added Grand Marnier to, then topped that with shaved dark chocolate.

Yum, yum, yum,yum, yum!! Smooth, delicious, not too sweet. And easy to make.

This was delicious (!!!) and a hit with several people at home and work. I used Callebaut Bittersweet, however, and didn't have whole milk at home so used 1 cup 2% milk and 1 cup Heavy Cream in a wild guess about how to approximate the milk fat content of the recipe. Texture was very smooth, almost like a tender, silky creme brulee. My oven runs hot, so it only took 35 minutes, tops, to bake in 6 oz pyrex ramekins (as opposed to the 4 oz specified). Try this!! You'll add it to your recipe file!!
