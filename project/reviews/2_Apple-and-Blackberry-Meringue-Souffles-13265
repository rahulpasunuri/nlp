I can hardly even give this one fork. My husband actually said this was terrible; I don't think he's ever said that about anything I've made.

I found this to be easy and delicious. It had the right amount of sweetness and actually looks quite appealing. The pieces of apples and blackberries give it some substance and a nice texture. The only thing keeping this from being a four star recipe is the souffles are quite watery at the bottom, but it is still very good. However I would put them in custard cups next time as it could easily have served four.

I don't know what went wrong, but this dessert came out horribly. I'm usually very successful with Epicurious recipes, and really enjoy most of the ones I try, but this one had a very off-putting look and consistency, and my husband (I made him taste it) grimaced at the taste. Maybe we did something wrong...
