This was great and very easy to prepare, but next time I will add a few garlic cloves and remove them before serving. It could use a little oomph.

This is an excellent recipe - add 3 cloves of sliced garlic, 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes with the shallots and artichokes. As one reviewer indicated, make sure you take enough of the outer leaves off the artichokes. We didn't have a problem with the chokes - these were delicious, but I would make them to serve when ready. I made them ahead and they weren't as good as when they were freshly made.

Very good-agree with directions to remove any choke that exists and to soak briefly in lemon juice acidulated water. I was short on baby chokes, so added some whole baby pattypan squash just at the point of adding the broth (next time I'll add them a bit later as they were a bit overcooked - they need only 6 or so minutes.)

I disagree that you can eat these choke and all and so halve them then and scrape out choke with my thumbnail. Easy and a big improvement. Agree about holding chokes in acidulated water and adding garlic; the more shallots the better but they can make dish VERY expensive and you can do with fewer.

We thought this was great! It was also very easy to prepare. I too soaked them in lemon water after cutting to prevent discoloration and I omitted the parsley. We'll be making these again.

After reading all the good reviews, my husband and I were surprisingly disappointed with this recipe. It was very bland.

Yum! Yum! I definately suggest putting the cleaned chokes in a h2o and fresh lemon juice/lemon mixture to keep their color and add flavor. I also added halved garlic cloves to the braise. I nixed the parsley and added my just undercooked choke mixture to 4 seasoned tilapia filets, capers, fresh dill and drizzled olive oil. Bake in a lightly olive oiled 9x12 glass baking dish at 450 for 10-15 minutes. Easy and delicious.

Maybe I bought bad 'chokes, but I'm usually good judge of produce. I found this recipe rendered the baby chokes too bitter; it needed something to counterbalance it. Will stick with using mint and braising much longer in the future.

Quite good but not my favorite for baby artichokes. I soaked them in lemon juice, as one of the other reviewers suggested so I avoided the pitfall of discoloration.

wonderful flavors and easy to prepare. My 4y/o son asked for seconds and we polished off the entire dish. Will make again and again.

The braised baby artichokes turned out to be the perfect complement for grilled Indian meat kabobs. The shallots, white wine and chicken broth enhanced the flavor of the artichokes without overpowering them. Make sure you remove enough of the outer leaves of the artichokes so that all you're left with is the tender insides; a mistake we made.

Tasty, tasty, tasty!!! I want to eat this every day for awhile! We enjoyed it with a herb/white wine marinated salmon and lemon risotto. I got rave reviews. Definite 'make again'.

We thought this recipe completely smothered the flavor of the artichokes. The wine sounded like a great mix, but ended up over-powering the whole dish. We served it for Easter and the concensus was that the recipe should be shelved!

This is a delicious way to prepare artichokes, I've made it many times. I add a bit more liquid and cover the pan for part of the cooking.

The previous reviewers' comments about lemon juice (a whole lemon halved in a large bowl with some water) and snipping out the purple interior leaves are in other artichoke recipes too. I only had 1 lb. of arichokes, so I added some broccoli flowerettes. The shallots were not lost either and they are good. This is a cooking method that can be adapted to many different vegetables. I love it.

If your market sells baby artichokes (mine does occationally), this is a fabulous fresh artichoke dish. I buy up all of the baby artichokes when ever I see them and make this every day until they are gone. This dish gives you all of the flavor and none of the choke you get with large artichokes. As mentioned earlier - you must use lemon to keep the artichokes from turning brown.

This recipe had one big omission. There was no mention of lemon juice. Artichokes turn black once you trim and cut them. Therefore, you should rub them with lemon juice to stop this process and the lemon juice removes some of the bitter after taste. Artichokes have.

It is important to have the youngest, freshest baby artichokes. Served over polenta, it was a fine main dish with great flavor. As always, the quality of the produce is primary in the final outcome of such a dish.....you Californians are very lucky!

Good with 2 cloves of minced garlic added with shallots. You have to snip out any purple parts of the artichoke after you cut it in half. Good hot or cold. Yum!
