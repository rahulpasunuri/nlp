Oops! I meant, you should whisk in the flour before adding the potatoes, not *after*. Here I am writing about a typo, and I make one myself. :-P

The Preparation section is mixed up - be sure to read it very carefully. It reads, "Add potato and reserved clam juice and bring to boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer until potato is tender, about 10 minutes. Add milk and bring to boil. Whisk in flour mixture. Reduce heat; cover and simmer until potato is tender, about 10 minutes. Add milk and bring to boil. Whisk in flour mixture..." I would think you should whisk in the flour mix before adding the potatoes, not before. :) I am also confused by the directions to whisk at the end - isn't this going to be difficult once the potatoes have been added? (Or, are the potatoes supposed to be creamed and blended into the base?).

This was soooo good but I think most folks whom left reviews were not into heavy creamy soups. Which I respect. That being said;- and being from a good southern family- add some whipping cream. However much suits your fancy. Do as one other reviewer said and mix (equally) clam juice, chicken broth and white wine (that white wine really does add complexity). I also added mushrooms because we love them and did a couple of toher outrageous things. If you LOVE salmon and don't want it dried out, then chop it up (raw) into pieces the size of chicken tenderloins and then throw it into the pot. Salmon is so delicate it will cook in an instant. Anyone who likes this or thinks im nuts please let me know.

This was tasty and surprisingly not heavy. I had to use a cup of chicken broth along with 2 cups of clam juice (all I had on hand) and I added some remaining fresh thyme I had around too. Also tossed in some diced celery root along with the potato. Great with crusty sourdough bread!

I was worried that this wouldn't have enough flavor after looking at the ingredients, but was pleasantly surprised. It was very flavorful and very easy. I might add some fresh tarragon next time but it really doesn't need it. Very very tasty.

Very tasty with the suggestions made by Karen from Milwaukee. Replacement of part of the clam juice with riesling and veggie broth.

My husband loved this soup with a few modifications. To keep sodium levels low, I used 1 cup clam juice, 1 cup riesling wine and 1 cup unsalted chicken broth instead of all clam. Also substituted 5 small, unpeeled red potatoes for white, tarragon for chives, smoked and peppered salmon, and lastly added 1 1/2 cups thawed frozen corn to make it heartier.

I make this frequently and everyone raves! I leave out the potatoes, only because we are watching our carbs. I only use 1 jar of clam juice and substitute chicken broth to cut cost.

Very bland. Needs herbs, pepper? Salt? Turned out very thin.

Neither my boyfriend nor I like salmon (unless it's smoked or in sushi) but we bought some on sale anyway. I used half of it to make this soup and we both liked it a lot. I was a little short on bacon but next time would add extra because the bacony bites were my favorite part. Also I only used one cup of clam juice and made up the difference with salted water. I would make this again but would be sure to add the chives (I didn't have any) and would maybe make a little more roux. The salmon was tender and not too salmonish.

In an effort to cut the calories I added mashed potatoes, low fat milk for cream,2 parts chicken broth to 1 part clam juice and a can of minced clams. It was a lighter soup but still very good.

Not difficult to prepare, a very satisfying and attractive offering.

Got a bread maker for x-mas, so started a tradition of soup & bread sundays. This was the best soup i've made all year. Fabulous!Easy too. Didn't change the recipe at all. Serve with the pepper grinder as with any cream soup or sauce.

Delicious! The first time I made it, I found the clam juice a bit strong, so substituted a combination of white wine and chicken broth. Also, I increased the salmon to 1 1/4 lbs, and used 3 potatoes, so as to make it more of a meal. The combination of flavors is wonderful!

Being allergic to shell fish, I was looking for a recipe to replace the Smoked Salmon Chowder I could no longer enjoy at my favorite restaraunt. This recipe fits the bill. I replaced the clam juice with a frozen fish stock (haddock, vegetables), spices, and a little water. It was delicious. I recommend warmed home made bread, or soup crackers...

This has become an elegant favorite for company because it can be made ahead and just reheated. I've made this dish over a dozen times and it's always great.
