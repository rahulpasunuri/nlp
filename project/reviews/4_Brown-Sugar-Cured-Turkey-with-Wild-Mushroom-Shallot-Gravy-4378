This was delicious and what a great way to get a moist and perfectly spiced/seasoned turkey. I used a 17lb for 6 people and didn't adjust the amount of seasonings and i had some leftover. Also it only needed just under three hours in a convection oven so keep that in mind if you convect. It didn't affect the moisture but it was ready a lot sooner that I thought. Produced a gorgeous brown skin color. I felt like the gravy was a little too rich with the cream and would have been great with a regular turkey gravy.

This is hands down the BEST turkey recipe ever. I am making it for my daughter's first grade Thanksgiving feast and can't wait for the oohs and aahs when they see how fabulous it looks - just like a cover of a magazine.

I have been making this turkey for 10 years. I have never had any turkey that touches the flavor and juiciness of this recipe. I am about to make it again to serve as cold sliced turkey for sandwiches at an afternoon party. My husband insisted!

I agree with the previous review! I have made this every year since Nov of 1997. It turns out perfect just like the cover photo! My 8 year old loves to prepare the turkey with the rub etc. The wild mushroom gravy is out of this world and so good it could be eaten like a soup. The pear salad that goes with this recipe is a perfect match. Word of advice: Men don't let your wives toss out your spices during spring cleaning, they can get quite expensive!

Every turkey I have made since 1997 has been based upon this recipe. Even the "turkey haters" love this! It's the only turkey my husband likes to eat. I have never had a single guest not ask for the secret. :) Some have compared the flavor to a Honey Baked Ham. One of the best things about this turkey is how amazing the house smells when it's cooking! Heavenly. It smells like the quintesential Thanksviging - turkey and spices. Yum. I sometimes up the garlic and cloves. Don't go too heavy on the cloves or your guests will find their mouths to be numb. I don't always make the gravy as directed. However, the pan drippings are so incredible they only need a little extra broth, a thickener, and a little salt and pepper to make an amazing gravy that tastes good on the turkey as well as stuffing and mashed potatoes. It's about 2 weeks until Thanksgiving and I'm tempted to make this now and not wait.

I made this for New Year's Day with my extra free turkey- day bird. The best gravy I have ever tasted!!! There were 3 of us and barely any gravy leftover, will have to double it next time. Bird was so juicy the thermometer caused a geyser! I look forward to making this again and again.

I've made this recipe every Thanksgiving since 1993. It is fool proof. It is always rich and succulent. A no fail Thanksgiving approach.

I thought the gravy recipe was wonderful! It is now the most requested item on every holiday menu among my family. It is a little pricy and I had to use botton mushrooms instead of wild mushrooms (couldn't find them). But, it still comes out great each time I make it. The turkey recipe was so-so. My family and I did not like the sweetness of the turkey, but it was moist and tender. The mushroom gravy goes very well with traditional roast turkey and that's how I make it very year. 4 forks way up on the gravy!

Every fall I check with the friends I celebrate Thanksgiving with to inform them of the new turkey recipes that appear in the cooking magazines. It's a simple ritual to prepare us to gush about how it wouldn't be Thanksgiving without the brown sugar cure. It produces the best turkey that any of us have ever tasted, from the most sophisticated foodies to the ones who don't normally care. We make gravy from the drippings, which makes for a succulent, sweet gravy that goes perfectly on the sourdough-apple-almond stuffing that you can find on this site.

I have used this turkey recipe every Thanksgiving since it appeared in Bon Appetit, and every year it has been so delicious and moist. This year, cooking for 28, I decided to get 2 smaller turkeys (about 12 lbs. each) instead of a 20+ lb. one, figuring that they would cook in less time & give me more use of my oven. Big mistake-I shortened the cooking time because of the smaller birds and gauged the doneness by the little pop-up thermometers. This year, the turkey was SO dry and because of the smaller surface area of the turkeys, the flavor was too intensified. A friend also uses the same recipe, and did so this year with a smaller turkey, too - she had the same disappointing results that I had. Obviously, the cooking temperature & timing is designed for a big bird. I'll use this recipe again, but with a big turkey in the future.

I prefer a maple syrup glaze from an earlier year in Bon Appetit Thanksgiving history, but this is my back-up turkey when I can't get everything I normally make for Thanksgiving (such as this year living off the road system in Alaska). And despite MY personal preference, this is the one everybody raves about.. oh so tender, oh so juicy, oh so everything -- and it's the one I should make if I ever DONT want the leftovers as everyone seems to keep picking at it for the next several hours (leaving more pie for me -- YAY!). The sugar does a better job than maple syrup at holding in the moisture and is a bit more flavorful than olive oil (although I used bacon when I lived in Ireland and that worked well, too), and with a proper balance with the onion and garlic powders and the salt nobody has ever complained of it being overly sweet -- but we also compliment it with a less sweet cranberry relish and no candied yams or anything like that. Okay so you have to baste it... but most turkey roasting recipes call for that, and if you like something different or your guests aren't the sort of carnivores who enjoy a chunk of meat for its own sake and need something to carry it, then this is the one that has satisfied even my most persnickety guests. I'm so glad it's online since I haven't had all my recipes shipped in here yet... Epicurious saved Thanksgiving :-)

Sorry to be the loan decenter, but...everything on my table tasted sweet with this sugar cured turkey. Wine, turkey, cranberry sauce, sweet potatoes - there just wasn't enough savory food on the table since I rubbed sugar into the main course. Gotta to back to my standard olive oil rub! (Which, by the way doesn't need basting.)

I have been making this recipe for that last four years now and every Thanksgiving I get the same request to make this again. The slow cooking and brown sugar rub make this turkey so very moist. The wild mushroom gravy only enhances the wonderful flavorings.

This was excellent. Great, but different taste. Just made gravy using drippings (my guests didn't like mushrooms) - it was very good. I had a hard time trying to guestimate how long to cook my 12 1/2 pound turkey, since the recipe requires you to cook it at 300 when most cook time charts assume a 325 cooking temperature. When trying to figure out the cook time by looking on the web, I saw one source say that a turkey should never be cooked at lower than 325 (for safety reasons). I cooked it at 300 anyways and it worked out fine (even though it took longer to cook than I predicted).

I wanted so badly to give this 4 forks, but it just didn't wow me like I thought it would based on the reviews!!! I will admit I did 2 things wrong: I didn't have course salt and couldn't find any, so I used a lesser quantity of regular salt, and I only let the bird sit for about 14 hours with the spice rub, not a whole 24 hours. I guess I thought the brown sugar would melt into a glaze or something in the oven, but it just kind of cooked onto the skin crusty-like. My husband did say it was very moist, but thought the skin tasted like jerky. Oh, well.

Rating: 4
unbelievably delicious. crispy on the outside and buttery moist on the inside. It cooked faster than the recipe suggested, which was good--but keep your eye on that pop-out thermometer. our thanksgiving guests could not stop raving. this turkey not only tastes fab, it looks amazing, just like in the magazines. a total, major hit. oh one more thing - i added curry to the rub mixture. regarding the gravy, I made it as suggested but then removed most of the mushrooms and shallots w/a slotted spoon and served on the side. this made the gravy more "gravy-ish," not as thick and stewy.

This is the 4th year that I have made this turkey. It is currently in my fridge with the rub on it and I can hardly wait until tomorrow to dig in. I agree with most who have reviewed this that until making this recipe, turkey seemed a bit boring. It is so juicy and flavorful. I wouldn't make it or have it any other way. I have never made the Mushroom gravy because I think that making your own from the scrapings in the pan of this recipe is out of this world. Happy Thanksgiving. If you haven't tried this recipe - look no further.

Cooks beautifully and tastes wonderful! I will make it again. Goes great with the Mushroom-Shallot gravy. 11/18/01 Update: I rarely give 4 forks...but this turkey is not only flavorful and moist but beautiful! I used a fresh 16 lb. turkey with appropriate time adjustments and it was beyond delicious! The Mushroom Shallot Gravy is superb also...I ended up using all white button mushrooms with great success...the herbs give it a lot of flavor.12/01/02 UPDATE: I made this for the 3rd year in a row...still delicious and moist. The cooking method in the recipe is what helps keep it moist, but it does need a little extra cooking time than stated.I also turned up the heat to 350 for about 15 minutes at the end. It goes great with the Green Beans with Roasted Onions, on this site.

I have never craved turkey on Holidays because it is usually dry and boring. Boy have I changed my tune!!! This is by far the best turkey I have tasted (even better than fried turkey, in my opinion). I have used this recipe for the past 4 years with varying crowds and it is always a hit. I usually cook a smaller turkey but use the same quantities of spices for an even more flavorful bird. About the gravy, I have always loved the flavor of the roasted shallots and wild mushrooms and never thought of it as boring. I will, though, try it w/ deglazed pan juices to see if I like it even better. All in all... IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A 'WOW-EM' TURKEY RECIPE... LOOK NO FURTHER!

Great recipe! This was my first turkey ever, and it came out great. Due to timing constraints, it sat in the fridge for 36 hours instead of 24 (and it's probably that much better for it, too). I didn't have to bake it as long as the recipe called for, but I did end up covering some parts of the turkey with foil just to make sure it didn't burn up. I didn't have a meat thermometer (thanks, Peapod!), so I went by the "until the juices run clear" method, and it worked. Roasting a turkey isn't as hard as I thought, and this is a great recipe to give it a shot with! Picture of the turkey straight from the oven: http://pubweb.nwu.edu/~jonathan/turkey.jpg

I made this turkey for the first time about 2 years ago and since then it's the only turkey I make. Everyone loves it and asks for it over and over no matter the time of year. I cover it with bacon slices after marinating and cook it in a large foil roasting pan on a covered gas grill; it's hard to maintain the low temp. but easy to adjust in cooking time. It never fails to come out perfect using fresh or frozen turkey. Everyone fights over the bacon slices when the turkey comes off the grilland the gravy is outstanding on it's own or using recommended mushroom gravy. I hesitated to try it because it was so different from the usual but we're all glad I did.
