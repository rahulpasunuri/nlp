this is a great dish that's become a family favorite. we use fresh blood oranges and valencia oranges.

I didn't care for this. Not, "Let's just call for a pizza," bad - but nothing special or remarkable either. I followed the recipe closely. I'm not really into putting fruit into savory dishes, I guess. We threw out the leftovers and that's very rare in our house - they're usually warmed up the next day.

Used a turkey breast filet and fresh squeezed orange juice. Browned the turkey in the skillet for flavor and then finished cooking it on the grill since it was thicker than cutlets. The meat was very tender and moist. Also used cardamon since I had no coriander. Served over white rice as suggested. Nice change of pace from the usual turkey recipes.

I too thought that this would be a fine dish for a quick weeknight dinner. It was rather bland, and though there was no pith on my oranges, it did come out tasting rather bitter. My husband suggested that navel oranges are more bitter than their seeded companions. Who knows... Good idea, nice with rice, but just not right enough to even attempt to fix.

Thought that the coriander and orange would taste better together. Maybe fresh squeezed orange juice would make the dish sweeter. I used juice from a container (from concentrate) and kept tasting a bitter orange. Generally disappointed.

I'd probably make this again since it's fairly tasty, but I don't think it's a dish my husband will be clamoring for. I wasn't able to find turkey cutlets so I used chicken breasts cut into smaller portions instead. The only real disappointment was that I felt the coriander didn't really come through in the finished dish. I'd probably add more next time. Otherwise it made a flavorful pan gravy with just a hint of sweetness from the oj. And I agree with another reviewer that segmenting the oranges is probably easier than trying to make nice slices that will mostly fall apart anyway. Just save a couple uncooked for garnish, if you're so inclined.

This recipe is actually pretty good if you need to prepare some quick and tasty. Don't hold back on the use of generous amounts of coriander. I also pounded the turkey cutlets and flash fried them to ensure a nicely browned crust. Rather then slicing the oranges, I segmented them. At first glance it appears that there may be too many green onions that would overpower the oranges. I sauteed them with the orange segments and then added the broth and orange juice in the same pan and proceeded with the sauce. Simmer all together for about 10 minutes until you get a medium consistency and the oranges have broken up into the sauce then monter a beurre with 3 tablespoons of unsalted butter to add flavor, richness, and shine to the finished sauce. Garnish with plenty of freshly chopped cilantro.

Make sure you're using thinly sliced turkey, so it cooks the whole way through. I also added fresh coriander to the sauce, which people liked. I'm a fairly inexperienced cook, and managed to pull this off well. A very successful recipe.

A lovely fresh-tasting weekday dinner. Use plenty of ground coriander - roast the seeds and grind them yourself in an old coffee grinder - much tastier and more aromatic than bland store bought stuff!
