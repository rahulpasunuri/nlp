This bernaise is the best I've ever had, and was very easy to make. I followed the directions for the liquid portion of the sauce, and used my own hollandaise recipe. Definitely a keeper. Will be making double the amount next time as it was so good my guests wanted more.

i was terrified to make this bearnaise on christmas eve for a room full of belgians ;) i had never even made hollandaise before, but i used the blender technique mentioned in previous reviews and it was amazing (i swear it works!).

Wonderful, easy recipe. I made it with the blender hollandaisse, which is excellent and simple, and it was a major hit.

Best bearnaise recipe on the site (and that I have ever had, although I haven't tried the Escoffier original mentioned in one of the reviews below). Technique is not easy, but results are incredible!

Another method to prevent breaking. Cut butter into 1 tbs size pieces and put in the freezer for a while. Add butter chips 1 at a time and don't add the next until it has completely melted. It's a bit slow but it really controls the temperature.

I had the sauce break on me twice. Not sure what I did wrong. I think it was a combo of the heat control and too much butter into the sauce at one time. I then went to my old faithful NY times cookbook and they also recomended the blender technique. This worked perfectly.

I've made these eggs 3 times now and they never last long on the table. A definite keeper! Used light mayo and light sour cream with good results.

I HAVE THE FOOLPROOF SECRET TO PERFECT BEARNAISE THAT NEVER SEPARATES!!!!!!!!! This one is the greatest trick I have ever been handed down in the French Kitchen. Throw the cooked down herb mixture into a blender with raw eggs and the cream, then turn the blender on high and dribble the melted hot butter very slowly into the blender. Guaranteed perfect Bearnaise/Hollandaise that wont seperate!

I have made Béarnaise and Hollandaise in the past (15 years ago) on the stove top and it was extremely difficult to control the heat. This time I just used a pan of simmering water and a large Pyrex bowl and had zero problems. I also amended the recipe to Chef Fernando's suggestion and found it to be a very good one!

A decent recipe. I agree with chef Fernando, simmer your herb reduction till all liquid is gone. The herbs are still moist but there should be no vinegar to add to the hollandaise. I say herbs plural because I add fresh chopped curly leaf parsley as well as fresh tarragon....but then I ALSO add a little chopped garlic along with the shallots!! So, tarragon, tarragon vinegar, shallot, parsley, garlic, and a nice piquant (with Tobasco) hollandaise. Yep.

The original recipe for Sauce Bearnaise as found in the Escofier french cooking book first edition and only written in french. Calls for Shallots, Tarragon and tarragon infused red vinegar, herbs to be simmered until fully dry. That is called a bearnaise then you add the bearnaise to the Hollandaise Sauce. NO LIQUID IS ADDED. And the hollandaise must be a well made one that will run but not break.

This recipe has obviously survived since 1962 because it is so yummy! And because of its simplicity. thanks for your supreme recipe service, regards, Lanpinger
