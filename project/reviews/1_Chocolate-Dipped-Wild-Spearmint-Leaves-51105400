I didn't like this at all! the mint is very subtle, but it is actually much more time consuming to make than the recipe lets on. Unrewarding.

Haven't made this yet, but intend to very soon! What a great idea to use up the mint in my garden. Sounds like a refreshing and unique after dinner chocolate/mint w/ coffee. Will review once I make it!
