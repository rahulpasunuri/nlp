Great recipe. I doubled the recipe but keep the butter at 6 tbs., which is exactly what I will do next time. I will also shell the shrimp before cooking next time as it is a messy hassle to shell them after they are cooked.

A WINNER! I prepared this for a party and shortly before guest arrival grilled the prawns . Then I placed them in the butter sauce to be warmed just before serving. The quality was not compromised and I received rave reviews from everyone. It is rich though but once in a while it's well worth it!

We love shrimp. We love butter. We love garlic, olive oil and all these others things, but this is an artery buster...I made exactly as written but we found too too rich as an entree. Maybe a great one-skewer appetizer for guests. My own mistake to serve with the Andouille Grits in the suggested menu -- call the cardiac unit! Be sure to serve a crisp green salad to cut through the butter and other fats: we did and it saved the meal...threw out some shrimp, just too rich to finish.

I have been making this for years. Easily modified to your situation. With the kids and for less mess I put all the ingredients in a skillet except the shrimp, saute a couple of minutes then add the shrimp already peeled. Saute 3 minutes each side. Toss the shrimp and sauce over rice or pasta. Add some veggies if desired. Be sure to have the crusty bread.

We have been using this recipe since it came out in Gourmet magazine. The magazine page finally disintegrated. We always get rave reviews and is our "go to" fast seafood recipe. Thanks Epicurious for having archieved it. We highly recommend trying this one and enjoying it with a glass of ice cold pinot grigio, a green salad, and sourdough bread. Just make sure you put out a shell bowl and plenty of paper napkins.

I made this dish this evening and sadly to say I was very disappointed. The shrimp were awesome, but the sauce tasted like a bowl of worcestershire sauce and salt. I followed the directions exactly and did not modify anything.I will be in search of another grilled shrimp recipe and not use this one again.

We are big fans of New Orleans-type barbecued shrimp. I made this the other night for my husband and myself and we loved it! Made it exactly as directed and ate it with crusty bread. It was a wonderful (messy) meal!

Rating: 4
I love this recipe, however, I use the ingredients list and completely change the preparation. I marinade the shrimp in oil and garlic and then but it in the oven on broil until the shrimp are done. Meanwhile, I make the sauce on the stove in a saucepan and toss the whole thing over whole wheat penne. I think it's really a delicious dinner--I've made it several times, and my family and I can't get enough!

This is messy to serve and kind of time consuming to make. My friends devoured the skewers though. Babysit the shrimp once it is on the grill, it will cook very fast and should practically snap like a fresh green bean when cooked correctly. You'll have plenty of sauce.

I have been making this since the recipe was first published in 2003. I've served it over rice (mix in the sauce), veggies, you name it. I've added sausage to it; I've broiled the shrimp (shell on). I've done 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil to replace all the butter. IT'S FABULOUS. Yum!Yum!Yum! You cannot go wrong. The only thing I do everytime that isn't called for here is I brine the shrimp ala Cook's Illustrated. Gives the shrimp wonderful taste and texture like lobster. OMG, I think that's what we are having for dinner! :)

Delicious and simple. My mother-in-law in south Louisiana makes BBQ shrimp (whole, unpeeded) under the broiler, so borrowing and adapting from her we broiled peeled shrimp for 3 minutes each side and they were perfect. Also added a little cayenne pepper for more heat. Easily adaptable for serving a large group, and would make wonderful shrimp and grits. Good crusty French bread for dipping seals the deal!

I made this last night for a dinner party along with other Mardi Gras recipes from this week's menu on epi, and it was a big hit--especially the sauce! It was exactly what grilled shrimp should be and might just be the best recipe that I've tried from here. One thought is to reduce the chili powder a bit. I used the Chinese kind (even hotter) and reduced it but it was still almost too hot (even for those with spicy palates).

This recipe is a family favorite. However, I don't cook the shrimp on the grill. Instead, I place all the ingredients in large frying pan over med- high heat. Let the butter melt, sautéing the garlic, then I add the shrimp (already pealed) to the pan and cook until the shrimp are opaque. Ive tried it both ways, and the grill, for me anyway, is more hassle than its worth. Also, by using shrimp that are already pealed, it really lets the sauce coat the shrimp, instead of coating the shell that youre about to peal off and discard.

Made this recipe for a Labor Day BBQ, and everyone loved it! Took the advice of other raters and lessened the butter to 4tbsp. and used ceyenne pepper instead of Chile pepper. My husband absolutely loved it so I will definetely be making it again. Maybe as a side dish with a great grilled steak.

Made this as an appetizer for my dinner party. It turned out wonderful and I'm still getting request for the recipe. I took the advice of the other raters and decreased the butter to 4 TBSP, added 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper and removed the shell and left tail in tact. I purchased a wire frying from William-Sonoma so I wouldn't have to use skewers and I must say this is the best purchase I've made in a long time. The shrimp came out perfect!

I have made this a few times now and love it. The only thing I changed was that I removed the shells, leaving the tails. I find the shrimp absorb the flavours better.

This was great, and I'll definitely make again. It's a real crowd pleaser. I'm going to try to use olive oil instead of butter next time and see what we think. Also, it was a bit frustrating removing the shells with all the great flavor--I'm tempted to do this without the shells on and take my chances with the shrimp overcooking.

Rating: 3
With the exception of the chili powder, this is essentially the recipe for what we call "Barbequed Shrimp" here in New Orleans, even though "barbeque" has nothing to do with the recipe. We leave the shrimp WHOLE, yep, head and everything, mix all ingredients together until very hot, then simply cook the shrimps in the mixture until just done. This is served in individual shallow bowls with lots of napkins, and with french bread to soak up all the nummy juices. If I'm not mistaken we use a moderate amount of cayenne pepper, so perhaps that is what is meant here by chili powder

I have made this recipe over and over again to rave reviews....my slight adaptations to the original recipe are easy and as follows...I marinate the shrimp in all the ingredients except the butter and lemon juice, for a few hours...then I put the mixture in the wok on high heat with the butter and give it a toss around the pan till the shrimps are cooked through. Finish it off in the serving platter by squeezing the lemon juice over....soooo good!

I have to say that this was a little too buttery for me. Although the flavor of the sauce was really good, I felt that it was too fattening, even after reducing the butter to 4Tbsp rather than 6. I did add a little cayenne pepper and a little more lemon than called for. I didn't have any bread so I made rice to soak up the juices. I know that the bread would have been perfect, but I didn't have time to go to the store. Also, I used frozen shrimp rather than fresh shrimp. I can taste the difference, so that may have killed it a little as well. The recipe was enjoyable, but I probably wouldn't make this very often. I don't feel like the calories are worth it.

First of all, I'm not the kind of eater that likes to undress the shrimp before I pop it into my mouth. So, I took off everything, even the tail. Marinated the shrimp and skewered them all.

This has quickly become one of our favorite weekend grill dinners. I peel the shrimp (leaving the tails on) so that the shrimp can really pick up the garlic/olive oil marinade, as well as the delicious sauce that's tossed with the shrimp.

SOOO yummy and so fast! We tried some shrimp pre-peeled, and others with the shells on, and couldn't discern the difference so I will prepeel them in the future.

I give this one four forks because of its yummy flavor and ease of preparation. My family didn't like having to peel the shrimp at the table though. I'll try peeling it before grilling next time.

So simple, yet so incredibly flavorful! I peeled the shrimp before marinating, which didn't dry them out and enhanced the flavor.

I served it all over rice -- perfection!

We enjoyed this dish, but didn't find it all that spicy at first.

I'm from Louisiana, so I'm always skeptical of dishes dubbed "New Orleans style", because true cajun cuisine isn't easy to make. But THIS shrimp dish could have been made by Emeril himself!

Obviously those of you who are calling for a reduction in the amount of butter have never actually been to New Orleans and ordered this dish! It's supposed to be decadent. Half the reason of ordering this dish is to sop up the left over spiced butter with a baguette and lick whatever else you missed off of your fingers and elbows. Cayenne pepper should be added to this recipe, to taste, to make it more authentic and flavorful. If you want low-fat, never attempt anything with "ew Orleans, Cajun, or Southern-style" in the name.

I think it is the best of all the many "New Orleans Style" BBQ shrimp recipes we have tried. Because it has chili pepper and not cayenne it is not searingly hot. We grilled with shells on but deveined. Plenty of flavor. To answer the previous question: yes, it would improve the texture of the sauce if the butter were clarified first, but without that extra step, the flavor is still GREAT! I don't think I've ever seen so many reviews of a recipe in such a short time. Gourmet editors take note...give us more easy, flavorful recipes.

These are great! -- and the closest I've found to true Louisiana BBQ shrimp. I removed the shells before cooking and broiled in oven per instructions -- they were tender and succulent, and far less messy than shells-on. Heated leftovers (there weren't many) the next morning and served over garlic cheese grits -- another winner. This is a keeper.

Haven't tried it yet...will do so in about a month...but I wonder whether I should clarify the butter. Any thoughts?

This recipe was easy and great! Out of all the different New Orleans barbecued shrimp recipes out there, this is the one that has comes closest to the real thing that I had down in New Orleans at Pascal's Manale sans the head and shells. Bravo!

This was a different and fairly tasty shrimp recipe. I have to say I would tweak it next time I make it. Probably substitute half of the chili powder with Old Bay seasoning. It was pretty spicy, so I have to admire those who went even hotter. Did follow suggestions to peel the shrimp first, and it came out fine--not dry. Added extra lemon juice, but besides that I followed the recipe. I would make it again, but like Frank Sinatra--my way.

Nice try Jim...I went to your website...you offer no recipe for your's that is "much better". You only offer your sauce for sale. Shame on you for using Epicurious web site for free advertising!

I didn't see any reviews by cooks in N'awlins. The native cooks in southern LA do not devein or behead the shrimp prior to bqing in broiler, stove top or grill. Try cooking them "whole" - they are infinitely tastier and faster to prepare.

I made this for a barbecue dinner. It was very easy and the ingredients are ones that many people would have on hand. I liked it a lot, as did my guests. My husband thought it could use more kick. I'd play around with a bit when I make it next time.

This was the first time I have ever made something for guests without a "test run" and it was wonderful. I also used 2 pounds of really big shrimp and increased the butter and olive oil. I put tabasco out so everyone could spice it up to their own taste.

I have made this recipe several times and we have loved it each time. I use "jumbo-jumbo" shrimp(really large ones), deveined with the shells split and left on (I think I bought them at BJ's, frozen in a bag). I don't skewer the shrimp, just lay them on a grill sheet (the metal pan with holes in it) on the gas grill. After marinating with olive oil & garlic, I toss them with some of the butter-chili sauce, saving the remiander to add to the rice which I cook as an accompaniment. Season the rice with fresh ground black pepper and scallions, then add some of the butter sauce. It's wonderful, although you have to be able to not let the butter, etc. make you feel guilty. A delicious treat for special occasions (the shrimp are pricey and the calories exorbitant--but the flavor is wonderful!)

This is supposed to be casual messy food. I like the Mr B's Bistro (New Orleans) recipe better. Go to their website, the recipe is provided. It is done on the stove top, so no scewering and dealing with the grill. Once you've mixed up some creole seasoning, recipe provided, the dish is a 15 minute meal. Can't beat that for a busy day. My entire family loves the Mr B's version, it's the only way my dh eats shrimp in fact. We serve huge portions in a large shallow bowl, with tons of french bread for dipping into the sauce. Nothing better. Use Mr B's. Oh yeah, and leave the shells on! That's where the flavor is, that and it's part of the fun, food always tastes better when it's messy.

What's all the nitpickin about the shells for? Acadians eat shrimp shell and all unlike them pasnickety Creoles. Shells hold in the flavor tight and gives a good crunch to the shrimp! Don't you go peelin soft shell crabs neither cherie - ruins a bon hommes appetite.

I haven't made this recipe yet, but I just had to comment on the cook from NYC on 7/23/03. Man, you are hilarious! Poop chute; no kidding. (It is pretty gross when the shrimp is not deveined.)

Rating: 2
Did you ever have a recipe that you thought was pretty good, but you probably wouldn't make again? That's this one for me (a 2 1/2 forker). The shrimp were very good cooked in the shells (deveined first), on the grill. The sauce was interesting too, although I livened it up using hot chili powder and cayenne. I just think that the butter made it way too heavy and might use the spice combination in some other way.

Rating: 2
Disappointing. I was expecting a flavorful dish but it really was ho-hum. The ingredients sound great but they did nothing spectacular to the shrimp. I have many great shrimp recipies to make this again. I don't get the 4 forks ratings at all.

Rating: 4
very tasty. I also used shelled shrimp. Since mine were on the small side, I used a wok grill pan which worked well. I used cayenne for some of the black pepper and added some hot pepper flakes. Next time I will omit the pepper flakes. Will definitely make again.

After reading through all the reviews, I settled on this: I used shelled shrimp, used the sauce as a second marinade before grilling, cut the worcestershire WAY back and added hot sauce. I used a perforated grill pan instead of skewers. The butter did cause quite a flare-up at first but I cooked the shrimp very quickly and it gave them a wonderful smoky flavor. They were not overcooked at all and were delicious. Thanks for all the tips.

We really enjoyed this shrimp. As long as you are careful to not overcook, peeling the shrimp (before marinating) seems to work fine. We served the sauce on the side.

Rating: 2
Absolutely loved the sauce, although I'll double it next time and throw in a few fresh herbs. I did, however, peel the grilled shrimp so that i could toss them with the sauce -- we wanted to sit down and EAT the dish rather that eat, peel, eat, peel, etc...

Rating: 3
I knew we would like it. The sauce is almost identical to a recipe we make. We pour the sauce on a salmon filet and bake until done - about 20 minutes at 350, basting once or twice.

Very, very good. I peeled the shrimp as some the others and had no problems (just watch closely not to overcook). Used chipotle powder and relaced half the black pepper with cayenne -wow! Also, basted the shirmp with the sauce before and early on the grill. Outstanding.

My husband,who loves shrimp,would probably give this 4 forks.I was halfway through peeling the shrimp,leaving the tail and last sections on, when I realized that the shells were supposed to stay on.No matter.They were still good,flavorful,not dry.The sauce was fine as is,although more lemon and/or a dash of tabasco wouldn't have hurt it a bit.If you decide to peel prior to cooking,you can simply pour the sauce over the finished shrimp.

This is a wonderfully, messy, decadent, spicy masterpiece. People can't stop eating it. Provide plenty of napkins and prepare for a lull in the conversation as everyone digs in. Highly recommended!

My boyfriend made this for me last night and it was excellent. Served it over cajun style rice. He marinated and then also basted the shrimp while grilling. Mmmmmm...

I began making according to directions, but as things progressed, I started making all the changes you have suggested...added hot sauce to brighten flav. and colour, more lemon (I like acid), and replaced half of black pepper with big pinch of ground habenero (l prefer chili pepper heat). End result was excellent - but next time, I will listen to you guys first! Also, based on your research and replies, I would pre-peel. My hand got my beer bottle too slimy as is!

Rating: 2
As an experiment, I pealed 1/2 the shrimp before marinating and grilling. The pealed ones were just as tender and had more flavor. However, the sauce really needed "something", and both my husband and I agreed this was just ok. I've grilled much better shrimp in the past.

The shrimp are really good skewered with the garlic and oil marinade but I didn't care for the sauce at all. I served the sauce separately and no one really liked it - maybe too much Worc. sauce?

The marinade is good. However, we taste tested this sauce against our standby (melted butter, minced garlic, parsley, and hot sauce). Because of the rave reviews, we had high hopes for this chili sauce. We were disapointed.

Very good. Instead of tossing the shrimp in the butter-chili powder mixture I just served it as a dip. This recipe was enjoyed by all!

Of course one should devein the shrimp. It can and does affect the taste. You could probably get away without deveining small shrimp (redundant?), but the larger the shrimp, the larger the poop chute. I often prepare jumbo and prawn-sized shrimps, and their veins can have the circumference of a no. 2 pencil lead! Besides, it's ugly.

Absolutely awesome! It is hard to get New Orleans style seafood in Iowa, so we made our own. Used mesquite chips on the gas grill, as suggested. I like spicy, so next time I will reduce black pepper by 1/2 t. and use 1/2 t. Cayenne. My 12 yr old daughter gobbled this down. We tossed finished shrimp and butter sauce with linguine and served with salad and french bread. Yummy!

this recipe was delicious and easy to make and flexible as far as preperation time and spicyness. I started to prepare the marinade and had to walk away for it, so I put it in the refrigerator and completed it 3 hours later and it was still delicious. Also I was able to control how hot to make it by adding less chili powder.

Delicious. Used ancho chile pepper and dried chipotle chili pepper as well. The sauce was terrific to mop up with bread.

Like one of the previous commentators, I first marinaded the shrimp in the oil/garlic mixture, then in the chili pepper/pepper/Worcestshire/lemon mixture. Then I brushed the rest on while grilling. Make sure the grill is HOT and that you've soaked your wood skewers in water beforehand! This was a big hit, with black beans and rice.

Bought the shrimp from the local fresh seafood market. Absoulutely fantastic. We decided next time to double the sauce recipe so we can enjoy an Italian fondue (bread dipping). Also peeled the shrimp & cleaned them (cause we don't eat poop either).

This was great! I handled the ingredients differently, however. I first marinated the shrimp in the garlic mixture, then in the spice mixture (without shells), and grilled them. This way, you have terrific flavor, as well as the texture of grilled shrimp instead of a sauce.

This sounds good and we'll make it soon - but wanted to let others know it's a variation of the Bayou Shrimp recipe on this site; a fantastic recipe that we've been making and greatly enjoying for years. Sounds like what many of you are describing - Give it a try!

Rating: 0
have not tried this yet, but sounds adequate. Spices nice and is a version of NO barbecued shrimp. The shell is esential. It contributes to the flavor and keeps the shrimp moist. If you can't deal with peeling shrimp at the table, don't fix this.Also, deveining is only cosmetic. Get over it girl. It is the GI tract, but shrimp do not eat what we do. They fest on plankton. Not neraly as messy and nasty. I only devein shrips when Yankees are coming to dinner. Enjoy!

Rating: 0
Haven't tried yet but will. There is a product called the Shrimp Butler that actually slits the shrimp down the back & helps devein. About $30 or so and it works!

Rating: 3
This is a simple way to make shrimp different. Someone said that deveining the shrimp was simply for looks. I don't think that's true, a big fat black vein is ugly and adds awful flavor and texture. After all it's the GI tract. An easy way to devein and leave the shell on is to use kitchen shears. Stick one blade in the opening where the vein starts, snip, snip and pull out the vein. Easy.

Great recipe, a variation on New Orleans BBQ shrimp. My wife is from New Orleans, and if you ever have the authentic dish, it will be made with the shells on. It is very messy, but delicious.

Rating: 3
Simpler than Emeril's recipe, but rather similar in many ways. Better thing to do is to shell the shrimp (saves the mess of doing so during the meal), then cook them in the sauce to pull that extra flavor out. Before serving, the sauce, which needs a bit of cream to "neutralize" the calories of all that butter, can be strained and the grilled shrimp served in it over rice or pasta. With a cold Blackened Voodoo Beer, you'll be in hog heaven.

This recipe turned out better than I expected. I had already bought shelled shrimp before I had decided what to do with them. Followed the recipe exactly with the addition of some Frank's Hot Sauce. Next time, I would add a little more hot sauce and a little less Worcestershire sauce. Cooking without the shells on worked fine, just watch them so they don't over cook. No shells made for much less mess during eating.

Rating: 0
Haven't tried the recipe yet, but can't wait. Just a comment. Save time by not deveining the shrimp. It's done only for "looks" anyway. I've eaten lots of shrimp with the vein in and it doesn't affect the taste at all. (P.S. I hope I don't get attacked for not trying the recipe before commenting!)

VERY YUMMY! This was definitely NOT something you'd want to eat while trying to impress anyone as it's a real in-it-up-to-your-elbows kind of thing, but it was SCRUMPTIOUS! The fact that it was quick n' easy to prepare was a bonus. I added a little more lemon juice(1.5 x)and 1/4 tsp of cayenne for extra heat. I also freshly ground my black pepper for maximum flavour - other than that, it was straight from the recipe. Served this with a simple side of steamed green beans with lemon juice and a basket of fresh italian bread - mmmmmmmm........

I agree with the other reviewers. These shrimp are terrific. I too grilled on a perforated grilling screen rather than skewers (much easier and faster). We left the shells on as indicated, and grilled them enough so that the shells were almost black and crispy and delicious. Peel if you must, but you'll lose a lot of the flavor, and the shells are crunchy and delicious. Go ahead - be adventurous!

Wow. Easy for a weeknight - I tossed the shrimp on a perforated grilling screen instead of skewering. For late-arriving husband, threw his portion of shrimp into the saucepan w/ sauce and kept warm that way. Had sliced melon as well as warm bread. Terrific!

Fabulous and easy!!! I used jumbo shrimp, we split the backs per the recipe, grilled them, and then cut them in half down the middle. 3/4 pound (entree for two) of our jumbo, on sale shrimp was only 8 shrimp and this made them really easy to peel plus made it look like more. I served a salad to start and then grilled some garlic bread to serve with the shrimp. A super and fast dinner, messy but totally delicious. We really liked the larger shrimp and would make it like that again as opposed to the shrimp in the recipe.

To Toronto, They mean to devien but instead of removing the shell which you would normally do, to leave it on. So just snip up the back remove the vein but not the shell. Hope that helps, happy cooking.

Alright, I admit my role in the kitchen is usually limited to sous-chef (my husband is the reigning master cook) but I don't believe I'm a TOTAL dunce. But the first part of the recipe has me puzzled. Are we merely to devein the shrimp, or is it something more complex that I'm just not getting. Help, please!

This is a great dish! And, easy too! My husband grew up in the south and remembers a similar dish... "Barbequed Shrimp". But, he said this was sooo... much better than he remembers. We did shrimp on grill in shells, but laying on foil instead of skewering them. They were amazing and a good crusty french bread is a must for "mopping the sauce". Cannot wait to try again.

Made this as an appetizer for a family dinner. Left out the chili powder for the sake of the kids. The dish was excellent and all of the adults and kids (ages 4-11) gobbled it up. We grilled the shrimp without the shells and they weren't tough at all - just be careful to watch them so they are removed as soon as they are done. Also, added extra garlic to the marinade. There can never be too much garlic. Served the leftover sauce over rice - it was delicious.
