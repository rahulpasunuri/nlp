This is a horrible recipe... how on earth did it make it on to Epicurious? WAY too much vinegar and nothing at all about it is Asian except for a little soy sauce.

Did not like at all. All I could taste was vinegar.

I too used the rice wine vinegar, though we used it exclusively. Just a gentler vinegar taste. My four year old, who won't eat anything with a sauce on it, was dipping his green beans in it and gave it "ten thumbs up". It's been officially put into rotation. There's a nice bite, but it's all very subtle. And even though there's a ton of garlic in it, you can still talk to other people when you're done. Really, really good.

I am not a big fan of tangy things, and with the vinegar in this recipe, the chicken was extremely tangy. If I were to make this again, I would change the recipe to move the taste more towards a teriyaki by adding something like brown sugar.

This has now become a huge favorite for my kids ages 7,6 and 4. I use 1/4 cup rice wine vinegar as well and in order to keep the liquid balance increased the chicken broth to 2/3 cup and added more soy and a little more sesame oil. We also love garlic so generally I use a whole head of garlice for 5 chicken breasts.

Here is what you do to reduce the vinegar taste. My husband loves this recipe and I make it at least 3x a month. Use 1/4 cup rice vinegar and 1/4 cup white vinegar. This should help with the taste, also add a lot more garlic.

This recipe was very quick and easy. But it was too much of a vinegar taste for me. I will try to make this again but with a lot less vinegar.

Rating: 3
This was quick and easy for a weeknight meal. Followed the advice of others and halved the vinegar, upped the soy. Still too vinegar-y for me (maybe my low quality soy??). Next time will try splash of Balsamic instead, per another reviewer. Added about 1 T minced fresh ginger and 1-2 t hot pepper flakes. Also 1 T nam pla. Served over Jasmine rice, garnished with chopped cilantro. Might like to add some veggies next time too. Two out of three kids loved this, even 'tho it was a little spicy.

This recipe is delish and oh-so-easy to make. It's now on my list of quick and easy favorites.

Delicious, quick and simple. I add about a tablespoon of fresh ginger to the sauce and some red pepper flakes. Also try serving it with some steamed broccoli or throw in some julienne carrots during the 10 minute simmer period. Wonderful and full of flavor!

Loved this recipe. Very easy to make. Next time I will reduce the amount of vinegar a little to take out the slight bitterness of the sauce though.

I also halved the vinegar and doubled the soy. The meal turned out excellent.

I, like many others, chose to use quater a cup of vineger insted of a half. I also used twice as much soy sauce as required as well (come on, make it more "asian"). This really is a fantastic dish. It went quite nicely with a Pinot Blac by the way ;). This is a very easy meal to make and would recomend this to experienced and novice cooks alike.

After reading all the reviews I used 1/4 cup of vinegar. 1/2 cup would have been too much for my taste. This is not a spectacular dish but it was easy to make and different.

I agree that this recipe is a reasonable facsimile of chicken adobo. Since I spent eight years in the Philippines, I am certainly going to make this again. Allow me to offer the following adjustments to the recipe. If you wish to thicken the sauce with corn starch, do so lightly. I would agree that it could use a little less vinegar and I added a little more soy sauce. For some extra picquant flavor, add about 1/4 teaspoon of peppercorns. Bone-in chicken is usable- extend the frying time. I find sesame oil very heavy- use canola and add a dash of sesame, if desired. Ideally, I would pair this dish with vegetable spring rolls.

This is basically Chicken Adobo, a much-beloved Filipino dish. Very delish and easy to make. Every time I bring this to work my colleagues always want me to share. A couple of the posters below complained about what they say is a strong vinegar taste. It is if you're used to bland food such as macaroni and cheese and think most food beyond American cuisine is too spicy. The sauce here is wonderfully zesty and piquant - definitely not ho-hum. You can thicken the sauce at the end, which improves this recipe. Mix one tablespoon of cornstarch with two tablespoons of water, then add that to the sauce once it's reduced a little, stirring vigorously.

Overall a pretty good recipe. Heavy on the vinegar and the sauce didn't quite reduce as much as I liked. In the future I will add more spice, less vinegar (maybe just a little more garlic!), but overall a good base recipe to have a wonderful meal.

Rating: 1
The sauce was dominated by the vinegar. I made the recipe as written except that I subsituted half of the vinegar with rice wine vinegar and it was still too strong.

Rating: 3
I really enjoyed this recipe! I did cut down on the vinegar and used both olive and Sesame oil. When I was simmering this sauce down I used arrowroot instead of cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I also added in Sugarsnap peas, broccolli, carrots and spinach. Spectacular!

This dish was delicious and quick. I used Nakkano seasoned rice vinegar w/red peppers. After the dish was complete I added 2-3 tablespoons of corn starch to thicken the sauce.This added 4-5 extra minutes of cooking time. Served over rice. Next time I will add broccoli or peas.

My boyfriend loved this recipe!!! He said it was very flavorful and even ate my portion I didn't finish. I also changed the vinegar portion. I added 1/4 cup white vinegar and 1/4 rice vinegar and added some sugar. I also steamed some carrots, mushrooms and snow peas and put some of the sauce on it. It's fairly easy to prepare and tastes yummy!!!

This was a great dish. Chicken can be very boring, this one isn't. Not only if made correctly, lends itself to a nice presentation. The Asian green bean salad was a good complement.

BORING! Smelled better than it tasted. What a waste of time, effort and chicken. The only good thing about it was making chicken salad with the abundance of leftovers. A bit too much to go through for chicken salad.

I've been tinkering with this recipe for months using suggestions from some of the other reviewers. I just finished making it tonight using Liz from New Orleans suggestions and it was absolutely perfect! No more experimentation needed. Thank you, Liz!

This recipe was great, I split the vinegar between rice vinegar and white vinegar and it's awesome. Don't boil it down too much.

Rating: 3
I read all the reviews and took the advice of those who modified the recipe. I doubled the sauce while only using the single amt. of vinegar. I used a half and half mixture of white balsamic (slightly sweet), and rice wine vinegar. I seasoned the chicken with Tony Chachere's seasoning in the green box. I added about 1 and 1/2 tablespoons of sugar and 1 tablespoon of cornstarch into the sauce mixture to thicken slightly. Also, it was suggested to use mushrooms, so I did a very brief saute of some sliced mushrooms and sliced onions and added that to the chicken after I cooked it. I then added the sauce. Wonderful.

Added a splash of balsamic vinegar instead of amount in recipe. Very tasty asian dish. I've made it several times and it always tastes good.

What a great dish! We love Asian food and this was a great variation. I cut the vinegar with 1/4 cup of lemon juice (a bit much if you don't like it that strong), and added mustard, as recommended by an earlier reviewer. I also added a pinch of curry, which added a hint of spiciness. I also seasoned the chicken with lemon pepper. We used the juices in a gravy boat and had it over the rice, which was outstanding. Can't wait to serve it again

This is a simple dish, with great flavor. Use a good quality soy sauce, and add about a half tablespoon of dijon mustard. I also used a combination of 1/4 cup white vinegar, the juice of 1/2 a lemon, and good chinese rice vinegar to make up the rest of the 1/2+ cup called for. All-in-all a good dish.

Good, easy. Would double sauce recipe and put some honey in it to cut the intensity of the vinegar

Very tasty and very simple to make. I added sliced capsicum and coriander to the sauce. Didn't find it too vinegary at all. Will be making it again.

Edible, but not very good. I agree that this recipe is too vinegary as written. I expected to like it because I love garlic and vinegar, but I was sorely disappointed. I wouldn't make it again without adjusting the vinegar.

I added a pinch of cayenne pepper to the sauce to add a little hot spice to it and I enjoyed it more. I like spicy food, some may not. Don't worry about the 10 garlic cloves, they do not create a heavy taste at all.

Very good. Use rice wine vinegar, and double the sauce for 5 chicken breasts. I didn't find this too vinegary at all, nor too Asian, but it was very tasty. I used sliced white mushrooms, 1-2 T brown sugar at end, the scallions, and 1 T cornstarch dissolved in 1 T water. Definitely will make this again.

This was not dish I would try again. I thought it fair but my husband hated it.. too vinegary.

An easy, different way to prepare chicken breasts. Very tasty and garlicky. I used rice vinegar instead, and seasoned my chicken breasts with dried basil and pepper as I did not have seasoning mix. Turned out well. Next time I'll add a vegetable.

Been there. Done that. Didn't like it. Won't do it again. I did sub sherry vinegar for white distilled. That's for pickles! We LOVE Chinese food. This was NOT good!

Excellent garlic flavor. A snap to make! A little more chicken stock, and a bit of sugar made it divine. The only thing is---it made me so incredibly GASSY, and almost immediately, that I had to exclude myself from all human company for HOURS! As it turns out, my husband had the same reaction. And when I had the sauce over some rice as a leftover (which was also delicious), it happened again! I think I'll have to limit this dish to a hermit-like situation, although the flavor will tempt me to do so frequently. Oh, the decisions we have to make.

I used rice wine vinegar and added mushrooms when simmering the pan juices. This is very tasty and very garlicky if you're not a big fan of garlic you may want to cut it down a little. I added some Mrs. Dash to the cooked rice to perk it up a little its a fast easy dish. Yummy!

This was a very easy and fast. I used white wine vinegar and next time I will try adding mushrooms and green onion. Mine came out a little salty as I did not use the low-salt chicken broth and I used a herb mix with salt, next time I will watch the salt.

Why use white vinegar when sherry wine or white wine vinegar would improve the flavor.

Rating: 1
A little too much vinegar. I might try a variation by reducing the vinegar by 1/2 and adding a little sugar (more of a sweet/sour flavor), green onion and cornstarch (to make a sauce that stays with the dish) to the vinegar mixture. I would also marinate the chicken in this mixture before seasoning and sauteeing.

Good flavor.. added 1/4 c chopped green onions to the sauce. I also marinated the chicken in the sauce then continued with the recipe. Served it with bok choy sauteed in a little chicken broth, fresh ginger and 1T fish sauce.
