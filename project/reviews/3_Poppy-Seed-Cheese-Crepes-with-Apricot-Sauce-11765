I know I'm in the minority here, but the cheese filling was just way too sweet for me. I grew up eating store-bought frozen cheese blintzes and I was hoping for a sweetness level along those lines. I will try making these again (the crepes were beautiful), but I'll be reducing the sugar in the filling significantly. Instead of the apricot sauce I made candied kumquats to sprinkle over the crepes.

"Cheese" probably refers to "yogurt cheese," which is what drained yogurt is sometimes called. Or maybe there's an ingredient missing--ricotta, goat, or mascarpone cheese would all be great additions!

Nope. Good question.

Anyone know why "cheese" is in the title of the recipe?

So delicious! We make them every Saturday morning now! I didn't have apricots so I just made a blueberry sauce with cornstarch, honey and water and it was wonderful!

Yum! I made only the crepes and not the filling, though. Appropriate crepe texture/consistency, tantalizing lemon zest fragrance, appealing visual (poppy seed) presentation.

Excellent crepes! I made this for a brunch for 50 people and, making the crepes ahead of time, it worked very well. I changed a few things; first, I used vanilla yogurt and drained for only an hour or two. It was that much faster than taking plain and adding sugar and vanilla. Also, I used a different apricot sauce, using apple juice, dried apricots and cinnamon and then pureed it. Very good. The crepes themselves were fabulous and well worth the effort. They froze beautifully and, though they took a while, really added something to the meal. I would definitely make this one again.
