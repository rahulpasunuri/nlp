So good that I will increase quantities next time. This is a very refined way to prepare root vegetables. The small chop makes for quick cooking. Might want to chop a bit larger to reflect chunks of the short ribs and increase cooking time.

Nice winter side dish.I used chicken stock instead of veal and it worked fine.

Yummy! Served it with thick juicy rib steaks. And good red wine. Like the other gentleman... on a cold winter night. It is hearty and yet subtle. Loved it! Home made brown stock is a must, I would say. The glaze is spectacular, sweet and.. delicious!

I served this with a roasted boneless pork loin on a snowy day - I replaced the veal stock with Beef stock. It was perfect winter confort food - the house smelled wonderfully all day!
