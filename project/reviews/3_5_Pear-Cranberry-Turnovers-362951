I made this using pears, plums and a peach. I added a touch of cinnamon and nutmeg. I did not use the lemon zest. It was fantastic but i did have trouble folding the first one. I will make A Lot with different fruit that is in season.

I forgot to buy phyllo dough so I made it with empanada crust and it was delicious

Really easy to make and very good, BUT I have no idea how to fold a flag so my turnovers looked nothing like what is shown. Step-by-step illustration would have helped out. Also, there was not nearly enough filling for 8, I stretched it to 4 (assuming my turnovers were even remotely close to how they were supposed to be folded).

To A Cook From The USA: The problem must be with your sifter. It seems to be full of mocking bird poop.

I'm having a real problem sifting the melted powdered sugar. It clogs up my sifter.

Nice, but I would add a bit of nutmeg or some sweet spice to the pear mixture if I make it again. The pear needed something more than just the lemon zest.

Excellent recipe, the lemon zest was the perfect touch, added a great crispness to the turnover. I did not add the powedered sugar on top as suggested, and the taste was perfect, I perfer a less sweet treat. Will make again.
