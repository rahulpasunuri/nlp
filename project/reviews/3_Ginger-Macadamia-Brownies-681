I would add more crystallized ginger next time.

I was so excited to make these and I baked them just until the toothpick was clean! But i didn't taste the ginger at all and the brownies were a bit dry and bitter... I wonder if a different kind of chocolate should have been used.

These brownies are dense, delicious and filling. The ginger adds flavor and the macadamia nuts have a wonderful texture.

These brownies were excellent. They were very fudgy and a bit heavy, so smaller pieces are recommended. None of the flavors overpowered the others. I do agree though, it's a more sophisticated taste. These are the brownies you make if you don't want your kids to eat them all up on you.
