Like others, I infused the herbs with the garlic and butter and I had truffle butter on hand, so added that instead of regular butter. Turned out great.

Wow. This is surprisingly delicious. I didn't have celery salt so I just made do with regular salt. I also infused the herbes in the butter with the garlic like another reviewer.

I have made this several times and have always received rave reviews, even from picky eaters. It is very rich though, I might reduce the butter a little bit next time.

i really liked this recipe and infused the celery salt like some of the other comments. i ended up making my own celery salt with celery seeds and sea salt, and my boyfriend whipped up our own herbes de Provence, by mincing and mixing basil, thyme, parsley and rosemary.

I skipped the celery salt (not my fav) and let the herbs infuse in the butter. I also added grated Parmesan. Results tasty, fancy.

I let the herbs and celery seeds infuse in the butter to awaken them. I think that made it better than just adding the dried herbs at the end.

I've never made this recipe exactly but it's really just popcorn with herbes de Provence, which I do make often. I just thought I'd up the rating because it's really yummy and I know I judge recipes from the ratings. I also like to add grated stinky hard cheese too. Not everyone will like it but I say, weird popcorn = yum.

Tasted like I was eating my spice drawer. The garlic and rosemary were an interesting addition but this recipe doesn't measure up to good, old-fashioned buttered popcorn.
