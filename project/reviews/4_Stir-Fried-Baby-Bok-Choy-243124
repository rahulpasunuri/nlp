Fast, easy and very good but reduce the salt and sugar down to .5 teaspoon.

No need to add water.

Delicious! I had some carrots to use up so I added those in here. Used crushed red pepper flakes instead of white pepper because that's what I had on hand, and we like things a bit spicy. I didn't have fresh ginger so used the ground stuff. I didn't add water -- the bok choy seemed to let off plenty of its own for steaming purposes and there would have been too much water on the bottom if I added it. I'm thinking of adding some toasted cashews and tofu to this and serving over rice for a complete dinner.

Good, but it's nothing out of this world. I will omit the water in the future. It's not necessary and makes the recipe watery.

I cut way back on the sugar and the salt (1/4 and 1/2 respectively), but otherwise followed it to the letter. Very nice! And such a lovely, light, fresh flavor!

Yes. I too was amazed at the buttery taste, as the reviewer earlier mentioned. I followed the recipe verbatim and loved it. I liked the amount of salt I used and I used ground black peppercorns because it's all I had. Delish! I had 3 baby bok choys and it seemed fine, but next time I'll try to add four so I'll have some leftovers. So good!

I've never ordered or made bok choy before. What I didn't realize is how butter this would be. I don't know if it's the bok choy or the peanut oil, but it was sooooo good! Everyone loved it.

This recipe is great! I cut the baby bok choy in half lengthwise and turned each piece cut-side down in the pan for a minute or so to get a wonderful color. It looks much prettier than chopping it up! Served on the same plate with seared scallops for a very attractive presentation.

Made this as written with bok choy from the garden. I'll make it again with half as much salt - this was good but way too salty! With less salt I'd give it 3 stars. Also, I don't think it needs any water added - I ended up with a lot of water in the pan.

Yum! It's a good thing I still have some bok choy in the refrigerator because I'm making this again tomorrow night! I followed the recipe as written except I used a touch of very hot Indian red pepper instead of the more subtle white pepper. Lots of flavor, a pretty green color and a slight crunch - I'll definitely make this again.

This was interesting, and a nice cooking technique, but the white pepper and salt were overwhelming.

very good. easy, fast and nice accompaniment to an asian meal. our whole family (except our five year old) loved it! would definitely make again.

Excellent, fast, easy. Didn't have peanut oil so used grape seed oil with no issues. Excited to try with the flavor of peanut oil. Definitely make again (using tad less salt).

Just terrific: Easy, tasty, healthy, fast. I honestly don't know how much bok chow I used. It was 4 large babies. I eyeballed therefore only 1/4 teaspoon salt, sugar, black pepper only about 1/8 or less. Everything else was as directed, though I mixed all the ingredients in the pan before adding the bok choy.

This was absolutely delicious. My boyfriend and I both commented on the buttery taste of the dish, even though there was no butter at all. We used a red onion instead of scallions, ground black pepper instead of white and a pinch of ground ginger instead of the real deal. Still soooo good.

Tasted great with seared tuna (w/chili oil and soy sauce). Didn't have peanut oil which I think really adds a lot to the taste, so I used olive oil. I needed goggles to cook through the smoke, and didn't read past ingredient list, so I didn't add the water or cover the pan, I just pretended I was using a wok and kept tossing it with tongs for a couple of minutes. It still turned out fine and dandy, and it's easy and fast.

Delicious & easy. I used honey instead of sugar. I didn't have scallions, so I used an onion. I used regular ground pepper (not white). I probably had a tad more onion and ginger than called for, and it was great.

Excellent! Two of us ate the entire thing (partly because the Steamed Scallion-Ginger Fish Fillets was so terrible). I used all the bok choy I had, which was almost two pounds, and I had to split it into two batches so it would fit into my large salad spinner. I also used Splenda instead of sugar, so it fit our nutritional requirements. I definitely will make this again and again.

I could never do delicious greens, now I can. Love this recipe

I am always skeptical of a simple recipe, like a dish needs a ton of secret ingredients to be good. But this was very simple, very fast, and delicious! Great flavor. I've never known how to cook bok choy & from now on I'll reference this. I blended the salt, sugar, and white pepper together before adding to the pan per other reviewer's suggestion. Would maybe add a touch less sugar next time, and some red pepper flakes. Oh, and I didn't have scallions, so I used regular white onion.

So simple and delicious! I spiked it with some chili oil, and added mushrooms.Served with spicy hoisin chicken, white rice, and cucumber salad. Perfect weeknight meal.

Delicious and Healthy! My husband liked it better than some of his unhealthy foods. Now that is hard to beat, I will definitely make again.

I have passed this recipe before because I thought from the simple list of ingredients that this would be boring. Then I way overbought on bok choy and needed something to do with it so I turned to this dish and it was perfect. I followed the recipe exactly as is.

This is easy and FABULOUS. Have made it several times.

i really think this wonderful with just a few changes.as other recipes suggested...i substituted 1 tbs of butter for one of the oil butter....i substituted 1 tbs chicken broth for the water then stir fried it for a minute or two and didn't cover dish but served it tender crisp. it has a lovely delicate taste.

Please do not pay attention to my previous review as it was not the dish that I thought I was reviewing.

We are swooning over this dish. It is the best! We had everything but the 5- spice, but that was not an issue. We did find the sauce a little dry and added a small amount of chicken broth, which worked out well. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Fast, simple and great fresh flavor and color--the bok choy stays a brilliant green. We skipped the sugar, added thinly sliced mushrooms to the stir-fry and green onions as a garnish on the plate. Really like the overall lightness of the dish--it's not oily or sweet at all. Really great for a hot apartment, because the burner only has to be on for about three minutes!

quick, easy, yummy. I have made it a couple times now and feel that the recipe can be tweeked here and there to your liking and is still hard to screw up.

This recipe is fantastic. A perfect compliment to Asian-inspired meals. I paired this with broiled miso tofu and white rice. Things I'm going to try next time: 1) Mix the sugar, salt, and white pepper together prior to throwing into the pan. I didn't and I ended up with patches of flavor (didn't want to overcook the bok choy - so ended up undermixing). 2) Use twice the white pepper next time. Maybe twice white pepper and sugar...

Great. I had some local organic baby bok choy and did not know what to do with it and this was quick and easy. I would use 1/2 the salt next time.
