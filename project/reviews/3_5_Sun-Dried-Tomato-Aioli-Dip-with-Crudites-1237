I made this dip yesterday to accompany a family dinner. I served it with carrots, celery and snap peas. It was tremendous! I followed other suggestions, 1/2'ed it and used all roasted garlic, sun-dried julienne tomatoes, not in oil. Added 1/8 cup olive oil to processor along with all ingredients. Added a smidgen of herbes de provence. Used Greek yogurt 2/3, 1/3 sr cream. Tasted awful right after processing and WONDERFUL 8 hrs later. Flavors need time to get acquainted. Garlic lovers only. Tastes great on crackers too!

I served this to a small group of women friends and it went over relatively well. I enjoyed it, but my friends and I agreed that this tasted low-fat. I'd make it again for my family or for small groups of friends, but for entertaining larger groups I prefer to serve dishes that don't taste diet-conscious.

I wish I had headed the warnings, and roasted the garlic, as the raw garlic was overpowering. Will definately try this one again. I used 6oz of tomatoes and added some roasted red peppers too.

I really wanted to like this dip, but I definitely didn't. The garlic overpowered it in my opinion...and I love garlic! It just didn't have the pizzaz I thought it would.

Good to make for lunch. I just brought some with assorted veggies and it is a great, light, healthy meal.

Having made classic aiolis before, I was a little apprehensive about the decidedly "un-classic" list of ingredients here. Based on the number of good reviews and the high rating, I decided to give it a try. I'm really glad I did because this was fantastic! I made this for a famlly gathering this weekend along with the caesar dip from this site and a large variety of assorted crudites, crackers, & crouton "sticks". The only change I made was to half the recipe. Everyone loved and it all disappeared. No one guessed (until I told them later) that this was low-fat! Will certainly make again!

I made this recipe before a trip to use up my cottage cheese and yogurt and it was such a pleasant surprise! I'm a big fan of garlic so I wasn't taken aback by the amount I had to put in--then again, I also halved the recipe. I had to wrangle it from my roommates so I'd have some to take on the plane!

Had no time to let the flavors blend so I roasted my garlic. Used sour cream instead of yogurt. Next time I will make half as much, the amount is a little ridiculous. Otherwise we loved it, and definatly will make it again!

I made this recipe last night and it was wonderful. However, I HAD to make a change. I could not believe that any dip could have 6 cloves of garlic - at least we knew the vampires wouldn't be visiting. I did as another review suggested and pan roasted the garlic first. It was delicious. I did crush and add one small unroasted clove. Next time, I won't bother. Here it is the day after and I can still taste it and I'm not a garlic wimp. I used this as a topping for a grilled vegetable platter and as I said before it was really great. Enjoy!

I couldn't find oil packed sun dried tomatoes, so soaked regalar sun drieds and added a little oil. The consistency was fine, tasted fine, but was not a very pretty color. I think that the oil packed tomatoes would have given it a more attractive red color.

I made this just as the recipe says and it was wonderful. Served it at an 'all cooks' party and they all wanted the recipe. Would probably add more tomatoes next time - that would be the only change.

This was GREAT! I made some changes - I only used yogurt, and I roasted the garlic beforehand. This is easy to do - just put the cloves in a frying pan with the skins still on and let them cook until the skins are slightly burnt. They are ready when tender. It makes the taste milder. I couldn't stop eating it!

I modified this recipe to make it more velvety. I use half organis whole milk yoghurt and half real mayonnaise instead of the nonfat yoghurt. I also use organic whole milk cottage cheese, instead of nofat. For those on a low fat diet, the recipe as originally given is good. I like it because it can be easily modified to suit your own taste.

I've been trying to find some delicious snacky things to go with my baby-weight-loss diet and this definitely hit the spot. I halved the garlic and minced a large shallot. I used the oil packed tomatoes and even hubby likes it! I can't wait until 'snack' time today!!!

I used half the garlic & used 2/3 plain yogurt & 1/3 mayo. I let it meld overnite before serving with flat bread & haricot verts. Everyone loved it!

The garlic was over powering but my guests seemed to love it anyway. If I were to make again I'd scale back on the garlic just a bit and had more sun-dried tomatoes. It also is much better after sitting in the refrigerator over night.

This was wonderful! I served it at a cocktail Christmas party and everyone loved it.

A few changes I made to this recipe - I didn't really care about the "calorie-content", so I stuck with real cottage cheese, regular Best-Foods mayo, and as per another reviewers' suggestion, used regular sour cream instead of yogurt. I also added in about 50% more of sun-dried tomatoes, and left chunks here-and-there for more texture/flavor. Overall I would make this again, with these additions. Otherwise, the garlic is a little overpowering and it would be too plain.

We picked this recipe to make for a party based on its high recommendations from other reviewers. Luckily we made it a couple of hours ahead of time and tried it because it is awful. It has no taste, and is so horrible, we tried to save it by adding fresh pesto but it didn't help at all. We ended up throwing it out rather than serve it to guests.

Used half the garlic, and it still had a kick. Everyone loved it. Definately making this again.

Used this as a dip for steamed, chilled artichokes and it tasted great. I used regular sun dried tomatoes and added a bit of olive oil instead of the oil-packed tomatoes and loved the consistency. Makes a large amount...

I made this dip for my in-laws' surprise 40th anniversary party (which I catered with numerous recipes from the site, all of which received rave reviews), and it's now a family favorite. Instead of plain yogurt, which one reviewer found too tangy, I used low-fat sour cream. Perfect!

This was very tasty. I will definitely make it again.

very yummy & a bit hit with guests. Tip: cut down a bit on the raw garlic -- it can be overwhelming.

This was wonderful not only as a dip, but also as a sandwich spread! It went over very well at my party, and the next day, I made the most tasty ham sandwiches, using this dip as a spread. Very nice consistency and I served it with Italian breadsticks.

Made this for a Christmas party and everyone thought it was yummy. Easy, too.

I found the dip too tangy from the yogurt. The next time I made it, I decreased the amount of yogurt and increased the amount of mayo and it was better.

This is sure to become a recipe that I will use often. It was absolutely delicious!
