This is a great combination of flavors, but as written, it has way too much lemon juice--and I love lemon. The dressing is far too sour. I agree with the cook who suggested squeezing just a bit of lemon at first, then modifying from there.

This was amazing. Will make it again in a heartbeat! It would be an excellent side dish for a steak dinner.

If you can get a hold of ramps make this recipe as written using a bunch of whole cleaned ramps instead of garlic. I also substituted anchovy paste. This was great.

I have made this dish many times and it is a huge crowd pleaser. The mixture of the prosciutto, anchovies and lemon is amazing. However this is only for people with mature taste. The flavor is strong but AMAZING.

I did not have anchovies on hand but this salad was delicious without them. I also heated up some caesers dressing and this was just absolutely great. My husband loved it! I will definitely keep this one.

A sophisticated starter for people who like bold, assertive flavours with depth. Highly recommended albeit with modifications. I did not add any additional olive oil but sautéed the asparagus and prosciutto (the real thing) in the soffrito for a couple of minutes, then squeezed lemon juice to taste. This provides sufficient moisture and flavour to flavour the salad greens. Also, with real prosciutto, there is no need for additional salt. I will definitely make this again as part of a formal dinner later this spring. The next time, I will only add about half the prosciutto to the pan, saving the remainder to sprinkle over the finished, assembled plates. My guinea pigs were all highly complimentary about this dish.

Excellent! I added the anchovy oil to the skillet with the anchovies.

I made this recipe for a friend, but instead of baking the prosciutto, I cooked it with the garlic until it crisped up a bit. Turned out great, and my friend loved it. The flavors are bold, but that's what I like.

Very awesome. Pricey, but worth the effort. One word of caution, dunking the greens in ice water, as directed, causes the buds to release. This may look odd, but the end result is lovely. If you prefern the ends to remain intact, skip the ice treatment.

We did this salad for a large event and got rave reviews. I have been sending out copies of the recipe for days! The dressing is an amazing blend of textures and flavors. Simply wonderful. A perfect spring salad for a truly elegant event.
