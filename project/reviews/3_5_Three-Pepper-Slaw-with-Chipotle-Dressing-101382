I thought this was not spicy enough; the dressing was too sweet for my tastes. Also, I thought the flavors were much too separate; it didn't hang together as a whole. People picked at it but no one came back for seconds.

This is the best slaw I have ever tasted! The dressing is out of this world and would also be great on salads or with a little more mayo, on sandwiches. I didn't have jicama on hand so I used regular cabbage, lime juice instead of lemon and cilantro instead of parsley. I can't rave enough about how good this is!!!

To the cook from Howell, MI - it WAS missing something...the chipotles which ,frankly, make this dish outstanding. Have served it time and time again to stellar reviews by all of my guests.

This salad was pretty blah, not worth the effort. The leftovers just sat in the fridge until we had to throw them out.

I, too, added red cabbage,used cilantro instead of parsley, and didn't put the cayenne in. My husband would eat chipotles straight out of the can, but I was cooking for a crowd, so I thought I'd better tone down the chile element. Absolutely deluxe, beautiful and a fab summer side dish.

a summer-time staple. If you're sensitive to spicy foods go easy on the chipotle and chili powder. Substituting lime juice makes this even better. In response to other reviews -- the dressing isn't supposed to cover the peppers like a potato salad -- its supposed to add/enhance the flavors of the peppers. Don't worry about it pooling at the bottom of the bowl, reuse it!

I had a bad experience with chipotles in past, so I substituted about 3/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper. It was a nice salad, different, and love the jicama, but I don't think I would make it again. It seemed like it was missing something. Plenty of crunch and dressing, but something missing, and it doesn't feel like its worth figuring out what it was. The dressing was very liquidy, it didn't coat the peppers and pooled at the bottom of the bowl instead. We did eat it though, so it wasn't all bad, and it was a good compliment to the Coriander coated chicken.

I subst. bottled Chipotle hot sauce by Buffalo and it was great - took it to a pot luck and everyone liked it.

Four of us ate this slaw, but only one of us liked it. The dressing totally overwhelms the peppers and, candidly, it just did not taste good.

Delicious! The smokiness of the chipotles makes this dressing for me. I did not add the chili powder. Based on other reviews, I thought that would be overkill. The dressing was great without it. It seems the longer chipotle chilis have to blend with other flavors, the more the intensity is enhanced, so I think less is more. I also added some purple cabbage for extra color. Again, no leftovers!

Loved it, loved it, loved it! Made this last night with the Cornmeal Crusted Chicken. Although I made some adjustments, I will definitely be making this again: substituted lime for lemon; instead of adding a chopped chipotle chile, I added a little less than 1/2 teaspoon of the adobo 'juice'; used 1-1/2 tbsps. of lite mayo and added 3/4 tbsp. of mustard; also halved the honey. Oh and I omitted the parsley because I forgot to pick some up at the grocery store.

Very tasty -- the chipotles have a nice smokey flavour, though they make the slaw VERY spicy. The first batch of dressing was so painfully hot that I made another batch without the chili powder (and it was still very hot, so go easy on the chipotles 'til you see how hot they are). A great dish for an adventurous crowd (it was the hit of one dinner party, where folks loved the jicama texture and chipotle flavour) but not for traditionalists.

Mutli-Color peppers were in the fridg and was looking for a new recipie. I made this for a weekend BBQ ... simple ... ribs/chicken/salads. This was a hit. I mad double the recipie ... It is gone .. and 4 people asked for the recipie. This is simple, tasty, and a great seasonal salad. I didn't change the recipie a bit other than i used one less TBL lemon than called for because I ran out ! If you have good peppers try this - it is different and very tasty. THe Chipolties are hot so be careful .. but i like the bite !

This was great! I made the dressing 2 days in a row substituted lime juice for lemon. The first time I followed the recipe, even without the jicama it was great (my jicama had turned brown ???). If anything, the dressing was a bit spicy and I should have held off adding ALL of the dressing to the peppers. The second time I added another 3 TBSP of lite mayo and 3 TBSP water, then put the dressing on a half head each of shredded purple and green cabbage, thinly sliced red pepper, and cilantro (instead of parsley). Still spicy, but great! Next time I'll add black sesame seeds for contrast.

I first had this at a friend's dinner party and it was love at first taste! Since then, it's become a summer side dish staple that's received rave reviews. Looks nice as well. The jicama gives it that extra something.

This was a pretty easy and very tasty recipe, but it was so spicy I could hardly taste the other flavors in the salad. The concept was refreshing and I will definately make this again, but I will omit the cayenne pepper. I added this to salmon tacos. Top it off with some roasted corn, yum.

Since I was short on peppers and jicama, used corn and carrots in addition to bell pepper. ALso substituted lime for lemon juice. THought both dressing and salad were excellent even with these substitutions.

Delicious!! Made this to bring to a crawfish boil. Needed to serve 10, so took other reviewers tip and added purple cabbage and carrots and doubled the dressing to stretch the recipe. Changed the parsley to cilantro. With the red, yellow, green, purple, orange & white we now call it Fiesta Slaw. Beautiful!

I used this dressing on regular coleslaw and it was delicious.

This recipe has somethings that I will take away from it to use in other recipes of my own creation. I loiked the Jicama alot. Interesting texture and somewhat of a beet/ginger taste. very interesting ingredient. I think that the bell peppers in this recipe could be substituted with other ingredients and this could come off working great.

This dressing is also excellent on cabbage coleslaw. The jicama combined with the spicy dressing is a very nice combination. I would definitely make this again.

This is very easy to prepare, colorful, and flavorful. A wonderful addition to a simple chicken or fish entree and a definite crowd pleaser.

An easy recipe to make and it goes beautifully with "chicken breasts with cornmeal-coriander crust and black bean-mango salsa" (also in 4/99 issue). The dressing has a great taste too it. I will definately make this again.
