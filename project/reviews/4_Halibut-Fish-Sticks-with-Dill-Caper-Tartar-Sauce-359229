I made these for my husband and I. Good but not a WOW and the recipe has so many really good reviews. I used Italian Panko and made the tartar sauce with light sour cream because I was out of mayo. Simple and quick to make, good week night dinner.

I used the sauce for grilled salmon and it was wonderful. However, instead of all mayonnaise, I substituted half sour cream and half mayonnaise. The pickle juice was key to the bright flavor.

Excellent! I used Paula's house seasoning plus some cayenne for the fish then everything else as written. The key was to have the pan really hot And to turn often( I used a cast iron skillet).

This recipe was disappointing. The battered fish was bland and tasteless, and did not get crispy. I don't think I'll make this again as there are too many other great halibut recipes out there, but if I did, I'd use a much less expensive fish than halibut.

This recipe is a declisious way to add zing to an already fun family meal -- the dip alone can liven up lots of fish dishes, not just fish sticks. We're thinking fish nuggets would taste great with it, and using the dip as a spread on a fish fillet sandwich if you've got a family on the go!

This is yummy. It's not the fish sticks so much, it's the excellent tarter sauce. Delicious. So delicious that you may end up eating too much of it and making this a less healthy dinner than planned. Suggestions: I use a grinder to chop the cornichons and throw the capers in for a couple of pulses too. Once we ran out of mayo so I did half mayo and half sour cream plus a dash of lemon--it was even better. Use any white fish--it's the panko that matters. Fresh pollock worked well and is a lot cheaper.

Very yummy. Would give 3 1/2 forks if I could, but happy to round up. Very easy to do. My fishmonger had no halibut so I splurged on striped bass and it was AWESOME. The tartar sauce was creamy and tangy, just needed salt and pepper. Will definitely keep this one in the rotation.

These are SO good!! I used plain breadcrumbs instead of panko, and they were excellent! The tartar sauce is the best ever, will add these to my recipe box for sure.

I had to listen to a lot of cr*p about serving fish sticks for dinner, but they were amazingly good--crispy, not at all greasy, very flaky. My fishmonger was out of halibut and haddock, so I used Chilean sea bass instead. It worked perfectly well and had a nice firm texture. I've already had a request for a repeat from the chief nay-sayer!

Love this! I made a few changes, used homemade gluten-free breadcrumbs, and added a little lemon to the tartar sauce and baked at 375 in convection oven for about 12 minutes. My toddler boys loved it and so did my husband and I. This will become a regular meal in out home.

Tasty! Made this for dinner tonight. I'm a new cook, and a total CHEAPSKATE, so I asked the lady at the store what fish I could substitute for halibut because it was 12.97/lb! Tilapia is what I ended up with. Even though it's not as much of a white fish, it still turned out really good. A few pieces did fall apart in the pan, but no big deal. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly - loved the tartar sauce! I might try baking it next time as others seem to have had luck with that.

Fantastic! I used regular bread crumbs and cut the fish into serving size pieces, not sticks. The tartar sauce is delicious!! Can't wait to make this again.

I made this tonight and it was great! Delicate, flavorful, fast. I would add a little more spice to the panko, but don't add too much because the sauce is oh so good! I added a little lemon for zing, and I used half sweet gerkins and half dill pickles (splitting the juice as well). Fresh herbs is a must. I also chopped the capers. Make double the sauce- we had just enough for the two of us with the four person serving! I used previously frozen orange roughy (which I was skeptical about considering it was frozen), and it was great! Will keep this in the arsenal.

All the fun of fish sticks with so much more taste! And the sauce... OMG! Don't lazy out and forget about the sauce its worth chopping the pickles. I put my fishsticks in the oven and they were crispy and wonderful and not greesy and the cooking was not tedious at all that way.

Not bad...but the cooking process was tedious. I think we'd try this again using the oven. The tartar sauce is AMAZING and I'm sure we'll use that recipe for whenever we need fresh tartar!

Great weekday meal. The only thing I changed was to use some gluten free breadcrumbs but it was still very tasty. The fish fell apart while I was pan searing, but the fish was pretty thin to deal with, so I couldn't get the proper proportion. To quote my son...so you fried up some awesomeness!

Wow these are not the fish sticks of your youth! I made only the fish sticks, not the tartar sauce (plan to make the tartar sauce next time -- yes there will definitely be a next time for the fish sticks). I did add a dash of sweet paprika to the panko. I also oven baked the fish in 400 degree oven instead of frying (drizzle little oilve oil over the coated fish before baking and you'll never know they were baked and not fried). Wonderful crunch! This is definitely a keeper -- good for a family meal and for company.

Soooooo delicious!!! The fish sticks were perfectly crispy and the tartar sauce was excellent. My husband said the homemade sauce with the pickles made such a difference to store-bought tartar sauce. I will definitely make this again and again and again....

Healthier way to prepare fish and yet it still a had a slight crunch - my 3 kids loved it! I used Old Bay Seasoning on the fish prior to dredging in egg and panko and liked the result. I used sweet cornichons to in the tarter sauce since that was all I had. I have to admit I did like the salty, sweet combination. Will definitely make again.

I loved the dill-caper sauce. It was a salty delight. This is a great weeknight dish. I write a blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins, and this is one of the recipes featured on it.

This was an instant family favorite. I never eat tartar sauce and I loved this sauce. Even my three year old liked it!

Delicious! I can't have gluten so I made breadcrumbs using my favorite gluten-free bread and I also substituted grapeseed Vegenaise for the mayo. My husband thought this may have been the best fish he's had in years. I use chia seed powder (couple teaspoons or so) to thicken the tartar sauce when I got a bit too much liquid from the capers in there--didn't notice any taste change and it adds some nutrition to boot! I can't believe how easy this was--will be making this tartar sauce whenever I need some!

This was a great take on a childhood favorite. My grocer didn't have halibut, so I used cod instead. I thought it turned out nice and crispy, though definitely be sure to let it cook well before trying to flip -- otherwise, my panko got all over the place! Also, I got lazy and just bought Zatarain's spicy tartar sauce. We licked our plates clean!

Wonderful and easy! The tartar sauce really makes it too. I made mine without chives, just because I forgot to grab some at the store. Still amazing!

This was a great dish, and very easy. The tartar sauce was definitely a hit. I did notice that I needed more oil than what was called for when browning the fish in the pan. I think the fish could use a little something in regards to seasoning such as a bit of Old Bay since it is so light and mild tasting. Overall, this was a winner.

Really good tartar sauce. I used finely chopped red onion because it was what I had. Served with my ancient recipe for cole slaw with caraway mayonnaise.

Thank goodness this recipe was so delicious, because I burned the broccoli and it could not be eaten, but the fish redeemed me! Light tasting and the sauce is excellent!

This was so good. I used my deep fryer, which gave the coating an awesome texture. I used Beaver Tartar sauce with Dill and capers, which made this dish even easier. Next time I will serve it with Cole Slaw. And I will get some malt vinegar and Kettle potato chips and make fish and chips!!!!

YUM! Tartar sauce really makes the recipe. Instead of cooking in oil on the stovetop, I coated the fish as directed, lined a baking sheet with foil, sprayed the foil with an olive oil spray, placed the fish on the foil and sprayed the top of the fish with olive oil, baked at 400 degrees. The fillet was over an inch thick - I cooked for 16 minutes. The fish was tender and flaky and the panko was crunchy. I had some of the tartar sauce left over and made a tuna pasta salad with it, which was a nice departure from plain mayo.

These were tasty! I also used cod instead of halibut, but they still turned out well. I might have cut my sticks a little too small, but I ended up needed an extra egg and probably an extra 1/2 to 3/4 c of panko. I was worried the breading would be really bland, but the panko adds a nice flavor. The tartar sauce is delicious, but I would definitely let it chill a while to let the flavors blend. Mine improved dramatically after an hour or two in the fridge.

It was good. This was my first time trying to cook fish and I used cod instead of halibut because the grocery store was out. So I don't know if it was for that reason this wasn't the best to me or because it was my first time cooking fish. Though I did enjoy the tartar sauce.

This was quick & easy. The tartar sauce was a hit with the family.

We used swordfish which worked out really well. The tartar sauce is excellent -- I didn't have green onion so I substituted a little finely diced red onion and would definitely do so again. I agree with a previous reviewer who said not to skimp on the herbs.

Rating: 4
The fish is very good. The tartar sauce is excellant and the combination is superb. Do not skimp on the herbs and there is no substitute for cornichons. If you use fish other than halibut try soaking in milk and 1/8t garlic powder. Don't be fooled by the fish stick name. I would serve this to anyone anytime.

This meal turned out perfect. At first, I thought that I was crazy for turning halibut into fish sticks, but I kept the pieces just a bit bigger, more like the fish in fish n' chips. The dippin' sauce is great! And, I'll be using it for other things as well. I did discover that halibut skin is a pain to remove from the cut. Next time, I'll have the butcher do it.

Seasoned with some Old Bay to give a little flavor to this very mild fish. I recommend heat higher than med to brown the panko, will brown faster and not overcook the fish. Halibut was line caught during a fishing trip in Homer, AK Tarter sauce is outstanding! Served with a 2006 Bergstrom De Lancellotti Vineyard Pinot Noir
