Boring, boring, boring. Great color, but takes away the best tastes of both the potatoes and the beets. And I used lots of extra garlic - still didn't help.

This was not only a tastey dish, but beutiful too. Nice color and consistancy. I would recommend it as a good fit for a Christmas meal. I thought it was a litle lite on the garlic. I would add an additional clove or two next time. I like mine garlicy.

This was an excellent way to use up those beets that everyone grows in their garden but gets tired of the same old recipes. A fairly subtly-flavored, but delicious and very colorful side dish! I will definitely make this again. (Be careful when peeling beets -- wash hands right away so your fingers don't turn bright pink).
