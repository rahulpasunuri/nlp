A nice change from rice but it surely needs a good dose of salt and pepper.

I've been looking for extremely simple dishes that are also full of flavor and I've finally found the perfect one. I'm a rosemary fiend and this is wonderful. It's great for an extremely quick side dish or even a light meal.

Super simple but I loved it. The rosemary is so aromatic it really is seductive. I didn't use the chicken broth as suggested but I did salt the water with a slightly heavy hand.

As suggested by other reviewers, I cooked the orzo in chicken broth. I recently served roasted sea bass provencale over a bed of this orzo with haricot verts on the side. My dinner guests were impressed and it was a nice alternative to plain old rice.

I enjoyed this recipe with the Provencal Chicken Breasts. Next time I will use the advice to cook the orzo in chicken broth. I think that will give it the bit of added flavor it needs.

This is my new favorite way to make orzo. Never before have I found a way to cook orzo to make it interesting. This is it.

I made this to accompany the Provencal Chicken Breasts on this website, it was perfect. I, too, boiled the orzo in chicken broth instead of water, it gives a better end result. I thought this was delicious and can see serving it with a number of different dishes.

This recipe is absolutely fabulous! The simple blending of the flavors transforms the orzo in to something spectacular. It's really easy to make and it great served hot or cold. It can be served as a side with many of your favorite dishes at home and is a great dish to take to a pic-nic, bbq, buffet dinner etc. I'd definately recommend it.

I added 1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes soaked in olive oil, chopped, 1/2 cup toasted pine nuts, 1-1/2 tsp. salt, and 1/2 tsp. pepper to the recipe. Excellent with grilled chicken breast. If I was to serve this Rosemary Orzo with the Provencal Chicken recipe, I will just follow the recipe as is because the the Provencal Chicken has enough flavor to complement the Rosemary Orzo.

This was very delicious. My boyfriend couldn't stop eating it! I must say, however, that I did NOT use orzo from a box. I bought a high quality orzo at the organic grocery store which is sold by bulk and I think that made the difference.

I boiled the orzo in chicken broth instead of water; added a lot of flavor and was really good served w/roasted chicken.

This has become a summer staple for us. I've served it warm and I've served it cold; either way it's always a hit. As with all cooking, though, the quality of the ingredients will determine the outcome of the dish. Use the best extra-virgin olive oil you can get your hands on and fresh, ffresh rosemary. Yum!

This recipie sounds good - but the rosemary really doesn't give it enough flavor. It tastes like plain pasta, I think with a couple of additional ingredients this could be a great recipie though.
