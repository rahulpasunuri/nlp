My experience matched Ghanskain and cook from CT. Crust was over cooked and fell apart. Adjusting the initial cook time might help that. Like CT, the amount of sugar was higher than necessary to absorb the juices from the plum. My cook time to cook the plums through as about an hour by which time the already over cooked crust had disintegrated. The basics of the recipe seem very good, but the judging by the reviewers the failure rate is roughly 60%.

The base crumbled like crazy. The whole tasted good but didn't look so. Probably won't do his again.

I made this dessert for Rosh Hashana. The crust was rich and delicate and simply delicious. I didn't sprinkle sugar over the cooked plums because the tart really didn't need it. My teenaged daughter, a tough critic, said it was one of the best crusts she has ever tasted. I will definitely put this recipe in the family favourites file!

This tart was a big hit with my family. I was careful to bake in the upper part of the onion, so did not have any problems with burning. The crust is more like a graham cracker texture, which makes it a slightly less "sophisticated" dessert, but it was delicious. I used fruit spread instead of preserves and amaretto instead of brandy, which added a nice bit of almond flavor.

Followed the directions exactly and found this recipe had several problems. The crust was just shy of burned and I baked a few minutes less than recommeneded. The skin on the plums was tough and the 1/4 sugar at the end was too much. In the future I will stick with the Plum Torte recipe originally printed in The New York Times.

No idea what the previous person did, but I made this for my Rosh Hashanah dinner (along with the Roast Chicken and Apples), and it won RAVE reviews from our friends. The roasted plums taste marvelous--I used a combo of red and black plums, and substituted berry jam and rum for the plum jam and brandy without any problem. The only note I'd have is that you don't need the full 1/4 tsp of sugar at the end--just a light sprinkling over the top is plenty. Great recipe, worth making again!
