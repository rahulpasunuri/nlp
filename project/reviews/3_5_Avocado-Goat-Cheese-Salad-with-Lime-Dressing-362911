My husband and I made this to accompany steak. The textures were wonderful, creamy, crunchy and leafy. The flavor was citrusy and mild. We enjoyed the jicama which we had not tried before. This is likely a better recipe to accompany a complex or very spicy dish as the flavors are subtle. We used a baby spring mix that was very nice for flavor and added some purple color to the salad. Also garnished with paprika for more color.

Delightful salad! I substitued olive oil for the avocado oil as well.

I like the combination of ingredients here, but yes, something is missing. I think next time I will emulsify the lime juice and oil along with salt and pepper in a jar before I toss it with the salad and the jicama. I think this might solve the blandness issue. Also, I think I will try the cojita cheese as well--it might be tangier, saltier and would help overall.

Given that the title of the recipe says "goat cheese" in it, and I used the much more delicious, and in my view, very different in texture, cotija cheese alternative called for, I didn't want to give this a fork rating. But if you make it with the cotija cheese, it gets four forks, easily. I splurged on the avocado oil and am glad I did. It made for a great change from typical olive oil dressings, and I will use it occasionally in future dressings. The one change I'd make is slightly less cheese, assuming you go with cotija.

This is THE BEST salad I have ever made! :) I leave out the jicama & it is perfect!!! Light & tart with wonderful creamy textures from the avocado & goat cheese to complement the lime.

Jicama really offsets the tartness of the goat cheese and lime. I used olive oil instead of the avocado oil, but it really seemed to overpower the salad. Next time I will use the right oil in the dressing.

I made this for a bunch of friends before serving fish tacos as the main course. I didn't have avocado oil and used olive oil instead. I liked how the jicama soaked up the lime juice. I didn't measure anything but I believe extra lime juice does the trick! I would make it again but probably adjust the recipe and play around with different ingredients.

I love all of the ingredients in this salad but something was missing. The texture of the jicima was delightful but it was rather bland. I tried adding a touch of cumin and more salt/pepper but that didn't seem to do the trick. It's a shame because I thought this salad had so much potential.

Snuck in some grated Parmigiano-Reggiano to make up for lack of salt ;-)
