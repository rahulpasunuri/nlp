Been using this sauce recipe for more than 10 years - best I have ever come across. Everyone loves it - I make extra to use for stir fry sauce - amazing!

NO FORKS.....the sauce was TERRIBLE....tasteless -- I can't believe there were such rave reviews. None of us could even eat it after the first bite.

I have been making this recipe for 10 years. It is a huge hit EVERY time I make it. You can never tell how hot your jalapenos are until you cook and taste them, but it does not matter. I have never met someone that didn't love this. The best recipe I have ever gotten from a magazine or web site.

I have never been tempted to review a recipe before. This is amazing.

If I were on death row, this would be my request for my last meal. Amazing.

Made this very quick-like for Super Bowl. We had a diverse bunch of people with varying tastes and food allergies and everyone of them wished I had made more. I suggest you make the recipe as is and then play with it to suit your palette. Will most definitely make again.

A very nice summertime dish. Suggest using sake for the dry white wine.

After reading comments that it was not spicy enough I opted to mince one entire jalapeno but seeded the second (leaving in the "Veins"). They were bigger peppers and the spice-level was great. Not REALLY hot but a nice zip and those who wanted more spice added more dipping sauce on their plates. I also marinated the shrimp and scallops for a while before barbecuing. I was told to keep this recipe in the rotation.

not the best sauce I have ever made. It turned out to be a little too salty.

After reading comments from other reviewers I also added some red pepper flakes and extra jalapeno peppers to my mix. While the grill warmed up I marinated the shrimp and scallops in some of the dipping sauce. I did not have fresh ginger so I substituted a tsp of ground/dried. Also I don't have peanut oil so I used olive oil plus a small amount of sesame oil. Next time I will pair it with a white basmati rice and grilled veggies rather than the wild rice and steamed broccoli I used this evening. Over all, easy and tasty- I'll make it again.

Just okay. I expected it to be better regarding the ratings. It just was not all that.

I only read the latest reviews; I should have read further. It needs more heat and flavor, but it definitely has potential. I'll try it again.

This little dish kicks ass. Like so many nights during the week...my wife comes home with some type of meat, seafood or foul. NOW WHAT? hit the computer and hit on this..after entering "grilled shrimp and scallops". (Isn't this great, damned technology?) Anyway, I followed it nearly to the 1/2 teaspoon (usually cook by feel, taste and experience) and it worked wonderfully. think I'll do what someone else did and "marinate" some of the seafood for a half hour or so. Scewer some veggies and cook them along with it. Use plenty of onions...even scewered some with the shrimp and scallops. try sprinkling some ground corriander on the seafood before you cook it. that's it. enjoy it. by the way....I think "skewered" is the right way to spell it...but ...screw it.

Very good! I used 3 jalepenos and a bit of lemongrass. I also marinated the shrimp for about 10 min. and swirled the scallops through the sauce as well. Baste a few times while grilling and you don't even need the sauce.

Yum! I wanted to lick the bowl when I was finished. I agree with some of the previous reviewers about marinating the shrimp a little before grilling, I didn't and I couldn't taste the glaze. I will be making this again.

I made this using only the scallops and it was very good. Made the California Roll Salad from this site to go along with, excellent combo.

Rating: 3
This was delicious. The only change I made was that I marinated the shrimp and scallops for 45 mintues before grilling. Most of my guests didn't even use the sauce for dipping. This would be great on all types of fish. I will make it again.

This left me confused. This sauce was great, the glazed shrimp okay, but when we dipped the shrimp in the sauce something was just... off. The flavours, when put together post-cooking were discordant. I'll make the sauce again for stirfrying and the like, but I think I'll skip the shrimp.

My son offered to make this if I bought all the ingredients- I came back with serrano peppers which I thought were jalepeno and it was fantastic! The sauce is so good! I had grilled some chicken along with shrimp and scallops and the sauce is what made this a really special meal! I will even try to make it myself and I'll definitly buy serrano peppers again!!

Outstanding! A crisp, healthy meal. I served it with black beans and brown rice.

I made this because other reviews were very positive. There were 5 of us and noone felt it was even close to being a great dish. It was just ok.

WHAT AN EXPERIENCE! We did this with separate skewers of shrimp and ones of chicken. Marinated the chicken in the sauce about 3 hours. The shrimp, about 1/2 hour. Prepared skewers of veggies and glazed with the sauce on the grill. FANTASTIC. DEFINATELY A KEEPER! THE SAUCE IS THE KEY! May even use the sauce as a zesty stir fry sauce. WHAT A HIT!

I seeded the (small) jalopeno and unfortunately there was no heat in the sauce at all. I liked the texture of the shrimp, though (which did NOT need three minutes per side), so I'm going to try it again with seeds next time.

I made this recipe with 2 large jalapenos, seeds included, and it was 3 alarm awesome. I also brushed and grilled a couple zuccini,sweet red and yellow peppers and a sliced vidalia onion to complete the meal.

This is really good like the other reviews. I love spicy food and was temped to add some chili garlic sauce. I'm glad I didn't because the flavors were so wonderful already. Do add all the peppers though without seeding if you like spice. I personally liked the shrimp the best and I used my George Foreman grill which worked great. Only 1-2 minutes in there though to avoid over cooking. Make this recipie, you won't be disappointed. Oh yeah, I think the glaze would be excellent on BBQ chicken breasts for not shellfish eaters, maybe even better.

This recipe is fantastic--loved by all. I Made it another time as an appetizer using only scallops for a party of 30 and people who particularly didn't care for scallops loved it too!

What a wonderful, tasty dish. Made it with only scallops and it was great. Will have to remember this one for the next time I invite friends for dinner.

Amazing! When we first tasted the sauce, we were concerned that it might be a little too spicy hot for some people, but once we tried it with the seafood, it was perfect. Even our friends who don't eat scallops loved it and had multiple servings.

We love this recipe! We've made it for about 4 years with great results everytime. Also love to have it on the rice and vegetable too.

This was great! I skipped the cilantro (husband can't stand it) and it was still good. Next time I will skip making kebobs and grill in them fish basket.

Rating: 4
This is an excellent recipe! Have made this at least 1/2 dozen times and have always received rave reviews. It's great for entertaining, since the sauce can be made hours in advance and there is no other preparation other than peeling the shrimp. The scallops are especially delicious with the sauce.

We had a Jimmy Buffet party a few summers ago - this was the hit of the night! We have made it almost every summer at least once!

Very nice, although I don't think it's the best thing ever. Too much of a Chinese taste for what I wanted.

One of the best things we have ever made, eaten or been in the same room with! Will make again and again and again!
