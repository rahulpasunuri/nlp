Made this tonight after discovering that by sheer luck I had all the necessary ingredients to make exactly one serving. It was easy to prepare, had a lovely elegant look, and was a perfect light ender to a heavy meal. I know the goal here is for simple elegance, but I think the next time I try this I may experiment with clotted cream or creme fraiche for the cream element, as I'm betting doing so will enhance this already excellent dessert's impact. I would, however, recommend sectioning the slices a little, or using a serrated grapefruit spoon, so you can more easily get the dish down to bite size portions.

I agree that this is an elegant combination -- and not one I would have come up with on my own. I love what the candied ginger adds. A family favorite now.

Fabulous dessert! Very light and wonderful combination of flavors. Everyone raved. This is a great dessert after a rich meal and perfect for a summer evening. Can prepare everything ahead of time, just assembling last minute.

Ok Washington but did you try it?? I know it seems simple but it's a combination I wouldn't have put together on my own. The ginger, liquor and Greek yogurt take it to heights you wouldn't expect. I usually make it with out the cookies. I hardly ever repeat recipes but I'll bet I've made this 10 times since it came out and everyone loves it. Not only that but it's a healthy dessert for a week night. And for anyone who would like to try this recipe by all means do try to get Greek yogurt. It is fabulous. If you can't get it then to give a somewhat similar texture just drain your cheese in a colander until it's thick.

Wow. Fruit and cookies for dessert. I never would have thought of that on my own. Leave it to Bon Appetit to be on the forefront of new food combinations!

What an elegant desert. Use a little less sugar & serve with a fine brandy.
