I'm always amused and frustrated by cooks who use a different cut, change the spices, cook in a different manner for a different time, and then complain that it didn't turn out right!!! Grrrrr. Just for once, try following the recipe exactly the first time to experience the dish the way it is designed, and then tamper with it in the future if you want to see changes. I tire of folks saying gee...this turkey recipe didn't work at all...the only thing I changed was that I made it with beef!!!

Absolutely delicious! Wonderful comfort food on a cold night, but not heavy at all (a very rare combination). You can smell the evergreen forests in this one. The marinade alone smelled mouth-watering! I could not find cardamom pods so used 2 tsp. standard ground cardamom for the marinade. I also used pork tenderloin instead of rib-roast. I still cooked the sauce in the oven for an hour and a half to mellow all of the flavors. Could not find red currant jelly so substituted black currant - I have heard that the two taste virtually the same, and I had no complaints with the black currant. When you first start cooking the sauce it may seem too sharp or sweet (as noted by several other reviewers), but with time it will mellow. I served this with roasted turnips, rutabagas, and leeks. The sauce tasted great over everything. Even my brothers, who are notoriously picky about new flavors, loved this. I will make it again and again and again.

Made this for Christmas dinner and, quite frankly, it didn't really do it for me. Despite taking the roast out of the oven in plenty of time, the meat was dry and did not exhibit any flavor from the marinade. The sauce was a little sharp. There are many better recipes for pork loin roast.

I took a lot of liberties with this, and overall it was quite good--the marinade didn't seem to make a huge impact but since I did not use the meat called for, I can't complain. I used a boneless pork tenderloin which cooked quite fast, and the sauce was still delicious. I used some rosemary to replace the elusive juniper berries, and used allspice and cinnamon instead of cardamom (I love it but didn't have it). Hits the spot as a mid-winter meal, very satisfying and "old-world" feeling.

Made this for an annual xmas get- together with 8 friends. The sauce was very flavourful, even my young kids liked it. I used a 6 lb. boneless centre cut pork loin roast and marinaded it for 24 hours, turning over after 12 hours. I doubled the sauce since the roast was so big and it was just enough. I found the sauce too thin after the current jelly was added, so I added a little flour to thicken it, and also served the prunes with the sauce. Cooked the roast to a temp of 145 degrees, basting every 15 minutes...it was tender and juicy! HOWEVER...we were all more than a little surprised when the sauce IGNITED ON FIRE six times, the first 3 times with enough force to blow open the oven door!!! I guess it was the brandy, but I would appreciate any advice on how to keep this from happening again!

I write to let would-be "recipe changers" like myself, that this recipe did not work well on a pork roast. I am sure it is fabulous for the cut of meat for which it is intended, but I tried it with a roast, and it was a lot of work for very little pizzazz with a regular (ok.. cheap) pork loin. I just wanted to warn others-- make this one as intended, and enjoy!

Used a boneless pork roast and followed the recipe EXACTLY. However, I baked the roast in a ROMERTOF clay pot and it was absolutely SUMPTUOUS. My family just RAVED, the exciting flavors were orgasmic.....

I used two boneless pork loins instead of the bone-in roast. Very good, but the cooking time will be much less. Also, don't expect leftovers.

This dish was the centerpiece for the best Christmas dinner we've ever had! Even the fussy eaters were amazed and delighted!

I couldn't find Juniper berries where I live, so I didn't use them in the recipe. I followed all of the instructions besides that and it turned out WONDERFUL. I cooked it until it was 160 degrees, and for the last 15 minutes had to add a little more water to the pan to keep the sauces from burning. It was extremely flavorful, juicy (not the least bit dry) and pleased the whole family. My mom wants this recipe so that she can make it for another get-together.

This is definitely a winner. I agree with cook from Boston, as I, too remove pork from oven when registers 139-140 degrees. It continues cooking while resting for about 15 minutes, leaving the roast deliciously juicy and so much easier to carve.

Very Delicious recipe. After reading several articles and experimenting myself, I ALWAYS remove pork when its at 139 degrees. It rests out to a nice, mildly rosy pink 145 degrees after carry-over cooking. oh yeah, I always brine my pork roasts, too. 4quarts of water per 1 cup Kosher salt, 3-5 hours for a 6-rib roast works wonders.

I made this for an autumn dinner, and to be honest, wasn't that thrilled. The marinade didn't seem to permiate much into the meat, and unfortunately it came out a bit dry even though I took it out at 155. The sauce was a saving grace, it added moisture and it's delicious. Patti

Very easy, I used a 6 pound boneless pork loin for a dinner for 10. I am planning on making this for Easter Dinner for 20.

I made this last summer for a friend. He's a meat and potatoes kind of guy but absolutely loved this roast with its exotic spices. He mentioned it recently to his wife so I made it again for them both at our cottage. We roasted the pork in a cast iron skillet on the gas grill at the cottage since I have a fairly small oven there and it turned out beautifully. I have changed nothing in the recipe and would not double the marinade as I believe there is quite enough already. I agree with the cook who removes it at 155 degrees. Next time I will use Black Mission figs for a nice change. This is an excellent holiday dish. I pair it up with roasted potatoes (and this time added root vegetables)tossed in olive oil and fresh herbs and finished off with a touch of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Great combination.

We made this recipe for Christmas dinner--for a bunch of very fussy eaters who are not open to new flavours. It was a huge hit. The sauce is delicate and delicious. I personally cook the meat to 155 degrees, because once the meat is tented, it still continues to cook. We followed another reviewer's suggestion about doubling the marinade and sauce and it worked very well. Also, we seared it for about 7 minutes, this added a wonderful brown crust which locked in the juices perfectly. Simply wonderful flavours.

Fantastic recipe. One of the best pork recipes I've ever tried. Made it for a dinner party and received rave reviews all around. I doubled the marinade and marinated it in the refrigerator for 48 hours.

When my husband and I were newleyweds, I wanted our first Christmas together to be special. Because his family is Danish, I decided to try my hand at Danish cooking. This recipe was so wonderful that he gave it to his Danish mother and asked her to make it! Because I don't consume alcohol, I substituted red grape juice and it turned out great! I also served the stuffed cabbage rolls and the apple/radish salad that was recommended by Bon Appetit. We have been married for 5 years now and have had it every Christmas.

A big hit for Christmas. I accidentally tripled the amount of coriander powder in the sauce portion of the recipe and it was fine. I would increase the liquid volume of the marinade with fruit juice and/or water. If one boils the sauce too much after adding the jelly, it thins out again; just thicken with cornstarch. Don't downplay the prunes in presenting the dish, they are a flavor highpoint.

While this recipe came out pretty good, beware of how the recipe is written. Processes are out of order and are mislabeled, making the recipe confusing the first time. Also, while I enjoy strong flavors, the sauce is too strong and sharp. I added sugar to taste along with jelly to round out the sauce. The prunes cooked in the juices with the roast come out fabulous.

I made this for Christmas dinner--it was wonderful, and a hit with the guests. I was a little suspicious about using prunes, but the loin had a great flavor.

I used figs instead of prunes. Wow! It was great. Keep up the good work.
