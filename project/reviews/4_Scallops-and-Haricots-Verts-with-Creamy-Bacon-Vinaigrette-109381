Awesome recipe and best of all...not difficult! I followed advice, and used 1/4 cup vinegar and white wine 1/2 cup. Also cooked haricot verbs at the end of the meal. Going to add garlic next time. Very very good. Placed on top of angel hair pasta to soak the sauce.

The flavors come together so well in this. I did modify just like every other person who reviewed this. This is definitely a "plate licker"! So taking into account most reviewers suggestions, here's what I did: Fry bacon . . . and I like the idea of doing so in 2 pans - one pan for the scallops afterwards and the other for reducing the sauce prior to adding the cream. I suggest cooking the beans right towards the end - they only take 5 min so boil em' and then chill em' (to blanch), then serve. I, too, used only a spalsh of the vinegar (or dry vermouth would be great too). Then the rest is wine and reduce - this may take a while, esp at elevation. I served with brown rice. I heated the skillet pretty high when I added the "towel dried" scallops. 2 min a side. While they were simmering, I added the reduced sauce so the scallops and sauce could integrate. Then as I was pulling out the scallops, added the cream. This only took a few mins to simmer - then serve immediately! So lovely.

This is one of the best scallop recipes I have made. We were having company and this recipe is great to prepare in advance, so when they arrived all I had to do was sear the scallops and make the sauce (used vinegar/wht wine as suggested). Bacon fat is magic and added even more richness to the buttery scallops. I subbed blanched pencil-thin asparagus for the beans and served whipped potatoes underneath.

Delicious with great flavor, quick and easy too! I reduced the vinegar and substituted white wine for some of the water as recommended by others. Served over some leftover pasta (only because I didn't have enough green beans) and left off the dill. Everything's better with bacon:)

As written, there is TOO MUCH vinegar. I'll make it again with 1/4 c vinegar. Cooked the scallops in olive oil. Served with orzo and toasted almonds. It is a lovely presentation.

I needed an elegant meal for a 50th birthday celebration, and this one fit the bill! I experimented with the sauce ahead of time and found I liked it better with only 1/4C vinegar and 1/2C white wine as suggested in previous reviews. I wanted as much preparation as possible done ahead of time, so I cooked my bacon that morning, dumped all but about 1T of the grease out then made the sauce in the same skillet. Stuck both in the fridge. When my guests arrived, all I had to do was cook the beans which I put into my serving bowl and held in a 175 degree, warmed up my sauce and browned the scallops, put them on top of the beans, poured on the sauce, crushed my bacon on top and sprinkled on the dill. Absolutely beautiful and my guests raved all night! For dessert I served Tyler Florence's Caramelized Pears with Rum Raisin Mascarpone. Really elegant meal!

Very fresh (using local ingredients including our own green beans), tasty, quick and easy. Will definitely make again.

This was the perfect New Year's Eve dinner for a crowd! Served with orzo flavored with toasted pine nuts (thanks "taxslave from Birmingham AL")and a fresh baguette. I followed other reviewers and used 1/2 c white wine and 1/4 c white wine vinegar (thanks "wbtwilley from Tallahassee FL").

WOW! Frequently on Fridays I prepare a romantic dinner to have with my wife. Being from New England we love scallops, and I've tried a number of the scallop recipes on Epicurious. This has GOT to be the best scallop recipe I've ever cooked, and could well be the best scallop dish I've ever eaten. Taking the cue from other reviewers I cut back on the vinegar; I used a one third to two thirds ratio of vinegar to white wine. My wife noticed the vinegar and said it was perfect; she wouldn't want it to have more. For two I used 3/4 lb scallops, 6 oz haricots vert, and prepared half the sauce. We had an appetizer first so I prepared the sauce through reduction and let it sit, covered; added the cream, heated it, and seasoned it just before serving. Perfect!

Great dish - Even my 2 and 4 year olds ate it all up. I didn't have white wine so I used red pomegranate vinegar and it gave the sauce a sweet flavor. The sauce was thin (even with reduced amounts) but it was great over orzo. Fast and delicious!

Fantastic recipe - everyone raved. It went well with wild rice with fresh herbs as suggested. We did cut back on the vinegar - substituting half white wine as others suggested. Next time I would also cut back on the water - we thought the sauce was a bit diluted. However, this was really, really good and we will definitely make it again.

Yummy and easy! Agree with others about reducing the vinegar to 1/2 or 1/4c. I did 1/2 and it was still a little vinegary for my taste, but otherwise a great dish!

YUM! Love this! Even my husband, who is often critical of my cooking (in a positive way) thought this was superb. I halved the recipe but should have kept 100% of the sauce. We ate practically a whole baguette soaking it up.

Delicious! I use regular white wine instead of white wine vinegar, and thick-sliced pancetta when I can get it. The first time I made this, I wound up eating the sauce out of the pan with a spoon while I was cleaning up, it was that good. Gluttonous, but good.

This is one of my favorite scallop recipes, and the vinaigrette goes excellent with many things, I make it every time I cook bacon! Substitute a bottle of clam juice and boil until reduced. Season to taste and serve over jasmine rice, polenta, or even a spinach/arugula salad.

I have used this recipe numerous times. I generally add slightly more cream to the vinaigrette, to taste. I have also made the beans with the vinaigrette as an excellent side dish without the scallops. When I make it with the scallops, I usually serve it with orzo flavored with toasted pine nuts. The orzo soaks up the delicious sauce and the toasted pine nuts make an excellent counterpoint to the bacon in the sauce.

This was so simple, and beautiful on the plate. I used 1/2 c. white wine and 1/4 c. white wine vinegar, and it was perfect. I had to make pasta afterwards, just to soak up the extra sauce.

Finally I found a terrific scallop recipe! I made this last week for my husband and am making it again tonight for my parents. Even my unadventurous 7 yr old ate it up. East & delicious. Just remember to pat the scallops dry before sauteing so they sear golden brown which makes them extra sweet.

I h ave made this several times now with minimal changes, just adjusting to whatever I have on hand, but I always make sure I have a little cream to use. This is one of my favorite scallop recipes and it makes a very elegant impression for guests. Have served with cous cous, wild rice or just brown rice, anything to soak up the lovely sauce!

Wow wow wow! I happened upon this recipe looking for something different to make for Mother's Day and I'm so glad I did. Thank you to all for suggesting the wine alternative. I followed that advice (only 1/4c wh. wine vinegar) and it worked out perfectly. I chopped the dill up and then forgot to put it on top of the dish but it didn't wind up mattering at all; everyone loved it! Including me.

This recipe is not just easy but extremely tasty. I substituted white wine for all but 1/4 cup of the white wine vinegar and it worked very well...that was a great tip and I thank the other reviewers for posting it.

This was excellent. I too substituted white wine for all but 1/4 cup of the white wine vinegar and think that leaves just the right amount of vinegar taste to the sauce. I am already looking foward to making this again!

This is a really good scallop recipe! Use white balsamic vinegar for a milder vinegar flavor. I make this dish using half the amount of scallops, bacon and haricots verts - serve over whole wheat spaghetti. It's perfect for two.

I also cut back the vinegar to 1/4 cup and 1/2 cup wine. Served it with sliced tomatoes on the side and green rice. Very good dinner.

I have made this twice myself after being served it at a friend's house, and dreamt about it. I agree regarding the vinegar/wine although I would do 1/4 white wine, and 1/2 white wine vinegar. Also, the second time I added the bacon and dill as garnish, because I did not like that the bacon softened when it was mixed with hot beans and dressing. I like it crunchy. Also, for a different presentation, I would plate beans, scallops on top, dress the entire plate, and garnish with bacon and the dill! Wonderful middle of the week dinner!

I too reduced the vinegar by substituting white wine for 1/4 of the 3/4 cup of vinegar. It's on our menu and is well received. The prez is very good. I heat the pan quite hot until a drop of water dances and sizzles and then add the king scallops. 2 minutes a side is about right for kings. Queens are about a minute a side. Cheers!

This is a wonderful recipe. I have tried so many variations...and each was wonderful. I have now begun to use a sweet honey mustard instead of the dijon...what a sensational difference! (for those with a sweet tooth). I have also used chicken instead of scallops (i was in the mood for something different). Also very yummy.

So simple, yet so yummy. I used milk instead of the water+ cream (as I didnt have cream on hand) and it was great. Would add much less vinegar next time (maybe half the amt?). Fresh dill adds beautiful flavor at the end. Enjoy!

Tonight, I just needed a little inspiration: what to do with my scallops for a light supper for two. and this inspired me. Scalllops, bacon, dijon and white wine. Well, that's what I wanted to see. So... Cooked bacon in roomy skillet; removed bacon; sauteed scallops in skillet with bacon fond. Kept warm in oven while deglazed skillet with vermouth, dash of white wine vinaigre and after reduced, added copious amount of WHOLE GRAIN DIJON (so beautiful and floral) and then some (not lots) heavy cream. Served along-side a head of cold, crispy head of romaine cut up and tossed with o-oil and dash of same white wine vinaigre, pepper. I had, by happy miracle, some roasted whole beets; quartered; and THAT took the meal to MEMORABLE. Love that "didn't- plan-it" thing.

Very quick and tasty. I cut down on the vinegar and thickened the sauce slightly with a white wine roux.

I made this dish for my husband and I, and we both loved it. Next time I will substitute a little wine for the vinegar though, as I just found the vinegar too overpowering. My husband liked the sauce so much though, that he soaked up the remaining with bread! I'll make this one again.

I enjoyed this recipe but listened to the other reviewers when they commented on the amount of vinegar. I used 1/4 cup white wine vinegar and 1/2 cup white wine. It was perfect! I served this on top of a brown rice/wild rice mixture that I made with a bit of chicken broth and garlic in the boiling water.

After reading earlier reviews I was worried about the scallops getting cold, so I might a slight change. I browned the bacon in two pans, so I could reduce the sauce in a pan other than the one used for the scallops. After cooking the scallops, I quickly deglazed the pan with a splash of white wine. Then, I put the reduced sauce in the scallops pan and added the cream. Turned out wonderful. Excellent dish. We didn't find it was too sour at all. Perhaps earlier cooks didn't reduce long enough. Already plan to make this dish for guests.

I thought this was excellent. Used cider vinegar becasue we are unable to find white wine vinegar here, but it was not to strong at all. It did get cold fast so next time I might take another reviewers advise to keep thing warm in the oven while we put the finishing touches on it.

Rating: 3
Good and quick to make. I made a half-recipe, and thought I had screwed up on the vinegar, because the sauce on its own tasted so tart. So I added a little extra cream. But, when mixed with the scallops/bacon/beans, it was not overpowering. Very pretty on the plate. I served with couscous, which complemented the dish nicely.

Rating: 3
Recipe was good but you have to be careful with the timing or everything ends up getting cold while the sauce is reducing. Would suggest keeping bacon and scallops warm in the oven while simulateously reducing sauce and cooking beans. Other than than that, was very tasty, had to add more cream to cut down acidity from vinegar. Would suggest replacing some of the vinegar with white wine.

We thought this was really good. I made half the recipe (for two), with 3/4 lb scallops and about 8 ounces of green beans. I also agree the Costco haricot verts would work, but I had green beans in the fridge and just picked out the smallest ones. I think the quality or perhaps age of the wine vinegar may have been at fault for those who found it vinegary. I used a supermarket brand "Maitre Jacques" and had no problem. Served this with WILD RICE WITH WILD MUSHROOMS from this site and while the rice was excellent, I think it was a little heavy for the scallops. This was a deliciously different recipe for scallops.

FANTASTIC - I will make this again and again. The amount of vinegar called for sounded like way too much, so I only used half. There was quite a bit of liquid left in the pan after the scallops were cooked, so I added a little dry white wine to that and omitted the water entirely. And I didn't have any fresh dill, so I substituted fresh tarragon. The frozen haricots verts from Trader Joe's (the real thing - they are imported from France)worked just fine in this dish.

The sauce is WAY to vinegary. It ran everybody out of the kitchen. Couldn't even save it. I'll try it again with MUCH less vinegar and maybe broth instead of water. Looks pretty however.

This is the first time I have found a recipe which rated the coveted four-stars, but this is it. I had relatively low expectations, but the contribution of different textures and tastes was outstanding. Plus it takes a minimum of time and the ingredients were on hand. I blotted my scallops with paper towels before cooking.
