So-o-o-o-o good! And so quick and easy, too! I used the baby bok choy that my CSA sent, and some reconstituted dried shiitakes. As others suggested, I didn't use as much stock. I doubled the recipe, but only increased the stock by half. I added small amounts of the fish sauce, soy sauce, sesame oil, and chili oil, and then kept adding more of each, tweaking until the flavor was just right. I added chunks of Trader Joe's "Just Chicken" to make it a satisfying meal. As others have said, tofu and soba noodles would be great additions, too.

I added 1 split chicken breast to this that I had browned with some garlic to this. I also added celery and carrots and sauteed with the chicken in sesame oil to soften. Then I used 1 carton chicken stock and 3 cups water. Put in some corriander and some chinese 5 spice for a flavorful "add."

Great quick meal! Was looking for a recipe for my abundance of shitakes and bok choy (trip to the asian market!)....used way less broth and added garlic with the ginger and tofu toward the end. Hearty and delish!

A very tasty soup base! I agree with the previous reviewers to add less fish sauce (I used 1 Tbsp). I pressed 2 cloves garlic and added with the ginger. I didn't use mushrooms because I didn't have any. Added soba noodles and increased the broth to 12c (without increasing the other ingredients and the saltiness and flavor was just right).

I went off the beaten path with this one (couldn't bring my computer to the kitchen, so I winged it)! I sauteed everything in a little bit of oil, added more garlic, some chopped leeks, and then, get this, used boxed butternut squash soup instead of chicken broth - It was so delicious! I didn't have fish sauce or chili oil, so I used chili powder and added some curry powder I had. I would definitely make this again - and maybe someday do it the 'right' way...

Love this recipe!! So I like my soups to cook longer than 10 mins. So, I boiled a chicken with the chicken broth, mushrooms and ginger. I added garlic and favorite chicken spice. While de-boning the chicken I continued with recipe. Did use low- sodium soy sauce. Yummy!! A nice alternative to chicken soup when you have a cold!

Just made this for dinner tonight. It took no time at all, subbed crimini mushrooms, and siracha for the chili oil. Also added carrots and raw chicken and let it cook in the broth. Easy and delicious.

My husband was not so crazy about this soup - he is not fond of fish sauce and prefers everything to have meat in it. But eveny once in a while you just have to make something you want to try. I liked it although I think the combinations of CHile Oil and vinegar was a bit sinus clearing. I would slightly reduce the amounts of these two ingredients the next time.

I love this recipe. It makes for a great base to play around with. I usually use a combination of mushroom and chicken or beef broth. I like to make a large pot of it and then add different things throughout the week like tofu, pork, shrimp, soba noodles, etc. depending on my hunger level.

My fiancee is from China and I have cooked and tasted a lot of tradtional Chinese dishes before and this is one of them. I too only put in one tablespoon of the fish sauce mostly because of the high sodium. Did not have bok choy so I used napa cabbage and I added shrimp, also I served it over white rice.

The flavor is a bit strong. Liked the abundant vegetables.

This soup is quick and delicious-- guests rave when I serve it and it's and wonderfully soothing when you're suffering from a winter cold. To make it heartier, I sometimes add rice noodle vermicelli. Sometimes I add a little chili paste too, to give it some heat. Highly recommended.

Made it several times, excellent, no need to change a thing,it's quick, can add spinach for more greens, BUT, WHERE is the CHICKEN??? Well, if you are an experienced cook, you know when to add it. Use left over chicken, boil some breasts prior, do your own thing...be creative.

We really enjoyed this soup. I added garlic and tofu, along with chicken thighs, and I also used dried shitakes because hubby likes the texture of them. After soaking them, I added the strained mushroom water to the soup to up the mushroom flavor. Also added more chili oil and fish sauce because it needed a little more zip. Definitely a keeper in my house.

Nice soup with simple clean asian flavors. I added chicken breasts thinly sliced to make it more of a meal. Would definitely consider adding tofu when/if I make it again.

I tried this recipe using other suggestions such as tofu and garlic. The great thing about this recipe was that it was really quick to make but I thought the soup turned out so-so.

Delicious and simple. Will DEFINITLY make this again and again. Didn't have fresh ginger so used Chinese Five-spice instead - still fabulous. Did not have reduced salt chicken stock so left out the soy sauce. Added two teaspoons of sugar for more of a sweet/sour taste. YUMMO!

WOW. This soup is fantastic, and super easy to make. I added cubed tofu as well, and used a dash of sambal olek instead of chili oil. I will definitely make it again. Awesome!

A lovely, full-flavored spring soup. It's also super low cal so I can eat a ton of it without the guilt. I serve it with a few sprigs of cilantro leaves on top (cleans the palete) and enhances the spring taste. Keeps rather well, too.

I cut the fish sauce a bit and added garlic. Thought it was very nice and a great soup base.

Very yummy, but yes, very salty. Nam Pla is basically liquid salt, so I don't know why everyone is so shocked. Read the nutritional label on the bottle!!! Make your own stock and add very little salt to it if you require less.

I agree with several of the other reviewers - a great oriental soup base. The flavors blend wonderfully. I added tofu, noodles and some bean sprouts and it was a hearty dinner soup.

This recipe produced an AWESOME basic asian soup base, and it was surprisingly simple and quick to make. It is as good or better than any good soup I've had in resaurants. As other reviewers have done, I added fresh udon noodles and some very thin chicken slices to the broth to make it heartier. It is on the saltier side, but I wouln't change a thing personally. If you're picky and tend to like less salty food in general, then use low sodium chicken broth and low sodium soy sauce, but don't omit any of the fish sauce. I will definitely keep this recipe and use it as a starting point for a asian soups in the future, modifying by the addition or substitution of bamboo shoots, various noodles, different mushrooms, more chili oil, water chestnuts, lemongrass, etc.

This soup is absolutely delicious! I added a package of fresh udon noodles which made it a meal in itself and a little extra rice vinegar for more of a kick.

This was great for a cool fall evening. I didn't have any mushrooms, but added cooked chicken ("short cuts" by perdue), and rice noodles. Also didn't have the fish sauce, but didn't seem to miss it. And I think I would try udon noodles next time. Highly recommended!

I've made this soup several times and it's always a big hit. I've added rice noodles and water chestnuts to make it a little more hearty, and that worked well too. I like both ways equally as well. Definately make sure the chicken broth is low salt, because as other reviewers say, this soup is already pretty salty. I wouldn't skimp too much on the fish sauce though; it's the ingredient that makes the soup taste special, I think.

Tasted as good or better than any soup I have had in Chinese restaurants. I substituted portobello mushrooms for the shiitake mushrooms and eliminated the fish sauce because I didn't have it. Since fish sauce can be very salty, it was just as well since I didn't miss it.

In order to make this soup more nutritious for my dining companion (who was catching a cold), I first browned 2 chicken thighs, simmered them in the chicken broth until done, and then skinned and diced them. I took heed of other reviewers' comments and added rice noodles, and substituted dried shitakes for the fresh mushrooms, adding half a cup of the soaking liquid to the broth. Do take care when adding the fish and soy sauces as the soup can easily become overly salty. After carefully slicing the green onions, I forgot to add them at the end! Nevertheless, this was a very tasty and soul-satisfying soup. Cooking for two people, I made just half the recipe. I didn't use all of the chicken, as the cat was pestering me for most of it!

This soup is FABULOUS. I would have never guessed how great it could be just by reading the recipe. Everyone should make it. I made a couple substitutions that I think enhanced the taste. I added one can of sliced water chestnuts and a 3-1/4 oz. tin of Kippers (I chopped them up) at the very beginning of the recipe. By the time the soup is finished, the water chestnuts are still crisp and the kippers have dissolved and added a mild fish taste to the soup. I think the Fish Sauce the recipe calls for is WAY too overpowering on this soup. Give the kippers a try...they are very healthy and you don't notice them at all in the soup. I added 4 cups of Bok Choy because I wanted to make this soup a little thicker. This recipe serves three large main course meals.

My husband and I both really enjoyed this soup. I took a suggestion from another reviewer, and only added 1tbsp of the fish sauce, it had a nice flavor, and wasn't overly fishy. I also added button mushrooms and sprouts. Definitely try this recipe, I will make it again. I served it with crispy flatbread, and for two people, the recipe made enough to be served as a meal.

This was a simple and tasty soup. I used dried shitakes and put 1 cup of the soaked mushroom liquid to substitute for one cup chicken broth. I also added some button mushrooms with the bok choy and some pea sprouts. My husband loved it.

I also added rice noodles to this soup and used baby bok choy, and thought it was delicious! My husband, however, had a pretty strong aversion to the fish flavor in the soup. (My fish sauce was bought at the oriental market (couldn't find it ANYWHERE else!) and pretty strong...!) I would make it again, but have reservations to serve it for those who have less-adventurous tastes.

The flavors are wonderful. And it takes so little time to make. But if you don't like your soups too salty, start with a third of the fish and soy sauces and add more to taste. I ultimately used only 2/3 of the recommended amounts of each, and the soup was great.

This was a great recipe! It was really easy and very tasty. I added extra mushrooms (the other kind typically found in chinese food - forgot the name), more bok choy and some chinese noodles, and it was a real meal! Red pepper flakes didn't hurt either.

Loved it! I added rice noodles as well. Don't leave out the fish sauce -- it really makes the recipe. Even if you dislike seafood -- it definately does not taste fishy.
