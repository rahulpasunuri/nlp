I have been making these crab cakes for at least 5 years now. I make them for every holiday and special occasion. Every time I go out to a restaurant I'm disappointed because nothing compares to these. They are always the first appetizer (I make appetizer size as opposed to entree sized cakes) to disappear and I've been asked for the recipe many times. Let the the chili mayo sit for at least a few hours before serving. You can't go wrong with this recipe!!

This was fantastic! I use shallots instead of red onion, veganaise mayo(for low fat alternative),& panko breadcrumbs as substitiutions & it came out amazing. I also added some chili powder & habanero pepper flakes to the mayo mix, & used a little extra jalapeno to the veggie mix. I added a little bit of sea salt to the crab cake mixture as well. I would definitely make this for a dinner party & was very pleased w/ the taste & uniqueness of the crab cake. I broiled some in my toaster oven, but wasn't as pleased w/ them as they tasted better w/ the crispy texture from pan frying, but they were still good!

I've made these many times since seeing the recipe and we absolutely LOVE them. I often chop up some shrimp and add that to the mixture. You must not skip the step of putting them in the refrigerator though or they will fall apart when frying.

Absolutely delicious! You can't go wrong with this recipe; easy & fast. Cakes were easy to cook and did not fall apart in the pan. Make sure you chill them before cooking.

This recipe was very disappointing. All the creamy binders and the addition of the chili mayonnaise greatly overpowered the flavor of the crab I used, and the patties did not fry up as nicely as I would have liked--they remained soggy and fell apart easily (and I have made many crab cakes before, being from the Pacific Northwest, that have fried up beautifully). Perhaps this recipe would be good with something like imitation crab, as a way of hiding the poor flavor/texture, but with delicious dungeness crab it is a total waste.

These were great tasting with a really nice consistency: crunchy on the outside but nice and soft and chock full of crab on the inside! They were a hit at our dinner party and beloved by our guests (some who claim to be crab cake aficionados)

This recipe was flavorful and delicious and did not detract from the delicate flavor of the crab. I found I needed more oil in the pan than what was called for to do more than one batch. I would highly recommend this recipe.

I love these crab cakes!!! They have a slight crispiness, nice spice, and a good crab flavor. The red chili mayo is equally good.

I have tried numerous crab cake recipes on Epicurious but this is our hands down favorite. I am making 60 of them tomorrow for our annual whitewater rafting weekend. I add Sriracha to the chili mayo to give it more kick and I add less mayo to the crabcake mix than is called for (I use about 1/3 instead of 1/2) Other than that I follow the recipe as written and them come out fabulous! My boyfriend is a chef is this is one of the few dishes he trusts me to make without his input.

Rave reviews from the bf and roommate. I shelled fresh crab for this one, as with any recipe I think the extremely fresh ingredients made this a hit. The chili mayo was very simple to make and very tasty. I'll be making this mayo to use on other things.

Husband loves Maryland crab cakes but living in west coast he can only indulge once a year when he makes his annual trip. These are not Maryland crab cakes but we loved them and can call them California crab cakes! I used panko crumbs and left out red bell peppers because I didn't have any but turned out fine. The sauce is perfect!

This is a good basic crab cake recipe. I would dredge in panko rather than fresh bread crumbs --makes for a crisper cake. And I would use a bit more oil to fry than 2 T, and would go with an oil with more neutral flavor than olive oil. But this recipe works well too.

Made this for Christmas Eve, never having attempted crab cakes previously. Used Mae-Ploy/sweet chili sauce in the mayonnaise and it was great. Did not use the jalapeno chili but did use Panko bread crumbs. Everyone loved them and will definitely make them again. Also, used a 1 lb. container of lump crab we purchased at Costco, and worked out fine. Knew from watching a neighbor cook crab cakes to not play with them while they are cooking, just let them brown on each side.

Just made these crab cakes tonight. I loved them and so did my boyfriend. I didn't change anything other then I used Panko Breadcrumbs rather then fresh french bread crumbs. Regardless.. they browned well and each bite was delicious, better then most restaurants! I'll be making these crab cakes for a long time.

Okay, my fault. Used cornflake crumbs instead of fresh breadcrumbs or panko. And baked instead of panfried. So I shouldn't have been surprised that the cakes crumbled at the slightest touch. Didn't bother to serve them. Next morning, added eggs and mayonnaise to help bind a little better and got just the right texture. Crabcakes were still a little blander than I expected. Thought they needed a little salt, garlic. But chili-mayo sauce was excellent. Overall not a bad take on the crabcake but not as revolutionary as I thought it was going to be.

Rating: 4
Very good! For my taste, and given the chili-garlic sauce, omitted the fresh jalapeno. Used panko instead of fresh breadcrumbs and added a bit at a time to ensure only enough was used to bind the crab. A less expensive version is to combine crab and hand-peeled shrimp-- works well.

Made with panko breadcrumbs and halved the chili pepper. I baked instead of fried and turned out good. The mayo was the biggest hit, as they were a bit on the dry side.

Out-Freakin-Standing! Best I've ever made and in the top 2 or 3 I've ever tasted. Made 2 changes, didn't have bread for bread crumbs so I used crumbled Ritz crackers and didn't want to wait an hour or more to chill the cakes in the fridge before cooking, so I covered with plastic wrap and popped in the freezer for 15 minutes. Served as a first course before grilled ribeye's.

Two years later and healthier cooking---here's how I appended the original recipe: Forget the sauce--I know it's great, but you can get the same flavor from (believe it or not) REDUCED fat Hellman's (the latest Cooks says that the Hellman's Canola is great, too)mixed in a much smaller amount into the crab cake itself. I also didn't have celery on hand, so used celery seed, which made for a much less watery cake and still imparted good celery flavor. Continue to use the panko, and if really chilled--forget frying--BROIL. (or cook at really high heat if that isn't an option.) Believe it or not, just as good and maybe even more crab flavor without the competing oil. Also, makes this much easier to serve for hors d'oevers or main course for a dinner party. No last minute frying! This is my best crabcake recipe I've ever tried. My husband wholeheartedly agreed!

Rating: 3
Excellent flavor, although I could not get the cakes to stick together. Following the suggestion of another reviewer, I put them in the freezer for about 20 minutes, but they still fell apart when they were cooked. I fried half and broiled half - both crumbled, but were delicious. Not a fan of mayonnaise, I used nonfat yogurt for the sauce - delicious!

This really is an outstanding recipe and a great change from classical Chesapeake Bay crab cake recipes. As the previous writer notes, use panko bread crumbs and definitely the crabmeat from Costco. I've been using Costco crabmeat for years and it is excellent.

This is the best crab cake recipe that I have ever tried, and I've made a few. The flavours blended beautifully. I also used panko crumbs which I think helped keep them crispy. I will try the Costco crabmeat next time, as suggested by other reviewers, as I found fresh lump crabmeat from a fish monger to be quite expensive. The sauce is delicious! Next time I will try baking them to cut down on the oil. Easy to reheat in the oven if you want to make them ahead of time, which is always a blessing.

Rating: 4
Excellent. As suggested by previous reviewers used panko and baked them after chilling. Added extra chilli garlic sauce to the mayo because we LOVE spice. Used 1lb crabmeat from Costo and served with a grapefruit,avo, red onion and romaine salad as suggesed by a cook from NH. This is a winner

Rating: 4
Used 1 lb. can crabmeat from Costco, 1/2 C. panko crumbs, 1 med. jalapeño, plus other ingredients in the crab cakes. Used another 1/2 C. panko crumbs to dredge, pushing extra crumbs into tops of cakes. They will be hard to hold together, so chill for several hours, then put in the freezer for 10-15 minutes before frying. Then make sure the first side is completely brown before turning (maybe lower heat so they don't brown too fast). I like serving them over baby lettuce or romaine hearts (as recommended by impattyb). Both crab cakes and sauce are spicy, so cool and crunch are good. Leftovers can be reheated (I used the toaster-oven) and are delicious. If you make this recipe with 1/2 lb. crabmeat, use one egg but halve the other ingredients. This makes a generous amount for two.

Wonderful! As other reviewers suggested, I used Panko, which gave them a nice crispy texture, and baked them (healthier and EASIER). Definitely make extra sauce!

This is the first time I have tried making crab cakes on my own and I was super pleased with the results. These were delicious with not too much filler. I did have a little trouble with the cakes falling apart when it was time to fry,so I may add a little extra egg next time. Otherwise, no changes at all. They even reheated well in the oven next day.

I LOVE this recipe and have been making these for 2 years now. I wonder if my friends really come over to see me or have my crab cakes for brunch. I don't like sauteed bell peppers so I omit them. I add sun-dried pepper paste or flakes in addition to the chili-garlic sauce. I use plain panko bread crumbs. To stretch the recipe I add add 1:1 ratio of pre-cooked shrimp, chopped, to crab meat. NEVER use fake crab meat. Lump or backfin is better than claw. I don't enjoy fried foods so I bake for about 15-20 mins in 400 degree oven then broil each side for about 2-3 minutes until golden brown. Leftovers (if any) make great sandwiches with whole wheat english muffins.

I made this for a Congressman's Christmas party and they were a huge hit!! I used Panko crumbs, and instead of frying them, I baked them in the oven to make them healthier.

I love this recipe! I recommend Panko as well but works well with plain breadcrumbs or making your own breadcrumbs out of stale bread. The key to keep them from crumbling is the chilling part. Then when you put them in the pan do not touch them until you are sure they are ready to turn over. I use tongs and grab them on the side and gently turn. I made these one day, for my family then we got a last minute invitation to a friend's house for dinner. I took the cakes to contribute. They were a big hit. They all agreed they were the best cakes they had ever had...including restaurants. Make extra chile mayo. It is delicious!

These are my standard crab cakes. They're relatively simple to prepare and very tasty. The only change I make is to substitute Panko Japanese breadcrumbs for regular breadcrumbs. I only put about 1/2 c. Panko in the cakes and then coat them with it as well.

I have mixed feelings about this recipe... it was delicious, but it has so many spices that the crab is completely overpowered. I think it could be made with another main ingredient (shrimp, maybe tofu?, imitation crabmeat) that is not so expensive and you will have a delicious meal. The flavor is incredible, though. Another thing just to note, when I went to purchase the chili garlic sauce at my regular grocer, it was almost $6. I took the opportunity to go to my local Asian-market, and got it for $1.50 and then picked up some other cool things like edamame, frozen potstickers, etc. that you can't find at the local grocer. And, like all the other chefs below, I used Panko. They had a great texture, and I had no trouble keeping the mixture to hold together. It is important to "cake" these ahead of time and refrigerate or freeze them to firm them up before pan-frying. Great recipe and will make again... probably with another main ingredient, though. Crab is too expensive to not be able to taste anymore than you can with all those spices.

My husband described these as a "flavor explosion." I made them much smaller for a cocktail party, about an inch wide and half an inch thick so the frying time was quicker. Delicious and easy!

Rating: 4
Wonderful! My few notes: go with the Panko crumbs--the only way to hold everything together without becoming sodden and heavy. I, too, added more chili sauce (cookbook author, Hugh Carpenter swears by Chinese Sriracha chili sauce.) Instead of refrigerating for an hour or more, I used "Press and Seal" to wrap the cakes and them put them in the freezer for 10-15 minutes to solidify before frying. Trying to get a bit of healthy green into the meal, I placed a mound of already chopped and washed hearts of romaine on the plate, drizzled some of the chili mayonaisse, placed a crab cake on top, then drizzled more of the chili mayo. The interplay of hot crab, cold lettuce and spicy sauce was great. This one was a winner!

Rating: 2
Good, but not great! The flavor was good, but not traditional for crab cakes. The problem was the recipe had to be played with. The cakes were very moist when forming and then fell apart when cooking. A much better recipe on this site is the Crab Cakes with Baby Greens with Lemon Vinaigrette. That one is to die for!

Amazing!!! I love crab cakes and have used several different recipes in the past, but I'll throw them all out now and just keep this one.

Brought these to a get-together last night and they flew off the plate! (wish I had some left over for breakfast!)

Let me join those who sing the praises of this dish! I made it as an appetizer for a special dinner and it received compliments from everyone - even the most discriminating.

I'm giving this four forks for pure flavour. I live in the czech republic, and prefer a panko crumb, as per suggestions below, and pre-ordered in advance before Christmas. However these did not arrive in time. I ended up with many guests and without any crumbing (bread or otherwise - although i did put a cup full of greated french loaf into mix). In the end i made this without crumbs, and grilled in the oven. These were superb. Guests took home the recipe. Obviously never told them they were meant to be crumbed.. can't wait for the panko to arrive...

Made this recipe for a second time with modifcations of using Panko and omitting celery. Make sure to use the chili garlic sauce and not just chili sauce commonly used for shrimp. I used a plastic form that created more of a tower-had seen this in a restuarant presentation and was very pretty. so end result was approx. 2 inches tall. Made the night before with lump crab(a must) and ziplock. then made the "towers" and rolled in panko, seared all sides in olive oil, then baked. served on small plates with garnish and chili sauce(the best) all of my guests for lunch said it was the best they have ever had. Be prepared to recieve great reviews!

I have made this several times and love it. I have also shared it with friends who live in the New Mexico desert, so don't get a lot of sea food, but can get the canned crab that Costco sells. In a taste-test, I made a batch of theae and fried half as directed, andbaked half at 475 for 15 minutes. It was a toss up; everybody loved both! Once I had a leftovers, so I broke them apart, formed bite size cakes, and dredged them again in the panko, froze them overnight, and then baked them to use as appetizers. This "twice-baked" version also got raves when served with the spicy mayo as a dipping sauce. Good stuff!

These are excellent. My wife said, finally a crab cake that I have always wanted. She has been disapointed when she has ordered them when we eat out. Made them according to the recipe except, I used panko bread crumbs and reduced the spices slightly. The panko crumbs make for a light crab cake. Thanks to the other reviewers for the suggestions. I had a slight problem with crumbling, but nothing that I couldn't deal with. Will make again.

Awesome! To help with the binding, I refrigerate my cakes for about an hour, before coating them with the panko bread crumbs. Next time I make them, I will drain the crab meat first and carefully watch the amount of liquids added. They might bind better that way. These cakes are fussy (and expensive), but well worth the effort. They can be made a day ahead of time as long as the crab still smells fresh. The leftovers were great for my lunch the next day. You may need to make extra chili mayonnaise

THIS WAS TERRIFIC! Only thing I can add to other reviews is perhaps a solution to the problem some had in keeping the crab cake together when sauteeing.

I used all 5 cups of bread crumbs and had held together. I also added a little more oil to cook them. Tasted great the next day, warmed in the oven. Enjoy

Excellent and EASY. I prepared as written except omitted the celery and used a quality canned crab. Nevertheless, the results were outstanding. You don't need 5 cups of bread crumbs!

Excellent....this is my first crab cake recipe...the only thing was, my cakes when molding keep falling apart, so it was hard to dip them in the breadcrumds, but they still turned out wonderful.

These are the best crab cakes I have ever made! Both the chili garlic paste and the jalapeno pepper add extraordinary zip, and in combination with the colorful veggies, kept them from being ho-hum. I used soft bread crumbs in the cakes and panko bread crumbs to dredge the crab cakes, so the coating remained crunchy. Thank you, Epicurious, and thanks to all the reviewers for the great tips for adding yet another "fave" from this site to my recipe collection!

Delicious!!! I agree with previous reviewer who said you don't need 5 cups of breadcrumbs - I used 1 1/2 in the cakes and about 1 1/2 to dredge. I also used an egg ring which made my crab cakes the perfect size and shape! Have also used canned crabmeat when I was in a hurry and it also turned out beautifully.

These crab cakes were very good - liked the zip added by the chili-garlic sauce and jalapeno. We got fresh claw crab meat from the seafood department - seemed expensive, but made 8 large cakes for around $20 - so really, quite reasonable. The mayo/chili sauce topping was just the ticket! Did not need all the bread crumbs - only put 1 cup in the recipe and maybe had 1 cup to dredge the cakes in. Yum!

My husband substituted canned salmon for the crab and used 4 tsps sweet thai chili sauce instead of hot chili sauce for the mayonnaise. The substitution was wonderful!!! Great way to have seafood cakes at a lower cost.
