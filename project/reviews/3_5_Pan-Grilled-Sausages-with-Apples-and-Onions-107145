Great fall recipe. My whole family loved it, even a picky 3 year old! I made it with apple sausage and followed recipe almost exactly. I didn't have lemon, so I used a squeeze of orange in the sauce, but it came out perfect! Went well with baked potaotos on the side. Quick weekday meal that tastes like more time went into it.

The recipe did not specify slicing the sausages, but I did in about 1/4 in. slices before browning in 1 1/2 T.REAL butter. Use a good quality sausage. I used a new product by Hillshire Farm/Gourmet Creations Chicken Apple with Gouda Cheese Premium Smoked Chicken Sausage found in the packaged meat section near sausage links. Fresh sage! Sweet mild onion works the best. A good quality apple cider that is 100% juice made the dish. Made this for a ladies luncheon where we all brought apple dishes. I never would have tried this recipe without this inspiration but I am glad I did!

If you rate this based soley on ease and simplicity, then it should be four forks but I couldn't quite bring myself to give it an exceptional rating. . . It couldn't be easier. My husband and I both love it. We prefer to use a fairly spicy sausage. And because I usually don't have apple juice on hand, I've used orange juice instead. Sometimes I add a bit of white wine along with chicken broth to finish it. Don't skimp on the apples or the quality of the sausage!

Great easy week night dinner. We used chicken sausages (italian) which were a hit even with the kids. Served with mash potatoes and green beens - we will be making this again this winter

This is a delicious fall treat after apple picking. Be sure to serve with a rustic bread and a big SAm Adams Octoberfest!

This is a great combination and is part of our weeknight rotation. I double the apples and use Amy's chicken sausage with apple and gouda. Because I don't use apple juice or cider much, I use organic apple juice in juice boxes - one is the perfect size.

My boyfriend had one of his periodic sausage cravings, so I made this in order to try something new. We both thought that it was excellent. I agree with the other reviewers who said that it's a nice, delicious weeknight dinner. I followed some other reviewers' suggestions and used twice the amount of apples and onions. It made A LOT, but we ate it all. I should also mention that we used half the amount of sage because 2 tbsp seemed like it would overpower the whole dish, but in retrospect, I think that it would have been okay. Also, the lemon juice smells like a lot at first, but it adds a nice freshness to the dish.

thought this was just ok, followed everything exactly as recipie says, but it just was kind of blah...and used good sausage from Whole Foods and good local cider...oh well...

Very good; easy. I followed the recipe as is, other than using vegetarian apple/"pork" sausages, and it came out great.

This is pure comfort food. When new potatoes are in season and the weather is cool (quite often in Denmark) I make this and server it with mashed potatoes with wild garlic and baby spinach and arugula.

This dish is fantastic. My husband is a vegetarian so I don't get to make it often enough. It's a perfect fall dish.

This was fantastic! We made it with organic rosemary and garlic lamb sausages from Lava Lake Lamb in Idaho and it was fantastic. We doubled the amount of the onion/apple mixture (and would have been happy with more), red onions added wonderful color, we used 1/2 apple juice 1/2 chicken stock as other reviews suggested, and we used 1/2 the butter called for - all of which turned out wonderfully well. We served the dish with portobello mushroom potato pancakes and homemade french bread - it was absolutely fantastic. The Lava Lake sausages were absolutely exquisite, and the dish made for an gourmet meal that was super easy to prepare. You can find the sausages at www.lavalakelamb.com. They arrived on the east coast at our family's home as part of a Christmas present and were a favorite gift.

This is really good. I followed other suggestions and used 1/2 C. of chicken broth and 1/2 C. of apple cider. 1 C. of cider would make the dish too sweet. I also topped the sausages and apple/onion mixture with some grated extra sharp white cheddar cheese before topping with the sauce and it was the perfect touch to meld all of flavors together. A cozy Fall meal, that is really easy to put together.

Great Recipe. Quick and easy to make. I put in some white wine and a few scoops of spicy apple butter and it came out great! Try it.

I made this dish along with a mashed potato and sage recipe from this site, and it really turned out to be a sort of fancy sausage-and-mash. We had it with organic french cider, which went well with the apple flavours...

I absolutely loved this dish. I just had some leftovers for lunch and and so happy I have more at home! (I cook for 1). It was so simple and "fall." I didn't have any fresh sage on hand so I subbed dried parsley and basil(only a pinch or so of each), and thought it was fine. Already sent the recipe to 4 people! I had it with spinach on the side, next time will have potato cakes. Fabulous!

Just made this recipe tonight, and it's an easy, tasty weeknight meal. I had some chicken-apple sausages, and was looking for something different than the usual peppers-and-onions or sauerkraut routine. Because some reviewers mentioned that it turned out a little too sweet, I substituted some chicken broth for some of the apple cider (half broth/half cider). That made a perfect balance of sweet and savory flavors in the sauce. I'd make more sauce next time since it did reduce a lot. I served mashed cauliflower as a side, and the sauce went really well. I didn't peel the apple, but my husband didn't like it that way so next time I will peel it.

This is a really delicious, simple winter dish. We made this after a day of apple picking and served it with potato pancakes and it hit the spot. That was a few weeks ago, and I am making it again tonight! When I decided to look the recipe up again, I figured I should give it a review. It is worth making.

This dish was simply okay for us. It was a little too sweet for my husband. I liked it, but probably not enough to make it again.

Excellent midweek meal. I have made it with fresh sausages (chorizos, italian) as I'm not a fan of pre-cooked. This really only adds very little to overall cooking time, and makes for a tastier dish, in my opinion. I've also used apple juice instead of cider, in a pinch, and it's been fine. Truly lovely dish that should be tried.

I used chicken apple sausage and plain old apple juice, and found this dish very yummy. The sauce reduced too much too fast, so I might add another 1/2 cup of liquid next time. Served with new potatoes and braised kale-- perfect Fall dinner!

As so many have said, fast, simple, delicious! I used Aidelles sun dried tomato sausages. I made it even faster. Didn't peel the apples, no need and it kept them from falling appart. I reduced the sauce in the pot right along with the onions, apples and sausages. My sauce was very thick and delicious. I will definatly make this again! I've already bought some artichoke sausages to experiment with.

This is such a homey treat. Like many other reviewers I was confused and disinterested by "fully cooked sausage". But due to a lack of interesting fresh sausauges at the grocery store I ended up with a generic, very processed and very much cooked "smoked pork sausage". It was delicious all the same and all the quicker to make. Turns simple ingredients into something special, a reason to grow sage in your garden! Oh, I skipped the last step of removing stuff and making a sauce. Who cares when it's something this simple?

Sorry to be the only nay-sayer, but my family and I did not think this recipe was that great. I wouldn't make it again.

I'm giving this recipe the coveted four-fork rating for two reasons: 1, the flavors really are just wonderful; and 2, this dish is incredibly quick and easy to prepare. We served it with garlic mashed pototatoes and sauteed red chard -- it was a beautiful, delicious fall meal, and quick enough for a work night. We'll be making this often during cold weather.

Not to repeat other reviewers but this was a wonderful meal. And in regards to that extra sauce/broth? Throw in a half a head of cabbage to saute along with the onions and apples. It boosted the veggie:meat ratio and made a bigger portion, without diminshing the intestity of the sauce taste at all. Yum yum.

I loved this recipe so much. My husband, on the other hand, found it to be too sweet for his taste. Double the apples and onion mixture because those who will like it will gobble it up quickly.

At the risk of sounding redundant, this recipe is delicious. I used Johnsonville Mild Italian Sausage links that I nuked for about 5 minutes, and then browned in the skillet before adding the apple and onion slices. After adding the cider, I cooked it way too long as I waited for it to "reduce". (We had very little onion or apple slices left to put the sausages over, as they had disintegrated.) Next time, after adding the cider and sage and bringing it to a boil, I would add a mixture of cornstarch and water to thicken it. I had plenty of sauce (i.e. juice) to serve on both the sausage and plain white rice. My husband really liked this and can't wait for me to make it again. (P.S. It needs a lot of pepper and a little salt at the very end.)

This recipe is fantastic -- a perfect fall treat. It's also fast!

A really good fall-ish dish. I followed the recipe to a tee and was quite pleased with the results. Instead of buying pre-cooked sausage, I used fresh turkey sausage (Jenny-o Brand) and cooked it at 350 for 50 minutes in a pyrex dish. I then followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of the sage (couldn't find and fresh at my supermarket) so I used 1 & 1/4 Tbsp of powdered and it still worked out great. My 9 month pregnant wife agreed!

I tried this on the strength of prior reviews although it looked a little too "north woods hardy eatin'" for my family's taste. It was just superb, even with dried sage. If you double the recipe, be judicious with the cider - twice the cider would have been way too much sauce.

This was fantastic. I took someone's advise and served it with potato and cheese pierogi.I used fresh pork andouille sausage which I skinned and precooked ahead of time. Don't you think some cheddar would be nice sprinkled over top?

Absolutely delicious! Used polish sausage cut into chunks and it was great! My husband, who is a purist and before I tried it would have preferred the sausage fixed with his traditional sauerkraut, was very surprised with the outcome and enthusiastic about having this recipe again!

This was a big hit... and gets a full four forks for being extra easy to make! This was soooo simple but big on flavor -- the tart apple and lemon were yummy, as was the fresh sage. Thought the amount of sage would be too much, but it was perfect. I used smoked (low-fat) sausages and the whole combo was great. Will make this dish a fall/winter regular!
