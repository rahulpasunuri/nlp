I made this when it was first published, and am still making it to this day for dinner parties and special family occasions. It's a great crowd-pleaser, and well worth the time it takes to make! I've always followed the recipe using good quality chocolate, and although it takes about 5 minutes longer in my oven, it comes out perfectly every time.

This was so good! I added 1/4 tsp almond extract to the cake batter to boost the almond flavor.

I took this to Easter lunch at my Italian in-laws house, and while it was all the delicious things that previous reviewers have written, I wanted to add a few words about *when* best to eat this torte. And those words are: NOT after an enormous Italian feast!! I recommend serving this decadent dessert after a lighter meal, in order to best appreciate it. I also preferred it straight from the fridge (the next day; we ate it room temp on Easter).

Made this for my mom's birthday...best present I've ever given. Worth all the time, and perfect as is.

I have made this cake several times exactly as written. It takes time but is worth every second. It's an incredible, special dessert. I always serve the Amaretto whipped cream with it. Delicious!!!

I added blood orange zest to the cake batter and made a blood-orange chocolate whipped cream frosting (with orange juice instead of milk, orange zest and orange extract in it). I put the frosting on the side of the torte and pressed toasted almond slivers into the icing. Then I piped icing in a criss-cross pattern on the top, and finished with rosettes around the edge, placing slivered almonds at the intersections. Looked like a bakery bought dessert and was FABULOUS. Two days after I served this one of the party guests said it was the best chocolate cake she has ever had.

I rarely make desserts, but i broke down and made this for my husband for part of a New Year's Eve menu and it was a huge hit. We took the rest to a party the next day and it got rave reviews. I didn't make the Amaretto whipped cream because i don't like either Amaretto or whipped cream, plus the cake is so rich it really doesn't need more cream. We had it with a scoop of vanilla frozen yogurt, which was perfect.

I am planning on getting rid of my Bon Appetit magazines and relying on this web-site for my favorite recipes...but not without making sure this one was on here. I love this recipe and plan to make it for many years to come! Always a big hit and always comes out perfect.

I followed all the tips for determining if the cake was cooked but the end result was quite soupy. The taste was great but the center of the cake was liquid. After refridgerating it firmed up some but I wonder if I should have baked it longer or maybe not folded the egg whites in so much. Did others have a liquid center?

I am an absolute beginner and made this cake for the first time for guests. The outcome was marvellous, so soft and chocolatey. Goes very well with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

This was really delicious. I think I should have baked it a little bit longer and it would have been even better. The consistency changes so much when it's room temp, versus refrigerated. It crumbled into brownie like clumps when I was cutting it at room temp, but still tasted incredible.

I've made this cake 3 times and everyone was completely blown away. Great make ahead for special occasions. It should be renamed Death by Chocolate Almond Souffle. It can feed more than the recipe says - a little sliver will do ya...

It was gobbled up quickly. A big hit.

I have made this recipe 3 times for the same guests and they keep asking for the recipe and the dish again and again. My husband adores it!

One question - is it 2 Tablespoons of sugar as used or 4 as written in ingredients?

I doubled the recipe and made two- one for each side of the family for Christmas dinner- It worked out perfect, I finished them both early christmas eve, put one in the car and the other in the fridge for traveling Christmas day. It tasted just as good the next dayand I got to have a quiet morning before the trip (for a change!) Rave reviews on both sides with recipe requests. In fact one aunt (whom shall remain nameless) actually scraped off the wax paper because she couldn't bear to throw it away! Another cousin eat so much over the three days she visited she had to drive home in sweat pants!!

We made this recipe several times and we always receive great reviews. We serve it at room temperature or refrigerated to get a different consistancy.

This is one of my favorite recipes to make for a special dinner with friends. Being able to prepare well in advance is also VERY helpful. I will usuallly stencil the top with confectionary suger for the occasion and serve with raspberries.

Friends of ours made this dessert for our gourmet dinner club on Saturday. It was absolutely delicious. My all time favorite. I highly recommend it.

I have made this twice for guests, and was glad both times that there were leftovers for me to enjoy again....very rich and tasty. As others say, though, it is time consuming to make, so give yourself extra time. Raspberries are a great garnish.

This is my never-fail, always-delicious, "you should do this professionally" dessert. Use absolutely your favorite chocolate because the flavor really comes through.

An exceptional dessert which can be savored by all and appreciated by even the most critical and sated among us. This one never fails to "wow" the guests!

I made this recipe in '97 when the magazine came out, lost it and now have found it again on the Internet!!!This is the most chocolaty, rich, delicious dessert I have ever had. I remember it being time-consuming to make, but well worth the trouble. I made a snowflake-like cutout with little hearts and dusted it with powdered sugar. This is my Valentine's Day present to myself!
