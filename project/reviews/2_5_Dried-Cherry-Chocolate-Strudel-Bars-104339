This was a lot of work for a so-so result. Also I don't know why it calls for almonds because the cherry and chocolate flavors completely overwhelmed them. If texture was the object, then walnuts are cheaper and would have sufficed.

This recipe had several things wrong with it. The cooking time was off by 40 mins. You need to let the dough sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes before rolling. Also, make sure you close all the seams carefully so that the filling doesn't run out like one of mine did. Be careful when slicing so the bar stays intact. Lastly, it is a great combination of ingredients but perhaps someone should try it with an egg wash before baking to soften up the dough. I dusted with confectioners sugar afterward. I will make this again with these modifications.

I made this recipe and got rave reviews on it. I found the dough a bit hard to get to size, but on the 2nd try had an easier time. I also recommend chopping the cherries to smaller pieces. And, don't spread the fillings to the short edges, only the one long edge, otherwise sealing the ends becomes quite tough & goopy. Finally, I think the cooking time should be 20 minutes, not 1hr 20 minutes since mine got pretty brown in 30 minutes, not golden - hate to see what would have happened after another hour. I am making it again tonite and saving the recipe for many future makings.

I found this dough dry and hard to work with ... when rolling the strudels, the filling kept piercing the dough. After baking, there were puddles of caramelized filling, which made removal from parchment difficult, as well as rendering the final result sticky and hard to chew. Because I like the flavor combination, I might try adapting this filling to a phyllo dough strudel. I would also chop the dried cherries into smaller pieces, and perhaps soak them in a little rum or cherry juice ahead of time.
