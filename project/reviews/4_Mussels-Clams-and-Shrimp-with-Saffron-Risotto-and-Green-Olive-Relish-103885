This wasn't risotto, wasn't paella, and it certainly wasn't as good as either of those dishes. Thank goodness for the olive relish, because the dish didn't have a lot of flavor or personality of its own. Ours turned out quite soupy. It wasn't terrible, but it didn't resemble risotto other than the fact that we used carnaroli rice.

My husband and I loved this dish. I made a few changes. I only used shrimp and cooked them in garlic and butter separately and added them just before serving. I did not have green onions so I chopped some spinach and added it just after adding the clam juice and tomatoes. I also did not make the relish since I don't like olives. I added some white pepper at the end. Because it's risotto I also added some shredded parm-reggiano just before serving. It was so good. I will definately make this again.

Risotto is wonderful, and paella is wonderful, so why confuse things by mixing the two? That was my intuition when I decided to make this four-fork-rated recipe, and I wish I had listened to it. Granted, I made a recessionary version; I skipped the clams and mussels, did 18 shrimp, and added two links of fresh chicken andouille sausage (cooked early and added later with the shrimp). For me and my two critics, just felt like something was missing, even after adding some more seasoning (salt and pepper). I don't know that it was replacing clams with sausage, since we all agreed the andouille added flavor. We did the green olive relish, too. Good, but next time I'll stick with risotto OR paella.

I love this recipe--it is so quick and easy. Sometimes I just make the saffron rice to use as a side dish but I generally make it with the seafood and generally with what I have on hand. Yesterday I used sun dried tomatoes in the rice, added the clams near the end of cooking the rice and while those were cooking chopped up some parsley and sauted small scallops and shrimp. Added the seafood and parsley right at the end of cooking.

My husband was particularly fond of this recipe. I didn't use clams and used bay scallops instead of shrimp (so as to avoid another trip to the store!) and substituted lobster stock for the clam juice. I personally thought it was missing something, but maybe what it was missing was the stuff I didn't use? :)

Like another reviewer, I was skeptical about clam juice, so just made a stock with the shrimp peels. Great saffron/shellfish flavor, and I think it's fine to cook the shrimp with the risotto if you like. BUT, next time I will steam the mussels separately in some shrimp stock and tomatoes -- otherwise, it's just too messy (although I know some don't mind) and really the risotto is creamier and more risotto- ish if you can give it some more stirs, but the mussels make that difficult. People who can't stand olives (like my husband) will need to add salt.

Yum! This got the thumbs up from the boyfriend. I think he particularly liked that it all happened in one pan. Will definitely be put in the rotation. Might try adding chorizo next time like someone else suggested. Oh and I think it was fine to cook the shellfish right in with the rest.

This recipe if terrific! I cooked the rice and seafood separately and added them together when they were done.....the olive relish and lemon wedge are the crowning touch.....will definitely make this again...

Recipe is fabulous, especially the olive relish. The shellfish needs to be cooked separately though and put back when the rice is nearly done if you want everything cooked properly.

Great recipe. Add the clams and mussels a little later than the recipe calls for and then add shrimp a few minutes after that. It came out perfectly.

This is delicious and simple to make. Only substitution was fish stock (made by grocer) for the clam juice. I don't think it's necessary to cook the shellfish separately. We enjoyed eating the risotto out of the shells---it made the dining experience more interesting, interactive and sensuous. Relish adds a salty, lemony bite.

Great dish. The only change I made was substituting chicken broth for the clam broth. Bottled clam broth always seems to have an off flavor to me. I don't think the end result suffered in the least. We took our first taste without the relish. It went from good to great with the relish! I don't see any reason to cook the fish separately. You get the juices from the mussels and clams in the risotto and you don't mess up another pan. Served it with a green salad and it was almost a four fork meal.

This was good. Not quite a risotto, but creamier than paella. I didn't follow the advice of others to cook fish separately, but wish I had cooked mussels and clams separately because rice got stuck inside them and made it a bit messy to eat. I did add the seafood later than the recipe calls for. Next time I will cook mussels and clams separately and cut back on the amount of clam juice-- i had a lot of extra liquid at the end. It could use a little spice, maybe spanish paprika or a bit of minced chilis. The green olive relish was perfect with this.

Easy and delicious

Great dish!! I agree with other reviewers that the seafood (especially the shrimp) should be added a little later to give the rice more time to cook. I would try chorizo with it next time. A keeper!!

note to student reviewer below....Paprika is nothing at all like saffron. This is a great recipe.

Rating: 0
Based on the other reviews. I must have done something wrong. Saffron is too expensive for my student budget so I just added some paprika - was that the fatal flaw? I often make amazing risotto but this one was runny, not creamy and tasted far, far too "clammy." The relish was very nice.

Awesome!! This risotto is so easy to make and tastes perfect as is, but I added some sliced portabello mushrooms since mushroom in risotto is a must for me. The clam juice makes a real difference. I agree w/the other cooks who added the seafood in the last couple minutes before completion to keep it from getting chewy. And you MUST include the olive relish (if you don't mind olives). It's the Lucques signature touch that makes this dish stand out above other risottos! I almost bypassed it because I was running late, but I'm glad I included it.

This is a SUPERB recipe, and I have made it many times! The only modification I've made is to cook a pound of either sweet Italian sausage or garlic sausage right before adding the shallots, and then cooking the sausage crumbles and shallots together while following the rest of the recipe. This is a killer recipe and gets RAVE reviews each time!

This is a wonderful recipe! I didn't use the green olive relish since my boyfriend does not like olives. I added some crimini mushrooms and cilantro - the flavor was awesome! I'm definitely going to make this again.

Excellent! Simple and tasty. The only thing I changed was to add the shrimp at the last minute so it wouldn't be chewy.

Easy and delicious. I added scallops and small pieces of chicken sausage. The relish scared me at first, but it was pleasantly surprising and I am glad I made it.

Great dish! I made it without the relish (can't imagine that it would be even better with!) I bought frozen seafood and sauteed it on the side in garlic butter and then added it to the risotto when it was near done.

My husband and I have a Saturday night ritual which includes putting the kids to bed early, opening a bottle of wine and cooking a NEW recipe. We liked the risotto so much that we've broken our own rule and made it twice already. Also, we almost skipped the relish because it seemed out of place. But once we tried it, WOW. Absolutely delicious.

I hate it when people completely change the recipe then complain about how it turned out, but here I go anyway. I tried this recipe exactly the way it's written and I think the seafood needs to be cooked separately or it over cooks. I love the risotto and I've already made it 2 more times for guests. I don't use the clam juice, I substitute canned chicken broth (better flavor) then I serve it with pan seared fish or to use the shellfish, steam the mussels and clams together and saute the shrimp in garlic butter. This is much better. Then you can scoop out the risotto and portion out the seafood without digging through the rissotto for it. The risotto tastes the same with or without the seafood and I love control, so there you have it. This risotto is so good that I made a double batch and then couldn't stop sneaking it out of the fridge cold!!!

My husband made this for me last week, and it was fabulous. The flavors -- particularly with the green olive relish -- combine for a delightful experience. We're making it this weekend for my parents because we liked it so much!
