Bland even though I added red pepper. The whole wheat pasta needs bolder favors than this recipe calls for.

This recipe is delicious if you make a few slight changes. Do not add the Parmesan. That is why other users have said that the flavors don't blend right. The sauce tastes clean and fresh without it. Definitely add a little more fresh basil and oregano at the end of cooking, and a little squeeze of lemon doesn't hurt. Don;t forget to add a little more wine during cooking if necessary.

I don't thing the ingredients go well together. I would either do the tomatoes, spices, garlic and shrimp or wine, mushroom, garlic, spices and shrimp. some users said to add more water and wine, but start out with the recommended amount and then add more if you need more. also, I would put in the shrimp without the tomatoes and the wine, and then add the bouillon and tomatoes if you insist on it. Over all, I would just suggest trying a different recipe.

Great recipe! a lot of chopping but worth it. the flavors are great together. i added some fresh lemon juice about a minute before you turn off the heat and that gave it some more freshness. also i would recommend adding some extra white wine as well.

Lots of prep but worth it in the end. Make sure to add more wine and water (about double of each). Add pepper at the end for a little extra needed spice.

This wasn't awful, but the flavours didn't meld at all. Disappointing, given the good ingredients.

I gave this recipe 4 stars, because it had so much flavor, with so few fat grams. I used "Better Than Bouillon" chicken & mushroom bases (much better than bouillon cubes), you can find them in Publix or larger grocery stores. My husband loved it.
