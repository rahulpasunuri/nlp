this was yum, though i definitely mixed it up quite a bit. i added about twice as much garlic as called for and a bit more onions. used fresh tomatoes, only 1/2 the mushrooms called for (buttons), no shallots, and added two red peppers. definitely no need for vegetable stock, thankfully, as i didn't have any. and i didn't have parmesan, but i used some goat cheese - yum; for my leftovers, i'll be trying to sprinkle in some feta.

The recipe was tasteless. My husband and I prefer big tastes, and the combination of mushrooms, along with the onions, garlic and basil seemed promising. However, the sauce didn't taste much better than a so-so store bought brand.

This was good, but like many I was mystified by the instruction to add a full cup of vegetable stock. Perhaps if I'd prepared the sauce ahead as suggested this would have been necessary, but made day of my sauce was plenty liquidy already. I threw in some pasta water and served.

Great vegetarian pasta recipe. Used dry sun-dried tomatoes and a couple of tablespoons of the soaking liquid instead of the stock, which made it moist enough. To the cook who said too much basil, HUH? Impossible. That's like saying too much garlic ;-)

This was delightful as a first course for a dinner party. I added 1 t crushed red pepper and skipped the stock/parm step because a guest couldn't have dairy. This is also easy to prepare ahead: I made the tomato sauce and the mushroom mixuture separately, and combined them with the fresh basil as the pasta cooked.

Very good.Used whole tomates, crushed by hand(maybe too much). Cooked longer and didn't use stock. Used more shallots. Put cheese in dish, and didn't have any sundried tomatoes.

Made a few changes to the recipe and still came out very good. For starters, I did not do two batches of sauting. I omitted the onion and sauteed the shallots (2 large) and all the garlic. Then added the mushrooms (only used white mushrooms). Used just under 1/4 cup of red wine (didn't have any white). Only had dried basil so had to use that and added the sun-dried tomatoes to the sauce. Simmered the sauce for about 20 mins. with about 1/2 cup of chicken stock. Very easy and not much work esp. if you cut out the fist step. Very good and hearty!

This was yummy but there a few things I didn't like. First of all I didn't add the can of vegetable sauce the recipe called for at the end-the pasta doesn't need it. I thought the basil was a little too overpowering and I do agree, this was A LOT of work....

Very easy and very tasty! A great recipe to toss together for a quick dinner. It works with any kind of pasta.

This was a great dish -- I purchased 1lb of portobello mushrooms at a farmers market and then looked for a sauce recipe that went with the ingredients I had on hand. This was the one! All the flavors complimented one another perfectly -- I also added a little zucchini for extra color and flavor. Definately will make this one again!

This dish looked really good on paper and the reviews were great. However, my experience was that it was too much work for the payoff. The prep work (chopping the garlic, shallots, onion, mushrooms, etc.) may not take as long if you use a food processor, but I didn't so it took me over an hour just to do it. The final result was nothing to write home about. The sauce was bland, and not thick enough to pair well with rigatoni. I will not make this again.

Great pasta dish that can stand on it's own. I made grilled salmon and a chopped salad - we had way too much food. If you want some meat add it to the pasta. I added more garlic and additional shallots because I had them both minced. We always love extra garlic anyway. I used canned Diced Tomatoes with Oregano, Basil and Garlic and added a little more parmesan.

I agree with the previous reviewer-use fresh basil. I did not and it was sorely missed. The sauce is so tasty. One problem, when I added the veg broth it kind of washed out the flavor intensity of the sauce, so I would leave it out next time.

Excellent and easy -- great for a weeknight since you can make the sauce ahead. If you wanted to up the protein -- an italian sausage crumble and cooked with the sauce would be very tasty.

I can understand why the reader wanted this recipe after making this dish myself. It was very easy to make and tastes delicious. The combination of tomato, basil, and mushrooms is exquisite. You must include leaves of fresh basil to finish off this superb dish. Great as a second course or a main course on its' own.
