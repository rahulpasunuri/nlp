We recently joined a CSA and didn't know what we'd do with all the summer squash we'd be given. This is an excellent way to get rid of it! I substituted chicken broth for the water, and instead of the jalapeno, we added a tbsp of hot green salsa, then chilled it and served it cold. I think its fantastic!

This is similar to a sweet potato/corn soup that I make - just as easy but less flavorful. I had the fresh vegies from my csa ('tis the season, as they say) but even so it was only an ok soup. I'll go back to sweet potato next time.

This soup is good, but the addition of sour cream is a must. Takes it to another level.

This is delicious. Added kosher salt to taste and I subbed crushed dry red peppers for jalapeno in soup (1/4 tsp) and topping and parsley for cilantro. It's very pretty to serve if you put the sliced, small yellow squash in a flower design in center of bowl. Top with a dollop of sour cream in center of flower. Surround with the corn and sprinkle of red pepper flakes to taste. Then sprinkle with parsley. This is "company" good. (Per reviewer suggestion, I tried some w/mint and didn't care for it.)

I used veggies from my CSA share, which are normally very tasty, but this soup ended up very bitter!

Rating: 0
I started with the basic recipe, using chicken stock, but but as many have said, it needed more. So, I added a little honey mustard to balance out a hint of bitterness, and some curry powder, cumin, and coriander warmed in olive oil. The soup welcomes a good amount. At the end I added a little smoked paprika and juice of one lemon and served topped with sour cream and a sprinkling of smoked paprika. Guests loved it. It was great before a salad of radicchio, arugula, pine nuts, raisins, and shrimp poached in an orange vinaigrette (Joyce Goldstein recipe).

This soup was light and delicious, perfect for a hot summer evening alongside grilled chicken. While I sometimes find the "the recipe was amazing! I changed everything!" postings amusing, I don't know that this necessarily needed all of the suggestions. That being said, the augmentations listed by other users sound delicious. Back on point: I'm not a huge fan of cumin, so I used Penzey's Chicago Steak seasoning, and I didn't have fresh corn so I used frozen. I'm sure it would be just as delicious with fresh. Served with a bit of sour cream and avocado, this will definitely be getting made again, as-is.

This recipe was delicious. The only adjustment I made was to substitute half the water with chicken stock. It was easy, quick, and very tasty.

This is a surprisingly delicious recipe, where the squash provides a silky texture that keeps the soup from being too thick or chowder-like (which often happens when I make a corn-based soup). The chile adds just the right punch. As to those who found the texture odd: after pureeing I run the whole batch through a fine mesh sieve, then add salt and garnishes. It's also incredibly easy to double--which is worth knowing, in case you're inundated with squash from your garden or CSA.

I've made this recipe twice now. I LOVE it, and think it's so simple and delicious. The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars, is that I took a lot of the recommended changes from the reviews and applied them to the dish. So I really don't know if I'm rating a recipe or other reviewer's ideas. :-P Based on other reviews, I added Greek Yogurt when blending, used Veggie Broth instead of water, and added in fresh basil and mint. It's very healthy (I used 0% Fage), and creamy. A perfect summer comfort food! Definitely making again next year!

I liked the texture and spiciness of this dish. Unlike others, I did not find it watery. It needed quite a bit of salt to bring the flavor out. I like that it is a healthy dish.

Simple and quick-- I improvised with frozen sweet corn and cayenne instead of jalepeno. Used homemade croutons for garnish. Delicious.

Definitely needed more kosher salt and seasoning (paprika, pepper and heat like the other reviewers suggested), but the chunky corn and yellow squash had a very summery flavor that was really nice. For an extra layer of flavor, I chopped some fresh mint and basil to stir into the soup while it was hot.

Was surprised how good this was despite the reviews. Made as written but used chicken stock instead of water (still have bad memories of "soup" made by a roommate in college, which consisted of pureed butternut squash and water). My boyfriend has been happily talking about this since I made it so I'm making a triple batch tonight.

Not a bad recipe but I do think it helps to augment things a bit. I ended up adding some bell pepper and grilling all of the veggies which added some nice flavor. Instead of water I used chicken stock which I think helped a lot. I also added a bit of cyan pepper which added a bit of a bite. I blended the whole thing up with a hand blender and it turned out with the right level of smoothness and chunk. I served it with a dollop of sour cream, some jalapeño slices and a few dashes of smoked paprika but I think it would have also gone nicely with some adobo sauce or a few dashes of hot sauce.

This recipe, as one can see from the myriad reviews that read "I just added 14 other ingredients and it was WONDERFUL", is a dud, really nothing more than a jumping off point. I also altered it to death. I used less chicken broth, no cumin, but rather cayenne and smoked paprika, oregano and thyme. I used a cup of squash, and seven ears of corn, so there was no problem with watery-ness. I also cooked it in 4 tbsp butter, squeezed in half a lemon to the sauteed vegetables, and during the pureeing I added 4 tbsp of grated parmesan cheese, and once I pureed it I added about a cup of 2% milk. It was good soup, but it sure wasn't this lousy recipe.

Like other reviewers, I believe that this recipe is good with many revisions. 1. Definitely use chicken broth instead of water 2. Use 4x (or more) cumin 3. Add some red pepper flakes for color and heat 4. Add some fat once you puree it. Either butter or sour cream would probably work, but it needs a little creaminess. 5. The garnishes are a MUST. Finally, I warn against using roasted corn. The taste is good, but the color is not. Served with a side of cornbread, this recipe is a good weeknight meal that you can whip up from stuff in the freezer. One last thing: the texture is more like a chowder, so I can't imagine serving it cold...

I made this soup with a few modifications listed in other reviews (added onion, used chicken stock & other spices). I left out the jalapenos to keep it milder for the kids. The flavor was delicious but the texture was odd. My husband said it was the texture of baby food so I froze the leftovers in small containers to use as a tasty puree for my baby. I think it will be perfect for that.

As is, this recipe needs a LOT of help. It was really watery, even though I didn't use all of the cooking water to puree. After adding salt, sugar, cheese and cream, it tasted much better. Would definitely substitute chick broth for the water next time as well.

I cooked up a bunch of carrots w/ olive oil, cinnamon, cardamom, and cumin and added that to the recipe. Also I used aprox. twice as much squash and zucchini, and more garlic. Switched leeks for sweet onions because I had them on hand, and lastly, I used cayanne, cumin and curry powder, and I was generous w/ all of them. This was a wonderful variation and nice and light for the middle of summer.

This is the BEST corn chowder recipe I've ever tried. Simple and fast, yet nothing's missing. I use squash, jalapeno and cilantro from my garden, and it can't be more delicious. Garden fresh jalapenos are so dreamy. :-) I've started cutting off the kernels at the end and adding them after blending, which is great. I also occasionally add a tomato or two. It's a very versatile recipe - I don't think you can go wrong.

I made a few modifications based on what I had to work with...and the result turned out great! I used 1/2 an onion and curry powder (lots more of it) instead of cumin. It was a great way to eat up that squash, since I'm the only one in the house that eats it. It was also a great alternative to the super dairy-heavy winter soup I make with corn and potatoes.

Very tasty and easy to prepare. I added lots more spices- nutmeg, paprika, and coriander. I like the chunky texture of it. The toppings are essential. I served cilantro and sour cream and it really finished it off.

I liked it, my husband didn't. It needs tweaking. Garlic was a little strong and will add more corn and more herbs. I like that it doesn't need milk or cream. One of my grandson's is highly allergic to dairy and this is perfect for him.

i used lobster stock instead of just water and used about 4 or 5 ears of corn (they were kind of small). i also couldn't find fresh jalepenos so i used chopped jalepenos in a jar and it was delicious! (didn't use them in the garnish, just the soup base) didn't come out silky smooth, i think you need to use a chinoise for that, which i don't have. i thought the result had nice texture though, always getting little bites of corn with each spoonful. would make it again.

Many "holes" in this recipe. I have found it always best to "sweat" the onions and squash in the olive oil first in a covered pot, before adding other ingredients. This is not mentioned. I used fresh corn as suggested. This did not puree very well. The total effect of the soup was more like something in between a puree and lumps. Try the yellow bell pepper and yellow squash soup instead. It's smooth and elegantly delicious.

I agree that this is an excellent base recipe, but needs changes. Def. use stock, increase garlic and onion or shallot content, and add what ever spices you like. I use curry and a bit of nutmeg abnd more jalapeno. It is so easy, quick, low fat, and wonderfully versitile with what ever you have in your kitchen. I like to top it with poached shrimp or chicken to make it a "complete" meal, and definitely prefer it hot. Freezes well too!

Making this for the fourth time in two weeks! If you have tons of squash multiply the recipe, and give the soup to neighbors. They will thank you immensely!

Like many others I varied the recipe. Chicken stock is a definite. I made this as a special in my restaurant on a horribly humid day and it still flew out the door. And we served it hot!! It will be part of our repetorie all summer.

Variations that worked for me since i was lacking the proper ingredients: used chicken broth instead of water no jalapeno, instead used 1 heaping tsp. pureed chipotles (heat AND great flavor) no shallots, used 1/2 of one purple spring onion and increased the garlic to 5 cloves used 1 can of trader joe's corn, and about 1 cup frozen i used three large round yellow squash (prob more than 1 lb) added chopped cilantro while cooking (leaves and stems) pureed as outlined. lots of changes, but this variation rocked!

I made so many changes I almost shouldn't review this, but it's a good starter recipe for our favorite summer veggies. Like the previous reviewer, I used already-grilled corn, and scraped the cobs to get every bit of juice instead of adding the cobs to the soup. I added ground chipotle pepper with the cumin, and I finished it with a bit of cream, a handful of chopped cilantro and a leftover cooked chicken breast that I shredded. Oh, and I served it hot. The flavors worked well together and I plan to make some variation of this again.

Made a few changes out of necessity. Used already grilled corn (didn't bother with the cobs in the simmering), bunch of scallions, and pickled jalapeno slices. Followed the rest of directions and when the pureed mix was a tad too thick I added a bit of skim milk to the mix. Also seasoned with S & P while cooking AND after adding milk. Wonderful COLD soup!!

I had no shallots, used an ordinary onion and a couple of green onions; had no jalopeno pepper, used Tabasco--5 dashes; had no yellow squash, used 2 small green ones. My husband said to keep the recipe. I liked it room temperature better than hot, but he likes things hot. It made a plenty for 2 large bowls.

This looked like an easy and healthful way to use up some squash and corn but one hour, one messy kitchen and one thrice washed food processor later had me wondering whether the good folks in the Conde Nast kitchens really do test every recipe before publication. It tasted like water with a corn infusion. Added milk -- creamed corn, added more milk and more chiles -- spicy but watery corn chowder. Added kidney beans, topped with cheese and baked -- edible, but the leftovers sat in the fridge for a week before I finally gave up and threw them away. With more doctoring, perhaps something delicious could have come of this recipe but, frankly, I'm over it.

My husband and I hate squash - but we received alot of it as part of a eco-farm co-op, so I tried this recipe. It tastes more like corn than squash so we both really liked it! I took a previous reviewer's advice and halved the jalapeno - it was perfect! It was also easy - I was able to go from start to finish while my daughter watched a Raffi video!

The texture of this soup is wonderful. Next time I will use less jalapeno because I found that it dominated the soup. I served it hot, but I would try it chilled next time. Delicious!
