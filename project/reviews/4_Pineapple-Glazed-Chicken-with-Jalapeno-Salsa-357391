While this was good, it was not great. It did not make us stand up and applaud, saying "this is something we have to make again"--which is my four-fork criterion. don't get me wrong, it's a nice little dish, but the glaze--to my taste--was insufficient. thickening sauces has always been a weakness in my cooking though, and it might be due to that.

While I'm always skeptical when I see a recipe with condiment mustard in it,this was delicious!I listened to all the reviews here and at made at least DOUBLE the salsa and glaze as well! BUT (This is why I only gave it 3 stars,but its a 4 in MY mind.And,I know,I know some of you wil be annoyed) I also did marinate the chicken 1st in pineapple juice ,soy sauce and garlic for 8 hrs.I did this because tih alot of these 'glazed' protein meals,I always feel that there was more flavor than just meat/pork/chicken on the INSIDE. Marinadting or no,this dish was superb,and the salsa was SO beloved by my gues he ended up eating it all ,withou even telling us!:P

Used this recipe for orange roughy and it turned out great on the fish. Quadrupled the salsa and had enough for leftovers the next day.

Thanks to other reviewers for the great tips which I employed. Used boneless skinless breasts and cooked on the grill (it's too hot in the summer for the oven!). Did the soy/juice/garlic marinade, tripled the sauce and doubled the salsa. Used my garden fresh spicy jalapenos and I do not remove anything as I like it HOT. Great with brown rice, quinoa, whatever. Left overs were just as awesome. A keeper!

Great recipe - nice presentation. I served the chicken over couscous. I modified the salsa according to what I had already at home. I didn't have red onions, so I used sweet Vidalia onions. I also didn't have red peppers on hand, so I used tomatoes. My husband doesn't like cilantro, so I used fresh basil. The salsa turned out very colorful and tasty.

Made this last night; fantastic! Took advice from others and tripled the glaze and doubled the salsa. I also used a whole cut up chicken since my fiancé prefers dark meat. I also added a tablespoon of Tabasco to the glaze as another person posted and used 2 fresh jalapenos instead of canned. For us the little spice was perfect, and it was beautiful on the plate! This one's a keeper.

Tried as written and later with fish. Fantastic both ways. Glaze is very good...do use yellow mustard, other types just do not have the same flavor and zing. Salsa is great, made too much and can't wait for leftovers.

SUPER EASY FAST & YUMMY recipe!!! Like other reviewers recommended- I first marinated in soy sauce/pineapple juice/minced garlic and then I doubled the glaze and salsa ingredients, and basted every 10 minutes for the 35 minute cooking time (last 5 min broiled). I also substituted honey mustard because it's what I had on hand and don't mind the sweetness it added to the dish. Only thing I would change for next time- I would reserve extra glaze to spoon over chicken when plated (and then serve extra for dipping). Also, I might try adding avocado chunks to the salsa (to make it a bit heartier if I'm having people over- otherwise, this was perfect for an everyday, light dinner).

modified the recipe some. used chicken breasts. seared for about 2 mins each side, brushed with glaze and then baked.half way through added some of the extra sauce i made to the cast iron skillet and cooked till done. chicken very moist. very fresh, healthy meal but was expecting more heat. used fresh jalapenos. i like spicy food, so needs something. would welcome suggestions.

Used boneless skinless chicken breasts and basted with the glaze often. They worked fine. Subbed canned pineapple and fresh jalapenos. The salsa had a great kick. Used extra glaze as a finishing sauce, and served it over red quinoa. It was a delicious, colorful, healthy meal.

Phenomenal and I am not a huge fan of Jalapenos. My whole family loved it to include 3 kids ages 6-10. It was very easy. I used a little less cilantro than called for in the salsa I also doubled the recipe for the salsa and tripled the recipe for the sauce.The chicken took a few more minutes to cook than stated but I also cut my chicken breast in half to reduce the 40 minute cook time others were having issues with. Served it over jasmine rice and it was perfection. Overall a very tasty fresh recipe!

Awesome Recipe! The salsa makes completely makes the dish! I doubled all the sauce and salsa ingredients. The salsa tastes even better after marinating in its own juices over night. Next time I will triple the salsa recipe so we can have it later in the week to eat with chips :) I wasn't able to find the right chicken, so I had to use 3 boneless skinless chicken breast. I basted the chicken with the pineapple sauce every 10 minutes. We don't like things too sweet so I added tobasco to the sauce, like another user suggested. I also sprinkled some ground red pepper (cayenne pepper) over the chicken breasts about 10 mins before broiling. The cooking time was different for me than listed. I baked my chicken about 35 minutes before broiling for 5 minutes... so total of 40 minutes. I guess it really depends on what chicken you're using... all my boneless skinless chicken dishes take about 40 mins, so I wasn't surprised when this one did as well. I served it over brown rice and topped it with salsa and ground pepper. Overall, this dish was delicious and one of my new favorites!

Beautiful dish that comes together quickly on a weeknight. Used fresh jalapeno - not sure why you'd bother with canned. The colorful salsa is beautiful; next time I'll make twice as much. I served this with a quinoa with black beans recipe currently at NPR at http://www.npr.org/2011/01/13/132878264/demand-for-quinoa-a-boon-for-bolivian-farmers

Wow, this was very, very good! The only modification I made was using half of a fresh jalapeno instead of the canned variety, which I would highly recommend. Quick to make, and the flavor of the pineapple glaze was fantstic. We also loved, loved the jalapeno salsa. It really made the entire dish bright and fresh. I will definitely be making this again.

We really enjoyed this recipe. The time of cooking isn't accurate. I would add like 5 more minutes in the oven before adding the glaze and broiling but obviously use a thermometer. I doubled the salsa recipe which was a good idea because it's amazing. The only thing I would say is to also double the glaze recipe so you can add some when you serve it. I served it over rice. With the extra glaze next time I would give it 4 forks. Definitely a must make.

Pretty strong, but everyone loved it. I used a seeded fresh jalapeño, instead of canned. I also cut up some fresh mango with the pineapple, but didn't think the mango added anything to the dish. Very quick and easy to make with lots of flavor

This is an easy recipe that never disappoints. Literally the most complex thing about this recipe is remembering to get back to the chicken to brush with the glaze a second time during cooking. Easy Recipe and delicious.

I made this using boneless, skinless chicken breasts. The chicken was very moist but not as flavorful as I had hoped but stily yummy. I doubled the salsa. It was delicious. I served this with salad and brown rice. The salsa mixed in with brown rice was exceptional. Easy recipe. I would make it again.

I highly suggest adding 1 tbs of tabasco sauce to the glaze! It gives the glaze a perfect sweet then spicy kick, without being overwhelmingly spicy. I also add what's left of the glaze to the salsa and mix it up before serving. The boyfriend loves it.

This was great and a hit with both the boyfriend and our guests! I doubled the glaze, mixed a tad in with the salsa and chopped it in a food processor. I also grilled the chicken and brushed it with glaze throughout the grilling process. Served it all over jasmine rice. Yum. The salsa was such a hit they broke out tortilla chips to finish it off. Will be making this again for sure!

I omitted the spicy pepper for a sweet green pepper, no red pepper too. My husband loved it! Said I out did myself. I loved the fresh herbs taste! i took a picture of the finsihed food on a nice red square plate and posted it on FB. Yummy!

Usually I am not a huge chicken lover and neither are the people I made it for but this recipe made the chicken taste so delicious and moist that I would definitely make it many more times! I changed a few things within the recipe like using skinless chicken breast, fresh jalapenos instead of canned, and for the salsa I used chopped up mangoes and a nectarine and it tasted delicious right out of the oven and as leftovers. The salsa on top was a huge hit so definitely make more than the amount stated!

This was fantastic. I also tripled the glaze and the salsa and was glad. We had more than enough salsa but loved and used every bit of glaze. At first I thought the salsa would be too spicy. When I taste tested it I was concerned, but over the chicken it was perfect. I agree with others that it would work great with fish, especially fish tacos. Will definitely make again.

This one was pretty freaking good! My first recipe made from Epicurious! I actually tweaked it a bit... 325 convection oven for 35 minutes. And doubled the glaze recipe to have extra to baste every 10 minutes or so. I added a pinch of cayenne pepper to the salsa to give it a real good kick! Served with steamed asparagus with butter and lemon and basmati rice. My husband devoured it lol!

I made this last night for my boyfriend and it was a huge hit. NO LEFTOVERS! I pretty much doubled the recipe and used two medium sized chicken breasts and about 5 good sized drumsticks. The drumsticks cooked for at least 15 minutes longer than the breasts, but the skin got nice and crispy and delicious. Paired with jasmine rice, a shot of Patron and a couple light beers, with baked apples and ginger snaps for dessert. Really quite amazing. And yes, I got some love for this one!

I am a college student living in Myrtle Beach and like to cook without spending a lot of money, this is one of those meals. I cooked the chicken as directed but I used skinless breasts. My glaze didn't thicken until it was on heat for about 7 minutes. Instead of jarred jalapenos I used fresh jalapenos and it gave the salsa a little bit of a kick. The chicken was a little on the sweet side but was still amazing. The prep time was longer than I expected but well worth it. Thought about making it with fish, maybe salmon, or grilling the chicken instead of baking it. I will definitely have to make this again and try new things.

I cooked the chicken a bit differently - using breasts all the same size, i poked each breast in the thickest part with a fork 2x. Applied the glaze, then baked at 300 in a glass pan for 35 minutes. Then, I pan seared in olive oil about 3-4 minutes per side. The most moist, juicy chicken I have ever made. I also added diced avocado to the salsa - will definitely make this again!

Rating: 3
I made this as stated using thin chicken breasts and half the cilantro. I diced the cooked chicken and put it and the salsa over a bed of romaine lettuce and used the leftover glaze as a dressing. My glaze never thickened so it worked nicely. Next time I might mix in some white wine vinegar to cut down the sweetness (although it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet to begin with). I really enjoyed it and will definitely make again - will be a summer staple.

If you are finding the chicken bland try chicken thighs instead of breasts. Don't forget to season the chicken with salt and pepper before it goes into the oven.

I think can be substituted with other juices apart from pineapple juice,like cranberry juice or strawberry juice.

I used mango instead of pineapple and mahimahi instead of chicken to do a lighter meal and it was amazing!!! i think the fish suites this salsa topping much better than chicken would. My family couldnt stop commenting on the vibrant taste and color. Also, using a small can of chopped green chiles and cayenne pepper substitutes nicely for the jalepeno

I used mango instead of Pineapple and switched the chicken to mahimahi for a healthier meal and it was amazing!!!! make sure you get the glaze right and green chiles work fine instead of jalepenos. awesome tho my family was impressed at the vibrant taste and color

The chicken is on the bland side. The glaze needs a little corn starch slurry to thicken well. I figured that out after the the first 15 minutes in the oven. I'll try it from the start next time and maybe the flavor of the glaze will adhere to the chicken. Salsa was great. The recipe here left out the jalapenos in the ingredients but if you print it it is there.

The salsa on this recipe is very good, though the chicken seemed a little flavorless. The things I would change are as follows. I would first tenderize the chicken, cut up the pineapple chunks to smaller pieces. I might even try grilling it. I served it over jasmine rice and i found it to complement the chicken well.

I am a college senior, and I don't have a lot of cooking experience; however, this recipe was super easy and delicious!

I highly recommend this recipe - I think it would also be superb with salmon!
