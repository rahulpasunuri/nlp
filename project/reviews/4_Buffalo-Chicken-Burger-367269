Awesome Recipe! I made this one right on the grill and it came out great. Just make sure to follow the advice of the other reviews; Stuff the patties rather than mix the cheese in with the meat. The best way to do this is by making a layer of the chicken, add the cheese, and then add another layer of the meat, creating a delicious stuffed burger! I used a nice spicy buffalo sauce and it came out perfect, just the right amount of spice. I will definitely be making this again.

My family really didn't like this recipe, especially the soft texture given by the bleu cheese mixed in with the patty meat. Also, there was not enough spice on the burgers with just the sauce brushed on the outside. If you make this recipe you should probably follow the instructions of one of the other reviewers and put the cheese into the middle of the patty and then add extra hot sauce to the patty meat.

Yuck, spit. My entire family really thought this was at best, not good. So much easier and better to grill chicken breasts and top with buffalo sauce and blue cheese rather than making these icky patties. Sorry, but for us, this one was a stinker.

Made recipe a second time, on the grill. Burgers had a tendency to shrink, so make patties large if cooking this way. I also made 'Stuffed Baked Potato with Blue Cheese & Rosemary' for a simple side dish to go along with it. Still a hit!

This recipe was wonderful! My boyfriend from Buffalo absolutely loved it. For any low-carb kickers out there, I grilled two halves of a green bell pepper with olive oil in place of a keiser roll, and it was very healthy and delicious. I also followed other reviewer's and folded the blue cheese in the middle of the patties before pan searing. What a great recipe!

This was a surprisingly good recipe. The burgers were moist and very flavorful. I added salt, pepper, and a few splashes of hot sauce to the meat mixture. A thin slice of blue cheese melted on the burger was also a nice addition. Will make these in the future.

These are amazing -- the closest thing to chicken wings without all the fat. The burger almost gets a crispy coating thanks to the egg white and panko. Per the suggestion of another cook, I made two small patties and sandwiched the cheese inside -- worked perfectly. My husband (who needs an occasional wing fix) was ooohing throughout the meal. Kids enjoyed them too (w/ little to no wing sauce). A DEFINITE "make again."

We made this recipe as written but just halved it since there is only two of us. It was a great semi-healthy recipe. We made it with baked sweet potato fries to cool our mouths after the spicy burger. Yummmy!

This is a great recipe, especially if you are in search of something different than what you probably typically eat. I substituted ground turkey for the chicken and chopped onions for the carrots. For the "heat" I used Frank's Red Hot Sauce. We cooked on the BBQ grill and they turned out great! To me the blue cheese is what really makes this great--but if you don't like blue cheese but still like "hot"-- you could substitute any other type of cheese or not use any at all.

I made these burgers for dinner tonight on the stove using a ridged cast-iron grill pan. I didn't serve them with the recipe's carrot-celery-dip accompaniment, but instead made the Cole Slaw recipe on this site that calls for apple, carrot, cabbage and mayo, etc. I made two changes to the burger prep: 1) Instead of "roughly chopping" the celery, I finely minced it. (I didn't want large chunks of raw celery in my burgers.) 2) Instead of adding the blue cheese to the burger mix, I sliced the blue cheese into 1 TBS chunks, and "sandwiched" them between a top and bottom layer of the burger mix. (This added to overall prep time, but I didn't want that lovely, expensive blue cheese melting away on the grill pan.) Another small change was the hot sauce. I can't get "Tabasco Buffalo Style sauce" where I live, so I combined 4 tsp of melted butter, 5 tsp of Tabasco, and 3/4 tsp cornstarch. My final small change was to spread some reduced calorie mayo on the buns after toasting. I did put iceberg lettuce and thought the crunch / cool factor was tasty. These are "spicy" because of the hot sauce, but they were a great for Friday night.

Yum! The yield is more like 5-6 patties. Also, the carrots needed more than 2 tablespoons of water in the microwave. We used feta rather than blue cheese and it was nice and mild. The following morning I crumbled the extra patty in with chopped bell pepper, celery, egg whites, onion garlic and cumin mixture to make a tasty scramble.
