About the most amazing treat ever. Ginger is my favorite - completely divine.

This is a great recipe for wonderfully spicy doughnuts. This is dense cake doughnut and the little flecks of crystallized ginger are brilliant. My only changes: using a 3 inch doughnut cutter and using safflower oil instead of vegetable oil.

Very, very good. I used a 3 in. doughnut cutter with a center, and they cooked up just fine. You could make half as much ginger sugar and still have enough. The doughnuts are a little dry and don't hold up the next day, but they are SO GOOD hot off the stove. We served them with Blueberry Compote (on this site, added a little lemon juice) for dipping.

These tasted amazing! Great doughnut recipe without yeast. My only tip is to be careful about the temperature of the oil - mine was too hot, so I ended up undercooking the doughnuts while trying to avoid browning them too much. Otherwise, delicious!!

Well, I'd always wanted to try making doughnuts and these were very easy and delicious just after they were cooked but then became quite greasy as they sat around. The recipe makes a lot. If I was to do it again, I'd probably half it, make just what we would eat right then and there. We skipped the ginger and made plain doughnuts tossed with cinnamon sugar. My kids thought it was a lot of fun.

Made this for a Hanukkah celebration and our Jewish friends GUSHED at the memories it invoked of grandmother's doughnuts. Instead of rolling out the dough, made into balls.
