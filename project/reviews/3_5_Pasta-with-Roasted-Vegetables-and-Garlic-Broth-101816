wow! delicious and so simple. i roasted red pepper, fennel, and shallots, and used parsley instead of basil. added cheese at the end instead of in the sauce using others' advice. the roasting makes the vegetables slightly sweet and the garlic more subtle. definitely a keeper recipe.

The standout in this recipe is the simple garlic sauce. It's not in-your-face garlicky, because it's mellowed by both roasting and simmering in the sauce. (Doubling the garlic couldn't hurt, but it depends on who is eating.) While I'm sure it would work well with whatever veggies are on hand, I like the author's choices, which complement the mild garlic sauce very well. I thought I'd have leftovers, but everyone had seconds! I stuck to the recipe, except I used about 1/4 as much pasta and I didn't have basil. Even without basil it was delicious!

Ok, I work and don't have a lot of time to prep and cook...so I used frozen veggies (a mixed package from BJ's that has zucchini, summer squash, brocolli etc...) added mushrooms and anything else on hand that needed using..and sauteed them in a bit of oil. Boiled whole wheat spaghetti... Did not use the oven...sauteed the garlic and added the broth....combined the sauteed veggies, pasta and then the herbs and cheese....excellent. My cheese did not clump, my veggies were crisp, the broth was excellent My husband devored it. Definitely a keeper....

This recipe was easy to make, could be prepared in advance, and was delicious. It is so simple, yet so delicious!!! It got rave reviews from all who ate it (and I did add some veggies to it - asparagus and zucchini).

This was an alright recipe, but was really easy and great if you are having vegetarian friends over for dinner. The cheese does clump, so I would recommend sprinking on top before serving.

I thought this dish was o.k., but nothing to write home about. I added everything exactly, and I did not even taste the garlic. There was way too much pasta for the amount of veggies, and I even added more veggies than called for. The parmesan DOES clump together, so I recommend added it just to the top of the pasta after serving. I don't know if I would make this again. There are many other better dishes.

Delicious and light. I omitted the fennel and added zucchini and asparagus. You could literally use whatever veggies you have on hand. I reduced the broth a little more than called for and it intensified the flavour. I used 1/2 cup of parmesan which was definately enough. This recipe is a keeper.

I added mushrooms, green beans, and zuchinni. It was tasty; much better than sauteing the veggies before mixing with the pasta like I used to do. If you like your veggies crisp-tender like us, then 30 minutes is too long to bake them. 20-25 minutes should do.

This salad is quite good. We had never had a fennel bulb before and that was a strange flavor to us. Hopefully next time the fennel bulb will be more enjoyable.

I made this for my youth group and even those who are the "meat and potatoes" sort loved it. I made one or two changes -- doubled all ingredients except the fennel and put in less cheese than was called for. I made it the night before, but the cheese made eating it cold an unattractive prospect. As I had made such a big batch I reheated it on the stove and used a bit of extra vegetable broth to make sure it didn't burn. This is definitely going to be a staple in my week, and I can't wait to try it with other roasted veggies... potatos, mushrooms... yum.

Excellent. Actually, I have no idea if this recipe is good or not. I changed it up. Used a bit more broth than called for, LESS CHEESE (about 1 c.), tomato, mushroom, red/yellow peppers, zucchini, 7 cloves garlic. I don't like cooked carrots and the #%!#@! store was out of fennel. Used a bit of basil and tarragon but nowhere near the 1/2 c. called for. The veggies were delicious. I loved the flavor of the mushrooms--definitely add them. Next time I will use fennel. And as others suggested, it wouldn't hurt to roast twice as many veggies as this recipe calls for. Make this food now!

I thought this was a very easy recipe to prepare and was excellent. I will definitely serve it to company. I didn't have fresh basil so I used dry and it still tasted amazing. I think the key ingredient is the fennel bulb.

An excellent way to have vegetarian pasta with lots of flavor. Next time I would roast more veges for the amount of pasta called for. Has lots of flavor and I did use partly dried basil because I didn't have enough fresh. I think the roasted garlic is the key.

This is a great, easy pasta dish. What's so good about it is you can add just about any vegetable you like with good results (although I left out the fennel once and missed it!). Also, the fresh basil is key--dried just doesn't yield nearly as good results. I will definitely make this again.

I really enjoyed this pasta recipe but my husband & kids didn't.I also left out the fennel but added zuchinni instead.I guess I would make it for myself again..It was very light,Not a dish I would make for guests though.

Excellent pasta dish I will definitely make again. I added zucchini and reduced the broth to about a 3rd.Only put in one cup PArmesan as suggested by the other reviewers...next time will use more

This recipe was fine, but after the rave reviews I'd read, I was expecting a lot more. Definitely eliminate all but a 1/2 cup to 1 cup of the cheese, as other people had expected. I could make it again, but only if I had nothing better on my mind.

This dish was one of the best pasta dishes I have had. It reminded me of a dish served at Mimis' cafe. I used 1/2 cup of parmesan I would use a little more next time. When I make this dish again I will add yellow squash and fresh spinach. I would give this dish an A+.

I used homemade chicken broth, and I too added mushrooms and asparagus. I also followed previous suggestions regarding using less cheese. This turned out REALLY good! I can't wait to eat the leftovers tonight. I will be roasting more veggies though. That was definately the best part.

This recipe was delicious and simple. I used only 1/2 c of parmesan cheese, which was just right. Thanks for the suggestions from other writers or it would have been much too much cheese. Next time I will try the rosemary suggestion...

this was fabulous!! I didn't have chicken broth so I put half a pack of dried onion soup in 16 ounces of water. I didn't have garlic cloves so I put heaping tablespoon of chopped in the roasting pan and scooped that into the broth after 30 minutes. I used anise instead of fennel and added some feathery tops to the veggies. I used red bell peppers. I only had a couple tablespoons of cheese. I deglazed the roasting dish with some broth and added to the pasta. I used angel hair pasta. I added cooked chicken breast at the end. Yummy. It was sweet and rich. I am going to use this to entertain my vegetarian friends(without the chicken breast of course). Make it. Obviously you can't go wrong.

Excellent dish!! I omitted the fennel and added fresh rosemary sprigs. I would agree about cutting down on the Parmesan as it has a tendency to clump.

Yummy! I used far less cheese (watching the fat don'tcha know) and it was still delicious. A word of caution: defninitely use low-sodium broth (I used vegetable bouillon cubes instead of canned broth and the dish was very salty, but still tasty). Even better the next day.

This is a delicious and healthy pasta dish that I plan to make again! I added zucchini and yellow squash to the recipe, and added a bit more chicken broth as well. Very flavorful, colorful dish!! Great recipe!

My sister and I whipped up this pasta dish with a glass of chilled white wine in hand. It was an outstanding, resounding success and we would both make it again without hesitation. We added asparagus to the other roasted veggies, more broth and by accident (we had run out), less parmesan. The "sauce" was deceptively rich despite its low fat content. Coupled with garlic bread, it makes a satisfying and memorable dining experience. We would encourage all pasta lovers to add it to their repertoire!

Great recipe! Try using other vegetables such as zucchini or mushrooms. Roma tomatoes sliced in half also work well. I also add about 6 ounces more broth and a few extra cloves of garlic. Let this reduce a bit for a more intense flavor. This is great the next day too.

This is a great 4 season dish! There is an endless variety of veggies to use all year round. It's a keeper!

My entire family loved this dish, even my ten year old son. Next time I will double the veggies as the pasta to vegetable ratio seemed a bit off. Wonderful side dish with grilled meat or fish.

yuummm!!! I roasted more vegetables, added a can of whole tomatoes w/juice, cut down on the parmesan (just a handful), added some roasted red bell peppers, and substituted linguine for the pasta. With the roasting and chopping, it was a little more labor intensive than I'd expected, but the results were worth it. Make a lot because it tastes even better the next day!

This was awesome. I added sundried tomatoes to it and it really added a lot of flavor. My kids don't care for a lot of vegetables, so I served up their portion after adding the garlic sauce and cheese.

Excellent recipe!! Absolutely great tasting and healthy at the same time. I'm always looking for low fat pasta recipes with a lot of flavor, and this is it. The preparation, however, took me longer than 45 minutes. Next time I will have my fiance help out,and there definitely will be a next time! We practically live on pasta, and we can say without hesitation that this is one of the best pasta dishes we have ever eaten!!!!

I only used a dash or two of olive oil on the vegs. prior to roasting on a non stick baking sheet. It was a fabulous, very low fat meal. Even my son liked it, and he's not big on vegetarian main dishes

This dish was very flavorful and light. I threw in whatever vegetables I had in the refrigerator - it worked well. I would definitely make this again.

This is a great dish for vegetarians, for the health conscious and for the rest of us. I made it for at least three different sets of diners, all of whom thought it was terrific.
