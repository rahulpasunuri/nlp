I loved this! My boyfriend hates fish, but he cleaned his plate. And it's great for those on a diet--only 2 tbsp oil, less if you want.

Really simple, healthy and delicious. Great way to get my husband to eat fish. Added sliced zucchini to the peppers and onions and used 2-3x more jalapenos.

This was a good recipe - definitely need to use a spiced up pepper (i used garlic pepper), and i used seasoning salt. Also cooked catfish for about an additional 2 min on each side.

This recipe wasn't bad, although I expected something a little more exciting based on other reviews. It may have been my fault, I used a fresh hot pepper instead of the ones suggested and it didn't have any bite at all.

This was quick, good and simple to make. My husband enjoyed the spicy veggies. I couldn't locate the pickled jalapeno so I chopped up nacho jalapeno (1 1/2 tlbs) and it worked as a good substitue. We were both sweating at the end of this meal :-)

This has become one of my all-time favorite dishes. It's easy to make and almost always turns out well. My partner loves it, and he's not a big fish fan. You can adjust the degree of hotness by adding or reducing the amount of jalepenos (and even add more jalapenos on the plate for someone who likes it really spicy). I've also used the Tom Douglas Seafood rub on the fish, which adds a little extra zing.

pretty yummy and easy way to make catfish. it is very much like jamaican escovitch fish but easier to make and with more easily obtainable ingredients. i spiced the catfish up a little more than they suggest (as i always do with any fish or meat) using adobo, garlic powder, red pepper and paprika and used flour + cornstarch for the coating.

this is so simple, yet so good!! As a transplant from Louisiana, we like our food spicy, and this was a wonderful blend of flavors. I sprinkled the catfish with Cajun seasoning, then followed the recipe, cutting back to 1/3 of each peppers, and 1/2 of a 1014 onion. Also used balsamic vinegar. I served over Zataran's Black Beans and Rice, with a Pinot Gris--BonAppetit!

This recipe was very different from the other fish meals I make. I enjoyed the flavors and the "kick" the meal had. It was easy to make and tasted great. It really spruced up an average evening's meal!

This was so simple to make and was absolutely delicious! Will definitely make it again. The only substitution I made was the vinegar -- I used balsamic instead of the white wine vinegar.

Definitely will make this again. Used two Fresh Jalapenos peppers and balsamic vinegar. Made a rice & black bean side dish worked out very well.

Easy and delicious even w/o the jalepenos. We'll definitely make it again and again.

This is an easy tastey recipe. I've made it several times. Fish is moist. Tonight it was with red onion, red and green peppers, and balsemic vinager with some Old Bay Seasoning. I will cut down on the amount of peppers(1/3 red & green) and onion(small) next time as it makes more than we need. I plan to try it with chicken.

I really enjoy this recipe because, it is quick and inspite of it being fish everyone enjoys it. I use white balsamic vinegar in the place of the white wine vinegar. I always double it and sometimes I even add an extra fillet. This one rates four forks with us.

This was too sour tasting to enjoy. Seems like it needed something, though I did like the hotness from the jalepenos.

I've made this many times. It's fast, easy, and tasty. Perfect for a quick delicious meal! I have used fresh jalepeno instead of the canned, and I have used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.

Made this recipe this weekend, and it was great! I followed the other reviewer's suggestion and added a little Creole seasoning. For starters, I made quickie quesadilla and served the catfish over rice. Once again, another great meal thanks to Epicurious!

Really tasty and easy to make. I like to add some Zatarain's Creole Seasoning for that extra spiciness.
