I wasn't looking for something *too* sweet, but I think this could be a little sweeter. I added some sugar to the water when I was simmering the cranberries, and next time I'll increase the sugar to 3/4 c., if not a full cup. All in all, it was quite good -- nice texture.

I really liked this bread, it wasn't too sweet, perfect for breakfast or break at work. I took it into the office, it was gone in about 30 minutes... Great with low-fat cream cheese!

I found this rather bland and then looked for a better cranberry bread recipe and found one right on this web site ... Cranberry Nut Bread, Gourmet October 1991. Now THAT one is a winner!

The bread was moist, tasty (I added some crystalized ginger the second time I made it). It is not too sweet. Great with a cup of tea or coffee. Have already made it twice and intend to again.

A very nice cranberry orange flavor - easy and moist.

I love cranberry bread for the contrast of the tart berries and the sweet bread. This bread isn't sweet at all. Its just blah. I even tried adding 3/4 cup of sugar and it still didn't taste right. I give up.
