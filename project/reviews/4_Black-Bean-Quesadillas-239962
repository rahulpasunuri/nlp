Perfect for a weeknight meal. It was bland, so I added salt, red pepper flakes, pepper, minced jalapeno, which helped the flavor. So easy that the teens made their own once I made the filling. Make sure the pan is hot and oiled, and brushing or spraying oil on the up side while the down side cooks helped get a nice brown, crunchy sear.

These were tasty and simple to prepare. I think they would be better with more cheese.

Yes please! These were brilliantly easy to make and SO delicious! Be sure and not underfry the quesadilla as the crispness makes a great texture to an overall soft textured meal. The salsa cannot be skipped!

Wow! For such a simple recipe this was surprisingly tasty! Cut down on the cheese a little and added a dash of lime to the salsa - really quick and really good meal!

Extremely easy and tasty. I didn't have black beans in my pantry so I used Zatarian's Black Bean and Rice Mix and used a pannini press manually so things didn't get squished. Worked great and fast. We had ready made salsa.

Quick, easy, and tasty! I added rice and made more of a burrito, but was still good and yet filling!

This recipe was very good, cheap, and easy to make. I mixed the beans, cilantro and onion and let them sit together in the fridge to give it a little more flavor. Used a George Forman, so I did not have to flip and risk the beans coming out! Great with salsa and some hot sauce!

Outstanding and easy peasy. Made it with my cooking class (14 year olds) and there was not one failed recipe. The kids also really liked them, as did I!

Easy and delicious. I added rice into the bean mixture to fill out the quesadillas into a hearty meal.

Really enjoyed this recipe- easy to make and delicious. I changed the flavor profile so much (adding cipotle, adding green pepper, grating my own mix of extra sharp cheddar and monterey jack, sauteeing all the onion and pepper in the mix and leaving out the salsa, using whole wheat tortillas) so I took off one fork for not convincing me in the description of the recipe- but it was a fantastic starting point to create something we all loved.

One word - awesome! Simple and super fast. It took me a whopping 12 minutes to make from refrigerator to table.

What a nice surprise! We love black beans at my house. The nutritional value combined with a night off from meat is always welcomed for the ease of preparation as well as the value. I'm always looking for new ways to prepare one of our favorite ingredients. I came across this recipe when surfing for black beans and it was way too easy to be this delicious. Clipped some fresh cilantro from the garden, threw it all in a bowl and voila, we had a very hearty quesadilla that was a perfect Friday night dinner. We doubled the recipe and ate it again for lunch on Saturday. I felt the vegetable oil was unnecessary as I used a nonstick skillet. I also beefed up the onion which was delicious.

Super easy and tasty- kids loved it! I used a prepared salsa because I was in a rush. Served with gucamole and sour cream.

These were unbelievable! The black beans make it a great stand alone. I found this variation on it the other day that I also love: http://miapogeo.com/main/content/view/1039/4 568/

These are very easy and tasty, and one can easily add other ingredients according to taste, however, the simple recipe is fine as it is. I am making it again tonight as it's a Friday during Lent, but these quesadillas are also a healthy, penny-stretching meal any day of the week. I borrowed the idea of smashing the beans (cooked with onions), from the reviewer from Cherry Hill, as I am not crazy about the texture of beans and I wanted to avoid beans from falling out of the tortillas as others mentioned. That did the trick.

This is quite tasty, and super easy! Making the salsa is effortless. I have always just made quesadillas by throwing ingredients on a tortilla in a pan. I used chipotle cheddar and I think it made the quesadillas especially delicious!

Sounds like a great recipe, but 1 1/4 c of cilantro is a lot. How do you prep it? Do you eat the stems?? THey show prep time 10min?????

I made these for my wife and we both absolutely loved it! The quesadillas were so delicious and very easy to make. The salsa on top was very refreshing and went great with the quesadillas. Will definetely make again.

These were so good, and everyone loved them. I have made them several times, sometimes without the tomato salsa. My husband loved the salsa, the kids could take it or leave it.

Wow ... even my 7- year-old devoured these! I cut back a bit on beans as suggested, but using my Foreman grill probably made that step unnecessary (I didn't have to manually flip the buggers). This will become a staple in our house.

Simple and tasty. I'd cut back on the beans a bit though, they tend to make things a bit messy.

This recipe tasted delicious and it could not have been easier to make.

I used about 2/3rd of the cheese required in this recipe (as well as just a touch of cilantro) and added garlic and tomato. It is SO easy & fast. Delicous!

I cooked the onions and black beans together in olive oil, smashing half and adding cumin, cayenne, salt and pepper, before spreading it on the tortillas. The kids loved them!

Super easy, very tasty. I used green onions instead. Have already made it twice for my boyfriend.
