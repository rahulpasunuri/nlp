To all of the people who are so convinced that this is not "real" stroganoff, in Russia it is actually served as a tomato sauce with a dollop of sour cream. Although I was raised with the American traditional ground beef/cream sauce, OURs is the delicious variant :)

I came across this while browsing to see how I could turn some ingredients into dinner. I used some smoked paprika and used chipotle powder instead of cayenne...the result was a nice smoky flavor. Not stroganoff but still a tasty dinner over brown rice.

How is this stroganoff??? By definition, stroganoff has sour cream. This is like swiss steak without the deep flavors. It mostly tastes like canned tomato. My Estonian sister in law laughed.

This was interesting---I stumbled upon it because I didn't know what to do with some beef kabobs, onions, shitake mushrooms and diced (canned) tomatos I had in the kitchen...so I used this recipe to structure the combination, and then added some yogurt, a bit of cream, tomato paste and salt and pepper to taste, and served it over noodles with grated pecorino---tasted wonderful although I'm not sure it was a true Beef Stroganoff.

We are also still looking for the ideal beef stroganoff recipe. This was very expensive to make for being just okay. Used 2 1/2# tenderloin and a high quality sour cream. Even my husband wasn't thrilled by it.

I know that this recipe lacks some things, but it is still pretty good, if you know how to work it. Most of us do.

Very good week night dinner - the suggestions of another 'pinch' of cayenne & the sour cream - definitely took this to the next flavor level! Will try over Polenta next time.

I've been searching for the perfect stroganoff recipe for some time now. This wasn't it.

We thought this was very good. I sliced the top sirloin thinly, therefore it wasn't tough at all. I felt the dish still needed something when it was done, so I added about 1/2 cup (or so) of sour cream which finished it off nicely. It needed to be seasoned with salt and pepper at the end and, next time, I will increase both the thyme and cayenne to give it more flavor. I will make it again.

I used cooked roast beef instead of the Sirloin. In addition, I like the idea of Sour Cream with the Tomatoes. I used ½ Cup. Came out fabulous.

YUM! This was truly tasty. I added more thyme and cayenne pepper to "kick it up a notch". Also, the meat should be sliced very thin, otherwise it can be a little tough.

This recipe is a wondeful variation on the standard beef stroganoff... the cayanne pepper gives it a tasty kick, and the dish as a whole tastes pretty light (relavtive to the original). I served with a bit of sour cream, but it certainly isn't necessary.

Loved this recipe! I used sirloin tips, increased the mushrooms and doubled the cayenne pepper to give it a little more kick.

I don't know if I cooked the meat too long, but it seemed really tough. I'd rather make a different recipe or use more tender meat next time. It wasn't the best.

We made this dish last night. It was very simple to prepare and tasted delicious.

I served this dish and it went over well. Half of the group liked it without the sour cream and the other half added some sour cream for taste. I did not have any leftovers and I served this over egg noodles. It was great!

I was looking for something simple for my "meat and potatoes" dad. I didn't expect to enjoy this myself, it looked too easy! I did add a touch more broth, and some of the juice from the tomatoes. Very simple, am making it again next week!
