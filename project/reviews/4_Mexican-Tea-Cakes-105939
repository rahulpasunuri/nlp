These were quite tasty! Not the best "cookie" ever but very good. Very easy recipe to make but took a fair amount of time to roll all the balls. Also, I found that letting them sit on the baking sheet for about 30-45 seconds after taking them out of the oven made them much less likely to break apart when being tossed in the powdered sugar. As other reviewers have mentioned, they look a little unattractive after the first powdered sugar coating, but look more evenly coated after the second time. After being completely cooled and coated, the cookies become quite a bit more sturdy, as well.

Try filling them with milk chocolate kisses or choc chips!! they are simply delicious.

I've been using this recipe for years and absolutely love these cookies. They are quite similar to the cookies my dad used to make every Christmas all through my childhood. Do taste better the next day.

I've made these cookies for years and they're great but my process is slightly different. If you don't have unsalted butter on hand (I never do), just use regular salted butter and omit the salt from the ingredients. I've never refrigerated the dough before rolling the cookies. After I mix the ingredients -- first with a spoon, then I always use my very well-washed hands to do the micro mixing! -- I start rolling the balls and they keep their shape because the warmth of my hands helps blend the ingredients and minimize the crumbliness. My biggest and I hope most helpful hint is this. After removing the cookies from the oven (and I do not butter the pan before placing the cookies on it, I leave it ungreased), I lay them in a large pan filled with enough powdered sugar to cover them, and let them cool in the sugar. Then when they are cool all I have to do is roll them a little bit to make sure they have the coating of powdered sugar over the sugar that has melted on them. Sometimes rolling them again isn't even necessary. It is much faster doing it this way than the separate rolling in sugar, removing and cooling on racks, and rolling in sugar again process, and you can't tell the difference.

These are the best cookies ever. My husband asks for them every holiday season.

These were a big hit! I think they would be so much fun to make with kids, as they were fun for me to make...easy and scrumptious! Next time I will double the vanilla, as I usually do, but forgot. I put them in tins and covered each layer with a circle of waxed paper. I was sure to follow the level teaspoon. You get the feeling for the amount very quickly. I got tons of "balls". Don't bother measuring the confectioner's sugar for rolling - just add some as you need it and keep it sifted with you (messy) fingers! A keeper.

These are delicious and a standard at Christmas time. I rolled 'em small and ended up with 38 cookies. So, if you really need 6-dozen (72) plan on making two batches. If you have Trader Joes in your area - in the nuts aisle they have something called "Ground Almond Meal" which is very finely ground almonds so you can save the step of the feed processor. The rolling in confectioners sugar goes very fast. The trick is to roll the first time while still hot - the second time when completely cooled. Delish!

Excellent! I followed the recipe exactly, except I only used 1-1/2 cups of sugar for rolling. Anything more than that is a waste, you won't need it. Rolling the balls while hot will make for an ugly exterior but don't worry. The second coat when cool makes it all look nice!

A for taste, appearance and ease. F for accuracy on the yield count. I made these for a Latin American Studies breakfast for 25 and was banking on getting 6 dozen cookies out of this recipe. I only got 3 dozen, and was therefore forced to remake the recipe on short notice, which meant no chill time in the fridge. If you're questioning whether it's worth it to chill them for the 6 hours, the answer is yes. The unchilled batter was harder to roll, and lost the snowball shape in the baking process. Also, didn't hold together as well when powdering. They taste basically the same, however.

I made these last year for holiday gifts. They are delicious and very seasonal (they look like snowballs!). I also had problems with the dough being a bit crumbly, even though I used butter. A wonderful cookie, and a great holiday treat!

I made these cookies for a tea party, and I really enjoyed them! They had a great flavor-- and quite pleasant looking too. I found that I had a hard time with the dough, having never made them before. I did not expect such a crumbly dough-- mine was especially crumbly so it was very difficult to make the first few balls. This could be because I used a non-dairy butter alternative for the lactose intolerants at the party. But they turned out fine nonetheless-- and surprisingly, I thought they tasted quite good even with a margarine rather than butter.

I have used a different Mexican tea cake recipe for years. I had just moved and didn't know where my old recipe was. This was was far superior. They just melt in you mouth. This recipe doesn't, however, make 6 dz. I will use it again.

Sam as Russian Tea Cakes. This is the betty crocker recipe...google it. I have made it many times, very good, easy, nice on a platter as the texture and shape adds alot of visual appeal as well as taste.

An elegant little unassuming cookie. Two coats of sugar are necessary for sweetness. I made these for my palate challenged family and they loved them. These are the people who think Oreos are wildly exotic.

fantastic!!!! i have made this recipe for years and it is perfect. my eight year old goes crazy over these little snowballs and can't wait to make them every christmas. i made them for her class last year and everyone was raving about them. i suggest doubling the recipe because people will eat four or so at a time and they go fast.

Excellent flavor and texture. I had no problem with the recipe exactly as written. I also added the zest of a lime to most of the cookies (rolled in the zest as I rolled up each ball) and found them just as good, but with a little lime kick. Similar to 'snowball' cookies made around xmas.

These cookies are FANTASTIC. I was in the mood to try baking something new, and these were very easy and fun. I brought them into work (after my boyfriend and I scarfed down 6 of them in about 2 minutes), and one of my co-workers, who's suspicious of anything non-chocolatey, took one, gingerly took a small bite, and then immediately snatched another one while saying rapturously, "These are so good I feel like I shouldn't eat them! I should just save them!" They're REALLY good. The one thing I had trouble with was rolling them in the confectioner's sugar - the sugar really wanted to coat the cookies heavily, and i had to tap them a lot and dig at the sugar with the tines of a fork to get them to be more elegantly dusted.

UH-MAZ-ING! Oh my gosh. I've made it with margarine (had to make it non-dairy) and with Plugra butter. Obviously, it was better with butter, but even the marg. version was delicious. Super rich, super yummy!

Very, very easy and soooo good. I made them for a Cinco de Mayo luncheon and in keeping with the holiday, added the zest from one lime to the dough, yum!

Wonderful, easy to make. My 11 year old daughter made several batches for her class because she liked them so much. I had never seen her enjoy any cookie besides chocolate chip before.

I actually made these with ground almonds instead of pecans and true almond extract instead of vanilla. Amazing flavor. This was a childhood favorite recipe in it's original form, but the almond flavors really made it a standout.

My mom and I have made these cookies for years, substituting walnuts for pecans - everyone loves them, though I never get 6 dozen out of the recipe. I agree with the previous reviewer who recommends following the recipe and rolling the cookies in sugar twice - once while still warm. the sugar does melt a little the first time, which helps the second coat adhere, so they're not as messy.

Excellent. I put them in the powdered sugar immediately, per the instructions...and re rolled them after cool..as per the instructions, with perfect results.

These are delicious, and SOOOO easy! I forgot to plan ahead to allow the dough to sit in the refrigerator for 6 hours. I baked the cookies immediately after making the dough and they still came out delicious.

Classic cookies that everyone loves. I agree with another reviewer, let the cookies cool some or the confectioners sugar will melt. These store well for several weeks.

All my friends love this recipe, and even my husband who hates powder sugar on his food liked this one. One word of advice, don't roll the cookies in powder sugar while it's still hot, this melts the sugar and make a mess. Roll the cookies when it's cooled, it works just as well. Next time I'm going to experiment trying different ground nuts for flavoring.

Ooof, shamefully delicious. I kept the dough well chilled, which stopped the cookies from spreading. I made them as a gift and had to hide them from the rest of my family who insisted on snarfing them. I got about 45 cookies out of it. One word of warning....wait a minute before rolling the hot cookies in powdered sugar, on the first batch I didn't wait and they got powdered sugar clumps all over them. The next batch was much better...I will most certainly be making these again.

you can make logs of the dough and freeze them. when you want fresh cookies, slice and bake as usual. this is how we made them in my bakery in America.

I'm so glad I found this recipe! I had cut it out of the magazine and used it for the first time last year in my gift basket to my kids' teachers. Can't find the hard copy! I make a large assortment of things and this is the recipe that was requested by all, including my mother. They are melt in your mouth delicious!

I substituted vanilla-nut flavoring instead of plain vanilla and walnuts for pecans. The vanilla-nut falvoring gives them a little nuttier flavor. They're the first to disappear off the cookie tray.

I had a similar recipe from Girls Scouts when I was about 10 - my mother kept it and made them year after year. I made tea cakes for the first time by myself this past holiday season and I was amazed at how simple and delicious they were. My huband inhaled the poor things - they never had a chance!

I made these for Christmas as an easy substitute for Kourambedes ( greek shortcakes ) and they were wildly successful. I now make them all the time. I add a drop of almond essence and a little more vanilla. You can substitute walnuts for the pecans, they are a bit cheaper. The recipe doubles or even triples very well. A standby in my house.

I love these cookies! I decided to add 1/4 tsp. each of cloves, cinnamon and freshly grated nutmeg. The results were great! I received rave reviews. Next time I would make them slightly larger, maybe one inch instead of 3/4. Also, I chilled the dough overnight.

I love these christmas cookies, but was disappointed when I doubled the recipe and only made about 70 cookies. Also, my first couple of batches melted instead of staying in the ball shape. I think this is because I didn't wait long enough for the dough to soften, if this helps anyone else. I agree with the other cooks about the powdered sugar as well. All in all, great cookie and they dress up a cookie plate well.

These were fabulous. I made mine about an inch and only got 30 cookies out of the batch. I agree with another reader that 1 1/2 Cups of powdered sugar would be plenty for rolling the cookies in.

These are delicious in taste and texture--and easy to make. I would recommend starting with just 1.5 cups of powdered sugar for rolling and add more as you need it because I ended up with quite a bit of extra. Also, don't bother sifting the powdered sugar if you don't feel like it. As soon as you put that first batch of hot cookies in the sugar, the steam and melted butter make tons of little lumps.

Absolutly perfect cookie, dont expect the cookie to be sweet until its rolled in the powdered sugar. After its rolled the second time its beautiful and delicious, I'd serve this to the queen is she came for tea.
