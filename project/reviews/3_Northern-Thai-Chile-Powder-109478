Yes, I've been on a mad search for szechuan peppercorns, too. There is a substitute of sorts, called "Birds of Paradise", available in Philadelphia at the Corner Spice Store in the Italian Market (S. 9th St.) -- they have a website. The reason is that there is a virus harmful to citrus in the shell of the peppercorn (Sczechuan peppercorns are not true peppercorns, apparently, but fruit, with a shell ...). When the shell is removed and the core ground, the material can be imported (that's why you can find ground Sz pepper for sale). Your only other alternatives are to order from outside the US and hope no one impounds your order and comes after you ...

Yeah the USDA has diallowed the Sichuan peppercorns from the US because of some disease. But as "smart" as the USDA is they seem not to care that Chinese Five Spice has Sichuan peppercorns in it. I know all this because the USDA came to my Culinary school to seize our peppercorns.

Where the heck do you get Sichuan peppercorns? I've been looking for them for some time and have not found them. Is it true that they are not imported anymore because of some sort of plant disease?
