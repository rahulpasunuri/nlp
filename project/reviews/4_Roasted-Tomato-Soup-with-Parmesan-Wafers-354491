For an amazing flavorful concoction cut the broth dramatically -- even in half! We've made this many times before, and loved it. But tonight I overlooked the broth and was amazed at the improved tomato flavor I had after the purée process. After checking back with the recipe I realized my mistake, and poured some in. Best tomato soup ever!

This is an excellent recipe. I made it all last summer using over ripened tomatoes from our local farmer's market. I omitted the heavy cream and used either water or chicken stock. Delicious.

Very good, and especially with the wafers. We're vegetarian so substituted low sodium veg. for chicken broth, but otherwise followed recipe. I would definitely double the garlic next time (added more at end) and could probably skip the sugar. Will try the balsamic next....

I make this soup every year for canning. It is so amazing to have warm summer tomatoes in February. Some years I make it exactly as is, some years I mix it up a bit, regardless, it's always amazing. I usually up the garlic a bit, there is no such thing as too much garlic! I know some folks frown upon canning dairy items, but I've never had a problem. Just increase the time in the bath, I think I do like 20-30 minutes. The smell of the roasting garlic and tomatoes wafts through the house and is a great bonus. If I could bottle that smell, I would make a fortune! P.S.- skip the wafers.

Ran out of oregano, so used 1/2 cup fresh basil, along with a couple bay leaves. Added some chicken stock and used fat free half & half to lighten the calories. Halved the sugar...how much you use will depend on your tomatoes and your taste preference. Would roast more garlic next time and like the idea of balsamic. Did not strain - liked it with a bit of texture. Did not make the Parm wafers, but plan to do that next time.

Great recipe! And easy to boot. Halved it though as i didn't want yo cook for an army. Added a little balsamic vinegar and sugar to the tomatoes as well before roasting. Will definitely make again.

Last year, my husband harvested all the green tomatoes from our garden, right before a hard frost. He placed them in our south facing windowsills, and about a week later they were red. I settled upon this recipe to use them up for two reasons: one, roasting the tomatoes, to concentrate the flavor, seemed like a good idea since they hadn't ripened on the vine. And two, I had an open cream in the fridge that I wanted to use up. I made a triple batch, using a mix of all the types of tomatoes from my garden, but mostly plum/sauce-type. I used a whole head of garlic, broken up into cloves, per half-sheet pan crammed full of tomatoes, and I roasted for two hours instead of one. I tasted the soup before adding the cream, and thought it was great. In the end, I decided I preferred it without the cream (and I'm no health nut), and that's how I plan to make it this time. If I feel that it's a little too acidic, I think I'll try adding a little butter, a la Marcella Hazan and her famous sauce. I froze what I didn't eat within a day or two, but that triple batch was gone so fast, and was longingly dreamed of so much throughout the rest of the winter, that I planted twice as many tomatoes(45 plants) this season just so that I could make more of this soup!

I used some leftover heirloom tomatoes plus some delicious early girl tomoatoes. But I'm giving this three forks because this recipe does not need sugar. Let the tomatoes speak for themselves as the sugar really made this too, too sweet.

I veganized this recipe and did a full review on my blog: Peaceful Table. The Vitamix eliminates any need for straining the soup!

My go to tomato soup recipe! Just bought a bunch of different little tomatoes at Farmers Market to supplement my garden ones. The key really is to have home-grown or farmers market tomatoes. I often use the mini grape or cherry tomatoes, as they have that concentrated sugar-y flavor. If my tomatoes are so so, I bump up the sugar, it helps a little. Plus, I usually double up the recipe and can it. Although, it's always eaten before a month even goes by:)

This is a great, simple recipe that really feels restaurant quality. The key here is fresh tomatoes - hardly any seasoning is needed if you get this part right. And you can customize the recipe to your liking - I didn't strain or add cream because I wanted a more rustic feel but you can definitely class it up by straining ands serving with creme fraiche.

This soup is so good my daughter loved it especially. It was very good I made the wafers once and to our disappointment they were not anything special. This is a easy, fun, and great meal. It is great for either lunch or dinner. Enjoy

Very good, but goes to great if you have good in season tomatoes. Salt is really important here, as it will bring out the flavor, so if you think its too tame, keep adding salt until the flavor comes through (or it starts getting on the salty side)... I used heavy cream even though I know a lot of health nuts here don't like it, but a half cup is a small amount in the overall pot. I will try something else next time, per other's suggestions, just to see.

Really good soup with a good depth of flavor; I made it as-listed but replaced the heavy cream with half and half. It was delicious. Next time I might add a little baking soda to help neutralize the acidity of the tomatoes (just a tad). Served with grilled cheese sandwiches (cheddar on italian loaf) and it was a nice accompaniment. Hope to try the wafers sometime soon, as they sound delicious and simple.

This soup is exceptional, but in order to make it scrumptious you need fresh, in season, tomatoes. I make this for my family with paninis and it is a great combination. Whenever I make this meal I know it's going to be a hit at the dinner table.

would give 3.5 forks if i could. This soup is delicious. I've been roasting tomatoes all summer. They freeze well so you could easily whip up this recipe in the cold winter months when fresh tomatoes are non-existant. The key to getting that intense tomato flavor is roasting for longer than the recipe calls for. I usually roast for several hours or until the tomatoes are slightly burnt and the majority of the liquid has cooked off. Did not try the parmesan wafers but will next time.

This was an ok recipe but it was missing something - even with an armful of beautiful farm fresh tomatoes. I'll keep searching for that creamy chunky tomato soup with lots of flavor.

Very nice soup. Used fresh Farmer's market tomatoes. Reduced the butter & replaced most of it w/ olive oil. Reduced the sugar a tiny bit. Used 1/2 & 1/2, and reduced that amount. Just wanted to cut some calories & increase health benefits, some. Made fresh pesto & added a dollop to the top with a few pine nuts. Served with warm whole grain bread & various (fabulous) cheeses.

This is great soup! I made it with "no-chicken" broth, fresh oregano, and made the wafers with Romano. Delish and can't wait to make it again!

My husband said this was the best tomato soup he ever had. I used a variety of tomatoes from my CSA box and served it with grilled cheese sandwiches. Will definitely make again and again and again...

Perfect tomato soup that you can't mess up. I would suggest using a lighter cream or at least do not use as much as the recipe says. The Parmesan wafers a must.

Perfectly delicious! I made it just as written, used hot house tomatoes in mid January, and still delicious. I think roasting the tomatoes concentrates their flavor, making this a wonderful recipe for the dead of winter when summer's tomato abundance is a memory. Served with toasted cheese, like going back in time. Comfort food at it's best!

This is a fabulous recipe. I have made it several times. To make it a little more healthy I have skipped the heave cream and it was a hit! I highly recommend this for a cool fall night or for a warm summer evening. very versatile!

Skipped the cream, did everything else by the books and YUM. Made this with grilled swiss cheese sammiches. Used my own veggie stock. My men-folk were QUITE satisfied with the meal!

I used mostly round, juicy tomatoes from my garden. As promised, the soup was light and delicate, perfect for August. I can't wait to try it with romas in the fall/winter.

WOW! This was the most amazing tomato soup ever! i'll admit, aside from our slow food look on food, me and my husband have always had a taste for Campbell's tomato soup. This soup has that same sweet tomato flavor that most other tomato soups lack. Of course it totally helped using tomatoes, and onions from our garden. I agree it's hard to screw up, i was worried, because I had no way to measure 4lbs of tomatoes, but even with my guessing, the end result left me speechless:) Q: I'D LOVE TO CAN THIS FOR LATER USE, ANYONE HAVE ANY TIPS ON HOW TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN? OR A BOOK ON CANNING?

This is a difficult recipe to screw up. No matter what I do to it, it still tastes great. Try substituting creme fraiche for whipping cream.

Easy, easy, with wonderful flavor. The parmesan wafers are a nice salty accompaniment to the sweet tomato soup.

I made the soup with vine ripened tomatoes and finished each bowl with a heaping tablespoon of plain yogurt instead of cream. My husband, a hard marker, declared the soup to be "restaurant quality". It was simple and delicious. This will become my tomato soup of choice.

This is really easy to make and definitely is light enough for warm weather. I do wish it had some more tomato flavor (used freshly picked organic beefsteaks)however it is still a nice soup.
