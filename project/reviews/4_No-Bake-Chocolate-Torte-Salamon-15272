I found this recipe looking for cakes w/o eggs (due to an egg allergy). Vanilla wafers are made w/eggs, but it turns out there's a "low fat" version of vanilla wafers that don't have egg. So I used those. My springform pan was 9 inches, not 10, so I only needed one box of cookies, not 1.5 that the recipe calls for. The cake was fantastic, and the recipe is almost fool-proof. Next time I would add sliced strawberries, as a previous reviewer suggests. I would also dip the cookies a little more to make sure the cake is moist enough. Great to make ahead of time.

This has been successful for the past few years at an annual party. This year I tried a variation that worked well, though not as I expected - we ended up serving it in martini glasses topped with toasted coconut because it did not set up as firmly as I thought it would. Nevertheless, people loved it. I made the lemon curd mousse from this site. I used thin lemon shortbread cookies (that I found at Long's Drugstore!) and I dipped them in Grand Marnier. I layered the torte just as the chocolate one is done and covered it with whipped cream (though not quite as much as the chocolate calls for, but only because we had a mishap with the icing bag). I refrigerated it for a day, but as I said before, it was better for spooning than slicing. Delicious nonetheless.

Easy to make but needs more mousse to make it even easier. Mousse portion of torte seems kind of skimpy. 1 and a half times the mousse would be about right.

This is a simple and absolutely decadent dessert(and I NEVER bake). I bought 18% cream (on recommendation) and could not whip it into peaks. Whipping cream is the answer (35%). I prepared mine in a large shallow Corningware dish (lightly sprayed)with no difficulty cutting etc. I added sliced strawberries all over the top with some grated chocolate. Everyone agreed the strawberries really were a wonderful complement. I also had to make up a bit more milk and liquer mixture for the third layer of cookies. I may make it again with more mousse though. I served mine after 8 hours of chilling. Fantastically chocolate!

After just one bite, soemone was requesting the recipe! One change I'll incorporate the next time is to line the bottom of the springform pan with parchment paper... it was a little messy trying to remove it (but noone was the wiser since it was covered in whipped cream.) Also-- I added a little confectioner's sugar to the whipped cream.

Have been making this dessert since I came across recipe 3 years ago. It never fails to impress people and best of all it can be made ahead and frozen. Actually came onto website looking for this recipe that I had lost in moving. So glad to find it again!!!!

Easy to make. Looks impressive when cut into slices. Handling the milky cookies is a little messy but worth it.

This is a wonderful and easy to prepare recipe. I have had several requests for the recipe. I do suggest use the best chocolate you can find.

This was a delicious dessert. I made mine in a glass baking dish and it was firm enough to slice neatly. I think I will add mint flakes to the chocolate mixture when I make it the next time. I think graham crackers would work just as well as the vanilla wafers. Follow the recipe and just dip one at a time. I cheated and put Cool-Whip on top instead of real whipped cream. A nice dessert when you feel like being a little fancy.
