Very easy to make and delicious! This went well with the Thanksgiving feast.

This was a great dish with a beautiful fall presentation. I will definately make it again (so easy and delicious!) but might add a bit more spice to it.

This dish was excellent. I made it the day before and just reheated it and it turned out great.

It wasn't as flavorful as I had expected. In fact, it was quite bland.

This is a great dish. I made it for a special dinner I was serving and everyone loved it. It's great because you can make it the day before and then cook it on the day of your party.
