Yum! Very tasty and easy. I took the advise of others and marinated the sausage in the beer (Blue Moon) for an hour in a sealable bag. I used my George Forman grill - 6 minutes total. Loved the carmalized onions! I added some red pepper flakes to the onion...what a nice zing to the sweetness. Wish I cut up more onion. I will make this again with a dark beer.

This was a great new way to do bratwurst. One word of caution...the idea for carmelizing the onions is a great one, but I made the mistake of reducing the beer and it turned very bitter (had never done this with beer before, duh). So next time I will remove the onions, toss the beer, and carmelize them on their own in a pan. Subtle beer flavor but not at all overwhelming. A great combo.

Being a girl from Sheboygan Wisconson (the home of Johnsonville Brats) and currently living in Milwaukee (the home of Miller Brewing), this is a staple in our household. Many a party and tailgate is started with Johnsonville's boiling in beer, kraut, onions and butter. Who knew it was epicurious quality?

Kind of a waste of a good beer. I followed the recipe exactly - did not marinate it or caramelize the onions. I use hot Italian sausages. It tasted exactly as if they had been just grilled.

Definitely marinate and poach the sausage (I used venison) in good beer--the darker, the better. Save the onions (and garlic and pepper if you're using them; I used red pepper flakes) and carmelize them. I served my brats (and the onions, etc)over pasta and made a mustard cream sauce. Would do the same thing to serve on rolls.

I was reading this recipe and I thought, really tasty, but then I came to this line:'Poaching is optional and not every grill jockey does it'. Eeehh???... If you do not poach them, what about the flavour of the beer and onions? Then they're just grilled sausages. Come on.

I absolutely LOVED this recipe! We marinated the brats in Sam Adams for an hour, carmalized the onions (the best part) and used good, spicy mustard.

I made this for a 4th of July BBQ. Poached the brats the night before in Newcastle, bagged the onions and brats separately for easy grilling the next day. We made approx 15# of brats, and everyone raved. Also made red cabbage which was a good addition. I would definitely carmelize or sautee the onions next time (post-poach), at least to give them some color. All in all very good!

Almost forgot-used guyere cheese and stoned ground mustard. Yummy!

Made this for hubby's "Beer CLub"(fancy name for guys who love to taste beers from around the world) -these guys are serious about great beer/food combos and these sausages were fabulous. Did marinate in the beer and served the onions that were poached with them. Did some open-faced on slabs of pumpernickel bread with cheese and sauerkraut and run under boiler-rest had brat buns. One guy bought real German tater salad. Memorable meal all around. Beer guys recommend using the Saranac(or any)Boch. Yum.

Excellent tip to caramelize the onions, thanks!

While grilling the sausages, I poured off the beer and, adding some oil and butter and some sugar, I caramelized the onions and served them with the sausages. Served it with sauerkraut with caraway.

Don't let the name fool you. I inherited this from a young nephew many years ago. I love making sausages on the grill and while I haven't tried this I know it will be fantastic. Poaching is a must! Re:Alcohol. A chef once told me, if you won't drink it, don't cook with it. Sorry Bud lovers. Today I found this and it will be part of my Super Bowl Party menu for 2006. I will have several types of sausages, mustard and various toppings. Ketchup, you gotta be kidding! Hot dog buns, NO,NO,NO! Come on, you can do better than that. ENJOY.

This is a great outdoor meal. I use Sam Adams beer and marinate the meat in beer for an hour or two before hand, then poach in the beer and onion mixture....cover sausages with olive oil, grill until crispy. Serve with saurkraut and grilled onions.

allright, here is the way this works the best. i marinated my sausages in about 20 oz olde english 800 (the maltier the better) with about 1 dozen garlic cloves (minced)and i habenero pepper (diced) for an hour. then i poached the brats in the liquid, then i grilled the brats over direct heat until they were suffciently browned on all sides. they tasted like heaven, if heaven is spicy, garlickly and malty all at sweet once.

Only had 8 oz. of beer on hand, but even with the weak poaching liquid, our brats turned out nicely. Next time we'll try the tip to marinate in beer before poaching.

I invited the girls for a cook-out, and decided to make this recipe..It turned out to be a collossal failure, the first time. I used "pre-cooked" brats instead of the un-cooked. When I removed the lid after the precribed time, the brat were split and in pieces. I persevered, however, and bought more brats and did it exactly as the recipe instructs. They were excellent...All was well, all was happy.

We made this with bratwurst on our range grill, it was really good. Though, I think it would be better on the outdoor grill. We didn't add water just poached in beer.

I've been doing something similar for years. A Wisconsin bar trick--poach the sausages ahead of time, cool in the liquid, grill as needed.

This recipe is fantastic and Oh-So-Easy! I usually serve it with Sourkraut (the refrigerated in the bag kind). I have made one adjustment (after making them many times over) and found that it really makes a difference in the flavor. I pour the beer/water mixture into a heavy zip-lock bag and put my sausages (with the pin pricks) inside to marinate for at least an hour or more in the refrigerator - just squeeze out any air before sealing. Then use the beer mixture from the bag when simmering, prior to grilling. You may need to double the liquid (I usually do).

Delicious and easy! I used more onions than the recipe called for, about 4 or 5 and sauteed them. I also used a dark beer and served the sauce along side garlic mashed potatoes. I will definitely make them again.

My husband and I decided that 2003 was going to be the year we invite both of our families over once a month. Thank goodness for Epicurious and your review or I'd be dead meat! This recipe was a hit! I used Italian sausage and served it along side a vegetarian lasagne roll-up, refreshing parm. and pear salad, and garlic bread...trying to meet all the vegan, veggie, fish, and meat eaters diets. Needless to say, Heineken, as usual complimented everyones' tastebuds and the beer that I chose to use for this recipe. Thank you for all of your help.

I thought this recipe was a great and easy way to cook up any sausage you like. One advantage that we added to this was when the sausage were done we rolled them up into tortillas and added honey mustard to them. Excellent combination!

I didn't think that poaching the sausage would do much of anything to the tast of the sausage. I was wrong. This is probably the best italian sausage I've had. It's a simply but very tasty recipe.

I've been cooking sausages using this method for years. A maltier beer will result in a much better flavor. When I cook Italian sausages this way, I also prepare a topping of chopped green and red bell peppers, minced garlic and chopped onion. I saute the veggies in a little olive oil and season them with salt, pepper and Italian seasoning, then serve the sausages with this mixture on crusty rolls.

Fantastic! Never thought to poach before. I used meyers Hot Elgin Sausage, Shiner beer and Noon-Day onions. Tried the yellow bell pepper as well, and home-made jalapeno relish. Perfect for a BBQ with freinds.

Very good. I used beer bratwurst, Heineken beer, and red onions. I sauteed an orange bell pepper and some yellow onions to go with it, and we served it on good sub rolls. My fiance and I said eating this good meal made us feel like we were at the county fair, which is a delightful way to feel, in our opinion.

Not bad, I used several types of sausage including andouille and venision. I had tons of vidalia onions so used those as well. I also used run of the mill beer. I would like to try it again with really good beer but at the same time just grill some sausage and skip the entire poaching process to compare.

This is an interesting way to prepare sausages. I used Sapporo and Bratwurst as well as Italian Sausages, and they came out excellent. The beer really does bring out the taste of the sausages and the onions give it a sweet taste.

I'm with the cook suggesting freash bratwurst for the grilling. I used good old Sam Adams Beer (dark) for my brew and these came out great! One importatnt tip for kettle Wedder cooks like myself: Go get two of those coal spreaders and cook the links using the indirect method; that way you may fashion a home made tin foil "boat" as I did which will catch the beer saute and link juices that acuumulate. Then use your turkey baster to suck up the liquid and baste often during the cooking time (about 25 to 35 mins using this basting method due to the fact one lifts the lid often). I have done great things adapting this method(I learned at this great website from another nice person) and really made some GREAT baked chicken using my trusty-crusty Webber Kettle. Enjoy! Ciao ps: another tip to great fried rice is to use day old stale rice. I kid you not. Yummy. -S

This was a great way to prepare sausages. I use Bratwurst and it comes out great.

The sausages turned out great! I used a homebrew sort of similar to Sam Adams and simmered the sausages in that. I also used the onions and later added green pepper strips to the mixture after throwing out the excess beer, added a bit of beef broth and boiled that down for a nice sort of saucy vegetable side.

This was a very good and interesting way of preparing sausage. I used fresh bratwurst and Coors Light (I couldn't bring myself to use an expensive beer the first time), which I just happened to have left over from a cookout. As suggested, I used the indirect method of grilling, which gave the sausage an unusual crispy outer layer. I also served it with whole grain mustard, warm German potato salad and a hearty, crusty bread.

Without wanting to be rude, if you cooked any Receipe with Budweiser, it's unlikely to taste of much.

This was ok. I used bud for the beer. I'd make it again only to try different sausage and beer, to see if it made a difference. If not, then that would be the last time.
