Wonderful flavor! So easy and delicious. Had it with braised pork chops and boiled potatoes. I will definitely make this again. A great seasonal dish for the fall.

I was looking for a new way to cook sauerkraut (after I read on epicurious.com that it is good for your digestion in the same way yogurt is). I was surprised by the 2-hour cooking time too but went along with it -- keeping it covered the whole time with only 2 - 3 stirs. When I first tasted the final product, I thought "it's okay," but then I put a tad more sugar in it, left it at room temp. for ~30 minutes: Came back and yum!

Is the 2-hr simmer time a typo? It seems way too long, and this recipe is filed under 'quick & easy.'

Great counterpoint to the holiday bird---in our case, Cornish Game Hens with Cornbread Stuffing from this site---and rich side dishes. People want small portions of this. I cut the recipe way back because we were only two. I rinsed the sauerkraut in several changes of water to control salt. I had to add more wine because it tended to stick and overbrown. It could burn easily if you are not careful, so watch closely. Now that I think of it, I'll bet it would be a great dish to make in a slow cooker.

As a final farewell to Gourmet, we decided to do the entire Thanksgiving feast in the November 2009 issue. I was very skeptical about the idea of serving sauerkraut with turkey, but what a revelation! It was the perfect counterpoint to all the rich traditional dishes (and the leftovers are great cold from the fridge). We will be adding this to our annual feast and I think this would be terrific with roast pork.

This was a very nice sauerkraut and worth the time. I would add caraway seeds for an extra flavor.

This was nice, but I'm not sure that it was worth the effort. There were still a ton of leftovers, and it was still rather astringent.
