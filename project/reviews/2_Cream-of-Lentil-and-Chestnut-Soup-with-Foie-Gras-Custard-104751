Just not sure why in the world folks choose to comment on the "dastardly" foie gras, when the recipe calls for it. If you don't care for foie gras, why not make something else?

Doesn't make any sense. Why not serve the foie gras separately? Or on toast? Lentil soup needs some pork fat.

Thank you, Philadelphia! Foie gras is the epitome of cruelty - not elegance. This soup was lousy and though I made it without the liver, I don't think it would improve it any.

An appalling soup. Perhaps the recipie was badly written or there are mistakes. For instance, shouldn't the cream be heated before adding to foie gras? Still, I know a good lentil/foie gras soup exists, because I had it in a restaurant, and it was incredible (le hangar, paris).

Hmmm...gardenburger custard? I think this recipe is quite elegant and simple - though it involves several steps. Nice texture flavor combination.

This was a different and fun dish. I don't follow directions well. Used only 8 cups of water, added jalepeno and cummin seed. Substituted fois gras for a garden burger, it was just there in the fridge. My girlfriend's fancy palate really enjoyed this as well.
