I made this exactly as written and thought that it was a little bland. I added at least a cup of fresh parmesan and topped eached serving with toasted pine nuts (and more parmesan) before serving. The flavor profile is very delicate but I think it could handle another ingredient. I think I would add some shallots sauteed in white wine or possibly some capers next time. It's a good basic recipe that could be great with some tinkering.

I am generally not a fish lover, but I have made this dish many times as instructed and loved it evey time! The smoked trout is really fantastic with the other flavors. I finally came back to rate the recipe, and I enjoyed all the great suggestions for modifications

Used whole wheat penne and 2cans of smoked trout (drained the oil) from Trader Joes. Delicious and easy to make. Served with the lacinato kale and ricotta salata salad (also from this site) and the flavors complemented each other wonderfully.

Fabulous! We've made this dish on many occassions and it never fails to be a huge hit! The flavors of the trout, snap peas and cream are amazing, and other than a little advance prep work, this dish is super, super easy to make. It's great for an elegant and colorful dish for a dinner party or just an evening at home.

I love this recipe - it tastes complicated, but it is so easy. For convenience I have used the sardine size tins of smoked trout from Trader Joes. They are packed in oil, but still have tremendous flavor, and keep in the pantry for years. Two tins is the equivlant of 1/2lb, but I usually half the recipe to serve two people. Also, next time I will reduce the amount of pasta.

This was easy, quick and turned out more yummy than I expected. I am a flavor junky so I did add garlic and some parmesan to the cream sauce, but will try it next next without the cheese as the smoked trout packed a lot of flavor. The leftovers were gone the next day as everyone wanted them for lunch!!

Elegant taste for little time and effort! We really enjoyed this recipe, I would make it for company on a night I was pressed for time. I used hot-smoked B.C. salmon instead of the trout and shelled my peas as the pods were a little tough.

This was fast and yummy. The sugar snaps turned out perfectly. Next time I might add a little butter or a touch more cream.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was excellent. While I, too, considered using smoked salmon, I'm glad I went with the smoked trout. It was truly superb as it's flavor was a wonderful compliment to the sauce.

Started to write this review and then began to wonder. . . Is it fair to give a 4 fork review if you've modified the recipe? Since we didn't have the ingredients listed, we also made a few modifications and loved it! Substituted the trout with Scotty's Smoked Salmon (best in the west, done by a guy in Placerville, CA) Put in a cup of cream, used rotini instead of penne, which was great to catch all the lovely sauce, and topped it with Parmigiano-Reggiano. Next time I order Scotty's Smoked Salmon I'm going to increase the amount to have enough left over to make this again. I think the best part of this site is the creativity others encourage us to have in the kitchen. THANKS!

Ok sorry in advance, but I had to alter the recipe here... however, it was fabulous. I wanted to buy creme and penne on the way home from work (I was on my bike), but it started to rain. So instead I relied on my pantry which supplied: smoked bluefish purchased the day before, sugar snap peas, and fusilli. I used grated parmesan, gogonzola, and butter (small amount) in lieu of the creme and also added some finly sliced/chopped red onion, the small remains of a head radicchio (chopped), and garnish of thai basil. The lemon zest in this dish was great. The creme would have been a good addition and I would have kept the gorgonzola and parmesan but eliminated the radicchio in that case. I will make this again next week with those changes, though I am not a big fan of penne - prefer rigatoni or spirals but I'll keep with the fusilli for this dish (which I broke into smaller pieces before cooking). Excellent!

Made this for dinner last night after a late night at the office. It was quick, easy and absolutely delicious! In about 20 minutes, it was done (did prep work while water was coming to a boil and pasta was cooking). Used a wild smoked trout (instead of farmed rainbow trout), highly recommended by the fishmonger, which greatly enhanced the dish. Everything else was as the recipe directed, except I added the rest of the container of cream at the end because it was a little dry. I think asparagus would be great in here too, if sugar snap peas weren't available. Absolutely wonderful!!
