I was disappointed with this one. It reminded me of pimento cream cheese. The texture was very thick. If I made again I would add more of the chipotle than recipe suggests to add interest.

I liked this sauce but went a little to heavy on the chipotle chilies (3/4 tsp). Next time I will use the 1/2 tsp or less because the smokey flavor of the chilies (I'm assuming the only way they come is in adobo sauce?) competes to much with the roasted peppers. Also, I didn't have time to let the yogurt drain overnight and it didn't effect the consistency. They probably drained for about an hour.

I have made this recipe several times. I serve it with blanched asparagus. It is excellent as a first course or as a dip for fresh veggies.

The flavour of the red pepper contrasting with the artichoke was just super for a special dinner with my husband. It isn't often we dine alone(because of the kids) so I like to make something special when I can. This fit the bill!!!
