This recipe left me not impressed, the flavor was sort of...blah. My boyfriend is not a picky eater and his comment sort of sums up my review, "well, there's no reason to make that pot pie again". If you are a foodie, search for a recipe that will give a more robust flavor.

Made this twice -- too watery both times despite reducing the amount of broth substantially. Will move on to another recipe...

Delicious! I have just a handful of recipes that I make over and over again (because I love to try new recipes), but this one has made the list of recipes to repeat. The mini pot pies are simple to prepare and reheat well in a toaster oven. The creme fraiche and bacon are outstanding.

Easy and tasty. I added a couple of sliced baby portobellas, and used dried marjoram. I low-boiled until the chicken broth was reduced to about half. I used Philadelphia Cooking Creme (don't hate me -- my supermarket didn't have creme fraiche). Served it with shrimp marinated in mustard vinaigrette then grilled, and an avocado-grapefruit-baby leaf salad with a mint-grapefruit juice-shallot (no-oil) dressing.

OK when my partner starts telling me I should open a business selling these it has to be a 4 fork recipe! I didn't have creme fraiche so used white wine and heavy cream in addition to chicken broth. I added peas and mushrooms. I cook all the ingredients together in a crockpot then ladled into individual casserole dishes and topped with puff pastry--then cooked at 375 for about 40 minutes. Knockout!

Wow...what a great pot pie!....I followed it almost to the letter, with the the only thing I cut the amount of carrots by 1/2...and added peas...I will so make this again!

WOnderful, I made the large version of this instead of four smaller ones. I made it in my dutch oven instead of a pie pan. It made it so much simpler for a weeknight dinner.

I didn't have the souffle dishes for this, so I made one large pot pie and it was great. I think it would have been much more of a wow dish in the individual cups, so I'll have to try that next time. I substituted peas for the beans, used whipping cream instead of creme fraiche and added a few tablespoons of apple cider vinegar. The flavor was spot on and the vinegar definitely made it just a bit more savory. The frozen puff pastry was so not worth the extra cost at the supermarket, I'll definitely be making a crust next time.

Why did I never think of adding bacon to a pot pie before?! I married this recipe with another that used leeks, shallots, and red wine and it was perfection : ) The puff pastry makes it so much easier than a homemade crust.

Rating: 4
Tasted great, and also looked really nice as individual pies. Recipe could use more detail about how much of the bacon drippings to use; I poured off most before I proceeded with onions, but it still may have been too greasy.

Did everything as suggested, except substituted creme fraiche with buttermilk in the same quantity. Was slightly disappointed at how runny it was. Would advise cooking the liquid down way more or thicken the sauce as seen fit.

Rating: 4
Wow! This is the best thing I have made in some time. Largely followed the recipe except cut back on carrots and sliced them as sometimes they don't get done. Had to cut the oven back to 350 after 10 minutes to keep the puff pastry from burning. The flavors meshed perefectly!

I made this tonight. It's great. I used canned chicken breast, as we only like white meat, not dark. I didn't have cream on hand, so used half and half. Added 3 well-beaten eggs. Used some Poultry seasoning. Made the pastry for the top from the Chicken, Ham and Fennel recipe on this site. Great!

I would make this again...need to work on a good crust.

Excellent recipe. I didn't use a packaged chicken but made a whole one (rest of the chicken will be tomorrow's chicken soup. Substituted buttermilk and cream for the creme fraiche. I used a full size souffle dish instead of individual dishes. Added about 2 teaspoons of salt.

love, love, love this recipe! i didnt want to spend the money on fresh marjoram (since i have nothing else to make with it!), so i used dried oregano. i cut the carrot quantity down to about half of what was called for and just used fresh green beans instead of haricot vert. i used the entire tub (about a full cup) of creme fraiche, as, again, i had nothing else to make with it and didnt want it to go to waste. instead of puff pastry (which also seemed really expensive), i just used pillsbury cresent roll dough for the top. everything turned out delicious and i will DEFINITELY make this again!

Skipped the bacon, used 1 cup of celery, frozen peas, and steamed carrots. Subed thyme for the marjoram. Super easy and tasted great!. Will definatly make again and next time might add some garlic.

I used sour cream and half & half as I couldn't find the creme fraiche.I had to use dried marjoram and added some fresh thyme. I put on a bottom crust. The 2 1/2 cups of carrots seemed way too much and I really like carrots. My family just didn't like the taste.The bacon seemed to take over the dish and I just didn't feel the flavors ever meshed.

Rating: 3
Made this with puff pastry on the bottom (baked for 18 minutes at 400 degrees) as well as on the top, and subbed 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 half-and-half for the creme fraiche. Used peas and regular green beans snipped into inch long segments, chopped carrots as well. Delicious! If you can't find creme fraiche, make sure to reduce the liquid a bit longer (like 11 - 12 minutes) so it won't be runny.

Easy to make and so yummy! Would probably add some more vegetables next time

Rating: 4
Delicious! I made a few changes based on what I had around the house... canned green beans... chicken tenderloins that I cooked in the sauce and matchstick carrots vs baby carrots. This is a bit time consuming and doesn't make a good middle of the week dinner unless you make it in advance and then just throw on the top and bake on the evening you plan on eating it. Next time I make it I plan on doubling the recipe and freezing some for the next time!

Rating: 0
This was great! I wanted a yummy recipe for a group that is a little picky (no lamb, no eggs etc) and this fit the bill. The local grocer did not have haricot verdes so I subbed frozen peas and it was still delicious! A big hit, and I will make it again.

I made these a little smaller (1 cup size) for a potluck, and one of my friends asked if it would be rude if she licked the bowl! I substituted fresh rosemary and dried thyme for the marjoram, and made a cornstarch slurry to make sure it thickened. Next time I will add a little salt, but otherwise these were great!

I have made this twice for my family and really liked it, especially with a bit of dijon mustard, but I found a better Epicurious recipe for chicken pot pie that I made just tonight. My family loved this new one much more. It's called "chicken and fall vegetable pot pie".

Just made this last night and it was very good, the flavors were wonderful. I didn't have any creme fraiche, used heavy cream instead. I also added some potatoes. The broth could have been thicker, but I think I didn't reduce it enough. Will definitely make this again.

I am surprised that this got such a high rating. While it was an "okay" pot pie, I didn't think it was as fabulous as everyone else did. I would wish for a creamier filling with more flavor.

Rating: 4
This is without a doubt one of my favorite recipes to make again and again. I always freeze my left over rotisserie chicken and pie crust ends and when I have enough, I make the recipe. I make 8 one-cup portions and freeze them in my vacuum sealer to pull out when I need a quick lunch or dinner. I usually use canned carrots and canned cut green beans and frozen chopped onion to make it faster and easier to do last minute since I don't always have fresh carrots and green beans. I have also used left over roasted carrots and roasted green beans, too.

Rating: 4
SOOOO delicious! It was a little time consuming but beyond worth it. That may have been because I added a bunch more veggies which increased the prep time. I included more carrots (cut them in long quarters) and green beans and added leeks and par blanched potatoes (cubed). I definitely recommend prepping the veggies ahead of time. The creme fraiche (5 bucks per 8oz) was pretty pricey but added the special oomph. The fresh marjoram was a clutch ingredient also... I wouldn't advise using dry. I doubled the recipe and made 3 large pot pies. I also put some puff pastry in the bottom of 2 out of the three and it definitely helped it stay together better. Not light on the calories but oh well. Overall... YUM YUM YUM!

I just happened to have almost all the ingredients, and it turned out great! I use sour cream instead of creme fraiche. I also did a little butter and flour to thicken the sauce. The puff pastry made a great crust.

Rating: 4
I think this is a great option for first time cooks or others that have time constraints, left overs or are creative. I did the bacon, cut it up in advance, did not realize it should have been cut up later. Yes it was organic apple-wood smoked. I added more veggies. I par cooked some cubed potatoes and added them to the bacon/onion saute. I cut down on the carrots because I added some peas. I did not have fresh marjoram but my chicken broth was heavily dilled (homemade) and I used a mix of dried marjoram and fresh thyme and it was great. Did not have creme fraiche so I took some heavy cream, tossed it into the container of sour cream that had some left and added separately a bit of king arthur flour to thicken but you know, it did not really need it. Used Pepperidge Farm Puff pastry as a topping, did it a a one dish thing and it was great. For those that have time constraints, suggest cutting up all the veggies in advance and store them. I have some filling left over and will try another tomorrow as it looks fine but also, the pepper is impt and do taste for salt after you mix everything together as I needed to add a bit. This is a great receipe for you to be creative on your veggies and still have a one dish meal.

Rating: 0
Made a turkey pot pie using this receipe as a basis. Used 2 Tps of dried Marojam and 1/2 tps of dried thyme. Used leftover turkey gravy, sourcream and butter in lieu of the cream. Used only 1 cup chicken broth. This was a big hit, the taste if terrific. Great comfort food.

Rating: 4
Creme fraiche is extremely easy to make and quite worth the effort. Just mix i c heavy cream with 2 tbls of buttermilk and let it sit, at room temperature, until it thickens. We also added celery at the base level for the holy trinity. Just excellent!

Rating: 4
Really tasty! I didnt have any Marjoram so I used Tarragon and it's sweet flavor really helped the taste. I grilled my own 6 pound chicken so I had a lot of leftover, almost enough to make a second pie (I did it in a 9" pie dish) Takes longer but the chicken tastes excellent, would make again.

Rating: 4
OMG this recipe was so good, definatley going to try it again next week. I used 4 tsp of dried Wild Oregano instead of Marjoram, this adds a great flavor. I definately recommend using creme fraiche and a roaster chicken from the deli section, the chicken was very moist. I also used pre-rolled puff pastry which was in the fridge section... no fuss just cut out the shapes I wanted. I cannot believe how well this recipe turned out.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe- easy to prepare.Didn't have marjoram so used celery tops, minced. Used beurre manier (equal parts flour and room temp butter mixed together--used about 2T for this recipe) to thicken gravy. Cooked at 350/325F as the cooked chicken mix was still warm and it was really only a matter of baking the pastry vs cooking the contents. Pastry didn't burn at the lower temp. This is definitely on the rotation in our household.

Honestly, this recipe is one of the easiest I have used on epicurious and the chicken pot pie turned out great! Creme fraiche was hard to find by me so I think I substituted either sour cream or light cream and it still turned out well

Delicious!!! I used Thyme instead of marjoram and peas instead of beans as well as an applewood roasted chicken. This added a lot of good flavor. To thicken up the sauce, I used some Wondra gravy flour. My 10 and 13 year olds loved it. We will definitely make it a regular in our house.

Delicioso! Made this as a 9 inch deep dish pie. Substituted combo of sour cream and half and half for the creme fraiche. Also used 6 T of marjoram. My guests loved that this was not the traditional overly heavy/creamy pot pie. I would also follow other reviewers and cut the amount of carrots to 8 oz. I roasted three chicken breast halves in the oven with olive oil and salt and pepper as opposed to buying an already roasted chicken.

Rating: 3
Yum! This was very good, I loved the marjoram...it gave it a very non-traditional flavor. Not too heavy, more substance than other chicken pot pies I've had. The cooking time was a bit long...my crust started to burn. Also, next time I will cook my own chicken breasts, since the store bought one was a bit greasy...

I have made this several times and each time it has been wonderful. I prefer using thyme over marjoram--it is easier to get. Also, pepper bacon over plain bacon and I have been adding peas too. A crowd pleaser!

A note to the cook from Petaluma: I have had similar problems with many pies. My solution is to wrap the edges of the crust, but not the center with aluminum foil. I remove it when I want it to start crisping. I hope this helps. I love chicken pot pie and this was a solid recipe. Also, I make individuals for my husband and myself to take to work for lunch; a creme brule dish is usually the perfect size.

Rating: 4
This is absolutely wonderful. I used halfway whipped heavy cream instead of creme fraiche, and it worked out fine. Make sure you really reduce the broth down once you add it to the onion mixture or it'll be too liquidy. I also substituted shitake mushrooms for the green beans and it added a really nice earthy flavor. As for the crust, I used ready-made puff pastry sheets. I baked the inner crust first, then put the filling in, then put the top crust on and baked for 17 minutes. Perfect!

Rating: 4
Wow. So simple. I followed the recipe though I did choose the option of making it in one 9' square dish and used Trader Joes pastry (frozen) which I rolled out slightly and then just placed the entire square on top. The only modification I made was to put 6 t. of marjoram. I agree with the previous review...it is a necessity. The only thing I would change is to half the baby carrots lengthwise and perhaps use slightly less.

Rating: 4
made the recipe with sour cream instead of creme fraiche. flavor was still great. would reduce amount of carrots and sub potato or corn. also the crust was a little soggy, but i think that may be because i didn't let it thaw enough before baking.

Rating: 4
This was delicious! Should have read the other reviews. I burnt the edges the puff pastry. Baking 22 minutes was much too long! 17 minutes probably would have been sufficient. The flavor was excellent but the sauce was not thick enough for my husband (although our daughter and I enjoyed it just as written),next time I will thicken it up with cornstarch.

I made a roast chicken with gravy and green beans the night prior. I then used the leftovers to quickly make the pot pie filling. I made a small amount of white sauce, then added my leftover pan gravy. This was a great alternative as I can never find creme fraiche. This meal was so delicious and easy- my husband and I loved it!!

Absolutely delicious! Creme Fraiche is a must and should not be substituted. The only adjustment I would recommend is 2 bacon slices instead of 5, and I wiped the pan out a bit before adding onions - 5 would have been way too much.

I followed it exactly, but I added 1/2 cup of green peas and cut back on the carrots. I also added 2 teaspoons of the dijon mustard that was suggested by another cook, and it was a delicious touch. I also made the pie in a traditional double-crust format. My only dissapointment was that the filling was so wet and runny and it needed a little salt, which I added when I served it. I would reduce the sauce further next time or add a little cornstarch. I will definitely try it again with these alterations.

I loved this dish. No complaints here. This is the first dish that I have made in months that was great the first time around and needed no adjustments. I read earlier reviews and I am not sure I understand the thickening of the sauce. Once all the meats and vegatables are added there is almost no sauce to being with. I could not find puff pastry (too lazy to go to more than one store. This is a fast and easy recipie...right?) I just used a thawed pie crust and layed it over the filling. Make sure to get fresh majoram. Makes all the difference in the sauce.

will use my leftover turkey in this terrific recipe. the fresh marjoram and creme fraiche are key to the great taste of this recipe. to me the appeal is that it isn't a thick sauce, not as heavy as usual pot pie.

All of us, including my 12 year old son, loved this dish. I added diced red potatoes and cut down the amount of carrots. I did not have fresh marjoram so I used dried, and it worked well. As recommended in prior reviews,I also used a cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce (1 tbsp. dissolved in 1 tbsp. chicken broth), this made a great sauce.I used Trader Joe's roast chicken which adds great flavor and Trader Joe's puff pastry which is also very good.

I too loved this recipe...don't skip the fresh marjoram if at all possible. It really brings out the flavor of the vegetables. I didn't find it bland at all and I did substitute heavy cream for the creme fraiche with excellent results. Based on other reviewers comments about the sauce being too thin, I did make a corn starch slurry and added it at the very end. I also added a handful of quartered baby red potatoes, it was a perfect addition. Like a few others, I cut down slightly on the amount of carrots. Will definitely make again.

I made this last night and it was very easy and teenagers really liked it. I used a bag of precooked frozen 'grilled' chicken instead and added extra broth and creme fraiche.

I might cut down on carrots and add peas or broccoli next time.

This is such a great tasting dish. I used left over home-made pie crust that I had in the freezer and rolled it out very thin to save on calories and fat.
