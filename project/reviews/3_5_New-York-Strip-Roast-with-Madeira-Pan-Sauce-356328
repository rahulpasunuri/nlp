Since I couldn't find any New York strip roasts in my neighborhood, I just substituted a prime rib roast for it and it still tasted wonderful! I also used red wine instead of a Madeira so it turned out pretty good. Overall, this was a quick, easy, and stylish recipe to make and one that pleased my boyfriend's stomach :)

Delicious, and simple to make Description in recipe is incorrect, and must refer to another dish

This is just another wonderful recipe for the holidays. I served it on New Year's Day and it went over quite well. The preparation and actual cooking time are quite manageable. I truly feel sorry for the person that thought it had no flavor. The flavor and texture of the meat paired with the suggested Cabernet Sauvignon was outstanding.

Just to clarify, a new york strip roast is not at all the same thing as a standing rib roast. If you think of an individual steak, the strip steak is a completely different cut from the rib-eye. The roast is no different. If the recipe calls for a certain kind of roast, it certainly is in your best interest to try to purchase the proper cut. The cooking technique will be totally different and the way the roast itself takes the flavor of the recipe will vary as well. In my opinion, a strip roast is the best beef roast option outside of the tenderloin.

I'm giving this four forks on principal to counter the previous reviewer who used completely the wrong cut of meat and thinks it does not make a difference.

My family did not like this at all. I had to get a silver tip roast. I can't imagine that matters all that much, for there was very little flavor in this recipe. Very disappointing!

Beef has thirteen ribs, and usually seven of those are contained in the "rib" cut. The chuck contains the first five ribs, while the thirteenth rib is usually left on the short rib at the packing plant. The primal rib cut normally contains the sixth through the twelfth rib. Those ribs closest in proximity to the short loin are the most tender, while the ones nearest the chuck are less so. When purchasing a standing rib roast, ask your butcher for the smaller end of the rib portion. The ribs should be trimmed so that they are no more than 7-8 inches in length. The back strap, chine bone and feather bones should be removed. This makes for easier carving at the table. Allow for 2 portions per rib. A four rib roast should provide an adequate serving for eight people. Avoid using anything less than a 3 rib portion as a roast unless you prefer a well done roast. Smaller cuts are best used as steaks. Could also be a rib-eye roast. New York strip loin, also called top loin of beef, is a succulent, elegant roast. If you want a lot of leftovers (they are great for sandwiches), use a seven-pound roast and multiply the seasonings by 1 1/2. Either way, have your butcher trim some of the fat, leaving about 1/4 inch for the best flavor. With this as your entrée, uncork a Cabernet. Yum! :-)

A New York Strip roast is a similar to a Standing Rib roast, except that it is boneless.

Can someone please tell me what is a New York Strip Roast (as opposed to a prime rib roast)?

Very nice on the holiday table. Frozen butter will not burn as it blends into the sauce after removed from the heat source. Poker Guys give this one a thumbs up on taste and looks.

does anyone know why the butter is frozen? I am curious.
