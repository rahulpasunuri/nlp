The sauce was amazing! I used a combo of scallops and shrimp and served as an entree. The only changes I made were that I squeezed about a tablespoon of fresh orange juice into the dipping sauce and used a little more chili-garlic sauce as we love spicy. Husband raved about this all evening.

Though I'm not a big fan of orange in savory foods, I decided to try this recipe based off of all the great reviews. I was surprised on how flavorful this was. I did double all ingredients except for the honey; I actually did less than 1/4 cup of honey. Also, instead of the chili-garlic sauce I added cocktail sauce which gave it just the perfect kick without it being spicy. This is my new go to recipe for asian style scallops.

I served this last night as an appetizer and literally everyone raved about it. The wonderful flavors that erupted in this bold combination of ingredients are a symphony to the senses. I wouldn't change a thing.

One of my favorite ways to prepare scallops...I serve them as first course on white porcelaine spoons. Use a mid size scallop so it slides right into your mouth with the sauce.

I am not always a fan of scallops - they can be bland and uninteresting. But not when paired with this wonderful sauce! It is very bold and flavorful, definitely should be served on the side. The only thing I would do different is use less sesame seeds. I love em, but I seemed like overkill in this recipe. Also, I was surpised at how much the citrus flavor came out. All in all - a recipe with lots of punch!

Escellent. Had no chili-garlic sauce so I used ketchup,powered garlic and a dash of Chipotle Tabasco Sauce. Grilled the sea scallops after basting with oil and mint/cilantro mixture.

This was a big hit as a salad at a party last night. Followed reviewers recommendations and doubled everything but the honey in the dressing, tossed the shrimp in a little bit of the dressing to marinate for 30 minutes and then sauteed - would also be good on the grill. Then tossed the shrimp with spring greens, shredded carrots, snap peas and roasted peanuts - great, light and fast.

Excellent! Really liked the sauce, but good scallops are great on their own. Left the cilantro and mint on the side.

I made this as an appetizer for a party. It was really wonderful. I did modify the sauce a bit, used toasted black sesame seeds because that's what I had on hand. Great recipe.

Absolutely delicious, my guests loved it. Following other reviewers' advice I used the following proportions: kept honey the same (so not too sweet) & doubled all other ingredients for the sauce. Put in an entire bunch each of mint & cilantro. Cooked 2.25 lbs of scallops with basmati rice. Served scallops over rice with sauce on top. This served 5 people with no leftovers.

probably very good as written, but i took the advice of other reviewers and served in the sauce over rice as main course. in that preparation it is far, far too sweet, the honey easily overpowering the sweet flavor of the scallops. might try as main again, but only with a fraction of the honey.

Just tried this for dinner. It was really excellent. Made a few substituations - didn't have the chili garlic sauce on hand so used Sambal Oelek instead. Also left out the orange rind as I didn't have any. Increased the ginger, cilantro and mint and added the sauce to the pan after cooking the scallops. Really tasty. A keeper

This is such a delicious recipe. A real hit with the gang at the cottage. I will make this again and again and again.

Love it as is and as a main course. I take the rind off a Mandarin or Clemantine and saute the sections at the end, with the scallops. Take the scallops out and add the sauce to the pan and reduce a bit. Serve over rice. Forget the skewered appetizers. This is a lovely main.

This is good. I recommend draining the scallops after cooking them before transfering them to the bowl.

LOVE this recipe. easy and always a hit! the sauce is the winner -- planning to use tomorrow with shrimp.

The sauce is awesome. I added more sesame oil and more soy sauce as I found it too sweet for my tastes and used this as a dipping sauce for Spring Rolls. The sauce was so good that people were using is as salad dressing!

Wonderful as a meal (without skewers). The sauce was a tad watery but wonderful. I replaced the cilantro with parsley and added a tad more orange and chili sauce for kick. Flavorful and did not overpower the scallops.

I made this a few weeks ago and it was really tasty. I am back to get the recipe again because I'm making it for a party. I didn't find the scallops expensive nor the sauce overpowering. I kept the sauce as a dipping sauce so that we could dip as much or as little as we liked.

I found this overpowering and a waste for expenseive scallops. Also, a bit of work for the dubious results.

Very easy to prepare and a crowd pleaser. Served the scallops halved on a bed of lettuce with the sauce in the center for dipping. Everyone loved the sauce and everything availble was dipped in it. Sauce would be good with a variety of foods.

I love the flavor of scallops and while the sauce had great flavor I think it overpowered the scallops. I'll keep looking for a great scallop recipe.

I agree the sauce was excellent and very easy to prepare. I served it as an appetizer, cutting large scallops into bite-sized pieces, lined the rim of an oblong glass dish with orange slices and lettuce. It was not only delicious, but pretty too. I used defrosted scallops and they had too much moisture in them and they steamed in the pan. They were fine, but next time I will make sure they are dry.

I would prepare this again, without question. Our guests, one scallop fanatic, LOVED it. The sauce would be great with other things, as well. Great blend of flavors with no one taste overpowering the others.

Delicious! No changes needed to this yummy recipe. I served it with fried rice and we ended up spooning the sauce over the rice. It's a perfect recipe to impress your guests.

I served this dish as an appetizer for my father-in-laws birthday. It was quite a hit! The sauce was excellent. I used a round platter, put the sauce in the middle, had baby greens all around and placed the scallops on them. I also cut the scallops into bite sized pieces so they could be eaten with wooden party forks. This dish complimented the grilled soy and ginger steak with wasabi mashed potatoes that we had as our entree. YUMMY!

Excellent sauce.

Made the recipe exactly. Very good. The sauce makes this dish. We had it as a main dish with some rice. It would make a great appetizer using the little scallops. We used the leftover sauce the following day with some leftover chicken. Very versatile

I was lucky enough to have this dish served to me at a recent Cooking Club and I was BLOWN AWAY!The scallops were neither here nor there, but the gem of this recipe is the dipping sauce. It is exquisite and complex in nature with layers of flavor. With the combination of cilantro,mint, and orange zest it was incredibly *fresh* on the tongue. This sauce would be fantastic as a base for stir fry, a spring/salad roll dipping sauce, or a wonderful marinade for chicken or tuna. Fantastic!

This was a fabulous appetizer. I served 3 scallops per person on a bed of field greens with some slivers of red cabbage and carrots, sauce as dressing. It is a keeper.

Great as entre with rice and broccoli. I will definitly serve as appetizer at our dinner party. The dipping sauce certainly has a punch of flavor! This was my first time cooking scallops, 2 min each side was the perfect amount of time. ENJOY!

this recipe gets RAVE reviews! i have made it 3 times, for different parties, and it flies off the plate.........the flavors are intense and it is very easy to do....have substituted the scallops with swordfish and the result was awesome! i don't use skewers, just put out plates and small forks for the scallops and/or swordfish even more intese flavor the next day

These flew off the plate at a cocktail party I had. The sauce really made it. I seared in a nonstick pan w/no oil. Worked just fine.

Made this for New's Year Eve and it was a huge hit! We often make the sauce for grilled talapia (sp?) instead of scallops.

I thought the dipping sauce was wonderful, and I still do, although with the scallops (themselves excellent) the combination seemed not quite up to par. Really good with the broccoli, though, which I served on the side. I'll definitely use the leftover sauce with another course, perhaps pork tenderloin, or salmon or spring rolls. We felt the sauce was just a little too sweet. Another time I'd cut back on the honey. As I was making a main course for two, I didn't use the skewers. I also cut back by half on the mint, cilantro and sesame seeds for the sauce. As written, it would have been 6 tablespoons for a small amount of sauce which seemed too much to me.

The sauce was fabulous. The scallops really needed to be sauteed in a non-stick pan as I used the required amount of oil and they still stuck.
