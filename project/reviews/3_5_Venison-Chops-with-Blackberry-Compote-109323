I made the compote and cooked a venison shortloin sous vide at 126 degrees for 75 minutes; I then simply seasoned with salt and pepper and seared over high heat with minimal oil . The compote was an excellent accompaniment to the venison. My 11 year old son devoured his portion!

I have been eating deer for years and never thought to do fruit on it. This recipe is great. The compote and rosemary compliment the venison very well, I will be doing this again. And will have my butcher cut chops this hunting season too.

I loved this dish so much. The compote balances out the richness of the meat and it's super easy to make. I accidentally bought more venison than I needed so I will definitely make this again!

Follow the baking instructions - the venison is done perfectly.

I have made this 4 times. I make it with lamb chops because I do not have access to venison. The butter and mint are very important at the end. They add complexity and richness. Do watch the sweetness, a very tart apple will help, and make sure the salt balances out the tartness at the end. YUM!

I skipped the butter and mint for the sauce because it seemed like it would dominate the dish and distract from the venison. Based on the other reviews, I used less sugar too. The plain blackberry, apple, brandy sauce was fantastic, a perfect balance to the venison. And it looks like a million bucks on the plate. Really a great recipe. Very easy.

I was looking for a Venison recipe w/ blackberries, and remembered reading this previously, but in light of the less-than-encouraging reviews, I looked further and served my venison tenderloin with the Blackberry Sauce with the Duck with Blackberry Sauce (Bon Appetit 02/96) from this site....which was fantastic.

Shouldn't have wasted the venison on this. Compote is okay, but nothing special. Better with phesant or duck I would think. Sweet, fennely italian venison sausages do not equal Venison chops FYI.

I made the compote according to the recipe to go with some fresh butcher-made venison sausage with Italian spices. It was good, but too sweet for me. I will make it again since I have more sausage to use up, but next time I will half or even omit the sugar. I served the venison and compote with steamed carrots and rutabaga, sauteed spring onions, and a salad of fresh spinach, warm goat cheese, dried cranberries, walnuts, raw red onion and a fig balsamic dressing. The salad turned out to outshine the main course. The venison & compote combo matched well with a California merlot wine.
