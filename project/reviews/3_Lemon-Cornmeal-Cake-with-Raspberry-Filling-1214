This was just OK, although the whipped cream was fabulous. The cake was dry and there is absolutley no way you can divide in thirds when baked in a 9" pan.

You FORGOT to add SUGAR to butter in the recipe. It ruined my cake because I had to add at the end, when the batter was already beaten. This cake, however, was first discovered in a magazine; from recipe, I've baked this 4 or 5 times. It's ridiculously delicious and light. This much lemon zest takes 10-12 lemons, so buy a lot. and try to use a fine zester for the frosting, otherwise it feels chunky.

My husband loves this cake and asks me to make it each year for his birthday (it's been 3 years now). I'm not so crazy about it, myself. It's kind of dry and crispy as far as cakes go. Also, I don't know how it's expected that it can sliced into 3 layers, I make it with only 2. It's an interesting recipe, not too difficult, but if you're looking for a light and fluffy cake look somewhere else =o/

I made this for an 80th birthday. The receipe looked so good. The end product was very short almost a cookie consistancy. There was no way to split a layer to make it a 3 layer cake. The taste was interesting, but not good. Atleast the meal was good.......

I made this for a friend's birthday,and everyone loved it! A word of caution, the cake ingredients mention the 2/3 c. sugar, but it was omitted from the directions - so don't forget to cream it with the butter!!!
