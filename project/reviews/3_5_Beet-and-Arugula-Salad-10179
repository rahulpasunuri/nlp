I made the mistake of making this too early and by the time I served it the arugula had wilted. I would serve immedietly and also follow the suggestion of the cook from Manteca, CA and roast the beets.

ROAST the beets instead (400 degrees for about an hour), it tastes so much better. After roasting, peel off the outer skin. Add goat cheese and pine nuts to the salad. Add fresh oregano to the dressing. DELICIOUS!

This is a very simple, very satisfying salad that showcases both ingredients.
