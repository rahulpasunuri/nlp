Me -- "light and refreshing!" My husband -- "...but still so warm and satisfying!" All of the individual flavors really mellowed out in the oven in a way that complimented each other. My husband isn't a green olive or tomato fan but I still made the recipe exactly as written and he loved it! I used tilapia and served with a greens/cucumber salad with cilantro. Awesome! I will be making this again!

Frankly...fabulous. I used hog snapper as it was a fresh catch at my green market...prepared as directly and everyone loved it. So very healthy too!

The black beans were wonderful all by themselves but I agree with the most recent reviewer, the dish did not gel together. Not much room on the plate if you serve the wrapped packet.

The presentation was wonderful but I found the dish needed more flavor. Each ingredient was great but too independent and it did not infuse together for that all around flavor. Next time I will carmalize the onions and then add the other ingredients (except the fish) and allow them to simmer and infuse together before adding them together in the parchment. As a side note I made the chickpea, eggplant, and tomato tarts as a side dish for the meal. Wonderful!

I love this dish. It's very, very easy and fast, and it presents elegantly. The tastes are subtle, so don't expect ka-pow flavors, but I personally like that in a cod dish. It's also very light, so we had it as the third course of a huge Christmas Eve meal, and were able to eat (and enjoy) it all.

I was so excited to make this dish based on the ingredients and rave reviews. I found it only so-so. It came out very salty (I'm blaming it on the olives bc I didn't use a lot of salt to season it). And I found working with the parchment to be unwieldy. It was good, but not great and I wouldn't bother with this recipe again.

Phenomenal! The combination of flavors and textures is spectacular. We absolutely loved this dish - we felt like we were eating in a four-star restaurant. I had never used parchment to cook before, but it was pretty straightforward and allowed each serving to be infused with all of the different flavors; it also makes for a very interesting presentation and would be great fun with guests. Word to the wise - the chipotle butter is quite spicy so if you aren't used to heat, you might want to back off the amount a bit.

I have made this dish several times. It is always good. I like it because it is quick, easy, and delicious. I have substituted cod and tilapia for the scrod with excellent results. Instead of using string to tie the bundles, I cut a large heart shape piece of parchment and fold it over and seal it by folding the edges over on themselves.

This is now one of my tried and true recipes (see review below), but I wanted to give some additional feedback. I decided to make it tonight and when I went to get my parchment out, there was a two inch wide strip left. Out of luck, I used foil instead and I think the results were far less superior b/c of it. The liquids get more absorbed in the fish when using parchment and it is a much better dish. Also, I used real chipotle (rather than chipotle powder which I had to sub last time), but I think I might like the chipotle powder better -- it seemed to give it a much more intense, smoky flavor than than the chile itself. Up to you, but thought this might help.

This was fantastic! An amazing combination of flavor and such aroma. I was out of town and couldn't get canned chipotle, so I substituted chipotle powder and it worked just fine. We used orange roughy and it really was a show stopper. Everyone loved it... I never knew I could love a piece of simple fish so much.

Excellent! Only change I made was to add a sprig of rosemary (only fresh herb I had on hand). Also wonderful because I have a bunch of picky eaters. One doesn't like tomatoes, another wine and another does not care for spicy. I just line up the squares of parchment paper and make it to order, however to me it is best with everything!!

This dish is terrific - you can swap out all kinds of ingredients easily for variation and use of what's on hand. Try this with red snapper to dress it up for a special occasion. During the winter (or if you can't get good tomatoes) premium canned, diced ones work just fine. South Beach Dieters - sub a drizzle of olive oil and some chipolte hot sauce for the butter mixture (omitting the wine) and this dish is even Phase one friendly!

Very nice, and (as someone said earlier) amazingly easy clean up. I like the idea of trying an italian version too. I would add more olives to this the next time, and I do wonder how you are supposed to know when the fish is done when you're not able to see it or feel it, but thats all beside the point. This is a nice, different fish dish.

Total victory at a dinner party with this one. Everyone said it was a great combination of flavors and an unexpected way to handle codfish. I served it with green beans in cilantro (you can search for the recipe here). Great fish recipe for Lent!

This is a lovely recipe - such a nice combination of flavors and textures. It is easy to assemble, fun to serve, and cleanup is a breeze. I suspect it would work well with any firm fish. Others have mentioned sea bass which I unfortunately can't get in central New Hampshire

Excellent flavour, although the parchment tends to leak a little. Also works well with chipotle powder if whole peppers aren't available.

I made 4 packets with sea bass and 2 with 1/2lb., pounded pieces of chicken breast. The fish was far better. The chicken and the beans with it picked up too much sour lime taste. I was experimenting - it's with fish from now on. However, everything cooked in 30 minutes - I made this 2 hours ahead and the packets were cold. That's as far ahead as I will ever make this delicious dish - both my teenagers liked it.

I have made this recipe at least a dozen times over the years. (I always use sea bass.) It is the easiest dinner party recipe and guests love the element of surprise when they untie the bow on their parchment pouches. The combination of flavors wonderful and the chipotle peppers give it a kick! I always get rave reviews.

Very flavorful. I have made fish in parchment before and it was very bland, so I'm happy to have this example of one that works. I have already experimented with another version of this, using Italian spices and white beans with anchovy butter.

Interesting combination, but I had to "bump-up" the spices.

I rate recipes from a+ down. Then I have a S+ for those exceptional recipes that rate a special catagory. This is one of them! A sophisticated, complex blend of flavors that plays a symphony in your mouth. Not a week day meal, but more than worth the effort for that special occassion or for guests. Have had nothing but rave comments when I've shared it with guests, even those who don't usually eat fish.
