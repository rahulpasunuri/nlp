My nephew and I made these today. Ours were a lighter green so looked much less like spinach. We were going to tell people we made a very healthy festive cookie and pretend they were spinach. We then decided to pipe red bows on them. We used red mini m and m and glued them on with green icing. We are going to eat them and not use for ornaments. In fact we will start after breakfast. We plan on making this a lifetime tradition.

At least two people on my cookie recipient list love these things so I make these every year even though I hate them and think they are disgusting. They are easy to make and do look pretty on a cookie platter. The trick is to work quickly and keep spraying your fingers with cooking spray.

These cookies are a tradition in my bf's family. We've made them together a couple of times using different recipes from the web, but this one wins. The suggestion of keeping the pot in a bath of very hot tap water really helps in keeping the mixture workable. As other reviewers suggested, we used a whole bag of marshmallows and 6 cups of cornflakes. We greased our hands with some non-stick cooking spray, and the green mixture came right off. Shaped the cookies onto parchment paper.

I made these with my 8 year old daughter. My fingers are now green. They look fantastic, taste much better than I expected and will be so much fun for the kids coming over for a dinner party.

I made these for a cookie exchange and they were a huge hit because they are so beautiful. This does require quite a bit of vegetable spray on the wax paper and fingers as your are working so they don't stick. It is a mess to make but worth it. I substituted red M&Ms for the red hots.

This has been a family favorite for over 35 years. My Mother made these when I was younger and I am now making them for my Grandchildren. They are the first cookie to disappear. I agree with the previous post that you should increase the cornflakes to 6 cups. In addition, it is wise to wear plastic gloves unless you like green nails! If you lubricate the gloves with butter, it is much easier to handle the mixture without it sticking. I place them on parchment paper and allow them to dry for a couple days before storing or plating them. When storing, be sure to place parchment between each layer and stack softly...otherwise they will stick!

This is a big hit with kids and adults alike! I use miniature marshmallows . If you use one bag, increase the cornflakes to 6 cups. Don't increase the butter. Makes them nice, crunchy and not overly greasy or sweet! You can also make one big wreath instead of cookie size - super pretty!

I HATE THESE COOKIES. But many of the people to whom I send cookies every year love them so every year I find myself making them while muttering "Why would anyone ever eat this crap." For my brother and my friend Kristina and all the others I will make them again but just don't ask me to eat one.

I love this recipe so much, and I was thrilled to see it here. My sister and I would make these with my mother each year and they were (and are) my absolute favorite. It's really just a slightly varied and glorified rice krispie treat, but it still wins every time.

I made these with my kids (10 and under). They were easy to make but hard to store as they were really soft. I used mini-marshmallows so perhaps that was the problem... Will try again and see if I can get them firmer. They do taste great and we all enjoyed them.
