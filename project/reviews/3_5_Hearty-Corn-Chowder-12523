I made half of this without the bacon for my vegetarian friend-it's not nearly as good. Don't do it. I threw the bacon right in along with everything toward the end. I agree, it needs thickening, without it, it's a watery, bland, bleh.

The taste of this soup always reminds me of our local Farmers Market, its stands filled with 'end of summer' produce... Here is today's version, prompted by a morning trip to the Market: omitted the bacon, and used an olive oil/butter combo to saute the potatoes and leeks; used fresh red chili peppers from the garden instead of the jalapenos; replaced water with chicken stock. The pesto is a must -- freshly made. I have this soup for many years, adjusting the ingredients according to what is available. It is a family favorite.

I found it a little thinner than I expected-- I'll probably do something to thicken it up next time (like cooking a little flour into the onion/potato/grease mixture before adding the liquid). Before the pesto was added, it was a little on the bland side, so whatever you do, don't omit the pesto. Once all is compiled as directed, it is very tasty.

Similar recipe, adapted freely from the great Deborah Madison's Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone: 4 slices of lean bacon (preservative free pork, low sodium) 6 ears of corn 2 large sweet onions finely diced 1 lb. new potatoes, scrubbed but not peeled. 2 red bell peppers, finely diced 1/4 tsp. dried thyme 1 bay leaf 1 quart chicken stock 2-3 T butter 2 cups whole milk Salt & Pepper Pesto (or puree fresh basil with small clove of garlic, pinch of salt & enough olive oil to make a thick paste, 1/2 to 1 t per person) Remove kernels from ears of corn. Break cobs in half and simmer in chicken stock until ready to use broth. Bake bacon slices in preheated oven at 400 degrees, turning them over after 10 minutes to cook for an additional 3-4 minutes. Drain if desired, crumble and reserve. Meanwhile, melt 2 T of butter in large soup pot. Add diced onions, bay leaf and thyme and cook at low heat, slowly, until soft but not colored. (You can replace 1 T of butter with bacon fat if you'd like.) This should take around ten minutes. When onions are almost done, start dicing the potatoes and remove corn cobs from broth. When onions are soft, add potatoes, bacon, stock and about 1 t. of salt to pot. Cover and simmer around 20 mins. until potatoes are tender. Deborah Madison wisely advises cooks to stew peppers in separate pan with remaining butter and a little water. This process preserves their distinct, sweet taste; when using red peppers, it also prevents the color from bleeding into the soup. When potatoes are tender, mash some of them on the bottom of the pot to help thicken the soup. Add corn kernels and milk. Slowly bring to simmer and cook until corn is tender, around 5-8 minutes. Then add red peppers. Divide into six bowls. Stir in pesto or basil if desired. Leftovers are good if reheated carefully to avoid boiling.

I used leftover corn that was roasted on the grill. It really gave a great flavor to the soup. The pistou really makes the dish.

This is a great soup. I cut the jalapeno and am sorry. It also could use a little onion with the leek. I substituted red pepper pesto for the basil and it was just as good.

Time consuming to make but well worth the effort

I agree with the other reviewer that one jalapeno was enough. I foolishly did not take the advice about rubber gloves--ouch! Anyhow, the soup was very tasty, especially with fresh corn from a farmer's market.

I only used 1 jalepeno and found it to be spicey enough. I also did not use bacon I used 2 tbls. butter and 1 chopped scallone and 2 tbls. chicken stock. One more thing is I pureed 3 cups instead of 2 . Bon Apetite it's a wonderful summer dish
