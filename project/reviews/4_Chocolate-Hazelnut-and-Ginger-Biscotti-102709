These biscotti taste great! The only problem is the recipe is a bit off. I only got 24 cookies, not 48, so to make it for the holidays I would recommend doubling it. It might take longer than 15 minutes for yours to cool. Mine took about 25 minutes to cool. When I cut into it after 15 minutes the first few pieces fell apart.

Awesome!! This is the best biscotti. i used those double chocolte chips in it and it was so good. No need to change anything.

These are easy to make and taste great. The dough tends to be really thick. I have made it with hazelnuts and almonds and like it both ways. I highly recommend this recipe.

Outstanding flavor combination. Every time I make these, people beg for the recipe. One warning: At least in my inexpert hands, the white chocolate can be a bit thick and temperamental, making it tricky to artfully splatter the finished biscotti without creating a huge mess. A couple of years ago I just gave up and put a lot of newspaper down on the counter and told everyone to stand back. They're always very pretty when all the white chocolate flinging is over, so don't give up!

...a suggestion for dealing with the sticky dough...sprinkle cocoa powder on counter and on hands, scrape dough onto counter, grab dough and turn over a few times to coat with cocoa. It is much easier to gather and divide in two and the cocoa does not change the look of your finished biscotti.

Have been making this for 5 years now; it's become my favorite gift goodie. I doubled the recipe this year, still worked perfectly though it was almost spilling out of my mixer. If you double, no need for the 8th egg; 1 is still enough for brushing the tops. Love it, don't change a thing. Try wet hands to shape the logs.

These are delicious - I found the dough too sticky to handle and had to refrigerate it overnight to get it to a manageable firmness but it was worth it! I had really great ginger and used toasted almonds rather than hazelnuts. I will make these again (and again).

Very good. Did not use white chocolate and substituted 4 squares of bakers semisweet chocolate ( chopped ) for the chippits.... One trick I always do is to oil my hands with vegetable oil before shaping the logs...Works every time!

This was my first time making biscotti, and I love this recipe. I think that those reviews who had runny batter added all 4 eggs to the batter. Only 3 eggs go in the batter, the 4th is for brushing over the top (a must to have a nice, shiny finish). I would definately make this again.

The ginger adds a nice complexity to the cookie. I leave out the white chocolate; it's not really needed. I'm not sure why people had problems with the dough being runny. Mine came out PERFECT! I've made these for the holidays 2 years in a row and get compliments each time. This is definitely a keeper.

These were good. The dough was stiff and sticky, but manageable. I had never used crystalized ginger before, but I thought it was great in combination with the chocolate. I, too, put the white chocolate in a ziplock, to good effect, but it doesn't appear to be setting. It's only been an hour, so hopefully, it will firm up.

This was a very easy recipe and turned out exceptionally well. I thought the ginger would be overwhelming, but it was just right. I will definitely make again.

have not made these yet, but will...the secret to handling the dough is to refrigerate it for a while and it will firm up...then you can shape with no sweat

I had the hardest time with this dough. Then I compared it to other biscotti recipes and noticed what a difference there was in the egg to flour ratio. I poured out what was more like a wet brownie batter on my floured work surface then attempted to shape it into logs with floured hands. What a joke. At one point I almost just tried to scoop it up to throw it away. But not to waste the price of the ingredients, I scooped it back into the bowl added more flour then gopped spoonfuls onto the cookie sheet and baked it. Forget "shaping" it into a log. They came out okay, but not the shape they should be. Everytime I tried to pat it down it stuck to my hands. Never again! I've made biscotti once in the past and don't remember having this problem.

Rating: 3
Very good as is. The ginger flavor was subtle but added depth to the flavor. Thought the dough was a little hard to mix!

Rating: 4
Very good recipe....got rave reviews at work. Also very versatile when using as a base recipe for chocolate biscotti! I have made this with and without the ginger, prefer without more. Have made it with walnuts, toasted almonds, macadamias, and hazelnuts. All were good. I usually make some with no drizzle, some with chocolate, some with white chocolate, and some with both drizzles. The lack of butter is also nice, for the lower cals without sacrificing any taste (imho).

Rating: 3
Very good. The flavour combo is delicious, and these were a huge hit at several parties. Also nice how little fat they contain. A trick that eases some of the mess with white chocolate: just put white chocolate chunks/chips on top of cookies when they come out of the oven. Let them sit for a few minutes, then run a knife across the melted chocolate for instant frosting. Pop in freezer for a few minutes before packaging up. I'll definitely make these again

Rating: 3
At first I was worried about these because the dough was so runny, but they ended up coming out just fine. I kept the ginger in chunks about the same size as chocolate chips. These are good and I will make them again.

Rating: 4
These were fantastic! I didn't bother with the white chocolate and substituted pistachios for the hazelnuts. My husband, a diehard biscotti fan, raved about them. Next time, rather than struggle with the wet gloppy dough on the floured surface, I think I will just spoon the batter onto the parchment paper and shape from there.

I made five biscotti recipes for gifts (anise, neopolitan, chocolate walnut, lemon pistachio cranberry, and these. I found the anise and the neopolitan recipes more classic and versatile, while the ginger and chocolate combination was nice for the sake of variety. I would probably leave the ginger in larger chunks next time so you can see them and get more concentrated flavor in some bites. These did not crisp up as well as my other biscotti recipes for some reason. The white cholocate is good for looks, but it adds no taste and is messy for packaaging gifts, so I'd feel free to skip it.

Rating: 4
My absolute favorite biscotti recipe, and my most requested. I'm a huge ginger fan, so that would follow, but the combination with the chocolate and hazelnuts is just incredible. These have to be hidden in my house, as spouse will eat them all before I have a chance to package them to give.

Dry dough which miraculously comes together when you get your hands into it. Always got raving reviews with these biscotti.

Rating: 3
I'd royally messed up another biscotti recipe, and ran out of butter, so I thought I'd try this since there isn't any butter required. The texture is perfect! They were easier to slice than the other recipe I tried, as well. I added a bit of cinnamon and other spices, and dried cranberries and pistachios, for a Christmas theme. The flavor isn't as deeply chocolatey as I would have liked, and next time I would stubstitute some brown sugar for the white: it's a bit flat-flavored. And I'm glad I read the reviews and others said it was a sticky mess but worked out anyway, as I was VERY concerned after the mixing (and initially leaving out the cocoa powder) -- it was the consistency of sticky frosting! Forget rolling it out into a rope; I just divvied it up into two rough rows on my baking sheet, shaped into rows with wet fingers. QUESTION -- next time I'd like to leave out the cocoa powder; when I first tried this, the batter was even thinner. What would you substitute? Just more flour? In the same amount? Cornstarch?

I made this exactly as written and it turned out beautifully. I had no problem with sticky dough; I wonder if previous reviewers added the 4th egg to the dough rather than using it as a glaze? Anyway, everything positive said before, I second.

I have made this recipe several times. The latest was for my future daughter in law's shower, because it was specifically requested by her mother. The trick to keep them from crumbling is to undercook them by about five minutes for the first bake. They will be softer and easier to cut.

By far, not the best biscotti I have made. I was intrigued by the chocolate and ginger combination, but now that I have tasted it, I just don't think it works. I would not make this again.

I have been making these biscotti every holiday since the Bon Appetit issue came out in 12/99 (it's still on my bookshelf). I tried one year to make another variety, but was met with lots of dismay from my husband...the ultimate cookie connoisseur. In an effort to keep my home a happy one, I will continue to make them for many years to come!! :o) They are truly wonderful and a superior gift! Bon Appetit!

I read all the rave reviews and thought "come on, it's just a cookie!" but they are worth every bit of praise. And I can't believe how low fat they are, too. A couple of notes - I didn't have enough crystallized ginger, so I added some fresh to make up the difference. I also forgot the egg wash - I don't even notice it's missing. For the reviewer who said it reminded her of hazelnut coffee - next time, I am going to use chopped up choc. cov'd espresso beans in place of the choc. chips (and skip the ginger). Also - don't bother husking the hazelnuts, they are fine as is.

This is a wonderful biscotti recipe! I agree with the other reviewers that the consistency is perfect if you like to dip it in coffee or just eat plain! I gave this as a thank you to a host and she loved it! A year later, people are still talking about it.

I was a little worried about how the dough looked before cooking it. It was quite sticky and gooey, but nonetheless the biscotti where excellent. I did not use any ginger as my husband does not care for it and it was still wonderful. Don't skip the step of using the white chocolate. I used regular white chocolate chips and melted them down in the mircrowave and then transferred into a ziplock bag to make the zipzags. Everyone asks for more.

First time with biscotti. Very easy to make. Did not use the white chocolate because of milk sensitivity. Next time I think I will try a dark chocolate drizzle.

These have become my signature biscotti--they not only LOOK gorgeous, but they taste marvelous! They're a perfect consistency. You can dunk them in coffee and they don't fall apart, but they aren't so hard that you'll break your teeth on them. Follow the advice of another person on this site and put the white chocolate in a plastic baggie with a pin hole in it to drizzle. And you really only need half the white chocolate the recipe calls for. These biscotti are absolutely fabulous!

Rating: 4
As a beginner in making biscotti, I'm lucky to realize 'this is it'! These biscotti are crunchy but not hard; just right in sweetness; best dunked, but already heavenly by itself; keep well, but don't worry about this as they're too good to last anyway! If you're nuts about nuts like I do, consider doubling the hazelnuts. Just don't be deterred when the dough comes out gooey, which many of the previous reviewers already mentioned, just follow the instructions faithfully for the perfect biscotti.

I can't stop eating this. I had very low expectations because it was a big sticky mess upon going into the oven (I hadn't read any comments), but it turned out perfect. This is my first experience w/ crystallized ginger and I really like it. It gives the biscotti a different twist, a little kick aside from the chocolate. Also used slivered almonds, as I had no hazelnuts. I plan to give it as gifts if it makes it into the bags...

Great recipe and terrific for gifts. For the icing, I melted the chocolate in a glass measuring cup in the microwave and then poured it into a plastic bag with a hole snipped in the corner. It worked well.

Rating: 0
Just a suggestion on drizzling the chocolate. When you have it melted pour it in a ziplock type bag. Put a small hole in the corner and drizzle away - this works much better because of the consistance of the drizzle line.

These biscotti are "to die for"! My husband said they were the best that I had ever made and my friend said I could sell them to a gourmet shop. I like my biscotti hard (for dunking in coffee), and these were hard. They were also delicious. The only changes I made to the recipe were to leave out the ginger and the white chocolate topping. They were devine without them.

Rating: 3
They were delicious!!! I only had a little problem with the white chocolate. Once I melted the chocolate, I tried to drizzle it but it was getting lumpy really quickly. I ended up covering only 1/3 of the cookies. They are still very good without the white chocolate. Does any one have a trick on how to drizzle the chocolate?

These have such a different, wonderful taste. I'm still trying to perfect drizzling the white chocolate though. I usually end up using twice as much and dipping have the cookie halfway into it. The still look and taste great!

So...the recipe ingredients appealed to me and the reviews were great. BUT the biscotti were just okay. I had no problem with soft dough, but simply did not love the biscotti. My husband was even surprised to learn ginger was and ingredient - he couldn't taste it. Not worth the trouble of toasting and husking the hazelnuts. Try the Cranberry and Chocolate Chip Biscotti at Cooking Light!

I have many biscotti recipes and have found that the best usually use some butter. I made these for a friend who is on a strict diet because of chol. so I left out the choc. chips, used 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts instead of hazelnuts, no ginger and no white choc. THEY WERE DELICIOUS. Great choc. flavor and good texture which I think is hard to find in a virtually no-fat biscotti. Good tips from other readers helped: spoon onto tray and form with wet hands, flatten well because they rise more than you expect.

Absolutely wonderful! I've had to make three batches to keep up with the requests. :-) I now hand out the recipe with the biscotti. I followed the directions, omitting nothing, adding nothing. It was even better than I anticipated. Dough is very gooey. I took a tip from another biscotti reviewer and spooned the dough onto the baking sheet. I worked with moist figures to mold. Excellent!

Rating: 3
This was great. My dough came out very gooey, but I used a previous reviewer's advice and just spooned the dough onto the parchment and went on as usual. They came out great. I think that the white choc is a bit over the top, and only did it to some of them. Next time I think I'll add some instant espresso also.

I picked this recipe for my husband to try since he's the chocolate-lover in the house. He followed it exactly, and it turned out absolutely delicious! We offered it along with other Italian treats at a multi-cultural Christmas fair, and came home with crumbs! The blend of chocolate, hazelnuts, and ginger is just right. It reminds me of the smell of hazelnut coffee without the coffee taste.

I really enjoyed this biscotti. The only change I made was using almonds instead of hazelnuts. Next time I will omit the ginger. I don't care for it. But the chocolate flavor is great and the crunch was great. I melted Nestle white chocolate in the microwave for the drizzle and had NO problem. I got two gift packages out of it and still had plenty left for our house.

These were a treat for the eye and the mouth - delicious and beautiful - the chocolate ginger combo is really yummy! I used white chocolate chips & as someone else stated melting the white chips was the hardest part - I went thru a whole bag before I got it right (melt on a low heat, "defrost" even, on your microwave and stop just when the chips are starting to loose shape) but once they were decorated looked great - I gave many out as gifts & people thought I had bought them at a bakery!

I made these for Christmas, and they were a huge hit. I don't like white chocolate, so I didn't bother with it. I also found the dough too sticky ti work with, but I used a technique from another biscotti recipe: just spoon the dough onto the baking sheet in roughly the right size, then use moistened fingers to shape it into a neat log. Works great. I also save time and space by standing the biscotti upright for the second baking, which also works great.

An excellent recipe for biscotti! The addition of chocolate chips to the chocolate dough resulted in a rich chocolate taste. The crystallized ginger was a great complement to the chocolate, and the toasted hazelnuts added both flavor and crunch. I had trouble with drizzling the white chocolate until I put it in a frosting gun -- that allowed control over the molten chocolate such that the biscotti turned out as beautiful as the picture in Bon Appetit! P.S. My husband loved these so much that we packed the extra's in a cookie tin and took them to the ski slopes. They were great with espresso, and the kids loved them with hot chocolate!
