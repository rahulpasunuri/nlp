I cut recipe in 1/2 to make one srvg, and absolutely could not finish all of it--it is so rich! Definitely serves 4, not 2. It is less like a cereal than a stiff, thick batter. All the fruit gives it a very rich taste--I would cut back on the amt of fruit next time, though the large number of nuts is great. Didn't taste the lemon juice. I will probably experiment some more with this very filling recipe.

Very Good. Took a little time to prepare, a bit too much lemon juice for my taste, but I enjoyed it!!!
