Very yummy and very messy! A great summer recipie for fresh corn and garden tomatoes. I used pork loin instead of shoulder and simmered for an hour and 45 min. Also added sour cream.

the preparation was painstaking, even though I cheated with the corn (zapped 2 cups frozen niblets with microwaves), but end result was pleasing, and the kids ate it (sans salsa!). great way to prepare fatty pork, but not for a quick snack!
