This was good. I made it as part of the overall dinner featuring the lemon vinaigrette, which I'd made before. The dish was pleasant and went well with the chicken. We love the chicken, and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in the asparagus recipe!

Took the advice of the cook from Westlake Village and added a bit of garlic and dijon mustard. We enjoyed it as a side dish with a chicken and pasta dish.

What a lovely, delicate flavor. This is a bad time of year for asparagus but it was wonderful nonetheless. Served it with Pecan Crusted chicken breast with Banana Salsa, Orzo with onions and parmesan cheese, and finished the meal with Mango Upside Down Cake. Rated the whole meal a 5.

This recipe could not have been easier and was delicious...what more do people want out of dinner? Certainly, that's enough for me! Four forks!!

What mixed reviews! My husband and I really liked this simple twist on asparagus. I halved the vinaigrette recipe and added 1/2 tsp. of dijon mustard and a large clove of minced garlic. The flavor is subtle and light.

Very disappointing. Will not try this one again. I usually enjoy lemon in receipes but it was overkill in this one.

I was very impressed, as were my guests. I'm not usually a great fan of lemon, but this dish was quite good and easy to make.

TO MS. JONES FROM FL. - If you believe asparagus should be enjoyed for it's own flavor, why would you even try this recipe and then turn around and disparage it? Really quite unfair........

Asparagus should be enjoyed fof it's own taste! I thought the lemon vinaigrette was terrible..

Simple, subtle, and a great elegant side for a complex entree! Terrific!

The vinaigrette is great over salad too. I added a bit of white pepper also. Peeling the asparagus stalks made them more tender and added a special touch - not too time consuming and worth the effort- just use a regular peeler

I'm not one to put much on my vegetables as I think they are best in their natural state, but as I was making the chicken with capers from the same Gourmet issue, and made the vinaigrette anyway, I decided to use it. And I loved it. Will definitely do it again. Husband raved.
