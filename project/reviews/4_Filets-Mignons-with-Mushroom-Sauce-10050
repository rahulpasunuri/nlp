Deliciious! Made this along with your recipe for Spinach Puffs for our Valentine's Day dinner. It was better than restaurant quality!! Plus I much prefer to eat in on Valentine's Day so this fit the bill perfectly!!

Hands down one of the best recipes I have ever prepared or eaten! My friends raved about it. I substituted an oven roasted whole fillet for the individual cuts and it was beyond delicious! BTW, I used the Epicurious iPhone app to find & shop for the recipe - amazing application you should dowload now!!!

Instead of bacon, I sauteed shallots. I also used some Jack Daniels we had on hand. Great recipe. It's a keeper!

This was an incredibly flavorful sauce! I tripled the recipe because I was making a meal for six and it still turned out well. The entire meal took much longer than the estimated 45 minutes -- give yourself more than an hour. It is true that the recipe does not make a load of sauce, but to us it did not matter because the meat was so tasty and the sauce added to the flavor without overpowering it. Will definitely make this again for a special meal.

This has become a favorite in our house that I make on a regular basis. On my first attempt, I had no brandy and tried some Jim Beam that I had around. It was outstanding, and I've made it that ever since. I typically double or even triple the liquid ingredients because the sauce is so good. We like having enough to mop up with some bread.

Don't know why some people are complaining about a lack of "sauce". If you read the recipe correctly you can tell that it has very little liquid left after cooking. Recipe is perfect as is with incredible flavors. Top restaurant quality recipe. Only change would be to double the amount of ingredients for proper proportion of filet to sauce. This is a recipe for REAL foodies.

Thanks for the advice about making twice the amount of sauce/mushrooms, it ended up being the perfect amount! I didn't have any cognac or butter on hand and just used what I had available (olive oil and dry sherry). End result was a sauce with incredible flavor and went really well with the filet, this is one dish I'll be making over and over again.

Whole family thought this was awesome! Did substitute a stir-fry mushroom medley and red wine since that's what we had on hand.

A fabulous and very simple recipe. Must be a cultural thing that so many US cooks complained of lack of "sauce". We didn't mind. The mushrooms were so flavorful and a quality piece of meat doesn't need to be drowned in sauce.

I am still giving this a 4 rating although I made the sauce without the filet mignon (what could go wrong with cooking a filet mignon). I was only looking for a mushroom sauce. This was fabulous and I can imagine how this would taste on the filet mignon.

Clearly not enough sauce as was mentioned in previous reviews. Nothing special about this recipe. One of the very few disappointments after trying a great many epicurious recipes. There are many other excellent beef recipes available.

We really enjoyed this dish, although we agree with other reviewers: not enough sauce. We created more by adding some red wine (instead of Cognac) & a little more Worcestershire sauce, plus plenty of garlic. We also took the suggestion of serving with garlic mashed potatoes. The mushroom sauce was excellent with the potatoes too!

I really liked the Mushroom sauce, I did make a few changes though. I used 3 slices of bacon, 1/4 cup of Cognac. Instead of water I used 1/4 cup of white wine, a fine Chardonnay, Mendoza of Argentina. Also Itailian parsley. I also used 3 green onions. Reduced til the liquid was of a gravy like. It was great. I'll use this for a lot of other dishes that go well with mushrooms.

I also found the recipe lacking "sauce". It was a good mix of ingredients though, so next time I will add some chicken or beef broth to deglaze the after the mushrooms. My filets were such good quality that the sauce was just a side note.

I liked this recipe and will definately make it again. While I was sauteing the mushrooms I also added about three tablespoons of chopped green onion. I also made five pieces of bacon and then used the extra to mix with some of the mushroom sauce that I then put over top of the garlic mashed potatoes that I served with the filet. Delicious!

After steaks are cooked, deglaze the skillet with a little chicken broth. Then swirl in a little butter. After butter is incorporated, add reserved mushrooms to reheat before pouring over steak. There will be plenty of delicious sauce.

Not enough suace. I would say this was just average

Super simple and delicious. Didn't have a problem with sauciness of the sauce, but sauteeing in butter kept the filets super moist anyway. One thing: don't try to cheap out on the cognac like I did -- a flask of Hennessy just doesn't cut it ;)

I liked the sauce, but agree with previous cook that it needs broth. The mushrooms had a great flavor, but it wasn't much of a sauce, just flavored mushrooms on a NY steak.

The mushroom mixture was delicious but it wasn't saucy enough to accompany the meat. I would add a little broth to the mixture and reduce it down to make a thicker sauce.

To the cook from Baldwin, NY, in my house you committed a mortal sin for the dastardly act of cooking filets mignons med. well. I, of course cooked them rare and the sauce complamented the tender filets and aroused my taste buds.

The mushrooms are to die for!! I sub. "Hormel REAL bacon bits"(reduced fat) for the bacon step. Works great! Took longer to cook meat because We like it med. well. I will definitely make this many more times.
