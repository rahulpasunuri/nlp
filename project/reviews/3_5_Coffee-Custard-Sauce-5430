This was SUPER sweet. I am going to serve it with the lava cakes later, so perhaps it will be an appropriate counterpoint to the bittersweet chocolate, but if I were to make it again, I would cut back on the amount of sugar

This was one of the most delicious and versatile desserts I have ever made. I followed the directions as written, and it came out as San Mateo indicated below, although it is decidedly not a liquid. The liquidity will vary depending on what sort of cream is used, but it will generally be very thick. It's very much a custard. It tastes wonderful with the lava cake, but it's also good on pancakes and with puff pastries.

I followed this recipe exactly as written and it tasted delicious-it really did. What I didn't like was the consistancy of the sauce. It was too thick, so maybe I did something wrong. It was not like a sauce, more like a cream. But it did taste wonderful. If I had been thinking, I could have thinned it out a little, but I was under pressure at my dinner party, and just plopped a spoonful of the sauce on the plate beside the lave cake. It was good with the chocolate cake. My guests loved it, but the presentation I did lacked luster.

This dish was scrumptious. Warning-very rich. Instead of the coffee sauce, i put ice cream on top and it tasted delicious.

Amazing when paired with the Chocolate Lava Cakes!

Sure WISH I could rave like two previous reviewers for I love custard and love coffee and thought the combination would be terrific. I found the texture/weight of whipping so much air into the yolks/sugar offputting. I'll try again but using more typical technique.

Oh, my! This is very good! I made it to served with the do-ahead chocolate lava cake recipe. It was DELICIOUS. My guests asked for seconds ... I think the recipe makes 6 generous portions, but then I ate some while I was preparing it. I think it would go well with anything chocolate, and orange, too.

Alone, it's yummy. But when paired with the Chocolate Lava Cakes, this sauce got raves. FYI, it's a sweet, light-brown, coffee-flavored liquid with dark brown specks of ground coffee beans. It serves way more than 4... more like 24!
