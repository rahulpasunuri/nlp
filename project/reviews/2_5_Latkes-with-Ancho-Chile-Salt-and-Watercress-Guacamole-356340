I was pleased with what the cornmeal did for this and think I might bump up the amount next time. I also used about 1/3 turnips because I had them. I think this gave it a lighter and sweeter flavor which was quite nice. 2 eggs, because the turnips didn't have the same moisture content as potatoes.

I added the ancho salt to the batter and then fried the latkes. They were delicious and a hit.The masa added a nice dimension to the flavor.I served with traditional apple sauce.

Because I live close to the Mexican border, masa is a frequently used ingredient in my neighborhood, so I found the idea more intriguing than some reviewers. Since I also lived in Minneapolis for five years, Latkes are a long time holiday favorite and I was in the mood. There are two parts to this recipe, the latke mix and the guacamole; so I'll deal with them separately. The corn masa in the latke is unnoticeable. If you don't sprinkle the ancho chile salt on top, it's not that different from your basic latke. In the future, to punch up the 'south of the border' vibe, I will actually add a teaspoon of the ancho chile into the latke mix itself, and add a couple more tablespoons of the masa. That allows people to salt or not as they prefer. I did take one idea from Joyce777 and made a spicy applesauce topping with cinnamon and ground ancho chile, as well as a dilled creme fraiche with a touch of horseradish. (for those of you who aren't familiar with creme fraiche I warn you not to try it... it's addictive) Both went over well. I'd recommend making the guacamole with the watercress in a food processor, and go light on the lime. It's very fresh and rather an interesting departure from more traditional guacamoles. As a sauce for the latke, it ranked 3rd and I wouldn't use it in the future with this dish. Aside from those minor tweaks, this is a fun recipe, easy to prepare, and well received at my dinner party. I will most definitely be making it again!

A rose is a rose by any other name people. Potatoes, egg, seasonings, etc. all go into potato pancakes, latkes, or rosti. Food items cross cultural barriers because they are good tasting, plentiful, available, whatever. I have a problem with reviewers who don't even try to make the recipe before giving it a low rating. At least cook the dish first. These cakes are tasty.

Creme fraiche is used in Mexico for toppings, not sour cream. It is a legacy from the time when the French occupied Mexico. It is available at stores that carry Mexican products and in many supermarkets. We use it all the time, Buen Provecho!

Not exactly mama's latkes. This sounds like something you might find on "Chopped" on the Food Network.All it needs is chinese 5-spice. Creme fraiche? Some day I'll try making it but I'll stick wth nasty old sour cream until then. Anyone brave out there? It sounds weirdly fascinating.

I am considering trying this recipe for my gluten intolerant son-in-law. The masa sounds like a great substitute for flour or matzo meal more traditionally used in latkes. I have no problem with the idea of borrowing from other cultures and I thought I was a food snob. I guess I'm not. The question is, "How does this taste?"

Did anyone actually make this dish? krosswaugh, it sounds like maybe you did? I'd like to know if it's as bad as everyone thinks it sounds. Thanks.

I my thirty-five years a Mexican chef I have never seen such a horror as today's mess. That woman should never be allowed into a kitchen. What editor approved these recipes? You managed to insult two cuisines in one go. If you can't be the best, sit down and let one of us take over.

Joice7777, what if we change the title and call it: Mexican potato pancakes with Guacamole; or South-Western Potato Pancakes. I did not try the recipe, therefore can't rate it but your idea with orange calvados sounds great.

The "Cook from Houston" knows whereof em speaks. As soon as I saw the words "Latkes" and "guacamole" in the same sentence, I knew there was a problem. This is emblematic of all I hate about foody-ism for the sake of foody-ism, and is the reason I have sent dishes back in upscale restaurants. In order to tap into a tradition, it is necessary to understand when one is going too far, and is losing the link to the tradition. If you want a variation on this traditional theme, how about Blue potato latkes with herbed creme fraiche, and orange-calvados applesauce?
