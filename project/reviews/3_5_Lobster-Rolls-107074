Delicious!! Added dill and used homemade mayonnaise (from Epicurious site).

Simple and delicious. I followed others and used a tiny bit of tarragon and a dash of Old Bay and cheapo hot dog rolls from Stop and Shop. Used a 1/2 of a single Boston Lettuce leaf which I did not slice. I made it just for myself and now I have leftovers for tomorrow, yum !

Have been to Maine many times and was looking for the real deal and found it in this recipe. Huge hit! Key was using homemade mayonnaise for very little extra effort. Did not have the Maine type buns readily available so bought deli hoagie rolls, cut them to match Maine type and they worked great. Be careful not to cut too deep though or they break apart when grilling. Did not vary the recipe at all; thought about adding a little tarragon but everyone thought it might make it too rich. By having grocer do the steaming before taking them home really makes this very easy. Will definitely make again just as written.

A good standard version. I've been traveling for years along the Maine coast and think I know my LR's pretty well (Red's Eat's anyone?). Right now I'm stuck on the left coast where lob's are expensive ($25/lb in the East Bay) and you can't get classic New England top split hot dog rolls. But you make due when the fix calls. So I butter the top and bottom of side split rolesand toast 'em up, grit your teeth and pay $75 for two pound and a halfers, butter poach the lobsters, make a homemade mayo with a dash of tarragon and about half a lemon's worth of zest, pack the rolls and a bottle of wine and head to a picnic table by the sea. Somethings you have to different out left, but you can still scratch the itch.

Just a note to those who are not familiar with New England style hot dog rolls, they are quite different from what we have here on the west coast. When I order lobster to be shipped from Maine, I always order buns as well because it's absolutely necessary to have the authentic New England style buns that you butter and heat on each side. I think this is a great basic recipe that you can change up if you like by adding a little celery salt or use cole slaw instead of bibb lettuce. Wonderful!

I grew up and still live on Cape Ann - this is what a lobster roll is - heavy on the freshest just-cooked lobster meat, light on the best mayo you can find, a little bit of bibb lettuce at the bottom, all in a buttered, grilled hot dog roll. Doesn't need anything else - all you want is the pure fresh taste of a day at the beach.

I think the only way to improve on this recipe is to add a little chives as someone suggested and to use garlic butter to toast the rolls. I'd go lighter on the mayo. Pearls in NYC charges over $20 for these so I'd say making your own will save you a little money and taste just as good.

Word to the wise, there are as many lobster roll recipes as there are lobsters. You can use any mayo or salad dressing, onions or not, celery or not, iceberg or butter lettuce..or not, these silly little hotdog buns that are so popular out here or french bread. I love that this is so simple and so good! Enjoy!!

Some times the best food is just the simple combination of great ingredients, just like in this recipe. Anyone who would recommend Miracle Whip shouldn't be making lobster rolls in the first place

Rating: 3
I think those of us who appreciate this simple, and to some, unorthodox recipe but to me, it's comfort food that brings back memories of summer vacations by the ocean (Atlantic - Maine, New Brunswick or Nova Scotia). Sure there are a lot of other things you can do with this pricey seafood but sometimes you just need to venture outside the box. And why not add some celery and lettuce? Oh, and the best lobster rolls can usually be found in one of those little seaside greasy spoons.

Disagree with comment from Hampden Maine. A true Lobster Roll DOES include a small strip of lettuce in the bottom of the hot dog roll. This recipe is the perfect one for Lobster Rolls. I have made hundreds. Nothing else required.

Rating: 2
A true lobster roll does not have any lettuce or celery in it. That is just filler that reduces the amount of lobster meat a restaurant has to use. A real roll only uses lobster meat preferably mixed with Miracle Whip Salad Dressing which has more flavor than Mayo. Also, you can pack the lobster mixture in a hamburg roll and grill it on both sides like a Panini. Delicious!!

This is as authentic as you can get. The only improvement you could make is to use home-made mayo. I've eaten this classic sandwich since I was a kid living on the coast of Maine. This is a perfect use for all the little bits of meat you can get from the leftover lobster bodies that no one else knows how to use, as well. I like one commenter's suggestion of some chives added to the mix. I think I like lobster rolls even better than just dipping plain lobster in butter.

If you silly enough to think this is a recipe you may not know that it is advisable to shell the lobster before attempting this dish. I'm from Boston and this recipe is totally BIZARRE! I am so embarrassed that a chef would even post this!

To the cook from Chicago - I make my own mayonnaise using the Joy of Cooking recipe. Using a food processor it takes literally 10 seconds. It's a far better flavor than the jarred stuff, and whatever you have left over, use to make an aoli!

Not really a review but a question. I really don't like mayonnaise. OK to use Miracle Whip?

great, traditional lobster roll. It is meant to be this simple and certainly not a waste of this delicious meat. About the hot dog roll; well it is a must as other rolls can be too bready and the slight sweetness of the traditional hot dog bun is the perfect compliment to the lobster flavor. NH seacoaster.

At the risk of angering those hardcore NewEnglanders out there, I have to say that I can find better uses for my lobster meat. By the time you throw all the other ingredients in and stuff it in a bun, you might as well just go ahead and use that awful imitation Krab meat. That said, I will admit that I love lobster rolls - a must have when in Maine, etc. But, like beignets in New Orleans, I want someone to make them for me. It makes it an experience, rather than just a meal.

Lobster was traditionally known as a poor man's fish/shellfish because lobsters were "bottom feeders" and the rich couldn't be bothered with all the work it took to get the meat out of the bodies, amoung other reasons. So the idea of pairing the lobster meat with mayonaise and hotdog buns is not so ludicrous - easy to make and easy to eat without having to sit down. I prefer lobster salad made from the meat of tender hidden meat in the "raggy bodies" like my grandmother in ME used to make - nothing was wasted - with a little lemon, fresh chives and a touch of fresh taragon. When eating live lobster, spoon the row and tamale into the leftover melted butter (adding garlic is good too) and spread on bread and broil to make a lovely toast appetizers the next day.

Heck yes, I would make this again! What in the Sam Hill is wrong with hot-dog buns? Even in Michigan, where lobsters fear to tread, we cram these bad boys into our mouths and line up for seconds--at least at my house. And with the leftover buns, I plan to make Sloppy Joes and beanie-weenies.

This was truly an authentic recipe, would definitely make it again. For those of you that turn your nose up at the thought of a hot-dog bun. Well, just think. If you're spending $$$ on getting lobster, you surely want a bread that is one step above plain, so as not to interfere with the delicate flavour of the lobster.

Heaven on a plate. This is hands-down my favoite food, although I am highly unorthodox and like to add a little chopped celery (shudder) to the lobster salad.

While these are served as a cold salad or room temperature, if possible you want to mix the lobster meat with the mayo while it's still warm. New England style buns are the ones split on the top rather on the side...but either tastes great! And - IMHO - lettuce is an extra for true homestyle!

Elizabeth - the lobster should not be hot; the filling is a cold salad, like seafood or chicken salad. New England-style hot dog rolls have to be pulled apart when you take them out of the package. That means on the sides they look like sliced bread instead of having a crust all around. That's best for lobster rolls because they toast nicer. Hope that helps. (If someone has a better explanation - please share!)

Two questions for the New Englanders/traditional lobster roll enthusiasts: Is the lobster meat served hot, chilled, or somewhere in between? (The recipe does not specify). And, what is a "New England style" hot dog roll? Many thanks from a Florida girl.

My family has been making lobster rolls in this manner for the past 40 years. There's no way to improve this recipe--just be sure to use fresh lobster meat, real mayonnaise, and New England style hot dog rolls.

There is nothing better than a lobster roll. I think they serve them in heaven (or valhalla or whatever you want to call it). A hot dog bun is a crucial element of a true lobster roll. I'm sorry for anyone who turned their nose up at this!

This recipe was delicious. I ordered the top loading buns from a place in Maine. They were inexpensive and arrived in a couple of days. I felt like I was actually eating them in Maine. Fresh lobster and the top loading buns the only way to go!

To the cook in Portland Oregon, shame on you! First of all, you obviously haven't tried this recipe, or you never would have given it only one star. I can understand your confusion at first, because it does seem that a lowly hot dog roll should not be paired with a lobster. But, sometimes the simple things are best, and it just doesn't get any better than this. The key is fresh lobster (which you may never have had, living in Portland...) just enough mayo to coat the meat, and the key is a well buttered, and preferably grilled hotdog bun. A squeeze of lemon juice, and there is just nothing better. A lobster roll must be made with fresh lobster though....us new englanders can taste the difference!

I first had this wonderful dish 10 years ago, when my husband & I honeymooned in Nova Scotia. It is a decadent treat. To Portland: Yes, hotdog buns. Try serving marinated & sliced flank steak in them. You'll not sneer...

Tasted good, I figured due to the lobster. Basically it was like a chicken salad. I mean it was good but was not worth the money the lobster cost.

Hey Portland Oregon, this is how we do lobster rolls in Portland Maine! People line up here in the summer time at the little clam shacks along the coast to sample this treat! Nothing fancy, down to earth and simple.Don't knock it 'till you've tried it!They are yummy. I have been making lobster rolls like this for years at least 1 time a month served with homemade fish or clam chowder, (New England style of course!)Great quick meal.

I prefer mine without the Mayo - the lobster doesn't need it! (give me drawn butter!) Billy's Chowder House is a great place to eat - the Lobster is excellent and the prices are reasonable. It's a must-do visit when in Wells.

Delicious. The best way to have cold lobster, just like in Maine ... nothing fancy added. The toasted hotdog rolls are just right with the rich lobster.
