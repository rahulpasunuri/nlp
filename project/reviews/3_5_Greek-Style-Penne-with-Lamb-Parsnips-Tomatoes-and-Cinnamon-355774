This was a hit with my parsnip suspicious partner. Next time I may add spinach at the end just to add some greenery. Also red pepper flakes to add some otherwise missing spice. But the lamb/cinnamon/parsnip combo was very fragrant and comforting.

Meh. I thought this was... bland really. Combination of lamb and cinnamon is nice and combine well with the tomatoes but the parsnips did nothing for this recipe at all. I love parsnips, but this recipe doesn't do them justice.

Loved this, and my boyfriend was impressed, too. It wasn't difficult to make, but it did take kind of a long time to prep everything (especially the parsnips). However, we had leftovers, so the amount of work was worth it. This is a big yummy weeknight-y recipe -- satisfying and homey.

I'm a parsnip kinda girl, but this was positively odd. Perhaps dicing the parsnips would help as the slices were the wrong size with the penne. My family ate around the parsnips and lamb and I'm having to dump a big pot of leftovers into the disposal today. :(

Tasty dish - season carefully though to bring out the flavours. I added a stock cube, a bay leaf and a swig of sherry (making it a bit more like a tagine)- lovely.

I thought it to be a terrible combination of flavors that resulted in an overall horrible dining experience. Maybe it just wasn't our taste, but we do generally enjoy a diverse menu. Did not care for it!

I was afraid of the parsnips ruining this dish, but it turned out excellent. Added a few sliced kalamata olives on top along the feta when I served it. Delish!

First time I eat parsnip, last time too. Don't make this if you dont like parsnips. There was way too much parsnips, and a little too much onion too I find.

Really easy and great flavor. Love it. Have made it 3 times already.

Easy and tasty. I couldn't find ground lamb so I cut it off a shoulder chop into smallish pieces. Worked out great. Love the parsnips and the cinnamon. Won't change a thing the next time I make it.

3 1/2 is more accurate, but I can't give a half so I will go up to 4 because this was so easy. I had to spice it up a bit, more cinnamon and some mint, but overall a nice "get home from work and throw it together" dish that can be served to company. Mine loved it.

Quite easy to make and very tasty. I would add more cinnamon next time and perhaps a bit more garlic.

A keeper! Made with Trader Joe's Multigrain Penne Pasta with Flax. I wouldn't change a thing.

A really good "comfort" dish. Basically American chop suey with a Greek twist, if you ask me. If I hadn't cooked it myself I would never have guessed the meat was lamb - could just have easily been beef, since the flavor of the lamb was lost amidst the overall combination of flavors. Parsnips were out of season here, so I used carrots instead, and added some green beans as well. Loved how the sweetness of the vegetables combined with the cinnamon, tomatoes and meat. A very hearty, satisfying weekday dish.

Don't 86 the parsnips - they make the dish. If you don't like parsnips don't make this.

This was a great dish, and a great blend of flavors, I do agree with the cook from LA, I also added a bit more garlic, but not overpowering. Was even better next day,(added a little chicken stock to reconstitute juices). This one is a keeper

I was SOOOO disappointed with this recipe!!! I don't get the parsnip thing at all; the flavors did not appear to mesh for me and the parsnip totally dominated. I had to dump the entire pot into the garbage :(

Wonderful for a crowd! I doubled this and fed 10 with not a scrap leftover. I added quite a bit more cinnamon. For garnishes, along with the Feta, I offered chopped fresh mint instead of parsely. I also toasted some pine nuts and they were a big hit. I will make this again.

i halved this. It was quick and easy. The cinnamon and parsnips were great! I also used a red onion instead of a yellow onion -- it added some nice color and tangy flavor. I will be doing this again...

Amazingly good! The only thing I changed was to add more garlic. I can't wait to make it again.

I really wanted to love this more because it was so easy. I was very careful to make the recipe as stated. I thought the parsnips were terrible. Any bite that had parsnip tasted only of parsnip. They did not blend with the other flavors. The feta is fabulous at the end. Next time, I'll try substituting carrots; or perhaps I'll just leave out the parsnips altogether as my family has requested.

Great weekday recipe. Very easy and good flavor. Would also make a great apres ski meal. Don't leave out the parsnips...they make the dish.

This was quite good as written-- filling comfort food perfect for a fall evening. Had I had dried mint on hand, I would have added that as well, which I think would have further enhanced an already very good dish.

So easy and sooooo yummy. I added a little cumin and ginger as well and it was perfect. We made a greek salad to go along with it and it was a great weekday meal. I highly recommend this! The leftovers are really good too!

I just made this, and was very impressed. There are only two of us, so we will be enjoying leftovers for several days!

I made it as directed and it was delicious. Can't wait for the leftovers tomorrow. Great way to get my veggie adverse husband to eat some vegetables.

Thought this was excellent, although it took me a bit longer to brown the parsnips. Used a little more cinnamon, and was glad I did. Very clever recipe and looking forward to the leftovers.
