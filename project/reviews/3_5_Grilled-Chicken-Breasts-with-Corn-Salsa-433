Delicious and so easy! Destined to go in my regular summer recipe collection. The chicken stayed moist and absorbed the flavor of the marinade. I might add a bit more soy sauce and lime juice next time.

Amazing recipe, with a couple of changes. I added two cloves of garlic to the marinade and a little extra cilantro. Make sure when you're ready to grill the chicken breasts to season it with salt and pepper. For the salsa, again, a little extra jalapeño, BE SURE to salt and pepper the mixture and a little extra garlic. This dish is awesome if you follow the directions and kick up the spice level a little. The person that said it was bland/flavorless is on dope and probably didn't completely review the recipe prior to cooking.

I thought this was easy and good. I increased soy sauce in marinade and butterflied my chicken breasts. Chicken cooked up juicy and the salsa was great.

Actually I shouldn't have even given this one fork. So disappointing! I am surprised because of the rave reviews but nothing in this recipe is worth making. The chicken was tasteless and the salsa was really boring!

Loved this recipe. The dark beer gives a nice flavor, and the salsa pairs great with it. I would recommend making the salsa a few hours ahead of time like it says to let the flavors come out of the cilantro and jalapeno. Big hit with my husband, came out great on the grill.

As everyone else has stated, the salsa was exceptional. I love gourmet food, and couldn't believe how simple it was, and how the natural flavors could mix so well together. I normally only use fresh ingredients, but only had canned corn at the time, and it worked just fine. Since most people had issues with the chicken, I decided to season the chicken right after I marianted it. To the marinade, I also added a lot of garlic and more lime juice. Grilling it was easy, and it came out perfectly. If you make the chicken, you definitely need the salsa. The combo of both was great. Will definitely make again. I

So, as expected the salsa was super fantastic. Everyone said that, so I was not surprised. I didn't have frozen corn, so I used canned and it worked fine. I altered the marinade for the chicken as a few had suggested. I didn't have dark beer sadly, so went with a pilsner. Added cumin (1 tbsp), a pinch of ancho chili pepper, upped the soy to double and added garlic and a pinch of the chopped cilantro from the salsa fixins. I think that marinade would be awesome if I let it sit for more than an hour. Cooked it on my favorite cast iron grill. The outer portions of the chicken were yummy.. inner portions were blah. Well cooked, but blah. If I find myself with five hours to marinate something (a rare event in our busy get dinner on the table in 30min or less household) I will try the chicken again. I expect the salsa will show up on our regular fish taco night.

I have made the salsa but not the chicken. Salsa is great - we make it quite often! While it is easier to use frozen corn, I would highly recommend to use fresh. I normally simmer the ears for 10 min, then remove the corn kernels and let them cool completely. The salsa is much more flavorful, crunchy and has a nice balance between the sweetness of the corn and the lime juice. For a spicier version don't hesitate to use Serrano peppers!

Based on the other reviews, I did alter the marinade...I added 3 sliced garlic cloves, a touch more soy sauce, lime juice and a pinch of cumin. It was very tasty, especially paired with the salsa. This will definitely be on our dinner rotation!

I agree with the other chefs -- ONLY MAKE THE SALSA -- it was great -- that's the only part of this recipe that we ate. the chicken was moist but it was tasteless....will make the salsa again though.

Made only the salsa and put it on bbq chicken - FABULOUS! Nice refreshing summer recipe. I used yellow pepper (because I didnt have red) and added 1/4c chopped tomato instead for color - it was great! I also doubled the lime juice but most of it was at the bottom of the bowl anyway - just gave me more to stir with. Definitely an easy repeat!

We only made the salsa, along with grilled chicken tenders seasoned with Mexican spices. A refreshing and different dish that we enjoyed very much.

I had to average the rating. The chicken got a two, but the salsa! Definitely a 4. I've only made the chicken once, but I make the corn salsa all the time. The last time a fight almost broke out over the last serving left in the bowl. I usually serve it with either fajitas or chicken that's been marinated with oil, lime and garlic, and a little balsamic vinegar. That's spectacular. Just skip the chicken and go for the salsa.

This recipe was so so...chicken quite bland, and couldn't taste the marinade. Skip the chicken, make the salsa, which is a very nice, low fat way to serve corn.

The salsa is absolutely delicious. I make it all the time and it's a family favourite. I have made the chicken a couple of times but not anymore. Too bland and a waste of time.

Absolutely easy and delicious! I cooked the chicken breasts in the toaster oven on broil for 25 minutes and it came out tender and moist. Be sure to salt & pepper the chicken well before putting it in the oven. I also marinated it for 4 hours. The dish looks great with the salsa, served over brown rice with grilled red peppers and salad to go.

i can't get enough of the corn salsa -- and it's great with quiche, fish, anything that needs accompanying. definitely double the recipe, even if just making for two -- you'll want more.

Great recipe. the salsa is just incredible. I added a little tomato and extra lime juice to it. Since several people commented on the blandness of the marinade, I modified it a bit and it was quite tasty. I used GUINESS for the beer in the marinade. (accept no substitutes!) also, added some chili powder, doubled the lime juice, added a few pinches of coriander, and a clove of garlic delicious!

I didn't even bother making the chicken, but made the salsa and LOVED IT! I made chicken fajitas and offered the salsa as a condiment and it had suitable complex flavors. A definite keeper.

I loved the corn salsa. I just made an enormous amount of it and served the chicken on a pile of salsa instead of visa versa. I butterflied the breast to ensure they cooked all the way thourgh because mine were really thick. I agree with another reviewer, the marinade didn't add much. I would try a lime galic marinade next time.

The corn salsa was the defining taste on this one. The chicken marinade was rather bland, so I'd recreate this using a better marinade.

Followed this recipe exactly (except I tripled the corn salsa recipe) and it was great. The chicken was tasty and tender and the salsa was OUTSTANDING! The textures, spicy flavor and wonderful color of the salsa make this a real treat. Even after tripling the salsa, there was little left over after feeding 6 people. I will definately make this again (and again!).

The salsa was great, definitely double it. I also added about 1 tsp of red wine vinegar to the salsa. I didn't feel the marinade added anything to the chicken though so will probably skip that in the future.

The chicken did not turn out very tasty, but the true winning part of this recipe is the salsa. I never would have thought to make a salsa like this on my own--very good and able to be adapted according to taste. i made with spanish rice!

Grilled chicken is usually just that, grilled chicken and bland. What you put on the chicken or the marinade makes or breaks the dish. What makes this dish "stand out" is the corn salsa! I didn't have dark beer so I used a Corona and the chicken came out great. I tenderized the breasts before marinating them so that they'd soak up the flavor. I doubled the salsa recipe because I knew it would go fast and it did! This is a great dish for a warm summer evening. I paired the dish with green bean and roasted tomato salad, spanish rice and for dessert; chocolate lava cakes with coffee sauce!

A tasty, satisfying and low-fat meal. Very simple to prepare, it will likely become a weeknight dinner staple at my place! The salsa does have a pronounced cilantro flavor, which I quite liked, but others may wish to cut the cilantro some.

This is a fabulous recipe...tasty and low fat! The combination of the beer, lime, and cilantro was very different and wonderful! I marinated it overnight, so the chicken was very tender and full of flavor. The corn salsa was terrific! I went heavier on the lime juice and chili peppers. Can't wait to make it again!

I found my chicken to be extremely flavorless. Perhaps the pieces I used were too thick, which prevented the marinade from infusing properly. Also, the corn salsa was to cilantro-heavy for my taste buds.

My husband and I love this recipe - it is so easy and the salsa is great. I did make several modifications, I doubled the jalapeno and lime juice in the salsa and used more red pepper and less red onion than called for. I also used canned white corn as a short cut. I added 2 cloves of garlic to the marinade, doubled the cilantro and lime juice in the marinade. The salsa is definitely what makes it. Try this salsa with chips for company. I served this with cilantro spiced jasmati rice and steamed veggies with cornbread. Yummy and easy.

I prepared this recipe for 20 teachers & staff members for a special function at the school district where I work. They absolutely loved it. I had to improvise as I had no access to a grill or even a broiler. I pan seared it in a non-stick pan. Afterwards, I simmered the marinade, strained it and poured this over the chicken to keep it moist and flavorful for holding. The dish was a big hit!

I added a teaspoon of honey for extra flavor. If you marinade the chicken and prepare the salsa ahead of time, this is a very quick dish to get on the table.

The best thing about this recipe is the corn salsa, which is wonderfully forgiving with the proportions. I think it works fine with plain grilled chicken - not crazy about the marinade. Great summer dish!

I made this for a bridal shower (I multiplied the recipe for 30 people) and it turned out wonderfully! I will definitely make this again. One recommendation: make the salsa the night before when you set up the chicken to marinate-- it got better with some time to mellow.

Great summer dinner! I think I will take advice from on of the other reviewers and pound the chicken down a little to cut down on cooking time and help with even cooking. I cooked this inside on a grilling pan and it came out great. Next time I will make the salsa a little spicier by keeping some of the seeds from the pepper.

I made this dish for Father's Day dinner and everybody enjoyed it very much. The beauty of it is that it's really easy to prepare, but the marinade is very flavorful. As for the salsa, I added chopped tomato, which I found added some flavor and also balanced the spiciness of the jalapeno. Will definitely make again!

This is an amazing recipe. The flavors all blend perfectly. There's just enough jalapeno to make your mouth tingle but doesn't overpower the rest of the flavors. We served it with a sweet corn cake and it was perfect. Definitely a make again recipe.

This is a simple and delicious recipe; great for company. The fresh cilantro really makes a differance. I double the amount of salsa because it's always so popular.
