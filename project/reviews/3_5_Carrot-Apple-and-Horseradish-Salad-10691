Very good; nice to have a new "slaw". Thanks to previous reviewers, cut horseradish back to 2t. That was perfect for us. It kept very well in the frig for 2 days.

This was not a hit. I did accidently buy light sour cream and omitted the horseradish. I added raisins and more sugar and still...nobody touched it.

Loved this recipe. I didn't have real horseradish around, so I used a tablespoon of good horseradish sauce from the fridge. We ate this with ribs, mashed potatoes, and chocolate cake. It added a great flavor with a unique dimensions. It was MUCH better than I thought it would be. . .will make this again!

Good salad--especially when you only have carrots and apples around (like I did). I had to substitute mayonnaise for the sour cream and lemonade for the lemon juice and sugar, but it still worked. It is a fun, unusual combination of flavors--great with grilled beef.

This is a nice refreshing and healthy summer salad. Great use for leftover carrots! I do caution on making this for a mixed group of people - - the horseradish flavor is polarizing. But if you love big, complex bold flavors, this is for you. I took it to a cookout with lots of little kids and it was NOT a big hit.

One of the very few recipes from this site that I make exactly as stated. The apple and horseradish make a perfect match and the lemon gives it a nice tang. It also looks good and is very simple. My favourite Epicurious salad.

This was really good! I used less horseradish than the recipe called for (maybe only one tsp.) and added about 1/2 cup chopped peanuts. I think the peanuts really added some interest to the mix.

Very different...I put 1 tsp of horseradish, next time I will use less. My boyfriend found it amazing.

This is a surprisingly nice combination. Very tangy and full of flavor. Easy to make too. I left out the parsley.

I just loved this combination. Teamed together with either cold beef or pork, this salad is sure to be a winner.

I was looking for a Shaker recipe called Sister Mary's Zest Carrots. The Shaker recipe uses mayonnaise and horseradish on just cooked carrots. This is just as good, and will make a nice addition to my collection.

What a suprise! I never would have paired these ingredients, but this salad was fabulous with a rich Thanksgiving dinner. It provided a piquant (and sinus passage-clearing) cut through the heavy meal. This would be excellent in the summer, and holds well in the refrigerator for leftovers.
