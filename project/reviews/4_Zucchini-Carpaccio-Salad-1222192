This was merely okay as written, but the addition of lemon juice made it fantastic. I would also try lemon zest next time. Also, I used yellow zucchini, which was visually stunning. This is a great way to use the zucchini in the CSA box.

A very interesting way to use zucchini. It's really best with ultra fresh ones from your garden. Like most Italian-inspired food, you need the really good ingredients for this one - good parmesan is a must. I found that a little drizzle of lime juice at the end was very well received - I tried vinegar, as suggested by others, but the lime was just perfect.

This was alright, but I didn't like the texture of the zucchini, I thought it was sort of slimy. Maybe I salted it too long, I left it for 40 min while I made the rest of dinner.

This was a great recipe. I think it is important to have good quality oil and parmesan as those flavours are an important part of the overall success of the dish. I shaved the parmesan with the vege peeler so there was a nice mix of zucchini and parmesan strips. Yum. An easy addition if you have vego friends coming to a large gathering.

I gave this recipe 4 stars for its simplicity and potential. I added lemon juice and lemon zest as suggested by an earlier reviewer. I think it would be incredible as a main course salad with slices of grilled steak (an earlier reviewer suggested deli roast beef) and maybe a few thin slices of radish.

One more note... I used lightly colored zucchinis that are grown in the middle east for stuffing (not the typical dark green ones found in stores) and only shaved the outside of the zucchini to where the seeds started. I think they have a milder, sweeter flavor. I found a wide vegetable peeler the easiest way to get perfect strips of the zucchini and of the cheese.

This salad was awesome! I used lemon juice and olive oil, added thinly sliced avocado to the mix and sliced the parmigiano instead of grating it. I also tossed in thinly sliced, fresh purple basil (optional) which made the salad beautiful and added a lovely flavor. We will certainly make this again and again.

This was good, I guess, but I would not make it again.

I love this, particularly with smaller zucchini, which have a better flavor. I like to add a bit of balsamic vinegar or lemon juice, as others have said, it needs a bit of acid.

Surprisingly delicious! Wouldn't have tried this except for the good reviews. Sliced the zucchini in long ribbons, which made for a pretty presentation. Had baby lettuce on hand, so added a squeeze of lemon juice to brighten the flavor. A high quality, flavorful olive oil is important!

Umm...this really didn't do much for me. It was quick and easy but nothing extraordinary taste-wise. I regretted adding toasted pinenuts as suggested by some reviewers, as I thought it overpowered the delicate taste of the zucchini. I added just a squirt of lime as I didn't want to mess around with the recipe too much. As it turned out, I think the salad would have benefited from more lime/lemon juice to brighten and bring out the zucchini flavor.

Yum, I love this salad! I make it a lot in the late summer/early fall. It is wonderful as is, but can also be adapted very easily. The zucchini is great with all sorts of greens. My favorite version is one that subs manchego for parmigiano, with a Jerez sherry vinaigrette topped with pepitas.

why... is this SO GOOD!? IT'S SO GOOD! it's so simple, but the combination is SO satisfying. i've made this many times, with a couple of different variations. the addition of toasted pine nuts is a huge plus. i've also made it sans arugula, and it's still delicious. if you're feeling lazy, you can skip the salt and rinse step without losing much.

Extremely tasty and a nice texture with the super thin slices. I used dandelion greens and lemon olive oil and will make this often.

I've made this many times. I use a combination of yellow and green zucchini thinly sliced on a mandolin. I do not salt and drain as suggested. I dress it with a parsley oil citronette. (Extra virgin olive oil, fresh-squeezed lemon juice, flat leaf parsley, kosher salt blended in a food processor.) I top with shaved parmesan and toasted pine nuts. It always gets raves from my guests.

This is weirdly addictive...we ate the entire thing at tonight's dinner. I added only lemon juice and changed the cheese to Asiago since that's what I had in the fridge. Nice to eat garden zucchini raw.

So friggin good! I loved the flavor combinations. I used a really good lemon olive oil to perk up the lemon flavor and crushed hazelnuts since that's what I had on hand. Can't wait to try it with pinenuts. Good cheese was also key!

I simply love this recipe. I have made it a few times for different company and it always gets rave reviews.

I used spinach instead of arugula and I added some balsamic and rice wine vinegar to give it some bite. It got rave reviews.

What a simple and truly delicious take on salad. Made a 1/3 batch for husband and self last night as a side dish with Parmesan-Sage Crusted pork chops (another fave from this site). Prepared just as writte, but preferring to use Pecorino Romano instead of Parmesan - and then drizzled the plated mound of salad with a bit of good balsamic. Will definietly add this to my repertoire of favorite salads.

Absolutely delicious. i did add a bit of lemon at the end, but otherwise, made just as is. A definite keeper

I always only slice the zucchini as thin as possible with a knife (don't have an adjustable blade-slicer), and this recipe turns out fine. Also, I always sub fresh spinach for the arugula (as none is available in this town), and only use about 1/2 of the required olive oil. This time I added some fresh mushrooms (sliced) to the spinach mixture, along with 4+1/2 oz. of a 1/2-inch thick slice of Black Angus deli roast beef that I then sliced into very thin strips. I had to grate 2 oz. of Parmigiano-Reggiano to get 1/2-cup. On the top of the salad I lined the outer edge of the bowl with another 4 oz. of thin strips of Angus beef. Also added several splashes of white wine vinegar over the top of the salad just before a final toss. ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL as a main dish with baguette bread on the side!!!

Fabulous! I don't like zucchini much, especially when it's cooked, but this dish is the perfect solution. Once I was out of arugula and used mache (lamb's lettuce), with a bit of vinegar in the dressing to compensate for the loss of bite, and it still turned out well.

I have eaten this salad several times a week for the past month. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! I think it is great with or without the arugula. I ALWAYS add lots of fresh lemon zest and toasted sunflower seeds. I think the zucchini alone version is great leftover as a snack the next day. An excellent permanent addition to my recipe files.

Outstanding salad! I added toasted pinenuts and some thinly sliced radicchio for color and texture; I also splashed some champagne vinegar over the finished salad, per one of the other reviewer's suggestions. The end result was fantastic! I will definitely make again and would do it exactly the same.

I also wasn't sure where the flavors were going to come from for this dish, was almost tempted to sprinkle some lemon juice on top. but the flavors from the vegetables were so robust that it didn't need too much help. A good quality cheese is also a must.

When I read this recipe I couldn't understand what was going to give this salad any flavor. Boy, was I surprised when I made it!!! DELISH. Subbed fresh spinach for arugula (never can find it around here), and Mexican squash for the zucchini. Did add a splash of white-wine vinegar at the end (as suggested by a reviewer), and only slightly decreased the oil. Will try this as a one-dish meal with thinly sliced deli Black Angus beef mixed in, and that famous "crusty bread" on the side. A very pleasant surprise.

I have made zucchini "fettucini" before w/ a fresh bruschetta sauce -- great concept too! I use a vegetable peeler for the zucchini -- people are always surprised at how delicious it is, and I am always surprised by how easy!

There was no arugula to be had, so I used an organic spring mix. I would also recommend a splash of white wine vinegar on top...really makes the flavor sparkle. The recipe is rather salty, but very good and the zucchini is good to munch on all by itself when prepared as directed!

This is fast easy and uses up a few of the plethora of zucchini in your garden. The salting changes the texture of the raw zucchini so it is sort of cooked but very fresh tasting. I used small 6 inch zucchini and sliced them with a potato peeler which worked perfectly.
