I forgot I didn't use Roquefort, I used Great Hill Blue from Ma. It is mild and fantastic, this would make a BIG difference.

This recipe is really delicious! It was a really nice alternative and not the same crudite. I served it in the radicchio they suggested. It was difficult to hollow out the radicchio, but in the end it was worth it; it looked like a beautiful flower. I used both fruit and vegetables to dip, including: Pears, apples, red seedless grapes, celery, red and yellow endive. In addition, it was thicker than I expected but it could be thinned to make a fantastic salad dressing. I only had very dry sherry, but I eliminated about 1 tsp total (I made double recipe for 40pl) and it was fine. I am making it this evening for Thanksgiving as a spread for crackers and anticipate it will be a hit.

I thought this was a great dip. It was extremely easy to make, which would make it a perfect appetizer when pulling together a complicated dinner party. I served with apple slices. I did make it the day before, which I think is important in a recipe like this so that all the flavors can come together.

This is a fabulous dip, once you add the toasted walnuts. It received rave reviews, by blue cheese foodies. You don't need to use really expensive roquefort.

I brought this to a party and it didn't go over very well. I bought really good Roquefort and crumbled it as best I could and it was still too chunky. A difficult dip for a buffet. It might work to process it before serving.

Have served this at party luncheons and dinners and at-home dinners . . . a refreshing well received appetizer.

This was very good, but it needed some doctoring to make it great. I added lemon juice -- may 1/4 to 1/3 of a lemon -- and toasted chopped walnuts. It was rather bland otherwise. I prepared it about 5 hours before I served it and it made a big difference in the taste. All of our guests enjoyed this.

This dip is great! I used extra sherry and added toasted pecans and I'd recommend those changes. I served it with crackers and whatever vegetables I had on hand, and it was a big hit at the party.

I made this for a winter basketball watching party and it was a huge hit with men and women alike. I like to serve it with all green vegetables and apples -- it made for a pretty presentation. I found it got a little thick after sitting in the fridge, so I put in more liquid than is called for.

We made this recipe for an appetiser for a summer barbeque. It was a great hit. I would make it again. The flavors are enhanced if the dip is made the day before.
