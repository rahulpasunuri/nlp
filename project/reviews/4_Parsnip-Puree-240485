I have never reviewed a recipe, but I need to jump in here and ask about the quantity of salt & pepper. The dish is ruined with those amounts. Company on the way and I don't know how to remedy this. And I'm a long-time experienced cook. It tastes funky, too.

This is a fine recipe although I must say anyone wanting to make a parsnip dish could come up with this intuitively. It ain't rocket (or culinary) science. That's why I gave it only 3 forks. Agree no need for so much butter. Boiling 30-45 minutes was rather excessive - mine were ready to go in about 15. I really liked all the suggestions by reviewers and will incorporate some of them the next time I make this dish.

Excellant!!! Butter can be decreased by 3/4 and if you are a Veggie, you can substitute the chicken stock for some of the water you boiled the Parsnips in... Adding roasted garlic really enhances the flavor.

There were just two of us, so I made a half-recipe. Also, I had planned to make a celery root-pear puree, but then could only find parsnips at the grocery store. The half-recipe plus 2 chopped and sauteed pears in the mix worked out as a great, slightly sweet complement to a blackberry-glazed lamb chop recipe that I found through Google. Yummy!

Who knew parsnips tasted this yummy and creamy? I had never had them before but was very pleasantly surprised by the sweet and creamy taste. Definitely needs to be paired with a savory dish, as it is quite sweet.

I don't think I've ever rated a recipe 4 stars but this was so good and so simple. I made it as a bed for roasted wild mushrooms and finished with a bit of truffle oil. The mushrooms were good, but the parsnips stole the show.

This is an excellent recipe and simple to make. I substituted Smart Balance for the butter and cut back to about six tablespoons of that. Then, I added two tablespoons chopped scallions at the end to pump it up a bit. I used only about half the parsnips, so you may wish to use more butter or butter substitute. Excellent dish!

My husband used this as a bed for roasted fish, and added just a little scraping of nutmeg to the puree. So good we're serving it again on Thanksgiving.

This was great with a little truffle oil. I served it with lamb chops.

Great simple recipe, I added some leeks which I threw in with the parsnips when they had about 10 minutes left to boil. Really came out great.

This was good, but too rich. Next time I would cut back on the butter.

A great alternative to traditional rice or potatoes. We loved it.

Wow. It is almost absurd how good this is. Parsnips? Who knew?

Excellent! Tastes great with a side that's a tiny bit sweet and goes well with a savory meat.
