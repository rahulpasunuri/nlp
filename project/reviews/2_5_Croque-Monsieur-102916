Thousand Island dressing is NOT bechamel sauce.

This is NOT a croque monsieur.

So funny to use Thousand Island, Swiss and ordinary ham to make this Croque Monsieur, but the taste was fabuloso! My dearly beloved loved it - and he's a picky eater!

This was easy but very bland...the name is more exciting than the sandwich. I'd add either caraway to the sauce or use rye bread...either would be a vast improvement.

I prepared one of these sandwiches for my S0, to accompany a bowl of soup, before he left for his night shift job. My four-year-old wandered in, asked for a bite, then requested her own sandwich (she'd already had her supper). I did manage to sneak a bite or two myself, and thought it was good, but on the basis of my family's reaction, I have to give this four stars.

Really,people,nobody here cares about how to pronounce it,this is a recipes site. Anyway,the sandwich recipe is really good,next time,try mixing a little heavy cream with grated gruyere,and use is instead of the dressing and the slices of cheese,I bet you'll like it!!.

Good grief! Is this a recipe finder or a language web site?! My friends, who are visiting from Paris, and I just made this sandwich and we thought it was very easy and had good flavor! We all think maybe others could critique the food and leave the "sniping" behind........ Who cares if they even spell it "CROAK"? Just eat the food!

In response to Manda from Madison: You may need to brush up on your French lessons. A croque madame has an egg on it, not a croque monsieur. But I encourage readers to try both, they're equally delicious.

uh, that would be "croque madam" no 'e'. ;-) do these usually have swiss cheese? what about using Gruyere? acceptable? or Raclette?

I didn't make this recipe, but as any good French student would know, a Croque Monsieur has an easy over egg on it!
