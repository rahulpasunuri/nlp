This is a very basic recipe. Definitely can't say exceptional as you're really not doing much here, flavour depends on ingredient quality. I made half the recipe using chard and collard greens. I did not have "baby greens" so it might have been better to let them cook a few minutes longer, as I did not remove the chard stems and they were a bit tough, but I had assumed I was sauteeing them at the end. I don't know why the recipe calls for draining them for an hour; I did so but didn't mix. The vinagrette really gave the greens some kick. I'll use the recipe when I have mixed greens from my veggie basket.

This has become my go-to recipe for the misc. greens from my CSA share. I've used it with dandelion greens, chard, even escarole. It is a great summer alternative to my typical sauteed greens with garlic.

Greens were high quality and I drained for as long as I could but cold mushy greens didn't go over well with anyone even though the flavor was generally okay.

I plan on trying it with greens from my 'market share;' (CSA), raspberry vinegrette, coconut oil & a sprinkle of fresh herbs - maybe fennel (leaf) & thyme.

I liked this much better the next day chilled.

YUM! it does depend on the greens you have - mine were fresh and delish (it being springtime). simplicity and perfection itself.

This was OK. I think it definitely matters what kind of greens you have. If you have greens that you really like you will enjoy this. If the mixture is just so-so. Then this dish will so-so as well.
