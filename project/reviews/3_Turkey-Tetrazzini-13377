This recipe turned out delicious! I made several substitutions based on the other great reviews (thanks!!) I sauteed onion, celery and garlic before adding mushroom. I used a gourmet blend of mushrooms and halved the butter requirement. Also, I added poultry seasoning in addition to celery salt and white pepper. And lastly, I substituted farfelle pasta and topped with Panko bread crumbs - which all turned out so incredible I'll make it for years to come!

This was good but only because I read the reviews ahead of time. I actually looked for a different recipe and ended up following part of Emeril's and part of this. Used egg noodles instead of spaghetti - can't imagine why anyone would use spaghetti for this dish. Added thyme to the mushrooms and added leeks -- didn't have peas so used seeded tomatoes. Killed the milk and the wine and used Harvey's Bristol Cream sherry and heavy cream and some Worcestershire suace. With those changes it was a great dish --smelled wonderful cooking and tasted great on the table.

I am allergic to dairy (cow's milk) and gluten/wheat so I modified this recipe using gluten free flour, almond milk, earth balance "butter", rice pasta and used a sheep's milk Romano. I also tossed in a little corn starch since the almond "milk" is very thin. Although not anything like the original recipe (nothing ever is in my world) it is very tasty and I can imagine following it to the letter is pretty darn tasty too.

After reading prior reviews I added a small onion and 2 cloves of garlic to the mushrooms. Also added a bit of sage and thyme. Used evaporated milk because that's what I had. Was generous with the sauce ingredients. I thought it was outstanding and will definitely make again.

Just okay...disappointing. I only baked it ten mins, because I didn't want it dry, but it still came out dry! It was okay...not something I'd probably make again. I did add celery.

This was literally okay. It didn't taste bad - It didn't taste good. It hardly tasted at all. Blech. I even added extra mushroom, onion, garlic, and dry white wine to boost it up. I cannot imagine how bland it would be if you made it as directed. Spend your time and money on something else.

Delicious use of Thanksgiving leftovers. Used non-fat milk, and panko bread crumbs.

I really enjoyed both cooking and eating this recipe. I did make some minor adjustments... In the beginning a cooked the mushrooms with 1 small chopped onion and 2 large cloves of garlic and seasoned with salt and pepper. No dry white wine on hand so left out and added a few shakes of wistichire sauce. Used half the amount of milk and then equal amount of heavy cream (naughty I know), The sauce was amazing. I used egg noodles as they lend themselves to a caserole much better than spaghetti. End result was delicious a hit with the whole family.

I made this with some revisions (and am currently having leftovers for lunch) and thought it was great! I used orzo instead of spaghetti. Since I didn't have any wine, I substituted a combo of tamari and worcestershire sauce (in a smaller amount) to pick up the flavor. I used leftover turkey gravy instead of broth. My husband loved it. Such a comforting dish!

Rating: 0
This was delicious. I made it a little lighter by cutting back on the butter a bit, and used non-fat milk. As other's already suggested I used dry sherry instead of the wine, and egg noodles. It was just as creamy and rich as we wanted it post-Thanksgiving feast. I served it on a bed of sauted onions, celery and kale.This one stays in my recipe box for sure.

A solid weeknight dish: delicious, easy, and cozy. I took one reviewer's suggestion and used some leftover gravy towards the stock allotment, added 1/2 an onion, 2 T garlic, and some sage. Next time I will increase the sauce mixture by 50%.

So good! I've been making this for years and I love it. It does help to make sure the mushroom mixture has thickened a bit before baking.

Since I doctored this recipe, this is less a review than a suggestion for an alternative. My family doesn't eat mushrooms, so I substituted half a large onion, minced, and two cloves of garlic. I also followed another reviewer's recommendation and used sherry instead of wine. At the end, I added 1 tsp of dried rubbed sage and 1/2 tsp dried thyme. The sauce was delicious. I used egg noodles and 1.5 cups of peas. It did not come out at all dry. I'll make it again next year with the last of the Thanksgiving turkey. It was a hit!

We love this and found the amount of sauce just right. I also sauteed 1/2 an onion and 2 garlic cloves with the mushrooms. I used 12 oz. leftover gravy for most of the chicken broth and reduced the amount of flour a little since the gravy was already thickened.The tetrazzini captures all the flavors I used with the turkey as well as its own.

Agree this is a good starter recipe. I added onion, garlic, doubled the mushrooms, substituted sherry for the white wine and added gruyere to the parm. Will stick with the sherry if I make this again. Wish I would have thought to add celery.

absolutely awesome. This is the best recipe I have found for turkey tetrazzini

My husband and I loved this recipe! The sauce was a little runny, so I will use more flour next time, and I did use a little more parmesan than indicated, which I think was even better! I didn't have enough turkey so also put in 2 cooked chicken breasts; couldn't tell the difference; really good comfort food, and for the toppings, I used parmesan garlic croutons crushed up as I had no bread crumbs. Added just the right amount of zest!This would be perfect for a potluck or a weekday supper for a large family.

I loved this; the only change I made was to use Progresso Italian Bread Crumbs and we didn't have any white wine (the 2010 blizzard was happening) so I added 1/4 cup additional milk. Everyone else loved it, including the 20 month old picky eater.

I loved this recipe and don't understand why people think it's dry. I added a large onion (chopped), minced garlic, and some "pasta" herb to the mushrooms. Also, I added cheddar cheese to the mixture, and used chardonnay wine. My girls absolutely loved it and we are all packing it in our lunches now. Definitely a keeper.

This is a great "starter" recipe for leftover turkey. I doubled the mushrooms and sauteed them with celery (3 stalks) and a chopped onion. I made the sauce separate and added the mushroom mixture while sauce was simmering. For topping, I added a layer of shredded cheddar cheese and mixed the breadcrumbs (doubled the amount) with melted butter and parmesean. A wonderful comfort meal on a cold evening and a great recipe for leftover turkey. I'll definately make this again.

Rating: 1
I should have read the reviews and tried another recipe. This was too dry and bland, even with my additions of sauteed onions, thyme, lots of pepper, and chopped chicken thighs sauteed in hot paprika. The bread crumb/cheese topping was like sawdust. I have augmented the leftovers with a lot of white sauce to rescue it. This was a very disappointing version of a pretty straightforward dish.

Easily made. Good ingredient combination.

This is certainly an acceptable winter comfort food use of leftover turkey. As others noted, it ain't pretty. If you're inviting your boss over, don't do this dish. But it definitely is a solid, child-friendly weekday meal. I found it a little bland, but I'm not sure spicing this up would make any great difference.

With a few changes, this was great and well received at a post-Thanksgiving potluck. I sauteed a yellow onion and a couple cloves of garlic in some extra butter before the mushrooms. I really didn't want it to be dry, so I made extra sauce~maybe 1 1/2 times. I also subbed broccoli cut small for peas (added with the mushrooms) Last, some grated Swiss cheese and more salt and pepper before baking, made it a 4 forker! I will definitely make this again soon!

The best recipe for Tetrazzini is in the Joy of Cooking!

Rating: 3
Funny how some people found this to be dry, and some said it was soupy. At the risk of sounding like Goldilocks, mine was just right! The variations probably depend on how much liquid you evaporate from the mushrooms (ALWAYS use fresh - canned mushrooms should be illegal) and how much you cook the pasta. For me, this was a great way to use up leftovers, and an improvement over my mom's old Good Housekeeping recipe. Hint: break the spaghetti into shorter pieces before cooking -- it'll make serving easier.

This recipe was disappointing. It was not very flavorful. Maybe I did something wrong.

As others have attested, this recipe as written produces a very dry product. Upon service, I had to gently incorporate hot cream to loosen things up a bit. The flavor was there, but the sauce was absent. Next time, in addition to cutting the heat back to 350 degrees and cooking for 20 to 30 minutes, I think Ill up the broth content by a cup or more since, the only time I make this dish is when I have smoked or roasted a turkey and have rendered the skeleton down into a couple or more quarts of stock.

Overall, we all liked this recipe, which is saying quite a bit, since "all" includes 2 40-something New Yorkers and a two year old. Two thoughts for everyone. First, we halved the recipe, which worked pretty well except that it needed a bit more liquid. Next time, I'd probably go with 1 1/8th cups milk, which is 50% plus 1/4 cup. Second, it largely but not entirely passes the "great leftover recipe!" test. It transforms the leftover you're bored with into something pretty yummy, which is very good. But it requires a lot of new ingredients, thus creating more leftovers than it uses, and it's got more steps and pans to it than it should, three pans and one bowl. So, go for it... but don't expect it to be superquick or supereasy.

Using what was leftover and filling in the gaps, I made a number of changes: dried shitake mushrooms, finely diced cooked green beans, added chopped artichoke hearts, stuffing instead of crumbs. Still it turned out great! Even the kids liked it and appreciated a meal of disguised leftovers!

We thought this dish was bland as written, but have improved it to where we really enjoy it now. I add onion, garlic, celery, red pepper flakes, and usually parsley with the mushrooms. I also double the wine, use 2% milk, and add dijon mustard when adding the milk and broth. We prefer it with penne as it seems to be easier to scoop and eat. Garnish with more chopped parsley before serving.

This is so similar to tuna noodle cassarole. I think I like it with tuna better because it has a stronger flavor but this recipe is good for a potluck and to use up left over turkey. I didn't have any problems with it coming out. It was very simple and came out perfectly. Maybe those who thought it was watery didn't reduce the sauce to a thick enough consistencY?

I have been making this dish for a couple of years now. I have to agree, definitely cut down on the broth! I sometimes use whole wheat spaghetti mixed w/ the regular spaghetti which works well. This year, instead of using bread crumbs, I used left over stuffing and it was great! The stuffing had bits of apple and raisins. Yum! This dish freezes pretty well and doubles nicely. Definitely use more cheese.

This is an excellent dish for those turkey leftovers. It is delicious without changing a thing. I also believe that sometimes mixing it up a bit is great to add new interest.

I have never made a tetrazzini before and usually stay away from high fat dishes. I turned this into a wonderful lower fat version by using half the butter, 1% milk a bit more wine (dry but heavy chardonnay which addes depth, added a bit of fresh garlic when cooking the mushrooms and added dried shallots. It was wonderful and rich yet not very fatty.

This perfect for using up my leftover turkey. I added the red pepper and half an onion, as others had suggested. Think the pepper really just added visual appeal. I managed to save the turkey pan juices and used those in place of the chicken stock (came up short and increased the wine-good idea too) which I think really added a depth of flavor if you have the forethought to do so. Also increased breadcrumbs as well. May make again as is a great way to use up leftovers with things I usually have on hand. My parents were over and stayed for dinner and I got rave reviews on this one.

This was a convenient dish - I used smoked turkey breast, shredded. Didn't have the mushrooms, so I incorporated some red & yellow bell pepper (frozen) and substituted 1/2 of the chicken broth with smoked turkey broth. This was a fun dish that my husband and son both enjoyed.

Not a pretty dish... (maybe because I used skim milk and multigrain spaghetti noodles so it had a gray hue to it).

This is the third year in a row that I've made this with the leftover turkey. I saute a few cloves of garlic and a half an onion and add it to the white sauce - and use lots of fresh herbs - sage, thyme, marjoram, oregano. Otherwise I feel it is a bit bland.

I used the basic recipe, but did a few things differently: Make a white sauce using as much as you think you'll need with the amount of turkey you have. Sautee 1 large clove of garlic with butter and use chicken bouillon instead of salt. I didn't need the broth. Skim milk makes a pleasantly rich white sauce when parmesan cheese is added. I layered a buttered baking dish with the spaghetti, mushrooms, turkey and then SWISS CHEESE pouring half the sauce on top; then made another layer in the same succession finishing with rest of sauce. Top with canned french-fried onions. Bake as directed. DELICIOUS!

One of the best cooking compliments I have ever had was about my turkey tetrazzini (the second was my pecan pie after people had visited New Orleans!). I have loved this dish ever since my mother "cheated" and bought a Stouffers! However, this recipe omits the MAIN ingredient : celery. Sauté the mushrooms and celery (tons of both - and I mean tons!) in butter and then add the white wine. Simmer until very soft, then add your broth/white sauce mixture, with the turkey (shredded by hand). (My secret for the buttered crumb topping : freeze french bread loafs, then put in the food processor (frozen!) for perfect fresh bread crumbs - sauté in salted butter. The "Joy of Cooking" has a very good basic recipe. I have spent years improving it. I am serving it to 10 French people Saturday night!

I disagree with my California brethren. I found this recipe to be moist and quite flavorful. It was a hit. I also used portobello mushrooms which added a hearty flavor. One problem though, is with the spaghetti. Next time I would break the dried pasta in half, or use a different shape that can be scoooped out of the casserole dish easier.

The idea of "comfort food" using leftover turkey seemed appealing, but the result was not. Following the recipe to the letter produced a dish that was dry and unappetizing. Taste-wise it was not bad, but I doubt I could get anybody to go to the well again on this one.

Got left over turkey from Christmas or Thanksgiving? This is an excellent dish for preparing the leftovers. Definitely a keeper, and one that you will have in the back of your mind when you refrigerate leftovers from the holidays. We made it with chicken from scratch the first time (no leftovers), but have made it many times since with our holiday windfalls. Very, very good.
