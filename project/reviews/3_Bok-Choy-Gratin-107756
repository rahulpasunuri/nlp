I've made this recipe a few more times w/ minor changes and it's now become one of my favorites. I mix half of the mornay sauce in with the greens and spread the remainder on top. This melds veggies and sauce together and makes the whole thing taste delightfully cheesy. I also double the breadcrumb topping, for extra crispy contrast. I've used swiss chard, kale, chinese mustard and bok choy. I also like to add thinly sliced potatoes and/or turnips into the boiling water before adding the stems from the greens. The potato/greens combo is fantastic and will make anyone love leafy greens. Doing the shallot step in the pan you used for the greens will eliminate one extra pan. Still, this makes a lot of dishes.

this was weird but surprisingly good. I used very sharp cheddar instead of gruyere and only cooked the bok choy for a minute or so, since it wasn't totally mature. My main critique would be it's somewhat unappealing appearance. It had a 1970s casserole look: a greens layer under a creamy white expanse dotted with clumps of breadcrumbs. My fiancee and I were both skeptical when it came out of the oven, but it tastes much better than it looks. Twice as many breadcrumbs would probably help. Also, the greens cook down a lot, especially once you squish the water out so you really need the full 2 1/2 lbs. I had a glut of bok choy from the garden, and this was a nice way to use it up in a non-asian way. It's not the best use of bok choy, so I probably wouldn't make this if I didn't have extra bok choy in my fridge. Stir-frying it with a little garlic is much easier!

This is fairly labor intensive, and I agree with the cook from Long Island...lots of pans. However, if you take the time to get all the water out of the bok choy, you will be pleased with the results. It was creamy and delicious and my two teenage girls even liked it. I will make it again.

This turned out really well. I used 1% milk and cheddar/feta/Parmesan cheese combo and it was great.

I would never have anticipated that bok choy and cheese would go together, but this was delicious. The bok choy was tender and not at all bitter. Actually, it ceased tasting like bok choy once smothered in the cheese sauce. Although an easy dish, there were many steps, and many pans to wash!

This is a terrific way to use a huge head of bok choy. I used locatelli romano, feta and kerry gold swiss as a substitue for the gruyere/parmesan combination. A tip: After parboiling the bok choy, drain it in a colander, put it into a dish towel and squeeze it dry.

This was a very tasty dish. I used good quality cheddar in place of the gruyere and onion in place of the shallot. I also added garlic and extra nutmeg and used low fat milk. Easy to prepare. Was a big hit with my husband.

Don't let the first reviewer put you off; this is a fantastic dish. And in point of fact (correct me if I'm wrong), it's not such a bizarre concept- I've seen plenty of french and italian recipes for greens prepared in this manner, and bok choy after all, even though it is an "asian green" is still a green. I've made this plenty of times and it's always been a big hit.

My Mother in law made this at our last family gathering and it was a big hit. Not typical of how bok choy is served but yummy never the less. She used smoked gouda. Even my brother , who is a chef from NYC, had second helpings.

We don't eat enough greens and this was delish! we will absolutely make this again. The key is to squeeze ALL the water out of the bok choy. yum!

I made some changes - smoked gouda instead of gruyere cheese, added some leeks (cooked for about 2 minutes), and the result was more than satisfying, especially since it was the first time bok choys was used in our kitchen. Even my 6 years old liked it!

Based on the earlier review, I made a substantial effort to dry the bok choy. I used paper towels after pressing. I also allowed it to dry in the pan. Being on the Adkin's diet, we used flaxseed meal instead of bread crumbs. Still, it was very good. If you are on a low fat diet, this is not for you. It is very "cheesy". For us, it was great.

I tried this recipe because it looked like a pretty bizarre concept. I was right. A one fork rating is too generous for this. The bok choy was soggy and does not go well with bechamel. My husband laughed when I said I was making bok choy gratin and laughed even harder when he tasted it. YUCK!
