I made these tonight and they were delicious.

I used leftover chili shrimp in these and we loved them. The flavor is so fresh. I'm giving just 3 forks because I did not make the sauce and served with sweet chili sauce instead. They looked kind of ugly because I need a little more practice with the spring roll wrappers (!), but I'll surely make these again.

I loved this and we devoured these as an appetizer last night. Two recommendations, however: I would plan for more filling and also think that I'll try sauteing shallots next time. I combined all the ingreds for easy assembly and it was fine. One caveat, which is why I only gave it three forks is that the sauce is hideous! I served these with my standard spring roll sauce and they were incredible. It's super easy: I cup water 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 cup distilled white vinegar 1 T minced garlic 2 t. chili paste with garlic Let first 4 ingreds boil and then simmer for 20 minutes, then add chili paste with garlic-- YUMMM.

I love this recipe! I made it again just a few days ago and one of our friends kept talking about how "happy" his mouth was. He, and all the others , ate up every one. Oh, I have been making these yummy bites for several years.

This was soooooo easy to make and was an enormous hit when I served it. Everyone loved the rolls and the sauce. I made way too much food at this party, but I think all but two of the rolls were eaten.

These absolutely stole the show at my last dinner party. They looked great (making spring rolls doesn't take much practice) and tasted wonderful. The dipping sauce is perfect. Make sure to use the fresh herbs.

A great dish with plenty of possilities and substitutions. It's also a great meal for company and larger groups, good social food. Plus always an option with vegetarians in the crowd.

If you eat this, you won't care if it's authentic or not. It's great! The dipping sauce was the only thing left, and we drizzled that on top of Thai rice for lunch the next day. highly recommended.

I've been a huge fan of vietnamese fresh spring rolls for years and have my own recipe. Authenticity aside, this recipe is delicious and a huge hit. I made 100 of these for a big party and not one was left. I recommend providing guests with two dipping options - peanut is always popular!

I haven't made this one yet, but I have appreciated everyone's comments. One thing to remember..this is Vietnamese STYLE, it doesn't say it's authentic. Without diversion, we would never have gotten pizza or chow mein noodles. While it's important to learn the traditional way and to honor your heritage, it's also OK to give someone elses' a tip of the hat.

simple and great, who could ask for more?

Too many people overly concerned with the "authenticity" of this recipe. Just make it and eat it. It's good!!

Personally, I learned more from reading the reviews than the actual recipe. By combing the wisdom of previous cooks and adding our own twist (replacing the cucumber with julianned carrots and using thai peanut sauce from Trader Joe's) we turned heads with this recipe. It was a HUGE hit! Just an FYI, the mint and cilantro seem to be the pungent kick needed make this special.

Lisa is right. It's not typical Vietnamese. I wasn't sure why they weren't quite right however, until my Vietnamese friend told me what was wrong. I also bought the stinkiest possible fish sauce (the Hong Kong grocer didn't have the Filipino kind I like) by accident. My friend also told me that the rolling instructions were backwards. Now in defense of the recipe, it's not a horrible-tasting recipe. It's just confused. It's like the use of chicken in a gyro (also available on this site). It's not quite right and it slaughters tradition, but it doesn't taste terrible. Now I know and I can make spring rolls properly... and they taste better!

Yummers!! I tripled the recipe and prepared this for a party of 12. It took quite a bit of time to prepare, but so worth the wait! I went to a local Asian market to buy the rice wrappers - the brand that worked really well is "BANH TRANG" Spring Roll Skins and used 1 each time to wrap and only tore 3. If you work on two at a time this is ideal vs. laying them all out at once. I also added carrot slices for color/taste and for the sauce: a jar of hoisin sauce with a little white wine, sesame oil and sugar to taste (made extra for dipping) & drizzled the sauce, sprinkled peanuts on top of the rolls. My friends all asked for a copy of the recipe so I knew it wasn't just me, they tasted great!

I am Vietnamese and have grown up eating true Vietnamese spring rolls. I agree with Lisa from California...this recipe is incorrect...not a true and authentic Vietnamese recipe. Lisa's suggestions are more accurate than the recipe provided. For those of you having difficulty rolling with the rice paper----do not overfill! One rice paper is more than adequate. You also do not need to use hot water...cold water works well, just let it sit a minute or two and the rice paper will soften.

I am Vietnamese and this recipe is totally wrong! Literally this dish is translated as Shrimp Salad Roll. The correct sauce is Hoisin sauce mixed with some vinegar, water and bring to a boil, and adjust seasoning with salt and sugar. Add some crushed peanuts and pickled carrot and daikon and chili. Also the shrimps are boiled, not saute. To wrap, place some rice noodles, bean sprouts, herbs (mint, cilantro, basil leaves..), lettuce and shrimps. Sliced boiled pork is also included.

One of the secrets to spring rolls is to keep a large skillet of simmering hot water nearby. Dip the skin in hot water for about 5 seconds and take it out with tongs before it goes limp. Put it on a very damp clean kitchen towel and let it rest 30 seconds. Make sure you remove the rib from the lettuce and don't let anyting sharp protrude beyond the lettuce leaf before you start wrapping.

These are NOT supposed to be fried. I also agree that hoisin/plum sauce is the dipping sauce of choice and recommend that you sprinkle chopped nuts into it. Bean sprouts give it a nice crunch and for spice we add chili sauce to the sauce.

Two wrappers is key. Also, the sauce isn't right. We added about another 1/4 cup of water and a teaspoon of sugar. But the first incarnation was FAR too intense.

Once you learn how to handle the wrapper it's a piece of cake!

I agree that Vietnamese Spring Rolls are supposed to be deep fried and can't imagine eating spring roll wrappers uncooked. The recipe that I have used for about 20 years has bean thread, water chestnuts, scallion, ground pork and crab meat mixed together and rolled up in the wrappers. It is then fried to a golden brown and dipped in a Nuoc Nam Sauce made of hot chili pepper, garlic, lime, rice vinegar and fish sauce. It is so good!

This recipe rocked! However I found it hard using just one sheet. I used two and it was a lot easier to roll them up! Very good!

for a "true" vietnamese spring roll, steam some pork & slice thinly. also boil some thin rice noodles. add these 2 ingredients while rolling. you're supposed to use hoisin dipping sauce w/this recipe but fish sauce is fine. for the fish dipping sauce, a variation is substitute the shrimp w/baked monkfish (no pork). bake a whole monkfish w/ginger, salt, and scallions.

These Spring Rolls are as good if not better than many we have had while dining out. Along with the dipping sauce shown, we also served the one described with the "SALMON SPRING ROLLS WITH CORIANDER DIPPING SAUCE" recipe. Fantastic combination!

I think you've confused summer rolls with spring rolls. Spring rolls are typically deep fried. Summer rolls are also served with a peanut-hoisin sauce, not a fish sauce.

I compare these spring rolls to my favorite vietnamese resturant in Kansas City, Mo its on 39th street and its called Saigon 39, its not a charming or uppity place, but my god the food is out of sight!!!! I especially love MiMi's (the owner/operator) spring rolls......... This recipe is the closest in comparison!I have wanted to make them for as long as I can remember and now I have it!!! Thanks!
