This was pretty good. I left out the porcinis because I don't usually like them. I subbed sage for the thyme and I added a little white wine to deglaze after the mushrooms and then more while I was cooking the sauce. I cooked the pasta only halfway in water and then I transferred it to the mushroom mixture to let the noodles absorb the sauce as they finished cooking. It was pretty tasty. My only complaint is that it took much longer than 6 minutes to brown the mushrooms.

I made the following adjustments to this recipe: I had only fresh oyster mushrooms & criminis, no dried. I substituted mushroom broth for the chicken broth and mushroom liquid. I also added about a cup of madeira wine to deglaze the pan after the mushrooms were browned. Having no hard cheeses or fresh thyme around the house I also added about 2 teaspoons of onion & chive goat cheese and substituted sage for the thyme.

i was very happy with how this turned out. i was looking for something to make with ingredients we had around the house; i didn't have porcini mushrooms but i used a pound of fresh baby bella mushrooms and added in chicken as well. i also used 2c chicken broth (rather than broth plus reserved mushroom liquid) since i had skipped the porcini step. this was very simple and tasty - will try this again with the porcini mushrooms.

This was quite tasty. I added peas to the recipe (at the very end, frozen). Make sure you soak your dried mushrooms for a long time if you are using them. I didn't and they were slightly chewy. It was still a good change up for a pasta during a week night. I will make this one again.

We are mushroom lovers and thought this was very tasty. I will try using some white wine instead of all or part of the broth next time but otherwise wouldn't change a thing.

Way too much pasta for the sauce. Others who soaked the dried mushrooms in chicken broth had a good idea. Mostly this is a wonderful recipe if you cut down on the pasta or increase the amount of sauce.

Loved it! The local market was out of thyme so I used rosemary. I soaked the porcini in chicken broth; I also added a little more of the reserved liquid when boiling the sauce, as it was verging towards 'sauteed mushrooms' instead of 'mushroom sauce'. Served on top of homemade fettucine, and YUM! Very strong mushroom flavour (I used portabello and shitake mushrooms).

This recipe was wonderful. I made a slight change. I soaked the porcini mushrooms in red wine instead of water. I think it gave it an added flavor.

Very good, fairly simple recipe. Used fresh sage in place of thyme. At end of cooking time, sauce was still a little thin. Added about 1/4 cup cream for added thickness and a bit more richness. Also, used a shallot at very beginning, browning a bit before adding garlic.

I liked this recipe quite a bit. I added a bit of fresh oregano because I only had dried thyme. Next time, I think I will soak the porcinis in broth (or possibly some wine) instead of water for a bit more flavor. I also used Locatelli Romano instead of Parmesan--I think that helped give a sodium boost that it probably needed.

This was an excellent dish and fairly simple to prepare. The wild mushrooms were a bit pricey and I was afraid of being disappointed with the end result, but it turned out being quite tasty. It makes for a good vegetarian meal or when you just don't want anything too crazy. I will definitely make this dish again.

I totally agree with "A Cook From Chicago" (5/17/00.) This recipe sounds great in theory, but cannot deliver. Once the sauce gets tossed with the pasta, it becomes very bland. Not a memorable dish.

I had such high hopes for this recipe, but alas it fell short. I just didn't think the final product lived up to its ingredients. The strong flavor of the porcini got lost, as did the other mushrooms. I love mushrooms, but I wouldn't make this again. It's just too bland for my tastes.

Very simple and tasty. I've made it with fettucine and bow-ties...just as good both ways. I found it easier if the mushrooms where coarsely chopped instead of sliced and since dried porcini where to expensive I eliminated them all together. Still a big hit.

This is great if you are a real mushroom lover. At first when I added the pasta I thought that there wasn't enough mushroom sauce, but the pasta absorbed most of the liquid and took on an amazing flavour. I will definitely be making this on a regular basis.

Great, fresh flavors in this dish - good as an main course or as a side dish. Use homemade/fresh pasta for best results. My boyfriend (a confirmed carnivore) loves this dish!

This was good, just not a show stopper. The sauce on its own is great but once tossed with pasta it gets lost. I would use less pasta than the recipe calls for and make the sauce a little bolder next time.
