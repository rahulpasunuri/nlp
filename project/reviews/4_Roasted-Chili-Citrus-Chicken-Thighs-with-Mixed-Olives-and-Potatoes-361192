My family loved this recipe!I followed the advise of other reviewers and only used half the amount of olives. I served it over rice with a green salad and Chardonnay (its what I already had). I will be making this again!

Great dish. Really tasty but be careful of salt as the olives contribute a lot of salt on their own. I also eased up on the chili pepper powder which worked well. Did not use the smoked Paprika, but not sure what that would have added.Will try the Chilpotle powder that was suggested by another review.

Very mediocre...the marinade had a pasty, powdery flavor when cooked and even with the chili powder cut down to 1 heaping teaspoon, it was too hot...and we LOVE spicy food. I used a Chipotle powder that I use frequently but neither my husband or myself like or would make this dish again.Unexceptional, at best.

Great flavor and so easy. My choices of chipotle chili powder, sweet smoked paprika & hot smoked parika made for a very spicey dish -- but serving with a dollop of sour cream 'tamed' the heat. I used boneless skineless chicken thigh and baby dutch potato that I did not par boil, but just cut into wedges and roasted with the chicken -- followed cooking temp and time and it was perfect. Was wondering about adding the chicken broth in that shallow lip of a pan, but no problem, nor with the reduction of the sauce on the stovetop. Will definitely make again.

Very, very good flavor. I subbed capers for the olives and loved the spicy-sweet-salt/brine results.

This is very good. I followed the advice of eliminating the olives (and gravy). It came out great. There is a Mexican flare to the flavors and I could see forgoing the potatoes and serving with tortillas instead.

This was mighty tasty. The only quarrel I have with the recipe is that the olives added absolutely nothing to the dish and seemed to be unnecessary. The chili seasoning of the chicken and potatoes was sufficient.

Amazing! I make it with some thighs and some boneless breasts. It doesn't need that many olives, I use about half. I've made it twice, and used sweet potatoes both times. So good! I like to add 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes for heat. MAKE THIS!

Easy and great flavors - a keeper. I used chipotle chili powder instead of smoked paprika and it was nice and spicy. I'd also suggest cutting down the number of olives - to about half. We paired this with a light Riesling and it was terrific.

I served this on Halloween, calling it "Roasted Chili-Citrus Giant Bat Thighs with Assorted Pickled Eyeballs." It was good, but near as good as many of the other dishes I have found at Epicurious. I like lots of spices, and that's why I was attracted to this recipe, but I think that the chili powder overpowered the other spices. Also, it was WAY too many olives.

This was so good I cannot believe it only because it sounds so so. My husband wanted to invite 10 people over to have this the next night because the flavors are so intense and right. The blends of the paprikas and juices really work well together. I am going to have some close friends over like 12 to serve this but I am a person that likes to have dinner parties where I am not in the kitchen, which is my old name, so we will see what they all think maybe while I cook I can serve them wine to entertain themselves.

I use this spice mix to coat chicken pieces for roasting and making chicken enchiladas.

I made this for company, and had to restrain myself from complimenting myself! I thought it was a wonderful combination of flavors and textures. I couldn't find my Bon Appetit magazine tonight but will refer to this on-line version often. Delicious, and a definite go-to for me!

This dish was good, but not great. Didn't really think that the olives went with the flavours, so I probably won't add them next time. Very easy to put together and great for a quick weekday meal.
