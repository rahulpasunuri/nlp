The recipe needed more kick so I added finely shredded ginger and red chile peppers to the slaw veg mix and a little more rice vinegar to the dressing.

Needed a little more oomph so I added about 1 Tbsp of Cilantro, and 1/4 cup of chopped dried chili mango (Trader Joe's). Delightful. Although there was a little too much dressing, so I put that over some brown rice. Yum.

this is a great cole slaw recipe, I would serve the dressing separately as it wilts down very quickly, great flavors though

Great refreshing recipe. Added some snow peas sliced very thin, and some red peppers. Great way to get your fiber.

I really enjoy a mayo free coleslaw, and this one was delicious! We omitted the peanut oil and added some grated carrot. Very good as a side for burgers.

my husband is a picky eater, and this is one of his favorite things that i make. we make it often in the summertime - very refreshing! i also add the red peppers which are nice for added color.

Yummy and refreshing! I made a few changes. Added olive oil instead of the peanut oil, added more sesame oil,sliced almonds, sesame seeds, red pepper and threw in a package of cooked soba noodles. You could also throw in some cooked chicken. Play with the seasonings a bit. Maybe more onion and salt and pepper. It's a keeper!

The Napa cabbage makes quite a mess. I would make this again, but using red cabbage.

Very tasty. I also added the red pepper, & sesame seeds, as well as shredded carrot. After resting to develop flavor, last minute I tossed with some crispy chow mein noodles. Yum!

Amazing recipe! Substituted regular ginger for pickled ginger and made it that much better.

A perfect complement to Bacon-Wrapped Salmon with Wilted Spinach. We loved the Napa Cabbage for its delicate crunch. I saved the leafy parts of the head for other things, and there were no leftovers, so wilting was not an issue. I'll never go back to heavy cabbage for slaw again, so the suggested variations will be interesting.

I made this over the summer and it is DE-LISH! Didn't change a thing and it was a huge hit. Even with people who aren't big veggie fans.

Simple, to be sure, but in this case simple means clean and refreshing. I served it with a spicy tofu, veggie and ginger stir fry and was a perfect light compliment. Although the Napa cabbage does wilt quickly, its texture was a nice change from the harder ordinary green cabbage. Be sure to drain/dry the cabbage to avoid excess water in your dressing. My personal preference is for less dressing, so I ended up adding another 2-3 cups of the cabbage. Very, very tasty. As other reviewers suggest, it could use some color, but the flavor is great. Will most definitely make again.

This slaw was absolutely fantastic! A genorous amount of ginger really gives it a punch. I never got a second helping because the three men at the table ate it all before I could get more. I will make this again and again for guests (and my husband). I don't know why anyone wouldn't like this slaw.

Can you get a more healthful recipe than this? I think not and so simple and good. Eating a bit of this with your meal is cleansing to your bod and perfect with a protein dish and rice.

had this at my sister in laws last night and loved it. She added shredded carrots and shredded spinach and she minused the green onion. Excellent

I replaced the ginger with a little peanut butter and it was wonderful. Instead of cabbage I used broccoli slaw, a great variation!

Great light variation on coleslaw. You'll like it if you like sesame oil!

Although this is a fast-and-easy recipe, it was very boring. I completely agree with the reviewer from Westlake Village, the Super Slaw on this website is much, much better.

I have made this dish twice as a compliment to grilled chicken. Great summertime dish. Especially good the next day. Don't skimp on the fresh ginger.

I used red cabbage and not only was it beautiful to look at with the green onions and the purple cabbage, it tasted clean and refreshing. I added more sesame oil - use one tablespoon - and use the toasted sesame oil if you can find it. I also added more ginger and sliced green onions than the recipe called for. I served the coleslaw with hoisin sauce chicken and even the kids (who are 5 and 9) ate it!

Not a favorite in our house - way too bland. I have also made the Super Slaw and IS excellent - try it. This recipe is not worth the effort.

Someone tried to mess with a classic..Before you commit to this one conduct a recipe search under coleslaw and you'll find that other BETTER recipe...it uses peanut butter- don't be scared- in the dressing...also stay away from the Napa cabbage it wilts too fast and gets way too watery. Use a real white cabbage and for color try adding a red one as well.

This is a simple recipe and very nice. I make a version that I like better using ramen noodles and diced chicken.

My mom and I prefer another recipe for Asian coleslaw. This one just doesn't compare. Look for it in the July 1998 Bon Bon Appétit under the Super SLaw listing.

This is an easy recipe that someone tried to make difficult. To make this recipe easy and delicious use pre-packaged shredded cabbage (mixed with carrots if you prefer)toss with the dressing. Before serving add toasted slivered almonds and sesame seeds(Toast the seeds and nuts on a dry cookie sheet in the oven which has been preheated to 350). Good luck, it will be a hit!

Definitely needs color. Try shredding carrots, or adding thin-sliced red pepper to the slaw, like the spicy cumin slaw also on this site.

I gave it three forks ONLY after I added about 3-T of toasted sesame seeds, a can of drained mandarin oranges and about 1/4 cup of thawed, frozen peas.

This is a little on the simple side. I think it is a base from which to work adding other ingredients especially some with color. It's easy to assemble and I liked it because it went with the incredibly delicious salmon burgers with hoisin and ginger also on this site.

This was easy and good. I made it for a bbq along with fruit salad and korean ribs.
