I've made this many times- and always to rave reviews. Sometimes I substitute half the shortening with pesto. That makes a great, savory side dish with soup or salad. Sometimes I add frozen raspberries and a little brown sugar. That's good too.

enjoyed the bannocks, family ejoyed them as a change of pace over bread at our meals. Makes a good addition to brown bag lunches for the kids and hubby as they travel well.
