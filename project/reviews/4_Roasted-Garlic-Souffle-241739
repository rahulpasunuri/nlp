I LOVE this dish and although it may sound complicated, once you get the first one done, going forward the souffle won't seem so intimidating.

Beautiful! I made this as part of the menu, and did take a little bit of work, but no more than the 2-1/4 hours stated, and was well worth it. Light, fluffy, just slightly crispy, tangy with cheese and nutty with the wonder that is roasted garlic. Indeed one does reek of garlic all the day after.

I have made this a few times for dinner parties, and it is always a winning dish & there is rarely any left at the end of the evening. i didn't think it was that time-consuming. helpful if you roast your garlic in the morning and prep everything (grating, etc) so it makes the dish come together quickly later in the day.

I made this today for lunch, and although i accidentally doubled the flour, it tasted fantastic... just had to cook a lot longer... but i have a question: What is the texture of the inside of a souffle supposed to be like? Spongey? Hard? Gooey? Someone please email me at sure.burne@yahoo.com and let me know. Thanks..

I made this in individual ramekins for a dinner party and it was well received. While it has "4" potential, I think the fact that I accidentally used reduced-fat milk instead of whole compromised the final product. While it's a fair amount of work, it is such a unique side that it's worth it.

I loved this!!! It was crave- worthy.

The only drawback to this recipe was that my mom/boss said I reeked of garlic for most of the next day. I loved the recipe though. While it definitely isn't a simple dish to prepare, if you, like me enjoy the process as much as the reward, this is the recipe for you.

I thought this had a great taste. Didn't mind the work because when it is done you can feel great about yourself. I Will make it again. If you need a cooking ego boost, make this.

We made this as directed and thought it was delicious. Liking garlic is a prerequisite. My autistic son loved it and said it was like eating "garlicky biscuit vapor." Aspies are notoriously honest so I can trust him to not sugar coat his comments. There were only 4 of us and the soufflé was gone by the end of the meal.

This took some work, and I'm not sure if I would make it again but, I made it for Easter dinner and everyone else LOVED it. There was none left. It's very rich and very good.

Looks beautiful but tastes only so-so. Overall not worth the effort and the clean up. Next time will go back to making Garlic Bread Pudding also on this site which is much better tasting and much less time (and pot) consuming to make.

This was a great side dish. Most good things to eat take time and work. The rewards are superfantastico. We had the entire menu except I substituted venison racks instead of lamb WOW. The souffle was perfect and what a great left over. I would make this, will make this many more times

This was quite good, BUT a heck of a lot of work. I think the "45 minutes of active time" only counts if you have a sous-chef to do all the grating, whipping, etc. Also it uses every pot in the kitchen. I have to say the "value for effort" just isn't there for this one, so I will probably not be making it again.

Made this for my girlfriend, having never made a soufflé before. It turned out great; she was very impressed. I roasted the garlic the day before. Don't be intimidated out of making this by the word "soufflé".

this was awesome. I had never made a souffle before, but it turned out perfectly. I used romano instead of parmesan and made the bechamel a day ahead. My only tp would be to make sure the garlic is REALLY well roasted so that the inner cloves are nice and soft.
