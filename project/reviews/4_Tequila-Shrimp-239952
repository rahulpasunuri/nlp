This was terrible. I made it for guests and was very upset. It was like we were eating tequila for dinner.

This was delicious, but most importantly, it was exceptionally easy! I did not marinate the shrimp -- followed the recipe exactly except that I didn't have either crema or sour cream so I put in a splash of half & half. The thicker cream would have been better, but as it was, I served the shrimp and cream over brown rice with a squeeze of lemon. Yummy! One bit of advice -- the flames go *really* high, so be sure that your stove fan is off and you remove it from under any potential fire hazard -- I have an overhead microwave with fan which tends to accumulate grease. If I had left the fan on, I'm afraid it would have sucked up the flame and might have caused a fire! Since you are supposed to remove from heat before igniting, I suggest you first take it from underneath the hood. But be sure to light it where your guests can watch -- it is really spectacular! Tasty, easy and impressive -- the perfect recipe for entertaining or an quick weeknight dinner.

Fantastic! I made this with a fillet of white fish rather than shrimp, but it still came out perfect. Very memorable for both the unique flavor and the fun of lighting it on fire. Boyfriend loved it, (booze and fire - who wouldn't?) requests it often now.

Used sour cream, cooked frozen shrimp, tequila blanco and lime juice as previously suggested. So quick and easy! Would highly recommend marinating the shrimp, the dish does need a little assistance, but nothing elaborate. Hot sauce maybe? More veggies?

Fast, easy and much better than anticipated! Since the prep and execution time is so minimal, it would be a great main for a low key dinner party with friends.

update: I wrote below about marinating shrimp (as others suggested) but there being too much liquid...I made this again, without the lime juice pre-soak, and it was amazing. First b/c the alcohol burned for a lot longer. The poster who mentioned her partner feeling drunk, well...maybe he was getting buzzed b/c the flames went on for a lot longer than I was used to and there wasn't a hit of alcohol flavor by the end, just pure lusciousness. It might work to try and drain/dry off the shrimp, but it tasted great made as the recipe suggests for us and I won't bother with that step again...

I have put together a recipe similar to this for years, I followed this for a change, Wonderful. My recipe just alters this by adding Salsa at the end of the cook time and tossing it over pasta. Yum; nice to have the variety

Excellent dish. We made the whole menu, with the black bean cakes and steamed green beans and rice. My husband observed before we dug in that he would enjoy it just for the presentation, even if it tasted horrible. But it was all great, and I'm looking forward to a shrimp taco or two with the leftovers!

This was such a simple, delicious recipe. I highly recommend following other reviewers' suggestion of marinading the shrimp in lime juice before cooking. I made this with the Panfried Black Bean Coriander Cakes, spooning the shrimp mixture on top-wonderful!

I let the shrimp sit in lime for about 10 minutes before cooking. I tried to pat them dry before cooking, but there was a lot of liquid in the pan, so I drained a lot of that (along with some butter) before adding the tequila. I'm not a big fan of fire, so I had my boyfriend light the tequila. It actually went pretty well, my kitchen did not go up in flames! The flaming tequila smelled really great. I found crema at the grocery store, so I used that instead of sour cream. It was all a bit runny at first, but letting it sit for a few minutes would help that. I served the shrimp over some leftover pasta, so that is alternative to rice. I made the black bean & coriander cakes also, they went well together.

This was super easy. Marinated in the juice of 1 lime and freshly ground salt. Dumped it in with the shrimp, used Reposado tequila, lit it on fire and used sour cream...personally I felt it was perfect but my hubby swore that he was getting a buzz from it. Tried explaining about burning the alcohol off, but I think next time I'll use half the tequila.

Rating: 4
easy. great and pretty hard to mess up. And I tried. I did marinate the shrimp in lime juice as one reviewer suggested for 10 minutes. Then I poured all the juice into the pan with the butter and that was a mistake BUT the dish was still amazing. The tequila burn-off wasn't as dramatic as it would have been, because of the extra liquid but my husband didn't know any better and he licked the plate. I stopped counting after the third time he said "This is soo good." Served with the Black Bean Cakes (as recommended in the epicurious weekday menu).

This was a very tasty meal. I tossed the shrimp with 1/4 tsp each of salt and pepper and 1/8 tsp sugar. Then I seared the shrimp for 1 minute on high heat in 1 Tb vegetable oil, took the pan off the burner, and turned the shrimp. Then I added 1 minced shallot and the tequila with the juice of 1 lime (great recommendation), and continued as the recipe indicates. The shrimp was cooked through but was not overdone; the texture was perfect. And my husband and I could add salt to our own plates according to taste. I am definitely doing this again.

This was awesome and so easy to prepare. The flavors were great and the theatrics of lighting a dish on fire were great for guests. I skipped out on the cream because of my guest's preference but it was still amazing.

Very strong tequila taste! Tastes better the second day doused in Tabasco.

Try this recipe...easy as pie and twice as fast! When we are in the mood for less subtle flavor, we add a little cayenne or Texas Pete hot sauce to give it an edge, and get a light pink color. Next time we will try the lime!

So little effort for lots of flavor! I served it with simple steamed rice, which takes on the flavor of the sauce nicely. It was a hit in this household!

This was absolutely fantastic. Because I love lime, I took a previous reviewer's tip and tossed the shrimp in the juice of one before cooking, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.

I was really excited to make this- seemed easy and quick. I hated it and so did the 3 people i made it for. I followed the recipe exactly. I do agree that lime and jalepano would have helped. I used patrone (love it to drink) and it was horrible.

Rating: 3
I made this dish with gold tequila and sour cream. I also marinated in lime juice for 10 minutes and added one jalapeno. The taste was very good but there was too much sauce left in the skillet at the end (the shrimp was drowned in sauce). Is this how this recipe is supposed to be or did I do something wrong?

I used the tips from the cook in Atlanta and my boyfriend requests this every week. I have made this dish about 6 times and it is always wonderful. Adding lime is key.

made as directed (used sour cream) and turned out good but tequila flavor a bit strong...may use less next time. served with coconut rice and corn and scallion salad. nice meal, could easily serve with plain rice as recipe makes plenty of creamy sauce.

Rating: 4
Simply fabulous! I have made this four times and it just keeps getting better and better. Last night I prepared it exactly as the cook from Atlanta recommended (including the delicious orzo) and it was an incredible hit. I found the gold tequila is less strong and imparts a more delicate flavor. For those having difficulty finding crema, and even in Boston I had some difficulty, it may be found in the Latin section of larger grocery stores near the canned coconut milk. I used canned Nestle Media Crema (Table Cream). This is truly a special dish!

Don't understand the hype on this one. With so many star ratings this shrimp lover was excited to try this one out. Followed recipe exactly. I even used actual crema and not sour cream. What a disappointment! I can think of many better things to do with tasty shrimp. Boyfriend said it was "okay". Roommate loved it and he hates Tequila!?

My husband and I have several favorite shrimp dishes (including the excellent Spicy Sichuan Shrimp from this site), and this is our new favorite. We made it exactly as outlined, and it was very easy and tasted great - a nice subtle blend of flavors. We did skip the rice on the side, and instead served it with corn, which was very nice blended together with the shrimp, scallions, and sauce.

Very tasty and easy, as well as dramatic. I agree with "Heidi4" in that there is no reason to continually tweak this--try it as it is, and you won't be disappointed. Don't overdo on the salt, though.

Second time making this recipe. This recipe dose not needs all the tweaking mentioned by others. Adding lime and chilis masks the flavor of the tequila The tequila, cream and shrimp flavors work great together. Just make something else if your gonna add 8 other ingredients. This is a simply delicious recipe the way it is. You're making it way too difficult!

This was excellent I used a high end anejo and sour cream. I also added lime juice and a few modest shakes of New Mexican chilie powder.

Delicious! We used the modification suggested by the cook from Atlanta, and it turned out fantastic. We used gold tequila instead of white, but it wasn't a problem. For the side we used a mix of wild and long grain rice. To the cook from Sausalito - reducing a sauce by boiling and flambe-ing produce very different results, so that might be the source of your disappointment.

Here is a Prawns Tequila recipe I like better: 24 large prawns (16-20 count, tails on) 2 Shallots, finely diced 1 serrano chili, grated paper thin 2 T Cilantro, chopped 1.5 cups Heavy cream, simmered and reduced to half 3 Cloves of Garlic finely chopped 1/2 cup White wine 2 oz. Tequila 1/4 cup Bell pepper, color (s) of your choice, julienned 14 Saffron threads 2 T Butter for saute 3 T Cold Butter salt to taste Melt 2 T butter in pan. Add shallots, cook over low heat until softened and cleared. Add Garlic - Do not brown - cook for one miniute. Add Serrano, cook a minute more. Add white wine and tequila and reduce by 50%. Add saffron and reduced cream, then add shrimp. Cook 2-3 minutes until shrimp are pink. Remove shrimp from sauce. Whip in cold butter 1 Tbs at a time, to emulsify in the sauce. Do not boil sauce after this step. Return shrimp to sauce pan to warm. Serve immediately.

This was very disappointing. I tweaked as per the instructions of the cook from Atlanta, but instead of flaming I just boiled the liquid for about 10 minutes to "burn off" the alcohol. We needed HEAPS of lime and even ended up adding some tabasco to pep it up. I used canned crema, not refridgerated. I can't rate something highly that has to be so severly modified, and even then was not that great.

Excellent!! We loved it - especially the flaming part. The only difficult part of this recipe, was finding the crema - it is not available in Eastern Canada, so I had to use sour cream.

Rating: 0
I tried making this last night. After the great reviews I feel like I'm missing out on something. I used gold tequila instead of white and was unable to ignite it. That may be because I used frozen shrimp and ended up with more liquid. I will try again with the suggestions from 'Atlanta'.

Rating: 4
How fun!!! We loved this and will be making it again very soon. I jokingly told my hubby to have the extinguisher ready, but didn't actually tell him about the flame - well, as he leaned over to see what was going to happen... I hope his eyebrows will grow back.

My husband liked this so much I made it two nights in a row, both times I soaked the shrimp in lime juice and the second night I added a little adobo sauce to the crema mexicana. My husband liked it best without the sauce but either way was good, the sauce just added a little spicyness and gave it some color.

added pureed chipotle with the crema at the end. fabulous!

Tasted great but a bit strong tequila flavor. Excellent the next day. I actually added the shallots and cillantro with a touch of lime juice prior to igniting.

I am posting again to answer the "crema" question. Crema is almost like sour cream, but not as thick. I'm in the middle of nowhere GA and can find it in my local grocery store. It is a mexican style cream. You can find it in the fridge section, sometimes near the processed cheeses. My local stores have recently put in a separate fridge in the ethnic/mexican section, where there is mexican cheeses and other items. Also, just ask your grocer if you can't find. The brand I used is the one I always see - Verola Crema Mexicana. Good luck!

I thought it was a bit salty, too, but not in an unappealing way. I'd probably reduce the salt a bit the next time I make it.

Absolutely delicious and SO easy!! I halved the recipe for two, and my husband looked around longingly for more. Didn't have any white tequila so used gold, which was fine. With steamed rice the flavor is amazing. Watch out for the flambe part, though; I nearly singed my eyebrows! -- quite a flame.

I made this recipe exactly as directed. It was fabulous. I also used high quality white shrimp from my local fish market and I can tell you, it made all the difference in the world. My guests were politely scrambling for the last of the shrimp and the sauce. I served it with steamed white rice... Wonderful!!!

This recipe was so easy and turned out AMAZING! My husband Loved it! I am a semi-pro chef so I did do a little tweaking. After sprinkling the shrimp (on both sides) with the salt and pepper, I squeezed 1/2 of a lime over them and let them sit for about 10 minutes. Once the I cooked the shrimp for about 3 minutes, I added 1 finely chopped shallot and 1 finely chopped jalapeno, cooked 1 minute and then flamed. Prior to adding the crema (do use the crema it makes a difference and you can find it in most local grocery stores), I added about 2T finely chopped cilantro, stirred in the crema. I ommitted the scallions and served with a squeeze of lime juice over each plate and another light sprinkling of cilantro. I can't eat rice, so I made orzo instead. I cooked the orzo in boiling chicken broth. I added saffron and a goya seasoning packet, salt, pepper and 2T of tomato paste to the broth, then the orzo and cooked it down until the orzo soaked up most of the broth. Delicious!
