Amazing flavors. I followed the recipe exactly and have had rave reviews from my guests who also happen to be food "snobs." One who dislikes cucumbers said she would pick them out, which is tough to do, forgot about them and gobbled them up as they blended perfectly with the melon, lime, and jalapeno.Definitely now listed in my favorites.

This was so good I had to have it twice in a week! It will go into high rotation during the summer. I used flatiron steak and a "Visa" melon and used about 1/2 t of jalepeno. Next time, I'll use 1 t jalepeno and make sure the melon isn't overripe, which made everything a little watery. I will also make sure the salsa/chutney is room temperature when serving - it's an unpleasant contrast if refrigerated. All these "mistakes" and it is still a definite keeper recipe!

Agree that the salsa is yummy, even with not as sweet as it could be melon. Steak had a nice flavour due to the seasonings, but not convinced that hanger steak is my fave.

The chutney was fresh and delicious but the steak needed way more seasoning or marinating time.I was honestly surprised how well the melon went with the meat and other veggies and so was my whole family. I think I am even going to use this chutney in a few other dishes ( I already had it with a warm naan and it was fantastic!).

The chutney was amazing (would make again) but the steak was kinda ordinary.

I used cubed tenderloin on kebob skewers and marinated the beef for several hours (used quite a bit more lime juice than called for). The chutney was brilliant and beautiful. Served it with the rice pilaf with rasins and pistachios (also from this site) because I thought the cardamom and turmeric and that recipe would accompany the curry lime flavors nicely. It all came together deliciously and colorfully. And so easy!

I love this recipe! Such interesting flavors-the curry, cumin, and honeydew are fantastic together. The first time I made it I was so impressed that I made it again for guests a week later. It was an enormous hit. The dish makes for a great presentation, but the best part is how crazy easy it is to make. Truly one of my favorites. I tried it once with some cantaloupe I had left over and mixed it with the honeydew. Not bad. It added some fun color; however, I think I prefer the honeydew solo. Either way, having a ripe, sweet melon is truly a must.

Simple, fresh, full of flavor! Did not include the melon, but will next time. I don't often use hanger steak, but this was fantastic. Will be a regular in the summer grilling rotation.

This dish was amazing. We made it along with the Sauteed Parsnips and Carrots with Honey and Rosemary. The only thing that we will add next time is a little bit of salt for the steak. We used Filet Mignon and it was very tasty, melts in your mouth. Will definitely make this again.

This is good and fresh for a summer dinner. I like the chutney on the side and so I do less honeydew and more cuke so it's less sweet and more of a balanced flavor. Serving the chutney atop the steak might need more sweetness.

We have prepared this dish twice: once with top sirloin and recently with flatirons. The latter won hands down! Be sure to marinate the steak in a large ziplock bag overnight as we did with the flatirons. In order to boost the color of the dish we serve it with "tomato corn scramble" also on epicurious. The red and yellow of this fabulous dish really pops the plate! At a recent dinner party all four couples asked for both recipes.

quick, simple and delicious!! i disagree about the chutney being "too green"; with a mound of jasmine rice, thinly sliced steak fanned around and the chutney on top i thought the colors were absolutely beautiful!! this dish seemed "interesting" to me at first...and it is!! but in a good way!! the curry and chutney seem like an odd combination but they definitely work together, i will surely be making this dish again soon.

This is an incredibly easy, interesting and delicious twist on grilled steak! We used two flat irons and marinated them for a couple of hours. I have to believe that the citrus tenderized the meat because they were the most tender flat irons (think tenderloin!) we've ever had with all of the flavor of a flat iron. The curry added warmth and a unique combination of flavors, especially when paired with the chutney. I used a whole cucumber from the farmer's market and seeded it. Also used a tiny little shallot instead of red onion for my onion hating hubby. Delish!

Delicious and so easy! I loved the spice of the curry on the steak-- it was not overwhelming as I feared. The chutney was fantastic. The combination of soft melon and crisp cucumber, and the spice of the jalapeno and onion was so good that I had it the next night on bratwurst. Out of this world. It improved overnight. I will be serving this at my next dinner party, since most everything can be prepared ahead of time, and I can throw the meat on the grill at the last minute. Yum.

This was great on salmon too! My husband loves steak and I love salmon. The chutney was delicious!

Excellent flavor combination! We used flant steak. Easy, delicious and has been a repeat at our house this summer.

I used a flank steak (marinated for 2 days) for this recipe and it was absolutely fantastic. The cool melon, hot peppers and curry steak make a wonderful combination of flavors. Next time, I'm going to try cutting the steak into bite-sized bits and mixing it with the chutney for a summer picnic salad.

Loved this recipe, is perfecto for a Saturday dinner party by the pool. I served it with a nice French Rose Wine. I was perfect meal.

The preparation for the meat was simple, which I liked very much because I made it for my youth group and time was limited. I didn't mix all the stuff together. I rubbed the meat with the lime directly all over. I sprinkled some salt, pepper, and the curry. I seared it in the pan and finished it in the oven. Simple, but great! The curry really adds a savory (slightly even sweet) note that was good. The melon-cucumber chutney was good also. I forgot the cilantro, which would have really made it. I added some red wine vinegar and lime juice just to give it a little acid. The only thing is that it's all too many shades of green! Delicious with the mean nonetheless.

The flavors go well together; the Chutney was great on a summer night. I used NY Strip Steaks instead of Hanger-- worked just as well; don't be affraid to substitute for the Hanger!

This is a question, not a review. I'm going to be serving this on Saturday night, and I'm trying to think of a wine that would pair well with this. I'm thinking of: a Montepulciano d'Abruzzo from Italy, a California or Australian cab sauv, or maybe a malbec from Argentina. Any suggestions?

Delicious. Husband loved it. A combination of spicy and cool and refreshing. I wasn't sure about curry with the steak but it was great and went well with the chutney.

I made this recipe for a dinner party and it was wonderful!

I prepared it exactly as printed and it was fabulous!! The chutney went very well with the beef and the lime-curry rub was excellent. I prepared the chutney about 6 hours early and let the rub sit on the steaks for the same amount of time. My husband nearly finished the 2 pounds of meat himself. Excellent recipe!

I made the curry mixture, but didn't use it because it just didn't seem to "go" with beef. Instead I marinated the hanger steak in a vinegar mixture. But the melon cucumber chutney is spectacular. I used cantaloupe and skipped the cumin (not my favorite spice.)
