made this last night. Quick and easy for a weeknight. I added red pepper flakes and garlic to the onion. I also used chicken stock for the pasta water, and then mixed the bacon entirely into the dish at the very end. No leftovers, and it was quick and easy.

So simple but so good. Great spring pasta. Added some chopped red pepper with the asparagus and swirl of white wine. Great easy recipe!

I liked this dish, it does need some adjusting though. The white wine idea is great, and I added some kick with extra hot red pepper and garlic. I also used fresh pasta instead of dried fussili (cintas, the flat firm noodles). My friends loved it!

This recipe is nothing special. I have had better versions of this type of recipe. I wouldn't do it again.

I've made this for my husband many times and brought it to pot luck dinners, everyone has loved the dish....especially the bacon flavor. I double the amount of bacon and cook it until it is crispy, I do NOT leave it in the pan, the crispness adds texture and flavor. I pour most of the fat out, leaving the bacon crumbs behind and use a little extra olive oil. I don't measure the cheese but I use close to double the amount called for and then sprinkle lots more on top.

I forgot to pour off most of the bacon grease so omitted the olive oil, but the bacon grease ended up overpowering the dish - otherwise I'd have given it more stars. I may try it again. Great suggestions to add garlic, hot pepper flakes and deglazing with wine.

The recipe could use a bit of acid, just to lighten the bacon flavor (I would never dare suggest using less bacon). Deglazing the pan with 1/4 cup white wine, or adding 2 tbps lemon juice will help. Also, left the bacon in the pan and added the onions earlier - saves the hassle of drying the bacon, etc.

This is an quick, easy dinner that my family loves. I mix the bacon in instead of putting it on top so it is equally spread throughout the dish.

I mixed the bacon in with the dish instead of a topping to spread the bacon flavor better and added a little more of the cheese. This is always a hit in my house.

nooo, don't make this recipe! it is painfully boring and the bacon flavor overpowers the entire dish. i'm not sure what can be done to save it.

added garlic (garlic & bacon rules) & red pepper flakes, deglazed with chicken stock (had no white wine) and the pasta water (pasta water helps thicken the sauce), finished with about a Tbsp of butter (the butter is the secret to a great pasta dish, adds a light velvety touch) Salt & pepper is always required - although the bacon & cheese will add salt so a gentle pinch is all. Used fresh grated Parmigiano reggiano. Turned out yummy.

Bland; I did add garlic, white wine, balsamic vinegar, chopped tomatoes, and crushed red pepper. I think perhaps the bacon needs to be increased. Overall, not terrible, just not a very exciting way to use these really good ingredients. I'll be eating the leftovers cheerfully, but I probably won't make this again-- there are better recipes out there.

I thought this recipe was a bit boring after I finished the dish, so i added a little garlic, crushed red pepper and a jar of imported tomatoes. The flavors were much more complex and tasty. I also threw in some peas. As stated, I wouldn't make this recipe again, but with these changes, I will.

Made this for dinner this evening after a quick trip to the farmers market for fresh vegetables! My husband and I loved it and will definitely make it again with the changes suggested by other cooks! Added garlic/ halved the onion/ added cayenne pepper and crushed red pepper and of course the white wine to deglaze. oh, yes and also used proscutto instead of the bacon. Very yummy!

Excellent easy recipe. I took other reviewers' recommendations and added 3 cloves of garlic, fresh thyme and parsley (just before serving), plus deglazed the pan with white wine. Also, very kid friendly. My daughter's nine year-old guest ate two hefty portions!

I made slight modifications to the base recipe, as suggested by many reviewers: I added 2 garlic cloves and cut the onion to 1/2. I also added some red pepper flakes and used white wine instead of water to deglaze the pan. I ran out of parmesan cheese, so I just added some grated swiss cheese to the final dish and allowed it to sit for a few minutes for the cheese to melt. I served it with sirloin tip roast. Quick, easy and delicious!

This was great, fast & easy. I wanted to use garlic as others suggested... but I was fresh out. I used half the amt of onions - and liked it that way. Also, I didn't have enough asparagus so I added a 15oz can of stewed tomatoes (after rinsing them). The tomatoes were a great addition! I imagine fresh or sun-dried tomatoes would be excellent!

A 3 1/2 with changes. I used pancetta instead of bacon, sliced thick enough to dice finely. Left out the onions, added a little garlic. At the end tossed with smoked mozarella. The smoky flavor of the cheese with the pancetta is yummy!

I loved it! Made it for a dinner party and at the end everyone was asking for the recipe! I also added some grilled chicken to the mix. It's quick and easy and I would definitely make this again.

This recipe is a real keeper, but I did change it. Followed the advice from other reviewers and I left out the onion, and added a couple of cloves of minced garlic and some red pepper flakes to the not quite finished asparagus, deglazed the pan with a splash of white wine and then added half a 14 oz can of organic chopped tomatoes. I let that cook together for just a few minutes, then added the pasta water and then the cooked pasta- but not a whole cup of the pasta water all at once. I think you have to add it a bit at a time to get the sauce to the consistency you like. Really, really wonderful - we like penne, so I used that. Will definitely do this again.

I didn't have fusilli so I used spaghetti. Tasted wonderful and I got kudos from my family and friends.

This was delicious. I used lardons (small rectangles of bacon that are common in Europe) instead of bacon and they worked well. A nice, unfussy spring supper. Served with a green salad and Italian bread.

Terrific easy supper. My husband (the chef) used a little white wine to deglaze the pan, and added some garlic to the onions and asparagus. First tasting was slightly bland, so we tried some Balsamic vinegar. Just the thing!

this is a great little recipe for those on the go. simple and fast but in need of some extra flavors. follow the directions to a tee... but add some of your favorite fresh herbs and veggies...I promise it will be much mo bedda if you do.

I used Virginia smoked bacon and sliced it fairly thick, didn't have an onion so I left that out. I thought this dish was great, really liked the bacon and asparagus flavors together. I also used some cayenne and some red pepper flakes, and a couple of cloves of garlic.

When the asparagus is fresh, this dish is unbeatable.

Added red pepper flakes and omitted the onion per the recommendations of other reviewers--the final result was a little bland, but still good and I'd probably make it again if I had the ingredients on hand as I did this time

So easy, so good, kick it up a little with some red pepper flakes.

Straight from the pages of Martha Stewart's Living magazine -- Gourmet adds the onion. Better without. The onion draws the bacon flavor that the asparagus needs to give it a rich, smoky saltiness. Leave the onion out... the flavors come together nicely. Try browing sweet italian sausage (casings removed) in place of the bacon for a heartier dish. Asiago cheese in place of the parm. Yummy.

I used some pancetta along with the bacon and this recipe was STILL extremely bland. Maybe I'm just tired of end-of-season asparagus.
