I make a lot of cheesecakes and felt this one was just ok. The grape topping was way too sweet. Next time I'd leave out the 1/4 c sugar. It also didn't look very pretty. I was expecting a deeper purple color. Maybe that's why they didn't show a picture of it in the magazine. The marscapone cheesecake part was delicious.

Very easy for a cheese cake. Would like to try next time w/ concord or black grapes - the red lost too much color when cooked. I reduced some of the grape juice as a drizzle sauce when plating up the dessert - added a nice touch.

Very tasty and simple cheese cake. The grape topping was almost too sweet, but the mascarpone was what made the recipe. I also tried serving each slice over crushed graham crackers for presentation instead of a baked crust.
