Wonderful! Halved the recipe and divided between 6 ramekins. They were not quite full, but that left room to top them w ice cream afterwards!

My friend wanted me to make this before he went for surgery. I halved the recipe, but I used a little bit more pear. 'Worked perfectly

I just made it 2 days in a row! Both times I just used ground ginger instead of the candied, and the second time put whole almonds soaked in honey, in the filling (and cut down the sugar measure). Also used all brown sugar. Delicious!

Delicious. Often with crisps, there is an uneven ratio of topping vs. filling. This, however is perfect. A few tips: - Use really ripe pears (D'Anjou or Bartlett; I used a mixture of the two) and halve the sugar. - Slice pears lengthwise in 1/4" slices, layer and arrange in a fan. I used a glass pie dish. It looks nicer and doesn't take much more time than cubing it. - I also placed a thin layer of brown sugar and butter on the bottom of the dish before layering the pear slices for more juice/sauce. I omitted the candied ginger (didn't have any on hand) and used ground ginger instead.

I'm not sure why the directions insist on having chunks of butter rather than letting the butter fully mix in with the topping. Next time I'm going to soften or melt the butter beforehand.

Great and easy--a nice alternative to pie for Thanksgiving. I used a mix of almonds and walnuts and it tasted great!

Excellent, with or without the ginger! This recipe is easily halved. Yum!!!

I made this exactly following the recipe and it came out superb! Candied ginger was a great addition. Next time I might try slicing the pears lengthwise into third of an inch thick strips so that it looks a bit fancier than chopped pears. Also, keep in mind the dessert is shallow- I may double or multiply the pears by 1.5 next time.

The Candied Ginger really added to the flavor!! I'll make this again

Excellent recipe and great alternative to the apple version of this dessert. I have made with and without the candied ginger and it's great either way.

While we really like ginger, the cubes of crystallized ginger just didn't work for us in this recipe. I even cut the chunks really small (using food processor) and the taste was too overwhelming. This might be one of the first desserts that I throw away. It's edible but not worth the calories. I usually have great luck with the epicurious recipes, but this was an exception.

Couldn't find crystallized ginger so I substituted with ground ginger instead. Served with 5 Spice Whipped Cream and Dulce de Leche Ice Cream. Big hit with the family. Will make again.

I have made this receipt a few times and was happy to see that it made the epicurious receipt of the day. I think that this is an excellent dessert though I prefer having a little bit more ginger added. I also agree with what a different reviewer had mentioned about not using Bosc pears. I do like how they stay crisp for days but prefer a softer texture from other cooking pears.

Excellent recipe! I usually make an apple crisp but I saw this recipe and thought I'd try it out on Thanksgiving. It was a major hit, was a little worried the kids wouldn't appreciate the ginger but it went over really well. I didn't have cornstarch, so I used flour and I will chop the ginger a little finer next time, maybe in the food processor as suggested by another reviewer, so quick that way!

One of the best fruit crisps I have ever made. I doubled the cinnamon (in both the filling and topping) and the crystallized ginger. I also made the topping entirely in the food processor -first chopped up the nuts with the ginger, then whizzed in the flour, sugar, cinnamon and salt, then pulsed in the butter, then finally added in the oats with just a couple of pulses. Easy. The finished product was divine. If I could say anything negative it was that the topping was a bit on the sweet side, but that might be because I doubled the crystallized ginger, which of course has a lot of sugar in it. Next time I'll reduce the amount of brown sugar in the topping to compensate. Very yummy.

We really enjoyed this dessert. I did think it was a little too sweet. I would probably cut the sugar down to no more than 1/4 cup for the filling although we had really nice, sweet, ripe pears to begin with. I like the topping with the nuts and ginger too.

Followed the recipe exactly though I did cook it with the convection setting in my dual fuel oven and it came out brown and beautiful right on time. The flavor was delicious and the pears were perfect. Great hot out of the oven with a litte ice cream and fab left over. I will definitely make this again.

My family loved it for Thanksgiving. Not too sweet, just simply delicious. I may add more cinnamon next time but I'm a cinnamon junkie so. . . .

This was the hit of my Thanksgiving dessert buffet party. Served it warm with whipped cream. I used bartlett pears. It was great warm and left over today.

I made this for Thanksgiving dessert and everyone loved it. A really easy recipe. I used Bartlett pears and they were great. They almost tasted like apples, but less sweet. Chop the ginger very fine and don't over mix the butter when making the topping- you want some butter chunks in there. Went well with whipped cream. Thought the cornstarch was fine. Didn't bubble very much, but it was not dry.

Omit the cornsstarch. Mix a stick of softened butter with a cup of brown sugar and the contents of a vanilla bean. Spread mixture in the bottom of the baking dish then add filling, top with crumble. Bake 50 minutes @ 400, if top is brown before time elapses, cover with foil. When ready serve it upside down on a platter. You'll have a lovely vanilla caramel sauce soaking into the crisp!!!

This is a pretty good crisp recipe, though it didn't live up to my expectations from the descriptions. Definitely follow the reviewer below's advice to chop up ginger into smaller pieces. I also had to cook for about 1:10 to get the top to brown. I think I will stick with my simpler crisp recipe--I think it has more flavor and it is definitely less work.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a Wow! I used d'Anjou pears and they were perfect. I also used flour instead of cornstarch, I think an improvement. We're going to have the leftovers for breakfast! I'll be sending this to my family members who love to cook and bake.

Absolutely delcious crisp! I used bosc pears and they didn't release enough juice for the crisp to bubble like the recipe says, so I ended up keeping the crisp in the oven for 1 hour and 20 minutes until the topping browned to a graham cracker brown. I think you could easily double the amount of candied ginger for some extra zip. I served it with ginger ice cream and everybody loved it.

Delicious, and even better a few days later with full-fat vanilla yogurt... Make sure you chop up the candied ginger finely so it is even throughout the dish. A perfect fall dessert.

Made this tonight for dessert and it was quite a hit!! Will definately make again. It was easy and made with ingredients I usually have on hand. Served it with vanilla ice cream.

This is so very, very good. The only change I made was to add a few fresh cranberries because I had them and to use pecans instead of almonds. The ginger in the topping makes it very yummy. This is a keeper to make over and over on cold fall and winter days.
