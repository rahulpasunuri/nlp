What a hit! Followed the recipe, couldn't have been easier. We have 4 boys, and one them, our Viking, usually only likes cookies with chocolate in them. He LOVED these.

I made these cookies on their own (I don't have a press, so I just rolled them in balls and cooked them like normal) and they were fabulous. Nice and buttery tasting! Even better, though, was when I tried a few additions like adding chocolate chips or maple syrup. The sweetness of either of these things blends PERFECTLY with the favour of the cookies. They're so nice that this is now my go-to recipe for chocolate chip cookies. Just lovely.

These cookies are so tender and delicious that we may eat them all tonight! Kids and adults in our household have given them 100% seal of approval. I followed the recipe exactly, rolled into balls, pressed with fork to make the crosshatch pattern and baked for 11 minutes. Yum! The flavor is subtle and perfect as is, but the recipe also lends itself easily to variations in flavor. I highly recommend trying this one.

I wanted to use my Pampered Chef cookie press and didn't have the ingredients for most of the recipes I found online. I came across this recipe and had to try it! I love to cook, but I am not much of a baker! The first mistake I made was using salted butter. I noticed AFTER I mixed the ingredients. The next mistake was not reading the directions where it said to cream the sugar and butter and THEN add the egg. I added it all at once! Third mistake - refrigerating the dough because I had to run a quick errand. That made the press nearly impossible to operate! With all of that being said....the cookies came out very pretty! I can taste the salt, but they are still pretty good! I will make these again and attempt to follow directions!

I've made norwegian butter cookies for 50 years using my mom's old metal 'spritz' press. This recipe is better than mom's and the dough is perfect for a cookie press. This is my new old recipe. Thanks

Don't have much to add that hasn't already been said, but this yielded a very delicious, tender cookie. Keep in mind that the flavor is mild, so people who prefer really spicy, tangy cookies may be underwhelmed by the result. I spread these with chocolate ganache and made sandwich cookies, and they were delicious.

Heaven. My dad loves butter-centric baked goods hot out of the oven, so I made these for his birthday. I had no almond extract and I guessed (correctly) that sifting the flour was unnecessary and did not do so. I used the fork cross-hatching technique and they came out looking beautiful and tasting even better. Everyone loved them. Go ahead and try for yourself!

There seems to be an error here. This recipe calls for 3 1/2 cups of flour but an earlier version of the recipe posted on this webiste used 4 cups of flour. I used the 4 cup version and had no problem with the dough at all. Less flour would not have worked. Everyone loved these cookies- best butter cookie ever!

Fab spritz cookie. After wrestling with the dough for a while, I got the feel for it. Held up well to being left out, having colors kneaded in, etc. You can taste the almond (if you plan on serving it with diff flavored icing), but it is faint enough to go with most flavors.

Rating: 4
Yum! Very popular. Nice flavor. Be sure to let dough come to room temperature before trying to press cookies (if you make ahead and store in fridge as I did)--night and day with regard to ease of pressing cookies.

We made these to roll out and used a pumpkin-shaped cookie cutter, iced with orange icing and used chocolate chips for a jack o lantern face. Very cute and delectably good! We did not use the almond flavor. We used Sucanat natural sugar and one cup whole wheat flour instead of all white flour. I didn't have wholewheat pastry flour, but would make them again using that. I'm saving this recipe for sure!

These are excellent cookies. So nice and light and fluffy. Just don't overbake! They can turn brown fast. It's a nice change from cookies filled with 'stuff' - and no machinery required makes it an easy first time cookie!

Great cookies! My friend and I made these together, and we both loved them. We baked them for 10 minutes per batch, and they were 1/4 inch thick. Didn't use almond extract, and they still turned out great! All of them were perfectly crisp and delicious.

These cookies are amazing!! Only bake for about 8 minutes. Crispy on the outside, chewy on the in. I would make these exceptional cookies again in a heartbeat.

OMG! These cookies are exceptional! I did not use a cookie press, but rolled out small portions between wax paper to 1/4" and used a cookie cutter. (Hearts for Valentine's Day!), then added sprinkles before baking. Luckily, I burned a few, well, someone had to eat them. :-) Even these were yummy.

Perfect, buttery little spritz cookies. Almond is very subtle. I used flower shape and put tiny dollop of apricot jam in center. Lovely.

This is a recipe I have made each year for 7 years - it's now a delicious tradition. The almond is perfectly subtle and a wonderful companion to the butter. I follow to a "T" and have never had a bad batch.

Many compliments on these cookies. I rolled the dough into three logs covered in plastic wrap, chilled them for about an hour and then sliced into quarter-sized cookies. Some were pinched into cups in which I spooned a little jam. Comments were "awesome," "bakery-quality."

This is a wonderful Spritz recipe. I haven't had any great Norwegian treats in a while, so I decided to try these. Some may find them bland, but if you grew up eating Spritz, you will love this recipe. Just like Grandma made!

Made these tonight. WOW they were good! The whole family loved them. I made them with my daughter and we had a lot of fun pressing different shapes. I follow the suggestion of using just vanilla extract. The cookies came out light and crunchy. Waaay better than the typical butter cookies that come in the round tin (can't remember the brand.)

No one can keep their hands off of these cookies! They're wonderful. One of my favorite cookie recipes.

Rating: 4
This is the best butter cookie recipe I have come across. I only use vanilla (no almond) and I cook longer than the directions suggest - a crispier texture and nuttier flavor. I make a batch, divide into thirds and roll into logs. I then "slice and bake" one log at a time through the week. It's much better than feeding your kids all those preservatives...

Rating: 1
These are terribly dry, I just don't understand why. The recipe calls for 3 sticks of butter & they turned out drier than a biscuit, nasty! That & you barely taste the almond extract flavoring. I'll stick with some of my other spritz recipes. I had to rate this with 1-fork. Not a recipe that I'll be making again.

Rating: 4
I just couldn't stop eating them!! I have reduced 1/2 cup of flour and didn't have any problem with consistency. I intend to bake a few hundred as a Christmas gift, probably replace the almond extract for lemon and sprinkle them with colorful sugar before baking. Fantastic cookies and very easy to make.

Who needs a cook book when you learn about epicurious! These butter cookies taste like heaven (as my children say). Very easy and a recipe I will make over and over again.

Would recommend for a simple crunchy, light buttery taste of a cookie!

I have reviewed this before and made these again this Christmas. What I do is flavor each batch with natural organic extracts. I use bluberry, coconut, almond, lemon, strawberry and orange. I color and decorate with professional colors and sprinkles with each flavor. I use a Wilton cookie press. The results are fabulous. A great tasting butter cookie that is festive and beautiful to look at. Superb recipe! Can't beat that.

I make this every year, and it is always a big hit - never any left! I add slivered almonds to the dough and roll into balls instead of using the Spritz.

I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies were wonderfully delicious and light. I used a cookie press and decorated the tops with colored sugar sprinkles for half the dough and used the other half for thumbprint cookies with strawberry preserves. Both kept really well for one week in a tightly sealed container. Unfortunately,they didn't last long enough to see shelf life. For variations of flavor, you may want to divide the dough in thirds and add varying essences according to preference. However, for those basic butter cookie lovers, this is an excellent recipe with the just the right texture and taste.

These are delicious and quite easy to make. I refrigerated the dough overnight, and let it sit out for ca 2 hours before I baked it. I melted bittersweet chocolate and dipped the cooled cookies in it. Yum! Definitely a keeper!

First batch was a bit bland so I modified: rolled dough into small balls, then pressed chocolate-carmel balls into center of each ball, flattening cookie a bit. Baked 13 minutes, let cool for 5 mins, then coated with powdered sugar. Let completely cool and coated with powdered sugar again. AWESOME!!!

Made for holiday gift giving. rolled out and cut with tall glasses. Dabbed some with cranberry jelly, some with passion fruit jelly. Topped others with sugar. Offered a nice variety of flavors with one cookie. They look nice and tasted good. Have to watch closely -- they burn in a snap.)

i expected more from this butter cookie...maybe because i wasn't using a cookie press..but the dough was dry and crumbly and the cookies baked unevenly and simply weren't impressive. they taste fine(i didn't have almond extract and used lemon zest and juice instead) but i wouldn't make them again.

These are best finished with a dusting of powdered sugar! (after they have cooled use a shaker or put the sugar in a seive to dust). I got a vintage Mirro cookie-pastry press at a flea market for $2 - ebay also sells them cheap - they're great! My sister makes these in heart-shapes for valentines day (use the star attachment if you don't have a heart attachment.)

I'm definitely not a fan of almond extract, so I used fresh orange zest and the juice of one orange in this recipe instead. I took one reviewer's advice and filled the center with jam (what I found in my cupboard was Tangerine-pineapple-cherry marmalade left over from a Christmas gift basket...looks great and goes so well with the orange butter cookie) The cookies came out beautifully. I don't have a press, so I rolled the dough out gently and used a small wine glass to make round cookies, a melon baller worked to make the indents as well as scooping in the marmalade. Excellent...looks like a bakery made cookie.

Just like my Swedish Great Grandmother used to make! I've made it a half dozen times, and all I have to warn is that don't monkey with the amount of liquid. I've used all manner of extract and liquer, but make sure it's NOT over 3tsp, grand total! Also, if you're having troubles getting the cookies to stick to the cookie sheet, pop it in the freezer, and then rub it down with a paper towel to get rid of the moisture. This is a great recipe!

This is a great butter cookie recipe. I made some plain and some with jam. I made the dough last weekend(I omit the almond extract),I defrosted it, rolled it out, took a flower cookie cutter, brushed cookie with eggwhite & milk mixture, put my thumbprint lightly in the center and put a little jam (1/8-1/4 teaspoon rasberry, strawberry, or apricot)in thumbprint and then baked. They were pretty and delicious :)

I have been making Spritz cookies for Christmas every year for the past 25 years, but I never could find a recipe that equaled that of my childhood memory which was baked by our elderly neighbor.

I made these cookies yesterday, and I am thrilled! I'm not wild about almond extract, so I used lemon, and they tasted like they came from a bakery. The texture is perfect, they came out so well in the cookie press....I made little trees, coated them in green sugar, then decorated them with a yellow star and blue and red dots. I also made the star shape and put a candied cherry in the center before baking. Delicious!!

I've made this recipie several times and it's consistently rich and crisp! In contrast to many butter cookie recipies, which are too gooshy. I turn my back and the little darlings are gone! For the holidays this year I'm going to try a dollop of icing to hold some decorations on.

If you like GOOD butter cookies---this one is for you. I made these for Xmas cookies this year. For each batch, I halved the dough , flavored it with natural extract ( Frontier makes excellent natural, organic extract). I used orange, stawberry, coconut and lemon for each kind.I added coloring to the batches and sprinkled colored sugar crystals for decoration , then formed shapes with my Wilton cookie press. I still used good vanilla in the basic dough. The texture was flaky and buttery. Very festive, colorful and delicious. This is an easy recipe with minimal clean up.

This dough is absolutely perfect for the cookie press. It worked flawlessly! I refrigerated the dough while waiting for the first batch to bake, to keep it from getting too soft. I also washed the cookie sheets before the second batch. The flavour is very buttery - much like shortbread, but more rounded with the vanilla and the almond flavours.

such a simple recipe to make... definitely get your kids involved. very very buttery flavor. i wonder if some orange or lemon zest would be nice? the cookie press is great for this recipe. you can get a pretty nice one for around $10 and it's a worthwhile investment. watch out for the dough. it gets really really soft in a hot kitchen. also, no need to space the cookies so far apart -especially when making over 6 dozen! they don't spread out or run in the oven, so feel free to space them closer together and get more cookies in the oven with each batch.
