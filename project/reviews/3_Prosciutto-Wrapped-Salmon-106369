I love both salmon and prosciutto but these flavours simply do not work together. Definitely won't make this one again.

Yummy. I added a teaspoon of whole grainy mustard under the prosciutto to give it some zing.

Disappointed! As a lover of salmon and prosciuto I thought I would have the best of both worlds, but the flavors simply do not work well together.

Disappointed! As a lover of salmon and prosciutto I thought I would have the best of both worlds, but let me tell you, the flavors simply do not blend well. Simple recipe but not good.

I made this for Easter with excellent reviews. The vegetables were fine made in advance, the salmon was easy, and the combination fantastic. I think the frsh herbs are essential. Wonderful impressive dish for spring!

salmon as a noturious bland fish, recives a little flavor bust thank to the prosciutto... it's wonderful to wrap, a slice of lemon, or few sticks of asparagus inside a little prosciutto pouche. and it keep salmon nice and juicy on the inside, and delightfully crunch on the outside. yum

It sounds delicious but the salmon itself doesn't taste too much. The taste of the salmon and the prosciutto are too different. I wouldn't do this recipe again. :(

Okay, this may sound weird, but this is what I did. After I wrapped the salmon, I cut each piece into several chunks. I then loaded the wrapped chunks of salmon on skewers with cherry tomatoes, pineapple, olives, and pearl onions. I grilled them over a high heat grill for just a couple of minutes and served shish-ka-bob style. Everybody loved them!! And my children loved helping me assemble the skewers.

My husband liked this recipe much more than I did. He would enjoy it if I made it again, but I have salmon recipes that I much prefer.

This wasn't the best. I love prosciutto and I love salmon, but not together. There are better recipes for salmon. Salmon Glazed with Honey & Mustard, http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=102649 and Rosemary-Roasted Salmon, http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=102988 just to name two. Better luck next time.

We made this dish cutting the salmon into finger size pieces, wrapping with a small piece of prosciutto and after running in the oven serving as an appetizer alongside small slices of cantaloupe. It was delicious.

a very simple dish that is perfect in its simplicity. Visual appeal, nice flavor, easy to make, easy to eat. You get a lot of bang for the minimal effort!

So easy and yet a delicious way to serve salmon. This will be made often in my house. Delicious!

This was delicious and easy to make. I served it on Father's Day and my parents who are Italian loved it. I would never have thought to wrap salmon with prosciutto (it usually is served around cantaloupe as an Italian tradition) but it was really a great combination.

I made this for Easter Lunch and everyone was impressed. It seems like an unusual combination, but it was wonderful. The ease of the dish allows you to spend time with your guests.
