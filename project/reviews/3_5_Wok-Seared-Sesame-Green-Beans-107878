A fast and simple way to dress up beans that is really delicious! I did not add cornstarch and it was pretty runny, but that turned out to be a blessing in disguise because then the sauce seeped into everything else on the plate which made everything taste better.

Made this again for a crowd - tripled the beans, doubled the sauce. This time, I boiled a full head of garlic (peeled, whole cloves) in water the day before for 8 minutes. At that point, I added the beans and blanched for 2-3 minutes more. Plunge them in ice water. Pat dry and store in fridge in paper towels. Mash the garlic (mortar and pestle) and mix it in with the sauce. The night of, fry the beans for a couple minutes, pour on the sauce and stir for a couple minutes more. The garlic does wonders for the flavor and thickens the sauce too, without need for cornstarch. Beans stay a nice bright green. Guests raved.

Yup. Add some cornstarch to thicken.

This was VERY EASY, VERY QUICK (especially when I used pre-trimed and pre-cleaned green beans), and REALLY DELICIOUS! I think this would be a great treatment for broccoli, cauliflower and eggplant, red bell peppers and onion.

Very tasty and easy! I made the mistake of putting the top on my pan to keep them warm for about 2 minutes and they cooked a little too much. I won't do that again, but I will cook these again.

Ilovedthese green beans. I served them with sesame chicken strips. delicious. I used regular vinegar, kind of strong, next time I will make the trip to the oriental market to purchase the rice vinegar.

Like some others I added ginger, garlic and cornstarch to the sauce , because I was trying to duplicate garlic sauce take-out. This is much better then anything you order. I added Japanese eggplant and zucchini and shrimp to make it a whole meal. Instead of precooking the beans on the stove I steamed the veggies seperately in the microwave until each was crisp-tender. Then cooked as directed. I can't wait to make it again

Fast and easy. I added minced garlic, ginger, and button mushrooms to give it a little more flavor. Next time I will add shallots to spice it up a little. It was a little sweet, so I'm glad I added the garlic and ginger. I also listned to other reviewers and put in some cornstarch to have the dressing stick, and I'm glad I did. It went really well with the coriander tereyaki steak I made as the main dish.

I substituted long beans for green beans as the recipe had suggested (+cornstarch), and it wasn't as successful--sauce was delicious, but the long beans are not as sweet as green beans, so it ended up sourer.

I found this recipe at the last minute and used frozen french cut green beans from Trader Joe's. Steamed the beans quickly first, then followed the recipe. Very tasty, quick and easy. A keeper for my family.

Took advice of other reviewer and added cornstarch so the sauce would stick to the beans. It was a bit sweet the first time I prepared it so the next time I added chopped garlic and minced ginger... Crunchy and delicious!

Whereas I think it is silly to totally change a recipe and THEN rate it, I absolutely welcome reader suggestions. That being said, I added a buttload of garlic which I sauteed up front in the oil and cut by half the sugar. Tasted just about like Chinese restaurant garlic beans. Family loved it!

This recipe was only okay, not great. The sauce was far too sweet tasting, and didn't have much other flavor.

This is a staple recipe in my kitchen. Quick, easy and delicious, and always gets rave reviews.

I loved the flavor of this dish, but didn't give four forks b/c the sauce just sat in the bottom of the pan. Next time, I think I may add a bit of cornstarch to make the mixture stick to the beans.

Excellent recipe. I added some chopped red onions, red pepper and a few mushrooms to add some color and flavor. An good addition.

Very pleasant way to prepare some of the plethora of beans from the garden. I also added some red bell pepper and used a combination of chili and sesame oils. I might add a touch of garlic next time.

i agree with the cook below, add some red bell pepper for color and flavor contrast. i also used shallot. mushrooms would be really good as well. these taste wonderful, i served them with sesame rice and foolproof grilled chicken. fabulous!!!

As good as any I've had in a Chinese restaurant. I added some red bell pepper to the wok with the beans, which provided a nice color contrast and another flavor. The next time I will probably reduce the amount of sesame oil to one tablespoon. I don't think the overall flavor will suffer and it will be slightly less oily (plus save a few calories).

This was great, and quick to make. After putting the beans on the plates I topped the servings with some slivered water chestnuts, just because I happened to have water chestnuts.
