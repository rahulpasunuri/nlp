Try soaking the long grain rice in room temp. water for about 30 minutes before setting to cook. Cook in water which is 1 1/2 times the quantity of rice. After it has boiled once reduce to very low heat and cover pan with lid wrapped with soft cloth and allow to simmer for 5 -7 minutes or until done( Done is when the rice actually achieves standing position at the top) Season with cumin seeds crackiling in Corn / Sunflower oil or Clarified butter.
