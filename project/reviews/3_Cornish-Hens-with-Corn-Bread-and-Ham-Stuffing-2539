I found this to be a very mediocre, bland recipe. Very little if any pizzazz. It will easily serve four people with an average appetite.

Given the reviews below, and another tip that I found elsewhere, I made the cornbread for this recipe with no sugar ("Southern Cornbread"). The cornbread as I made it was not cakey, but rather dense & dry, and it worked perfectly as a stuffing base. If you're going to make this recipe, just ensure your cornbread is not too sweet, and you will be delighted! We had the hens for Christmas dinner instead of turkey (quick to defrost, quick to cook) and the meal was a huge success.

My family liked this recipe. I used Jif package cornbread mix and found it a little too sweet. The only change was smoked turkey instead of ham, but I will try ham or sausage the next time. This is very simple and tasty and will be easy to modify to specific tastes. It's worth keeping.

Served this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. Didn't have any ham but it turned out great anyway.

This dish was so easy to make and yet looks so attractive. Perfect for a small dinner party! Can't wait to make it again! (My cornish hens needed 1 hour in the oven)

I really enjoyed this recipe. It was very tasty and moist! I'd definitely make this again.

This was really good. I would definitely make the stuffing again and again. But unless you and your "honey" are really big eaters, this can serve up to 4 (unless you happen to have a teenage boy in the house!)
