I love intense chocolate flavor so I use lots more chocolate, and I love it.

This was not the dish i was hoping for. Like the lady before me, I will not make this again.

Despite most of the other reviews, I liked this recipe. Custard is supposed to have a subtle flavor. It was even better the next day when the flavors seemed more intense. Just make it ahead ..........

I made this recipe for company too, because the picture in the magazine was so pretty. But like the reviewer before me, I agree it is pretty average. Although, it was quite easy to make and made a nice presentation, I doubt I would make it again.

Easy to make and my guests liked it but it's nothing really special.
