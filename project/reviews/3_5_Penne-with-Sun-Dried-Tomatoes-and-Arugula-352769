Loved it! Did it with blanched bacon instead of pancetta (couldn't find it) and was great. Will do it again for sure.

this exceeded expectations. i made a lot of substitutions -- bacon in place of pancetta, whole wheat spaghetti instead of ziti, and lowfat milk instead of heavy cream, and it was still great. i don't like arugula but had some to cook -- the various flavors blend so well so that the arugula isn't too strong for the recipe.

Really easy and fast. The sun dried tomatoes give it a burst of flavor that a regular tomato sauce wouldn't.

My husband loved this dish but all I can say was that it was "good". I didn't have enough arugula and maybe it would have tasted better if I had added the amount the recipe called for. I also added pine nuts and used half and half. I'm sure if I had followed the recipe exactly, it would have been more of a hit.

Pretty good and easy to make but not up to a '4 forks' standard.

I have never given a recipe a "no fork" rating, but this one is such a bomb, that I had no choice. I have lived in Italy and this is actually the very first time that I have used a recipe for a pasta, rather than a home tutorial, and I will never do it again...Blech!!

Really good! Per prior suggestions, used chicken stock instead of pasta water & added some cayenne for a small jolt. Grilled Italian sausages to go with the pasta - a very good idea!

Really easy, quick, and delicious. I've made this 2 times already. The second time I used italian sausage and spinach instead because I didn't have arugula and pancetta. Everyone loved it both times.

Very disappointing! The browned pancetta had an overpowering flavor, the arugula was bitter. My husband didn't finish his.

Great recipe, I used a 50-50 mix of baby spinach and arugula. To reheat I added some extra cream and put it in the microwave was great.

This is such a superb and delicious recipe!! Very Authenic Italian, simple and quick to prepare. I used about a cup of chicken stock in place of the pasta water, and used a couple of large handfulls of baby spinach in place arugula ( fresh spinach was perfect!) I also added a nice pinch of red pepper flakes to give it a nice "punch" and used italian parsley..and a bit of dried basil at the end. Oh! almost forgot..I also added about 1/3 cup of toasted pine nuts..FABULOUS!!!.. The very last thing I added was some freshly grated Parmesean cheese. We served it to friends with some warm crusty artisian bread and a wonderful bottle of wine. This recipe is now a staple in our family. Thank you Epicurious!!!

Really delicious. One of the better pasta recipes I've tried and distinctive enough for company. I cut down the arugula by a tad because it seemed to crowd the sauce, but not necessary---once I mixed with the pasta, it didn't dominate at all. I mixed the pasta in with the sauce as suggested, but next time, I'd add the sauce on top of each portion of penne because the sauce ended up being a tad thin for the pasta when stirred ahead of time. YUM. Wholeheartedly recommended!

This dish was okay - not bad but there are better tomato and arugula recipes. Definitely needs more liquid . using chicken stock is better than cooking liquid. Even with increasing half and half, we found the pasta too dry and heavy. We revived the leftovers with more sun dried tomatoes, chicken stock and more half and half which made it more enjoyable. Probably would not make again but opt for the popular favorite - Pasta with Arugula and Plum Tomatoes from Bon Appetit August 2000

I followed this recipe exactly and it was delicious. I would lighten it up next time by using milk instead of cream. We decided it could use another texture and added toasted pinenuts. Yum! Sheer perfection. Definitely will do this again and a great recipe for guests.

Good but not 4 forks. We did enjoy this dish-I prepared it as recipe notes but was somewhat let down by reviews raving about this dish. Again, good, but not that good.

This recipe was definitely beyond my expectations. It was on par with something you could get at a fancy Italian restaurant. I prepared as stated, but instead of using reserved pasta water I used chicken cooking stock that I had leftover. It was pretty easy to prepare and all the ingredients were easy to find at my regular grocer. I even ate leftovers for breakfast the next day!

We had this tonight and it was awesome! Changes included using whole wheat pasta, substituting 1/2 and 1/2 instead of the cream, chunked up pancetta instead of thin cut and I added 2 diced grilled chicken breasts. I did use more 1/2 and 1/2 than what the recipe called for and about 3/4 C of the saved pasta water. Husband and I fully enjoyed this -- fresh arugula and basil really finished the dish nicely! Tremendous recipe quick and excellent - we'll be making again many many times!

Great! I added some chicken broth to make more sauce and as a previous reviewer, used less pasta.

I made this dish after a trip into NYC's specialty shops in the Village. I brought home so much stuff, and then had to find a recipe that fit. This beautiful dish is really excellent when made with the finest ingredients. I used fresh corkscrew pasta, and added College Inn chicken broth to the sauce to make it the right consistency rather than pasta water. I also diced the pancetta instead of chopping it finely. Some shredded basil on top with some great fresh parmesan reggiano---just wonderful.

I made this with spinach (boiled for 1 minute, then to a bath of ice water, then rung dry with paper towels) instead of arugula which was not available at the store. I also did not use all of the boiled pasta in order to have the sauce coat the pasta better. It was absolutely delicious and not a lot of work. Using really fresh ingredients, it tasted as good as something from a really high quality Italian restaurant.

The only change I made was to use whole milk instead of cream. No harm done and it made a delicious and hearty pasta dinner.
