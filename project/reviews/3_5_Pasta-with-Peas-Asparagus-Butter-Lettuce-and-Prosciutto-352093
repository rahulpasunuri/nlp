Made this as a quick mid-week meal for the family and it went over very well. I did take make a few changes as others suggested to double the wine and broth, substitute arugula (store didn't have butter lettuce), season with lemon zest and add cherry tomatoes. In addition to those changes I decided to roast the asparagus instead of boiling it - which added even more texture to the dish. Also, I completely forgot to add the parsley (whoops), but it wasn't missed. I will definitely make this again... it was easy, the toddler loved it and the flavors blend beautifully.

This is like the Italian version of spaetzle! Shelling peas seemed impossible, or maybe I got the wrong kind, so I just boiled them whole then cut them into small pieces. I think the green onion butter wine sauce did a lot for the flavor. I love that it has a lot of green in it but still tastes like comfort food with the prosciutto and parmesan.

Loved this recipe!! One modification we made was to substitute the butter lettuce with cherry tomotoes adding them in at the end just to warm them. Will definitely repeat.

YUM! I used the liquids and shallots as called for (used about 6 ounces of green onions) and halved the asparagus, peas and pasta. As I was eating this for dinner tonight, I was thinking that fiddle head ferns would be wonderful in place of the butter lettuce. Next time will add a little lemon zest as suggested.

This is a terrific spring recipe. I did everything as written but I doubled the liquids (as was suggested) and I added the lettuce at the end to just wilt it - I think adding it earlier, as written, would have cooked the lettuce down too much. As it was, the flavors were great and it made for a delightful meal. Can't imagine skipping the prosciutto, though; it added the right saltiness & interest.

This was a delicious spring/summer meal. I did make a few modifications to avoid running to the store. I uses lemon pappardelle pasta and added lemon zest juice to the veggie mix. It was yummy!

This was very nice. I used 4 ounces of arugula instead of the lettuce and that gave it a nice punch. I used frozen peas instead of fresh and that was just fine. I wasn't sure whether the weight of the green onions was meant to be before or after the dark green parts were discarded-- I just used two bunches. We particularly liked the cold proscuitto on top of the hot pasta, it was a nice contrast.

Very nice recipe. One can easily substitute arugula for the lettuce for a little more kick. Also, I highly recommend the imported prosciutto, which needs to be broken apart before adding to the pasta.

This is a great recipe. I've made it a couple of times now (both times without the prosciutto), and it always satisfies! This time I didn't have any white wine on hand so I doubled the chicken broth, also haven't ever used fresh peas, but frozen. Still was great.

we halved the recipe except for the liquids and as suggested just mixed in the lettuce at the end with the prosciutto. We also used the weenie shells rather than medium ones. The dish is in between a salad and a pasta dish- and so full of all kinds of green- yummy!

Yummy. Made with garlic rather than shallots and mixed in lettuce just before serving -- cooked lettuce didn't seem like it would go over too well!

Rating: 4
Loved it. Followed previous advice to use a little more liquids and to only add lettuce at end with the warm pasta to wilt. I was concerned that the prosciutto would overpower the recipe, but after eating I think it's what really what made it shine, helping balance all the other vegetal flavors with some salty umaminess. I would recommend not skipping it.

I have made this recipe many, many times now and though I'd share a few amendments to the written recipe. Firstly, go ahead and double the liquids, you won't regret it. Secondly, start the pasta water to boil just after you begin with the onions. Cook the pasta in a pot with a pasta strainer thing, and add the pasta to your reduced liquids and onion mixture (instead of setting the mixture aside) when the pasta is still al dente. Reduce heat to low, and stir occasionally to incorporate the flavors. Keep the pasta water boiling, then add the asparagus to the strainer, and boil for 2 mins. Add the peas, and after 2 minutes, strain and add the veg straight to your pasta. Stir some more. The pasta will soak up most of the liquid (and taste divine), so if you want more liquid, add pasta water. Stir in any shredded hard cheese you like, sprinkle with parsley and serve. Don't bother with the lettuce, and the prosciutto is nice but not necessary. This is a real crowd pleaser, and green beans, brocolli, and/or zucchini all work well in this dish.

A lovely springtime dish. I'm not sure about the lettuce. I added it at the end and I don't know what it brought to the dish other than several "What's this?" inquiries. No one complained, it was just kind of extraneous. I think spinach would be too strong and romaine too crunchy, so next time I may just skip the greens. Otherwise, very very good.

Easy to make and I had this for days later too. Very tasty.

We really loved this - we decreased the oil a little bit, but we were pleasantly surprised at how well the lettuce held up in this recipe. We will definitely make again!

I've been looking for the perfect pasta primavera recipe for years - this one is it. Perfect as written and as others said, a good base for modifying. I used frozen peas and prosciutto that wasn't imported - to save money - I think it was actually better in this dish than pricey imported prosciutto.

Rating: 4
This is good as written, and a good base for substitutions when not all the fresh produce is on hand. The only thing I would say is unneccessary is the butter--I sauteed veggies in a little olive oil. Easier than fishing the peas out of the water with a spoon--put them in a small deep strainer with a long handle and set over the pasta water. When done, just take the strainer out of the water.

It's very important to make sure the peas are sweet. Our peas were a little starchy. Our 3 year-old ended up picking out the prosciutto and pasta.

Rating: 4
Really delicious, light meal. I was not equipped for fishing all of the peas out of the water, but otherwise the recipe was easy enough to follow. I did not wilt the lettuce (I've found it's a fine line between nicely wilted lettuce and slimy, brown lettuce), instead I served the warm pasta on top of it. The prosciutto isn't completely necessary, but it is a nice touch, so I make this whenever there's a sale.

This is fresh and healthy. I didnt think salty chicken broth was necessary so skipped it. I did not have shallot and substituted garlic. I had frozen peas, but no asparagus. This dish was great. AND...a lot easier :)

This was delish. I used frozen peas, and spinach instead of bibb lettuce, as that's what I had on hand. Also, as per others' suggestions, I threw in the spinach at the end of the cooking process, as the warmth from the pasta and sauce was enough to wilt it. The proscioutto was a nice touch, though vegetarians could easily leave it out, though my husband and I did find that it added a nice color to the mix--without it all is green and white.

I tailored this to what I had on hand; it was a great foundation. I used: regular white onions instead of spring onions; sherry cooking wine instead of white wine; ham (thin sandwich slices); romano cheese instead of parmesan; no parsley; extra black pepper; no boston lettuce. It was yummy!

Rating: 4
This is a very tasty meal, especially when using all fresh produce. I roasted the asparagus (450 degrees for 10 +/- minutes) and then quickly roasted the snap peas. After reading the other comments I didn't add the lettuce until very end, which was a good suggestion. Also added some fresh lemon juice which was a nice kick.

Amazing and delicious seasonal recipe! I did everything as stated, except for using frozen peas and got raves reviews at a party.

I gave this 4 forks because I know it could be exceptional...provided you just add the lettuce at the very end. We added it when it said to in the recipe and it was too wilted, but regardless, this was still amazing. So fresh and in touch with the season. I love that there were more veggies than pasta.

I was delighted with this recipe, which is kind of hard since I'm not a pasta eater.Did however make this my own by adding, of course, lots of garlic and crushed red pepper flakes. Only put in a little proscuitto b/c i needed a little more protien so i added pan-fried chicken. Plus also added the boston lettuce when i tossed the pasta @ the end so it stayed nice & crisp. Would make it again. *:)

I thought this recipe was a little bland until I added a couple of glugs of champagne vinegar, which brightened it considerably. Also, I agree with the reviewer who thought the lettuce wilted too much. If I make this again, I'd probably just toss the lettuce with the warm pasta and vegetables, and I think that would probably wilt it enough. I liked the pasta quite a bit in the end--it's a good spring one-dish dinner.

This was way better than I expected! Very delicious and easy to fix. I had to use penne rigate pasta and frozen peas and it worked just fine. I did roast the asparagus drizzled with lemon EVOO, salt and pepper and I think that made a huge addition to flavor.

Good but not a lot of pizzaz. All the cheese stuck the vegetables together and didn't get melted into the pasta. But, I good use of spring veggies.

Delicious! The way pasta should be eaten, with lots of veggies. Only suggestion I would make is to add the lettuce a little later. Mine cooked pretty much completely, wasn't crispy like the lettuce appeared in the image.

A tasty spring dinner. I substituted snow peas for the fresh shelled peas and romaine for the boston lettuce. It was still delicious. Good quality prosciutto is important. It adds a perfect touch of saltiness to this light, tasty and crunchy dish. Four forks!

Wow... I read the recipe in Bon Appetit and came here to rave about and recommend it--I'm shocked to see that people didn't like it! It's such a wonderfully light, but filling, warm weather dish. I think the butter/Boston bibb lettuce is key, and added just a little bit of blanched brussels sprouts since I had them on hand. The saltiness of the parm is key, so make sure that you use fresh. So, so, so good...

Simple weeknight meal or elegant spring supper too! I added leeks and shallots. Next time I would roast the asparagus instead of blanching for more flavor. Serve with crostini with herbed goat cheese and white wine.

It's fresh asparagus season. What an excellent way to use it. Had a small package of smoked meat from a trip to Montenegro that brought the taste up to a 3 forks. Used baby spinach and frozen peas. Very easy.

This was one of the most disappointing recipes ever! I do not understand how anyone could give it 4 forks. I made it nearly as written (subbed diced grilled zucchini for the peas) and it was bland and uninspired. Guests didn't eat it, so I'm stuck with a bunch of leftovers.

This was wonderful! I did have to substitute baby spinach for the lettuce. I went to four grocery stores before giving up...I could not find the recommended lettuce anywhere; however, using baby spinach in this was terrific. I have a lot of friends/family who detest vegetables...everyone loved this one and barely noticed that it was mostly vegetables. I will definitely add this as one of the few recipes that I make more than once.

I made this with whole wheat pasta and without the peas but added more asparagus. I thought it came out great. The prosciutto definitely adds that burst of flavor in each bite. I also did not have parmesan and instead used asiago. It tasted great.

I almost didn't make this because it sounded like just another vegetable and parmesean pasta recipe. But the flavor combination was unique and as the other reviewers noted, light. I'm craving it again already. Followed the recipe exactly and it worked beautifully.

Made recipe as written and it turned out wonderfully. A really nice sprint pasta. I plan to make it again and may try adding some zucchini and also chopping the prosciutto into smaller pieces or perhaps using a package of diced pancetta.

I really enjoyed this because it's a very light pasta dish. I followed the advice of adding in the lettuce last and next time I would follow the recipe. My lettuce wilted very unevenly. My advice would be to barely wilt the lettuce and have everything else ready to throw in and then take it off the heat. Either way I think it's tasty and I agree with the magazine that shells are important for catching the sauce and peas.

Quick, easy and really good! Thanks to the previous cook, I only added the lettuce at the very end (off the heat) so it was just warm and still looked fresh. Great, simple weeknight meal.

Heavy on vegetables and light on pasta - the perfect combination. Only thing I would change would be to add the lettuce at the very end, mine wilted way to much and didn't look nice and fresh like the picture.

We all loved this! Different, and full of gorgeous textures. Made some substitutions since asparagus at market looked tired and no fresh peas available, subsituted julienned zucchini and frozen baby peas. Used medium shells, and it was a huge hit with my family.
