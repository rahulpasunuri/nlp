i used only the leeks and mushroom part of the recipe and paired it with wheat pasta (per a similar Rachel Ray recipe) and it was a home run for for my husband and me. We were moaning the whole dinner! Hardy and flavorful! I added the salt and pepper to my mushrooms after they finished roasting to keep the juices in. I definitely want to try this again with risotto, too!

This was delicious. I changed a few things around for more flavor. I omitted the whipping cream for the leeks and the onion for the mushrooms. In the end, I added some saffron threads and squeezed a bit of lemon in for a brightening. Guests loved it. Even my one guest who didn't care so much for mushrooms. Will make again.

As the previous reviewed commented--a little too much in the way of onion so I used shallot for mushroom and small onion for risotto. I also added garlic to risotto. I used mix of homemade ve/mushroom stock and added shitake powder we get from the local farmers market. Used a truffle Pecorino type cheese and truffle butter to finish. My husband loves risotto and this is his fav. I've also tried it w chokes & aspargus.

HOLY Onion! This recipe would have been great had it not been for two large onions AND the leeks. I love leeks, but leeks with two onions in only 3 cups of rice is too much and detracts from other flavors. I would have only included the onion with the mushrooms and not with the risotto.

Rating: 4
So delicious! Prepped the leeks the day before and followed recipe pretty much to the letter, (minus the truffles -- used truffle oil). Served it as a side (with lamb) for 8 dinner guests and there was plenty for seconds, which were in very high demand. Big hit!

I get a CSA box and this time of year get lots of Leeks! This is my go to recipe for leeks. It is a great weekend dish for company with great bread. I got spinach this week too so I added it to the leeks after they were cooked and cooling down, it added a nice green element so I skipped the parsley. Roasting the mushrooms and onions makes the dish start stirring at 15 min. I take them out of the oven when some of the onions begin to turn brown-black which usually starts at 25 min not 45 so keep an eye on them. The 400 degree temp is a must as it causes the onions to caramelize

Wonderful rich flavor. Followed recipe except no truffles, just truffle oil. Roasting the mushrooms & onions imparts the rich flavor -- if you sautee you won't get the flavor. Very rich for an entre -- served as a side with grilled salmon. Makes a lot, but if possible it seemed like the flavor just got better. Will definitely make again for family meal and for company.

Rating: 4
Fabulous, fabulous recipe. I forgot to do the mushrooms early and I couldn't find my white truffle oil so ended up sauteeing them in butter and sherry which worked great. Otherwise followed the recipe as is and it worked great. I had cut the recipe in half since there are only 2 of us and found I need a little more broth so check that before finishing the rice up. Served with salmon poached in white wine. Looking forward to the leftovers for lunch today -- might mix some prosciutto in when I reheat.

Fabulous! I bought my groceries before I found the recipe so substituted asparagus for the leeks - worked fine. This one's a keeper!

I made this for an Italian themed dinner for 8 friends and it was the highlight of the evening. A few changes though - crimini mushrooms instead of oyster, some chopped truffles to the roasting mushrooms and a cup of white wine in exchange for a cup of broth. The truffle oil and truffles are a must to make this a gorgeous, elegant dish. I will certainly be making it again.

It is an amazing recipe! i skipped few things, for the leeks: i used fat free half and half instead of cream, then for the mushrooms: i didnt have shitake mushrooms, i used portebella and oyster mushrooms,and no butter on the mushrooms, and i did not use truffle oil, just sprayed canola oil and sprinkled dry thyme. last on the risotto itself i fried the onions with a bit of camola oil and 1/2 spoon of butter. it came out yummy!!!!!

This is my favorite risotto recipe. Each time that I make it for guests, I am asked for the recipe. The fews few times I made it just like the recipe and on subsequent times have altered it a bit to make it easier with the same wonderful results. To shorten the prep time, I brown/caramelize the onions and mushrooms on the stove and then add the green onions for the last few minutes (rather than boiling the cream and onions). Although I typically like parsley, I am not fond of it on this dish so I skip that as well.

This recipe is wonderful! I made it for my new husband as a "happy 1 month of marriage". I am now afraid I raised the bar too high. It would have been more efficient if I had started the mushrooms, the made the risotto and then cooked the leeks. However, the extra cooking time on the risotto made it so creamy that I reduced the amount of butter and cheese at the end. Proper salting and a little drizzle of truffle oil made these flavors pop.

This recipe is amazing. I made this as a "happy 1 month of marriage" dinner, and I am now worried I have raised the bar too high. I started the risotto first (I warmed the wine slightly as not to shock the rice) and then started with the mushrooms. This was not efficient as the risotto cooked faster than the mushrooms. However, continuing to stir and add broth made a very creamy risotto and I reduced the amount of butter and cheese at the end and it was creamy, rich and wonderful. I salted after adding the cheese, not sure show much salt the cheese would bring, and added a little drizzle of truffle oil (as I did not have truffles) and it dramatically brought out the flavors.

With an Italian wife, I make risotto quite often, but this was really exceptional. I didn't use the leeks or the truffles or the truffle oil or the mushrooms or the onion or the risotto but it still came out awesome! How can you people totally change the recipe and then review it like you made it as written?

I did not use the truffles or truffle oil, and I skipped the onions with the rice (by accident), and I used half crimini and half shitake, but otherwise followed the recipe. Wow. The leeks were fabulous and everything just went so well together. Like other reviewers, I had to cut the time on roasting the mushrooms - only 30 min - or they would have been charcoal. We will definitely make this again.

This was the best risotto I have ever made. I served it at a dinner party last night (doubled the recipe without a problem). When one guest looked saddly into his bowl, I asked what was wrong. He said he was mourning all of the horrible risottos he had eaten before he knew what a proper risotto should taste like. Thumbs up from everyone!

I am speechless. Never been a fan of risotto and was never able to successfully make it myself. I have been determined ever since to make and to have an amazing risotto. This recipe truly gets it right. I followed it to the letter, which I usually have a hard time doing, rebel cook that I am. I am fortunate to have an awesome vendor at my farmer's market that sells the best vegetable broth on earth. I'm sure that was a major contributr to this dish; success. Awesome ingredients are definitely the foundation. I too thought my mushrroms may have been over done. Once added to the risooto though they were just fine. I am in love.

I loved this! I made it at my boyfriend's new apt so we didnt have truffles, truffle oil, parmesan cheese and I decided to half the recipe. used shitake mushrooms about 3.5 oz. i had a little fontina cheese in the fridge so i threw some of that in and it was still very creamy.

Totally delicious. Took another reviewer's suggestion and used half shitake and baby bella mushroom to keep cost down and skipped truffles, just using the oil.

I've made the leeks, mushrooms, and stock ahead one day and unfortunately the 45 minute roasting time for the cut up shiitake's and onion is WAY too long. Maybe the oven at 400 is too hot, or the veggies are cut too thin, but the recipe doesn't work. I burned my wonderful expensive shiitake's after 37 minutes in that 400 degree oven. Maybe it was the butter on top? Help? What did I do wrong. Oh, and all the butter and cream. Can't be very healthy. I'll revise my review tomorrow, when I cook the risotto.

Creamy and delicious. I substituted asparagus cut into bite size pieces and sauteed baby artichoke for the mushrooms and white truffle oil. Also, substituted olive oil for the butter. I added a funny long green Mexican pepper, chopped, that I got at the local farmers market for heat. It was sooooo good.

Utter Bliss. This is a divine recipe. Each time I serve it, my guests go head over heals for the dish.

Fantastic Recipe! I'd recommend not using a very strong vegetable broth. I did and it consumed a lot of the truffle oil flavor. I will definitely make this again!

I made this meal last night for a group of friends and was very happy with how it turned out. I made a few substitutions to the dish including using only half shiitake mushrooms and half crimini ( to save a bit of money as the shiitake were expensive). I also didn't have truffle oil so used regular EVOO & I added in some tomatoes that I roasted at the end which gave it a nice sweet/tart contrast to the richness of the dish. Though I think the dish was delicious, in the future I might use half and half instead of cream as it was on the heavy side. It might also be nice to incorporate some steamed or grilled asparagus or some other vegetable.

Someone made this for our dinner party on Sunday, and it got great reception. It paired very well with the lamb tenderloin we had--a little heavy and over the top but waddya gonna do.

this was a delicious dish. i would 100% make it again. it takes a while to make but is TOTALLY worth it. we used hand picked wild leeks and it worked really well. lots of flavor. the leeks and mushrooms give it lots of punch. excellent comfort food and good for a summer meal as well. lots of extra pepper is very good. I'm surprised two of the other reviews called it bland, i thought the flavor was the best part! risotto is usually so plain but with the leeks, onions and mushrooms it tasted great. I'd recommend this meal to anyone who needs to impress casual company.

i used this recipe as a basic guide for a risotto using morels and ramps i picked in the last day/two... absolutely perfect, and i skipped the roasting component. just sauteed some shallots in eovv/butter mix, then added the ramps shortly thereafter and morels about three minutes later. folded them into the risotto as i added pecorino romano to finish.

Yummmm!!! This was a great recipe, and I plan to make it again. In efforts to *slightly* cut calories, I used half and half instead of whipping cream and did not add the last two tablespoons of butter. To save costs, I combined white button and portobello mushrooms with the shiitake mushrooms. Did not have black truffles available, but I think the truffle oil added enough flavor. As far as cooking times, I found that the leek/cream mixture needed about 30 minutes to reduce and the mushrooms needed about 55 minutes to brown. Finally, used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. This isn't a difficult recipe, it just takes a little bit of time...and it was 100% worth it! Can't wait to make this for company.

Simply amazing risotto. Truly impressive. Risotto is always time consuming to make, but unlike many recipes, this one was worth my time! I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and tried to up the flavor a little. I used three cups of chicken stock and two cups of mushroom stock and left everything else as is (omitted optional black truffles, though it would have been even better had I had them). Let the mushrooms roast for closer to 55 mins instead of 45. Definitely has a wow factor. Perfect with roast chicken. Will certainly be making this one again, especially when I need to impress.

I found this bland. Made as written, except used truffle oil rather than truffles and 50/50 butter/olive oil when butter was called for. Not sure if I will make again due to the amount of time involved, but if I do, I will triple the thyme and add soy sauce to the mushroom mixture before roasting. Also, personal taste, but I would use chicken stock rather than vegetable stock and add more cheese and maybe blanched asparagus tips at the end.

I've made this recipe several times and it's always superb. I'm not sure why folks think that risotto is tough to make. It's quite simple and the results are very consistent.

I make this as directed except I sub 1/2 olive oil 1/2 butter where it calls for butter, and I don't add the truffle products because I don't like truffles (I know...I know.) I've also made it with the addition of chopped proscuitto added to the onions at the beginning of cooking the risotto and with chicken broth instead of vegetable broth -- this was even better than the recipe as stated. It is extremely rich, so it's nice in small portions with roast chicken, or it makes a whole meal with salad and bread. I've made many different risottos, including a few with different types of mushrooms, and this is my favorite mushroom risotto recipe because roasting the mushrooms makes them taste rich and gives them a succulent, meaty texture.

I've made this a couple of times, following the recipe pretty closely, and it is amazing ~ but almost too rich. Last night I made it using wild rice instead or arborio, reduced the amount of butter by at least half, used half and half instead of whipping cream, and added roasted red peppers and fresh corn kernels to the mushrooms. Also omitted the parmesan. And it was spectacular, really one of the best things I've ever made; still rich, but not overwhelming, and beautifully chewy.

I love risotto, (almost always order it whenever I dine out) and have made this recipe several times. I like to use an assortment of mushrooms (at least 3), and have found that literally any combination renders fabulous results. The trick to a really creamy risotto is 1) use a wooden spoon! and 2) gently and slowly fold in the liquid, similar technique to making a souffle. For me, it takes much longer than 20 minutes for the liquid to absorb, but being patient pays off, this is better than anything I've had in any restaurant!

This was my first time preparing risotto, and I'm glad I started with this recipe! It was absolutely decadent: creamy, earthy, and delicious (even without the shaved truffle topping). Also, a word to the wise: this was my first time with white truffle oil, so I decided to taste just a drop on my finger: do not make my mistake! The taste in the risotto is wonderful, but alone it was very pungent and unpleasant.

I'm definitely making this again. Like many others, I did not use the fresh black truffle, but simply drizzled some extra white truffle oil on top, then topped with some extra Parmesan and parsley. It was very rich, but I didn't have a problem with that! :) I did omit the extra 2 tbsp. of butter that was to be added with the leeks, mushrooms, and cheese. It already looked rich and creamy enough, so I thought it probably wasn't necessary, especially with the white truffle oil drizzle. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, except my onions were sort of smallish to medium instead of large. I love onions; I didn't think it was too much. I served this with the Endive and Apple Salad that was also part of the "Sumptuous Vegetarian Supper" menu. They were great together. The salad was delicious but not too rich - a good thing in this case!

This risotto is divine! Yes, it is a bit time consuming, but soooooo worth it! I did make a few changes though... I used a combination of shiitake, buna shimeji and regular white mushrooms.

This is SOOOO GOOD! I'm eating it even as I type. Absolutely delicious. I made it exactly as directed, but didn't use truffles (although I did use truffle oil). It's probably normal to have almost a cup of broth leftover, so don't fuss if you end up with extra. BRAVO! This is great!

I have made this several times and each time it gets rave reviews. I made this last night for dinner guests (sans the leeks and wine)and our conversation was dominated by talk of the recipe and how they could make this delicious dish for themselves. This is by far my favorite go-to risotto recipe. My 9 year old son who typcially avoids cheese absolutely loved it and as soon as he figures out there's parmesan cheese in it I'm in trouble!! But until then, we'll be having this at least once a month!! But then again, this might change his mind about cheese...

I made this for Valentine's Day. It was fabulous, albeit time-consuming. Based on previous reviews, I cut out 2T of butter total, and didn't miss it. I also used 1 MASSIVE onion instead of the 2 recommended. I tend to make a lot of risottos, and this one now ranks in the top 2 (the other one being a corn and tomato risotto from White Dog Cafe). The truffle oil makes this dish. Just a tablespoon makes all the difference.

Awesome. This dish brought the house down - rave reviews. I made it with black truffle oil and black truffles instead of the suggested white, but otherwise followed the recipe.

This recipe needs tweaking. I roasted the mushrooms for 45 mins in 380 convection oven and they were crispy critters, almost threw them out but didn't have another spare POUND of shitakes. Boiling the leeks in (I used) milk caused what to me seemed like a sour taste (like sour milk). Next time I would just saute the leeks w/ the onions at the beginning of the risotto, and if need be add a little milk/cream at the end. That being said, recipe seems to have potential and I would make again. Have this 'Black Truffle Cream' jarred product which contains mushrooms and was good mixed in (served on side). Posting this as a comment only because I have a pet peeve about people who give a low rating due to their own errors.

This is excellent and very easy. I would consider myself an intermediate level cook, and did this with ease. Not exactly diet food as written, but I'll be working on adding olive oil instead of so much butter, and 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream as other cooks have mentioned. It's hard to make a meal without meat and leave my husband with a smile on his face, but he loved this dish - and he's an excellent chef, so he's always my litmus test.

Oh. My. Gawd. This was amazing, and made me queen of the household when I made it. My changes: less butter and more olive oil in general; 1/2 & 1/2 in lieu of cream for leek mixture; used up some portabellas in addition to shitakes; 3/4 mushroom broth and 1/4 chicken broth instead of vegetable for the risotto; took the advice to add truffle oil at the end instead of actual truffles (I'm cheap). Truly phenomenal, and I will definitely make it again.

This is a beautiful, rich, and elegant recipe. A little more time, but very well worth it. My husband and I love it.

Truffle oil is absolutely necessary. Beef broth is better--I used dried shitake mushrooms. The oil and the broth balance out the shitake, and make it glorious. Reducing onion by a bit is great. This is a special dish, so I would not throw in so much broth at a time--1 tbsp, stir, 1 tbsp, stir. The old fashioned way. Used a third of the butter required, and olive oil for the rest, but found it very rich still. Perfect meal to cheer you up at the end of this year. Serve with a nice salad and good wine.

I tried this recipe out for a group of girlfriends last night and it was a perfect combo of flavors! I made it as-is except: reduced the amount of onion to 1 total for the recipe (1/2 with the shrooms, 1/2 with the rice) and finished with a bit of truffle oil instead of chopped truffles. As always, I needed a couple of more cups of stock than called for. A couple of notes on past reviews: *Truffles have a unique flavor. If you are unfamiliar with it you might want to try it first before embarking on a relatively expensive dinner recipe for the first time. *I had no probelm with the leeks changing the texture- I did, however, cook them until the moisture had mostly evaporated *The mushrooms really did take about 45 min for me. I roasted them until all moisture was gone and they started to carmelize. I stirred them every 10-15 min throughout and kept expecting them to be done- per other reviews. Just goes to show, YMMV. When I make this again I will make the following changes: *Will probably skip the leeks all together- not sure they added much to this dish but the cream sure adds calories! *Reduce the amount of butter all around. I will use 1 TB for the shrooms, 1 tb for the onions & rice and 1 TB to finish. It simply doesn't need more than that! *Increase the number of shrooms, or possibly reserve them and serve on top instead of mixed in. I don't love shrooms but these were delish and I felt they got lost in the dish!

This was some of the best risotto I have ever made. The recipe included the crucial risotto technique of adding liquid in stages, which is something that should never be left out in preparation. My wife and I felt that there were too many onions in the finished product, however, between the leeks and 2 whole onions so I'll probably decrease that next time. I didn't have any luck finding dried black truffles where I live (mainly due to the time of year), just truffles in brine, which I didn't think would be very good for this recipe.

I substituted 3 cups of clam juice for some of the broth and served the risotto topped with sea scallops that I sauteed in a little olive oil over medium high heat for about a minute and a half on each side.

this was the first risotto I have ever made and it was pretty easy, although labor intensive. my only gripe about it is that it is very rich, so serve it on the side with something light.

A+. I think the leek/cream mixture really rounds out the flavors and takes this one over the top. I didn't use truffles, just truffle oil, and greatly reduced the butter and it was still fantastic.

Fantastic recipe. I've tried a lot of different risotto recipes, but this one really tops the list. Some chefs on here seem to like this as an appetizer/first course, some as a main dish, but I'd like to put in my vote for the former. It is delicious, but so rich that you really wouldn't want more than a small serving. I made the mistake of serving it as a main, and won't again. I think I'd do as another chef on here did and serve it with roasted chicken--something relatively bland in comparison to the intense flavor of the risotto.

This is an exceptional recipe. I could eat it everyday.

This was amazing. I made it exactly as written for a vegetarian main course. Used jarred fungusamongus black truffles. It was so rich we certainly didn't miss meat. I just tasted some leftovers a week later and it tastes just as good (maybe better).

I have used a few risotto (as well as other recipes here) and this has to be the BEST recipe I've used so far. Used Campogrande Orvieto Classico 2006 (oldest wind producing area in Italy) as the white wine for this recipe. Served the risotto after a nice garden salad. Accompanied the risotto with a herb-crusted chicken breast. Definitely part of my dinner party repertoire.

This recipe was unbelievable in terms of both taste and ease. I followed it faithfully, and then added seared scallops. Oustanding.

This is delicious, but with this recipe "Less REALLY is MORE"! It's intended as a first course but I I decided to half the recipe and serve it as an entree' for two (BIG mistake). I cut everything in 1/2, except that I used one cup of rice and adjusted the broth accordingly. I also omitted the truffles, so the proportion of rich ingredients to rice and broth was less than this recipe calls for. Despite my attempts to lighten it up, it was OVERWHELMINGLY rich-- too much to serve as an entree'-- and my proportions were huge for 2 people because of the intensity of flavors. I will make this again but will reduce the amount of whipping cream, butter and even mushrooms considerably. Despite decreasing the proportion of mushrooms, the intense shiitake flavor was just too much for us. It's a very special dish, but only appropriate as a first course (as the recipe was intended) or as a small entree'.

Wow, just wow. This dish blew my mind. I was wondering how the shiitake's would mix with the truffle flavor, and it was just heaven. This dish is extremely savory, and not as heavy the ingredients might suggest. 5 people tore this dish apart, and even had people using fingers to scrape the bowl for the last drop of this flavor intense risotto.

This is worth the raves. I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful.

As I was going back through my old Bon Appétits, I found this recipe in a relatively recent issue. We made it two nights ago and it was astonishing. I have cooked a _lot_ of risotto over the years, but this recipe was a revelation. If you are a fan of risotto you owe it to yourself to take this recipe for a spin. I prepared it exactly as described, minus the shaved truffles at the end (hey, Im not made out of money!). Beware! With almost an entire stick of butter and ¾ of a cup of whipping cream, this is a diet crusher.

absolutely unbelievable. i don't even want to tell you how much i ate. used creme fraiche and sour cream for the leeks, and finished with a dab of truffle butter instead of oil, in both cases using up xmas leftovers. it was the very definition of comfort food, while also being ideal for the fanciest dinner party.

Wow, simply wonderful. This rivals recipes from top restaurants. I only needed to add 4 cups of broth.

I thought this was very good, my husband thought it was outstanding. I think the truffle oil is a must. I drizzled a bit of oil over each portion just before serving. Delicious.

We are big fans of risotto, and are quick to try different recipes. We absolutely loved this one. The baked mushrooms and onions (with the with the white truffle oil) give it a wonderful, distinct flavor. The leeks and heavy cream give it body and make it especially good for winter evenings. We skipped the shaved white truffle ingredient, and didn't miss a thing! A definite keeper.

My first attemp at Risotta and what a start. This recipe is amazing. The truffle oil adds so much depth, you CAN'T skip it. Go invest in a jar, for $40, it will last a long time...

This is the best risotto I have ever made, and that's without the truffles or truffle oil (out of my budget). Like others, I found that the mushrooms and onions took only about 25 minutes to roast. I also found that my 2 leeks yielded about 4 cups when chopped, rather than 2. I used them all and did not find it to be too "leeky". This recipe is less time-consuming than it looks because you can get the main risotto part going while you roast the mushrooms and cook the leeks.

Out of all the many risotto recipes I've tried, this is far and away the BEST. It's absolutely out of this world even without the truffles and truffle oil, which I omitted. The secret in my opinion are the leeks which become almost sweet when cooked down in the cream. This has already become a favorite dish for dinner parties!

When the September issue of Bon Appetit arrived this is the one recipe that jumped out at us. We've made a lot of risotto, in a number of ways, over the past 20 years. This has probably been our favorite to date. We prefer to make everything the same day, however as with most good risotto recipes, this is fairly labor intensive. You many want to take advantage of the hints about preparing some of it ahead of time. Don't save this special recipe for company - treat yourself and prepare it this weekend!

This was absolutely amazing. I did the leek part the day before which was a good timesaver. I used mushroom stock which really enhanced the flavor. I roasted shrooms for 25 minutes. Some folks said that 45 minuted was too long so I checked them after 15 mins then another 10 and they were done. Used the truffle tapanade instead of the real truffles. Didn't know the difference. A great hearty wintery meal.

Delicious! I found the oven was broken in my new apartment, so I sauteed the mushrooms instead of roasting and it was still great. I used the truffle oil drizzeled on top of the finished risotto, which went over well, and I skipped the black truffles.

Very good. I roasted the mushrooms and onions for 45 minutes and they were very good. Instead of sprinkling truffle oil on the shrooms before roasting, I'll sprinkle the oil on the completed risotto the next time that I make this dish.

EXCELLENT! I did not use the optional black truffles and used chix stock which was what I had on hand. I would do it over and over again !!!!

This was an excellent dish that would work as an appetizer or vegetarian entree. I've tried the recipe twice now. Without the truffles, it's quite nice, with the truffles, superb.

This recipe is fantastic! I only cooked mushrooms 20 min., and also used truffle oil.

I agree that 45mins for the mushrooms and onions is too long...20-25 minutes does the trick...but certainly very tasy! Would most certainly make it again!

This risotto was a fabulous vegetarian enree.

This dish was absolutely fantastic! The only suggestion that I have is watch your mushrooms carefully when you are roasting them. I found that they did not need anywhere near the 45 minutes as the recipe suggests. I also used truffle oil as a substitute for the truffles and it still turned out superb. You have to try this!

I tried this recipe this past weekend, and it could not have turned out better. Restaurant quality at home! So flavorful, delicious, and relatively easy. The few extra steps are worth it. I used truffle oil, but due to its expense you may be able to use simple EVOO. I did not add the suggested truffles and the risotto was still fantastic.
