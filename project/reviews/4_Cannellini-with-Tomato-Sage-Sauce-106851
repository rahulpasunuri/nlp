Very delicious! Beans cooked this way were exceptionally flavorful, could eat them with a spoon. My substitutes: I used dried Italian herbs instead of sage, they worked very well. And cooking time for the beans should be less than 1hr. 30 mins of boiling after 8hrs of soaking was enough, so please be careful. Will make these beans again!

I agree with the positive reviews, but don't understand why these reviewers would stop at a mere three forks. Flavors are indeed subtle. Served over noodles it's filling in that most satisfying way. Delicious & healthy, easy to prepare in large batches, what more could one hope for?

Followed the directions for the beans but for the sauce I used "WHITE BEANS IN TOMATO SAUCE WITH SAGE AND PANCETTA" from this site. The addition of carrots, onions and pancetta made for an excellent combination.

loved it, made it twice already. did use a big can of tomatoes the second time and that worked just as well, just crush them up with a potato masher. I am amazed how well we like this rather subtle taste, when we usually go the hotter the better. The sage is great.

Wow. Simple ingredients combined to make fabulously complex flavors when simmered for a bit. I had to add a lot more salt to make these as savory as we like things, and I really loaded up on the fresh sage and used extra good olive oil (but less than called for). I'll make these again and again, esp. in winter.

This dish doesn't sound like much but it was amazing. Everyone loved it, and I'm thinking about making it by itself. It reminded me of eating beans in Tuscany!
