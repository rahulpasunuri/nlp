This was very tasty and simple to prepare. We used more chili garlic/less hoisin and it was still just a tad sweet for us. Also used flank steak sliced thinly against the grain and it was very tender.

Loved this recipe! I used the full amount of chili garlic sauce and it was very spicy... I think I'll tone it down a tiny bit next time. I marinated the beef in soy sauce for about 20 min before slicing. My husband and I really enjoyed it!

Excellent! Reduced chili-garlic to 1/4 of amt, so not too spicy.

It was good. I heeded the warnings about tough meat & used ribeye. Made a few other changes to suit our tastes. But the basic idea is good & I will make again.

There are much better easy stir fry recipes out there. This one is too sweet (probably thanks to all the hoisin) and too heavy on the cilantro. Such a waste of good steak. I definitely wouldn't do it again.

A delicious, easy stir fry. I used tri tip steak that I sliced very thinly. I also wanted more veggies, so I added slivered bok choy and more mushrooms (shiitake and baby bellas). I am not a fan of cilantro, so I skipped it and nobody felt it was needed.

Growing up in a household where stir-fry was a staple method of cooking, I would make this recipe a bit differently to enhance the flavours. First, marinate the beef in a bit of soya (or tamarind) with a teaspoon of sugar for about 20 minutes before you begin. This not only adds a ton of taste, but also tenderizes the beef. Next, throwing in the shallots with the ginger also enhances flavour. I added broccoli for texture. Needless to say, my first attempt following this recipe resulted in a dish that was a bit bland- I'm sure the next time will be better.

Pretty good, although not one of the better Bon Appetit Asian-inspired recipes I've made. I added some broccoli and bell pepper because I had it around and kicked up the chili-garlic sauce because I love spice. I didn't have the Chinese five-spice power but didn't miss it. Nice weeknight meal and the leftovers were even better!

I L-O-V-E this recipe. It's delicious, quick, and easy. My BF and I were trying a low-carb diet for a while and added sliced yellow bell peppers to the mix to bulk it up. We served it in lettuce cups, and it was perfect!

Really tasty mid-week meal. I had a bit of help prepping mushrooms and dinner was on the table in record time. Served over soba noodles with a little dash of sesame oil. Might reduce the hoisin sauce a little bit next time. I used the recommended amount of chili-garlic sauce and ended up adding more to my bowl, as did the boyfriend. Also agree with the comments to maybe throw in some more veggies although I don't think I'd choose carrots, seems kinda too sweet for this dish, maybe bok choy or broccoli?

Really a great recipe for how easy it was to put together! A definite family-pleaser. I used simple button mushrooms in place of shiitakes out of cost efficiency/personal preference, and was unable to find the 5-spice powder. To substitute, I used a tiny pinch of ground cloves and a tiny pinch of cinnamon. Such a great depth of flavor, and I think adding broccoli would be a great way to soak up more of the sauce. Served on hot white rice. Great weeknight meal! :D

Very tasty way to do a stir-fry! I thought I had 5-spice pwdr, but didn't so I didn't add it. Made it otherwise exactly as listed. It does have some heat if you use 2 tsp. of chili sauce, but great flavor!

Whole family loved the recipe, and I agree with one reviewer who said all chili garlic sauces are not created the same. Use half of the required chili garlic sauce if it is thai and not Chinese.

I followed this recipe to a T but added carrots and garlic and it was excellent. I found it a little more time consuming than 30 minutes with all the chopping of vegetables and whatnot but it was time well spent. I would definitely make this again!

This recipe was a big hit with my family. Being a working mom I look for fast recipes that are healthy and don't taste like I just threw it together. This recipe was perfect, it tastes like I was cooking all night, but it only took me 30 minutes!!! Next time I make this recipe I think I would add some carrots just to add more flavor (and more veggies for the kids to eat). I will definitely make this recipe again.

This was delicious! My husband (who is not fond of mushrooms) couldn't believe how good the shiitake were in it. Much flavor and depth. Will certainly make this again - it was fast and easy - great for a weeknight dinner.

quick easy and tasty. I think the garlic chili sauce intensity is really variable. If you use the kind in the jar from Vietnam - hot hot hot. The bottled kind from China is sweeter and not so hot. I mixed the hoisin, garlic/chili and five spice together ahead of time to get a sense of heat and found one tsp (from the far) to be plenty hot for a family dinner. Deglazed the wok with a little dry sherry to get all the good brown bits from the bottom. Overall a great dinner - served over noodles.

Love this recipe... easy to make and delicious! I have made this with both fresh and dried shiitakes (2 oz dried), and both versions are quite tasty.

Great easy weeknight meal! It's an easy recipe to scale up or down depending on how many people you are cooking for. I did decrease the amount of mushrooms (based on cost of shiitake) but added thinly sliced carrots, which added really nice color and flavor. I am not a big fan of cilantro, so I omitted that and the recipe didn't seem to be lacking in flavor without it. I also garlic to the hoisin - chili mixture. I cannot wait to make this again!

Very easy and delicious. I added soy sauce and extra chili garlic sauce for a kick. I also added some baby corn, broccolini and a few scallops to the dish, and served with brown rice. Will definitely make again.

This is very good, quick and easy to make. I have made it per the recipe and I have made a few modifications. Modifications I like: Cut the chili- garlic sauce in half (1 teaspoon), Instead of hoisin sauce I make a sauce out of 2 tablespoons oyster sauce, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon fish sauce.

Very good and easy. I used half shiitake and regular mushrooms. I didn't have the five spice so omitted it. Added garlic with the ginger. Very flavorful1

Good flavor and easy to make. I didn't have the garlic chili sauce so I used a little tabasco and added some minced garlic. Five spice gave a nice taste. Served it over steamed brown rice and it was great.

This dish was very simple to make. I liked it but I wasn't in LOVE with it. I felt like it needed less ginger, a little bit of soy sauce and LOTS of garlic. The cilantro threw me off a bit too. I was hesitant to purchase that many mushrooms because they were kind of spendy ($4 a box...i had to buy 3). In the end I could have had less mushrooms. BUT I have to say it will be great for left overs tomorrow.

I liked this and would make again with the following changes: I would cut down a little on the hoisen sauce, add 2 cloves of minced garlic (but I love garlic, 1 might be enough). I might try a splash of soy sauce in place of the five spice. I also put a dash of Asian sweet chili sauce on top upon serving which tasted great.

Very good. I used a "Sweet Chili Garlic Sauce" I found at the local Asian market that cut the heat and pumped up the sweet! I'm going to try adding scallops to the extra sauce from our leftovers...

This is fantastic! Tastes as good as anything you'll get in a restaurant. Used fillet steak and it was worth it. Also added some capsicum, bean shoots and carrots to up the veggie level. Family loved it.

Good but not great. As others suggested, I reduced the hoisin sauce by 1.5 tbsp. It may be a matter of personal taste, but the flavors didn't quite mesh with this dish, perhaps because of the five spice powder.

It's possible that this dish may taste phenomenal, however I couldn't tell you anything after the second bite because my taste buds were on fire. I'm a fan of the heat, but this was overkill, I had to finish my plate with a glass of milk. I'd highly recommend at least halfing the chili-garlic sauce.

This is a very easy and delicious addition to my weekday recipes. The hoisin and chili sauce made the sauce thick without any need for flour as some recipes call for. I did not use 5 spice as I did not have it yet still turned out good... next time I'll go buy 5 spice! I used beef chuck for the meat and it came out very tender. Next time I will use asparagus for the greens because I was not too fond of the snow peas.

Rating: 3
This is a really easy and delicions meal. I did not have fresh ginger or cilantro and I look forward to making it again with those ingredient. I don't think you really need a high quality meat because the sauce basically masks the flavor.

Rating: 4
I loved this recipe and it is as awesome and easy as everyone said. I did make some changes, substituting chicken for beef and barbecue sauce for hoisin. No just kidding. But, the mushrooms I bought were moldy, so they got tossed, and snow peas were sold out at the Kroger while asparagus were on sale. And since I got a deal on the asparagus, I took another reviewer's suggestion and used filet instead of sirloin. So, in the end I made the recipe sans mushrooms, substituting asparagus for peas and filet for sirloin. Not exactly what the author intended, but the sauce was great especially on the asparagus. I will make my version again for sure, and may try the correct way as well.

I thought the dish was wonderful. I agree that a better cut of meat would be helpful as the meat was a little tough.I used half shitake and half baby bella mushrooms(sliced thin) as the shitake mushrooms were too expensive but I think you would lose a lot of flavor without some shitakes. I loved the spices and thought the heat was perfect. The cilantro made it for me. It reminded me of the flavors in the pho we get at a Vietnamese restaurant.

I loved this dish - perfect for a weekday. It was so quick and easy to cook (espec. if you have all the chinese spices) and so satisfying. I halved the chilis, as recommended, but found it could use a little more kick. The snap peas and scallions add great color and make it a not-over-the-top meaty dish. Served over a little jasmine rice.

Wow. I have never written a review before but I set up an account specifically for the purpose of writing one for this recipe. As someone who spent a year in China, and is constantly searching for both recipes and restaurants that can replicate some of the dishes I had while living there, this one made my heart skip a beat. I followed the recipe quite closely, with the exception of adding a clove of pressed garlic with the ginger, and substituting some soy sauce for the hoisin to thin it out. The five spice powder gives the dish many levels of wonderful flavor...and it looks great too with all the green added in the end! Served with white rice, this dish is easy to make, fast, and satisfying...win.

I forgot to add that I made a "mushroom only" version for a vegetarian family member, and that was great too. The missing beef not "missed" by the rest who gave it a try.

I made it exactly as directed, and it was yummy. My heat-averse son found it a bit too spicy, but I added some sambal oelek to mine to get the spice level I prefer. I disagree with decreasing the hoisin; I found that so much of the sauce was absorbed by the mushrooms that there was only a thin coating on the peas. I also think that the shiitakes are crucial; white button mushrooms would not be nearly as good. I think this will become a "go-to" inour house.

Rating: 3
Agree with earlier reviewer that reducing the Hoisin isn't a bad idea -- it did weigh down the veggies a bit. I added a head of broccoli (steamed it a bit in the microwave first), which added some volume and boosted nutrition. Very good and easy -- great alternative to ordering greasy, MSG-laden Chinese food after a long day. NB: Omitted cilantro. Blech.

Rating: 4
This was delicious and easy! Just a few notes: make sure to cut the beef very thin, maybe like matchsticks, and don't over-cook! Remember that after you fry it for a minute, it will still be cooking for another 3-5 minutes as you add the other ingredients. Also, shitakes aren't completely necessary. I think you can use any mushroom, or combo, because you saute them in sesame oil, which becomes their dominant flavor. However, don't skimp on the mushrooms.

Rating: 1
Okay, but to much cilantro and I love cilantro the combination was not great. Use a good cut of meat and marinate so it will tender. Tasted better after it sat awhile.

This is a fabulous meal and the bonus is that it is so quick and easy. I used one slighly rounded teas. of chili garlic sauce and about 3 TBS of chopped ginger. This was the right amount of spice for us. Will definitely repeat!

This was a very tasty dish! Perfect after a hard workout. And easy to make. I added in a red pepper, left out the five spice and ginger. I had to use about 3 table spoons of the sesame oil with the mushrooms. I also added more chili paste and it was extra spicy, which is perfect in my book.

Very tasty. Next time I will reduce the Hoisin sauce because it weighed down the veggies. I added water chestnuts for some nice crunch. I used 1 tsp of chili garlic and it was flaming hot....too hot for my 8 yr old daughter :-( Also had trouble getting the mushrooms cooking with the limited oil so had to add more.

Very good and easy stir fry. I used snap peas cut in half, 4oz shitake mushrooms, 8oz white mushrooms and next time I would start with one tsp chili garlic sauce and then add more if you wanted it spicy. I also added a few Tablespoons of water to thin the sauce. It was really good.
