Followed this recipe exactly as written. Wow! So much flavor! I had to boil down the pomegranate juice and it worked out great. Will definitely make again.

Yuk. Too much EVERYTHING and none of it worked together. A TABLESPOON of cumin? And this comes from a vegetarian who loves Middle Eastern food. I doubt I'll ever make this again but if I do, I'll start with a 1/2 teaspoon of cumin and work my way up.

This dressing is fantastic. I will definitely make it again and again.

Loved this on the pizza! Will try on lots of other things too.

Really a versatile dressing. Have used it on the salad and the pizza, but also wonderful drizzled over piquillo peppers filled with goat cheese and pine nuts. This haw been my go-to party plate for the summer.

I've made this three times in a row! And I've been having it on everything ....a dressing on a tomato, lettuce sandwich, on quinoa, on salads of all sorts. So delicious every time! I doubled the amount of pomegranate syrup, reduced the amount of olive oil, used fresh mint from the garden (although I made it without and it was still great) and used freshly toasted cumin that I roughly ground. So I took some liberties but am (I'm sure you can tell) in love with this.
