This is a great recipe! Have made a couple times now and enjoy adding them to a bed of baby greens with pear and gorgonzola or blue cheese. The dressing I use is olive oil and pear infused white balsamic vinager.

I think this is the BEST recipe on Epi! I love caramelized walnuts on my salads, they add such a flare and fanciness. They could be quite pricey, however. I was skeptical at how easy this recipe was. And was not sure about the balsamic vinegar. Boy was I wrong. After about 5 minutes (that's all it took) the house was filled with a wonderful aroma of chocolate, thats right it smelled like chocolate! The nuts came out perfect! Very crunchy and delicious. Served them sprinkled in on arugula, green apple and Gorgonzola salad with a simple balsamic vinaigrette and got rave reviews. I am not sure how long they would last however. So far made twice and only lasted two days due to my consistent snacking. Highly recommended!!!

This recipe was extremely easy to make, and the results were good. The nuts would be a nice complement in any salad as it has a tartness; they were a bit sour for snacking alone.

one more thing: I too used a high quality balsamic vinegar and believe this significantly contributes to the flavours. I followed the directions exactly for preparing and required about 10 minutes baking time in the oven.

I would actually give the recipe 3.5 stars - would cut back ever so slightly on teh balsamic (maybe 1.5 tbs balsamic) as I thought there was just a tad too much acidity in the final product; otherwise delicious. I prepared these for the arugula/manchego/date/apple salad and it complemented the flavours quite well. Could definitely snack on as is though!

go ahead and make 3 or 4 times the amount you are planning to. you will eat handfuls of these without realizing you've done so.

ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!!! I made these with a good quality Balsamic (and I think that the quality of the vinegar is really relevant to how scrumptious the result is). My impression, however, is that this is a very basic recipe that can be adapted to use different vinegars, and different nuts. That's something I'll try in the future... but if you just make these according the recipe as written, you won't be disappointed.

Reading all the reviews, I wondered why so much variation in baking time. It turns out that it cooks in 10 minutes in the oven as long as the stovetop mixture is adequately caramelized.

Made these on the spur of the moment to go over salad - they were very easy and came out quite nice. Will make again.

Balsamic vinegar gives nuts a nice flavour. Found syrup didn't really caramelize in the oven. Perhaps it was because I added lots more nuts but they ended up in the ovenn for at least half an hour. Next time I'll turn up the heat a little.

Had to keep mine in for 15 min. Maybe a minute or 2 longer next time. Very good! Freeze well.

The dates made it too sweet, and the cheese didn't seem to have enough kick. But the nuts (used pecans) were delicious!

The glaze has a great flavor - vinegar gives it a nice something you can't put your finger on quality. Works well with almonds and pecans, too. Add some pumpkin pie spice before stirring in the nuts for a holiday twist. Baking 20-25 minutes works well. Yum!

We loved this recipe. We used in a salad with grilled chicken, feta, red onion and it was a great addition. I will definately be making this again. I thought they were great to eat plain too!

I made the syrup in a casi iron skillet, turned off the heat and stirred in the walnuts. The nuts were quite coated and didnt need to be stirred in the oven. I almost doubled the nuts and still thought they were coated a bit heavily. They didnt stick at all to the foil, but parchement or silpat is a great idea

Use parchment paper instead of the foil and cooking spray. No need to stir! and the nuts cool quickly because you can remove the parchment paper off the hot pan.

These nuts are wonderful in salads! Try adding a sprinkle of cayenne and your on to something really good......

These really made my arugula salad unique. Make sure to stir them often in the oven to distribute the caramel evenly or else they will stick to the foil and make a huge mess. Still, delicious.

Easy and a huge hit. Also had to bake longer than directed.

Everybody loved these in the arugula salad, but I had exactly opposite the experience from ealier reviewers in preparation. While I stirred them several times, I burned the first batch by keeping them in the oven the recommended 20 minutes (my oven temp is accurate). Twelve to fourteen minutes tops to get them done and caramelized beautifully. Ovens do vary, so keep a close eye on these so as not to burn them like I did the first time.

These walnuts really made the arugula salad. The salad would not have been the same without them. I loved these walnuts!!!

Ditto with timing. Sugar did not reach candy hardness in time originally stated in recipe. I placed the nut & sugar mixture on a cookie tray lined with a silpat mat, eliminating the need for the vegetable oil spray. Easy cleanup! Cheers.

A fun and easy recipe; the balsamic vinegar adds complexity and great color. I suggest using non-stick spray liberally on foil, and the 25-minute cooking time seems more accurate.

I have to admit that I hesitated when I saw the sugar and balsamic vinegar combination, however, these two contrasting flavors worked just fine and created an absolutely delicious snack. Although I tried to follow instructions, I had to keep it in the oven a total of 25 minutes. I'm not quite sure I understand why it took so long, but it all worked out fine in the end. I will definitely make this again. It also could not have been easier.

I made these to use with a green salad, and they were delicious. Definitely a keeper.
