I thought this was a nice chicken salad--nice, but I'm not raving. I liked getting away from the mayonnaise-coated versions. I think it might be better with some pineapple in it as well.

This is a tasty and simple recipe. The fresh thyme really adds a nice flavor, and the mango in the salad is key. This recipe is now part of our 2 week rotation!

Surprisingly good. Don't skip the marinade (the olive oil keeps the chicken breast from drying out), and definitely don't skip the watercress. Add a little more thyme and you'll have yourself a lovely and refreshing summer salad.

This dish is surprisingly easy and got 2 way big thumbs up from my husband and grade school girls. A good ripe mango and fresh ciabatta bread are key. I used greek yogurt in place of the sourcream and didn't feel I made any taste trade-offs. Enjoy.

Checked my July 1993 issue and found that 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar is called for (missing in the computer version.) Going to try it myself this week.

The only thing missing was the amount of vinegar in the ingredients section. I had to improvise

Very good recipe. I added one tablespoon of taragon vinegar and used a little arugala as I had no watercress. Very quick and easy meal for a summer dinner. It's nice to have one dish resolve both the salad and entree for the evening. Served fresh artichoke with lemon-garlic butter on the side.

How much vinager? - that may be why no one has made it yet. I used 2 T vinager. I just made it for 2, so I had lots of mango. The dressing was quite good. (I didn't use the red cabbage or watercress)
