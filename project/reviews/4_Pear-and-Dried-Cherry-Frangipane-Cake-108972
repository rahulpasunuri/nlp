Made this as a Christmas-morning coffeecake and it was so easy and good. I had it for dessert the next night, topped with a little whipped cream. This is the kind of dish that you make once and ask yourself, "Why don't I make this more often to just have around the house?" It's easy enough to make regularly. Only annoying thing is the use of almond paste - at around $8 dollars per 7-oz tube, it doesn't come cheap.

This cake is great for dessert or as a coffee cake. I have made it many times and always get rave reviews. Be careful not to over bake.

Fabulously easy dessert/breakfast cake. I used 3 pears as mine were on the small side, and a 10" springform pan, and the cake came out beautifully. It probably could benefit from a doubling of the almond paste topping; but the cake was so good that I'll probably skip it moving forward--unless I'm trying to impress. It's a pretty expensive ingredient and I think the cake can stand on it's own without it. Highly recommend! Yummy!

Made this wonderful dessert for guests who loved it. First try, the centre was too wet, so I baked a little longer and the subsequent occasions it was wonderful. A friend asked for the recipe and substituted cranberries for the cherries. Do not do this.. the richness of the cherries together with the pears make this a very special dessert.

I am just about to make this cake; I am nervous, since no one can tell me how much a 'large' pear should weigh. I purchased two Bosc pears with a total weight of 20oz. Wish me luck! I will report on the results

Oh my. This is sooo good. I've made it with marzipan paste (easier to get here) -- works beautifully. I've also baked it with dried cranberries -- also great. I've gifted it to a half dozen people during the winter holidays -- and everyone asks for the recipe. Lovely.

This really was terrific! I added the extra pear, soaked the cherries in brandy, served it with marscapone as suggested. Most had seconds. I agree, 1 hr. - 1hr. 10mins. should do for cooking time.

Delicious and easy! I used 1/4 c. olive oil and a 1/4 c. walnut oil since I didn't have enough olive oil. I think the nutty oil complimented the winter fruits and almond paste. I made this for a dinner party where there was too much food, so I served for New Year's Day brunch instead. It was wonderfully moist and flavorful the next day. My boyfriend's mom had 3 slices! And his aunt and sister asked for the recipe. It helped me make a good first impression.

This cake is fabulous! It was the perfect ending to a casual fall meal of soup and salad. I saved it to my recipe box and will definitely be making this again and again!

Exceptionally good, and really easy departure from the usual sort of coffee cake . I took another reviewer's suggestion and added a third pear and soaked the cherries in brandy first. Could someone explain the difference between almond paste and marzipan? I could only find the latter, and it seemed to be made of just almonds, sugar, and maybe corn syrup. Came in an 11 oz can (and was very expensive). I mixed it w/2 eggs for the topping and added some Amaretto and it seemed to work o.k., but did get very brown on top before the rest of the cake was done. I ended up having to cover it with foil and bake it for even longer than the recipe indicated, perhaps because of the extra fruit in the batter creating a very thick cake. I'll continue to try to find the almond paste, and next time might use a 10 inch springform rather than the 8 inch to accommodate the extra fruit and bring the baking time back to what the recipe suggests .

No need to double topping. Just drop in spoonfuls. As it bakes it will spread and cover cake.

This was really excellent. I tasted the batter when still wet, and was a little concerned, but the cake is perfection. Not too sweet, very moist. I took other reviewers suggestions and doubled the topping. I couldn't find the almond paste, so made my own from another recipe on the site. Use the almond flour from Trader Joe's.

I made this as written, with the exception of soaking the cherries in brandy for an hour or so. Served it as a "birthday" cake for a friend, along with a roasted chicken and roasted root veggies on a bed of greens. It was a big hit - moist and excellent blend of flavors. I had problems spreading the almond paste topping, but the lack of eveness just added to the rustic charm of this delicious cake!

Yum, delicious. Made exactly as written except missed out the cherries as had none and wanted something cakey anyway, used water instead of milk so that it should not be dairy. Also put less cinammon in the topping as was worried about an overpowering cinammon taste. Will add this recipe to my favourites as its tasty and always happy to find good recipes with healthier fats rather than butter or margarine. I made it in two smallish rectangle pans and worked great, no need for extra topping.

This cake has been a Christmas Eve tradition of ours ever since I saw the recipe in the magazine. I sure winner!!

This cake was wonderful, and well-received at Thanksgiving. It is very moist and is great the next day for a sweet breakfast. I followed others' advice and increased the amount of almond paste topping (I multiplied all amounts by 1.5, and used 2 eggs) - it was just the right amount.

This is a very special dessert and perfect for entertaining. Make it when pears are at their peak. I buy dried Montmorency cherries at Trader Joes. I followed the suggestion to soak the cherries in brandy, which I think was inspired. I didn't think the cake needed any sweet topping, but some whipped cream or creme fraiche might be nice.

Delicious! Only change to the recipe I made was adding 1 Tbsp. brandy to the dried cherries. Baked in a 9-inch springform for 1 hour.

Absolutely delicious, and the perfect ratio of fruit to batter. I boiled the cherries in Grand Marnier so they were extra moist and flavorful. So easy, I'll definitely make again!

This was a very pleasant fruitcake, perfect with a cup of tea for a light afternoon snack. I used dried, sweetened tart cherries and a slightly unripe pear and found the sweet/tart ratio perfect. The topping is great. The marzipan flavor is there, but not overpowering. Would definitely recommend this as a nice fruit cake, just slightly different from the average.

Who would believe that a cake made with extra-light olive oil would taste this delicious? In addition to this healthy oil, I used Splenda sugar substitute, high fiber Nutriblend flour, three pears, and a mix of dried blueberries, raspberries, and dried Montmorency cherries. I also used two eggs in the topping mixture. This cake was certainly easy to mix, and made a very tasty dessert which I served with a caramel crunch ice-cream.

This recipe is great! The frangipan part is moist and almondy and amazing. It can be a coffee cake or can make a spectacular dessert when served with berry ice cream. You can make the almond paste using the recipe on this site. It is especially easy if you have access to Trader Joes and can use their almond meal. So simple! I've made this cake twice -- the first time with dried cranberries instead of cherries, and the second time with frozen blueberries instead of cherries. Both times it worked out great, although it takes longer to bake than the recipe says.

I thought this was a very sophisticated sub for a traditional fruit cake. Topped it with homemade caramel sauce and fresh whip cream. Will use this as boxed holiday gifts. Very good!!

Rating: 3
Tasty and very easy. As other reviewers suggested I substituted canola oil for the olive oil but the taste of the oil came through too strongly for me. Next time I will try it with the extra light olive oil. Also, the frangipane topping sank into the batter but it did so unevenly. Perhaps I'll try putting it in the pan first, then covering with the cake batter!

Absolutely delicious. I have served this at dinner parties--usually with creme fraiche--and given it as a gift. Always to rave reviews. My only change is to make more topping (an extra 1/3 or so).

I will make this cake over and over as it was absolutely fabulous. The contrast between the pears and the sour dried cherries was delicious. As other reviewers had suggested, I used canola oil rather than olive oil and used an extra egg in the topping. It was a big hit.

A really delicious cake. Very easy--I'd definitely make this again. I made a few changes. I was leary of using olive oil, used vegetable oil instead. Added an extra pear and one cup of dry cherries with 1/3 cup of golden raisins and tossed about 2 Tb spiced rum with the fruit. (couldn't taste it at all though.) The almond flavor is subtle but I thought this was a plus. All the flavors work well together. No one taste overpowers the others.

This is a recipe I will make again. I changed the recipe a little, but I don't think it changed the results enought to make a difference. I used corn oil, 1 c, dried cherries, and instead of self rising flour I used regular flour and added 2 tsp. baking powder and 1/2 tsp. salt. I forgot to add the cinnamon in the almond paste, so I added it to the powdered sugar & sprinkled it on top. I really didn't care for that...but my husband liked it. The next day when the flavors blended I thought it tasted better. I think I would like it better if the almond topping recipe was doubled. This recipe wasn't overly sweet and was very tasty...This cake would be a nice addition to a brunch.

I doubled the cake & topping quantities and baked it in a tube pan. It was wonderful, but next time I'd make 2 separate batches and double the topping for each. The cake layer is a little *too* tall in a tube pan and you become impatient to reach the almond crumble! I also used dried cranberries soaked in brandy: I can't say enough good things about this cake!

This is a terrific, moist cake that keeps and transports well. Using olive oil is convenient, and the combination of flavors is intriguing. I used only 4 oz. almost paste and a smaller amount of dried cherries and it came out fine. The next time I replaced cherries with dried cranberries - that was fine, too. I only needed to bake this cake about an hour (I used a 9-inch springform pan.)

The self-rising flour made this recipe too salty for us. I called the 1-800 number, there was a problem with the blend on my package. If you don't have self-rising flour use these proportions to make your own: 1 cup flour, 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder, 1/2 tsp. salt 1 extra egg in the almond topping made it very easy to spread - we thought the dried cherries would benefit from soaking in amaretto and yes the extra pear is needed. All of the suggestions were very helpful. Thank you

Since first trying this on Thanksgiving, I have had multiple requests for both more cakes and the recipe. Tip: if you like your cake more moist, use slightly more pear and make it a day ahead. It is excellent served as an accompaniment to coffee at either breakfast or dessert. We liked it even better with sweetened dried cranberries instead of cherries. Enjoy!!

Excellent! Moist and delicious (I only baked it for 1 hour 10 minutes). Wonderful fruit flavour. The topping turned out fine for me.

Found the recipe a little dry. I might try it again but double the height of the marzipan topping (which was great)

After adding almond extract to the batter, and whipped cream and cranberry relish as toppings, the cake was still bland and got an "OK" rating from the family. Very dissapointed. One problem might be that I tried serving it as a dessert after a meal instead of lighter breakfast fare.

The cake was tender, tasty, and not too sweet, but the topping was a bit of a disappointment. If I do this again, I will omit it or substitute a sugar, butter, and cinnamon crumb. As it was, the topping was hard to spread around on the surface of the batter; it kept wanting to sink in the middle of the pan. The result was that some pieces had way too much "topping," which penetrated deep into the cake itself, and some pieces were devoid of much topping. In any case, this was my first experience using almond paste, and I found the taste a bit too strong, at least in this application. Two other things that may be worth noting: having no "non-stick spray" in my kitchen, I used butter, which worked just fine and has no frightening chemicals in it. Also, the pears I used were unripe, more like crunchy apples, and yet they became soft, flavorful and tender in the baking process.
