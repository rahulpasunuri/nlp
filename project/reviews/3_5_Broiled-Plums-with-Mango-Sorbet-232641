I just made this for a dinner party with plums fresh off our tree. I multiplied the recipe by 6 (using two pans) and it turned out fantastic. I served the broiled plums over small scoops of vanilla ice cream rather than Mango sorbet, since I worried it would be too tart otherwise; the balance of creamy sweetness was perfect against the plums. I will definitely make this again!

This is a wonderful recipe. I increased the amount of plums to 1 pound for 6 people and felt it was just right. The aroma and taste were divine. Just the right ending for an Oriental dinner.

This is a wonderful recipe. I used twice as many plums, about 1 pound, for 6 people and thought the quantity was just right. It is a perfect ending for an Oriental dinner
