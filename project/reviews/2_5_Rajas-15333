I understand that this recpie is from the 80's, and the most gourmet cook wanted to utilize canned good much more than fresh veggies, but this is awful! Rajas means strips, and it refers to roasted poblano chiles that have been sliced into strips, then sauteed with cream, onion, and salt (you can also add some corn kernels for a nice flavor contrast between smoky and sweet and added texture). It is ALL about the smoky freshness of the chiles, and cannot possibly be replicated with canned chiles!
