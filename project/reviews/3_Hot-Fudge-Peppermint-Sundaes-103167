A great, quick, and delicious hot fudge recipe. It easily passed the family tasting committee. The only thing wrong with the recipe is that it claims to serve 6. My guesstimate is that it serves a dozen or so, depending on how much you use. I made it for the four of us and enough left for three more meals. I would suggest halving the recipe unless you are serving a crowd.

This hot fudge was delicious. I made it the day before I planned to serve it and it heated beautifully in the microwave. Just make sure that you heat it long enough when making it to ensure that the sugar has completed melted.

I thought this recipe was great. I love chocolate and peppermint together. The hot fudge did get chewy when it hit the cold ice cream like the recipe said it would. I know some people like this. I actually prefer hot fudge to stay soft. Even so, it's a tasty recipe.
