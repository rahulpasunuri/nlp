I don't feel moved to write recipe reviews too often but wow this tart was absolutely amazing! I thought about doing a different shortbread crust but changed my mind after reading that the tart bakes for an additional 45 min - this would have been too long for a more buttery crust. I made the Almond Sable dough and I definitely tasted the almond unlike some reviewers - it completely made the dish!! Like many reviewers I subbed in some honey for the corn syrup which certainly wasn't cheap but again worth it. The almond dough and the filling tweaked a bit to increase the amount (by a fifth or so) was enough to do an 11" and an 8" tart - if you're only making one 9" tart definitely cut the filling recipe nearly in half. Even with an 11" tart I think it only ended up baking for 35-40 min - it browns and bubbles quickly so watch it closely after 35 minutes. And enjoy!

This recipe was great and a big hit with friends & visitors alike! I am excited to try it again, only next time I think I'll try an almond shortbread for the crust. I thought the rosemary cream went quite well with the pine nut flavour but others were not as enthusiastic about a savoury cream. If you suspect this is the case perhaps make a smaller batch. As for proportions, I got 2 full pies out of this recipe (filling and crust) and I used a regular 9 1/2-inch pie dishes. Overall I thought it was a fun twist on the traditional pecan pie.

So... I just took this out of the oven and am frustrated. First, I had an 11" tart pan, which barely held the batter. A 9" is certainly a mistake. I read the reviews and was very, very careful to ensure there were no cracks or holes in the crust other than the fork pokes...I followed the directions exactly and so was surprised by the aroma of burning sugar only 20 minutes in...looked in the oven, and about 1/4 of the filling had leaked out all over the cookie sheet, making a monster mess. It looks okay, and there appears to be plenty of filling, but at this point, my advice is to skip the poking holes step. And for heaven's sake, line the cookie sheet with aluminum foil. If it's as yummy as it smells, I might make again with these adjustments. Oh yeah, any ideas for what to do with the other half of the (very expensive) Almond Sable Dough?

I've been wanting to make this tart forever...and let me say it was well worth the wait. It was my contribution to Thanksgiving dinner this year. AND it was AMAZING! I did use just 1/2c of corn syrup and subbed honey for the other 1/2c. Everyone loved the unique flavors of pine nuts with the rosemary cream.

I made this tart exactly as written, and I thought that it was wonderful. The rosemary whipped cream really made it outstanding. I had a dinner party that included a bunch of foodies, and they all raved. I will definitly make it again and again.

This tart won rave reviews from all at our Thanksgiving table. The rosemary cream is fantastic!! I followed someone else's suggestion snd used honey - did half corn syrup; half honey - it was perfect. What a great addition to the table!! Definitely garnish with the sugared rosemary sprig - it makes the dessert!!

Excellent! I substituted corn syrup for top quality organic honey (I don't understand why one would use such a low quality product with a luxirious product such as pine nuts). Also due lack of time, I baked this ahead of time and reluctantly froze it. It turned out just great. Careful to not overbeat the cream, it should be soft, almost custard like.

I should note that I didn't really follow the recipe: I used a punition dough for crust, honey in the filling, and orange zest instead of vanilla. It was delicious on its own...however, the candied rosemary and rosemary cream took it to another level. Made it for Pi Day. I had doubted that heated cream would whip properly, so I just sweetened my cream with the sugar left over from candying the rosemary (I let the wet rosemary sit buried in the sugar for quite a while.)

This disappeared quickly. The rosemary whipped cream was delicious with the heavy sweetness of the tart filling. I agree that the taste of almonds in the crust is lost, so any shortbread type crust would work. While I used a 9-1/2" tart pan, I still had way too much filling, which was a problem because the nuts had already been mixed in. Next time, I will reserve a sizeable chunk of the filling before I add nuts, and then pour the filling (with all the nuts) in first, topping up the tart with the remainder.

This tart is delicious and it's fun to make. The pine nuts give it a lightness from the traditional pecans, but they are very expensive. I'm sure walnuts would have been fine, too. I couldn't find almond flour, but my pastry chef friend told me that almond flour is ground up almonds. So I got a bunch of sliced almonds (the really thin ones), put 'em in the food processor, and voila! Two things I learned. Make sure there are no cracks in the crust. The filling is sticky, and if there are cracks, it's really hard to remove the tart from the pan. Secondly, cream will not whip if it isn't really cold. Yes, the recipe says to make the ice bath, and then whisk by hand. That takes forever. Cool down the rosemary-steeped cream in the fridge, and keep the rest of it cold, too. Whip with an immersion blender, a food processor, or some other gadget!

why not replace the corn syrup with honey? it's a natural pairing for both rosemary and pine nuts. the almond sable is slight overkill on the nut front. a nice cornmeal, olive oil flavoured crust would be better.

What a hit at Thanksgiving dinner! It has such an elegant flavor with the rosemary cream! Will definitly be making this again!

WOW, the rosemary cream is fantastic and I have used it for many savory and sweet dishes. The tart itself is very good but becomes spectacular with the rosemary cream. I have since made the cream with lavender and used it with phenomenal success

My husband made this for an anniversary dinner and it was luscious! Loved the rosemary cream and almond crust. Will definitely add to our list of 'musts'.

This is good, but it´s fundamentally a pecan pie made with pine nuts. The tart shell is sort of an almond shortbread, but the real difference is the addition of the rosemary cream which will find more use in my repertoire. Roll the dough out quickly as soon as it's malleable enough, otherwise it will start splitting. However, any holes plug readily --- no one will ever know.

I made this for a dinner party of eight foodies, and everyone raved. Definitely do not skip the rosemary cream, as it takes the tart to a whole other level.

I took a chance and made this for a potluck dinner despite the lack of reviews. It was definitely a hit. I had a little trouble rolling out the dough (it was a little dry) -- but after adding some water it eventually came together (or at least enough to use). Everyone at the table gave it four forks!
