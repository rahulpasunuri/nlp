This recipe is superb appetizer, big hit at a dinner party. I reduced the mushrooms as other reviewers had suggested. As others have also mentioned, the leftovers keep well in the freezer. I made a crustless quiche with my leftover the next day that was fantastic!

Very good. I reduced the mushrooms as suggested. Love the fact that they keep well in the freezer- I had extras for dinner the day after the party!

I went a little lighter on the cinnamon based on previous reviews and wish I hadn't. The warm spices gave such an interesting scent and pungent flavor. Everyone raved about these delicious morsels. All that was missing was a tart note to balance the flavors. I may experiment with yogurt or dill and lemon.

Fantastic hors d'oeuvre. Only change I made was to omit the cinnamon. It did take a while to fold the triangles--next time I might try the tip to use phyllo cups. I think a lower-fat chicken Italian sausage might also work . . . I even wonder about using vegetarian Italian-style soy sausage.

Best hors d'eurves I have ever had. Reduced the mushrooms, added a sprinkle of cinnimon, no nutmeg, and 3/4 lb. feta and 1 lb sausage. Amazing

Next time I will omit the cinnamon. The flavor is much too pronounced. Also, beware, rolling the triangles is very time consuming.

These are my most requested hors douvres for parties! I use Phyllo cups, much easier to work with, and substitute Chevre for Feta. Cook the sausage, mix everything together in the food processor and spoon into cups -- takes about 15 minutes worth of prep and everyone raves!

I made this for a wine-tasting, and substituted gruyere for the feta to make it more compatible with the wine; it was fabulous. I used 8 oz. of grated gruyere instead of the crumbled feta. Everyone raved. Also, instead of making triangles, which I've done before, we made much speedier "bundles" by cutting each sheet of phyllo into 6 squares. Using one square per appetizer, brush butter on one side, flip it over and place about 1/2 tablespoon of filling onto the center of the unbuttered side. Gently pull up the four corners and give a slight twist. Bake per instructions. You can make a huge batch in a flash this way.

It is time consuming but they last a long time in the freezer and are delicious.

These are just terrific! They take a lot of effort but well worth it if you're looking for raves from your guests. Use mild italian sausage. It goes so well with the feta. And do freeze ahead. You will have extras for your family to make quick, gourmet snacks!

I made the full recipe and have most of them in my freezer right now, but made a few just to sample them (I'm serving them at a party next week). The flavor was not what I expected--the tastes of the sausage and the feta were lost. For all the time I spent on them, I was somewhat disappointed. Next time I'll lower the amounts of spices, put in less red pepper (I probably had a bit too much), and maybe fewer mushrooms. I made this because I like sausage and LOVE feta, but can barely taste them. Maybe I'll change my review after the party if others find them appealing....

We had these at a party and everyone loved them, so got the receipe and made them ourselves..they went so fast! wonderful. they freeze beautifully. i made them and layered them in a box with wax paper, took them right out of the freezer and baked them they held together great, looked wonderful, tasted superb. a big plus for a do ahead app!

I would add more sausage and try a sage or other herbed sausage.

Made these for a party and they were gone in seconds. One man said, "Please tell me you didn't make these and that I can buy them somewhere." I was sorry to disappoint him. These were also very convenient because I made them ahead and froze them.

This may be intimidating to those who have never worked with phyllo before, but if the directions are followed carefully it is a fun appetizer to prepare. The only thing I would do differently the next time I make this dish is use more feta and less mushrooms.
