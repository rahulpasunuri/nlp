This was simple, and it came out beautifully. We had a 7 kg turkey. I took it out of the fridge about 40 minutes before rubbing in the butter so the meat wouldn't be too cold. I followed the recipe almost exactly, just rubbing in more salt and olive oil than was called for into the skin. Roasting time was nearly 4 hours, and we let it rest about 45 minutes...perfectly cooked, moist, flavourful, and well-received by an Italian crowd with very high food standards. 7 kg were just right for 8 adults and 4 children. My only advice to add is to be cautious when rubbing yhe herbed butter inside the bird...the bones are quite sharp, and can puncture and scratch. A great recipe to make in Italy...I got all of the ingredients in a mornings' shopping, all in our neighbourhood.

I find turkey is a very difficult protein to take on flavor, so I was skeptical. I followed the recipe as-is, but next time would use more butter than just 1/2 a stick. It's an incredibly fragrant bird and the house smells absolutely wonderful while it cooks. The gravy is very aromatic and flavorful. I would use this base recipe for a pork or chicken dish also (just change the broth). I made the butter the day before and I used broth (with the neck and kidneys seared and cooked with the broth) to make the gravy the morning of so I didn't have to make it before serving by waiting for the turkey to finish (though I did add the drippings to final product for that extra punch of flavor). This is a great turkey recipe and very easy to make.

All of the wonderful ingredients and hard work I put into this "trial run" turkey should have yielded something great, but my entire family was totally underwhelmed by this recipe. I wanted this to be very flavorful and savory, but it wasn't at all. It was bland and the gravy tasted off. I guess I'll stick with the classic this year.

First turkey I've ever cooked! This recipe seems really user friendly: the hardest part is maneuvering the turkey and I think that's unavoidable with any recipe involving roasting a giant bird. My family isn't American so I don't have much experience with turkey, but I think this turned out well! I thought the white meat was only slightly dry, but my bird was a little smaller so that's probably my bad.

The single best turkey I have ever made. Only reviewing the butter part here, since I strayed too far to review the gravy part. Seriously tasty turkey, and I even had to use a generic Jenni-O turkey (got it free from work; how could I say no?). I am infamous for undercooking a turkey, so I just roasted the h*** out of this bird until the little red thermometer popped up, and even then, it was the most juicy turkey I have ever made. People were picking at the carcass after it was devoured. Make this!

This year was my first ever Thanksgiving out in the US, and my sister and I made our first ever Thanksgiving Turkey, using this recipe. It was a huge success, the turkey was gorgeous, tasted wonderful and the gravy completed everything perfectly. Our friends loved it (and they know turkey) and now everyone back home wants us to make it next year! We couldn't have done it without this recipe, so thanks for that!

Made this last year and all agreed it was the best turkey we had ever eaten, and we have many turkeys between our middle-aged selves. I stuffed with my families Italian sausage stuffing and it is a perfect complement to the pancetta/sage rub and gravy. The bird was so moist and the flavors so good. We also brined overnight in a sea salt/apple cider/beer brine that we just sort of made up after much wine the night before. It rocked.

Rating: 4
Sensational! This was the first Thanksgiving turkey I ever cooked, and it couldn't have been easier or tastier. The only change I made was to stuff the turkey with my family's traditional sausage stuffing. I think this may become my go-to Thanksgiving bird. Only warning for others (especially novices) would be to allow more time than you think for making the butter and rubbing it under the skin. Handling a buttery 15-pound turkey was harder than I anticipated...

This was my very first year making a Turkey. This was beyond a hit. This was the BEST turkey I have every tasted. The receipt was not difficult to make and well worth any additional trouble it would take to prepare it. I wish I had made a double portion of the gravy because there was not enough to go around. I highly recommend this receipt.

This Thanksgiving was the first time I ever (as in ever!) cooked a turkey and this recipe made it easy and delicious. Note also that I was cooking in a friend's kitchen because my own is under renovation, using gas appliances instead of the electric I have suffered with for the past 15 years. The leftover meat made incredibly delicious sandwiches.

Solid dish. The pancetta-sage butter is probably perfectly designed, and who doesn't enjoy getting personal under the skin of their bird. I sometimes have doubts about whether any of these rubs actually makes a difference with turkeys, particularly laden with gravy. This gravy was great. No suggested changes, *except* the cooking time if you go with a different stuffing. I went with a 7.75kg bird (roughly 17lbs) which was stuffed, and ran this bad boy for about 4.5 hours in the oven -- and STILL there were a few places a little too red for one's liking. Don't be afraid to run this longer in the oven with a larger bird, the butter on top of and under the skin will keep things fine, so long as you baste semi-regularly and tent for the last hour.

Was fantastic! The gravy was so so tasty. Make sure you so use a food processor for the butter and get the pancetta completely pasty or it will be rubbery when you are done. I doubled the butter recipe for the bird...not the healthiest option but definately enhanced the dish!

I made this for Thanksgiving and the whole family raved "best turkey ever!". I did make extra PS Butter and was quite liberal with it, but other than that, no changes. I am making it again for New Year's Eve!!!

I served this as part of an Italian Christmas Buffet. It is yummy but requires a bit more time than the usual herbed roasted turkey I've done in the past. I think I can improve on the roasting next time and the recipe will be more appreciated.

I followed the directions exactly and thought the "basic turkey stock" was much too gamey for me. So the bird turned out great but I didn't care for the gravy at all. (It seemed odd that any gravy for a 14 pound turkey would involve 3 cups stock, 1 cup wine AND all the drippings from the turkey?)

I can echo all the other four fork reviews. The aroma was amazing and the turkey moist, savory and delicious. People fought over the leftovers which were every bit as good.

This is an exceptional turkey dish. After many years of turkey roasting, this one takes the cake. Instead of a whole turkey I roasted a large, breast, bone in and two legs. It cut down cooking time and worked perfectly. The pancetta is a fabulous, robust flavor that compliments the turkey well. I was generous with it. It was the best turkey dish I have every cooked. The gravy is decadent and delicious.

This turkey was AWESOME - a nice twist on the traditional holiday preparation! I have a convection oven so my turkey cooked more quickly. Gravy was awesome too! Will definitely make this again and not just during the holidays!

This was delicious! The pancetta made the turkey so moist and flavored the meat wonderfully. We didn't make the pancetta gravy, worried that it would be too salty. It was perfect with simple pan gravy. My guests raved. I'll be making this again next year!

The Pancetta-sage butter is literally the best thing I have ever smelled in my entire life. I will definitely use it on chicken breasts in the future. The recipe, I'm sure would have been wonderful, had the instructions for cooking the turkey worked. How were we supposed to get the scrapings from the pan when it was still sitting in a bunch of chicken stock? Perhaps I didn't do this recipe correctly but my turkey was pink throughout after 3 hours and it was very small. Definitely a good recipe for flavor but follow a tried and true for the roasting. I found the gravy to be too strong, and would recommend not adding the pancetta to it.

I gave this 4 forks not because it was so good that I'll make it more than once a year, but because it was very good for turkey. My family and I all agreed that while we still don't especially like turkey, this is the best turkey that we've had. I brined the turkey, which I think helps a lot. Consequently, I didn't add salt during cooking, and despite the saltiness of the pancetta, it didn't turn out too salty. The gravy was also the best gravy we've ever had, and the turkey stock base was the easiest stock recipe I've ever seen. Based on the flavor and ease preparation, I would say that we'll probably make this again next year.

The pancetta-sage butter is like crack. My brother had made it ahead of time and we opened the container and everyone wanted to slather it all over themselves it smelled that good. The turkey was also delicious. I thought the gravy was a bit salty but other people don't seem to mind. Could depend on the pancetta used. Definitely making again this year.

This was delicious. I think that I overcooked the turkey a bit because the meat was a bit dry, but the flavour was fantastic. Made the italian bread and sausage recipe from this site to go with it. Everyone loved it.

As soon as I saw this in Bon Appetit I knew I was going to make it at some point. I was not disappointed. I was hesitant because I usually brine my birds but this really didn't need it. It did lean towards a bit too salty so be cautious where you add additional.

Outstanding... absolutely outstanding. I used to brine the turkey, but this year I skipped it and the bird was fabulous.

I brined my turkey in a cider mixture for 18 hours prior to roasting the turkey with this recipe. It was SOOOO good! I couldn't find enough pancetta, so I substituted some high quality American bacon for the missing pancetta. It was wonderful. Rave reviews from our many guests. Another goodie from epicurious.com.

Im glad I started with a really good bird, because the recipe didnt have a whole lot of flavor. I would suggest to anyone making this to double the sage, and slightly increase the rosemary. Also, in spite of everything that went into the gravy, I did not find it particularly flavorful or worth the steps beyond making a traditional gravy. Here, too, I would bump up the herbs. In short it was good but lackluster.

This was by far, the best turkey we ever made.....absolutely delicious. The only change we made was to not use the Parmesan called for in the recipe. This is now our annual Thanksgiving turkey recipe.

Great flavor, would definitely make again. Only caution is that the gravy has the potential to be a bit too salty as it cooks down if you're not careful. The drippings from the pancetta-sage butter and the additional pancetta you put in the gravy make your base pretty salty, keeping the broth light on the salt would help. Great combination of flavors, though. Served with the sage white cheddar mashed potatoes also on this site.

This was my first turkey and it was delicious! I wanted a no-brine recipe since I used a kosher bird. Overall the technique is foolproof, though I started the bird at 425 for an hour, then flipped breast side up and finished at 325. Also I strained the gravy. I do wonder how much the pancetta and reggiano contributed, though. I might do this again with the same technique, only a simple herb-garlic butter and porcini gravy.

I prepared this turkey for a large group over the weekend. It turned out wonderful - Some said it was the best turkey they ever tasted. The gravy was fabulous!! The only difficult part was getting all of the pancetta-sage butter between the meat and the skin without puncturing through the skin. I will make this again.
