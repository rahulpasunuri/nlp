I've made this several times now and it's come out great every time. Works great on the broiler too, and patties stay together without the skewers if you don't have them. The only change I'd suggest is using less onions - I like onions but there was a little too much in this recipe for me.

Definitely will make this again. Used 1/2 and 1/2 mix of smoked paprika and sweet. Only used 1 lb of lamb and kind of "shorted" the other ingredients. Pan fried half instead of grilled (small amount of olive oil) but can tell that grilling would be great. Used the other half to make a pasta sauce (also great!). Used store bought tzatziki mixed with harissa (had some at home) instead of the accompanying paste. Served some in pitas and others with pilaf. Everything great!

Really enjoy this recipe, have made it several times, with just one change - rather than grilling on skewers, I make Lamb burgers and serve with pita bread, tabouli, sauteed spinach, greek salad, pita chips and hummus. A great meal!

Have tried a few lamb kebab recipes and this is a winner. One thing that definitely helps with any dryness of the lamb is to cut it with a 1/2-1 lb. ground pork. It may not be authentic, but the pork is flavorful and adds succulence. I doubled the garlic, added 1/2 finely diced jalapeno, skipped the pepper sauce. Served with tzatziki sauce and grilled naan. Not too spicy. Had no problems with the skewers. Quite tasty.

I am not giving a rating since I changed this a lot: I didn't use any onion and used dried instead of fresh herbs would be better with fresh of course) and reduced the cayenne. For lack of time, I made it into a shallow meat loaf and baked in aluminum foil drizzled with olive oil, at 375. So mouthwatering and delicious!!!! Can't wait to try the recipe properly now that I know I love the flavors.

Really nice and easy. Don't use lean lamb. Everything held together without falling apart on the grill though my skewers caught on fire despite the soaking. I skipped cilantro and reduced the cayenne. Wonderful with a yogurt sauce - I didn't try the fresh hot-pepper paste out of laziness but may try next time.

Very nice recipe. 3 forks only due to a dryness factor. My lamb was quite lean. I will definitely make again perhaps adding a bit of moisture with milk or egg. Would be a great party food offering table-side assembly. I offered tzatziki which was wonderful with it as well.

Loved it! But, the rest of the family thought the lamb was too spicy. Too bad. I will make this again when some friends with more interesting palates come to visit.

This is delicious!! I added a little vinegar to the hot pepper paste. I also made a tahini sauce to serve with it (tahini, water, garlic, olive oil) as well as a cucumber/tomato/kalamata/bell pepper/parsely salad. Great dinner! Will definitely make again.

Why is it that recipes that call for ground meat always require 1.25-1.5 lbs of meat? It's sold by the pound at my market, so I used 2 for this recipe and increased the other ingredients accordingly. I also used extra cayenne instead of black pepper since I'm not a fan of the black stuff. Like other reviewers, I formed the mixture into small patties. Being grill-less, I cooked them up in a little olive oil in a pan on the stovetop. They turned out beautifully. Oh, and I accidentally used up all my parsley and cilantro in the patties so instead of making the hot pepper paste, I added the cumin and some dried chili peppers to the mixture before cooking it up. This was a great way to use ground lamb. I'll be making it again.

Wow! These are spicy and have a wonderful flavor. I made them on the stovetop as I live in an apartment and don't have a grill, but they came out wonderful nonetheless. Will definitely make them again.

Made this recipe into 10 sausage shaped rolls. Delicious. Made recipe as is without the sauce. Served with pita, rice and roasted tomatoes. Will make again soon!

My friend always changes recipes and for this one she added a tablespoon of Indian pickles in garlic oil, chopped, and 2 tsp. cumin to the lamb mixture. She made large meatballs which she fried. She served the lamb kebabs in a small pita with a piece of fresh mint, an oven dried tomato half, and a dollop of tzatziki. The Indian pickles (Pataks) added the heat.

I served this to 10 guests who have varying food tastes and ALL loved it. The accompanying hot pepper paste was also a hit. Like others, I dispensed with the skewers and made 2 oz. lamb patties (small enough to fit two in a pita half). I also made a yogurt-cucumber sauce and the Couscous Tabouleh from this site, which were excellent accompaniments. This is a great recipe for entertaining, as - contrary to the recipe - you can make the mixture and shape the patties the day before.

The flavours were good, but I found it a bit dry - Im not sure why - everyone else seemed to love it so maybe I did something wrong

I loved the "skewers although I didn't actually skewer them. I just put them right on the grill. I also found the sauce to be very thin. I mixed in a couple tbls of Greek yogurt to thicken it up this was a delicious addition to the sauce.addition to the sauce.

These are SO good! My husband has already asked to have them again and it's only been a few days. I just cooked them as patties, too and served them with a salad with feta cheese and curried couscous (I couldn't be bothered with the hot-pepper paste). Much more filling than I realized they would be, but very happy to have leftovers. Will absolutely make these again!

We skipped the kabobs and grilled patties on the big green egg. Yum! It's a keeper.

Yum! Yum! Yum! Excellent, and surprisingly easy. If you do make the paste (and you should) don't make the mistake of the "cook" from Portland. Bottled roasted red peppers are not a substitute for serranos or jalepenos. You might as well substitute ground tofu for the lamb... Sheesh! Some people!

I also made these without the hot pepper sauce, formed them into patties and grilled them. They were absolutely FABULOUS served with field green and feta pita (a recipe I made up in desperation to use the abundance of greens I've had) and the hot and sour eggplant from this site.

Very tasty. Made it as a burger since I didn't have skewers.

Love this recipe and make it often for company. I serve with hummus, kalamata olives and either spanikopita or a spinach recipe also from this site, who's name I can not remember.

This is the first lamb my husband has ever enjoyed-- of course the flavor of the lamb is really not as pronounced when there are tons of pungent herbs and spices mixed with it. I am Lebanese, and it has always been difficult to have to avoid a meat that was always so common in my family's household. I also ditched the kebabs, since we aren't allowed to have a grill at our condominium. I just made small, football-shaped patties and cooked them in a grill pan. Sensational!

Delicious - we made a cucumber, mint, yogurt sauce to accompany. Why not ditch the sticks and just cook the kebab shapes in a fish/vegetable grill basket - our skewers kept escaping

My husband is a Kebab-Person & makes amazing kebabs already & loved this recipe. I on the other hand, don't even like lamb & I loved this recipe. I did not make the hot pepper paste because it didn't sound too exciting. This is definitely going onto our recipe box.

Very good. I didn't make the hot-pepper paste, and I cut down on the cayenne pepper in the kebabs. They were still kind of zippy even with the reduced cayenne (they would be pretty spicy with the whole 1/2 tsp. of cayenne). Next time I'll serve with tsatsiki dip to offset the heat of the kebabs.

Excellent! Serve w/ sauce from FRIED FISH WITH MOROCCAN-STYLE HERB SAUCE and GRILLED ZUCCHINI WITH BLACK OLIVES AND MINT. An incredible meal!!

This is great! I cooked it in the broiler, since there is 2 feet of snow on the ground and I didn't want to shovel a path to the outside grill. Terrific flavor, and good as leftovers. Tastes like in the restaurant. Didn't make the hot-pepper paste, but serve it with a cucumber with mint and yogurt salad and rice.

WOW, these were dynamite! I'll will be making them for company this weekend. When I've made these, I do the whole greek thing with hummus, pita chips, tzaziki(?) sauce, baklava, kalamata olives and I'm told that I've outdone myself. There is also a recipe for spinach latkkes on this website that is excellent with the above. Try it, you will like it. The kebabs are spicy!

This is the best! It has been a regular in our household since discovering it. I use the small jars of red jalepenos in place of fresh in the paste. This is a little less hot and adds a vinegar flavor. The paste is good enough to be used on any meat for any occasion. It is a general condiment in our house now.

Didn't use the hot-pepper sauce. Instead served with a cucumber yogurt sauce with dill. Made for a nice simple dinner.

Served as part of a Middle Eastern Buffet. Fantastic! Used oven instead of grill with fine results. Also doubled parsley/eliminated cilantro and there was still plenty of flavor. The kids at the party liked it too.

As the ingredients would suggest, this is quite spicy, but very good. I would agree with others that this is too spicy for children and those who are not spicy food freaks (which our household is).

I've made this recipe twice and both times found the meat mixture loose and thus difficult to form as the recipe instructs. Maybe I'm kabob-impaired. Nevertheless, the second time around I made "burgers" instead and had an easier time on the grill. This dish was outstanding and very delicious. If you like it you might also try the "Spicy Indian Orzo" which we also love. Guests and husband raved.

i have made this several times for company to rave reviews. the paste makes a good coating for chicken/pork chops prior to grilling, too. it is wonderful!

This is one of our favorite recipes. I made this for my husband on one of our first dates. It was fun to make togather but is very spicy. Would not recommend this for children. We always grill tomatos, onions or any other veggie suitable for grilling. Everything on the grill is the moto for the summer. NO POTS AND PANS!

We both loved this - and the hot paste. This is quite spicey - I wouldn't dream of serving it to children - but we loved it, grilling it outdoors even at -10F! Recommend it for those who love a little fire in their food. (think next time will offer sliced lettuce, tomatoes and a little yoghurt sauce with lemon/onion as optional toppings)

Excellent recipe. It was well-received by my entire family, although I ws the only one who enjoyed the hot pepper paste.
