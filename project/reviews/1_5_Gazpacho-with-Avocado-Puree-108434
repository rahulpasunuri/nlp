I really didn't find this recipe as grotesque as the previous reviewers did. It was a little heavy on the garlic. Someone commented on the soup being to runny. I used home canned tomatoes, sqeezed the excess liquid out of them, and then put them in a food mill and the texture was thick but not to thick after I added the chicken broth. Though the garlic was a bit much the avacado puree balanced the flavor and really improved the entire dish. I will definately make this agian.

I wouldn't even call this gazpacho. I was disappointed I wasted my home- grown tomatoes.

As awful as the previous reviewers stated - possibly the worst recipe on the entire website. Now we know they don't proofread their recipes or make sure that the photos correspond to the dish. Do they also not test the recipes either???

BLECH!!! PHOOEY!!! YUCK!!! It's been a few weeks since I made this disaster and then, there were no reviews posted. I was wondering if anyone would concur with my intense dislike for this recipe. Well, thanks to Lakeville, MI, I know I didn't either do something completely off base when making the soup or had a bad-taste-bud-day when I was consuming it. I agree with EVERYTHING Lakeville said. I'd also add that this was a complete waste of my lovingly grown, fresh tomatos. Oh, and three bucks worth of avocados!

This recipe looked delicious but ended up tasting like chopped onions and garlic in tomato juice. The avocado puree was a great idea, but required a thicker base to make it work. It simply dropped to the bottom. I'm sure there is a better recipe for this!!
