I love, love, love this salad. It's so delicious. My only problem is that no matter how diligent I am, my phylllo always burns when I try to make the cups as written. Over time, I've started skipping it entirely (or cooking some in sheets and breaking them up like croutons). Instead, I simply rub my muffin tin with butter and put the souffle filling directly in it. It works really well. Also, the dressing seems bland on first taste but with the delicate flavor of the souffles it's actually quite complimentary.

The goat cheese souffle was fabulous! I only used 4 oz of goat cheese instead of the 5 oz. Wouldn';t change a thing. This will be a staple item in my recipe box.

The souffles are fantastic... don't let the phyllo intimidate you, the first cup you make will be ugly but the rest will be much easier.... big hit will defiantly make again

This recipe worked out very well. I had followed the suggestions of many reviewers that the goat cheese souffle was too bland without the addition of other flavors. I used garlic and fresh tarragon. It was amazing. The phyllo cups were easy, and I created a spiced butter to brush each of the layer with for some additional flavor. I found using a silicone muffin pan to be easiest because I could get them out of the mold faster. They also weren't too bad the next day. I will definitely play around with other flavors for this recipe.

I could only find a 24 x mini-muffin tray so I cut the phyllo smaller to 5-6 cm (2"+) squares. Butter is preferred, but if you're in a real hurry or want to reduce calories somewhat you can use an oil spray between the sheets. The middle eastern market was too far away, so the only goat cheese I could find locally was a Chavrie brand from Pennsylvania. It has a milder flavor but works quite well. No salt was added or needed. I only beat the egg whites part way as time was short, and the mixer was nowhere to be found as I was still unpacking boxes following a move. I figured the worst that could happen was mini-quiches! Left the browned phyllo cups in the metal tins and filled them to the top. Even though there were 24 cups there was enough extra filling for maybe 6 more. They didn't rise as much as a standard soufflé, but were attractive and very tasty. I will definitely make these again, and will probably try a pinch of tarragon as another reviewer suggested. The bite-size dimension created by the small tins actually makes it ideal for appetizers. I'm wondering if I should try to bake the filled cups on a cookie sheet, removed from the muffin tins next time? Comments appreciated... paix et bon appetit. gitango

Very nice recipe. Don't let the phyllo cups scare you...they are not difficult to make at all. Just take your time and work gently with the phyllo sheets. It's okay if they tear a bit, once you bake them, they somewhat get reattached. As for the souffle itself...quite tasty! A tiny bit on the bland side...I would add a dash or two of salt next time, perhaps a little garlic, and consider some tarragon or thyme. All in all, a truly great dish.

Fantastic recipe! Works equally well with gorgonzola or a mild cheese like danbo for the kids. Just use the same measure of cheese by weight.

We loved this. The souffle was delicious and very delicate. I fumbled a bit with the phyllo cups; after about 6 minutes, I checked them in the oven and one had collapsed, so I pulled them out a little early. Nevertheless, the presentation was still beautiful and the taste was great. Also, the salad dressing was really good; I'm going to hold onto it for future use on its own.

Wow. What a fantastic dish! I too, cut down on some of the work time (and mess) by taking the other reviewers suggestion of using pre-made phyllo shells. My only other change was to use a baby lettuce blend of salad instead of the frisee. I also mixed in about a teaspoon extra (per serving) of parmesan into the salad. A luscious mix of flavours & textures. I want to plan a dinner party just to be able to serve this!

I baked the phyllo cups the day before and left them in the muffin pan. I removed them from the muffin pan and placed on cookie sheet to cook souffles. My husband loved them, but I felt goat cheese flavor was not strong enough. Maybe my cheese was too mild. Will make again but sub a raspberry poppyseed dressing most likely.

A mistake I made in this recipe was cooking the souffles with the phyllo cups still in the muffin tins. I just hadn't thought about doing it any other way. But I realized that the souffles were too hot to remove from the muffin tins right away... and by the time they had slightly cooled, the souffle had fallen. They still tasted great and were very impressive looking for my guests, although I found it a little too stressful to have to make this with such precise timing while trying to entertain. I serve this with a mesclun salad and a balsamic dressing- I don't think the salad is what makes this recipe great, it is the combination of the different textures and temperatures.

This is the second time I made this salad. It is very impressive and delicious. I used roasted garlic grapeseed oil in the dressing and it was wonderful. I must have smaller muffin tins because I can make more that 8 souffles.

This has become a standard for dinner parties. You will not be disappointed - I follow directions exactly as written as well as follow "make ahead" instructions. I use Vilux brand Apple Cidar Vinegar (from France) and I believe it makes a difference.

Wow! My first time with both phyllo and souffles, and they turned out wonderfully. I was tempted to leave out the salad, but am so glad we didn't; it perfectly offset the richness of the souffles. We used butter lettuce, since we all find frisee rather silly and foufy--it went perfectly with the dressing. Highly recommended for a special dinner.

A keeper. Meets two criteria: easy to make and looks impressive. I used watercress for the greens since that's all I had, and it was great.

This was an amazing tasting recipe and incredibly impressive looking. I halved the recipe to make just 6 cups but I didn't halve the amount of goat cheese. They turned out perfect!

So yummy! I bought mini phyllo cups and served as an appetizer. They turned out great and really weren't difficult at all. Also added chives from my garden. Everyone loved them.

Time consuming but a definite winner. Everyone loved the salad and the goat cheese combo. I will continue to make this when I need to impress guests.

Absolutely wonderful. Halved the recipe, but it still made about 8 souffles (i didn't fill the cups a great deal). They did deflate quickly, but they were fantasic. Make sure your ingredients are fresh, they really come through in this dish. I used a Port Salut for the mild goat cheese, and the flavors blended beautifully. Trully a wonderful first course.

This was great! So much better and more interesting than the standard disk of baked goat cheese on top of a salad. My guests raved. I had an old package of phyllo in the freezer that hadn't been re-wrapped properly, so it cracked a lot while preparing the cups, but I just worked around that. Baked the cups and base in the morning, then whipped the egg whites just before baking. I also had to lay a sheet of foil over the cups partway through baking. One thing--be sure your guests are ready and waiting as these cool off and deflate quickly (but still delicious!)

I cooked this as a starter for our Easter Day Lunch, and it was a real hit. I did all the prep the eveining before, and just had to beat the egg whites on the day, so it is Perfect for entertaining. As I do not have a muffin tin, I buttered ramikin dishes really well and used them instead, and everything turned out just fine. I am not a huge fan of cooked cheese, but even I was really impressed. Easy to do, beautiful to look at and wonderful to eat - what more could you ask for?!

From reading the other reviews, I decided to add more goat cheese. I used 8 oz instead of the 5 oz in the recipe. I made the souffles about an hour prior to eating and reheated then right before sitting down for the salad course. Delicious. Because the recipe had more souffle than the 8 nests required I put the rest of the souffle in cupcake tinfoils. They were delicious even when they were room temperature. I think this dish would be best when all guests were seated at the table prior to removing the souffles from the oven. I will make this recipe again.

Quite good, but not amazing. The phyllo added nice texture to the souffles, and the flavor was quite good, although not as cheesy as I had expected. I found that they didn't heat up particularly well. I had them for lunch the next day and used a toaster oven to reheat. Although the phyllo crisped up that way, the fallen souffle was quite unattractive, and quite a bit heavier than as first made. The salad dressing was perfect with the souffles.

I served this over mache instead of frisee, and it was lovely. I made it ahead of time and reheated, and I don't think it suffered at all. An impressive (and relatively easy) first course.

This was my first attempt with phyllo and it was not as intimidating as I thought. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great. I did make the cups ahead of time and reheated them. The souffles fell a little bit (not that it mattered, they tasted great!) so next weekend when I make them again for my gourmet club dinner I will cook the souffle part only once. What a wonderful presentation with this salad. I used a spring mix and I enjoyed it better than the frisee. You do need to be careful making the cups ahead of time, as mentioned from others, when you cook the souffles they will brown quite alot. I could not put foil over the muffin pan because I had filled the cups too much and the souffles had puffed up so nicely that the foil would have crushed them. But the cups are great even when they are a little toasted around the edges. I will save this salad course to impress!!

I have made this salad 3 times and each time it was spectacular. I made the goat cheese mixture (minus egg white) the day before. Caution: Don't use powdered egg whites.

I made this for a dinner party for 8 people, and it was a total hit! I didn't get as much goat cheese flavor as I would have liked, but the overall taste was wonderful, light and great for an appetizer. My phyllo cups browned a little too much the second time around, so I would definitely suggest covering with foil for part of the time. Used sherry vinegar instead of cider and added some shallots as well. Really tasty!

This is just superb. The phyllo is easy to work with using the directions. Just be sure to thaw it in the refrigerator before using. The souffle' is light and flavorful. just lovely with the salad. i used mixed field greens. The recipe allows lots of flexibility. It is just such a lovely presentation in the phyllo cups amongst the greens.

Recipe was not as complicated as I thought it would be. I initially had some trouble handling the phyllo dough (it was my first time using it). This would be a great recipe to impress a dinner party, but it seems to be a lot of work for just a regular weeknight dinner

Rating: 4
Not only does this look and taste great but it's surprisingly easy given the long list of directions. Like many other reviewers I was intimidated by the phyllo dough. But it turned out to be easy to use and very forgiving if it tore slightly given that you are jamming it into muffin cups. This reheated fabulously but needs to be covered with foil or the phyllo will get too brown.

Was fairly easy and the goat cheese souffles were a great hit. Was using my souffle dishes to make the Bittersweet Molton Chocolate cakes for dessert (an incredible recipe on this site)so I used this recipe with the phyllo cups to make the souffles. Have made goat cheese souffles as an appetizer before, but the phyllo cups added something. Not only did I free up my souffle dishes but the crunch and tasted added to the taste of the souffle. Had a couple of extra souffles that were eaten by guests.

This was the first time I made a souffle. I prepared the phyllo cups the night before and made the souffles while my guests were here. I was delighted with the outcome. More importantly, so were my guests. These mini-souffles were delicate and yummy. I served them with my regular salad and bacon. What a wonder Easter Sunday Brunch!

I made this salad for a dinner party. It was a big hit! I made the phyllo cups earlier that day, and also prepared the cheese souffles in advance. This way I only had to fold in the egg whites and baked the souffles while our guests were eating their soup. It worked out great. I will definately make this again.

I made this for Easter Sunday dinner. It was a huge hit. I did make them a few hours (I made the souffle mix sans egg white in the morning and then did the initial cook about 3 hours prior to serving them and reheated them just before serving. They were just fine this way; but the filo got a little browner than I would have liked. I think they are probably best when you make them to coincide with serving them. Salad dressing was really yummy, but I added a tad more vinegar.

Rating: 4
This is every bit as good as it looks in the photograph. I added half a spoonful of cranberry chutney to the cups before I poured the batter in. It was a very good combination, but the souffles are delicious without that addition, too. I think I will try this in larger muffin tins for an entree sized souffle. This would make a great vegetarian meal with the elegant salad.

This recipe is great! I made it for Easter dinner for my husband and me. Since it was just the 2 of us, I baked the Phyllo cups in small ceramic ramekins and cut the recipe in half. These made the souffles probably bigger than the recipe specifies but that was OK! The souffle is fabulous and they came out of the ramekins quite easily. We enjoyed the whole dish with the salad and souffle together. The presentation is very elegant. I will definitely make the souffles again to serve with the salad or by themselves. This is a definite keeper recipe.

I think I suffered from phyllo and souffle fear. Even though I love trying new things, I was very worried about the outcome of this recipe. Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised. Everyone loved these souffles, including my very picky children! I can't wait to make it again! The dressing for the frisee tasted exactly like the dressings that I had on every salad that I ate in Paris last month. Delicious! What an amazingly beautiful presentation, too. It looks like you slaved over it!

I guess I misread this recipe. I guess one only bakes 8 phyllo cups, so that explains 8 salads. It sems like a very time consuming recipe.

A delicious appetizer, and very impressive for a dinner party. I was wary of the mustard in the salad dressing, but found it to be quite tasty. As we couldn't find frisee sold by itself, we substituted a Parisian bagged lettuce mix which included frisee. A fine substitution. I even enjoyed eating the few leftovers a day or two later!

I am an old hand at substituting soy milk for cows milk. It works really well especially in custard based dishes like the souffle. I use SoyDream.

This is a very nice recipe and I made it last night. It's much better to serve right away, I agree. And Boston, can your gf have goat's milk? I would probably do half goat's milk and half soy milk. And the goat parm is what I used. Very good!

Does anyone know if I can substitute soy milk for regular milk and a goat based parm/reg cheese for the cow parm/reg? My gf can't eat dairy (however goat cheeses are okay.) I would like to make this and am thinking about substituting soy milk and goat parm/reg in the recipe. Anyone? Thanks!

Wonderful salad, very impressive and not too much work. I made the phyllo cups the day before. The only thing I would offer is not to make the souffles ahead of time and reheat. I made the souffle mixture and baked them right before I served them and they were very nicely puffed. I reheated two a few hours later for a late guest, and they were very dense. Still good, but not as nice as the earlier ones.
