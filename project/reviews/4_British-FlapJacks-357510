These are so addictive. Followed the recipe (except for using dark brown sugar instead of golden) and had no problems with sticking. I did use a rectangular Pyrex dish, and only baked for 15 minutes. The Lyle's Golden Syrup is an absolute must. Made them last night and I've already eaten half of them myself. I'll probably have to make them again by tomorrow.

My whole family loved this recipe. It was really easy, and I appreciated the other reviews - decreased the time to 15 mins, and lined the pan with greased foil. All worked out perfectly. I am now going to try to make it a bit healthier - it's definitely a desert as it stands. But has the making of a really yummy granola bar of sorts. Maybe add some fruit, less sugar and butter, who knows what else...

Excellent recipe ! The only drawback is the meaurement unit in cups which is a pain for an European ... But indeed, as mentioned numerous times, this is incredibly easy, fast to cook and delicious. Next time, I might try it with a bit less sugar, but surely the kids will not approve :-)

After the third try, I think the key, as some others have said, is to bake them for only 15 minutes. Resist the urge to leave them in long enough to be browned past the very edge! Doing this, they finally didn't crumble away after cutting and were softer and easier to eat. I dipped one edge of each triangle in some melted bittersweet chocolate- worked really well, and could even be a gift treat that way.

Didn't turn out so well...twice...quick-cooking oats are the same as rolled oats, right?

It tastes brilliant- but DO NOT line your baking tray with parchment paper (as a review states) cos it just ends up sticking to the flapjacks. Had to do a second round cos of it. Anywho, if your oven has a fan, reduce the baking time by 5 minutes. If you like it a little chewier- knock off another 2-3 minutes. All in all, makes a perfect tea-time snack! :)

A former co-worker who is British said these are the best flapjacks she ever had! They're so easy to make. I featured this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins

So easy and delicious. Cheaper and tastier than store bought granola bars. I made this exactly as written, and wouldn't change a thing. TIP: Gently cut these 5 minutes after removing from oven (as directed), and let completely cool before removing from pan. The trick to getting these out of the pan without breaking apart is to heat the pan on a burner on the stove, loosening the crisp, buttered edges from the pan. Use a fork to pull them out of the pan - they come out perfect and won't be a crumbly mess.

I think this is a terrific recipe, although if you add a small handful of chocolate chips and a handful of chopped, dried cherries this recipe becomes marvelous!!!!

I've made this before as written and thought it was pretty good, but my boyfriend (who has spent his entire life in Scotland) insists that I share the modifications I did to make a batch for him yesterday, as they were good enough to make his eyes roll back in his head and have him insist that his Gran would've approved: I used pure maple instead of golden syrup and added cinnamon and raisins. I didn't measure either, but used as many raisins as I thought would fit without preventing the mix from sticking together, and probably a teaspoon or so of cinnamon.

I followed the directions as written (except I substituted honey and corn syrup for the golden syrup) and found the cooking time to be way too long. The flapjacks were really hard and broke into crispy crumbs when I tried to remove them from the pan. Though the crumbs were delicious, I was expecting a chewy, rice krispie treat textured dessert. Has anyone else had this problem? I am going to try making them again but baking only for 10 minute or so instead of 25.

I have been trying to find a good flapjack recipe for a while (I am British living in the US and I miss them!) This one is probably the best that I have tried. I always find flapjacks a bit too sweet, so I cut the sugar by 1/4 cup, so just used 1/4 of sugar and 1/4 of golden syrup. I also cut the stick of butter down to 3/4 and used Earth Balance instead to make them vegan. The consistency was great, and the sweetness level was just right for my taste. They were chewy and stayed together well. Really good basic recipe, I think. Probably very good as written, but nice to know you can cut the fat and sugar a bit with no ill effects.

These are VERY easy to make and delicious! I made it exactly to the recipe and love the rich complex taste. I took a previous comment to heart about the trouble getting them out of the pan so I lined my pan with foil with an overhang and then buttered the foil. They came right out. If you cut them after they've cooled just 5 minutes they are easy to cut. I've made them twice this week and need to go buy oats when I want them again!

These were delicious. My batch came out very moist. I used 1/8c honey and 1/8c maple syrup instead of golden syrup. I also added mixed spice and ginger. After I finished baking them for only twenty minutes(so not to over cook the edges), I sprinkled dark chocolate chips over them.

Rating: 0
While very good as is, this is even better made with amber maple syrup and maple sugar. If made with golden syrup and brown sugar, a pinch of cinnamon is a delicious addition. Also, for ease of cutting and eating, consider squares instead of triangles.

I made these tonight and just had a taste while still slightly warm. Yum. I added 2/3 cup of toasted almond slices and baked in a 8x8 glass dish lined with parchment. No sticking. We'll see how they taste as they firm up. Hoping my 4-year old loves them. Easy easy.

Followed recipe exactly and realized the end product is very good once completely cooled, not sooner. Don't skip adding the salt. A cross between a crunchy granola bar and a cookie but with a buttery taste.

Line the metal pan with non-stick aluminum foil - it's perfect! Parchment doesn't work as well..made exactly as directed, but cut to 20 minutes baking - these were so easy and good, I laughed!

This is a great, great recipe. I used a glass square pan, with non- stick spray. Baked them at 350 for 17 minutes, let them cool for 20 and I think they came out perfect. At first they seemed too soft, but became firmer (but still chewy) as they cooled. I agree with the other reviews, the flavors are more complex and developed than you would expect from such humble ingredients. I will be making these at least once a week!

What a delight to see this recipe in Bon Appetit!!I grew up eating flapjacks made by my Scottish Mum. The only difference that I can see is that in our family recipe we only use brown sugar no golden syrup.I loved them as a child--crunchy heaven!! I have made them for my own family and they have always been a big hit. Hmmmm! I think I will have to make them again! Thanks Bon Appetit!

Love these. Made them last night and couldn't resist trying one slightly warm. It tasted great, but definitely crumbled and was hard to get out of the pan. This morning I grabbed one on my way out the door and it was perfect. Held together great, nice and chewy, great buttery toffy flavor. I bought quick oats just to try this recipe. Curious to see if regular old fashioned will work as that is what I usually have on hand. Will try next time and compare.

It's me again. I made several adjustments and liked the results...used a whole cube of regular butter and left out the salt. Added a teaspoon of ground cinnamon. Replaced the golden syrup with blue agave syrup. Added one cup of chopped nuts. I baked it for 20 minutes exactly. The result was a less dense product. By adding the nuts it reduced the amount of "glue" that held it together. I like it better; not so brittle.

I prepared this treat after reading every review and taking into consideration a mutitude of opinions. I did as follows...I cut out one tablespoon of unsalted butter, and I lined the pan with parchment paper. I set the timer for 15 minutes and checked every two minutes until they appeared golden. I allowed them to cool for five minutes and had no problem cutting them into triangles. As they cooled they darned near went through rigor mortis; what appeared to be a soft chewy product cooled to a crunchy, crisp biscuit. That said, it was well liked by my family and friends. The next go 'round I'm going to experiment. Perhaps some brown rice syrup for the golden syrup, or maybe even real maple syrup. I might also try cinnamon and/or nuts. Why not coconut? If I find any exciting addition, I'll make sure to post it.

I was hesitant to make these as my very dear friend who is British detested them when he was a child because he said they were always hard as a rock and tasted burnt. I was determined to avoid both of these problems but also to make it my own. I used regular butter instead of unsalted and skipped adding the pinch of salt. I also used 2 Tbls of maple syrup along with the golden syrup to give it a little depth. Lastly I baked these for only 20 minutes, until the edges were just golden brown. They turned out just grand. Very chewy with a great texture. I'll definitely make these again!

Rather mixed review. These were definitely delicious and were a hit with parents and kids alike as a post-game snack. However, the amount of butter made these way too rich and greasy to even hold. Hoping to adjust quantities so that I can get the same chew and crunch without the oily drawbacks...

I also used blue agave syrup, found at Trader Joe's. I also used part steel cut oats as I was short of quick oats. It really turned out well, very crunchy. I will definitely make these again.

These were great! These would be fabulous for an afternoon coffee treat. I didn't have the golden syrup, so I substituted honey and it worked great. Enjoy!

After much research, I decided to take the risk and substiture Agave syrup (from Costco) for the yet-to-be-found Golden syrup. WOW! It worked perfectly and the resulting bars seemed to match Mollie's description perfectly. I took these to a school field trip and shared with some other mothers who kept asking for more! Hot out of the oven, these are even better! The Agave gave them a great, addictive flavor and they were SO simple.

Very similar to a recipe called "Hudson Bay Bread". Boy Scouts use it as high energy food while canoeing at Northern Tier High Adventure Camp in Canada and the north woods of the United States.

Yummy. Very easy to pull together. I really think the golden syrup is key - if you need to be convinced, just try a little on your finger and compare it to corn syrup. Corn syrup tastes just straight-up sweet, while Lyle's has a caramelised sugar taste. I forgot the salt the first time I made them, and it was definitley needed.

These are incredible. Such flavor and richness with so little effort. They are a great afternoon treat. You may be "able" to substitute corn syrup for Lyle's Golden Syrup but it certainly wouldn't taste as good.

I really enjoyed these. They went together quick and easy. I substituted 1/3 C chopped toasted walnuts for 1/3 C of the Oats, used Light Brown Sugar, and used Honey as I didn't have any Golden Syrup or Corn Syrup on hand. They still turned out great. Slightly crispy around the edge and relatively soft in the middle. Nice and hearty, a great alternative to Rice Krispy Treats.

I hate to disagree with nearly all previous reviews, but I didn't find these as amazing as the article made them out to be. Their flavor was quite good, but their consistency was rock hard the first day and too gooey and sticky the second day. I had trouble cutting them into anything that resembled triangles, as they were still quite soft when they came out of the oven. Also had quite a hard time getting them out of the pan. If I make these again I will line the pan with parchment paper.

The flavors are reminiscent of sinful granola bar, very rich, chewy and sweet. Next time I might add 1/4 c. or so slivered toasted almonds. Will definitely keep this recipe close at hand.

I must be missing something here. I was not impressed with these bars. I certainly wanted to be. I absolutely adore Lyle's Golden Syrup but I tasted more brown sugar than Lyle's in the finished product. I froze the bars and will crumble them up and add them to a sugar cookie dough with some toffee bits so they don't go to waste but they're not something I would make again.

Rating: 4
I made these using dark Karo syrup and old fashioned oats. Delicious, though I'm wondering if using the quick oats might have resulted in a less greasy bar. Had to keep wiping my hands when I ate them. My husband tried them quite a few times. He's so kind, that I only know if he likes something if he takes seconds, thirds...I'm going to buy golden syrup and quick oats to make them again.

I grew up in England and flapjacks were always one of my favorites sweets for 'tea.' Unfortunately, I have never found a recipe for them that lives up to my very fond memories, 'til now. I followed the recipe exactly and found these flapjacks met my very high expectations - the ones in the middle of the pan were chewy and rich in flavor, while the ones around the edge were almost crunchy. I definitely recommend using golden syrup rather than corn syrup as it has more complexity. I also suggest keeping a close eye on them as they cook to ensure that the ones in the edge don't become too brown. YUM! BTW, even my american born husband and kids loved them.

These were great! I followed the recipe exactly, though I cooked them in a toaster oven (convection) and they were done in 20 minutes. I found the golden syrup at CostPlus World Market. The texture was great - chewy and just a bit sticky. Complex, toffee-like flavor and not too sweet. I made homemade almond ice cream to serve with them (I know that's probably not authentic) and my husband and I both thought it made a great dessert. They were also extremely easy to make - I'll definitely make them again.

I followed recipe only substituting "Steel"s cane syrup. They were delicious ! I will try 'golden' syrup next time, and add a few chopped nuts in place of some of the oatmeal. I tried adding mini chocolate chips........... but because the sugar is hot, they melted !

You can easily substitute light corn syrup for golden syrup in most recipes (including this one) -- I tried it, and it was good!

Had to search a bit for the golden syrup, but finally found it in a "specialty store." It's thick like honey, amber colored, and yummy, like toffee or caramel. Made these flapjacks as specified. Found them way too sweet and one dimensional. I don't think they hold a candle to a good, chewy oatmeal cookie, or rice krispy treats for that matter.

These were amazing! After reading the recipe, I absolutely had to try them and they were everything the recipe claimed. I made them exactly as stated. I would suggest lowering the cooking time slghtly, maybe 21 to 22 min.

Easy, delicious and addicting. I followed the recipe but subbed about 1/4 c of chopped toasted pecans for the 1/4c. of the oatmeal. Now I wonder if they can be made with a little less butter and still hold together well. I would love to replace my morning habit of eating a store bought Maple Brown Sugar Granola Bar with one of these but gotta reduce the butter.

As the cook from St. Louis said, these absolutely do live up to the description. I always have golden syrup in my pantry, so these were incredibly easy to whip together. I cut them in smaller triangles (32)as they are addictive...when I took a batch to work, one of my coworkers ate HALF of them.These would be a great treat for camping trips as well.

Love this humble, chewy bar. I made them with Old Fashioned oatmeal which was all I ever have on hand and they were fine. Instead of just stirring the oatmeal in after taking the syrup/butter mixture off the heat I cooked it for a minute. Delicious and chewy. Toasted pecans would be a good addition or possibly butterscotch chips.

Rating: 0
The final product was a darn good cookie. Since I added nuts and dried fruit and didn't increase the butter/sugar/syrup they came out very crumbly and did not hold together well. But they were a hit at our house - very easy and had a nice chewiness. Crumbles would be great over ice cream. Might also consider adding a touch of vanilla or cinnamon or other spice - I know my playing doesn't make them authentic.

I haven't eaten them yet - they are stil cooling in the pan, but like the cook from St. Louis, when I read the article in Bon Appetit I knew I had to try them. Because I can't leave anything well enough alone - I added some toasted pecans and dried cherries and raisins. They look great, but not unexpectedly they didn't cut into perfect triangles. I'll let you know how they taste when they've cooled.

The article corresponding to this recipe (Cooking Life - Flapjacks) in the March 2010 issue captivated me. The author, describing her first experience with flapjacks has this to say, "...about two chews in, the flavor came: deep and hearty, the way good oatmeal can be . . . You take a bite, and it tastes good, if a little wholesome. But you keep chewing, and in a second or two, the flavor opens up threefold, big and toasty and rich, and your salivary glands start going, and you think, This is delicious. I don't know what this thing is, but I'm going to need another." I had to know. Could this unassuming recipe really be THAT good? Really? First, I checked the reviews - none yet. Then, after going back and forth about whether I really and truly needed to know, I sent my husband out for golden syrup (which he found at Jay's on Grand with the jams, jellies and preserves). The review: it absolutely lives up to the hype. It was as easy as making rice crispie treats, but the taste is so deliciously complex. The golden syrup is reminiscent of butterscotch toffee, and it's taste is pronounced in the flapjacks. This is comfort food to the core.
