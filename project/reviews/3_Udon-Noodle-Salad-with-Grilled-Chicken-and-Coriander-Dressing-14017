This was a great recipe, but my experience with Japanese-style dishes is that their simplicity can leave you wanting more. A few additions really helped to make this an excellent dish. First, I added lemongrass to the chicken marinade to give it some zest and an appropriate Asian flavor. Second, I added some shitake mushrooms and asparagus to the vegetable mix. Finally, I used the chicken marinade and added it to the sauce, being dill agent to cook it thoroughly to remove any bacteria. I will definitely make this again!

I might skip the vinegar and go for mirin, or maybe shaohsing next time. I tried this recently, using the vinegar, and agreed that it was a little bit on the sour side.

This is a light, delicious recipe. My husband really loved it. The sauce was tangy from the vinegar, but we really liked it--it's a matter of taste. If you're concerned about it, increase the broth and decrease the vinegar in the sauce.

A nice light, delicate-flavored dish. I actually served this dish hot (didn't rinse the noodles and the chicken was hot off the grill). I used extra broth in the dressing and didn't find it at all vinegary. Also, I was out of parsley, so I used cilantro only and threw in half a fresh jalapeno I had kicking around. Everyone liked it. Not spectacular, but certainly solid.

I was really looking forward to this meal, and unfortunately I was disappointed by the outcome. I found it to have a very strong vinegar taste.

This wasn't bad. I used steak instead of chicken, and added chile paste both to the marinating meat and to the dressing, as well as a dash of soy sauce and a few fresh basil leaves to the dressing. I also added some pre-fried tofu puffs, cut into strips, to the final product. My main complaint is that the dressing to noodle ratio is off--I needed to use about half as many noodles as called for in order to 1) have enough dressing to coat them, and 2) not have enough to serve 10 people. A pleasant, not stellar, but easy-enough dish.

Excellent, healthy and so easy to make! Since it was a cool evening, I served it hot by making stir-fried yaki-soba noodles (usually in the refrigerator section where asian & vegetarian products are sold), mixed in the bean sprouts, and topped it with the chicken; then sprinked green onions & drizzled the dressing over the top. I also substituted sesame oil for the vegetable oil. This dish has tons of flavor & is low-fat. I couldn't ask for anything more!

Excellent. Light, great flavor, quick to prepare. I'm thinking about making it with shrimp next time. It's sure to become a regular component of our summer menu.

This is a wonderful summer dish! I've taken to making it at least once a week, sometimes substituting grilled tuna or beef sirloin for the chicken. I recommend using sesame oil in place of the vegetable oil to give a more "oriental" flavor. i also include grated carrots (with the onions and bean sprouts) as "add-ins" to give the dish more color and texture.

This is a wonderful, light and easy dish. I opted, however, to use linguine noodles tossed with toasted sesame oil in place of the udon noodles. I also used julienned cucumber in place of the bean sprouts and I also topped it with chopped dry-roasted peanuts. I have served it often to rave reviews.

This was really good. A lot of flavor but not an over kill. I used fresh soba noodles to cut down on the prep time. My family gave it a thumbs up.
