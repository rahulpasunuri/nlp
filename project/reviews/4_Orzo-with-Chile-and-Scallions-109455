Great base for a could-be stellar recipe. I found it needed something, but after extra everything, it still left me wanting something more flavorful. Also, needed a LOT of salt (coming from someone who uses scant). Next time I may try a splash of chicken stock in lieu of pasta water.

Super easy and even yummier with 2 T sliced shallots. When they brown and crisp up, you get more sweetness and another layer of flavor. Goes with everything.

Have made this so many times and always a hit! Great with a strong flavor like salmon!

Next time I'll add 1T. of serrano chiles, as suggested, but it was worthy of 4 forks as-is! Served it with grilled flat-iron steak. Fantastic.

This was a very yummy and simple side dish. Would be great with any grilled meat! We used 1 T. of serrano pepper and it was perfect. You could use a little more cheese if you wanted, but the recommended amount is just enough not to overwhelm. Will definitely make again!

A simple and fresh recipe! The serrano peppers and scallions work well together (heat and spicy sweetness). The parmigiano-reggiano is a great cheese for serrano as it is mild enough to not destroy the heat with tartness. Recommended as a side dish for a warm summer meal.
