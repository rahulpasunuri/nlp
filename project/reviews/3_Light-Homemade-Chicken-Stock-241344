This is a good recipe, but using a package of necks (some stores carry them in 2-3 lb. pkgs.), leaving the skin on the vegetables-- including the onion-- will give the broth a deeper flavor. Omit the bay leaf if you want a spice- free broth to use in any recipe. Don't add salt either or your recipe will be too salty. If you want a supply of stock, use 2 lbs. of necks, a large onion, small bunch of celery and 2 large carrots, all washed, ends removed but unpeeled. Add 4 quarts of water, bring to a boil and simmer covered for 2 hours. Cool and cover, refrigerating overnight. The next day, skim off fat and remove veggies and neck bones, then put thru a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth. You'll have about 3 and a half quarts of thick, fragrant wonderful stock for every recipe! Stores for a week in the frig, or a year in the freezer (split up into 2-4 cup amounts).
