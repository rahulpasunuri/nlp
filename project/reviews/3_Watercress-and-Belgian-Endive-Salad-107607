Boring, so add crumbled Maytag blue, walnuts or sliced toasted almonds,and a citrus dressing,

Forget the dressing, take a hint from Shawn and add toasted nuts, and an interesting blue type cheese. This only needs a really nice vinegar (white wine or sherry), but stands out with pomegranate seeds and a touch of pomegranate molasses to the vinegar, an adaptation of a Chez Sophie (Saratoga Springs, NY) recipe.

Based on the previous comments I embellished the recipe a bit. I added 1 1/2 teaspoons of dijon mustard to the dressing and 1/2 cup of toasted walnuts and 1/2 cup of Gorgonzola cheese to the salad. The five folks that I invited over found it to be quite delicious.

i served this to 3 nice people who thot i must be punishing them for some unknown sin. it was so bitter, so bland, not only was it inedible, it was a complete waste of $12 of ingredients and a half hour of my time. AWFUL.

Around here I can never get Belgian endive, only french endive. so I used that along with the watercress. Very simple and quite pleasant.Almost too simple. I kept thinking it needed something to dress it up a bit. Some cheese or nuts or something. Yet, still it was enjoyed.

The Belgian Endive was overwhelming. It was just blah. Perhaps a reduced amount of Belgian Endive and a more flavorfull dressing would save it. If I do try this combination of salad greens again, I will not use this recipe.
