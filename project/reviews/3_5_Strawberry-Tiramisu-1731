Delicious...except switch out the cream cheese for Mascarpone cheese.

Good recipe - quick, pretty, and tasty. I did as other reviewers suggested and dipped the ladyfingers quickly, and it did not turn out mushy at all. I used a 9" round dish instead of the called-for 8" square, and it worked fine. I used almost double the amount of strawberries though, maybe because of the pan difference.

This dessert was great! If you're going to make it, however, be careful not to soak the ladyfingers too much in the coffee mixture. Even drizzling them while they're already in the pan might be better. The coffee taste in mine was just a bit too strong.

I made a double batch for a big family Mother's Day dinner. The only change I made was using Kahlua instead of marsala. Everyone had seconds. I found that it was easy to make, it set well, and the flavour was wonderful. I can't wait to make it again.

Very easy and very good, even the next day. I did not have the experience of it being goopy but I left out one layer to have it fit nicely in the pan I had available.

Simple and delicious. I'm not a big dessert fan, but this is a special treat. I usually make it on Valentine's Day and arrange the strawberries in the shape of a heart. My husband likes it a lot.

I made it for a holiday work potluck, only one person said that they liked it. I found it too rich, goopy, and the flavour not very good overall. Won't bother making this again, am disappointed in the recipe after reading the other good reviews of this.

This was okay, but nothing special. Will not make again.

this has become my new favorite party dessert recipe. made it for easter dinner, and it was devoured while the other dessert choices were ignored. i couldn't find lady fingers, so i used pound cake, which seemed to be a good substitute. just a nice light ending to a spring meal.

This was very tasty & so easy to make. I used marsala, as directed in the recipe, but next I'd like to try it with brandy and/or kaluha just to see what the difference would be. I took the advise of others and dipped the ladyfingers fast! I will definitely make this again!

I have made this dessert twice now and will continue to when i need a light, familiar favorite for almost anyone. Definately needs to set up overnight. I like mine w/ a bit more marsala but be careful or it won't get firm enough. I especially like that it can be modified w/ both lower fat cream cheese and sour cream. VERY EASY w/ a pleasing result.

This is a delightful dish to be served with many dishes as a dazzling desert. It compliments the meal very nicely, and it is very easy to make. Enjoy it with your favorite fruits, but it wouldn't be strawberry tiramisu then would it.

The first time I made this "the crowd went wild!" Now the recipe is EXPECTED when I have dinner parties! I do though change the fruit seasonally, but strawberry is far the best choice. Thank you!

Very tasty and refreshing -- A nice twist to the tiramisu. And it wasn't hard either. Most importantly, I got a ton of complements.

I've been making this for years, always to rave reviews. It's not really a traditional preparation, but it's delicious nonetheless--and much easier than most tiramisu recipes, so it's great when you're pressed for time. Try it with fresh raspberries instead of the strawberries.

I've made this recipe for years and it is always a hit. The only suggestion I have is to dip the lady fingers very briefly in the espresso so they won't be soggy. It's a beautiful springtime dessert!

I loved it and got rave reviews when I made it for a dinner party.

Mmmm...great recipe! It turned out wonderfully, and not "goopy" at all like the other reviewer suggested. I made it a day early and left it in the refrigerator overnight. We loved the tiramisu, and thought the strawberries were a great touch.

Didn't work for me! Goopy, too rich, didn't serve well. Eight inch dish easily will serve 8, since servings can be small. I added dollop of whip cream and a mint sprig to camouflage disheveled serving, but four of eight guests didn't finish eating their portion. "Too rich" was consensus.
