These are delicious. They would be great as a snack (with or without a cocktail or a glass of sherry) or with a salad or soup. I have a few suggestions: weigh the cheese, rather than measuring by volume if you can; and crush and grind the peppercorns in a mortar and pestle for better control over the texture. I accidentally used all 4 eggs in the dough and the texture of the dough was just right, so I wonder if 3 would have been enough. I didnt have regular milk, but I did have buttermilk (dont ask), which I used with no apparent harm. I substituted a cup of whole wheat flour for one cup of AP flour and I think the flavour benefited, but it made the partly-cooked biscotti a little crumbly when I tried to slice them after a 10- minute wait. After another 15 minutes they were fine.

Wow! These were easy and had a wonderful flavor. I cheated on grinding the whole peppercorns and Hot Shot, my standard ground pepper, which is a combo of red and black. I also used asiago cheese, as that is what I had on hand. I successfully halved the recipe. Great snack food to have on hand.

I've made this biscotti countless times and everyone loves them. During the holidays, I give them away as gifts.

These are wonderful. I made a white bean and roasted garlic dip/spread, also from Epicurious, to go along with the biscotti.

This is a little bit time consuming but worth the work. They were a big hit at our party.

For the person who said it was just OK - you have to make sure that you use really good Parmesan cheese. These are fabulous. I have made this for several dinner and cocktail parties and they always go over well.

I've made these numerous times! I make them for us or close family friends (the husband is Italian!). Dr. Joe LOVES them...says they are just as good as any biscotti his Nani made. I even hear from his friends how much he loves them! So delicious with a glass of wine!

I made these with the addition of the fresh rosemary. While they smelled outrageous baking and were crisp and pretty to look at, the taste was just....meh. Ok, but I'd never make these again. Had to keep pushing them on guests who made no comment. I'm not used to that reaction so a two fork for me. Sorry.

i have been looking for a savory biscotti recipe, and this is incredible!! i used pecorino romano, and the flavor is wonderful! i will try adding fresh rosemary, as many have..i think that would take it over the top. the dough is also so easy to work with.. thank you for this keeper!!!

Perfect just as written! Simple, flavorful. I didn't have Reggiano so used Peccorio. Outstanding.

Bravo! One year later, after a dinner party at which some visiting Italian couples were the guests of honor, two of the ladies are still bugging me for this recipe. Glad I found it again! Unusual and definitely a keeper. Everyone gave it raves.

These biscotti are perfect on their own as a savory treat, or with a subtlely flavored spread such as white bean and roasted garlic, or artichoke and heart of palm bruchetta.

These were truly excellent! I followed the advice of some of the earlier reviews and baked them a little longer once they were cut. Also added some fresh thyme and rosemary that I had on hand and used truffle salt. Divine!

These are amazingly good! I've made them for several years now and learned to make double- and triple- batches as they disappear quickly. Excellent Holiday gifting, too. Use a decent Parmesan and plenty of it and don't stint on the pepper either. I use whole colored peppercorns roughly chopped in a coffee grinder - they make a very spicy and pretty topping. Make sure to bake just a little longer than you think necessary for the crisp to set in. And make more than you think you'll need - you'll be glad you did!

Really tasty!. Great with wine, cheese, soup, etc. Added extra pepper and cheese. Will try adding rosemary next time as others suggested.

Awesome recipe. I used a mixture of cheeses I had available in the fridge- parmesan, feta and sharp cheddar. I cooked longer that called for to get them nice and crispy. My guests loved them!

I introduced these to a group while camping and they vanished immediately! Easy and delicious - a perfect happy hour addition. My dad, a die-hard biscotti lover, loved these once he got used to the idea of "savory" biscotti.

Rating: 4
These are really great! I made them as written except I used mostly asiago cheese as that is what I had. I can foresee trying different spices and cheeses. For them to be at their best, you really need to crisp them on the second bake. I suggest cutting them fairly thinly (this is easy to do with this dough), baking at 350 instead of 300 and just watching till they toast a bit. I plan on freezing some and then refreshing in a 300 degree oven before serving. This will make a nice last-minute snack with wine.

Loved them! I cut the biscotti quite thin (1/4"), and used them like crackers. As for those who thought they were not crisp enough, a bit more oven time is always the solution.

We enjoyed this unusual biscotti with some well aged vin santo. I'm not sure I understand those who complained about this recipe. This was easy to prepare and crisped up very nicely. I suggest being generous in the amount of cheese sprinkled over the top of the logs before baking.

I was terribly disappointed with this recipe. I had cut this recipe out when it ran in the magazine and tucked it away hoping to make it when I had an abundance of really good Parm on hand. They were super easy but came out quite bland and not as crispy as I had hoped.

I made these last night and they came out great. Can definitely taste the pepper and they are crunchy! I prefer romano cheese so I used that plus 1/2 tsp or garlic powder. Would make these again.

These didn't turn out as crisp as I'd hoped. The flavor was good and they went well with wine. (what doesn't?)

Made these for a cocktail party - thinner and longer, about six inches long by 3/4 of an inch wide after cutting, and wrapped with prosciutto. Believe it or not, these went before the shrimp cocktail!

I make these every Christmas and I have to ration them away because my family consumes them while they're still cooling on the rack. Every one I have ever made them for LOVES them. They will even do favors for me in exchange for a few. Excellent recipe

Fresh rosemary really livens this recipe up. I made them and didn't think they were that great but a lot of people loved them. I will make them again and try using garlic salt this time to see if I can get a stronger flavour.

Having used a lot of different biscotti recipes, I found that the consistency of this one made the easiest, smoothest logs I have ever made. Only changes were 1/4 cup of Crisco instead of the full amount of butter and 1 cup of whole wheat flour instead of the full amount of white. The flavour is wonderful, too, Thank you.

My whole family (kids included) loved these. Good quality parmesan and freshly cracked pepper are essential. Absolutely addictive with a good glass of wine.

I would NOT make this recipe EVER again. What a total disappointment. It had no flavor even with the black pepper. I could have baked some Pillsbury biscuits and had a more tasty food item.

these were okay, but not all that great. at a party with a lot of other ppetizers there were a lot left over. not bad, and easy but nothing special. I had high hopes, but I won't make again. Hohum

Excellent. I added chopped, fresh rosemary. Be sure to bake as directed so they retain their crispness when stored in a tin. I offered it with cheddar cheese and a cheese shaver. The thin cheddar with the crisp biscotti and wine was a hit. I will package them in a cellophane bag and tie to a bottle of wine for holiday gifts.

With all these rave reviews I thought these would be a big hit at my dinner party. What a disappointment! They were too salty. May be from all the parmesan.

These are great! I cut the recipe in half, and wish I hadn't, because they're so good. We've been munching on them all afternoon, and just had them with asparagus soup, instead of croutons. Definitely will make these again.

The first time I made half the recipe just in case. I wish I had made more! So today I made the whole recipe and put some of the loaves in the freezer. Very tatsy and addictive. I added some cayenne pepper for more kick.

I made these biscotti exactly as described in the recipe. My foodie friends loved them. The black pepper adds a subtle bite in the aftertaste. They also keep very well and are wonderful appetizers to serve with Champagne and other sparkling wine.

Absolutely delicious! I brought a batch to a holiday cocktail party and these biscotti were the first items to disappear. My partner took the leftovers to his work - a construction company - and his co-workers polished them off very quickly (once they got over the idea of black pepper and Parmesan in biscotti, anyway). A definite keeper recipe for any occasion!

I made this for a Christmas party this weekend. Out of an assortment of such dishes as home-cured salmon, artisan bread, and six types of cheese, these were voted the crowd favorite. Everyone devoured them. I highly recommend them.

FANTASTIC! I made this to have with wine before Thanksgiving dinner (love the make-in-advance recipe!), and my guests devoured it! I used a little less Parmesan and a little more black pepper than the recipe called for, and the biscotti hit the perfect note -- spicy as well as comforting. Make sure you slice them to 1/2" thickness; I had a few that were too thick and were chewy rather than crumbly. A definite make-again recipe.
