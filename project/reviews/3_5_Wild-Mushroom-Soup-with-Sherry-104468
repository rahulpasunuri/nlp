For the past three years I have used this recipe for thanksgiving green beans. Cut the stock in half pour over oven roasted green beans and garnish with sautéed mushrooms. SO much better than that canned crap!!!

I absolutely love this! But, to add more flavor I started with about 4 slices of bacon, twice as much garlic and a dash of cajun seasoning. Cook the veggies and mushrooms in bacon grease and add the crumbled bacon just before serving. I also used about 4 cups of heavy beef stock instead of chicken.

Have been making this soup since it was published in the RSVP section of Bon Appetit in 2000. It has been requested at all our winter family dinners since. I have used dried shiitake when I can't find fresh and played with different portions and types of mushrooms. It always tastes so good! Also, it is even better the next day.

This was delicious with a few enhancements. Added tarragon and used dried porcini mushrooms including the broth. Needed a decent amount of Salt and pepper. We loved it.

el blando! even with my well loved stock this was a waste of wonderful fungi. I had to add so much to appreciate the flavors (nutmeg rosemary...)and add texture that I basically voided the recipe altogether by the time I'd rescued this bad start.

I made changes based on other reviewers' comments, and I wanted to double the recipe and also realized the recipe called for way too much stock. I doubled all the other ingredients, but reduced the stock to 6 cups. For mushrooms I used the following: 3.5 oz. shiitake, 8 oz. crimini, 3.5 oz oyster, 16 oz. white button mushrooms, and 1 oz. dried porcini mushrooms reconstituted in the dry white wine. I was dubious about blending all the soup, but it really brought it together. Very special recipe for Christmas Eve, held up great in the Crock Pot. Served drizzled with Truffle Oil and Parmesan.

It was a hit at soup luncheon after Good Friday services. It held very well in a crock pot for several hours. I tasted carefully to make sure it had the right amount of salt- ---made a big difference in the flavor when I added just a bit more salt. I simmered 1 ounce (for a double recipe) of dried porcini in some of the broth and added the porcini and broth (be sure to strain the porcini broth through a paper coffee filter). I also added two cups of cooked wild rice. (Thanks to previous reviewers for those suggestions). I sauteed some cremini mushroom slices to add to the pureed soup, and also added a teaspoon or so of fresh thyme near the end of the cooking time. Had to substitute shitakes for oyster mushrooms, and I forgot the celery (darn). I think that the recipe deserves four forks with the changes I made.

OK - made it again 3 years later, still terrific. And this area knows from mushrooms: it's Pennsylvania's biggest cash crop, grown 40 miles from here. Excellent dish, esp. w/ dried porcini broth. Love it!

Probably will use only 6 cups broth next time & maybe more shallots, used Chantarelle instead of Oyster b/c our store didn't have any - but this was excellent - It's going on our Thanksgiving Menu!

Have to give it a 1 fork for just OKAY, perhaps my stock had too much water (I simmered a whole chicken for 2 hrs) the soup was horribly bland. I was trying to recreate a recipe my mom makes except she adds a cup of wild rice and shredded chicken.

I used a stick blender so there was a bit more texture. Tried with the cream (delicious) and without to reduce calories (very good.)

This recipe was nothing special. It was very bland and definitely not something I would make for friends/fam. I tried to recover it by first adding MSG then straining it through my chinois. That helped with flavor and texture. I then added some mixed sherry sautéed mushrooms at the end &Bottom line it wasnt worth the work. Ive had better from a can.

Instead of wine/sherry I used Cognac. Instead of the cream I added shredded Pecorino cheese. Wonderful! I garnished with a crostini of roasted garlic/shallot and a little bit of pecorino. I will make this again.

Rating: 3
This recipe is a nice basic recipe. I did amplify the flavors by adding more sherry and cream. I also used a hand held blender to break down the mushroom pieces. I didn't want them to be totally pulverized, so the hand blender gave me nice size pieces. Will make this again.

I made this for our Gourmet Dining Group. It was the hit of the night! The host asked for recipe to put in their cookbook. I did take a package of dried porcini mushroomS & soak in the boiling white wine. I added the whole mixture in with the Sherry. The Sherry is a must! LA

I have made this recipe many times and find it very easy and delicious. I usually skip the shallots and add twice as much garlic. Also I finda the a bay leaf & a spring of fresh rosemary, removed before blending, enhances the flavor.

This is a wonderful soup. I love a pureed soup but decided this isn't the soup for that which of course makes it much easier. I used mostly white and brown mushrooms with some dried porcini.

Rating: 3
Dried porcinis with broth instead of half of the chicken broth was a good idea - lots of deep earthy flavor! (Dried chinese mushrooms next time?) Didn't puree. Skipped the cream to keep it light for a first course. Sherry is ESSENTIAL! Great for mid-winter main course w/ bread, salad and hearty red. A keeper!

Easy to make and loved it! I followed a previous review and used less stock, about 5 cups and it was thick and wonderful.

I've had better mushroom soups before. I prefer a mushroom soup with mushroom pieces rather than a pureed soup, but I thought I'd give this one a try. It needs something else ... maybe even a little nutmeg, cinnamon, or cardamon.

I have been making this soup for several years and this has to be one of my favourite recipes for mushroom soup. Its always a huge hit when I make it. I pretty much stick to the recipe although I use 1/2 of the butter called for and usually only about 5 cups of chicken stock. The soup is thicker and the mushroom flavour more intense. DO NOT leave the sherry out. The sherry adds the perfect touch to it. Fabulous!!

Mushroom lovers rejoice! This is an excellent soup. I used beef broth instead of chicken ... it gave the soup a wonderful rich flavor. I also added leeks and extra mushrooms. I will definitely make this again.

I took some suggestions and added a few of my own to really take this soup to over the top status. In addition to fresh porcinis, criminis and shitaakes, I soaked 6 oz of dried mixed wild 'shrooms and used the broth as well in the soup. I also used leeks rather than shallots/onions. At the end, I added 2 generous tablespoons of fresh lemon thyme. A truffle oil finish gave it that last bit of complexity it was needing. Super yum.

This soup really hit the spot on a fall evening... it was easy and can be easily "dressed up" by a number of things... I personally found that a drizzle of white truffle oil at the end made a good soup ...great!

This is a wonderful basic recipe. I used Pacific mushroom broth instead of the chicken stock for a richer mushroom flavor, and added morels to the mushroom mix.

Used Kitchen Basics Natural Chicken Stock and followed recipe as directed. It looked good, but mediocre flavor. I was hoping for deep, woodsy, rich mushroomy flavor as in other reviews, but it was salty and slight in flavor.

A warning to those of you who are going to make this using vegetable broth...do not use Swanson's Organic Vegetable broth. I was making this for a company potluck and decided to make it with vegetable broth instead of chicken broth (as I normaly do) and it tasted like cardborad. Swanson's uses fruit juice in their broth! (Who would have known)?! I threw the whole batch out. I make this soup often using Trader's Joe's frozen bag of mushrooms (minus the powder seasoning and the kikurage mushrooms because they are too chewy) and add some porcini mushrooms. It is a really great soup.

Rating: 3
Have made this soup exactly as written and enjoyed it. Made it again last weekend with a few changes: added a packet of dry porcinis and the soaking liquid which intensified the earthy flavour; subbed cognac for the sherry; added some fresh parsley and a few dashes of nutmeg; did not puree but left chunky. The resulting soup was wonderful - rich, hearty and very flavourful. Enjoy!

Rating: 2
Like the previous reviewer I only gave this two forks. Good, not great. Texture was vey nice. Used a combination of bellas, shiitake, oyster and crimini. Can't imagine that Tabasco would help this recipe (as suggested in another review) since proportionately it brings more vinegar than heat. No accounting for taste!

Rating: 2
A country divided by its vast expanses -- mountains, plains, river, time zones, and culinary tastes -- at least that's what I conclude from these reviews. For us Westeners this was a bit blase. It did taste strongly or mushrooms and of butter, but it cannot be considered a great soup -- just another recipe that proves that any thing edible cooked with a stick of butter taste good. I always make the recipe at least once as written before I review -- it's only fair. However, I had to add thyme and a dash or two of Tabasco before serving. I'm afraid the leftover will be used in casseroles rather than rewarming.

This is a real winner. I served it as a first course for Easter supper and everybody loved it - even the kids who usually despise mushrooms. As some of the other reviewers suggested, I added a little extra sherry during reheating and a sprinkling of chives for garnish. For a more robust flavor I also substituted Better than Boullion chicken base for the canned broth. A fantastic soup! Tastes even better the next day.

This was seriously YUM!!!!!! I used less liquid and also got a package of dried mushrooms which are simmered in water or broth and saved the liquid to add in final stage of adding broth.

I had this soup at the Dilworthtown inn, and loved it. So I was thrilled to find this recipe. The first time I made it I didn't have any sherry, so I just used white wine. While it was very good something was missing. The next time I made sure to put in the sherry and it made a huge difference! This is my favorite mushroom soup.

Rating: 4
I used baby ports, shitake and button mushrooms - it was excellent. I pureed it with my hand blender before adding cream so I was able to limit the amnt of cream based on the thickness of the soup. I also added some extra sherry at the end. And some thyme, which really works with this soup. A must try recipe!

I was trying to duplicate a delicious soup I had for lunch today and found this one. I stopped at Trader Joe's (my FAVORITE store)and bought everything I needed. I couldn't find fresh fancy mushrooms. So I got a couple packages of dried wild mushrooms, added some chopped carrots, and it worked out great. I also added a little more sherry than required. It's a keeper!!

Excellent soup! I have made this for several dinner parties and as a starter to our Thanksgiving meal last month. My family has requested it again for Christmas! Finding the different types of mushrooms at our local grocer is hit or miss some time, however you can easily substitute other mushroom types.

Really tasty. Got great reviews from a friend who came over unannounced. Looks pretty ugly when blended (very tasty, but pretty gross -- don't try serving it to your kids). When I make it again, I will not blend it but serve it "as is".

An excellent soup, and not too heavy for a first course (even though I added a little more cream). I also added about an ounce of dried porcinis to the broth. Since I used only criminis and buttons,I found this to be a relatively economical way to achieve a rich and complex mushroom flavor.

Rating: 2
I expected more from this soup. It was easy to prepare and seemed to have all the "right" ingredients to make a fine soup. I think a deeper mushroom flavor could be had by using dried porcinis, along with the soaking water.It was certainly good enough...but I'll search on for another.

Rating: 3
So wonderfully subtle that next time I think I'll cut the garlic by a third, to make sure it doesn't compete with the earthy mushroom flavor. I will also follow the lead of the previous reviewer who added a little rosemary -- or maybe I'll add thyme instead -- just to add another layer of taste.

Rating: 3
I guess my expectations were too high after reading the reviews. I thought this soup was very good but not as special as some described. My husband and several of my guests thought it was wonderful so I gave it 3 forks. I would make it again, I liked the fact that I could make it the day before my dinner and aside from the fact that cutting up everything was a little tedious, it was very simple and foolproof.

I served this at Thanksgiving and everyone loved it except me. It has too much garlic in it and the mushroom taste is overpowered. I am going to make it again without the garlic and enjoy the woodsy mushroom flavor. I was very impressed with the way the pureed mushrooms thicken the broth -- from the look of the finished product you would think that I had used a quart of cream instead of the little bit called for in the recipe.

This is a really nice recipe; with a few minor adjustments I think it can be better though. I added more mushrooms than the recipe calls for, I omitted the flour, added some crushed red pepper and did not puree the soup in the blender. A taste call perhaps. I'm about to make it once again...

Fabulous - a big hit at my dinner party this weekend. Everyone was impressed. I couldn't find crimini mushrooms so the produce guy convinced me that baby bellas would be fine (and were sold pre-sliced, a bonus) Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.

Served this at a recent dinner party and got rave reviews from all the guests. I have never rated anything four forks before and consider my standards extraordinarily high - but for mushroom soup, it truly doesn't get any better than this. I used about 50% more mushrooms than the recipe called for - other than that, didn't change a thing. Will definitely make again.

This is a large recipe, but it 'halves' nicely. For four people, I cut all the quantities in half, and, as others did, pureed about 2/3 of the soup, leaving enough mushroom bits and recogniseable vegetables to add some visual interest and texture. Very flavourful, and not that fussy to make.

Didn't care for the mushrooms suggested (and hard to find in our grocery), so I used standard mushrooms and lots of portabello. Much tastier. Also, I skipped the sherry and added more white wine. Only puree' half, too! It's a new family favorite (even Mom & Grandma begged for the recipe)!

Very simple yet tasty. I did not puree the soup and really enjoyed it. Next time, however, I might consider pureeing half the recipe for added thickness. I used porcini and Italian mushrooms, and I substituted half-and-half for the whipping cream and Brummel & Brown spread for half of the butter (to cut down on fat content).

Very good flavor, I reserved part of the soup mixture and did not process in blender so there were still some pieces of mushrooms in the final product--next time I will reserve some mushroom pieces to add at the end.
