I made this for Thanksgiving and my friend requested that I make it again for our Christmas Eve dinner. I made it just as is and love having some for left-overs.

Just ok. Lots left on my salad plates when the table was cleared.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year, and it is going on the menu again for 2009. The tart cherries add a nice twist to this classic salad. I did not use the Sweet and Spicy pecans, but simply candied them.

Delicious. Prepare the day or night before serving so sauce dressing has time to coat and settle on fruit. Wonderful.

My Mother always made waldorf salad. But I also for much like this one. I like using my Door County Wisconsin dried cherries with lemon juice extra celery. In use Hellmans mayo and sugar. Top with candied nuts. I use any kind. I also substited the cherries and lemon juice sometimes with cranberries and orange juice. I also sprinke the top with cinnamon.

A standard for our Christmas dinner every year since I ran across the recipe. I forgot to add the cherries this year and didn't really miss them. Yummy.

This was a great recipe. I did use dried cranberries instead of cherries. It was fresh and delightful. This is a keeper.....

Great recipe. I received tons of compliments and many requests for this recipe when I made it for a large Thangsgiving gathering. It was so good, I definitely plan on making it again.

I substituted cherries and pecans with craisins and candied walnuts. This was a delicious salad, as the tart flavors balance well with the sweet. The only problem was that my bf thought it was a bit "too chunky" for a salad. Next time I'll cut the apples and craisins into smaller pieces.

This was a hit at our Thanksgiving dinner. I made two changes: substitued craisins for the dried cherries and used unflavored pecans. It was delicious. The preparation was a great way to keep our five year old granddaughter occupied as she stirred the ingredients into the dressing as I cut them up.

I made this for Thanksgiving Dinner and people loved it. I added vanilla to the dressing--which one of the reviewers suggested--and used dried cranberries, but otherwise I followed the recipe as written. The only hard part is keeping myself from munching on the candied walnuts (yes, another variation, but walnuts are local tradition.) Next time I will add some white chicken or turkey meat to serve this as a main dish salad or filling for a wrap.

Interesting salad that kids like! I use the apples from my tree and cut back on the "dressing". Make sure you use tart dried cherries, not sweet ones.

I whipped this up at short notice for a dinner party one night and everyone loved it. It's a very refreshing and tasty salad. I left out the cherries out of personal preference and substituted walnuts for the pecans.

Made this for a Consulat Event and everyone just loved it. Very refreshing and healthy too!

Big hit at Christmas. Pecans definitely elevate it above the ordinary, as does the dried fruit. I had dried cranberries and blueberries so used them - terrific and pretty. Otherwise no change to the recipe. Just as good a couple of days later.

I made this on the weekend and it turned out great. Used sugar-twin replacement and instead of the cherries I used something called 'fruit burst mix', with tiny bits of pineapple, raisins, apricots, papaya, dried cherries, apples, banana chips and a mix of nuts.Delicious, and better the next day.

The mayo sauce was a bit thinner than I would've liked..next time I think I'll omit the lemon juice. Otherwise, escellent. the pecans are a must!

I have made this salad several times now. I use Fuji apples and Japanese mayo (you can find it in an Asian food store), which is milder and not as tangy as regular mayo. My guests and family always demand this salad. Yum!

Rating: 4
I made this salad just an hour before serving our Thanksgiving dinner and it was fabulous. I substituted sour cream with Crème fraiche and used Fuji apples, and dried bing cherries. It stayed fresh and crunchie for several days - until it was all gone. It is a wonderful recipe and will now be a Thanksgiving standard at our house.

As others have noted, the pecans make this dish something special. They would certainly work on their own as a snack. I also followed the recommendations to make the salad the night before, which was helpful. I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was well received.

Well! What a surprise! Made this for Thanksgiving and, fortunately, believed other reviewers and made it the day before. Tasted it when I assembled it and thought, "Gosh, this is awful! I better be ready to go to the store tomorrow morning if this doesn't improve." Husband thought it was dismal at that stage,too-- but voila!, by Thanksgiving morning the flavors had melded and a star had emerged! Guests said it was the best they'd ever had. The nuts on top are terrific, well worth the effort, and are even good by themselves as a snack. A definite keeper, and we'll see those nuts in our gift bags for friends this holiday season.

Wonderful salad. As stated before, it needs to be made a day in advance for the flavors to meld. Definitely, do not skip the pecans...they make the whole thing come together beautifully.

Rating: 3
This was quite good and very popular at a party. However, the most popular thing about it was the sweet and spicy pecans, so be sure to make those with it. Without a doubt, make this salad the night before and let it sit in the regrigerator over night. When I made the dressing, it tasted kinda yucky, but after sitting over night mixing with the fruit flavors, it was great.

This is an excellent recipe for a Waldorf Salad. Like a few other reviewers, I too thought Waldorfs had chicken, so here's what I did: I tossed some boneless skinless chicken breast tenders with ground mustard, ground ginger, coriander and paprika, flash-sauteed them for color, then simmered them in some chicken stock till done. After cooling them, I cubed them and added to the rest of the ingredients. Also, I was worried that the dressing might be a little bland, so I added some poupon mustard, some honey and some white wine vinegar to the mayo, and I doused the dry ingredients with the lemon juice (to keep the apples from browning) and a little rice wine vinegar. Although these additions sound a little much, they produced fabulous results. The candied pecans taste great, but does anyone else have a problem with them sticking to your teeth?

I found using half Granny Smith and half red crisp Galas best. I cut the grapes into circles. (prettier) Definitely make the night before to let flavors blend. I used Bibb lettuce cups to hold the salad and served it as a side with glazed ham.

I LOVE this salad!

I would give this 3 1/2 forks!! It really improved between the night I made it and the next day. I thought it tasted a little mayonnaisey at first even after adding more lemon juice (i like the tartness) The next day it was wonderful--perfect! The pecans really add to this. I used sugar instead of corn syrup for them. It is a lot easier I think. You just stir until the sugar caramelizes--about 8 minutes. Best of all, there is no mess! Delicious!!

Rating: 4
This is a lovely, delicious salad! I used (red) Gala apples in lieu of the Granny Smith ones, and added more sugar (I like a sweet dressing for Waldorf salad), but otherwise made the recipe exactly as written. And I did include the Sweet and Spicy Pecans. They are dynamite with the salad -- and all by themselves. This recipe keeps well, too.

Is it only me, or does anyone else thing that "Waldorf Salad" is supposed to have chunks of chicken in it??? I have eaten this dish our many times in a restaurant in my town, and also in the 70's in New York. So, I will try this recipe and let everyone know how it came out..but I will make it with chunks of poached chicken!

Oh. My. God. This is so-o-o delicious! I quadrupled it for a large birthday luncheon, and my guests RAVED! At least five people told me it was "the best Waldorf I've ever eaten." Friends are still giving me compliments two weeks later! I used Craisins cherry-flavored cranberries b/c I couldn't find dried cherries. Hint: The pecans are a must! I just followed the recipe to the letter, and they were quite easy.

Rating: 3
The cherries are a wonderful addition to the traditional waldorf salad. I thought the recipe was a little tart with the granny smith apples and lemon juice. Next time i will either use sweeter apples or cut back on the lemon juice. Also, i think dried cherries cry out for toasted pecans so i added them. overall, a good recipe.

I made this dish for a BBQ. I enjoyed it a lot the only thing I did different is that I added a bottle of Penelope's Fine Cabernet Sauvignon Sauce(http://www.worldpantry.com/penelopes/home.html). It made a good impression. Nick, from Denver, CO

This was the BEST Waldorf Salad we have ever tasted - bar none!!! I substituted some plain yogurt for some of the Mayonaise - used a mixed, dried fruit from Bulk Foods at Grocery store that had Cherries, blueberries, cranberries - Our guests raved over it!! This will become a regular.

I have been looking for an 'updated' version of the Waldorf salad that I had so many times at pot lucks (they always had potential, just were never quite there). This definitely fits the bill! I did substitute dried cranberries for the cherries, and stuck with tart apples. Everyone loved it!

I made it for a baby shower and everyone really enjoyed it. I used both Granny Smith apples and red tart apples for added color. I substituted the dried cherries with dried cranberries (crasions). I made a triple batch, sent some home with guests and was pleased to have some left over for my lunch the next day. Very easy and tasty.

My husband has always said how he hated Waldorf Salad until he tried this one. He loved it! I couldn't find the dried tart cherries, so I just left that part out. The pecans are super and easy to make. I used a variety of apples and also added a splash of vanilla to the dressing to make it come "alive."

Rating: 4
This was absolutely yummy. The best Waldorf Salad I've tasted. I changed to 8 apples: 4 Granny Smith and 4 sweet variety Red Apples. I did not change the dressing amount even with the additional apples. One trick that makes it better - let the salad sit overnight before serving. The cherries will really plump up if you do.

Its Christmas time and I live on east coast of Australia. Its extremely hot here and a traditional turkey with all the trimmings is out of the question this year, so we are having lots of salads and cold cuts(smoked turkey breast and ham) the waldorf salad goes really well with a less traditional meal.

We made this recipe for our staff Christmas party. Scaled it to serve 200, and the salad was a hit. Loved the pecans, I tried to foil the baking sheet and just remove it to cool. Absolutely did not work. The pecans just stuck to the foil -they really do need a fresh piece for cooling. Also, used a spring mix of greens instead of just romaine - it looked very festive! We'll do this one again for catering!

Was very good. I didn't have grapes so used chopped carrots and raisins instead, which were fine. Spiced up the pecan recipe per suggestions below, to great effect. Used Miracle Whip for the mayo which was also fine. Added a bit more sugar and sour cream.

This was the first time I had ever made a Waldorf salad so I made the mistake of not cutting up the apples in small enough pieces. The pecans were very good but were not that spicy or sweet (instead were kind of buttery tasting): Maybe that's how they're supposed to be?

Made it to go with the Easter ham, to general acclaim. Pecans were fun to make! Yesterday I had leftovers, with a great addition. I crumbled stilton cheese on it, then sprinkled the pecans. Four forks! More, please.

This recipe is awesome! I did have to use dried cranberries, since I couldn't find dried tart cherries, but I don't believe that it detracted from the finished product. I also heeded the advice of others and added shredded Romaine lettuce. Fabulous! Love those pecans!

Next time I would use less apples and more cherries/grapes. The pecans are delicious! Don't leave them out.

Excellent salad - the variety of flavors & textures is wonderful. Added cubed poached chicken (poached in low-salt chick broth w/ some chopped onion, chopped garlic and 1tsp thyme to give flavor to the chicken)to make it a real meal. Used shredded romaine tossed with a bit of the dressing. Do not omit the pecans! In answer to a prior reviewers question - put greased alum foil on the baking pan to help clean-up. Just be sure to cool them on another piece to minimize sticking. Great meal!

I served this at my post-Rose Parade brunch and received many compliments. Following the suggestions of other reviewers, I used a different recipe for the pecans to make them sweeter and spicier. I used one and a half cups of sugar and 3/4 of a cup of water for one and a half cups of pecans, and omitted the corn syrup called for in the original. I also used half the amount of mayonnaise called for in the recipe, and substituted Mexican cream for the sour cream. I added pomegranate seeds because I happened to have some left over from another recipe, and they worked quite well.

The cherries and the pecans make for a nice twist on the standard Waldorf salad. The next time I make this, I will reduce the apples and increase the cherries, celery, grapes, and pecans :) I also will make the pecans spicier to balance out the sweetness of all the fruits.

Impress your friends -- make this salad!! I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and boosted the sour cream to 1/2 cup. I didn't use the raisens and included unsoaked cherries (for the chewiness). My apples started going brown on me so I quickly covered them in lemon juice. Many requests for the recipe.

I thought this was a refreshing alternative to the traditional version. I am a personal chef and I prepared this for a client of mine. I used dried cranberries instead of the tart cherries and they liked it but...they asked me to make it again with 1/2 red declicious apples and 1/2 granny smith and to use raisins instead of the cherries... and they liked it even more. I also kicked up the sour cream to 1/2 cup. They loved the sweet & spicy nuts as well. Definitely a repeat performance for me!!!

I thought this was a great salad. I used dried cranberries and did not soak them. And used red delicious apples and walnuts since that is what I had on hand. It still was excellent, but I can't wait to try this again with the more "tart" apple and the pecans. This is a great variation of Waldorf Salad. Happy Cooking!

Excellent recipe! Easy to make, very good flavor and texture. I didn't pre-soad cherries. Also, I didn't have enought cherries, so I added some raisins and dried cranberries, and the salad was great!

I teach a cooking lab at a university and often send my students to this web-site for recipes for class. We tried this Waldorf Salad and it was excellent. If we give it a 4 then that also means that it probably couldn't be messed up and was so good that all the students liked it (and the teacher). Those pecans are good enough for using on almost anything. Everyone was relieved that it didn't call for marshmallows.

This was a very nice variation of the traditional Waldorf Salad. I loved it and so did everyone at the party I took it to. I did not soak the cherries because I like the texture of dried fruit.
