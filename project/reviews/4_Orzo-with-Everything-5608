I doubled recipe for potluck. I modified recipe per comments from site. I boiled orzo in diluted chicken broth instead of water till al dente (I just used chk boillion cubes to jazz up the water). I added a bit more kalamata olives (costco sells pitted ones) and a bit more sundried tomatoes (drain super well or salad will be too oily). I added less olive oil then called for. I omited radichio. Don`t skimp on pine nuts or parmesan. Enjoy!

I've made this at least a dozen times. Last couple of times I used diced celery, which my husband prefers to radicchio. As other reviewers pointed out, feta seems to go better than parmesan and white balsamic won't turn the orzo a muddy colour. Extra toasted pine nuts won't hurt. They give it the fabulous crunch. I actually found sun-dried tomatoes in julieene strips and pitted, sliced kalamata olives at my supermarket. Now, nothing could be easier. Great as a salad with anything off the barbecue, especially Cornish hens. I think it should be called easy-peasy orzo with anything. I'm sure I'll make it many dozens of more times. I even microwaved it once to warm the leftovers up a little and it was still fantastic.

I have made this numerous times for potlucks and for gatherings at the house. It is always a huge hit, and people always ask for the recipe. I've used white balsamic (keeps the pasta from turning a brown color) and regular balsamic; it comes out perfectly either way. Everyone loves this salad!

This dish has become my "signature dish" at potlucks. I do variations on it, depending on what ingredients I have available. This last time I made it: Raw pepitas instead of pine nuts Green Greek olives instead of Kalamata Garlic powder added to hot pasta/oil/vinegar instead of minced at end (softens the garlic flavor) I like to add some fresh ground black pepper Since I don't grow basil, I chose to used dried this time. It was a huge hit!

I've made this 5 or 6 times now and it's delicious every time, with lots of enthusiastic compliments thrown my way. For fun, I just tried it substituting fennel for the radicchio, walnuts for the pine nuts, and the addition of a tablespoon of freshly grated ginger -- also quite tasty!

I have made this recipe over and over again to rave reviews from everyone. I have substituted a few ingredients from time to time (no radiccio, celery instead or even red pepper) and have even made it without oil or had to substitute the balsamic for lemon juice and it is still fantastic! Do yourself a favor and load up on pine nuts (you can freeze them) because it's just not the same without them.

I have been making this for years, often as written (with a tad less oil) and sometimes with substitutions and additions. I've concluded that you cannot mess this up. It's delicious as a main dish with the addition of grilled lamb, shrimp, or chicken, with arugula instead of radicchio, and with white balsamic instead of brown (if you don't want the orzo to turn brown.) Every single time I make this, someone wants the recipe.

Been making this for many years -- a winner! The only change I make is to use feta cheese instead of parmesan, and I usually toast the pine nuts for extra flavor. Sometimes we leave out the garlic, which can be quite strong -- and we're really garlic people. It's a great dish to bring for a pot luck, and it's perfect for lunch. It's always in regular rotation in our house from Spring though Fall.

I've made this many times and love it. It's the ultimate Italian comfort food, substantial and flavorful, no "heat" though. To save time, use minced sun-dried tomatoes, drain them and you will still have plenty of olive oil and can omit the rest of it from the recipe. I usually add more pine nuts and garlic. It matures after a day or so, so is perfect to make ahead of time. Also I like to serve it warm instead of chilled.

Try grilling the radicchio before adding them to the salad. It gives a bit of a smoky flavor. I may substitute the radicchio with sauteed kale or southern greens since my husband and son did not care for the radicchio.

I LOVE this recipe! I start with it as written (love the tart vinegar and bitter radicchio), and usually increase all by 50% to use a whole box of orzo (it never goes to waste). Often make additions such as artichoke hearts, scallions, cherry tomatoes, sometimes red pepper flakes or cayenne to spice it up, or vary the nuts or cheese - always such a huge hit, I've taken to carrying printouts of the recipe - I am always asked for it. Without question, one of my absolute favorites - a WINNER!

This is a great recipe for a potluck or a barbecue! I was a little worried about the radicchio but found it to be very good in combination with all the other flavors in this dish. I started out by using only half the balsamic vinegar, since others had mentioned that it was too much, but I ended up adding in the rest and it was fine. Maybe it depends on the balsamic vinegar one uses. I use Trader Joe's Gold Quality balsamic vinegar.

I love those bold flavors. Took this to a pot luck dinner with a few modifications; it disappeared. Didn't have radicchio, but it needed something bright for color. I added a cup of firm, quartered cocktail tomatoes, cut olive oil to 2 Tbl.--there's enough from the olives and sun-dried tomatoes-- and used crumbled feta in lieu of parmesan. Addition of some chopped artichoke hearts would also work. It's a complete light meal on a bed of leafy greens.

I was looking for a good make-ahead pasta dish I could start in the morning and not have to turn the stove on due to the heatwave.It was wonderful! I am making it again today to take to bookclub tonight. I did make a couple of changes just because it was what I had on hand: sun-dried tomatoes not in oil, radicchio mixed with baby greens from a bag of mix, Romano cheese instead of Parmesan, and I didn't have pine nuts. I will add the nuts this time (for a little crunch) and I have radicchio, but I like the tomatoes without the oil (I felt there was enough in the dressing.)Very delicious and easy, now on my regular rotation of summer dishes.

Rating: 4
Outstanding summer salad that I'll definitely make again! A friend visiting from Italy couldn't get enough of it. I doubled the recipe and ended up using more than 1 c. white balsamic vinegar. Also added extra sun-dried tomatoes. Just be aware that the orzo swallows the balsamic if you make the salad a few days in advance. However, there's no problem fixing it with more balsamic.

Rating: 3
So easy and delicious! For the dressing, I first tossed the orzo with a bit of olive oil so it wouldn't stick, then mashed a garlic clove with salt into a paste, and whisked in olive oil, white balsamic and black pepper, like a salad dressing. The garlic didn't get bitter but I think the dressing worked perfectly. Added kalamata olives, cherry tomatoes, pine nuts, and crumbled feta with Mediterranean herbs. Delicious, really!

This is absolutely delicious - so full of flavour. I read all the reviews (and there are many)and then went for it.

I will definitely be adding this to my list of "tried and trusted".

I made this when the recipe first came out. Since then, I have made it many times and it has been enthusiastically enjoyed by all. I have shared the recipe many times, as well. I am glad I can point the audience to epicurious.com! Two tiny adjustments - I use slightly less olive oil (1/4 c. vs. 5 T.). Also, I prefer shredding the parmesan rather than grating it. This could be because I use a micro-plane for grating and I prefer a beefier texture for the parmesan. I think it goes better with the texture of the dish. Yum!

Made with a greek lamb dinner, excellent. Use whited balsamic as the orzo will absorb the brown, just looks more appealing. Also reduced the olive oil, increased the tomatoes and used feta cheese. Be sure to cook the orzo in chicken broth as it adds a lot of flavor.

Wonderful as is. I was a bit nervous putting in the radicchio as I find it bitter, but when shredded, it was a great addition to the orzo.

Excellent pasta salad. I used feta instead of parmesan, which I think works better. I prepared the first steps of the salad (including the garlic) the day before the brunch to let all flavors meld. I used less olive oil. Then, an hour or two before I added the pine nuts and basil. Skipped the radichhio. Requires a bit more sundrieds and olives then called for. Was very tasty!

3.5 forks from this reviewer! This is a delicious, quick, healthy salad. It invites you to be creative and find interesting additions at the market's olive bar. I used kalamata olives, green olives with chopped garlic, lemon zest, and roasted cherry peppers. I didn't use the cheese because I didn't think it needed it. I'll make this again and again. P.S. It's actually better the second day.

I made this last night and served with the chili-rubbed ribs and corn with jalapeno butter from this site, and there was silence except for lip smacking during the meal. Unlike others, we didn't find the radicchio bitter at all...and as for the color, I used white balsamic (Trader Joe's has it), so the color was not offensive. Following suggestions of other readers, I did add more sun dried tomatoes and cut back on the olive oil. Very tasty dish and I'm looking forward to having leftovers today. BTW, the ribs were superb and would also recommend the corn. Thanks for another winner!

This was pretty good but I didn't like the bitter back taste of the radicchio. Next time I will omit it altogether. Maybe use arugula or plain ole lettuce instead. I would also double the amount of olives and sun dried tomatoes. Balsamic is perfect although it does give a dark color to the orzo. The pine nuts are very nice, maybe a tiny bit less, maybe not.

Had to add to my prior review, as I quintupled the recipe last night for 70. It is the perfect make ahead side dish. You can mix the olives and tomatoes in the morning, boil the orzo 3 or 4 hours before, mix in with the tomatoes. Chop the radiccio, basil, 12 hours before. Then right before serving put it all together. I got many compliments.

Loved it. Brought this salad to a housewarming and people were lined up to eat it before I could get out of the way. My only dislike was the bitterness of the raw garlic. I thought it overpowered the finished dish so I would omit, reduce the amount, or roast or toast it the next time to mellow the garlic bite (and maybe reduce the amt of oil & vinegar slightly- it was a bit soupy). Otherwise delish.

Very Good! - The combination of Balsamic Vinegar and fresh Basil is the best - Reminds me of the Tomato, Basil and Couscous Salad from this website, which is my favorite. My boyfriend, who is a top chef, enjoys both very much, and he is hard to impress. I made the recipe as is, and have only a a few suggestions: Too much garlic, I would say use only one clove or even omit it altogether. It also seemed a little on the dry side so I ended up adding a little more oil and vinegar, although other reviewers have suggested adding less. Also, I would recommend definitely using oil packed sundried tomatoes. I used dry packed, which I reconstituted, but they just did not have the same flavor as oil packed. And as with the Couscous Salad, the combination of Balsamic Vinegar and fresh Basil is really what makes it so delicious (P.S. - another wonderful Orzo salad that is a summer staple in our house is the Garden Orzo Salad from Sheila Lukin's USA Cookbook - try it if you can!)

Started full into making this recipe, then discovered that I only had apple cider vinegar and no balsamic--decided that I couldn't just skip it, so put it in. It still turned out very good, (I wouldn't recommend to any degree to use apple cider) It just must be perfect with balsamic if its this good with apple cider. I would recommend as others have to reduce the garlic. Its just a little too overpowering...

I have made this dish for years. It seems to be the summer pasta salad of choice for us. I usually make it according to the recipe everytime, but this last time, while the orzo was still warm, I tossed it with an artichoke pesto (a jar of finely chopped artichoke hearts and olive oil). Then I continued as usual but adding no additional olive oil. It was FABULOUS!!

This is a delicious side dish! I used chicken bouillon in the pasta water for extra flavor, changed amounts of some ingredients to suit personal taste (less balsamic and garlic, more of most everything else), and added crumbled feta as well.

Served with grilled chicken pesto sausages and Baked Cherry Tomatoes w/Parmesan Topping (from this site, using the ingredients recommended by the Vancouver reviewer), followed by grilled pineapple with cinnamon rum sauce for dessert.

I definitely made this by eyeballing ingredients to suit personal taste. Very glad I didn't use all the balsamic or oil suggested! I didn't add cheese, either. Whilst enjoyable, I feel like this needs a sweet ingredient to balance out the vinegary sharpness of the olives, tomatoes and balsamic (and the bitterness of the radicchio). Perhaps some cubed, oven-crisped butternut squash or sweet potato? I'd give it three forks with this addition.

Loved this recipe. Only small change was using one garlic clove instead of two. Even so it was plenty garlicky and we LOVE the taste of garlic. I think two is overkill.

I've made this recipe so many times and with so many different variations, I can't even count. I usually leave out the garlic, because it tends to overwhelm, in my opinion, but I'd throw in feta cheese or chopped eggplant, or roasted red peppers, chopped endive, or whatever else I had on hand. And I never worry about letting the pasta cool all the way -- just run it through with cold water, and it's fine. Enjoy!

We really like this one. Very versitile. Didn't have basil on hand, but still was very good. Be careful not to overdo the radicchio (the bitterness will overwhelm). I agree with an earlier review, that the addition parmesan cheese doesn't seem really necessary (although I might try another reviewer's recommendation and use Romano). I also had a problem with the garlic seeming bitter (and we are huge garlic fans). I'm going to try adding it earlier and see what happens. Also, I'll add a few more tomatoes next time, and perhaps a few more pine nuts. Yum.

This was delicious as a make-ahead side dish for a barbeque. I think that putting in the garlic at the end tends to make it a little bitter, though. I can see the potential for endless variation!

This is an easy, yummy side dish. I used riso pasta as I could not find orzo. I omitted the radicchio and it was not missed.

I've made this a few times (and usually double the recipe since my sister manages to eat about 4 helpings) - everyone thinks it's great. I add grilled chicken (chopped on the board with sun-dried tomato oil) and halve the oil and vinegar. Yummy.

Wonderful recipe! The flavors blend perfectly. I had to make it the night before a party and the only thing I wouldn't do again is chop the radicchio and basil the night before...they got a little mushy but the flavors were still the same when I added them the next day! Everyone at the party asked for the recipe.

My local grocery store didn't have radicchio, so I made it without. It was wonderful. I brought it to a party and everyone loved it.

This is a fabulous recipe. I use a little less oil and it tastes just as great. Everyone who tries it loves it! It goes with everything and other than a lot of chopping it's very easy. Tip: buy pitted olives and sundried tomatoes that are already chopped.

I have made this recipe many times - for potlucks, lunch meetings, you name it. One trick I like is to return the orzo to the pot (no heat) after it has drained, adding the olives, sundried tomatoes, garlic and dressing. This helps all the flavors blend really nicely. One of my favorites!

I made this recipe for a summer bbq. I served it with Fried Turkey. It was absolutely delicious! I doubled recipe -included all ingredients but added tripled the garlic(make sure minced fine). Everyone loved it. Very colorful. Next day it was even tastier. Unfortunately, I only had one serving left.

I have made this orzo several times this summer and each time it has received rave reviews. I made a few changes, I cut the radicchio in half and did not add the parmesan cheese. I didn't think it needed the cheese. I have also made it without the garlic and its been great. I don't like sun-dried tomatoes in oil because they often have herbs in them as well. So I used the dried tomatoes and rehydrated them in some of the dressing.

I have made this over and over...nothing but grand reviews from everyone! Even from my husband, who is mister meat and potatoes!!! Enjoy!

I left out the olives and radicchio, used grape tomatoes instead of sun-dried and used less oil than called for. I also had a cucumber on hand and added that. I had no left-overs from our BBQ. Next time I am going to leave out the parm cheese and pine nuts and add only tomatoes and cucumbers, I think it would be more healty that way.

Rating: 4
I have made this twice and the second time, I substituted fresh lemon juice for the balsamic vinegar and think the taste is superior. Also added some fresh rosemary since I didn't have basil on hand. For all those watching fat, I used only 1 TB olive oil in the whole thing and didn't sacrifice any flavor! also threw in some diced zucchini sauted in garlic and hot pepper flakes. Go crazy with this recipe it is orzo with EVERYTHING after all.

I have made it for cocktail parties and it is always a hit! I have added cherry or grape tomatoes for added dimension.

This recipe is quite easy and fast! I took out the radicchio, and added halved grape tomatoes, plus I also added powdered garlic. I also used Romano cheese instead, to add more flavor. My meat-and-pototato in-law family loved it, and has begged for the recipe. Great for cookouts!

I read the reviews here prior to making. My philosophy on cooking is you must adapt everything in order to make the dish your own. I did half balsamic vinegar and half sherry. Made a nice vinegrette. Added capers, roasted red peppers, feta cheese w/ tomato & basil, artichoke hearts (don't think this added anything), fresh chopped parsley, pepperconi, capers (loved these!) and asparagus. This salad would have needed more color from the original hence why I added the green aspargus (perfect for Spring/Summer!), but broccoli or zucchini would have worked too. Would have done the mushrooms as suggested but thought this would be too much and the color wouldn't work too well. I also marinated everything together to help the flavors meld. A couple hours is good, but overnight is even better. This dish made a lot especially when I served it on a bed of mixed greens. It was a big hit at the picnic I attended. Didn't take too much work either.

Rating: 4
Yes, here's another rave review. I agree that it's much better the next day or at least several hours after making it. I usually mix it completely ahead of time although reserving the radicchio for the last minute so it doesn't get too droopy. I often have to forgo the basil and find that it's still delicious.

Rating: 2
I had high expectations based on the four fork reviews. Followed the recipe to a T, but the result was dark and gloomy (from the balsamic), with an overwelming flavor of sundried tomatoes. The next day however, I guess the flavors mellowed a bit, because it tasted much better. Next time, I think I will used champagne vinegar to lighten up the color, and I will make a day in advance to allow for flavor mellowing.

We have loved this recipe so much that I have made it 3 times in 2 weeks. The last time we added cappers, it was delicious.

This is one of my favorite NO FAIL recipes. I started making a year ago for my Chirstmas party and it was a huge hit. I made throughout the summer for BBQs and made again this year for my Christmas party - but with a change: Subbed tortellini for the orzo and replaced the olives with marinated grilled portabella mushrooms: AMAZING. There was NONE left. I will continue to make both versions...and will always error on the side of excess when it comes to all the yummy ingredients.

This dish was absolutely fabulous! I have served it with roast beef, baked chicken, and roast pork. All were terrific. My Christmas party guests were blown away-everyone wanted the recipe.

This recipe is absolutely fablous. My family is addicted to it-I can't make it often enough. There is something about the very Italian flavours combined with the slippery texture of the orzo that lifts the whole package to a higher level. My suggestion to someone making this recipe for the first time is to use the orzo and not substitute a different pasta. I use sundried tomatoes that have not been packed in oil (simply rehydrate in hot water)with no comprimise of flavour. Plus, I feel the parmesan cheese is not necessary. Try this recipe, you'll love it!!

Absolutely delicious! Couldn't quit eating it. The melange of flavors is fascinating and very intriguing. Really, really love this recipe.

Wonderful flavor. Very pretty. I doubled it for a pot lock at work. Everyone went back for seconds & thirds. Even during dessert, they took another helping of the salad. I did the first stage the night before. When mostly cooled I mixed the garlic in a little olive oil and added it early (to give it time to blend & mellow). Next day I did the rest of the second stage just prior to serving. I rougly chopped most of the pinenuts so they would stick to the pasta & fork (otherwise they end up left behind on the plate). Unlike one reviewer, my pasta did not turn too brown from the balsamic, it turned an attractive autumny color that complemented the other colors perfectly. This would also be beautiful in small lettuce leaf cups as an appetizer.

While it sounds promising, this recipe is not worth the trouble.

Surprisingly delicious. I could not get decent radiccio the day I made this, so I substitued red cabbage - I had my doubts about this, but it provided the necessary color and crunch. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I may try it with red wine vinegar next time only because the balsamic turns the orzo brown and I would prefer it lighter. Make sure that your audience likes fresh garlic. I may try adding the garlic to the hot orzo mixture to tone it down a notch, only for my faint-hearted guests.

With all the four forks ratings, I thought this dish was a sure thing. I was quite disappointed. I liked it well enough, however I think another totally different recipe on Gourmet (hearts of palm with beets and blue cheese) is a far more memorable salad than this one.

My wife and I both love this recipe. It's fairly easy to make, although cutting the olives and other ingredients has convinced me I need an electric chopper (the food processor is just too big and unwieldy). This dish makes a great side to almost any grilled summer dish.

A very good pasta salad recipe. It leaves a fabulous garlic taste in your mouth that keeps you wanting more. I added a little more of everything -- garlic & balsamic vinegar especially. Radicchio wasn't available so I added red cabbage -- it added a nice crunch. Like other reviewers, I made the whole thing ahead of time. I don't feel that it suffered.
