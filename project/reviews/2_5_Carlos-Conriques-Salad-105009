I made this dish a few years ago for a Cinco de Mayo celebration I had. Everyone loved it. I am making it again this weekend for a party. I think the dressing had a nice citrus flavor.

I made it on a very hot day and my guests loved it. I didn't have passion fruit because it is very hard to get here, so I substituted it with orange juice and only put half the sugar.
