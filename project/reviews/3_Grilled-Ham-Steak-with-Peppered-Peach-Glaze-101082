This is a superb fast meal along with home fries a fried eggs. I have made it numerous times.

Just another meal. Try Ham over Creamed Spinach or Ham and Peach Kabobs, they'e better.

This recipe is quite good as-is. I've also varied it by using the glaze ingredients (minus the preserves) added to canned peaches in syrup. Thicken a bit with a water-cornstarch mixture and spoon over ham as a sauce.

Very good and very simple. If you can, use a salty country type ham, not the commercial ones which are too sweet with the sauce.
