I enjoyed this dish very much. I appreciate how quickly it comes together; it will be a weeknight dinner option from now on. I used boneless skinless chicken breast, and some thyme and ground sage (didn't have herbes de provencal). Also used those mini peppers, which I think made this tastier, and a medium-bodied red wine, which I also think boosted the flavor. Sprinkled a little feta on the finished product, and served it on whole wheat couscous

I used the dried salad herbs(that's what I had) and found just one teaspoon to be plenty.

I found this dish easy to prepare and it was very tender but unfortunately not very tasty. I liked it but would probably find another chicken recipe before I made this one again.

We liked this dish a lot, especially my wife. I would reducing the sauce longer than the minute recommended in the recipe. It had a little too heavy wine taste for me.

Loved it. So easy to make yet full of flavor. But 3 cups of bell pepper seemed like a lot. So, I decreased to 1 large bell peper and it came out perfect.
