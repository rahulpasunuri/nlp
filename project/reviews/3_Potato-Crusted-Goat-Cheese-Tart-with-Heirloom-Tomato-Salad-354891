The potato crusting was a great concept and worked well, but the effort was not worth the results. The goat's-milk bechmel sauce was too little to make a difference. The onions overpowered everything. The suggested cheese amounts were, likewise, too skimpy. I may have liked it if I had skimped on the onions, added substntially more bechmel sauce and cheese. But the proportions per the instructions were out of wack. Oh, the heirloom tomatoes saved the meal; they were an excellant accompaniment.

I've made it twice and loved it. Wouldn't change a thing. Gluten-free goodness is a bonus feature.
