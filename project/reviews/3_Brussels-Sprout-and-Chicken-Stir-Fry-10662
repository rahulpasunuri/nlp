As others said, this is bland.

OK...it was as promised...fresh, easy to make and good for you, but I just didn't think it tasted great...My husband loved it, which is the reason for the three stars..my teenager would not eat the brussel sprouts. I will keep looking for the ultimate stir fry.

I think this recipe is great! I use brocolli instead of brussels sprouts and add a few more spices, but overall a great quick meal! My roommate loves it.

Thought this was a bit boring and bland. Had to add additional seasonings and spices to make it work.

This was good- not too quick, but worth it. The brussel sprouts were a huge part of the dish (I only used 1 pint). I used red and yellow peppers and it was an attractive dish. Added crushed red pepper also.

As a quick dinner, this recipe hits the spot! Added straw mushrooms and bamboo shoots and they complemented the other ingredients well

This was a great recipe. We substituted fresh asparagus for the brussels sprouts and served it over rice.
