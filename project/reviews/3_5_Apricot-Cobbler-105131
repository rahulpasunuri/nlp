I agree with the reviewer who said to peel the apricots; the few peels I missed were indeed very tart. I thought the topping bland, too. More sugar perhaps?

This recipe was good but I agree that the cobbler needed more sugar. I used brown sugar and doubled the 7 tsp. and still it could have used just a little more... also didn't want the bready topping so I made a crumb topping...1 cup of flour...1 cup brown sugar and 3 TB of butter. Turned out really good.

I've made this cobbler several times over the years, and discovered early on that you have to PEEL THE APRICOTS! If you leave the skins on, for some reason, the cobbler will turn out so tart it will make the sides of your mouth hurt. If you peel them first, it comes out perfectly sweetened with the original amount of sugar. The biscuit topping is wonderful and looks especially nice when sprinkled with turbinado sugar before going in the oven. I never have buttermilk on hand, so I substitute clabbered milk: 1 tsp lemon juice for every 1/4 cup warm milk. In this case, you use 2 tsp lemon juice and 1/2 cup milk. Mix the two together in a non-reactive (i.e. glass or plastic) cup and let it sit for 5 min. It'll get thick and curdled and can be used in place of the buttermilk. If you don't have any lemon juice on hand, apple cider vinegar or white vinegar will work just as well.

I have made this cobbler for our guests last night. They loved it! One of the comments was "this tastes like something you would get at a fancy restaurant" I have made a few changes. First of all I doubled the recipe since we were going to be 7 - and we had plenty of leftovers. In the filling I added ~1 pint of blueberries - they really added to the color. One of the guests have commented that it also added to the taste. After reading previous reviews, I upped the sugar (I used all of the sugar that is in the topping list in the mix, and added dark brown sugar on the top for browning, less ~3 tablespoons for double recipe). Instead of almond extract I used medium Sherry (1 tablespoon) and instead of buttermilk, I had to make sourmilk with milk and lemon juice. The apricots were from our tree in the backyard and most of them were ripe - the cobbler was just right a little tart but perfect with vanilla ice cream on the side. I will definitely make this again, it is delicious and perfect use for our apricots.

Great recipe and quick and easy. Added scraped vanilla bean seeds into the apricot mixture. Huge hit at my neighborhood block party!

This is a great bisuit cobbler. Not too sweet.

Thanks to the previous reviewers for their tips! I also added quite a bit of extra fruit (lots of ripe apricots, a large, sweet mango and blueberries). Because so many people said the cobbler bubbled over, I split mine into two pie pans, and didn't have any problems. I used only the recommended amount of sugar, worried that it would be too much, and the cobbler still turned out pretty tart. This was surprising since the apricots were not tart to begin with. I would prefer to use less sugar to deal with the tartness. Any ideas from others? I may use some wildflower honey next time. We topped the cobbler with vanilla soy dream, and it was delicious!

Thank you to previous reviewer who forewarned about dripping; you saved me having to clean the oven! Recipe was fine as is, maybe more sugar. Served alone, it's fine; it would benefit from ice cream (what wouldn't?)

Thank you to the reviewer who forewarned me about the spillover; cookie sheets saved a messy oven. I made the recipe as is and liked it, as did my husband, although we both agreed it would benefit from some a la mode, probably vanilla.

This has become my standard cobbler recipe and I've used it with blackberries and blueberries. This is a favorite mostly because it's not too sweet and the fruit really shines through.

I guess I'm not fond of cobblers, I prefer a crisp, a sweeter and more buttery top. The dough tasted simply bread-like. I think served with whipped cream or ice cream would help. Since we have 'cot trees I try many cot recipes each summer.

Up until this year, I stuck to the original recipe and loved it. But this summer I went my own way. Last month, I was so slow at getting to apricots I bought, half went bad. So I rummaged through the fridge, found a couple handfuls of black cherries and tossed them in with the good 'cots. Delicious! Emboldend, I conscripted two pints of blueberries, one mango, lime juice, and orange flower water. No apricots, lemon juice or almond extract. Viola! Scrumptious blueberry-mango cobbler. Planned next, a blackberry, raspberry and peach combo. What a wonderful, versatile recipe.

Delicious and very easy to make. My apricots were not the best quality, but the cooking really enhanced their flavor and texture. I will definitely make it again and will try it with other fruits (nectarines, plums, peaches). I didn't have almond extract, but used vanilla this time. I'd love to try with cinnamon and brown sugar sprinkled over the dough!

I agree with the other reviews that the apricots could be a little too tart, however, I liked the recipe and will just adjust the sugar to the tartness of the apricots the next time I make it.

I thought this was an easy, quick dessert to prepare. Since I decided to make it on the last minute, I made sour milk instead of using buttermilk. Just one thing - for the almond extract, what does 3/4 to 1/4 teaspoon mean? I used 1 teaspoon thinking that the 1 was missing before the 1/4. Also, since the recipe didn't say that the 3 tablespoons of sugar should be divided (in the list of ingredients)all 3 teaspoons went into the dough. I sprinkled the dough with a mixture of sugar and cinnamon before baking. With all of my alterations, it turned out great and I would definitely try it with peaches, or rhubarb/strawberry. It was great!!

The topping just doesn't stand up to the tartness of the filling. And there must be someway to reduce the tartness, other than loading up on the sugar. This one just didn't go over well...

I have never cooked with fresh apricots before. This is an excellent cobbler and very easy. I had to add a little extra sugar to the apricots because they were very tart. I will definitely make again and it will work with any type of fruit so well.

Very simple to prepare and delicious. I upped the sugar by one tablepoon due to the tartness of the fruit I used and added one small slice of fresh minced ginger. Really added another layer to the flavor of the dish. I also had some runover in the oven even though I used a 10" pie pan, so be forewarned that a cookie sheet may useful.

This dessert has so many things going for it. It's easy, low fat, delicious and provides an opportunity to use apricots (which I never seem to use).

With a jump back to winter, a bowl of plums (from California!!) that were inedible, I sure found a great recipe to please everyone coming in for dinner. I just substituted plums for apricots/almond and upped the sugar a little. The tart and sweet flavour blended beautifully with the soft centre and crisp top of the cobbler. Definitely a repeat recipe.

The fillings was overwhelmingly tart - and the fruit I used was *quite* ripe; I don't understand. Might try it again with peaches instead of apricots but my boyfriend suggested that "we needn't revisit this". I think I'd rather look for another recipe altogether, frankly.

I love cobbler, and this is the best cobbler recipe I have ever tasted. The almond extract is a must. Also, this is excellent with peaches too.

this was a great, easy to prepare recipe. i agree that twice the amount of apricot filling would be nice, but some of my family said twice the topping would be better! either way it turned out great. instead sprinkling plain sugar on top, i used turbinado sugar(coarse,raw sugar) which made a crunchy topping. i'll definitely be making this again, maybe with other fruit fillings.

I made an apricot crumble just a week ago and thought I would try something different. This was another great summer dessert, sweet but not too rich. It had a shortcake feel about it...perfect with whipped cream or ice cream! I added a some fresh cherries that I had on hand and cut back on the sugar just a bit. It was wonderful!!!

I used dried apricots cooked on the stovetop for about 20 minutes. This is absolutely delicious and I have all ready made it a second time! My first was for Christmas dinner, it turned out so well I just had to try it a second time. It really is delicious, warm with whipped cream or cold.

Make sure your apricots are ripe, or the cobbler will be extremely tart. My apricots were pretty ripe, and the dessert was too tart even still--vanilla ice cream cut the tartness and made a wonderful contrast. Taste the filling before you bake it, and add some sugar if it's too tart. I liked the biscuit-like topping--you can easily use 2 pounds of fruit w/out needing to make more topping. I used a 9" deep-dish Emile Henry pie plate, and I could have probably used three pounds of fruit w/out needing more topping.

I made this recipe as it was written, with no changes or subsitutions. The topping was sufficient. I didn't care for the almond extract with the apricots, so would either use vanilla or another flavoring instead next time. This recipe also works well with peaches.

Reminder cook time is approx 30 mins. Excellent dish for apricot lovers. Sweetness does not overpower the fruits tart flavor. Keeper!

Thought this was just okay, not wonderful. I used apricots from my tree and added blueberries which made it very colorful. I doubled the topping as suggested by some, but it was too much. If I do it again, I would increase the fruit and make a single topping recipe.

I thought the recipe was excellent. I made it twice already without changing anything. I found the dough to be a very good and flaky cobbler topping (just used it on a peach cobbler). I did not find it "doughy" as some described it.

This cobbler was an easy and tasty way to use the apricots ripened on our tree. I did not double the topping and I liked the way the topping made dumplings on the filling.

I really thought it was going to be good. I was wrong. It was very mediocre at best. The topping didn't seem to be enough so I also, made it double. I thought it was too doughy. It lacked something.

Guests seemed to like it - I doubled the topping (but that was too much). Used 1/2 teasp. of almond extract - if I make it again, I'd use a little less. Also, I'm thinking about making it upside-down.

Dessert is a rare thing in our house, but I've made this recipe twice in the last few weeks. Apricot season is brief in New England grocery stores so we have to take advantage of it while it lasts. Both my husband and I loved this recipe. The apricot-almond combination is wonderful. I reduced the size of the baking dish because the topping was a little skimpy for a 9-inch pan. Note that the sugar in the topping is divided (or ignore that and just add a 2-3 additional teaspoons over the topping before putting it in the oven.

I didn't quite have 1 1/2 lbs. of apricots, so I added a few peaches and nectarines. It was wonderful. I would use less sugar next time also. I agree with the previous cook - it is not a huge dessert, so don't count on feeding more than 4 with it. I was thinking I might add more like 2 or more pounds of fruit next time and see if it would work. Definitely increase the cooking time to at least 35, if not 40 minutes.

The baking time ( in myexperience - have made it twice ) is about 35 min. It is not a big dish. I made this for a bookclub and everybody loved it. If you do not like tart tastes too much add a little more sugar and almond to the filling. Also make sure that the biscuit filling is not too dry. I will try this with peaces and nectarines in the summer. Put some slivered almonds on top.

This sounds like a great recipe. However, I have been unable to get really good ripe apricots in Minnesota. They are always so hard. Has anyone tried this with canned fruit or frozen? Although I'm not sure I've ever seen frozen apricots. I'm thinking canned would be too mushy. Hmmmm... perhaps I'll have to go mail order!

Fortunately, I have this month's issue of Gourmet. The missing information reads as follows: "Bake cobbler in middle of oven until fruit is tender and topping is golden, about 30 minutes. Cool slightly, about 15 minutes, and serve warm." Nutritional information reads: "Each serving about 280 calories and 4 grams of fat." Can't wait to try it !

It seems that the baking time is 50 minutes.. The receipe says that the active time is 40 min (which includes the 30 min. to let the cobbler stand and probably 10 minutes to mix the ingredients). From Start to finish is 1 1/2 hr, or 90 minutes. 90-40=50. So, all in all, it will bake for 50 min. Happy baking. :)

I'm assuming the active time of 40 minutes (at the top, next to total prep time) is the cooking time. Hope this helps...I also would like to try this recipe!!

This is a perfect summer dessert, easy and quick to make. It serves four generously. I have made it twice while apricots are at their perfection and will make it again for Sunday dinner, to follow pork tenderloin salad and ciabatta. I pass heavy cream to pour. Serve it barely warm.
