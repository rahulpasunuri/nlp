Delicious, simple alternative to the heavier hot cheesy artichoke dip you'd find in restaurants. Enjoy with a variety of fresh veggies!

What a great, easy recipe. I brought this to a party last weekend and it was eaten quickly. The vegans were appreciative of the non-dairy appetizer. I appreciate an easy and inexpensive thing to make for potlucks over the summer. I didn't have fennel so I made pita chips.

Great healthy dip! Made for a party last night and everyone loved it. I doubled the recipe but used a bit less olive oil and a tiny bit of Parmesan. I had planned on adding lemon, as suggested by others, but forgot. I don't think it was needed. Made ahead as directed. Was definitely better the 2nd day. Served with fennel, red pepper and asparagus. May whip in some goat cheese next time and serve with toast. Great recipe

This recipe is so easy and a big hit. I serve with all kinds of fresh, raw veggies - red and yellow peppers, cucumber, carrots,anything really. We also serve with pita chips and it is good to go. A big (and healthy) hit. I also make for the kids for an afterschool snack and they love it.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dip with some fennel strips and also toasted baguette slices. I cut the olive oil by half, but otherwise made the recipe as stated except added a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. My husband was pleasantly surprised that there was no dairy in the dip. I will make this again, but serve with crackers and fennel strips.

Winning recipe due to winning ingredients!. Healthy too!! Only had 1/2 parsley and will use smaller clove garlic next time, ...and served with whole grain pita crisps, yum - all was a hit w/book club, and will try w/fennel sometime, tho pita crisps were really great w/it.

I thought this deserves 2 forks which is "good" not "delicious." I followed the suggestions to cut back on the oil, add fresh basil and crushed red pepper flakes, and I made it the day before serving to improve the flavor. But it was not distinctive or fabulous, even after adding a few more olives.

Nice. Added other vegetables to the crudite platter, but the fennel strips made this dip a taste sensation.

I've been making this for years, I'm surprised I've never reviewed it. My family routinely requests this dip at parties and holidays. Someone always asks for the recipe, and people are always shocked to learn there is no dairy in it, and that it's even relatively healthy.

I have made this several times. The fennel strips make this recipe. Very easy. Everyone loves. I decrease the oil by about half, use two cans of artichokes,add fresh basil, crushed red pepper & about 1/8 c. parm. Always make one day ahead.

Easy, excellent dip; I serve with bread or crackers instead of fennel strips. Very important to allow time for this to sit and flavors to develop. A squeeze of lemon is good too.

I decided to test this recipe with a group of friends last night before serving it for a large party. Everyone found it very interesting, but I got to take a lot of it home! I liked it a lot, and will make it for the appetizer table at my next party, but I will change it as follows: I will use pitted green or kalamata olives to skip the time- consuming pitting, I will add a little basil and some pine nuts with the parsley, and most importantly, I will serve it with toast rounds or crostini--too many people dislike fennel and I didn't think the dip added much to the other veggies I used with the fennel, but it's absolutely delicious on crackers!

I was really taken with this, especially as a spread on my new favorite bread (the legendary no-knead recipe from the NY Times; Google it!). I'll make it again and again... and can't wait to show it off at a party!

The people who rated this recipe poorly must not have made the dip correctly...this dip with crudites is EXCEPTIONAL -- and all my guests agree. I typically do not like fennel, but it is a MUST in this recipe. The combination of ingredients are genius. Perfect flavors. I also use my cuisinart/blender, and it is very easy. The most time intensive part is pitting the picholine olives. I did it by hand in the past...I bought an olive pitter for the next time...so i'll have to see how it goes.

This dip is truly disgusting. When its finished chilling all you can taste is overpowering salt from the olives and the foul aftertaste of waaaay too much olive oil and raw garlic. You can't taste the artichoke hearts at all, which is especially irritating since they are a fairly expensive ingredient. I wish I had heeded the warnings of the previous reviewer who had a bad experience--I, too, had to throw the whole thing out after a series of completely unsuccessful attempts to salvage it.

Rating: 4
I loved this recipe - Such a nice diversion from that gloppy white stuff! I did make a few changes, based on what I had in my pantry & frig....Used pitted Kalamata olives and also added fresh basil along with the fresh parsley. The dip is similar to an olive pesto - very delicious and different - could be spread on other things as well (toasted baguette slices?)

To the last reviewer, why did you even put it in the car to bring to your party, if you didn't care to serve it?

Rating: 1
This was so incredibly sour and salty my husband refused to taste test it a second time. I went ahead and added ground red pepper but that didn't fix it. I added Romano cheese and that didn't do it either. I added lemon juice (counterintuitive to me, but it helped). Finally I tried a little sugar, and that helped too, but ultimately, it was still disgusting. Didn't even bring it out of the car for the party I took it to.

I make the whole thing in the food processor. Puree the artichokes, and then pulse a few times to add the olives (I prefer kalamatas). One bowl, five minutes. Yum.

Made this for a picnic, and it went over really well. Very tasty, and a nice change from dairy/mayo based dips. Just served it with pepper-crusted crackers.

Everyone loved this at my Oscars party!

This was delicious and so easy. I'm glad I read the reviews...one clove of garlic is plenty...for some reason, it was really pungent, and more would have been overkill. I also added a few red pepper flakes which added some depth of flavor. Served it with the fennel and also some homemade pita chips. Try this, it's different and really good.

I love this dip. As low fat as you want, depending on how much olive oil you use. Bonus for not being loaded with dairy, so can be a light beginning to a heavy meal or part of a healthy meal. I've also just used the artichoke puree as a filling for parmesan crisps.

This is a great dip for those who can't have cheese. I've made it several times and people always rave about it. I do a couple of things different than the recipe: I've tried it with spanish olives stuffed with pimentos and without the pimentos. The pimentos add a pretty color, and it tastes very good, but I think the taste is slightly better without the pimentos. And in the interest of time, I press the garlic into the food processor rather than making a paste. The most important thing about this recipe is to make the dip at LEAST 4 hours ahead of time - it is critical to the flavor.

I followed the advice of another reviewer and added half of a serrano pepper and about a third of a cup of parmesan. It was a hit.

Rating: 4
It ain't pretty, but it IS delicious. I added an extra clove of garlic, 1/2 of a small serrano pepper, and 1/8 c parmesan, and I blended the whole thing in my food processor, starting with the garlic and parsley and ending with a pulsing of the olives to keep their texture. Great combination of sweet from the artichokes, salty from the olives, and spice from the garlic and pepper. Excellent with crudites and crackers!

A new favorite, mainly because it is easy, delicious and healthy. I made it with nicoise and kalamata olives from an olive bar, and served it with fennel and red, green and yellow bell peppers. It is very versatile and great to bring to a party.

Fantastic and so healthy. Since I was just having a dinner party for three people, I didn't bother to double, and it still disappeared. No need to hold off on adding the herbs--even after one day they still taste fresh and vibrant.

Delicious! Easy! I made this with diced kalamata olives and used both basil and parsley. After mixing, I put the dip in the fridge with herbs already in. GREAT! Brought it to a party and it was a hit.

Resist the urge to add more garlic, go easy on the added salt, and do make this dip the day before.

I made this as an appetizer for Rosh Hashanah. I doubled the recipe and they still asked for more! Easy and delicious.... you can't go wrong... so much lighter and more flavorful than those mayo heavy dips

was out of parsley so I used the fennel fronds instead. used a huge clove of garlic and it was a bit too garlicky for this garlic lover. added a little romano cheese. like it better with bread than fennel - makes a delicious spread for crostini. would look nice spread on rounds with a sprig of fennel frond on top.

I made this a week ago for a dinner with the girls and have been craving it ever since. I made it again tonight to take to a party tomorrow. I can't wait to get to eat it again! SInce I couldn't find fennel at the store I just used crackers and it was so delicious.

Holy cow, this is delish! I made it the first time for a Christmas party, and it was gobbled up. The second time was last night, when I didn't feel like eating a regular dinner. I whipped it up in about 2 minutes and ate it with tortilla chips (ok, I let my husband have some, too). Frankly, I could just eat the artichoke/olive oil puree on its own--it's pure ambrosia. I've already added this to my binder of favorite recipes, though you don't really even need the recipe once you've made it a few times.

I used just regular green olives. The dip was good, but it's very garlicy. My family likes garlic, so it was OK for us, but may be too strong for others.

I'm amazed. It's Thanksgiving eve and I've spent the afternoon preparing the appetizers for tommorow (my share of the meal year after year). I always like to include some kind of crudites and dip as I personnaly am not fond of the traditional T-day meal and miss not having salad and vegetables to my liking for the meal. In under ten minutes, with ingredients I had on hand (regular old pimiento stuffed green olives, though)I just made something that is one of the tastiest things I've put together today. Unfortunately I don't have another can of artichoke hearts because I'd make another batch for the furniture moving party tonight!

This was a huge hit at our christmas eve party. I used pimento stuffed olives cuz i couldn't find the others. We had fresh oysters and shrimp so you know it had to be good for anyone to notice. Served with Panetini-a toast found in the cracker section. Downloaded the recipe for several guests and was so thankful for all those who take the time to rate these recipes. Thanks to you all.

I love this dip and plan on serving it at my Christmas party again this year. I always use black olives instead of the green, I like the contrast in color. I serve it with toasted lavash strips (faster than pitas) and fennel. I think it's nice to put it out with the fennel, it doesn't get as many takers as the pitas but it's different than your usual crudities.

This was delicious and easy to make. I made it the day before serving and it flavoured beautifully. I served it with fennel, mini pitas and also some red and yellow cherry tomatoes to add some colour to the serving platter. For Canadians familiar with Loblaws, I also served some of the President Choice Rosemary Flavoured and Black Pepper Flavoured Old Fashioned Chips on the side. Yummy!!!

This is a delicious and different nibbly. I added fresh lemon juice, which brightened it up a lot and offset the garlic and salt. The fennel is perfect, but it will also taste great with endive. Go easy on the salt until after the olives are in.

Excellent!! Easy, and absolutely delicious. I served this with fennel and the parmesan pita crisps as suggested by another reviewer. I added a little less garlic than called for (we're not big garlic people). Make sure you make alot of this, it goes fast!

This recipe is awesome! I have never used the crudites and I usually add a clove or two (depending on size) of extra garlic. I have made this for at least a couple of years now. It has become a family favorite and is now a requirement at any gathering. This does go fast, so it is smart to double the recipe.

We served this dip at a big christmas party and it was the first thing to disappear. Everyone was raving and asking for the recipe. We couldn't find fennel, so we served it with the parmesan pita crisps(recipe on this site) and that went over really well. I'd suggest doubling the recipe as the amount we made was gone in less than an hour easily.

My friends demand that I bring this dip to pot lucks. I put it on the table ... it disappears, with only the fennel crudites remaining. In other words, the dip is great with breads and veggies and anything else you can think of, but only one in four hundred people likes fennel.

Wow! One of my favorites. Love artichoke dip but this one really has a lot of zip (because of the strong garlic) and less fat than other recipes I have made. Delicious with fennel crudites or with pita toasts.

Especially good because no mayo is required. I used regular green olives with pimento stuffing since I couldn't find type specified in recipe. Also used baked tortilla chips instead of fennel (don't like licorice flavor)
