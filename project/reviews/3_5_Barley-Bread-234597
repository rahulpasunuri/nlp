This makes a nice soft loaf with good flavor. I made 1/2 the recipe into 1 round loaf. I also made a few substitutions: I used white whole wheat instead of semolina, and 1/2 tbl onion flakes + 1 tsp poppy seed for the nigella. I also used bread flour instead of all-purpose. Baked 20 min @ 375, on cookie sheet.

I love barley...it's a big alternative to a oatmeal bread.
