This recipe made with chocolate does not make enough batter for a 10" spring form pan. It might work with the fruit or maybe a smaller pan. But be forewarned, with a 10" pan and the chocolate you end up with something like an over baked pancake.

This cake is similar to German Plaumenkuchen, almost as much fruit as cake, with juice permeating some of the cake. It's not a typical lofty American cake. Personally, I much prefer this kind of dessert. Made the cake pretty much just as written, but used 2 cups of fruit (fresh cherries). We loved the hint of balsamic and the olive oil taste, which was not strong at all. Very important to beat the egg and sugar to the ribbon stage for good rising and texture. I didn't sift the flour, which was a mistake. Cake flour is so fine, really does need sifting. Served it with tart frozen yogurt and my guests liked it very much. Heated the leftover bit in the oven next day and it was still quite good. Next time I think I'll use peaches.

I baked this cake in a cast iron skillet (Southern me) after using a bit more olive oil and flour to prepare it. Used fresh blackberries for the fruit. It was delicious, not too sweet and very tender. Baked it for 50 minutes. Overall very pleased and will make it again using whatever fruit I have.

Followed the recipe as is. Used peaches (6 small ones  very ripe). As recommended by mmm mmm from NY, baked it in a fluted tart pan with removable sides, so the crust has a scalloped edge. Bake exactly 50 minutes. Perfect light cake. I guess you have to really beat the egg-sugar mix to make sure the batter is fluffy. I just brushed some warm fig jam to the fruit on top to give them a nice shine. Thats it.

I made this cake for a party at work and i was embarrassed by it. It is thin - and I used double the amount of peaches in the recipe. And the cake tastes awful. The virgin olive oil gives the cake a strong olive flavor. I like virgin olive oil but it does not belong in this cake. I don't understand the rave reviews. It is NOT a good cake. Butter or even a bland vegetable oil would make the cake so much better. Also, more cake batter for the given pan size would help. I gave it one fork because zero forks did not seem to be an available choice.

i must admit i made this cake mainly because of its alluring name and the fact that a friend had more pastry flour than she knew what to do with...but i was thrilled with the results. the cake had a wonderful moist center and a fabulous crust. the olive oil adds a great savory undertone. i can't wait to make this cake again! i used mango (from the tree in my yard!) in addition to peaches and cherries and i forgot to put the additional sugar on top. i used vanilla soymilk instead of regular milk and pomegranate balsamic vinegar. yum!!!!!

Anarchy is right. Anarchy against all known definitions - be they broad or be they narrow - of the word "cake"! I delicately folded the ingredients together and within seconds, they bound in to a shockingly small glob. A glob which I was unable to "pour" out of the bowl. I recounted all the steps and I didn't miss anything. Anyway, I tried to spread the concrete-like result into my springform and after a few minutes, gave up. There wasn't enough batter and what was there was far too stiff. After 40 minutes, I took out a big biscuit with fruit stuck on it. Flavour was nice but it looked like an escapee from a remedial home ec class. Maybe I'll try it again but I am not sure what I could do different the next time.

Thank God for Epicurious and your commenters!! Reading all the comments let me really take liberties with this recipe and it was terrific! I didnt have enough extra virgin olive oil, so I used half e.v. and half "store-brand". I had promised chocolate in my dessert but really wanted to use the wonderful fresh peaches on my counter, so I made the cake in a flan pan with semi-sweet chocolate pieces (which I added to my dry ingredients before I folded them into the egg mixture)and baked it for 35 minutes. Just before serving the cake I piled pealed peaches mixed with raspberries on the top of the cake. Wow!! Brilliant!! So many compliments! The one problem I encountered was my fault. I didnt use the parchment paper as recommended and, while the sides came out easily, the chocolate stuck to the flat/top part of the pan. USE THE PARCHMENT, especially if youre using chocolate.

I used half olive oil and half vegetable oil and the olive oil flavor was still incredibly, and unpleasantly strong. Perhaps it was the olive oil that I used, but I would not bother making it again. I actually threw most of this out.

Wow! This cake is brilliant! Really, I can't imagine how you could mess it up or claim that you don't have the ingredients to make dessert because you could use just about anything in this cake. I didn't have superfine sugar, my peaches and plums were hard and sour, and I substituted vanilla for the balsamic vinegar. The result was delicious and even my picky son (the reason for the vanilla substitution) thought it was good enough to have 2 pieces.

My favorite go-to dessert recipe! I bake it in a fluted tart pan with removable sides, so the crust has a scalloped edge...people are impressed by how it looks when I fan the fruit around the pan and assume it's difficult to make!! BEST efforts so far are: peaches with almonds, berries, and pear. Usually I sub vanilla or almond extract for balsamic vinegar and sometimes butter for olive oil. WORST effort: I tried chopped chocolate with orange instead of lemon zest. Flavor was good but lackluster result overall. 4 oz is way too much chocolate and choc was drier than fruit, so the rest of the tart was not moist. Bittersweet choc was not sweet enough. Will absolutely try again.

I doubled the recipe with 4 cups of fruit instead of 3 and added vanilla. Totally easy and yummy.

This is the most delicious, simple ingredient cake I've ever made. And the best part; no butter. It's a new favorite in our house.

Fantastic! Every bit as good as the reviews promised. I made 1 1/2 times the recipe in a 9" springform pan in order to serve 8 people. I cooked it 50 minutes and it was perfectly done. I used strawberries as I thought they worked best with the balsamic vinegar. Served with sweetened whipped cream.

Surprisingly flavorful cake, I will make this again and again with many and varied toppings. Strawberries with a little lightly sweetened whipped cream was a highly acclaimed first version.

I've made this cake many times now, with all sorts of stone fruits, and it has even worked well with blueberries! It's so easy and tasty. Can't wait to try it in the winter with chocolate!

well, for it to really be an anarchy cake, it would have to be vegan... that said, i made a vegan version of this cake, and it was delicious. i used plums and made a sauce to go on top with some dark chocolate, soymilk, cinnamon, and cloves.

I made this cake with fresh peaches from the community garden. We finished it in less than 12 hours. Ever since, I have been driven to the point of distraction by memories of the cake. So I made it again tonight, less than a week since the first, to take to the garden potluck. Then I hid it in my car so I wouldn't have to share. A few notes. DEFINITELY reduce the cooking time. I took mine out at 40 minutes; it would have been charred at 50. Worked great with ap flour and orange zest, since I didn't have cake flour or lemons. Also, I just used a regular cake pan rather than a springform pan. I'm really not sure what the point of the springform is, since this cake does not stick to the sides at all.

I made this cake with strawberries. My son was not interested, but my husband ate it like there was no tomorrow. And, it didn't last more than a day at my house! It was not exactly what I expected, more like a fruit tart than a cake. But, it was really tasty and a refreshing change of pace.

I was ok. Made it with pears and it was very beautiful. Nice crumb for an informal cake. Makes a nice tea cake. Doubled it and baked in a springform pan because reviewers said it came out very thin. Needed extra time in the oven, though. However, my husband and I both thought there was something weird about the flavor. Could have been the balsamic (I used a good kind, too.). Maybe the balsamic flavor would be complemented better by a more acidic fruit, like strawberries?

I followed the recipe using a spring pan. I used drained canned pineapple and plumbs. Wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Yes, made this cake last night with very ripe plums. Will use more firm fruit next time. Three people, nothing left for breakfast. It was that good. Not too sweet, as i like it, with a very nice crumb.

How simple can it get! I made this with currants, and a little candied lemon rind, as I didn't have much in the house. I used a 9" springform, based on the previous reviews, and it's just fine. The finished torte is about 1" high, with a lovely crumb and a beautiful golden crunch to the edges. I'll definitely make this again: peaches or some other summer stone fruit would be heavenly.

I have made this cake at least 20 times, and it is always successful. I've used a variety of fruits, such as pears, plums, raspberries, blueberries, nectarines, etc. The only change I made was to use half olive oil and half canola oil. Don't pass up this recipe!

Made this last night for the first time, and it turned out nicely. I used a sliced granny smith apple and some bittersweet chocolate, but I think it would have been better with just fruit; the chocolate was a little overpowering. It's so simple that I think I'm going to try it again tonight with some left-over fruit salad that I made last week. It's seen better days as is, so I'll put it to use here. My boyfriend thinks that this will be gross, due to the presence of citrus fruits, but I think it might work. And since this takes no time and no fancy ingredients, it's worth a shot!

This cake has become a dinner-party staple at my house. I just use whatever fruit I have on hand; the recipe easily accomodates spices such as ginger or nutmeg easily suit the occasion. Easy and delicious- what more can you ask for?

Simple, fast, tasty, amenible to adaptation - everything I look for in a favorite! Super good with ice cream. The nearly pancake-like thickness could stand for improvement. I'll try smaller pan next time.

The olive oil and basalmic vinegar make this cake a favourite of mine. I throw whatever soft fruit I might have (like strawberries or peaches) in and it always comes out great.

Mine turned out quite soggy, however I did sub spelt flour for regular, and brown sugar for white, and also used quite a few peaches. Some imes my substitutions don't work. Maybe I'll try it again sometime if I evenr have white flour, which is ulikely.

Ok, so I took the word Anarchy literally. First I used a 9 x 3in tall cake pan. Then I doubled the recipe, but not the fruit. Then just for excitement I accidentally put in 1C of milk instead of 1/2C. I added an extra 3/4C of flour and hoped for the best. I sprinkled sugar on the bottom of the pan and put in peaches in a circle. I also sprinkled sugar on what would be the bottom when I realized my milk mistake. It was delish!

This cake is delicious and has a delicious outer layer. I used chocolate and plums and had the perfect contrasting effect of tart and sweet. Although, next time I may use a smaller pan.

This cake takes minimal effort to make and is absolutely delicious. I added raspberries and strawberries to the whole of the cake and sprinkled chocolate chunks all around the edge, which sunk in and made the crust very tasty.

I have made this cake in multiple variations many times and each one was very tasty. I learned that the lemon peel is very important to the cake; the first few times I made this cake, I left out the peel and there was a distinct taste of the oil. The lemon peel disguises it well.

I have been making this cake for a couple of years now and usually use sliced pears and some chocolate chips on top. Today I made it with blueberries and it was just as good. It is one of the best light tasting cakes I have ever made and so easy.

good texture and flavor......so good to find a "cupboards are bare" recipe, because mine were.

Delicious, as most reviewers testify! My only problem is that you get so little cake...10" across and half an inch high. If the cake would last so long (it's mostly gone, half an hour after it came out of the oven) I think it would turn mushy, as another reviewer said. I don't think I will make this again, though, because I like more cake for my efforts.

Easy and delicious. Devoured in one sitting between 2 people! I used 3 black plums and it was quite a lot, making almost three layers of fruit, caramelised and juicy. I also used fine light brown sugar with no problems. Cake rose nicely in between the fruit. Will try next time with peaches and maybe tangerine segments.

Oh, this cake is heavenly! I fudged everything--regular sugar, all-purpose flour, apple cider vinegar. I also used frozen strawberries & blueberries and half a banana. But it ended up perfectly and I had to stop myself from eating the whole thing! one thing--it only needed to cook for 40 minutes or so, not 50.

I came across this recipe in Fran McCullough's The Best American Recipes. A nice, not overly sweet cake that whips up together very easily--very good for impromptu tea- or coffee-time. I didn't have any suitable fresh fruit so I substituted dried fruit, reconstituted in boiling water for 20 minutes; and used 1/4 tsp lemon oil instead of zest. Came out nicely. A good recipe when you don't feel like going to the store to buy ingredients.

I will not be making this cake again. Given all the positive reviews, I guess I was expecting something spectacular. The sliced fruit (peaches) ended up sinking to the bottom, and I ended up with fruit mush rather than a cake. Ended up throwing this one out, as no one wanted to eat it. : (

I thought I messed this one up because I didn't read the directions carefully. I missed the part that tells you to beat until light & fluffy for possibly 5 minutes. It was already in the oven. I I used strawberries which I wasn't too sure about either. I didn't have parchment paper so I just oiled the pan and wrapped the outside with foil to be sure it wouldn't leak. It was done in 40 minutes and to my pleasant surprise it turned out fine and tasted delicious. Easy and good this is a keeper.

I used normal sugar and all-purpose flour, and for the fruit I used mostly (frozen) blackberries with a plum and half an apple thrown in. The result was fabulous! Very Euro-looking.

This cake/torte totally exceeded my expectations. I used several fruits and much more than called for (true to the anarchist form), adding a banana and an asian pair to four small pluots (an apricot/plum fruit), making about 2 1/2 cups of fruit. I used cake flour, and stuck to the rest of the recipe. It came out beautifully ITALIAN looking, and delicious. Not too sweet but very flavorful, with the cake bubbling up around the fruit which gives it a torte like look. I'll make this again and again. Powdered sugar on top makes this little baby party worthy, for sure.
