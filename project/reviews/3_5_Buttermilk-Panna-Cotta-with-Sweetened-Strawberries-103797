Sooo good. I've made goat milk panna cotta, and panna cotta with just cream, and this is by far the tastiest. I agree that you need to up the amount of gelatin as it is a bit soft, but still delicious.

This was a delicious recipe. But I agree that the amount for gelatin was insufficient. My panna cotta was a little too soft.

Consistant, nicely textured panna cotta

I'd like to respond to the cook who asked about making panna cotta with agar agar instead of gelatin. After MANY attempts at this, I finally got the amounts right (first few attempts resulted in hockey puck texture!). In place of the gelatin, use just under a teaspoon agar powder. Whisk it with all the other (cold) ingredients in a pot, allow it to dissolve for 10 minutes, bring to a boil while stirring occasionally, pour immediately into ramekins. Allow it to cool at room temp for about 10 minutes then refrigerate. Will set completely within a half hour. Silky smooth and delicious!

This dessert was attractive as well as delicious. I prepared it in martini glasses and the layers of colour - caramel, white and strawberry made a pretty presentation. Since I am not very good with gelatine, it was safer. To reduce the fat, I reduced the cream by 1/3 and substituted milk. Next time, I would reduce the amount of sugar in the recipe as others have indicated they have done. Truly a yummy dessert.

Delicious, subtle but tangy. I have a couple of suggestions, though: I think the amount of gelatin is incorrect-I think the amount should be 1 1/2 envelopes, not teaspoons, of gelatin. This amounts to 3 3/4 tsp. I excluded the caramel the second time I made these, and added 1 1/2 tsp balsamic vinegar to the berries.

Actually not a recipe but a request. Any suggestions on how to make panna cotta with agar agar instead of gelatine for us vegetarian out there?

I made this recipe twice and it was wonderful both times. Spooning a bite of the panna cotta with a small mint leaf into your mouth results in a wonderful flavor beyond compare.

Excellent recipe. However the directions need to specify the following: slowly add the warm cream mixture to the buttermilk whisking constantly to prevent curdling. When I first made the recipe, I added the cool buttermilk to the warm cream causing the mixture to curdle. This is a very sweet desert. I used only 3 tablespoons of granulated sugar in the cream mixture when I prepared it a second time and found the it just right with the carmelized sugar.
