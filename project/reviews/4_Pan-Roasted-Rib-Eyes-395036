Iv'e made this recipe twice now, each time with staeks warmed to room temperature. The first time I cooked them to 125 degrees which cooked them closer to rare than to medium rare. The second time I cooked them to 130 degrees with only slightly better results. Next time I will cook them to 140 degrees to hopefully achieve medium rare.

Sorry, I just expect more from my food. Even if you serve 6 people this has 160 grams of fat per person - that is nearly two and half days worth of fat. As I said "think seriously". I didn't say don't eat it - but don't make it a regular occurrence either.

krisc63 - 'frenched' simply means removing the fat, skin and meat from the bone by scraping it down, up to the main body of meat. A perfectly frenched rib eye would also have the eye of the meat rounded by tying with butcher's twine. Google 'frenched rib eye' for images. This technique is often called for with pork and lamb chops, as well, although the twine-tying isn't necessary with those smaller chops.

What is the process to have a frenched ribeye? I have not heard of that term before. Thanks, Kris

Yo Buzzkill--maybe you should pull your disgusted & cynical head from the keyboard long enough to notice that this recipe serves six (6). That's 4 lbs. including the bones. Once the bones are trimmed away, that's about 6 oz. of beef seared with a heart-healthy fat, loaded with CLA (studies have shown CLA to be beneficial in weight loss).

It must be miserable continually being 'cynical and disgusted.' Perhaps the subject of 'food' is not one you should dwell on. So, maybe stop reading recipes you know will disgust you, and use your cynicism for political analysis. And leave the rest of us alone - we are not interested in your opinion. Excellent recipe, by the way.

Now that we've heard from the killjoy, back to the recipe. Supermarkets in my area tend not to offer full size rib eyes except during holiday shopping, so I'm not sure I could easily find the main ingredient. An alternative would be a small rib roast, cut-up. Still, the bearnaise/steak combination is always a winner.

According to my mastercook program 4 pounds of rib eye and 8 tablespoons of oil have nearly 1000 grams of fat. And that is before you add the bernaise sauce. Do some serious thinking before indulging in this monster
