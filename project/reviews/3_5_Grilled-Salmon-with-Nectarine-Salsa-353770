This was a big disappointment! 4 forks is usually a winner, but the salsa never came to life. The salmon with coriander was great, but the salsa barely so-so; the guests ate all the salmon and let the salsa sit in the dish.

Fantastic way to serve salmon in the summertime. I skipped the coriander (don't care for the soapy quality that spice can add) and thought it was just fine without. The salsa benefits from standing at room temperature for about an hour before being served - gives the flavors a chance to marry.

I made this tonight with green onions from my CSA, cilantro from my garden and really ripe and fresh nectarines. Very, very good! Served with grilled corn on the cob and roasted fingerling potatoes. A great outdoor meal with a cold white wine.

I was looking for a change from the excellent salmon with mango salsa recipe on this website and came across this one. It was far too sour, so much so that you couldn't taste any of the other flavours. Couldn't tast the chopped ginger (I like ginger), cumin (1 tspn) or the jalepeno peppers (sub for chili). I'll go back to my salmon/mango recipe again!

Dinner ended tonight with the man saying "definitely make this again." Even better was that it's super fast and easy. I baked instead of grilled the salmon (no skin) and used clementines instead of nectarines. I also didn't have coriander so used a little cumin and cardamom as a substitute. I guess in the end I changed a lot of the recipe, but it was still very tasty. I think you can improvise greatly with this recipe and still make a wonderful meal.

There are other tropical salsas that work better - the green onion was too mild, and perhaps the nectarines I used were not sweet enough...

I made a few changes to this according to what I had in the refridgerator - orange instead of nectarine, red onion instead of green, and I cut out the chillies as my boyfriend can't have them. Still very delicious and very fresh, perfect for summer. And healthy too. As the other reviewers say, the salsa really adds something to the salmon. Will definately make again.

Yum! Totally delicious salsa which worked wonders with some average salmon, and so easy to make.

Delicious! The serrano-lime-nectarine combination is utterly fascinating. My BF (read: inexperienced in the kitchen) made this for me. It was super easy for him (which is a big deal!) and I enjoyed the hell out of it! Coriander was really interesting too. although i would highly recommend cracking the seeds well. Will make over and over again!

Just finished serving this to the family. Ages 10 and 14 and then a couple of 40 something adults. Everyone loved it! The coriander really surprised me at how it complimented the other flavors. Will cook this one again.

Have now made this 3 times and always to rave reviews!! Made it for my book club and everyone loved it! Added fresh mango to the salsa and used jalepeno pepper rather than serrano chili...don't skip the coriander...will make this often this summer!

This dish is so good - clean and simple. Our grill caught fire and overcooked the salmon, but even that could not detract from the deliciousness of the recipe. The nectarine salsa is divine. I loved the coriander on the salmon, too.

None of us could eat this salsa, because the ginger was so overpowering. Maybe it's because I used a Microplane zester instead of small holes on a box grater, but I used FAR less than the recipe called for, and it was still too much. Also, I had good nectarines, but I accidentally got white ones, who's subtle flavor was overwhelmed by everything else. I'm not so sure it's worth trying again.

Terrific way to dress up grilled salmon. The nectarine salsa is fantastic and worked really well with pita chips too. I added a about a 1/2 teaspoon more cumin to the salsa to give it a little more kick. Will definitely become a BBQ staple.

The nectarine salsa is excellent. This is a great alternative to our standard grilled salmon. Will definitely make again.

I made this recipe last night substituting yellow onion for green onions, lemons for limes, ginger powder for fresh ginger, powdered hot peppers for seeded serrano chile and cumin seeds for ground cumin and it turned out well, except the yellow onion was too strong and overpowered the salsa. One should really use the onions indicated.
