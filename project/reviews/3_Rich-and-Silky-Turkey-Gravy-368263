This recipe was great and worth the extra time to make the broth. I did use drumsticks instead of wings for the broth so maybe less burning as a result. I dont understand how browning the parts more translates into a deeper color, as the color is derived mostly from the roux. I also agree that the porcini powder made a huge flavor difference. I made twice as much gravy for the number of diners and barely had any for the leftovers.

This was an excellent recipe producing some of the best gravy I've tasted or made. The addition of porcini powder is brilliant. All my dinners were asking about the gravy as it was disappearing at a rapid rate.

I was disappointed with this turkey gravy recipe. The oven temp as stated is too high--the drippings burn. Roast the turkey parts at 375 in order to save the drippings.The recipe as stated doesn't get the turkey parts as brown as they should be.Roast long enough to turn the turkey parts a deep mahogany, otherwise the gravy will be very light in color. Get your roux very dark as well. The 'cafe au lait' description isn't dark enough if you want the gravy to look and taste rich. Making the gravy ahead of time is a great idea but this recipe just doesn't hit the mark.
