Served for Christmas dinner as a side to ham. Amazing flavor, everyone raved about these and wanted the recipe. Wasn't sure about the rosemary, but it compliments the mustard very nicely. I did add a squeeze of fresh lemon juice as recommended by other reviewers. Can't wait to make again!

easy, flavorful. I threw skewered potatoes on the grill for about 10-15 minutes along with chicken breasts. A nice variation for roasted red potatoes.

These were really good. The only thing I did differently was I added the juice of 1 lemon and I used oregano instead of rosemary. But all in all really great. We also cooked them on the bbq...Awesome!!

This was great. The rosemary gave it a nice flavor. They could have been left in the oven for just a bit longer though.

Very easy, tasty way to liven up red potatoes. Would definitely make again as a side to a meat, soup or salad.

A standard in our house now. Even the picky picky kids like them. The dijon and garlic add nice punch

Served this for a dinner party of five with Chicken Sate and Beef Kebabs and it was perfect!

Oh so good! Think I'll try it next time when we have guests because it was so easy to make.

Very easy and great flavor. Grilling would be nice too.

Almost gave only 3 forks, but then I remembered my crazy carvings for these potatoes that won't go away! The mustardy, garlicky, bite with the creamy almost sweet reds is heavenly. I might use a little extra dressing for these. Just don't over boil the potatoes or they may start to fall apart on you. I didn't even bother with the skewers last time and just tossed them in a pan under the broiler. I won't lie- I even ate a 1/4 of them before they even made it to the broiler - raw garlic and all. A few splashes of white wine vinegar added an extra punch too - any dried herb can substitute for the fresh thyme as well if need be. Yum!! I might even have a few extra babies to make as a little snack right now!

Made for a cookout and everyone LOVED it! We grilled on gas grill instead of broiling and they turned out great. Crispy on the outside & soft on the inside. Yum!

This was a pretty good recipe. Simple, easy and tasty. I'll make them again.

This was delicious. I added one teaspoon of red pepper flakes because we tend to like things a little "hotter", and it made them perfect! We will definitely add this one to our recipe box!

This was tasty but needed a little bit of pizzazz. We added a little bit of lemon juoce and it really made these great.

I did not skewer these, but just baked them in the oven, turning once. They still turned out great. While the dish is not mind-blowing, it was good enough for my boyfriend to ask that we have them again. I will put this one in the keepr file because it is easy and the left-overs were good - hot or cold.

HUGE HIT,,,AND SO EASY. I DID THEM IN THE OVEN AND THEY CAME OUT GREAT. HAVE MADE MANY TIMES SINCE.

This was tasty and simple. I soaked the skewers for about 30 minutes to keep them from burning. I used both red and white fingerling potatoes fresh from the farmer's market for a little extra interest. Someone mentioned that this was bland-I suggest tasting the marinade before adding the potatoes and adjusting it to suit your individual liking-for me that means more garlic!! Also, someone mentioned that the potatoes were mushy and difficult to skewer. Make sure you don't cook them completely when you boil them-that may have been the problem. When I drained these, they were still "al dente".

Quite tasty - paired with chicken brochettes with red peppers and feta. Placing on the skewers was not particularly effective or necessary. Next time I will just broil sans skewers.

It was good, but it clearly needed some more zip. I would think about adding some minced onions the next time and maybe a dash of cayenne pepper.

This was a delicious and easy side dish. I too did not use skewers. My kids loved them!

Very good - my only sub was dried rosemary (halved the amount) because I had no fresh in my CT garden in January. I also omitted the skewers and simply baked them after tossing them with the dressing and letting them marinate for an hour at 425 for 15 minutes (after parboiling for 10). Great twist on the usual roasted potatoes w/garlic and rosemary - all with only the addition of mustard. Go figure! Enjoy!

This was the best potato recipie ive ever made! I made it for a bbq and it was a huge hit, although it was hard not to eat all of it on the way to the table!

To the ccok who missed out on flavor: try broiling these and pairing them with another gift from Epicurious.com; 4 fork gem "Super Short Ribs" Out of this world on a winters night.

This is an excellent side dish. Very tasty and the ingredients blend together beautifully. Everyone loved them.

This was yummy-especially with fresh rosemary from my garden! I also bbq'd it along side my steaks. It's always nice to not have to heat up the house with the oven when it's 103 degrees in So. Ca.!

Delicious!! Prepared several times this summer, and they were always a hit! Leftovers (if any) are great when sliced thin and sauteed briefly in olive oil.

This is a great summer side dish - easy, delicious and offers a terrific "presentation." I've only cooked it under a broiler, but am going to try the grill this weekend. It gets raves every time!

I've been making these potato skewers regularly since the August issue - inside using the broiler and outside on the grill. They have been perfect and a hit each time. I don't change a thing!

Wasn't impressed with these - they were too mushy, and the flavour was lost. They were also very sticky and hard to put on the skewers. Would make other recipes before trying this one again.

Excellent and so easy! I upped the garlic in the mustard mixture and was very pleased with the results. Fresh rosemary is not critical; dried will do. These were a huge hit and will be served again!

Love These!!!! I add extra mustard. Works best with gas broiler (I've done under both)

Great for summer or anytime. Yummy!

I must admit, I may be skewing results because I didn't use dijon mustard and I loved it. I DID use regular old yellow mustard (too tired to go to the store) and I thought the stuff was fab. Even if you're not a mustard lover, the taste is really toned down once the stuff is cooked. Try it.

This recipe is a staple in our house. I have made it many times since it has appeared in Bon Appetit. I use 3 very generous tablespoons of Grey Poupon mustard. Rather than putting them on skewers, I grill them on a grill rack until crusty. My husband is always asking for these potatoes.

Such an easy recipe....grilled the potatoes....they were a big hit and would make them again. The mustard taste was just right.

Rating: 3
I don't like mustard so the mild taste was fine. The way that the sauce crusted on the potatoes kept them moist and was a good texture. Especially nice since all but the broiling could be done well ahead of time. On the skewers it plated well for company.

I ran out of dijon mustard and had to substitute some grainy mustard and I tossed in a little horseradish, which really punched the dish up.

We thought these were great. Nice, spicy, assertive flavor. Would definitely make again.

I too could not taste the mustard in the marinade. I prepared them just as the recipe is written and I did grill them. Good recipe, not great

This was alright, not fabulous. Honestly I could hardly taste the mustard. Maybe the previous reviewer is on to something by grilling them. I used the broiler as the recipe suggested. Anyway I liked the presentation on skewers and will use that again.

These were out of this world! Great mustard-garlic flavor. We grilled them rather than broiling.
