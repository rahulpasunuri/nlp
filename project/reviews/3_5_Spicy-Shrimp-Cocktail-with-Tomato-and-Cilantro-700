Perhaps I missed something here, but I found nothing exceptional about this recipe. There was little spice (I anticipated great things), and, for me, not worth the effort. Plain cocktail sauce that I "throw together" w/ ketchup, horseradish, vinegar and cilantro is just as good in no time, no fuss. I really wanted to love this. Alas...

Everyone we've made this for has raved about this recipe! Comes out nice with pre-cooked shrimp if in a pinch for time too!

I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and let this sit after mixing for 8 hours, the flavors were great! It was a hit with guests.

This was one of the best shrimp cocktails I have ever tasted. I used Clamato juice instead of tomato juice, and added a small amount of red wine vinegar instead of the sherry (I didn't find any at the store). I also used the juice of a can of chopped clams. I pretty much followed the rest of the recipe as written. I allowed it to boil for about 40 min, and I took out some half of the serrano chile 1/2 way through b/c it was really hot. I allowed the sauce to chill, and when adding all of the ingredients, I added avocado, and the clams to the list. I got so many compliments! My boyfriend doesn't even like shirmp, and he wanted seconds! Delicious!

Made this recipe for Super Bowl and was quite disappointed. I prefer my Bayou Shrimp recipe much more. Now THAT'S spicy! No one else seemed to care much for this recipe, either. Not wanting to waste the shrimp used in this recipe, I will make up some Bayou Shrimp sauce and put it in that.

I made this for Super Bowl and was quite disappointed. I love spicy, but this didn't do it for me. I prefer my Bayou Shrimp. Since I don't want to waste the shrimp from this dish, I'll drain it and put it into my Bayou Shrimp sauce. Now THAT'S spicy!

My caterer asked me for this recipe! When my husband and I entertain we often cater the event and then make some of our own "signature" dishes. This one made the cut for our New Year's party, and was a hit. I prepared this the evening before and let it sit in the refridgerator for about 9 hours. The flavors came together beautifully and the dish was very colorful. Poured into a shallow platter (almost like a quiche pan)garnished with a large sprig of cilantro; beautiful. I took another guest's suggestion - putting toothpicks in a few of the shrimp (leaving more toothpicks nearby) and these were DEVOURED! I will definitely make this again, and it was perfect as a make ahead for a party.

We tried this dish on Xmas eve - it was excellent! We wanted something other than your generic shrimp and coctail appetizer. This was gobbled up in record time! We made it a couple of hours ahead of time and mixed it all together to chill before we brought it out - worked great.

For some time now I have been looking for a recipe with the distinctive taste of Campechana, a seafood cocktail served at a certain good seafood restaurant in Houston. The dish originates from the Mexican state of Campeche on the Gulf of Mexico. Kevin Taylor's shrimp cocktail is delicious, and the closest I have come. I recommend the following modifications: (1) use 4 serranos instead of 2, (2) boil the sauce for 40 minutes until quite thick, then add 1/4 carrot juice and reduce another 10 minutes, (3) use 1 pound of shrimp and 1/2 pound of cooked lump crabmeat, (4) add 1 clove finely minced garlic and 1 tablespoon minced jalapeño pepper to the chopped ingredients, (5) just before serving blend in 2 medium sized diced Haas avocados, (6) sprinkle individual servings with lime juice and a teaspoon of diced jalapeño, and serve with thin corn tortilla chips like El Milagro® Estilo Casera brand. Mui bueno.

I made this dish for a cocktail party and my guests scarfed it up like there was no tomorrow. I will definitely make it again, but may take New Jersey Carolyn's advice and spritz it all with some extra lime juice just before serving.

Made this to bring to a dinner party. All got seconds, and thirds. Great for summer entertaining or beach days since it is made ahead, and there is nothing like local shrimp from the Carolinas!

I made this dish for a dinner party and got lots of great comments. Make sure you boil the sauce down until it thickens (took mine longer than 30 minutes). I served it with crackers around a dish with the shrimp. May try toothpicks next time.

I made this for guests and everyone loved it except for me. It didn't think it was at all spicy. You definitely need to squeeze the lime wedges over the shrimp at the end for flavor.

Delicious ! Needs twice juice for this quantity of shrimp.

This is always a hit. I have pased this recipe on many times. A great company dish and it can be made ahead of time.

Very tasty!!! I recommend using jumbo shrimp and saute them in olive oil with minced garlic. I allowed the tomato sauce to reduce until it was very thick. Leave the seeds in the peppers to add some zip. It's a terrific dish to make at least a day in advance--time allows the flavors to really blend. I toothpicked each shrimp to make them easy to eat as a finger food-give it a try--your guests will love them!!

Yum! Made this for company; everyone loved it. Easy and delicious. Not too spicy using jalapenos. I'm going to add more pepper flavor next time.

I'm not a seafood fan, but I made it for my family. Even though I could not test the results, it came out great and was fairly easy to prepare. Everyone raved, and I was even rewarded with a big hug from my daughter's best friend (10 yrs. old) who loves seafood and spicy flavors!!
