This recipe lacked the texture of a nutty element and the creaminess of a cheese element. I added some fresh goat cheese crumbles and toasted walnuts and a whole apple (instead of the half recommended) and it was wonderful! I also believe that three heads of belgian endive are too many, making the salad far too bitter. Scale the recipe back to two heads of endive and add the other elements for a perfect balance.

This salad was really tasty! We served entree sized portions and served with the mini quiches in prosciutto cups (also on epicurious). We added dried cranberries (as suggested by other reviewers), nuts, and goat cheese. We also used the whole apple, as recommended. Delicious!

Very yummy~ I couldn't find the escarole so I ommitted it and I didn't add the 1/2 gallon of canola that it requested and just used a few tablespoons of olive oil instead. I also threw in toasted walnuts, dried cranberries, and a creamy blue cheese! :)

Delicious! I used only 1/4 c. of olive oil and the whole apple; I'm glad I made those changes. This salad is great, totally recommend it!

This salad is freaking amazing. I didn't expect that it would be, with such simple ingredients, but they work so well together. I will add the entire Fuji apple next time, instead of just half -- the apple is what really makes this salad. Upon eating it for the first time, my tastebuds craved an addition of Swiss cheese, which I'll also give a try to next time...and there WILL be a next time. :-)

found all the ingredients no problem. served this at a dinner party last night. simple and delicious. had a ton of dressing left over. will make again and try olive oil and much less of it. also added toasted almonds.

Great concept but I would really love for someone to tell me where I am going to find Belgian endive in the middle of January?? Or escarole for that matter. This feels like a spring/summer recipe to me and I wish Bon Appetit would align their recipes appropriately. Also, winter apples have a tendency to be very mushy and bland. I will check back with this one in the spring.

This recipe is similar to one I do, but it is only apples, endive, oil, cider vinegar, suagar and cinammon. It is a nice green salad that is perfect at the holidays and also during the summer. I think next time i made tray and add the shallots and see what that does.

Recipies can get rated without reviewing it. It can still get a lot of 4 fork ratings without a review being written.

This is listed in the "Most Popular" category, and has 4 forks. Yet it has ZERO reviews, and says "Be the first to review this recipe." I just looked at another recipe in "Most Popular" that has only one review. What's up with this? How do recipes get to be listed as "Most Popular" with no reviews?

Very tasty and basic. I used half the oil and substituted olive oil and added sliced almonds.
