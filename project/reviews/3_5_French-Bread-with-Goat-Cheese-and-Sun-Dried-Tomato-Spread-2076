I love this recipe and have gotten rave reviews for it. However, I've made it into a cheese ball, rather than spread it on the bread. I mix the first four ingredients with a bit of sour cream. I put it into the freezer for 15-20 minutes (till it stiffens up a bit), then roll it in a ball. I rolled it in parsley flakes, crushed walnuts, and a pinch or two of red pepper flakes. It looks festive and tastes great with crackers. Lovely. I haven't tried it yet with basil, but I will. It will be great, I'm sure.

Super yum and super easy! Don't skimp on the nuts. I think it makes the dish.

Guests raved at how good it was. I used one jar of sun- dried tomatoes, 5 1/2 oz. container of goat cheese, and fresh basil (no thyme, no walnuts), thinned a little with non-fat sour cream. Yum. Served with cuke slices and radishes with their tops attached. Due to some other reviewer's concern about the appearance, I made sure to add some basil as decoration on the top, and put a colorful hors d'oeuvres knife in the dip so people could spread it if they chose. It looked appetizing next to the colorful cukes and radishes. When I said "last call" before I put it away, the guests quickly dipped into it one more time. I'll save the recipe and gladly make it again.

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe, but would also like to suggest that--if we have the common goal that this forum be a place where cooks of all levels can ask questions and share tips--we not yell at one another in ALL CAPS! Keep asking questions and keep cooking!

To Cook in NJ, Did you not READ the Preparation instructions?? Mix first 4 ingredients in bowl. THIN TO SPREADABLE CONSISTENCY WITH SOUR CREAM. Season with generous amount of pepper. Mound cheese in crock or bowl. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before serving.) SPRINKLE CHEESE WITH THYME AND WALNUTS. Serve with bread.

Recipe instructs to mix first 4 ingredients. what about the sour cream? Are the nuts mixed in, or sprinkled on top only?

I made this for a party and we all thought it was quite good. A nice change from just marinated goat cheese.

This was absolutely the hit of our housewarming last week. The flavors really merge well together. We shaped it into a ball and sprinkled thyme leaves over it.

MY ADVICE ON THIS RECIPE: EVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, PUT IT OUT; OTHER PEOPLE WILL. I LIKED IT BUT WASN'T WILD ABOUT IT, BUT MANY, MANY PEOPLE SURPRISED ME BY LOVING IT.

Sorry, but this was nasty.

Use sun-dried tomatoes that are not packed in oil. Pour boiling water over the tomatoes and let set about five minutes. Drain, pat dry and chop. I did not add the walnuts nor any of the spices; instead I used peppercorn feta to add a bit of spice. Served it in a ramikin with freshly baked sourdough. Oh, what a fantastic dish! Served it to friends on Christmas eve and they couldn't get enough. In order to make the mixtrue truly creamy and spreadable I used my food processor. If a chef would like a crunchier dip almonds or walnuts could be easily blended into the dip (by hand) before placing in a dish for serving.

This is delicious and easy to make. I just made it for the 2nd time; it will definitely become one of those I'll remember & experiment with. This time round, I used goat cheese with cracked pepper, and raised the tanginess a notch - superb!

This was awful. I like goat cheese and sun-dried tomatoes, but I couldn't choke down even one T. of this spread. Followed the recipe exactly and it was horrible. Made for a party and had to throw out and make something else. When I think of all the money I wasted on goat cheese, I could cry.

If you like sun-dried tomatoes, you'll like it. If not, you won't. It's the most powerful flavor. A nice change of pace. I also toasted the walnuts; they added more of a crunch.

This made a nice appetizer- I served it with some garlic crostini, and it went over very well.

Sorry, cheese balls don't do it for me - this tasted like a "classic" one. It was way too bland for my group.

I had never used goat cheese before and was astonished at the price... so I substituted farmer's cheese. It was delicious. When I make it again, however, I think I'll add a little cream cheese for some extra flavor and creaminess.

We served this to guests and eveyone loved it. A great combination of flavors. I toasted and reduced the amount of walnuts based on one of the comments. The walnuts added a nice texture to the spread. It was also very easy to prepare. A definite keeper recipe.

My guests loved it. I personally thought it had too nutty. We used it for breakfast on bagels and it worked perfectly.
