Made this twice in the summer when fruit at its best and got rave reviews - especially from the Brits in the crowd who recalled childhood puddings of long ago. Bonus that this dessert is easy to make, can be done well in advance, and is easy to transport to the party!

Great summer dessert. I had beautifully ripe strawberries and giant, sweet blueberries on hand, so I thought I'd give this recipe a try. I used Pepperidge Farms White Sandwich bread and it turned out a bit gooey; I now understand why the recipe calls for a firm texture bread. Despite the goof, my family still loved it. My finicky three year old finished it all.
