Good, but nothing too exciting. I doubled the 7-spice powder and threw in a couple handfuls of shredded napa cabbage, but it needs a little something more.

I followed the recipe exactly and came up with a credible dish, but not a memorable one, rather reminescent of a dish on a low-priced Chinese buffet. The dish is easy enough to make, however, and can be mostly prepared in advance. If only it had more complex flavor.

I won't rate as is because the eggplant didn't do anything for me at all - but the sauce is quite excellent and works great on chicken with white rice. I found Japanese 7 spice powder on amazon, and bought "ginger in a tube" instead of dealing with peeling & shredding fresh. Excellent quick mid-week meal!

Really good. I made the Japanese seven-spice powder from a recipe I got off of the net. Then I took out all of the peppercorns because I thought it was too spicy. But the recipe turned out not to be spicy enough but still delicious. Live and learn.

I too had to make a few substitutions - I subbed 1 tbs dry red wine + 1 tbs agave for the miring, and used Chinese 5-spice powder instead of the Japanese 7-spice powder. It still was quite good!!

My husband & I loved this! Served over white rice, with an appetizer of Trader Joe's "Pork Shu Mai" (Dumplings), which I steamed, then crisped up in our cast iron skillet and served w/ a quick Asian dipping sauce I whipped up. Great combo for a healthy lunch or dinner. I only had about 1/2 the amt of Japanese eggplant needed, so I augmented with some yellow squash and red & yellow bell pepper. Also did not have 7-spice powder, but looked up what was in it & tried to add what I could (orange zest, lemon zest, tiny bit of wasabi paste for spice). Also added some sesame oil because I love it.

I used Japanese Eggplant.I did not have Mirin so, like another reviewer, I also substituted white wine with a bit of white miso and scant teaspoon of brown sugar. I did not use the spice. My stepson loved it and said it tasted like Filet Mignon!!

This was a great dish! My seven and eleven year old kids both looked at me once they tasted it and in unison said "this is awesome!" The sauce is fabulous, the Japanese eggplant is tender, and we didn't think you needed the special 7-spice seasoning (although I found it at an Asian Market)--the sauce was enough to make it a great dish. Quick and easy and very tasty! Definitely a keeper. Served it with a salad with a soy vinaigrette and mandarin oranges and pot stickers on the side. Great combination for an easy meal.

Easy and so tasty. A japanese friend of mine gave me a similar recipe, and I just combined the two as I didn't have the Japanese seven-spiced powder and didn't want to buy it just for this recipe. I added 1 tsp of miso paste and 2 tsp of sugar. (I would recommend tasting the sauce and adjusting both as necessary). Great flavor and it was all gone. I would strongly suggest using the Asian eggplants as the skin is much softer. Will definitely make again.

Nice eggplant dish...wasn't too oily or overly sauced. The ginger flavor really comes through.

My husband and I both thought this was quite good, especially for a flavorful, vegetarian mid-week meal. Didn't find it too salty at all. In fact I doubled the liquid & spice amounts, using tamari instead of soy sauce, and added about a tablespoon of minced garlic. Used minced scallions instead of chives at the end. I think I only used an 1/8 tsp of sea salt or so over Japanese eggplant. We had it over brown rice with some organic pre-packaged potstickers from Whole Foods on the side.

Just OK. Too heavy and salty, even though rinsed and used lite soy. Find another recipe. Stir fried eggplant can be sooo good, but not here.

I found this recipe while searching for a new eggplant recipe to add to my own repertoire. I did not make this recipe as I already have a favorite Chinese family version. I just wanted to address the reviewers who found the results of this recipe too salty: the 1 tsp of salt sprinkled over the eggplant to draw out water seems like a lot. I would probably use less than half myself. Rinsing off the salt would defeat the purpose of salting the eggplant in the first place. Also, not all soy sauces are the same. Japanese and Chinese brands have different flavors and salt content. And there are so many many different types of soy sauces that you should experiment with if you have a chance to visit an ethnic grocery store that carries a wider selection. In our Chinese version, we use a similar amount of soy sauce as this recipe, but it is half Chinese thin soy sauce (thin is not "light" soy sauce) and one half dark soy sauce. In any case, taste your soy sauce before adding it to your eggplant and add accordingly.

Fantastic recipe. Excellent texture and flavor. We have actually converted non-eggplant eaters with this dish. My Japanese g-mother uses lite soy sauce (Yamasa brand) and says that it is really important to use Japanese eggplant not the giant purple supermarket variety because the flesh will soak up too much of the salt. Also, I noticed that several previous reviewers mentioned using five-spice powder which is not the same as the Japanese seven-spice powder. Five-spice powder is Chinese and shares nothing in common with seven-spice powder in terms of ingredients or flavor.

ZERO FORKS! How can a recipe that sounds so lovely go so wrong? All I got was a mothful of salt! Perhaps I was too liberal while sprinkling the eggplant with salt? I washed it well afterwards, and I squeezed it all dry. 2 Tablespoons of soy sauce? My mouth was burned from the salt! Maybe just a splash of soy wouild have been better. After one bite, I sorrowfully threw the rest into the trash! There went the last of my garden eggplant = (

This is a wonderful recipe. The "spicy" in the name comes from the addition of the Japanese seven spice powder ----which is primarily red and black pepper. I have found it in multiple Asian markets but always by the Japanese name "shichimi togarashi." The English name on one container was "red pepper mix" and on the other "chili flavored seasoning mix." It adds a lot to the dish, but if it's unavailable, I think some finely ground red and black pepper would be effective substitutes. Shichimi togashi has nothing to do with Chinese five spice.

This was really yummy! My boyfriend loved it, so we're making it again today. Boulder, CO has a great spice shop called Savory Spice shop, and they carry the seven-spice powder. You can order it online from them at http://www.savoryspiceshop.com/blends/shichimi.html

Whole Foods didn't have seven-spice powder, so I made a reasonable facsimile, and the dish was very good. I browned the eggplant, removed it from the wok, and added a large handful of sliced fresh shitake mushrooms, which Whole Foods did have. Then I put everything back in the wok and mixed it up. This is not a saucy dish, but the flavors are very nice. I served it over Basmati rice.

Rating: 1
The soy sauce overpowered the dish. I had all of the listed ingredients (no problem with the seven-spice powder as other cooks had) and found the dish to be too salty/soy saucy to be enjoyable. Perhaps the dish tastes better with the substituted ingredients. I give this dish 0 forks because it wasn't even okay.

So fabulous! Everyone asked for more, but alas, this makes 6 very small servings. I'll double it next time. I also toasted some black sesame seeds and tossed them on top. It added a wonderful flavor dimension and texture.

Wow! Everyone LOVED this dish. My father isn't that enthusiastic about vegetarian dishes, but not only did he finish it, he liked the flavor so much he didn't drown it in hot sauce the way he usually does. Everyone is already asking me when I will make it again. After rinsing the eggplant, I squeezed each piece in a paper towel so as to remove as much moisture as possible. I also didn't use the Japanese seven-spice powder. I didn't substitute anything for it, I just left it out. And sadly, I forgot all about the chives. Even so, an exceptional dish. Everyone agreed this recipe is better than any eggplant they've eaten in Chinese restaurants.

Like some other commenters, I didn't have the seven-spice powder, but I added a clove of minced garlic, juice from 1/2 lemon, some sesame seeds, and a little sriracha sauce. It was delicious. I served it over jasmine rice cooked with sesame oil, sauteed shallots, and soy sauce.

Excellent! A little salty, so be sure to rinse the salt off the eggplant completely, and/or use low-sodium soy sauce.

Easy and quick...a hit when the friends made thom Kha soup and salad rolls. Didn't have 7 spice powder, so I looked it up and found that it's citrus, garlic, sesame seeds, seaweed, chili peppers....so I just used fresh ingredients and it made a lovely addition to the sauce.

When I saw this in the magazine I had to make it right away, and I was not disappointed. I just can't get enough eggplant. I made this dish exactly as written except for the 7 spice, I only had the 5 spice. Next time I'll work a little harder at finding the 7 spice before I make it again. This dish is worth making.

to Heropp: Before using eggplant, most cooks salt it to bring out the moisture and excess bitterness. Salting changes the entire taste and consistency (for the better). The recipe means you should let the salted eggplant drain in the colander for 45 minutes to get rid of liquid/bitterness, then rinse off all that salt. I forget if the recipe said so, but after that you should press the eggplant pieces with paper towels to squeeze out all of the liquid you can. Then saute. There's a world of difference.

I came into this recipe unprepared and used the wine/sugar substitute instead of the mirin and no 7 spices. I liked the already compromised recipe, however, I didn't understand the directions "Toss eggplant with 1 teaspoon salt and drain in a colander, stirring occasionally, 45 minutes." The rinse it? I just lightly salted it and moved on to the skillet. I'll try to source the mirin and 7 spices and try it again. In the meantime, if anyone else reviews this recipe and can clue me to the "toss eggplant" direction please do so!

This was quite good. I did have to make some substitutions - I used regular eggplant, I fried it in sesame oil, used white wine with a teaspoon of sugar instead of mirin, used about an inch of ginger chopped fine, and added ground turkey and fresh basil like the other poster (the basil was a great addition). Very healthy dish with a lot of flavor and very few calories!

I doubled the sauce portion of this recipe and added ground turkey, chopped basil, and spinach. it was really good and very simple. i also didn't drain the eggplant for the noted 45 min. i only did for about 20 min. I only had chinese 5-spice. Would definitely make this again.

I agree with sylva below, a bit too salty, so definitely use low-sodium soy or lower the amount. I used seasme oil as a replacement for vegetable oil in the small tester dish I just made- the sesame came through a bit too strong so I'll mix it up the next time. Also, I like ginger, so I would suggest adding a bit more if you're like me.

DELICIOUS!!!!! I used 1 Italian and 1 Asian eggplant and omitted the seven-spice poweder (couldn't find it in the store). It was EXCELLENT!!! Next time I'll serve it with steamed rice and use less soy sauce - it was just a touch too salty for me. This will be my staple eggplant recipe from now on.

Excellent recipe!! I used a combo of asian and regular eggplant from the garden and just made sure they were cut in similar sizes. I was out of Japanese 7 spice powder and used Chinese 5 spice instead, which is not similar at all, but it turned out great.

So quick and easy and soooo good. I added extra matchstick ginger during the last minute of cooking because our family is ginger crazy. Recipe is better than another I've used that requires a lot more time.

I am sure this recipe was great. However, if you like a little spicy flavor in your dishes like I do, just add sesame oil, dried red chili peppers and garlic to the existing sauce. I used less vegetable oil to stir fry since I put it in the sauce. The eggplant developed into an Asian influenced dish that turned out delicious! Even my husband, who isn't thrilled with eggplant dishes, loved it!

so - i really didn't follow the recipe. didn't have Asian eggplant so used the regular kind; didn't have Japanese seven-spice powder, so used Chinese five-spice; got distracted and (slightly) burnt the eggplant; probably should have rinsed it better - end result was a bit salty so might use low-sodium soy next time; and still, the result was delicious.
