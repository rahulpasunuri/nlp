This was okay--not bad for a quick, relatively low-fat soup. The fried pancetta added some good saltiness and texture.

Really easy, super tasty. I accidentally used prosciutto instead of pancetta, but it worked out just as well. I crumbled up a few bits of the prosciutto an added it into the simmering soup. Also, I didn't do the croutons. I'm sure they're delicious, but leaving them out was a good way to knock off a few calories - the soup was fabulous without.

this soup was bland. I tried to sass it up with some orange zest and cream...but still blah...and maybe my shallots were just particularly strong because there was definately too much shallot taste.

LOVE this soup! I made this soup for my family's potato soup cook-off tomorrow, and hopefully my soup will win! It was a piece of cake to make. I made this recipe for the first time, and doubled it. The only part I dreaded was the peeling and cutting and boiling of the sweet potatoes, but it was completely worth it. I used a little more butter than requested for the croutons. The croutons needed some seasoning, so I added salt and pepper as soon as they came off the pan. I also puréed the soup, for a silky texture. I recommend it rather than leaving it chunky. It tastes delicious, highly recommended as a gorgeous autumn soup!

I used thick sliced bacon and farm grown sweet potatoes, and sourdough sandwich bread. It has a very Autumny taste, good for the newly cold weather. I'll definitely be making it again.

I definitely like the salty sweet combination of the pancetta and sweet potato BUT the texture of the soup was too think for me -- reminded me of my daughter's sweet potatoes when she was 6 months old. And it was a bit bland - probably wouldn't make it again, but will keep the idea of the pancetta for another sweet potato soup.

This soup is wonderful!! Very, very tasty and very easy to make. I added a tad bit more rosemary and also had some extra yams that I tossed in. I would definitely recommend blending the soup. Will definitely be making this soup again soon!

An EZ, excellent recipe with lots of flavor. I doubled it & used 1 C shallots & 1 C chopped onion. Also used organic, garnet sweet potatoes, which were delictible on their own. I omitted the croutons - the pancetta is enough gilding for this lily.

I added a splash of whipping cream, pureed the soup before serving (to improve the texture) and omitted the crutons, served it with black pepper biscuits instead. It was a delicious fall weekday meal.

Very good. Easy to make, used turkey bacon instead of pancetta and still very good.

This was yummy! Friends who describe themselves as not soup lovers - loved it! To save money if you're cooking for a crowd, substitute onions for shallots and bacon for pancetta.

This is a nice way to use sweet potatoes. The soup itself isn't just completely amazing, but with the pancetta and croutons it comes alive pretty well. I used homemade rosemary bread croutons. It doesn't need additional salt because the pancetta is plenty salty. I wouldn't make this a company dish, but it's good fall family food.
