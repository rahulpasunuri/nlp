What's wrong with tomato flavor? Nada! Why else make a tomato-based pasta sauce, either with garden tomatoes or good-quality, canned ones? Geeeez. I accentuated the tomato with the prime suspects ... onion, garlic, oregano, basil & some red pepper flakes ... not to over-power tomato, though. I also kept out the somewhat crispy bacon to toss at the end with the parmesan. Blue cheese or feta? Would be too salty. Easy, no-brainer delicious. I used sweet vermouth, which loves tomatoes, as do I.

Not a bad tasting sauce but nothing out of the ordinary. Almost no bacon taste although it is done with 6 slices and 4 tbs of bacon fat. As another reviewer said, the flavor was overwhelmingly tomato. If I was to try it again, I would maybe try adding the bacon at the end as suggested to see if that helps.

I'm probably used to too much salt, but this dish doesn't have enought flavor for me.

Great weeknight meal. Agree with others suggesting adding bacon at the end. Add basil and thyme with oregano. Also add chopped onions before the garlic.

The first time I made this I thought it was very good. The second time I thought it was just good. I agree it is a good weekday dinner recipe. I recommend using thick sliced bacon, a little more than 28 ounces of diced tomatoes and don't use feta because it doesn't really work.

This is a great weekday dish. It's simple and hearty. We like it best with feta cheese.

Easy and tasty. I used only parmesan, no blue cheese...and next time I'd definately remove the bacon, and add it later so it is crispy...

This was just plain boring...the only flavor was tomato...

Excellent Dish. I added Onion when I threw in the garlic, and skipped the bleu cheese. I might add some Red Peppers next time as well.

My dinner guests loved this dish! I added 3/4 cup crumbled feta and 1/2 cup parm. I followed other reviewer's suggestion of using Italian herb tomatoes, which added extra flavor. I served the same red wine that I added to the pasta with dinner. Next time I'll use wheat pasta- its texture may hold up better.

I made this dish as a last minute quick dinner. I didn't have tomatoes so I used tomato sauce. I also used only 2 garlic cloves, lightened the sauce with pasta water, used parmesan cheese, and served with gnocchi. My family loved it!

This is one of the best! I use 3/4 C blue cheese and 1/2 C parmesan. I also use the canned tomatoes with Italian Herbs which gives it just a little more spice. Highly recommend this one!

I would have given this 2.5 forks if I could. I liked it and would make it again, I took a previous reviewer's suggestions and added the bacon back at the end and it gave it a little crunch. I used parmesan and think it should have been grated fine so it would melt nicely. I definitely wouldn't use blue cheese; I can see how the previous reviewer was dissapointed. I also used a whole wheat pasta that I had on hand and it was yummy. One observation: why do BA and G always recomment a pound of pasta for 4 people? That is overkill in my opinion, I've been following the suggested 2 oz (dry) per person with every recipe they throw at me and I always have plenty of sauce and plenty to eat without feeling overwhelmed by pasta. Even my husband seems to think he's getting plenty.

With all the great reviews, I thought this would taste better. The flavor of the blue cheese dissolved into a grainy substance which seemed like a waste of good cheese. This recipe was nothing special.

This is the easiest recipe and oh so good. My husband said it was the best pasta dish I ever made, holy cow! Will definitely make it again and for guests.

Yum, yum, yum! I added a small chopped shallot with the garlic and used Parmesan. I also took the bacon out before adding the garlic, crumbled and added at the end so it wouldn't get soggy. Very easy and great flavors - great comfort food!

REALLY GOOD! Extremly tasty! I didn't have any red wine on hand so I added a little splash of 1/2 and 1/2 cream right at the end. Delicious will definately make again

Oh. My. God. My husband ate the *entire* thing (save my one serving) and kept exclaiming over how "tasty" it was! I made it pretty much as is, with the following changes: 3/4 lb pasta, not a full pound; used 8 strips of bacon, not 6; drained the bacon fat except for 1 tsp; sauteed a thinly sliced shallot with the garlic, did not use the pasta water and skipped the parsley. It was delicious ... and I'm sure it would have been even tastier the next day, had the leftovers survived!!

This did not knock my socks off, but it was tasty, filling, and--most importantly--quick and easy. I used 3/4 cup of gorgonzola, and it barely registered. Next time I'll use more or try a different cheese. I removed the bacon from the pan and added it back in at the end, and it was fine.

Terrific! Used bleu and Parmesan cheeses, and more of them. Made it a bit more 'saucy', as I had to travel it. Added the bacon and some sauteed mushrooms at my destination and baked off like a casserole. Even a fussy 5 yr old ate it and asked for more.

I was looking for something quick and easy so I could not waste time in the kitchen and finish watching Monday Night football. This was real easy. A buddy and I wolfed down the pasta in minutes. I always add more garlic in every recipe. Had no tomato paste, but it didn't matter. I used parmesan and added a little sugar during the simmer to take the edge off the acidity. Also, I only had regular parsley. The paste and the Italian parsley would have added to the dish, but it still tasted great without them.

My family loved this dish! It has simple ingredients, is versitile, easy to make and tastes awesome. I used Asiago cheese instead of Parmesan or Feta. Absoulutely delicious. I have passed on the recipe to several co- workers who also gave this recipe rave reviews! Yummy!

Made this for a friend's birthday--I omitted the parsley (forgot to add it to my shopping list) and used more than a cup of gorgonzola cheese. I also baked it after mixing the sauce and pasta. My friend and I both loved it and I plan to make it again and again.

This was fantastic! I added 8oc sliced mushrooms and 1 small diced onion to the bacon, before adding the garlic and then followed the recipe. I used feta and it gave it a nice tang. We will be having this one again, and again.

This is an easy, very good weeknight dish. I used pancetta to cut down on the grease.

This wasn't the best pasta recipe I've ever made, but it was tasty enough (and quick enough to fix after work). I used cavatappi instead of penne and, since I was out of oregano, substituted basil and thyme. If I made this again I think I'd halve the amount of parsley--I seemed to taste it a little too much in each bite.

I usually do not alter the recipes on this site but do to the fact that my cupboards were bear--it was necessary. STILL WE ALL LOVED THIS DISH! My changes are as follows: I used Turkey bacon instead of pork; I used chicken broth instead of wine; omitted the cheese in the sauce and grated some romano cheese as a garnish before serving. We did not feel that the dish was missing anything and by omiting the bulk of the cheese we reduced the calories significantly. Next time we will try this dish with shrimp instead of bacon. It will not have the smokey flavor, but the tomato sauce part of the recipe was so good that we can/will use it over and over again!

great,quick and easy. The guy who gave it just one fork should really retry this one before he gives it just one fork. I concur with the majority. it was very pleasing and will be added to my recipe box

Fantastic dish. I've made this twice, once substituting Pancetta for the bacon,which when cooked crisp adds even more of a smoky taste to this. I used Syrah once and Zinfandel for the Red Wine, both of which were wonderful. It was a hit with family and guests in each instance.

A great dish for a quick easy supper. I substituted fresh pasta and served with a ceasor saled and a good red wine. I make this regularly!Ott

Wonderful! I must admit I made some changes based on what I had on hand--one pound of spicey Cajun sausage (Andouille) instead of bacon, which I sliced thin and pan-fried until crisp & browned, and two 14.5 oz cans of Mild Rotel Tomatoes (not as hot as regular, but they still have a kick). Accordingly, I skipped the red pepper flakes. Followed the cooking instructions, and what we had was to-die-for!

This is a great recipe. The previous reviewer has no clue. The bacon is not "gloppy chunks" if you actually cook it properly! Fresh mushrooms might be a nice idea. This is very easy to make and is great left over.

I didn't like the bacon in this. Adding the liquid after frying the bacon turned the bacon into fatty, gross chunks. We picked all the bacon out before we ate it. There are many other great pasta dishes listed here. Go for one of those!

This is an excellent quick meal; next time I would remove the bacon after cooking, and then add it back in after the simmering time to keep it crispy. I also added a can of mushrooms; fresh would probably taste better.
