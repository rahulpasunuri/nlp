This is one of my favorites (with the addition of craisins and using cilantro instead of parsley). Warm, it tastes like Thanksgiving stuffing. Cold, it is a light and refreshing salad. I always make a double batch. Yummm.

Yummy dish! I would add a bit more butter next time - 1 Tablespoon rather than 1/2 Tablespoon. Also I substituted raisins for the apricots, and it was delicious. I am going to try it with the apricots next time I make it.

This was so delicious! Seems bland as written, but amazingly, the flavors were very alive. I added mint from my garden and used Quinoa cooked in chicken stock, which lifted this all to a new level. The almonds added the perfect crunch. Will definitely make again.

This is simple, but good. I carry it into work for my lunch. The butter really adds a nice lushness. I will definitely try adding cardamom and lemon juice.

This dish was a bit of a disappointment--though perhaps because it deserves side dish status and I tried to make it the center of the meal. It's quite sweet, so be prepared... I will give this another try sometime--maybe in the summer to accompany a grilled chicken breast or some light meat.

I added a teaspoon of cinnamon and it was really good!

I have not tried this recipe, but it is very similar to a recipe I often make. What I add in my similar bulgur dish and what -I think- makes the dish really delicious is ground cardamom (lots of it!) and lemon zest. You can also try adding a variety of herbs (I often use fresh mint and chives) and nuts (pistachios especially). I would suggest some simple chicken dish and a nice glass of gewurztraminer with this bulgur recipe.
