I tried this recipe in preparation for a dinner party and thought it was fabulous. I made a few alterations based on other reviews and my own taste: A little extra coconut milk, less water (1/2 cup), less coriander (1 1/2 TBS), and most importantly, I used tilapia instead of black cod, which is half the price and perfectly mild. It was so delicious - I served it with rice and cucumber raita.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I made it tonight for the second time. As others recommended, I used only 1/4 cup of water. However I used about 1/3 cup of coconut milk. Also, I added a small onion and instead of cubing the fish, I used a whole filet (halibut instead of black cod) and I cooked it (covered) for about 12 minutes. It was really excellent with very nice Indian flavors. I will definitely include this in my rotation of recipes.

I modified this recipe like you wouldn't believe! But I could still tell what the basic recipe was like. I added about 1C leftover 'rice & peas' which had coconut milk in it. I also added some half-boiled potatoes, made into 1/4" chunks. And I added some leftover white rice (I don't have a microwave at the moment, so it was the only way to heat the rice.) I also added a bunch of pre-packaged stir-fry veggies. The rest of the recipe was per the instructions. It was really good!

I thought this was a delicious, easy recipe. I followed the recipe, and thought it was fine. The only adjustment I would have made would be to reduce the amount of water as another reviewer suggested. The sauce was yummy, but there was quite a bit of liquid.

We had a fair amount of trouble with this one - the flavors were delicious but we would make a lot of adjustments. A tip: measure out the spices first. Definitely remove the ginger and pepper slices before serving. We would reduce the oil to 1 T and the water to 1/4 cup, and simmer uncovered. That way the sauce will be thicker. Cod worked fine, and simple basmati rice is perfect. We have sworn by Gourmet for years, so were surprised that this needed so much tweaking.

I have made this twice, once with snapper and once with mahi-mahi. I didn't think that the mango was necessary. I used 5 smallish Thai chilis and canned coconut cream (not the sweet cream of coconut). I served it on top of yellow rice (also a new recipe). It was delicious.

I had this dish at a friend's house last night, and it was fabulous. I have been using this site for several years now and have never taken the time to review a recipe until now. He did not use the hot peppers, but other than that followed the recipe exactly. Great recipe.
