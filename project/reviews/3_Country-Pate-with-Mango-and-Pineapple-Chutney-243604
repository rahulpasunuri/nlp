Love it when people review recipes without making them. Also, perhaps the reviewer below is not aware of the proper definition of pate....I believe this individual perchance may be referring to foie gras or pate de foie gras as opposed to standard pate (which is essentially chopped meat mixed with seasonings and fat). PLEASE save your opinions and political leanings for other forums. If an element of a recipe offends you, just dont make it.Or at least do your homework so you can make an informed statement. That said, this recipe with good quality pate is lovely, easy and impressive.

booooo...pâté...the very thought of a food borne of such cruelty really dampens the appetite...
