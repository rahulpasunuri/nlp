What a LOVELY and tasty treat! I made quite a few of the tweaks that were recommended by previous reviewers. A half batch of the filling, was a perfect fit for my 9" by 1.25" fluted removable-bottom tart pan. This took me about 3 hours, with only about an hour of active time. Worth it! Crust: - 1/2 c. powdered sugar - 1/2 c. almonds - 1/4 t. salt - 8 T. (1 stick) unsalted butter - 1 egg yolk - 1 c. a.p. flour Almond filling: - 1/3 c. almonds - 1/2 T. a.p. flour - 3 T. sugar - 3 T butter - 1 large egg Pears: - 3 cups water - 1 cup sugar - squeeze of lemon juice - 3 large firm Bosc pears, pealed, halved and cored Order of Operations: - Crust: process salt, almonds and powdered sugar until fine. Add butter and blend. Add in egg yolk. Then pulse in flour until dough clumps. Gather into ball and flatten into disc. Wrap in saran wrap. Chill in freezer until ready to put into pan (1 hour). Almond filling: Grind almonds and flour. Mix in remainder of filling ingredients and process until smooth. Transfer to the fridge. Poach pears: Peel, halve and core the pears (easier to do this before they are poached) and let bubble away in the poaching liquid for up to a half hour, until they are tender to the fork. No need to chill them afterward. Par bake crust: Preheat oven to 375. Use hands to press the chilled crust into the tart pan, using the saran wrap to prevent hands from sticking. Make the bottom crust thin, the sides twice as thick. Flute the edges if you like cute things. Pierce crust all over with a fork. Freeze for 10 minutes. Place tart on a cookie sheet. Put foil into the crust, fill with beans, ensure the edges are covered and par-bake for 10 minutes. Assemble and bake: Reduce heat to 350. Pull out beans. Trim the center out of the foil to cover the edges of the tart. Put in the filling and sliced pears as indicated (mine FILLED the pan, almost no filling was showing). Bake with edges covered for 55 minutes. Perfection!

I followed the directions exactly and it did not turn out well. The crust was burned and crumbly and overcooked. I used canned pears and I think fresh would make it taste much more fresh and flavorful. I will try again but reduce cooking time and prebaking time and definitely use fresh pears.

I have made this more times than I can remember. I receive rave reviews and will continue making this wonderful and beautiful dessert.

Excellent recipe! I just made this tart yesterday and it's become one of my favourite tart recipes. Great crust as i didn't change any thing from the recipe, it was so buttery and with the creamy flavour from almond. To make this recipe healthier and lighter I used only 1/4 cup sugar for the syrup and I also used juice and zest from a whole lemon to add more flavour to the syrup, it turned out really good with a touch of fresh lemon scent, bringing out the flavour of pears unreservedly. As to the filling I reduced sugar by 2 tbsps as it turned out excellent and matched perfectly with pears. The tart was a hit in my family and I will definitely make it again!

I made this for Christmas and it was a huge hit. My modifications to the recipe and notes are: Crust - perfect as is - no changes other than only prebaking for 20 minutes and then covering it during baking with tinfoil strips. AS far as the filling goes - I doubled the almond cream recipe as I like more custard. For the pears: I made brandied pears at Thanksgiving so that I could use them later for tarts, etc. they were amazing on this tart. other than that, i followed the recipe as written. Completely delicious and elegant.

Made this for Thanksgiving. It was a hit. I made a trial run before dinner to see if it needed to be "twinked". The crust was too hard with the original recipe. I baked it for only 10 minutes before adding the filling. Like one of the other reviewers, I pressed it out in the tart pan, forked it and put in the frezzer for one hour. I used bartlett pears as they were the only type that were ripe enough and fanned out the pears over the entire tart. Boiled down the pear syrup to about 2 cups and brushed some of it over the tart when it finished baking. The changes made it perfect and it will become a favorite!! Don't forget to top with real whipped cream.

I've made this many times and most their is always something wrong with the crust. I never follow other peoples suggestions because I think I'm good at pastry. FORGET THAT. Read what the others have suggested about the crust and follow it.

This is a lovely tart. Fairly easy to make and very pretty. I liked the fact that all three parts are made ahead and then assembled at the last minute. Based on earlier reviews I cut the butter back in the crust to 8 tablespoons and it was still rich and delicious. My crust did begin to burn in the blind bake stage. It does not need as much time as the recipe calls for. 20 minutes total was probably sufficient. I had to cover the edges during the main cook time to prevent burning. I also only baked the filling for 45 minutes and it was completely set.

Please don't add almond extract to this. It would overpower and ruin the suble pairing of the almonds and pears. This recipe is perfect as is. Follow the directions and you won't fail.

Absolutely delicious! The taste of the pears, almonds and powdered sugar with all resonant. Loved it and will make it again.

oh my. this IS insanely buttery and rich. just had my first slice and can almost feel the cholesterol coursing thru my veins. i love the frangipane, especially that which is so nicely browned where the pears aren't. i used 2 1/2 bartletts, which i did't weigh, but they must have been larger than 7 oz. each, b/c they took up almost the entire tart pan, leaving only peeks of frangipane. i followed the recipe almost to the letter (added wine to the poaching liq., and 1/2 tsp. almond extract to the filling) and it is definitely time consuming, but not difficult. i recommend putting foil on the bottom of your oven, b/c the butter will leak.

Alright, I made this twice. It's a really good IDEA, but this second time around I made some changes, as the recipe itself is not so good. The crust-filling ratio is exaggerated. I used 1/3 less crust. Also, I used more almonds, so as to have even more flavour. And thirdly, if you don't bake it all that much, you'll end up with a creamy (rather then stiff) filling, unlike the one shown in the picture. It looks duller, because it doesn't puff or caramelizes  again, unlike in the picture; but the texture is much more delicate.

I doubled this recipe to make two tarts. I didn't grind the almonds finely enough, if I made it again I would try to make more of an almond paste. Good cold with coffee.

Rating: 3
Very good, but I would recommend a few modifications based on my experience. First, add a bit of almond extract to the filling. Second, you can pat in the crust instead of rolling it out. Third, and most important, next time I won't pre-bake the crust. I cut the pre-baking time and kept it covered the whole time, and the crust still way over-browned. Lesson learned.

Okay all the people that said this recipe was horrid or didnt work are just idiots- I am sitting here eating my second piece of this tart and frankly could quite easily and happily finish the entire thing! It is a great tart- the pastry is lovely and shortbreadlike- yes I did cover the edges with foil but it wasnt burnt or overcooked in any way. The filling is lovely and the pears so soft and yummy- it looks gorgeous with minimal work. .Really dont understand what people could find wrong with this- I would defintaely make this again and now I am off to get a third piece that I shoulnt have!

I followed the recipe to the letter but made it in individual 4inch wide flan cases as my client wanted individual desserts. It worked very well. I didn't put any almond essence in and was glad i didn't because I didn't want the taste of the pear to be wiped out. I also liked the fact that you can make a lot of the different elements in advance. We can't get Bosc pears in England so I used ripe green williams pears and they tasted great. I served at room temperature with single cream.

I added 1/4 tsp almond extract to the filling. I didn't care for this too much warm or room temp, but I did like it chilled - the flavors were better and the butteriness of the crust was balanced.

omg. this is sooo good. this was my first pear tart. i tried it 3 times over the christmas-new years break. huge hit. it's a little time consuming to cook each part, but worth every bite. i gave in and bought a real tart dish with the removable bottom and baking beads. my kids like to cook with me. it was fun to teach them how to roll out the dough.

The crust is WAY too buttery and it overpowers the flavor of the almonds. I would make this dessert again but with less butter in the crust, not more than 6 or 7 tablespoons (the recipe calls for 9).

Rating: 4
This recipe was great. I used canned Bartlett pears to save some time and added a splash of almond extract to the almond filling. I also covered the whole top with a spiral of the pears, so that the slices of the tart could be as large or small as wanted. Served with vanilla ice cream. Was very rich and filling but delicious. I will definitely be making again in the future.

I made this a second time with some modifications. I used a less buttery crust recipe as the filling is rich enough. I added some almond and a splash of orange extract to the filling and cut the sugar by 2 tbls as I found he original version a bit sweet for my taste. I also poached the pears in champagne as I had some left over from the previous evening. Wonderful and surprising result!

I am a Personal Chef and I needed an emergency dessert for a client of mine for a lunch gathering and search the web for an Almond Pear Tart and found this AMAZING, EASY, and YUMMY tart. The guest loved it. I served it with macerated mixed berries (Used a Moscat) and whipped cream!!! What a delight. I give this a 9.5 out of 10! (A tip: I added almond essence to the cooling pears so that the pears would have the almond taste too!)) Enjoy this one, it is worth it!

Delicious. I especially loved the buttery almond crust. I used whole rather than blanched almonds, reduced the amount of sugar for poaching the pears, and added 1/2 tsp of almond extract to the filling. Served warm with a dollop of ice cream it is my new favourite comfort food.

Having lived in France for many years, I have to say that this recipe is very much the real deal... I make a couple of modifications to mine however and I poach my pears in red wine and I add a little bit of almond essence or amaretto or other almond liquor to the almond paste. Always a huge success with my guests.

Agree with reviewers who counsel a 10- or 11-inch pan, and to use foil lest the edges over-crisp. My only beef with the recipe lies in the image: 1/6 of this tart (as implied by the images as being the serving size) is twice the size diners can handle due to its richness. I also ran the numbers for nutritional values, and can attest that 1/12 of the tart is sufficient, calorie- etc.-wise.

I was really torn about rating this recipe, so allow me to explain. Appearance: 4 forks. Crust and filling: 1 fork. I never mind lengthy recipes, but given the result, I was shockingly disappointed. First of all, the crust was terribly thick. I recommend using an 11-inch pan instead of the 9-incher in the recipe. Second, my crust was overdone. I followed the directions to a T, and my oven is quite accurate, but the temperature (or time?) was way too much! Even if it were perfectly done, the filling was so uninspiring. There was absolutely nothing enticing about it. The pears were delicious, of course--and by the way, it's imperative that you use smallish ones, because my mediums were too big. Those pears were just about the only delicious things in this recipe. I was very disappointed. I tested it to see if I wanted to make it part of a holiday gift this year, but I definitely won't be doing that. Given the amount of steps involved and the unimpressive result, the only way I'll try this one again is with a store-bought crust and canned pears when I'm feeling really desperate.

This was delicious. I toasted the almonds before grinding them, but I might not do that next time.

I made this tart with a slighly different crust, an easy French recipe of mine which requires no rolling: mix 1 cup flour, 5 tbsp. powdered sugar, pinch salt. Cut in 6 tbsp. cold butter, work quickly with fingertips until mixture resembles fine meal. Add 1 egg, well beaten, and mix with a fork. Then simply press the dough into the tart pan with your fingers. Freeze for one hour, then bake with foil and weights for 20 minutes. Remove foil and bake another 10 minutes. I also used canned pears but realised that the quality of the canned pears really counts!Next time I'll buy a better brand, the cheapo brand didn't have enough taste. I used already ground almonds (saves some time...) and added - essential! - almond extract to the cream. Without the extract, the almond cream was indeed a bit bland. I also reduced baking time to 30 mintues once the filling and pears were in, and powdered the tart with a pouch of vanilla sugar once out of the oven. It really came out fantastic and that all-butter crust that requires no rolling has made my baking life so much more pleasant! In one evening, my husband ate half of the tart...

I made this one when i lived in france. it burned a bit, so i'd be careful next time on the crust...its labor intensive if you use fresh pears, but its meant to be what the article states, a rustic french dessert, and it is. and I heard a lot of "tres tres bonne", and "ah..j'adore le poire". as soon as it gets labor intensive, it loses the point of the idea of a fruit tart-ease.

Rating: 4
I've made this tart many times now. It is time consuming, but worth the effort. But the flavors are great - very subtle. Not a truly sweet dessert - highly complemented by French friends who said it was like home and not a gooey sweet American dessert. I did have to make sure the crust didn't burn, so appreciated the comments on shorter baking times and foil.

Rating: 4
I have been making this tart since it came out in the magazine. It is fantastic! I simplify by using drained, canned pear halves that I set in a pan with a mixture of the pear liquid and white wine. Let it soak overnight - it is SO much easier than poaching fresh pears and they are very easy to cut into thin slices to fan out. Other than that, I follow the recipe as given - very easy. It is totally delicious - the taste of the pears blends perfectly with the almond cream filling.

I don't think I've ever seen a recipe on Epicurious with so many conflicting reviews! Easy prep vs. time consuming, flavorful vs. bland. Had a dinner party last night, so I decided to roll the dice and make this for dessert. I have to agree with the other negative reviewers - I made the recipe exactly as stated, poaching the pears and used the almond crust. I thought it was a time-intensive recipe with a fairly bland, albeit pretty, end result. Try this trick for fanning the pear - slice the pear on a piece of waxed paper, pick it up under the paper and flip it over into the palm of your hand and gently fan it into shape. Then just slide it into the filling mixture. (It's difficult to move the pear around on the filling once it's placed). Maybe with some of the flavor additions suggested by other reviewers, this would rate higher in my opinion.

This tart was delicious! I added a tablespoon of Grand Mariner to the filling and it worked out great! Also, I substituted the lemon juice for a table spoon of raspberry wine vinegar - my pears retained alot of flavour this way. My only complaint would be the crust. I halved the pre-baking time and it still managed to burn and crack! Next time I would choose simple crust as I dont think it gives much needed flavour anyway. Can't wait to make this again! Please think about working on the crust before cooking this tart.

Made this in an 8" tart pan and the almond paste was a much nicer consistency. The filling came to the edge of the pears and it was light. I covered the crust with foil to keep it from burning. I serve this warm with vanilla ice cream.

This was just ok. I was glad that I read the reviews before making it. Based on what other people said, I cut back the cooking time and covered the edge of the tart with foil. It was still slightly over-cooked. The almond filling was just ok. I used Bosc pears, like the recipe calls for and they were tasty, but I think I would use even more pears if I were to make it again (doubtful). It was very impressive to look at, however.

Warning---the baking time on this recipe is excessive! Thirty minutes of baking the crust, then nearly an hour of baking the filled tart? On paper it seems excessive and in practice many cooks will end up (like I did) with a burnt crust. Cut the baking time in half and you will get closer to the desired result. I wouldn't complain if it weren't the fact that this recipe is time- and labor-intensive and the baking time is such an glaring problem in this recipe as presented.

Beautiful looking dessert, but was a bit disappointed by the lack of almond flavor. I was hoping for a stronger almond presence. Regarding the crust, I had no problems at all with the times dictated in the recipe, although I did make sure I used a shiny metal tart pan and not a darkened one (which will help to brown the crust prematurely). Also, I love the idea of using the poaching liquid as a bar mixer...very creative and an inventive use of the leftovers. Pouring that syrup down the drain almost broke my heart...

This tart was excellent. It's a good idea to poach the pears and make the filling a day ahead. I poached the pears according to the recipe but next time I would add a cinnamon stick, nutmeg and cloves to the poaching liquid.

I had real trouble with the crust. The rest of it was easy with canned pears. The crust is extremely delicate! I buttered the foil, it still stuck. After removing it, the crust browned REALLY fast. I tented it for the remaining hour of baking, but I still ended up slicing off the top little bit. Still, my crust crumbled along the edges quite a bit! This was for a gift, so it doesn't look so pretty, but I'm anxious to make it again with all the ideas I've seen here!

Making this tart is a bit of work but well worth the effort. I've used canned pears both times; "marinating" the pears in a ginger syrup the second time. I also reduced the marinade after straining the pears and reduced it to a very thick syrup which I brushed on the pears after baking. Really good!

Wow, this was easy, and delicious. I made my normal recipe for pate brisee (without almonds). I made the pears and the filling, and it was great. For once I was as impressed as my guests. The only thing I would do differently next time is to grind the almonds powder fine, and I will definitely try the crust. Do make this, it's easy and well worth it.

I have to agree with the Cook from Florham Park, NJ about the overbaked crust. That is my one negative criticism of this recipe. Even though I shielded the edge with foil, the crust became very dark while the filling baked for the required time to set. Next time I will not prebake it for as long as directed by the recipe. My family and guests raved about this tart. I am glad I made two because everyone asked for seconds!

Closer to two-and-a-half-fork dish. Not very hard to make (good directions for fanning the pears) and very nice-looking, and I really liked the almond filling. The pears have to be very ripe and fragrant, however, or else it loses something. I wonder how this would be with sweet cherries. . . .
