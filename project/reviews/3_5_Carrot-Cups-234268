I really liked this recipe. I would add a bit less sugar next time because it came just a shade too close to a dessert taste. I also used some fresh grated ginger which I felt really added to it. I think next time to make it a bit less sweet and more savory I will cut down the sugar by half and add a bit of white pepper as well as fresh ginger. My seder guests loved this as is though.

Just OK...not that special. There are other recipes I'd choose instead of this one.

This recipe has been a hit at my seder two years running. Going to have to come up with something new next year because everyone has asked for the recipe. Use the coated mini muffin tins -- perfect size and no sticking issues.

What a great way to add color, freshness and a tiny hint of citrus to our Passover table. We all loved these! p.s. I avoided the sticky problem by greasing the tins with Crisco.

These taste great and I'm excited to serve them with my brisket for Passover. My only problem was that they stuck a bit to the muffin pan. Next time I might try using cooking a little longer or using muffin/cupcake cups.

These look like a great vegetable addition to my seder ........ Can they be frozen .........

What can be substituted for Matzo meal and potato starch? I am not familiar with these ingredients?

This wonderful side was a highlight of our first night Passover Seder - 20 college kids as guests who actually "ate their vegetables" and took home extras as leftovers. Experienced cooks agreed this was a year round winner for any occasion!!

I've got my second batch of these delicious carrot cups in the oven. I loved the light texture of them. I used a little lemon zest instead of orange. Also, they don't spread out when baking, so when you spoon them into the muffin cup smooth out the tops. Otherwise a delicious and light addition to our passover dinner. I'll make these year round.

These were easy and delicious. I added half a teaspoon of fresh grated ginger, and the results were great!
