I'm not a huge fan of green beans, but I had some I needed to use from my CSA, along with quite a lot of arugula, so this recipe was perfect. I agree that it needs more zest and garlic and I think that red pepper flakes would certainly add more interest. Delicious!

Very good and very simple.

...got cut off before finishing... Anyway, I added extra zest and garlic, and started the saute process with 1/2 teaspoon of red chili flakes to spice things up a bit. Also, to help wilt the arugula a bit faster I added a teaspoon or two of teriyaki. It provided an extra layer of flavor and salt to kick up the seasoning. I've made this twice in the past week already - my family loves it!

So easy, so fresh. Really enjoyed this!

Unfortunately I didn't have any arugula so I had to leave it out, but it was yummy even without it! Definitely want to try it with based on other reviews though. Also add a bit extra of all the seasoning, but I love lots of flavor. Served with swordfish and the parsley leaf potatoes, also from this site (check those out-simple and beautiful!).

Loved this recipe! I did add a small amount of soy sauce and a bit of extra lemon zest. It was delicious. we ate it up so fast it was gone immediately. One thing I would do differently next time is add more arugula, it reduced so quick to almost nothing and that was the tastiest part.

Followed the recipe as written and it came out great. Just added the arugula at the end and stirred through until barely wilted. Arugula was not too bitter. Unfortunately, my beans were tough, but that was the fault of the variety I bought, not the recipe. I'd definitely make this again.

I just made this recipe on the weekend. It was very good, but I found I had to spice it up a bit! I added sauteed sliced amonds, 5 cloves of garlic, soy sauce, touch of balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper! It really tasted unique with the wilted arugula and almonds! All of it went, and I would definately make it again!

I love this recipe. I find greenbeans on their own to be OK, but adding the arugula, lemon, and garlic make this something special. I'll look forward to making this again.

This is a wonderful side to the Grilled Salmon with Lime Butter Sauce. I made the Grilled Corn With Herbs on this menu too. It was a purely delectable meal. This menu will impress anyone and will work as a go-to favorite meal for my friends and family. A definite keeper!

My arugula dried up too much, but nonetheless, it added great flavor to the green beans. It's a really simple and great way to enjoy a veggie side dish.

Lots of green beans in my CSA box recently. This was a different way to use them. I used only half the arugula and carefully trimmed thick stems (forewarned). Everyone liked it.

Easy and great way to use up argula from the garden (so it doesn't get old and bitter). It adds a lovely nutty flavour to the beans and complements the zest and garlic. Will make again.

Loved the green beans, garlic and zest, but the bitterness of the arugula completely overpowered the dish. I was surprised by this because normally we like arugula. However, I admit that the problem may have arisen because I cheated and used a bag of precut leaves and didn't cut off the stems.
