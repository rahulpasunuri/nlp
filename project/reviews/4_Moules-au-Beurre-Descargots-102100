Splendid - and so easy on a rotten rainy night. I'm floating on a fragrant garlic cloud. Only suggestion is to decrease salt. I used salted butter and suggested 1 t salt - and it was excessive. Used 2 lbs mussels for 2 persons, same amount of sauce as given - and have very little left over. What can I do with remainng sauce? So good. Ah, I know! Pasta tomorrow!

I agree with a previous reviewer regarding the garlic. 16 cloves ? How small were they ? I had 10 and it still was overpowering, and I LOVE garlic... Maybe a touch of lemon (zest, juice ?) would tone down the pungency without compromising on flavour. I used white wine also, which I prefer to Pernod. I didn't rate this recipe since the clams didn't turn out the way I expected it to, it was almost like they weren't cooked. And I followed the roasting pan bit, with the foil cover, and the temp, and everything. I just ended up throwing everything out. I'll have to try it again to be sure of my rating.

This was a lovely recipe. I made this recipe, on top of the stove, in the same manner. I cooked them on medium high heat for 10minutes. The sauce tasted like the lovely dish of Escargot that we have had many times in Paris. I will definitely make this recipe again. It was a little piece of Paris, right here in Holland! Yummy

What a wonderful and incredibly easy entree to prepare. I used a bit of my cook's intuition and made the following changes. I'm truly a garlic lover, but I thought that 16 cloves was a little overkill. I used 10, and believe me, there was puhlenty o' garlic flavor! I also used white wine as opposed to the Pernod (and that was because I had no Pernod in the house). I also reduced the salt to a rounded quarter teaspoon. Finally my method of roasting was not in a foil overed roasting pan. I used my heavy Le Creuset pot. I figured that a heavier cooking vessel such as Le Creuset would need extra time to get hot in the oven, so I roasted at 500º, and let it go for 15 minutes. Highly recommended dish- - -I've met Michael Roberts when he was the proprietor of the Los Angeles restaurant called Trumps. He was a very kind and worldy gentlemen. It was sad to have learned of his passing.

I make this every year on Christmas Eve, the entire family loves them. Cook in a large covered pot on stove, it works just as well.

Hey Kalamazoo, I ate some for you! These were very very good, although mine needed more than 10 minutes. More like 15 or even a little more to open up. My husband wasn't so crazy about the sweetness that the Pernod added, but we both enjoyed them very much. My only caveat is that I think its easier to cook mussels where you can see if they are opening or not (steaming, etc.).

I was too lazy to find Pernod, so I used a 1/2 cup of white wine. They were the best mussels I have ever had...and it was so easy.

Easy and delicious.

This recipe is very very easy and absolutely superb as an appetizer for approximately 8. I made this exactly as the recipe suggests and the aroma drew my neighbor across the yard and into my kitchen to "sample one or two". At a recent dinner party, I made it again, and even those who maintained that they did not like mussles liked these. Fabulous.

I agree with Sue from Florida. I made this with snails-on-sale and it was flawless. Going out to buy Mussels tomorrow as I drank a half bottle of Merlot with this myself for supper tonight. The Mussels will be tomorrow night's supper. Saver for sure.

I made this as an appetizer for eight of us this past weekend, it flew! I doubled the mussels but tripled the sauce, it was so very good and so very easy!

This makes me cry. Last New Year's Eve, in Paris, I ate this dish over french fries--it was called moules frites. It was beyond compare. It was without a doubt the best thing I've ever eaten. Like an American pig I ate a whole giant Le Creuset full. Afterwards, I felt slightly sick. I figured it was overindulgence--champagne, all those wonderful butter-soaked fries and mussels. C'est bon! Back in America, I ordered the same thing again, went home, and became violently ill. Turns out I have a late-developing allergy to shellfish. At any rate, I made this dish for my mother and boyfriend, substituting good thick fries for the bread. They devoured it, in silence, while I looked on, ate fries and ketchup, and cried. Try this with fries. Eat it for me. It is magnificent.

The butter sauce is AMAZING! I made this recently and can't wait to make it again - I'm going to try the sauce on shrimp and scallops and I am sure it will be outstanding.

I used snails and they were wonderful-the flavors all blended together and just lit up in my mouth. Even our kids tried the snails and now they consider them a special treat.

I made a variation of this recipe. I subsituted escargot for the mussells. It was delightful. Serve with crusty bread to scoop up the flavorings.
