We didn't find the cake too salty (though I did cut the salt back to 1 tsp even before reading the reviews). We loved the powerful ginger/peppery flavor, however, we found the cake really dry. I even took the cake out 10 minutes early and it already seemed overbaked. The cake definitely needs more moisture and/or fat. I'm wondering what @figleaves will do - please update us with your changes and results!

I found this recipe most intriguing so could not wait to make it for company. I used only 1/2 tsp. salt and used maple syrup instead of the light molasses. It was moist and delicious - especially with the Luscious Chocolate Icing. My company requested the recipe!

I made this as written with some small substitutions of necessity: uncrystallized candied ginger, whole grain Dijon mustard, and dark molasses. I made and used the chocolate icing. The three layers of ginger were wonderful and the tart cherries a delicious surprise. I did not find it too salty at all. My only complaint was that the cake was drier than I would like, so I would try to improve that next time.

I was looking forward to this cake. All the ingredients sounded like a good combinationexcept the salt. Fearlessly, I decided not to second guess the recipe and sure enough the cake is too salty. I wonder if 1.5 teaspoons of Kosher salt in a cake was a typo.
