wow-kids ate it all! I've done halloumi before, but combining it with the lemony peas & beans salad was a great contrast. I used fresh fava beans, which took quite a while to prepare because of the second peeling process, and produced fewer finished beans than I was hoping for. I had a little leftover kale, so used about a 1/2 cup of chopped kale to fill in the salad--it was great.

Loved this...it was fresh and creamy at the same time. Would for sure make it again.

I've made this salad a bunch of times, with various alterations. I can't always get fava beans (even frozen), so I've substituted baby limas, haricot vert, and peas for them. But the basic combo of sauteed greens, lemon, mint, and crisp/melty halloumi is definitely a winner!

I thought this was easy, but just ok in the end. Perhaps my nonstick pan wasn't what it should have been, but without oil, the cheese stuck to the pan terribly. Also, even though served immediately, by the time I was done eating it, the cheese had cooled to a rubbery consistency that was unappealing. However, the flavor of the cheese was good, and the accompanying salad was really very tasty.

I used to live in Carbondale-- that cheese is probably hard to find there! This is a nice summer meal along with some watermelon.

Excellent, easy and different. Had a hard time finding the Halloumi cheese, but so glad I did.Followed the recipe exactly and this was a big hit with my guests. Be sure the fava beans are doubled -peeled if frozen. What a nice change for a salad. The cheese is wonderful.
