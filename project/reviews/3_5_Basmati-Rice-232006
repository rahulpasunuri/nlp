I have used this recipe countless times as I've made a dent in my 10 lb bag of rice. For additional flavor, I simmer saffron threads first then add the water to the rice along with thinly sliced garlic clove(s). Delicious!

Not the perfect recipe others seem to have found. Ours turned out sticky, like sushi rice. Took a previous reviewer's suggestion of sauteeing chopped apricot and dates, along with freshly shelled peas, and stirred these in once rice had been removed, covered, from the stove, for a lovely touch.

I used chicken stock instead of water and it turned out very well. I also used the leftover rice for stirfried rice.

It is a good rice recipe. I folded in fresh cilantro and lemon zest at the end for a great flavor.

Ridiculous that I have been so stupid for so long. If I had known that this SIMPLE and PERFECT YIELDING RESULT recipe was on here I would have saved myself lots of embarassment.

I always struggle with rice. It usually turns out sticky for me. I have a hard time finding the right heat level on my ceramic stove top (hate these), which always stays too hot after reaching the initial boil point. One of my guests told me her secret was to remove the pot from the heat after reaching the boiling and just leaving it to sit covered for the remaining 20 minutes. For the 1st time in my life (and I'm pretty old...), my rice turned out perfect. I will always prepare it this way from now on.

This is my first time making Basmati rice, so I decided to follow the recipe exactly. The rice turned out wonderfully, very fragrant and not sticky at all! The rice was just a little damp at the bottom of the small nonstick saucepan I used to cook it, but it wasn't a big deal since more moisture evaporated as it cooled.

This is the only way to make Basmati Rice. We love to cook spicy curry dishes and this is the best basmati rice I have ever made to accompany.

I have always made basmati this way (with a little more water), and it turns out great. Frying the rice in butter gives it more flavour and keeps it from sticking together

Perfect. I purchased basmati in bulk and the directions on the bag made the rice sticky which I don't like. This tastes great, and I'm sure it would work without butter.

Basmati rice is unique in that it keeps its form, is aromatic, and mixes well with other ingredients. My best experience with this rice is that you rinse the rice well and soak overnight. (If you are very short on time, soak at least 1 hour). Then prepare a pan of boiling water. Boil the rice for only 5 minutes. Drain. Then add some butter to the pan (preferable a wide pan, add a little chicken boillion powder mixed with the butter, and mix the rice well. Immediated turn the heat to the lowest setting. Place a kitchen towel around the pan cover and steam the rice for 30 minutes. Your rice will be perfect with a slightly crunchy bottom layer. You can remove that layer, or mix it in with the rice. I sometimes add chopped apricots or dates, sauteed in the butter before the rice is steamed. I also sprinkle green pistachio nuts on top when serving. The measures are about 1/2 cup of dry rice per serving. And I usually prepare a minimum of 2 cups of dry rice per session. Enjoy.

boil the rice till slightly hard then in a 4 qt. pot pour a little olive oil,slice peeled potatoes thin and coat the bottom of pot with them do not layer them.fry till lightly golden Then pour the rice in after a slight draining[do not rinse] make a well in the middle and pour a little fresh saffron threads mixed in with a little water .Do not pack in,cover and let simmer if it needs a little water pour in .after 20 minutes the extra moisture in the rice will add moisture to the rice.the special reward at the serving part is the fried potatoes will mix in with the rice and only enhance flavors. I sometimes serve this with a sprinkle of romano or reggiano parmagiano cheese. its wonderful

I have always used the traditional soaking method but my rice seemed dry. This way I felt was so much better and my rice was so moist yet separated. I have done it twice this way and I won't change. Try it, your'll like it!

I have made Basmati rice for a long time. All I do is rinse through a strainer until the water runs clear. I put the rice in a pot and double the the measurement for the water. I add 1/2 cube of butter, salt to taste. I also add a teaspoon of both basil and parsley and 1/2 tsp of tarragon. Bring to boil over medium heat cover ( about 10 min.) and simmer for anouther 10 min.
