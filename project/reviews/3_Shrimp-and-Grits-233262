This is not my favorite shrip grits recipe. I hope that no one actually uses that disgusting hillshire farms sausage. That is really the bottom of the barrel for sausage. Surprised that epicurious would recommend it. I don't really like the green pepper in this. I don't think that I will make it again.

We didn't have bell peppers around, so we threw in a big chopped tomato just before serving, and it was great! Good, easy comfort food.

Wonderful, simply southern dish! The only change I make is substituting 1 cup of milk when making the grits. This makes them nice and creamy.

Nothing too special, but very quick and very easy. Needs some garlic for extra flavor, and I agree that more hot links would be good. Otherwise, a solid dish and great comfort food.

This is a great simple recipe, but I make it with a few alterations, based on something similar I had in Apalachiacola. I make the shrimp and sausage separate, so they maintain their individual flavors, and I add cheddar cheese to the grits. I omit the onion, pepper, and flour, and instead make a simple sweet cream with by simmering whipping cream with a few tbls of Ouzo, which imparts a delightful fennel flavor to the dish. Assemble in a deep bowl with cheese grits on bottom, shrimp & sliced sausage on top, then pour the sweet cream over the whole thing, and garnish with chopped scallions and ample paprika. Beautiful!

Delicious, easy and flavorful. Good, hearty comfort food in cold weather. I use almost the whole package of Hot Links, and 2 lbs. of 31-40/lb shrimp so they cook up bite size; no knife needed for eating. All 3 of my kids love this, and it is always my 17yr old son's answer when I ask "What should I make for dinner?". Granted, we're not southerners, but this Philly family loves this recipe. We eat any leftover grits for breakfast the next morning.

MUCH better when made with shrimp stock and a little cream. Also, regular grits don't take much longer to cook than instant and are INFINITELY better!!!
