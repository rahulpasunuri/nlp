I can get my 6 year old granddaughter to clean her room with no complaint and uncharacteristic speed by promising to make this dish. Enough said;).

we loved this recipe! we doubled it as it says it only makes 3 cups, but we found that each batch made about 6. we added some red pepper flakes for added 'punch' and served over rice, with parmesean cheese on top. next time i'll add mushrooms, too. a keeper!

Got some eggplant from a coworker's garden and decided to try this one out. I was very pleasantly surprised. It took a little longer than I would have liked (a little over an hour start to finish) but it was worth it. I salted for a half hour and squeezed the eggplant before using (took a little jog while I waited), and replaced the green capsicum with red because that's what I had at home (and I like it better anyway). Also used balsamic because, again, it's what I had. Added a little bit of red wine when I added the vinegar because I find that wine always makes stuff taste better. Sprinkled reduced fat feta cheese on it before baking. Ate it with fresh baguette dipped in olive oil and balsamic with a glass of the same wine added during cooking. Voilá! According to my calorie count app, each serving (assume made 4) has just shy of 200 calories.

I salted and drained the eggplant then rinsed and squeezed in layers of paper towels. Followed the recipe and finished in oven with parmesan cheese on top.

Despite the time spent chopping, this dish was great and I got my husband to finally eat eggplant! I added some oregano and some hot chilli flakes for heat.

This was A LOT of chopping. The flavor was pretty good, but I will add a sprinkling of chopped dried oregano next time to give it a bit more character

Mine seemed a little too thick, so I added one can of tomato paste. It was wonderful, even without the optional cheese. A great alternative main dish for vegetarians!

Hubby and I didn't care for it. Better ratatouille recipes out there.

I don't understand the loast post. Since non of the vegetable are to be peeled the only peeling would be of the onion. How time comsuming could that be

I guess this is quick as far as ratatouille goes, but it still takes quite a while to peel all those veggies. The results are definitely good, but given the amount of dicing and peeling involved, I'd probably skip making it on a work night again.

This is a classic ratatoulle recipe. I just sprinkle feta chees on the hot ratatoulle and it was very tasty. I used balsamic vinegar and it was good, but I am not sure it made that much difference.

If you have a lot of miscellaneous veggies, and you don't know what to do with them... make this! You will be pleased - it's versatile and can be paired with pasta, rice, potatoes... I did the saute with the red wine vinegar, but didn't think it had enough pizaz so I added some balsamic to liven it up. I didn't bake it, or had fresh basil (forced to use dry), and it was still scrumptious!

I combined this recipe with another favorite of ours - Ratatouille from Gourmet, June of 1991. We all loved the addition of the red wine vinegar in this recipe. I also use green tomatoes, along with the red, when we have extra in our garden. You might want to check the Gourmet recipe - the addition of oregano, thyme, coriander, and fennel gives a great flavor. I have served this cold, at room temperature, and warm - all with equally good results. Like the cook from Denver, I wish it took less time, but the fact that it can be made 2 to 3 days in advance is the big plus for me!

This was a good ratatouille and I'll make it again, but it wasn't as quick as I was hoping it would be.
