I printed this recipe out many years ago and have made them every Christmas since and sometimes in between. They are easy to make and very festive. They just looked liked you fussed but can do them quickly. I double the filling recipe as I never seem to have enough. Other than that I make as is (unless I only have pecans and they still taste great!)

I have a similar family recipe and we have made them for so many years. I think my mom and grandma were making them before I was born. I would recommend them for any occasion or a bake sale.

A classic! I have made these for many, many years every Christmas (with chopped pecans). Be sure to press the pastry into the tins to form a very thin crust.

I too have made these every year since the recipe was first published - originally made it true to the recipe and loved them but found the dough a little tough to work with. Recently started adding 1 egg yolk to the recipe (which I double) and now find the dough very easy to work with.

I am an old neighbor of Stephanie's. I was 10 and loved to stop by during the holidays to get a nut cup! After many years, I finally got the recipe. Everyone wants the recipe and asks for more nut cups after a taste... This recipe brings back many wonderful memories stopping by to get a sample of her cooking, which is terrific! These are now a Holiday favorite!

Mrs. Schrader was my neighbor growing up. As a 10 year old child, Christmas was made ever so sweeter with these nut cups!! I couldn't wait for her to bake these! After 30 years of asking, I finally got the recipe and make them every year to rave reviews. These are the BEST! We are so lucky she shared the recipe! p.s. We still keep in touch!

Make these every year for Christmas gift-giving. I have used both pecans and walnuts - either one works beautifully.

I made these with pecans for a baby shower and they're soooo delicious. My only mistake was to smush the shells down to be level with the filling, don't know what I was thinking, but a lot of them exploded over the edges. A little time-consuming but worth it.

My friend Mary made these for me and they were so yum! She made it looked really pretty by shaking some powdered sugar after they finished baking. They are just delicious!

I make these cookies every year and give away at Christmas time. Everybody always loves them but I use pecans instead of walnuts.

I love this recipe. The only change I made was to toast the walnuts before chopping as it REALLY adds a great dimension. It is also very forgiving...different size tins work well - just watch your baking time. Also get rave reviews.

These cookies were great. Very easy to make. I doubled the filling recipe and used regular size muffin pans. For an added touch I used a heart shaped muffin tin and they still came out wonderful. Since I used bigger muffin cups I used more nuts. The bigger size made about 244 cookies. i

I make a lot of cookies all year round. This happens to be one of the family favorites - I always double the recipe.

Made this recipe last Christmas and it was a big hit with everyone. Will definately be making it again this year.... takes a little effort but is definately worth it. I made them in a mini-muffin pan and it worked well.

I have a similar recipe to this one which uses just 1 cup of flour in the pastry instead of 1 1/2 cups. I think it tastes better - less 'doughy'. Also, if you use two 12 capacity mini-muffin pans & make 24 walnut cups, the filling goes round perfectly. Both recipes are great & SO easy to do. Always get rave reviews. And they pop out of the ungreased muffin pans so neatly. A definite 'keeper'.

This is the third year in a row that I have made these. They take a long time to make, but are the most delicious Christmas cookies ever. However, I always need twice as much filling as the recipe calls for.

Delicious. Tasted great after 2 months in the freezer.

This is better than "Cats". I would eat this again and again.
