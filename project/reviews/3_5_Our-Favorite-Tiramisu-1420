This was delicious, and I used to make it before we were told to avoid raw eggs. But since the custard here isn't cooked, I'm looking for a new tiramisu recipe.

I've made this about 6 times now. My roomate from Italy asked for it to make for his holiday meal, he liked it that much. Y'all can turn your noses up all you want, but it's some good stuff. I use the pack of gelatin softened 10 min in the cold cream, then the vigorous whisking of yolk, cream, + sugar in the double boiler. At no point at any party has there ever been any leftovers. I would only caution to not oversoak the cake because of mushiness, and to let the whole thing sit for at least 24 hours. The reason this one is so good is that unless you have $60 to blow on enough good mascapone and ladyfingers, everyone on a budget can still present a classy delicious dessert for their friends and families. It's really "close enough" and regardless, delicious.

I've been looking for a tiramisu recipe that didn't require mascarpone cheese for the longest time as it is rather expensive here in S'pore. Was delighted when I found this one. It turned out really good - with some help of a little Kahlua! Light & creamy. Will be a regular feature @ my cafe (as it is, many customers have said it was very yummy)!

I always get rave reviews with this recipe. Most people never ask for the recipe, however, because they think it's too hard to make (not true!) I use the gelatin suggestion, as well as add either kalua or amaretto to the coffee for another layer of flavor. I also leave small chunks of chocolate when I'm chopping the chocolate for some crunch (I know it's not traditional, but that's how my husband likes it).

Instructions to firm up custard, some of you are having problems. 1/2 cup cold water or cream, sprinkle an entire packet of unflavored gelatin on top. leave at room temp for 10 minutes. On top of double boiler, mix yolks, sugar, gelatin goo. Whisk vigorously on heat for about 5 minutes till everything turns pale. whisk in vanilla, Continue with recipe. At the double boiler point, you can also use a thermometer to heat the eggs to the temp you consider safe to kill salmonella. All concerns will be solved if you do this. Chill at end least 12 hours for best flavor blending.

I love the flavor of this dish, its very rich and yummy. It does however lend to a pudding-like texture and so I think I'll use more pound cake and less heavy whipping cream to help it stay together better. My co-workers love it too!

The hit of the party! On my first attempt, this was a very delicious cake and it truly was the hit of the party. It wasn't firm enough to cut pretty pieces though. Perhaps whipping the cream until really stiff would help? Otherwise, a great dessert!!!

I've made this recipe numerous times. I've tried it out on different crowds and, invariably, at least one person asks me for the recipe. I always drizzle some Kahlua over the pound cake layer for some extra zip, varying the amount based on the event (more for New Year's Eve dinner). I'll be serving this for years to come because I konw it's sure to please.

As for the reviewer that stated they cooked the eggs 'a bit' (assumingly to prevent Salmonella), unless the temperature reached 140 (or 141 degrees depending upon whom you listen to), all heating them up did was probably accelerate bacteria growth (if there was bacteria present in the first place.) The trick in food prep is to keep cold things cold & hot things hot and cool things down quickly (heating the eggs just served to warm up the dish and keep in within 'bacterial growth' range longer.)

This recipe is absolutely delicious. It came out tasting better than any store-bought Tiramisu that I've found here. Everyone raved about it. It was easy to make and tastes wonderful. I'm making it tonight for our Christmas dinner tomorrow!

Yes, you can definitely freeze tiramisu. I am living in Italy right now, on an exchange program, and one of my Italian roommates and I made tiramisu (not this recipe though.) She said that she always keeps tiramisu in the freezer (but other Italians just put it in the refrigerator) and I know that several people like it colder than the refrigerator makes it.

A delicious recipe - we used light cream cheese (like that helped...), fresh brewed espresso, and made it in two layers. It was delicious. Might try the mascarpone variation, but will not defy my Italian roots by adding gelatin - it set up fine (gelatin - you blaspheme!)

This tiramisu was GREAT! I made it for a dinner party and everyone RAVED about it! Excellent recipe. Be sure to use the mascapone cheese. This comes out very well, and I don't normally even eat desserts. I would definitely make this again.

I've made this many times, but the raw egg thing bothers me so this time I cooked the cream cheese/sugar/egg mixture on the stove top until 170 degrees. I also added half a pack of gelatin, and the difference was significant. It made for a much creamier and plusher custard - more similiar to marscapone than the original. I strongly recommend making this easy changes. This dessert is a winner and very easy. I also soaked the pound cake in strong coffee- no need to buy espresso if you don't have it.

Rating: 3
I made this dessert twice. I used Mascarpone cheese and added the gelatine. The consistency was just right. The first time I made it, I used rum imitation instead of vanilla extract and I also added Khalua to the espresso. I also used ladyfingers instead of the sponge cake. This had much more flavor than the recipe. The chocolate portion was definitely way too much. I cut it in half and was still too much. If you want, you can use cocoa powder instead but I think using real chocolate tastes much better. I will definitely make it again.

Rating: 0
If you do add gelatin and are serving this to guests, make sure all vegetarians know to avoid the dessert. Like many other reviewers, I too prefer an authentic tiramisu made with ladyfingers and mascarpone--and without raw eggs and gelatin.

The gelatin suggestion was great- really firmed up the custard. I threw the chocolate in my coffee grinder and it turned it into a fine powder- looked more like the authentic cocoa for tiramisu but tasted better.

I brought this dessert to a dinner party yesterday and everyone loved it. I avoided using gelatin (don't like the stuff) by making it the day before, cutting back on the cheese/cream mixture and doing three layers rather than a layer of each. I had leftover chocolate, cheese/cream mixture and espresso (to which I had added Kahlua). This will most certainly be asked for again in my family.

This receipe calls for cream cheese, tiramisu should be made with mascarpone cheese, this would firm it up alot and give it better flavor. Also by refrigerating it overnight you can really taste the flavors.

Rating: 3
this was a good recipe. i was unable to find unflavored gelatin so instead i added 4oz more cream cheese and less whipping cream. i took the advice of adding kahlua and that was a nice touch. i found the chocolate overwhelming and crunchy and would probably use powdered cocoa next time around. all in all, a good recipe but needed some tweaking. i also put it in the freezer 15 minutes before serving to solidify it more.

Rating: 4
A great recipe that I will definitely make again! A bunch of reviewers mentioned that their desserts turned out "soupy," as did mine. But, my next-day left-overs were nice and firm. Perhaps the trick is to make the tiramisu a day in advance and let it set in the fridge over night? I'll try that next time, and if that doesn't work, I'll probably go the gelatin route.

Rating: 4
GREAT recipe!! I was a little hesitant but followed some tips of the other reviewers and the dish was a success. I used the geletin but will probably only use half next time, I think it worked too well. Used real espresso, not instant (couldn't find any) and added water and kahlua to it for a great flavor! I was worried about how long to soak the pound cake but just go with your instincts and it will be perfect. Not too mushy or too dry! Can't wait to make it again!

Rating: 4
Fantastic recipe!!! I did as others suggested and added the gelatin -- I think it would have been too runny otherwise. Also tiered the recipe (two layers). Used reduced-fat cream cheese and it was still delicious, so I may look for other ways to cut the fat in the future. May try to add a bit of Kahlua next time to the espresso. I've already had numerous requests for a repeat performance -- definitely going to add this as a permanent fixture to my culinary repertoire.

Worry not about the eggs!! Try Davidson's Pasteurized shell eggs (I don't work for the company). They can be eaten raw - my family has done so for months now - and are perfectly SAFE. For info you can contact them at 1-800-410-7619 or contact website www.Davidsonseggs.com. Our lives were in ruins (no Ceasar salads, meringues, etc.) until these eggs arrived. They are wonderful!!

I tried to follow previous tips by adding gelatin softened with water, but it didn't work. The gelatin became thick and lumpy and didn't set the cream mixture. It ended up lumpy and oozy. I've never worked with gelatin before - any suggestions? While the flavor was good, the presentation was awful.

Tasted like the real thing!!!! Very good recipe but you must add the gelatin and grate the chocolate like other reviews suggested.

Wow! This is really a great dessert. Everyone who tried it like it, and it was eaten in lightening speed. I took the others' advice and added unflavored gelatin (dissolved in a bit of hot water) to the egg and sugar mix. I also chose to layer the desert put cake/chocolate/custard/cake/chocolate/custard/chocolate. It looked very nice in a pretty glass bowl. I also added slivered almonds to the chocolate. Instead of dipping the cake into espresso, I heated hazelnut creamer and some water and mixed in instant coffee. Then I just drizzled it over the slices of cake with a spoon. It tasted really great and was a nice touch. This is a generous recipe and seems to make a lot. I will definitely make this again.

After traveling through Italy and trying Tiramisu at numerous restaurants, I can tell you that this recipe is as good as most, and better than some, "authentic" tiramisus. I also added gelatin, used a double boiler and made it in a trifle bowl. My 10 dinner guests, some of whom were sure they didn't like tiramisu, LOVED it. It was the perfect finish to an Italian dinner. I will definitely do this one again.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe many times and it is always well received. I make it into a trifle and use the gelatin for stability and use hot kahlua instead of hot water to put the espresso in to dissolve. It is super rich and we all love it! This is my extra special dessert!

I have made this recipe many times and everyone loves it. I have used many suggestions from others (ie adding gelatin and using a trifle bowl for a different presentation.) I also have used traditional marscapone as well as cream cheese.

Wonderful Recipe.

This recipe looks WONDERFUL. However being a person with a comprimised immune system I tend to shy away from anything with raw egg as an ingredient. The yolks in this recipe remain raw and uncooked. Some people potentially could get sick from eating raw egg products in the United States; others, like myself, could die from the same illness. Is there any substitution for the raw egg? If not, I would recommend that people not serve this type of dessert at a dinner party unless you KNOW for sure your eggs are not contaminated with something. You could end up with a dead friend.

This was GREAT!!! I used the hints from other reviews(double boiler, gelatin), the custard came out perfect! I also must admit, I made it in a Triffel bowl. I KNOW this was unorthodox, but I just had a feeling about it. This was the most beautiful presentation I have ever seen of a Tiramisu. It made three layers, and fit just perfectly. The flavor of this recipe is VERY good. It reminded me of when I used to work in an Italian restaurant(where they had a very authentic Tiramisu). I must have put on about 15 pounds when I was there because I would have a piece whenever I worked. This recipe was THAT GOOD! The only hints that I can give for this one would be... I grated blocks of chocolate in my food processor, and split it into thirds because I made three layers. Otherwise, there is not one bad thing I can say about it. Everyone LOVED it, there was nothing left!

I loved this recipe. I madi it for a party and the recipie was requested by most everyone there. I added the gelitin, doubled the cream, used kahlua in the coffee, used lady fingers instead of poundcake, brushed on the coffee and made it into three layers so that the cream didn't over power the cake. Everyone loved it and it has been requested for thanksgiving at my place.

To Greg of Boise, ID .... I will tell you what is wrong with raw egg yolks. They carry the risk of salmonella infection. This can present a real danger to old people, babies & anyone with a compromised immune system. It can even make perfectly healthy young people very sick, as it did in the case of a twenty-year old friend of my daughter. OK, it doesn't happen that often & if you want to eat raw or under-cooked eggs, that's entirely up to you. However, you shouldn't sneer at the perfectly legitimate concerns of other reviewers. Nice recipe, by the way.

I added Gran Marnier to the real espresso coffee I made to give it an appealing orange taste to go with my Orange Brandy chicken. I also steam-cooked the egg yolks with the sugar due to "raw" yolk status in the dessert I dont like...it was so creamy and thickened perfectly! I also loved how quick and easy the layering was in a ramekin I took a biscuit cutter and shaped the pound cake to fit perfectly in them.Just some ideas I wanted to share as a Student Chef in Dallas....It was nice to do something more simple yet taste like I slaved!!!!!!!!!!Best to you all!

This COULD have been delicious!!! I feel the only error in this recipe is human error. I made the big mistake of using soft ladyfingers & dipping them in the coffee...WHOA was that strong & moooshy. Next time I'll stick to the recipe & maybe brush the coffee on instead of dipping. The whisking eggs & such in double boiler AND adding unflav gelatin was EXCELLENT advice & almost necessary to follow!! The cream was wonderfully smooth & silky. As for the chocolate gratings, well I used half white chocolate & half semi-sweet chocolate. This helped so the chocolate taste would not be overwhelming. Speaking of overwhelming...be careful when adding any booze...it does not get cooked so the flavor is very strong. Use sparingly & stick to the real good stuff. Goodluck!

This was excellent, especially with the addition of the gelatine. I also added kahlua to both the espresso and the egg/sugar mixture in the double boiler. Only things I would change are to use much less chocolate - I felt it was too much - and to increase the amount of pound cake and build 2 layers instead of 1. (i.e cake,chocolate, cheese mix,then cake again, chocolate, cheese mix and final chocolate dusting on top.) I might also try ladyfingers next time, just for a change. Very much recommended!

My mother says I can never leave a recipe alone so I "tweaked" this recipe as well! Solve the "oozy" problem by add an envelope of unflavored gelatin softened in a little hot water to the egg-sugar mixture.

This was quite good. I agree with one of the other reviewers in that the tiramisu was a bit "oozy," kind of liquid-y. But the taste is fantastic, and was a big hit with folks in a new book group I recently joined. Makes a large amount, so do it for a crowd or be prepared to enjoy leftovers.

Easy to make and delicious. I first made this dish for a group of friends months ago and am still getting raves and requests for it. I do not recommend using a food processor though, as it is too easy to beat all the air out of your mixture. You'll have much better results using your mixer.
