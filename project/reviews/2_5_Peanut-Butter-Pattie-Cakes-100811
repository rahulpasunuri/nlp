Is this recipe a joke? Has anyone actually made this? Please respond- I would like to know if anyone out there thinks this sounds better than just eating the cookies. I can't believe an actual chef put her name to this?!?!?

I, being the American I am today, would not in fact, make this recipe again. would go see a movie, come home, and bake a wonderful chocolate cake. Oh yes, I have a chocolate cake recipe that actually helps you lose weight.

This doesn't strike me as a terribly original way to utilize girl scout cookies. Simply crushing the cookies over the shortcakes?!? Please!!!
