This was tasty although too time consuming for the outcome. Based on the other comments, I tried to make it less laborious by making the sauce the day before. I also tried to make it quicker and less oily by cooking the eggplant and potatoes in my ovens. I used 4 baking trays lined with parchment for easy clean up. I put the eggplant and potatoes on them, brushed them lightly with olive oil on both sides, sprinkled them with salt and pepper, and cooked them at 400 for 20 minutes. In the meantime I chopped and sauteed the peppers. I also added feta cheese to the eggplant layers and sprinkled some on top for added flavor. It still took me an hour and 40 minutes to put it all together. On the plus side, this is a nice hearty vegetarian dish to bring to a party and it is fine at any temperature. You could also shorten it up by buying a good quality roasted garlic tomato sauce.

This dish is very oily. I mixed the final product with boiled spaghetti, a little salt and pepper to turn it into a hot pasta dish - it was better this way!

I remade this recipe without the potatoes, substituting ground chicken (or turkey). Lowered the carbs and made it a good one-pot meal. Sprinkle a little nutmeg either into the sauce or over the top as you are building the layers. Came out great!

Time consuming recipe, but worth the wait if you have the time to hang out in the kitchen for several hours. I ended up using one skillet to saute the veggies, so it probably took longer than the two-skillet method called for in the recipe. When I make this again, I will probably grill the vegetables with a light brushing of oil. This will probably speed things up since I have a larger grill surface and will be a little healthier.

As other reviewers suggest, this is a fairly time consuming recipe. But, I enjoy it for precisely that reason! It's a wonderful dish to make to spend time in the kitchen, in the winter, nibbling on snacks and wine, and then enjoying the payoff at the end. I used to make this recipe all the time when I lived in Austria, and I think the quality of the ingredients was better there than what I can get in the midwest, and the dish was better there. Definitely use the best Italian tomatoes available (not a store brand!). This is a great dish for vegetarians, served with bread, rice, or couscous. It also goes well as a side with fish. And, it reheats very well.

I am a huge sucker for fried potatoes. The overall flavor when done was good, but it's really not worth the work. Maybe if you have the right kitchen set up (ie a fry daddy) and have great knife skills (for all the chopping), this may be a good idea. Otherwise, the flavors just aren't worth this much effort. It took me 7 hours on a Friday night!

This recipe was a delicious accompaniment to grilled swordfish. I used fresh red chiles in addition to the green peppers. I used little purple, red and white potatoes and did not peel them but cooked them twice as long as suggested to make them more golden brown. Next steps I would increase the tomato a bit. This was great for using all the eggplant and peppers my garden has produced.

Made this recently. It's pretty good, but lacking something. If I tried again I would add a yogurt and egg crust on top to help bind things together, like in a moussaka.The eggplant was delicious!

An excellent dish...even after a few changes. I roasted the vegetables instead of pan-frying to save time and calories. Amazing that a sauce this simple tasted so good...the fresh thyme makes the dish!

This is the first time Gourmet has disappointed me. I thought this was way too time consuming for the result. I tried to cut back on the oil but it wasn't easy while frying the eggplants and potatoes. I'll stick with ratatouille and maybe throw some chopped potatoes in next time.

Although frying the vegetables seperately was a lot more work than I initially thought the result was excellent. Maybe the next time I use a little less oil. Of course it is very authentic to let mediterranean dish literally 'swim'in olive oil, but I prefer a little less. I also very much liked the garlicky tomato-thyme sauce. A keeper.

I made a few changes to the recipe because of convenience, but basically kept to the recipe. This is a great meal for a vegan, which I am not, but is pretty good and healthy for the rest of us as well. I substituded poblano peppers and pimento peppers for the green peppers. They are what I had and worked out very well. Frying the ingredients in olive oil is a bit of a job, but the end results were very good. I found the recipe very flavorful and am surprised by the negative review. We served this as a complete meal and there was easily enough food for four people, maybe more.

Made this for a group of friends (including one vegan), after a long day of cross country skiing- we all loved it.

I also wanted this to be low fat. I baked the eggplant, potato, (and zuchinni I added) according to the Hearty Low-fat moussaka recipe. It turned out very tasty with my garden fresh thyme.

I don't know how the Salt Lake City reviewer could find eggplant & potatoes "heavy," but I liked this dish a lot. I am glad that the Alabama reviewer's comments convinced me to try it (I'm an eggplant lover). I made a lower fat version by broiling the eggplant and using very little oil for the potatoes. The result was yummy - a great vegetarian entree.

This is terrible recipe. It tasted like marinara sauce with veggies. I like simple dishes that have solid flavor, but this dish seemed to starchy. Potatoes and eggplant with a tomato sauce--that's heavy. Instead of this I would use the same ingredients for a gratin.

Delicious! For the Eggplant lover this a must to add to their recipe files.
