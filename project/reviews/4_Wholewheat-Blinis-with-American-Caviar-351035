I only used the recipe for the blinis (not the toppings) and it was fabulous! I did change several things (but I'm sure the original recipe would have worked just as perfectly). (1) I used 2% Lactaid milk instead of whole milk (2) I used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream (3) I made this as an entree and so made each blini using 2 tbl. of batter and cooked them for 1 min 30 sec on each side. Instead of caviar and sour cream, I topped the blinis with some more of the plain Greek yogurt mixed with chopped fresh dill, lemon juice, salt, and pepper, and topped the yogurt mixture with smoked brook trout. I garnished it with dill. It was amazing!! I was pleasantly surprised the batter worked EXACTLY as described - even to the little bubbles forming between 2.5 and 3 hours!

I used this recipe when I was out of buckwheat flour. The recipe works fine and the blinis are tasty, but without the more intense flavor of buckwheat. The dill in the batter adds a nice, subtle addition that works well the way I served them -- with smoked salmon and sour cream. Using Quick Rise Yeast really saves time.

Quite good and easy to make. The batter kept beautifully in the fridge overnight, as well. (I heated them up like "regular" morning pancakes for the kids the next morning).
