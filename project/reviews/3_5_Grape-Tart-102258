I thought these were OK. While I'd make again, I might try with strawberry and kiwi or raspberries. I thought the custard was OK, nothing all that outstanding. The recipe is a nice concept, but I just thought the results were kind of boring.

The grape tart was very easy to make. It allowed me to do other things during a busy dinner get together. It looks beautiful, but you really have to like pastry cream. It would be great to bring to a dessert party. Make sure you roll the puff pastry out enough, but ultimately don't worry about the shape of the pastry.

Delicious, and beautifuf! Since I made it for the first time my guests are always asking for this as a dessert. My husband especially loved the pastry cream. I will make it again and again.

Wonderful. Easy to make. If the grapes are in-season, you don't need the sugar at all. It was light, refreshing and everyone raved. Definitely use different color grapes...it really adds to the presentation.

This was a wonderful recipe that I will keep and continue using. I used the puff pastry shells instead of the sheets. It makes for a smaller portion for little ones.I also added 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract to the custard. It gave the custard a delicate taste. Great idea to drizzle chocolate on the pastry. Young and old loved this one.

It is wonderful to find a simple, unique recipe that impresses all. This is it!! I used different kinds of grapes in a pattern on tart and it was impressive. I have made it again and again with the same results, all terrific.

I logged on for the first time just to be able to tell everyone that this is absolutely - "FABULOUS"!! You have to try it. I doubled the recipe to allow for leftovers from a Morrocan dinner party I had this past weekend. Leftovers two days later were still out-of-this-world!! IT is now 2 months since I made this. I made it again last week and used fresh Clementines and drizzled melted semi-sweet chocolate on the edges of the cooked pastry shells. WONDERFUL. Try it, You'll love it!!

This dessert got rave reviews. The tarts were quite large and everyone thought they would only be able to eat half...everyone finished the whole thing! I used fresh organic peaches and raspberries instead of grapes and some other kind of jam (grapefruit, I think). It's nice to find easy,versatile, great tasting recipes that can be prepared ahead of time. It makes for much more relaxing entertaining.
