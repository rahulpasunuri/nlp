Pretty good if you use very tender veal. Needs the lemon to spark it up, otherwise a bit mild for flavor.

Most excellent recipe - wouldn't change a thing - think about the many different combinations you could use inside... this will become a regular dish in our household - awesome!

Excellent recipe can not add more to what "by guigaro from Times Square" has stated.

Excellent recipe that can easily substitute chicken in lieu of veal. Simple yet elegant, good to go for family or company. Very versatile and so much nicer of a presentation than having it rolled up. You can never go wrong with a recipe such as this.

I have made this recipe twice, both with chicken. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. It does take a little extra time to assemble the dish, but it is worth it. I think this is a great chicken to serve to company.

Thanks for all the tips. Lemon wedges necessary. The sauteed garlic mushrooms and the bleu cheese vinaigrette on chicory, tomatoes and red onion were perfect (along with a crusty French baguette). Used Serrano ham. Even with shortage of time, I placed the prepared cutlets in the freezer while I prepared the salad and mushrooms. It was sufficient to chill them and they came out beautifully for Sunday evening's meal.

I made this with prosciutto instead of Virginia ham, with two slices per veal "sandwich." It worked really nicely. As I was pressed for time, I did not chill the veal either, and it worked just fine. I served it with a blue-cheese-vinaigrette salad of baby greens and "Mushrooms with Garlic Butter." A total crowd-pleaser, and very filling. I could only eat half of my serving! It is beautiful and elegant enough to serve at a party, and simple and tasty enough to serve the family in front of a movie. Highly recommended for any occasion!

Excellent classic recipe. Easy to make. Perfect for guests as much of the prep is done in advance. I have used veal, chicken and turkey with excellent results. I serve with a rice pilaf and green beans wrapped in bacon.

Delicious. I'm pregnant and even though I was a bit nauseous when we started, I cleaned my plate. Yummy.
