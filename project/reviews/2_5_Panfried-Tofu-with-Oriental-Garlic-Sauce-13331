I thought this was great. I agree with one reviewer (I use many times more garlic than any recipe). I didn't have any ginger root, so I used a tablespoon of a spice mix which a Chinese foreign student friend taught me about, Lao Ganma by Guiyang Nanming Black Beans (I get it at the Asian market). Very tasty! I not only used this sauce for the tofu, but for the broccoli I fried in garlic too.

I made the recipe as written, then tried to make the garlic sauce actually taste like something...it couldn't be improved enough to make it enjoyable. Won't ever make this again.

The tofu was good. The sauce had a very nice consistency. Unfortunately not a lot of flavor. Next time I'll increase the soy sauce and garlic, and ginger, add some chili pepper, and cut the vinegar a little.

This is very tasty and we have it often. I always use more garlic than any recipe calls for (subscribe to the theory that if 2 cloves are good 22 must be even better) Also was more liberal with ginger and scallions. Tried it last time with lean ground pork (cooked separately, drained off grease, and mixed in with the sauce).I cut the tofu in smaller pieces - four times across and then once lengthwise down the middle.

Fabulous, my husband, non-veg, loved it.I served it first with rice, topped with the tofu (used chinese 5 spiced tofu)the sauce and as one suggested topped that with sauteed red peppers and portobello mushrooms. Can't wait to make it again.

I found this to be pretty good, almost close to what you'd order at a restaurant. I added one teaspoon of Chile-Garlic sauce (the korean red sauce) to the soy-water sauce, and a bit when I was panfrying the tofu (just to give it some kick). Had I not added the hot sauce, it would've been pretty bland. I also added some mushrooms...overall tasty!

This was really good - and i left out ginger and used rice vinegar rather than apple cider. I do my tofu like this.. it makes it really crispy. I freeze the tofu. then after its frozen, i defrost it, then squeeze all the excess water out. When you fry it, it stays firm and gets very crispy. This is a good, simple easy stir fry that i would definitely make again.

Hello, I have not actually made this dish yet, but I am more looking for suggestions of what to serve it with for Valentine's Day. My boyfriend loves this kind of food, but I am stumped as to what else to make. The dishes have to all be vegetarian. . .any suggestions? What have you served it with? Thanks! Please email suggestions to powellkristy@yahoo.com. : )

IT SUCKED!

I did need to add a little extra water, soy sauce, and sugar to the sauce to dilute it, and I used the water from soaking 4 dried shiitake mushrooms instead of plain water, then added the shiitakes with the ginger. Very nice blend of flavors, & nicely cooked tofu.

OK folks--I read all of the reviews and incorporated as many suggestions as I could. I wasn't expecting this to be this most flavorful dish ever, but it was STILL bland! I'm trying to think of one redeeming quality it may have had, and I can't come up with anything. And I usually like tofu! You'd be better off stir-frying firm tofu (cut into squares) with teriyaki sauce, chopped scallion, garlic and ginger, and then layering in shrimp (optional but yummy), blanched pea pods, mushrooms, and asparagus, and then stirring it all together with some cooked udon noodles or spooning it over rice.

Definitely tasty. It's always good to find a recipe using tofu that turns out well!

I made this for my vegetarian girlfriend and it was easy and impressive (as far as she was concerned). The sauce can get a bit "goopy" but I used it more as a light dressing and plate adornment than something the tofu was swimming in.

I was so surprised when I made this -- it was as good (if not better) than the tofu in brown sauce that I get from my favorite Chinese restaurant! I put it on top of brown rice, and added some broccoli, red pepper flakes & sesame seeds. YUM!!

This is delicious if you make it with Oyster sauce -- about 2 tablespoons. Even my non-vegetarian friends enjoy it. Make sure to use the full amount of cornstarch to thicken.

You slice in 4 equal parts across the width..if it is a block of 4" x 3"...you end up w/1" x 3". The sauce was aided by some sliced bell pepper, sliced mushrooms (cooked first, set aside, and added last). A little diced jalapeno, and extra sesame made my non-tofu-eating boyfriend satisfied, although he remains dubious.

The sauce was definately bland although I did add more garlic and ginger as was suggested by other viewers. My husband took one bite and said "Yuk". Then he grabbed a hotdog! It needs something but I don't think I'll bother to try and find out.

The sauce would be much better if it was made with some sort of stock rather than water. I think that's what keeps it dull.

I agree that the sauce needed a little tweaking, I put in much more garlic and ginger than it called for, and I also put in a lot of sesame chili oil and soy sauce. I did not ever use scotch so I never had the watery sauce that some people mentioned, and I always used a little extra cornstarch. My husband can't get enough of this, I love it because it's quick and very easy to make.

I didn't find the sauce as bland as some others did, but then, I also used twice the amount of garlic, which helped. If I made this again, I think I would try adding oyster sauce as some other people suggested, or maybe something to spice it up just a little bit. But overall, not bad.

The sauce has a subtle flavor for the more refined palette.

A generous tablespoon of oyster sauce added just the roundness this sauce lacked; I would certainly make it again with the addition of oyster sauce. Before I added the sauce, it was weak and not worth repeating.

I agree with previous reviewer that sauce needs help. Has a very weak, watery flavor. I added Safeway garlic and ginger sauces to save it. Directions on cutting the tofu ("Cut the tofu crosswise") not clear to me.

A very easy recipe to make quickly for a small dinner party. I served it over soba noodles, and it was a big hit. The sauce needed a tiny bit of assistance to round out the flavor, but overall a very nice dish.
