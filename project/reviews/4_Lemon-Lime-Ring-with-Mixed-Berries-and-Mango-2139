Fabulous recipe for summer entertaining. It should be shown off before cutting and serving which we didn't do.

A beautiful presentation! I've made it for a number of years. Guests at a recent July 4th party just loved it. It does melt quickly-especially when served at an outside party, so keep it chilled as long as possible. The guests didn't seem to mind though. I found five of them together slurping the last of the melting mousse right off the platter! They looked like a bunch of kids getting caught with their fingers in the pie. Since I'm not a huge mango fan, I have modified it a few times using more fresh peaches and berries.

I actually made this recipe for Christmas as kind of a lighter alternative to the pumpkin cheesecake. I upgraded the fruit by adding clementine segments and pomegranate seeds. Next time, I'll cut the sugar in the cream and add some grand marnier to the fruit. Otherwise, a completely DELICIOUS desert for any time of year!

I made this for Easter and it was a huge hit! Very refreshing and beautiful with the mixed fruit and berries.

This is absolutely delicious and very pretty too. Since the mousse is sweet enough, there's no need to add sugar to the fruit.

Absolutely spectacular! A perfect summer-time treat. It does begin to melt fast, so not a lot of time to admire it... just dig in!

I made this for a hot Australian New Year's day lunch, and it was fabulous. The combination of the fruit with the smooth citrus icecream is a real winner. Only thing was, there were only four of us and my house-hosts put the leftovers in the fridge, where of course it proceeded to melt and create an absolute mess. So serve it to a big crowd and avoid disaster :)

This recipe is really visually gorgeous and serves quite a few people - perfect summer fare, especially after Mexican food. However, I have learned a few things in making it. When I lined the ring mold with plastic wrap, and then tried to unmold the finished frozen product, I couldn't tell if I had gotten all the plastic wrap because it was tucked into the crevices of the fold-over wrap and it was invisible! Since then I have taken to buying colored plastic wrap so that I can easily see if there is a little snippet left on the ring. Imagine getting a piece of plastic wrap stuck in your throat... I also use lemon and lime peel, not just lemon. I think it adds a little character to the finished product to see small bits of lime in the almost whitish ring mold. The accompanying fruit really does not require sugar, although it gives it a little gloss. If you cut the fruit even a half hour in advance, there is a ton of liquid that seeps out of the berries. Better to keep it in the fruit if you ask me. But if you must sugar it, make sure you use a slotted spoon to lift out the fruit and place it in the center of the ring or you will make a spectacular mess.

I have made this recipe many times and it always receives rave reviews. It's easy, can be made ahead, and of course provides lots of those delicious fat grams. It's elegant enough for a catered affair and simple enough for a family dinner.
