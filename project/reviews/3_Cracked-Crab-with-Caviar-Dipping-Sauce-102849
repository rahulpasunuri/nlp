I purchased 2 live Dungeness crabs and wanted to try a different dipping sauce and came across this recipe. I love caviar but was unsure whether this will work. To my surprise it turned out really well. Instead of using sour cream I used creme fraiche which made it very creamy and delicious. I will definitely make this recipe again.
