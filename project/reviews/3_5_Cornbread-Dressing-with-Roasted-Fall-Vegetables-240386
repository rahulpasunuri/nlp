I make this recipe every year. I get lots of compliments.

I concur with prior reviewer - I added vegetable stock and toasted the cornbread. I also think that it would have been better not combined - leave vegetables larger and serve cornbread with it. It was very tasty.

roasted pecans would be a nice addition

Made this two years ago , was a mess. Last year roasted the veggies in heavy pot in oven (diced up) w/ a little EVO,salt & pepper, the night before. then used bakery cornbread and mixed w/ some stock, came out amazing going to make it this year again.

Lat year I made a roasted veg similiar to this, but used vegetable stock and just about 2T olive oil to saute onions, celery, and some carrots. I did roast the veggies according to density for different roasting times. I used a little balsamic vinegar for a better depth of flavor. The dressing should be just moist enough to stay together when you grab a handful. Enjoy

I made this last year for T-Day. It was tasty, but not significantly better than other stuffings. The veggies didn't stand out as much as I had hoped. It was pretty labor intensive to make, so I had high expectations for it. All in all, the pay-off wasn't worth the extra work involved. Making a basic oyster stuffing this year.

OK, I admit. As is, I am sure the recipe would be dry, but with the changes we made, it was fantastic. 1. add some vegetable stock to the vegetables. 2. Toast the cornbread in the oven drizzled with rosemary infused olive oil, then cover the vegetables with the cubes like a crust. Nice and crispy on the top, with veggies everywhere. 3. use cippolini instead of pearl onions. Also, one reviewer talks about roasting times being tricky. Forget trying to guess... roast the veggies separately and mix them together at the end. Just add a little extra seasoning.

DRY. Extremely dry- lonely veggies and not a so so cornbread. Compared to other recipes, it uses less than 1/4 the of liquid, and the liquids are boring Cutting veggies into equal sizes so they cook evenly is tricky- you'll have some waste. Be warned.

This recipe was delicious. I used store bought corn- bread mix to save time. The sweetness of the cornbread (Marie Calendars) was a wonderful complement to the earthiness of the veggies. Based on earlier reviews, perhaps the mix works better than the corn bread in the recipe?

The vegetables were delicious! We actually found ourselves snacking on them before I had added the cornbread. Once the veggies were combined with the cornbread, we were disappointed that we didn't keep them separate. The cornbread really overpowered the dish. Next time I will make the vegetable minus the cornbread.

I made the recipe exactly down to the 3/4 pounds of this and that. What attracted me to the recipe was the photo - lots of roasted veggies and just a few cornbread cubes. Alas, it was lots of cornbread and not a lot of veggies. BTW, the cornbread is very bland but I think the point is that it stands up well against the subtle herb flavors. I, too, would add more onions, mushrooms, carrots ... if I were to try the recipe again. Unlikely I will.

I skipped the cornbread and I used fresh rosemary. Turned out even better.

The roasted vegetables were absolutely delicious. They would make a great meal on their own. The cornbread was also very good on its own, however when combined, the cornbread flavor overpowered the veggies. I would recommend using fresh herbs rather than dried. Overall I found it unspectacular.

The cornbread was mush in the middle even tho the knife came out clean after 30 minutes. I had to throw half of it out and use store bought bread instead. There are much better cornbread recipes out there than this one---whoever heard of baking something for 23 minutes, anyway? Other than that, the flavors were good.

This is a great find. I am unable to eat gluten and this recipe is gluten free. I used fennel instead of rutabagas and it worked out great. Next time I will use more veggies.

I made this for Thanksgiving, as the first stuffing I've ever made. Although time consuming, it was simple to make. The flavor of the vegetables really melded together nicely, and I liked using some new ones like pearl onions and parsnips. I would increase the roasted garlic next time, as I love it and couldn't taste it quite enough in this. Would definitely make again.

This is excellent, but after a trial run (before a dinner party), I made the following modifications: added another 1/2 bag of pearl onions and 1 pound mushrooms, plus increased the other vegetables to 1 pound each; decreased the roasting time slightly to prevent over cooking; and used my own cornbread recipe. I pair the dish with grilled pork tenderloin and the Apple Chutney sauce in the same Bon Appetit issue. It was a great autumn dinner party combination.

Excellent and easy for a Sunday dinner side dish. We purchased ready made cornbread just to make it extra fast and it worked out fine.
