Made this again, without disappointment, for about the 8th time. This is such a refreshing, delicious and EASY and healthy dressing. Just remember to add Salt & Pepper to taste. Otherwise, perfect recipe!

My dinner guests were slurping the dressing off their plates! This was wonderful, even with dried herbs. I was serving quite a few so I doubled the olive oil & vinegar and it came out wonderful. For cooks who thought this was not very flavorful, try adding salt and pepper. This a nice light dressing and is a keeper for my family.

This is a great basic recipe for many types of salads. It is bright, slightly tart, and full of flavor. I have made it with herbes de provence, which is delicious as well. For those who want something like bottled dressing you will need to use ingredients like xanthan gum, autolyzed yeast extract, calcium disodium edta, and other not so fun things ;)

i made this dressing for a salad i brought to easter and thought it was delicious. i just made it again and think i used too much garlic and red pepper flakes. next time i will reduce both. definitely better than any bottled dressing you buy!

Bogram: how on earth you found this 'bland' is beyond me. Are your taste buds dead? did you forget the garlic? This is a great quick salad dressing which everyone has ingredients in their cupboards......simple and delicious. Careful not to use BIG garlic cloves or you'll taste it all night.

I am rating it following the recipe (not after adding this and that to make it "fantastic"). Totally bland and, yes,acidic. I added salt and a quarter teaspoon of Dijon and some Provençal herbs and it was fine. But that is quite a bit different than the recipe.

Oh my goodness! this dressing was awesome, I've actually made it again everyday this week. I served this over a simple medley of fresh chopped tomatoes, red leaf lettuce and goat cheese. The salad dressing instantly melted with the goat cheese and created a creamy garlicky flavor that was delicious. In my opinion, the two cloves of raw garlic were the key ingredient.

Used this dressing for a sandwich will make this again

I fixed this salad dressing to go with a Roasted Beet salad with toasted pecans and goat cheese...amazing! Served this at a dinner party and guests loved it. I would cut the garlic down to one clove though, it had a hearty garlic flavor.

Simply delicious.

I love this recipe. Instead of regular olive oil I made it with extra light. It made the fresh taste of the herbs and spices stand out even more. GREAT RECIPE!

I like to use red wine vinegar with this dressing. It is fantastic!

I really liked this recipe. It has very strong flavors. lemon seems to bring out the flavor of the salad. I doubled this recipe and it was fine.

This is an excellent recipe for homemade Italian dressing! I also found that it's a great healthy recipe if you are watching your waistline as olive oil is one of those good fats. For a more salty version, add roughly chopped brined capers (drained but NOT rinsed) to it. Herbed white vinegars also work great for substituting; using dry herbs for this recipes is better since the fresh herbs start to go bad after 3 days. Lastly, if you want more flavour, refrigerate the dressing overnight. You'll find that the herbs stand out much more the next day. Enjoy!

This is a simple recipe with a nice tangy taste. I used fancy white wine vinegar. It makes a big difference. Also, just one small clove of garlic instead of 2.

I used fresh basil, one small garlic clove, a dab of Dijon mustard, and otherwise followed the recipe. It was quite sharp and quite garlicky. I did use a stick blender instead of a whisk. We ate it, making sour faces all the while, but I won't make this again.

Made this twice and my first impression has not changed. Not worth the bother... and it's an easy recipe! I'd rather use a store bought brand than this.

So so so so so good. Easy and makes salads a meal I look forward to.

Great taste and easy to fix up. No need to buy prepared dressing with this on hand.

I altered this recipe by using what I had on hand: garlic infused olive oil, white vinegar and dry parsley instead of fresh. I also added a couple of tablespoons of gorgonzola cheese and fresh crushed black pepper. I used this 'version' with a pasta salad and it was fantastic. This is a great basic recipe that can be easily tweaked to suit your tastebuds, but I assume it tastes even better with fresh herbs.

I have made this several times. Each time I need a good Italian Salad Dressing, I do some searching, but end up making this. Very Good.

So tasty and so fresh with fresh herbs and a touch of green peppercorn.

I have been looking for a good Italian dressing recipe and this fit the bill. I did make a few substitutions. I used a little less olive oil, then added a bit of mustard to help with emulsifying. Also used fresh basil instead of dried. Everything else was to the letter. Delicious!

To SW FLA:the bacterium that causes botulism lives in low oxygen environments (ie: canned foods) and will not grow in salad dressing. Store the dressing in your fridge till it SMELLS, LOOKS or SEEMS bad. you will not die.

This is very yummy. My husband and I make it all the time. I'll try adding some parmesan as was recommended by an earlier reviewer.

Very simple recipe if you need a dressing in a hurry. I tried blending it, which gave me a nice texture. Next time, I would reduce the parsley or eliminate it; seemed overpowering to me.

Excellent! This is about how I make mine! I cut down on the oil a bit, and add a bit of water instead(to cut down on fat), but then I add grated PARMESEAN cheese! I also add a small bit of dried crushed ROSEMARY (very little, as it is pretty strong-about 1/8 tsp). YUMMY! You can also add a smidge of sugar, and grey poupon mustard!! Do not let this sit in fridge for more than a couple days- (botchelism-SPELLING?- anyway very bad!)

Definitely need to let it set over night, but delicious! Used it as a marinate for fresh asparagus which we quickly grilled on the bar b q! Scrumptious!

good basic recipe. i used it over mixed greens. the dressing tasted much better after a day in the refrigerator. when i made it and used it right away, it tasted too oily. it's best to refrigerate and wait a day; the flavors seem to combine better.

Good,enjoyed over Mixed baby greens with pine nuts and any type of blue cheese.
