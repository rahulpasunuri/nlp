This is a simple pasta salad. A lot of reviewers complained of it's blandness. As soon as it was made, it tasted primarily of the olive oil that I used,but as it sat, more of the lemon flavor came through. I used red onion (didn't have green onions) and basil (no parsley). I upped the garlic and added salt and pepper to the dressing. I quite like it.

PS - I only use 1/2 cup olive oil and it does need at least a teaspoon of salt if not more.

I have found using half lemon juice and half red wine vinegar picks the flavor up. Also I put half the dressing on when the salad is made and the other half just before serving.

I thought with the suggestions below, I could improve this recipe, but it was still lacking something, so I would not make this again.

I agree it was a bit bland. I added some feta cheese and some shredded chicken. using orzo was a nice departure from the usual spiral or bowtie pasta I usually use in a pasta salad. This is basically a good recipe, just needed a tiny bit more oomph!

This is a very lovely recipe. I especially like that the base ingredients are mild and may be "dressed up" as other reviewers have suggested. In the heat of the summer, I love this kind of salad. Dress, season, and add extra ingredients as you like!

Excellent. I added salt and pepper to the dressing (impossible to thoroughly mix throughout by sprinkling on orzo mixture). I also sprinkled all lemon peal and added dressing when orzo was still warm. Only addition was kalamata olives.

This salad is wonderful as is; however, I might add cheese (feta or mozzarella) and olives next time.

As written, the recipe does seem bland to me. However, I added crumbled feta cheese and kalamata olives, and was a bit generous with the mint. It made all the difference. I'll definitely make it again.

I agree with the other reviewers. This came out bland. Parmesan cheese helped it some.

Bland with a vaguely unpleasant texture. There are many good recipes for salads with orzo. This isn't one of them.

Following the recipe as is, I would've rated it a 2 forker, but I added finely crumbled feta cheese and much more lemon juice, herbs and a small amount of white whine vinegar, as I found the dressing rather bland as is. In the end, turned out great!

First time followed the recipe to the letter. Second time, I used balsamic vinegar in the dressing instead of lemon juice (although i did used the lemon peel) and threw in some chopped red pepper and some feta cheese. EVERYONE raved and had seconds.

Yuck! There was too much oil in the dressing and the whole thing comes off as very bland. I've added more lemon juice, fresh basil, some olives and pine nuts, but it still is dull to eat.

Neat recipe. I have gotten good reviews by adding chopped fresh veggies--carrots, radishes, etc. Keep the dressing very bright; add more lemon juice and parsley to keep it fresh tasting.

Delicious - light - easy to make - variation possibilities are endless - a real keeper.

while it was OK, it was alot of work (with all the chopping, etc). Not enough bang for the buck!

I modified this recipe and instead of using snap peas and cucumber I roasted red peppers and yellow summer squash, then diced them, put more garlic in, added cilantro and omitted half the mint. I also cooked the orzo in chicken stock. It was delicious and received raves from all my guests. I also used the requisite amount of green onions,parsely, lemon juice and peel and olive oil.

Made it for a family reunion/vacation. I got several complements, but I was dissatisfied with the bland flavor. If I made it again, I would boost the lemon and herbs, and DOUBLE the vegetables (or reduce the pasta). Count on this recipes to serve more than 8... this is a lot of food for a side dish!
