Hubby, who is kinda meh on swiss chard could not get enough of this! I made it two nights in a row and he plowed through most of it himself. Like other commenters, I only used chard. I also used Knorr boullion cubes for the broth and lessened the water to make it double strength.

I made this for a holiday buffet and it got raves from all the guests. I omitted the spinach and made up the difference with more chard since I have an abundance of it from my garden. It was so tender and melty that people thought it was spinach. I'd definitely make it again. As with all good cooking, you can't expect delicious results from average ingredients: buy good cheese and even make your own bread crumbs from good bread.

Delicious and not that hard!

This was delicious - my new favorite swiss chard recipe! I saved some time by mixing up 1/2 cup of chicken broth at double the strength - microwaving it then adding the cream. It still took some time, but was definitely worth it. I only wish I had made more!

This is exceptionally good! It was the hit of my Christmas table, despite serving it with bourbon-glazed filet mignon! It is definitely time-consuming, but I think it's worth it for a special occasion. I made it by the book and wouldn't change a thing.

The best part of this dish was the crumb topping ... and we're huge Swiss chard fans. It was just ok and absolutely not worth all the time and mess. Fortunately, we had kibbeh left over from the night before so there was no prep needed for anything else. I agree with a previous reviewer that good cooking can and does take time and I have no problem with that if the end result is worthwhile but this one just wasn't.

WOW! Loved it. Tweaked the recipe a bit. Did not add spinach and did not have Gruyere. Added caramelized onion to the topping and used swiss and parmesan. Will make this again!

What a star. I grew chard for the first time this year and I am trying many of the chard recipes here. I followed the recipe but used all chard. I can't imagine what all the fussing is about. Yes, it takes time, good cooking frequently does. Yes there are lots of items to clean up afterward, but that's what dishwashers do. It is fair to complain about time and mess when the final result is average. This was so delicious I almost swooned. It would be good for a one dish dinner. Leftovers are equally good, it reheats well in the microwave -- if you are lucky enough to have any leftovers!

Loved this recipe. I would competely omit the spinach next time because I love the flavor of the swiss chard more than I do spinach. Could definitely be a main course alongside a big crusty piece of bread! Delicious!

I have been experimenting with gratin/ casseroles and I have found there is a process and then you can add any kind if ingredients. Start with withever you wish to include that is cooked: swiss chard,peas, etc then make a classic bechamel sauce found here on this site to bind it then a topping of breadcrumbs and bake so easy, really! A great way for kids to eat veggies, and the bechamel can be done with lowfat milk, just have it heated when adding to the roux.

I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was great. I never thought all of those greens would cook down so much, but I used the recommended amounts of both and only ended up with a 9x9 square pan of gratin - not sure what happened with the other reviewers that said it would feed an army! On the negative side, it was quite labor intensive, and I used bagged spinach. I would only suggest making this if the rest of your meal was pretty easy (or if you made this dish ahead). My fiance was not crazy about it (though he ate it). I think it was just him, though. He admitted that he is not into bitter greens. Since it was so much work and I was the only one that loved it, I probably won't make this too often. However, I will enjoy the leftovers for the next couple of days! :)

I've never given a recipe on this site a single fork...but this one deserved it. First, there is WAY too much Swiss Chard...this recipe would feed an army, but only if they were really hungry. Next, I don't mind dirtying a lot of pans/dishes...and I did...if the result is worth it. Not the case here. Spinach and nutmeg? Save it for a spinach dish. It doesn't work here. You would think that cream, garlic, cheese and Swiss Chard would work together beautifully and it does....but not in this recipe. Spend you time elsewhere.

I used fresh rainbow chard from the garden, it was quite a pretty dish, and tasty too! Did a few things differently, and maybe saved a little time: I used a concentrated chicken stock (trader joes) and put less water-(less cook time for reducing) I didn't bother using spinach and in turn used only about 10 very large stalks of chard. doubt it came close to 3 lbs.!) Used Panko as many cooks suggested:) I also made cream sauce in a smaller Le Crueset pan, that can easily trasfer to oven. I found I didn't need to drain chard, and added straight to sauce in pan, covered with crumbs. I baked it for 10 minutes, or so, I felt it was getting to cooked, so I fired up the broiler to brown the crumb topping. I thought the flavors were very nice, FYI, I didn't use nutmeg.

This was a lot of work an not very good. No one in my family (other than me) would eat it, so we ended up composting most of it, which was such a shame considering all the great chard that went in it! It probably would have been better if the cheese had been mixed in with the chard rather than on top.

To the lovely cook in Houston, who went on about how they didn't follow the recipe, then ragged on us about the number of dirty pots--I kept it to four, but read the recipe, please! For everyone else...I may have used too much chard, but while the topping was good, the rest just tasted like chard. It was good, but I'll probably stick to other recipes without the cream and butter.

Yes, this tasted very good, but the labor involved - cleaning, separating and chopping 4 pounds of greens - is extraordinary. I would only recommend doing this if that's all you have to make. Otherwise, you will lose your mind.

This is a wonderful way to use Swiss chard. The cheese makes it so rich and flavorful, a really elegant side dish.

This is delicious. I followed the recipe and believed it would serve 6. My mistake. I had 16 for dinner and doubled the recipe. Do you know how much 6 lbs of swiss chard is? Granted, I have a smallish kitchen, but it was filled, not the counters, not the sink, but the kitchen!!! Some of the guests were vegetarians, healthy vegetarians, they really didn't make a dent. One recipe would have been enough, doubled was way too much, I have enough leftovers to feed the Sonoma Valley!!! It will be awhile before I tackle this again, my forearms are sore from the chopping. I can barely lift a glass of wine.:)

Amazing dish. Made for an early holiday family meal and recieved lots of compliments. Very flavorful. I followed the recipe exactly and had wonderful results. Can't understand the poor reviews. Maybe some people are cooking the greens too long prior to baking. I did not have a mushy slimy mess but a perfectly textured gratin. Can't wait to make again.

Rating: 2
An unimpressive, time/labor-intensive recipe. The topping was the tastiest part of this dish. I wouldn't make this again, but if I were to consider it, I'd mix the topping through the vegs & add xtra gruyere on top. Perhaps caramelized onions & additional garlic would help.

Rating: 1
Based on the glowing reviews, I expected this to taste better. I found it to be a bland slimy mess. I took other reviewers' advice, and went easy on the salt. I think that was a mistake. Unless you just love the unadulterated flavor of cooked greens, I would season the veggies well. I always have a glut of chard in my garden, so I might try making this again. If so, I'll add garlic when cooking the onion, add cheese to the cream sauce and use 3 lbs of greens, rather than four.

This dish is absolutely amazing. I used dried tarragon and fresh parsley along with parmesan cheese in the topping and it was unbelievable.

Rating: 3
i realize i left something out: to save some time with the greens, try rolling the leaves together, and slice a 1/2 inch wide chiffonnade. don't worry about making squares. and leave the spinach alone. it will become very tender once cooked, and does not need to be hacked to pieces.

i really just used this recipe as a jumping-off point. after sauteéing the onions and chard ribs, i added and cooked the greens/spinach with chicken stock. i made great big plain croutons of a dense country bread, and mixed them into/under the cooked greens in the casserole. i kept the pot liquor (2 cups worth) and poured most of it (1 1/2 cups) into the casserole, soaking the croutons. while the butter for my roux was melting, i mixed the last 1/2 cup of juices into a cup of cream, which is how i began the béchamel. i added another 3/4 cup of 2% milk to fill it out. i layered 3 cups of shredded gruyère on top of the greens, and poured the béchamel over that. i only salted the greens in the casserole (before the cheese was added), as well as the pepper and nutmeg. i did add nutmeg to the béchamel as well, because i love it and i just got a new microplaner. i loved my adjusted version of this dish, mainly because of the pot liquor-soaked hunks of bread! as a woman who has spent most of her life in the south, i am incapable of preparing greens of any sort, and then pouring off the delicious nectar that collects in the bottom of the pan! this is why cornbread was invented. P.S. for those who ended up with a kitchen full of dishes: why? i had one dirty stock pot, and one dirty casserole, along with a few small incidentals.

Always a big hit. It does take a long time to wash and chop the greens, but I usually prepare the whole thing the day before and refrigerate. Let it sit at room temp to take the chill off, then bake a little longer than recipe calls for. Do salt sparingly.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious! But it really does take 2 hours to make. I used fresh parsley and italian seasoned breadcrumbs - the topping was great. For greens I used 1 bunch Swiss Chard w/stems, 1 bunch kale w/stems, and 1 bunch of beet greens no stems. This is definitely a dish for which you want to have all your ingredients chopped, measured and ready ahead of time. Made great leftovers next day.

This is a great recipe for a vegetable gratin that is delicious, but not too rich or heavy. The flavor of the greens really comes through.

This is one of my favorites, I make this over and over again. Everyone always raves about it. I think the combination of the chard with leeks is the real winner. I've also used young Kale/Collard greens in the recipe. These are still good, but not as good a balance of flavors as with the kale. I've also frozen this it loses a little of it's consistency...a little watery, but still very good.

As with all of the other reviews, this is a wonderful dish. I thought the chard was featured wellthe bechemel coats the greens just enough to really bring a party but not so much as to overwhelm. The only criticisms I have with this recipe is the amount of time spend preparing the greens, though it is ultimately worth it, it is a lot of work. Alsoand this might be my faultI found the recipe to be a bit too salty. There are three times you add "salt and pepper to taste". Next time, I will make sure to not add as much. Will definitely make this again.

Followed the recipe exactly as written, and was not disappointed. It took everything I had to not eat it up before assembling and baking - and I'm usually not a fan of Swiss chard. Cannot wait to make it again.

I'm going with three forks. This was a delicious dish. It was not, however "beyond compare" in my opinon. I didn't find it overly time consuming (though this is a great case for having all of your ingredients measured and set out before you begin), and I liked that it only had to bake for 20 minutes. Very good flavors. I'm not sure it showcases swiss chard as well as some other preparations do, though. This might be a dish for people who don't like chard or other greens or for those who find greens bitter, etc. as the sauce and cheese certainly counterbalance that. I think it would be a superb buffet dish because a) it would feed an army b) melted cheese goes over well with most people and c) it would be a nice alternative to a salad.

I have made this recipe several times. The nicest compliment was when my father-in-law actually asked if he could take the left overs home with him. It is one of my favorites and it has become a tradition to make in my house.

I liked the idea of this recipe but I felt that by the end of the cooking time the spinach/swiss chard was a bit overcooked and mushy for my taste and the cheesy flavor was quite strong. It was interesting to try but I don't think I'll make it again.

This was an awesome dish ! I ended up making it all chard and using a bit less of the cream sauce to lighten it up (kept the cream sauce to use on some cauliflowers the next day). We all thought this was great and ate it the next day too!

This was good! We ate the entire thing. We have never had chard before but because of this recipe, will definitely have it again. I substituted goat cheese and it turned out very well. I made a simple cold green salad as a side dish and it accompanied the warm Gratin excellently.

I have been trying to include more leafy greens in my diet but I really don't like them. This is one of the first times that I've craved a leafy green because of this recipe. I love cheese and cream so that helps. But the flavors got together so well here. Yes, this dish takes a while to make but it is worth it. Be sure to use the cheese that they recommend because it turns out very badly with different cheeses. Gruyere has the perfect texture and taste for the recipe.

This is an excellent side dish. I suggest using prewashed spinich, when ever possible. It will save some time in the preparation. There wasn't much liquid to sqeeze from the spinich and swiss chard because I spin dried them before cooking. This is going to be a regular item in our household and it's well worth the time to make.

This dish is absolutely wonderful! It was enjoyed immensely by my party of seven people, ranging in age from 16 upward. The teenagers enjoyed it every bit as much as the adults. Everyone raved about it and several went back for seconds. I felt the "active" time of 1-1/4 hours was a bit optimistic if you follow the recipe exactly and go the long route using fresh (not bagged, clean) spinach, as I did. Four pounds is a lot of greens to clean! In the cooking process, I also found that the chard stems took a lot longer than 8 minutes to tenderize. Next time I would probably steam them a bit first. Anyway, the flavors are fantastic and well, well worth the effort it took to prepare this dish.
