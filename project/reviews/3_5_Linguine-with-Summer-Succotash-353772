I gave this 4 forks because the ingredients are simple and in season, it was easy to make, and it was really quite tasty. I used farfalle instead of linguine. I also grated the Parmesan finely because another reviewer said she was left with gobs of cheese in the dish.

Yum. Excellent pasta dish. I did a quick Google search for bab tomatoes and came up with nothing, so I assume they meant to write baby tomatoes. (Granted, that doesn't help much more, but at least we're not all going crazy) I also wouldn't add the Parmesan while cooking. I ended up with globs of cheese in my pasta that wouldn't separate. Other than that, this makes for a wonderfully healthy and hearty meal- you won't miss the cream sauce at all!

A reasonably hearty, summer pasta dish. The sauce is a nice alternative to more common tomato or cream-based sauces. Although I may make it again, I seriously doubt it will become a staple in my summer cooking repertoire.

It was good but the corn sauce was a little lack-luster, although my family liked it. Maybe too much sweet corn in the recipe for my tastes.

This is an easy, simply, and fantastic summer dish! I usually am annoyed when people completely change a recipe and write a review on how clever they are (um, start a blog instead?) but I must make a suggestion! I crisped a few slices of bacon, which I crumbled and added to the finished product, and cooked the veggies in the bacon fat rather than the olive oil. Bacon makes everything better!

What this recipe is good for is the corn pasta sauce technique. Otherwise it's a springboard for something much better than just as written. Peas not in season with corn around us. So I used zucchini and green beans, which I sauteed with garlic. Also used parsley and oregano along with basil. Ended up with something like alfredo (because of the body of the pureed corn) but much lighter. Kids loved it.

Haven't tried this yet, but it is indeed baby tomatoes according to the same recipe on Bon Appetit's website.

Lame, totally lame.

I am suspecting the controversial "bab" tomatoes...are Baby tomatoes

This was an excellent recipe! Very tasty and very good with other veggies from the garden. I used broccoli and added garlic for a change. I also used a little less basil that what the recipe calls for. It was a big hit!!

I thought this recipe was OK. I will make it again, but only because it's really easy and my toddler liked it. I made some changes. I used 1 TBS of oil vs. 3. I added 2 minced garlic cloves. I couldn't find the "bab" tomatoes so I used a 14.5 oz can of sliced tomatoes with italian herbs. I also found 3/4 of a cup of cheese to be too much. I only used 1/3 of a cup when I made it and the amount seemed adequate.I would NOT add the cheese while cooking. It made a huge, gloppy mess. I would sprinkle the cheese on top when served.

Awesome - so light, fresh and delicious. The parm cheese and a little garlic make it. My husband and I loved this easy, pretty dish.

This was a good summer dish. I used zucchini instead of peas. I also added a bit of red pepper flakes and drizzled garlic olive oil on before eating. Found that the corn is hard to roll up when eating the linguini. Good overall dish!

I'd give it a higher rating if I knew what a "bab" tomato was....

This was a nice quick easy summer weeknight meal. It made more like 4 main course servings though. I can't imagine 2 of us eating all of this!

Great with lemon pasta. Balances the sweetness of the corn.

This is an excellent summer dish. I think what really made it was using a fresh garlic pasta as opposed to the box kind. Leftovers were good too!

Very good although there seemed to be a bit too much corn when I doubled it. Next time I may roast the corn and snap peas first. The whole family loved it. Definitely a do again.

YUMMY!!!!! We loved it. Ate it as a entre (doubled the pasta and such). The kids even asked for seconds.

This was delicious! Even using whole wheat linguine and frozen corn it was fantastic. And then I topped the servings with baked scallops I had first rolled in panko and parmesan and of course drizzled with butter. By that time we were having non-vegetarian dinner party food on a Tuesday night.
