I really enjoyed the flavor of this dressing, but the texture was a little too thick for greens/salad. I had to add more water and oil that ultimately made the great flavor less intense. Might try mixing in the food processor next time.

The recipe is a good starting point and I am happy with the end result. As written, the dressnig is too salty and the flavors are muted. I added another tsp of honey and two more tsp of rice vinegar. Since it still needed lightening up, I added the juice from half an orange and that seemed to do the trick.

Absolutely delicious! I just served this for lunch on a salad of Romaine, chickpeas, more grated carrots, and grilled chicken. This will be one of my go-to salad dressing recipes.

Loved this dressing. Tossed it with hearts of romaine, tomatoes and avocado. Served as a side with Thai coconut curry. Everyone raved.
