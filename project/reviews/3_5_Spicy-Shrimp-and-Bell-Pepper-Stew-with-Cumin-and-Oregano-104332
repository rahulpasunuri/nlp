I made one substitution: a 14.5-oz. can of tomatoes for the tomato paste. Otherwise followed the recipe to the letter, and it was delicious! Not to mention extremely easy and fast to pull together on a week night when we both got home late.

It's probably not fair to rate this, as I made some big changes. Added the oregano and cumin, along with a bit of ground chipotle chili pepper, smoked paprika and salt and pepper to the pot first, and heated until the scent came up. Then added olive oil, sauteed the onions and peppers, then added a can of diced tomatoes with liquid and subbed chicken stock for the wine and water. I finished this with the parsley and a spritz of lime juice, cooking the shrimp in the pot. My family loved this and my husband has asked for it a few times since, which is amazing since he's a picky eater. Paired with crusty bread.

Like other reviewers I used diced tomatoes and all wine. Was a little too liquidy and not spicy enough so I added a half tea spoon each cayenne, paprika, and chilli powder. Also I used one whole green bell pepper rather than half a green and half a red. Between the red tomatoes and the green pepper it came out looking very nice. Next time I might try making it with beer instead of wine.

Simply amazing. The shrimp shell stock in place of water tip really takes this dish to the next level. My husband was eager to have the left overs the next day which is rare for him as he hates left overs. Not in the case of this dish. Can we say dinner staple?

I modified this by adding a generous tablespoon of paprika. Also I didn't have any tomato paste so I used a fresh tomato sauce instead - the tomato taste came out just right. This stew was absolutely delicious with rice for dinner, and just as delicious with crsuty bread for lunch the next day. Will definately make it again!

This recipe was so so. I don't think we will make it again, but if I did, I would cut the tomato paste in half and add canned diced tomatoes or whole tomatoes. A much better epicurious dish is Orzo with shrimp, feta cheese and white wine. It also has tomatoes.

I made this for a dinner party, and they all loved it. I paired it with the tumeric rice with peas. I prepped the sauce and kept it at a low simmer for 1 hour, and threw in the shrimp in the last 5 minutes. This made it really easy. My friends mopped up the sauce with their bread.

Really good, however based upon the changes recomended in previous reviews. Did not try first time without changing. I also made a shrimp stock out of the shells, and used in in the place of the water.

tremendous. perfect balance of flavors.

After reading ALL the reviews I doctored it up with a can of diced tomatoes, used 1 tablespoon of tomato paste, about 1/2 c wine, more veggies and the result was great. Seved it over the Cuban Style Rice and Beans for a very nice dinner. Also, I used medium shrimp and added 1 precooked and sliced Italian sausage.

Quick and simple dish for the whole family. I added a can of diced tomatoes, which made the dish more stew-like. Kind of like Shrimp Creole Cuban style.

About 10 days ago I started to make this recipe. I made the sauce portion, up to when the wine was to be added, and then refrigerated it so that the next night I would only have to mess with peeling and deveining the shrimp. (Did add extra oregano and cumin, subbed Italian style tomatoes for the tomato paste, as suggested by reviewers.) Well, as things go, I was unable to make the dish the next night, so I froze the sauce until today, when I made the dish. But tonight I TOTALLY FORGOT to marinate the shrimp. Even with this big boo-boo it turned out DELICIOUS. Can only imagine how special it would have been if I had made it the correct way, hence the 4 star rating. Served it with hot cooked fettuccini and www.bhg.com's "Stuffed Zucchini". Delicious meal. Do try this shrimp!!!

Forget the Tomato paste, and use a large can of italien stewed tomatoes... Simmer at a high heat with lots of oil, garlic and onions.... and you can't go wrong! It's become a new family favorite.

This was awful! Though it had so many spices in it, it tasted bland. Never make this "mistake" again.

The next time I make this recipe there will be only 1/2 of the tomato paste and I will add 1/4 cup of sweet chili sauce to reduce the overall acidity and spice up the flavour some.

A keeper, low impact flavors makes this dish tops.

Very good. Home-made tomato sauce is an improvement. White wine or beer instead of water make it tastier

Rating: 3
Very savory. Also prepared with chicken and worked well. Added extra wine/lime and subbed parley with cilantro. A little sour cream, cheese and avocado finish it nicely.

Oh my goodness this was so good! I took the advice of other reviewers and added a can of whole tomatos and alot more spice and it was a winner! What a great weeknight meal, quick easy and delicious.

Oh yeah! This stuff is great. Modified w/ 2 lbs. shrimp, almost a whole can of tomatoes in place of the tomato paste, 2 red bell peppers instead of the green, and a whole lot more spice. Also let it cook a lot longer than stated. Didn't bother with the suggested side of rice and beans, just served over plain old white rice and bread. Everyone was happy.

I served this at our annual soup and stew party -it was the first one (there were 6 others to choose from) to disappear! I took the advice of other reviewers and added crumbled mild italian sausage,more wine, less water, and a can of diced tomatoes. Delicious!

This dish tastes great and is simple to prepare, even for the cooking-impaired. It's one of the few new recipes I've tried that my husband has asked for again and again.

Great recipe - easy and delicious. Made the sauce in advance and added the shrimp after reheating. Used more peppers.

This dish was very good, I made a few changes in the recipe, just 1 cup of wine 1 cup of water and added mushrooms,served it over buttered spagetti noodles. Gave the house a nice aroma and will be making this again.

Serves well over Cuban black beans.

I made a few changes the first time around and liked the results so much that I've incorporated them into the recipe each time I make it. In addition to shrimp, I dump in sauteed and sliced up spicy turkey sausage. I cut back on the vino a bit and used canned plum tomatoes (about 1/2 a large can) instead of tomato paste.

Rating: 3
I thought that this was excellent. I made everything ahead and then just added the shrimp when I was reheating the sauce. The beans and rice are lot of work and I'm not sure if they are worth the effort. I doubled the hot-pepper flakes and felt the heat was more in line with cuban cuisine. I will definitely make again.

This stew was so good! I followed the recipe to the letter, but only used one pound of shrimp. The sauce was incredibly tasty. One complaint, however: I served the stew with the suggested beans and rice dish, but will never bother with the rice again. It's a lot of work to make the two dishes together, and the rice was mediocre at best. Plain white rice would be better to soak up all that lovely sauce. This one's a keeper.

The key to this recipe is browning the onions thoroughly before going to the next step. This dish was great. We served it with jasmine rice and the empanados from the same issue of Bon App.

Made this for a small dinner party and everyone loved it. I agree that it must be served with the Cuban-style Red Beans & Rice. Made only minor change by adding a little more crushed red pepper and a little less tomato paste. Definately will make this dish again.

Rating: 3
Ok, but the tomato paste overwhelmed the dish. I would rather have used the shrimp in a gumbo or something cajun which it is similar to.

I originally served this recipe at an 80th birthday party for my mother-in-law. I served 65 people. This was served along with black beans/rice, white rice, platanos, roast pork, roast turkey (breasts), yuca, etc. More raves came from the shimp that anything else. Went through 18 lbs of this most delicious recipe. I was asked for this recipe by no less than 20 of the guests. GREAT DISH

my only complaint was not enough sauce!... It was soo flavorful and tasty!.. I served this with the red beans and rice included in the article and both turned out really well and definitely need each other.

Rating: 3
This was and excellent recipe with great flavor. However, only if served with the side dish of Cuban-Style Red Beans and Rice that was featured in the same article. I think these two recipes should be linked (within Epicurious) because the stew would not be good on it's own. It would be like eating spaghetti sauce without pasta.

Rating: 2
I agree with the previous reviewer. This looked delicious in the magazine, but it certainly wasn't anything special. It could be made much more simply by sauteing onions, garlic, and peppers, adding tomatoes and spices. Leave out the wine (drink it with dinner), and add the shrimp a few minutes before serving, along with a bunch of freshly chopped cilantro and chopped green onions. That's how I make shrimp or fish in the Sonoran Mexican way. We grew up eating this style of meal (camerones rancheros) and it is much tastier and easier than the Cuban shrimp stew.

Rating: 2
I followed the recipe to the letter because of its Cuban roots; I figured it would be something delicious and different. But the end result isn't anything "Wow" or exciting. It's not bad, but it's not great. I would use the shrimp on something else. Though I do think if you're looking for a good alternative to chili for a big gathering (such as a Super Bowl party -- GO RAVENS!) this is worth making.
