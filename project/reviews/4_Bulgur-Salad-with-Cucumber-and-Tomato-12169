Didn't have cucumber, so used double amounts of tomato. Also substututes a shallot for the scallion. Turned out really delicious. Husband raved!

This dish was SO good!! I was completely blown away. This is significantly better than any other tomato cucumber recipe I've ever made. I followed the recipe exactly as written. Yum!!!

Excellent and so refreshing! Delicate in taste... luckily no jalapeno, tabasco, hot chili and the trendy like. Added some toasted pecans as per another Gourmet recipe : it gave it crunch and made a whole meal of the salad. Miam!

Very good, my wife and I both liked it. Light, and refreshing that goes great with fish.
