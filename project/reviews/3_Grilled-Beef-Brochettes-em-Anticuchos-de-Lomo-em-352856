This recipe is very easy and delicious. Great for a dinner party because most of the prep can be done in advance. I used sirloin tips instead of flatiron steak and it worked great. Also, I used the broiler instead of the grill. No grill marks but they were still mighty tasty. It's the marinade and the quality of the beef that matter. Took about 6 minutes under the broiler.
