I had to make this twice before reviewing, because it turned out so poorly when I followed the directions. First, being a single person, I browned one chicken breast half in a generous teaspoon of oil. For the sauce, I cut the ingredients in half and omitted the cream altogether. It's the cream that gives it an unappetizing color, and it doesn't seem to add anything. I put the breast back in the pan, without reducing the sauce first, covered it, and cooked it another 15 minutes to reach 165 degrees. The sauce was nicely thickened and tasted delicious with steamed green beans.

Have made this twice and will continue to make it. My husband, who does not like cranberries, loves this dish. It's an easy weeknight meal with lots of flavor.

I have to confess that I don't eat poultry so this review is based on hearsay evidence from my family. Both my husband and my daughter thought this chicken tasted like 'restaurant' chicken in a good way and both have raved about it to their friends and have asked me to include it in my regular rotation! I prepared it exactly as described though I found that the sauce did not thicken in the time prescribed. However, once I added the chicken to the pan and increased the heat a little, I ended up with a delicious sauce (or so I'm told!) that really needs some rice or mashed potatoes with which to enjoy every last drop!

Followed most of the suggestions by other reviews although I used rosemary vs thyme. Also made my own cranberry sauce: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Cranberry-Sauce-with-Port-and-Cinnamon-240403 Chicken cooks way slower. Next time I might try to bake it after first pull out of the pan, then add to the "gravy" mixture. Did add cornstarch and made sauce like my mom made gravy. . . .great with rice. Made jeweled basmati rice with dried fruits - nice together.

Easy and tasty. I made it without the dairy.... just added flour to thicken.

It was good but I wished the sauce were thicker. I was thin so I thickened it with a bit of corn starch.

I came across this in the magazine, and made it for a group in Nantucket during the cranberry festival. It is super easy, fast, and a hit every time.

Even my duaghter-in-law, who is not a mustard fan, enjoyed this dish. I did not bother to cook the sauce down as much as recommended before returning the chicken to the sauce, and I used sour cream instead of cream. Luckily, I had fresh thyme in my herb garden, which was a big flavor enhancer. This dish had a delicious sauce to pour over hand mashed potatoes. I will use this as a company dish for sure.

Really great and quick. Used whole milk not whipping. Chicken took an extra 10 minutes to cook at end and I had to add more liquid. Used skinless and it turned out tneder. I will make again.

This was a really easy and tasty recipe. I skipped with whipping cream, used the whole can of cranberry sauce and twice the OJ & mustard. I served it with buttery rice and steamed peas. For a fast recipe it's very good and different!

I loved this recipe, I'm a 16 year old girl who loves to cook for family members, ommitted mustard (yuck) and it tasted awesome. I thought I had over cooked it slightly but it then became a great glaze. I added more cranberry sauce and Orange juice to make it more flavorful. Awesome with coconut rice and green beans.

This is a marvelous recipe! Kid friendly, grownup friendly too! Easy to make, delicious -- and, if I were you, I'd double the recipe as it's nice reheated in the microwave. All in this house loved it!

We loved this dish. Left out the mustard for hubby's sake and it was delicious! Also threw in some fresh rosemary at the end.

this recipe is very easy and really delicious. A nice meal to throw on when you are running late. I use fat free Half and Half that pours and has as long date. so it makes is low in fat and good what a combination!

This was a nice simple recipe and I thought it was quite tasty. I doubled the sauce, but I think I'll at least triple it next time. Maybe I'll even adjust the proportions so that I don't have any cranberry sauce leftover. I do hate a recipe that only calls for a little whipping cream... what are you supposed to do with the rest? On this rare occasion, I happened to have some leftover so I used it. I don't think it really added a lot so next time I'll either leave it out or use milk. I served it over rice.

I thought this dish was just ok. My husband enjoyed it more than I did. It did turn out with that odd pink color everyone mentioned.

This recipe couldn't have been easier to make! I follow the suggestions in previous reviews and did not use the whipping cream...it wasn't missed. The flavor and thickness was perfect.

This is a terrific weeknight recipe - easy to throw together, low fat and kids like it. I don't use the cream and the sauce thickens great without it. It is NOT pinkish grey as stated previously - mine is always a nice reddish brown. I like it with roasted garlic red potatoes.

A very fine dish. I made plenty of extra sauce but did not include any cream. This resulted in a lower fat, colorful sauce that had a pleasant bite. The family raved.

I have made this recipe several times. It is flavorful, easy to prepare and looks appealing when served. I serve the chicken separate from the side dishes.

Wow! This recipe is so easy AND delicious! I didn't have any orange juice so I just left it out and it was still wonderful. We didn't think it was bland at all - a magnificent blend of sweet and salty.

This was bland, blah and b-o-r-i-n-g, with hardly any flavor! If you want a GREAT recipe for Chicken with Cranberries & Mustard Sauce, look on the back of a bag of "Craisins" (dried cranberries)..it's beautiful, delicious and EASY!

Bland and boring, the color was a pinkish grey, not worth it at all.

We all (adults) enjoyed it. Definitely would make it again. Unusual flavor. I added sauteed onions to enhance the flavor and a small amount of flour to thicken.

A quick, easy recipe perfect for putting together in little time. We'll definitely make it again. The sauce is a nice balance of sweet and savory. Good recipe for an impromptu meal with friends.

This recipe is very easy to prepare and the sauce is what makes this dish so good. My family loved it. I served it over mash potatoes which was different but gave this dish a great flavor. I used the chicken without the skin and the chicken came out so tender after simmering in the sauce.I would make this dish one of my favorites.

This recipe was very good. I served it over rice. The rice and the sauce went well together. It was a great way to get rid of left over cranberry. I used more cranberry and more cream than called for. By the way there is an excellent maple cranberry sauce I got from this site.

My husband and I loved this recipe. He is a picky eater, and not big on cranberries. He put this up there with one of our other favorite chicken recipes, and even thought that it would be good for guests. I'm not so sure, since the color of the sauce is unusual; maybe for artistic guests...

I think this is a wonderful meal! The sauce is reminiscent of Thanksgiving but clearly spicy. I DO think the tastes go together and make this as a staple in our household. It goes very well with mashed potatoes, simple salad with a light vinigrette and plain steamed green vegies.

I served this dish last night with rice and green beans. I agree that you need simple accompaniments that won't clash with the strong sauce. It turned out absolutely wonderful! I wouldn't hesitate to serve to guests.

Very nice light flavored sauce. As my husband is an avid mustard-hater, I only used 1T of dijon. Took 3 times as long to get the sauce to thicken though. Served it with jasmine rice, slightly undercooked to add texture. I think I'll experiment with other spices to add a little kick next time.

Of course I should have known: mustard will make a sauce taste pungent, and it did taste pungent. I didn't think cranberry and mustard go together all that well. Also, the color of the sauce was of course exactly what you would imagine from reading the list of ingredients: pinkish-grey, not very appetizing. The chicken pieces tasted alright, because they only carried a hint of the taste. We ended up eating the chicken without the overpowering sauce and butter on the mashed potatoes. Still, I don't think this recipe is bad per se, you just have to be a mustard lover to appreciate it.

Cranberries are not just for Thanksgiving!! This was wonderful with very little prep. I did double the sauce and added extra fresh thyme. It calls for very simple sides--a chilled asparagus vinaigrette works well. I will definitely make this again.

I made this dish for my family last night because it was a little chilly outside (since all it seems to do is rain, rain, rain these days!). It was very tasty, even my six year old son who hardly eats anything liked it! The sauce was delicious! I served it with broccoli and egg noodles. It was simple and there was no chopping of onions, which is tops in my book! This is a real keeper!

I love cranberry sauce and can't wait to use it in this recipe instead of waiting until the holidays to have this sauce. I'll make it this week.

Well while there are backyard BBQ's going on in parts of the country, there was a back yard thunderstorm going on here. Let me tell you this is very, very good, and pretty simple. Enjoy!

I have not tried this, but it seems strange that Bon Appetit would include this recipe now, rather than wait when more of us are in more of a festive, holidays-oriented frame of mind. I'm not sure about the rest of the country, but I'm still enjoying backyard barbecues and homemade berry pies. I'll rate this recipe come mid November!
