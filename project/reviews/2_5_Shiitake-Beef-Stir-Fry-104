So many ingredients, very minimal use of all the ingredients, so many steps in the process - all for a meal with no taste. Who adds salt to a meal with soy sauce? Oh well - better luck next time.

For those who want a fuller flavour when doing stur-fry but aren't interested in a mouth on fire: simply substitute the hot water for a broth that matches the meat you are stur-frying. In this case use beef broth. It makes a world of difference in the flavour.

Surprisingly boring taste and it didn't make enough sauce. I also added garlic chili sauce and more soy once the dish was finished. There must be richer tasting low fat stirfries than this!

I thought the recipe turned out very bland. Needs more spice, I added chili-garlic sauce at the end but that didn't do the trick. It was edible, just not special. Don't try this recipe if you like spicy, very flavorful Chinese stir-frys.

If you like stir fry, you'll love this. I could not get shitake mushrooms, so used fresh white mushrooms, and marsala instead of sherry. I also added a little red bell pepper, which made a good color presentation but not necessary for taste. This will definitely be a keeper.

A nice flavour combination. I used fresh shiitakes instead of dried so I substituted water and a bit more soy sauce for the liquid. I also added a dash of hot pepper sauce and half a red pepper, sliced. Luckily, I doubled the recipe so we have leftovers for lunch tomorrow!!
