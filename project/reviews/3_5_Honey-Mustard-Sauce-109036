Very, very good & easy to make. I mad eit exactly as is, and it was perfect for ham.

Thought this worked out rather nicely. I didn't have dijon so I used spicy brown, but I liked the additional kick. Served it with the pigs-in-a-blanket lollipops recipe from Cookie at a bachelorette party. It was a hit!

I enjoy this recipe as an accompaniment to grilled salmon and as a dressing for mixed salad greens, but I did not find it suitable as a dipping sauce for chicken fingers (which was what I was looking for when I first came across it). Extremely quick and easy to make.

I didn't add any salt and the sauce was delicious. I served it with chicken breast tenders coated with a mixture of Panko and shredded coconut and fried until golden.

I agree too salty. Instead of adding salt, add low sodium soy sauce and a nice squeeze of fresh lemon. You will notice a fresh difference.

This was very salty. I ended up adding more mayo and mustard with maple syrup.

I am giving this a 4 star rating based on a combination of taste and prep time. This literally takes less then 2 minutes to make and is better then any store bought honey mustard sauce. I think you can find a better honey mustard sauce on this site, but based on the prep time this a definite keeper.
