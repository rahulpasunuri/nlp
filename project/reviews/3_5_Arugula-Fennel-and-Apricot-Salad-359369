We had this as part of our Christmas Eve dinner and ever since, my teenagers, who have to be coerced into eating their salad have asked when we are having it again. Very easy and quite delicious. I left off the apricots as I couldn't find any that looked decent.

I changed a bit this receipe and it was a huge success. To intensify the sweetness, I replaced the fresh apricot by dried ones (cut in small pieces). I used mâche lettuce for lighter taste . For the dressing : canola oil, rice vinager, salt and shredded nutmeg. Oh and there was no chalots (forgot them!). Very easy to make and impressive results.

The combination of apricot and pistachio is fantastic!

Loved it. Made exactly as written, but added Ricotta Salada Cheese. Was yummy. Served with Grilled Chicken and Flank Steak & Herbed Couscous w/Spring pea.

I made this for a dinner party last night and paired it with the grilled leg of lamb with ancho chile marinade. I skipped the apricots and pistachios (don't like 'em) and used regular old white wine vinegar instead of white balsamic because I didn't have any (who used up the last and didn't tell me???). The dressing tasted a tad too spicy, so I added more olive oil until it tasted right. I also sprinkled some Feta cheese on top. It was wonderful! Very crisp and refreshing. This is a recipe that can be tweaked successfully. And it was super with the lamb.

This was good but I think I had higher expectations when I read the recipe. The combination sounds like the making for a phenomenal salad, but it didnt stand out. Definitely worth a try but not stellar.
