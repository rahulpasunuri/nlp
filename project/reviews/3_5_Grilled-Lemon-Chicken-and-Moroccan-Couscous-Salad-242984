This is one of my favorite set of recipes. They are healthy, easy to make and delicious. I have made the chicken and couscous exactly as described and they are both delicious.

Love the flavor! Doubled the cumin and added onion. Didn't have raisins as family member hates them, so used dried cranberries which were awesome!

This was delicious! The salad especially will become a new fave. I was a little concerned about the amount of ginger - thought it might be too much, but I would actually bump it up a little next time. Added green onions, which gave it a little extra tang. Don't leave out the raisins! They are a perfect compliment to the lemon dressing! Chicken was really good, but I felt it might be too dry, so I made a sauce out of the left over marinade. Just dropped in a TBSP of butter and a splash of sherry and cooked it down a little. Delicious! Now that we've tried it once and it worked (with very little effort, I might add) we'll do it for company. It's a perfect dish for guests, because you can do all of it in advance except the actual grilling.

I made only the couscous and replaced chicken broth with water, because we had a vegetarian at the dinner table. Maybe that was the difference, because this salad was just okay.

Very good and simple to make. Made as written except the only veggies I had for the couscous was carrots. Used whole wheat couscous and fresh ginger. Will definitely make again.

This is just the perfect stuff that I'm looking for (LOL). Sort of convoluted to do but its oh so worth it in the end& Anyway I also found this site, www.wikichicken.com. Loving it, eating healthy and wise choices!

No grill? No problem. I left the chicken breasts unflattened and baked them in a covered dish for 30 minutes at 375°.

This is a good recipe - both tasty and healthy. The couscous has lots of flavor and an interesting texture. The Moroccan sweet and savory flavor is delicious!

Delicious! The chicken was perfectly fine, but the couscous salad is the star! The contrast between the mild spice and the cool veggies was delightful; and the lemon really brings it all together Will definitely be making the couscous for a future summer picnic!

Great recipe for do-ahead as well. You can make the entire cous cous salad a day ahead of time, and then all you have to do is grill (or roast in the oven, as I did) the chicken. Delicious!

Loved this - it was very flavorful and fresh-tasting. I worried the ground ginger and cinnamon would make the couscous taste too much like a dessert so I doubled the cumin, which I would do again. Only other changes were to cut up the chicken and mix it in with the couscous and I used whole wheat couscous instead of plain.

I followed this recipe exactly except for two things: I used chopped dates instead of raisins and added goat cheese and it was amazing.

I think this would be good too if you added the zest of a lemon or maybe even a lemon AND an orange to it.....YUM

I only used the couscous part of the dish and it was great. I added avocado to it and omitted the cucumbers. the avocado went over really well everyone commented on how surprisingly well it went in the couscous

this is one of my favorite new recipes -- i just loved it! i cut up the chicken and mixed it into the salad which turned out well because i don't think the chicken would have been very interesting on its own. very healthy and flavorful.

Very flavorful and easy to make. Beautiful presentation. Just a little too much lemon for my taste in the salad but I probably wont make that large of an adjustment on it next time. This is definitely going to be a repeat recipe.

Yummy. The couscous was just a tad short on flavor, probably because I misread the recipe and used just 2 Tbsp of lemon juice or a bit less. I think 3 Tbsp would be ideal, and maybe a bit more cumin, 1/8 tsp paprika, 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper, and substitute 1 Tbsp walnut or peanut oil for the olive oil. I'm already salivating at the prospect of trying this again.

We were surprised how bland tasting this was. With far superior recipes out there, we won't be making this again.

I loved the flavors of this dish. The couscous turned out great. I changed it slightly by using an Israeli couscous that's chewier than the kind the recipe calls for and by leaving out the raisins. Very delicious! The chicken was very good and simple...I didn't use an actual grill, which I think would probably bump up my rating slightly. Great dish!

Chicken was just OK and the couscous, even with the magnificent spices, was just so-so. Not worth the effort, will return to my standard couscous salad recipe. B.J. Harrick

As many others have said, the chicken isn't really much to rave about. Would definitely better with a stronger lemon-pepper flavor, but I don't think chicken usually takes on marinades to the extent this one needs it. Definitely a favorite if you like middle eastern food. The couscous is typically middle eastern! Yum! Will make it again.

I cook the chicken on my grill pan and it comes out great. I usually skip the raisins in the couscous - not one of my favorites. You can also use flavored box couscous as a base and just add the veggies to that.

Since others said the chicken was bland, I added about a tablespoon of lemon zest and marinated it overnight. It was a good combination of flavors and I may make it again, but I don't think this recipe is something I will crave.

The couscous is terrific! Made it as written, but without the green beans. The amount of ginger worried me, but when I tasted it I remembered that ginger adds heat, so the salad has a nice warmth to it. A wonderful recipe that I will make again and again. Would be terrific for a crowd.

This fit perfectly with the moroccan chicken recipe I found on this site. The flavors are light and fresh from the lemon, yet complex at the same time. Very tasty, even a hit with kids.

This, too, is just a review of the couscous salad. I made a few changes (doesn't everyone?), and omitted the ground ginger (I didn't want a cookie), and used less tumeric, much less cinnamon, and more cumin. I had no bell peppers, so I used jarred roasted red peppers, finely diced, omitted the green beans and cuke (although the cuke is definitely a good idea), and added finely minced red onion, and finely sliced green onions. I also finely diced the carrots instead of slicing them, soaked the raisins for 10 minutes in hot water to plump them, and added more Spanish EVOO. There was still something not quite right, so I added a drizzle of honey, and a few teaspoons of both red wine vinegar and balsamic vinegar. PERFECTION! Well, at least the original recipe was an inspiration to my creation. But, afterall, experimentation is the fun part of cooking, isn't it?

We are veggies, so I used some homemade seitan chicken for this recipe. It turned out great, and we loved the couscous, I will probably make that again on its own.

This was terrible. The chicken is boring and the couscous was nothing special. There are plenty of other recipes that are worth making.

I review only the couscous salad. I followed the recipe exactly, and it was delicious. The combination of flavors was really wonderful. When I made it for the second time, I changed some ingredients (added garbanzo and omitted carrots and beans) and it was still delicious. My favorite epicurious recipe so far!

Excellent, easy recipe. Made this for dinner last night with ingredients on hand, the only thing I was lacking were the raisins for the couscous. I put less cinnamon and more cumin than called for. I thought the chicken was just right, didn't overpower the salad or vice versa. Both paired quite nicely. I'll be making the couscous for a potluck on Monday, this time with the raisins.

I think you have to really like couscous to like this. I've always found it bland, but thought I'd give this recipe a try. We didn't care for it. It looked nice with all the colors, but the taste just wasn't there. And the chicken was far from lemony. We won't be making this again.

The salad (just as written) is very tasty and is a great dish to take on our weekend sailing trips. Since we enjoy spicy food, so based on other reviewers' comments, I have not tired the chicken. I have made the salad twice, it has received a "4 Flags" rating from our guests and crew. I prepare the salad (landside)the night before we set sail. Have paired it with Steven Raichlen's Berber- Spiced Chicken Breast and an Heirloom Tomato Salad and Basil. This meal is becoming a signature on the "Quaich". Thank you Dorie Greenspan.

We too found the chicken very mundane, but the couscous is a very good version and we will have that again...maybe even with just a rotisserie chicken from the store. I used snow peas instead of green beans or sugar snaps--just like them better.

Made this last night to rave reviews. The couscous salad was outstanding. Have to agree with others that chicken could you a little zing. It was fine but not great. Overall together though it made for an excellent meal on hot summer day.

I thought the chicken was average - not quite lemony enough for me. Perhaps a longer marinading time, or as one reviewer suggests a squeeze just before serving would make it a touch better. However, the couscous is outstanding. It has the perfect blend of spice, sweet, and crunch. It's a beautiful dish and so healthy too (I always use ww couscous)! This will make a wonderful stand alone salad. I can't wait to make it for guests, but not before I savor the leftovers for lunch!

Excellent! The couscous is great even on day two. Stayed crunchy. My fiancee loved it, as did I. I put rosemary and lemon thyme in the marinade for the chicken.

The couscous salad was very attractive and tasty, although I did add additional dressing and salt. I also had to add a little more broth to the couscous. While the vegetables were good and colorful, I found it necessary to blanche the diced green beans and run under cold water to hold the color and crunch. I found the raisins to be an essential additon to balance out the spices. The chicken was fine, but nothing special until I added a squeeze of lemon.

This recipe is pretty good. I used quinoa instead of couscous for an added nutrition boost. The whole "moroccan salad" part came out very salty, though. I ended up adding lots more raisins to counteract the salt.

Fabulous. Really nice flavor. I doubled the cumin, omitted the raisins and opted for the sugar snap peas. I agree: very appealing in appearance. I sliced my chicken after grilling and served it on top of the couscous salad. A keeper!
