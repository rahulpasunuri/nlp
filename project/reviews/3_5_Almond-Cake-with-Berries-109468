I made this for our Gourmet and it is wonderful. I used - 1/2 teaspoon almond extract + 1/4 teaspoon vanilla for the 3/4 teaspoon vanilla. I added all the sugar to the almonds by mistake but it didn't seem to effect the outcome. 18 minutes in the oven - perfect. I served with whipping cream.

I made this cake last night for colleagues and they loved it. I increased the almond extract to 1/4 tsp; next time I'll add some to the batter as well. There were no blackberries in the store so I used blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries (which I sliced). Excellent. Be careful when the cake's in the oven. My oven thermometer is pretty precise, and the cake was done before 18 minutes.

Made this as an Epiphany cake with a 'bean' in it. I used almond meal instead of ground almonds and took advice of others in doubling the almond extract and reducing the vanilla by half. It tasted very good,had a nice crunch to it and was a big hit with a sauce made of fresh blackberries, raspberries, 1/2 cup sugar and juice of 1/2 lemon plus its' zest.

This cake was nothing special. The berry mixture on top was the best part

This is a great recipe. I have made it with a mixture of moss berries, cranberries, and raspberries all picked fresh which are abundant in Alaska in early fall. Wonderful!!!

I made this in February but forgot where I got the recipe; glad to find it again! Because fresh berries were not available I used frozen mixed berries; cooking on top of stove with some sugar added simmering just until reduced down a bit. Set aside to cool. I cut in triangular slices to serve and then added the berry mixture to each individual serving. A dollop of whipped topping 'hide' the fact that the berries were frozen instead of fresh. It was a delicious, light dessert I served after a stir-fry meal. Can't wait to try it again with fresh berries in season! Easy and immpressive lighter cake. Highly recommend it!

Just delicious! For the berries, I tossed a mix of strawberries, blueberries, blackberries and raspberries in Framboise liqueur, mint, sugar and lemon juice. Can't wait to serve this again - perhaps as individual cakes...

Delicious, light and flavorful. I served it with a spiced peach compote and almond whipped cream and people loved it. I baked it for 19 minutes and next time will take it out at 18.

This is the third time I'm serving this recipe for company- I'm substituting cherries for the Berries and serrving it with Mulled wine after bunko- The crowd gives it great reviews!

It is okay but I wouldn't make it again!

I have made this cake three different times. It is quick, light and absolutely beautiful. I use all of the berries it calls for and just pile them high on the cake. I will use the suggestion and add the almond extract to the cake next time - great idea. Once you put the berries on top - plan on eating the whole cake within a couple of hours or it gets a bit soggy. Never a problem in my house!

I made this as per recipe, berries and all. It was ok. Fine warm, but if you can't eat it all at once, I would find another recipe, of just use short cakes, make the berries, and put them on as needed.

This is quick and delicious. I used almond meal from Trader Joe's instead of grinding it, and followed others' suggestions to add 1/8 tsp. almond essence to the batter. I also doubled the sauce amount and slightly cooked the berries in the sauce - it enhanced the berry flavor.

Easy, quick, and the birthday guests loved it. Especially appropriate for a small gathering. Substituting strawberries for blackberries worked fine.

A delicious light dessert. I tweaked: 1/2 tsp vanilla + 1/4 tsp almond extract instead of 3/4 tsp vanilla, and instead of berries, good-quality purchased lemon curd spread on top. Very very easy, and everyone loved it.

Hate to be a nay sayer but I didn't like this cake at all. It was too eggy and had little or no almond flavor even though I toasted the almonds first. I missed the richness of butter.

Loved this!! I put 1 teaspoon of almond extract in the cake instead of berry sauce and it was fabulous. Also used 1/2 cup of sugar in the cake and it was still wonderful!!!

Excellent, so easy to prepare and so quick to bake! I didn't make the berry syrup but I served the cake with strawberries tossed with sugar. A keeper.

I made these as individual cakes using a Texas muffin pan yielding 6 lovely litttle cakes. Like another reviewer, I also added an additional 1/8th tsp of almond extract to the cake batter. Used frozen local blueberries for the sauce which I cooked down in the sugar/water for about 15 mins. Would probably double the sauce next time. A great summer recipe.

I shared this recipe with all of my friends and they really liked it, but I found that it took me a lot longer than it said it would to make. Maybe thats just because I'm new at this baking thing. I served it with jam since I didn't have any berries. It was delish!

This is an easy and delicious dessert. My guests loved it and one asked for the recipe. I think the cake would be good with most summer fresh fruit.

Delicious! My husband must eat gluten-free. I replaced the 1/2 cup of all purpose flour with gluten-free flour (rice/potatoe flour). It turned out great. It was a hit with everyone who had a piece. I also doubled the berry syrup as suggested by other reviewers and am glad I did. Yummy!

This turned out really well. The egg whites make the cake very light. And I topped it with blueberries, raspberries, blackberries and strawberries. Whatever is fresh and in season can be used. I also added some extra almond extract for more flavor. This cake makes a good impression!

I'm not rating it yet since I haven't eaten it....just want to say that the recipe seems to call for waaaay more berries than the picture seems to show.... Otherwise, making it was easy. We'll see after dinner tonight how it tastes!

I made this cake for Mother's Day. My mom is very finicky, but she loved this cake! The almond cake itself is the best part. I will probably cook the berries in the syrup next time.

This was delicious, and very simple to make. My guests loved it. The one thing I did was to toast whole almonds then grind them with the sugar. Great nutty taste.

I made this cake exactly as written with great success. Dessert for a small dinner party and was loved by all. Will definitely make again - a great ending to a spring/summer meal.

First of all, the flavor for the cake was great. I was very disappointed, however, that the cake fell after removing it from the oven (a lot). I probably beat the egg white too long or something, because I wasn't really sure when they were done. I will probably try making this again sometime, really paying attention the egg whites, because the flavor was nice.

This cake was one of the best I've ever had! I used the standard 6 oz chip of raspberries and 6 oz chip of blackberries--and that was enough berries. And instead of grinding almonds, I had almond meal/flour on hand and used a little less than a cup of that. The only thing I might change for next time is making a little more of the syrup. I love the way it soaks into the cake, making it really moist and sweet. The amount called for didn't cover the cake. I also may have added more than 2 egg whites--but it just made it lighter. When you put this cake on a pretty plate and dust with confectioner's sugar, it makes a beautiful dessert to present to guests. Not too heavy or rich. A keeper!
