My Mexican grandmother made a cake like this from a recipe she got from a Salvadoran friend. The recipe she gave me however, was all wrong, didn't work at all. (Although now I wish I'd saved it anyway as it was in her handwriting.) In any case, I was very happy to stumble across this recipe, and overjoyed when it came out tasting just like mi Abuela's. I make this rich, intriguing dessert for special parties and people always love it. Most are so surprised when I tell them the secret ingredient that gives it its name. Oh, and I use 1/2 CUP of parmesan, and it's just right. Thank you for this!

1/2 ounce of parm cheese? Me thinks it should be 1/2 cup or 1/2 lb?! I'd also sub Mexican queso cotija for parm.

I was very intrigued by the idea of a cake recipe with parmesan listed as one of the ingredients but I have to say I was a tad disappointed. Perhaps it would have been more piquant if I used real Italian Parmigiano-Reggiano but instead I used a domestic brand that did not have as much flavor. Also I have no idea if I put too much or too little cheese since I don't own a kitchen scale. It would have been nice if the recipe-writer could have listed a volume measure for the cheese instead of a weight measure. All in all, the cake was similar to pound cake but not quite as good. Some cut-up fruit, e.g., strawberries, might have perked this one up.

I've made this several times and it is always wonderful. I usually add more parmesan than called for.

Good cake on its own, but perfect with coffee.

This is very good, like the description notes, similar to pound cake in consistency. Parmesan somehow makes it a little less sweet than typical sweet breads and cakes. Don't omit the sesame seeds on top - makes for a beautiful presentation: golden brown, with a light yellow crack down the middle, scattered with toasty seeds.

My family could not get enough of this cake. We even enjoyed it toasted in the morning for breakfast.
