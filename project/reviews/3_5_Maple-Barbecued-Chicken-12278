Not worth the effort. Weak, wet sauce. Nothing distinctive about it. Looked a lot like diluted, canned vegetable soup. If you insist on trying - do saute your onions till limp and a bit brown. Did come away from this liking what the brining (w/vinegar, salt, and oil) did for the chicken on the grill as it kept it moist. Boring not bad.

Really good but double the sauce ran out fast.

Only three forks because as is, this recipe is good, but I think with some tweaks to my personal preferences it could be exceptional. I have made it twice, and the first time with greater success which I attribute to reducing the amount of ketchup and subbing balsamic vinegar for cider, and only using half as much. I thought it had a richer saucier taste that way, and it was too tomatoey with all that ketchup. I followed other reviewers advice and blended the onions into the sauce, which was great and so easy. I also added about 2 T pure maple syrup just before brushing the chicken with it to give it an extra maple boost. Will def make again, but with those changes.

Really yummy bbq sauce! I didn't have maple syrup so substituted dark molasses, otherwise I followed the directions exactly. Will definitely make it again.

I made this in a saucepan, cooking the chicken in the bbq sauce while it simmered over low heat, and it was delicious. Easy, too.

Wow! Fabulous sauce and the chicken is nicely moist. Wonderful combination of flavors. I prepared the sauce the way it was written with 2 minor changes. I added a small amount of ground red pepper flakes, and smoothed it all with a blending wand after it had cooled a bit. For the marinade, I substituted white balsamic vinegar for the cider vinegar listed and used a whole fryer (its what we had on hand. Too pretty to cut up). Then let it marinate in an oversized plastic zipper bag for a couple of days before roasting. I found this easy to make and well worth it. We had this for dinner tonight, and my family is still picking at what little is left! Plenty of extra sauce to try with other foods! This will become a common dish in our home!

yeah, this recipe is amazing. I've been making it since 1993. The taste is far superior to any store- bought sauce. Some reviewers have commented on the vinegar taste. This is caused by reducing the sauce down too much. You can prevent this by just keeping an eye on the pot toward the end. Slather lots of sauce on as you BBQ the chicken - baste, flip, repeat.

Outstanding sauce. I made it the day before and marinated the chicken in some of it overnight. I also pureed the remaining sauce to blend in the onion bits and then reduced it further. Make with peppered pita bread and basil potato salad.

Great sauce. The chicken was a wee bit vinegary overall (either from the marinade or from the sauce, hard to say), but tender and juicy for certain. I paired with baked acorn squash with brown sugar and butter. Great heading-into- fall flavors for Indian summer.

Not nearly enough maple flavour for my taste. Next time, I'd just make a regular babrecue sauce and save my maple syrup for something better. Also, I cooked the sauce WAY longer than 50 minutes in order to get the right consistency.

Loved this recipe as did my guests who like myself are transplanted New Englanders, and we really liked the maple syrup flavor. Only marinated the chicken for 5 hours, and yet it was still very moist and tender. Added crushed red peppers and fresh chopped thyme to the sauce. Realized about half way thru simmereing the sauce that it would not be thick enough, so cranked up the heat to a boil til it was a nice creamy consistancy, and then continued for another 45 mins. at a simmer. Ended up with a nice thick glazing sauce, that was also great served on the side. No gas for my outdoor grill, so baked the chicken in the oven @ 350 and basted with the sauce. YUM a real keeper!

Rating: 3
The sauce is very good, if not a bit thin and onion-y (not too strong in onion flavor, just texture). I actually used this sauce on baked chicken thighs, drumstick and bone-in split breasts (about 4 lb total). I poured the sauce on the meat and baked for 1hr 15 min. Very tender, but the sauce didn't form a thick glaze like most barbecue chicken. Still, quite tasty overall and even better when dipped into leftover sauce.

Very tasty. I made this for family last night and everybody was impressed especially with the maple STRONG flavor. Excelent! This is a keeper. We ate that with a mushroom risotto and a green salad. Great dinner!

I didn't make the bbq sauce; but I marinated the chicken in the vinegar, salt and olive oil and grilled it. Wow. Delicious, tender and juicy. Will definitely do that again.

i couldn't taste the maple syrup so took another reviewer's advice and added some molasses too, still not happy i added some crushed garlic and ginger, a sprinkling of chilli flakes, i also substituted the vinegar for 3/4 white wine and 1/4 sherry vinegar......so really quite a different recipe! oops! anyway is to die for :^)

One of the best BBQ recipes around and I will definitely make it again. My family LOVED it!

I recommend use all white meat breasts and marinade them in pieces, skewer them in sweetwater soaked skewers (boil water and sugar then cool to room temp and soak skewers) then grill them as directed and lay one side in finely crushed pine nuts before serving. make good starter too. :)

Used this BBQ Sauce (with a few changes as I combined this recipe with the Molasses BBQ Sauce recipe on this site with GREAT results). Prepared the chicken according to "Clarkes BBQ Chicken" on this site using the Chili rub from the Chili rubbed chicken on this site. Been asked for chicken bbq directions from friends twice now (male friends - ha!). My changes to the sauce: used shallots instead of onions, used only 1 cup of ketchup and added heaping tblspn of tomato paste, used less chicken broth to get a better saucy consistency, used 1/4 cup white wine vinegar with only 1/2 cup cider vinegar and finally used 1/4 cup maple syrup and 1/4 cup molasses. The rest as is. We will never buy bbq sauce again! Can make in advance and freeze it (careful with double batching though - did this once and dbling ingredients doesn't come out the same as the single batch - still good but different consistency). Next time I'm going to try leaving out the ketchup, adding more tomato paste and more maple syrup to make up for the missing sugar in the ketchup. And now this essay is done :) Cooking sure is fun!

so good and easy - though I must admit I made a few changes - fist of all, the chicken sat in the oil/vinegar mixture for 48 not 24 hours (forgot we had plans) - then WHOLE chicken was placed on the rotisserie barbeque instead of in pieces - SOOOOO goood! What is with the incubation? Moisture stays in with the oil soak, vinegar kills bacteria?? Probably not - not strong enough. Don't know but the results were just so good!

Instead of barbequeing this, i broiled the chicken in the oven. I also used skinless chicken. it came out amazing! Put it this way, if my mother liked it, it must be excellent!

I made this dish for Rosh Hashanah dinner and baked it at 350 in the oven, instead of grilling. I also used skinless/boneless breasts and legs and thighs with bones and poured 1/3 of the sauce over the pieces, then baked them in the oven. I heated the rest of the sauce and served it on the side with the roasted chicken pieces. Everyone loved it and felt the extra sauce was perfect. It is also delicious cold the next day. Everyone wanted the recipe.

This was a great recipe. I made twice as much chicken as I thought I needed and I had almost no leftovers. The sauce has just the right amount of sweetness and it carmelizes really nice on the grill. The marinade really keeps the chicken tender.

I decided to make this recipe based on the reviews I had read. It is an excellent recipe and great for an outdoor barbecue. Marinating the chicken overnight gives it incredible moistness and flavor. I loved the BBQ sauce. My guests said this was a great dish. I will make it again and over the winter will bake it in the oven.

We really enjoyed this sauce with just chicken breasts. I did let it simmer longer to get real thick, worth the wait. I made only 1/2 recipe and used it all on 4 breasts. I will make more next time. High on my fav list.

I enjoyed this dish but made some changes. Only used 4 chicken breasts so I cut down the sauce by half. I parboiled some potatoes and baked them with chicken for 1 hour at 350 degrees. Towards the end, I poured the sauce over the chicken and potates and let that baked for another 15 minutes. There is enough time in between steps to clean up, so, after dinner you only have one casserole dish to worry about.

Yum. I do a big batch of drumsticks in the oven. Take care that the maple syrup does not burn. We will do this on the grill in the summer with a good potato salad and corn

EXCELLENT! Got absolutely rave reviews from everyone including my ever-picky father. I used boneless skinless breast fillets instead of the chicken pieces called for in the recipe, and was thrilled with the result. Made yummy lunch the following day when reheated and put on a squishy fresh bread roll!

The chicken turned out very juicy; however the fav turned out to be the bbq sauce. Because I live in a small apt (no grill), I baked the chicken @350 f for an hour, then added the sauce, baked for another 15 min, then broiled to have some colour on top. Plenty of leftovers. Would consider making this again for large groups, not really for weekday dinners.

This New Hampshire cook made this as listed. It was just wonderful. The only alteration was I cooked the chicken - after marinating - in a low oven (300 degrees) for about an hour. Then, I added the sauce on put it on the grill. My entire guest list thought the chicken was "the best!" Do try the recipe, I know you'll be pleased.

For those of you who didn't love the sauce/time factor but like the maple taste, I admit to cheating and adding some good maple syrup to my favorite brand of BBQ sauce...it's not bad as long as you don't buy one that is already very sweet.

I loved it, made as directed. My husband said that it was the best barbecue sauce he'd ever had. I doubt that, but it was nice to hear anyway. I had to do the chicken in the oven, due to a grill SNAFU, but it was really good.

Me modified the recipe based upon the ingredients we had on hand and Loved it! We substituted Balsamic vinegar for the cider vinegar, cut the ketchup in half (that was all we had), and did not add the chicken broth (didn't have any), and marinated for only 1 1/2 hrs. The end result was sweet, moist and delicious. I feel that the balsamic was a nice addition. A recipe for onion lovers!

Another winner from Epicurious! This chicken grills perfectly--if you remember to control the flame on your grill. Too much fire will result in a still tasty--but charred entree! A very easy recipe to divide by half and even less. But always make a full batch of the yummy sauce. Maple syrup barbeque sauce for a New England cookout--it doesn't get any better! Kudos!

This is really wonderful; the sweet/tangy balance is right where it needs to be. Be sure when grilling to wait until the chicken is just about completely done before you begin applying the sauce, otherwise it will scorch big-time. Next time I make it, I'll also make a point of wiping the chicken pieces after I take them out of the marinade . . . the flare-ups might be a little less exciting.

I agree that the sauce is quite good -- a welcome Yankee contribution in a field dominated by regions South and West. The grilling technique is a problem, though -- the sugars in the sauce will carbonize in a flash. The surest way to avoid charring is to build a smaller fire and then cook the chicken off the flame (and therefore longer).

To die for. The Rolls-Royce of the barbacued chickens. Can't wait to taste it with ribs.

this is one of my favorite bbq recipes. the oil in the marinde will cause the coals to flame, so unless you like the flavor of charred chicken make sure you let as much marinade drain off the chicken as possible before putting it on the grill and also cover the top of the grill and reduce the amount of air to the grill as much as possible. lastly, the recipe works best with a dark amber maple syrup.
