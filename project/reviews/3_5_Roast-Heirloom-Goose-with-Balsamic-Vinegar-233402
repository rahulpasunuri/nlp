I've made Goose every Thanksgiving for the last 25 years and the only thing this recipe left out was blanching the goose briefly in boiling water before drying in the fridge. If you prize crispy skin you won't skip drying the goose! A day in the fridge uncovered at least!

Well this is a certain Holiday Table item. I didnt have any 12 or 25 year old anything (except grand kids and neighbors)to pour on or drizzle over this so i made my own, turned out quite good for the occasion. Best wishes and Merry Christmas to all from the Poker Guys.

to correct my last review (I wish Epi would let you edit your reviews after they are posted!!!) I made half the recipe, not half a goose. Still think its fabulous and will still making whole recipe this year. To the person who only stuffs with fruit and serves with brown gravy, I make goose most years and there are many, many recipes out there that do not call for a fruit stuffing or brown gravy

I frequently make goose for Xmas and I wanted to test this recipe (I did half a goose). It was fabulous and i will definitely be making the full recipe for myfamily this year. I think I've left it too late to order the heritage goose unfortunately, but look forward to trying next year. I really don't understand people who feel compelled to comment without even having tried the recipe.

Are Heirloom geese really any better than a normal goose?

This was in the latest Bon Appetit (Dec 05) and I decided I had to make it because it seemed so simple. It was easy to prepare unlike many other recipes for goose, and contrary to the opinion of one of the other reviewers, who didn't make the dish but still felt an obligation to rate it, it was delicious and had a wonderful aroma from the herbs. It cooked quickly and stayed juicy. I have made many goose dishes over the years and on the reward for the work scale, this rates very high on the reward side. Try it you'll like it.

To G Geist: You should actually test out a recipe before you rate it.... commenting is OK but not rating... basic rule of engagement here.
