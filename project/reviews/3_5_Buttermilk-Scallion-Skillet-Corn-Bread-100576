This was a lovely traditional cornbread though mine came out a tad too salty. I also used lard in the pan (I have a great source for lard!). I got a nice crust on the bottom but others may not like to so dark. May make this one again, the yellow Jiffy mix is really good too so I'm not sure if this was worth the extra effort.

This cornbread was perfect and worth dirtying more bowls to beat the eggs separately. I did substitute butter and canola oil for the bacon fat since I was serving it to a vegetarian and didn't have shortening--it had a beautiful golden crust.

I made this but without whipping the eggs at all. It turned out just fine. I can't imagine so much work just for cornbread. btw, I do substitute plain yogurt and some milk for buttermilk if I don't have any on hand, and that is what I did this time too...

This recipe is much too much work for average results. I found it dry and it really lacked flavor. The others that I made it for agreed that a box of Jiffy corn bread mix made with creamed corn is much better than this.

This was absolutely delicious and easy to make. My friends loved it warm with fresh butter. Next time I might try undercooking slightly to preserve more of the moistness of the recipe.

Does anyone know if you can substitute the buttermilk with sour cream and/or non-fat yogurt?

Fantastic recipe. I really wanted to make corn bread to serve with chipotle black beans and rice but was hesitant after trying so many bad recipes. I'm glad I gave this one a try because the results were stupendous. I added one more tablespoon of sugar, which just added a touch of sweetness, but not enough for my husband who doesn't like sweets to notice. I also used canola oil in the pan instead of shortening, which didn't affect the taste or the crumb, just the healthfulness of the recipe. The bread baked up light and fluffy with a good crumb that held together when sliced and was moist but not cloying or wet. My husband continued to eat the corn bread the next day and polished it off in no time. I can't wait to make this recipe again!

Oh so good! The lightest, thickest, and most moist cornbread I've ever made. This rose in the oven to be almost 3 inches thick. It is not a sweet cornbread at all, so if you're looking for that, look elsewhere. I think adding a lot of sugar to this recipe would make it a little strange. I only made 2 changes. First, I used half whole-wheat flour. Second, instead of shortening in the pan, I used 1 Tablespoon canola oil and 1/2 Tablespoon butter. That gave it a nice buttery crust, and the oil kept the butter from burning.

I made this for a BBQ along with baked beans, to everyone's rave. I was skeptical about using folded egg whites, I never saw that in cornbread, but it worked. Light, airy, and moist! It takes a little longer to assemble unless you have 2 machines for whipping whites and paddling the corn mixture. Worth it! This would be great for making a stufing with country sausage.

It is a great cornbread, but the timing is all about the oven, I think. Mine took 30 minutes. It's especially attractive as well as delicious.

My husband really liked this corn bread. He prefers savory, while I like it a little sweeter. Next time, I'll try adding more sugar. I served it with some maple butter to sweeten it up.

This was a great recipe! (Definately use the rendered bacon fat, as it will add flavor.) I added (about) a 1/2 cup of sugar, pieces of cooked bacon and extra scallions and everyone LOVED this dish.

The recipe called for a 20-25 minute cooking time, and mine was still raw (doughy in center). Next time I will double the cooking time to 40 minutes. This was over all pretty good. It did lack something - perhaps bacon grease would have been better than shortening to grease pan.

This recipe definitely goes to the top of the list.Delicious with southern fried chicken. Keep your eye on it in the oven,mine was done in 18 mins.
