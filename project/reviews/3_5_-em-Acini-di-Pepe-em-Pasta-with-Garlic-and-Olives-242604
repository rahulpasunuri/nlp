Simple, quick side dish that my husband and I really enjoyed. However, we thought it was considerably more flavoful warm than at room temperature. Personaly, I would add a touch more olives and red pepper next time. A receipe worth holding on to.

This is simple little side dish that we loved. I generally have to have pasta wherever possible (!) and this is an easy little dish to whip up.

Made the recipe as is with a tri-colored and flavored orzo and found that the two tablespoons of butter and one tablespoon of olive oil left it too oily and slick for my taste. I found it bland overall as well, even though the orzo was mildly flavored and after seasoning with some salt and pepper as directed. In order to dilute the greasiness while trying to add some flavor, I added a cup of grape tomatoes and what was left in a bag of frozen peas, almost a cup.

This one warrants 4 forks b/c it is both exceptionally easy and tasty. Perfect side dish for many dishes. I usually serve it w/ cedar planked salmon, or grilled lamb chops or chicken (try the lemon garlic oregano chicken). Have made it several times w/ orzo. I also add some finely chopped parsley to give it some color.

Made this tonight with the orzo since I couldn't find acini di pepe. I didn't substitute anything else. Earthy, spicy, delicious, and super, super easy. Even for a guy who doesn't cook much. What would I do without epicurious?
