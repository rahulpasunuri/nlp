This recipe sounds great. But does anybody know how many persons this recipe serves? I would like to make this for 35 persons and will have to increase the amounts, but by how much? Usually this information is given.

Outstanding salad! Very delicious combination. I think key is getting the proportions of the seafood/potatoes and "dressing" right. We were a little worried about the lime juice being overpowering, but it really made this salad. Going to try it in some croissants as a seafood croissant sandwich.

Solid 4 forks! I like this much better than pasta-based seafood salads, and the lime is wonderful in it. I did modify the recipe a bit. I used more potatoes than recommended, and cut back on the smoked salmon (using only 5 oz). I also increased the cilantro to about 2-3 Tbsp and omitted the anchovies. I really loved this - the lime flavor is wonderful. But I'm glad I left out the anchovies (too salty), and next time I would leave out the smoked salmon too. (I'm just not a big fan).

I would have given it 2 stars but my teen son and hubby enjoyed it much more than I. I found it a bit bland and added some "sandwich spread". It does need the entire amount of lime juice which I thought would be too much.

This was a perfect addition to our New Years' Eve spread! Fresh, easy, the perfect combination of herbs. Even my kids liked it! You can alter the balance of seafood depending on what you have, but the combination of crab, shrimp, and smoked salmon is delicious!
