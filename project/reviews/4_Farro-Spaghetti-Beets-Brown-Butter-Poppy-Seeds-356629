So surprising and delicious! I altered the beet-roasting per others' suggestions. I coated the beets w/ oil in the roasting pan, added the water, then covered w/ tin foil to avoid splattering the oven. Oh! And I lowered the heat on the butter-melting at the start, so I didn't burn it while working on the other ingredients. Definitely a success!

The recipe calls for putting the butter into a pan with the heat on "high" to brown. I can brown butter but not with a pan on "high" heat, particularly when the recipe calls for the pan remaining on high with the butter while I cook other ingredients in it. Perhaps it's a limitation on my part but at this point in the recipe I had to deviate. Browned the butter on the appropriate setting for my stove, added the poppy seeds and toasted, then turned the heat up when I added the beets and remaining ingredients to the pan. That worked but I'll need to play with the heat some more next time. Results were a lovely vegetarian dish.

Beautiful *and* delicious! Other than adding some freshly ground black pepper to the sauce, we didn't change a thing. We used a gluten-free quinoa, amaranth and brown rice pasta and to follow "proper food combining" principles, we substituted guacamole (made with lemon juice instead of lime) for the goat cheese, which added a hint of garlic. This created a lovely colour contrast (and kept it vegan, for those who avoid dairy). My husband said he would eat this dish every week!

so different from any pasta I've ever had! Served it as part of a 4 course dinner party and everyone was very impressed. Would also go nicely with fish.

This was a really strange dish. I didn't find it to have nearly as much flavor as I was expecting, but there was something strangely appealing about it. The goat cheese is absolutely essential in this dish; it would be inedible without it. Because of the lack of flavor, I added a bunch of dried herbs to it (basil, rosemary, oregano). Probably won't be making again.

I thought this recipe was a little unusual but thought I would give it a shot. I was pleasantly surprised. I made the recipe as written but decided that a little more goat cheese wasn't a bad idea. This is going on the list as one of my favorite pasta dishes.

This dish is both easy and delicious. The beet-roasting method wasn't great, though-- the oil spattered all over the oven and filled my kitchen with smoke. I tried covering the glass dish with tinfoil and reducing cook time 15-20 min., and that worked well for me.

I learned to love beets from the time I spent living in Russia, but this recipe is much more subtly flavored than most of the Eastern European beet dishes. The browned butter and toasted poppy seeds add a really lovely flavor. I followed the recipe pretty closely this time, but in the future will probably use a little less butter. Not too difficult to make and not too expensive either!

I loved this - but as always I did increase the amounts of beet, poppy seeds and goat's cheese - the flavours are beautiful and understated - but definitely add more cheese to cut through the sweet and richness of the dish

I made this because we had friends coming for dinner and wanted a vegetarian option along with the carbonara we made. I chose this because it seemed so interesting and wasn't too creamy. Made exactly as directed; everyone LOVED it! Plus, it just looks so cool. Just make sure you have enough goat cheese and people tend to love that stuff :)

I really wanted to love this recipe, but it was just wasn't up to much. For the amount of butter used, it just didn't taste rich enough, and I added close to 2x the salt, but it was still bland. Also, I LOVE beets and they didn't really shine in this recipe. I might use them in the future to color pasta, though, just because hot pink pasta is sexy.

Reallyreally good. I think I used too few beets (two instead of three - Whole Foods sells them with the greens still on and it makes weighing difficult) and next time will use three to get the full garnet effect. I also think that loosening up the goat cheese a bit with a whisk and a little milk would make shaping a little easier. Otherwise, delicious! Go beets!

A wonderful, simple, inexpensive dish. Great comfort food. Only thing I'd suggest is maybe increasing the amount of goat's cheese slightly (but not much), and maybe adding some more seasoning--rosemary, perhaps? It really is lovely as it is though.

I agree with all the other reviewers about the great mix of flavors. I would also add that this is really easy to make. It's not terribly filling though, so I would make it as a light lunch or serve it as a first course.

This was truly a wonderful dish. Great flavor, visually stunning. I would absolutely make it again, and would even serve it to company. Next time, I will make a few changes. First, I will put foil in my baking dish because it was a pain to clean. Second, I will cover the dish with foil while roasting the beets, also to ease the clean-up because the oil and water splashed everywhere. Third, I will use half as much oil for roasting the beets. And finally, I might try it with a little less butter to cut out some of the saturated fat. But only a little less, because the flavor of the dish is heavily dependent on the butter. Overall, an excellent dish.

We really enjoyed this dish, made using whole wheat pasta and subbing in feta for the goat cheese. It was beautiful and unusual visually; the flavor combination was earthy and nutty yet surprisingly bright. I've found myself craving it since - a good find!

This is simple and delicious. It was a good main course, but I think it would make a better first course as part of an italian 4-course meal.

Nice sweetness from the beets and poppy seeds goes well with the tanginess of the goat cheese. Would make again.
