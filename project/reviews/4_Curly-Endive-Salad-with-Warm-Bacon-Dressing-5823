Phenomenal. Everyone raved and went back for seconds and started scheming how we could work this into every meal ever. Yummmmmm...

I found that the amount of dressing was perfect for 2 heads of endive. Really easy recipe and I will try it with some other greens as well. I added a touch of red pepper flakes.

Delicious! I used spinach and curly red lettuce from my garden. I used less bacon so it was really low fat. I added southwest dried peppers for a kick.

This dressing recipe is so simple and so absolutley delish. Used it with spinach, but added shallots to the bacon drippings and quickly sauteed those and then add the remaining ingredients. Oh, the spinach was sooo happy!

I'm shocked at how blah this salad was. Watery and not tasty.

We don't eat meat, so we substituted an antibiotic-free, hormone-free turkey bacon. doesn't create as much fat, of course, but delicious nonetheless. We've made it with escarole, radiccio, and endive - liked it by far the best with the escarole. Love this salad - could easily make it my whole meal.

My husband and I always grill a couple of bone-in chicken breasts on the weekend for use during the week and I am always looking for something different to do with them. Boy, is this a winning way! I too used fresh spinach and baby red lettuces instead of the curly endive. Added my shredded grilled chicken, chopped tomato, chopped avocado, and sliced red onion. Super dressing!! You can get as creative as you want, I think, with how you use this dressing.

After eating a fabulous warm bacon dressing at a restaurant the other night, I was on a mission to find one to make at home. I was so pleased that I found this recipe. In fact, instead of eating the main course of the dinner I'd prepared, I opted for a second helping of the salad! This was an incredible dressing and I cannot wait to make it for friends and family at my next dinner party.

I made this last night. I did saute the garlic and shallots as well. I cooked it too high initially instead of simmering so it got very thick quick. I ended up just adding more broth and it turned out fine. I topped it off with crumbled blue cheese, candied pecans and bacon. I also used Spinach instead. This was a big hit with us and it is farely low in fat. I would definitely make this again and would be a must at my next dinner party.

A little sweet for our taste but definitely the best bacon dressing we've come across in a long while, maybe ever. We served over spring greens topped with chopped green onion and sliced pecan-crusted chicken breast "planned overs".

Love this dressing! A couple of small changes I liked: I removed the bacon from the pan to cool on a paper towel, and then added a couple of tablespoons of diced shallots and a minced clove of garlic to the pan to saute before I added the egg mixture. Mmmm yummy! Good with spinich salad too (but be careful to not add too much dressing since the spinach will wilt quickly)

This salad was a great hit for a family get together. I had four family members ask for the receipe. I used the curly endive but also added a couple handfuls of a mix of baby greens for more color and different textures.
