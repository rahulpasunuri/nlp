I add my kudos for this excellent and simple recipe. I made it exactly as written, except used only half the serrano pepper. Served it our bookclub; enthusiasticaly eaten by everyone.

I just eyeballed the measurements and used sriracha hot chili sauce instead of chopping chilis and garlic. I also added some diced red onion. Wow! This is the tastiest slaw dressing I have ever tried. This will be in the permanent rotation. Can't wait to take it to the next fish fry at the lake!

I love this coleslaw! I could eat it everyday!

It was good. I think the dish wasn't really up to its full potential, as the fresh dill I purchased was well, not so fresh and lacked flavour. I didn't like the crunchy texture of the celery seed, but I liked the celery taste. If I make this again, I will probably just grate some fresh celery into it. I added a bit of sweet chili sauce, as it was a bit too acidic and bitter for my tastes as written.

I'm not a huge coleslaw person. In fact, I only like my aunts recipe in New Jersey and she won't share it. This is awesome!!! I love the little kick from the serrano chilies. I think that the lime juice, oil, and apple cider vinegar does a wonderful job of thinning out the mayo in the dressing. I'm not sure that I will want to share this! Delicious!!!

Fairly easy to make and delivers a tangy and lightly spicy flavor that was enjoyed by everyone, even my wife who doesn't like cole slow typically.

amazing. the best coleslaw salad i've had so far. creamy yet sweet and spicy.

Just as described. Cool and hot at the same time. I only used 1 pepper for my tastes. I doubled the dressing mixture and used one and one half bags of prepackaged cole slaw mix.

I guess I prefer creamy coleslaw. This was good with the Jamaican Jerk Chicken, but it really tastes of lime -- too much, I think.

Cool and Spicy! I used one bag of Angel Hair Coleslaw and only 1 cup of shredded carrots.

This is our favorite cole slaw! I can not imagine how any of the previous reviewers could find this "bland". Maybe they need to taste/season the dressing before mixing with the vegetables. My family loves this, and it's the only slaw they'll accept. Don't hesitate, make it!

This was the best coleslaw I have had. Add a bit more lime juice.

This is definitely a winner. Great flavour even using red pepper flakes. Leftovers don't go bitter as with some creamy type dressings.

A subtle twist - improvement! - on cole slaw. Fresh dill is the dominating flavor & delicious. Couldn't find serrano chilies so I used jalapenos; they got lost in the flavor, so I'd be sure to go with a hotter pepper. Makes a great side with BBQ.

Followed the recipe but doubled the dressing. Brought it to a Caribbean themed party and it was a hit. I brought copies of the recipe to give to people. When very well with spicy Jerk Chicken.

This is great and a little different. Used a jalapeno that wasn't too hot.

Refreshing and different taste; will certainly make again.

I disliked the olive oil in the recipe. If I were to make it again, which I doubt, I would use all mayo, or mayo and a neutral oil. I would also omit the celery seed. Yuck. Just so-so recipe, has some merit, but requires a lot of "tweeking".

This was very good, and definately a memorable coleslaw. I did add more pepper (I added one extra serrano, next time I'll add two) and more dressing to make it damp enough. A keeper.

The usual coleslaw, I'm not a fan of, but this Haitian version is a definite A+! The tanginess of the lime and vinegar with the spice of the serrano pepper(I added more) and the sweetness of the sugar(added more as well) makes a medley in your mouth. I coupled it with a store-bought Cajun Turkey sausage and some easy red beans and rice and had a great Saturday dinner.

I thought this recipe was excellent--and so did all my guests. I used more mayo, vinegar and sugar than called for, and that really seemed to draw out the flavors. This is now my go-to recipe.

Love this recipe. Have made this several times and rank it as one of my favorite cole slaws.

What did I miss on this one? This recipe is anything but memorable. Just another coleslaw. Blah. Don't waste your time.

I made this just before serving, and couldn't believe how well the combination of flavors - practically every condiment in my regrigerator - came together. At first taste, a very complex sweet/sour, at last, a pleasant surprise kick of heat. I would make only the dressing in advance; the slaw gives off liquid and the color bleeds over time. Using prepared cabbage/carrot blend cuts down on prep time.

RAVE reviews on this dish both in my supper club group and a recent dinner for 10. Will keep this recipe close at hand. Even non-coleslaw people love it! I've found that if I make the dressing the night before using 2 unseeded peppers, the dish has a bit more punch. If no time, I use 3 unseeded peppers for the kick!

This was very good. It's a nice full-flavored coleslaw. I'll make it again if I need coleslaw, but I didn't think it was anything to rave about.

I made this for a Carribean feast. My family loved it - the chilies really make the slaw sing! I couldn't find serrano chilis, however, so I used a half of a jalapeno. Which was fine at first, but oddly enough, it lost it's heat. (I had made it 6 hours before our dinner). I ended up adding a few tablespoons of Louisiana Hot Sauce to the dish to kick it up a notch. Next time I willnot be so timid and use more hot pepper!!

This coleslaw is amazing and the dressing is addictive! All other coleslaws now taste too mayonnaisey and bland. I make up a batch on the weekends and it lasts me all week as a lunch side dish. I have not found it to get soggy even after 4-5 days. I think it gets better with age and all the flavors blend together. 2 time-saving tips - 1) substitute a bag of coleslaw or brocolli coleslaw mix instead of chopping up carrots/cabbage. I also add julienned red peppers to add some more color. 2) Use a jar to mix all the dressing ingredients together - I just add them all at once, close the lid and shake away. Much faster than whisking.

I really enjoyed this cole slaw. It was simple and didn't require the purchase of a lot of ingredients. For cooks looking to cut back on cost, like I did, I used rice wine vinegar (the only one I had) instead of buying more, and it was okay. I also omitted the celery seeds; I don't have them. I substituted the dill for chopped dill pickles....Herbs are expensive here and I don't have garden...I did buy the dijon mustard...off brand tastes the same.

Wonderful dish. I made it for a bbq and everyone enjoyed it. I used 2 1/2 serrano peppers and it still only had a slight bite to it, but it was perfect for all palates, not too hot. The lime juice is the key to this refreshing, not-too-creamy coleslaw. I'd definitely make it again.

Best coleslaw I ever had! The flavor of sweet and spicy made the dish. I'm considering using the dressing for salads in the future, cutting back on the mayo to have more of a vinigarette dressing.

What a delightful change from the ordinary coleslaw. We had this with bbq ribs and Anadama bread. Delicious!

Enjoyable and quick if you use pre-shredded carrots and cabbage, as we did. Add salt. I wonder, if I let the flavors meld (so the slaw gets hotter), will it get soggy?

Rating: 4
Quite good! The best cole slaw I have ever had, in fact. Probably the reason more people have not commented on this recipe is because its title has "coleslaw" as one word so if a user types in "cole slaw," it doesn't come up. Epicurious.com should hire a copyeditor or two.

This coleslaw is AMAZING... If you are not of fan of all things hot (as I am) you can leave out the serrano chiles and sub. w/ mild green ones, or none at all. Either way, try this on a hot day. It is the best!

This is a good recipe because the dressing is slightly different. The lime juice and the serranos make the dish. FYI, you need much more than 2 large carrots to get 2 cups of grated carrot. Also, I recommend using less olive oil. The dressing is "oily" enough without the full amount. Finally, incorporate the dressing with the cabbage mixture slowly: 2/3 of it will coat the cabbage more than adequately.
