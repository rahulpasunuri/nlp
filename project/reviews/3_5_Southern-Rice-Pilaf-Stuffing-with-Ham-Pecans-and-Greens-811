I ,too, sub'd spinach for collard greens. I also used basmati rice, because I love how fragrant it is. It was a good recipe for stuffing and different than our normal-- which uses apricots and dried cherries. A great change! Definitely one to keep in the rotation.

I brought this issue of Bon Appetit with me to visit a friend in Alabama for American Thanksgiving in 1996. She and I decided to make this stuffing, but neither of us like collard greens, so we substituted spinach. I started making this for our Christmas stuffing and it's a hit with my family. It will be on our table for the 6th straight year this year (2001)!
