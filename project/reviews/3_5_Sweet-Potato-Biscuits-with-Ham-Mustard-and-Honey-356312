My kids love these. I make them with a 1.5 inch biscuit cutter.

I make this for our Christmas morning breakfast buffet every year. Fruit salad, individual sour cream coffee cakes, hot coffee and of course mimosas round out the meal. It is just the right combination to keep everyone tided over until Christmas dinner.

The 4 forks is for the biscuit recipe which is divine. I added a half a jigger of bourbon to the biscuits to make them diviner. I ladled sausage gravy over the ham stuffed biscuits to make them divinest. Wowee this is good!

The sweet potato biscuits were best the day they were made, so I wouldn't recommend making them too much in advance (or perhaps just warming the biscuits before serving). Also, we used the honeycup mustard instead of the dijon-honey combo in the recipe, and I wouldn't do that again - it was a strange flavour, and wasn't that pleasant with the ham and biscuit.

I had never had sweet potato biscuits before and wanted to give them a try - I am now a big fan! I used a leftover baked sweet potato, and it was more than 3/4 cup mashed. The dough was a bit sticky, so I just sliced square-ish biscuits out of the dough (16 small biscuits).

I think the recipe calls for 1, 3/4-pound yam, not 1 and 3/4 pound yam. However, I found that the water from the cooking process made the dough impossibly sticky for using a biscuit cutter. Also, how do 25 bicuits fit in one 9" cake pan? I gave up on cutting biscuits and used 2 pans and dropped the spoonfuls of dough into 2 pans. The resulting biscuits were more like cookies and only 1/2 inch high. The flavor was good however. My modifications should I try this again: bake or microwave the yam (whole) to minimize water absorption. Mash the yam after cooking and continue the recipe.

Awesome!! Great for leftover ham. We did a gluten-free version by using Bob's Red Mill all purpose baking flour. The recipe calls for 1 3/4 pound of sweet potato but that yeilds way more than the 3/4 cup mashed sweet potato that it calls for later. We would recommend using just one large sweet potato.

This is tasty and I definitely will make it again, but there are a few things you should know about it. First, unless you are making teeny tiny biscuits, this dough will probably only yield 12-15 at the most and that's if you use all the scraps up. Second, you only need one sweet potato of slightly less than a pound to generate the 3/4 cup needed for the recipe. Also, I would bake these at no higher than 400 degrees. Mine were golden at 400 after about 17 or 18 minutes.

Followed exactly and tasted pretty good, I love the presentation. Excellent with honey and mustard. Tried with both cured and luncheon meat ham, and actually liked the less expensive luncheon meat better. Tender biscuits, a good go-to appetizer recipe.

At first, being that I don't usually take on biscuits (I try- TRY- to eat healthily), I thought I was ruining this recipe as I went along. However, I stuck to the directions (aside from making larger biscuits) and I was ultimately pleased with the results. These biscuits ring forth echos of my youth, at grandma's. We'd always take the plain kind she'd made home for the honey ham after the holidays, but these sweet potato biscuits are the most mellow and pleasant accompaniment for the stone-ground mustard I chose. I would thoroughly suggest this to those who have ham, autumn party guests, or both.

Delcious! I made these for Thanksgiving and they were great. The sweet potato made them really tender. Good on their own, perfect warm with a little honey and butter. These will be made agian.

Delicious, everyone gobbled these up. I purchased a Honey Baked Ham and used that then used Dijon Mustard and served with honey. The biscuits are to die for. So tender.
