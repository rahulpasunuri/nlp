No forks from me---it burned in 30 minutes and is ineatable! Are you sure the 425 is correct? This is the first time a recipe on this site has failed.

We are allergic to milk/butter so I make this without the crust, and use olive oil instead of butter in the topping, and we LOVE it. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert during cherry season! By the way, tapioca is only ok as a thickener-- cornstarch is much better. It makes a smooth, velvety sauce without starchiness or undesirable gelling.

Can't beat it for simplicity and taste.

i have never made a pie from scratch before so i thought it would be good to start with one where i only had to worry about one crust. this was delicious! i used sour cherries from the farmers market, didnt transfer all the juices, and it was perfect! there was a bit extra topping left over, not too much though. i would definitely recommend this recipe - with a side of vanilla ice cream of course!

Wonderful. I didn't think the topping was too much. I used frozen cherries and covered the pie after the initial 30 min. Next time I will try without sugar as other reviews have suggested and try a little more tapioca as I think the pie was a little bit runny (perhaps because of the frozen cherries). Overall excellent.

As the others suggest the topping would be too much. Used half portions of the dry ingredients for the topping, covered the topping during the first 30 minutes of baking with foil. Pie has a nice golden crumb topping perfect with the cherries and was a huge hit.

I have made this twice so far one with the crumble and one with pastry top from doubling the recipe. The pastry top is much better. There is to much crumble and it almost burnt before the pie was done. Added 3 Tbsp of tapioca because I was too lazy to find my 1/2 Tbsp and a dash more of the kirch it was great! The crumble overwelmed the flavors of the cherries and after all that pitting.... making more pies to freeze this week.

All-around good pie. Used frozen cherries and would suggest decreasing the cup of sugar as the pie was a bit too sweet. Substituted almond extract for the kirsch. Gee, no almonds on hand so in when the ground hazelnuts! A keeper.

The cooking time is wrong - the top gets way too brown before the final 30 minutes. There was too much topping and too much oat in the topping for our taste - sort of like having a very thick and overbaked oatmeal cookie baked on top. I'll try a different crumble topping next time we want a cherry pie. Of course the fresh cherries make the pie wonderful - a far cry from the nasty canned cherry pie filling from the grocery store. This was an enormously time consuming pie to make with pitting the fresh cherries, but it tastes pretty good. Perhaps using frozen would give a decent result - probably a bit juicier.

This pie recipe is now a tradition for me to make for all the Holidays! Everyone absolutely loved it. It seemed difficult the first time, but now is a piece of pie! Myself any family's give this pie 4 forks!

A waste of ingredients.. Filling never cooked up, crust and topping were almost burned BEFORE first 30 minutes.. Would never make again...

This makes one outstanding cherry pie!! the only change i had to make was that i only had a large non-stick skillet to work with and when i heated up the cherries they didnt give off much of their juice (i think because of the non-stick) so I added the juice of one lemon to make the sauce with. it worked very well. I also used the presscribed amount of vanilla and i was very happy. Also, the crust is excellent!!! I liked teh dough so much i made a solid top instead of lattice - why waste it? it was FABULOUS!!

There may be something wrong with either the recommended temperature or cooking time. At 30 min., both the crust and the topping looked REALLY brown, almost burned. Covered the whole pie with foil to finish baking. Didn't taste burned, but didn't look too appetizing.

Too much trouble for a dessert that is so not worth that much trouble.

I doubled the amount of crust, and it came out a little thicker-which I really like. I used frozen sweet cherries, and added 1/2 extra tbls tapioca to make up for the extra juice. I added zero sugar, based on other reviews here about the pie being too sweet. The result was perfect, it was sweet, but just right, not like candy. The topping was awesome. It made the entire pie. My trick was to rub in the butter until it not only resembled coarse meal, but made one moist clump. I then took handfuls of it, pressed it out thin and flat, and loosely pieced them together on top of the cherries. About halfway through cooking, the edges of the crust began to brown, so i covered the edges with foil. The result was a perfect cherry pie with a crunchy granola-like topping. I made this as a surprise for my sister-in-law on Thanksgiving,it's her favorite. She really liked it, everyone did. Oh, one more thing, I didn't use a processor, I did it all by hand. It sounds harder, but it's actually easier, and it works so much better. Make sure to roll out the dough between pieces of saran wrap. I also left out the cinnaman.

I used tart cherries, also do not like tapioca so I used corn starch insted - approx 6 Tbspns. I cooked the cherry mixture in a saucepan over medium heat until thickened - then you don't have to worry about it not thickening during baking.

It was too sweet for me. I would use tart cherries or cut the sugar.

Excellent recipe. I used Oregon brand pie cherries and kept them tart by cutting back on the sugar they recommended for the filling. A friend recommended adding a bit of red wine to the filling but I'll try that next time. The sweet topping balanced the sour cherries beautifully. A nice twist on classic cherry pie.

I used frozen sweet cherries in this recipe, but to compensate for the extra juice, I added 3 T of tapioca instead of 2.5. I also reserved about 3/4 of a cup of topping for other use and covered the pie with foil before starting the baking process. The pie thickened beautifully, and taking the foil off about 10 minutes before the pie was done resulted in a lovely browned crust and topping. Tons of compliments about it at Thanksgiving dinner.

This Cherry Crumble seemed very dry due to too much crumble! The top layer burned quickly too but I was fortunately able to spoon off without ruining entire dessert. I'd make again but reduce amount of crumble part.

Very Good! Made it for a dinner party with fresh sweet cherries, everyone enjoyed it. I did have to cover the top becaused it browned too much, also pie did not set so it was more like a crustless cherry crumble but still very tasty.

Great President's Day dessert! My 12 year old helped and it was a great success. We used a 1 1/2 lb bag of frozen sour pie cherries - I can't imagine it with sweet but will give it a try this summer when they are in season. The topping perfectly balanced the tartness of the filling and I didn't adjust the sugar in the filling. I did have to cover it with foil at the point when the oven temp was to be decreased to prevent the topping from burning - so keep an eye on it even if you're oven temp is very accurate. Filling is especially good as there is no precooking step to over cook the cherries

this was terrific! i took it to a party, and everyone loved it. the only thing that took a long time was pitting the cherries...i will try the paper clip trick the next time.

Excellent on so many levels. Even though I cheated and used a store bought crust and frozen cherries because I decided to make this pie at the very last minute for a dinner that very night. I didn't feel like I missed out on anything; it was that good. I put in a little extra brandy to the cherries to add some flavor, and didn't put in all of the juice that resulted from using frozen cherries. Both good moves, in my opinion. Everyone LOVED the pie, even my father who is not a huge dessert fan. Loved the topping, loved the fruit!

I thought this was good. Because I was in a hurry I cheated and used frozen sweet cherries. I got some compliments. The crust was very good but I think because my kitchen was so hot it was a little tricky rolling it out. Would definitely make again.

NOBODY said mmmm about this! I would make this again, but only with SERIOUS modifications to the topping. The recipe created a dry, floury topping which burnt in the oven (yes, my oven temp gets checked every week, it isn't running hot!). I would substitute the topping I put on apple crisp (1/2 c. each of flour, oats, golden sugar, 1/3 c. of butter cut in, and WAY LESS CINNAMON!! The cinnamon and cherries do not go together!! YUCK). The crust is ok, the cherries themselves are nice, but that topping has got to go! Its crap! Fortunately it is fairly easy to scrape off, so I didn't completely waste 6 cups of cherries on this thing. It will probably be a year until I see that many fresh cherries again anyway, so it isn't like I would be making this pie right away. I would rather have had a cherry cobbler or crisp for what I ended up with.

To the cook from Grand Rapids ....I wish I could claim credit for this nifty trick ! I originally read it in Elizabeth Alston's 'Tea Breads & Coffeecakes' (great recipe book, too) & it goes as follows :- Get a large paper clip. Lift the inner curve of metal & bend it back so the clip is an elongated S. Bend the larger end slightly inward so it forms a teardrop shape. Hold the paper clip by the narrow end. Insert the wider end (the teardrop) through the stem hole & under the pit. Pull out the clip & it will bring both pit and stem with it. Takes no longer than 5 minutes to pit a pound of cherries . Believe me, its easier to do than it sounds !

To the Cook from Essex: I'm really intrigued by your paper clip pitting method and will hold up on trying this recipe in the hopes that you'll share the technique and make the job easier.

Anyone made this with sour cherries yet? I just bought a ton, and would love to do something delicuous with them. Thanks for the feedback.

Making this pie was a comedy of errors. My crust tore as I was rolling it out, so I had to gather up the whole thing and redo it. Due to a minor domestic emergency, I let the cherry mixture sit for over 4 hours instead of 1, resulting in a lot more juice than desired. When I put the crumble topping over the cherries, I realized half-way through that I forgot to add the butter. So I had to spoon out as much of the oat mixture as possible in order to make the crumble correctly. BUT...in spite of my many mistakes, the pie came out tasting incredible. The cherries were sweet and plump, the crust amazingly flaky and, oh that topping! Yum!! I can't wait to make it again when I'm a little more prepared!

Excellent Pie !!! I've made it twice in the last two weeks. Easy once you get the cherries pitted and totally worth the effort.

It was very easy to make after the cherry pitting (talk about messy!) This was my first "fresh" cherry pie and I was pleased with the results. The topping and crust were great - I'm going to try them with fresh blueberries next (no pitting needed).

The crust was one of the flakiest crusts I've ever tasted, and the topping was wonderful. I made the mistake of using frozen cherries, rather than fresh, and the filling had a real commercial taste to it. I probably would have given this recipe an extra fork if I used fresh.

What a terrific pie-guests raved about it! They especially loved the topping. It was crunchy and as one reviewer said, it reminded me of granola. Definitely worth the effort of pitting the cherries!

This was an incredibly easy pie to bake AFTER the cherries were pitted (be sure to wear a dark colored shirt while you're pitting!) The taste was well worth the effort. I especially liked the topping- it kind of tasted like a granola bar... the good kind.

The only way to describe this pies is WOW!!! What great flavor and texture, and I only had a bite of someones! I made this twice on Memorial Day weekend and everyone said it was the best they ever had! I served it warm with Haagen Daz Vanilla. Cherry's don't take too long to pit, worth EVERY effort!!!
