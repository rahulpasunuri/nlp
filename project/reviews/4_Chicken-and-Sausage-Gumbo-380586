Four forks. This dish was a hit with this year's Superbowl party with a New Orleans theme. I am curious that the recipe does not call for cutting the thighs into pieces which I did anyway. This will be a regular from now on.

Amazing! The flavors are great. I added carrots and substituted green beans for okra. Delicious. I also added a little bit of creole seasoning at the end to spice it up a bit. This is a great recipe if you are in the mood for delicious comfort food with a little kick!

Really tasty and a great intro gumbo for new cooks and whoever you are serving it to. I used smoked paprika instead of normal paprika and it worked really well. The smokiness was strong at first but them mellowed out nicely and added a great flavor.

This is absolutely delicious. Mellow flavors that meld well together. I used olive oil and less of it. Didn't miss it at all. We had left over andouille and chicken from a barbecue over the weekend so it was a no-brainer. Also subbed red for green peppers and pulsed onions, peppers and celery in the food processor and added to the roux - didn't see where it said to add the latter two in the recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly and this was a hit! Wonderful flavor without being too spicy....... I will address the person who stirred for over an hour and still didn't have a brown roux....perhaps you might use a pot or skillet that is NOT non stick..you need all those little gummy bits that stick to the bottom of the pan for a decent roux and more flavor.

Madie it for the first time today and it's delicious. BUT, the recipe seems to indicate that the thighs are left whole which is not a good idea. I cut the chicken into a med dice after searing and added the chicken and sausage as described. My son, a NOLA resident and cook says not to leave them whole

Wow! So, so good. I would do 3.5 forks, because the roux would not brown; after 1 hour and ten minutes, when I was almost at milk chocolate, I moved forward with the recipe. This may have been due to the fact that I used a pan too large for my burner, also some friends suggested I use butter instead of the canola oil I used. So delicious! The thighs were moist and the flavor was exceptional. Seemed pretty authentic if I remember my trip to New Orleans well enough!

So, let me just jump in here. Roux, Okra, and File are all flavor AND thickening agents. Gumbo does NOT mean 'Okra'. Where did THAT come from? Let's just settle down and think about cooking, folks. This ain't an argument. It's a recipe. For my part, it's a nice recipe for people who don't know how to start a gumbo. Well thought out. And pretty good. Chicken and sausage? Sure. I'd put a little Loozee hot sausage in it, but the right andouille works for folks. Otherwise, I can't disagree with this recipe at all. I wouldn't get up and walk away from the table. Unless someone started arguing about the whether it is authentic or not.

Gumbo does not have to have okra to be authentic. I was born and raised in south Louisiana and there are many variations on gumbo - many without okra. I do agree that either okra or file is used and not together. I do, however, always use a roux whether I'm making an okra or file gumbo. This is a decent recipe. I would omit the bell pepper because it is so strong, but many gumbo recipes call for it.

Recipe not too bad. BUT, okra OR roux and file'. When roux is dark brown add vegetables, stir until transparent. Then add meat to the roux and stir several minutes to sear. No need to brown meat separately. Then add stock slowly and stir. Liquids will blend as it simmers. Add file' to BOWL after serving gumbo. Adding to the pot will make it stringy because of the heat. If you are going to do a Cajun okra gumbo, do not do a roux. Slowly brown the sliced okra instead and proceed as with a roux. Browning the okra gets rid of the slimy texture. Cajun okra gumbo does not have tomatoes, but New Orleans Creole gumbo does. I am a cajun who grew up in New Orleans and learned from my ancesters. Trust me.

The word, 'gumbo" means okra. Any recipe for gumbo that does not include okra is not authentic!

I agree that if you use okra and file` powder you are over thickening. Use one or the other. Also your roux needs to be a very dark brown. Add your onions in first and this carmelizes the onion sugars, then add the rest of the 'trinity'. Make sure your broth is cool when adding it to a hot roux. To prevent slimy okra, saute the okra in a bit of oil until the slickness is gone then add it to the gumbo. Add the dark green parts of the onions the last 10 minutes along with flat-leaf parsley. Taste throughout the cooking process for seasoning.

This is a great recipe for gumbo, I made it for New Year's day and all of my guests loved it so I made it for a Mardi Gras party this weekend and it once again was a huge success

Normally, there's three methods of thickening a gumbo - roux, okra, *or* filé powder (sassafras leaves). Using all three as suggested is likely to result in a gummy mess. Also, the roux should be cooked until almost black (not burned) before adding the vegetables.

I made this without the file powder (because I have no idea what that is) and without okra because I hate okra. It took me about four hours in total to cook. I love that it all goes in one pot- no cleaning the entire pot cabinet when you're done! I also loved how to chicken tasted. It was so tender. I wasn't a huge fan of the sausage because I thought it overpowered the rest, but my boyfriend liked the sausage and not the chicken, so we make a great team! In all, this was a very good dish. I just don't think it was worth four hours of non-stop cooking. It might be something I try to adapt to a slow cooker recipe in the future.

I made this for New Year's Day and it was delicious. I used 2/3 chicken breasts and 1/3 chicken thighs. We served like a soup with no rice. Be sure to skim as much fat off as you can as it says in the recipe.
