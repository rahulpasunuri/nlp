Both my husband and I found this very disappointing. We both felt the cranberry (homemade relish) overpowered the salmon. The sweet and tart combination sounded like a winner- but didn't materialize. I won't be making this again, but I'm glad I gave it a shot. Cooking is trying new things and finding out what works for your taste buds.

Made this with leftover cranberry chutney from Thanksgiving. Paired with simple steamed swiss chard and Belgian-style beer. Only change: sprinkled pomegranate seeds on top! Adds a great look and a bit more tang, plus some crunch. Yum.

I actually found this recipe to be somewhat bland compared to other options. There are so many things to do with salmon that I wouldn't recommend this one for a special meal. An "okay" dish but not a memorable one.

This is delicious. I used "Honey-&-Spice Cranberry Sauce" (from this site). I heaped the cranberry mixture on top of the mustard prior to cooking. The shallots mellowed as they cooked. The result was a moist fish with vibrant flavors and brilliant aroma. I paired with Roasted Potatoes with Garlic, Lemon & Oregano," (also from this site.) I cooked pot's as directed except did last 15 minutes on 450F with the fish.

This was good, but I think the sauce tasted better the longer it sat atop the salmon and warmed up. In the future, I might put the sauce on top before broiling.

For years I never ate salmon (chalk it up to a bed restaurant experience). I wanted to give it another shot & tried this recipe. VERY good & easy. My husband, 18mo old & I all loved it. The only thing I would change is slightly decreasing the shallots, as when I put in the 2tbs it seemed overpowering. I added a little more cranberry sauce & mustard & it was better.

This was a great use up for my cranberry sauce. I made the sauce as directed by the recipe but since we have been eating cranberry sauce for a while now I decided to give a twist with some cilantro and red chile flakes. This was perfect. I will definatly make this again next year when I have left over cranberry sauce.

I didn't read the recipe correctly and actually broiled a coating of the cranberry on the salmon. It worked well, actually. I was worried that the bright flavors of cranberry and vinegar would overwhelm the salmon, but it was fabulous. We gobbled it all up!

Sorry, but what is "raw" cranberry relish???

Wow this is really phenominal, and easy!! Believe the reviews. Only change I made was I used only 2 tbsp oil and cranberry jelly.

Outstanding dish. Great tip to roast on foiled sheet and throw the skin and foil out at the end. I used cranberry chutney and it made a nice sauce.

I love this recipe and have served this dish many times over. So easy to prepare yet makes a great impression. To aid in the serving and clean-up process, I cover a cookie sheet with foil (I don't grease it) and place the fish skin side down. When the fish is finished roasting and by using a spatula, I can easily separate the fish from the skin because the skin sticks to the foil. Foil goes in the garbage and there is no greasy pan to wash. I often serve this salmon with a wild rice & raisin dish and green beans. Excellent!

+So awesome! This has become one of our week night regular recipes. Even my husband who is not a fish eater requests this. I have never used cranberry relish, just pulse some fresh cranberries with a pinch of sugar in a food processer and it comes out great. Match it with a sweet potato and some broccoli and you have a fabulous meal high in antioxidants!!

Excellent and a quickly prepared dish. Substitute lingonberry jam for a little twist.

I made this dish with leftover homemade cranberry sauce. I did broil the fish for 10minutes rather than roast, then finished off with the cranberry mixture to broil another 3-5 minutes. It was delicious. I will be making this again soon.

amazing and simple and full of flavor...

Loved it, but had no cranberry-anything in the house. Used just a bit of seedless blackberry jam, nice fresh shallots and excellent quality vinegar and it passed the test. Bottom line: If you avoid overcooking the fish (which I am fanatical about), it will be wonderful.

It was quick and easy to prepare and delicious. We like how the flavor of the cranberry compliments that of the salmon. Perfect dish to serve when entertaining.

I had a jar of cranberry chutney on hand and used that instead of cranberry sauce. Very nice presentation overall for company. I served it with smashed potatoes and asparagus.

Awesome- flavorful, fast, and easy. I'd even cut down on the olive oil to make it lighter. This is an easy, impressive dish for company!

This is the third time I have made this dish in as many months. We love it. I have roasted potatoes with it each time and just put the fish on a piece of foil so I can easily place the fish in the same pan with the potatoes and remove to broil.

I used Ocean Spray's "Cran-Raspberry Fruit for Chicken" which comes in small plastic containers (in the canned fruit aisle). It looks beautiful and has a wonderful spicy, sweet taste.

A wonderful recipe. It is easy to make and a real crowd pleaser. Even the family members who don't usually like fish loved this recipe.

A winner! To make clean-up easier I lined the baking sheet with foil. I didn't oil it, so when the skin stuck to the foil I just removed the filets without the skin. Great flavors, good depth. I'd make again in a heartbeat!

This turned out really, really well. Person I was making it for was hesitant about the idea of cranberries with salmon, but the flavors of the mustard, cranberry, and salmon combine quite well. Next time I'll cut down a little on the oil when creating the mustard glaze for salmon. A really tasty recipe. (I too used whole cranberry sauce)

I tried this recipe with cranberry chutney instead of relish, and served it over fresh Steelhead fillets. It is so easy and tastes delicious. I agree that the sauce would go well with poultry or pork! Hmmm... somehow I could almost see putting it on my cereal too...

It Is wonderful!! I cheated--I also tried it on boneless, skinless chicken breasts, and on a pork tenderloin roast. (I like the combination of cranberry and mustard--I'd put it on breakfast cereal, if I could get away with it)

WOW. amazing taste treat. the salmon was perfect, and the sauce a terrific complement. i had no cranberry relish, so used cranberry chutney which is probably slightly less sweet than the other, and it was terrific. will definitely do again, and i'm going out for more cranberry chutney.

Fantastic recipie - good contrast between the mustard and the vinegar, and an ideal way of using up cranberry left after Christmas. I imagine it's also very nice with poultry.

Made this recipe for my family and friends. Everyone including myself enjoyed the flavor. It was very easy and will definitely make it again.

Very easy and very good. Substituting whole cranberry sauce works well if you can't find relish. Don't over cook the sauce. Excellent with mashed sweet potatoes.

I made this with the Cranberry Sauce with Port and Dried Figs. Outrageously good and quick to make if the cranberry sauce is to hand.

I thought this was a nice recipe for a quick meal. It was very quick to prepare and I liked the contrast of the tart mustard with the sweet taste of the cranberry. I used a half can of whole berry cranberry sauce instead of relish, which was fine and added a nice appearance with the whole berries.

ummm, I don't know if I did something wrong, but the sauce was way too shallot-y, and faintly reminded me of ketchup. The salmon was fine without it.

Great for a casual dinner at home. You can substitue about 1/2 can of whole cranberry sauce. Also try it with Pork.
