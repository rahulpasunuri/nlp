okay, so add sausage, garlic, more olive oil, cherry tomatoes,herbs. Bake or steam, NOT microwave!! In other words, YOU are being creative and innovative with spaghetti squash. I made it as written as a side to roast chicken, and this recipe is bland. I'll delete this from my box

Plastic wrap is unnecessary. Just throw the whole squash into the microwave and nuke for 10 min. Cool, break open, and scoop out the seeds. If it needs more cooking, put the 2 halves in a bowl and continue nuking. If you've got too much squash for the recipe, freeze the rest. And, BTW, this is an excellent method for pre-treating any other type of hard squash so that you can extract the seeds without the use of a hatchet or chisel.

WOW - I have hated spaghetti squash for 40 years so when it showed up in my weekly veggie box I gladly threw it n the microwave in a plastic micro bag that I got as a sample. THIS WAS GREAT! Okay, I used more olive oil but I liked it!! The thought of this squash usually makes me gag - but I had 3rds :D

I followed the recipe as is and it was a little bland. I would add more seasoning (like garlic) next time and maybe some green peas and sun dried tomatoes for color. It has potential. I would make it again with some adjustments.

On the fence with this: baked squash and sauteed mushrooms on stove. was delish HOWEVER after eating it I was extremely bloated and gasey. Even the next day when I had leftovers I was bloated and gasey again. Has any one experienced this?

In my opinion microwave cooking is an oxymoron. That said, I like the ingredients so I prepared this the traditional way--with a stove and oven! It worked really well, just time consuming because of the roasting. I roasted the squash for an hour on 375 and sauteed the mushrooms (doubled the amount because I like them) with onions on the stove top. then tossed the spaghetti strings with them and a little olive oil to saute the squash a bit. At the end, I removed from the heat and tossed in the parsley and scallions (no chives) per the recipe. I then added pine nuts, whole grape tomatoes and pieces of Italian sausage per other reviewers suggestions. Other than changing the cooking method (which I feel only adds to the flavor) and adding in a few extra things, I didn't really stray from this recipe. I feel like the extras made it a complete and filling meal. Delicious!

Ok - obviously you should not use the microwave....could have added some heat to it..use more herbs than caled for as the squash is fairly bland.

Used olive oil to sautee mushrooms with garlic. Unbelieveable!

Changed the recipe somewhat, but it was delicious. I baked the spaghetti squash at 300 for an hour, halved. Cooked mushrooms and onions on the stovetop in butter to let them sweat properly, and then added the herbs and some diced tomato before finishing with parmesan and s+p. Very enjoyable.

I was searching for a recipe for spaghetti squash and came across this one. Any recipe that starts with wrapping your food and microwaving in plastic should be immediately discarded. This makes toxic squash!

I've never reviewed a recipe where I diverged so much from the original, but this is actually a combination of two spaghetti squash recipes from this site and it turned out well...I used olive oil to saute the mushrooms, one medium onion (chopped), one red bell pepper (chopped) and 2 garlic cloves (minced), with 1 tsp Italian herb mix. Set vegetables aside, while I sauteed 12 ounces of italian sausage, added back the vegetables, and finally mixed in the microwaved squash strings. Served with parmesan. Very tasty. 4 servings.

Face it - we love spaghetti squash for its low GI. That doesn't mean we can't prepare it in a delicious, palatable manner. For South Beachers, pulverize the following mixture in your food processor and use it as a breading for chicken tenders or as topping for this dish, prepared as a casserole, similar to suggestions from other reviewers: 1 cup whole wheat bread crumbs; 1/4 cup parmesan cheese; 1/4 cup almonds; 2 Tbs parsley; 1 clove garlic; 1 tsp. salt; 1/4 tsp thyme; Black pepper

OK, so I baked the squash whole (punctured w/knife, 375 for 1 hour). I subbed shallots for the onion, cilantro for the parsley and skipped the chives. I will say, it was quite tasty, but probably go back to parsley if I were going to serve it to guests. I ate the whole thing myself as a meal, but I can see it serving two if there were other meal components. I will definitely make this again, it's a great recipe to tweak.

I also followed pdxgirl's recipe but used really good ricotta cheese in place of cottage cheese and a small can of tomato sauce (adding some dried basil and oregano). Terrific!

I just made one more delicious addition; toss in some pine nuts for added flavor, texture, and protein!

I enjoyed this recipe. I only tweaked it a tiny bit; I doubled the mushrooms and onions and sauteed them with a clove of garlic. I did microwave the squash to save time. I also took the advice of others and made this into a casserole, topped it with bread crumbs and parmesan, baked it for 10 minutes and broiled it for 5. Yummy!

I followed PDXGIRL's recommendations, but eliminated the cottage cheese and used diced tomatoes with basil in place of the tomato sauce. Used leftover garlic breadcrumbs from a cassoulet. YUM! Will def make again!

I have to admit - I kind of took this recipe & ran with it, so it's not quite the same recipe at all. I thought I should document it here, so I can remember next time! I, like others, baked my squash whole in the oven at 375 for 1 hour (w/holes pricked in it). Took it out, let it rest to cool, sliced it open & scooped out inside (getting rid of seeds). Threw in a 9x9 glass dish. Sauteed 1/4lb of shitakes in butter & shallots, mixed that into the squash, along with a handful of chopped parsley, about a cup or so of cottage cheese, & about half a jar of leftover spaghetti sauce. Topped with bread crumbs sauteed in butter & garlic, and shredded parmesan. Baked at 350 for 20 min. It was really really delicious!

I couldn't bring myself to microwave the butter and stuff, so I sauteed all of it instead. I think this probably gives the overall dish a fuller flavor. Also, the quality of your mushrooms will make a difference. Rather than button mushrooms, which I imagine would be very bland, make sure to use something like shiitake or portobello. I've also made this subbing shallots for the onions and fresh oregano for the parsley. Great substitutions if you have those ingredients on hand.

We eat healthy, so we avoid butter. Butter is definitely a tasty treat. But we didn't feel that this recipe was worth it. The dish was a somewhat bland.

As I explore the world of spaghetti squash recipes, I am very impressed with this one. I didn't use the microwave at all. Instead, I baked the squash and sauteed everything else in oil olive. I also added some shallot that I needed to get rid of, a clove of garlic, crushed red pepper for a little kick, and sausage. I'll definitely be making this one again!

made this with the exact directions of the previous cook who put breadcrumbs and parmesan and baked. came out so good, my guests wiped the dish clean. also sauteed the onions and the mushys.

So easy and simple to make. Visually appealing, as well. I too sautee'd the mushrooms (and I substituted leeks for onion) in a pan but otherwise left the recipe as is. Half the squash is defintely enough for two and I could see this alongside some simple roast chicken or chicken breasts and some asparagus or a green salad and paired with a crisp white wine. Delicious.

Good mix of flavors. I was itching to add more, but restrained myself and really enjoyed the simplicity. I sauteed the mushrooms on the stove - just can't bring myself to do that in the microwave. I mixed it all together and topped with bread crumbs sauteed in butter and garlic and the parmesan, then baked it for 20 minutes at around 350. That really made the squash strings creamy. I doubled the recipe and it made a nice dinner for 3.

This is just so easy and the tastes combine wonderfully. I will definitly make this one again.

I made this to go along with a beet and feta and dill risotto. Because of lack of a microwave, I baked the squash, as another reviewer suggested. I added about a half cup of bulgur to the sauteed mushrooms and onions before the parsley, and adjusted the broth accordingly (I just adjust by adding until I am happy with the result. Maybe an extra cup?) Everyone loved the result. It really was very yummy and very presentable. A wonderful vegetarian main dish. BTW. I don't know how big your spaghetti squashes are, but even without risotto, a half squash was way more than what two people could eat!

this was pretty easy- I baked the sqash at 375 for an hour, sauteed the mushrooms,onions, and added some shallots and garlic powder. Then simmered the saute mix in a 1/3 cu of chicken broth for a little extra flavor, about 5 min. After mixeing all ingrediants together with squash, I put it in a casserole dish, added a parm cheese/bread crumb mixture to the top and tossed in the broiler for a nice crust! yummmy!

Great dish! In regards to the microwave cook time, you have to remember that its just a guide, because different microwaves have different strengths and settings. I used this to make my lunch for the week, and its just as good the second (or third) day!

Delicious! I made the whole squash, as this was my hubby's and my "only" dinner. Yummy and filling... didn't even finish my portion. Maybe it was because I was microwaving both halves at the same time, but it actually took about 14-15 minutes to cook the squash thoroughly.

We love recipes that are not only delicious, but can be made in advance, and this one qualifies. Creatures of habit, we prepared the squash as we have for many years - pieced with a fork, placed in a baking dish with some water, and baked at 375 for an hour. We then removed the seeds and separated the flesh with a fork, combined it with the other ingredients(which have been prepared in advance) and then just warmed it in the microwave for 3 minutes - absolutely delicious!

Great basic recipe for spaghetti squash. Spaghetti squash is so easy to grow but only a few plants will give you many squash. It stores well. But a recipe like this you can go any way you want, Southwest or Creol, Will use this many times. From my two plants got 20 spaghetti squash.
