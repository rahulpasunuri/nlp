This is bad. First you must use green plantains, I cut them in 1/2 in. rounds, Onions,carrot a couple of ribs of celery, garlic, bay leaf and some people use cumin, I do not like it so I use cilantro and of course salt and pepper to taste. Before you eat it we add some home made mariquitas or chicharritas (plantain chips)into the soup.

instead of using a blender start by sredding the plaintain put on a deep pot season with salt peper and chicken cubes, add plenty water the plaintain soaks a lot of water!! throw a chicken breast during cooking time , when fully cooked pull out and shred them mix with soup. great dish to boost you up when sick

try adding a chicken breast while cooking then shred before serving, you can also use a grater and grate one of the plaintains and make little balls this is a puertorican way to add fun to it

This recipe needs help. Start with sauteing onion, garlic and carrots. (Rough chop.) Saute until translucent. Add chichen (or veg) stock and chopped plantain. Bring to a boil for 10 minutes. Add some milk or cream. Puree in a blender (small batches, carefull, its hot!) and push through a med fine mesh sieve. Add salt,pepper and cumin each time to desired taste This will smoothe out the texture to a wonderful "mouthfeel". I added some unsweetened coconut milk to round out the flavor and add a more carribean feel to it. I will serve it with homemade tortilla chips and a dollop of cumin creme fraiche.

It was okay, but not great. The flavor of the soup was initially interesting, but the texture was unpleasant. The soup seemed to coat the tongue and teeth. The more we ate of it, the less we liked it and I threw the rest out.

Superb! Very tasty & easy to make & being fat-free is a bonus!!!

Didn't make it once and wouldn't again. It doesn't read esp. delish. For a more authentic plaintain soup, try Miami Spice by Steven Raichlen. He has a fab recipe in there using green plaintains- known as "Bellyache Soup" because it is good for stomachaches. I am eating his version right now. Wonderful!

This was thick and bland. Perhaps a good cook would know what it needed, but I didn't. It isn't very good "right out of the box." It needs fixing up.

A very elegant and exotic soup
