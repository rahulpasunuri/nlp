An easy and elegant summer-time dessert, I did the recipe exactly as written; however, we were a bit disappointed. The syrup seemed to lack depth, although I loved the combination of vanilla, plums and peppercorn. Next time, I will try making the syrup using half white or rose wine and half water. Star anise could also be a good addition. I look forward to what others say...
