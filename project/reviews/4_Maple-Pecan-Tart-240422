This dessert was so tasty! After reading the previous reviews I did the following: 1. I didn't roll out the dough, rather separated it into 6 equal sections and pressed it into the pan. 2. I pressed the dough into six 4-inch tart pans so everyone could have their own "mini-dessert". I baked it as normal. Turned out great! 3. I added a touch of cinnamon to the crust. 4. I didn't have any dark corn syrup, so I used 3 parts light corn syrup and 1 part molasses. Fabulous dessert!

This was the best pecan pie I have had. So rich & decadent. The crust was a little tricky. After I rolled it out it stuck to the board. But I just pressed the pieces in the pan. I think next time I will chill the dough & then roll out & place in tart pan. I will def. make this again.

My husband had been delighting us all with his search for the perfect pecan dessert. Now that he has found this Maple Syrup Pecan Tart he no longer experiments with other recipes. This is perfection and we look forward to serving it during the holidays.

I used all maple syrup cause I love it! Came out great, even in the pie pan I had to use because I couldn't find my tart pans at the last minute. Yummy for pecan and maple lovers!

My husband has never liked pecan pie because it's too sweet and gooey. He LOVES this tart!!! One change I made was to add a bit of rum to the filling and then top it with a dollop of brown sugar, rum whipped cream. DELICIOUS!!! I can't roll the crust so I just press it into the pan but it's a great cookie like crust.

This was very easy and came out perfectly. After reading other reviews, I didn't even bother to roll out the dough after chilling. Just put it in the pan, and pushed it into place using the plastic wrap to keep it smooth. Next time I'd like to add some cinnamon to the crust and a little lemon zest to the filling. A keeper!

This is a keeper. Followed the recipe except used 3/4 cup maple syrup (Vermont of course) and 1/4 cup dark corn syrup. Do not have a 9 inch tart pan so used 9" spring form instead. Patted crust in - did not attempt to roll it. Worked just great. Rave reviews and requests for the recipe from guests.

My husband hates a traditional pecan pie because they are too gooey and sickening sweet. This one he LOVED!!! I did have to press the crust into the pan but it was very good and didn't take that long to do. I also added a splash of rum to the filling and it was a great touch. It's good served with a brown sugar rum whipped cream.

this tart was easy and very tasty. i doubled this recipe and gave one to a friend for her engagement party and froze one to give a friend for his birthday a couple of weeks later. i cheated by using store-bought pie crust, and i used earth balance baking sticks in place of butter. the maple syrup was definitely a winning touch! the pies had just the right sweetness and crunch. this recipe freezes very well, so it's great to make in advance and prepare for surprise company or a last-minute dinner party!

for some reason i had a hankering for a pecan tart in the beginning of may. this was a treat. the filling is wonderful and i will use it again. the crust, however, is absolutely terrible. it's tempting to make bc it is a quick crust, but don't be roped into trying it. it's way too fatty, due to the added egg, to roll out and lacks any buttery flavor. if the crust were better, or at all good, i would have rated this recipe 4 stars.

This recipe is outstanding and delicious. However, I could not roll out the crust. I'm eliminating this step and going directly to the part that says to press it into the pan(9", etc)

Ok, I should have known, having absolutely NO skills with pastry, that the crust would be my achilles heel. I usually buy my crusts pre-made, but I wanted to try a tart, thinking I could skate thru making more of a cookie crust than pie crust. Well, there was just NO way I could get the crust to be rolled out. No matter how much flour I put on my board or my rolling pin. So I just picked it up, piece by piece, and formed the tart crust with my hands. I pricked it and put it gingerly in the freezer. I did not use the corn syrup, due to an allergy and used only maple syrup with the brown sugar. I had some chopped and some halves for the pecans. It's out of the oven now, did NOT run out of the shell or over the top. It looks lovely. Can't wait to taste it tomorrow. Happy Holidays All!

This is my all time favorite pecan tart. I do not look for another one. It is simple to make and it's very tasty.I get perfect result each time and I made this one at least a dozen times.

My favorite party/company dessert. I make it in a deep glass pie dish and increase the cook time by aprox. 15 min. Only use good quality maple syrup.

I loved this tart. Baking a pecan pie and fussing with covering the edges of the crust with foil bugs me, so I was thrilled to find a tart recipe that filled the crust perfectly! I made my own crust, so I can't comment on that part of the recipe. And I abhor corn syrup so I skipped it all together and used a whole cup of maple syrup - that gave great maple flavor. I toasted the chopped pecans and decorated the top of the tart (before baking) with raw pecan halves. There was no problem with the filling being too gooey - it set just right. The tart got raves and I will definitely be making this again.

Excellent. I recommend hand-chopping the pecans and adding some whole pecans on the top for decoration.

Delicious. Everyone loved it-kids and adults. Ran out onto baking sheet but that was ok because we scooped that up with a spoon and ate it too. :) Used a very dark, strongly flavored maple syrup.

I messed up the tart crust from another website that had the same ingredients. I didn't pay attention and neglected to process it long enough in the food processor and when it looked too grainy, started going nuts adding water to hold it together. When that didn't seem to work, I added the egg white from the yolk called for in the recipe. One gooey, gloopy mess later I decided I had messed up beyond repair and stuffed it into the freezer. Fast forward one week, and me craving pecan pie like crazy. The tart shell was all ready to go so I found this maple pecan tart in a google search. Here's where it gets interesting: I didn't have enough maple syrup nor did I have corn syrup. I got out a one-cup measuring cup and poured in a scant 1/4 cup of maple syrup, a generous half cup of golden syrup that was starting to coagulate in the jar, and then added a splash of molasses. I didn't quite have a full cup of syrups but it was close. I didn't want the molasses flavor to be overpowering. Since I was short on maple syrup, I added a dose of maple extract. The end result of this almost entirely botched and improvised tart is very tasty. I have to think that it speaks well of the recipe if it can hold up to this many mistakes and still yield really good results. Eventually I'll make it again, perhaps with all the right ingredients and a successful crust.

This was excellent. The other maple pecan tart on this site tastes more maple, but I could never get the gunk to solidify properly. Maybe next time I'll try 3/4 cup maple syrup and cut the dark Karo to 1/4 cup. This is one pie I don't mind trying until I get it perfect. Some of the filling did run under the crust and made the rim hard to remove. Next time I won't prick the crust.

I have made this recipe several times for many different occasions. I always receive great reviews!

I toasted the pecans that go in the filling. I used a bigger tart pan and place un-toasted pecan halves on top of the filling. It was a nice presentation and tasted great.

This is a simple recipe with showstopping results (i.e. results that look exactly like the picture)! I followed the exact recipe except that I pat the crust into the tart pan instead of rolling it out. The tart tasted and looked great. I served it with slightly sweetened whipped cream and got rave reviews.

The compressed tart presentation is great; I'll never make a pie again. The maple taste is so subtle as to almost be undetectable. I might use more syrup or maple extract next time.

Very easy to make and excellent results! I did toast my pecans before adding to the filling and cheated with a store bought crust, but other than that followed recipe exactly. Guests raved! This goes into my keeper file.

perfect!! definately replaces the old classic recipe!!

This was a very easy tart with a delicious crust. The tart is flavorful but cuts down on some of the "goo factor" that traditional pecan pies have. The maple flavor was only hinted at and was not prevelant in the final product.

After reading the reviews I paid attn to the dough before I rolled it out, did look a bit dry, so I added a couple tablespoons of water. It all came out perfectly. I also read the comments about sweetness, and I would like to balance those comments with my family's opinion that it was wonderful. I will make it again, my only change next time will be to use a better quality maple syrup, I used a cheap bottle and I did not get enough maple flavor.

My first problem was with the crust. It was entirely too dry and had to be pressed into the pan. Then, I left it in the refrigerator all week with no time to finish the recipe. Once I got to baking it, the crust, filling and all came out fabulous. The sweetness does need to be cut with cream or ice cream as the recipe suggests.

WAY too sweet! The pecans were yummy (I used whole ones) and the crust was also delicious. But the filling was awful. The description says "pecan pie is all grown up", which I took to mean not so sweet. Was I ever wrong!

Rating: 4
I used a standard sweet pastry crust recipe, and increased the filling proportions to fit my 11 inch tart pan and this came out totally amazing, better than my usual pecan pie which I always thought was pretty good. The increased ratio of crusty top to interior goo over the usual deep-dish pecan pie was a good change. Not too sweet at all.

The tart turned out really nice, crust just perfect. We were afraid that the filling would be runny or too sweet, but no, came out just perfect. The guests asked to take some with them, we had no left-overs.

This tart was outstanding and a welcome change of pace from the usual gelatinous pecan pie. I was concerned that the maple syrup would be too sweet, but it just adds depth of flavor. The only negative is that I found the crust difficult to transfer to the tart pan...even a tiny crack results in leakage.

I had same problem with the crust. next time i would roll out on wax paper to make it easier to move into the tart pan. everyone said they liked it.

Although I too experienced issues with the crust at first, I thoroughly enjoyed this version of pecan tart. Loved the addition of the maple. Easy enough to make and delicious.

I did use my own crust, since I have to eat gluten free so I cannot review the crust. But the filling was amazing. Not too sweet, nice flavor, and could taste the nuts. I used a simple sugar instead of the corn syrup. This is on my make every year list.

This tart was delicious! The crust did seem a little dry but it worked out perfectly in the end. I was doubling the recipe but was 2 eggs short for the filling (oops) so I used 4 instead of 6 and it was not runny at all. I also added a little bourbon and some orange rind to the filling. Everyone loved it!

This was truly the most disappointing pecan tart I've ever made. I made it precisely as indicated, cannot understand why it came out so runny. I'll stick w/ my old favorite. Thanks but, no thanks.

Could I really be the only one who had issues with this crust? I should have known-- as I added the flour it appeared to be too dry. Then, it didn't roll out well at all and completely fell apart as I tried to move it into the tart pan. I ended up pressing the numerous pieces into the pan as if I'd never rolled it out. The only reason I gave it two forks is that the filling was great. IF you use your own crust recipe and avoid this one, you should have a nice tart.

I bet you will like this even more if you use brown rice syrup in place of corn syrup.

This tart is better than pecan pie. Everybody loved it when I made it. I used a classis Pate Brisee for the dough. Very flakey. Planning on making it for Thanksgiving.

Fabulous pecan tart. My husband, 21 year old son and guests loved it more than pecan pie. Because I make a lot of tarts, I prebaked the crust as is my custom and also added one tbl. of liquid to the egg yolk. Fabulous!

Made it for a shower. It received rave reviews all around and many requests for the recipe. I doubled the recipe, used an 11" pan and cooked it till almost set.
