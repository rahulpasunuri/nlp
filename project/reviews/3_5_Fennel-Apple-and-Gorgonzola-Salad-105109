My parents made this one time when I was 15 for my friends and I. Everyone loved it, since then I've always wanted to make it, I'm getting fennel this week and it will become this salad. Wish me luck.

Tasty, though I modified the recipe as per many other reviews by adding some honey to the dressing (and some marjoram). Definitely try to seek out a particularly mild blue cheese, otherwise it'll somewhat overpower the rest of the ingredients. All in all, though, a crisp and refreshing salad with good improvisation potential.

I made this just as the recipe was written and was disappointed. It was edible but I thought it was just so-so. My husband really didn't care for it at all.

delicious - i toasted walnuts to top the salad and used a bit of fresh chopped cilantro and majoram plus chopped shallot and some sherry vinegar for the dressing, in addition to lemon juice. i also substituted chopped dates for the currants. the cliantro and walnuts contributed beautifully to the flavors of the apple and fennel.

This salad is beautiful, easy and delicious! I substituted dried cranberries and in error used fresh orange juice instead of lemon juice. For me, I wouldn't change a thing.

This salad has been a hit every time I make it. One guest HAD to have a copy to take to Napa Valley with them to make for his friends. Great summer salad and great with a heavier winter meal.

The dressing needs a bit of sweetness so I added a dab of honey and a dash of apple cider.

Yummy! I added a little honey to the recipe and have yet to add the gorgonzola which I will do for dinner. I will be making this for company. I just had to try it first as I was unsure of the final outcome, since fennel isn't a basic ingredient.

This is a delicious salad, just as is. i"ve also made it with fennel that I've sauteed until caramelized and comice pears. Serve it with the gorgonzola on a slice of toasted baguette and its a great fall/winter salad. (Got the idea from Mario Batali)

Tastes like summer. Delicious, easy, and fast. I don't usually like fennel, but this is great! I've made it several times and it is always well received.
