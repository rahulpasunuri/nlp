These were really good and seemed very traditional. I made them last week but later tried a less traditional shortcut version which was also really delicious and eliminated the bun making part. when I am in a rush I fear preparing dough! They came out great. here's the recipe I used and you can see photos of how it should look- Yum! http://www.neurotickitchen.com/2013/01/lifes-better-with-bacon-steamed-bacon.html

Did my Jewish boyfriend eat pork? Oh yes he did. I'd never made pork belly before, but the recipe was easy and delicious. The buns were time consuming, but well worth it- they do indeed freeze beautifully.

This is a delicious recipe, but i made it from David Chang's book Momofuku. The recipe for the dough is totally different!!!

every time i'm in manhattan, i visit at least one of david chang's momofuku restaurants and order one of these buns. i'm actually going to nyc again this weekend, but i couldn't wait so i decided to make these at home the other day. brining and roasting the pork was a breeze. i couldn't believe how easy it was! however, i didn't roast the pork at 450 for an additional 20 minutes, maybe just 5-10. it smelled like it was already done so i took it out so it wouldn't burn. it was perfect. also, i took a short cut by buying the buns. you can find them at the refrigerated section of asian grocery stores. i steamed them, and they came out pillowy soft!

I think this tasted exactly what it was supposed to taste like, but it wasn't to our taste. I think we like things a little spicier and did not fit our palate. I don't think I'll make it again. I stick with making bbq pork shoulder in my smoker.

Lots of work but a great trip to Chinatown. One comment: the buns are tastier when made fresh, and also when you warm them in a dampened towel make the package flat, so they are all heated evenly. Vegetarians got roasted red pepers insteadof port and enjoyed it. It's a bit messy toeat, so serve with lots of napkins (or wipes).

This is a difficult recipe. Not the pork belly - which is a breeze - but the steamed bun part. I did a blog post on the pork belly and most importantly, the trial and error of these fussy buns. http://kitchensidecar.blogspot.com/20 08/12/david-chang-is-my-homeboy- momofuku-pork.html http://kitchensidecar.blogspot.com/20 08/12/steamed-buns-test-kitchen- evolution.html

loved it. I made the buns in the bread maker so it was all pretty much fuss free and came out light and fluffy. I also replaced the Hoi Sin with sweet plum sauce and it was delicious.

I made these for my wife's graduation party and they were a hit! I would guess people that had trouble with dough rising either had bad yeast or possibly overworked the dough...I kneaded for about 1/5 of the recommended time and got wonderfully light, airy buns. I would definitely recommend getting your butcher to skin the bellies for you...I did it myself and deeply regretted it (I did a double recipe and couldn't turn my head for days!)

I don't know why others had problems with this recipe, but it turned out perfectly for me, including the buns. I've had these at Momofuku and this recipe was an exact replication. I'm making them for the second time. They are absolutely sublime

Check out December's issue of GQ where's a comprehensive article on David Chang, co-founder of the Momofuku restaurants. The buns are from a Chinatown bakery while the hoi sin is Lee Kum Kee's.

There is not enough yeast in this recipe for the buns to rise. After figuring this out and correcting the problem it ws too late to use the buns. I did make the pork and used buns bought at store. The pork was good and was a nice combo with hoison and cucumber. Unfortunately the store bought buns were a bummer. Will try again tho, becuase my husband loved the pork.

Well.. I took a risk and was going to serve these at a party. I followed all intructions to the T, yet the buns did not rise. I also was not happy with the 'folded over' look of them prior to letting them proof. The recipe for the dough is alot different from other bao recipes, which made me suspect. I ended up using another recipe for bao that I found online after these failed so miserably to rise. As for the pork belly.. It turns out moist, and good.. but is not one of my fave pork belly recipes.. I did add some all spice berries and star anise to the brine, but even with that small addition the pork wasnt all that special. Wont make this one again.
