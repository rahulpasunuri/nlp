I use crab stock as a base for seafood gumbo. I have also used it as a base for chowder instead of fish stock.

a good basic recipe for bisques, chowders. I sometimes add a bit of cognac and saffron for the bisque. I really like this stock best for the crab and corn chowder-great in the early summer when the sweet corn arrives.

This recipe was wonderful. Unable to find fresh crab I was able to get 2 Dungoness crabs from Sam's club in the frozen section. I added there to luke warm water and brought to a boil. I then removed the crab. Cleaned the meat from it (saving it of course) and thew everythign back into the pot. I then added the other ingredients and let simmer. I used the stock to make the Tomato Basil Crab Bisque also found in Epicurious ( instead of the clam juice and Clamato it called for). The 2 crabs produced about 20 oz of meat (need to clean the bodies) so it was perfect. Try the bisque.... The taste was out of this world!

I've made this stock several times and used it in the tomato basil crab bisque on this site as well as any time that recipes call for clam juice. Freezing it in ice cubes makes life a lot easier when you want to use it later.

I made this only because I was shelling some crabs and wanted to make good use of the crab shell. It's sitting in my freezer and I don't know what to do with it. People, please suggest some recipes to use the crab stock. I searched under "crab stock" and didn't turn up any recipes.

This is a great use for all those leftover crab bodies & teeny legs. You don't even have to pick the meat to feel virtuous! Makes a delicious broth to use as a base for gumbo or chowder.
