The zest took the pie to a new level - was outstanding yet sublte and not overpowering. I had upped the spices a tad, and will do even more ginger 1.5 teaspoons next time - it tasted great with the citrus. I replaced cream with half and half. Only used 1 cup per other reviews.

The citrus notes made this pumpkin pie not quite refreshing, but lighter and delicious. A hit with all my non-pie loving guests.

Really good. I'd suggest using more lemon and orange peel. I used 2 teaspoons of each, plus some diced zests, a teaspoon of lemon juice and a teaspoon of OJ, and it still wasn't quite strong enough.

awesome - i'm not a pumpkin pie fan, but this is terrific. everyone loved it. not sure i'll use the all-butter crust again though, it really shrank down into the pie plate. don't skip the candied peel, it really makes the pie.

Pumpkin pie can verge on tasting like baby food, so I was excited to find this recipe. It did not disappoint--the zest and grand marnier topping were very subtle--but not too subtle and really livened up this dish. Everyone loved it.

Pumpkin pie always verges on tasting a bit like baby food so the addition of the zest and grand marnier topping really improve this dish, without overpowering it. I was worried that the zest might be too subtle to be noticed, but it was perfect.

There are few ways to improve the pumpkin pie, and this is a very nice variation. I followed the directions for everything but the spices because I didn't have cloves so I threw in cardamon (which smells soo good) and it was lovely. You should bother with the grand marnier, it's nice.

To previous reviewer: Perfect Pumpkin Pie is another recipe on epicurious. There's usually a hyperlink inside the recipe it's being used in, but looks like they left it out. http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Perfect-Pumpkin-Pie-236476

what is Perfect Pumpkin Pie? Is this a premade filling? I've never heard of it. This recipe looks good, except i can't figure it out.

Are people serious? This is not a pie recipe at all... What is everyone talking about?

I first made this last year for Thanksgiving and I am making it again this year. The grand marnier cream makes it very elegant.

I made this last year for Thanksgiving and it was THE BEST pumpkin pie I have ever tasted!!! Hands Down! Did not try the cream.

I served this for Thanksgiving dinner and it got rave reviews. I found it very easy to make and I am generally not very good with pie recipes.

I do not even like pumpkin pie, but this recipe made my mouth water. Absolutely delicious! Now I can eat pumpkin pie during the holidays with my family -- as long as I bring this recipe!!

Delicious. I used 4 tsp of orange peel, no lemon peel. The whipping cream with the Grand Marnier is excelent and the Perfect Pumpkin Pie is the best.
