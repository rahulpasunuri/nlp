I had this receipe for the first time at a party and really enjoyed it. it's light, different and a great finger food. i now frequently make it as my signature contribution to others' events.

the ingredients in this recipe are perfect. this recipe most certainly does not make 60 pieces- 40 at most. i used a soft gorgonzola- so i only used about 1/2 tsp. in each roll. i bought a bag of a variety of dried berries and they were awesome. the prosciutto has to be very thin-for the jelly-roll style. the other alteration that i made was that i took 1 piece of the prosciutto and halved it length-wise and then made my rolls- it makes it a bit easier- because this dish is a little time consuming.

Sounded great but everything was falling apart on me during assembly. Was using dried cherries instead of currants. Too much of a pain to be worth doing, even though the tastes were yummy together.

I thought they were just OK, but they were such a hit that I'd make them again. Simple to make and look pretty.

Rave reviews for this dish. Added chopped walnuts to the cheese and currants - nice complement. Not hard to assemble - but the thin prosciutto has the advantage of sticking to itself - this keeps the rolls together. Thicker prosciutto tends not to adhere and the rolls begin to unravel. Find a happy medium in your prosciutto thickness and this recipe is a keeper.

I had to make some changes because I didn't have any currants. So instead, I made three varieties: fresh mission fig, toasted walnuts and dried cranberries. They were awesome! Yes, they took some time, but they were not difficult to make. They make a great visual appetizer , too. I made them for our block party and they were gone quickly and people talked about them for hours. Five people asked for the recipe on the spot. That says it all!

This was a bit labor intensive but quite good. I followed others' advice and added dried cranberries and toasted walnuts to the filling. Definitely one to make again.

Very unique and delicious appetizer. I recommend having the prosciutto sliced thicker to make it easier to roll.

I absolutely love this recipe. I've made it twice - once with currants and once with dried cranberries, and both were very good. Though it's one of the most labor intensive dishes I make for cocktail parties, it's definitely worth the time. This is always the dish that disappears first.

So simple but received rave reviews. I didn't do currants. I think toasted walnuts or pinenuts sound great too!

Great party food. I used small pieces of the whole cheese without incident -- and added small pieces of toasted walnuts as well as per other reviews...great addition.

Rating: 3
Very easy and elegant. I think making them ahead of time and then letting them sit in the fridge mellows the flavors of the gorgonzola - the ones I ate after everyone had left (that had been in the fridge for hours) were my favorites.

I mashed the cheese with some milk to make it into a very think mixture which made it easy to roll. I did not use paper thin prosciutto...but it was pretty thin and I had no problem rolling. I also added toasted walnuts, thanks to the reviewers for the suggestion. It really wasn't all that time consuming for such an elegant appetizer. I served these alongside some skewers of grape-cherry tomatoes fresh basil and bocconcini. What a beautiful presentation for a late summer elegant barbeque.

this is really delicious. i couldn't find currants at the store so i used cantelope. awesome. i made it for my boyfriend and served it with rosemary bread and olive oil. with extra gorgonzola for the bread. he thought i was brilliant.

I don't eat proscuitto, so I substituted smoked salmon and this recipe was great! I am making it again, and I will use the recommendation to make the cheese easier to deal with. For a pretty presentation, you can pipe the cheese through a cake decorator.

Very easy and delicious! I used goat cheese instead of gorgonzola and added fig along with the currants. I added some salt, pepper and olive oil before I served it and everyone loved it!

This was a phenomenal recipe - fairly easy to make, and definitely looked gourmet. A couple of recommendations - first, the idea from other reviewers about adding walnuts was terrific - it added a new texture. Also, do not use paper-thin slices of proscicuitto, because it will be nearly impossible to wrap. Go thin, but not too thin. Also, for the gorgonzola, I recommend buying a whole chunk of the cheese. Then, mix it in a bowl with some milk (a few tablespoons)until it is creamy (the cheese will kind of dissolve in the milk). Then wait a few minutes for it to thicken, and mix in the currants and walnuts. It will have a pasty consistency that will be easy to spread. Finally, for presentation, I placed the wraps in a pinwheel shape on a plate, and made a small flower of arugala in the center - it looked terrific.

I made this and found the combined flavors to be outstanding but they were way too labor intensive. I will have to find another way to serve.

Rating: 3
I really like these but they are tricky to make if the prosciuto isn't sliced thick enough. Even then, the slices pull apart a bit so you have to be careful! Guests seem to like them a lot though.

I was excited about making this recipe after reading all the reviews but did not find it impressive. I bought creamy gorgonzola as suggested but it seemed like it overpowered all the other flavors. I even added extra currants but you could hardly taste them. I also asked the butcher to slice the proscuitto in thicker slices but they weren't thick enough which made the wrapping tough. All in all, I was disappointed with the outcome of these...everybody did enjoy the "crab nachos" which are also on this web site.

This is a very easy recipe with lots of rewards--you are sure to receive lots of good praises. The presentation is easy, the taste is delicious. I used dried cranberries instead of currants and added chopped walnuts. I will definitely make this recipe again.

This was a wonderful easy appetizer. I had some nice thick Italian prosciutto, didn't have currants so used raisans and it was still fine. Next time I will try mixing in either some pine nuts or walnuts as per other people's suggestions. I will definitely make this again.

I made it for a cocktail party using several of the suggestions provided by other reviewers (add walnuts, use creamy gorgonzola, and use thicker slices of prosciutto). Wonderful!!!

My Mom made this (after I forwarded it to her) for a cocktail party they hosted a few days before our wedding. It was great and served as a good compliment to the other hors d'ouvres that they had. There were absolutely none left, in fact the only ones I got to eat where while they were being made in the kitchen before hand!

I wasn't sure if this would be tasty or not. It was surprisingly good. You must have the currants, though. 1. Next time, I won't bother cutting the prosciutto. I just laid the leaves down and rolled it. I was still able to make it look like the picture. 2. Next time, I will mix the currants into the cheese. The sweet with the cheese is SO good! 3. I'll also try to use fig instead of currants.

Thanks to all who precede me, as your suggestions are well taken. Thicker than "paper" thin prosciutto is more easily handled. Using a creamy style gogonzola makes it easier to handle, as well. Actually, I used a dolce gorgonzola, and it balanced the pepperiness in the arugula perfectly. Highly recommend this creative combination of colors, textures and flavors.

Good suggestions here from reviewers. I used pinenuts, and had the prosciutto sliced a little thicker than usual which was helpful. Delicious!

Yummy! Made this for a cocktail party and it disappeared instantly. Put the sheets of prosciutto in the freezer for about 20 minutes before rolling the wraps and they'll go together much easier.

Rating: 3
The combination of flavors here is excellent. You may want to get a little thicker than "paper-thin" prosciutto and use whole gorgonzola that you crumble as you work. This was gobbled up by everyone, even the four year old!

This was eaten up very quickly and was enjoyed by everyone. The only problem I had was in the wrapping - the proscuitto was a bit awkward to work with. But a great overall taste. I stuck with the currants and it was a perfect combo.

Thanks to reviewer suggestions, I had thicker slices, toasted walnuts. I used creamy gorgonzola instead of crumbles, which kind of "glued" things together, making assembly easier, and I used half a slice instead of 1/3. They disappeared fast to raves. I'd definitely make this again.

I made this in about 15 minutes before heading out the door for an outdoor picnic at Ravinia. I used pre cut and packaged prosciutto, and watercress instead of arugula, and crumbled ssome candied walnuts over the cheese. WOW!!! My friends ate every last bite and neighbors were asking for some. It is easy and looks so gourmet. A perfect appetizer.

Maybe it was just me, but I found this dish to be extremely difficult to construct. The cheese was too crumbly; the prosciutto too thin and the end result looked like my 6 year old made the wraps. However, I took the ingredients, which are a delicious combination and made bruchetta.

I liked this quite a bit, but next time, I will have the butcher slice the prosciutto a little thicker. I had a hard time wrapping it up bcz it kept splitting. I also took the liberty of adding some toasted walnuts sprinkled w/ a little garlic and the result was wonderful. Truly, the only complaint save the difficulty wrapping them, was the way they wilted shortly after I brought them out. Oh well, it was a hot day.

This recipe went over great. I used walnuts as well and I think that keeping them in the fridge for a good hour before serving made them taste even better. I will definately make them again. Very pleasing to the eye as well.

Fantastic. I added a very small amount of candied walnut on the gorgonzola...

I made this for a small dinner party -- exactly as written -- and thought it was a great combination of flavors. served with cocktails and mixed olives. everyone enjoyed. one note -- watch the "paperthin" slices of prosciutto, my butcher took the direction to heart and it made the rolling a little more cumbersome than i otherwise hoped it would be. I thought the appetizer ideas in this BonApp article were great

Pretty good, but won't make it again. There are other better recipes on this site. To "A Cook", , I must defend Sacramento in that when I am looking for a recipe on this site, I really do care how it turns out as written. People substitute skim milk for cream, omit the sugar and use Pam instead of butter. This is NOT the same recipe and does not deserve a One Fork rating. I do love the comments about improving a recipe - there are some outstanding cooks on this site who share some great tips for making a so-so dish really good (check out the Halftime Chili recipe to see what I mean. With the suggestions, this is one awesome recipe) - but when people skew the results without testing the recipe or by changing it so that it becomes something entirely different, it really annoys me!!!!!!!

Rating: 4
FYI Sacramento -and others of similar ilk - I for one have really appreciated other's notes on recipe changes and/or substitutions that worked for them. It helps me evaluate the recipe for its suitability ahead of time and has allowed me to add some spark to an otherwise ho-hum recipe by utilizing an idea that sometimes more than one reviewer has suggested! That's how we learn folks!

Delicious recipe - my guests all raved about them. Tried one of your user's suggestion and used walnuts instead of currents and they were great.

I didn't use the currants. Instead, I sauted untoasted pine nuts in butter and sugar. While the nuts were still hot, I mixed them with the cheese, meltling it slightly. Doing that made this dish really easy to assemble. And my birlfriend absolutely *loved* them.

Very easy and great flavors. I left out the currants and substituted walnuts. I lightly sauted them in butter and sugar. The contrast of the sweetness of the walnuts and saltiness of the prosciutto and gorgonzola was greatness.

Excellent and very easy to prepare. I left out the currants and they were still great. In fact, my guests preferred them over the traditional prosciutto and melon I had also prepared. Will definetely make them again.
