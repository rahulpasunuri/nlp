It's hard to go wrong with bread and olive oil! I had to grill mine a little longer than 1 min per side too, but not a big deal. I also added fresh garlic to my oil which made it delicious. But you could add whatever you want...basil, rosemary, chilis, or just salt and fresh cracked pepper. A nice alternative to soggy garlic bread!

Try this one! We sliced our baguette extremely diagonally and added minced garlic, rosemary and oregano from our garden to the olive oil. Brushed both sides with the mixture and had to 'Q' it a bit longer than one minute per side, but this is the best grilled bread we've ever had. Will definitely make again.
