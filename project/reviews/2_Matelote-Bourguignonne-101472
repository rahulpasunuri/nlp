Yeah...I don't even think the Japanese eat raw eel...it's at LEAST pickled, usually smoked though. I have heard that, in London, jellied eel (rolleyes) is a popular apre' opera dish!!

Chris...I've had live eel served at a wonderful Chinese restaurant, still squirming as it was brought to the table...same night I enjoyed fugu for the first time...so I would have to agree with the cook from Mullet, MA and say I enjoy raw eel.

I agree with the assertion of "A Cook from Mullet" that the dish is bland, but a little extra in the herb and seasoning department fixed that. Incidentally, Cook from Mullet, just because you eat eel in sushi restaurants doesn't mean it's raw. Unagi is barbecued. Freshwater eel, like most freshwater fish, is extremely dangerous raw and is hardly ever eaten.

Rather bland but I like my eel raw...

An intresting blend of flavours but like most old style cuisine lacks depth and character. Could do better.
