Bravo! Great reminder to check the year of the recipe. Same thing goes for the length of time to cook & the temps for pork! Good recipe. Much better at room temp than cold.

If you don't want to put the tomatoes in the fridge then don't! This is a wonderful recipe and the flavours complement each other. Fortunately for all of us, many cooks know how to improvise!

To the person who said "This would be a non-starter for me as tomatoes should NEVER be placed in the fridge"... Uh, Hello...! This recipe was from 1956 (um, that's 46 years old). Any good cook knows how to improvise and not putting it in the fridge would be a good place to start instead of knocking the entire recipe. IMHO....
