This was tasty, but the chicken was a bit dry - even for me and I like my chicken well done. Maybe it was the brand of chicken or perhaps I over cooked

It had a great taste I followed the recipe exactly. A little too much liquid and not a thick gravy. I was thinking of adding some flour to the sauce to thicken it up after. I served it with Garlic Mashed potatoes so the gravy would have been nice. It came out a little tough (for me) I like it falling off the bone. Next time I will cut down on the baking time. I think this would be a great crock pot recipe just add some potatoes.

very tasty and flavorful. my only criticism is that there might have been a bit too much liquid but my friends i made it for liked just the way it was. the sauce packet though made everything perfectly seasoned.

This was easy and tasty - great for a weeknight. The sauce had nice flavor but I thought it could have been zested up a notch. Next time I'll add some fresh herbs and garlic.

This dish, prepared as directed, was wonderful. Many reviews mention dried out chicken, I believe because they are using boneless/skinless breast. Big mistake if true. The breasts came out very moist and flavorful and a very attractive dish. Enjoyed some grated asiago once plated as one reviewer recommended!

After reading all the reviews, I was really disappointed in this dish. I thought that it lacked taste. Actually, it almost tasted like institutional food to me. I definately would not make it again. I did follow the recipe exactly as it is written however I did use skinless and boneless chicken breasts. I also made rice since we are not polenta fans. I am giving all the leftovers to my dog for his meals this week!

The spaghetti sauce pack is what makes the sauce thick. My husband could not get enough of this recipe. This is a new family favorite. Good for a busy week night.

I made this dish last night for the first time and am sure I will make it again. I didn't have any dry white wine so I substituted a dry red. I also didn't have a spaghetti sauce seasoning packet so I added some oregano, basil, parsley, salt and black pepper. I was just at the point where I needed to remove the foil when my husband said he wanted to work out before dinner so I slowed the oven to 250 degrees and put the foil back on the chicken until ten minutes before he was ready to eat. The chicken came just as tender as could be. I served it with celery root puree and a red wine to drink. Yum...

While this isn't a "dish beyond compare" it certainly is a great option for a week-night dinner where you are low on time, but don't want to sacrifice flavor. I added garlic and fresh herbs from the garden. I also used boneless, skinless breasts because I always have them on hand... they were great. I was skeptical about the spaghetti sauce mix, but it did make a surprisingly good sauce. The polenta is to die for. If you don't make it, definitely make a starch, as you need something to soak up the sauce. I will definitely make it again.

I make this quite often as a quick weekday meal with the suggestions of others. I definitely use tomato paste and italian seasoning to sub the spaghetti mix. I think it is great basic recipe and you can play around with alot which is always fun!

This was okay. Reminded us of Chicken Caccitore. I have to say, though, that the sauce really went well with the polenta, and the polenta was excellent. If I were to make this again, I would use boneless thighs. FYI - The Spaghetti packet has thickeners in it, so if you don't use it, you will end up with a thinnner sauce.

Made his recipe with two boneless skinless chicken breast steaks but the same amount of sauce suggested. It was delicious and incredibly easy. The polenta suggested as a side dish was superb!

My husband and most of all my kids loved this. I used portabellas mushroom sliced large and left out the peppers (no one will eat these). My husband took it to work the next day and every complemented him on how good it looked.

This was an easy recipe but lacked interesting flavor. I added the spaghetti packet and some left over pizza sauce for zip. May be better the next day.

This was good and pretty easy. I used half portobellos and half regular mushrooms and bought them already sliced, which was much easier. I also used 2 cans tomato paste and fresh rosemary and basil instead of the spaghetti sauce mix, and I skipped the saute part also. I added more white wine and it was really good. I'd definitely make it again.

Delicious! I wasn't sure about the spaghetti sauce mix at first...but it adds great flavor with the wine and mushrooms. A family favorite.

I followed other reviewers and modified the recipe. I used fresh basil, thyme, rosemary and sage. I added zucchini, 2 cans of tomato paste and I skipped the saute step. I cooked it for an hour in the oven. I also grated some asiago cheese and sprinkled it on top just before serving. My husband loved it and took it for lunch a day later.

Very yummy. I used the spaghetti sauce packet as directed, but it would have been better with the tomato paste and herbs other reviewers had suggested. I also used boneless/skinless chicken breasts. It got a little overdone so I believe I'll skip the stove-top step next time. Still, this one is definately a keeper.

Rating: 3
I also used boneless, skinless breasts, browned in a skillet before I cooked it in a slow-cooker crockpot with the sauce. (It was too hot for the oven that day.) I admit I used my own polenta recipe that I love. I think a lot depends on the spices (I used my own italian mix) and on reducing the sauce. Next time I will slice the breasts horizontally so they will be thinner.

not difficult to make, but had just a little more taste than plain roasted chicken. The flavors did not meld together---sauce was too thin. I wouldn't waste time to make it again.

This dish is a winner, I added more mushrooms and garlic and italian seasoning as my family likes things very spicy. I am serving it all the time for company. Delish! DElish!

I served this at a dinner party and it was a hit. I followed the recipe for the most part except added some oregano. I'm not a big fan of polenta, so served it with rice pilaf. I will make it again most definitely.

This dish was absolutely wonderful! I changed a few things by using boneless instead of bone-in chicken and I used a mixture of tomato paste and your typical Italian seasonings instead of the packaged sauce mix. Next time I'd probably pound out the chicken a little, but even w/o doing that, the dish turned out wonderfully. I served it with risotto instead of polenta and grilled asparagus. This one is definitely a keeper!

I've made this a few times .. my picky family seems to like it , I always serve it with the creamy parmesan polinta another family favorite .. It seems that i always have the makes to this in the house so it is a great thing to put together when i can't think of anything else !

I didn't have a red pepper so I left it out. I used my own spices (heavy on thyme), tomato paste and brown sugar instead of a packet. It was delicious. Sauce was watery, but polenta soaked it up very well. DEFINITELY try that polenta! YUM.

Rating: 3
This was delicious, but I took the advice of the others - I added garlic slices, zucchini anD fresh tomatoes, 1TB Italian seasoning and some tomato paste and also only used 1/2 cup each of wine and stock. It was still rather watery, next time I would add more tomato paste and make cook down liquid more before the oven. But still very good !! TRY IT - YOU WILL LIKE IT :-)

I made exactly as directions indicated. I am very sorry that I did not use boneless, skinless chicken breasts as the sauce was thinned out by excess fat, which was difficult for me to remove. On the positive side, the presentation was beautiful. I just feel it lacked enough flavor. If made again I would use some suggestions from previous reviewers such as some garlic, additional spices, and cheese like fresh parmesan.

Simple ingredients, but very tasty and very easy to prepare. I mixed the spices with a small can of tomato paste - other than that I didn't change anything. The polenta is a wonderful accompaniment. I let it set in a loaf pan and just sliced it. Reheats well in the microwave. Will definitely make this again.

All my frens loved it and we cooked it twice! But I substituted the spaghetti sauce seasoning mix with tomatee puree, added a whole lot more vegetables like zucchini and quartered tomatoes. It was excellent.

I substituted tomato paste and herbs for the package but had to thicken the sauce with cornstarch as it was a bit watery. Was great! Tried the polenta for the first time in my life. Loved it! Served sauce over the polenta and it was a big hit.

Very tasty and fool proof! I'm constantly on the search for recipes that are quick for me to make, easy and can be assembled in stages for my sisters who are on the go! I only made the dish for four and accidentally used all the same liquid measurements... WHOOPS! So I just thickened the sauce and served it with the polenta. It was hailed as the best thing I've made from epicurious.

I think this is one of our new family favourites! I used chicken thighs as it's all I had on hand, and used more chicken broth instead of wine. Thanks to the reviewer who suggested tomato paste and herbs instead of the spagetti sauce mix. I also made the polenta (with 2% milk) and thought it was a wonderful side dish.

I chose this recipe only because I had on hand (for a change)absolutely every ingredient it called for! However, I'm glad I did. It was easy, quick, and my husband the chicken hater thought it was REALLY good. I too added 3 cloves fresh garlic to the vegs. & was skeptical of the packaged sauce but used it and thought it was ok. It turned the bottom of the chicken pieces a weird red color however. I think you could sub Italian herbs, a can of Italian tomatoes w/ juice and 2 TB tomato paste for the pkg sauce, cut the broth in half and it would be just as good or better. I served this over fresh Asian noodles which sopped up the sauce beautifully. 2+ meals for our family of 3.

My husband said "perrfect and not too winey." The packaged spaghetti sauce sounded terrible so I substituted 2 tbsp of tomatoe paste, 2 tsp of dried basil, 2 tsp oregano, 1 tsp thyme, and a pinch of marjoram. It wasn't any more trouble and tasted delicious.

Easy and quick to prepare. We left out the onion (can't have it) and had it over rice. Very good meal.

I feel like I'm cheating by using a prepackaged sauce mix ;) But this dish certainly is delicious and easy to make! BTW, the sauce is quite thick when you pour it over the chicken, but becomes much more liquidy after you bake it. For the reviewer who wasn't sure what spaghetti sauce mix was, the one I used contained sugar, salt, onion, paprika, mushroom, basil, oregano, black pepper, garlic, parsley, et al. Also, I tried the polenta recipe, which turned out just about as well as polenta probably can. Still, I haven't become a cornmeal convert; I'll stick to bow-tie pasta.

Made this meal tonight and loved it. Tried the Pollenta with it, but would rather have had it over Bow Tie Pasta.

I made this last night with modifications for friends. I used boneless, skinless breasts and browned them with cooking spray. I made the mushroom sauce by the recipe except I used a combination of white mushrooms and Baby Bellas, added fresh garlic and didn't use the spag. sauce mix (I don't even know what that is). Instead I added fresh basil, sage, rosemary and thyme right before pouring the mushrooms sauce on the chicken. I grated some asiago cheese on top. It was outstanding. The polenta was so tasty and perfect with it. I will definitely make this again. The leftovers were great for lunch.

didn't follow the rules, just the general jist of the recipe. I also added some cheese too. I made it for four friends and it was great because I just put the whole thing in the oven and left it to cook, leaving me free to chat.

We liked this, but didn't love it. If I were to make it again I would definately use boneless skinless chicken. The sauce was good. Nothing to write home about. I ended up throwing the leftovers away because they didn't get eaten.

As a new bride, I am finding your site very useful. My husband and I enjoyed this dish. I couldn't find the seasoning mix so I just made my own herb mixture and it came out great! I also used boneless, skinless chicken breast. I'll make this again...probably once or twice a month.

I did use some cavenders seasoning on the chicken breasts before browning. My husband ravedabout this dish.

This was great! I made a few changes - first, I used boneless, skinless breasts (all I had on hand); I still browned them for 3 minutes/side, but then baked them for about 25 minutes total, uncovered. Also I added a big handful of fresh parmesan (grated)sprinkled over the whole pan. I used mostly chicken broth and only about 1/4 c. wine, because my 2 and 4 year olds don't care for wine sauces. Served it with bowtie pasta, fresh bread, and a tossed salad. A definite keeper!

great dish, put a three cheese blend on the last 20 minites of cooking.very tasty.

The chicken was tender and moist, we had some friends over, and decided to experiment. I used my own mixture of seasoning instead of buying a package. (we're all garlic and fresh cracked pepper freaks). We serve a crisp tossed salad and some fresh crusty bread to "mop up" the juices.
