I shamefully admit to being another who did not follow the recipe as written but is nevertheless logging on to review (pecans instead of walnuts, like frbuchanan due to "inventory snafu," and cilantro instead of parsley cause my sweet DH brought home the wrong thing) but like everybody has said this stuff is really, really good. Served with butternut squash polenta (also from this site) to celebrate unseasonable cool snap before we return to the hellish Dixie summer. So good.

Great easy week night meal. The sundried tomato butter was almost too good - I caught a guest eating a spoon full or two of it...

The recipe is delicious! I used the leftover sundried tomato butter on pasta, chicken and even a hamburger. It's good on everything. Definitely a keeper. The only change I made was to use less cayenne as I don't like real spicy dishes.

I am not a good cook, and I was trying to pull a rabit out of a hat for my girlfriend for Valentine's Day, and this recipe made it happen. It was quick, easy, and delicious. We've made lamb chops 2 or 3 times with only mediocre success, but this atempt was a grand slam. I used almonds instead of walnuts due to an inventory snafu, but it didn't matter.

Lodry day, this is good. Made with basil because I had it, instead of parsley and was still great. Have had it on lamb and pork chops both and folks were raving. A keeper!

I agree with other reviewers about the tomato butter and can't wait to try it on other things! I was distracted by a phone call while adding the spices to the food processor and used cumin instead of coriander, then went back and added the appropriate amount of coriander when I realized my mistake. It worked just fine and tasted great, so I thought I'd pass this on to any cumin lovers out there!

The sundried tomato butter made a lot for my house so a couple days later I tossed it with some chicken and pasta for my sauce...it was so delicious. Great recipe.

The tomato butter alone is worth your time. I've used it on beef and salmon too. Like candy!!

This is great! You can save a step by mincing the garlic together with the salt in the food processor. My husband and I both enjoyed this twist on "regular" lamb chops.

This was quite good. I did substitute pecans for the walnuts since we prefer them. The end result was delicious.

This was great! I made the butter a day before and followed the recipe exactly. It was my first time making lambchops and I was delighted with how they turned out.

I made this for Easter dinner yesterday and it was fantastic. The tomato butter is divine and truly can go on anything! Followed recipe almost as written, only leaving out the ground coriander. Served with asparagus with a crunchy hazelnut/breadcrumb topping and orzo with spring veggies. Also made Lydia Bastianich's Limoncello Tiramisu for an excellent finish.

Made this for Easter dinner yesterday and it was fantastic! Very easy to make and the butter is wonderful--it could go on anything! Made as written, only left out the ground coriander as I don't care for it. Served it with asparagus with crunchy hazelnut/breadcrumb topping and orzo with roasted veggies. Also made Lydia Bastianich's Limoncello Tiramisu for dessert--also delicious.

I agree with the editors: the sun-dried tomato butter was incredible! Made it earlier in the day in order for the flavors to meld. Grilled the lamb chops and served with roasted asparagus and porcini risotto. Fabulous!
