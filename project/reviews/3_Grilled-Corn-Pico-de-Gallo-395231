Made the recipe more or less as written, and it's a keeper. The roasted corn makes a great addition to pico de gallo. I cut the corn off the cob before I roasted it in a dry cast iron skillet--worked perfectly. Tomatillos will be a good add next time.

I have to ask the same question as the first review... where's the corn and apples? Could they re-post this before cinco de mayo with the correct recipies?

I think that there's something wrong here. The ingredients do not include grilled corn, apples or roasted tomatillos.
