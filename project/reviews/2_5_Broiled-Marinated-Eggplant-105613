I loved this recipe. I cut the slices thin as directed - yes it made a lot - and did not salt or drain the slices. I broiled them on a roasting pan, so any excess liquid dripped through. Next time I might use a little less red pepper and low sodium soy sauce, but I will definitely make it again.

I looked at the recommendations from the reviews. I cut my eggplant into large chunks, salted it with sea salt about a half hour prior to marinating. I then marinated it per the recipe and broiled. It was amazing. It would make an excellent side dish for any meal.

This recipe is bomb. I feel sorry for those reviewers who did not find this to be a great way to prepare eggplant. It is important to pay attention to the two reviewers who identified two errors in the recipe. The eggplant slices are 1/2 inch thick not 1/8th ast written and you must salt and drain the eggplant for at least 30 minutes before broiling. I served this with the Pork Tenderloin with Mango Chutney on this site from Bon Appetit 1999. Wonderful melding of flavors on one plate.

rather than slice the eggplant, i just cut into chunks. the marinade was incredible and could be used for chicken. My boyfriend even loved it!

I was confued by the reviews of this recipe becasue I have made it many times and served it with the salmon burgers with spinach and ginger. It is a perfect combination. I noticed that there was a typing error in the online recipe. The eggplant is to be slice 1/2 inch thick not 1/8 inch.

I wish I read these reviews before preparing the eggplant. I had to revisit this site b/c I was confused with the number of slices I got...try 30! Sure enough the recipe did in fact say to cut them that thin and yet only get 8. Then I read the reviews and don;t think the recipe is even worth a shot! Now I have a batch of paper thin slices of eggplant marinating and no idea what to do with them to salvage them from this seemingly disasterous recipe.

This recipe is MISSING a key step for ANY recipe using Eggplant! You MUST first cut/slice the eggplant, then salt the eggplant for a minimum of 30 minutes, then rinse off the salt. This gets rid of the eggplant bitterness. I think the author made the mistake of assuming that everyone knows this!

Thank you, everybody, for saving me from the utter disaster of giving an eggplant recipe to my boyfriend's perfectionist mother, and having it turn out so heinously. For this reason, I love this website.

I concur! This was awful! This recipe should be disbarred from this website.

This was a horrible, horrible, horrible mistake for a recipe. I followed the recipe to the letter. My results: A salty, chard, mushy, and mostly untouched by my dinner guests, side-dish. I find it hard to believe that anyone would ever prepare this dish for a second time.

I agree. You would have to have a very large baking dish or keep rotating them in and out of the oven. More marinade and smaller slices. I will stick to grilled eggplant. This was awful

I had to throw the whole thing away. It was the worst eggplant recipe I had ever tried.

I have little experience handling eggplant, so I followed the recipe to the letter. The result was almost a complete disaster. The soy sauce taste was the only distinct one I could detect. Where was the eggplant?

First of all, it is impossible to get 8 1/8 in. slices from a medium eggplant. Mine were cut 1/4-1/2in. and I got 10. I doubled all the ingredients in the sauce,added 1Tb olive oil & marinated for 3 hours and still didn't get much flavor even with basting. Perhaps if I cut them smaller they would have absorbed more flavor. But they were good on a sandwich w/ mozzarella and roasted peppers.
