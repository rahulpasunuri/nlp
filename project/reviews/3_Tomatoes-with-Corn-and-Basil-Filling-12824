I made this and brought it to a dinner this weekend and everyone thought it was very good! Really nice to go along with a barbeque. I would definitely make it again.

i really enjoyed this dish, my husband not so much.i did use cherry tomatoes cut in half and let it sit with the corn in the dressing for a couple of hours, then added the basil and bread at the last minute.i would make it again.

If I could give this recipe 0 forks I would. The stuffing was great but the raw tomotoes were off-putting. Half my guests didn't even try them and one only ate the stuffing and not the tomato. Once you eat the stuffing you are just left eating a raw, undressed tomato. It would be much better with the tomato diced with the stuffing and with more vinegar, oil and herbs and served on a lettuce leaf.

Excellent, with modifications: saute bread cubes in 2 T butter, remove to bowl; brown 1 can of green giant vacuum packed white corn in drippings in same pan, scraping up and letting get a little dark; sprinkle generously w/salt, pepper, garlic, basil (dried is fine), and onion powder, then deglaze pan w/red wine vinegar and remove to same bowl; saute more scallions (about 3) in same pan w/extra 1 T butter, add more red wine vinegar and 1 T tomato paste, then remove to same bowl; add to bowl the chopped-up insides (cores discarded) of the tomatoes, and season to taste, then stuff. Serve room temp. Lovely presentation, very tasty.

Delicious summertime accompaniment to grilled fish, meat, or poultry. I made 3 hours ahead and served room temperature. Basil flavor was great. I tried heating one for a hot side dish and the basil was not as pronounced but it was still tasty. This would also work if you diced the tomato and served the whole thing on a lettuce leaf.

THE BEST!! Everyone raved about it. I used French bread for the croutons. And I added about 1/2 cup of Romano cheese to the corn mixture. SUPERB! By far the hit of the night! Make sure your tomatoes are fresh and big. I only had small ones and it was more difficult to stuff but still tasted GREAT!
