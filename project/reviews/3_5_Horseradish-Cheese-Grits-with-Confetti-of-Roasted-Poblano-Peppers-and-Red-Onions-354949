First time cooking grits; they weren't quite cooked so will need to work on that. I thought the flavor of the dish was quite good; hubby didn't care for it.

I mean "poblano." Sorry.

This would be absolutely delicious, but it calls for WAY too much cheese. I added exactly 3/4 cup and it turned my heretofore perfect grits into a glob of congealed fat. I had to make more plain grits at the last minute and then add them to these just to make them edible. After that was done, they were glorious. The flavors are wonderful together; I think the horseradish and pablano really shine. By the way, a touch of buttermilk and about a third of the cheese and these grits are heaven.

I made this just as printed, except that I used quick grits, which were fine. Very good flavor, very easy. The horseradish is a nice addition.

These were amazing. I used old fashioned grits, which didn't take very long to cook. The horseradish flavor was very subtle, I may add more the next time I make this.
