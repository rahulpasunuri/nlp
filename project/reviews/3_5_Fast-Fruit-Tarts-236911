So easy...Maybe it's best to just treat these like a canvas...making them your own by choosing any of the great ideas below and using the freshest berries. Occurred to me after makig these that maybe some crumbled amaretto cookies, perhaps even a tiny droplet of vanilla, not to mention lovely creams and ices, could have given these a rocket launch.

Just as easy as promised. I added a little nutmeg and a dash of cloves to the mix, just dusted on the top. They're not PERFECT, but they're tasty and quick which means they're perfect for everyday life. They might not be the most elaborate or delicately presented, but there's a good chance your friends will be impressed anyway. :)

Every bit as fast and easy as promised! I used Pepperidge Farm Puff Pastry which worked perfectly, but I also added a little bit of cinnamon and nutmeg to each tart along with the sugar. I found them to be just a little bit on the bland side and thought they definitely could have used the caramel sauce recommended. However, they were cool when I tried one and I am convinced they'd be far better hot! All in all, good recipe!

I got great reviews, BUT some disclaimers: I couldn't find 10x14 frozen pastry, and the size wasn't indicated on the box. Make sure you don't let the pastry defrost for too long or it will be impossible to unroll. Also, since my pastry wasn't 10x14, the amount of blueberries lead to a huge (delicious) mess. I recommend putting fewer blueberries on each pastry and leaving enough room on the outside for crust. But no matter how it looked, it tasted great!

I used phyllo dough ( I picked up the wrong package) and it was ok. But the blueberries were great!! I will try this again with the right dough.

this recipe was so easy, I have enjoyed it several times during summer berry season and have shared it with friends. I used the frozen ready to bake pepperidge farm phylo pastry cups and it was even simpler!

These are a lot of fun! I use different types of cookie cutters to cut the dough with depending on the occasion (hearts for Valentine's, stars for winter, turkey for Thanksgiving, etc.).

These were fabulous! To make it even easier, look for frozen 5"x5" puff pastry squares at a middle eastern market. Split in half makes the perfect size dessert. Thanks for the versatile recipe!

I am not much of a baker (my sister got those genes) and I appreciate the ease of this recipe and it really is impressive looking! It stood up to my New Year's eve dinner that I made.
