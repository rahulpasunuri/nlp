Fail. Not worth the effort and certainly not a replacement for pumpkin pie. Cooking all the parts separately and reducing the syrup is a total waste of time. Shouldn't even be considered dessert...way too healthy tasting. This is something I would maybe like on top of some greek yogurt for breakfast. If you cut out the butter, the topping is pretty much made the same exact way I make granola.
