...used olive oil instead of bacon. I also sauteed a few cloves of minced garlic and onion. Then added a little lemon at the end. My family loved it!

I am so excited that I now have a fast collard green recipe! I did add some lemon juice at the end based on the reviews. It was fast, easy, and really good!

I don't use non-stick cookware, so cooked the bacon in a bit of olive oil and drained off all but 2 teaspoons of the fat. It needed a little something so I added 1/4 tsp of chili flakes, 1 clove of garlic and the juice of half a lemon before serving cold as a salad. Delish!

i wanted to like this so much, i was really excited for it but it was on the bitter side. and it just didn't wow. the bitterness was not a huge problem but it was just not that appetizing. my collards were very fresh, just picked a few days back from a local farm. too bad

I've made this for years...didn't know it had a special name :) I lightly toast a little garlic in a bit of the bacon renderings before adding the greens. My kids adore this dish too, we use 3 or more bunches of collards just to get enough. Yum!

Simple and tasty take on collards. Adding citrus before serving makes a difference.

Same as many others, we have a CSA with a bunch of collard greens. I also made this with chicken sausage instead of bacon and it is delicious! just a little lime juice or lemon juice at the end really makes a difference in brightening up the flavor!

Like other people here, we get a lot of collards from our CSA. This is not only our favorite recipe i have found for collards, but it's the easiest. the thin slicing of the collards and the lime really cut the bitterness.

Delicious, although amended recipe slightly. We used chicken sausage in place of bacon (about 2 1/2 links) crumbled and drained of fat. Sauteed thinly sliced shallots and a few cloves of minced garlic in a separate pan. Added a little bit of healthier olive oil back to pan, sausage, shallots, garlic, and then followed remainder of recipe.

We also got collard greens in our CSA box - having never cooked them before, we decided to try this recipe and it came out delicious!

This is delicious and so simple to prepare, after you get through the rather tedious rolling and slicing of the collards. I prefer this recipe to the overly salty, boiled collards that seem to be the norm. The bright green color is so beautiful.

as everyone said, delicious and SUPER FAST. I used canadian bacon, which was less fatty, so I added olive oil. also, liberal lemon & salt.

I got collard greens as part of my farm share and had no idea what to do with them. This recipe seemed simple and got good reviews so I tried it. They were delicious...and very easy. An hour after dinner my husband is saying how he wishes there were more of them. And he is not a vegetable person! I will definitely make this again.

Don't waste time cooking collard greens to death when you can saute them for a minute or two (with bacon!!) and have them retain their tangy bite, gorgeous green color, and crisp texture. We added one clove of thinly sliced garlic and a bit of onion while we cooked the bacon to add some additional layers of flavor. And yes, make sure you cut the greens thin like angel hair pasta and you won't be disappointed. Served it alongside a filet of halibut and it was marvelous. Quick and delicious.

Such an easy and fast addition to any meal. I have redone this recipe many times since I first discovered it, and I have yet to think of a way to change it or make it better. It is especially good with fish fry, Cajun cuisine, and with other Southern dishes.

Thank you Wolfin36! I get fresh produce and fruit delivered from Full Circle Farms each week and I always get some sort of vegetable that I don't know what to do with. This week I got collard greens and found this recipe. I also had some turnips on hand and made this exactly like Wolfin36. I did drain most of the bacon grease before adding the greens and it just turned out perfectly. Delicious - it was so satisfying, this was all I ate for dinner!! Highly recommended. Nice crisp greens and the salt of the crispy bacon and the turnips. Delicious.

Finally a recipe for collard greens that is good. I've avoided them for so long because I've never found a way to cook them that was edible. This is really delicious.

Wow....raves all around at a formal dinner. Being my husband to be is from the south, as well as the couple we had for dinner, they all didn't understand this way to have Collards, but soon were raving how wonderful they were. Different than the mushy all day cooked Collards, but excellent tasting, and more like a salad.

Wow I found a new collard recipe. I have cooked collards/turnip greens for years but always with a few turnips and boiled them first then added the greens only until they wilted since I like my veggies crispy. This time I looked for something different and found it in this recipe. I pity the people with their over cooked mushy collards and I've had them. I used the instructions for this receipe but I bought a pound of bacon bits and trimmed the fat off and rendered it then discarded the fat and sauteed the meat until done. I also love turnips so I used one large turnip and sliced it thin into small slices and cooked it until just done with the bacon. If you have people in your family who turn up their nose at the word TURNIP, they will think they are eating potatoes,(mine do). After the bacon and turnips are done to my liking I added a little white wine, stir fried the sliced collards mixed with turnip greens until just wilted. I also added some pepper flakes along with garlic powder, salt and pepper. Very good and healthy.

These are the first collards I've ever liked. Being a vegetarian, I try to eat a wide variety of vegetables, but always passed up the collard greens at my great local produce market (Josh's Organic at Hollywood Blvd. and the beach boardwalk only on Sundays, in Hollywood, Florida). I cut rolled them and cut them about 1/8" then sauteed them briefly with olive oil. Seasoned them with sea salt and bottled key lime juice since I didn't haven't any fresh lemon. AWESOME.

I added a teaspoon of Tobasco and a dash of red pepper flakes for a truly southern take. This receipt also works well on Turnip Greens!

Modified as follows: 4 strips thick bacon, diced. 1 red pepper, 1/4" x 2" strips. 2/3# collard greens, rolled and cut 3/16" as per original instructions. Fried bacon in sauteuse over high heat. Removed bacon and most of oil. Added red pepper strips and sauteed until softened. Removed. Added cut collard greens. Sauteed 2 - 2 1/2 minutes. Added back bacon and red pepper strips. Added generous grind black pepper and a whiff of balsamic vinegar. Tossed. Served as accompaniment to original recipe black bean/Columbian chorizo sausage soup. Wine was inexpensive Spanish Tempranillo. Modestly acknowledged the applause.

Very easy to make. This is by far the best way to make collard greens, very light but full of flavor.

Simply perfect! I made this to accompany a feast of oven barbecued ribs, sour cream mashed potatoes and cornbread. My husband the carnivore said these greens were his favorite part of the meal! I drained off most of the bacon fat before adding the greens and sauteed them a little longer (maybe 5 minutes) until they were wilted. Next time I will add a dash of dried chile flakes while sauteing the bacon for a bit of extra kick. A real keeper!

I've never had collard greens before, but as they showed up in my produce delivery this week, thought I'd give them a try. This was fantastic! I served it with pork chops and the beet w/ goat cheese and pistachio recipee from this site. Collard greens will be a staple around here from now on.

Wow! I've always loved collard greens and this dish reminded me why. I hate to say it, but these are better than any slow-cooked Southern greens I've had and I'm from the South! This dish is perfect as is, needs no substitutions or additions. I served this with the rosemary-garlic pork rib roast also on this site for a New Year's meal. :)

This is an astonishing recipe. I made it with collards that had grown large in my fall garden, been gnawed by flea beetles, and then wilted a bit in the fridge. Even so, it was wonderful. I removed the ribs and sliced the collards very thin, as suggested below--1/8 inch--and used only olive oil (no bacon), a dash of sea salt and a squirt of lemon. It may be the best vegetable dish I've ever had. My husband and I ate the whole batch (4 servings) in one meal. I'm trying to think of ways to use collards cooked like this: perhaps on pasta tossed with onion or garlic that has been cooked with pancetta, adding the cooked collards added at the very end?

I made this recipe to use fresh collard greens from my winter garden, and to try something different. It was good! I understand the desire to cut calories and fat but I wouldn't substitute turkey bacon. The bacon fat adds a nice flavor to the dish.

Yum. These were simply fantastic and really quick to prepare. The Brazilian in our household approved as well.

Ok - So I had never made Collard Greens - But I bought these large leaves and wanted a vegetarian way of cooking them. I tried one users suggestion of garlic, onions, and oil and it turned out ok. The greens were a little bitter, so I added my standard spices - cayenne, salt, pepper and the Lemon Juice balanced out the bitterness beautifully. However, I would still like to explore these greens but I just want a veggie recipe that adds a little oomph... I will keep looking... or just get creative!

This is exactly the way my mother used to prepare not only collard greens but also chicory, kale, and spinach, not to speak of a few other kinds of greens I can't find in the US and don't even have English names as far as I know. In any case, I rarely use bacon when cooking these days, so I saute finely chopped onions and garlic in just a little oil instead. My only remark? Please spell the name of the dish correctly - it's MINEIRA, not miniera...

I'm from the South: home of overcooked, delicious greens, which my family hates. This is the first time they've ever liked collards. For this reason alone, I'll make it again and again. Very easy way to get some leafy greens into kids' diets.

This was my first attempt at making collard greens. As a Southerner, my mom was skeptical when I told her I'd found a quick recipe. My husband and I really enjoyed it. It is a simple, delicious recipe that we'll definitely make again! I used turkey bacon instead of pork.

Used olive oil instead of bacon fat, and started with slivered garlic and red pepper flakes, but followed the method,and it was perfect. Really beats 20 minutes of boiling.

I was suspicious about cooking collards for so short a time. In fact, I cooked them a litle longer, probably 4-5 minutes, but they were still delicious. I used olive oil, becauwe one guest was a vegetarian, and then sprinkled the other servings with crispy bits of bacon. Delicious. Not one bite was left.

It is a very good dish, from my state in Brazil, Minas Gerais. Hence à MINEIRA... but I would suggest the reader sautée the greens in olive oil instead of the fat from the bacon. It is light and healtier. The lime as suggested by another reader is a must.Try also adding sliced oranges as side dish. (Mixed with a good recipe of rice and beans and banana)...as we say in Brazil, bom apetite!

While this is a little tedious to prepare, it cooks in a flash and is very tasty. I am curently on weight watchers and have varied the recipe by omitting the bacon and adding sauteed onion and this works. well.

A correction: the name is supposed to be mineira, not miniera. It refers to a region in Brasil (yes, with an S) called Minas Gerais. Someone or something that comes from Minas, such as this recipe, is called mineiro(a). Collard greens mineira (couve à mineira) is a typical side dish for feijoada. Definitely worth trying.

I learned a variation of this recipe from my Brazilian mother-in-law a decade ago. Instead of bacon, she makes the collards with lots of minced garlic. I'll be anxious to try it this way, too.

For some reason unbeknownst to me, I decided to plant some collard greens in our deck garden a few months ago. They quickly thrived and started to crowd some of the other plants in the large planter box. When I read this recipe it seemed timely to harvest some of the greens and try this Brazilian dish. I now know that it was truly fate that had me plant the collard greens as this is another recipe that is so simple and so good. The recipe is awesome. I will always maintain a few collard greens in the garden so we can make this again and again. I noticed a mistake in the recipe online compared to the magazine. The collard greens should be sliced no thicker than 1/8 inch not the 3/4 as shown online. I also used leaves that were about 6 inches across which is probably a little smaller than what is commonly found in the produce market.
