I used the HP bbq sauce and cilantro and I roasted the bell peppers. It was too sweet. Next time I will use a pizza tomato sauce instead of bbq sauce.

I have made this pizza countless times with the following changes: I use Sweet Baby Ray's sauce, use a red onion rather than a yellow, roast the red peppers, sub monterey jack for the mozz cheese and delete the green peppers and pine nuts. My family would rather have this pizza than a purchased one.

Very easy and quick. You can cook the chicken and combine with BBQ sauce and chop the vegetables well in advance. it makes assembly and cooking time short. I added many more vegetables for extra crunch... great week night dinner!

Good pizza - however, for the price of the ingredients (nearly $15) you can call delivery - or pop in Digiorno - for a lesser price. Used Gates BBQ sauce, a family favorite.

Yummy, easy, and attractive. Used Rhodes frozen bread dough for crust, toasted the pine nuts, and chopped fresh oregano. Would be a great appetizer.

I made this for my rommates and we all enjoyed. I was in a hurry and could not find the sun dried tomatoes, and I am sure that would have made it better. But I will try it again. ALso, the Boboli crust was delicious!!

This was quite good, quick, and a great pantry meal. First time using a Boboli...not bad. I made a few minor changes: small diced the green pepper, used jarred roasted red peppers instead of raw red, and used Monterey Jack instead of mozzarella---that's what I had on hand. Hubby loved it and a good way to use up the humongus (sp?) bottle of BBQ sauce I bought at Sam's Club!!!

Very good. I used Stubb's spicy barbecue sauce, a red onion, asadero cheese, fresh cilantro instead of oregano, and skipped the pine nuts. It tasted exactly like I thought it would. I'd make it again for friends at college.

This is a great recipe! I have made it several times and the best barbecue sauce to use is Lea and Perrins barbecue sauce.

What a unique combination of flavors - - very satisfying to the tastebuds. Made for a neighborhood get together as a first course, everyone raved about it. Difficult to cut small portions; better served as a light meal.
