I used this recipe for my New Year's helping of black-eyed peas with a few tweaks. I used butternut squash (easier to find) and skipped the tomatoes (the fiance hates them). For the dressing, olive oil and lime juice alone sounded...boring, so I added some cider vinegar, allspice, cinnamon and garlic powder to make a sort of Caribbean vinaigrette. Tasty! Overall I enjoyed this and would definitely make it again, but with one more tweak: fewer onions. WAY too onion-y for my taste, especially raw onions.

I really wanted to like this salad, but in the end it just didn't taste like much of anything. I took others' suggestions and added extra lime juice, cilantro, sugar, some cumin and a bit of mustard to the dressing. I thought it tasted great when I first whipped up the dressing, but once it sat with the peas and all for an hour all the flavor seemed to get muted and dull. Not terrible, just not really worth bothering with.

I made this for a party and everyone loved it. I took one reviewer's suggestion of more garlic, salt and pepper, and I think it was perfect. People complain about it being dull, but I think the simplicity allows you to really taste the different elements of the salad.

Expected this to be boring, but it wasn't at all. I used butternut squash as I prefer it over pumpkin. We really enjoyed this and will make it often.

I wouldn't make this again. I've made a similar dish with bulgar wheat that would work well with the pumpkin. I also used extra lime, cumin, cilantro, garlic, edamame, and roasted corn. The pumkin took a long time to cook this way. Will cook the pumpkin some other way next time. The peas just don't absorb the flavors, and the onions in the lime juice starts to pickle--yuk.

I changed the oil/lime dressing to improve taste. In a blender: onion, sugar, cider vinegar, olive oil, and mustard and some lime juice. This was huge hit with my in-laws, who had never had a bean salad, but I think the recipe as written would have been a little bland.

very good with butternut squash. always looking for a filling and healthy entree salad. subbed edamame for the bell pepper. the roasted squash was delicious!

I have made this dish twice now, using the butternut squash. I altered it twice though - I used a can of smoked black eyed peas instead of cooking my own (YUM!) and added more garlic, plenty of sea salt and fresh ground pepper. this was a big hit at both parties I took it to and i plan to make it again for a party tomorrow night - a fail-safe recipe.

Although a very good combination, I found the recipe as-is to be lacking in depth. Here are some suggestion. Add more citrus juice (lime, lemon and/or orange). Definitely add salt. Add fresh ground pepper. Add ground cumin. Add cilantro. Add some hot pepper sauce.

I'm really being cautious of what and how much I eat and was looking for recipes that were tasty AND healthy...this salad is absolutely delicious! I marinated and seared some tofu and served that on top of the salad...the combo was excellent...I'll definitely be making this dish many more times!

I was surprised at the luke-warm review of the other two people. I made several of the Caribbean recipes from this particular issue of Bon Appetit, and this was by far the most unusual and successful. I did use the squash instead of the pumpkin. I'm actually making it again for a party this weekend!

I believe this recipe has a lot of potential....with just a little tweaking. I added garlic (minced) to the dressing and juice of two limes and additional oil, salt and pepper. And to the salad, I added shelled edemames (they came in a bag from the frozen section, shelled and required only 5 minutes of boiling)I served to friends at a party and they loved it!!!

I wouldn't make this again. It was just too bland. Even after sitting in the fridge for a night the flavors didn't improve.
