My husband made this and because we like garlic he used 5 cloves and then put in some fresh cut up aspargus with about 1/4 cup of whipping cream. It was delicious and we made it for some guests and they loved it, had to share the recipe with them.

I added a tablespoon of capers as well as extra garlic, few pinches of hot pepper flakes, and twice the wine. Used only 2 T butter - no oil. (Actually, I couldn't figure out where the oil is supposed to be used.) LOVED IT! The capers made it for me.

I double the garlic and the green onions. I use only 3 tbsp butter, not 4 and no olive oil. I add a cup on chicken broth mixed with a spoon of cornstarch at the end for extra "sauce" to coat the pasta. I serve it with angel hair and my 3 year old LOVES it. My husband says shrinp has too much cholesterol but we love this dish.

I bought wonderful, large shrimp and after eating this had wished I had simply made my fabulous Shrimp Scampi. Not nearly enough garlic, which I doubled! Only OK, and a waste of great ingredients.

This is a really easy and delicious recipe. I don't always have white wine on hand, so I sub in chicken broth and it works just fine. Using more liquid that is called for gives it a nice broth and makes it easier to store (the orzo doesn't dry out when reheating). Following a previous review, we added the snow peas and served over baby spinach. Very light, very pretty dish!

This was such an easy and delicous recipe. The sauce was yummy and the orzo a simple accompaniment. I will make it again next time I'm in the mood for scampi.

Tasted like it was missing something. If I made it again I would add some stock, lemon, and more garlic, maybe even red pepper flakes. I found this recipe very disappointing.

Doubled the orzo and garlic, used only 1 T butter, added tomatoes, lemon juice and parsley at the end, and served it on top of the recommended bed of spinach. Delicious and easy.

Fabulous. It was only me eating, so I had it with 7 jumbo tiger shrimp, used unsalted butter and reduced everything by half. I think that the full recipe would be good for two as a main course, also I only had rotini so I used that instead. I will be making this again.

Simple, easy, and delicious. I used a smaller sized shrimp (36-40ct) in the recipe without too much trouble. I probably should have adjusted the cooking time to be shorter for the smaller shrimp, but they still came out OK. I also reduced the amount of butter used to 3 Tbsp and still found the sauce to be too buttery (I never thought I would say that...)

Oh, yes! We'll make this dish again and again. So easy, so tasty. (This is probably the only four forks I've rated.)

My husband & I really enjoyed this. I added the red pepper flakes per a previos reviewer. I also placed about 3 handfuls of baby spinach in the bottom of the bowl prior to adding the just drained orzo, making sure to cover all of the spinach so that the heat would wilt it. Then I added the shrimp mixture on top and mixed it all in. It was a very easy way to add a vegetable -- no additional cooking -- and it made it more colorful to boot!

So good. We threw in some yellow pepper and feta cheese and basil and it was really yummy. We did omit the butter to keep it lo cal ish and served it with a garden salad. Will make again for sure!

This was really good, fast and easy. We used medium shrimp (41/50) rather than large, added red pepper flakes with the garlic, and added some lemon juice, grape tomatoes and chopped basil at the end. We think this recipe serves 3 as a main course, so proportions should be adjusted accordingly. Next time we will put a greek spin on it, and add some feta cheese and fresh oregano in place of the basil.

We loved this recipe, and I think that it will become part of our super-easy weeknight repertoire. We used a pound of shrimp and 8 ounces of pasta, and I think that the proportions worked out well for 2 people as a main course. We cut back on the butter and olive oil because I didn't want to be too much of a fatty, and I think that it was still plenty yummy. We added some peas and the 3 cherry tomatoes that out plant has thus far produced, and I would highly recommend the additions--it made this dish into a full meal.

This was so simple, and yet so good. I used 8 ounces of orzo, and threw in some morel mushrooms. Passed the parmesan at the table. Delicious!

Great recipe. Add a salad for a quick and easy meal. Next time I will add some parsley & lemon zest at the end to brighten it up.

Delicious. I added baby plum tomatoes and Kalamata olives with the green onions. I might try again incorporating saffron as well. If this is the main, then I would say that the portions this recipe produces is more suitable for two people.

a yummy and quick weeknight meal- even the kids gobbled it up. I don't think I'd call it low fat tho...
