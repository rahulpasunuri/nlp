after reading some of the other reviews and the super long recipe, I was sort of scared or trying it, but i did and it wasn't as hard I thought it would be. It was a gorgeous cake and everyone loved it. The raspberry parfait was a little more flavorful than the peach. Also, I lit birthday candles into it, and it started melting immediately, with the raspberries on top falling off

For my first time using a springform pan and also creating anything of this calibur, the cake turned out DELICIOUSLY and was a HUGE HIT! I forgot the butter in the parfait base but it still held together well and tasted just as good as I thought it would. One of the other reviewers is right - the fresher the fruit the tastier the cake. Unfortunately, half my raspberries went bad so I couldn't top the cake. Also, next time I don't think I'll bother with the white chocolate decoration on the side and do something on top. It kept falling off and didn't hold together well. I would definately make this again though!

I made 2 of this cake to serve 20 people and everyone loved it. I think that it was important to let the cakes sit out to get to a more palatable temperature before serving (You can't taste frozen things). I also think the quality of the fruit used is very important. If your peaches or raspberries aren't good, then the parfait wouldn't be very flavorful.

Not sure what I did right (or wrong?) but I had no trouble with this, and it was well received. ALso, it works well for Passover, for a different dairy dessert. Good way to use up maccaroons! I bought maccaroons this year just to make this.

I lost my Bon Appetit that contained this recipe. I'm happy to see this on the web site. I made it with fresh picked local fruit in August. Although time intensive, it was far from bland and very delicious, a crowd pleaser, but time intensive.

I have made this recipe three times, all with rave reviews - however it did require tweaking and tasting. I added about 1/2 cup more each of the pureed peaches and raspberries. I can see how the recipe could be bland if followed as is. The alcohol is a nice touch - but not neccessary. Same for the compote and the white chocolate border.

I stayed up until 1AM the night before a big party at our house making this.Only two guests even tried the parfait cake, and one threw it away after the first bite. I thought the crust was very good, but the layers were somewhat bland and needed to be sweeter. This recipe is just too time-intensive to tinker with again.

I don't think i did this right. When i went to pour my second layer in the 2 ran together. So it was kind of a disaster i didn't even waste time putting on the raspberries because it wouldn't be as pretty. But the layers together tasted good.

I agree with the other review. The crust was very good but the layers were not very tasty and quite bland. It was a very time consuming recipe with below average results. There was so much hype in the magazine about it being "the dessert of the summer" and it was sure a disapointment!

Although the recipe looked promising, the results were just so-so. The macaroon crust was tasty, but the parfait layers lacked depth of flavor. And while the recipe purports to be simple because it does not require an ice cream maker and can be made in advance, it requires a significant amount of time and dirties a significant amount of equipment. Overall, I think that this recipe is more trouble than it's worth. I was not impressed.
