I agree with several previous reviewers who felt the relish overwhelmed the dish. At best, I might try using some lemon as they suggested and less pepper if I make it again. The wine was a waste because I couldn't even taste it over the pepper. I would not add any salt because the olives provide more than enough. It might also be better to grill swordfish rather than saute it.

Amazingly good!! HOLY COW good! :-) Too bad we were using previously frozen swordfish fillets, they did not do this justice. We had to substitute cilantro for the Italian parsley due to lack of time to run to grocer, but the cilantro made for a bit of an Asian taste, very very good in our book. This goes well as a sort of bruschetta topping on whole wheat bread spiced with chinese 5 spice (personal variation, I added 2 tsp chinese 5 spice to my basic whole wheat butter bread recipe...turned out fantastic, especially toasted). This would be great for company!

Excellent and delicious. My husband and I have had this dish several times and I am making it for our New Years Day dinner! He does not like olives so I eliminated the olives and added more pine nuts. This is a keeper!

When one's 10-year old niece and 70-year old dad gobble down your main course and ask for seconds, it deserves four forks. I will try the tip about the lemon to balance the brine because it was a tad salty but this really was delicious, healthy, filling and fairly simple to make.

Used a cast-iron skillet for the swordfish; this worked out very well to brown the fish. Have to agree with reviewer "cculley2" that the relish needed the lemon to balance out the brine of the olives.

I made this recipe for me and my husband and we both loved it so made it again for company and they loved it as well. They even requested the recipe.

I am amazed that people didn't like this recipe! My husband and I loved it and I am passing it along to several friends. We thought the relish added just the right zing to the flavor of the fish. It was easy to make but special enough for guests. Definitely adding it to my collection.

This was okay. It needed a bit of zing that was lacking. Maybe more olives or some lemon juice would help.

Did not love this, the relish totally overwhelmed the fish and that's all I tasted.Would not make again

3.5 forks actually. Very tasty. I used mahi mahi instead. My husband and I are adding this to our fish repertoire.
