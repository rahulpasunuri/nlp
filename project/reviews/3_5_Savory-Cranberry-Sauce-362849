SUPER! I had to substitute a few items, but overall it was a great chutney like dish. I could only get sugared dried cranberries, so omitted the sugar in the recipe and added some extra wine and water. Didn't want to use our good port, so used Cinzano Rosso (sweet red wine) and it was delicious. We used this as a topping for baking turkey cutlets in the oven, with butter. The dish was almost as good as roast turkey with sauce.

I would agree with the other review that this is more a chutney than a sauce. I also didn't have any port so I substituted some pomegranate juice and cut down on the sugar just a bit. It's a very tasty side. I also didn't split the cranberries in half - wasn't necessary, just simmer until they pop.

I used this as a sauce for Swedish meatballs since I didn't have any Lingonberries. This was more of a chutney than a sauce. After it cooled, I added some water and stirred until it was a more sauce-like consistency. I didn't have any port, so I substituted 2 Tbs of Marsala and 2 Tbs of Framboise and it turned out great!
