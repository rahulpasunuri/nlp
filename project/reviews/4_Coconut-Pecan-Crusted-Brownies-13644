Rave! I read about the topping overbrowning, so I baked the brownies plain for 15 minutes, then sprinkled on the topping and baked 15 minutes more. This worked beautifully.

These were just "ok". The brownie was too cakey and not rich enough. I served them at a dinner party and they were not a big hit among a plate of other various bars.

These brownies are amazing. Ive made them several times and I am always delighted with the results. They are a great go-to recipe when you're in the mood to whip up some brownies, but want to make them extra special. I always add a cup of chocolate chips to the topping and cover the brownies with foil for the last 10 minutes or so to keep the topping from burning. Love!

Very good, no changes to recipe. Loved the topping. This is a Keeper -- Will definitely make again.

I made these for Labor Day dinner and they were a hit! I followed the recipe exactly and found the fudgy brownies to have a wonderful flavor. The toasted coconut and pecans are a wonderful and yummy, but not too sweet addition. I followed other reviewers' advice and covered the brownies with foil for the last 15 minutes. My brownies took 40 minutes to fully bake. This one is a keeper! Thanks Gourmet!

These brownies are delicious! I made them yesterday to take to my mom's house on Mother's day and it's taken a lot of willpower not to eat the entire pan. I followed the recipe as written and they turned out beautifully. I took the advice of other reviewers and covered the pan with foil for the first 10 minutes of baking. I ended up baking them for a full 48 minutes instead of the 30-35 minutes indicated. At 30 minutes the centre was still jiggly. I put the foil back on the pan for the last 5 minutes as well just to protect the topping. The end result was a cakey/fudgey brownie with a perfect coconut topping. This one is a keeper.

Absolutely delicious. The crunchy, salty topping is the perfect compliment to the fudgy brownies. My brownies (like one other reviewer) came out cakey on the bottom and fudgy on the top. Delish! I added maybe 1/2 c. mini chocolate chips to the topping and also sprinkled some on the top of the brownie before layering the coconut. The crusty top did get a bit browned, but it was deliciously crunchy and satisfying. Made with almonds and it was fab. Recommended!

These were very good brownies, but not the first day that I made them. After being in the fridge for a day they were great. They came out dry as I think I cooked them to long. I would shorten the cooking time by a few minutes. The topping is also very good.

Another delicious, EZ, cocoa-powder brownie recipe. A bit more cakelike, but still fudgy & dense. (I'm a fan of all kinds of brownies, but I prefer a dense & gooey consistency over the cake-like versions.) Once again, I melted my butter in a pyrex mixing bowl, in the micro (what's with all the "dirtying" of saucepans, all you recipe writers?), then beat in the sugar, vanilla & eggs. Gee, all in a single bowl - what a concept! The topping, although delicious, created an element of mess that I would prefer to avoid in the future, esp when transporting the finished product to a party or picnic. So while I liked the flavor of both layers, I'll most likely forego the topping if I make these again. Unless of course I serve them as a dessert course at home, topped with vanilla ice cream or creme fraiche. Hmmmm ... now there's a good idea ...

These are simply amazing brownies. The best part is that they are extremely easy to make. The brownie part is just the right combination of cakey and rich. A pan never lasts long enough in our house.

Wow, like most of the reviewers, I also consider myself a purist when it comes to brownies. I prefer my mom's recipe (chocolate chips, a little cakey, a dusting of powdered sugar.) But what to do with a half a bag of leftover coconut? I had everything in the house to give these a try, and they're pretty darn good. Kind of like a seven layer bar crossed with a brownie. I did add about a 1/4 cup of semi-sweet chips to the brownie batter, and a few to the topping. And I also felt it needed to cook longer than the 35 minutes suggested. Maybe 45-50 minutes? But I did use an 8X8 pan...regardless, a delicious gooey brownie with a crunchy crust.

I normally don't like things in or on my brownies, but I happened to have the nuts and coconut flakes already, so I gave this recipe a try. I would sit down with a fork and a gallon of milk if I could and just devour the whole pan. Sooooo good!

Absolutely delicious! I've had to make 4 pans of this in the past week just to make sure everyone got a taste. The top is perfectly crunchy in contrast to the moist brownie. I added chocolate chips to the last two batches to everyone's enjoyment.

These are a real treat! I added 1-cup of chocolate chips to the coconut topping and used a mixture of pecans and walnuts cause thats all I had around. I covered the pan with foil for the 1st 10 minutes. They were easy to make and turned out great.

Personally, I wasn't wowed by these, but my family was. At their urging, I'll keep this recipe and probably will make again.

My problem with this recipe is that the topping got burned before the cooking time finished. I would recommend adding the topping maybe half-way through the cooking process instead of when it goes into the oven, or maybe cover it with foil for the 1st 10 mins as one person recommended.

This was a huge hit at work. I used an 8X8 pan (have never been able to find a 9X9 pan in the stores). I increased the baking time by about 10 min, and I threw a loose layer of aluminum foil over the brownies the last 15 min. Fantastic.

Rating: 4
These were fabulous. Even the brownie recipe w/o the topping is a sound brownie very worth making--and easy. I used walnuts instead of pecans and also drizzled caramel-butterscoth topping over the top after they cooled. Wow...good idea. Next time, I am adding chococlate chips to the topping mixture (since life is short). Used a 9x9 glass square baking dish. Takes longer than 30 min, but watch closely and don't overbake.

I have been craving some good brownies for a while now... and these are it!!!!!!!! I made them without the topping, because I didn't have the stuff (but I can't wait to try them with). They were yummy and not too cakey... I did add a tablespoon of extra butter...

These brownies make my heart sing! I double the topping, and bake them in a smaller pan so they are thicker. They are amazing right out of the oven with vanilla ice cream!

i would cover the top with foil for the first 10 minutes or so of baking, as the topping was tasty but almost burned. also, next time i will try substituting oil for part of the butter, in hopes that it won't be quite so fluffy. very enjoyable, but not like a traditional brownie.

Excellent and easy to make. Made it a smaller dish and cooked it longer and still great. My whole family devoured it.

So yummmy, used milk chocolate chips instead of pecans. They were yummy and fudgey even after they had been frozen for a while and defrosted.

Outstanding. Easy to make, and the contrast of the topping with the brownie was scrumptious. Served warm with vanilla ice cream. Rave reviews.

I made these brownies for a barbecue and they were a *huge* hit! People kept saying, "you MADE these?!?" Despite the description, the brownies were perfectly fudgey - not cakey. These were too easy and too delicious not to make over and over again!

still dreaming about these- and trying to avoid making them again!

These were fantastic. I ended up having to cover the brownies with foil for the last 10mins (the topping looked pretty brown to me) as other reviewers had. Made these during a snowstorm day and they were devoured! A great texture...not cake but not so dense they are bricks. Delicious, love them. Make some now!

a cake like recipe that is not chocolately enough!

If you like a cake-like brownie you will like these. I prefer a more fudge-like brownie so I did not like these. The topping was pretty good. I recommend adding this topping to the Turtle Brownies on this web site.

This is an quick and delicious recipe, which is a great alternative to having to melt chocolate over a double-boiler and wait for it to cool. To yield 36 2-inch square pieces, I doubled the recipe and poured the batter in to a foil-lined 2" hotel pan. The coconut did toast pretty fast so be careful!

These are the best brownies I've ever had! My boyfriend loved them, my friends loved them...My only problem was that I forgot to add the butter to the topping so it didn't stick to the top very well. :) They still tasted great!

Finally, a brownie recipe that's a keeper :) These are incredibly easy to make since there is no chocolate chopping or double boiler involved. I did not have a 9*9 pan, so I made them in a glass 8*8 pan and an extra little round pan. I took the small round pan out after 25 minutes and those were the best--cakie on the bottom and fudgy on the top. I baked the 8*8 pan for 30 minutes and they were still wonderful, but did not have a fudgy top. I guess the trick is not to wait for the tester to come out with crumbs.

I wasn't sure I would like this. I am a brownie purist. But, it was fabulous. The sweet/salty thing really worked. I brought it to work and impressed my co-workers.

WOW!! Talk about yummie!! I took these brownies over to our next door neighbor who is suffering from cancer..and he and his wife liked them SO much that he told me when his "good" days are so I could bring him these brownies on those days...and you better believe I will.

This recipe got a big wow from my family and friends. I added a bit extra to the ingredients and made it in a 9 by 13 pan. This was a perfect brownie. My husband always said he liked unadorned chocolate brownies, these changed his mind. A keeper.

Oh My!-This recipie turned out perfectly. The brownies have a deliciously crunchy yet slightly salty topping that don't break up when you cut to serve. And the taste is out of this world. I will definitely make these again.

This recipe was delicious-- rich and fudgy, but not cloying or overly dense. I served the brownies with fresh, less-sweet vanilla ice cream. It was a great combination, especially given the topping's crumbly consistency. A winning variation on a classic.

These brownies are wonderfully fudge-like with a good chocolate flavor. Be aware, they took signifigantly longer to bake than indicated - a total of 50-55 minutes - and were still moist & chewy.

This is one of the best brownie recipes ever. The topping of pecans and coconut really livened up the moist and chewy brownie. What a great combination. I doubled the recipe and realized I only had enough cocoa for one batch; therefore, I made one w/cocoa and the other without. The one without cocoa turned out fabulous as well. This is definitely a keeper!

Tasty and easy to make. I did make them in a glass pan and had to cook about 15 minutes longer than suggested, even in a convection oven. Brownies were still chewy and moist, though I had to cover the top with foil so that it didnt burn.

I served these brownies warm from the oven, topped with vanilla ice cream. They were a major hit...cakey but still very moist. I used "heaping" measurements for all the topping ingredients. I recommend this recipe for fans of coconut in particular.
