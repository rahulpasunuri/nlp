I like this recipe and added 1/2 teaspoon of ground fennel seed along with the salt and pepper. I used chicken broth instead of water, as one reviewer suggested and found this dish very tasty.

This was so-so. I had to use more oil and water while cooking the sprouts to prevent them from burning. I quartered the Brussels sprouts.

Save your time! I love Brussels sprouts but this is not good. Tasted like grass to me. (Not the kind you smoke!) It just did not work.

The taste of this dish was ok, but the color was awful. The brussels sprouts, once shredded and cooked, were a murky green, and the balsamic vinegar didn't help matters.

Finally, the perfect way to serve this delicious vegetable on an elegant table. I may use chicken or vegetable broth in place of water the next time. Cook a little longer and don't bother to core them. This would be awesome as a filler in an eggroll.

This will definitely be a regular side dish! Really delicious!!!

My boyfriend hated brussel sprouts until he tasted this recipe...very tasty. I'd suggest using flavored balsamic vinegar - we have a fig and meyer lemon balsamic vinegar that really made this dish delicious.

This dish was pretty tasty. I'd say it makes 4 medium-sized side dishes.
