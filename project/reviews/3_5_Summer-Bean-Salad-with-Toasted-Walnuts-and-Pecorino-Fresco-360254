The only reason I rated this with even one fork was because there must have been some good nutritional value to it. Otherwise, it was bland, tasteless, disappointing. I followed the recipe exactly, used every single ingredient called for (including relatively expensive walnut oil and pecorino fresco), and it wasn't worth the time or effort. Every person took about one or two bites and left the rest on their plate.

So good! Used arugula instead of frisee. So tasty! It went over (with the men) as more of a hit than the tried and true pork tenderloin that I served it with.

Yum. Didnt make it to the farm stand for the wax beans so I used all green, but this was quite delish. Used Manchego and I loved the salty bite with the walnuts. Also added a few kalamata olives for more color and I liked them too.

Very pleasant salad that gets better as you munch. Nice variation of textures, and a mature, smoky edge in the marriage of sheep's milk cheese (I used manchego), toasted walnuts, and Dijon mustard. A side of green grapes or sliced apple adds a nice sweet contrast. Would probably also pair well with savory red meat.

Bland. Wouldn't serve this again. Very dissapointed.

A delicious and easy salad. I could not find yellow wax beans, so I grilled slices of two yellow zucchini and cut those into strips. Added great flavor. This salad has a wonderful combination of tastes and textures.

Made this for company and everyone asked for recipe. I made this as written EXCEPT couldn't find the different beans, so used all green. Still great!

Loved this. Brought it camping and put it together there, and everyone loved it. I used a Greek semi-soft sheep cheese.

I really loved the combination of flavors and the crunch of the nuts. A great thing to make when beans are in season. So easy.

Where do you buy fresh yellow wax beans? I wouldn't contaminate my delicious salad with canned yellow beans! This is a four forks recipe without them. I served it with mahi mahi and an orzo side.
