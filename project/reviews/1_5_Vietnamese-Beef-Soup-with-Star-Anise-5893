Wow, just horrible. I can't believe they left out the charred ginger and onion, and the use of chicken broth? That's why you make stock with the beef bones -- that's your broth! And using mai fun rice sticks instead of pho noodles is odd, as are the missing spices. (as a side note, are all of you saying "pho thai" meaning "pho tai"? I've never heard of "pho thai" but in Vietnamese cooking, pho tai is pho with rare beef sliced thin.)

Omitted from this recipe are the 1/2-cup of dried grasshoppers (or 3/4 cup live); crickets are acceptable but not authentic. Fresh, whitebeard grubs are optional, but don't use more than a few tablespoons (add them carefully before heating so they don't pop: the stink is horrendous).

Recipe definitely lacks the full body and aroma that true Pho has, and I personally like the Pho thai bo vien, which is with rare beef and beef meat balls. Lack of charred onions and ginger, along with the omission of cloves and cinnamon definitely does not speak very well for true vietnamese cuisine. Please give this dish a try in a reputable vietnamese restaurant, but don't attempt it with this recipe.

not good!. I expect better and more authentic recipes on epicurious.com.YOU DEFINITELY NEED:GINGER AND YELLOW ONION (ROASTED) FISH SAUCE,GLOVES,NUTMEG AND CINNAMON.. Pho is becoming more mainstream food in the world now, therefore more authentic recipes are essentials...

Not authentic. Need a medium onion and a 3 inch piece of gingerroot. Broil these two until slightly charred and add to the soup pot when you are cooking the bones. I would also add a stick of cinnamon.

was pretty good. never thought i could make pho at home, but was very surprised that it tasted very similar to what i would get at the best pho houses.

Good, basic pho recipe, but it's not a real vietnemese reciepe. This is just some American would-be. For a good, real version of this, try pho thai. Very, very similar, but much more elegant and flavorful. Vietnemese cooking centers more on herbs and flavor, and less on seasoning. Big key to cooking.

lacks the complexity of a good pho.Where is the Nam Pla, for example? Nice place to start, though.
