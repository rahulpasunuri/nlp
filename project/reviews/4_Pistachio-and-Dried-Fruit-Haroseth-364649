I've made this twice now and is wonderful!!!!!!!! I ran out of dried cherries and in a pinch, elected to use dried prunes - PERFECTION. I also sprinkled in about a half tablespoon of Grand Marnier - really lovely. You don't have to have pomegranate juice. In another pinch I scooped a heaping teaspoon of blueberry jam. This is really great.

Just made this for tomorrow night's Seder. It is so good. I used golden raisins instead of dates, but made the rest exactly as written. This will definitely become a regular in years to comes.

This was delicious and will be part of our seder next year. More interesting than the traditional haroset.

This was terrific and will be part of our seder next year. Everyone loved it and some suggested this could be used year-round as an alternative to granola with yogurt.

This is way tastier in my opinion than the normal charoset. We (aka, my boyfriend) added 3 granny smith apples soaked in lemon juice, riesling instead of passover wine, vanilla extract, ginger and white pepper. We also left out the pomegrante juice and put it maybe half the normal amount of pistachios and no honey. Super yummy and sweet passover alternative!

This was a big hit with everyone at the seder. I used cranberries. I think toasting the pistachios was a big taste plus. My food processor wasn't working, but I cut up the dried fruit with a knife, did the soaking, and then used a mortar and pestle to grind together with the pistachios, which made a pretty good texture.
