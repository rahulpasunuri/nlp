These were awful. Too much oil, soggy and tasteless.

Good recipe. You just have to pay attention to the bottoms of the hashbrowns. I burned mine the first time around

This is a great side dish. The "slide out and invert" prep didn't work out, but I just flipped them over in "spatula" scoops and it worked fine. A lot easier, too.

I have mixed reviews on this recipe. The flavor is wonderful!! The prep was miserable. I heated the oil properly and the potatoes stuck to the pan and I just had a heaping mess. No way did they just slip out!! I don't know what I did wrong. I've been successful with hash brown recipes in the past.

Easy, but do not ignore the need for a food processor.I shredded the potato by hand and it did not hold together as nicely. My husband asks for this almost every Saturday morning. I make it using just two potatoes and it is wonderful. Also, I have not been able to find Yukon Golds, so I used Russets because I had 'em. Still awesome.

Halved the recipe for two people so it didn't look as pretty as the magazine photo, but had a good flavor ans was simple.
