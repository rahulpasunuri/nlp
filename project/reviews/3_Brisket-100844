I was worried about making this after reading the reviews but I decided to go for it and I'm glad I did. I mostly followed the recipe (no beef broth and less tomato paste. Only 2 potatoes and celery stalks). The 5.5 lb brisket barely fit into my 8 qt oval crock pot. My boyfriend loved it. I may make it again since I always have the ingredients on hand (except the brisket).

Lots of ingredience for not a lot of yummy. I think I might have been thinking it would be heartier than it was - it was a tad too sweet.

Yum! Just made this for the first time. It was awesome. Brisket was perfectly tender, and the vegetables were cooked through without being mushy. We put it in the crock for 5 hours on high. Followed the recipe exactly as written, just cutting everything in half. Great amount for two, plus some leftovers. It was a little watery, but we actually kind of liked that. Perfect amount of potato, too. I saw some reviewers said it was too sweet because they used maple syrup instead of molasses. That definitely would make it way too sweet, since maple syrup is far sweeter than molasses! I would not ever recommend that substitution.

I made this for a party of 20 (we had more guests than planned). Was a total hit, not a slice of meat left! It is true there is a lot of extra sauce. Having read the other reviews I knew I would need to reduce the sauce, so I took the meet out and cooked the sauce for 3+hours in the crock with the lid off. Made a nice thick gravy/bbq sauce. There were frankly way too many potatoes (would use 1 of the 4 called for in the future), I made mashed pots with the extra as they were taking up too much space in my crock pot!

Great, easy recipe. I cut back slightly on the brown sugar, but aside from that, followed the recipe. I normally have most of the ingredients in the house (except the brisket), so this was easy to pull together. It had the added benefit of making the house smell great.

I agree with prior reviews - too much liquid. I added corn starch to thicken and the result is something closer to a stew. Very enjoyable. tangy and sweet.

I was disappointed in this recipe! It sounded so good, was a lot of work, and the end result was too sweet and while the brisket was tender, it wasn't as juicy as I'd expected it to be. If this was less work to get into the slow cooker, I'd probably make it again, occasionally. But, many of these ingredients are not in my pantry normally, and between all the dishes, and the clean up, it's not worth the work. A simple recipe would likely work better! I'm off to find it because I love brisket!

molasses isn't as sweet as maple syrup, so unc spark and others considering the substitution, the syrup will make it much sweeter as syrup is a more concentrated sweetness.

I tried this for the first time yesterday. It took me a while to get all the ingredients together so I was apprehensive about ever doing it again, but it was sure worth it because when I got home it smelled amazing and tasted great! I did the whole recipe in half since our slow cooker is only about 3 qts. so my brisket piece was around 2 lbs. It seemed a bit more like pot roast with the potatoes than brisket, but I would definitely recommend it. There is a lot of juice but I'm thinking about using it for a soup or something since it tasted so good.

This recipe has amazing flavors! I omitted the potatoes, used carrots instead and served over egg noodles. My husband and 5 year old son loved it, too! I'll definitely make this again!

Rating: 2
Although the meat was very tender, I did find this too sweet, and that was after cutting the sugar down to 1/4 cup and using maple syrup (not molasses). Like others, I also found the liquid to be quite a lot, even after cutting down the beer to 6 oz and omitting the broth altogether. This was easy to make, and not too bad, but just too sweet.

Rating: 3
I didn't set out to make the changes to the recipe that I did. Reading in the comment section about the thin sauce I browned about 3 T of flour in the onion mixture before adding the liquid. I always, always add a generous amount of Tabasco to my brisket so that of course had to go in. My 9 year old helped herself to some of the brown sugar I had measured out, so I was short about 1 T and too lazy to get more. I got a bit distracted and forgot to put the can of tomatoes in. I'm grateful for all the changes though, because this truely was a wonderful brisket.

I prepared this for New Years eve 2009 and it was a resounding success. I followed the advice of many of the comments and went easy of the extra liquid. I slow cooked mine (6.5 lbs) for 8 hrs on low and it came out so melt in your mouth delicious. I added the liquid in the bottom of the slow cooker to a roux and whisked until desired consistency, and it made a great gravy. I served this with Mashed Potatoes and french cut green beans and almonds. Because it was New Years, we were up very late and had brisket sandwiches at about 3 AM, which were also a resounding success. I would absoultely make this again.

Fantastic. Made with maple syrup in place of molasses. Omitted the broth. Sauce is a lot, but could provide a great liquid for bread. potatoes were well cooked, but a little disappointing. Will definitely make again. The braise effect on the brisket was phenomenal.

With the changes suggested by previous reviewers, I found this recipe to be delicious, great smell while cooking and very rich in taste. Saved some of the gravy for other dishes. I substituted cola for beer, balsamic vinegar for red wine vinegar and maple syrup for molasses. This recipe is a keeper for my family winter treasures.

If only this recipe tasted as good as it smells! We are only one year into using a slow cooker -- the idea of preping a meal in the morning to have dinner ready when we return at the end of the day is really attractive -- but not this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly -- with the exception of substituting balsamic vinegar for red wine vinegar. When we returned home tonight, the kitchen was redolent with good scents. Served the brisket, and it was without merit. If only one could eat the aroma!

Rating: 2
I liked this recipe idea BUT It produced way to much liquid. If I remake it, and it was delicious, I will omit the potatoes. Secondly, I would use the liquids as a marinade, adding a shot of espresso for some smoky taste. After browning the meat and adding it to the slow cooker on top of the celery and onions, add drained stewed tomatoes. Whisk a whole small can of tomato paste into a cup and a half of the marinade, and then put that into the slow cooker too. Maybe a tad of tabasco? Maybe drink half the beer? Was good, but should adjust liquid level. Yum! ;)

I have made this many times and have made a few minor changes. I substitute balsamic vinegar (as a few reviewers note) and use maple syrup for molasses. We haven't been overly thrilled with the potatoes so I add 2 instead of 4. Once the meat is done, I remove about 4 cups of the sauce (with the onions and tomatoes) and most of the potatoes to a bowl, then blend with a hand blender. Great way to thicken it into a gravy without using corn starch.

Rating: 3
happy with the results, but i should have noted that this was created for an oval cooker. next time, i'll need to buy a smaller brisket.

Rating: 2
This was decent but not spectacular. I cut the sauce in half and used a smaller brisket. Common sense tells you how much meat and sauce will fit in your crock-pot. I did not find it greasy, as I used a well trimmed brisket. Again, common sense says that the fat on the meat won't disappear. It was tender with a nice, thick sauce, but the flavor was not exceptional.

This is the first time I have felt compelled to write a review. Although I changed this recipe slightly, it was a great way to use a piece of sale brisket. My family, including young boys, ate everything! I left out the brown sugar, as we don't like sauces that are too sweet. I used stewed tomatoes, but would use chopped (fire-roasted) tomatoes the next time as we found the stewed tomatoes a bit too sweet and the texture wrong for this dish. Perhaps I used the wrong stewed tomatoes, but they were the only ones in my grocery without unpronounceable ingredients! Please serve with bread to soak up the juice. You can thicken it, but we liked smashing the potatoes to soak up the jus.

Rating: 3
Wonderful flavor but next time I would look harder to find 1 hunk of meat. I did three smaller steaks and the meat was a bit overdone. Also, I ladled out the sauce (which was really thin as is) and put it in a saucepan with cornstarch to thicken like a BBQ sauce. Served as open face sandwiches - yummy!

Rating: 3
I ended up making a few changes. Could of sworn there was a beer in the frig, but DH must of gotten to it. Looked around saw a Pepsi and remembered an older recipe that called for cola, so thought why not? No stewed tomatoes so I used canned chopped. The last hour of cooking I took the lid off and turned the temp to high. It allowed the sauce to thicken a bit and the pot kept a nice slow simmer. Let it sit overnight, sliced the brisket and reheated in the oven covered with foil. Served with mashed potatoes. It was very good. Oh and I used 1/2 red wine vinegar and 1/2 balsalmic.

I have made this a few times. It seems that the reviewers either love it or hate it - my family loves it. I have used brisket as well as chuck roast and it always comes out tasty. I took one reviewers advice and use balsamic for the red wine vinegar. Also, I don't like molasses so I have omitted altogether or have used maple syrup as a substitute - both are good. As for too much sauce - who cares? I take 3 or 4 cups, put in a sauce pan and thicken with a little bit of corn starch to make a gravy - then throw away the extra. No big deal!

I have made this several times and received rave reviews from all. I now skip the potatoes. Either cook them separately before serving or serve with egg noodles. I also reduced the Dijon to 1/4 c, but that is my personal preference. You may like a stronger mustard flavor. There is TONS of sauce left over, so it would go well over mashed potatoes. Enjoy!

I made this recipe as directed but left the skin on the potatoes. However, I did cook for 8 hours and still had a lot of liquid. I removed much of the liquid and reduced it on the stove to a BBQ sauce consistency. We had this brisket for dinner twice and lunch once. I still have BBQ sauce left over and will freeze for another use. It was absolutely delicious.

This was definitely worth the prep work. It was SO tender and flavorful. Last night we ate it as is for dinner. Today leftovers became BBQ sandwiches for lunch and will become (with just the addition of a few spices) Mexican shredded beef burritos for dinner. Really a fabulous and versatile recipe.

Loved it! After reading several reviews about the sweetness and too much liquid, I made a few changes: I made only half the recipe, omitting the beef broth, brown suger and molasses. In order to thicken the sauce, I added some flour at the beginning. (Mix it with all the liquids in a bowl first, and then add it to the meat.) Also, I used balsamic instead of red wine vinegar and Guinness stout for the beer. It was perfect.

Rating: 4
I left the skin on the potatoes, quartered them, placed them on top of the meat and removed them after 4 hours. The meat came our perfect, moist, flavorful and shreds easily and the potatoes did not overcook. I removed excess fat from the meat before cooking and it didn't come out too greasy. You can always skim the fat off the sauce at the end. The sauce is tangy and sweet at the same time. I like my brisket barbeque style and so it suits me fine. My husband prefers it the way my 90 year old aunt makes it..kind of bland.

To reduce some carbs I omitted the brown sugar and then omitted the tomato paste to offset it. Was not too sweet, By the way, the time-consuming browning of the meat and onions is to make the sauce more flavorful.

I've made this dish 3 times. There is nothing like putting the ingredients in the pot, going out for 8 hours, coming into a house that smells sensational, and eating this lovely cut of meat. I've used Rib-eye, brisket, sirloin, and porterhouse. Everyone was tremendous. I usually had a big California or Italian red wine with this....either a Cab from Napa or a nice Brunello.

I thought this was just okay. Reminded me a lot of Swiss steak of which I'm not really a fan. And I also don't like the idea of having to cook anything before it goes in the slow cooker -- seems to kind of defeat the point of a slow cooker being simple and easy.

Really excellent. A great meal for a slow cooker. I added carrots, parsnips, and a little extra garlic. If you use a first cut of brisket, it isn't too greasy at all. I highly recommend it.

I have a 6 qt oval crock pot and used a 5.7 lb brisket and followed the recipe to a T, and it barely fit into the pot and I had to scoop out liquid every hour or so to keep it from overflowing. I cooked it on low for 8 hours and the brisket, which was $40, was not very tender and the vegetables and sauce were just so-so. The potatoes definitely tasted to vinegary. I'm amazed at how many reviewers loved this dish.

I used this recipe as a guide to what I could put into the this meal. I also like to try to make due w/the ingredients I do have on hand. Saying that, I thought this was great. I stayed pretty true to the recipe, except didn't use onions, celery, canned tomatoes & molasses. I used a tomato, some leftover tomato sauce, hoisin, carrots & onion powder. Added extra mustard & garlic. Used a dark Italian beer. And used one of my favorite ingredients for spice, chipotle. Towards the end added balsamic vinegar & peas. D'lish!

I don't have an insert for my 5 qt. round slow-cooker, but used it anyway to cook a 1-1/4 lb. WELL AGED (i.e. VERY OLD, with freezer burn cut off) flank steak. Only made 1/4 of the recipe to accommodate my small steak. Only changed one thing--used 1/2 can of Italian-Style stewed tomatoes (didn't have any regular), and omitted any tomato paste. The "BBQ" sauce was excellent, and different than any store-bought that I know of. The steak was excellent too. I just felt that the potatoes absorbed too much flavor of the sauce. Next time I would put the meat at the bottom of the pot, followed by the potatoes and then all the other stuff. Or just bake the potatoes separately and then spoon the sauce over them as a topping. Hubby loved it, but I did all the lengthy prep., and still have to clean the crock-pot!!!

Brisket is our favorite beef and we just tried this recipe last week--EXCELLENT!!! taste--even my very picky husband loved it and next time we plan to use an even bigger brisket. We have the Lora Brody slow-cooker cookbook and it is also terrific...it uses REAL ingredients, not processed foods like soup mix, and I have enjoyed everything we've tried--try the 'lamb you can eat with a spoon' also, if you like this brisket. It's like a barbecue sauce, but chunkier, and the taste is terrific!!

I made this pretty much like the recipe said and was pleased with the results! So were my guests. Meat tender and sauce was a good compliment. However, I wasn't impressed with the potatoes and will probably try something else in their place next time. Also the sauce started spilling out over the top of my 6qt about 6 and 1/2 hours in. I had to take the lid off and take some sauce out twice. Good thing I was there or i would have come home to a mess.

Reading the reviews I felt maybe this was just too big a dish for a slow cooker. I baked it in the oven at 325 covered for 3 hours, 375 for 1/2 hour to reduce liquid.

We tried this a few nights back, and while the meat did come out tender and with a wonderful texture, the flavor was awful.

This recipe produced way too much liquid and I had to reduce the sauce by simmering it on the stove to get any real flavor. For all the work that was required, I believe the same flavor and tenderness could be achieved by using a decent bottled barbeque sauce, stock and the required veggies.

This recipe is a great one to enjoy after a hectic day away! It smells great, too! The first step of browning the brisket can be skipped without compromising the final outcome.

This recipe was very time consuming to put together. I think it took me at least an hour. The briscket, which is my favorite meat for potroast, was good but the sauce and the potatoes were not to my liking. The potatoes had tasted like the sauce which was overpowered with the vinegar and other strong flavors. I did not like the sauce at all. Brisket has such a great taste without all those ingredients that just covers up all the good meat flavors.
