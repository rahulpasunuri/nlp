I used turkey wings and made this up the day before Thanksgiving. I wanted to have good flavorful stock on hand to make my gravy. Yes, the smoke that wafted out when I fist opened the oven to peek after 30 mins. set off my smoke alarms too. I did back off the temperature to 400 for the remaining 30 mins. and that was just fine. Next year I may start at 400 and hopefully avoid emptying my kitchen of humanity while roasting the wings. I tossed the roasted wings and the rest of the ingredients into a large kettle and let it gently simmer the afternoon away. Using this for the gravy on Thanksgiving day along with a bit of the potato water and a quick stock from the giblets was divine. The best part was ladling some of this hot stock onto the platter of carved turkey meat - kept it moist and hot. I also used some on my stuffing before baking it separately in the oven. Loved having plenty of hot stock to moisten and flavor with.

I used Turkey Wings and Necks and roasted the vegetables with the turkey on two trays - I wanted the caramelization of the vegetables to add to the richness of the stock. I added an additional two celery ribs and carrots, uncooked, when I boiled the stock down and I ended up with 8 cups of the most extraordinary stock I have ever made. It is frozen & awaiting Thanksgiving. It is rich, has tremendous mouth feel and I cannot wait to use it. I highly recommend it.

This is an outstanding turkey stock recipe and very easy to make, though it did fill my house with smoke as well. Still, it's worth it.

I've been making this stock for years and have loved the way the stock turns out so flavorful after roasting the turkey parts. After looking at the Rodger's recipe of Nov. 2008 Golden Turkey Stock I may try roasting as suggested there at 400 degrees for two hours instead of the 500 degrees for one hour which is stated here. That may give even extra flavor and avoid the smoke problem that other reviewers experienced? All in all, roasting is the way to go, though, and I'll never make turkey stock any other way!

OK, wanna make this stock really healthy? Add about 1 tablespoon of vinegar to water and bones; let it slightly simmer for 24-48 hours, then add your vegetables for flavor. The vinegar will help break down the bones (soft enough to crush in your fingers) and bring all those wonderful, highly absorbable minerals from the bones into your stock. No mineral supplement (whatever the price) will absorb in your body as well as the minerals in this stock. For more info, google Weston A. Price, an old time nutritionist who studied why Americans were so unhealthy.

Excellent stock. It really isn't that much work to do it this way. It takes time, but not a lot of effort. Roasting the bones and vegetables brings out so much more flavor. You have to watch it in the oven so it doesn't burn, just need to brown it. Timing and temp varies with your equipment. I chilled it overnight and skimmed the fat the next day. Less messy and faster that way.

This is a superb turkey stock -- rich, and layered with flavor. It's a significant enhancement for both the gravy and stuffing. It's a keeper.

About the same amt of work as for other great stocks. No probs with smoke. Fantastic gravy. My family rates the gravy each year and this was rated the best yet. Will use again for sure.

Wow, this is a lot of work, but a fabulous stock. Will make a great addition to my stuffing and gravy. I am planning on using chunks of the turkey wing meat in my stuffing.

I've tried this recipe in previous years and also filled my house with smoke - plus the burnt vegetables didn't make that great a stock! Didn't anyone else besides Las Vegas and me have this problem??? I'm back on Epicurious to find a DIFFERENT recipe!

This stock is good, but I would not make again. Within 10 minutes of having the turkey in the oven, my apartment filled up with smoke. Even with two fans going and the windows open, it was very, very bad. I have never encountered the probem to such an extent before. What a mess!

I have been making this stock for years. It makes such a difference in your gravy. It makes a substantial amount so you can rest assured you will not run out of gravy if you have a crowd or if you are entertaining a smaller number you can freeze the excess.
