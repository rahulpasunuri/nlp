I'm no math whiz, but the recipe says, "for 1/4 cup chipotle marinade..." then goes on to list more than FOUR CUPS worth of ingredients. Something is wrong.

More on the salt issue: the tamarind paste you can buy in cello-wrapped packages contains salt. A lot of salt, as a preservative. Downward adjust (to 1/2 cup kosher??), if that's what you're using

To the cook from Tennessee on 02/15/02, I expect your results turned out more salty than most because you marinated your meat for more than twice as long as the recipe called for.

Yes,I know the difference between Kosher salt and plain iodized salt's sodium content. Even using kosher salt this recipe was too salty to be edible. After spending hours in preparation and two days marinating,I can't begin to express how upset I am at how this recipe turned out. I just finished a bowl of cereal for dinner. I'm once again in search of a Tex-Mex rib recipe. Oh,well.

For the chipotle rub, it is crucial to use only kosher salt in this recipe. It is a mild salt, clean tasting and the only one that works here. Any other course salt ruins a perfect recipe. If you have made this using any other salt, try again with kosher salt. You won't believe the difference and you will understand the reason for the specified quantities. The difference is night and day.

Change the 1.5 cups salt to 1.5 tablespoons!
