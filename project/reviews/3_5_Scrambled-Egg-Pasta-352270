I really liked this! Of course, I switched the recipe up. I didn't use bacon at all...it just sounded unappealing to me. I cooked finely cut tomatoes and mushrooms in olive oil and butter, and added them to the egg mixture. It was delicious!

Pretty good! I used ham and broccoli instead of onions and bacon, though I wonder if onions would make it tastier. I also added a bit of paprika and garlic salt. I think the egg to pasta ratio is off though; I ended up with a huge plate of pasta with little egg coating. I'd make sure to make less pasta, or add an extra egg or two

This was good, quick, easy and everyone liked it. Do make sure to follow the reviews not the recipe as regards cooking the bacon first and onion separately in just a little bacon grease. Throw some peas in with the pasta as it cooks; the dish needs the color.

Two and a half forks for this one. Very good, but not in the delicious category. A basic, quick and easy kid-friendly, comfort food sort of recipe. Messy pot, though.

I liked this recipe, although unlike the previous reviewer (who apparently felt he needed to double up on his review), I omitted the bacon. I would definitely not try to cook bacon and onions at the same time. First bacon, then onions in the bacon fat. Anyway, I sauteed some asparagus, mushrooms, and a finely diced tomato in butter and olive oil and added that with the egg mixture. Overall, this is a good dish.

INEDIBLE! we just threw the whole 4 servings of it in the trash. the bacon was slightly burned yet somehow still soft and rubbery. the whole thing tasted like it had 8 strips of bacon fat in it, because it did! it's enough to make your mouth feel like it has a layer of film in it. you CAN NOT follow these cooking directions. cook the bacon the way bacon is meant to be cooked, not boiled in onion juice, and drain the fat so it's not a greasy nasty mess!

ridiculous! you can't cook an entire onion and 8 slices of bacon at the same time if you want the bacon to be crispy and the onions to not be overdone. there's way too much water and grease in the pan to brown or carmelize anything. it came out watery and greasy with wiggly yet somehow also overdone bacon. DO NOT COOK ALL AT ONCE.

This recipe was awesome! When I follow recipes, it usaully doesn't come out as it should. But this recipe was very easy and I even substituted some of the ingredients for what I could find in the kitchen. I used smoked gouda cheese in the egg mixture, turkey bacon and shallots instead of onions. I also used fresh linguine instead of the suggested pasta. It tasted like it was straight from a restaurant! Initially I had the heat too high when I added the egg mixture, but I strirred fast and lowered the heat. I would definately make this recipe again.

I used Pecorino and boiled some peas w/ the pasta. My take was almost sth in between a trad carbonnara & this as in I didn't really want scrambled eggs in my pasta but wanted the egg to just start to cook. So, in a way this is how I do carbonnara. I don't take the pan of the heat but I just switch it off and then pour the egg mixture and stir till it's thickened.

This was an easy dish to make and delicious. Even the kids, who aren't bacon lovers, liked this meal. It's important to serve it immediately after it's ready, otherwise the pasta absorbs the liquids and it gets a little rubbery. Even then, the pasta still tastes good!

Really delicious. A good use for that seldom-used bacon that must be consumed. Number of eggs can be increased. Easy, quick, and safer than the traditional carbonara recipe, since the eggs are fully cooked.

I throw 1 cup of frozen peas when combining all the ingredients and continually stirring until the egg cooks and the peas heat through.

Delicious. Used egg substitute and Canadian bacon to healthy it up a little and everybody still went back for seconds.

Surprisingly good and very easy to prepare! It's a great base upon which to add shrimp, asparagus and maybe even a little lemon.

This is a deceptively delicious dish! The egg coats the pasta adding richness. A great weeknight dinner! The only change I made was that I deglazed my pan with some white wine (maybe 1/4 c) when the bacon and onions had just about finished cooking so that I could get all the tasty brown bits.

Easy and fast.I used about 1/4 of the requested bacon and I didn't miss it. I mixed some pesto into the onion as it cooked and it really made a robust flavor. My newest breakfast staple.

I substituted turkey bacon and this dish was absolutely phenomenal! Rave reviews all around!
