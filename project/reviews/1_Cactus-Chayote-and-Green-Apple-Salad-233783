in order for nopales to loose the slime, they have to be cooked in water with a copper penny for twenty minutes and rinced in cold water.

Nopales do not have to be this slimy. Nopales should be boiled with very little water for 15-20 minutes to release their liquid and then they should be rinsed.

this didnt turn out well for me. i followed the recipe pretty well, except had no ice so used cool water for nopales. wondering if they are always so slimy, or if the recipe didnt turn out well for me. never prepared nopales or chayote before, so that was exciting and fun. going to pickle the leftover nopales now.
