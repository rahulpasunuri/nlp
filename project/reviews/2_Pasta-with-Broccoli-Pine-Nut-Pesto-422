I have seen a different version of this recipe which calls for sun dried tomatos, along with some of their juices and olive oil that accompany them. It really adds flavor to the pesto. Also make sure to add plenty of cheese!

I replaced the vinegar and pepper flakes with crumbled spicy Italian sausage. Farfalle or penne are my pastas of choice.

I have not made this recipe, but a quick examination shows a few basic problem. Here's what I'd suggest for those who want to attempt it: Add at least 1/4 C of permesan cheese and a few tablespoons of romano. Pesto was not meant to be healthy. Fat carries the flavor to your tongue, and that's where the cheese comes in. Ordinary pesto would be just as bad without it. Also, be extremely careful not to overcook the broccoli. 4 minutes in a steam blancher should be plenty.

Bland bland bland. What more can I say?

Extremely disappointing.

This recipe was extremely disappointing. And it smelled so good too... but the garlic flavour was too strong (even though we used less than it called for), the texture was too dry (even though we added more oil), and the overall effect was about as similar to pesto as wet sand is to shortbread.

Really wanted to like this recipe, but I have to agree with the previous reviewer--this is very bland.

I found this recipe really lacking in flavor. I had no trouble with texture, dryness, or execution. Just taste. My husband said he liked it, but I think he was just being kind to me...

I found this recipe on the dry side and lacking in something. My fussy teenagers did like it though.

I have made this many times since first trying it. It's quick, low-calorie and tastes fantastic (depending on the quality of the broccoli!) It's become one of my old faithfuls.
