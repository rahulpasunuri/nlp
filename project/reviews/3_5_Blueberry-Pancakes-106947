I was not very happy with this recipe. The batter was thin and the pancake tasted of baking powder. The blueberries stuck out of the batter and when you flipped the pancake, the batter never cooked. So, because I have this thing about wasting good mIlk, eggs and flour, I read the reviews, which I should have done in the first place, and decided to add about 3/4 cup more flour. Since I was out of blueberries by then because I'd fixed my regular batter, we decided chocolate chips would be small enough for this new batter. This worked out well. We'll try blueberries with the extra flour next time.

No need for cake flour...made half this recipe for myself and my boyfriend, came out perfectly! I think the cake flour might make them too thin.

I am 9 years old and made these today for mother's day in England. Great! but I used less milk (1 1/2 cups) and my mom thought they were the best ever!

This is my go-to pancake recipie, since it doesn't require butter milk. It can even be made with whole grain flour. The batter IS a little thin, but don't sweat it. The secret is not to over beat and to pour the pancake on the griddle from the middle. Just pour in what will be the middle of the pancake and let it spead on its own. It will fluff up just fine and even be able to hold blueberries.

Perhaps I didn't measure well-enough. I halved the recipe, but the pancakes didn't seem to cook throughly after the initial flip. My pancakes came out heavy, but they tasted pretty good!

I made this recipe exactly as described and I really enjoyed the end results. The pancakes are nice and light. The only change I plan on making next time is to reduce the sugar to 1/8 C as they seem a little too sweet with the 1/4 C. With that said, these pancakes would be delicious served with a nice salty breakfast side like bacon.

The pancake batter was too thin. All the blueberries that I sprinkled on top did not encorporate into the batter resulting in rolling blueberries all over the frying pan!

These pancakes were nearly perfect. They were fluffy and light. I think other reviewers that found them to be flat may have had problems with over-mixing? Pancake batter should still have lumps in it. Also, I used all purpose flour since I was out of cake flour. They were a snap to make and tasted great.

I agree with other reviewers. The flavor was great, but they were so flat. My family prefers a fluffy pancake. I even added flour and baking powder, but to no avail.

The recipes works well with frozen blueberries, too. The batter is thin and runny, so be prepared for that when you put the batter on the griddle. Overall, this one's a keeper.

First of all the BATTER is rather runny but don't let that scare you away from making these pancakes. They are crepe LIKE but have 3 times the substance. I made a double batch but did not have whole milk and used 2%. I used fresh huckleberries and my family loved them, especially my husband who is very particular about food. I am thinking of serving them in a crepe like fashion the next time, rolled around a sweet cream cheese / ricotta mixture. You can definitely play with this recipe.

I changed a lot but think the essence was the same, and it was quite good. My 4 and 7 y.o. were big fans. I don't have a well-stocked kitchen, as my just ex-wife kept most of the tools, so I'm often improvising on ingredients and equipment, so I used two iron skillets as a griddle with some butter as an anti-stick. I added a 1/4 tsp cinnamon to the dry ingredients, and just used all King Arthur All Purpose instead of cake flower, which worked fine (fortunately). I also added two tbps of Cointreau to the wet. Oh, and no blueberries. They turned out fluffy and thick, and my girls and I downed all but two cakes (with some French strawberry jam, don't have any syrup)!

I made these this morning for soohor (our pre-dawn meal before fasting begins in Ramadan)and was very pleased. Its true they are not thick pancakes, but they are definately pancakes and not crepes. Makes for a delicious triple stack. Now my favorite pancake recipie!

I have to disagree with the last reviewer. Perhaps you had overwhipped your batter because that is what it sounds like to me. I have made these and they were deliciouse! Very light and plump, not thin and runny. I would hightly recommend this recipe, no changes just as is! Very easy and worth the 5 minuts it takes to put the ingredients together!

I have made this recipe twice. The first time with skim milk, which resulted in very thin pancakes. The second time I used whole milk, as recommended, with the same result. This would be a good recipe for blueberry crepes, but if you want a good pancake recipe keep looking.

Easy and quick to make. Nice, fluffy pancakes. My kids loved them.

This is a great basic pancake recipe. And, since I never have buttermilk on hand I'm glad the recipe didn't call for it. Like other reviewers, I've made this with other toppings like chocolate chips, chopped apples, rasberries. Put anything you fancy in it.

Made this recipe for a crowd this summer. We tried it with peaches as well as bluberries. Truly delicious.

This is a good pancake recipe that doesn't call for buttermilk, which is something I don't always have on hand. It's good with or without the berries. The pancakes are tender, but a little richer than those made with a traditional buttermilk recipe.

A winner!

A simple, quick start to the day. Lovely and light with the touch of butter. For my daughter's birthday morning, we substitued chocolate chips for blueberries -- a real hit with the kids and adults.
