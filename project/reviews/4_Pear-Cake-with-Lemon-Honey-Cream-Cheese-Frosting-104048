I made this for 'cake day' at work in September. I followed the recipe to the letter as I usually do the first time I make something. It turned out fantastic. Three people ended up fighting over the last piece!

I loved the recipe! I followed other recommendations and cut back on the powdered sugar (used 1/2C) and honey (used 1/4C) on the frosting. I also increased the lemon rind to 3t. The cake is very good but the frosting is outstanding. The balance of the lemon with the spice cake is terrific. I will make this again.

Really moist, very similar to a carrot cake. Made a half recipe and it halves nicely.

I only made the frosting, but I wanted to review it because it was sooo good! I didn't add the entire amount of honey to keep it from being overwhelmingly sweet, maybe 1/3 cup. I also used lemon extract instead of peel. I will definitely being using this recipe in the future.

This was one of the best cakes I have ever make! The flavors were wonderful and everyone loved it. The recipe calls for 3 lbs of pears, when all 3 lbs were grated, I had well over 5 cups, 2 lbs is enough. With the extra pears I decided to make another batch of batter and make muffins, these were a hit, just don't keep them around the house or you'll find and extra inch on your waistline!

My favorite cake! Tripled the recipe and made in 2 12" pans (had some batter left over) for a birthday cake for 50 people. People are still talking about it 6 months later raving that it was the best cake they ever had. It is so moist and the pear is really unexpected to most people who plan on carrot or average spice cake. I didn't have any trouble with the icing, but I added the honey slowly to make sure it didn't turn too liquidy, but it didn't. Decorated with cranberries around the border and a spun sugar "crown" on top. Gorgeous and even better tasting.

Really nice change from carrot and zucchini cakes. Very coarsely grated the pears to give a lot of pear flavor in each bite. The frosting goes nicely with the pears...added a bit of fresh lemon juice to bring up the lemon flavor. Next time, might add some cardamom to increase the complexity of the cake.

WOW! Very moist and yummy. I only cooked mine 40 minutes and the texture was perfect. Only complaint is that, as noted by other reviewers, the frosting is a bit drippy and hard to work with. However, by occassionally sticking the cake and the frosting in the freezer as I was frosting it, I was able to end up with a very attractive cake. Also, my frosting ended up a bit curdled-looking, so next time I will cream the butter and creamcheese separately before adding the other ingrediants. Also, I think I overspiced mine, cuz the pear flavor didn't really show through. Or maybe it's cuz my pears were a tiny bit underripe. Oh well, still good.

this was an amazing and unique cake! i substituted half cup of brown sugar for half cup of the white sugar in the cake and also added some ground ginger. i also put less butter and sugar in the frosting then instructed and it still tasted great. a little maple syrup in the frosting hit the spot as well. yum!

Delicious, easy cake. I found the spice cake flavor to be more dominant than the pears, so next time I will halve the cinnamon and nutmeg.

I substituted melted butter for the oil. It was great. The cake was very moist and had a distinct pear flavor. If you like spice cake you will love this cake.

Reviews sounded great and decided to give it a try; however, my kids would not eat it.

Nice departure from a carrot cake. I used two 8" pans, and found that one layer was ample for a dessert. I served ten for bookclub easily as this is a dense and somewhat rich cake. I also halved the icing recipe and it was enough to cover one cake and most of the other. I had no nuts on hand but the cake was delicious none the less. Sprinkled the top with lemon zest for color.

I love this recipe! and my husband and everybody who tried it love it too! my husband works in radio and G. gorden Liddy tried it and even talked about it on the air. this is definately something I will make again!

I made this cake for a family party and it was a great success! The frosting was a bit runny but I put the cake in the fridge right away and touched it up 20 min. later and it turned out amazing. Very moist with a great flavor. I'm making it again today.

First of all, it was delicious, but not out of the ordinary. Lke other reviewers, it reminded me of a carrot cake. The frosting was divine, truly. The modifications I made: I baked it in a 9x13 pan instead of two 9" cake pans for 40 minutes. I only used 1 cup of sugar in the cake, 1/2 cup in the frosting and 1/4 cup honey. For those of you who had trouble with the frosting being too runny, it's the amount of honey you used, most likely. Didn't have any lemons on hand, so I used a little lemon extract. I wouldn't _not_ make this again, but the inside-out carrot cake cookies recipe (on this website) far surpasses this one.

This is one of my favorite cake recipes. Always gets RAVE reviews. One word of caution though, the frosting can get a little runny and needs additional cream cheese to get to a thicker spreading consistancy. I also add a little (3/4 tsp.) Cardamom to the cake batter....it gives it a little kick that is addictive!

This was the hit of our Rosh Hashanah dinner this year. I made the layers in advance and froze them, defrosting them the morning of the meal and made the icing and assembled the cake about an hour before serving. As per another reviewer's suggestion I pureed three of the pears (Bartlett) into a pearsauce and finely chopped the last one. Omitted the nuts, too. Everyone couldn't stop talking about this cake! It has a very "peary" taste that really came through. Even my mother who won't eat fruit loved it.

Pulled the last of the pears off my mom's tree to make her this cake. Didn't have time to grate the pears so cut them in chunks, which looked and tasted good. Followed another cook's advice and did the Bundt cake, used mostly applesauce instead of oil and used pecans. Halved the frosting...which I think is what makes the cake so good. Had a piece without frosting (good) and then with frosting (fantastic!). Would probably be good with apples, too.

I thought this cake was very good. I ended up making it in a bunt pan and halving the frosting recipe. This worked out great. I thought the frosting was particularly good. I may adapt my "regular" cream cheese frosting recipe to include the honey. Also, I only used about 4 or 5 pears to get the 3 cups. I found the 3 lb. estimate to be ridiculous. The baking time seemed right on as well. Definitely a keeper!

Mysteriously addictive -- though everyone thought it was carrot cake. I made it as a sheet cake in a 9x13 pan. For the frosting I skipped the lemon and used 1/2 cup of maple syrup instead of the honey. Yummy, especially the next day, but didn't taste much like maple. Had so much extra frosting I made another cake, half the size. This time I cut the sugar and oil in the cake by 1/3, substituting applesauce for the rest of the oil. Came out perfect! Without the frosting (sigh), I guess it would be a fairly healthy cake.

I wanted to love this cake, but it was just ordinary. The cake itself was fairly bland-tasting, and a little oily. The frosting was nice, but not really special. Nothing about the combination of flavors stood out.

I made three layers instead of two. The cake is really good and easy...icing was great and not too rich as I thought it would be. I will make this a Thanksgiving cake in the future. Tastes like alot of time was spent on it. I used 1/2 cup of honey and it worked out real good. I also used toasted pecans as I did not have walnuts on hand. My husband really liked the cake.

Divine. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used Bartlett pears instead.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I used 4 very ripe bartlett pears; 3 were chopped in food processer, which made kind of a pear sauce. The other one was chopped fine by hand. Since the pears were so saucey, I reduced the oil to 1/2 cup and milk to 1/4 cup. I also cut the sugar in half. It still produced a very moist cake, but with wonderful pear flavor. I used 2 cake pans as in the recipe, but served it plain in wedges without the icing. We loved it!

This was an excellent variation from your standard carrot sweetened cake. The pears add just the perfect amount of sweet and the cake is very moist. I would recommend using less cinnamon in the cake and for the frosting I found 1/2 cup of honey was plenty. I could barely taste the lemon flavor with the lemon rind so I added several teaspoons of fresh lemon juice to the frosting, it was delicious. One other note, for a two layer cake I sure had a lot of frosting left over.

This cake tasted very similar to carrot cake. The frosting was the best part, it was excellent. I used 1/2 cup honey, and it was not too runny.

Very easy, tasty cake. I didn't have time to peal pears so I used canned pears instead. Was still very moist and light. My only mistake was making just one cake. We ran out before everyone got a slice! The icing was to die for!

Loved this recipe! I had a problem with the frosting though. Even when I chilled it the consistency was still too dripy. Any suggestions to fix this?

Very moist and interesting cake using pears (I used Bartlett). Similar to carrot cake but liked the texture and flavor better. I decreased amount of honey in frosting to 1/2 cup and thought the flavor was perfect. Cooking time for my oven was 35 minutes. For smoother frosting, I would first beat the cream cheese and butter until smooth and fluffy. Then add the rest of the ingredients. I had enough frosting to pipe around the top. Great cake.

Okay, I kept playing with this cake and I found a home for it..between two layers of a creamy white buttermilk cake. I filled the layers with crushed grapes. It was unbelieveable.

I found this recipe easy to make, but it's basically a gingerbread-type cake. With that in mind I decreased the cinnamon and nutmeg by half, added about 3/4 teaspoon of powered ginger and about 1/2 cup chopped crystalized ginger. With an eye on calories and fat, I decided that I would use only one layer (and freeze the other) and use a simple dusting with powdered surgar as a "frosting." For my tastes this simple topping worked better than a heavy cream cheese frosting. Next time - and I will make this cake again - I may try serving this cake with a scoop of lemon or peach sorbet.

This was my first attempt at a layered cake, and it was sucessful! Many of my guests had second helpings. It's a great alternative to carrot or spice cake, and I think it will become a fall tradition for me.

Great cake! I made it last night for today-Thanksgiving 2000... and everyone loved it! Even my husband who kept telling me to make a pie... Next time I make it, I plan to serve it with "Creamed Honey Ice Cream" - (http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=100874)

I don't really like pears however, this recipe looked so good I went out and bought some and made this recipe. I just loved it and so did my family and friends. I made it for a party along with a cheesecake, the cheesecake was left over. I guess that say's it all!

This cake was fabulous and the icing was heavenly! What more can I say.

Oh wow! I used Bartlett pears from my Grandmother's tree. (She had an enormous crop this year.) Anyway this was fabulous...addictive is more like it. I grated the pears and didn't drain them. I wouldn't change a thing about this. I'm tempted to go buy more pears just so I can make this again and again. Wish that we could absolve it of all calories!

This cake was a hit! The honey in the icing adds a nice touch. It's very moist like a carrot cake, and next time I will substitute half of the oil with applesauce. Great recipe.

If you like carrot cake, you will like this cake. It stayed moist until we finished it off after a few days. The lemon frosting is great, I would suggest chopping up the lemon jest into very small pieces to maintain the smooth feeling of the frosting. Other than that, I would not suggest changing anything else with the recipe. You got to try this cake!

This cake was extremely moist and the frosting was soooooo yummy. The honey really gave the frosting a smooth, velvety texture and rich taste. My family devoured this cake and begged for more.
