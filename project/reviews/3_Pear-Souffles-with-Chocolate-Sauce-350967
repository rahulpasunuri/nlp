I bake often although not usually souffles and this recipe is a reason not to. The didn't rise but sank into the ramekins, they went into the garbage, now I am looking for something to do with the chocolate sauce, altho it seems from previous comments this may be tossed as well.

I liked the pear souffle, though mine sank more than I am used to. However, the chocolate sauce is a total miss-match and completely overpowers the delicacy of the pears. A Creme Anglais flavored with some pear brandy would have been a far better match.

The souffle was light with a perfect consistency and taste. I don't attempt souffles too often at dinner parties since they are risky and have to served right away but this one worked well. The hint of pear added a nice touch of flavor, as did the bourbon in the chocolate sauce. Our guests said it was one of the best deserts they have ever had because it is rich and light at the same time and a great compliment to a big meal. I gave it 4 forks but I do have to gripe about making the sauce. As the other reviewer stated it is impossible to make ahead of time and you will end up with a lumpy separated mess when it is reheated. Just make the sauce before you serve, it is super easy anyway.

This recipe is a tremendous disappointment. Souffle itself is bland and rather tasteless. Upon reheating gently the sauce became an extreme thick mass and the fat from the cream seemed to separate out. I used cognac instead of bourbon, but I would be surprised if that was the problem. This recipe should never have been published.
