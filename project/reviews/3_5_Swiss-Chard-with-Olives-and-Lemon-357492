Done with medium leaves (i.e. no giant) rainbow chard and was lovely. To be eaten in small quantities, as it's quite a decided taste. Only, I wished i'd left less time to blanche both the stems and the leaves, as once summed up the sautéing time it was too much ...

Didn't have olives in the house so I subbed pickled capers. Wow! Also threw in some caramelized onions, but it was the capers that gave it the real zing (I've done chard with olive oil and lemon juice for years and it never tasted so sexy!)

This turned out very nicely, though I think I overcooked the chard a little in the water, lost track of time a bit and left it in a minute or two longer than need be. I added extra olives and splashed in some red pepper flakes for a tiny hint of kick. Don't forget how much chard cooks down (I know, duh, but I was amazed at how small the bunches turned out). Anyway, tasty and enjoyed by all at the potluck I made it for.

Made this recipe last night and it was delicious! Unexpected twist with the olives and lemon juice. I found that boiling the swiss chard first helped to cook it up and gave it a nice bright green color, so that when it was added to the pan with the other ingredients it made a nice presentation in color and delicous, too!

Maybe I'm missing something, but where are the quantities listed? Olives prepped how?
