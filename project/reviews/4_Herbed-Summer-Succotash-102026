This dish is superlative. Excellent with the garlic croutons. I was going to leave them out, but they really enhance the dish, adding a nice crunchy aspect.

This is lovely, very summery and fresh. I made this tonight with produce from the farm, substituted parsley for the arugala and didn't add the tomatoes until the corn had cooked for about 5 minutes. I also added some jicama for sweetness and crunch. I plan to try it with soybeans next time.
