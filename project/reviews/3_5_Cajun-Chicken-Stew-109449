Yum! Had been craving my grandmother's chicken (or duck) stew. Went searching for a recipe that could at least be a starting place. Found this one & knew immediately it was the recipe. Oh my gosh, this is so authentic. The only way to make it more authentic is to use a duck you just shot in the marsh. My dad is an Abbeville, LA native. This recipe could have come from my grandmother, if only she had written her recipes down. You've given me back part of my childhood. Will be making a double batch of this next week to take to my parents when family comes to town. Thank you so very much!

I really enjoyed this recipe! It was easy to make, yet took enough time to feel like I was putting "love" into making it. Regarding the previous review...there is no way you can make this recipe without the cayenne so I don't think it's fair to rate it without having used cayenne. I wasn't able to get a whole chicken, so I used chicken breasts and ended up shredding the chicken and that worked out fine. As far as making the roux, it seems like it takes awhile (I kept doubting and wanting to stop) but just keep going until you get a milk chocolate color. Mine took over 20 minutes and at first seemed frothy, but ended up yummy. Next time I'll try this with a whole chicken.

I want to try this one again. I thought that this was fairly bland, but I left out the 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne. I didn't have any on hand, and I figured a 1/4 tsp of hot sauce would add the same kick. Maybe this was a mistake on my part, but we found the recipe to be quite bland and mediocre. One other thing that I noticed is that it says to stir the roux over "moderately low heat" for 15-20 minutes....I stood there for 20 minutes stirring, and my roux was barely caramel colored, I had to increase the heat to medium high and it got to the milk chocolate stage in 3-5 minutes...

This is yummy. Rich flavor. Excellent cajun cooking. Based on reviews I did add an andouille sausage during the last 30 minutes of simmering. This added a bit of heat and flavor. I also added some garlic to the vegies during the last minute of veggie cooking.

I've made twice this exceptional recipe. I served over rice. I used alot of cayenne pepper. It was really very nice and went nicely with white chilled wine. Nevertheless, red wine suits the recipe exceptionally as well. You must try it, do not hesitate!

Good stuff! I used one can of stock and one can of water and added a generous amount of cayenne and a dash of Tabasco at the end. I served in a bowl with a big heap of basmati rice (also made with stock). I love the down home simplicity of this dish!

Love the flavors in this stew. The ingredients are so simple but the stew is delicious.

I added a few sausages, cut in 1" chunks, and browned after the chicken. I also added some tomatoes at the end of the step of softening the vegetables. Why not? I don't know what's meant exactly by "milk chocolate" color for the roux. Is that the color or a Hershey's chocolate bar? Or more like coffee with milk?

This is the real deal. My wife's Grandmother used this same recipe after she had wrung a chicken's neck from the back yard. The only difference is that she used chicken stock rather than water. Done right, with a little more oil for the roux & You will enjoy an excellent meal.

Very good, but the basic recipe for a roux is 1 part oil to 1 part flour. I had to add more oil to compensate. Otherwise it is too pasty.

This is about as genuine Cajun as it gets.....not the nouvelle cajun that became popular in the 80's. I grew up in Southern Louisiana eating chicken stew just like this. I've never liked spicy food, but I did use a bit of Tony Chachere's Cajun Seasoning to it for a bit more authenticity. The only thing I did differently was to add a couple cloves of chopped garlic to the vegetable mixture.

This was great, however I found that I had to add MUCH more oil. The flour was way too cakey with only 1/4 cup.

My boyfriend and I tried this recipe with some healthy, low-fat adjustments and it was still excellent. We replaced the oil-based roux with 1/4 C. water, 2 T. wheat flour and w/ 1 chicken boulion cube (and used 1/2 the salt). We agree that extra cayenne is a must! Enjoy!

Excellent stuff...I was amazed given the simplicity of the ingredients. I did double the cayenne per other recommendations, but it would have been good with the recommended amount, just less kick. Also, definitely brown the roux...I'd never done this before, but the flavor was divine.

Very good, but needs more cayenne pepper. Perhaps 1 tsp. Also, it may not be authentic, but I think it needs a lot more vegetables.

I guess its my turn to expound. This is an AUTHENTIC Cajun recipe. This is what Cajuns grew up eating. Thanks Alexis Touchet.. I am 53 yrs old and learned to cook this from my Grandmere Meya....If one wants to cook a cajun recipe the way the real cajuns grew up eating it, this is one. The two most important things to getting this recipe done correctly are 1. Brown the chicken enough and 2. Get the roux to the chocolate color that Ms. Touchet states. In her position, Ms. Touchet should prepare a Recipe Book for Authentic Cajun Recipes.

I messed up making the roux(cooked at too high a temp), but even so I thought it turned out great. I made it one day ahead as advised. The base ended up being so rich it tasted more like a beef base than chicken. I only had skinless boneless chicken breasts on hand, and whenever I have to make adjustments for lack of chicken fat from the skin, I add butter in it's place. I used chicken broth instead of water for the roux, and I always use course kosher salt when cooking. It has worked wonders for me in terms of flavor opposed to regular salt. I will be making this again, but paying closer attention to the temp when I make the roux. I'm sure it will be even better!

Well, did all that the recipe called for and more; increased the cayenne to 3/4 tsp and it still wasn't enough. Even let the dish rest overnight hoping for the best but the flavor turned out "just so-so". Not worth the time.

Great Louisiana stew! I added salt, red, white, and black pepper to really spice it up...but than, I am cajun.

This is really good, with minor adjustments. The dish needs more cayenne, I used close to a teaspoon. Second, you have to do a proper roux. Third, you have to be generous with the salt. Done like this, it is delicous. Can't comment on the cajun authenticity however, since my entire Louisiana experience can be summed up in one college trip to Mardi Gras....

Ok, this was not good at all. Maybe if you used rabbit rather than chicken it would have been better. Unfortunately though, there is no flavor at all. It tasted like bland chicken supreme. I think this was the worst of many recipes I have made from Epicurious.

Wasn't very cajun other than having pepper, onion, and celery. Thought it was rather bland.

I made this using 1/2 cup of store bought roux to 4 cups of water instead of the 3. I didn't brown the veggies or chicken. I also added 1/2 smoked sausage to chicken and cajun/creole seasoning. This dish was awesome. Everyone loved it.

This dish was very good. I served it with a Penne Pasta. Next time I would add mushrooms, and sundried tomatoes. The flavor was wonderful, and even better the next day!

This was good homestyle cooking. It was not difficult at all - it just requires patience while making the roux. I would probably make it again when I'm craving comfort food.

I thought that this dish was great. Fairly easy to make, and not too much mess afterward. I did add some potatoes and carrots as one reviewer suggested and I thought that worked out really well. Surprisingly, even my six-year-old liked it.

This was really good - my husband and I ABSOLUTELY LOVED it. I gave it 4 forks because, hey, it only involves 5 ingredients! I even left out the cayenne and forgot the green onions but it was still yummy. I'm definitely making this again. I tried eyeballing the amount of oil in the pan after browning the chicken - I thought I had enough but when I dumped the flour in, it got cakey. I poured in more oil at that point and no problem. The only disappointment I had was not having a cold beer on hand while making the roux.

Tasted good over rice. Nothing spectacular for the effort put into this stew.

Love the dish. It's going into my permanant recipie collection. The dish has plenty of flavor already but I'm going to try making it with stock next time to see if I can add even more flavor. Like the recipie says, it definatly tastes better after sitting in the fridge for a day.

Excellent recipe...but my grandmother's recipe adds carrots and potatoes about 45 minutes before it's ready....much better! Delicious even.

Very tasty. I used chicken drumsticks for the sake of simplicity. The meat was extremely tender, literally falling off the bone. I also increased the cayenne pepper because my husband and I like spicy food.

I made this last night, using chicken thighs, and a red bell pepper instead of green. It was delicious--a real keeper! However, after browning the chicken I had to remove fat from the pan rather than add more, probably because thighs have more fat than a whole chicken.
