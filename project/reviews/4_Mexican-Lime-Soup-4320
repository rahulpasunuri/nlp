I used the recipe as a base and ran from there. I added some canned corn, black beans, pureed some canned chipolte chilies and added a splash of orange juice. Whenever I make a mexican soup like this I always add just a touch of dark chocolate, you can never distinctly taste the chocolate but I find it gives it that needed something. Oh yeah and a bit of cumin.

Was served this soup in Mexico with very thinly sliced habaneros on the side. I took one teeny slice and stirred it in the soup for about 10 seconds, then removed it. It gave the soup that extra something that many reviewers have suggested it needs. Want more? Just stir a little longer or add another slice or 2.

This soup is a great beginning for what can be a super delicious soup. Just needed to add those extra goodies that rounded it out. I added corn and cumin. Yummy - will definitely make this again and again. So delicious and healthy.

easy to make, lots of flavor, and easy to amend. certainly a fun recipe and one that anyone can make and look like a hero. Don't serve as an appetizer, this is a full meal. Think of it as Mexican pho.

Very easy and tasty but missing something...I feel like a key spice was missing. Next time, I will add some chili powder and cumin to see if that makes the difference.

I saute a jalapeno pepper along with the garlic, add chili powder and cumin to the oregano, 1/2 cup of lime juice, and frozen corn, and serve the soup with rice. Great flavor, quick and easy, and a regular in our rotation.

I wanted to love this recipe but it was just missing *something* for me. I took the other reviewers' suggestions and added a can of tomatoes, so that might be my fault, but I enjoyed the tomatoes so I'm not sure that's it. I would probably make it again if I was really craving tortilla soup but wanted something a little healthier. I liked it a lot more once I added the cilantro but I can't say I was totally wowed. It was easy, though.

This was excellent. A very surprising and unique flavor. I forgot the tortilla chips, but I wouldve cut corn tortilla into long strips and fried them anyway. This makes for a really nice presentation which is very vibrant with color. Guests were impressed.

Very good, and not too time consuming. I shredded a spit roasted chicken, and used the toasted corn tortilla strips from the chipotle tortilla soup recipe on this site rather than store bought chips (cut corn tortillas into strips, coat with a little veg oil, bake at 375 with a little salt). Yummy!

I LOVE this recipe! The only substitution I make is to replace the crushed tortilla chips with orzo or ebly. Sooo good! I also love that the recipe is flexible- each person can choose their own spiciness level by how much jalapeno they put in their soup. A definite regular in our house!

Yummy, simple, summer soup! I substituted the chx thighs for the breasts, very tasty! I used homemade chx stock and added a can of green chiles which I chose instead of jalapenos since they are not in stores right now... Added a bit more lime juice. Marinated the chx in garlic, salt, pepper and oregano in fridge for 30 minutes prior to making soup... Great use for stale tortilla chips! The soup transported me to Mexico!

Delicious! Made 2/3 of the recipe for 2 people and have about 3 servings left over. Added 1 can black beans (would do 2 next time), 1/2 c lime juivce, and 1/2 tsp cumin & chili powder to broth. Great fresh, light flavors - make sure to use good ingredients!

A delighttful soup. Great 'as-is', except to prevent bitterness, I add the garlic AFTER the chicken is browned 3 minutes, and, just before the liquids go in. Also, other cooks recommendations about adding cumin, red pepper flakes, additional lime juice, black beans are spot on! It is an excellent soup, as-is or augmented.

This is a Mexican version of the Thai Tom-Yum soup--I can't wait to eat the leftovers! I followed the suggestions and added some cumin, black beans, and a can of tomatoes with green chilies also some dried red pepper flakes, and upped the lime juice to give it some extra kick. This soup is completed with cheese quesadillas with cumin, garlic, and cilantro added inside. This soup is a great ethinic soup to make--even on a college budget!

Added corn, cumin, cayenne and coriander -- just delicious. I might saute the garlic a bit longer at lower heat just to infuse it a bit more. Otherwise, so quick and so easy.

I was looking for something other than chicken noodle soup for my cold and found this. It was exactly what I wanted and more. Added extra jalepeno, but not much.

Rating: 4
This was a four fork recipe only after I doubled the lime juice and stirred it in after I took the soup off the heat, so the lime flavour was strong.I also put 3 whole jalapenos, minced, but I like it hot.

I have to say I was a bit skeptical when I read this recipe and even more skeptical when I saw what it looked like while I was cooking...but let me tell you...keep cookin' Sister! Its good! I made this for Easter dinner this past year and my husband's whole family liked it a lot. The secret to the presentation is in the veggies on top...they make it so pretty in the end. And the flavor is great! This is well worth making, and I'm not a soup person!

Good basic recipe but needs a bit of oomph. I added diced tomatoes, cumin, and more oregano. Used chicken thighs which add more flavor, added white corn, and 1/2-3/4 C. white rice. and left out the tortilla chips. Added avocado, jalapenos cilantro, lime juice as suggested. Yum

I loved this soup - it is tangy, flavorful, clean, bright, and healthy. I followed others' suggestions and upped the amount of lime juice to between 1/2 and 2/3 cup, but then I love the flavor of lime. I think this is a great complement to a heavier or greasier entree because of its brightness. Or with some good guacamole you could make a meal of it. Yum.

What a woderful recipe! It's one of those soups that the more you eat it, the more you want some. The toppings are really important to add to the taste of the soup. I especially liked the avocado and the tomatoes. I made this for my boyfriend and it was a hit! I took the leftovers into work, and my co-workers were left wanting more!

This is a wonderful soup. If is very easy to make. The only time consuming part is putting together the toppings which can be done a little in advance. This would be great for a group of people.

I had friends who'd thrown a Mexican party shortly after they vacationed in Mexico, and the soup they served was Mexican Lime Soup. It was wonderful, and I wanted to get the recipe, but it just never happened. I was thrilled to find this recipe here, and it's just as good as -- if not better than -- the soup my friends made. I'll definitely make this again!

Very easy and great tasting soup. We added a can of diced peeled tomatoes to the mix, and used shredded storebought roast chicken which sped up the preparation even more.

Wow. This is without a doubt the best soup I've ever had. It's quick, easy and so awesome. I made it simply for the sake of trying something new and I can definitly say I'll be making it often!

I thought the soup tasted wonderful (with the addition of a little cumin, coriander and cayenne); however, I wasn't too thrilled with the taste of the chicken. I think perhaps grilling half the portion of the chicken and throwing it on top would give it more taste.. Plus, the soup doesn't reheat too well, given that the chicken's texture was really tough the second time around.. But the broth and the add-ons were tasty..

I made this exactly as the recipe called for and it turned out delicious. Even the picky husband liked it!

Delicious and simple to make (but I've got to say I use home-made chicken broth). I've made it several times, both with and without oregano, and it's great either way. As per some of the suggestions below, it's really excellent with corn and beans added, or some lightly sauteed zucchini... This is one of our favorite soup recipes.

Didnt add the Oregano either, but it was real quick, and had a ton of flavor...a definite keeper...definitly crumble the chips in it...

Very tasty and fresh. You have to be ready to go with the garlic once the oil heats... not much time (20 secs) and you need to have it all stirred in or it will scald...and have the oregano and chicken ready to toss in. so you have to have the ingredients measured out before you actually begin cooking.

YUM!!! The only thing I changed was to add more lime to make it more zippy and I didn't add the oregano since I am not a big fan. Very easy to make and nice to eat on a cold winters night.

This is a wonderful soup. I made it, word-for-word, just as the recipe is written. The addition of salt to taste plus an extra squeeze of lime at the end just put it over the top. (note: watch the saltiness of the tortilla chips you use, you could oversalt without knowing it!)

I love this soup and so did my whole dinner party. I was looking for a light soup with a zing. Don't let this simple and easy recipe fool you into thinking it isn't fabulous. I did follow some comments from other people and made a few additions. I added a half teaspoon of cumin and corriander to the broth, used at least 2/3 cup fresh lime juice, a cup of corn, and at the end added 1/2 cup fresh chopped cilantro. The relish is a must along with shredded Monterey Jack cheese. There are so many different variations on this soup you can not go wrong.

I really thought this was too simple to be great, boy was I wrong! My guests raved over it and insisted on the recipe, outstanding! I let it simmer for too long and the chicken was a little dry, next time I'll time it better.

This is my favorite soup for a rainy day, I pass this recipie to all my friends and they all feel the same.

I can hardly believe what a wonderful soup this is considering how easy it is to prepare. To make it even easier, I sometimes use leftover roasted chicken instead of sauteeing chicken breasts. I also prefer to fry my own corn tortillas cut into thin strips. But following the recipe to the letter produces fine results.

I made my own tortilla chips, using both corn and flour tortillas. I sprayed them with pam and sprinkled cumin and salt on them and baked them at 350 for like 20 minutes. I halved the recipe but added almost as much lime juice, and I added cumin in there as well. I then chopped up the avocado, tomato, onions, and I added a jalapeno and made a salsa that I put in the bottom of the bowls along with the chips. It was wonderful and easy

My husband, who is not a big soup eater loved this. I thoroughly enjoyed it also. I took the advice of others and added cumin and chili powder. I also added cheese as a topping. The only thing I am going to change next time is using less oregano. I don't believe oregano is used very often in mexican dishes, at least it wasn't in my home. Nevertheless, it was a great soup that I'll prepare year-round.

Easy, Great flavor and you can improvise and it comes out great anyway! Friends think you went thru allot nd when busy use the store bought broth, YUMBO!

The perfect solution to leftover guacamole ingredients after a party! The addition of chili powder & cumin was necessary and I put a bunch of chopped tomatoes in with the chicken and broth and it worked nicely. I did part of the recipe with 2 chicken breasts, 5 1/2 cups broth, 1 c. tomatoes and it made 4 generous servings. It's going to become a standard whenever avocados are on sale.

Was very good. Didn't put a slice of lime on the side, but next time will because it could have used a little more bite. Husband and kids liked the tortilla soup better.

I made this recipe for a luncheon, and everyone raved about it. I followed the previous comments and added some spices to the soup(cumin, coriander, paprika, chili powder and MSG). Also, I find buying just chicken breasts wasteful. So, I changed the recipe and used 2 whole chickens (same price as the 1 pkg of breasts). I used the extra chicken to make homemade stock for use in the soup, and I shredded the deboned dark chicken meat and used it for soft chicken tacos to eat with the soup with the usual taco accompaniments.

Needs just a little bit of oomph. Previous comments should be followed. Maybe a little chilli powder, or cumin, but still very good.

I made this soup on Cinco de Mayo for my husband's beer club. It received rave reviews! One club member even commented that he thought it was better than anything he had in a mexican restaurant. I combined the avacado, tomato, etc. into a salsa; the acidity in the tomatoes prevented the avacado from browning.

Easy, quick and healthy. We added a medium yellow onion with the garlic. It seems like a big recipe but it really does only make enough for 6 smallish bowls of soup--keep that in mind before cutting it down because you'll probably want more if you're having this as a full meal.

This was a huge hit. I had quite a bit left over, but would not recommend saving unused portions. Lime gives the chicken a horrible after taste. Very easy and completes any mexican theme meal!

This was excellent. I had corn tortillas so I fried them in a little oil and used them. I think that was better than pre-made chips would be. I used fresh oregano.

Wow! I wasn't expecting much, since this soup looked really simple while cooking, but it was really delicious. The addition of the tomatoes and onions without cooking was an added bonus, giving it that garden-fresh taste. I did short the recipe on broth a little, and will still be eating all week - a happy thing!

Made this for a tex-mex themed dinner party and it was superb! Simple, fun to pass around the accompaniments, good start to the meal. Served blue corn chips and chili con queso before the meal with margaritas, then this soup, then ice cold beer and beef & chicken fajitas. Dessert was Flourless Chocolate cake with Cinnamon Whipped Cream. Worked out great!

I liked it because it was good, quick and easy, although the taste somewhat reflected that fact.
