I would consider my self a good cook but not baker. That said this was so easy and turned out fantastic. Was the only dessert that people took second helpings of with many other choices available.

This is a delicious, extremely quick and easy homemade dessert. At the end of a long dinner party prep I almost ordered a cake because I couldn't face cooking desert, but I think this was seriously easier than ordering! Perfect after heavier dinner. Light enough, sweet enough and no one felt like they couldn't move from the table. Nice to serve with a specialty after dinner cocktail or specialty coffee. I had no issue with the caramel to cake ratio, but the sauce is super easy so you can just double it.

I want to give this a 3 1/2 fork rating because everyone at the party I brought it to raved about it. But I, myself, didn't think it was caramelly enough. The cake was delicious... good crumb, good flavor, moist, etc. (So different from cake mix cakes!) I just think I might have to add more brown sugar to up that flavor. It was an easy cake to make and people (including me) like that it's not too, too sweet.

I'm not going to rate this recipe because I made one change that may have been crucial. Instead of using the buttermilk called for, I used 6oz of plain Greek yogurt and 2oz of whole milk. The cake was wonderfully light and airy, but quite dry. If you're thinking of using yogurt instead of the buttermilk, I'd recommend against it.

Rating: 2
The caramel is wonderful and I'll make it again to use as a sauce, but not with the cake.

It turned out that my cake flour had been invaded by a bug, so I had to substitute at the last minute with regular flour. This cake was really very delicious and will certainly make again - next time with cake flour and will be interesting to see how it compares!

The recipe is amazing! Easy to make, and it went over great at a gathering that I brought it to. One reviewer wrote about adding toasted pecans to the top which I will try next time.

I was concerned with the how gummy the batter was before cooking it and even when I mixed it the sugar did not distribute well. So I mixed it again. I was worried I was over mixing it. But the final product was perfection. This cake was a really really good. Moist, light, not too sweet. . . an instant classic!!

Amazing cake! I didn't have a square pan so I used an 8" round springform, baked at same temp & time and it worked just as well. I poked holes in the cake, poured half the caramel sauce on, sprinkled toasted pecans and poured the rest of the sauce. Here in Quebec, the French call it 'Pudding Chomeur' directly translated 'unemployed/unemployment cake' lol. I guess because it's so easy and so few ingredients. It is often served in restos as an alternative to the brownie & ice cream dessert. I lessened the amount of sugar in the cake and made a little extra caramel sauce because it was soo yummy & caramel-y. I served it in a glass pie mould to let it sit in the extra caramel and it did not get soggy, just deliciously moist. Everyone loved it and were scooping up the extra sauce - entire cake was gone within 10 minutes. Will incorporate this into regular rotation.

I could make this cake every week it is just that satisfying. The cake is nice and simple, fluffy and moist. The caramel sauce is AWESOME!! Simple to make and is the perfect flavor. First time I made the cake I cooked the glaze too long, so it was thick on the cake, impossible to get some on each bite of my rather thick cake slice. Second time I made it was for a friend and I poked holes in the cake and made the sauce a little thinner so it oozed into the cake. Unfortunately I didn't get to taste any, but from what I heard it was excellent. I will make another one for my family this week. It is so simple my children could make it and I have all these ingredients almost always on hand - no extra shopping trip needed. This is replacing brownies as our easy, go-to dessert.

I made this cake for a friends retirement party and it wasn't anything special. The glaze didn't taste much like caramel. I wouldn't make it again.

I have been using this recipe for awhile now and I must say yummy. Once I doubled the recipe...A major NO NO. It comes out more like corn bread and the carmel isn't able to moisten the cake. I'm preparing this cake again this Thursday night and I read other reviews I think I'm going to take the suggestion of cutting cake in half pouring some carmel on the lower half of the cake then replacing the top and pouring the remainder carmel! It sounds like a yummy idea.

Rating: 4
YUMMM-O!! This cake is delicious and although it is not super traditional (fluffy wise) it was very moist and delicious. But DONT FORGET TO RAP THE PAN BEFORE IT GOES IN!! I forgot to the 1st time and the centre of the cake rose so much with the air bubles. And i will mention that the caramel is simple and so goood! if you brush the cake once, let it set (for about 35 min) and then brush the cake again with more caramel! Great for bake sales too!!

Oh my goodness, I absolutely love this recipe. The cake was moist and the glaze was the perfect finish. I sprinkled almonds on top, as one reviewer suggested. This recipe is going into my list of favourites!

Rating: 0
Easy, incredibly delicious. In order to further saturate the cake in the caramel topping, I sliced it in half widthwise, removed the top and poured some of the caramel over the bottom layer, then carefully replaced the top and poured the rest of the topping over it. Since friends and family seem to adore the sauce the most, this is a way to get more of it. I also baked this cake in a springform pan with a hole in the middle, so it had a nice look and some of the topping dripped into the inside of the hole left by the pan. Nice!

Rating: 4
I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. The cake was moist and simple to make. My candy thermometer didn't sit in the caramel so I had to keep tilting the pot. My question is...how thick is the caramel glaze? My was pretty thick when I poured it over the cake.

Rating: 3
I made this for my book club meeting when we read "The Help" and they loved the flavor and moist texture of the cake. I poked holes in the cake to let the caramel ooze into the cake. This has a nutty flavor and decorations with pecans made the display of the cake more elegant. Organic eggs made the cake quite yellow in appearance.

Rating: 4
I and my family love this cake - so easy and so delicious. Question, though, for all you chefs out there: my caramel never gets to 210 degrees. What am I doing wrong? I don't have a candy thermometer; I use a regular instant-read thermometer, but it never goes above 170 or 180...

Rating: 4
I think some people have an issue because "cake" to them means a cakey batter cooked and topped with super sweet frosting. This is more like a Mexican milk cake, dense and moist with a subtle caramel flavor and is a HUGE hit at parties. Poke the cake all over the top with a skewer or fork tines just before pouring on glaze and it will soak in. It gets even better several hours after making.

Rating: 4
This is a delicious cake, and easy to make. The 2nd time I made it, I didn't bother with the caramel glaze, but served it with a side of freshly made whipped cream and wild strawberries with rhubarb. Delicious!

Rating: 4
Didn't have cake mix so subsitute with 6/4 cup all purpose flour and 4 TBsp arrowroot (acts like cornstarch but healthier). As for the glaze, instead of corn syrup, i used golden syrup which again, healthier than corn syrup. The only problem was forgot to add salt when making the glaze but it still came out excellent. The cake was very fluffy. moist and light. Cut back on the sugar in the cake ingredient which was good because the caramel glaze was sweet so it was perfect contrast.

Rating: 4
So easy and still decadent. I poked holes in the cake before pouring the caramel so that it would absorb more of the glaze. The glaze filled in the holes so it didn't diminish the look of this delightful dessert.

Rating: 1
I made this cake this morning and the suggestion to use an 8 inch square pan sure didn't work for me. I thought there was too much batter for the pan when I was done mixing and I was correct. The cake puffed up in the oven and then sank as it cooled so that there was a light fluffy layer of cake on top and from the middle on down it was a solid mass - rubbery, dense and inedible. I would try it again but next time I'll use either a 9x13 pan or two round layer pans.

Rating: 3
This cake was easy to make and it was certainly delightful. I did not use buttermilk...instead I used almond breeze original milk and sour cream. It added a slight nutty flavor. My guests LOVED the cake and how I topped it off with thin slices of strawberries and a side of vanilla bean ice cream.

Rating: 3
I double the batch for a dinner party and it was quite heavy like pound cake. I made the mistake of not cooking the caramel long enough so it ended up more like a sauce than toffee. I am going to try it again though because it still tasted great!

Whoever doesn't think this cake is amazing must've not made it right. It was fabulous. As others have said, it's not very pretty, but who cares when it tastes so good? Give it time to let the caramel soak in, and serve it warm with ice cream or whipped cream and you'll have a decadent dessert everyone will love.

Just as the recipe states, this cake looks low key, unimpressive...but the taste...serious yum. There is nothing boring about this cake. It ain't gorgeous, but it's easy and a winner to take to a dinner party.

I was really excited to try this recipe; however, extremely disappointed with the end result. I can't really pin-point exactly what we didn't like about it, maybe it was the cake, definitely was the sauce, and probably was the combination of the two together. Would I recommend this recipe for someone else? No. Would I eat this again? No. What I will do with the left over cake? It will probably head to the compost bin. :( ~~

Meh. It had the texture of cheap cornbread and mild, almost boring flavor. It wasn't BAD, but it was merely okay and I was looking for something more on the lines of awesome.

Made this for book club yesterday and it was the hit of the party. I let the glaze set a bit before pouring it over the perfect little square cake, then sifted powdered sugar over the top. Finally I added roasted, spiced pecans on top. Everyone raved over it and wanted the recipe. Best cake I've ever made.

Rating: 4
This is a delicious, simple cake. The cake has a nice, tender crumb that is just slightly dense. I think this cake would be perfect for a brunch or afternoon tea. The caramel glaze/icing was very delicious. I followed the directions exactly. The only negative is that the cake doesn't look very pretty (since it is one layer, square and light brown), and could use some decoration- or at least a dusting of powdered sugar.

Rating: 4
This is a good cake recipe that is simple to make. If you want a frosting instead of the glaze, just cook the syrup to a slightly higher temp, add a tablespoon of butter and let it cool some. Whip it to a spreading consistency and you've got a good frosting that has a great caramel flavor.

Rating: 3
I made this twice. The first time as very small individual cakes and the second as one cake. Give the cake time for the caramel to soak in. I served it with vanilla ice cream to cut the sweetness. I would make it again but always serve it with something. Otherwise it was too sweet for my taste.

Rating: 4
This cake is truly fabulous, so tender and tasty. It must be fairly foolproof because I made the following two substitutions and it worked perfectly: Used regular all purpose flour, but 4 tbls less than what's called for (heard that can be a substitute for cake flour) and used soy milk with a tbl of white vinegear instead of the buttermilk. Really came out delicious, I used a different caramel glaze (no heavy cream) but I think next time I won't glaze at all the cake was so good on its own.

Rating: 4
WOW!!!! I took another reviewer's recomendation and sprinkled about a 1/2 cup of toasted sliced almonds on the top (some before, some during and some after drizzling the caramel on top) and this cake was OUTSTANDING! Not too sweet, not too gooey, just perfect. It's hard to believe that something so simple was SO good. The almonds definitely made the dish. Also made it more aesthetically pleasing. I will make this again.

Rating: 3
While I did not use the cake recipe provided, the caramel glaze was absolutely fabulous. I used a white butter cake with a simple buttercream between the two layers, and soaked the top with the glaze. Reactions of guests varied from gasps of delight to asking how much was left so they could take some home.

Rating: 4
This cake is awesome. I used a 9" round spring form and it worked fine. I also did the double sift of the cake flour and got a cake with small tender crumb. Amazing texture. I also used Lyle's Golden syrup instead of corn syrup in the glaze because I like the flavor of it better. 3 days later I ate the last piece and it was still just as yummy as the first day. I accidentally baked this at 325 for the first 15 minutes or so, then bumped the temp up to finish. Took a bit longer but the cake's texture & moisture level couldn't have been more perfect. One of the best cakes I've ever made, hands down.

Rating: 3
This cake was pretty good. There was not enough caramel flavor- my sister suggested next time cutting the cake in half, glazing both halves, and then assembling it back together, so that there was a middle layer of caramel. I'll probably double the recipe of the caramel glaze, because without it this cake would be boring. However this cake is still quite tasty.

I have been searching for the ultimate dense, intensely caramel-flavored cake and this is not it. It is not bad but the cake is on the light side and turned out a little dry for me. Also, the frosting is a caramel sauce, not really an icing (but very good).

I made this delicious little square cake for my family on Thanksgiving this year. I baked the cake the night before and kept it in a gallon ziplock bag at room temperature overnight... glazed it right before we sat down for dinner. It was amazing. Finished it that day.

Its excellent cake, second time I made it. Two only things I'll do extra is shifting the flour twice. Once after measuring and second is shifting with other dry ingredients. The second is I used a bundt cake pan instead of square pan. It became very fluffy.

so light and delicious. I especially love the caramelized crust that forms on the top of the cake. It's almost a shame to glaze it. I ate some the day of...amazing. Then I refrigerated it (unglazed) for a day and a half, and some of the amazingness wore off.

Normally, I agree with the popular opinion but not this time. The cake is fine - it's easy to make, moist but not remarkable. The caramel is caramel. Together - its good but still not much more than the sum of the parts and I would not make this again.

I really liked this cake but didn't have ingredients in house to make caramel, so I just glazed it with confectioners sugar mixed with orange juice. Thought it was delicious and most. Looking forward to making it again with the caramel.

This cake was made under less than stellar conditions for baking/making caramel, yet still came out great. Although it was profoundly hot and humid in my kitchen, the cake rose appropriately, was a nice consistency and the caramel icing was easy. The cake is not overly sweet and is nicely complimented by the very sweet caramel. I think for certain crowds who desire very sweet desserts, having extra caramel sauce is a nice idea.

This cake is great! It was light, moist, and not too sweet. If you let the glaze chill for a short time in the fridge, it will become more frosting-like, which lends itself well.

Rating: 2
I forgot to add - the cake DID take much longer to bake than stated - more like 45-50 minutes in an 8" square pan. I followed a previous reviewer's suggestion about poking holes into the cake in hopes that some glaze would seep into the cake - which didn't work out for me.

Rating: 2
The cake and glaze are effortless to make. It's a simple, satisfying dessert - nothing spectacular. Perhaps the best thing about this recipe is its versatility. Lots of directions you can take with it. Here's what I did to dress up the taste and appearance: I made a second batch of the glaze, right before serving, plated each individual cake serving with sliced, fresh strawberries, then drenched (or drizzle) the cake & fruit with WARM glaze. The extra glaze is great for dipping those pieces of cake that weren't lucky enough to be the outer, caramel-coated edges. Big thumbs up from both picky kids & adults.

Although this recipe was easy I can't say that I loved it. It sounded much better then is was. I thought the caramel was the best part although it was very thin and I made it twice because I thought I had made a mistake the first time. Good but wont need to make this recipe again.

My 9 yr. old made this cake pretty much by himself. It was quick, easy and delicious. We were a little low on butter, so I substituted coconut oil (thick stuff from a jar) for 1/2 of the butter called for. I am not sure if that made the texture any different or not, but it had a great, dense, moist texture. I am trying out the coconut oil after reading that it has "good fats". I Like the idea of adding almonds next time under the glaze!

This is a simply, fabulous cake, but I'm a sucker for caramel. I made it in a 9" round pan and had to bake about 48 minutes. I doubled the caramel and kept the heat on med to low (high makes it boil over). Also, I cooked it for about 25 minutes and let it cool/thicken a little before pouring on cake. I sprinkled a small handful of toasted, sliced almonds under the caramel on the cake and poof! Not a plain cake anymore!

Great cake. Similar to one of childhood memories from a bakery in Jackson, Missisippi. Best when baked in loaf pan til edges separate from pan slightly. Cool and cut into three layers. Double icing and pour over each layer quickly before it sets. Don't have a candy thermometor, cook til just starts to thicken on the spoon when lifted up, just before begins to string and still separates when dropped into cold water, just before soft ball. Can't substitute with half and half or milk. Double vanilla in icing, good

Delicious cake, but had some problems. It completley sunk in the middle. I live at 5,000 ft. and never have to adjust recipes, but I think the unusually high amount of baking soda in the batter is what killed it. The texture was not "light" at all, but very moist with a large, dense crumb. Yummy. Water boils at 212, the glaze is not water and therefore boils at a lower temperature. I cooked mine for about 12 minutes. Problem was that it was so bubbly, the whole thing was hard to manage, I guess I didn't stir very well so at the end when I put the vanilla in and stirred off the heat, some of the dark bits on the bottom of the pan made my glaze look speckled. So this wasn't pretty, yet it tasted fantastic and will make again.

This cake has the taste of a maple glazed donut. The cake itself was easy to make, I made it the day before, then poked holes in the cake to absorb more of the liquid. Everyone really loved it, but I thought it was too much work for such a cake. It wasn't light but instead a little spongy. We all loved the extra glaze and poured it over the slices of cake, it made the presentation more fun.

This cake was very easy to make and turned out perfectly. The crumb was delicate and moist and the caramel topping very good (I agree with a previous reviewer who said that it didn't need to boil for anything like as long as the recipe suggests. Mine came up to the required temperature much faster.) Sadly, the plus factors didn't add up to a very exciting end product. The cake part just wasn't that interesting and the glaze - although good - didn't make up for it. I wouldn't bother making it again. There are too many other good recipes to try.

Rating: 3
This cake was very easy and tasted a little dry and bland--but I am pretty picky. If I made it again I would make holes in the cake for the caramel to sink into. The caramel tasted great, but was more like a sauce than a glaze or an icing. Also I don't quite get the boiling for 10-12 min. until the temperature gets to 212. Boiling temperature is 212 so I just boiled it at 212 for 10 min.

I could eat this cake until I'm sick and still want more! Very easy, very delicious. I didn't leave the cake on the rack to pour the caramel over, but did so after placing cake on plate - the extra caramel just puddled at the edges and was fine. My nine-year- old plated servings with fresh blackberry syrup; I prefer a little cloud of whipped cream on the side!

I had high expectations for this recipe - didn't come close. Each of my family ate a small piece but they were disappointed as well. The texture couldn't be described as "light" and the flavor was average. I live at a high altitude so that could account for the undesirable texture but still the flavor of the cake was average. The caramel sauce helped but not enough for me to try it again. The cost of the ingredients and the time and effort were not worth the bother for me.

This is the first cake I've baked. I baked it for my wife's pre-birthday :-). She's a great baker so I was quite curious to see her reaction. We both found this cake delightfully light. The caramel glaze could make one a caramel addict. As for the baking experience, the only things I noticed were that the cake took about 10 minutes longer to bake - that appears to be a problem with our oven I'm told - and it takes some practice to wield a candy thermometer. I (we) absolutely will make this again.
