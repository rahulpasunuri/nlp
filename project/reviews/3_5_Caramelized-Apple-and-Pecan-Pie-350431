Super! I pretty much followed the recipe, but took other reviewers's advice and only just brought the syrup to the boil before adding the apples (which were sliced thinner than 1/4s) and baking. I didn't have any orange juice, nor oranges, so just used ice water for the dough; not sure if you'd be able to taste it anyway. I didn't have a big enough pie dish, so used a glass tart dish instead, which the recipe just about fit into, although there was some drippage. I anticipated this and caught it in a tray placed on the next shelf below. The drippings made for a tasty preview of the pie, which we started on the following night, served with whipped cream. I stopped myself at a third serving, and the next night when I asked my housemate if he wanted pie, he replied "Only a massive slice please". The apples really do balance the sweetness, and the pie wasn't cloying the way some pecan pies can be. Bake this!

This was terrible. I followed the recipe to a tee but it came out like soup. I am furious.

I have loved this one, I add pears to it, sweet ones for a different texture.

What a pie! Incredibly rich and indulgent. It does require more time than the typical apple or pecan pie. Caramelizing the apples is the longest part. But so worth it. The caramel is divine, and makes for a super-rich filling in the end. It was a huge hit at our Thanksgiving table, and have had multiple requests for the recipe.

Cooking brown sugar does not create a caramel flavor, it created a strong molasses flavor, which no one in my family likes. That alone killed the recipe for me, but then when quite a bit of the liquid overflowed from the pie and burned in the bottom of my oven, I ended up with a beautiful pie that tasted like smoke. Since I don't like molasses, I think next time I will add some apples to the karo pecan pie recipe.

This is good, but very rich. Needed more apples.

this is the best of both worlds - apple pie AND pecan pie - it is ABSOLUTELY delicious - don't change a thing from the recipe, other than perhaps using a store bought crust if you're feeling lazy.

i was amazed that so many had few if any problems with this recipe as I was unable to produce much more than some burnt apples in burnt caramel sauce. I attempted to make this pie, as tarte tatin is my ultimate favourite dessert, but was sorely disappointed by it. I tried following the recipe to a tee but found that my caramel burned too quickly to even allow me to bake the apples in the oven at all. Perhaps in my own kitchen, i would've had superior results to cooking in another's kitchen. Keep that in mind in the future all!

GREAT RECIPE! EASIER THAN IT LOOKS! FOR FLAVOR IT DOESN'T GET MUCH BETTER! A PINCH OF NUTMEG & CINNAMON DIDN'T HURT. EVERYBODY LOVED THE BALANCED SWEET/PECAN/APPLE COMBO.

This was AWESOME. I had too many other things to prepare for Thanksgiving dinner, so I opted to use a frozen pillsbury crust. You couldn't even taste the crust, there were so many other flavors going on. This was the biggest hit of Thanksgiving.

OK so i thought oh pecan pie and apple pie what a great idea. I had some issues with how it looked in the picture i wanted people to almost be surprised by the apples. i baked them in the oven less time and then cut them up before i put them into the pie shell. It was still unappealing looking at it but it looked better but the taste was just weird. Not really a fan and would attempt making it again but still not the way they made it.

This was the first pie I ever made. I am my friends say an excellant cook but not a baker. However...this pie was fabulous. It was totally incredible and very easy to make...I used premade Marie Callendars frozen pie shells. I think I will try Granny Smith apples next time. But yes it was easy and wonderful

I made this pie as a change from the expected pumpkin pies for Thanksgiving. It was really simple to put together and had a great taste but was a little bit sweet for me. I did change up the way the apples were presented. I sliced them as for pie, followed the recipe for carmelizing and placed them in a pinwheel pattern on top of filling. It presented beautifully and was a hit with several of my grown children. I would make this pie again.

WOW!!! All I can say is...what a pie. I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was a BIG hit. It took me a couple of hours to make, plus I let it cool for a few hours, so I recommend that you make this the day before if possible. This is a recipe even a novice like me can make...just follow the directions.

I made this pie along with a pumpkin cheesecake for Thanksgiving and it was fabulous. I only changed one item in the recipe which was to double the amount of pecans. First, because we love toasted pecans and second, I've never been a fan of pecan pie because I thought them to sweet. I felt that the pecans would help cut down on the sweetness. I was intitally attracted to this recipe as well because Tarte Tatin is also one of our favorite desserts and this combined it and a traditional pecan pie. I will 100% make this again next year, it was that good.

Made the pie for this TG. For those that had it the comments were very good. I believe you should serve this with whipped cream. As for the crust-yes it was bland-but I do think you needed that blandness to reduce what some reviewers think of the filling-that it is too cloying. I also agree with another reviewer, that you are better off eating this pie on day 2 or day 3. It was better.

This is the pie I prepared on Thanksgiving Day for the non-pumpkin eating crowd. I thought it would be a great combination of two of our favorite pies. The crust was great and the filling was tasty, but rather sweet. It would have been easier to make one traditional apple pie and one traditional pecan pie. I thought this recipe was labor intensive for the results.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving at it was very well received. I did not think that it was too sweet, certainly not by the traditional pecan pie's standards. I did find that filling did not set completely, something I attribute to two things. One, I believe that the apples that I used were a little larger than expected in the recipe and contributed more juice to the filling. In future attempts I would reduce the caramel after removing the apples in order to reduce the amount of liquid in the filling. Second, I used a ceramic pie dish rather than glass which may have contributed to the slower cooking time. I am not sure as to how differently the ceramic conducts heat than pyrex, but there could be a difference. I also noticed that the filling was a bit gray, a condition that I'd also attributed to a longer than expected cooking time. I also felt that the corn syrup flavor was too far forward, and might reduce or eliminate that altogether. In the future, I'd make the following changes : 1. After cooking the apples, reduce the caramel on the stove top until it thickens. 2. Reduce 1-1/2 cups apple cider to a thick syrup and use that to replace some or all of the corn syrup. 3. Increase the oven temperature to 365. The goal would be to increase the apple flavor, reduce the cooking time, and get the pies to set more quickly while still browning the crust.

My friends and family loved how the apple soaked up the pecan filling, and the way the buttery crust played against the pecans. A winner!

Tried this for the first time @ T-giving, expecting a good combo with the tart apples and sweet pecan filling. While everyone raved, I thought the filling was an odd color (greyish brown??) and I would have liked the apples throughout the pie. I will try again. Crust was flaky and yummy, I am surprised at all of the negative comments about it! Did you use the food processor as recommended? It helps to blend the fat w/o melting it....very important for a flaky crust. I liked other recommendations of using orange zest as well, will try.

I made this recipe exactly as described and will change a few things if/when I make it again. I love pecan pie, apple pie and homemade caramel but the combination of all three in one pie just didn't work for my family. The flavor of the apples after being cooked in the caramel sauce and then cooked in the pecans wasn't a benefit to the overall dish; though the flavor that the apples imparted to the caramel sauce was really nice. The pecan portion was the best ever tasted by some die-hard pecan pie lovers at our house. Next time I'll leave the apples out of the finished pie but will cook them with the caramel for flavor. I also used my own crust recipe.

This is a nice alternative to pecan pie, it is a bit sweet, but typically pecan pie is. I thought the crust was great and will use for other pie recipes!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it including those who normally do not like pecan pie. I used my own crust and rome apples. It was delicious!!!!

This recipe just doesn't cut it: even after reducing the sugar by more than one-third and the butter by half, it is too heavy, with an unfavourable ratio of apples to filling. If I were inclined to experiment further with this, I'd try it again in a 12 or 13 inch tart pan and with twice the apples. My suggestion to the authors of the recipe: take it back to the test kitchen and improve it!

Rating: 4
We were thrilled with this pie. We did not test the pie crust because we already had one ready to go. Like another reviewer, I used maple syrup instead of corn syrup and appreciated the mellow sweetness that resulted. We used Rome apples with great success. Very great recipe we are already talking about making for Christmas as well!

Yum Yum Yummy! This was the first desert to go--no leftovers :( Did not use the crust, looked beautiful--just like the picture. Everyone wants me to make this again for Christmas. May try apple slices instead of quarters, but the nice big chunk of apple was very good with the pecans.

Rating: 3
Overall good pie although I wasn't completely faithful to the recipe. I used my own pie crust and instead of preparing the apples as listed I simply sauteed them in butter with some cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg. Not only did it cut down on the overall sweetness of the pie but it also cut down on the prep time significantly. I fanned out the apples in a spiral pattern for more of a decorative look. Everyone loved it- including two guests who don't care for pecan pie normally. Will definitely make again, probably with a cookie crumb or graham cracker crust.

This was sooo rich and delicious! The apples and pecans are a nice combination and just melt in your mouth. I used a different crust recipe that called for 2 tsp. vodka that made the crust oh so light and flaky. Next time I might cut the apples a bit smaller and arrange them overlapping. While this pie is delicious, I thought the presentation with apple quarters could have been better.

A Cook from Roswell, I have not made this pie yet, but I just made a pear pie and it was much like an apple pie--the spices, the firmness of the fruit when baked, etc., so I suspect you can just make a straight substitution.

I have made this twice. Once as presented to practice for Thanksgiving and now actually for Thanksgiving. I did not like the chunks of apple when leaving the apples in quarters. It looks much better with the apples sliced and fanned. I decreased the cooking time afer turning them since the slices will be smaller for the long pie cooking time. Very good and the apples break up the sweetness that can be over powering with traditional pecan pie.

Beautiful pie! I made it 2 days beforehand and it didn't taste too sweet. I used brown sugar instead of white sugar. The crust was nice too. It was a nice change to have the appls and pecans.

Very Good! Seems time-consuming however, for one that takes 3-hrs to make dinner - it all just fit in, time-wise. The only think I changed was using my own fav. pie-crust recipe - I ended up making 2 and will freeze 1 for next week. Will let you know if it freezes well.

I thought this pie was delicious! I wasn't crazy about the crust, so the second time I made it (only a week later- my husband insisted) I used my own crust. The apples are a really nice contrast to the sweetness of the pecans.

I think this pie has potential, but I was underwhelmed on the whole. It's just too darn sweet. And though any pecan pie is sweet, I think it's the mix of sweeteners that does this pie in. You've got the caramel, corn syrup, and white sugar all mixed together and the overall effect is heavy (and not in a rich way). The effort involved in putting this thing together merited a better result.

OK, I commented earlier on this pie (cook from FL.) At first, I didn't love it, and definitely didn't think it worth the effort to make again. HOWEVER, after letting it sit for a few days, I had another piece. It was DELICIOUS this time around. I don't know if it just needed 3 days to meld together or what. All others who waited a few days to eat it also thought the aging helped its flavor.

OK... I cheated. I used store-bought pie crust.... (I was in a HURRY!!!!) I loved it, but my husband didn't... he's a purist when it comes to pecan pie, so he didn't like the addition of apples. This was right up my alley, though, I like twists on the traditional. I'd make it again, for a Thanksgiving pot luck or something....

Comment - note butter/shortening in grams. Polish butter does not come in sticks. Pie was another clean plate success. Pecans came from USA government source in Italy.

We thought this was very good. I can't usually eat more than half a tiny sliver of pecan pie because it's too sweet and rich for me. After one piece of this, I was ready for another one! I think cooking the apples in the syrup really mellows out the pecan part of the pie and gives it great flavor. Since an earlier reviewer mentioned the crust burning, I kept a close eye on mine. It was browned after about 25 mins and I put a pie shield over it. I didn't have any problems with the crust or find it dry. We thought it was flaky and delicious, though the orange flavor didn't really come though. I like an earlier reviewer's idea of adding orange zest to the dough.

I made this pie using my own crust recipe. I added a little whiskey to the pecan mix, which worked well. Overall, it was way too sweet for me, but my boyfriend loved it. I'm still waiting for the verdict from everyone else who received part of the pie.

I made this pie as a trial run for Thanksgiving. All the guests I served loved the pie but I agree with an earlier review that the crust did not add anything special to the recipe. I will use my own crust recipe next time. The apple/pecan combination cut the richness of an all-pecan pie and added flair to an all-apple pie. This pie will be on our Thanksgiving table.

I made this recipe for a dinner party and I was not happy with it. I believe the main failing of this recipe may lie with the pie dough. I tried it twice and on the first attempt the crust burnt and on the second attempt the crust was cooked but the filling was slightly under cooked. The orange juices sugar content may have been the problem. Maybe, for the orange flavour, a standard pastry with orange zest would work better. The pecan filing was tasty but not exceptional

I went apple picking this weekend, so now I have too many apples that I need to figure out what to do with. My friend and I saw this in BA and thought it looked incredible so we decided to try it. It is amazing - a great fall pie and fairly simple to make. I was short on time so I cheated and used a frozen pillsbury crust, which was OK but definitely next time I'll make the crust from scratch.
