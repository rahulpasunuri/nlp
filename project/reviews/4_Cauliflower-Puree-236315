Major YUM. Serve on the plate with beef filet and charred onions.

This was delicious! I added rosemary, thyme and lemon zest at the end, and baked the entire dish for around 20 minutes on low temp to get it a bit crispier.

So easy and so good! I made it exactly as per the recipe and it was perfect.

This basic recipe is wonderful as stated or can be used as a launching point for the more adventurous. I added parmesan cheese and it was fantastic (not terribly adventurous, I admit). Next time will probably give it more of a "smashed" consistency, rather than the pureed, and play with flavors. Either way, this is a great recipe!

Terrific! Followed the recipe, & added a little cayenne pepper. Hubby scarfed it up. Next time I'll use an immersion blender & maybe less water (not that I used that much anyway!) Love cauliflower, & this is a great substitute for mashed potatoes.

Wow! So simple, so good! Unbelievable that I have never tried this before. This time I followed recipe as printed but look forward to adding other simple ingredients to see what works and what doesn't. I believe I will try just a little fresh parsley next time. Recommend for everyone, my teenagers, who are pickier than two year olds, liked it too.

This was delicious and so easy. Who knew that a few ingredients could taste so good. I only used 3/4 to 1 Tbsp of butter and it tasted really buttery.

This was a great recipe :) used my rice cooker to steam the ingredients with chicken broth and added a bit of lemon juice, yum!

This is ridiculously good and easy -- it's our family's favorite way to eat cauliflower. No butter even necessary!

Oh my god! Fantastic! Thanks Ted! We pared Cauliflower Purée with Pan-Seared Tuna with Ginger-Shiitake Cream Sauce with (look it up on Bon Appétit | February 1999 Circa, Philadelphia PA). We just added yellow curry powder, parmesan and coconut milk instead of cooking liquid. That was amazing. I will definitely do it again. Easy. Quick. Healthy. Light. Creative. Lovely. Like high cuisine restaurant entree's side dish.

Go Ted Allen! This is a great low-carb alternative to mashed potatoes. They come out exceptionally smooth and creamy. I sometimes throw in a clove or two of garlic during the steaming process. This has definitely become a staple at my house.

Definitely use a blender NOT a mixer like you would with potatoes. A blender gets it nice and creamy and smooth. could probably notch back the butter a Tb or so. I added about a 1/4 soy milk and they were a little too creamy... hence will go about half the butter next time and use the soy milk to compensate. One clove of raw garlic added to the blending stage was delicious. A definite go-to recipe over potatoes... can't tell the difference! Seriously, not even my bf, the potato addict could tell a difference... he loved them!

Wow! The technique really elevates the ingredients. Added 2 cloves garlic to steamer & pureed with rest. Best cauliflower ever. But did NOT like addition of parmesan cheese; thought it was better without it. Mr. Meat Eater thought it was pretty good for a vegetable. (That's high praise.)

This was SOOO good, added some roasted garlic and parmesan. Used an immersion blender to make things easier, worked out perfectly.

i love this recipe. couldnt be easier, a yummy way to eat a lot of cauliflower that's pretty good for you (ok, except the butter, but there's gotta be SOMETHING in there to make it good!)

This is a fabulous way to prepare cauliflower, and a great, low-carb substitute for mashed potatoes. I halved the buter, then added two cloves of garlic and a handfull of shredded parmesan which gave it a bit more pizazz. I'd give it three forks as written, but (perhaps boastfully) four forks as modified.

This is good and easy. Added Penzy's Parisian Bonnes Herbes, winged it with the butter, used rice milk for the liquid. Oh so good.

Nice and simple recipe and a good use of cauliflower. The kids will never know it's not mashed potatoes. ;-) Added parmesan because cheese is my bacon. Also topped with fresh parsley for some color.

Because of religious dietary restrictions I couldn't use butter or other milk products in this recipe (it was being used as a side for a meat course), so I used some chicken schmaltz (fat). I don't know how this dish tastes with butter, but with chicken fat and a pinch of indian curry it is outstanding. Better than mashed potatoes!

Great recipe! I used about 1/4 cup liquid and added 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano for extra flavor.

This is a lot of butter for a single cauliflower head but it was fabulous. Husband is not a big fan of this vegi at all but loved it prepared this way.

I agree, use a masher or hand blender..forget adding in steamer liquid..no need. Make it easy on yourself..Simply steam , and mash in butter, salt and pper and whatever else you love..and enjoy!

My cousin's favorite and requested for T-Day..delicious!! Sprinkled paprika on the top and will have to make a 2nd batch since it was GONE!!

Added minced scallion and a bit of parmesan. Used my immersion blender rather than food processor and did not need to add any steaming liquid. Much easier clean-up, too. This recipe made cauliflower more than acceptable, which is saying something since I really do not like it at all.

Rating: 3
I've been cooking Cauliflower in a similar way for years, in less time with less clean-up. Forget the food processor or blender. Cook in 1/2-1" of liquid / your choice. When done, remove remaining liquid the same way you would if boiling potatoes, but reserve liquid in a bowl. Add butter/spices to pot, use potato masher. Add reserved liquid as needed, or use warm cream or milk whatever you like. Comes out creamy with a little texture. endless combinations to spice it up. 3 forks, because my way is easier!

I used chicken broth, added an onion and fresh corn, thickened with greek yogurt and sprinkled with parmesan. excellent.

I used chicken broth, as another person said. Next time I won't put in so much liquid at the end.

This was delicious, and my guests loved it especially. I added a bit of cream to make it more of a mash than a puree, and sprinkled with shaved parmesan, gray salt, and just-ground pepper. After enjoying a few bites, the friends dining with me desecrated it by adding lots of cayenne pepper sauce, but deemed it the "perfect palate" for the stuff (which they drizzle on almost everything!) It accompanied herb-crusted lamb and sauteed chard. I was definitely encouraged by the suggestions on here, and would happily try again with chives and sour cream, saffron, even bacon.

Try these additions to this recipe. Instead of water, steam the cauliflower in chicken stock, than while you are blending the butter, salt and pepper, add in a couple of tablespoons of blue cheese dressing. Wow...what an amazing taste with the added blue cheese. It gives the cauliflower puree a creaminess and the taste of the blue cheese is amaing.

I just tried a spinach cauliflower puree recipe in Bon Appetit's last month issue and dumped it. Found this one in a pinch. Thank goodness! It is delicious. Saved my Passover.

I just made this for my husband who can be a bit picky with his veggies and is not a fan of potatoes but he loved this! I decided to roast the cauliflower insted of steam it (was just easier for me), used nonfat milk instead of the water and only added about half the butter. Was delicious and I can't wait to try it with some of the other recommended add ins!

Excellent. I braised the cauliflower in milk instead of steaming it. A keeper!

So easy to make and delicious. We added 2 cloves of garlic sauteed in about a tbsp of olive oil and sub'd Smart Balance for the butter (2 tbsp). Used 2% milk instead of water thanks to other reviewers - used only 1/4c and it was bordering on too thin for our tastes (will start with 1/8c next time). Can't wait to try this with dried mustard or wasabi!

My husband is not a cauliflower fan, but really likes this. It's so versatile & a nice alternative to potatoes--much lighter. We've made it once with Penzey's Fox Point seasoning and another time with wasabi. Both were delicious.

This is delicious, but I didn't add any liquid whatsoever. Used vegan margarine and truffle salt to season. Everyone thought it was mashed potatoes! I can't imagine adding all the liquid this recipe calls for, as the cauliflower itself has enough moisture.

I bet this is pretty good as written, but with a couple minor mods, its one of the best things i've ever eaten. i added about 1/4 cup milk instead of the water, only 2 tbs of butter, a pinch of saffron and the piece de resistance, about 2 tsp of white truffle oil. you can get anything better at the best restaurants.

This is very nice.I didn't use butter but used a low cholesterol substitute and it was still marvelous.Would be amazing with real butter.Very easy,but had to puree for quite a while and use ALL of the 3/4 cup water.It is the perfect substitute for anyone avoiding potatoes.

Just made it for breakfasts this morning. Excellent! Especially since I used what my daughter and I refer to as the "good butter" - small batch from farmer's market. I've seen Hubert Keller put this puree in cleaned out eggshells with a littler caviar on top. Very elegant first course at Fleur de Lys.

Excellent

I made this exactly as written except instead of adding water, I added about 1 cup of nonfat plain yogurt. My entire family, including two very picky young boys, loved this recipe. My kids like it much better than mashed potatos, and I think this is by far the easiest recipe to prepare an entire head of cauliflower that I've ever found. Thanks also, for explaining how to core the cauliflower. Sadly, I'd never figured that out on my own!

This was fabulous...we love roasted cauliflower, but we've recently had it pureed at a number of restaurants and I fell in love with the idea. I added some saffron and two teaspoons of cumin, and it was to die for.

This is a wonderful alternative to mashed potatoes. I served both at Thanksgiving. The traditionalist loved their potatoes, but the epicurians at the table thought the cauliflower was much better. This low carb dish is better for diabetics, too.

Great, and super easy! And I only used about half as much butter. Really nice light, silky consistency. Went great with some goat cheese and basil stuffed chicken breasts for a light, but seemingly decadent, dinner.

My experience of this recipe was that the initial 1/4 cup of liquid was slightly too much. Did not add more after that. I steamed the cauliflower (not boiled)as the recipe said. Also threw in a couple of garlic cloves as another reviewer suggested. Next time I will start with a couple of tablespoons of liquid and go from there. Will definitely make this again. Three of us polished off the whole head of cauliflower. So yummy, nutritious and low-carb. I've never eaten cauliflower because of the way it looks more than anything...like brains. :) This recipe has given me a way to enjoy this vegetable.

I made this for thanksgiving this year and it was an instant hit. I made it again, but a little more low fat: added vegetable stock for flavor, and used only 2 tsps of light butter. My boyfriend liked it better the healthier way! Will definitely become a staple in my kitchen.

I first tried this recipe while on the south beach diet, and absolutely love it. Thet texture is much lighter than mashed potatoes, and I actually prefer this now over the heavier potato version. When steaming, I also throw in a few whole garlic cloves to steam and puree with the cauliflower. Very flexible side dish with little guilt. Even non-veggie lovers are shocked when I tell them what they're eating. It's become a staple in my kitchen.

I would definitely make this again and again and again. Beware of other recipes that use cream cheese instead of butter - they are bland and lifeless. I doubled the recipe, made ahead, added roasted garlic and good parmesan cheese, and zapped it in the micro before serving. It tasted fantastic with flank steak and salad.

I often make this recipe. I don't add in any extra moisture, just puree it right out of the steamer, still dripping. Also i sub 1 tbl of cream cheese for some of the butter and add minced garlic. excellent.

My husband and I make this as a side quite often.....it's so similar in texture (and even taste) to mashed potatoes, but with way less carbs and calories...it's on the South Beach Diet as well....we love it
