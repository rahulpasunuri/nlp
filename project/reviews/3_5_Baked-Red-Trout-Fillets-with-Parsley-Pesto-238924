My neighbor gave me a freshly caught Rainbow Trout!! I followed the recipe, adding pepper,garlic, dill, and basil pesto. I put the pesto in the cavity, and seved the pesto with the Trout too. I grilled the Trout in foil. Served the Trout with galic/lime carrots and saute'ed eggplant with Tre Citrus Balsmaic Vinegar. Will make this again, and I may always serve fish with pesto!!

this was delicious. pesto could top any fish and it would be great. i used less oil as recommended and was happy with how it came out. big fan of this one!

A full garlic clove is overpowering, use half a clove. And I decided on only 1/2 cup of oil. It was ENOUGH, trust me. You have to salt to taste... and stir in a tad more lemon juice for more tang in the end. This went great on raviolis by the way.

Okay, but the pesto had way too much olive oil. If I did it again, I'd try adding 1/4 cup of oil, tasting and going from there. I'd up the amount of walnuts as well.

this is a very quick and easy recipe. I use Steel Head Trout and it is great. I like fish a little more cooked, so I cook it for 18-20 minutes.

OMG. Wife was not as impressed, but than again, she would never purchase fish to cook for a meal. I used a jalapena, that was all I had, in the pesto and it was a hit. Served with steamed brocolli and salad with wine vinegar olive oil and ground red, white, green, pink and black pepper dressing. Total cooking and prep time was about 45 minutes. Another night of no driving to a restaurant, waiting for the waiter, ordering, waiting, finishing, waiting, paying and driving home(if we do the waiting, why do they call them waiters?)

I read the prior comments and reduced the oil in the pesto to 1/2 cup. I used canned chipotle in adobo sauce, dried the pepper with a paper towel, and seeded it. I used fresh Lake Superior Steelhead, which is a rainbow trout that has lived in Lake Superior and become more like a salmon in appearance and taste. Yum!

the sauce was a little unctuous, I would suggest upping the lime and reducing the oil. very easy. will do again.

I thought this was wonderful, and really easy, but nutritious and "authentically homemade" for a weeknight meal. I did not use the chile in the pesto, and I prepared tilapia filets instead of trout but otherwise followed recipe exactly. Served with linguine cooked with peas, and put the pesto over both fish and pasta, topping with parmesan.

I'd give this quick, healthy, delicious recipe a 3.75 forks! Used less olive oil to bake and substituted a bit of canned chipotle and one dried mild red southern new mexican chile and it was great!
