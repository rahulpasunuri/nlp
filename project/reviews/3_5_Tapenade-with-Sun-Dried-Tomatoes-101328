I thought it a bit bland as made in the recipe, so I added a large clove of garlic and some parsley to good effect. I'm sure letting it rest a day or two will also improve the flavor.

I serve this as an appetizer with fresh baguette slices often and it is always a big hit.

I just love sun-dried tomatoes! This is great for all sorts of spreads!

Very easy and very good recipe. Served with baguette slices brushed with olive oil and lightly toasted and guests loved it.

I made this as an appetizer spread for Easter and found it to be just okay. It is really thick and the caramelized onions dominate the flavor. I agree with a previous review that the spread would combine nicely with goat cheese and it would be great for a pizza base.

This is a delicious base for a veggie pizza. I put goat cheese as the topping. This is a great recipe to make ahead and use for a last-minute dinner.

This is absolutely delicious! For a recent party, I spread goat cheese on bruschetta and topped it with this tapenade.Everyone loved it!

This was a very easy recipe and well worth making. The carmelized onions are the key!

Great and easy appetizer. It is especially good with a nice sweet onion, like a Vidalia or Texas Sweet. Good on crisp bread or toast.
