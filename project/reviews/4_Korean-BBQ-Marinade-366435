I've made this recipe twice now and will keep it in the rotation. The marinade leaves the meat very flavorful. I used 1lb. of flank steak that I cut against the grain into long thin strips, I ribboned them onto skewers and then soaked in marinade for 6 hours. The meat comes off the grill tender and delicious. The kids loved it as well!!!

I used this recipe for grilled pork chops, and it was perfect. I used a citrus flavored soy sauce just for change and it was delicious. As always I use much more garlic and ginger than any recipe calls for. I ill try this on steak next time and marinate longer.

Marinaded 24 hours. Grilled over charcoal. Everyone from 6 to 60 loved the meat.

Fabulous and easy recipe. This is my third time making this. Followed recipe exactly the first time. Second time marinaded longer (about 6 hours). Cooked on charcoal grill. Husband said "it's like candy"

Have made this several times, the last time I used a cut of beef called flap steak. It is similar to flank steak. I marinaded for 5 hours or so and cooked it on a charcoal grill. Might have beefed up the ginger and garlic a bit. This is a great, easy recipe that my family loves.

Very good with thin sliced T-Bone steaks. Much better than a standard Teriyaki.
