This was delicious! I added asparagus and a little more butter than it called for. Also, i added a bit of squeezed orange juice right at the end and it totally made it! I will definitely make this again (especially with the lamb)!

This went great with the menu. I needed more butter then 1/4 cup that was reserved.
