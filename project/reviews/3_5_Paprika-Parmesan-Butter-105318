Great results. Must say that I DID make one change. I used "smoked" hot paprika,as opposed to regular paprika, (also called, Pimentòn de la Vera). The final flavor was outstanding, as were the comments of my guests.

To the cook who wanted a whipped effect--how about piping it. The butter will be relatively soft after you have mixed all the ingredients together. Take a ziplock bag, snip a corner off and insert a piping tip, put the butter in and pipe rounds onto a cookie sheet lined with waxed paper. Then chill. That should give you a whipped look.

I'm in Taiwan. What can I use to substitute for Worcestershire,if I can't find it in the supermarket?

For those who've made this recipe, did you use Tabasco as your "hot pepper sauce"?

I used anchovy paste for the recipe, which I thought was okay -- but not outstanding. It needs some punching-up.

Good stuff. I left out the anchovy and it seemed to need a bit of salt to make the flavors balance out. But delicious. Used fresh grated parm.

Since we usually try to make healthy(ish) food, this is a complete indulgence. And completely worth it. We are addicted! Fish, beef, poultry...it would work on pretty much anything.

A very good mix of strong flavors that came together subtly. This was great on the steaks (especially when spred on each bite rather than melted on the whole steak) and the grilled baby veggies we served with it - it'd be great on just about anything that goes well with butter. This is butter with a kick! We don't really care for anchovies, but did decide to include them - did not regret it. They blend in nicely and add flavor without overpowering.

WOW! I served wonderful filets that had great flavor and my guest were drowning their steaks with this butter. Tremendous flavor. What a winner. I omitted the anchovie and didn't miss it!

Ever since this recipe came out in Bon Appetit's BBQ issue I can't stop making it. It is my base recipe for ALL steaks now. Simple yet so flavorful! I usually wouldn't make a butter to top my steaks, but the Paprika butter is amazing on the steaks. Definitely make it. I usually put a little more pepper and rosemary than the recipe asks for, but I love my steaks HERBy! I'll make this again and again and again.

I omitted the anchovy's, as I am allergic to fish/sea food. Not worth the risk. I served the butter with a steak that we barbequed with standard b-b-q sauce. It was an excellent combination. My one difficulty with the sauce was getting the consistency the way I wanted it. I set my butter out to rise to room temperature but it didn't get there in the time frame I had allowed. Silly me decided to microwave the butter. This ruined the consistency of the butter and seasonings. The flavor was still true, but the texture was terrible. Thank goodness my guests didn't know what the butter was supposed to look like. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to get a more "whipped" affect with the butter and seasonings?

This was excellent!!

This dish is a knockout! Make lots of the marinade and parmesan butter as both keep well and work well with other beef cuts on the grill.
