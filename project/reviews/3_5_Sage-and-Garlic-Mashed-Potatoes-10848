Great simple recipe. For a vegan version I substituted vegan sour cream for the yogurt and Smart Balance spread for the butter, and it still tasted very good.

YUM! I eyeballed most of the ingredients because I was using much smaller potatoes. I also used cream cheese since I didn't have yogurt or sour cream available, and a little bit of skim milk to smooth it out. I made this recipe once before and I think it was better this time! The mixture ended up a little more watery and chunky than I would have liked (sans cooking liquid) so I threw it in the food processor and ended up with what was more like whipped potatoes. An extremely auspicious "mistake" - absolutely divine texture and taste! I'd recommend it to anyone.

Great side dish. I used half the yogurt and replaced the rest with cream and the tang was absolutely perfect. I chopped the fried sage leaves up a bit to top the dish--mmm.

The sage definitely came through. I used way more garlic cloves than the recipe called for...like three or so...I totally failed at the fired sage leaves though. I just couldn't concentrate on them and I wasn't sure what they were supposed to looke like. Maybe another time...

Really delicious. I added the garlic and sage to the potatoes and not just the infused oil. I also used sour cream and half and half instead of yogurt and water. The texture was perfect. Great with steak.

Good way to use sage if you have it in your garden. I found the potatoes to be a bit sour from the yogurt, I would probably use low fat sour cream next time. Frying the sage leaves in a pan was too splattery, so I threw them in my deep fryer, which is a good alternative if you have one. I left them in for a couple minutes, and they were crispy and yummy.

My wife went ape over this easy side dish. I added sour cream in the mash, and next time I'll add yoghurt. A great way to think of other things to add to boring old mash potatoes!

This recipe was too much work for not enough pay-off. I think you could achieve the same taste result without frying twice -- once to flavor the oil and the second time to fry the sage. Skip the first step.

Absolutely fabulous! I added parmesan cheese just before serving, and it made it all the more wonderful. A great mashed potato recipe!

Out of yogurt,used milk,and it was still delicious. Glad I had fresh sage;it just wouldn't have been nearly as good with dried.

I really cheated with this recipe, but can't resist saying what I did to make a very good potato dish. I added a pinch of dried sage to my instant mashed potatoes (Hungry Jack brand) along with the other ingredients called for on the box. I sliced several garlic cloves paper thin and very slowly over low heat sauteed them in oil until they were a light golden brown. I drained them on paper towels and they were nice and crispy. These I sprinkled atop the portions of mashed potatoes. We loved them! Note: when my sage plant is in full growth I'll make the fried sage leaves for sure.

I used white potatoes instead of russets and no-fat sour cream instead of yogurt. I served them with barbequed steak and salad and they were delicious. Definitely a keeper, great way to use up the fresh sage leaves. One hint, dry the leaves really well before frying them or you'll get splattered.

These were delicious--very herbal and a great way to use up my bounty of sage. I especially liked the fried sage leaves served on top...very different. I served with a grilled pork tenderloin that was rubbed with olive oil and stuffed with pockets of garden fresh garlic, sage, rosemary and thyme and fresh green beans. Yum!
