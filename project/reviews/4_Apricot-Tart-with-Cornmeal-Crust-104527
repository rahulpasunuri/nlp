So easy! Like a cookie crust for those of us who don't always want to take the time to perfect the pasty! Use with any fruit filling. I loved it with peaches & raspberries (sugar & cornstarch too).

Delicious. Here is the gluten-free flour mix I used: Brown rice flour 2C Potato Starch(not potato flour) 2/3C Tapioca Flour 1/3 C ___________________________________ Total 3C 1t xanthum gum added to dry ingredients to hold it all together! I used frozen apricots and blackberries. Honey. Put them all in sauce pan allowed everything to thaw and combine. Reduced liquids slightly. Used almond extract in the whipped cream. The crust is a real find! Will use it in the future. Merry Christmas from BC!

This review is for the cornmeal crust: it's perfect! I used a different filling of fresh apricots, poached in a simple syrup and drenched in custard. In order to keep the crust from getting too soggy, I blind baked it for about 15 minutes before filling it. I highly recommend this crust for sweet desserts or, omitting the sugar, for savory tarts, too.

This tart is wonderful. The crust is like a cornmeal cookie! I poached my apricots longer than 25 minutes and then took an immersion blender to them for a chunky puree. I did add a little lemon juice and honey to the filling (simply because I like those flavors with apricots) and I also placed canned apricot halves on top of the filling before adding the top crust. It did brown a little quicker than I thought, but overall very good and it looked quite pretty too!

I think this recipe tasted too much of DRIED apricots (obviously understanding that is what the recipe calls for!). I was hoping for a less dried fruit flavor. The crust was delicious, however too sweet for me, with the 3T of sugar on top. Also, I made it a day ahead, and while it was good the day I made it, the next day the crust had turned too moist, sort of cornbread like! I will not make this again, however I am thinking of making the crust into some kind of cookie with jam.

This crust is super. It's crispy-sugary and with a great texture. It is all that one wants . The apricot sauce is a bit bland, so I used a good vanilla icecream to enhance it. I'll certainly make it again and try a different fruit filling.

I have been making this tart ever since I stumbled upon the recipe a couple of years ago and it is absolutely wonderful. For the apricot filling, I mixed both mediterranean and california apricots. I was short of cornmeal last time so added a little malto meal ( a bit less than 1/4 cup - NOT instant!) in exchange for the missing cornmeal. Believe it or not, it worked beautifully!

This tart was wonderful. The crust had a really nice flavor and texture. I too had a problem rolling out the top, but I pieced it together and after baking it looked beautiful. I used California apricots that were small but whole and plump. Next time I will use Turkish, which I think will be much better.

Made this for the second time last weekend, for a dinner party. Ended up making it in a springform pan, and to my glee, it turned out fine! Couldn't find cornmeal the first time I made it, but found some corn flour this time. It really does add to the crust, so do try to include that if you can!

Just made this for a brunch with my family. I am not usually the cook in the family and no one could believe I made this tart all by myself! It was so easy and looked and tasted great. Instead of a circle cookie cutter, I used a star shape to give the tart a more interesting look.

I made this recipe for company tonight and was short on time. I used boxed crust then followed all the other directions as written, including the egg and sugar on the crust. I had to shorten the baking time to about 25 minutes. Everyone loved it. Made this way, it didn't take much time and it turned out great

This tart was interesting. I made it in a 9 1/2 in tart pan and feel like there was too much crust and not enough filling. It was impressive though! I love the crust so much that I'm sure I'll make other tarts with the same crust. I forgot the preserves and felt like it was still good, although a little drier than intended, and not quite as sweet -- in my opinion, perfect for breakfast!

My guests (and I) really liked this tart. I also made the apricot sauce and while it was good, it was incredibly sweet so I might cut down (even by half) on the sugar for next time. I would also consider adding dried cranberries to the filling, a good suggestion by another reviewer. Also, my top crust got very torn as I was trying to peel off the parchment paper, but it all grew back together while baking. All in all, very pretty and very tasty.

This tart was easy to make and my guests, who are apricot fans, thought it was delicious. Make sure that you poach the apricots sufficiently so that they are not tough. I used the apricot sauce and added some almond extract to the whipped cream. You can use this recipe with confidence that your tart will look and taste great!

This tart recipe is fabulous. We did not make the apricot sauce...it was still fantastic. I will try the apricot sauce in the future. We used pear preserves (didn't have apricot), mixed dried fruit, and the only size tart pan we had with a removable bottom (a little over 10 inches). As a result of the larger pan size, our cooking time was a little less. The reviewer who stressed rolling out the top crust between waxed paper (or parchment, which is what we used) was absolutely correct. In fact, had to put ours back in fridge for a few minutes after assembly to remove the parchment paper from our (larger/thinner crust). Impressive visually and impressive taste!

When I saw this recipe was from St. Helena (we live close by)I knew I wanted to try it. So I made this tart for Thanksgiving. It was the only dessert that was completely devoured! My mother-in-law asked me to make 2 tarts for their business clients in St. Helena. They ended up not giving the tarts to their clients, so I stuck them in the freezer. I ended up serving them for Christmas. They came out great! More rave reviews!

In reply to the question from the Cook, I don't know about canned apricots, but I made this last night using mixed dried fruits, and threw in a handful of cranberries for extra tartness. It was wonderful with whipped cream Big hit in my bridge club!

Could anyone please tell me--would it be ok to make this recipe with canned apricots?

This was a very easy dish to make. The cornmeal crust made it. Be sure to roll out the crust you put on top of tart between wax paper. It is not easy to roll otherwise. I would definitely make this again. Great accompanied by the apricot sauce and whip cream. A keeper!
