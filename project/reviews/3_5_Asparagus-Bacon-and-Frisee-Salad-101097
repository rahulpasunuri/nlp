Awesome! I took a couple things from a similar recipe on this sight - adding shallots to 2 TBSP of the bacon fat and mixing with the dressing. My company loved it.

Nice combination of flavors. I think I'll add some Parmesan next time to give it a bit more umph.

This has been a big hit at every dinner party I've prepared it!

Quick and tasty, what more could one want? I used pancetta instead of bacon.

I just made this again after one year. Since that time I discovered the meaning of genuine balsamic vinegar. I'm going with four forks instead of the three I gave this last year!

Made for Thanksgiving buffet, many compliments. Should lend itself to many variations.
