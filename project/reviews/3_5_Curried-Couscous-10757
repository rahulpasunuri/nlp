I should have noted that I triple the recipe and use olive oil instead of butter, then add the can of roasted tomatoes when you add the couscous.

Use this recipe all the time, adding a can of fire roasted tomatoes. You can also add roasted peppers or just about anything. Goes really well with grilled chicken rubbed with olive oil and the same curry powder (I use Madras because I like it hot).

I used olive oil instead of butter. Added 1/4 c chopped cashews and 1/4 c currants. It was a great accompaniment to a Moroccan chicken tagine and haricots verts.

This was tasty, but not outstanding. Perhaps it was due to the use of bouillon cubes and water instead of chicken broth. It WAS quick, easy and tasty- I'll try it again - but I'll make sure to use the chicken broth instead.

I have made this dish countless times...very easy as a quick side, but you must love strong curry flavor (which we do!).

Extremely easy and tasty. A great accompaniment to grilled meat. I love curry so was happy with the amount suggested in the recipe. I added toasted chopped almonds for taste and texture.

A nice way to serve couscous with a kick to it. I only put in 1 ts. curry and it was enough for me. I think couscous needs a strong spice so this was perfect!

Fabulous - simple to make and wonderfully flavorful. It can be made with finely chopped leeks rather than scallions as well.

I just love this. It is so quick and easy. Reduced the curry to 1 tsp. Serve it with the Curried Shrimp and a salad. Makes a wonderful meal!

I was disappointed in this recipe - it is too much curry and needs another flavor to balance it.

I made this with a spicy tomato barbeque dish and it was tremendous you could make the couscous with one hand tied behind your back. It has a wonderful curry flavor. Delicious! Goes in the active recipe file for sure.

Yummy! I rated this dish 4 forks because of the simplicity and ease of making it! Really went well with our barbecued chicken wings. It was quite simply delicious. Definitely a keeper.

I've just recently discovered couscous - and this curry version is great. And it is sooooo easy.
