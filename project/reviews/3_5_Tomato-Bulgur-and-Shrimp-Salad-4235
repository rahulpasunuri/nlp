Really good! I was sad I didn't have feta, because that would be a great addition. I also added garbanzo beans.

Excellent, I added sweet red onions and orange peppers. Used less dill. Great one container lunch. I think next time I will add some chickpeas

This is a very tasty and easy to make salad. I used 1/2 lb of cooked baby shrimp to save on chopping. Served on lettuce, topped with feta cheese. All the flavors shine, and the combo of texttures is great. (To lower the fat, I subbed 1 tb oil with 1 tb balsamic vinegar, and it worked well.) This recipe yields 8 cups.
