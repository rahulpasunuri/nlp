Excellent. Also works nicely with a combination of blackberries and strawberries.

Brown sugar is not healthier than white sugar, however, generally because it has stronger flavor one would use less and of course this is due to the molasses. I swap in brown sugar for white all the time and use about half, which in turn makes the recipe healthier. I am really excited to try these pops and a few more I have found!!

I've made these several times now, and I love this delicious frozen treat! The tastier the berries, the better the result.

Really tasty- a great way to cool off. I switched out agave nectar for the sugar. Natural sugars are always better to use whenever possible- bleached white sugar is harder for the body to digest, natural sweeteners are healthier in the sense of feeling balanced, and easier on your body, if you were still wondering about why honey is better for you then sugar, but it should always be local with no additives.

Have issues with lactose, wonder if anyone's tried them with goat milk yogurt (which I love by itself or with berries & granola)??

bzcookin, how is honey or brown sugar healthier than white sugar? I would say just reduce the sugar overall by up to half if you're concerned about total sugars or calories. I've done this consistently in other sorbet and frozen yogurt recipes with success.

Blackberries? Yum. Yogurt? Yum. Honey? Yum. A very tasty combination. It is cold today and it was still a real treat to eat it. This recipe is kid friendly (except for the wait time).Now a part of my permanant collection.

These were delicious! The honey added a great flavor, and the yogurt (which I was a little leery of) added to both the flavor and overall feel. Yummers!

I wonder if Splenda could be used in place of the sugar. I have used it in some of my baking and you could not taste the difference. Perhaps 1/2 sugar and 1/2 splenda?? I am anxious to try this recipe.

I had to add more honey and lessen the sugar, to make a little bit more healthy. What I'm thinking of right now is, melt brown sugar and use that instead of white sugar. Also, i would like to experiment with other fruits to do have a variety :) Thank you for sharing this recipe. Will be back for more recipes like this.

I kinda feel like its heavy on the sugar side to be in the healthy recipes but it tasted very good.
