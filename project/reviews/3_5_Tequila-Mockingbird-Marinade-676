YUM! Use 1/4 cup tequila, as noted by previous reviewer.

This marinade is amazingly good. I have made it twice, the second time for a gathering of friends. Everyone loved it, even friends who don't like spicy foods. It is worth using good tequila. I love Patron, and it is delicious as a marinade.

I had high hopes but this turned out utterly tasteless for me. I marinated a whole cut-up chicken in it (prepared exactly as per the recipe), let it sit all day, and yet it had no taste. Not sure what I did wrong. Maybe I'd try it again with shrimp.

Made 2 separate batches for a group of 40 - one w/ jalapeno & one without. I used chipotle ground pepper in both instead of chili powder. Because of scheduling, I marinated for 9 hours with no negative effect from the citrus. Both styles have some kick, but the batch w/ the peppers is fuller, not necessarily hotter. Easy to double (or 7x) the recipe, but perhaps that the amount of oil made the sauce too grainy.

Oh man this is a good recipe. My dad swears up and down that chicken just does not marinate well. Once he tried this he retracted his statement! I've tried the recipe as-is, but tonight I didn't have any jalapenos so I used chopped green chiles from a can, and used almost 1/4 cup tequila and 3 "overflowing" tablespoons of triple sec. The chiles lent the acid it needed to marinate but also added some sweetness instead of spicyness. We all loved it, even my 4 and 6 year old. This one's a keeper, for sure! Better go buy more tequila! Oh, and use GOOD tequila, none of that Cuervo crap!

VERY easy and HUGE reviews received when I used this marinade on tiger shrimp for a party appetizer dish. Removed shells, leaving tails on, soaked for 1/2 hr in the marinade and threaded onto mini-skewers. Grilled on the bbq. I did add several drops of tabasco to turn up the heat on the marinade a bit. Think I may add some chopped cilantro as well, next time, to give the dish some color.

A never-fail recipe. Every time I prepare this, I'm asked for the recipe. I've made it w/Chicken, shrimp(superb!) and even salmon, and it's met w/rave reviews. I adjusted the jalepeno/chili powder depending on my guests!! Goes great with barbecued corn brushed with garlic and wrapped in foil, and black beans!! I love it!

Excellent recipe. I have to keep copies around to give as everyone wants the recipe. I use it mostly for grilling veggies, and if I am out of any ingredients I just substitute with whatever is around. I have even used margarita mix doctored up!

Hi all, just want to say I loved this marinade. Had a friend over and they loved it too. I think it's great way to grill boneless chicken thighs. It's very tasty w/out being too overpowering. I made bbq chicken pizzas w/aged white cheddar, green onion & cilantro w/the leftovers. Husband liked it too and he's not a big marinade fan. Warning: You'll be tempted to make yourself a margarita afterwards!

We live near the ocean in Venura, Ca and like to fish. I used this marinade on local ling cod, red snapper and sea bass. Rave reviews and the fish was so flaky it melted in our mouths. Naturally we b.b.q.'d, served it with corn on the cob with Jalapeno butter and a green veggi.ATTENTION: MY E MAIL IS bginkey@msn.com

I made this marinade because of all the positive reviews, but I gotta tell you that I was very disappointed. I used boneless chicken breasts and it really was quite bland and just so-so, nothing special. (Is it better with shrimp/scallops? Was that the problem?) Well, not only was I disappointed with this marinade, but so was my husband and our 20-year old son. Personally, it's very average and I don't know what all the fuss is about! Sorry, but thumbs down on this one. There are several other marinades on this wonderful website that are far superior. For example, the Tritip Tequila Marinade is outstanding. Of course, that one is for beef; specifically, tritip.

I have made this twice, both times with chicken, and also both times marinating 24 hrs. The chicken was moist, juicy, delicious and zesty! Big hit with everyone. Do boil the marinade to use as a sauce, good on rice, pasta, whatever.

I used Bacardi Limon in place of the Tequila and triple sec - worked great. I also let the marinade reduce by about 1/2, then drizzled over skewers (I prepared double the recipe to begin with)was yummmy!I will use this again.

Excellent marinade, especially for shrimp. I boiled the marinade for a few minutes then spooned it over the shimp which I served over rice. I like spice so next time I'd add another jalapeno. It would also be great with Jumbo shrimp so you could brush the marinade on during grilling. Next time I'll try it on scallops!

This is a great marinade I used Jumbo shrimp marinated them for 30 minutes and cooked them in a wok with the marinade and mixed and served with Penne pasta the pasta really holds the flavor and add a little parmesan cheese a delicious hit with everyone

Great light taste. I served it with yellow rice and stir fried zucchini, carrots, and red onion, using a little of the marinade as the liquid. A perfect meal.

Absolutly wonderful!! This has become my favorite marinade and is wonderful with both chicken and shrimp (although I do recommend marinating the chicken for at least 4 hours to be sure flavors completely penetrate). Try this one - you won't be sorry!

Fantastic and easy marinade! We grilled scallops and shrimp in this marinade for my husband's 40th birthday and it was proclaimed the hit of the party. We like this recipe better than the CT restaurant original.

I used this marinade on chicken cooked on the grill. I thought it was ok, but kind of bland. My husband on the other hand loved it. It was not bad, but I like a little more taste. Is good for a hot summer day when you want something light. I would make it again though.

This is a delicious marinade. The flavor is not overpowering and if you like margaritas it is for you. We tried it on both shrimp and chicken and would do both again. Serve over rice so that you can savor the marinade without flavors competing.

I've been making this marinade since 1995, and it has always been impressive on shrimp. Chopped Cilantro over the top of the shrimp with a corn and tomato salad is a nice beach meal

Tried this with squid. An interesting combination that was enjoyed by all. Definately something I will try with other meats.

I used this on jumbo shrimp and served them as an appetizer. Big hit! None were left. I intended to reduce the marinade and drizzle it over them but boiled it too long so couldn't use it (too many margaritas!). They were great without it. The marinade is not so spicy that it overpowers the shrimp but has a pleasant spicy flavor. Goes well with margaritas and mexican food. I will use this again on poultry and seafood.

I'm keeping this recipe for my files and plan to make it again. I made it with chicken and I think it would be great with grilled shrimp. It was worth buying a bottle of triple sec to make it. It has a mellow spicy taste and smells wonderful.

I used this marinade on grilled chicken.It was alot lighter flavor than I expected. I will make it again, but I would like to try it next on large shrimp.

Just the right amount of "bite". Used to marinate chicken and precooked shimp and cooked kabob style on the grill.

Very good and very quick and easy to prepare. I used the marinade on sea scallops and jumbo shrimp which I grilled on skewers. Will definitely make again.

We tried this with jumbo gulf shrimp. It was excellent marinaded for 30 minutes, then grilled for three minutes per side. I've just e mailed this to my sister in Al. I will definitely use it again.
