Used 1 lb baby spinach (no cutting required) and added sliced mushrooms, one clove of garlic, and a pinch of fresh nutmeg. Really good, but be sure to keep an eye on the eggs to keep them from overcooking.

Easy but delicious enough to be special. Had it for our Christmas breakfast after opening presents. Lactose intolerant people in our house, so I subbed coconut milk from a can for the heavy cream. Baked the eggs in pottery bowls since that's what I have. Served with bacon and toasted English muffins.

I precisely followed the recipe except I used 4oz ramekins as I did not have 8oz. Upon checking the eggs at 15 minutes, the middle seemed runny so I left them in another 5 or so minutes. Overall the flavor was very delicious, but required more salt than indicated. Also, the yolk was completely cooked. I'd like to try this recipe again with proper ramekins to see if that affects cook time.

Quick and easy. I didn't use any cream for the spinach but added Parmesan cheese and garlic. I left the ramekins in the oven for about 12 minutes but the yolks were almost fully cooked. Will try again for less time next time!

I followed the recipe as directed and found the result to be just okay. 15 mins in the oven was too long for me, so keep an eye on the eggs. I wouldn't make it again as directed, but maybe add cheese and other extras.

this is a great way to change up the typical egg scrambles and omelettes. used milk instead of cream and added bell peppers as well. definitely a keeper recipe!

Very yummy! It was like spinach quiche without the crust.

Couldn't believe how tasty this was considering how simple it was. I used a pound of frozen chopped spinach and sprinkled with Parmigiano Reggiano before baking. I reduced baking time to 14 minutes and yolk was nearly set, but this may be because I used shallow ramekins. Would be nice with a tomato salad.

"Runny" eggs are not my favorite, but my husband loves his eggs sunny side up so I tried this dish for him. He loved it and I must admit I enjoyed the combination of flavors. I served a side dish of rosemary roasted potatoes along with the bacon and toast. It turned out to be an easy and delicious weeknight supper.

Made this with frozen buttered spinach (1 pkg filled two ramekins) and then omitted the cream entirely. Grated some Gruyere cheese over the top, added a 1/2 teaspoon of breadcrubs (just a light sprinkle) and then a dash of paprika for the color. It came out amazingly well. My husband, who is a picky eater, loved it! Will definitely be making this again -- using the frozen buttered spinach saved so much time and made it so easy.

This was wonderful! I halved the recipe since there are only two of us, and I sprinkled some fresh grated parmesan on top when it was done. We like runny eggs so the cooking time was a little bit too long. Next time I'm going to try with chard instead of spinach.

I could not figure out why i had never tried eggs over creamed spinach before......what a terrific marriage.... while i liked it like this, i also have made it in the Ham crisps that are described in the " baked eggs and mushrooms " on this site - have a couple of mushroom haters in the house, so this was a wonderful option! try it !!

Delish! With slight modifications: half sauteed spinach, half sauteed mushrooms. Put the veggies in the ramekins, then added the egg, then S&P, 1 Tbsp cream poured over (no need to add to the spinach first), then sprinkled with parmesan and baked. You could substitute other veggies, meats, cheeses... seems fairly foolproof.

Very yummy and easy dish to make especially when you want to serve a special breakfast for many people. Some modifications I made were to chop the onions in a food processor and use whole milk (instead of cream) to make a bernaise-like sauce after adding a tablespoon of flour to the onions and butter. I also cooked the eggs together in one big pan, so it came out looking like a casserole. Using the specified cooking time and temperature, the eggs came out fully cooked, with the yokes hard and fully formed. Next time I'll reduce the cooking time by a couple of minutes.

I'm on a low carb diet and I am sick to death of eggs. I was looking for some new ideas and this seemed like a nice change of pace but I had no real high hopes. I was pleasantly surprised, it's really yummy. I added a minced clove of garlic and a sprinkling of asagio cheese to the onion/spinach mixture and sprinkled a touch of cheese on top befoe baking. I also used evaporated milk instead of the cream.

this was a good recipe. very easy to make and really no fuss. i used olive oil instead of butter. i didn't chop the spinach as it wilts down when it gets cooked. i served it with english muffins and overall people thought it was good.

i'm very low-maintenance, so this recipe appealed to me immediately. i had a great time preparing it, and it came out to be very delicious! i would only suggest adding some sort of cheese, or sour cream to the spinach to kick the flavor up a notch. besides that, it was easy to make and a pleasure to eat!

I made this for a brunch for my cooking club and it was great! Changes I made were to add a dash of garlic powder to the sauteed onions and spinach and I added about 1 T. shredded parmesan cheese to the spinach mixture. Once assembled I sprinkled a little more parmesan cheese on top of each egg and baked. Everyone loved them!

Very good. I would stick to hte 15 minutes and leave them set a minute if you think too runny, the heat of the raminkins and the spinach cookies them through. I also took advice and for the cream, I actually added about 1 tbsp cream cheese and then justed added half and half to the consistancy I wanted, wasn't much, maybe 3 tbsp. very good. served with toast.

This was fabulous! I added a bit of feta cheese to each ramekin. Also, because I am fussy about yolks, I baked them a bit too long, but they were still good. I might whisk the eggs first next time. But all in all, very flavorful. Yum!

I don't eat eggs, but everyone for whom I made these really liked them. I used olive oil instead of butter, and milk (a lesser amount) instead of cream, and they turned out very well. One yolk broke accidentally, but it turned out better, as that particular guest hates anything that even approximates a runny yolk. local organic spinach!

I baked these until the yolks were almost set, but that made the whites tough. Liked the spinach.

The only thing I would change is the amount of cream...a little too soupy (but that could be me). Spinach with egg is no secret but this combination is really good. I didn't want runny eggs so I baked it longer to a solid poached texture. Looks great and no one avoids it because of the runny stuff. (I imagine a low fat version without the cream wouldn't be too hard either.)

I agree with everybody; this is delicious. We had them for Sunday brunch today with bagels and lox and all the trimmings, fresh tropical fruit, and mimosas, for our weekend guests.

This was a little out of the ordinary; my husband was skeptical, but ended up liking it. I liked it more than he did.

After low-carbing for 2 weeks, I was really glad to stumble on this simple new way to have eggs for breakfast. I deglazed some white wine (about 2-3 tbsp) in the spinach prior to adding the cream which I think "kicked it up" even further (not that it needs it. Will definately make again and again - DEE-LISH!!!

I did not have ramekins so I used bowls that were (too big). Also I didn't know if the spinach should still be saucy when pouring into the bowls. I baked it an extra 5 mins to avoid raw eggs but next time I will take them out on time so the yolk is still runny. Was good despite my lousy effort..will definitely make again.

Absolutely delicious, tried it out on my husband and he loved it, so I will use if for an appetizer for a dinner party next week. I used soft fresh bread instead of toast, I thought it went better with the bacon and egg. Also next time I might sprinkle a little Parmesan cheese on top.

Loved it. Hubby was out of town and my best girlfriend and I had this for Sunday brunch. I used frozen spinach because the fresh spinach at the market was nasty. I think I would 1) thaw the spinach first and 2) then wring it out in paper towels before putting it with the onion in the hot pan.

This is an ideal morning breakfast or a late night snack. This recipe is low in carbohydrates, therefore will not make you sleepy in mid-moring. If following the Adkins Diet for good health, this will fit in beautifully. This is very delicious and filling.
