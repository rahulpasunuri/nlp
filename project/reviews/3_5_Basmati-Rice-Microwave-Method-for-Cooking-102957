PERFECT!!! Was skeptical because Basmati usually requires soaking, but was pleasantly surprised. I will never make it any other way. Thanks for posting this!

This worked perfect for me. I used to use another "cover all the time" recipe that works great too but some sticky water just got out from the dish and it was not so cool. I'm wondering if we can save some energy by covering for the first (2-3-4-5?) minutes and reducing the 15 minutes...has anyone tried? And it would be cool to have a standard method for every quantity...or at least for 1-2-4-5 cups. Let's share our experiments! :)

This recipe takes no account of quantities. I tried it on a smaller amount of rice and it was a disaster. A far better recipe is on the Tilda site. http://tilda.com/#?section=2&subsection=11&content=48

Absolutely excellent! I halved the recipe and the cooking time, but needed to add another minute or so to the covered part of the cooking time. It was perfectly light and fluffy with just enough stickiness. Completely foolproof!

I know at the end of the receipe you say, faster is not the issue, better is. I followed your directions to a 't' in my old plastic cooker, and the rice was perfect and flaky! Good enough for me, and five more minutes with my boys! Cheers!

It does say low sodium recipe, which I don't nee, so I added salt and butter, as another reviewer noted. Great when it's hot outside! I think some might have experienced disappointment because their microwave is either old and takes longer or maybe supercharged and you need to choose a lower power setting. You need to fiddle with microwave times. It's all about technique and this is one worth pursuing.

I also followed the recipe and came out with a dry, gummy rice. I might try this recipe again with a few adjustments. It definitely needs a little more water and some butter for moisture.

Having never tried to cook basmati by any method at all, I found this to be super-easy and quite tasty. Melted some butter and added some worchestershire sauce in the bowl before adding the water and rice. Salted it when it was done, and it was great!

I tried this last night -- it wasn't perfect but it definitely has potential. It came out a bit dry and a tad too firm. The water was completely absorbed after the 15 minutes; I covered and proceeded with the recipe. I used a rather large, wide bowl, which may have caused this -- I will try again with the same bowl and a touch more water. I added a few cardamom pods, a few pinches of turmeric, a bay leaf and a cinnamon stick (broken in two pieces) as I often do when making basmati; I think the microwave method really brings out the flavors of the spices. Will definitely tinker with this one.

When I made this last night I realized I didn't have enough rice so I halved the recipe, but what I forgot to do was reduce the cooking time which turned the rice to leather. I'm putting it down to a pregnant moment. I will give it another go.

This is the easiest and most foolproof way to prepare Basmati Rice. Excellent and easy. You can cut the recipe and cooking times in half with the same results.

This is the best rice I've eaten outside a restaurant and in my own home. I usually wash rice to help it from getting sticky so was really happy with the completely non-sticky results here! My micro is old so I had to put it in for more like 20-25min for the initial uncovered cooking. It was tender, not dry, not wet and fluffy! I added salt, a dried thai bird chili, a bay leaf,a tbl of butter, a couple cloves of garlic, and a piece of ginger which left it with a wonderful aroma and just a hint of a little extra flavor (I love plain white basmati all by itself!) I won't cook rice on the stove again and risk that annoying sticky pot mess.

I'm one of those snobs who's too much a purist to use a microwave for anything but to warm up leftovers on rare occasions. But this method of preparing basmati rice is a winner! I've had Indian and Pakistani friends who use the finger-joint method of measuring water for rice, and this has always worked for me, too. Yet I agree with the commentary in the original issue that included this recipe - it's not an issue of being a simpler method of preparation - it's simply better! And hats off to George from San Antonio - you go with your microwave! (while I mostly roast or saute my vegies...)...One last comment: recently I read some Internet hype regarding the use of plastic or plastic wrap in the microwave. Apparently, this causes the release of carcinogenic dioxin in the food. Anyone know more about this? I'll use a paper towel in future...

Don't try this with brown rice. It doesn't work; the rice was still crunchy even though it looked done and the water was gone.

Forgot to add....I saute the rice grains in a pan on the stovetop, in a little butter, for about 2 minutes, before microwaving. This prevents the rice form getting sticky. Also, cut down cooking time to 12 min. covered and 3 uncovered.

What a simple way to make great rice!! I followed the instructions and the result was a perfect bowl of rice. I'd just about given up on making rice because I always ended up with rice that was sticky and gross. We often overlook the fact that simple is good.

My first time reviewing tho' I have used many recipes. This was a dismal failure -it ended up like a flat pancake - dry and brittle. Followed recipe as printed so I don't know what I did wrong. Help!

I love this method of cooking rice. I use this it all the time now!

I like Richard have been using the microwave to make rice for many years (21 years to be exact) and it works perfect every time; it works much better than a rice cooker. I also add 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1 tablespoon of butter to the rice and water. You can also add others herbs or spices if you like flavored rice. I could not believe the pompous attitude against using the microwave, not only in this recipe, but about forty others on this site. It is absolutely the best way there is to steam vegetables. Almost every vegetable can be steamed perfectly in 5 to 7 minutes using a 2 quart covered dish and 1 1/2 tablespoons of water. Come on folks, swallow your pride and try it. Your guests will never know.

I have been using the microwave to prepare rice for several years now. This method works very nicely. Perfect rice every time and you don't need anyone to help, not even an uncle!

My microwave now has a use - this is a great recipe. I sometimes add chicken broth or coconut milk in place of some of the water and dill, lemon juice, etc. to flavour it up!!

There's nothing silly about using the microwave unless you have an infinite number of burners on your stove! I was surprised at how well this turned out, though -- and I'll definitely make it again. I added six or seven cardamom pods (make sure you put a little slit in each so they don't explode) and that added a nice subtle taste and fragrance.

I thought it was silly to have to use the microwave, but it turned out ok, if you like that sort of thing.

I've done this several times since it was printed and have always had wonderful results. I usually put in capers and sun dried tomatoes. Great combo.
