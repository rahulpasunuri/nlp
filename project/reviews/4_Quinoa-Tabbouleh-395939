First time making this tonight. It is simple and tasty....used cilantro in lieu of parsley. It is good as is but I added feta and it really sang! Next time I will make along side some grilled fish or add shrimp. Had it with some pita bread and a nice sav blanc. Light, flavorful, and healthy.

I was attracted to this recipe because of the pretty, colorful picture and due to the fact that it is healthy (which also usually makes me a bit nervous, as a flavor lover). That being said, I actually turned to a couple bites of this over ice cream for a snack last night- so good! I made the quinoa the night before so I could avoid the time to spread on a cookie sheet and chill. I also halved the oil, doubled the lemon, added extra garlic (maybe 1 additional medium/large clove), and went over on the mint (maybe 2/3 cup). This dish is simple but seemingly complex, easy, and delicious.

Pretty bland, at least healthy and easy to make

I've made this many times, and it's delicious. Like may of the cooks here, I also add a bit more lemon juice and a bit less olive oil. Last time I put in cilantro instead of parsley and really liked the result. This is a keeper of a recipe--healthy and tasty!

Excellent! Cut the oil by half as other suggested. Added feta and doubled the lemon. Added grilled shrimp to the leftovers to make it a main dish. Yum!

Wonderful salad! Made a few adjustment : less oil added more herbs, lemon zest, feta and quinoa. Will be making again!

Really tasty recipe, especially for summer. I personally thought the parsley amount was a little much, and would use a litle less next time. Also, I increased the lemon juice as I like a little more tang. Overall, would definitely make again.

Loved this recipe. Served feta cheese on the side with hummus, pita chips and pita. Even my little one loved it.

OLIVE OIL is not the best option, it is a bit heavy in flavor, although I love it for every other salad, use grapeseed oil instead, it is also very healthy, unlike Canola oil, which I would not touch with a ten foot pole,I haven't done the research myself but I've heard it to be dangerous, after all the hype, who would believe it! NO CANOLA OIL!!! Also, when I don't have scallions I use regular onions, although not traditional, it's a good alternative.

I replaced the quinoa with Israeli couscous and loved the recipe this way. I'm sure it would taste just as great with the quinoa.

totally agree with another poster - half the olive oil and double the lemon juice. otherwise, too oily and not enough tang.

Definitely eyeball the olive oil and don't put the amount the recipe calls for. I didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried parsley flakes, and also didn't have scallions. But it was still good and great with a baked flounder. Next time I'll probably add other veggies along with the tomatoes and cucumbers and hopefully have the scallions.

Used 1/4 cup of olive oil + 4 tbs of lemon juice and it was perfect

@Cook from Charlotte NC: quinoa salads make excellent leftovers and can even be considered as a good make-ahead weekday salad which can cover a few days. AND A trick to make this even better - start by heating 1T oil in a heavy saucepan, then add the rinsed quinoa and toast on high heat, stirring, for a few minutes until it starts to smell, well, "toasty". Then add the water and proceed. Makes a great difference in the flavor! And as others have said, less oil/more lemon.

Wonderful salad but as pointed out by a couple of folks it is a bit heavy handed on the olive oil. This one salad has the whole daily allowance of fats for four people. Simple y cut down on the olive oil by a factor of two. If you want more dressing blend in some of those cherry tomatoes.

Will leftovers be good next day, after adding vegetables, or does it get soggy?

I agree with previous reviews: olive oil is too strong for this dish. Either cut back on the amount or use canola oil - and definitely use more lemon juice!

Made this on Memorial Day for company. Used canola oil (olive oil can be too strong in such a light salad) to the portion of 2 parts lemon juice, 1 part oil. I'm Lebanese American so the thought of having Tabbouleh was comforting. This was almost better than having the traditional salad with bulgher. I doubled the recipe for 6 salad- eating people. All loved it and there was very little left! The cruch of the vegetables, the lemon/oil/garlic dressing was wonderfully refreshing! Very easy to make and we all felt so Healthy!!! Will share with my relatives and will definitely make again!

I made this recipe exactly as written and found it to be good, but not "a dish beyond compare." I felt the amount of olive oil called for was excessive and the amount of lemon juice insufficient. My favorite quinoa recipe on this site remains the black bean, tomato and quinoa salad.

Just whipped this up today, and WOW! Easy and delicious, not to mention healthy. My store only had the red quinoa so I used that. Prepared the recipe exactly as writtin and is is very flavorful and refreshing. Will definitely keep in the rotation. I'm anxious to try the other grain salad recipes from this issue of Bon Appetit also.

Yum, we will be eating this all summer.

Just made this last weekend, and was so good we are doing it again tonight. We prefer a lighter hand with the olive oil, so I cut it back to 1/4 cup, & made the rest of the recipe exactly as printed. A real winner at our house, nicely balanced flavors, colorful, and delicious.
