Don't know what was so special. I roasted the beets instead,but it wasn't that good. Used more vinegar because it was too sweet, lots of salt, pepper and mint to give it some taste.

I made this as a side dish on New Year's Eve for guests. I added mandarin orange segments for color. It was a success and enjoyed by all. Took leftovers to work and co-workers asked for the recipe. Will be making this one again!

This was an excellent, tasty recipe for HOT weather. My husband and I ate almost all of it between us.
