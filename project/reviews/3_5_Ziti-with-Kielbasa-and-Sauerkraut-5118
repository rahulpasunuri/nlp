I admit I wasn't sure what to expect from this recipe but with all the good reviews I had to try it. We don't eat gluten anymore so I used gluten free penne. Also I don't eat beef so I used chicken-apple sausage (the kind like brats) instead. We have a bunch of homemade fermented sauerkraut so I drained it, but I didn't rinse. Funny thing is my husband doesn't usually like sauerkraut but he said the flavor wasn't strong enough to be noticeable. Success! We both like the recipe and we'll make it again.

Really enjoyed this. Be forewarned, this makes a ton! I used half the amount of pasta and added some of the pasta water for "sauciness". My sausage was spicy enough that it needed no caraway, cayenne or mustard, so take that into consideration when seasoning your dish.

We really enjoyed this meal! We followed the recipe pretty precisely. The only addition we did was that we threw the mix over the pasta, put cheese on top and shoved it in the over for an additional 15 minutes. It turned out great :)

Made this with very few edits, instead of the ziti I used potatoes. I also cooked this in a pressure cooker and first sauteed the onions and peppers. I have never made anything like this before and it turned out excellent and will for sure make it again but will try a lower fat sausage. It was so flavorful!

I used elk Kielbasa and brown rice penne because that's what I had on hand. It was very good. I'll definitely make it again soon.

This is amazingly tasty considering how fast and easy it it. Everyone loved it and we devoured the leftovers!

I made this dish because we had leftover sauerkraut. Boy, am I glad I did! I pretty much stuck to the recipe, only I used turkey smoked sausage, barilla pasta plus and regular yellow mustard. I also added an extra splash of wine too :-) Anyway, hubby and I were pleasantly suprised and look forward to having it again.

This was very good and very easy. I doubled the kielbasa; otherwise as written. The sauerkraut was very mild which pleased my daughter who doesn't like sauerkraut. She had seconds.

This may be a double rating, but the first one did not appear on the screen: I made this recipe as written with the exception that I did not use any pasta. I also added only a little liquid to keep it moist (beer - but anything probably would have been fine). My husband has always hated sauerkraut. He Loved this. I thought it was pretty tasty too.

This dish was a great idea in theory-- I love kraut and kielbabsa, and pasta. However, it was not what I expected at all. The pasta just did not seem to go with the rest, it was dry, and the mustard overpowered all the other flavors. I might try it again with some of the suggestions since everyone else really seemed to like it.

This recipe is a surprisingly good combination. I added diced asparagus and used leeks in place of some of the onion.

Even the children who do not care for sauerkraut liked this recipe....and asked for it to be made again!!!

The dish is an unusual combo of ingredients. I made it because we had lots of sauerkraut on hand. I don't think I would go out of my way to make it again though. It does taste good but not enough to make again.

I'm not a big sauerkraut lover but this dish combines the flavors wonderfully and definitely changed my mind. When in the mood for German flair I will definitely make again. Mostly for my husband and myself though. Kids did not care for it.

This was awesome!!! I used bowtie instead of ziti and when it was all combined put it in a 13 x 9 pan and topped it with grated swiss cheese (similar to a Reuben!) and baked it for about 20 minutes. It would be good to chop up the sausage a little more so that you get a piece in every bite! I used more cayanne than a pinch! I will definitely make this again and everyone I shared it with loved it. It's a nice change from what I usually make: Turkey Kilbasa with sauerkraut and a side of mashed potatoes. Plus, SO doesn't really love sauerkraut like I do, but he loved this! This is really wonderful!!!

I've made this dish regularly for the last few years minus the pasta. Instead, I've served the dish over rice. After reading the other reviews, however, I'm going to try it with pasta tonight!

Wonderful! Great combination of flavors. I have made this several times, and the only thing I do differently is to add a little more white wine and I also use extra sauerkraut. I love this dish!

This is a wonderful family meal. I was not sure how the pasta/sauerkraut comination was going to work, and it was great. I also used beer instead of wine, it just seemed to fit better with the fare. This dish is a keeper in my household.

This was a big hit in my family. My husband and kids loved it. I used cheap beer instead of wine. The leftovers were gobbled up the very next day.

Just want to comment on some of the other comments regarding pasta in this dish. My parents are originally Polish and my mom makes a version of this dish that has sauerkraut, pasta (wide noodles), and smoked ham/bacon in it. It's delicious. The combination may seem odd to some, but is in fact not so odd in other parts of the world. Enjoy.

I disagree with those that thought the pasta and saurkraut would not work together. All of the flavors and textures blend beautifully. I have made this several times during the fall/winter months. With a glass of zinfandel, it is the perfect winter dish!

We have made this several times since it first appeared and enjoy its pungent, balanced flavors. And, it freezes well for a reheat.

It's an easy and tasty dish. I substituted boiled potatoes for the ziti, which I think makes a better pairing for this choucroute style dish.

I thought this recipe was quite different but tasty. I made it with low fat turkey kielbasa, which I parboiled to render some fat. All-in-all, it was an interesting and not too fattening, kielbasa dinner.

I would make it again, but without the ziti. In fact, I made it without the ziti the first time, and added a couple of other sausages and served it as a choucroute. It was excellent! The reviewer from Vancouver is correct in saying that pasta and sauerkraut don't mix. Inventive dish, only a bit misguided.

This recipe was just weird. I don't mind sauerkraut, and I used excellent quality kielbasa and other ingredients, but the flavours just didn't blend. I don't think pasta and sauerkraut work together at all. The whole was decidedly less than the sum of its parts.
