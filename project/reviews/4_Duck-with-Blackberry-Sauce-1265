Duck was good, sauce was terrible.

We used this recipe again this year for Xmas dinner. This year we used blackberries (whereas last year we used raspberries) - it was wonderful. The deeper flavor of the blackberries really complemented the duck. Despite others' comments, I did not find the sauce excessively sweet. The small amount of maple syrup and the cognac add complexity to this amazing sauce.

Rating: 4
Used the blackberry sauce to go on fresh caught Northwest King salmon barbecued on a cedar plank. The caramel cooked a little quicker than the recipe calls for and the butter didn't incorporate completely before I added the next ingredients but it still turned out well. I pureed the warm sauce and then strained out the seeds (much nicer that way) and then added in a cup of fresh blackberries and let sit until serving. It was a very nice consistency and I liked having the whole berries in there. Oh, and it tasted heavenly!

This was very good. I cut down just slightly on the sweet ingredients after reading the reviews. Because I was serving this plated with other items, the sauce was too thin. Next time, I will add a bit of cornstarch to thicken it so it doesn't run over the whole plate.

The timing for this is exactly right to get the duck cooked perfectly. The sauce has a nice brightness to it. I used raspberries rather than blackberries and it was excellent.

Made this with Pork (bone-in) Chops for a dinner party. Everyone loved it except for 1 person who thought it was a bit sweet...? Served it with Russet and Mashed Potatoes and green beans! Delicious! Next time I'll be brave and try it with the Duck!

What a wonderful meal!! Sauce was incredible with the duck breast. Did not use maple syrup (didn't think it would work with other ingredients), and substituted red wine vinegar instead of raspberry as called for. Suggest when preparing to make sauce beforehand, due to it being a little time consuming. Well worth it! Sauce was not sweet and complimented the Duck very well. Sides included garlic mashed potatoes and simple green beans. Everyone ate every last bit!! If you love duck, try this recipe

Oh my! This was absolutely wonderful! I only wanted to serve 2, so bought one whole duck (saving the legs for confit). I used the carcass for a quick stock. Substitutions: I had about 1/2 cup of frozen blackberries and about 1.25 cups of frozen concord grapes (from last summer) on hand, so used those for the fruit. For stock: the duck stock, topped off with chicken; no beef. The other reviews mentioned the sauce was on the sweet side, so for the juice I used about half lemon, half orange. Also substituted some fruity honey (in this case tart cherry) for the maple syrup, and balsamic for the vinegar. There's enough leftover sauce for another meal, even though my boyfriend stole a few spoonfuls after the meal --- truly a great sauce!

Rating: 4
This was so incredible! We made it with just two duck breasts, but with 4 the sauce may be scarce. I didn't have raspberry vinegar, so I used balsamic and added some raspberry juice (still in our freezer from summer berry picking). Also used our summer blackberries and a really nice Cognac. As someone mentioned in the reviews, the beginning of the sauce was a little scary, I thought I had burned it when it turned dark brown, but it turned out well. Overall I found that the times listed for the sauce were a little long, that mine finished up a little quicker. Might be my stove/oven though. Enjoy!!

Rating: 4
Outstanding! The sauce takes longer than I had anticipated (I'm famous for not reading the entire recipe before jumping in though, so my bad)but it's actually very easy and absolutely delicious. I did not strain it though and added additional berries as a garnish. Safe to say that my dinner guests were blown away. Next time will either start sauce earlier or even make the day before.

We picked the last day of the season's blackberries and wanted to celebrate. We really had to change up the recipe to use what we had in the pantry. I used red wine instead of white, white wine vinegar instead of the raspberry vinegar, fresh black berries, no beef broth, and sourwood honey instead of the maple syrup. Also, we were having rack of lamb instead of the duck. We think it was absolutely the best meal we had ever prepared. I did not strain out the berries, but smashed them and left them in the sauce. FANTASTIC!

The sauce is so good. I made it to serve with a whole roast duckling and served it with rice to soak up the juice.

This was a really tasty sauce. We don't like duck so I wrapped a pork tenderloin with bacon and grilled it...for a pefect combination with the sauce. Also only used chicken broth and used a little less brandy...my chose was Calvados.

Duck is my favourite and this is hands down the best recipe for it. Making the first part of the sauce - the caramel - can be intimidating at first but it is well worth the effort. We serve this with CRISP POTATO PANCAKES WITH GOAT CHEESE ON MIXED GREENS, another excellent Epicurious recipe.

I made this for my mom's birthday and it was a big hit. I didn't strain the sauce, leaving the berries mostly intact. I also used only chicken broth, since that's what I had (I used a little less than the recipe called for). I also did not add any maple syrup or cognac, since the sauce tasted great as it was. I served it with mashed potatoes and bok choy: http://flickr.com/photos/karensandler/2082439795/

I made this last night for three couples to celebrate a birthday. The reaction to the dish was enthusiastic. I used fresh fruit and increased the quantity of the fruit. For no good reason, I added the fruit to the caramel and cooked it until the sugar had been incorporated into the fruit. Only then did I add the wine et al. All in all, a very nice dish.

I'll have to agree with [A Cook from Huntington Beach, CA on 06/30/03]. The sauce just seemed to lack something to bind the flavor with a finishing note. Will try it again to see if I can remedy this issue.

I had been studying this recipe for almost a month, planning to make it for Valentine's Day. I made some substitutions and omissions though. I used center-cut boneless pork loin chops instead of duck, fresh raspberries instead of frozen blackberries (I was surprised to find the raspberries and no blackberries, even here in the south!), and raspberry extract instead of raspberry vinegar, and no brandy/cognac at all. I think it pulled together very well, and I'm actually glad I went without the brandy, because I could just pick out the wine in the sauce. It took me a couple of hours to get the seeds out with the tea strainer (next time I'm getting something else), and that was the only drawback. I served it with rice pilaf and fresh green beans. Mmmm! My husband loved it, so I'll probably make it again. I would love to try this with blackberries and the rest of the ingredients. Maybe I'll be brave and make it with duck!

I've made this dish several times, and it has always turned out fabulous! I like to pair it with haricots verts with goat cheese and warm bacon dressing (Bon Appetit Nov 2003) and sweet potato and apple puree (online). Bon Appetit! :)

We made this recipe for New Years Eve after reading all the glowing reviews. We followed the recipe as is and it just didn't come together. It will fondly be remembered as that "infamous duck recipe of 2006". Let's just say that we will be looking for a new tradition next New Years Eve!

This was exemplory.. and as much as I am a big fan of my grill (Hey, my 15 year old Weber looks battle worn, but it works great and I use it al year in.. Connecticut) but this is not a grill recipe. The carmel/butter sauce is scary... I tried a couple of times until I got the temp right on my stove. After that it is verbatim. Yes, it took twice as long to reduce the sauce. I happened on two very plump breasts. Skin side downn for 5 miutes worked great followed by the 3 minutes up.. pulled off qucik..in the oven for 4 minutes.. DONE! Not sure I could get the tendernous of the breast plus the seared and crispy duck skin off the grill without over cooking. The sauce had a nice fruit kick, the Remy added a nice undertone... I did not find the sauce sweet. Ok, I admit the one change... I could not find frozen blackberries. I found fresh though (yeah in CT in October.. go figure). I would not grill this recipe.. plenty of flavor if you have soem decent duck breast. Mine came from a local butcher who has great meat. Jim

i make this for all special occasions. i've used blackberries, raspberries, mixed berries - all frozen. i don't use real maple syrup i use what's in the house and sometimes i don't feel it needs it. a little sugar or splenda works fine. BUT the key: GRILL THE DUCK BREASTS! yes, in the oven is good, but grilling the duck breasts makes all the difference. great with green beans, a nice wild rice pilaf and great Pinot Noir. one of my and my daughter's favs!

I found this somewhat boring and while its sauce was very complex with a lot of different tastes coming together it didn't really end up gelling. I ended up with a fairly plain duck breast with a little bit of sweet stuff drizzled on top. It tasted ok, but hardly fantastic. I would say there are two types of people in the world, those who like lots of light tastes and those who like bold tastes. This is one for those who like simple flavors.

Rating: 3
I made only the sauce portion of the recipe, and deviated only by using fresh blackberries in place of frozen. I served the sauce with venison tenderloin medallions, seasoned with lots of coarsely ground pepper and sea salt, seared in butter, and finished in the oven. The sauce was an excellent compliment to the venison! I will make it again with venison, and will also make it with the duck (which would be my 1st time preparing duck at home).

Rating: 4
This recipe turned out to be surprisingly easy, and turned out elegant and delicious. It was a wonderful centerpiece to our anniversary dinner. I actually used a pint of fresh blackberries in place of the frozen for the sauce, and blackberry vinegar in place of raspberry. As far as cooking time for the duck breasts, I followed the directions on the package that they came in, but the directions were very similar to the epicurious directions: sear on top of the stove and then finish in the oven. The sauce is _incredible_.

I have made this a few times, and was getting the recipe again for the holidays... I have comment on the previous two reviews. Duck breast can be served rare to medium rare - in fact it's much more delicious and tender that way. If you have duck legs, they need to be cooked fully and are best done confit style. Epicurious has a few wonderful recipes for confit duck legs. MAKE SURE YOU SAVE THE FAT when you confit!! You've never had roasted (fried for that matter)potatoes until you've had them in duck fat. There's a recipe on this site for that as well. Oh, and try it in duck risotto! I am unsure how the duck breasts were grilled without fire, they are soooo fatty. Savour the fat, make it a special treat and ignore (for that night) all the bad things associated with fat. Once you master confit, try cassoulet... worth every second of the extra effort, we have it for Christmas Eve every year. Enjoy!

I too, served this to three couples for a special dinner party this weekend. I enjoyed the sauce and may add as well how much longer it took to reduce down to the desired consistency. So be patient it will get there. However, I had a terrible time cooking the duck. It flamed up so bad we had to take it off a couple times to extinguish the flames. We resorted to sprinkling baking soda on the grill to douse the flames. We finally ended up wrapping the breasts up in foil and placing them back on the grill to bake. I lucked out because I think most of the fat had burned off so we did not find them too fatty. Just a little 'charred' I can't image trying them on the stove top. Does anyone have any ideas how to grill duck breasts without the bonfire!

Great goumet/entertaining meal. I was afraid my guests might find duck too "gamey" (I'd never had it before), so I made both duck and chicken. The duck disappeared immediately, and everyone said they would have loved all duck. I made the sauce with tangerine juice instead of orange, and really liked it. I got worried something was wrong after stirring in the wine/juice/vinegar mixture when the caramel turned to chunks of hard candy, but it dissolved fine. The sauce takes a long time to reduce and was thick enough, although I could have added a little cornstarch if I wanted pretty squiggles on the plate. I grilled the duck and it was fabulous. I scoured this website to find out how to tell when duck is "done", and the best I could come up with was 150'-160' for medium. Is duck different from chicken in that you don't have to cook it to well-done? Any feedback?

Rating: 4
One of the best sauces I've *ever* had... tastes very much like what you might get at a high end game restaurant. The beef broth is key to the beautiful, deep blackberry-for-meat sauce. I'm still working on the perfect way to cook the actual duck breast.. it was very good (I think I did it a little longer than the recipe asked me to). But still need to get that perfect crispy duck skin thing figured out. Will figure it out and make this every time I get the chance!

Oh my word! This recipe was to die for!!! I followed the recipe to the tee and yes, it took much longer for the reduction! I used, GRADE B Pure Maple Sugar which was perfect, and every single ingredient. I tripled the recipe for 3 whole ducks. I will agree with the cook from Steilacoom...even my GRUMPY Mother-in-law enjoyed it. They wanted to eat the Lemon and Thyme Capon, until the smelled the sauce...then they begged for more duck! I did add more butter to the sauce when warming up...it made it easier to the palate. I will make this again and again! My hubby said he wants this for Christmas...I served this with spinach cashew stuffing from this website, with a little change...I made the stuffing with duck giblet stock(I had no turkey giblets of course)and spaghetti squash, lovely contrast. I also made Duck Pate with the duck livers, which I got from this website. Also VERY DELISH! The sauce was exquisite and the duck soft and juicy. Thank You Epicurious for a GREAT THANKSGIVING!!!!!

I have made this dish many times - pan method and grilling. Grilling is great because of less mess. But when blackberries aren't available, it works very well with raspberries. I don't follow directions for reductions. I just watch the pan. It always takes longer than stated. I like a nice Zin or Pinot with this dish. A wild rice pilaf goes well, then fresh green beans or brussel sprouts.

Excellent!! My mother took seconds and thirds. I agree the sauce does take much longer to boil down. I let the ducks sit in the refer for almost one week (this really makes the duck tender)!! I served it with a big cabernet and it was a big hit.

Outstanding! To die for! And, any other superlative you can think of! I used fresh blackberries and grilled the duck breasts. Next time, I'm going to try the skillet method of cooking the duck (just for the fun of it). I agree that the sauce takes much longer to reduce than stated. The sauce is so good, my husband were drinking it from the sauce boat!! (Not literally of course, but that's how good the sauce is.)

Although my 3 companions loved the duck, I thought the sauce lacked a little something. Granted, I did not use raspberry vinegar - but did follow all the other ingredients faithfully. I would make it again, but perhaps make some adjustments so that sauce had a deeper blackberry flavor and less beef broth taste.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe countless times since discovering it, and it is THE ONLY way to eat duck! All the previous reviews are very helpful, and I agree that the sauce needs to boil much longer to really thicken (or just add cornstarch if you're lazy like I am). I slice the breasts into medallions and place them atop a moulded mountain of thickened sweet potato puree, which I make with a dash of the Cognac to compliment the sauce, and then pour a pool of the sauce around the sweet potatoes. Garnish with julienned, steamed zucchinni, squash, etc. for color. This recipe is like Chopin for your tastebuds--just watch the dinner table break out into pandemonium. I like a fruity, red wine from the burgundy region, or, for a twist, a hearty chianti.

DELICIOUS! yummy and great, not too hard to do....don't know if the maple syrup was really needed, it was definatly a flavour that could be picked out...and the duck certainly needed more than 3 minutes in the oven, but i'd make this again. the sauce would be great with pork too!

Roasted whole ducks for 2 3/4 hr. at 350 to make very crisp, periodically removing fat from the the pan. I doubled the sauce recipe (3 ducks) and added extra sugar and then arrowroot to help thicken. No cognac but used all other ingredients. Really was a great hit. Sauce is a complex sweet and sour. Even my grumpy father in law liked it enough to praise it.

We recently moved to a remote village in Provence and found beautiful wild blackberries in the mountains. I used what I had in the house--red wine (Cotes du Ventoux)instead of white wine and cognac and lavender honey instead of maple syrup. I used all chicken broth no beef. It was absolutely amazing! The quality of the duck here is superb, and the taste of the blackberries was unbelievable. I wanted to make it again with the actual ingredients and my husband asked me not to change a thing!

Okay, I could only find frozen duck, but had the butcher saw it in quarters, and when I got home I thawed and de-boned it. A lot of work, but SO WORTH IT. I also subbed the blackberries for fresh raspberries. It was a five-alarm riot at the dinner table - this is the BEST duck recipe ever. Easy, not too "gourmet-intimidating", delicious, even for kids or old folks. I served it on a bed of couscous with kiwifruit and broiled banana squash. Home Run.

Made this to accompany a whole duck roasted on a rotisserie. Very, very good! (And I don't really care for duck). The flavors compliment each other very nicely. The only problem I had was that I couldn't get cognac (made it for Sun. dinner during a trip down South...), so I used the only closest thing - sherry. Its taste came through a little strongly. Also had to use red wine vinager, so I added about 3 tbs. cran-raspberry juice. And...I used mixed berries (raspberries and blackberries) because that's all we could get. Served with fresh blackberries - will be making this again (next time, hopefully, I'll be able to get all the ingredients and it'll be 4 forks)!

I have been making this for years, often for people who would never eat duck. It is always a silent meal, except for the groans of delight. It works beautifully with pan-fired deboned duck breast, BBQ duck breast (best) and whole BBQ rotissed duck with the sauce on the side. Also seems to be more elegant on the plate than its simple preparation would indicate.

We received some duck breasts and foie gras (from Hudson Valley Farms) as a wedding present, and here was finally my chance to make this dish, which appeared in the first "Bon Appetite" magazine that I ever read. I make and freeze my own demi-glace, which I used along with all-fruit blackberry preserves to replace the not-in-my-store frozen berries. And who says you need muscovy duck breasts for this? Why? We used the widely available moulard (the so-called "magret") and it was just fabulous. This is a sauce dish, the duck is a supporting actor here. You can even over-cook the breasts (for the squeamish), and the sauce will bring it home anyway.

I was not impressed with this dish. I made it yesterday for a Valentine's dinner and was rather disappointed, especially considering the expense of the blackberries. I used a whole duck and cooked it in the rotisserie, which turned out great.

Outrageously good. Made this for a dinner party with 4 whole ducks and quadrupled the recipe. Made ducks using the "beer can" method (look up "beer can chicken on the web")and had to truss 2 ducks together to make them stand up. Pricking the skin will get crispier results; 500 degrees for 30 min. then 425. Make sauce a day ahead, as it takes a while to reduce. Ducks are smokey. Two people are 20-year members of a monthly gormet dinner club in which they critique the dinners. They rated this "outstanding, one of the five best meals ever eaten." Made with wild rice with wild mushrooms, asparagus and drank cotes du rhone. Need a good fruit forward wine for this one.

Rating: 4
This sauce is absolutely excellent. Just be sure to fine-tune it to your taste. If too sweet, hit with a tsp. of vinegar; if not sweet enough, more brown sugar. If too thin, thicken with corn starch or beurre maniere (my favorite); if too thick, add more broth or white wine. Is excellent with raspberries as well and goes wonderfully with venison loin.

I took a lot of liberties with this dish - and it's still fantastic. I used chicken broth rather than beef broth, blueberries rather than raspberries and blueberry vinegar rather than blackberry vinegar - & I used a whole duck. I made it for my mother's birthday and she said it was the best duck she'd ever eaten.

There is a restaurant here in Wilmington that serves a dish almost exactly like this and I order it almost every time we go there. I was so happy to find this. It turned out to be as good as everyone else says. I do agree, however, that the sauce benefits from some thickening. Mine was very thin, which just tends to look a little messier on the plate. It still tasted great. I served this with wild rice and steamed carrots with nutmeg. Delicious!

Rating: 4
This is my hands-down favorite, "go to" special occasion dish. In fact, the entire Febuary 1996 Bon Appetit issue is full of terrific recipes. When I first read the sauce ingredients, I thought it would be too sweet but it isn't. It is a perfectly balanced sauce for duck (also fabulous for chicken and pork). I've tried slight alterations of the recipe but I certainly don't recommend any for this wonderful dish.

I love duck, every time my husband and I go out for a really nice dinner on an anniversery or birthday, if duck is on the menu I usally order it. I must say this was incrediable! Instead of just doing the breasts. I did a whole duck on the barbeque rotisserie. It was nice because all the fat dripped on to the drip pan and the skin was nice and crispy.I served it with a sundried tomato rissoto and sauted asparagus. I think it sure compares to any gourmet restuarant duck that I have ever had duck in.

I used chicken for this receipe and it was great! Never had a problem with the meat smoking... I added the sauce after I cooked the chicken. I added some cornstarch and extra sugar (brown sugar) to the sauce before I approved of the taste and consistency.

Yummy sauce! Does need to be boiled down a lot more than recipe specifies. Can also be thickened with some corn starch. I roasted a whole duck in oven and served with sauce, but did come up with the usual problem with duck - all that fat under the skin. Next time, I will try just breasts.

I made this dish for New Year's Eve dinner, served with wild rice and asparagus. The sauce actually thickened before time -- maybe because I was using a homemade beef/veal stock rather than canned beef stock. The sauce was a beautiful color, and very tasty but didn't quite reach "dish beyond compare" for me. Perhaps just a touch too sweet.

I've made this dish 4 times in the past year -- it's absolute heaven, and very easy to make. Definitely the dish you want to serve to impress company, or surprise your family. I do find the sauce a bit thin, so I add some flour towards the end to thicken it up.

Made this for Christmas Eve dinner, and liked it very much. I was unable to get blackberries, so used raspberries instead; I think it would be even better w/blackberries, and will do it again when I can get them. As others have said, the sauce is not really sweet in the way you'd expect from the ingredients (I actually added a teaspoon of sugar at the end), and if properly reduced, is very intensely flavored. I don't eat beef and I wanted something with more flavor and body than all canned chicken broth, so I made a very reduced stock from chicken wings. This has the gelatin and flavor to give the sauce nice body. The dish paired nicely with a lemon risotto and a bottle of fruity zinfandel.

We made this dish for our 2-person Thanksgiving dinner. The duck tasted lovely in the sauce. The sauce took quite a bit longer to reduce than the recipe indicated (~40 minutes); it does truly thicken up and is worth the wait.

Last Monday I had nothing in the house except a muscovy duck breast, a bit of leftover steak, some frozen raspberries, some fresh oranges, and the other ingredients listed in this recipe. So I made the duck breast, reheated the steak, made the sauce, and basked in the standing ovation from my family. I'll make this one again for company! It works well with any strongly flavored meat.

This was heaven for your mouth. I used rasberries instead and the sauce came perfectly. The sauce was not too fruity and we all tasted the hint of maple syrup, cognac and brown sugar. I took tiny bites to make this eating experience last as long as possible. It was a sad moment when the final speck of this yummy sauce was eaten.

This is an unbelievably quick and easy recipe to prepare. Probably no more than an hour from start to elegant service. I grilled the duck for flavor and crispness. (Living in Oregon, the blackberries were no problem..I have bags of flashfrozen berries in my freezer from last year's bumper crop!)The sauce is actually not as sweet as it sounds, the blackberries balance it out. I served it with a Petite Syrah. A keeper!

Make sure you reduce the sauce to not more than one cup (mine was a little thin but the flavour was delicious).

As stated previously, this is a very good recipe. However, I think it would've been better with BONELESS duck breasts. They're much easier to manage in the frying pan, probably cook a little quicker, and they sit better with the sauce on the plate. I also thought the sauce would be a bit richer than it turned out. I could only find raspberry balsamic vinegar, not just raspberry vinegar (if there is such) - maybe that made a fatal difference.

Don't be afraid of this recipe, it IS as easy as stated. Looks great on the plate and my guests for christmas dinner all asked for the recipe. served it with fruited wild rice, green beans and agood Merlot.

We made this for our Wall Street Journal "Open Thata Bottle Night" in 1999. This is a great recipe. We grill the breasts and the skin crisps up nicely. When I cannot find blackberries, I use frozen raspberries. The dish needs a fruity wine like a good Zin or Pinot.

I used a whole duck, taken from the oven about an hour before it was ready to be served. Then I cut them in half and put them back in over for about 30 minutes so the skin could crisp. The sauce was marvelous. I recommend using fresh blackberries.

The sauce is to die for! Next time I will sear the skin longer, until it is crispy and more fat is rendered. The dish was still delicious and mouth watering. My wife does not like the taste of duck, so I made chicken breasts for her and she rated it 4 forks.

This is a fabulous recipe. I deboned a whole duck (including the leg pieces) and it turned out beautifully. Fabulous flavours. I too would suggest using fresh blackberries; the flavour is richer and more intense.

Truly one of the best things we have ever made. Extremely easy. We used a different blend of berries including rasberries, cherries and ever a little cranberry.

This is a perfect dinner party dish because the sauce can be made in advance. I have made this twice, the second time grilling the duck breasts. I thought it turned out just as well and it is not as messy as preparing the duck in a frying pan. Fresh blackberries should be used for a richer flavor. Your guests will think that you slaved for hours on this one!

A wonderful mix of flavors. Mild, yet striking combination. We couldn't stop "mmmm-ing" with every bite!

This recipe was delicious! My husband usually doesn't like fruit mixed with meat/poultry but he loved this. I used more blackberries than the recipe called for and it turned out great.

Definitely a "do-over". Decadent and delicious. The type of duck makes a huge difference in this recipe. We prefer the smaller breasted Muscovy. Make this meal when you want to truly impress. The fresh green beans and garnish of fresh blackberries really set off the presentation.

Don't be scared off by any poultry that isn't chicken; duck has wonderful flavor and texture. This recipe is not difficult; the most important thing is to sear the duck adequately before roasting. This dish quite impressed a guest at my table, who is a professional chef in a well known California restaurant. Steamed spinach with butter paired nicely with the duck; select a merlot or zinfandel with plenty of fruit / berry.

This is one of the most fabulous recipes. I make it every time I have a special dinner party. I highly recommend it. I would suggest using fresh orange juice and fresh blackberries if available. It's delicious!
