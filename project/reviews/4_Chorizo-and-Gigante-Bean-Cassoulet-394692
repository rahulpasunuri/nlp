I was searching for a Basque Recipe for beans and came across this. Nice surprise. I didn't use an onion, and I used 1 cup of Sherry, used white beans instead the... Gigante? Instead bread crumbs on top, I covere the bottom of a casserole dish with day old bread, baked it for an hour after merrying for a day. I never heard of cassoulet, it sounded like casserole. Amazing dish, and the leftovers were even better.

I loved this recipe and my husband did too, which is saying something since he is not a fan of beans. Very flavorful! I got the fresh chorizo @ Whole Foods.

Found this recipe when I was trying to use up a large can of gigante beans. Skipped the bean cooking part, substituted shallots for leeks, used extra chicken broth to replace the bean broth, used italian sausages (can usually only find mexican chorizo here). Unlike others who have reviewed this, i found the flavor to be complex and intense, WOW. Saving this one, it's a keeper.

I made this exactly as directed, except that I did not make the topping because I did not have the ingredients. It was very flavorful but not outstanding. I tripled the spices and it was still not fantastic.

this is a wonderful cassoulet recipe - just the thing to warm you up on a dark wet day here in Seattle! We'll definitely be making this again!

First off, I made a half recipe. Used Christmas Lima Beans which were a little old, and they needed all the cooking time and then some, but came out wonderfully after all that. Judge the cooking time by your beans, not the recipe. And then the sausage - we got imported Spanish Chorizo from the Spanish market here, but it wasn't "fresh" = raw, it was pre-cooked; but it was perfect. To note, it was not the dried chorizo that is in all the stores here. Maybe it's time Epicurious realizes that there are a gazillion varieties of chorizo - here we can get Spanish, Colombian, Venezuelan, Peruvian, most of which dried, but some "fresh", but seldom Mexican -- and then also the "fresh" i.e. raw stuff from Whole Foods. A better definition in the recipe would be useful. However, with these beans and this sausage, this was really good. I'm going to make it again this weekend for my homebound Spanish-born mother-in-law; I think she'll love it.

This was great! I used the recipe as more of a guide and it turned out great. I cooked Flageolet beans earlier in the day so omitted many of the bean cooking steps which saved time. I also used turkey chorizo and skipped the breadcrumb topping. Also, I didnt have rosemary, anchovies, thyme or the tomatoes (though i did add tomato paste). Even with all these things left out it was amazing! I served it over undressed mixed greens. Will try again when I have all the ingredients as I do think the lemon would be an interesting flavor with it.

My husband made this with large Christmas Lima beans, fresh chicken Chorizo from Whole Foods, and home-made lamb broth in place of the chicken broth. Incredible results- rich, intense, and spicy. The best lima bean experience of our lives. The bread crumbs, parsley, and lemon zest are important finishing touches. Incredible.

Really delicious. My whole family (including 14 month old and 4 year old) loved this. Agree with previous posters about not overcooking the beans, but I would take it a step further: I don't think they need any precooking beyond the initial boil and hourlong soak. I did only this, and the subsequent cooking in the oven was more than enough. I cannot imagine having boiled them for another hour before--they would be mush.

Had this for company tonight- no leftovers! It was a hella hit!

To "A Cook from Denver"--Field Roast (brand) Mexican Chipotle flavor sausage are a great vegetarian alternative for chorizo--tasty enough to satisfy even meat eaters. Whole Foods sells them in the refrigerator case

To A Cook From Denver: There is a very tasty veg chorizo 'sausage' widely available in the fresh vegetarian section (produce department) next to the tofu dogs, etc. I've even seen it at Wal-Mart.

I tried to make this last night, but even pre-soaking the beans, it takes upwards of four hours to complete, so it's probably best for a weekend project, or it would be an excellent candidate for the crock pot. Also, an hour and a half was WAY too long to boil the gigante beans--they almost disintegrated! So check yours earlier and pull them off the stove just when tender, as there's still lots more cooking time after that. I ended up adding some cannellini beans to the mix to fix my problem. Also, I only used a pound of sausage, which was plenty, in my opinion. Finally, like the other reviewer, I toasted up some panko in olive oil and butter, added the parsley and lemon and called it a day! My tip: Don't omit the smoked paprika--it's the defining flavor of the dish!

Looks wonderful. Does anyone have a suggestion for the (please don't gag!) best possible vegetarian substitute for the chorizo or hot Italian sausage in this recipe?

This was awesome. My husband doesn't like beans and he ADORED this one. This would be the perfect dish for a cold day and is excellent as a leftover. I would serve it for a dinner party...fyi Whole Foods carries fresh chorizo sausage--don't use the dried version as it is totally different.

This was very different from what I expected. It was wonderful though. I have to say the lemon zest at the end is a pretty neat touch. I might even go so far as to say it's crucial.

Really good. I didn't think I'd like it much but it was very tasty. A good late winter/early spring dish. I used lima beans. The benas didn't need to cook as long as they said in the recipe. In fact I would cook them much less in the first cooking - stopping when they were still a little crisp to the bite because there is a lot more cooking time left - plenty of time for them to be done and not become too mushy. I also used panko for my crumbs and drizzled with oil. Worked fine and less trouble.
