The recipe was very easy. I prefer no bake cheesecake over the traditional cheesecake. This receipe was very quick as required very little effort. I gave my co-worker a slice on Thanksgiving and now she wants me to make her on for Christmas!

Went with low fat ingredients, loved how light and flavorful it was. Perfect cheesecake substitute for those late night cravings. Would love to try it again with different fruits or even frozen!

Wonderful! I used low fat sour cream, cream cheese and Cool Whip and this turned out light and very mousse-y. Not quite the texture of a regular no-bake cheesecake because it was so super light and airy but I topped it with my homemade strawberry rhubarb sauce and could not believe it was so low fat and fabulous. Not to mention easy to make. Thank you!

This should have 4 forks for easiness. Flavor is good - not massive cheesecake flavor but nice. And was handy to throw together on a hot night and put in the freezer in place of ice cream pie. Put fresh strawberries, peaches and blackberries on top. Big hit!

I made this as a quick and easy desert when having family over. It was a hit and honestly took me less than 10 minutes to put together. The time and fussing that goes into a regular cheesecake....no more. My one change was to use Creme Fraiche instead of sour cream.
