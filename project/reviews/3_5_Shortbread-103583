This isn't bad but for true shortread texture, the butter should be rubbed in and the shortbread should be baked at 300F.

great basic recipe- wonderfule with minced candied ginger and great with a dollop of lemon curd before baking. We make these all the time.

This is an easy, flexible recipe that I now use as my standard. I use it for cookies and for tart shells on a regular basis, and I love that it can be doubled or halved to suit my purposes. It's definitely what I would consider a traditional shortbread taste...buttery and sweet with a crisp crunch to it. I usually cook it a bit longer than recommended to get nice golden color and a bit more snap.

My 10 year old daughter loves to make these. I like how there is a nice mild vanilla flavor.

This is a great, quick recipe. I added a teaspoon of freshly ground cardamom and about two teaspoons of fresh lemon zest, omitting the vanilla extract. I gently rolled it out on a marble board and cut round cookies using cocktail glasses. I also substituted pastry flour the second time, which gave them a little gloss and accentuated the spices.

I make this for my family a lot and they always eat it up within the day, it is really easy and really fast. Just a nice snack to have with a hot drink.

I baked the shortbread in a mold, cut it into little squares and served it with homemade raspberry jam - it was fabulous!

Delish! I can't belive how quick and easy and yummy they were. I baked them for about 12 minutes, and cut them into little dainty squares. A must try!

My 4 year old daughter and I made this recipe. Instead of baking as traditional shortbread we used cookie stamps with the Little Mermaid and Flounder. They turned out looking great and tasting great. Very easy and very delicious!

I felt like baking while at a friend's house with VERY minimal pantry inventory (no vanilla?!), so I sprinkled these with cinnamon sugar. I took them out after 13 minutes. Quite yummy.

I first made these cookies when I saw it in the magazine. Oh, so easy and fast! After making them several times, I lost the magazine. After several tries to find it on the internet, and finding many other more complicated shortbread recipes, it finally showed up at epicurious.com! Yay!
