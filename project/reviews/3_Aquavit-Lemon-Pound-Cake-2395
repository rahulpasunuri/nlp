One of the BEST pound cake recipes. I use limoncello and poppy seeds. Serve with a berry compote. Freezes well, so it's the perfect cake to make for company!

Quite good--and I agree, use poppy seeds with the lemon. Easy, excellent recipe, which I've made a number of times.

Every recipe I've tried from this web site has turned out fabulous, but the pound cake was a severe disappointment. It was like a solid bar of lead after it had cooled, and was very un-poundcakelike in its dryness. The only thing I can think of was maybe I baked it too long? The center was still wet when I tested it at 1 hr and 20 mins as the recipe suggested, though....

This is a fantastic recipe, except that I hate Aquavit and caraway seeds. Instead I made one with Limoncello and poppy seed -- the best lemon pound cake I've ever had; and another I substituted cointreaux and chocolate. It's a fool-proof recipe that allows you to change the flavor easily.

Good, but I think this would be better with poppy seeds rather than caraway seeds. They just don't seem to fit with a "cake".

The guy with all the capitals needs to calm down. all the exclamation points are too happy for me.

To the cook who inquired as to what aquavit is, I found this definition in the gourmet magazine dictionary: AQUAVIT - A strong colorless Scandinavian liquor distilled from grain or potatoes and flavored with caraway seed. It is served icy cold and drunk in a single gulp.
