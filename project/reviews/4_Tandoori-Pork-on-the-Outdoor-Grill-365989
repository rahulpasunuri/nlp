Wow. This was fabulous! I made pretty much according to recipe, except I substituted regular chili paste/sauce (didn't have "Indian paste), lime juice instead of lemon, and veg oil. Even tho I had to put in the fenugreek grains as-is (hand grinding them down didn't work), its unique flavor was definitely appreciated. Served on yogurt/lime juice-slathered naan with cucumber ribbons soaked in a little fish sauce. YUM. Frankly, the flavors here are sophisticated enough to try a more formal entree approach, so next time I'll try with some jeweled rice or similar and report back!

I made this for out-of-town family and they loved it! I used 2 pork chops, as that's what I had available, and made my own cucumber sauce. I didn't have all of the spices for the marinade, sub it didn't matter. It turned out very tasty, and pretty easy to do too, as long as you remember to set aside time to marinate in advance. Served with grilled cauliflower and grilled bok choy. Very impressive and rave reviews from all.

This was SO good. The only ingredient I didn't have on hand was the fenugreek. It turned out to be more of a "rub"...but I let it marinate overnight and did it on the grill. Absolutely delicious. The flavor was really good.

Fabulous! Didn't have mustard oil so used peanut oil. This recipe rocks. Marinate pork chops all day and grill them for dinner. We've been eating it once a week and make enough for leftovers! Don't skimp on the gawwwlic!

Excellent meal! Could not find fenugreek or mustard oil, so I just left out & used olive oil. Lovely flavors, and not too hard to prepare. Loved dipping everything in yogurt... I used Greek yogurt. Paired this with whole wheat naan.... yum.
