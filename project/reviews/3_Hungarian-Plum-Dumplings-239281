In Italy we have a recipe like this, but with less ingredients; our traditional dough is with baking powder and not potato-based. This is our traditional way for plum dumplings from Friuli: http://www.academiabarilla.com/italian-recipes/friuli-venezia-giulia/plum-dumplings.aspx

I made these dumplings for my family's thanksgiving and they were an all around hit! We couldn't stop eating them, and they are just as delicious when they have cooled. Though they are quite a lot of work I would certainly make them again.

Okay.... but not making this again. Maybe I didn't add enough flour, but the dough was very very sticky and hard to work with.

Reminds me of a Georg Lang recipe I used to make occaisionally on weekends! I never thought I'd see it again. His used confectionery sugar as a garnish

Not time consuming at all - with some training... ;o) I don't roll out the dough. Just grab a prune size amount of dough, form a ball, flatten, put the plum in, close, and off to the next one. Also, this is a sweet main course, not a desert. At least that's how it was served in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. A soup, followed by dumplings... Very good indeed...

These were really tasty. Those who were skeptical to know their dessert was being made with potatoes were quickly won over. Don't skip the crumb topping. They are time consuming, though, not necessarily your choice for a dinner party. They must be served warm.
