A fabulous recipe, but it's not unique to the Three Cities of Spain coffeehouse ... my mom has been making essentially the same recipe since the mid-70s. She got it from my aunt Sandra, who supposedly got it from a restaurant in NYC... More than 30 years later, it's still my favorite.

Perfect as is. Light and fluffy for a cheesecake. Though I had to bake mine slightly longer than the recipe suggested by about 10 minutes. I served mine with sugared blueberries.

I did this recipe yesterday and my family ate the entire cheesecake today. It's really delicious. I baked mine for 45 minutes but it came out completely set and not wobbly at the center. It's important to know your oven. Also I didn't made the topping and reduced the sugar to a bit more of 3/4 cup and used an Oreo crust.

This is a fantastic recipe. The sour cream topping covered any cracks. You could add citrus zest to it and it would also be great. I would not use chocolate cookie crust for this but instead graham cracker. I use a glass to get the crust up the sides of the pan. Be sure to cook it the night before so there is no stress. You can't rush the chilling process.

Simple to make and outstanding to enjoy. Was called "award winning" by a guest! Would make again in a heartbeat. Only modification was I added 3 Tbsp sugar to the sour cream topping as I wanted it a little sweater. Some minor cracks, but next time I'll leave it in the cooling oven for a bit.

I really wrecked this recipe - the cooking time was way too low and I failed to check adequately that it was done before I took it out of the oven. Of the parts that were edible, it was good with the chocolate cookie crust I made with it, but I didn't like the sour cream topping as I thought it was bland and overly tart.

Rating: 4
I love this recipe! It is perfect for a simple, quick cheesecake and does not require many ingredients. Since I don't like sour cream topping, I instead topped the cake with a strawberry topping (basically strawberries boiled in sugar and pureed) and it came out perfect! I also ran the cheese mixture through a strainer before baking to avoid any lumps and it came out very creamy. :)

I made this into cheesecake bars. First, I made 1.5 times the crust recipe. I pressed it into a 9x13 pan and baked for 30 minutes before adding topping. After adding the topping, I baked for another 8 minutes. I lined the pan with parchment paper so I could remove the bars after chilling in fridge and cut neatly.

Made this cake for friends and family a number of times. Everyone loved it. One friend put the cake on their menu at their restaurant in Johannesburg. Only change was that graham crackers are nearly impossible to find in South Africa so simple crushed shortbread cookies and moistened with melted butter.

I made for Easter and guests raved about it. It was absolutely delicious. I used Trader Joes graham crackers which are ten times better than the regular store bought ones and I think the crust came out exceptional because of it. While I baked the cheesecake I put a pan full of water underneath while it baked to make the cheesecake moist. I shut off the oven when the baking time was done and left the cheesecake in for 15 minutes. This helps avoid cracking. Also I completely cool it before adding the topping which also helps avoid cracking. Lastly I added 3 Tbsp sugar to the sour cream topping as 1 Tbsp didn't seem like enough. Came out great.

I haven't made cheesecake in years! So this was a kind of experiment. I had intended to make something else and had loads of cream cheese and was looking for good quick solution. This was super easy and great. I took it to work this a.m. and everyone seemed to love it as well as leftover dessert tonight. Light fluffy good flavor and easy. I did sub an oreo crust (21 oreos & 1/4 C soft butter in processor, pressed in shell or springform) baked 10 minutes @ 350) because I didn't have grahams on hand and it was easily as good. Very easy. Highly recommended. Loved the topping and add fresh berries.

So creamy and smooth! This is the recipe I always make when friends ask for a plain (non-candy, non-frufru or specialty) cheesecake. I follow the suggestion to pre-bake the crust and have found success with it not getting soggy.

Rating: 0
The best way to keep your crust from getting soggy is to add it after the cheesecake has baked. Got this from Rose Levy Berenbaum. Don't put a crust in the bottom of your pan; instead line the bottom with a piece of parchment. Then, after the cheesecake has baked and cooled, pop it out of the springform pan, strip off the parchment paper and pat on a nice layer of crust. Sometimes, to make the process easier, I'll put the cheesecake back in the springform pan upside down to pat the crust on. Works great as long as you don't forget to take the parchment off before patting on the crust - don't ask me how I know lol.

The first time I made it the cake top got really brown and cracked badly. The next time I used a covered roasting pan and filled it w/boiling water up to the roasting-rack and it came out perfect! On the second attempt I also added some sour cream to the batter and more vanilla and sugar to the topping.

Rating: 0
Re: How do you prevent the crust from getting soggy? You should try blind-baking it first; make the crust recipe, chill it, and then bake for about 8 minutes at 375 or so. Then cool it in the 'fridge or freezer again, and voila - your crust won't be soggy. :) Until the cheesecake sits for awhile, of course...

Fantastic, and the three-day life expectancy is accurate. The presentation is lovely--the contrast between topping and cake is exquisite. I served them with balsamic strawberries thanks to another reviewer's recommendation.

Wow. Like many other reviewers, this was my first cheesecake and the results were both beautiful and delicious. I used 1 pkg lo-fat cream cheese as several reviewers suggested and lo-fat sour cream and added about 1 t. lemon zest and 1/8 c. lemon juice, which added a wonderful lemony flavor. The one change that I might make next time is to cut the topping in half. There was some debate about whether the cheesecake would be better with or without the topping and I thought that having a bit less of it might be a happy compromise. Still, a winner as is. Thanks!

This cheesecake got raves from restaurant owners. The only adjustment (s) I made - I had a 10" pan and only 8 oz sour cream. I used classic grahams so used the full amount of sugar and just increased the amount but not proportions. And I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the crust. Delicious!

Also my first un-cracked cheesecake, I baked as directed, but beat the cream cheese on a low setting.

Great cheesecake recipe. Made a little mistake by topping it with strawberries - this cake doesn't need it (or maybe serve it on the side). It's beautiful and flavorful all on it's own. The fruit masked too much of it's delicate flavor. Also, the recipe doesn't call for it, but bake the crust at 350 for 10 minutes and allow to cool before filling. Don't know why that was omitted... Will definitely bake this many many times!

I've made this cheesecake 4 or 5 times, always with rave reviews. It is savory, but light. I make the crust out of oreo cookies because we like chocolate a lot. Sometimes I add a fruit coulis. It is fantastic with coffee in the afternoon! The only down point: May be a bit eggy for some?

Absolutely spectacular. I can not serve this cheesecake without getting further requests for it. For the crust, I follow the linked recipe, but only use 1 T of sugar to keep it from being overwhelmingly sweet. For the topping, I use 16 oz of crema mexicana instead of sour cream and omit the sugar as crema mexicana is much sweeter than sour cream. I do not make any changes to the filling.

What is all this nonsense of "baking in water" about? Bake it as it says - it is perfect every time! I have made this recipe so many times and family and friends think it is perfect. Smooth, creamy and easy! I serve fresh berries on the side. You can't change perfection.

This was delicious. Perfect, basic cheesecake recipe. Definitely better the day after it's made. The only thing I'd do differently is bake the crust for about 10 minutes (and cool) before filling. My 5-year old wanted to bake a cheesecake in her little 4" springform pan, so this was perfect - not too many ingredients, and not beyond a 5-year old's capabilities; we made the little one for her and a big one with the rest of the ingredients. Oh, and I beat everything on high the whole time (wasn't paying attention to the directions), with no adverse effects. Also put about 1/3" of water in the baking pan on which the springforms went into the oven, after wrapping the springforms with foil. Creamy & delicious. Froze 3/4 of it so I wouldn't eat it all in a couple days.

I made it for my dad's birthday, and it turned out very well - looked and tasted like a store-bought cheesecake. From the reviews, I think I expected something more, but overall it was very good - I'd make it again, possibly with a more exciting topping. For the topping this time, sour cream seemed a bit bland, so I used the topping recipe and mixed it in a food processor with strawberries and graham crackers. I think it added to the taste of the cheesecake.

Very good cheesecake and all said it was light and delicious. My ingredients were a tad on the cold side so I just beat the cheese and sugar a bit longer in the mixer. No problems with the sour cream topping either. I always put a pan of hot water on the rack below the cheesecake in lieu of a water bath, and it seems to work well.

I made this with the pan and without the water bath. My ingredients weren't at room temp either. I whipped the whole thing in a food processor. The only change I made was to whip the sugar and cream cheese together first, then do the eggs one at a time. This is a perfect cheesecake. So it cracked in the middle a bit. Didn't change the wonderful, silky texture or the perfection of the cheesecake flavor. Yum

After much thinking about how many forks to give the recipe I settled on giving it three. The reason was threefold. First, I had to make the recipe twice because I did not have my ingredients at room temperature. Yes, it's my fault but there is no mention of it in the directions. Secondly, the second time I made it, I put it in an addition pan like it said, but I did not give it a 'water bath' therefore causing the cheesecake to crack. Luckily, the sour cream topping does a great job of covering up the crack. Did everyone else know to give it a water bath or did anyone else make this recipe with the water and have the cheesecake not crack? I'm curious. .. please let me know! Please make a note: try to blend the ingredients on a LOW setting. A higher setting means more air bubbles are whipped in thereby giving it a higher chance of sinking in the middle. I ALMOST put it in a high setting, but luckily restrained myself. Lastly, this cake tasted AMAZING once it had chilled for 7 hours, come to room temperature and then was put back in the fridge for another 12 hours. Basically, this cheesecake tastes great 24 hours later, but 7 hours later this cheesecake was too hard and each layer tasted like its own entity instead of tasting like a uniform whole. I will make it again - its a wonderful tasting cheesecake. However, this time I will bake the crust before hand, use a water bath, wait 24 hours, and maybe do even more things...well...differently.

I made this for my sister-in-law's birthday, and she RAVED about it. She and several of my relatives said it was the best cheesecake they'd ever tasted. It's not brick-heavy the way some cheesecakes are. My cheesecake pan is extra large, so I added one package of cream cheese, one egg, 1/4 cup sugar, and a dash more vanilla to the batter, and it filled up the pan beautifully. I also used a flour-based crust because I don't like sweet crusts, but I'm sure it'd be fine with any crust. People love this cheesecake, I'm tellin' you!

The texture of this cheesecake is very creamy (as others have noted) even though I accidently left it in the oven for about 2 hours. This was partly because I'd (again accidently) turned the temperature to 300. The suggestion I'd have is to add some flavour to this as there is really no flavour. I'd add at least a pinch of salt and some grated lemon peel. The idea of using real vanilla bean is probably good too.

I have made several cheesecakes and this one received the best reviews. The cream cheese topping adds the right touch to the velvety texture of the cheesecake. I also drizzled some caramel topping & chocolate (with a touch of cream) that adds some pizzaz and another layer to this great recipe.

Truth be told, I didn't make this *exact* recipe, but... it's almost identical to the well-loved cheesecake that I've been making for decades - the straightforward Cheese Cake recipe from the River Road Recipes cookbook published by the Junior League of Baton Rouge. I think my recipe is better, which means decreasing the sugar from 1 cup to 3/4. I use ultra fine baking sugar. For the topping, skip the vanilla (it discolors it) and use 1/4 cup sugar. I bake mine for 35 minutes and don't bother with the 5 minute waiting period for the topping. Any crust works, but the graham is the classic and my son's favorite. To jazz it up, make an oreo crust, spread a jar of caramel or dulce de leche topping sauce and sprinkle with chopped pecans before pouring in the filling. And sprinkle more chopped pecans when you take it out of the oven for the last time.

I made this cheesecake & brought the left overs to work. Everyone loved it. The light, rich texture of the cheesecake works wonderfully with the creamy sour cream mixture. I added some melted chocolate (with a little cream) & caramel on top for a little extra richness & pizzaz. It was a huge hit.

Rating: 3
The first time I made this, it was a disappointment. I didn't care for the sour cream topping at all, plus it soaked into the cheesecake and made it mushy. Also, the graham cracker crust was much too sweet. I then tried it a second time without the sour cream topping, and with much less sugar in the crust and a little less sugar in the filling, and it was delicious. I would rate the first cheesecake with the sour cream topping a "1" and the second one without the topping a "4." So, I am giving this a rating of "3."

This cheesecake was yummy; perfect texture, baking time (45 minutes exactly) and no cracking. It had a great taste, and everyone gobbled it up at Easter.

For a basic cheesecake, this is awesome - very smooth and creamy texture. Its great just as the recipe states, but when serving it with a fresh fruit topping such as stawberries, I like a hint of lemon flavor to the cake.

This was the best cheesecake that I've ever had. It was creamy and had wonderful texture. I made it for a birthday party and everyone loved it. I served it with carmel and fudge drizzled over it and some nuts sprinkled on top and it was the best.

I don't make cheesecake often because most recipes I've tried have seemed just like everyone else's. This one, however, was definitely a huge cut above. I served this with rave reviews to people who say they don't even particularly like cheesecake.

Yum!Yum!Yum! This recipe fulfilled my cheesecake fantasy, it was just delicious and so easy to make. I used cinnamon graham crackers in the crust and used a bit less sugar.

The very best cheeseke I have been making this recipe for 20 years. Try adding some fruit filling Solo is a great brand but also all fruit in the jelly, preserve section. Try substituting chocolate cookie crumbs for the graham crackers in the crust yum.

When I made this cheesecake for my sister-in-laws birthday, everyone in the family loved it, even those that don't normally eat cheesecake. I definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a creamy cheesecake

I made it without the sour cream topping and it was still fabulous. I had it for a birthday dinner for my father because he loves cheesecake and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.

I have made this cheesecake numerous times, always with rave reviews! In fact, I am including it on one of my many holiday menus this year. I do agree with baking it longer, especially in our high altitude.

I made this cheesecase for a friends birthday, and got rave reviews! The sour cream topping wasn't sweet enough to suit my tastes, so I added extra sugar, and substituted lemon juice for the vanilla extract. Also, I significantly lowered the amount of sour cream for the topping. All in all a great recipe that I will definitely use again.

This is the best cheesecake; the instructions are simple and accurate. The graham cracker crust as recommended is perfect. Everyone raved about this recipe for weeks after it was served. P.S. Did anyone try the luscious apricot bars from the June 2000 issue of Gourmet? What a disaster! I notice the recipe is not to be found in this index. The editors of Gourmet owe an apology to the readers!

Nice and easy. I made the crust with vanilla wafers. I think graham crackers would have been better. Will make again.
