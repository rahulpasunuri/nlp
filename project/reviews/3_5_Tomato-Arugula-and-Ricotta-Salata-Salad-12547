This was the perfect starter salad for an Italian meal. The flavors blend together beautifully. I used feta instead of ricotta salata. I like the tany/salty flavor of feta much better.

This salad uses familiar ingredients but the combination is magical. The dressing in particular is very good -- something about mashing the garlic with the vinegars, maybe? And the finely shredded oregano is a wonderful accent. Yum!

This dressing is great on anything! Also I have substuted fresh mozzarella for the Ricotta Salata!
