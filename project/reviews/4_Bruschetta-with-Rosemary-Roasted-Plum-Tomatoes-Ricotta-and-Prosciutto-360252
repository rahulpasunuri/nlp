Excellent combination of flavors. Can be a bit salty depending on brand of prosciutto so be careful on additional salt in oil marinade. Used baby arugula and they looked beautiful. Try this recipe. You won't be disappointed.

Perfect bite. Delicious.

Good appetizer. Made with feta and also tried Mozarella cheeses. Husband preferred the latter. Definitely is salty...so didn't season the dressing and went lighter on the marinade for the tomatoes.

This recipe definitely gets 4 forks from me! I doubled the recipe and the appetizer still disappeared in minutes. I use a little less pepper as my personal preference does not lean towards a lot of heat and it does build as you eat these. To save time I've roasted the tomatoes and the bread the day before. Just be sure to put the bread in a ziplock bag once it's cooled and to bring the tomatoes to room temperature before assembling the appetizer. In a pinch I've substituted fresh chopped chives in place of the lemon juice/microgreens/baby arugula topping. It was still a great hit!

Absolutely amazing. I have made it several times and always receive rave reviews. If you like a slightly stronger flavor try fresh goat cheese (not feta). Either way this is an awesome recipe!

My husband constantly asks for this! I've replaced the prosciutto with Genoa salami and foregone the microgreens and both adjustments are great for a less pretentious taste. This is great as an appetizer for guests or as a light summertime dinner!

FABULOUS summer appetizer. Made twice this w/e for 2 different groups. Empty plates both times.

Incredible. The best bruschetta I've had!

Very tasty, not as exceptional as the reviews, but very good. Roasted tomatoes are good for other dishes as well. I did make them without prosciutto as I had prosciutto in other dishes and needed a veggie option

was going to give this 3 forks because the prosciutto made it difficult to eat "gracefully" but then read that the recipe directed to cut the prosciutto crosswise - my hubby obviously missed this!!! Fantastic - will be cooking this again and again

Excellent,beautiful appetizer. I grilled the bread on my griddle to give it some char marks which really added to the flavor.

Excellent recipe. The baby arugula might seem like an extra hassle not worth the trouble, but it really takes it from a good tasting appetizer to an impressive display with a complex taste and texture.

Delicious! easy to make and looks great!

This was a hit. Was even asked for the recipe by a couple people. Will be making it again. This time for a holiday party. The greens on top of the tomatoes fit the color scheme perfectly...plus it was just so tasty. It doesn't sit the best. The bread will get a bit soggy after awhile.

This dish is AMAZING! I thought it would be a nice dish, but was surprised at how great it was. The flavors complement each other perfectly, especially the lemon in the greens. I was a little concerned about the texture of the tomato but it turned out perfect. This is my go to recipe from now on.

If you want to impress guests at a dinner party, I highly advise making this appetizer. Not only do the crostinis taste delicious, but they also look it. Photos on my blog: http://sweetcarolinescooking.wordpress.com/2010 /08/15/jumping-for-julia/

This was so delicious it got me thinking...I bought some Nan and used this instead of the small toasts to make a little pizza--this way I could eat more in one sitting:)

SIMPLY YUMMY!!!! RAVE REVIEWS FROM THOSE LUCKY TO GET ONE!!!! DIDN'T CHANGE A THING!!!

This was delicious - I forgot the last step with the lemon, and think that would have made a nice touch. Note, though, that the bread gets a bit soft from the ricotta after a while - still tasted great, but preferred it when the bread was crunchy.

I made these for a friend who loves Italian food, and she is quite a gourmet. My family, and my friend, all LOVED this recipe. My daughter is vegetarian, but she ate the bruschetta without the prosciutto and still loved it. A definite keeper

Used julienned basil instead of arugula, and my only available rosemary was dried. Still a great flavor combo. Nice surprise all around, especially for a spur of the moment choice.

super! ricotta such a nice touch. would recommend a little more garlic and less roasting time for tomatoes.

WHOA! this is amazing. I marinate the tomatoes longer for convenience. Used arugula because that's what we had. So easy and delicious! A bit messy to eat with the arugula stacked high. I had this for lunch and dinner both today :) Have made this twice and am keeping this is the recipe box.

This belongs in your recipe box. The dish was easy and bold with flavor. I used fresh bread from the bakery or super market with seasoning in it already. The one I used had garlic and parmesan. When it came to making the oil mixture I only used the salt, pepper and garlic. Pay close attention to the oven when it comes to your tomatoes and bread - times vary. If I used to recommended time I would have burnt both. Also, I used sweet cherry tomatoes that I cut in half - one for each piece of bread (dependant on size of course). Worked perfectly!

This recipe is so damn good that you shouldn't have to change a thing to it. I followed it to the letter using arugula versus the microgreens. It was sensational.. the saltiness of the prosciutto, the creaminess of the ricotta.. tangy arugula with lemon.. and the fragrance of the rosemary.. it was all so perfect. 5 forks if I could!!

Delish .... I made an extra batch of tomatoes and tossed them with pasta ... also delish.

Made the recipe exactly as written and every single ingredient added its own flavor dynamic to the mix. Very good and fresh tasting. I would increase the garlic on the toast next time and add fresh basil to the salad for a little extra kick in seasoning. The tomatoes were cooked very fast - the recipe cook time is def. too long.

Though this isn't the most straightforward of Bruschetta recipes, it was definitely well worth it. All the components worked perfectly together....like having that perfect bite! This definitely my new go to recipe for bruschetta.

Rating: 4
Did not have the prosciutto at hand and did tomatoes on the grill instead of roasting them. Still, it was an absolute hit with my whole family. I think the "sweet saltiness" of ricotta makes this bruschetta taste really amazing. I can only imagine how divine it must taste with prosciutto. Will definitely make it again. Easy and super yummy!

Delish!! Crowd pleaser for sure! I pulled the tomotoes out at about 18 min and they were done...so don't over cook!

Easy and excellent. Made this with roasted garden tomatoes. The arugula was a great addition and added color,too.

I haven't really met a tomato bruschetta I didn't like and this was no exception. We liked arugula as a topping. One note, the second time I made this the tomatoes sat out and got cold. I found I like the tomatoes when they're tepid not cold.

Really excellent. We substituted mozzarella for the ricotta, and added a dusting of parm to the bread before putting it in the oven.

This was a great and tasty dish. Highly recommend. Some were made without prosciutto to be vegetarian-friendly, and those were just as good.
