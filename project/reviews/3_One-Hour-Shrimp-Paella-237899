This is a great weekend night meal. Like others, I used andouille sausage instead of ham. I also used smoked paprika and double the amount in the recipe. It's easy and tasty and as others have noted you can easily add your favorite ingredients.

The recipe is decent, but a few things are off, so I made some adjustments per the insightful and helpful comments listed here. The rice definitely needs to cook for longer than the recipe says it does -- probably twice as long. You also need more broth than the recipe asks for -- I'd say an additional cup. Additions I made: a splash of white wine as I added the shrimp. And a couple of minutes before I added the shrimp, I added frozen peas. As I added the shrimp and olives, I threw in some quartered canned artichoke hearts. I didn't have saffron, and while I know this is a cardinal sin, I replaced it with turmeric and it still turned out tasty.

Fine, but nothing particularly exciting. The flavors all blend together into a uniform savory taste, and the paella was fairly bland despite the fact that I used spicy chorizo instead of the ham. Also, it makes waaay more than 4 servings, so be prepared to be eating the leftovers for quite a while.

This was delicious. I used some lobster stock that I had in my freezer and fewer olives since I was afraid they would dominate the flavor. I also replaced the ham with spicy italian sausage since that is what I had on hand. I made a Paella once that took all day and this was almost as good.

I make this as a fusion of Spanish/Cajun Cuisine. I use Linguica and or Andouille sausage and shrimp

Great dish and easy to make. Instead of ham I used about 6 oz. chorizo, added muscles and added a green pepper. Als to save time I I just sliced the vegtables instead of dicing them up. This is a great recipe to start with and then to make additions and changes that suit you.

Hmm - Like many here I could not leave well enough alone! For me a paella includes a combination of things so to the shrimp I added chunks of seasoned and sauteed boneless chicken thighs and large pieces of garlic and herb chicken sausage. We don't eat pork in our house so I also used the smoked paprika which replaced that lost flavor from the smoked ham. I used the Arborio rice in favor of the medium grained white rice to get a creamy texture and was generous with the saffron. The result was a smash with the family so it's in the recipe box for a return engagement!

I noted that a lot of people added ingredients to make this more flavorful. I added garlic, peas, and tomatoes and it was still pretty bland. I didn't want to add meat, so I only used the shrimp. Maybe that's why there was no taste. I won't be making this again.

Wonderful and easy. I did a couple of small changes. Instead of ham, I used chorizo and doubled the amount of shrimp. It took no time to prepare and it was bursting with flavor. The leftovers were heavenly!

I make this fairly regularly with the following modifications: chicken andouille sausage instead of the ham, regular green olives instead of the pimento stuffed variety; add artichoke hearts, squid and scallops. Also, highly recommend using smoked paprika.

I decided to take a lot of suggestions and integrate them into this recipe. For example 1) added mussels, sliced mushrooms, diced tomatoes, turkey sausage, and peas; and 2) I could not find saffron threads and so I used saffron flavored rice. It turned out well with these additions, but in hindsight I would add more flavor. A dabble of Adobo worked well after the fact. I would season it more while cooking. I would also add more of the turkey and as large chunks vs dices to really taste it. A good base recipe that can be reworked into a winner with some tweaks.

We substituted the ham with chorizo and used vermicelli rather than rice. It really turned out great and cooked even faster because of the pasta.

I gussied this up quite a bit using wild boar andouille sausage and adding scallops. But the recipe was fast and easy to follow and seemed extremely flexible. I did need to season the season the seafood before adding it or it would have been too bland just steaming itself on top of all the other stuff. I used kalamata olives instead of green and it added nice color. As well as chopped cilantro and chives. All I had was sushi rice and it worked perfectly.

It was easy to make. I couldn't find Saffron at my grocery store. Next time I make this, I will definitely go out of my way to find that spice. My family doesn't like red peppers, or peppers of any kind other than jalapeno, so a lot of recipes, I have to alter - my photo isn't as colorful, but I think it turned out really well. Nice flavors.

Delicious recipe. I added scallops, clams and used lite polish kilbasa. I used Goya low sodium yello rice. Added garlic. Everyone loved it. We had Spanish wine and listened to Flamenco music while cooking and eating. I (almost) felt like I was in Madrid again!

This is a really nice little crowd-pleasing weeknight dinner. I made it as directed, with the addition of garlic (lots) and frozen peas, which I put in with the shrimp. Very tasty, very easy and I can't wait to mess around with it. One caveat: you really must be careful with the salt on this one. It can turn into a complete sodium bomb very quickly, depending on your ham and olives. I might not even risk the chicken broth; it'd probably be fine with just water and maybe a dab of tomato paste.

Made this tonight and it was great. I cut the recipe in half as I'm cooking for two; used 2 links of chorizo, 3 chicken thighs, 1 med. onion and 1 red pepper,& added a clove of garlic. The Arborio rice cooked to perfection and I took another reviewers suggestion and added 1/2 cup of white wine along with the shrimp, peas and olives. This is a keeper!

Great base to add on to. Used peas, cliantro, roasted peppers, garlic...turned out well. Previous comments are correct...rice cooking time is about double before the shrimp goes in.

I used smoked paprika and brown rice. I think the rice needs longer cooking before adding the shrimp. I was surprised that the ham and olives provided all the seasoning needed without adding salt. A great weeknight dinner!

Great recipe. Making it tonight for the 2nd time. Used saffron flavored rice (omitted the threads) and chorizo instead of ham. Threw in some scallops and clams for a great paella. Also use smoked paprika. Will definitely make again.

Delicious! As I don't eat pork I left out the ham. I also used vegetarian and seafood stock instead of chicken, and finished with white wine per another reviewer's suggestion. If you get bland results you probably aren't using a quality paprika! Also try adding more paprika than called for and adding minced garlic.

Rating: 2
Glad I read other reviews before I made; I had some andouille sausage on hand, so used 2 links(cut recipe in half as there are only 2 of us) and added 4 large cloves of garlic after I browned the onions and peppers a bit. Used arborio rice but found cooking time to be longer than 15 min before I was ready to add shrimp & olives. Used hot Hungarian paprika, but needed a little more spice for our taste, so added a bit of cayenne and put tabasco on table, but it didn't need much more than a drop or two. Added a tablespoon of Sherry vinegar just before serving with green salad also dressed with sherry vinegar and walnut oil and lite sprinkle of feta. Not sure I'd make again but it was a nice break from the usual.

Just returned from Spain and wanted to try something new. This was delicious. I altered the recipe by using chorizo instead of ham, added some scallops and peas. The hardest part was getting all the ingredients. Served to dinner guests and they really liked it. Did the first step about one hour ahead and then drained off much of the grease from the chorizo. Was able to finish the dish without much fuss while entertaining. Highly recommend this dish.

Nice and easy to make. I used pre-seasond saffron rice, skipped the ham and olives and added frozen peas and lima beans. If you don't like a fishy taste, try cooking the shrimp (and maybe some scallops) in a separate pan and then adding. I will definitely make this again, but doubt I would serve it to guests.

This recipe has become one of our favorites, as it is not only delicous, but quick and easy. My only variations are to substitute chorizo sausage for the ham to give it a little kick and then I finish it with white wine instead of the quarter cup broth called for at the end of the recipe.

Quick, healthy, and tasty for the work week. Make sure to be generous with the seasoning for added flavour. Will be having this again.

Great weeknight dinner...very easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly. I'm not sure about the very different results that I read in the reviews here, but I'm going to take a guess that it might be the kind of paprika used. If you use regular old sweet paprika you probably would have a pretty bland dish & the olives are key because they are the only source of salt. Just a thought. Anyway, we really enjoyed this & I'll be adding this to my work week dinner rotation.

I thought that this recipe was fast, easy, and incredibly tasty. Sure, it's not *real* paella, but it's real enough to taste great on a Tuesday night when one doesn't have hours to make dinner! Good flavors, especially with the olives.

made this yesterday as I had some rather tasteless cooked frozen shrimp to use up. Used regular long grain rice, regular onion and spring onion, left over honey baked ham from Christmas that was in the freezer, only had sweet paprika so added some cayenne, salt and pepper. It turned out well and was a good diaguise for the not so tasty shrimp. Will make it again.

I had high hopes this would be a new dish for my rotation but it was only fair - good. Needs a kick. There are better paella recipes out there and I will try something different next time.

Not very good. Did not a lot of flavor. Should have seen that coming given that there was no mention of salt or pepper in the recipe. There are much better paella recipes out there that are just as easy as this one.

My husband loved this so much he asked to have it put in the regular rotation. Not sure why people say this isn't a real paella; there are so many different versions of paella and the only thing in common is the rice, the saffron, and the paella pan. OK, so this isn't the traditional Valencian with snails and lima beans - it kind of says that in the name, doesn't it? I also don't understand why people say this doesn't have any flavor unless they are skimping on the quality or quantity of ingredients. This paella isn't supposed to be spicy, but with quality ingredients cooked properly the flavor is wonderful and satisfying. Take the time to make your soffrito properly to develop the flavor, and use the traditional arborio or a good medium grain rice. Use a wide shallow pan (NOT non- stick which will produce a bland flavor). If cooked properly this dish should not resemble risotto. If you want, take a few extra minutes to make the crispy socorrat. Yum!

Granted it's not real paella but it's quick and tasty. I used chorizo instead of the ham which gave it a little kick and put hot sauce on the table. For a fast, middle-of-the-week meal I think it's a keeper.

Loved the recipe, used andouille sausage instead of smoked ham and this gave it the kick it needed. Also left out the olives completely. My husband and kids loved it. Will definitely make it again, easy recipe to change up with different ingredients.

Garlic, red pepper flakes, lots of dried herbs, more saffron, more parika. Sprinkle with fresh parsley and green onions. Don't use arborio, it's not risotto. Then it's very tasty. Very easy to make, great for a weeknight.

I made this last night and while I wouldn't call it a paella exactly, it was pretty tasty nonetheless. I added a little more paprika and saffron than the recipe suggested, plus I salted and peppered both the rice and the shrimp. I also threw in some capers for a little tang. Did anyone else notice that the picture looks like it has herbs but the recipe doesn't? Looks like parsley or basil.

This dish was just okay. It was easy to make, but I agree with the previous reviewer that it was pretty tasteless and ended up more like a risotto. Most of the other cooks added other ingredients to spice it up, and I will too if I decide to make it again.

Delicious recipe, but I did add a few flavorful ingredients, including some garlic and diced mushrooms. I also put a dash of old bay, giving it a somewhat southern feel.

I liked the consistency of the dish, but it was tasteless. I wouldn't make this again.It might work better as a risotto than a paella if you left out the olives and added mushrooms and peas.

I found this recipe to be quite good and rather quick and easy to make on a weeknight. To the existing recipe, I added garlic and 1/4 lb of sauteed chorizo to the other ingredients. In the future I may add scallops along with the shrimp and maybe sliced calamari. Or, for another quick and easy switch, I would buy a a ready-cooked rotisserie chicken from the grocery store and just take some of the chicken meat off the bone and add it along with the shrimp. Having been in Spain and tasted the various regional variations of paella, I stuck with the Arborio rice to retain much of the authenticity. This is a definite keeper and probably come out a little different each time I make it.

Very good recipe. My DH would have rated it four forks but I thought it needed a little more of a kick. Maybe a bit more seasoning, but very good nonetheless.

I made this for a dinner party and the flavor with the olives was great. I added grilled chicken legs & thighs and used smoked sausage (grilled) instead of the ham and flash grilled the shrimp I also added chopped tomatoes and garlic. I've made other paella recipes and like it better with long grain rice which is not as sticky.

I thought this was amazingly easy and very tastey. I used smoked chicken (which was perfect)instead of ham and put in too many olives (since I love green olives). The aborio rice even resembled risotto w/o the stirring. Next time I will use the recommended amount of olives.

I was amazed at how good this recipe was! I was a bit skeptical, since the ingredients were so few and it's so healthy-looking. It looked too good to be true, but lo and behold, it was delicious! Since it contains ingredients I always have on hand AND is actually GOOD for me (unlike most things that taste so good), this will become a regular weeknight dish for me.
