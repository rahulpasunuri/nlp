I took this to about 3.5 hours total time. 1 hour prep and 2.5 hours in the oven at 300F. I adjusted the recipe for 4. I substituted port for the red wine and added celery to give the sauce a clean savory flavor. The results were wonderful To find out how, see my notes in the recipe box. I will try to attach a photo.

OK, so we finally ate this last night and it was VERY nice. I would make it again though I would modify the recipe quite a bit. In the end I added 3 tbsp of tomato paste, 2 tbsp each of basil and thyme, some salt and lots of pepper, and new veg (after I strained out the sauce vegs) to make it a stew: pearl onions, fingerling potatoes, carrot, celery, parsnips, turnips and celeriac. The meat was perfect: tender, juicy and full of flavor. Though I removed the bones and cut out the obvious fat, it still retained enough fat to give it that great mouth feel. I'm going to rewrite it though, I'm still mad that it was so poorly written in the 1st place.

This may be very tasty but I don't think it will be worth the effort. VERY poorly written directions -- make sure you read the whole thing carefully before proceeding; I missed the part about reducing the marinade which actually takes like 2 hours, so the whole process of cooking is like 5-6 hours without the marinading time. Couldn't finish it in one day so I have yet to taste it.

While this had a good taste, it was too many steps and the directions were unclear. By discarding the "solids", a major portion of the wonderful vegetable are thrown out. This took many hours to make and I know there are other recipes that take much less time and produce just the same flavors. Also, the sauce, when reduced, is too thin to support the body of the meat.

This was amazing! To cut down on the work and clean-up, we only used 1 pot for the whole process. We seared our meat in a deep and wide dutch oven, set the meat aside, and sauteed our veggies in it, added the liquid and reduced it, then added the meat back in. The only thing we changed was we used dried, reconstituted oyster mushrooms instead of fresh, because we didn't have any fresh on hand. We added the mushroom liquid in with the stock to boost the flavor, and it was great! Lastly, we prepped all our veg. etc, the day before (when we made the marinade) which made the cooking on the following day a bit less onerous.

Exceptionally flavorful. Prep and clean-up can be simplified by using the large flat skillet both to brown the ribs and to braise them in the oven. Run the cooked vegetables through the blender until smooth, pour on bottom of a serving plate and place ribs on top, garnished with parsley.

Ok, it is a bit dubious for me to write a review because I greatly tweaked this recipe for my purposes. I used all the ingredients (except I used pork ribs instead of beef), but I didn't measure anything. I also streamlined it for ease...sauteed the onion and rubbed the meat with the spice mixture and then threw everything in the pan in the oven for a few hours. The flavor combination was delicious!

I didn't cook this myself, but a friend cooked it for me. It was indeed delicious, but quite a bit of trouble. I'd make it myself on a cold winter's day.

I made this for New Years eve, it was delicious. But it takes a LONG time to make, read carefully. And my husband complained that I didn't serve potatoes. I served noodles. Too much work to hear complaints. So if you are married to a complete jerk, don't bother with this recipe. Happy New Year!
