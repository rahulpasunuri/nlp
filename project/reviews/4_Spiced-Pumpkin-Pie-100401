I forgot to note that I used creme Fraiche instead of whipping cream and I made my brown sugar from scratch (sugar + molasses). I also used 4 eggs instead of 3 as suggested in other reviews - I found the extra egg and creme Fraiche really set the pie filling well, everything I was looking for in a pumpkin pie!

I made this recipe with fresh homemade pumpkin and I doubled the spices as other reviewers suggested and it was a hit. Delicious! This will be my go to pumpkin pie recipe!

Perfect pumpkin pie! Just the recipe I've been searching for for years. I follow Mary's daughters "original" recipe from comments, except that I stick with the BA version 1C of cream instead of 1.5 c of milk. Also, I make my own crust a day or so ahead and put it in the freezer, making it super easy to pull together. Then brush some egg white on crust bottom before pouring in pumpkin mixture and dust the crust edge with cinnamon and sugar, ala Bake Sale Betty's. Yum, yum!

Everyone -- but everyone -- loved this pie, including my brother-in-law who hates pumpkin pie. I doubled the spices as suggested by others and made my own pumpkin puree in the food processor. Perfectly delicious.

This is a beautiful dark, rich pumpkin pie. The molasses was not overwhelming and in fact next time I will decrease the sugar and add more molasses. I doubled the spices as well.

This was my very first time baking pumpkin pie and it was great! I didn't have light molasses so I used 1 tbs. of dark. I also didn't have any allspice so I used cardamom. It seems to be a recipe that you can tinker with to suite your tastes. Next time I will definitely lose the white sugar and add an egg. Also doubling the spices is a must!

I've been searching for the ultimate pumpkin pie recipe and I think this is it! I make two small changes - I use an entire 28 oz can of pumpkin, and I didn't have light molasses on hand when I first made this and substituted dark. Now I wouldn't change it since the results have been so great. i've had good success with Pillsbury refrig. pie dough so I cheat there - I've tried homemade in the past and that's one thing that hasn't seemed to pay off. But perhaps I'm not a great crust-maker.

great pie - I didn't add a fourth egg and it came out great and very creamy. I did double the spices and add nutmeg, since I didn't have light brown sugar or molasses I used the rule that 1 cup molasses = 1 cup white sugar = 1 cup maple = 3/4 cup brown sugar, and used brown sugar and maple mix. came out delicious, and even better the following day!

Rating: 4
This is a lovely pie. I spiced it as written and didn't add any extra ingredients. I did omit the white sugar, but I never use the full amount of sugar in any recipe. And because I only had dark brown sugar, I omitted the molasses. The majority of the reviews make it sound like you absolutely must double the spices, but I'm glad I didn't. I made it with the Sweet Pastry Dough, and it was wonderful. Can't wait to make it again!

I've made this pie two years in a row and we think it's absolutely fantastic. I'm talking about the highest reviews, including from pie makers who know what they are doing on there own. It will be my go-to pumpkin pie from now on. A few notes for your review if you are going to make it. First, we doubled the spices except the salt and added a quarter to half a tsp. of fresh nutmeg, and I definitely recommend doubling the spices - the result will not be too spicy even for the somewhat spice-adverse. Second, my experiences indicate that adding a fourth egg is definitely a good idea. It sets better, and even with 4 extra large eggs, mine did not come out too custardy or eggy at all. Third, I use those standard clear Pyrex pie plates - I think they are about 9.25 inches, and this recipe filled it up 100 per cent. In fact, if my crust did not go a quarter of an inch over the sides of the pan all the way around, all the filling would not have fit. I mention this so that if you are using an 8 inch pie pan it will be a big issue, and in any case, if you are using a standard Pyrex pan like mine, when filling the pie you may wish to put the empty crust on the oven rack and pour the filling in there, where it's easier to fill it to the tippy top without having to carry the pie to the oven and thus spill some of the filling. Finally, and I'm purely editorializing here, I'd splurge for roasting some real pumpkin for this pie - it's worth it. And we find that whip cream with a little vanilla and sugar added is a perfect accompaniment for this pie.

Rating: 4
I didn't taste a bite of this pie. That was because it was devoured before I had a chance. There was buzz about the pie. This was at a party with copious amounts of food and most of it was left-over. So, I guess it was good! I did double the spices, made my own pie crust (worth the little extra effort) and provided whipped cream.

Rating: 4
This was delicious. I made a few modifications to this recipe, so I can't review it as written, but I would definitely make it again. I omitted the white sugar since we don't like overly sweet desserts. 2/3 brown sugar was plenty sweet. I doubled the spices as others have suggested, replacing the allspice with nutmeg since that's what I had. I used 1 T dark molasses instead of 2T light. And four eggs, as others have suggested. I actually made 2 versions, both with homemade crusts. One version, I baked in a completely frozen, raw crust. It tasted wonderful but the bottom of the crust was a little soggy and undercooked. The second version, I used a homemade crust which I parbaked at 350 for 20 minutes. Then, I added the filling to the parbaked crust and continued with the recipe as written (10 minutes at 450, 40 at 325). I had to cover the crust edges with foil to keep them from burning, but the bottom of the crust was flaky and browned. This is the version I will follow if I make the pie again.

I've been making this pumpkin pie recipe every Thanksgiving since clipping it from my 1998 Bon Appetit. I recommend preparing it exactly as stated in the recipe for a robust pumpkin pie. Definitely garnish with the chopped walnuts and serve with whipped cream. Everybody loves it.

This had a very good taste and texture and close to my memory of family thanksgivings in the US. My only change was using real pumpkin (hard to find in Australia), quartered and seeded, steamed in the microwave and then peeled, (much easier that way around.) I have already made it several times with spiced whipped cream.

Mary is my mother and the Pumkin Pie receipe she sent to Bon Appeit has been baked and eaten by 3 generations of Dillmans and now we are on our 4th generation. We make it each year at Thanksgiving and Christmas. Below is the real "Pennsylvania Pumpkin Pie" receipe that 3 generaltions of Dillmans make. 1 1/2 cups of pumkin (do not use pumpikin pie mix) I use the whole smaller can; 2 eggs; 2 TBS; 1/2 tsp salt; 2 TBS dark molasses; 2/3 cup dark brown sugar; 1/2 cup granulated sugar; 1/2 tsp cinnamon; 1/8 all spice; 1/8 tsp cloves; 1/8 tsp ginger; 1 1/2 cups milk (not condensed); Mix pumpkin and next 6 ingredients Stir in spices ; Add Milk; Pour mixture into one 10 inch crust (unbaked) or 2 8 inch crusts; Bake at 450 degree oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 325 degree and bake for 1 1/2 hours. The pie should separte from the crust it does not need the walnuts. Whip Cream is optional.

Love this recipe with a few modifications: I added an extra egg, dark molasses, and doubled the spices as previous users suggested. But we like a real spicy pie, and I added 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg as well. Additionally I left out the white sugar and just used the brown sugar. I used fresh pumpkin puree, and crust from scratch. This next modification might not be for everyone, but instead of the whipping cream, I used almond milk. I wanted to make it a bit healthier. We could scarcely taste the difference, and it cuts out all that fat. I suppose I changed it quite a bit, but I'm sure that as-is the recipe is also delicious. This has become my default pumpkin pie recipe. 4 forks!

I made this for Thanksgiving determined to make a pumpkin pie my husband likes. I added the extra egg like others posted. Also, I used pumpkin pie spice but forgot to double it. My husband's only complaint was that it needed more spices so I'm thinking doubling the spices as others have suggested would make this pie perfect!!

I am not going to rate this because I changed it. After reading others' recommendations, I added an extra egg, doubled the spices, and cut down on the sugar. In fact, I used only 3/4 cup of light brown sugar and no white sugar. Having made those changes, I would give it four forks. It came out great!

I spent a lot of time reading Pumpkin Pie recipes and settled on this one. As everyone suggested, I upped the spices, and reduced the sugar by half. I only had dark molasses, so I used about half. It was ok, not great or outstanding. I did not care for the molasses flavor, but that could be because I used the dark. If I repeat it I will go with the light molasses.

Rating: 4
Great recipe, but be careful about the sugar. I used a pumpkin that was naturally very sweet and barely needed 1/2 cup of brown let alone the white or the molasses. It just goes to show that it always helps to taste the filling as you add the sugar and other spices, then adjust. Still I'd give it 4 forks!

When I ate a slice of this pie, I died, went to heaven, flew over cloud nine, and came back again just to say that this is the most amazing pumpkin pie I've ever tasted. My husband is also a pumpkin pie fanatic. Some might call him picky about his pies, but he declared this to be the best pumpkin pie recipe in the world. I have to say that I used a Winter Luxury pie pumpkin from the farmer's market instead of canned pumpkin and I think that really made a difference. The recipe itself makes a pie with a delicious warm, spiced flavor, but the Winter Luxury gave it a creaminess and full pumpkin flavor. I used 1 3/4 C pumpkin because I wanted to use what I had left, added the extra egg since everyone recommended it, and roughly doubled the spices and the pie turned out very well. I had to bake it for an extra 20-30 minutes, but it didn't burn or appear to adversely affect the flavor. This is now our family pumpkin pie recipe. I'm making two to take to my in-laws for Thanksgiving!

A delicious, flavorful pie. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and doubled the spices (I don't use allspice, but nutmeg and mace instead) and used four eggs. I also used dark molasses because it's what I had on hand and I really love the flavor. My only complaint is that the pie was a tad sweeter than I might have liked. Very, very lightly sweetened whipped cream helped a lot, though. Next time I think I will do away with the white sugar.

My husband, a pumpkin pie expert, would buy the pies off the Whole Foods in DC because he said their pumpkin pies were among the best he's tasted (tho he said something was different about them last year). I tried another Epicurious pumpkin pie last year (the one with the spiced whip cream), and he thought it was good but it still wasn't as good as Whole Food'sthe spiced whip cream was a winner, however! I tried this one last night, and he's in love (with the pie). I used 1 tbsp regular molasses, an extra 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, Trade Joe's Pumpkin Pie Spice instead of allspice and I doubled the amount called for in the recipe. I realized too late that I didn't have cloves and ginger so that's another reason why I put in extra amounts of the other spices. I debated putting in the extra egg as suggested by others, and I ended up leaving it out. It took about 75 minutes on 325 to set but it did set wonderfully. My whipping cream was more like heavy cream, I would say...I'm in Turkey so things are different here (and that's too long of another story to explain how I got to heavy cream).

This is the best pumpkin pie ever. Definitely add a fourth egg. Add a little extra spices and I did 3/4 tbsp molasses and 1 1/4 tbsp maple syrup because I ran out of molasses and it turned out great. I also used Martha Stewarts recipe for pate brisse pie crust. I baked the crust at 425 F for 15 mins then added the filling and baked for about 75 minutes or so at 325 F.

made double of the recipe for two pies with homemade fresh crust for thanksgiving. Doubled the amount of spice for each except the allspice and added the additional egg as previously suggested.

"Fantastic" is what my family thought. I used the molasses but only 3/4 T and substituted maple syrup for the rest (I could only find dark molasses and didn't want to overwhelm the pie with the flavor). Used a store bought crust, which I won't do again. Homemade is always better. This is now my go-to pumpkin pie! Texture and flavor were fantastic.

This is the best pumpkin pie my husband and I have ever had. As suggested by other reviewers: I added an egg, doubled the spice, substituted 2T molasses with 1/2 T of molasses and 1 1/2 T maple syrup, and put my own crust in a pie plate and froze it. I used Trader Joe's Organic Pumpkin and Chinese Ginger. It is absolutely delicious!

I usually make my standard pumpkin peacan cheesecake, but this year thought I would try this-excellent but with a few changes. I used an extra egg as people suggested, seperated the eggs and mixed the yolks with the sugar pumpikn, spices etc. Whipped the cream and then beat the egg whites-which btw gave more volume and I ended up having extra-folded those in. Doubled up the crust in a spring form pan and brushed it with sugar and Cointreau, topped the pie with pan roasted pecans and after baking and cooled, removed from pan, and brushed the ouside of the crust and pecans with sugar/Cointreau mixture. It was incredible-people were having seconds. This is now my new standard pumpkin pie.

I followed everyone's advice about adding an extra egg and doubling the spices. Just right!

I think this is one of the best pumpkin pie recipes I have ever eaten. I used a whole can of pumpkin and increased all other ingredients accordingly so that I could get 2 pies, and it was perfect. I only had dark molasses, but I think it couldn't have been better! For Thanksgiving, I am going to try the "Maple Pumpkin Pie" from this site, also 4 forks, with the "Best-EverPie Crust", then decide which of these 2 I prefer.

This pie was surprisingly good even though I had a few substitutions! As previously recommended, I doubled the spices, added an egg and used a deep dish pie crust. I was out of allspice so used Chinese 5 Spice. I had a leftover white pumpkin, so I baked it and used the puree. I used half & half instead of whipping cream, and added a splash of brandy. It still turned out smooth and very pretty. Toasted pecans are a good garnish.

I have made this pie twice- the cooking time has been longer than indicated. My pies were no where near done. Don't think it is a problem with my oven since other items bake perfectly in expected time. I would recommend going easy on molasses since it can overpower the pie. Otherwise, very tasty.

This pie is out of this world! I only had dark molasses, but the results were sublime. I wanted to use 2 Pillsbury refrigerated crusts to save time, so I used a whole can of Libby's pumpkin and then increased the rest of the ingredients 25% accordingly, i.e. 4 eggs. It made for 2 perfect pies with wonderful flavor, smooth texture and stability. You will not be disappointed!

I reviewed this pie last year after I got 1st place at the Kentucky State fair with it. I made it again this year but with sweet potatoes and got 1st place again! This time, I mixed the custard in the blender, per a suggestion I had read elsewhere. It made for a lovely smooth texture.

Per prior reviewers, I doubled the spices and added an egg. The flavor and texture were great, definitely my new favorite pumpkin pie recipe. Only problem I had was that there was far too much filling for my purchased 9" pie crust, so ended up dividing the filling between two 9" crusts. Next time I'll be sure to buy deep-dish pie crusts or will make my own.

Doubled spices and added the extra egg, per other reviewers' suggestions. Great texture and good flavor. Substituted a darker molasses as that's what I had on hand, and even though I cut the amount in half, the pie still had quite a prominent molasses flavor, which wasn't bad a bit overpowering. Will definitely make sure I have the milder variety next time.

I also added 1/4 tsp of vanilla & a little grated nutmeg. Perhaps because of the extra egg & since I used a whole 15 oz. can of pumpkin, this made a lot more than just one pie's worth of filling.

just checking in after Thanksgiving to say what a hit this pie was. Another first time pumpkin pie baker here but it went off without a hitch. Followed some recomendations and doubled the spices, added an extra egg, and did a egg glaze onto the crust before filling to avoid any sogginess. This recipie does make much more than will fill a regular 9" pie crust so I made a few small soufle dishes for us to sample that evening - which were delicious on their own. Next time I might try 1 to 1+1/2 of the recipie and filling 2 crusts as this pie goes quickly. Or use a deep dish crust. It will be on the table at Christmas this year as well. Thanks

Truly delicious pie. Thanks for the tip of doubling the spices, which I did. However, my pie took a full 45 mins more to cook than the time listed. No one else mentioned this so I can't imagine what was wrong. I baked a pie before this and a turkey after, both of which timed perfectly, so it's not my oven. Shrug. Oh well, it was delicious.

Excellent recipe, if you're going to have trouble it's in over/under beating the filling. I omitted the flour and stiffened the filling and cooked the pies at 335 until they were done vs. starting at 400 for 10 minutes. I also used scratch crust - which turned out great. Absolutely double the spices - and add a bit of mace to jazz it up.

I usually use store-bought pre-made Graham Cracker crust, which is GREAT with this! And, SO EASY! More importantly, I doubled the spices (not salt!) and this became "my" dessert specialty! I can't imagine a better pumpkin pie. Also, I don't use the baking sheet (so careful not to overfill!) and I cook at 325 for 55-ish minutes. HEAVEN.

I made this pie for a local baking contest and placed third with it. It's great recipe, but I made a change; I doubled the pumpkin puree amount as I used fresh roasted sweet pumpkin. Here's a look at it on my blog: http://tallcloverfarm.com/? p=156#more-156

Okay, so I did an experiment. I made this pie and Pumpkin Pie With Spiced Whipped Cream (Bon Appetit/ November 2003) because they both had good reviews and because I wanted to contrast using sweetened condensed milk with using whip cream and sugar. I also wanted to try using real pumpkin; in this recipe I used 2 cups of blended, steamed pumpkin because it seemed a bit more watery than what the recipe suggests. The spices were increased a bit, and I used one tablespoon of molasses. This was hands down, the best pumpkin pie I have ever had. It was rich, creamy, light and bursting with spice and sweetness. Just downright delicious. I had this one second and it was clear that I would bring the other one to work, keeping the miracle pumpkin pie home with me. Then again I love people telling me they love my food. Maybe I'll take half of each. I know my pumpkin pie, and this is one of the best. Make it.

This recipe is a smashing success not only for the easy ingredients and everyone's prior comments, but also for the unique way to make the pie using frozen pie crust shells without prebaking. I used 1 can of Trader Joe's organic pumpkin, doubled the spices like the many before me, and I added the extra large egg. Be certain to have the eggs at room temperature, and it's OK to give them a little bit of whisk treatment to aerate the eggs just a little bit. I didn't use the molasses, nor did I add maple syrup; first time around I just forgot. The result was so great, I realized it didn't need that extra sugar. The filling made enough for 2 pies, both baked on a really well preheated commercial half sheet with foil cutouts that I placed over the crusts when I turned the oven to 325. I've made this twice, with four pies to show for it. Each time the result was met with raves. Everyone liked the additional spice, too. I'm amazed that even I like the pie! I generally can't stand pumpkin pie, and this is one that I enjoy in small slices. But for the changes above, don't tinker further with the recipe. It's fantastic.

I chanced upon this recipe while looking for a quick way to use up a frozen pie crust and a can of pumpkin, and I'm glad I did! Delicious, this is my new pumpkin pie recipe. Made it almost exactly as written, except it might have had a smidge more pumpkin (I used the whole can, which is more like 1 3/4 cups pumpkin). I used approx. the amount of spices called for (I always grind them fresh, so throw about the right amt in the grinder, but didn't double-check post-grinding) I didn't think it had too much molasses or too little spice, so I'm glad I made it before reading the reviews. The recipe made a bit too much filling for my crust, so we just had some pumpkin custard on the side to nibble while the pie was cooling :)

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. My first time making pumpkin pie - I was surprised at how EASY it was! I doubled on the ginger and allspice, but I didn't have any ground clove. I used Betty Crocker pie crust mix (powder - just add water). used the whole box and made leaf shapes with the extra dough. placed them on top after the pie was done and everyone was impressed with how festive and professional it looked! Now I will never go back to purchased pumpkin pie - this is a new staple for the holiday.

More like a molasses/spice pie (after you double the spices and add an egg as suggested) instead of pumpkin pie which is probably why people (including me) like it better than pumpkin pie. That said, this is probably my last attempt at a pumpkin pie since I still prefer pecan pie...

This has the beginnings of a good recipe, great spice combination; however, I found it far too timid. Using 1/2 teaspoon of the last three spices and 1 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon gave the pie a wonderful taste. I also added just under 1/2 a teaspoon of 5 spice. I cut the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and dropped the molasses and was left with a pie that accented the spice without being overwhelmingly sweet.

Delicious and easy to make. I don't have cloves but had pumpkin pie spice on hand. Used 2 tsps of it and suggestions of other reviewer: substitute molasses with maple syrup and rum and 4 eggs. Well received. Will make it again.

Yum! I made all of the changes suggested by previous reviewers -- double the spices, add an extra egg and decrease the molasses to 1 tbsp. It was delicious and very simple.

Just 2 words to describe this pie - easy, delicious!! Like other reviewers,I also used 4 eggs, but kept the spices true to the original recipe. I don't like things too sickly sweet, so I also reduced the white sugar to 1/4 cup. I live in England and molasses is hard to come by (checked 2 places), so i used golden syrup (a very mild flavoured, extremely sticky, light-coloured syrup). The result was a very creamy, dense and perfectly spicy pumpkin pie, and incredibly quick and simple to prepare. Only disappointment...I used store-bought pastry, which was too crispy and not remotely flaky. Will make my own next time!

I made this pie and took the suggestions of others and added an extra egg and doubled the spices. It was pretty good but I think I would have liked it even "spicier" Today, I am making it again but will also use the spiced whipped cream that is from another recipe on this site.

I don't like pumpkin pie as a rule, but I have to make a few each year, because I always host Thanksgiving. Once I tried this recipe (with a HOMEMADE crust, of course), I found a pumpkin pie that I actually enjoyed eating as well as serving. The pumpkin pie fans in the family devour it with many compliments. This pie has become a holiday tradition at my house.

Delicious! I'm not usually a big fan of pumpkin pie, but this one was great. I made it for an office party and was told by many people that it was the best pumpkin pie they'd ever had. I fully agree with the suggestions to double the spices, use only one tablespoon of molasses, and add an additional egg. The texture was perfect. I also used a homemade crust and homemade whipped cream, which I think this pie deserves!

I have made this recipe before as written, but it does call for a few changes. The pie does not set up when made as directed. This time, I added an extra egg and doubled all of the spices. It came out perfect! Also just used one tablespoon of molasses. Rave reviews...definitely use 4 eggs! You will not need all of the filling.

I somehow managed to get my mother to try this and she *LOVED IT*. Which is kooky, cause my mom normally has a strong aversion to pumpkin. She even went back for seconds! What's more flattering than that? Though I will have to say I worked on the shoulders of giants - thanks to all the previous cooks out there for the wonderful suggestions! I wound up using the following ingredients and it came out beautifully (nothing overpowering any other flavor, which was a concern with the molasses): 2/3 cup (packed) golden brown sugar 1/2 cup sugar 2 tablespoons all purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger 1 1/2 cups canned solid pack pumpkin 1/2 tablespoon dark molasses 1/2 tablespoon maple syrup 4 large eggs 2/3 cup whipping cream 1 purchased frozen 9-inch pie crust or homemade crust* I also used a ceramic pie dish not glass (to avoid the sogginess someone mentioned earlier) and made my own pie crust that I baked for about 7 minutes before adding the filling and putting it all back in the oven.

Great with soy milk and make with a gluten free crust perfectly. Do recommend to be light with the molasses and heavier with the spices. Best if made the day before as it gets better and better!

i actually tripled the spices. sounds crazy, i know, but it worked. after adding the cream, the flavor really tones down. also cut back on the molassass to 1Tbsp. Turned out wonderfully. Nice, dark coloration as opposed to the usual bright neon orange.

Was trying to make up for a different pumpkin pie that I made for Thanksgiving that was awful (Ina Garten's Pumpkin Banana Mousse recipe) and this one did it! Rec'd rave reviews. I also doubled the spices, kept the sugars the same, added an extra egg, 1/4 tspn vanilla and left out the ground cloves (didn't have). Very easy and cooked up beautifully. Maybe this is a deep dish recipe? I also had enough filling for a second pie in a regular pie plate. This pie is sweet and spicier than others I've had and we like it this way. Delicious!

I was really skeptical about this recipe at first but it turned out delicious! Thanks to all those who suggested doubling the spices and adding an extra egg because I thought it tasted perfect and set beautifully. I didnt have molasses so I too used the maple syrup and now I couldnt imagine it any other way! Thanks!

Thanks to all the previous cooks who made changes to this recipe--the result was extraordinary! What a great pumpkin pie!! So, I doubled the spices, used only 2/3 cup (lite brown) sugar, only 2/3 cream, 1 TBS dark molasses(no lite found either), and baked in uncooked gingersnap crust.I'll try taking out the extra sugar from the crust next time(it seemed a little too sweet to me)IT WAS GREAT!!!!!

Used 1T of dark molasses (couldn't find light) and BEWARE- you can definitely taste the molasses. Next time I might use only 1/2T of molasses or subsitute something else. Other than that, the pie was delicious and very flavorful (I also doubled the spices). Received many, many, complements.

This got a great reception at Thanksgiving dinner. The one problem I had is that it made a little too much for a nine-inch pie crust, so I just poured in enough to fill the crust and discarded the rest. Like a lot of others here, I also doubled the spices. A definite winner.

Rating: 4
Made this, doubling the spices, using 4 eggs & 1 T. dark molasses as recommended. Used the gingersnap pecan crust (which I pre-baked before freezing, though will try without prebaking next time). Was delicious & special. My sister, who doesn't ordinarily care for pumpkin pie, declared it the best she'd ever had, and asked for extra to bring home!

I made this pie twice and it's become my favorite pumpkin pie. Doubling the spices is a must. I also tried this with soy milk b/c my daughter has dairy allergies & the taste and texture was still very good. I also skipped the molasses and used 1T maple syrup & was happy with the result.

To the cook in Tokyo--I don't think you'd have to pre-bake the crust for the chiffon pie if using it for this recipe. It's pre-baked for that recipe because that's ALL it's baked for that recipe. I think you could just make the crust, fill it, and then bake it. Let us know how it goes, or how it went if you made it already, please.

I tried four different recipes this year, including this one, Ultimate Pumpkin Pie, and Honey Pecan pumpkin pie all on this site. This one was some folks' favorite, though I thought the molasses competed a bit too much with the pumpkin. Spice level was good and strong. Next time I may try it with 1T of molasses or so. The Honey-Pecan (on this site) was my fave for strong spices and still prominent pumpkin taste. The Ultimate Pumpkin Pie was a beautiful orange color and the least spicy. The pumpkin was very prominent in it and the sour cream and preserves gave it a good flavor, but I wished it was spicier. Try the gingersnap-pecan crust that's part of the pumpkin chiffon pie recipe on this site-- very yummy.

In total agreement - the best pumpkin pie that I have ever tasted - EVER! - I can hardly believe that I made it. I'm going to try doubling the recipe tonight and hopefully that will be fine. Also, made the recipe basically as is, added only slightly more spice and it set up great!

I am a Canadian living in the UK and I made this receipe with a few changes for our Thanksgiving dinner to rave reviews from my husband and daughter.

This pie had a very nice flavor. It was very rich, due to the whipping cream and eggs. It doesn't say so in the recipe, but I think it makes more of an 8" than a 9" pie.

I also had to bake it at least an hour and it was still not totally set.

This recipe has become one of the few recipes that I make repreatedly. It becomes easier to make each time and it always receives rave reviews. I don't always stick to the exact spice measurements, which has never been a problem, and I usually use only half of the reccomended amount of molasses to cut down on the sweetness. It has a real all-American, old-fashioned feel to it. (Also, my aunt reccomends defrosting the store-bought crust, molding it into a nicer pie pan and then re-freezing it for a more homemade look.)

I made this for Thanksgiving last year, and it basically flew off of the table. This year, when I asked my husband what he wanted for me to make for dessert, he asked for this pumpkin pie.

One of the best pumpkin pies ever! It set beautifully, but I had trouble with the oven temp. I wouldn't recommend using a baking sheet underneath - after 40 min. my pie was still not set so I had to do something - raised the temp. and removed pan. I don't know what it's there for anyway! I don't know what "light molasses" is so I used normal, which I found to be a bit strong. I would reduce this to 1 tbsp. from now on. I also made my own crust. This pie has a wonderful deep brown color - very impressive looking, and tasting. My family really devoured this one!
