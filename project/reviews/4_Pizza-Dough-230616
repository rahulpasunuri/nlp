Good recipe for a crowd - everyone can make their own and it comes out nice and crispy. There may be better recipes out there but not as simple as this!

excellent dough. I swap out one cup of the flour for semolina - consistently good results.

The recipe is great but I did make a few changes. I used Bread Flour instead of all purpose flour and Garlic Salt instead of salt as substitutions. I also mixed a few onion flakes with the cornmeal (for dusting)for a little added flavor!Overall, my family really enjoyed it! Will make it again!

I've made this pizza countless times. Always a request by my wife for homemade pizza. We put left over dough in smaller pans and freeze. This recipe makes an abundance of dough--good for several pizzas. Also, I've used 1/4 to 1/3 substitution of wheat flour--tasted great. I've replaced regular salt with garlic salt for a more flavorful dough.

A great pizza dough for grilling. No problems with sticking, as most doughs usually do, with just a light coat of vegetable oil. Grill about 2 minutes on high heat on one side, top, and grill the other side on low for 5-6 minutes with grill closed.

Disappointing results. I think it was the large amount of flour that made it way too dense for my taste. I was looking for a nice light and chewy pizza dough and this wasn't it. I'll keep looking.

This was the first time I'd ever made pizza dough, and I was very pleased with the results. I used white whole wheat flour instead of all purpose. I halved the recipe and used it to make four calzones. Next time I'd make six or eight calzones with the same amount of dough. After I divided the dough I left it in the fridge overnight. The dough was very flavorful, but a little too salty. Overall very good.

Easy to make and delicious. I prepare the dough ahead of time and freeze after the first rising. Then I defrost and let rise again in the fridge.

I used Bread Flour, Any pizza dough should be made with more gluten than all purpose. I also added some onion powder and garlic powder, about 1.5 teaspoons of each to give the dough a little more flavor. certainly not necessary, but nice. I've read from a few different sources that leaving the dough in the refrigerator for 24 hours before use increases flavor due to extra fermentation, I believe this to be true. For cheese, I put a dusting of Parmesan, covered sparsely with Fontina, and topped with a feta crumble. I prefer Fontina or Cheddar over Mozz. because both cheeses have a nice, sharp flavor compared with Mozz.

This is an amazing recipe! It creates a moist dough that is both easy to work with and has a great flavour. I mixed it using my mixmaster with the dough hook and I'm glad I did as it was very moist. I also halved the recipe as I knew I wasn't making that large a pizza. It is my new base pizza dough recipe!!

This is such a nice dough to work with. It rolled out easily, even without refrigerating it. Even the kids could make small pizzas and the crust was just right! This is a keeper!

Very easy recipe for pizza dough. Makes tasty, chewy dough. You can also make the dough into focaccia bread by kneading 1/4 to 1/2 cup olive oil into the dough prior to the first rise, and topped with seasonings or vegetables prior to baking. I make this recipe 2 or 3 times per month. I recommend that you have a heavy-duty food processor or mixer. If your food processor is not up to the task, the recipe works just as well if you halve it.

This dough is an excellent base for making great crust. It just depends on how you use it to make the crust you prefer. Chilling it helps relax the gluten, but fresh dough makes a nice crust as well if you're pressed for time. Try this!

I used this as a base to make breadsticks. Overall, slightly too salty, but otherwise? fantastic. Also, there was no noticable difference between those that I made immediately and those that I made after the hour of refrigeration.

Great basic pizza dough recipe. I don't have a big food processor so I hand mixed the whole thing with no problems other than starting out very sticky.

SCRAP THIS RECIPE - HERE IS HOW TO MAKE PIZZA DOUGH Use a good recipe (possibly this one) HIGH GLUTEN FLOUR ONLY - and knead for 15 min in the mixer w/dough hook. High gluten flour (ordered online - even more protien than bread flour) works best. Let rise covered on counter 2 hours, THEN RISE 4-12 HOURS COVERED IN THE FRIDGE. THE BEST dough you will try - just like the pizza shops (secret tip)

I made pizza with this crust last night using half whole wheat, half bread flour, a bit of wheat gluten, and some flax meal. Rolled it out thin because it was for a pizza for two of us. It was BY FAR the best pizza I've ever had. I heated up a pizza stone and it baked to perfection in 6 minutes. I can't tell you how glad I am that I made the whole recipe and have 5 more crusts waiting to be used in the freezer! (just freeze before second rise). Enjoy.

this is the standard pizza recipe used by professional chefs. Very good,,,suggestion...add sprinkling of rosemary and oregano to the crust just before baking.

My husband and I have been searching for the "perfect" pizza dough ever since we had lunch at Pizzeria Uno a year ago. This summer, Bon Appetit arrived with this pizza dough recipe and with a mushroom pizza topping recipe. Anyway, made the dough (1/3) and baked it on our pizza stone. The good news is, we have found our pizza dough. The bad news is two fold: no more carryout pizza and I have to make it since my husband is afraid he will mess it up. Thanks for a GREAT recipe!
