This was basically the same Salsa Verde in Gourmet's August 2002 with Grilled New York Strip Steak. While I was preparing the salsa, it looked strange, and I was worried we wouldn't like it. To my amazement though, even my 13 year old daughter (who doesn't like steak) had seconds. I felt like we were eating at a restaurant. I am going to make it next time I have company.
