VERY tasty! I did make it once with Thyme-and it was fine. Watercress wasn't in season. But is great with the cress! Perfect for a shower, or anytime!

Elegant and lovely. Don't change a thing. Pay no attention to the kook from Albany. Thyme as a substitute for Watercress? Egads.

Oh for crying out loud - if watercress is overpowering to you, then you shouldn't make a recipe with watercress in the NAME! These are lovely and different. The flavours mingled beautifully and my guests loved these cocktail sandwiches. Will definitely do again and not change a thing!

I just hosted a bridal shower tea party and made these sandwiches along with several of the other suggestions made in the issue. The others were fine. The watercress made these sandwiches much too bitter (I like watercress, but it's overpowering). I'd substitute parsley or thyme or a combination instead.
