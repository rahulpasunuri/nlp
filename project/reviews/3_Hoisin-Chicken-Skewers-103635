This was an easy, quick and tasty dish. The only change I made was to add garlic to the marinade. I thought it was a nice dish for a quick midweek meal.

This was an excellent dish on the grill. I threaded chicken thighs on pre-soaked wooden skewers and everyone in the family (3 yrs - adult) couldn't get enough of them. Really delicious. Instead of fresh ginger, I used dried.

This recipe was very easy and very delicious. If my 6 year old son will try it and like it, it's a keeper.

I have made this dish 3 times during the holiday season. Each time with rave reviews. I marinated the chicken for 2 days before skewering. I made a wasabi mayo dip to go with (mayo, wasabi mixed into soysauce, and ginger). It got rave reviews. Picky eaters were happy

This recipe gets a thumbs up for it's taste, ease, and major potential to be so much more. It's a good recipe for a family with children. I'm keeping this on hand for an appetizer as well.

I made this dish and it turned out wonderful. I served this with steamed rice and added the seasame seed onto of the rice. This is another keeper.

Made for husband & me on weeknight. We both enjoyed this dish. I only had 1 chicken breast on hand so I added veggies (zucchini, cherry tomato, onion) to the skewers. Glaze was good on veggies. I used seasoned rice vinegar (since that's what we had on hand) and the recipe turned out just fine.

I was expecting sensational and it was just ok. Wasn't what I'd expected, but my husband loved it!

It could have been the hoisin sauce that I used, but I didn't like this at all. I thought the marinade was too sweet, and almost had a plum taste. As I said, it could have been that the hoisin wasn't very good, but I probably won't waste chicken to find out again.

I made these skewers in the oven not the barbeque. My family loved them and so did I. They were simple to make and very tasty. I now make them often.

The ingredients were easy to find, available anywhere. It was quick and easy to make and absolutely delicious!

I got distracted by my better half while the chicken was marinating, and it marinaded in the fridge for about two hours. It turned out great! I served it with the "spicy savoy slaw" found elsewhere on this site and added some fresh watermelon slices for a low-fat, but very satisfying weekday dinner.

This is a great recipe. Although not dramatic, it's a very flavorful dish, and incredibly easy. Will definitely be making this again.

Fast, easy and tasty, this was a meal that pleased the whole family. I let the chicken marinate for 2 hours and added mushrooms and onions to the skewers. Will experiment with other veggies next time. A great weeknite meal.

The flavors of the ingredients didn't come through in the final product. Perhaps it needed to be marinated longer. There are so many other recipes to try, I'll move on...

This recipe was fantastic. It was so quick, and it used ingredients that I usually have on hand. Neither my husband nor I felt that there was too much vinegar. We loved the sweet and tangy flavors. Will try it next time by leaving the boneless chicken breasts whole and not skewering them.

I made this using skinless, boneless chicken thighs, which worked very well and made the recipe a little cheaper. Although it's not very expensive to begin with, as long as you have all the ingredients. Served it with a tart Thai cucumber salad, which complemented the sweetness of the recipe very well.

Excellent! My family loved it, we did not find itto have too much vinegar. It is so easy and fast to prepare.

Not bad. Tad on the vinegary side. I didn't find it too salty, though, probably because the Hoisin i use isn't an overly salty one. I'd make it again, but will continue to search for other Hoisin Chicken recipes.

This was excellent. It is not a dramatic or amazing dish, but for a quick, healthful, tasty, simple meal it is wonderful. I would definately make it again. The vinegar was no problem, unlike what another reviewer found. In response to another comment, I made extra sauce which I used for additional basting sauce and it was just right.

Really quick and easy. My toddler loves these. They're tender and go great with basmati rice. Perfect for a fast weeknight meal.

I have made this recipe several times and received raves at each occasion. It is extremely simple, with just a few ingredients and they grill up moist and tender. I serve them either over rice or with peanut soba noodles and Asian coleslaw. Delicious.

Excellent, simple and kids friendly. I used dry sherry instead vinegar and that didn't alter the texture of the meat. Served it with simple egg and chopped parsley fried rice.

My family enjoys spicier food and we found this recipe too tame. The marinade mixture should be doubled as I felt it was rather skimpy for coating the chicken. We gave this recipe "two thumbs down" in our household so I won't make it again!

Very good - I used reduced sodium products, and found it not too salty. I like serving bamboo skewers because they're neat and easy to grill, but apparently I've overdone this a bit, because one of my friend's children remarked "how come we always have food on wooden hangers?" Out of the mouths of babes.....

I thought it was very flavorful and even my daugther (the pickiest of eaters) asked me to make it again.

Made this for dinner tonight and we really enjoyed it. It had a wonderful flavor. It was fast and easy and healthy! What more do you want?

Don't bother with this one! The recipes sounds great, but the vinegar in the marinade gave the chicken a mealy, mushy texture. Not one of us enjoyed or finished this dish.

This was okay, but not great. I have a similar recipe (from the Cooking at the CIA cookbook) which I think yields a tastier glaze: two parts mango chutney (hot), one part hoisin sauce, one part soy sauce. Garnish w/sesame seeds and chopped scallions.

Just didn't think it was anything special. Wasn't very flavorful.

I made this for a light lunch with a bok-choy salad. Everyone raved about how wonderful the chicken was. I raved because it was so easy, fast and delicious. I would make this again as an appetizer using smaller skewers. DELICIOUS!!!

I've made this dish several times already! Fast, easy and very tasty. Good enough for company or as an appetizer. My fridge is now never without hoisin, just in case!

This is a great recipe for those "soccer" nights when you need to have something quick and easy. This went over very well with the whole family. I used a grilling basket instead of skewers and it worked just as well.

I used white wine vinegar because I didn't have the rice vinegar. I also left out the sesame seeds. I served the skewers over basmati rice, and it was delicious. I normally don't like salty foods, but I didn't think it was too salty.

I thought this dish was tasty and very easy. I didn't think it was too salty as some said, but I did make sure to use a hoisin sauce with a lower sodium content (mine had 370mg sodium per 2T, but others I saw were as high as 740mg sodium per 2T). I would definitely make this again.

This is a really fast, great recipe that even my daughter who claims to despise Asian food, loved! I didn't have the rice vinegar, so I substituted equal amounts of aji-mirin (sweet cooking rice wine.) We didn't feel that the recipe was too salty, so maybe this helped. I will use this as a party appetizer too!

It helps to soak wooden skerers for about 10 minutes before putting on the chicken. We also took the chicken off theskewers and served it from a plate with extra tooth picks and plum sauce for dipping. This helps with the saltiness and is easier to eat as a passed appetiser.

I made this recently for my husband and kids and everyone loved it! A little on the salty side, but great flavor and incredibly easy to make. Will definitely make again.
