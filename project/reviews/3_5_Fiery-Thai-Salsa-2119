Love this salsa! I cut plain tortillas in triangles and bake until crisp to serve with it. Specatular low calorie appetizer. Everyone always askes for the recipe.

Excellent, excellent alternative to your usual tomato or fruit-based salsa. The cool and hot contrast was really neat. I'd add a little more sugar (maybe another tablespoon?) and possibly more chili oil than sesame, but other than that, it was great. Made this as a starter to a dinner menu that included Thai-spiced pork loin with orange curry sauce (on this site) and 3-cabbage slaw with ginger-soy dressing. Rave reviews all round!

This salsa had way too much ginger, that's all you taste! I would cut it in half if I were to make it again.
