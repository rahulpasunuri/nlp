Simple, cheap, and tasty! I thought it needed a bit more flavor so I added garlic, shallots, thyme and lots of pepper. Overall a good recipe.

I used 2 Tablespoons olive oil and 1 Tablespoons butter, I added 4 roasted garlic cloves. I sauteed the onions until very tender and dark. Check out Cooks Illustrated online for the best onion soup recipe.

I won First Place Judge's Choice at a soup cook-off with this recipe modified. Beef broth only -I used beef "Better than Bouillon." (So substitute beef for chicken). Add about 8 oz dry red wine (I used a cab). Omit celery. Add two heads of roasted garlic. Substitute smoked gouda for swiss cheese. I carmelized the onions in a stoneware dish in the oven and I added two small shallots with the roasting. (I also roasted the garlic, but it takes longer than the carmelizing so watch your timing). At the end of cooking I added a dash of half and half. This soup had amazing depth and flavor.

Try the other FRENCH ONION SOUP "Bon Appetit May 1991" recipe with the suggested substitutions, this one is to watery, not enough onions.

The recipe was OK, I don't think I will be using it again. I did not substitute anything, maybe that was my problem.

Perfect the day after. The onions took FOREVER to carmelize, but it was worth it. I'm glad I cooked it the day before my dinner party becasue it made the house smell like onions which was nice, but overbearing if you are a guest coming over for dinner. I added sherry (1/4 cup) for a little depth I thought it needed.

This recipe was quick and easy even with a few substitutions. I didn't have celery, used mozzarella cheese instead and added extra onion since it looked very sparse. It turned out delicious.

Easy and good, easy being the operative word. I also added garlic, white wine/port, and used one can beef broth, one can beef broth with onion, and one french onion beef broth. I couldn't find my Dad's family recipee, and made this instead with no complaints. Thanks fellow reviewers, I depend on previous comments!

I made this soup using ingredients I had on hand while waiting out yet another snow storm. The only adjustments I had to make were omitting the celery and using beef bouillon in the absence of stock. (I used about 2/3 as much as called for in the recipe.) To liven it up a little bit, I added 1 garlic clove and splashes of both white wine and port. The results were terrific. Of course, the crouton and swiss cheese made a good soup even better. I served this with popovers from a recipe on this site.

Excellent soup and extremely easy to make. I used French Onion Beef Broth and topped with both gruyere and swiss. I let simmer for 1hr. The soup was outstanding!

This soup really hit the spot. I added one beef boullion cube to give it a little more flavor, otherwise I wouldn't change a thing, it was quick and easy!

A great onion soup. I used old white cheddar cheese. Big mistake. It does not have the same melting quality as swiss or mozza. It was still a good dish though.

Outstanding. Quick preparation & cooking time. We used Gruyere grated cheese vs. plain swiss, and brushed the sourdough bread with Olive Oil before toasting under the broiler. Delicious!

This is a wonderful easy to make soup. We had it for Christmas eve with crackers and cheese. Warm and hearty and delicious.
