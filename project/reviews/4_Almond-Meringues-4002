Love these cookies with a little twist. I toasted the almonds to make the flavor a little richer, exchanged two of the tablespoons of lemon juice with vanilla, and added mini chocolate chips. Yum! I know its not as low cal now, but they are chewy, light, and delicious. Small detail, don't mess with them too much when you're folding the ingredients into the egg whites, it makes them less fluffy and flat.

These were quite good, but I did make some changes... I dry toasted the almonds until they were lightly browned before adding them to the egg white, which I would highly recommend. Also I reduced the powdered sugar by at least two tablespoons, since I often find desserts too sweet. In the future I think 1 1/4 cups would be ideal. I also added vanilla instead of lemon, but I think in the future, I'd like to try the recipe with vanilla and a little orange zest. In my experience the substitution alleviated the overly chewy center that some other reviewers complained of. Also, I forgot to butter the non-stick pans, and for those of you contemplating leaving off the butter or pam, just realize that you'll lose the bottom skin of your meringue. Happy Cooking!

These were delicious. I had to put them back into a 200 degree oven for another twenty minutes--as they come out too gooey, initially--and I turned them upside down to do so, since the gooeyness was mostly on the bottom of the cookies. This worked perfectly. Served and received w/ pleasure, to complement a sour cream coffee cake (frzn organic blueberries and blackberries) and a fine VSOP brandy. Yummers.

WOW! I needed to make something with 8 egg whites left over from another recipe and found this. Yum, yum, yum easy to make and better to eat!

I had high hopes for these, but was disappointed. I have never had trouble with meringue before, but these would not crisp up no matter what I did! The flavor was good even if the texture was gooey, but I might puree the almonds next time and add more spices (cinnamon, or maybe even cardamom).

Awesome! So easy and delicious. The almonds add a delightful texture. I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, which greatly enhanced the flavor. I will definitely make these in the future--they're a great, healthy dessert!

I made these for my sons' teacher who is on a wheat/gluten free diet and she loved them. She said she hadn't had anything resembling a cookie in ages and that these were wonderful. We loved them too and I make them often now and take them places frequently. They always get rave reviews.

great recipe and so quick and easy. my grandma hates meringue but she was the one to gobble them all up. to make them chewier, don't spread them out, they hold their shape well in the oven.

These were light and wonderful. I didn't have a lemon so I used about 1/4 tsp of vanilla extract. A nice change from all the chocolate. Also wonderful for those who cannot eat dairy (use Pam on the parchment!).

These are easy and delicious. I used lime juice instead of lemon juice. I didn't have enough slivered almonds, so I used half almonds, half walnut pieces.

Very simple and quick to make. Used my Kitchenaid mixer and teflon pan liners. Would be an excellent recipe to make with kids because the ingredients do not have to be precise.
