Since returning from a two-week trip to Italy with my family -- during which my 12-year-old ate gelato every night possible -- I've made this recipe twice. The texture is just about perfect -- not too hard, not too soft -- and the process by which the melted chocolate turns into "stracciatella," or "little rags" of chocolate, is fascinating. Yum.
