Absolutely delicious! Mine just came out of the oven. Soft, fluffy, chewy, it's all that! I think using oat bran makes the texture smoother compared to regular oat meal cookies. If there's someone who doesn't like oatmeal cookies for their texture, this one will be different. I am making these again without raisins for my husband who does not eat oatmeal cookies (he tried a bite of this and said he'd like some just with chocolate chips!)

A good chewy cookie, but it is lacking spices. Next time if I were to make these I would add 1-2 tsp. cinnamon and nutmeg at least, and possibly 1/2 tsp. allspice, and ground cloves.

It is so weird when people make recipe substitutions and then report back about how horrible the recipe is. The person from Corvallis below substitutes Splenda for sugar and then complains that the texture sucks.When mixed in the correct proportions with fat and flour, sugar provides texture to cookies, and Splenda is NOT sugar. Cooks Illustrated Magazine experimented with Splenda in cookies a few years ago -- here is a link: http://www.cooksillustrated.com/taste tests/overview.asp?docid=10034 They explain in kitchen chemistry terms the reasons why cookies made with Splenda don't have the chewy texsture of those made with sugar.

Have no idea what happened to Brenda4's batch. These are a favorite with all my family and friends for several years now. They are a wonderfully chewy cookie, great oatmeal texture, and the combination of chocolate and raisins is sublime! Didn't change a thing.

Horrible consistency. Browned too quickly. Greasy and doughy. Don't waste your time or money on this recipe.

Wonderful recipe. Definitely one to use again and again. Made a few changes, based on helpful tips provided by previous reviewers: added extra 1/4 cup raisins, doubled the vanilla (used Mexican vanilla), substituted dark brown sugar (instead of light brown), omitted chocolate chips, and baked for ~9 minutes. In the future, will try adding 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon and even more raisins (to a total of 1.33 or 1.5 cups).

Excellent cookie! Not a die-hard oatmeal rasin fan, but I made them for a person at work for their b-day & everyone raved! I used the dark brown sugar tip & omitted the choc chips & put in the 1 & 1/2 cup of raisins. I also baked for 10-11 minutes (8 min left them a bit undercooked).

I couldn't give the fork rating. I need to try again. My cookies were definitely NOT chewy, and chewy is what I am looking for. I took the previous reviewers suggestion and decreased the sugar (I used a generous 1/2 c. brown sugar and completed the cup with Splenda). I have decent cookies but nothing near two forks at this point. Any feedback as to why these cookies were not chewy? I assume butter is what makes them chewy, not sugar. I followed the recipe exactly as written apart from decreasing the sugar.

Like all the past reviewers of this recipe, I was not disappointed with the outcome. These cookies were chewy and a hit with my entire family. Although the cookies were great they were a lil on the sweet side so next time i make these I would only use a cup of sugar (mix of white and brown) and not use so many chocolate chips.

Oh my goodness, these cookies are my new staple. I made a few changes: dark instead of light brown sugar, no chocolate chips, about 1/4 C extra raisins and I used a full tablespoon of vanilla extract.... most important, I only baked for 8 or 9 minutes. The result were dense, intensely chewy, and DELICIOUS cookies.

This was my first attempt at baking cookies. The recipe was easy to follow and the cookies turned out TERRIFIC! Soft, chewy texture...the cookies kept for 5 days. If you love chocolate and oatmeal, these are the cookies for you!

Added a little cinnamon, otherwise followed the recipe exactly and they came out terrific. The oat bran gives it a great texture for a chocolate chip/oatmeal raisin combo.

I like to try and cut down on the sugar so I altered the recipe by using 1 cup of brown sugar, and one half cup of "Fruitsource" a fruit and grain sweetener. I used one half the chocolate chips and one half a cup or raisins. They only took 8 minutes to cook and were very good. Usually the fruitsource takes away the crunchiness of the cookie, but they were soft yet chewy. Next time I will be brave enough to substitute all the sugar with the "fruitsource". It makes the sugar a more complex one, without the bad effects that refined sugar has on the system.

Having tried almost every Oatmeal Raising cookie the world has to offer, I must say that these are exceptional. I think the Oat Bran makes the difference. Nothing alternative in the taste. Chewy, just the right sweetness, just the right texture. Rave reviews at the office and home. You might try plumping the raisins first, but it's just a matter of preference.

I added too many white choc. chips (1 cup or less would have been better, subbed for choc. chips), 1+ cup raisens was good. I also substitued the oat bran for unitentified left-over grain I had in the cabinet and that worked fine. Cookies were excelent the next day.

I wanted a good oatmeal cookie and went recipe hunting. After reviewing several I made this one. I plumped the raisins, added walnuts, and took the coconut suggestion, also grated some nutmeg into it. It was just what I was looking for. One of the best I've tried.

The cookies bit too dry and chunky. I don't really like chunky cookies. I will not make this again

Great cookies! I took the advice of another reviewer and substituted coconut for the oat bran - the cookies have a great crunchy texture combined with a nice chewiness from the raisins.

This is the 2nd time I've made these yummy cookies. I substituted "fancy flake sweentened coconut" for the bran --Remember 7 layer bars?

Very good cookies. Would maybe add a little extra flour next time as they seem a little too buttery. Love the combination of raisins AND chocolate chips. Added walnuts, which were a good addition.

yum! These are great, and so easy to make. Just for an extra boost, I replaced the bran with wheat germ and added 1/2 cup of milled flaxseed. I also left out the chocolate chips.

This recipe is really terrific! I made a few substitutions which I think now make it a superb, rich-tasting, classic chewy oatmeal raisin cookie. The substitutuions I made are: instead of light brown sugar, I used dark brown. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, left out the salt, left out the chocolate chips, left out the oat bran, and added some walnuts chopped into small pieces. I increased the raisins to about 1 1/2 cups. So, the recipe now is: 1 cup (2 sticks) of butter, room temperature 1 1/4 cups packed dark brown sugar 1/2 cup sugar 2 large eggs 1 T. vanilla extract 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour 1 t. baking soda 2 cups old-fashioned oats 1 1/2 cups raisins 1 cup walnuts, chopped into fine pieces Follow the same directions as was given in the original recipe, but I baked for eight (8) minutes only instead of 12 (but every oven is different, so it's a matter of experimentation)to get really soft (but not raw), chewy cookies, and flatted them out slightly before putting the baking sheet in the oven (they spread nicely but not too much).

These cookies were delicious! Chewy, not too sweet-simply wonderful! I didn't add the chocolate chips (just a personal preference) but instead added 1 cup of chopped walnuts. I made these for my co-workers and the cookies were gone in 10 minutes!

To reduce the fat, I replaced the butter with 1 cup of Apple Butter and reduced the sugar by 1/4c. Next time I'll replace 1/4C of chocolate chips with 1/4C of additional raisins. I also used 2 tsp of cinnamon.

My friend is quivering on the ground in ecstasy as I write this. I made these cookies for a coffeehouse, and they were fantastic! I didn't use the oat bran, though. Also, an interesting substitution is 4 egg yolks instead of 2 eggs (this was done out of necessity but worked really well).

Gooood cookies! I used egg substitute instead of eggs and they came out just fine.
