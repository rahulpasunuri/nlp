These turn out perfectly when cooked in a Fry-Daddy.

I did both this and the baked version and found that the fried one was so much more effort and the sesame seeds just all floated off which seemed very wasteful. I personally like the taste of the fried ones but the baked ones went much faster at my party.

I cut the wonton skins into quarters because I find the halves too large. These are delicious chips, worth all the work of frying, that perfectly complement the Lima Bean Hummus that they accompanied. A really interesting variation on hummus with a crunchy chip to go with.

I made these for Christmas snacks, and people loved them. I made one modification to the recipe, however: I used 1/2 teaspoon of Chinese Five Spice instead of cayenne. Next time I would use more of it and less salt, too. Also, apparently I didn't understand the directions, because I definitely didn't have 40 crisps when I was done! I would cut the wrappers in half to make a more manageable snack. They sure were tasty, though!
