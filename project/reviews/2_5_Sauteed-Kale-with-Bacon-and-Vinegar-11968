Very easy to make and I used the pre-cooked bacon! I just popped the bacon into the microwave for 45 seconds while boiling the kale, sauteed a tablespoon of chopped garlic in olive with 5 strips of chopped bacon and added the blanched kale. Tossed it all together for a few minutes with balsamic vinegar and salt and pepper to taste! Tastes wonderful and has great presentation!
