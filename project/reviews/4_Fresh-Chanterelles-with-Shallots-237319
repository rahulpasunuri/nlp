Fixed this w/ 1lb Chanterelles for three of us. Served w/ steamed broccoli drizzled w/ lemon juice and thick slices of whole grain bread. A fine light meal that's quick if your mushrooms are already clean. Chanterelles have appeared earlier than ever. So expect to do this again and splash a little sauvignon blanc into the pan.

Divine. Tried this mushroom for the first time today after my neighbor shared some that were growing in her yard. Simple, earthy fare.

Outstanding! I turned it into a spinach and chanterelle omelette.

I hadn't used chanterelles before and felt like the flavor was fine, but not anything that special. Maybe even a little bland. This dish was really easy to make but was missing something. I served it over fresh tagliattelli.

This was my first time using chanterelle mushrooms and I believe it was a success. I eyeballed the recipe but used all the ingredients it called for. I also added some gnocchi I had made the other day and topped it with parmasen cheese. Delicious!

I probably had a pound of fresh chanterelles, so I "eyeballed" the shallots and garlic. Probably used 2 large, juicy cloves of thinly sliced garlic and approximately 3 tablespoons of finely chopped, but not minced shallots. What I love about this recipe is the fact that you add the shallots and garlic AFTER you sauteed the chantrelles. The garlic and shallot added just the right amount of flavor, and didn't overwhelm the expensive fungi. At the end, I added chopped chives, sea salt and freshly ground pepper. Served warm with crispy rosemary crackers. Delish.

I saute the all the indredients with a splash of good white balsamic vingear, add salt and white pepper to taste. I prepare this for serving with chicken, steak, quiche and omelettes. Simple and perfect!

Easy and straightforward. Having read reviews of other chanterelle recipes, I was concerned that the garlic may overwhelm the delicate taste, so I skipped that, used 2x more shallots, and added 1/4 tsp fresh rosemary, 1/2 tsp fresh thyme. This tasted very fresh. I'll try sage next time (didn't have it in the garden).

Very simple and delicious. We substituted Oyster mushrooms with very good results.
