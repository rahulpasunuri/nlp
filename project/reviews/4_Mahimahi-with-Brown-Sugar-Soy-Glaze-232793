Nice easy lightly-flavored fish dish. Make this for my boyfriend's mother who is fairly picky about proteins & flavors (while we make something more exciting for us). Easy to make, and wins her over every time.

Great dish. I simplified and added everything together, wisked and added fish to marinate for a few hours. Then I put it all in a skillet, cooked covered for 4 minutes and then reduced the marinade until it was a thick glaze around the fish. served over rice with steamed broccoli.

This is great - very easy and very tasty. I have made it twice now, with excellent results.

I made this for a weeknight dinner, but I think it would also be a good "company" dish. I used low sodium soy sauce, added a little toasted sesame oil and a few flakes of red pepper. If the fish is very thick, may need to microwave a little to make sure it is cooked all the way through.

This rocks! Soooo easy. I used shallots instead of scallions and paired it with wild rice and steamed green beans. My boyfriend thought it was to die for. I'd try it with chicken if I don't have time to pick up the fish!

Often make this with salmon, very quick and easy, great for a week night dinner. I use splenda brown sugar to cut down on the calories of the sauce.

Nice and easy, as all the reviewers said. I found it a little too sweet and not as fancy as some claimed. I followed the recipe to the letter as well. We all loved it, but I do not think it was a 4 fork rating.

Like the other reviewers...this is so delicious and yummy...but I'd DEFINTELY double the sauce!!!

I chose to use halibut because the store I was at did not have mahi-mahi and this recipe still turned out amazing. It's so easy and so flavorful. Next time I'd add more chopped onions when making the glaze because they turn out really tasty. Also - for two large pieces fish this amount of sauce was perfect. I would think it might me a little light on the sauce for 4 pieces of fish. It's definitely a keeper though!

VERY GOOD. so quick and easy, used lime juice rather than lemon, gave it that extra kick to it.

Completely gourmet yet so easy. Would be appropriate for company.

So simple, and so GOOD. My fiance, who will eat fish when I cook it but doesn't really love it, uttered "hmm, not bad" when he took the first bite. That is a big compliment! I thought it was wonderful, and even more so because it was easy to put together. This one is definitely going in the rotation.

EXCELLENT! Like said before, this dish is so quick and easy to make. I used 1 lb chicken breasts rather than fish. Next time I will double the sauce.

I've made this several times because it is so easy. Works well with salmon filets but the cooking time is slightly longer. Tastes great and is easy to throw together in a pinch. Try adding a dash of fish sauce; it gives it a little more punch and interest.
