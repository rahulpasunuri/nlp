My experience was mixed. I followed the recipe except didn't do the last dot of butter on the eggs. First, the presentation is wonderful. Second, the eggs were very good but I would use less rosemary next time but then I am not much of a rosemary fan and it was strong. Third, the mushroom was somewhat 'liguidy' and the flavor of the mushroom and eggs just didn't do it for me.

My first ever attempt at broiling. My broiler times were much lower than suggested- should it have been on the low broiler setting? Either way, I kept an eye on it so it all worked out. The dish didn't look very sexy but it tasted great. I didn't have parmesan so I subbed gorgonzola (adding it right before the eggs were done) A really satisfying meal for any time of day.

This was a huge hit! Served with cornbread with chives, fruit salad and roasted asparagus with goat cheese and bacon. I had a big crowd for Mother's Day, so I used two 13x9 casserole dishes to serve...I scraped the gills out thinking I had to, then sliced the mushrooms thickly, sprayed with olive oil (forgot the garlic) and grilled outdoors in two grill baskets. I put the cooked mushroom slices in the casserole dishes and kept them warm in the oven, while I prepared the eggs (delicious!!) and topped the sliced mushrooms with the eggs.

Very Good. Scraped out gills. Keeps things colorful and gets more eggs into the mushroom. Mushrooms were not dry at all. Try these.

I have made this 3 times and everyone raves. The eggs would be great on there own too. I served this for brunch with thick sliced bacon, An orange, red onion, kalamata olives and oregano salad and toasted french bread. Very good!

Made this for Easter brunch and received rave reviews. Those who didn't like mushrooms ate the scrambled eggs on their own and loved them. Everyone was asking me for the recipe.

This recipe was fabulous and it only took about 20 minutes to make. I used garlic salt instead of minced garlic and it was great. I would highly recommend this recipe.

Spelling note: Website refused my spelling of portEbello, correcting me with portObello. However packaging has it listed as portAbello. One might add 1/4 to 1/2 t. minced onion with ingredients.

Made this for Easter brunch...was just "experimenting" after reading all the previous reviews and WOW! What a hit! Marinated the mushrooms overnight (just olive oil and garlic). Broiled well in advance and then heated in the microwave just prior to filling with the scrambled eggs. I've actually received phone calls today at work asking for the recipe!

This was easy to make for a very quick weekend breakfast. Everyone who tried it said it was delicious and said they will do it at home when they want to serve a "fancy" breakfast to their family!

I made this dish as part of my Easter Brunch. I made it exactly as called for in the recipe and my family all thought it was a perfect way to serve eggs for company (the under 12 crowd passed on the mushroom but came back for seconds on the eggs). I will definitely make it again.

Made this for some friends with whom I often share gourmet meals; with some changes. To season the mushrooms, I mixed some olive oil, thyme, garlic powder, and Greek seasoning mix in a small bowl and brushed the shroons. The taste is hugely enhanced and you don't have to wait for marinading. Also, I sliced some avocado into the base of the mushrooms before ladling in the egg. It's very easy and quite tasty - served it beside a small pan of Potatoes Anna.

I thought this dish was delicious. I have made it twice and followed the recipe as written. After making this for 8 family members, we decided this is a 4 fork recipe.

Kickass notwithstanding, I made this recipe as per the directions, and the outcome was superb.I did remove the gills from the Portobellos.

I found this recipe a delight. My sister made this for me and followed Paul's instructions using basil instead of rosemary in the eggs. Cannot understand how anyone found it bland unless they did not marinate the mushrooms first. Served with fresh strawberries and banana muffins and voila a fabulous breakfast/brunch.

We found these to be a bit bland. My biggest complaint is the way the mushroom gills discolor the eggs. Maybe scrapping out the gills would eliminate that problem, although I've never tried doing that. Didn't find the eggs to be creamy. I might try this again but use Paul's suggestion to marinate the mushrooms first.

This recipe was good but not great. A little bland. My next try I will prepare a hollandaise sauce and maybe saute the mushrooms instead of broiling. THey were rather dry when broiled.

Delicious! I made this recipe using paulkickass's suggestion on marinading the mushrooms first. Excellant idea Paul. This is definitely a keeper!

Whoa, Epicurious you just made a great call. Giving us this fine rezipe, cause it's the bomb, y'all. Now here's a little somethin' somethin' from your homeboy Paul. Marinate those fine fine funghi in 1/4 cup white wine, 1/8 cup olive oil, a teaspoon of lemon juice, some red chili flakes, that garlic and some stuff from da' McCormick spice people called Montreal Steak Seasoning. (Or any other steak spice) Let em sit for 30 min and then grill those babies if you can. If it ain't worth the time and the inevitable toil, you'll be doing just fine to forget the grill and just broil. Paul likes the chives garnish idea and says, "Why not throw some fresh basil on there too? And some diced tomato!" Here Come The Breakfast of Champions! Peace in the Paulenium!

We loved this recipe, especially how nice and soft the eggs turned out. I'm serving this for a brunch this weekend.

I made this recipe for Easter Brunch. It turned out just fine, but I didn't think the presentation was very appealing. I would probably add chopped fresh chives to the finished product and work very hard to make sure the eggs "nest" better on top of the mushrooms.
