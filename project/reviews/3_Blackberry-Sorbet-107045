I added a cup of heavy whipping cream and used frozen, Marion blackberries. The sorbet was devine. The color of the Sorbet was a rich deep purple color. Wonderful!! I would differently make this again.

This is an excellent and refreshing recipe. I added about 1 T. lemon juice because the berries I used were not that tart. Very, very easy to make and will be a staple on my summer table. I think you could also replace blackberries with any sort of berry. I served it with whipped cream. It also hase a very lovely deep purple color which is very dramatic in presentation.
