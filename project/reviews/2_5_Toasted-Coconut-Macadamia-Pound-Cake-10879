I agree that this was dry...there were parts that were delicious because they were soaked with the rum glaze...the bundt pan shape doesn't allow glaze to penetrate all over. Batter was VERY thick...I'm thinking that the recipe needed some liquid. Would love a 'better' macadamia nut cake. Maybe it could be served with rum sauce on the side...

Going to make this recipe soon, only to use it to make french toast. French toast made with pound cake is divine. Have only made it with plain so far, but I believe that made with with this cake will be great too. Just use your favorite french toast recipe and favoirte syrup. Yum

This cake had a nice flavor, but was very dry. A couple of scoops of melty ice cream made it better, but still not good enough to try again.

Even though this cake had a lot of steps, it was worth it. I made it for a work birthday and it disappeared like magic.

This cake was the hit of my brunch. The nuts are expensive but the cake is worth it.

This pound cake is a bit of an investment (I spent $7.00 alone in macadamia nuts!), but is quite tasty. It wasn't as sweet as I thought it would be so it will probably be nice accompanied by a cup of tea.

it was a good cake but not sure if the expense is worth it
