Very easy to make and VERY rich cake with a nice texture. I used self-rising flour (not cake) and baked for 45 minutes in a bundt pan, with fine results. The cake was delicious and buttery, but I found the cream cheese made it slightly too tangy for a pound cake. It was good, but my quest for the perfect pound cake continues.

Love this moist cake and have made it dozens of times, always with a PERFECT result. I've baked it in any shape bakeware imaginable ( classic Bundt pan, loaf pan, a bunny shapped pan, and, and, and...) - it always turned out well. I've played with adding different flavours- from poppy seeds to pistachios to orange & chocolate- this cake mixture is VERY adaptable and forgiving! I've covered it in chocolate glaze, I've served it with vanilla cream cheese frosting- yup, it was super amenable and delicious with those alterations also. But what impressed me most of all with this recipe - that it works so brilliantly given that I bake it here in England! Many, if not most, US baking recipes will simply not work here in Europe. Our flour is different ( higher or lower gluten/protein content to US flour, I forgot which) and this REALLY affects the success of a lot of baking recipes. But not so with Aunt Rose's pound cake. Simply get yourself some US cup measures and you are good to go. Aunt Rose - I salute you! And I thank your niece for sharing this great cake

This is a good yellow cake but it is to light and fluffy to be called a pound cake. If you are searching for a real southern pound cake this is not it! Sorry.

I love pound cakes, but had never made one myself. Normally we would pay someone to make it or do without. But I decided to make one myself and I had several recipes, but this one seems to be the most simple of them all and it had the cream cheese in it as well. I made this cake and my family enjoyed it very much. Thanks again.

Thought it tasted great, and it went well with balsamic peaches from this site. BUT, I had the opposite problem of most of the reviewers. After a full hour both end were cooked, but the top/center was mushy and uncooked-about an inch or two down. Any tips? (Used cake flour plus baking powder and salt.)

This was awesome! I used Singapore's orange additions and swapped mascarpone for the cream cheese. Served w/ the strawberry citrus salad from this site. I made it in a lamb mold for Easter, and it came out of the pan super easily (not always the case!). I had enough batter for two add'l mini loaves.

I didn't have cream cheese or self- rising cake flour. I also didn't think I needed such a large amount of batter, so I halved the ingredients, substituted sour cream (4oz)for cream cheese and added baking soda (1t) & salt(pinch) to the all-purpose flour (1c). I baked in a glass loaf pan for 50 mins (5,000+ altitude). It made a moist, slightly tart and wonderful pound cake with a nice crust and good crumb. I will make it again with this variation and also try the original soon.

I was looking for a recipe to use overripe bananas and I was tired of banana bread. So I took this recipe, replaced the cream cheese by 3 mashed bananas. Because bananas are more "liquid" than cream cheese, I used only 4 eggs. With a chocolate icing this cake is a hit!

This flavorful, beautifully textured cake is simple, quick and easy to make. I could not find self-rising cake flour but had complete success with adding one teaspoon of baking powder and 1/8 teaspoon of salt per cup of flour. The batter rose to completely fill and slightly rise above the edges of a 10 inch bundt pan but did not overflow. I put a cookie sheet under it just in case, and this may have slowed the baking a little. This cake required a full hour at 350 degrees as it was still jiggling at 50 minutes. (I highly recommend the toothpick test for doneness.) I think the temperature of the cream cheese and butter are important as the first time I made the cake, cold cream cheese would not become light and fluffy when beat with the softened butter but when I repeated the recipe a week later with warm cream cheese (room temp and nuked about 15 seconds) it became quite fluffy. I also brought the eggs to room temperature which I believe helped keep the batter the right consistency. This lovely cake won't fail to please, especially served with fruit toppings and a cup of good coffee.

the texture and flavor of this cake were great. i loved that it was rich, but not oily. i made some variations. i added some orange zest and grand marnier. i also coated it with a glaze made of grand marnier and sugar. i found that the orange zest and grand marnier added some good interest to a very good fundamental cake. one problem i did have with the cake, though, is that it did not finish baking in 50 minutes. it took a whole hour, for the most part. i split the batter into two pound cake pans and they were full!! overall, a great recipe and a keeper!

I first tried this recipe in 2000 and it came out perfectly. Followed directions to a "t". Then, we moved and the only thing different was the oven. I, like other posters, had the "marzipan middle" problem. Anyway, my THANKS to all the home chefs who suggested the changes to the recipe; today I made it, and it was absolutely perfect. I used self-rising (non-cake) flour, added 2 tsps of baking powder + 2 pinches of salt, beat the vanilla in before the eggs and flour, and baked it in a 10 inch bundt pan, nonstick sprayed with Pam for baking for 55 minutes. All I can say is, hubby, who's NOT a pound cake fan and had missed this for years, had three big hunks of it at the movies today. Happy New Year to all!

I used a 10-15 cup Nordic Ware bundt pan (greased and floured) and the cake popped right out and was perfectly cooked. There was ample room in the bundt pan to prevent the cake from flowing over. The cake had excellent flavor and texture but I thought it was just a touch dry after it cooled down. Would be perfect toasted and brushed with melted butter, or with fruit and cream, but to me it seems a little dry to be served plain once it has cooled down.

Rating: 4
excellent and always finished off: if not at dinner then for a midnight snack - it never sees the morning. I use a silicone bundt pan and cooking always takes alot longer (about 1hr20m last time around). Sometimes i have an overflowing problem, but that is usually just when/if i let is sit before cooking - it starts to rise. Totally excellent cake though, and easy (and the raw batter is about as good as raw batter gets - i always end up eating aa bunch of it).

Stupendous basic pound cake - I have been testing and searching for years. Was skeptical after reading the bizarre sequence of events in the mixing department - eggs after solids? Try it - perfect with fruit toppings, sauces and ice cream, with coffee. And DUH, no self rising flour? 1C flour to 1t baking powder plus salt.

I was searching for a pound cake recipe and came across Aunt Rose's Pound Cake. This cake is so moist and delicious. It took the entire 50 minutes to bake and I will share this recipe with pound cake lovers via e-mail.The only change I made was to use butter and lemon flavoring instead of margarine and vanilla flavoring. I made a lemon glaze to pour over. Thanks a lot Aunt Rose. I waould also like to see some of your other recipes.

This is the first pound cake I have ever made, and it was quite lovely. It was moist, and moderately dense, a combination that worked well. I used normal 'doctored' flour, not self-rising flour. Here is the conversion that I used. For every 1c self-rising flour use 1c all purpose flour - 2T flour + 1.5t baking powder + 1/8 t salt. The cake rose nicely, and is a nice addition to my recipe collection.

A beautiful cake, not quite as dense as other pound cakes. I used White Lily self rising flour and had only one problem. Since I haven't made a recipe for some time that required sifting the flour, I sifted the flour first then measured it. Needless to say this doesn't give you the correct amount of flour. Just a reminder, measure first, then sift. Other than that, an easy cake to make, especially appreciated by folks who love white cakes. Served it with fresh cut strawberries.

Rating: 4
This was proabably the best pound cake I've ever tasted, and I've tasted many. It is nicely dense, with a velvety smooth grain and paradoxically tender yet chewy "crust" (or edge). People who are disappointed or think it's dry probably did not use cake flour. Cake flour, as called for in the recipe, is crucial to making the cake moist and perfectly textured. My cake was done at exactly 50 minutes and came right out of the pan, which I prepped with Pam for baking (has flour in it). I served it with strawberries and fresh whipped cream. To die for good! My dinner guests raved.

I have wanted to make this recipe for a long time. (I was scared off by the lack of self-rising cake flour in my area. Finally used White Lily Self Rising.) I made some small modifications to make the cake lemony--omitted Vanilla and added 1.5T lemon juice and 2T lemon zest. Despite being very careful while mixing and baking, the cake was quite dry. It looked beautiful, but I was so VERY disappointed since I had been waiting so long to make this. I probably will not make again--it's pretty pricey for such a let-down.

A great pound cake! I made it several days ago and had no problems as previous cooks did. No sticking taking out of the pan (used Pam) and was done in exactly 50 min. Also, I followed the advice of others and used the 2 tsps. baking powder and 1.5 tsps. of salt. I also could not find self rising cake flour here in CT. Very moist and great flavor. Only wish I didn't just have to only sample this, since trying to lose some holiday tonage! But, my family loved it with strawberries and whipped cream. Do make it!

Followed the recipe, including cooking time, and got a perfect pound cake --- heavy, moist, tasty, with a thin brown crust. Easy, though it did take longer than the 10 minute advertised time. Served with "Boothbay Blueberry Sauce" (also on Epicurious). Will be experimenting with adding fruits in the future.

This recipe resulted in a dee-lish pound cake!Had to bake it over the recommended time as the middle was still mushy. The top got too brown, but really didn't matter once it was sliced and fruit & whipped cream were added. Everyone was happy and wanted the recipe. Will definitely make again!

ALRIGHT! This is the best! I have made it 3 times and it has been perfect. Three caveats:use the "toothpick doneness test!" While some reviewers said 50 min was too long, it was too short for where I live! I added 10 minutes. Second, where the recipe says that it will be crumbly before you add the eggs, I didn't fine that description to be true so don't think that you have "messed-up" if your batter isn't crumbly. Finally, The majority of the reviewers on the sight have great tips, use them! Enjoy1

The cream cheese makes the BIG difference! For folks in Singapore, do note that 2 sticks of butter is equivalent to 1 large block (250g) in our supermarkets. I also made an orange cake using this as a basic recipe. I added 1 tbsp of grated orange zest, 2 tbsp orange juice, 1 tbsp of Cointreau liquer, substituted the vanilla with 2 tsp of orange essence, and cut the sugar to 1.75 cups which is more suited to local tastes. Yummy!

This is very similar to another cake (Vanilla Raisin Cake) I've been making for years. One of the differences is that my recipe adds currants or raisins cut in half.

Absolutely delicious and very moist (not surprising, given the 2 sticks of butter)! Couldn't find self-rising cake flour at the market, so I did some research and came up w/ the following substitution, which worked beautifully: For each cup of flour called for, sift one cup flour, remove 2 Tbs. of the flour, replace it with 2 Tbs. cornstarch and add 1 & 1/4 tsp. baking powder and a pinch of salt. Re-sift before adding. (For this recipe, you'll do that 3 times then measure out 1/3 of the final cup). It's certainly easier to have the self-rising cake flour, but if it's unavailable this does work well. My daughters, 6 & 7, loved this toasted w/ even a bit more butter. It's absolutely delicious.

It was an easy recipe and of course, I had my husband doing the mixing and he was able to follow my directions without any problems.

for boston: Haven't made this cake, but it is very similar to my own family recipe - and the same thing happens occasionally to me. My mom and I believe it has to do with how well the vanilla or other flavoring agents are incorporated. I tend to put it in in the beginning with the eggs and sugar to avoid the "layer effect." If you add it at the end, it does seem to happen. However, it isn't really "uncooked" and it doesn't affect the flavor at all, and some members of the family prefer it this way. Don't overcook a cake - worst thing you can do.

People, I need help here. I have made this cake probably 8-10 times and it's usually very good. However, several times, I have had this problem: even though the cake seemed to be thoroughly cooked (to the point that the borders were slightly burnt), when I cut it, there was something that looked like a very thin moist (uncooked?) line halfway through the cake. I don't understand why this is happening. The line is very thin, but is there. The very obvious answer would be that I need more cooking time, but as I said, this has happened even though when the borders were already getting burnt. Any ideas?

Definately delicious. An extremely flavorful moist and dense yellow cake. A bit springier than a pound cake (due to the leavening in the self rising flour I suppose.) If you are hoping for the fine grained sandy texture of a classic poundcake, then seek out a recipe without leavening. This one is definately a keeper though. It was absolutely delicious. I also could not locate self rising cake flour, so on the advice of a previous reviewer, I added 2 teaspoons of baking powder and a half teaspoon salt to the recipe with amazing results! Yummy.

This most closely matches an amazing pound cake I had at a bakery in Playa del Carmen, Mexico. I begged the baker for the recipe and he coyly told me the cake had no "harina" (flour) in it. Yeah, right. My brother-in-law is a chef and lead me to this recipe after I described the cake to him. It's absolutely divine. Watch it closely -- if you overbake it, it will be too dry. Also, you can find cake flour near the Bisquick (it, too, is boxed like Bisquick). Enjoy!!!

I was really looking forward to making this cake after reading the reviews but I was a bit disappointed. It is good but lacks the heft and density that I was expecting in a pound cake.

My family is from South Carolina, and a good pound cake is one of the items, along with a light a fluffy biscuit, that cooks strive to perfect. Aunt Rose's Pound Cake is one that I have found to be "perfection." (Sorry Aunt Vina, and Aunt Ginny!!)The cook from Sydney apparently made some error. Please try this one again! I have made it in several flavors, but adding almond extract and slivered almonds was the most memorable, especially when accompanied by fresh sliced peaches, and a dollop of whipped cream. It keeps and travels well. Thank you, Auntie Rose wherever you are! I would also like to know how this worked as a layer cake. Any results?

I made this twice. The first time, I added 1 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt. The flavor was good, but part of the inside looked like marzipan, even though I had to bake it 60 min. A friend told me it was too dense, so the next time, I used Neufchatel cheese and added 1.5 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt. It turned out much better, although it was not quite as moist as I'd like. The next time I'll serve it with whipped cream and berries to moisten it.

I was served this recipe at a family reunion. I made it the following day for my house. It has been two days since I made it and it is gone! I plan to try this as a layer cake. Mixing it in the KitchenAid makes it very light. I used a bit of marscapone in place of some of the cream cheese.

I agree with the other posts: this is perfection in a pound cake -- I don't know what else you could ask for. And here (I hope) is the last word on the "self-rising flour" issue (I couldn't find such a product either): on the back of the Swan's Down Cake Flour I use, there was a pound cake recipe that called for 3C of cake flour, 1 tsp. of baking POWDER, and 1/2 tsp. salt. I added those quantities to this and it was perfect. Good luck!

I can't imagine there is a better pound cake recipe out there. This is PERFECT. I also used non-self-rising cake flour, not realizing it until the last second before I was going to pour the batter into the pan!! All I did was look on the back of my baking powder can and add what it said to add-- 1 teaspoon of baking powder for every cup of flour, minus a half tsp. for every additional egg after the third egg (got that??). I ended up just adding a tsp., and it came out absolutely perfect! Next time will definitely add some berries and freshly whipped cream, but this cake also stands on its own just fine. Thanks Aunt Rose! (:

It really is a pain trying to find self-rising cake flour. I called the company and they gave me instructions (baking *powder* and salt added). It does make a lovely pound cake. The batter is so thick at one point though that I think it just about killed my electric beater.

This cake was wonderful. But like other readers, I could not find self-rising cake flour. I followed the suggestion from A Cook from Coral Springs, Fl and DIASTER ENSUED. I think A Cook must have meant two teapoons of BAKING POWDER and not BAKING SODA. When I used two teaspoons of BAKING SODA the cake was heavy, greasy, and had a huge tunnel in it. I did some research (thank you, Shirley Corriher) and I made the cake again with regular cake flour, three teaspoons of BAKING POWDER, and a dash of salt, and it was wonderful.

Having made this recipe twice now, I have to say that it's one of the best pound cakes around; perhaps those bakers who've found it to be dry should check their oven temps or take it out a minute or so sooner. It was moist with a lovely crumb and texture. I tried an extract called "Fiores de Sicillia" (I'm sure the spelling is wrong) available thru the King Arthur website, and I used regular self-rising flour. My in-laws demolished the entire thing within an hour, so I think they must have liked it as well! I'd encourage anyone who didn't care for it to give it another try and be vigilant during the last few minutes of the given baking time.

I finally found the self rising flour at Wal-mart. It is the Presto brand and they have a web site. I made one error though. I used 1 stick of butter and 1 stick or margerine and they were salted. You could taste this in the cake because there is also sodium in the flour mix. Next time I'll know better. I also used Neufchatel cream cheese because there is less fat and it's softer. I had great success otherwise and it raised beautifully.

Cake was very moist and just seemed to call for strawberries and whip cream - although it was moist enough to eat just by itself. I used cake flour and added the baking powder and salt as suggested by other cooks. The cake just seemed to disappear all by itself.

I used self-rising flour as I could not find the self-rising cake flour anywhere. The cake cooked beautifully and I had no problem with it sticking to the pan. It certainly is a pretty cake when served with fruit and whippped cream. My eight year old daughter thought it was wonderful and loved it. I thought it was a pretty typical pound cake, not quite as moist as I had expected. We all did agree that it tasted better the second day.

A little on the dry side - but so easy - no problems with the pan - cake just slid right out! I wish I could have a little bit moister - but I don't want it undercooked...hmmm - guess eating it with icecream would solve my problem!

I thought it was a good recipe and very easy, but the end result wasn't as moist as I had expected. I used the poundcake as a base for a tiramisu cheesecake with fair results. I guess I was underwhelmed.

Is self rising cake flour any different from self rising cake and pastry flour?

I had no problem finding the self-rising cake flour so that wasn't a concern for me. After mixing all the ingredients together the batter was tremendously light and fluffy and it filled up the 10" Bundt pan. In the oven it actually rose so much that it overflowed but luckily solidified before completely dripping over the whole edge and onto my oven floor. The baking time took a bit longer in my oven but when it came out I had no problem getting the cake out of the pan (I used Baker's Joy to grease the pan instead of butter and flour). The flavor of the cake is wonderful and the crumb texture is velvety smooth and so moist! (Of course this is a very rich recipe). I'll hold on to this recipe and make it again!

This recipe was great. I used regular flour and added the 2 teaspoons baking powder and salt as someone suggested and it turned out great. I found self rising flour at the store, but I guess it has to be "cake" self rising flour? My cake had to cook about an hour and I had to cover the top with foil to keep it from getting to brown. The second time I made it, I didn't have any cream cheese in the house, so I substituted a cup of sour cream and added some extra flour since it was a little moist. The end result was ok, it had a spongy texture but was still good. Next time I will try adding some chocolate chips and more vanilla to the original recipe and see how that turns out.

As this recipe specifies Self Rising Cake Flour and I could not locate this in my area I contacted Swans Down Cake Flour On the internet. A Ms. Macaluso responded telling me that Swans Down does make a self rising cake flour (in a green Box) but it is can be difficult to find as most stores only carry the regular Swans Down (red box). It can be ordered from Swans Down if your local grocer does not carry it. She also stated that the regular cake flour could be used by adding one-half teaspoon baking powder and one-fourth teaspoon salt to one cup Swans Down Cake Flour. I plan to make this cake soon and will let you know how it turns out.

This recipe was great even tho i made a few changes. I halved the amt of sugar and substituted applesauce for half the butter but it still turned out tasty! the second time i tried making a chocolate version by adding 1/4 cup of cocoa and 3/4 cup of flour and it turned out like a cheesecake textured cake! rather yummy though!

I thought it was good,my guests said very good. I added 1/2tsp more vanilla, but I think it could use more. It was moist for a poundcake, but I was expecting moist like a carrotcake. Cooked in less time, and I probably should have taken out sooner even though one side tested wet. Maybe a bad oven day, because when I cut the wet side the cake had a few holes in it. I'll try again.

This is,without a doubt, the best pound cake I've ever tasted. It is also so easy to make! I've made it several times in the last few weeks and have had many requests for the recipe. A wonderful cake for any occasion!

I made this recipe using cake flour with terrible results. (I couldn't find self-rising cake flour, and mistakenly thought the "cake" was more important than the "self-rising). Needless to say, the cake was denser than a black hole. In fact, there was no crumb -- when I cut into it, the inside looked like marzipan. I have no idea where you can get self-rising cake flour, but from reading these other reviews, I realize that the "self-rising" part is key. Despite the baking debacle, I'd make it again just because my guests were raving about how "yummy" the cake was. Then again, with the amount of butter, sugar and eggs in the receipt, it's no wonder my guests walked away happy.

I made this cake with plain self-rising flour not realizing that it said "cake" flour. It came out beautiful, rising way above the pan. It is delicious with strawberries and whipped topping or whip cream.

What a great pound cake! Instead of self-rising cake flour, I used regular flour and added 2 teaspoons baking powder and one teaspoon salt. It rose beautifully, and had a really nice texture. Also, I used a teflon tube pan coated with no-stick spray, and had absolutely no problem with sticking.

Although I am a vegan and don't eat cooked food, I love to bake and made this for a small meeting at my home(9 people).... it was still warm when served and was totally wolved down in a heartbeat! Served with fresh strawberries and whipped cream.I will definitely make this again. I had no trouble finding 'self-raising' flour.

DELICIOUS!!! I did have some trouble, however. I copied the recipe from the magazine in a waiting room. I couldn't find self-rising cake flour, and didn't realize until I found the recipe on this web site (thanks to the cook from WI!!) that self-rising regular flour existed. After some research I found in a cookbook that self rising cake flour contained 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt per cup of flour. After some time with the calculator and some measuring, subtracting and adding, I made the cake. I also did not add the flour and sugar together and the batter was already soupy when I added the eggs. I did have to run out while it was baking and when I returned, it had sunk all around the center of the pan. I tasted a piece as I was scraping it into the trash and it was good, so I persevered. I found the recipe on the web site, got self rising flour, took out a couple of tablespoons (emergency substitution for cake flour), followed the mixing directions and the cake rose perfectly and was wonderful. It did stick to the pan in spots and I think I will try spraying with Pam and flouring next time. Definitely will make it again--I served it with homemade peppermint and coconut ice creams, fudge sauce, lime custard and fresh berries and it was a big hit. It actually tastes fabulous just by itself.

First, I could not find self rising cake flour. Imade it with regular cake flour with a poor result. The taste was very good, but the cake did not rise properly. I will try again,adding baking powder and salt. Did anyone else have problems with this recipe as written?

This is really good!! The only thing was that I couldn't find self-rising cake flour so I just used self-rising flour. Does anyone in the Madison, WI area know where I can purchase self-rising cake flour?

Probably the best pound cake I've ever had--unbelievably moist, great flavor, great texture (not crumbly). A winner!
