First, this recipe needs some salt, particularly if you are only using one jalapeno. I chopped up the tomato, avacado and hearts of palm and seasoned them with a little kosher salt. I put them on top of the lettuce then added the dressing. (This recipe did make a lot of dressing. I considered thinning it with some vinegar to add flavor and cut the fat a little. I may try that if I make it again). Second, I added about 2/3 of a hothouse cucumber cut into bite size chunks just for kicks.

Only had 1 jalapeno on hand so added some jalapeno tabasco sauce. Did the rest as recommended. Definitely not bland but very, very, very rich. Way too much dressing; 1/3 would have sufficed.

This was our New Year's dinner, and we found it to be rather bland and tasteless.

After reading the reviews, I decided to sprinkle the chili powder w/garlic powder and the other listed ingrediants. Then I seared the seafood in a hot cast iron skillet for just a couple of minutes on each side. Let the seafood cool. The flavor was more pronounced.

I made this for my husband and I last night and it is a nice, light, summer dinner. I used 4 oz. medium shrimp, 4 oz bay scallops, and crab meat that I had in the freezer. I quartered the dressing ingredients except the jalapeno - I used one whole one. The dressing was not flavorful enough for our taste but that could also be from using light sour cream and fat free mayo. Instead of the showy presentation I lightly tossed the veggies and seafood with some of the dressing then added mesclun and tossed again. I served the extra dressing on the side.

This is a great summer main course salad. I did it with grilled shrimp & sea scallops. Also tossed some chopped spinach separately in a bit of the dressing, and used that as a bed for the entire affair. Dressing is just delish.....I made only 1/3 the recipe, and used a humungous Jalapeno, so it had plenty of zip. Also increased the lime juice a bit. Yum!! It's definitely a keeper!

We make this dressing for a shrimp appetizer every week and get loads of comments. I'm just here printing up the recipe for the dressing for a client. I use pickled Jalapenos for a milder yet still zippy taste.

Great presentation! Dressing flavor is good though not outstanding.

I have made this twice and voth times the guests thought the dish was elegant - probably because it is so rich! Spice the dressing to taste - a little more zing is good. Also, go light on the dressing so it doesn't weigh down the salad.

I've been making this for years, always to rave reviews requests for the recipe and will even whip up a downsized version for lunch or dinner. "Bland" doesn't describe this at all so if you got "bland", you definately did something wrong - maybe forgot the jalepeno?

This is a great recipe for bridal or baby showers! Not bland at all! The presentation is wonderful and it is easy to make into a "Light" dish by subbing with light products. I used a little more dry mustard than it calls for. The hard boiled eggs and the tomatoes are nice additions too.

Maybe I did something wrong, but this was bland and nothing exceptional.

Did a scaled down version of this for two. It'a a keeper! For all you palm lover's out there, next time you have the coals going for a grilled chicken salad, try grilling some hearts of palm as well...the smokiness adds a whole new depth of flavor...yummy!

Great recipe, I used hard-boiled egg and didn't think it lacked for flavor. Fun, tasty and easy plus it got rave reviews.

Fabulous dish. Impressive, yet not overly complicated. Really great flavours (but I think I might leave the hearts of palm out next time- some loved them, some left them on the side of their plate).

My husband and I always seem to get the craving for a good Louie. This beats them all. I usually have to hide the hearts of palm from him, or he gobbles them down. Now when I tell them they're "for that salad", he stays away. This is amazing. I cut way down on the shrimp. It's so rich, you really don't find yourself wanting that much. Next time I'm trying the boiled egg version!

I made this recipe for my bridge group and everyone wanted the recipe. I used 3/4 cup low-fat sour cream and 3/4 cup of low-fat mayonnaise to cut down on the fat. I also followed the suggestion of the Philadelphia cook and omitted the crab and substituted hard boiled eggs.

This is a cholesterol nightmare but so good!! I added "grape" tomatoes (really sweet cherry tomatoes), and hard-boiled egg, and omitted the crab. It was delicious but tasted very caloric.

I have a gorgeous jpg of this salad. It looked so nice arranged on a platter I just had to take a photo. It also tastes wonderful. It's a great buffet offering.
