NEVER, NEVER, NEVER AGAIN will I inflict shrimp and cocktail sauce upon my guests. This recipe is absolutely outstanding! For nonalcohoic guests, I didn't marniate the shimp and served the sauce on the side. If you are going through all the expense of serving shrimp, why not make it spectacular?

Too boozy? Aquavit does has a unique flavor but I think this recipe is sublime, not overpowered by alcohol. This is the 4th time we're making this for a party - I originally made it for a Swedish friend's dinner party and people keep requesting that we bring it back.

I followed all the instructions, but this dish was not only too boozy, it burned all the way down. What a waste of shrimp!

Just like when I was in Denmark. Very good and the very same taste. Who ever gave you this recipe nailed it.I served some ice cold Aquavit on the side as well.
