This was not spicy at all with 1/2 a california jalepeno. My husband liked it a lot and it tasted "healthy" but I wasn't a big fan. I didn't like the taste of the tomato sauce. Next time I would try the canned tomato or fresh tomato as others suggested or use more white wine and no tomato sauce. Everything else was fine and it was very easy, just not super tasty.

I was in a rush, and only looked at the ingredients list and started cooking. I chopped everything, threw it in the pot with some oil, and dumped 5 lbs of mussels into the pot - then threw on the lid, and let them steam for about 9 minutes. Oh yes, I exchanged the basil for cilantro... and didn't take time for the lemon peel. The broth was amazing, and we paired it with brown rice :) Can't wait to try it with the other ingredients.

I was only serving 4 people, so I used 3 pounds of steamer clams and 1 pound of shrimp and served it over linguine. Otherwise, I prepared the recipe as written. My guests were in orbit! The sauce wasn't very spicy at all, so I would double or even triple the amount of jalapeno next time. This was an easy dish to prepare and the presentation is wonderful. Great for entertaining.

Great way to prepare clams. I added another jalapeno so it was nice and spicy. Great to eat out side with wine and 'crusty bread.'

I made this recipe last night using half the butter and only 4 pounds of clams. Although every last clam was eaten and we enjoyed mopping up the broth with our 'crusty bread' I'm not sure that I would make the recipe again - it was good, not great. Also, despite my affinity for salt, I did find the recipe rather salty despite using unsalted butter and adding no salt. I suppose the clams added their own brine!

Fantastic! Wouldn't change a thing. I also made the recipe with only mussels and then a combination of both. Everyone loves this. Even those who don't love shellfish will love the sauce.

This was outstanding....only change was I added more jalapeno's. Nothing was left of the sauce - we just drank it up who needs bread.

Wow! What a great dish for little effort. The only change I made (as there were only 2 of us) was to use only 2 lb clams (but same amt sauce). Served with whole wheat tortellini and a baguette. We eat clams or mussels every Friday night as they are so easy and with a sauce like this the results are great (restaurant quality).

It was my first experience cooking clams and was so easy. I omitted the tomato sauce and just used the called for amount for 2 ppl. I loved the flavor of the basil, chilis, and lemon. The bread is a must for the sauce...

I've made this dish a few times since my initial review and it's even better if you use fresh chopped plum tomatoes (about 4 or 5 of them) instead of the canned sauce. I also like to use a lot more jalepeno (a whole one, with seeds) or a serrano chili, instead of the amount listed in the recipe.

Very good, maybe not "a dish beyond compare." As noted, the juices are really wonderful when soaked up with crusty bread. I followed earlier suggestions and used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce. Makes sense to me to do that instead. Not sure how much the basil added (and I love basil). Husband was a little iffy on clams as a main course, but he enjoyed it.

This recipe was phenomenal! I served it with a fresh loaf of french bread with garlic butter -- dee-lish! The only thing I would do differently next time is save the sauce to use on pasta for another night!

This is sinfully good...just the right amount of heat from the jalapenos and the lemon brightens it. It's my favorite go to recipe for clams!

Delicious. I made scaled the butter back by half, used a can of petite diced tomatoes instead of sauce, and doubled the jalapenos. The loaf of crusty bread is a must!

Absolutely fantastic. I did half butter and half olive oil for the base. I also substituted diced tomatoes for the tomato sauce per other suggestions. Also, I ended up putting in a whole small lemon of juice and it wasn't too overpowering. Definitely a recipe with wiggle room in the measurements.

This dish is excellent, but very salty. I would recommend using unsalted butter and low-salt tomato sauce - and then add extra salt as needed.

This recipe is so easy and so delicious. The only thing I left out was the grated lemon peel. I served it with a salad and crusty bread. The broth is excellent. A definite keeper!

This was so delicious. Made a french loaf for soaking up the sauce. Big hit at a dinner party (even those who don't care for clams). Yum!

This was absolutely delicious, the best recipe I've ever made for clams. Served over linguine, with lots of bread for the sauce. The lemon taste really came out and it was nice and spicy from the jalapeno, just how I like it. Great dish!

Yum...Yum...Yum...the sauce on its own is amazing. I used a can of petite diced tomatoes & served with fettucine. Fab!

Impeccable dish! I thought the restaurant in Mammoth had the best bucket of clams I ever had, until I tried this one.

We dug for some beautiful littlenecks on Cape Cod this weekend and when I came home, I searched all of Epicurious for the perfect recipe. Since we wanted linguine with our clams, I just added 1 lb. of linguine to the sauce at the end. I used just 2 TBSP of butter and about 2 TBSP. of olive oil. I also added a half pint of halved cherry tomatoes and a TBSP of capers. The canned tomatoe sauce was an 8 oz. can of Hunts Sauce. I served with grated parmesean. This dish was outstanding! I would definitely make it again. My husband wasn't even sure he liked clams and he raved about this dish!

Excellent! I have made this several times this summer as an appetizer. You can make the sauce before your guests arrive and then throw in the clams when you are ready to serve. My husband's been begging me to make it as a whole meal so I think I will.

This is a fast, easy summer meal to make. After reading the previous comments, I had cut down on the lemon juice to 2T. Next time, I will add more. This recipe is so flexible, that you could add anything to it with excellent results. I will experiment with peppers and capers next time.

Easy and delicious. I think next time I will throw in some diced tomatoes as well to add interest.

Awesome. Used 6.5lbs of clams and 4 people devoured them. Definite keeper in the recipe file.
