Can this recipe fit an 8x8 cake pan instead of a pie pan? I'd like to know if I can turn this into a dessert that is portable?

I needed to find a recipe that used up egg yolks after making meringue cookies - and this really hit the spot. It was time consuming, however I ended up making it over 2 seperate days (crust and custards on one day and the caramel on the second day) to no detriment of flavor or texture. At first when I read the recipe I almost didn't make it because it called for using a food processor to make the crust. I do not have a large processor and decided to try it by hand with a good ol' pastry blender. The crust tastes and feels like a short bread cookie. So don't let lack of equipment dissuade you from making this. Then again if you do not have a good heavy bottomed pan making the custard and caramel can be very tricky. I got rave reviews at a party and will definately make this again - I will just plan my time better.

This has been a holiday staple for years and has been very popular around the holidays. I increase the sugar in the topping to 1 cup. It makes for a smoother caramel that isn't overly sweet.

This is more challenging than the typical pecan pie, but it was very well worth it. Made it for Thanksgiving last year and was warned by my family that I wouldn't be allowed back in the house this year without it. :)

This is a great combination of flavors. I served this to my family who prefers the "traditional" pecan pie and they loved it. Preparation is a bit tricky, but the experienced cook should have no problem.

This sounded like the perfect Thanksgiving dessert, but it was very trying. The custards and the crust worked great, but after 5 tries at the caramel topping, I went back to a tried and true recipe I have. This one was impossible! Taste was pretty good, but I was disappointed.
