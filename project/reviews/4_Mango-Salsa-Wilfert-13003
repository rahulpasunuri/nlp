Gotta love these people that feel the need to attach their name to a recipe....

I agree with the other reviewers - this salsa makes a great topper for chicken and fish. I love it on tacos and burritos, too! The only thing I wouldn't imagine it being good on is red meat, of course. Using red onion is definitely the way to go. I kept the seeds from half of one of the jalepenos rather than discarding all of them. DO recommend the gloves while chopping them - otherwise your eyes will burn if you scratch them afterwards - even after you've washed them five times! But it's worth it even if you don't have the gloves. Also, if you're wondering where to find coriander sprigs, I think that's just cilantro (the way they used to refer to it back in '96). I used coriander powder the first time since it confused me and that kept longer than cilantro, which tends to wilt before the rest of the ingredients are close to going bad. Cook's note: I noticed that Trader Joe's sells peeled mangos in the jar so if you're looking to save time this is a good substitution for fresh ones. They just won't be as firm - there's enough firmness in the rest of the ingredients, though, I think.

absolutely delicious and really easy to make. The only change I made was red onions for "regular" onions....and I made it quite spicy which was perfect for my "crowd." Served it over grilled chicken, would love to try it with fish.

Made this for the Fourth celebration and it was a total hit. I was out of jalapenos, so I used a Thai red chili, stripped of ribs and seeds, minced fine. Fast and utterly simple, made the night before, delicious with tortilla chips before dinner, and as a condiment for grilled chicken and steak. It is even HEALTHY and no-fat!

Great with grilled salmon, chicken or pork. Peaches or nectarines can be substituted for mangoes.

Got many compliments on this recipe. The crunch from the apple makes this recipe a standout from other mango salsas I have tried.

Made this to go with Trout and used it with cold chicken the next day. Am just making it again and had to add my kudos. Definitely a keeper.

This was delish! I added a little extra garlic and cumin, but otherwise followed the recipe and everyone loved it!

A really great salsa espically if you're looking for something a little different. I like to use this with grilled shrimp (lighly oiled and sprinkled with seasoned salt or Cavander's or whatever you like), a little lettuce and a warm flour tortillia for a tasty summer taco.
