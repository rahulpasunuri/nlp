Very good. But that's what I would expect when pan-searing such a wonderful cut of beef. Morals are SO expensive and this recipe, I felt, didn't deliver on flavor. Next time try this: Sear the steaks on very high heat (at desired doneness, remove and wrap in foil to keep warm), in same pan add minced shallots, deglaze the pan with wine, simmer, add a little beef broth, reduce the sauce, add some crushed peppercorns, add a little Cognac, whisk in a pat of butter and spoon over steaks. You could add some cream, but in this one, it seems to add just fat, not flavor.

Fantastic. Beyond expectations. Not the healthiest recipe around, but definitely one of the best-tasting recipes I've made in recent memory. This will go into rotation for when special meals are needed. Note - I splurged on fresh morels from California and they were great!

We have made this for years now----I haven't found another recipe that holds a candle to it!

I found that the mushrooms did not add the flavour that I had been hoping for. I would just make a peppercorn cream sauce and add mushrooms to it next time. It was also too salty.

I loved this recipe. It was easy to make and delicious. I did think it was a bit of overkill on the mushrooms. I think I would change the stuffing to just caramelized onions or a medley of julienned veggies.

Fantastic--I made this recipe for Christmas dinner. The sauce was to die for--what great flavor. However, I used three types of mushrooms for the stuffing-dried morels, shataki, and baby portobella's. Adding roasted garlic to the stuffing gave it a wonderful flavor--not over-powering the mushrooms. To the sauce I added the shataki and portobella's, the reserve mushroom liquid, shallots, cabernet sauvignon, thyme, beef broth, 2 T butter and cream. Deglazing the pan with the wine to get the drippings before adding it to the sauce, gave the sauce some of the roasted garlic flavor. This recipe is definitely at the top of my entertainment list. It was easy to make and everyone asked that I make this again next year instead of the traditional prime rib.

My husband and I enjoyed this dish very much! I would definitely make this again.

I made this the first time tonite, with fresh mushrooms -- and it was worth coming back to recommend this recipe to the next person perusing for a good way to get the most from your morels. Since I had no liquid from soaking the mushrooms I used some chicken broth to add to the liquid. The final sauce was very rich, but very good.

I love to cook so it is rare that I make recipes twice just because I always like to try new things. But this has become an old favorite and my husband asks for it at least once a week. I don't stuff the filets either. And it all turns out amazingly well. And SO easy.

Very good "fancy" dinner, but very simple. I made homemade broth from beef short ribs--worth the trouble considering the expense of the ingredients. Make sure to use good wine and brandy and reduce sauce to about 1 C. I served it with French bread and roasted haricot verts and red onions. I would definitely make it again.

Excellent dish. I buy whole tenderloins and have them trimmed and cut. Used homemade beef stock instead of canned (ugh, shutter) and had a good source for fresh morel's. I teamed it with a Flaming Spinach Salad! Made Billie D's Chowder as the opener. Flavors all complimented one another. We will not even speak of the decadent dessert

Sorry, can't agree with previous raves. This one just didn't work for me. Tenderloin was $65, and 2+ ounces of dried mushrooms were $27 (nice, whole specimens). Beef came out fine. But the mushrooms were rubbery after soaking, and tasted a little sour? The sauce, despite using the soaking juice and being well reduced, came out thin and lacking in taste. I ended up having to thicken it with a little butter/flour and perk it up for flavor. Not what I had hoped for.

Liked this recipe a lot better than the tenderloin with merlot sauce. For a dinner party it is perfect since the sauce and stuffing can all be made prior to guests arriving. I deviated on the recipe by grilling the steaks,(requires a lot less attention). Any effort such as this warrants the best steak you can buy. I used aged angus beef, ($14.99/lb, Pavillions). The end result is fantastic. Not only is the taste superlative, but when your guests find the filling in the steak, you come off as a goumet chef. Easy, easy, easy. I just wish I could find fresh and/or bigger morels.

As with the cook in Georgia, I didn't cut my filets either. I also had begun preparing the dish and discovered I only had a red Burgundy - used 3/4 C. of the wine & increased broth to 3/4C. Result was FANTASTIC. My guests were blown away and very impressed.I served the filets with blanched whole green beans with balsamic vinegar & roasted new potatoes encrusted with Kosher salt.

Oh, my.....what an incredible sauce. We made this as part of a 7-course dinner for New Year's Eve. We had four enthusiastic cooks in the kitchen, so things got a little confused. (Or maybe it was the wine. I don't know.) I mistakenly started adding everything into the pan and found that I had skipped the stuffing recipe entirely, and started making the sauce with ALL the morels. As it turned out, it was magnificent. The steaks weren't stuffed, but boy was it fabulous! I'd recommend doing it this way intentionally, as you don't have to cut your gorgeous filets and it's easier to avoid overcooking them when they're whole. This is one impressive taste. Make it NOW.

I made this dish for New Year's Eve and it was a huge hit! It is easy to make and it got raves from my guests. Also, I combined dried porcini and dried morel mushrooms, which worked beautifully. This dish was served with creamed spinach and roasted garlic mashed potatos.

Absolutely delicious, impressive and not too difficult. I made the stuffing ahead and had the steaks filled and in the fridge a few hours before cooking. I also made the sauce ahead as it is reheated in the pan after cooking the steaks. Served with garlic mashed potatoes with potatoe crisp stuck in them. My guests said "it was the best meal they ever had".

Very good sauce. We served it with rice and the sauce made it excellent.

I used a single 5 lb. tenderloin and served it with roasted potatoes and carrots. Six adults and two kids finished off so fast, I'd have to say it was a compliment! Really good flavour from both the Morels and the herb rub. Next time I would cut the carrots thick, they tend to wilt in the oven.

I served this elegant dish for a New Year's Eve Dinner. Having received a beautiful gift of dried porcini mushrooms from Italy, I substituted them for the morels. Delicious and impressive!
