This was super easy and the recipe I think is really a guidline on quantities. I used sheep feta and fresh oregano and just layered it in a baking dish with tomatoes. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.

This was so simple and very good! French feta is less tangy, but richer. I used 4 seeded, diced roma tomatoes and a 7 oz. block of feta to stretch it out for a few more guests and accidently used 2 tsp. of dried oregano. It was devoured. Easy, pretty and delish!

Followed the recipe and used French Feta and dried oregano. I didn't want to put my baking dish in the broiler, so I baked it at 425-degrees until bubbly. This was the hit hors d'Oeuvre at our dinner party -- it was GONE in no time. Will absolutely make this again.

This was very good and so simple to make. I sliced the tomatoes very thin. Next time, I will add more tomatoes.

This recipe was very easy and quick to make. It was a hit! I used garlic feta instead of the french feta and it added great flacor. I would use a little less oregano than suggested in the recipe.

I made this for a weeknight dinner party. It is a great and simple recipe. I am making again tonight but will quarter tomatoes. It was difficult to eat last time.

Very simple. Great to smush onto bread. I really like feta and tomato fresh so this was a different twist. I used grape tomatoes b/c that is all I had and it was fine.

Your broiler's not working? Not to worry. I put this together for a party and left it on the kitchen table by the pita toasts, waiting for the oven to become available. I came back in ten minutes and it was just about gone. Seed and chop your tomatoes, use good olive oil and don't worry about melting it. They'll happily eat it cold.

Delicious and simple made with Bulgarian Feta (more like the sheep's milk feta actually served in greece, and stronger than domestic cow milk feta). it was delicious made with chopped grape tomatoes, but left something to be desired in the presentation. any ideas? maybe next time i'll serve it in phyllo cups.

The first couple of bites were fine, but as we continued to eat it, the saltiness was too much. Maybe more tomato, less feta? Also, you must eat it right away, throw out what you don't finish. It's not good if you microwave it to heat it up the next day, it becomes an oily gooey mess.

Outstanding and easy! We used dried spice and it was still a big hit. Served it right out of the baking dish with sliced, untoasted baguette. This would also be a good picnic dish, as it does not need to be served hot. Thanks!

Don't hesitate to use flavored feta such as herbed or peppered and I didn't use French and it was still delicious! Small grape tomatoes also work well. I did spread the oregano on before the oil to keep it moist while broiling. Great on toasted bread rubbed with garlic after browning or grilling.

This is one of my favorite recipes. It's easy but absolutely delicious. I always use French feta. I tried chopping the tomato but don't waste your time. It's far better just as is.

A very basic but delicious appetizer. Highly recommended.

Simple yet wonderful. And so easy to make!

The reason for using French feta, which does exist in a big way, is that it is usually less pungent in odor and flavor. For subtler tastes, go with French, but if you are a feta-holic, it shouldn't really make any real difference.

Made it during the Osars yesterday. My friends and I loved it!!! I used onion pita toasts.

It is to my belief that FETTA is a patented cheese and name attributed to Greece. A slight variation to the posted recepie was to add Fetta on top of the tomatoes as well.

I thought this recipe had a wonderful flavor. The next time I make it I will chop the tomatoes before putting them on the feta cheese, overlapping the tomatoes made it very difficult ot eat.

It was delicious and easy. French Feta is not difficult to find. Most grocery stores carry it.

please note that FETA cheese is a traditional GREEK product and unless another cheese was intended for the recipe, it will be difficult to find French 'feta'.
