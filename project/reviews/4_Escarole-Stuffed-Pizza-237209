I used frozen spinach, romano cheese, italian sausage, garlic and onion for the filling. It came out well and was reminiscent of something my Italian mom used to make years ago. Delicious!

The recipe was a good starting point but it needed a little more oomph. Made my own whole wheat pizza dough and used 2/3 for the bottom, 1/3 for the top. Used a bag of frozen spinach and italian shredded cheese, added salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, basil, and oregano. Otherwise it would've been overwhelmingly GREEN. I can see this becoming a standard dish.

This is AMAZING! I didn't have quite enough escarole, so I substituted 2 bunches of kale for a portion of the escarole. I also added caramelized onion, made whole-wheat pizza crust using the directions on my bag of whole wheat flour, and used a package of Sargento's Italian cheese & herb blend because I couldn't find any fontina. I assume you need to do an egg wash on the crust to get the pretty brown color to it, which I will try next time. It was FABTASTIC. I shared with our neighbors, who have consistently refused to eat leafy greens (they were our source of the escarole, which came in their coop share). They're not letting us have their greens anymore, because now THEY'RE making this pizza.

I too used purchased whole-wheat dough, and found that it required less oven time. The idea here is wonderful, and the dish turned out pretty delicious and attractive. However, being a lover of intensely seasoned food, I made a few additions. I sauteed a sliced onion with some red pepper flakes, then added a paste of fresh garlic, soaked raisins, and anchovies. I then added the escarole and simmered until the water was mostly evaporated. The raisins and anchovies gave the dish a subtle sweetness and richness, and I don't think it would have been as tasty otherwise.

What a great recipe! I used whole-wheat pizza crust and also added some pepper flakes. I baked the bottom crust about 7 minutes and the whole thing about 12 minutes, since my first attempt to bake the bottom crust for 9 minutes burned it. Overall, fabulous dish.

I agree that there's too much cheese called for here--it overwhelms the greens flavor. Use 2/3 as much, I'd say. Other than than, it's a surprisingly pretty and delicious dish, which I've also made with a mix of greens like spinach and chard. with equal success.

This recipe was excellent. I think you need a little more than 1/3 of the dough for the bottom crust, but everything worked out fine. I used mozzarella cheese and will only use 8 oz. next time. I'll also add some red pepper flakes because I like a little heat. Overall, this was delicious!

Loved this recipe - very easy. My bottom crust was a little small, but it didn't matter. Once I put the topping on, and put the top crust on and pulled it around, I smushed the whole thing down to go to the edges of the pan.

Very tasty, and easy if you have the pizza dough (I used Trader Joe's). In my opinion the recipe calls for too much cheese. I made it with slighty less and it was still too much; next time I"ll reduce it by about half.
