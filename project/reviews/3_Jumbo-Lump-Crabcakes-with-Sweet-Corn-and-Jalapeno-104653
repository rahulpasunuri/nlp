This is the best tasting crab hash I've had. As others have said here, the mix is far too wet to stick to form crab cakes - even made with rounds, the cakes fall apart. The seasoning level is excellent. The corn-jalapeno relish is a perfect accompaniment, and has very mild heat. We will definitely make this again, although I may add panko or other binder to get more of a solid cake.

After reading all the reviews, I believe, no one gets the concept of these crab cakes. They are supposed to be like a warm crab salad. I have been to Commander's Palace and these crab cakes are divine. Not traditional, but delicious.

I give two forks for the recipe's great flavor, and encourage others to use crumbs and egg to bind. Maybe Ti and Jamie left that part out of the instructions in error? I used less mustard, no capers and skipped the boiled egg.

Can I give a half fork? This recipe is a disaster. Too mustardy. Too salty (capers and salt). And nothing but MUSH. My wife put it together for me to cook when I got home. She's a little less experienced cook than I, and when I walked in I immediately saw that it had no binding or anything to absorb the liquids. Out of breadcrumbs, I cooked it anyway, and we had Crabcake Hash on toasted bagels. There are tons of good crabcake recipes. This is not one of them. Lived in Baltimore for 4 years so I've had a few good ones in my time.

I made this recipe as written & can honestly say that there is nothing about the finished product that even remotely resembles a crab CAKE! CRAB MUSH is more like it. With a proliferation of excellent recipes for crab cakes in the world, I see no reason to ever make this one again. I've used crab cake rings in the past, but found them to be cumbersome & annoying. So I cooked this concoction in a greased muffin pan (I've done so successfully in the past with other crab cake recipes) & still, they came out as mush. Thank heavens for Ritz crackers, which when crushed & added to the cooked, sloppy mess, held them together enough to resemble something 'crab cake-like'. You can imagine how much more work this created for me, right? I liked the seasonings however & I might hold onto this recipe for future experimentation, nothing more. As written, this recipe sucks.

As most other reviewers have stated, the flavor of these crabcakes are great, but they are messy. I've made the adjustments others have suggested, but they still fell apart when I tried to get them out of the pan. I followed the advice of the person who added breadcrumbs, but I neglected to add enough ( I only added one cup. I used panko for its milder flavor). If anyone should attempt to make these, definitely add the two cups of bread crumbs and cut back on the mustard and mayonnaise.

The flavor was great. I added a small amount of bread crumbs to hold the cakes together.

The flavor that these crab cakes have is fantastic. However, like a previous reviewer commented, they come out like a soupy mess - UNLESS you modified the recipe. I added two cups of breadcrumbs to bind them, and they came out fantastic.

I loved the recipe! I did adjust the mustard to two tablespoons as suggested by someone else. I also omitted the capers and added one beaten egg to help hold it together. I didn't have metal rings, so I made some from foil. We used the recipe for appetizers, so I made them small. Everyone loved the corn and jalepenos, too.

I wasted an expensive pound of good crabmeat on this recipe. They came out like a soupy mess. Nothing "cake" about them. If you had 3 times as much crab meat they might have worked. Ended up eating the mess and even it turned out over-seasoned. You couldn't even taste the crabmeat. I am very dissapointed.

Here is a variation on this theme: used Dijon mustard and Old Bay instead of Creole mustard/spices, combined jumbo lump crab meat with less expensive crab meat (made it bind better and hold its shape) and bread crumbs. Only half the sauce blended in. They were perfect, and didn't have the overwhelming flavor they had when I made them as the recipe calls for.

I would make this again. It was quite easy. I didn't have the rings, so I added bread crumbs and shaped them into patties. Also, I used canned crab meat and they tasted great. The only thing I would do differently is that I would use a little less mustard.

You know...I didn't even bother trying this recipe after reading these reviews. When Epicurious highlights recipes they should at least choose ones that deserve 4 forks. I go to this site for the best of the best. Thank goodness for reviews or else I would have made the same mistake as these other people have.

this recipe makes what I, as a native Marylander, regard as the critical mistake with so many crabcake recipes: the recipe adds too much, so much so it overpowers the taste of crab. A lot less mustard would help. the jalapeno, as used, was a nice addition I thought.

I make crabcakes all the time and really enjoyed this interesting variation. Try this with only two tablespoons of good creole mustard. I made very small (cocktail party) size crabcakes and rolled them into some crumbled saltine crackers before cooking. They were the hit of the party!

I've been eating at Commander's Palace for years and am please to say I never had a dish there as bad as this one. The Creole Mustard overpowers the (expensive) crabmeat and, no matter how hard you try, the crabcakes will not bind - they fall apart into a mess on your plate. SKIP THIS!

I would not make this again. It was even close to a crab cake.
