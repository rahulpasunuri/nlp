I love the texture but there is little flavor - I think it needs 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla or anise or something - a little bland.

Very good--I agree that my dough was not at all as moist as the recipe suggested, but it still worked out well. I might skip the sesame seeds next time and try the twists alone or with a little kosher salt.

These are very quick and easy, although my dough wasn't overly moist at all as the recipe stated. They look quite nice in a bread basket- I will definitely be making these again!
