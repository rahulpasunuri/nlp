I don't see an amt for the cantaloupe. Is it the same amt as for the honey dew? That would make the most sense. I haven't yet made it, but am looking forward to doing so.

I made this recipe almost exactly as stated. For the canteloupe I used half Port and half Cointreau. I only could get Midori in a $16 bottle and I do not think it was really worth the investment. Apricot brandy or whatever else you have that is fruit flavored and light colored, would have been just fine. The trouble with the recipe is the texture and the taste. There is not enough sugar and the melons give a wierd texture. Presentation-wise it was wonderful. I ended up chlling the two gelatines at least a half an hour before layering, holding the bowls in my lap in an ice bath while stirring constantly. Between layers 15 minutes in the fridge was fine. I would use the layering concept again but I would choose different flavors, maybe lemon and blueberry.

I made the canteloupe mousse with blueberry port and the honeydew mousse with muscat. I didn't use the ice bath. Instead, I put the melon, lemon juice, and sugar in the processor bowl then refridgerated it while prepping the gelatin. It came out quite lovely, except the yogurt didn't disperse nicely - left little lumps. No one noticed. It's delicious!

This was a light and refreshing fruit dessert. I only made the honeydew mousse however, and I chilled the fruit first, prior to pureeing it, which made it frothy w/o the need of an ice water bath. Also, I used water infused w/ mint rather than Midori(didn't have any), but I'll try that next time. Ymmmm!
