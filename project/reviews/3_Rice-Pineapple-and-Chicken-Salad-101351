I found this recipe while looking for a meal that included leftover chicken breasts and pineapple. Luckily, I also had limes, red bell pepper, and ginger. I sliced and warmed 2 chicken breasts and tossed them with the dressing mixture, rice, pineapple,etc. I liked the combination of pineapple and giner. The recipe is a decent way to clean the fridge, but I don't think I'd make from scratch.

I used 4 cups of cooked brown rice, elimated the bell pepper and followed the rest of the directions. It was great. I will make it again.

I used 4 cups of cooked short grain brown rice and cut out the green bell pepper because I do not like the taste. Overall this was refreshing, and I plan to make it again.

This is a very refreshing, tasty recipe. I disagree with the cook who cut back on the lime. I used what was called for because it is absorbed into the rice when it sits. No wonder she said it was not flavorfull. I used a little powdered ginger and garlic because I was short on both, and it was fine. We will make this again.

Crisp, cool and flavorful. I made this for a baby shower and received many complements and was asked for the recipe by several people. Just the right combination of flavors. Light and satisfying.

My cook's instinct said that there was too much garlic and lime juice called for in the recipe. So I used much less and used canned pinapple, with the juice, to sweeten it up. I sauteed the meat but I think it would be even better grilled. Unfortunately I didn't have any kiwi but I will definitely add that next time (maybe bump it up to three forks). Pretty good salad but nothing spectacular. Quick and easy to make too. Would be good for a BBQ or pot luck.

I haven't made this recipe and I'm not sure I will unless someone can help me with this problem. I make a similar salad, with shrimp or rice or chicken, fresh pineapple and macadamia nuts, and a sweet-ish but tangy mayonnaise dressing. But because pineapple has an enzyme that softens meats, I don't assemble it until the last minute. The rare leftovers are mushy. How does this survive a six-hour wait?

Excellant healthy salad. I dislike bell peppers so I used a banana pepper instead. Great salad for a warm sunny day.

I thought it was good because I like pineapple. But it didn't stand out to me. Just don't expect it to blow you away.

Healthy and filling at the same time. Added pineapple juice to the sauce which was tasty. My husband thought he didn't like mandarin oranges until last night. I served the dish warm over Minute rice. Yum!!!!!!

After reading all the glowing reviews I had high hopes for this dish but ended up being sorely disappointed. I used the suggestions of previous reviewers such as using sesame oil, adding spinach, and marinated the chicken for about an hour. The dressing was very sour tasting and seemed to have too much garlic. The whole dish tasted very strange and starchy tasting. I ended up adding honey to the dressing to make it more palatable but to no avail. It didn't seem to improve over time either. I think the recipe for caribbean rice salad found on this sight would work by just adding the chicken and pineapple. That dressing is delicious and seems to have the proper balance of flavors.

I think basmati rice tends to get mushy when mixed with dressing, better use long- or medium-grain. I reduced the amount of lime juice and garlic, and omitted the kiwi. The additions of sesame oil, chili sauce (I used 'toban djan')and spinach which other reviewer suggested were delicious, though I haven't tried beansprouts and cilantro (a little hard to come by here). I always make it both ways.

I made the salad one night and took it to work with me the next day for lunch. I found that it was a little bit mushy, but the flavor was very good. I also thought that the chicken was a little bit dry, but I didn't marinate it for the full 30 minutes. Overall, I thought it was a good recipe and I will most likely make it again. I also used mandarin oranges instead of kiwi...kiwi is a bit out of season.

This is one of my favorite rice salad recipes. I love to make this and have leftovers the next day. My husband is not too crazy about the citrus flavor. You can easily replace kiwi with mandarin oranges.

well, I have no idea why epicurious suggests serving _bread_ with this starchy salad, but I love the flavors in it, and will serve it again as a quick hot-weather weeknight dish or as a sidedish at picnics. Some substitutions and additions: use sesame oil instead of vegetable, add chinese chili sauce to both the marinade and the dressing, use the full amount of the dressing but mix ahead of time and then strain right before adding to the salad (cuts down on the strength of the garlic while still giving you the right amount of liquid), use sushi rice instead of basmati, add half a cup or more of cleaned bean sprouts and half a head of cleaned shredded spinach with the pepper (I used green but red would be nicer for color) and scallions, add most of one bunch chopped fresh cilantro to the marinade and as a garnish, omit the kiwi and use 1 can of pineapple per 1 recipe salad made w/2 cups of rice. Very pleasant and quick to make, and tastes great the next day.

I used pre-grilled chicken strips (Louis Rich) and though I'm sure the marinated chicken would have been better it still tasted great and was so quick to make and clean-up. (Especially if you have a rice cooker.) After reading the other reviews, I only made 1/2 the dressing and it was plenty. This is a very summery meal, good for a hot day.

This was a great recipe, but next time I make it I will do the following: * Grill the chicken on the outdoor grill instead of in a pan * Cut down on the amount of the dressing I put on the salad...it was too strong and overpowering. I mixed the leftover salad with some more plain rice, and it was much better. This is GREAT the next day, cold. I took it for lunch, mixed with some of the plain rice to cut down on the strong dressing taste, and it was awesome! It would also be good as a "wrapper."

This was a refreshing, light, yet flavorful salad. Great in the summer time.

We had a change in weather for the cold, so I changed a few things, left out the kiwi and made it a hot chicken dish. My children loved it, especially the marinated chicken. Can't wait to try it cold when it warms up!
