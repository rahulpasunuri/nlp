This was a good salad, and I would make it again, but wouldn't call it "delicious". Thus the 2 fork rating. We felt there was way too much olive oil, so we cut it down to a half a cup.

Used Arugula or mixed greens. Red Leaf lettuce is acceptable if it is to your taste. Used halved red grapes, blue cheese, toasted peacans & raspberry vinaigrette. Very good!

Beautiful, different, and full of flavor. Used balsamic vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar--only because that is what we had in the pantry. A definite keeper.
