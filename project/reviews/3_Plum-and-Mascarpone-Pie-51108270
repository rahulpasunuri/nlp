Great recipe. I used sour cream ins tread of creme fraiche and it worked fine, though I used higher percentage of marscapone and less cream overall. I didn't add the honey or all the sugar as I don't like things too sweet The plum glaze was so delicious I used the extra over yoghurt Though it's several steps its easy and impressed all my guests

Well worth the effort. The plums should be roasted only until the skin begins to break, about 30 minutes. This time will depend on how ripe the plums are. It works better with less ripe plums.

I made this today but used peaches and we loved it. I've long been a fan of a mascarpone cheese layer on top of crust when making fruit pies; especially a fresh strawberry version. I started the habit to keep the fruit juice from making the crust soggy but I continue it because it just tastes so good!

I'm making this for the third time today. Have served it twice for company - to raves each time. The flavors are a great blend. It takes a bit of time to create, so I always start a day ahead, roasting the plums. Make sure not to over bake them or you will have a messy looking pie - still tasty, however. It's a great pie technique that could probably be repeated with other fruit.

This recipe was a waste of ingredients. Most of the plums basically melted when I roasted them. The liquid turned to a rubber consistancy when I reduced it. I ended up roasting peaches to substitute for the plums as I could not salvage them. The mascapone/creme fraiche part of the pie was just OK but not worth the effort and cost. Also was a waste of a vanilla bean.
