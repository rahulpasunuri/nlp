Hubs said "great" so I will certainly make again. Used panko crumbs, left out dill (don't like). Took several minutes longer in my oven to brown. MUST be served with tartar sauce in our opinion; used tartar sauce from "Spicy Catfish Tenders with Cajun Tartar Sauce", this website,but left out the hot stuff. I certainly wouldn't hesitate to cook these stovetop either in some butter & olive oil.

really good, but could use a little more spice - especially fine as a healthy alternative to fried fish. I used panko instead of regular breadcrumbs and they weren't super crispy, but crispy enough.

Delicious. I added the cayenne to the butter mixture and used panko. Heating the pans is critical to the golden brown look.

Wow. This was good. I was distracted by unexpected company while cooking this, so I accidentally added the cayenne to the butter mixture instead of the breadcrumbs. I think this recipe would have been lacking had I added it to the breading. The mix of the breadcrumbs, the spice (seriously, try adding to the wet mix for a more intense heat) and the homemade tartar (just Miracle Whip, sweet relish, and lemon juice) made this heavenly. My only change would be to use panko instead of regular bread crumbs. I didn't find this as crispy as other reviewers did.

This recipe is great! I have made it with catfish and tilapia and like other reviewers, I use panko breadcrumbs. I have shared it with co-workers and they all love it too! If I am feeling very ambitious, I make some homemade tartar sauce to go with it.

I used halibut for this (can't get good catfish in the NW), and added more cayenne. It was really delicious. The fish came out creamy and the breading adhered nicely.

Very very good! Getting 13 and 15 year olds to eat fish is normally a challenge but not with this receipe - all gone. The only change was to use panko breadcrumbs per several earlier reviews.

I've made this several times with tilapia fillets. Very good for the minimal effort required. I simplify this recipe further by using whole fillets.

Very tasty. I used panko for the breadcrumbs and tilapia for the fish. Cutting into strips takes a little more time, but it gives you more crispy goodness on the fish. I needed almost double the amount of breadcrumbs. The amount of cayenne was perfect heatwise, but it seemed to dominate the dill. I will cut it back just a bit next time.

I liked this recipe, loved the flavor and it was quick & easy. Next time I will probably change a few things, cutting into "sticks", I didn't really see the point unless that's the only way your kids will eat 'em, I will do the whole filet next time. Also, my breading came out a little soggy, my fault, all I had was some rye bread that was a little stale, but definitely not dry enough. Think I'll try the suggestion to use panko next time, or a baguette.

This was a great recipe. We changed it a little. When I was a kid growing up in Cincinnati, we used to make our fish with potato chips instead of bread crumbs. We would use normal salty chips smashed in the bag. For this recipe, we used a combination of salt & vinegar chips and some jalapeno chips (its what we had open). It was crunchy and fantastic. Smash them up and give it a try and I know you will love it.

I don't bother to cut the fish in strips. I dip the whole fillet in the mixture and bake. Saves time and still tastes the same. Try using Panko for the bread crumbs.

Love, love, love this recipe when made with tilapia and fresh toasted bread crumbs (from an old baguette run through the food processor or my local whole foods). I get the big pack of tilapia from Costco and then make a double or triple recipe. If you coat the fish and then freeze it uncooked, the butter will protect the fish. Then you just bake it straight from the freezer when you need a quick meal. Great.

My whole family loved it. This is perfect for kids. To improve upon my first crack at this recipe...next time I would use less butter and would choose a fish other than sole.

I don't understand barrywe's complaint below. This fish is great! Between the lemon juice, dijon, dill, and cayenne, it's VERY flavorful. I make this all the time with tilapia (perfect fish for this recipe, I much prefer it to catfish and other white fishes are too bland or fall apart too easily) and cut into strips so you get a nice coating to fish ratio. I always use bread crumbs made from toasted french bread instead of the canned powdery kind. It makes all the difference.

Not really a whole lot going on on this one. Baked sure, but at what price (that'd be flavor).

This was a big hit! I used tilapia, and I added a little more cayenne pepper (since I like things a little spicy), and it was great!

I loved this recipe! I like heat though - others thought it was a bit much. Defintely no need for a sauce on the side - they stand alone nicely with a nice green salad.

Easy to be sure but next time I'll be creating my own seasoning. Found this to be rather underwhelming.

Great recipe for the whole family. I've made this recipe at least half a dozen times and my kids always polish off as much fish as I make! And this is a simple recipe too. Great for weeknights.

This was an easy way to make fresh fish for two picky children...it was also spicy enough for my husband not to find it bland. I used cod and it came out great. Will try it with another fish soon. My five year old daughter shouted "five forks!" after the first bite.

I make this recipe often. It's so easy and tasty. Even my fussy daughter loves it and it's just spicy enough for both of us. You don't even need tartar sauce for flavor. A great weeknight meal.

I've done this with Talapia and Halibut, too. Excellent on all. Easy and quick for a weeknight dinner.

For an informal meal, this is great. Very easy to prepare and it has a great flavor.

This is an easy way to cook fish. I used thick Dory fillets and coated the fish with rice crumbs as I am allergic to wheat products. Other then that I followed the recipe exactly and I thought it turned out good. This is not a "gourmet" recipe just something fast and simple.

Very good, I used cod instead of catfish. My husband loved it. Will make again.

Yes, another keeper. It has been a beautiful spring day--came in and whipped this up for a supper made in 15 min. total cooking and preparing. Will make this on busy stressed week nights. Also love the no grease to clean or eat.

I used grouper fillets and it was fabulous. I also sprinkled extra cayenne over the fish because I love hot, hot food. I served it with the Chorizo Spanish Rice recipe. I omitted the Chorizo. Excellent dinner!

Did not care for this at all. The coating was too heavy and sort of soggy. Would not make again.

Delicious, quick recipe. I used dried dill and shook the fish in the butter and bread crumbs in gallon bags. My 13 year old loved it. And I liked not having grease splatter all over to clean.

I'd give it four forks for the "Fantastic/Easy Weeknight Cuisine" category, if there was one on this site. I loved it; my husband loved it; my two children, in the manner common to many Pacific NW-ers, turn up their noses at any fish that is not "free range" (as my son put it; I think he means wild as opposed to farmed) salmon, but the first time I made it they declared "Let's have it again next week!" After my husband picked me up off the floor I followed their request and have since made this dish several times, trying slight variations (different fish, fresh vs. dried dill). Catfish is the hands-down favorite, and fresh dill a must. I use less butter -- approx. 4T, brushing it on the fish instead of dipping the filets in it -- otherwise, don't change a thing.
