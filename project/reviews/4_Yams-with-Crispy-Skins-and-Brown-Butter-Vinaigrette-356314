Great flavors, way more interesting than your standard sweet potatoes! Rather than deep-frying, I just brushed the skins with olive oil and popped them in for about 30 minutes when I reheated the yams. That added crisp is critical!!

Husband was dubious about making the skins, but boy, were we glad when he did! 5 year old couldn't get enough. Vinaigarette was astounding! New favorite way to make yams.

Wow! Yams etc are pretty awesome by themselves, but this was different. I didn't garlic (I know..shame) but it was great, and since I was trying something so new I figured I'd go ahead and do the crispy skins(obviously had them, and that part took about 10 more minutes.

You will not be disappointed, flavor explosion. I skipped the frying of the skins, it could only add to the texture, but everyone loved it without, so imagine with.

The whole family loved it and they don't usually like yams. The fried skins weren't necessary, but they definitely add to the flavor and presentation.

This is one of the most unique and delicious recipes I have made from this website. I made it as part of a birthday dinner for my mom last weekend and the results were amazing. Sweet potatoes, savory sauce, crispy skins (which, by the way, make this recipe) and you cannot go wrong. Absolutely delicious and we are actually considering having this instead of the traditional praline sweet potatoes at Thanksgiving from now on. Well, maybe not instead of, but in addition to. We love our traditions, but this new recipe is absolutely spectacular and needs to be made again. With the crispy skins! Yum, yum, yum...

The vinaigrette for this dish is really what makes this yam dish fabulous. I think that the time involved in the crispy skins is a bit much for a holiday dinner menu item since there is usually alot of other things going on at the same time. I will only make this again if I can figure out a better (faster, less labor intensive) way to make it.

destined to be a new holiday classic at my house, everyone loved it. i do agree with using half the butter and i did not use salt on the skins

I wanted to add to my previous review that I, too, had way to much of the dressing. Half would be plenty so save the butter for your rolls!

This was a good side dish. The brown butter dressing was a nice surprise for anyone used to the usual sweet toppings for yams. I didn't do the crispy skins but with that I had.

I made this twice and had a request to make it again for Christmas. Everyone especially loved the crispy skins. I cut the butter in half because the first time I made it, I thought it was too much butter. I will definitely make it again.

I tried this for just the 2 of us before making for a group. It was good not too sweet but watch out for the crispy skins and the salt. I think I overdid salting the skins which made the dish too salty. I also reduced the recipe down which might have altered the flavor if I did not get the proportions correct.

People went crazy for these yams. Don't bother frying the skins. This was fabulous with just the sliced yams and the buttery vinaigrette. I made an extra half-portion of the vinaigrette, fearing it would be skimpy on the sauce if I didn't, but I really don't think it was necessary and I won't bother with the extra amount next time. Make this.

Loved this recipe - will definitely use again next Thanksgiving. Didn't fry the skins though, too much work at the final hour, and with all the butter used for the delicious sauce, it would have been overkill!

very good but-- i didn't measure carefully w/ the vinaigrette; probably you should (ended up really intense, too much vinegar) the potato skins go quickly from not fried to burnt, so watch close and take them out before they're crispy (they'll crisp up on the paper towel). also did this with a whole bunch of different varieties of yams (thanks norcal produce!) turned out really pretty with purple, white, orange, yellow in the dish.
