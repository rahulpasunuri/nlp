This was a wonderful new take on pasta - we loved it! My only addition to the recipe was to add 2 cloves of garlic. Other than that I thought all of the flavors blended surprisingly well. I used a potato masher to crush the tomatoes and it worked like a charm.

I didn't give this a fork rating because I make significant changes to the original. I despise goat cheese so I use feta for a similar consistency and pungency. I also never have marjoram on hand, so I replace with oregano. Dont substitute grape tomatoes for the cherrygrape tomatoes arent as juicy and will not meld into a saucy consistency the way good cherry tomatoes do. One other important thing: a good quality Italian sausage makes all the difference. I've made this using average sausage and the difference in taste was noticeable.

I made using Rotini. I loved the sauce with the goat cheese. I followed recipe exact other than using rotini. I would use a smaller pasta next time, maybe a bow-tie pasta. I love the taste of the tomatoes, made it fresh even though you had to deal with the skins. I thought this recipe would not heat up well but it did, I just had some this morning.

The end result was pretty tasty and VERY rich, but smashing hot tomatoes with a fork caused a lot of splattering and I burned myself. It was not worth the injury ;)

Delicious! My whole family devoured it! Not fancy enough for a dinner party, but definitely perfect for a Mom's Club dinner with kids or a casual family/relatives gathering.

Loved it. Made it exactly as the recipe stated except I had mostacolli on hand and used that instead of the castellane. This will be a staple in our house.

Marjoram and goat cheese gave the meal a different twist from traditional pasta oragano and basil . This meal may make my list of favorites and find itself in a seasonal line up of fall and winter meals. Easy and quick to make.

My favorite use of summer tomatoes. As other readers have mentioned, basil works fine in a pinch. Also can sub regular tomatoes for 1/2 the cherrys. Hard to go wrong. I think I will make it again tonight...

I substituted chipotle sausage instead of the spicy italian sausage for a smoky spicy flavor and canned tomatoes for the cherry tomatoes. The sauce was deliciously creamy and spicy. A keeper.

Since discovered, my family and I have enjoyed this recipe at least weekly! The goat cheese creates a wonderfully creamy sauce. Have added fresh basil leaves and/or arugula at the last. In a pinch, have used whole canned plum tomatoes--not as fresh-tasting as the mashed cherry tomatoes, but still delicious. I look forward to making this with tomatoes from the summer garden.

I used grape tomatoes instead of cherry, and did not crush them, as suggested in the recipe. It just looks prettier. Easy to make.
