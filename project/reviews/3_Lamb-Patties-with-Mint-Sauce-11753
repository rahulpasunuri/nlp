While I did not use the lamb pattie because I have my own recipe I like best, I DID make the mint sauce and it is pure heaven! I am reviewing only on the mint sauce. I heated the sauce through, let it steep for 20 minutes and then strained it, served it room temp as a dipping sauce. I am so happy I found this sauce recipe, will use it often often often.

I made just the sauce last night to serve with grilled lamb loin chops and it was very good. My only substitution was lime juice (because I have a tree). Will definitely make this again.

Since 1982 this has been a favorite. Fast and flavorful. Rice and carrots are great with the sauce. I lightly saute a small-to-medium size, diced carrot in butter; add 1/2 c rice and 1-1/3 c water.

I definitely will not make this again. My husband thought it was just OK and I thought it tasted like a sausage. I took one bite and didn't have any meat for dinner.

I made this to accompany left-over (but not quite enough) rack of lamb. I made a few changes to the recipe which helped in reaching three forks. To the sauce I added more garlic, anchovey paste, soy and mint, then heated and thickened it slightly with arrowroot. To the meat I added chopped parsley and mint, cumin, salt and pepper. Lessened amount of bread crumbs. Made patties on charcoal grill and brushed on sauce when almost done (medium rare). Served with sauteed asparagus, mushrooms and tabooli salad. Very tasty!

As suggested by a reviewer I added a dash of cloves, cardamon and allspice. They were wonderful. I just e-mailed the recipe to my daughter.

I did not use either the egg or bread and it did not need ikt because it held together beautifully. I also added allspice,clovesand cardamon to the lamb mixture and the three adults (no children) loved it.
