Made this recipe (followed exactly) to accompany a few other asian inspired dishes for a small family get together. The ribs were falling off the bone delicious. All diners wanted more. I can't wait to make them again!!!

Pretty good. I had 4 pounds of ribs, cut them up and sprinkled with an asian spice rub. I recommend doing that WELL in advance to let the flavors permeate the meat. I didn't have whole ginger on hand so I used bottled minced ginger. I also used Tamari in place of the dark soy sauce. All in all, VERY tender, good flavor, but once again, par-boiling the meat doesn't induce much flavor IN the meat, just the sauce on top. Next time I'll stick with my traditional way of cooking the ribs: keep them whole, put them on a rack over a sheet pan, pour a bottle of cola or beer in the bottom, cover tightly with foil and bake at 350 for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. THEN cut apart and put in the sauce in a pan OR put them on the grill, brush with the sauce, then cut apart and serve.

I loved these! 8 ribs were perfect for me and my honey; I served them alongside ramen with veggies. Perfect! One note: even though I kept the flame very low, and even though I started off with double the ketchup and two tbsp of soy paste, I still needed to ad about 1 whole cup of water while cooking to keep everything liquidated and not stuck to the bottom of the pot. Garnished with sesame seeds! tasty!

My wife and I loved these ribs! I followed the recipe exactly and the ribs fell off the bone after filling our house with a wonderful aroma while they simmered. They are great left-over straight out of the fridge or warmed up in the oven.

I tried this recipe using 2 1/2 lbs. of beef short ribs instead of pork spareribs. It was very good and my family enjoyed it!

I followed the recipe exactly as it was written. I always do the first time. It was delicious, but I found it a little sweet. The next time I try it, I'll add just a bit more Asian vinegar and cut back on the sugar a tad.. It should kick it up a notch!! If anyone likes things on the sweet side, the recipe is perfect as is. Delicious. After I've "perfected" it, I'll be sure to serve it to my guests. Well done, Epi-C

Great recipe - the 'do ahead' bit is a big bonus. I used just over 2 pounds (1.2 kilo) of pork 'straps' - sort of ribs without bones - cut into bite-sized pieces (skin taken off), as part of a small banquet style lunch. I followed the recipe pretty well 'as is', however, with slightly less sugar, and an extra Tablespoon Ketchup. My guests gobbled the food down pronto - and asked for the recipe! Well done, Epicurious.
