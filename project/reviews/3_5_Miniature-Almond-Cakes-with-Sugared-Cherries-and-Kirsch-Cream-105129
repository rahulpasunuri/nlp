I'm not sure what happened, but I followed the recipe exactly and the cakes turned out eggy and rubbery and fell to 1/2 of their size after coming out of the oven. They raised nicely in the oven and I left them in till they were golden and a toothpick came out clean. They were too rubbery to be usable at all.

I made half a recipe to test and see how they came out before making for any guests - I loved the cakes and will definitely make again. They are indeed moist and rich with a wonderful texture. As well, I found them very simple to make, even cutting them was fairly simple and effortless. However, the cakes are quite sweet on their own, and as some other reviews have said, I think that the sugar on the cherries, while it looks wonderful, may be too much sugar with the already sweet cakes (and my cherries were quite tart). In any case, I will make again for sure for a party. As well, I love the cake so much ( and I do not really like traditional white cakes, etc) that I am going to try to use the cake recipe for other uses as well, like making a large layer cake, with the cream and fruit in between the almond layers.

This cake is one that brings about rave reviews. It presents beautifully and is quite elegant on any table. I made 200 of these for a fundraising event at my son's school. People wanted to know what bakery they came from.

I used the cake part of this recipe to make a trifle and it was wonderful. In addition to the cake, I used vanilla pudding, whipped cream, and a raspberry sauce. Everyone wants the recipe!

Excellent. Dip the cutter into water between cutting out each mini cake and they won't stick to the cutter (although they will stick to your finger!).

This was very good and easy to do. I wasn't sure I would have enough cakes for the recipe cooked in a 9 inch pan, so I doubled it and made it in a 9x12 pan instead. I made about 24 little cakes. The cakes seemed dense but very moist and it worked. I don't know if the kirsch is really necessary, the flavor was subtle. I could have eaten 4-5 of these!

This is such a great recipe. I have used the cake as the base for a myriad of desserts. IT also works nice as a light layer cake if you double the recipe. A good quality kirsch is definitely needed for the best flavor of the cream. Some are too medicinal tasting.

I made these for my dessert table for my 27th birthday party, they were all gone, everybody keeps asking me to make more for every party I have

This is very yummy!! I love almonds, and this has a beautiful though subtle almond flavour. Used blueberries instead of cherries, was an elegant dessert. Will make this often.

I have made this recipe several times and everyone LOVES it! The combination of cherry and almond flavors is classic and the presentation of little round cakes topped with round cherries make this dessert look like it came right out of a magazine. Through trial and error I have found that fresh cherries are a must - the tartness is needed for balance. My guests found the sugaring to be too sweet. I have had the best luck with making the cherries sticky with simple syrup (let dry) and then dusting with confectioners' sugar right before serving. Leaving the stems on the pitted cherries looks super-cute but I have found it awkward for guests to have to pull stems out of their mouths, I say don't bother. Definitely invest in a cherry pitter or wear rubber gloves if you are making these for a party. I had purple fingers when I made this the day of a wedding shower. In all this is one of my favorite recipes on Epicurious.

This was AMAZING!!! I made the cake in the morning and whipped the cream right before my guests arrived and kept it in the fridge until it was time to assemble the cakes and serve. I used fresh raspberries and blueberries instead of the cherries and used a diamond shaped cookie cutter. They looked beautiful and all guests requested seconds. A keeper!!!!

These turned out very nice. I did not find the flavor of the Kirsch cream to be as good as I had hoped, I may have used a cheap kirsch...? The almond cakes were very flavorful. The presentation was really good, especially if you are looking for something sweet to serve at a cocktail party. I also pitted the cherries.

This is a gREAT recIpe! Nothing went wrong even though i made a recipie and a half. I didnt know what powdered egg whites were, so i just decided to dip the cherries in chocolate and sprinkle with some white sugar crystals and it was REAllY good! Im gonna make this again sometime.

i loved this recipe. it's by far one of the most elegant and simple recipes i've come across. the beautifully almond-nuanced cake is incredibly delicious. i don't know if being from california has anything to do w/it, but the cherries i used were incredibly sweet and i felt that the sugar coating was too much. i think i'll skip the sugar next time. and i'll probably try w/other kinds of fruit, including raspberries and strawberries.

We coated the cherries by putting the sugar in a paper bag and dropping each cherry in the bag, one at a time, shaking gently to coat with sugar. This dessert is very pretty and our guests were very impressed. We involved them in the last-minute assembly and everyone had a great time.

These were delightful. Very pretty arranged on a silver tray. A few prep hints: My son figured out how to make a small "x" in bottom of cherry and use a small paper-clip to pull out the pit of the cherry without damaging the top and stem of the cherry..I didn't want to have to warn/worry about guests biting into pits. Second.. it takes a lot of sugar to get the frosted look on the cherries. The egg-white wash absorbed the first and second sugar applications. After several different attempts, we found it easiest to dip the cherries in the wash, let dry briefly on rack, them sprinkle sugar over the cherries on the rack rather than trying to do each individually with a spoon as the directions indicate.
