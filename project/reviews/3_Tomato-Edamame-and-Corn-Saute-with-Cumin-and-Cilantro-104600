A beautiful mix of colors and textures and good for you too. A definite keeper. I used frozen pre-shelled edamame.

I thought this was a great new way to prepare edamame. I substituted a can of Rotel tomatoes for the regular canned tomatoes, chicken broth for the vegetable broth, and fresh cut canned corn for the frozen. I thought this made a tasty side dish to any grilled meat or mexican dish.

I increased the amount of cumin and garlic and didn't find it bland at all! It was a great way to use up some summer produce, I used 3 large ripe tomatoes instead of canned. It was delicious on top of rice.

Bland. That's all I can say for this recipe. Maybe with a lot of modifying it would be better.

My husband and I really liked this dish and it was very easy to prepare. We added a few fresh tomatoes and used fresh corn since they are both in season.

A light and refreshing summer side. Good with grilled chicken or lamb chops. Will do again.

Even though I upped the spices quite a bit I still found this to be very bland.
