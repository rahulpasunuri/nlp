Salad was a big hit using leftover grilled salmon and subbing asparagus for green beans. I used the tricolor fingerling potatoes which were very pretty as well as delicious. I did not double the dressing as I think most salads are overdressed. Thought the amount was perfect.

Used leftover grilled wild sockeye salmon and was excellent. Thank you for advise on doubling the dressing as very needed. I also doubled the eggs, decreased in half the anchovy. Did not have arugula, so used butter lettuce and baby greens. Next time will use baby arugula. Capers and fresh ground pepper to finish. I placed everything is rows for a lovely presentation. Everyone raved over the salad.

I thought this was a tasty recipe. I used mixed baby romaine instead of arugula. I doubled the eggs and added capers to the finished salad, which always contributes a wonderful flavor in my opinion. I minced whole anchovies instead of paste which I found to be very flavorful but not too salty or overpowering. I ate my salmon separately and enjoyed this salad more as a side dish. I will add salt and pepper to taste next time to improve depth of flavor and some sliced kalamata olives as well.

Loved this salad. Fresh, healthy, delicious. Next time, I'll definitely double the dressing amount and a little salt and pepper makes a big difference. I didn't have green beans and substituted asparagus which made the dish heartier but still delish.

This salad was pretty good however, I thought the dressing was a bit heavy on the anchovy paste side. I also added a pinch of kosher salt and fresh gound pepper to the dresssing; overall, salmon was excellent and I would grill again but probably eat it solo.

delicious--can be made incrementally and then assembled. It's delicious, nutritious and gorgeous on the plate. I've made this at least 14 times and more times to come

Very tasty. Like others, I doubled the dressing recipe and marinated beans and potatoes. I also added whole kalamata olives and left out the arugula. The advantage of leaving out the arugula is that the salad will keep better to make great leftover meals. Next time I'll double the whole recipe with this in mind.

I really enjoyed this salad. I added some baby greens and used arugula as well. I doubled the dressing as I made a huge salad...very yummy! My favorite salmon recipe to date!

Oh, yum. I followed the previous reviewer's suggestion and marinated the green beans and potatoes and doubled the amount of dressing. I left out the greens altogether and the salad was perfectly fine. I recommend using fresh, local produce and serving with a crisp glass of chardonnay for a hearty summer supper.

Terrific salad! I doubled the black olive vinaigrette which is definitely needed. Would have marinated the green beans with the potatoes. The french styled greens were great. Doubled the amount of eggs. Used red leafy lettuce instead of arugula. Should have used the arugula.
