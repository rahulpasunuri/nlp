Okay fellow cooks; If our tried and true experts at Bon Appetit ask to separate the potatoes and carrots it is for a reason we apprentices must trust. I made this dish just percisely and it was beautiful. The art is to maintain the distinct carrot taste as it is later blended with the starch. "Melding" is not an option and merely muddies this unique version of mashed potatoes with a stewlike flavor. No thank you. If you are looking for shortcuts at the sacrifice of flavor do not subscribe/visit gourmet magazines/websites!

I prefer keeping the carrots and potatoes separate so the potatoes don't take on the carrot taste. - I like the different bursts of flavor, altho some may like the melded flavor instead. I also throw unpeeled garlic cloves in the oven while making salad croutons, and add the roasted garlic to the mashed potatoes. If fat is a problem, try fat free sour cream from Land O'Lakes instead of butter! Makes thick, creamy mashed potatoes.

I have to agree with some of the other cooks. I, too, cook the potatoes and carrots in the same pot, along with a garlic glove (why dirty another pot?) I use hot milk, butter, salt and pepper to taste, and mash together leaving some wonderful lumps. Delicious!

Overcomplication of a good thing. This was a dish from my childhood when we ran low on everytging and had to stretch the basics. Simple and outstanding with nothing but milk and margarine. We cooked the vegetables together in as little water as possible to meld the flavors.

In Holland, traditonally, onions are added to this recipe. Use the same amount of onions (chopped) as carrots and cook them with the carrots.

Quite good. I used light cream instead and it was still great. I always throw a few peeled cloves of garlic in with the potatoes while they cook. The addition of carrots adds a special touch to regular mashed potatoes!! We love it in my house.
