I thought this was great and very simple to make. I had ground almond meal on hand so I just guessed at how much would equal 1/4 cup almonds (2 Tbsp?) and added that to the flour. Saved a step there. I also realized at the last minute that I didn't have a lemon so I skipped the lemon peel, but other than that I followed the directions as is. Easy, not-too-fancy and delicious dessert!

I have made the pineapple several times and I just love it. When I don't have juice on han, I use water with equally delicious results. I don't serve it with the cake, though, as I think it's wonderful by itself. I have tried the cake twice and, unlike most reviewers, I thought it was good. It's nothing fancy, just a homey dessert you would bake on a lazy Sunday afternoon. It's a little too sweet for my taste, so I try to use 3/4 cup of sugar instead of a whole cup, but I love the golden-brown crust, the crunch from the almonds, and the lemon/almond flavor. I would not recommend serving it with the pineapple but with a little citrus compote instead.

I'm actually surprised by the lack of enthusiasm in the reviews. Fortunately I saw the recipe in the Bon Appetit magazine ... otherwise after reading this I never would have made it. I made it for company and everyone loved it! It's a warm, comforting dessert for the cool fall weather and was absolutely delicious! Not to mention very easy to make! I'll definitely make this again.

Love the cake. Love the pineapple. Don't necessarily need to have them together though. I thought the cake w/just the whipped cream was great w/o the pineapple. I served the cake another time w/blackberry darjeeling sorbet, they went together beautifully.

This receipe did take some patience. The first time the cake fell but tried again and it was successful after leaving it in the oven for at least 10 minutes longer than suggested. The pineapple roasted fine-no burning but I was deligient about timing,turning it every 20 minutes and basting. Worth the work but you must not be in a hurry.

I love the idea of roasted or grilled fruit, and this was good, but the time spent was not worth the so-so results. If anything, skip the cake and serve the pineapple with rum cream sauce. I had no problems with the cake at all, but I did have trouble keeping the pineapple from burning-required alot of attention to the oven.

Made this late one night for my daughter's birthday the next day. The center of the cake fell. Thinking I had done something wrong, I got up early the next day and made it again. Same results! The pineapple was delicious. The cake actually tasted good, but I probably won't try it again.

Good cake, not much on the cream sauce though, i tried some soft french vanilla ice cream and liked it better. Good recipe.

The reviews are mixed because only 2 say they cooked it and only one of them followed the recipe. It does not call for baking powder or baking soda, because it is a dense moist cake, like a pound cake. It call for more sugar than flour because the almonds replace part of the flour.

Why are they pushing this as Recipe of the Day on Yahoo when the reviews are so mixed and there are questions about the recipe's accuracy?

I made only the cake, using two small loaf pans. I decided to add some vanilla extract in addition to the almond extra. Also added the juice of an orange and some cinammon to spice it up and add flavor. It came out quite good and was very moist. Easy to make and was great as a breakfast cake with tea.

One thing wrong with this recipe is that there is more sugar than flour. Must be a misprint.

I admit I didn't make this recipe. Just from the face of it, you can see that it's missing the baking powder (for the person who said it didn't rise well). I wouldn't make it as written. Maybe these recipes should be examined more closely??

The cake had good flavor but didn't rise well for me. The fruit and cream combo were delicious. I will make this again with my own almond pound cake in place of this cake.
