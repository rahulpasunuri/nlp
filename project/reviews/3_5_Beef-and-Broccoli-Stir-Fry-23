We enjoyed this very much. Like other reviewers, I didn't marinade for 4 hours (instead, I nuked meat with sauce on very low power for 4min, tossing occasionally), and felt the recipe could use another half-batch of sauce - however, the man disagreed, and I noticed the flavor deepened by the end of my meal, so I think skipping the longer marinade is the issue. I replaced the snow peas with chunky-sliced baby carrots cooked 2-3min in boiling water; steamed the broccoli for ONLY 3-4min using same water. Without my steamer basket I would probably microwave until bright-green but still firm, not boil. We used Fry's vegan wok strips; I think they soaked up the sauce more readily and fully than real meat would.

Great, simple stir-fry that really hits the spot. I recommend simply heating the broccoli in the microwave for one minute instead of boiling- easier and avoids soggy vegetables. If you prefer spice, you might want to add some heat as you prefer although I personally liked the mild flavor.

I thought this was a good basic recipe, too. I didn't bother marinating for four hours, though. I marinated the beef for about an hour on the counter because I think beef cooks better after being brought to room temperature first. Because I was making only one serving, I cut way back on the meat and veggie portions, but made the sauce as written after reading the reviews. I found it to be just enough for one serving over rice. It's an easy, flexible recipe and I'd make it again.

I can see why this would be acceptable to a 3-year-old, as one reviewer noted, because it is terribly bland. I doctored it with more soy, Chinese rice wine, hoisin sauce, chili garlic sauce, and it was still only passable. This has no resemblance to authentic Chinese food.

A good base recipe. I also doubled the sauce and used rice cooking wine instead of Sherry. I put about 1/2 of the ginger and garlic in the marinade and reserved the rest to saute after cooking the meat and before adding the rest of the veggies. I didn't have any pea pods or peppers, so I added carrots and mushrooms, with a good result. Served over brown rice. My 3 year old ate it up!

To add, I substituted green cabbabe for the snow peas and rice wine for the sherry. Terrific results.

I only marinated my beef for 30 minutes and it still came out delicious. Slice your meat thin. Also, do not over cook the broccoli in the boiling water. Mine came out mushier than I wished.

Predictable, but the flavors are good. Added fresh basil on top which made it more interesting.

I doubled the sauce as someone suggested but the broccoli released a lot of water and the whole thing became soupy. Next time I would cut back on the sugar it was a bit sweet, otherwise a decent recipe.

Doubled sauce - used 1 tblspn ginger total. Cut sesame seed oil in half and added a little water. Used about 1.5 lbs sirloin that was thin sliced, marinated in Kikoman teriyaki sauce for about 4 hours and slow roasted about 45 minutes at 170 degrees. Used broccoli, 1 fennel bulb and stalks, 1/2 an onion. Cooked onion first and then the thinly sliced broccoli stalk for about 15 minutes, then added fennel and broccoli florets. Added sauce and beef and cooked 3 - 4 minutes until sauce was thick. Excellent.

I recently made this recipe for my daughter who loves B&B. I increased the sauce portion by a factor of 4, which seems about right. My daughter said it was as good if not better than the B&B from our local Chinese restaurant.

So yummy and easy to make! I doubled the sauce and added a TBSP of Orange Juice as recommended by other reviewers. For Veggies I used sugar snap peas which turned out so tasty, carrots, broccoli and cauliflower. I forgot to precook the broccoli so I added some water in the WOK and put a lid on and boiled the veggies on high for 5 min before stirfrying them. I used leftover steak but still marinated it for 4 hours and the flavor was so amazing. I threw in some Trader Joes Stir Fry noodles at the end. My Husband, 4 year old and 2 year old loved it and ate it - veggies and all! I thought the ginger was a nice touch - not overpowering to us at all....I'd highly recommend this one!

Very easy and very good! I added a little bit of orange juice to stretch the marinade/sauce and it worked beautifully. I also just marinated the meat for about an hour and it turned out ok. Great weeknight meal!

Great recipe. Used chicken instead of beef. Didn't have ginger, but used Chinese 5-spice, which turned out ok. Next time try with ginger. Added a chopped red bell pepper along with gai lan (Chinese broccoli) - beautiful color combo. Doubled the marinade/sauce - only marinaded for 20 minutes while prepping veggies - still flavorful. Will definitely add to stable.

This is a great standard meal. Nothing spectacular, just simple, quick, easy and tasty. I saw a lot of comments on a need for more of the sauce, why I don't know UNLESS you are planning on some rice then I would agree. The sauce was sufficient to cling to the variety of vegetables and the meat and to impart the flavor. I thought the vegetables were well chosen for texture and color.

Rating: 2
Well, this was not the flavor I was looking for. I doubled the recipe but tripled the sauce per other reviewers. The ginger overwhelmed all the other flavors, and it was pretty darn hot (pepper flakes) for a family who loves spicy! If you are looking for great authentic chinese food using shrimp, do try the spicy sichuan style shrimp from this site.

It tasted incredibly bland. It was also dry (not enough sauce).

Prepared this recipe with 4 large boneless chicken breast instead of the beef. Tripled the sauce ingredients except the brown sugar, and added minced garlic also. Used shaohsing wine in place of sherry. Marinating the chicken/beef definitely enhances this whole dish. I only had broccoli and carrots which was perfectly fine. Didn't blanch them beforehand because we enjoy our veggies crisp. Made for a quick and delicious one-bowl meal served over brown jasmine rice and sprinkled with a spicy sriracha sauce.

Rating: 3
This is a keeper. I used the original recipe for the marinade, but after I drained the beef, there was so little sauce left that I mixed the cornstarch with 3 more tablespoons of soy sauce. Next time, I'll just double the marinade also. The combination of the red pepper with the bright green vegetables and the beef makes a beautiful presentation.

Rating: 3
This is a tasty and simple dish. I double the marinade so that I have more juice to flavor the rice underneath the meat and veggies. - That way it is not so dry.

This is so delicious and so quick and easy. I used powdered ginger and substituted carrots for pea pods and vidalia onion for green ones because that is what I had on hand. I did not thicken the sauce at all but I did triple the amount of sauce ingredients for the piece of sirloin I had. Only marinated for 1 1/2 hours. Next time I will try with chicken and other chinese vegetables. The sauce is ummmm good! My husband who rarely comments on food said "make this again."

I only marinated the meat for about an hour and it was still delicious! A great one dish meal that's low in fat, high in vegetables and flavor and easy to make. Next time I will prep everything the night before and have dinner ready in the time it takes to cook the rice.

I chose this stir fry for a cooking class I was teaching based on the previous reviews. I personally didn't taste test it before I offered it in the class (risky I know). The good news is...it was a huge success! All my students loved it as well as the owner of the $25,000 Viking Kitchen I was teaching the class in! It's nice to know that these reviews are a good indicator of the quality of the dish. Enjoy this one, it's easy and delicious.

Good and easy to make. I used saki instead of sherry. Pre-cooking the broccoli is an unnecessary step so don't bother. Just cook the broccoli before the other vegtables for a minute or two.

I also tripled the marinade recipe and marinated the beef overnight. It is delicious!! My husband loved it & he's a tough critic. Used fresh squeezed oj instead of sherry & cut up a red asian pepper to give it a bit of spice. I didn't steam the broccoli, I sauteed all veggies & put a cover on the wok for 2 -3 minutes & the broccoli was crisp tender. This is staying in my collection.

I tripled the marinade recipe and served it over rice noodles. I used "chinese broccoli" which is more like a leafy broccoli rabe, instead of the usual broccoli florets. You can buy chinese broccoli in Asian stores. IT WAS INCREDIBLE!!!! My husband loved it. I also used "tamari soy sauce" instead of regualar soy. Tamari has a more interesting, deep flavor. I love to cook and do so regularly. This is one of the most flavorful recipes I have tried recently.

I liked this a lot. I used tri-tip steak (thinly sliced) and asparagus in place of all of the veggies other then that I followed the recipe exactly. It had a great flavor and was really really easy to throw together.

Yuuum. This turned out wonderfully. I made it my first time stir-frying just about anything, so I may have overcooked things a bit, but it was great. I agree there wasn't much sauce left after cooking, but it is stil a great recipe. My dad, an avid oriental style cook, was surprised by two things: 1, that you marinade something for stir fry, and 2, that the marinade was so sweet. But it's great if you have the right meat.

Made this with beef tenderloin and added mushrooms, shredded carrot, celery, bean sprouts, and water chestnuts from the salad bar. Omitted the sliced red pepper. Also doubled the marinade/sauce ingredients, easing up a bit on the garlic and ginger, and added a bit of crushed red pepper for zing. Served with basmati rice. Very scrumptious. This is a keeper. The basic sauce is great and could be adapted for chicken, pork, etc.

The only ingredient I didn't have on hand was the sherry and I used ground ginger (from the spice rack) instead of fresh. Even with those minor adjustments the dish was still very good. I used a flank steak which I let marinate overnight and I, like others, had to make additional sauce. I also added a little cayenne to the extra marinade for a little kick. The beef was very tender and my six year old daughter loved it which means this is definitely a keeper!

I made this with blanched long beans(string beans would be good too) and one whole red pepper. Instead of the green onions, I used a small onion-minced it and sauted it in the peanut oil before cooking the beef. I also made a separate batch of the marinade (kept away from the raw beef) with less garlic/less ginger and added it back at the end, I only needed a pinch of cornstarch. Served it with jasmine rice, husband LOVED it.

Great tasting dish... We'll definately make it again! We made it, our first time, for a group of friends who came in from out of town. They really enjoyed it, but if I had it to do over again, I think I would make it once or twice on my own before sharing it with company (A good rule of thumb to go by anyway, right?). Anyway, the broccoli was a little over cooked and the steak wasn't sliced quite right, so it didn't look that appealing visually, but the taste was right on the money. Great recipe.

This is and was the boom. If you like fried rice it's all that and a bag of chips.

This was really good, but I did have to make some changes. I followed the recipe for the marinade and marinated the steak for around 24 hours. And then about three hours before I fixed dinner I made another batch of the marinade for cooking, and added a 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes. It added a nice little kick. I also forgot to buy green onions so didn't put them in. I served it over rice, and my husband loved it. So after making the changes I would definately try this again!

This recipe is delicious!!! Taste like it came out of a chinese resturaunt (sp?). I guess since I didn't add broccoli and peas to my dish I didn't have a problem with the sauce. I didn't have much veggies in the house so only bell peppers & big chunks of onions went in. When the sauce was drying up as I was cooking it I just added water. Since cornstarch thickens the recipe there was no harm done. I added cracked red & black pepper to the recipe to spice it up! I will make this over & over again. This is a wonderful dish & recommend to any chinese-food-lover!!!

Used a litte too much beef, so there was not enough of the left over marinade, so I just added some more soy, sherry and touch of oil. The corn starch really thickened it, so I put in a 1/4 c of water and let it boil to a nice sauce. I like foods with a bite, so next time I will add some spicy tai suace. Great Recipe.

This is our new favorite beef stir-fry recipe. So delicious and easy... we love it! An excellent work-night meal. Oh, we leave out the green onions since my husband doesn't like them. You can slice the beef even thinner if you partially freeze it. Then it needs very little time in the marinade to absorb the flavor and cooks even more quickly.

This is very good. I omitted the peas and the peppers, only because I forgot to pick them up at the store (hey, I had three children with me!), but it was still delicious. My whole family liked it, even my three-year-old!

A great and easy stir-fry dish. Next time I will make more marinade, as the beef soaked up so much there was little left for the vegetables. Great flavor the seasame-soy-brown sugar-garlic is wonderful. The dish looks beautiful and colorful as well. Also goes wonderful with noodles.
