I really do like this trifle, although I substitute soft lady fingers. Fortify sherry with a little brandy or use fortified marsala or madeira...not an overwhelming amount.The richness of this dessert needs a slightly stronger contrast. I, too, use a vanilla pudding as Bird's seems to taste like dehydrated eggs. Also top it with toasted almonds and fresh berries. A wonderful, festive dessert. And as my English mum used to say... Trifle is perfection, but perfection is no trifle.

I used Earth and Vine Apricot and Cherry Amaretto Culinary Sauce instead of Cream Sherry and it was great.

This recipe is great except I made a creme anglaise instead of using instant custard. The pound cake worked very nicely. Rave reviews, especially from my British & Irish friends.

The frozen berries & custard mix (which I've previously used) are a turn-off for me (sorry!). A beautiful, delicious and easy- prep. raspberry dessert is Giada's Raspberry Tiramisu (you know where to find this ...).

Unable, after 4 store searches, to find either Bird's or Jello custard. Would not use frozen raspberries---they look great coming out of the package, but once they sit for a day in a trifle, they are an ugly mess. Too much liquid---no definition of layers. Not pretty.

Have made this several times. You can leave out the liquor if you have a mixed-age group. Fun for kids to make also!

This came out very soupy. I did love it with pound cake instead of lady fingers, however the frozen raspberries were just mush. My next trifle will be made using fresh berries layered with preserves and custard, which is more traditional anyway, albeit not as "easy". Having said that, trifle is not something I usually whip up on a whim, so buying fresh produce at the market isn't a big deal!

here's my fork rating, I'm the one who said to use a trifle dish.

I made this using "diet" ingredients - sugar free preserves and cheesecake flavored instant pudding, light Cool Whip, fat free pound cake, and frozen berries without syrup. It still tasted rich and decadent...I doubt anyone was the wiser. Very easy to make for a nice presentation. Took this to a Christmas potluck and quite a bit was eaten. Good thing, as the leftovers the next day were very soupy.

I first had trifle while visiting a cousin in London and was very impressed at the ease with which she put together this incredibly delicious, magical dessert. This recipe closely approximates my cousin's version. I have made it many, many times for company dinners, for parties, for pot- lucks, etc. and it's always the star of the show. This trifle is the best of all dessert worlds--easy, make-ahead, impressive, and incredibly GOOD!

This was my first trifle. It was delicious! My guests raved about it and the presentation was beautiful. I made this the day before I served it and it was fine the next day. However, the day after that it was too mushy to eat.

I thought this was really a great dessert to impress a crowd and it turned out that I wasn't wrong. Everyone loved it. It took some time as I used Bird's custard, but forgot to keep stirring it while it was chilling, so I had to redo it as it was nothing but lumps. Even so, an easy recipe that you can't go wrong with!!

This was my first trifle. I made it for Christmas dinner. I used less sherry, and I did not bother cutting off the crusts of the cake. I also added a splash of lemon extract to the custard. This looked lovely, and the raspberry flavor was yummy.

I've made it several times. Not only does it taste wonderful but looks very impressive. Easy to do.

BIG THANKS to all for your comments - very helpful. I made this with 2 packets of Birds custard and strawberries, blackberries and blueberries. You know it's just easier to buy unsweetened frozen fruit put some sugar on it and leave it to defrost,this way you can try various fruits.

my sister turned me onto this recipe, it is soooo very good. Used two containers frozen rasberries and used two tins of english custard and used angel food cake rather then pound cake. Everyone loves this and enough through it makes lot there is NEVER any left the next day when you are craving it. Do try this

I must have a large trifle bowl. I had to double everything but the Sherry (Rum). Made the day ahead and it worked well. Just make sure that those raspberries are well thawed and drained. I can see where this could be a mushy mess if hurried.

This is the first trifle I've made. It was really fast and easy and everyone loved it.

I found the amount of custard confusing. The Jello brand is not a 4.4 oz. package, at least that which I found in my local stores, but Bird's English Dessert Custard mix IS. However, I made an entire box of the Bird's which is 5 envelopes and yields 20(!) cups of custard. Clearly I didn't read the recipe too thoroughly before starting. At any rate, 3 cups of custard is all that is needed. If you use the Bird's mix, you only need to prepare 2 envelopes in the 4.4 oz. box. Aside from that difficulty, the trifle WAS easy and quite good.

A very impressive and delicious dessert with not too much effort! I used 3 pkgs of custard mix and 3 pkg of frozen raspberries. It seemed a little heavy on the sherry, I'd use a bit less next time.

Desperate for a quick Christmas Eve dessert, I tried this recipe. Having never made a Trifle before, I thought it would be a bit easier to make. No complaints, though, it was delicious!! The flavor after the 1st day was so much better!!! I didn't use all of the sherry, yet had sooo much in the bottom of the dish. I think this amount could have fed 10-15 people. A little goes a long way!! Very yummy!!

The title of this recipe as "easy" is very true. I, too, used 3 packages of raspberries and am glad I did. I used canned english custard to make the preparation even simpler. Our guests enjoyed it very much.

This was a big hit.I was very pleased with the results.I must say the reviews really helped me.I used the 2 packages of pudding mix,rum instead of sherry and strained the preserves.Thanks everyone!

Used ladyfingers, two packages of frozen raspberries and one pint of fresh...this was out of this world. Gave the left-overs to my guests so I wouldn't make a pig of myself. Five forks!

Rating: 4
This was just crazy good. I made it with ladyfingers instead of cake because I had some frozen, did the full two packages of Jello custard (that's a must) and used one egg yolk to make it richer. Used up three 10-oz packages raspberries, too, because you can never have enough raspberries. I also strained the preserves--not everyone can deal with the seeds. Guests SWOONED over the dessert and ate every single crumb. This is the best dessert I can imagine for a crowd, and I'll make it again and again!

Scrumptious and beautiful dessert. I also used 2 pkgs of custard and orange juice instead of sherry. I also mixed in some frozen blackberries with the raspberries. Highly Recommend!

This was a beautiful dessert, and all our guests loved it -- including the children! I omitted the alcohol and used orange juice instead. Also used 2 packages of custard mix instead of just one, and used every bit.

Absolutely beautiful and best of all easy to make. I substituted the sherry for rum and it was delicous. My first layer was very strong but I made up for it in the remaining two layers. All in all it was a success.

I couldn't find custard mix, so I used white chocolate pudding mix. I also used a mixture of Bailey's Irish Cream and orange juice to brush on the cake. My party guests LOVED IT! They ate every last little bit. I had chosen the recipe in large part because it could be prepared in advance, and it worked out great.

Easy dish to prepare the night before. All co-workers loved it! Substituted cool-whip for whipped cream. Also used instant vanilla pudding made with sweetened condensed milk. Couldn't find frozen pound cake at the local food market, so used well cooled pound cake from mix. Skipped the sherry all togethor, but I do think it would be a tasty addition.

Our guest raved about this dessert! I modified it slightly -- used fat free pound cake, vanilla pudding, dairy topping and orange juice instead of Sherry -- but it was still yummy.

Excellent - everyone raved about it. I varied from the receipe somehwat by using Bird's Custard, real whipped cream and cut the sherry in half.

Rating: 4
As easy as can be, and so delectable! I made it even easier by using ready made pudding (I used Tapioca and chocolate) and real whipped cream in a can. I left out the Sherry since one of the guests is allergic to alcohol and it was still delicious! I think the 10-12 servings is overestimated, though, unless your guests are on diets!
