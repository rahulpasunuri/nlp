a bit bland, added soaked mac nuts, for creaminess, extra salt, black pepper and a bit of the parmesan in the soup.

This recipe has become my new favorite use of random leftover ingredients! Based on what I had available, I took things in an "earthier" direction and I'm pleased with how it came out. For the base, I sauteed a Vidalia onion, a shallot, and a red onion along with the garlic (5 cloves) for more dimension. I then added some porcini and baby bella mushrooms along with a few stalks of celery and a couple of carrots (both rough-chopped) and simmered the whole thing in a little chicken stock to soften the carrots and celery. I added the artichokes (from a jar), some leftover alfredo sauce, the rest of the stock, and a hearty dose of black pepper. Just before blending, I added a handful of fresh flat parsley. Blend until smooth - yum!

Rich and flavorful. I've made this several times now and never strain it; always double the garlic for the soup (but I really love garlic) and add a little cream or half and half at the end. In my opinion either frozen or canned artichokes are suitable.

I didn't strain it, and I really enjoyed it. Yummy!

Sorry forgot to add that I did not strain it.

I made this last night. Used canned artichoke hearts, added a little carrot. Very artichokey. I split it in batches and tried cream in one batch as others had suggested but it really did not add much in terms of taste, conistency or dimension. I did keep it very chunky by pureeing only 2/3rd's and chopping the remaining 1/3rd. After ladleing into bowls I added a dollop of pesto, grated parm cheese and microwaved a couple slices of bacon until crisp and sprinkled the bits over the soup. Very good.

My wife and I made this, tried it and just dumped it down the drain. We really like artichokes, but I don't think this recipe really is very good. We first tried it strained, which wasn't very good, then we added back the puree, which made it a bit better, but it still wasn't very good. I would much rather suggest a broccoli soup or a roasted vegetable soup over this one, any day.

Not super tasty and too much work to put things through a strainer.

my family loved it. I made the pesto but we didn't really need it. We love artichokes. Didn't strain and added chopped artichoke bottoms after making the soup. Also used canned, rinse well. Rich soup but tasty.

Let me preface this review by saying that I LOVE artichokes. That being said, I loved this soup! I used canned artichokes instead of frozen and I also did not strain the soup (i like a little texture). My friend and I ate the whole batch in 1 meal, we loved it so much. I also loved how easy and healthy it is. If you really love artichokes, try this soup. If you aren't crazy about artichokes, this might not be the recipe for you.

I thought the soup was delicious. Made just half of it but should have put in all the pesto. I tried it right away warm and added liquid cream. But the best was the next day with the other half which I had refridgerated. I added cream again and cold it was even better. A delight on warm summer days. I definitely will make it again during the summer months.

Wow, I was SO disappointed in this! I ended up changing it completely to avoid disaster. Added a lot of spinach and some dried red pepper, lemon, light cream. I also put a dollop of Greek yogurt on top with the pesto. Now, THAT soup was good.

for lpaulsen-I nearly missed them in the frozen food section because Bird's Eye's Artichokes look a little like brussels sprouts on the box if you look too closely. I am making this tonight for the first time for my bookclub.

Where can you find frozen artichoke hearts. I've looked in every grocery store to no avail.

This soup was fantastic! The pesto cuts through the super artichokey flavor and makes it divine! Would also consider adding a little cream.

This was not bad, served with salad.

Very easy to prepare particularly since I used all the ingredients but added the parmesan and chopped basil to the soup just before serving but not as a garnish. I absolutely recommend for soup loving people.
