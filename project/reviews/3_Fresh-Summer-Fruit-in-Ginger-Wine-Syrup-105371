The mixture of textures and colors didn't work for me. The raspberries kind of broke down in the syrup, so if I did this again I'd use just peaches (or nectarines) and blueberries -- better contrasting colors and sturdier fruit. The syrup was thinner than I expected -- only needed 1/2 of the syrup for the amount of fruit. Doing it again, I'd just toss the fruit with a little sugar and lemon juice and skip the syrup. Kitchen smelled good though!

Refreshing, but really not a big deal. There are much better fruit/syrup recipes out there.

As always, the key is to make sure you have just-ripe fruit. The syrup is delicious. I used 6 tablespoons of sugar, and reduced it down further than the recipe suggests, to get a slightly more "syrupy" consistency, and served with a small scoop of passion fruit sorbet.

This was sooo good! Very refreshing and light. I cut the sugar down to 6 tablespoons b/c 9 just seemed excessive, and it was certainly sweet enough. I served it with a simple cake which soaked up the extra syrup. Nice.
