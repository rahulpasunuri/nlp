This was simple, easy & pretty delicious. I didn't change a thing, except that I doubled the 2 sauces because they really weren't enough for four. I paired this with the Super Slaw (Bon Apetit/July 1998) & was asked to promise to make both again.

This recipe is so delicious. I have made it several times and tonight I made it since I was entertaining and am on weight watchers. I made it with the Asian Avocado Salsa as the appetizer. The soy honey sauce is very sweet so i like to drizzle just a little on top and some on the side. The wasabi sauce is a must to complement the sweetness of the other sauce. It is great served with plain brown rice and asparagus steamed in ginger and garlic.

Great dish. I didn't care for the honey much,as the taste was too overbearing. I substituted a tsp of sugar for the honey, which was better. The salmon is especially nice served with baby bok choy brushed with a mixture of garlic bean paste, a little minced fresh ginger, soy sauce and sesame oil and put under the broiler at the same time as the fish.

Made it as suggested, it was pretty good but the honey was too strong. I had a strong flavored honey on hand (from blackberries not clover), so next time I would cut it in half. Also my wasabi powder was kinda old so it didn't have much kick. Next time I will buy a tube of wasabi, it should hold the flavor better.

Look good, tasted even better. I didn't have wasabi powder, so I used a squeeze-on prepared wasabi + horseradish condiment (Inglehoffer?). Instead of water I added half and half to make it creamy, and a little sugar to tame the vinegar in the prepared wasabi condiment. Wow, was it good - smooth, and an absolutely perfect complement to the salty-sweet dark sauce, which tamed 90% of the remaining heat.

Rating: 4
Great meal, not a leftover in sight. I doubled the recipe for the soy- honey sauce and marinaded the fish for a full hour. The only tricky part was the soy-honey sauce. As it boiled, it went from thin, thin, thin, oops, too thick, but it still tasted delicious. The wasabi sauce drizzled on top was the best part--gave each serving a gourmet-restaurant look and served as a nice antidote to the salty- sweet sauce and marinade. We also served white rice and broiled, seasoned vegetables (asparagus, onion, red pepper, mushrooms).

Rating: 4
I have made this too many times to count, always to rave reviews. I triple the wasabi and honey-soy sauces because everyone loves them and they pour on extra sauces on the rice and salmon. I use sushi rice with it and serve it molded individually (just oil a half-cup measure, pack the rice in it, and invert on the plate)--very elegant.

Rating: 4
This recipe has been my go-to weekday salmon dish for years. It is easy, fast and delicious. I skip the wasabi sauce because I don't like it. Other than that I like the recipe as written. Still, sometimes just for kicks, I add red pepper flakes to the marinade or marinate the salmon longer than what's written.

Absolutely Delicious!

Rating: 4
Though this certainly doesn't produce the most outstanding flavors for salmon compared with the other recipes on this site, what IS exceptional is the ease with which the fish can be prepared, making it possible to enjoy really delicious salmon on a weekday night. ///// Some reviewers pointed to the exotic mirin rice wine not usually stocked by your average grocery store. We, not surprisingly, didn't have the rice wine either, so we just chose to ignore the marinade and season the fish with the usual olive oil, salt and pepper. Since we had no ginger flavor from the marinade we simply added the ginger to the sauce because ultimately, the flavors, when reduced ideologically to their very cores, are the same in both the marinade and the sauce (ignoring the wasabi). The honey replaces the sweet rice-wine, the lime replaces the acidic vinegar, and the soy sauce adds the salt already in the marinade. ///// Though at some point we'll try the marinade, our preparation without it tasted great and of course, was less work than making the marinade.

Rating: 3
Really enjoyed this dish. The soy-honey glaze was unusual and a bit pungent on it's own, yet it melded very well with the ginger in the marinade. I marinaded some red peppers with the fish, roasted them separately, and served them with the soy-honey sauce. Excellent preparation!

I really do love this recipe. It's very simple, quick and yields wonderful results. The only caveat is that if you don't keep a good supply of Asian vinegars, etc, in your pantry, then this recipe definitely requires a trip to your local Asian store. Frankly, all these ingredients are very versatile and inexpensive, so why not just buy them to have on hand? The salmon needs a slightly spicy accompaniment to balance its sweet richness, so I served it with sugar snap peas that I boiled briefly and then tossed with toasted sesame seeds and chili oil. White take-out rice, re- steamed in the microwave, completes the meal.

Rating: 2
Made as written, and I'm sure this works great for those that like sweet and hot combos...but unless you like BOTH, don't do this one. The sweet is TOO sweet to stand alone, and if you don't like hot, you won't add the wasabi sauce which saves it. My kid spit it in the bin, hubby scraped off the sweet, and I just gave up and tossed the leftovers. No thanks.

I cannot comment too much on the marinade because I substituted white wine for the mirin (which I thought I had) but even so, it was still pretty good. I'm commenting on the sauce mainly. I made the sauce as directed and it ended up turning to stone! I only boiled it for the 4 minutes and as soon as it thickened, I pulled it off the stove. While I was letting it cool, I grabbed a spoon to take a small taste and it was hard as a rock! Not sure what I did wrong but obviously something. Oh well. Won't try this again.

This is so good that I only make it once or twice a year now so I can keep it special. Triple the sauce recipe--the amount given is way too small. Avoid over-marinating the salmon or its texture will change--some people like the change, but we find it becomes too "mushy."

Delicious--we've made this many times, both under the broiler and on the grill. My only suggestion: the wasabi sauce is really watery, so we add a spoonful of mayonnaise--makes it smooth and creamy.

I marinated the fish, grilled it, but used the honey sauce (very sweet) as a glaze when I turned the fish over on the grill. Was perfect. Added extra lime juice to rest of honey sauce to serve on the side and made the wasabi into more of a paste served on the side along with ginger slices as with sushi. Some of my gueststhen took it upon themselves to actually add the wasabi to the honey sauce! OK, whatever. But got raves anyway.

Will definitely make this again. Even my husband, who isn't crazy about salmon, loved it. However, I made some adjustments to the sauce. I used Trader Joe's balsamic vinegar glaze instead of honey, and the sauce had a clingy consistency that allowed me to brush it over the salmon. Also, I served the salmon with Trader Joe's wasabi mayonnaise. Great, and so quick and easy!

I've made this twice - the second time, better, because I marinated the salmon longer - up to 20 minutes. I also thinned the sauce once I overcooked it - the texture was too thick the first time around to distribute it - by adding water. Used lemon instead of lime - it was great! I highly recommend! Great for a dinner party - any extra sauce can be put on the table. Great with blue cheese mashed potatoes!

Rating: 4
I think I already commented on this recipe, but I feel like I should commend it again! This recipe was quick, easy, and very yummy! I used fresh salmon that had been caught a couple days before and instead of broiling the salmon, I threw it on the grill in some foil and it turned out perfect, kept all the juices in and added much more flavor. During the grilling, I kept basting the salmon with the soy honey ginger marinate to lock in the ginger taste. My only suggestion is to get REAL wasabi instead of the dried powdered kind, it's just better!

Rating: 3
This recipe was good but needed more salt in the marinade (or lime-soy sauce) to balance the honey and lime. I used more (1/4 cup instead of 2Tbsp) soy sauce in the marinade and it was a definite improvement. Also don't over do the honey lime sauce when serving - let each diner add more if necessary.

This dish was FANTASTIC and easy to make! Definitely make it with a side of baby spinach that has been sauteed in a miso broth reduction. Each bite was so good I didn't want it to end! White vinegar works if you don't have rice vinegar. Easy prep and clean up.

I made this salmon dish for my family this weekend. It got rave reviews, but I felt like it was a little heavy on the honey for my taste. I ended up adding additional soy to mine. Otherwise, it was great. When I make this dish in the future, I'll definitely use less honey.

Absolutely incredible flavor! I've now made this recipe four times and it's always been fantastic. The meal is really impressive for guests and much easier and quicker to prepare than it looks. The honey-soy sauce is wonderfully tasty. The first time I made the sauce it did end up getting really thick - like molasses - but when it hit the hot fish it became like a glaze. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to get it quite as thick since then. This is one recipe that I will make again and again. Do your body a favor tho, use only fresh wild salmon if you can get it at your local fish market. Farmed salmon, while much cheaper, is full of dyes and other nastiness that is really bad for you, especially if you eat it often.

This is a great one for the whole family if they like fish. It's sweet and simple. Here's a tip though: When you finish marinading the fish and put it in the oven, bring the marinade to a slow boil in a small sauce pan. When the fish is done, coat the fish with the sauce and pour the rest into the serving dish. This adds even more fantastic flavor. I'd make this again in a minute.

This was a relatively easy and tasty dish. It was also very forgiving. I was not able to get mirin (in Central Maine finding culinary specialty foods has the same odds as winning the Powerball lottery--in other words you have a much better chance of getting hit by lightning than finding what you need). Sherry is a fine substitute for mirin. It does need, as other reviewers pointed out, more wasabi sauce to balance the sweetness of the soy-honey sauce. Paired with rice and wilted spinach flavored with Asian sesame oil and served with a nice white wine (HDV Carneros Chardonnay for example) it is a wonderful meal.

I made this for my mom for her birthday with a slab of fresh king salmon caught just last week up off of Vancouver Island, BC. Not only was the salmon to die for, but the recipe made it all the better. We had a pretty good sized piece of salmon and I had to double the recipe so there would be enough sauce to go around. I'd say if you're making this for two people the amounts in the recipe are just fine. I would highly recommend this recipe, however a couple of things I might do different next time is add a little garlic to the marinade along with the ginger to give it more of a kick, and instead of the wasabi powder mixture, I'd buy real pre-made wasabi. EXCELLENT BLEND OF FLAVORS, I WILL DEFINETLY MAKE AGAIN! :o)

Excellent-especially for those who enjoy sushi. Not sure about rice and asparagus as sides, but the noodles from the Asian Noodles with pan-seared flank steak were great with it and carried through on the Japanese theme.

Rave reviews on this one! My boyfriend said it was the best thing I'd ever made! I would double (or even triple) the sauce recipe though! I used it on a noodle/bok choy stirfry to accompany the salmon. I read the sauce directions too quickly and added the wasabi paste right to the soy/honey sauce before reducing. Turned out well despite that! Didn't taste the salmon marinate though... could maybe skip that part if you're in a hurry.

Excellant! Double the sauces though, no one could get enough of those.

This has become a favorite. I substitute some fancy wasabi mustard or mayo for that sauce, but always make double the soy-honey sauce because it's wonderful on rice. Be careful: that sauce reaches boiling and can boil over quickly.

This is fantastic. Honey-soy sauce works fine if you make it 30-60 minutes ahead of time. Boil as directed and then *let it sit*. Do not re-heat or it will turn thick & sticky. Wasabi sauce needs to be doubled.

Had some of the problems mentioned by others with the soy-honey sauce -- wouldn't thicken for ages and when it did, became way too sticky. The flavors of the sauces in general were a bit overkill on fresh Copper River salmon, so we might save them for use on out-of-season salmon; the marinade, though, was just perfect, and will be a keeper for any Asian-style fish marinade.

Very good. The sauces make the meal. I would marinade longer next time and will use the soy/honey reduction for grilling in the future.

This has become a weekly staple at our home. Wonderfully quick to make and delicious! We add the wasabi directly to the honey sauce to meld the flavors while it cooks. We made this for company last week, doubled the sauce and grilled the fish. It was a huge hit. We served it with asparagus and jasmine rice.

this 'recipe' was terrific, although i followed some of the other reviewers advice (yaya's, pa, and a cook from tacoma), i ditched the honey part, found some ketjap manis at a local asian store, but i also substituted a 1 TB of honey for 1TB of brown sugar, added the balsamic vinegar on my asparagus.

I've really enjoyed this recipe and have made it quite a few times. It is extremely easy and delicious for a nice meal during the week. I also had problems thickening the soy honey sauce and used cornstarch to help it along. It wouldn't be the same without the sauce!

3 1/2 forks!!! Hard to find a better meal that only takes 20 minutes to prepare... I grilled the salmon and some asparagus brushed with balsalmic vinegar and olive oil, and served with jasmine rice... Was absolutlely delicious! Make sure you thicken the sauce, it ran all over the plate a little more than I would've liked... might want to cook slightly beyond the 4 minutes suggested... This would make a great company dish.

As all the other reviewers have said (except the last one, and his is a totally different recipe so forget it) this recipe is great - leave it as it is.

Good simple recipe but a few recommendations: 1. Score your salmon by dragging your knife across the surface on the diagonal creating a broad cross-hatch pattern. This allows flavors to really seep-in. 2. Ditch the marinade recipe. Just use a cooled down version of the soy-honey. Or, do what I do and ditch honey completely (it's sticky and not the right texture for the fish in my opinion) and go with an Indonesian Soy Sauce called "Ketjap Manis" -- avail in most Chinatown Grocery stores. Here's my modified marinade: 1.5 tb sesame oil 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 tb finely grated ginger 3-4 tb ketjap manis * or 1 tb soy sauce, 1 tb honey mix together and rub into salmon. Chill in fridge 30 minutes or, if in rush, marinate 10 at room temp as per orignal instructions. 3. I served it with wild rice at the end of cooking the rice I mixed in craisins (dried cranberries) and sliced green onions. I reserved extra green onion slices to garnish salmon and sauces. -fun

This is a great 'no-brainer' recipe. Easy prep, and it was a hit at dinner! May substitute mustard for wasabi, if the latter isn't available. I served this w/ steamed broccolini (oyster sauce and fried onion sprinkled on top), and brown rice.

I really liked everything about this recipe. It was simple, quick, easy to make, and it was absolutely delicious. The two sauces really complimented each other and they were like fireworks in your mouth (in a good way). Only one complaint. I also found the amount of honey to be overwhelming so I added more soy sauce and and lime juice which livened the flavor up for me. Enjoy!!!

Rating: 2
I thought the salmon marinade was a little too faint but the honey sauce was good. The honey sauce was too sweet when I followed the exact measurements (it just tasted of honey) so I added a little more soy sauce and lime (& let it cool) which made it perfect. Served it to friends and they really enjoyed it. I ran out of rice the second time I made this so I served it with soba noodles with the honey/soy sauce on it. Even better!! Not one of my all-time favorites but good one to file for a salmon dinner.

My husband and I have traveled all over the world. I have been considered a gouermet cook and hostess for many years. This recipe does deserve 4 stars..and it deserves to be made with exactly the ingrredients specified. The simplicity of the preparation, the complexity of the tastes are wonderful. Serve it with sticky rice drizzled with the honey/soy sauce and asparagus. I grilled on foil, used wasabi paste thinned with a little hot water and double the sauces, even for two people. I am thrilled to add this recipe to my collection! ....It is my husband's favorite salmon dish.

I love salmon. my boyfriend doesn't, but he ate it all and said it was good. This dish tasted like something from a fine restaurant. Mine even looked like the pic. I purchased wasabi sauce, and I doubled the sauce. But, I didn't really have to. It never thickened up until it cooled off a bit, so next time i will just heat it to boiling, and remove it from heat. If you do that, you also don't have to worry about it reducing too much. I will definately make this again, it was quick , easy, and delisious.

Rating: 3
In agreement with all the rave reviews, plus it's simple to prepare and perfect for entertaining. About the soy-honey sauce...I knew I'd want more so I doubled the ingredients. Still, after reducing, there's not much left in the pan, so now I boil just long enough to combine flavors, then add a tiny bit of cornstarch-water mixture to thicken. I almost gave this 4 forks, but I have a problem with "A dish beyond compare." I've had quite a few in my lifetime that can be described as such: In St. Romaine, a rich lobster bisque laced with chunks of foie gras; on Capri, a basil gnocchi with shellfish in a tangy marinara sauce; in St. Emilion, venison stuffed with foie gras; and at Laforet in Pittsburgh, lobster and scallops poached in butter sauce. Maybe my guests disagree, but I don't think I've ever created anything "beyond compare." Maybe someday.

Awesome. The (non-wasabi) sauce tastes a lot like a good teriyaki sauce.

Perhaps I did something wrong when it came to marinading the fish. I think that if you choose a fillet that is too thick, the flavors won't absorb beyond the surface of the fish.

I tried this recipe and my husband really enjoyed it (especially the wasabi) but I thought it was just OK. I thought that the sauce was too sweet even though I used less honey than required. This was the first time I have ever broiled salmon and it came out so juicy and moist. I had leftover salmon the following day and it was yummy without the sauce.

This recipe has great complimentary flavors. Personally I doubled the amount of soy-honey sauce and increased the amount of ginger in the marinade. If you can't find mirin, sake with a little sugar does the job well. I also steamed green beans to go with it with soy, rice vinegar, and garlic olive oil.

Rating: 3
This was very good, but much better the next day. Boiled the honey sauce perhaps too long (10 mins) with constant whisking... it ended up being more like caramel on a candied apple. Oh yes, I and forgot to buy honey, so I used creamed honey instead. Also, you may want to play with the amount of wasabi you use- I found it not to be strong enough. Served this with steamed buttered green beans and garlic mashed potatoes.

After reading the reviews, I altered the marinade to the lime juice, soy sauce and substituted seasoned rice vinegar for the mirin and rice vinegar. I did everything else per direction and it was great. I have had salmon nearly every way imaginable and this is a definite repeat for us. To the person that asked about wasabi paste...the paste is just a reconstituted wasabi powder. Add a bit of water and thin it down to a sauce like consistency and you will have the same thing.

Rating: 4
Just when I thought the "Honey and Soy Glazed Salmon" was the best salmon recipe on this site, I try this one! While I am usually hesitant to marinate fish, this recipe comes out very mild. The wasabi is very benign...but that could be because I didn't add the full amount. My dish honestly looked like the picture--perfectly broiled. If you are making this for a crowd you might want to make more sauce. It is so yummy!

Salmon is a great fish for this dish because it easily picks up any flavours. I used buckwheat honey and my wife says it overpowered the taste of the salmon. She just gave it a "two forks". I think this would be a good dish for kids who are picky about eating fish.

As my family is very fond of salmon, we were looking forward to this recipe. It was a terrilble disappointment to all of us. The soy-honey sauce was much too sweet and detracted from the fish while the wasabi and maranade added little. The only positive I can find is that it did make a beautiful presentation. We discussed whether we'd use the maranade again and decided it didn't add enough to bother.

Rating: 3
An excellent salmon marinade. As for the two sauces, my wasabi was more like a paste than a sauce. Thinning it down was an option but since everyone at my house likes the flavor of wasabi, I just stirred it into the soy-honey sauce to give it a kick. If you do this, be sure to add the wasabi a bit at a time. It is a good - but powerful thing!

I don't usually give "4" but I'll give it to this one. Yes, it is sweet...but I happen to like sweet and I found that a little dab of wasabi on the side added just the right "kick". (Look at the picture to get an idea of presentation and amount of wasabi). If you don't like sweet recipes just cut down on the honey. I would highly suggest that the short marination time be followed. There is already a lot of flavor here.

This looked so pretty in the picture that I could not resist. I also love that wasabi flavor, thus this should have worked, but it did not. It was a very pretty, but boring hunk of salmon, with wasabi. However on the bright side, it makes me think of other ways to use these flavors.

Would then be able to use the wasabi paste like lines of decorative icing.

This is very very close to a recipe I make all the time! My recipe calls for equal parts lemon juice, honey and soy sauce as the marinade (and also use it to brush over the top between cooking phases). I cut slits in the salmon and poke in fresh garlic chunks. I bake for 20 minutes at 400, then broil for 5 minutes to caramelize the honey just a little bit. I have always used rice and asparagas as side dishes too. Adding wasabi to the mix can't hurt since I love Japanese food!

This was so good even my daughter who dislikes fish ate it. I also reduced the honey in half and served it with herbed brown rice and a side of stir-fried shitake mushrooms with snow pea pods. I garnished the salmon (so high in heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids) with fresh cilantro.

I made this last night for a "Girl's Night" dinner party. My guests loved it. While shopping, I forgot the ginger so I just used powdered and adjusted it to taste. I drained most of the marinade and baked the salmon. I spooned the marinade over it periodically and the taste was great. The honey sauce was sweet(I hadn't printed the reviewer suggestions), but I just barely dotted it on the salmon and it was delicious with the marinade taste already there. I'll definitely make this again.

At the risk of being one of those people who raves about a dish and then says all the ways they changed it, I made a few modifications that really worked... I only put half the honey in the soy glaze, as others suggested, but also added sweet chili sauce to give it some more zing. For the wasabi, I mixed it and the water and then with 1/4 cup sour cream so I could dollop that on top of the glazed fish so that the textures would contrast. It was quite yummy this way. Also, very finely grating the ginger for the marinade made small pieces of ginger stick to the fish and caramelize when broiled. C'est magnifique!

I cut the honey in half and still found it too sweet. It wasn't horrible, just not great, and there is a much nicer salmon on this site - I believe its called Salmon with Soy-Honey glaze. I cut up scallions and tossed those on top, which gave it a nice and needed bite, but wasn't overly impressed.

This was an easy and delicious dish! My thanks to the previous reviewers who suggested cutting back on the honey- I used half of the honey called for and it was sweet enough.

Just before the salmon was fully cooked, I unwrapped it and ran it under the broiler to brown the top a bit.

I only had Sake and didn't want to hunt around for Mirin. Sake is another Rice Wine so that worked just fine on the marinade. I really liked the Honey-soy sauce, but might make it again with just a touch less honey. Overall, this was very good, and I will definately make it again.

I've made this recipe twice, both times for company, and everyone loved it. My mouth waters while I'm making it just thinking about the taste. If you don't like sweet sauces, limit the amount of the soy-honey sauce you drizzle on your fish or reduce the amount of honey you put in with the soy. I really like wasabi, and I'm glad to have a reason to eat it other than with sushi or in mashed potatoes. Also, I served this with roasted shallot and buttermilk mashed potatoes I got off this site, with a few changes, and it was excellent!

I almost did not make this because of some negatives reviews and I am so glad I decided to make it anyway! I grilled the salmon, served it with brown basmati and some fresh veggies barely sauteed with chili oil to add some spice. I also doubled the sauces. So easy! I will make again and again!

Yuck. Absolutely horrible. The honey-ginger sauce sounds much better in theory than it tastes...it completely overwhelmed the salmon. Don't waste a good piece of fish!

OK, I read all the rave reviews, 4 forks means "a dish beyond compare" multiply that times so many experienced cooks, and I was excited to try this recipe. So tonight I bought beautiful fresh salmon and lined up all the other ingredients and -- ugh! If you have a sweet tooth you may enjoy this dish, but suffice it to say - the flavors are far too extreme to enter the realm of gourmet in my cookbook. I can still taste the "honey" -- plus the added sweetness of the mirin marinade -- just too much sugar for my palate. My instinct was right - the ingredients are either for kids or those with a very sweet(savory) tooth (the wasabi does NOT balance it). I would definately skip the honey if you try this one.

Yummy. The combination of the sweet honey and the sharp wasabi was superb. It's an easy dish to prepare too. I suggest using the broiler for another three minutes or so to create a crisper, more textural coating.

This was phenomenal!!! The wasabi is a perfect match for the soy-honey sauce. I complemented this dish with yellow rice, fresh black berries, and fresh cherry tomatoes. The taste equalled the beautiful presentation!

Nice and light, but not the best. The soy-honey sauce ended up carmelizing on me. I served this with sesame soba.

I thought this was great, I served it for a friend of mine who is a chef and he loved it. I added a little of Annies Sesame Shitake salad dressing and it was awesome!

I think 4 forks are given too often to recipes, but this one really deserves it! It was absolutely wonderful.

Living on Cape Cod, we eat fish at least twice a week. I am always looking for a new recipe to use. I feel that both the sauce and marinade would work with other fish as well. This is definitely a keeper!

WOULD I MAKE THIS DISH AGAIN! YES! YES! YES!

VERY GOOD. I HAVE MADE THIS TWICE AND MUST SAY, NOTHING IS LOST WHEN YOU SKIP THE MARINADE. I SERVED THIS WITH THE CARROT AND EDAMAME SALAD ALSO ON THIS SITE AND IT WAS A WONDERFUL COMBO.

We made this with tuna - it was very tasty! I agree with a previous reviewer, marinating is not necessary.

I would rate this recipe a 3.6. It is very good, super simple and light. Do make extra sauce as it is needed for the rice.

For such an easy and quick recipe, this was FABULOUS! Don't even bother marinating the salmon, the sauces are what make it so wonderful. Ok, so I'm naive... I had no idea of the price of wasabi powder ($5.50 for a tiny jar at my market), but it was incredibly good and well worth the price. For 4 people, I would probably have to double both sauces so there'd be plenty to lick. I served this tonight with jasmine rice and sugar snap peas. We're glad it's all gone, or we'd still be eating...

Awsome!!! I combined the two sauces because I did not think my teenagers would go for just the wasabi sauce. Nice and mellow...they loved it!!

Awesome dish! Even the kids loved it. It was so good, we made it again the next day. I bought fresh Salmon and cooked it rare.

This recipe was easy and delicious. I only made the soy honey sauce and passed it separately in a gravy boat. I served as an accompaniment a watercress salad drizzled with sesame oil and low sodium soy sauce. I will definitely make the recipe again as the slightly sweet sauce took away the fishy taste of the salmon. This is an ideal recipe for busy people as you can get it on the table in minutes - and it's healthy!

EXCELLENT! And couldn't be easier. We raved about it. Used arctic char instead of salmon. It's a great fish that looks and tastes like salmon but is less fatty. Make more wasabi than suggested for those who want more of a kick.

Must try!! I can't believe how easy it was to make. The ingredients are easy to use. Made this dish in 20 minutes. Tastes just like a gourmet rest. would've made it. I served it with a side of light chinese chicken salad and asparagus.
