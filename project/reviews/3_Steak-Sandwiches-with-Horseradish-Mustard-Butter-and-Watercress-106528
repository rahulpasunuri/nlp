Quick and delicious! Love the contrast in flavors and textures.

This was good...not great.

This was very nice indeedperfect for a guest-luncheon (or a light dinner), paired with a simple Bordeaux. I took some cues from the cook from Denver, using ciabatta (my preference over any baguette beyond the shores of France). Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly, and I doubt that I'll modify it next time I make it. To the cook from NC: you should probably move. No horseradish (it's easy to make)? No watercress? No fresh-baked breads? Focus on recipes from "Family Circle."

This dish is fantastic. It may be difficult to find watercress, but it's worth the effort. The spicy pepper of the watercress perfectly compliments the horseradish butter (which is also amazing by itself). I've made this on homemade ciabatta too--it's got a good crusty chew that I like better than baguette.

I could not find bottled horseradish so I looked for a mix of dijion and horseradish sauce in a bottle and was horrified at all the chemicals, but I found Emerils brand and it had like four ingredients so I figured I was close. I think I needed more. I couldn't find watercress so I substituted some baby salad. It was good. I used italian bread. I couldn't find bagettes.

Tried again with tenderloin... spread butter mixture over steaks for 8 hours... then grilled until medium-rare... while steak cooled.. grilled baguette with horseradish butter.... when it was toasted, placed watercress a bit of cilantro and then steak with a little extra butter-sauce on top..... yum yum yum...much better this time

I used a Omaha top sirloin and grilled it. The flavor was nice, but I should have used tenderloin. I think with a baguette, you need very tender cut of meat. Readers might want to try it "open face" ... Makes a nice meal, but nothing "Beyond compare"

Next time I will just butter the bread, spread with cajun mustard, add shallots & call it good. And it was!

Loved how easy and quick this was...would cut down to 4 Tbl butter as it tended to make it a little too greasy and just a tad more horseradish(used entirely as marinade)..served over arugula with roasted potatoes and asparagus - was great (even my 1& 3 year olds liked it) Anyone tried grilling it? To the cook from Mississauga - did you cut perpendicular to the grain? I have ruined many a tender (and more expensive) cut of meat by just cutting it the wrong way...hope that helps...

I made this last night for dinner. The flank steak I used was incredibly tough even though I prepared it as instructed, and cooked it rare. Any suggestions for another cut of beef that would be more tender but not compromise the recipe? Other than the meat it was very tasty.

Served this for a foursome dinner party - very simple and quick. I like the review that suggests tomatoes and less butter.

Both my husband and I liked this one. I would reduce the amount of butter by half to concentrate the horseradish and mustard flavors more. We added sliced cherry tomatoes to the sandwiches.
