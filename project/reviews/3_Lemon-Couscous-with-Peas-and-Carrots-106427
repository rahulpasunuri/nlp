I love this fast tasty recipe. It takes such little time and is a great dish to take to a family dinner. It accompanies pork especially well. I did add 1 tsp. salt. My kids love it and I think it's one of the best couscous recipes I've come across. I also added a touch of fresh mint and it was divine.

I agree that this dish was a bit too lemony (and I like lemon). It was very easy to make, and it wasn't terrible, but I probably won't make it again. It just didn't stand out.

it was a little on the dry side. i used frozen veggies to cut down on time, and it was ok. i served it with the sauce from the artichoke with lemon and dill sauce and it made the difference.

This recipe was so easy to make. It did not have a lot of flavor, which is why I only give it two forks. I did however use vegetable stock instead of chicken stock. I added cumin to accompany the rest of the meal which helped. I would however make this again, it was easy, and it is a nice light dish that I believe would go well with any meat. If you are looking for a nice side dish that will not take away from the rest of your meal and looks appealing then try this.

As my husband said, this would be great with just about everything! We really liked the flavor of this couscous, and I liked the easy preparation. I served it with an herbed salmon steak, and it was perfect. I'll definitely make this again.

This must be one of the most bland dishes I ever ate! It had a total lack of zest and body. I also skipped half of the lemon peel and still found it too much. I think when you are using bland ingredients like couscous, peas and carrots, you should at least compensate the blandness by adding some herbs and spices.

I've made this recipe a number of times--it's always a hit. Great on weeknights, and is impressive enough to serve guests. Accents simply grilled fish wonderfully. Yum!

The dish was too bland. Maybe I overcooked the peas, but it seemed like the lemon juice leached the color out of the peas, so the dish didn't look appealing and we didn't like it. Won't make it again.

I've made this several times and just followed the recipe. Delicious and SO easy. Perfect for weekday meals or weekend picnics. Great with grilled food.

I used whole wheat couscous, omitted the lemon peel, and reduced the amount of butter, and it was still delicious. Very quick too.
