The zucchini is crisp yet tender, the carmelized onion adds body and sweetness. Include the flowers if you get the chance. They add a rare freshness. They are fragrant, carry the flavor of the olive oil into the dish, and will melt in your mouth. I added a dash of garlic and used whole wheat rotini instead of penne. Very satisfied!

This was so easy and so good, both for your tastebuds,and your waistline! I will make it again and again. I simply added three cloves of garlic to the zucchini. Other than that, the recipe as is works wonderfully. I'm thinking I may add some kalmata olives next time for a little bite. Would also be great with some leftover cubed grilled chicken breast.

Because I was scared of this dish turning out like "ratatouille with pasta" like someone else said, I used a sweet yellow onion, and about 1/2 the recommended tomatoes and I also sliced the zucchini thinly, instead of the cubes, and sprinkled a little bit of shredded mozzarella cheese at the end. It came out great. Really sweet, light, perfect summer dinner.

My spouse and I think this recipe is incredibly delicious! I leave out the blossoms and add feta cheese. It is so good. I have used canned tomatoes in the past, but did fresh this time (only one), and it was yummy.

Delicious ... do not change anything, you don't need to. Parmegiano Reggiano would overwhelm the sublte flavors so don't use it. Instead for more concentrated depth of flavor it is important to caramalize the onionsproperly and not just fry them until a bit brown...and of course the quality and freshness of zuchinni and their blossoms is important. Perfect dish for using up home grown zuchinni.

I think I owe this recipe an apology. After a day of sitting in my refrigerator, this dish taste so much better! Overnight, the zucchinis had a chance to absorb the tanginess of the tomatoes and the spiciness of the hot peppers(I added quite a bit hot red pepper flakes). The pasta was not stirred in on the first day but kept separate so it would not get soggy. No zucchini blossoms this time. Lot's of shredded parmesean cheese on top and it was really quite delicious! I enjoyed this so much better on day 2 I think I might even consider making this again someday.

This is kind of like ratatouille with pasta thrown into it. It's okay, I guess. I neither love it or hate it. You got to love zucchini to really enjoy this one. I didn't think the zucchini blossoms added anything good to the dish- don't bother if your don't have them.

I'm making this tonight, but noticed the instructions call for crushed red pepper and cheese - these aren't in the ingredients list. Quantities just to taste??? I'll write again after I've decided what to do.

We enjoyed it. Skipped the zucchini blossoms by necessity but followed everything else pretty closely. The onions can be very sweet. If you have lots of zucchini and need a venue....

Great recipe! I did alter it a bit; I didn't have zucchini blossoms (so I left them out), and I already had zucchini marinading overnight in the fridge in lemon juice, oil, salt and pepper left over from another recipe, which I'm glad I used because it really gave a lot of flavor. I didn't use cheese because it wasn't listed in the ingredients and I didn't know which type to use -- it was great without.

Yes this is a good dish - he recipe was poorly written ingredients did not state the need for cheese or parsley...and it was much more effective to saute the suchini blossoms at the very end instead of half way through proceedings. I did not add all ingredients to the pasta at the very end, I tossed them all together in a large pasta dish.

This recipe is excellent! I grow zucchini in my garden, so I only picked five blossoms - I think that is enough for four servings. It's a great summeer dish and I will definitely make it again.

add a little basil, parsley and parmigiano-reggiano to the mix... not a bad little easy-to-make dish

my sister in-law made this as a vegetarian menu for my husband, it was very good. The key is to have a real caramelized onion. (now, we make it without zucchini blossom, it is still good.) Easy, simple and dilicious.

Eh. I was underwhelmed which was a bummer because I had high hopes for this recipe. It was OK, but I would most likely not make again.

Really delicious! I plan to make this again, although outside of summer might be tricky. I didn't want to spend a lot on the zucchini blossoms, especially since I'd never used them before, so I went to my farmers' market toward the end and got a great deal on what was left. Overall, great flavor from the carmelized onions, tomatoes and red pepper flakes. I had some tri-color penne around, which worked very well with the colorful veggies. Yum!

I am going to send this one to friends to make because it was so delicious. I don't know how it would be dry and bland? The carmalized onions along with the juice from the zucchini made it moist and flavorful.

Dry, bland, uninteresting. I threw the left-overs away.

This recipe is absolutely delicious. I made it without the zucchini blossoms and it was perfectly good. It has a very pleasing mix of sweetness from the caramelized onions and hotness from the peppers. Definitely a scrumptious recipe great for summer or any other time of year and I would certainly make it again without hesitation.

Easy to make. So good! I also used farmers market ingredients. I will definitely make this again. Would be delicious even without zuchinni blossoms when not in season.

Excellent!!! I used fresh heirloom baby zucchini from the farmers market - which made the dish even better. Healthy, tasty, and quick to make - I will definitely make this one again.
