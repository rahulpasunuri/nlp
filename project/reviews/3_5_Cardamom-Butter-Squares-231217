Because of allergies, I made an egg-and butter-free version of these cookies, and the taste was excellent. I am sure the original version is a little bit lighter in consistency, but the denseness did not bother my family (who have no allergies). I substituted 2 Tbsp. canola oil and 3 Tbsp. unsweetened applesauce for the eggs. I also added two Tbsp. coconut milk (the beverage kind in a carton, not the canned thicker version). The coconut flavor is undetectable. For the butter I substituted the same amount of non-hydrogenated palm oil shortening (Spectrum Organic All-Vegetable Shortening, found here in Georgia at Whole Foods and Kroger).Because I wanted to bake the cookies right away, I hand-rolled them into balls instead of chilling and slicing the dough. I baked at 350 for 14-18 minutes depending on how large the balls were; the batch made approx. 34 cookies. There would have been more if family had not eaten some of the raw dough! The cardamom flavor was dominant and very tasty. Because I cannot have chocolate, I only made the coffee icing, substituting coconut milk for the cow's milk, but did not feel it really enhanced the cookies. I think next time I might try making some into thumbprint cookies and using some lingonberry jam.

i just made these for the 4th consecutive year. i always triple the cardamom because i love it. if you've had problems with them hardening, make sure you don't overbeat them. i use a plastic ketchup bottle to swirl the chocolate on them, and i omit the espresso icing. this is one of my favorite cookies of all time.

I doubled the cardamom like others suggested, and it's definitely pronounced. Otherwise, this was a fairly easy cookie, with big flavor payoff!

Also, the melted chocolate melts the plastic bag when you pour it in. Not sure how to get around that one.

Within 15 minutes of being out of the oven, these cookies turned hard and crispy. "Rich and buttery" - is not how I'd describe them.

I made these cookies for a cookie exchange. I doubled the cardamom with great results, wanted a pronounced cardamom flavor. I didn't make the espresso glaze but did drizzle the chocolate. They would have tasted good plain but they look plain too. They turned out crisp and tasty. I will make these again next year as part of my holiday cookies. It does take time to square off but I didn't have much trouble keeping the shape while cutting. Just touched up a little with my finger, I used a sharp knife on very cold dough. yum!

I made these to fit in gift box for friends. The taste is great, doubled the spices per another's suggestion. Spent a lot of time squaring up the edges of the log only to have them flatten when cut. Next time I may roll out the dough and use a knife to cut square pieces.

Very yummy, adult indeed, great with Chai tea, just enough spice and richness - a little less rich than a true shortbread. And if you follow directions, you do get about 72 (great for sharing with friends or as gifts over the hollies) and they are also bite-size, which is another bonus when the holidays are so full of unhealthy treats...I will make these regularly. Did the espresso drizzle (not really icing) on about 1/2 of them to good effect.

A very adult and delicious cookie. The only problem is that the cookies stick to the cookie sheet in spite of following the directions. Next time I will remove the cookie from the cookie sheet immediately (not allowing for the 3 minutes cooling as called for int he directions) or will use parchment paper to line cookie sheets.

Rating: 4
Very good cookies. The fact that they are not overly sweet is appealing. I cooked on a baking sheet with parchment paper and had no sticking problems. Easy to slip onto a cooling rack that way as well.

This is a FABULOUS cookie off the beaten path. I doubled the cardamom, simply because I found other cardamom butter cookie recipes with twice as much, and it was a favorite among the cookies I made for Thanksgiving. I would absolutely make these for Christmas gifts. :)

I'm going to try increasing the spices next time. With a bittersweet chocolate icing they aren't bad (I skipped the espresso icing), but just plain they seem rather boring. I didn't bother to shape and refrigerate the dough. If you own a cookie press, the dough presses through perfectly without chilling, which is much simpler although you end up with a more fancy looking cookie.

Rating: 3
Very tasty. I didn't roll out logs, chill and slice into squares, I simply rolled the warm mixture into balls and pressed flat on the baking tray with the tines of a fork and they came out beautifully. Added more spices and was pleased with the flavour.

I really like these cookies, I made them twice already this holiday season! The first time, I used the chocolate icing and the second time, I doubled all the spices and didn't use icing and I liked them much better plain with extra spices.

Rating: 3
While I agree that this is an easy recipe, I had a couple of challenges, not the least of which was that the cookies stuck to the baking sheet that I used! I'm guessing that I must have done something wrong...they taste very good, but for the second batch I had to grease the cookie sheet and remove the cookies from it the second that it came out of the oven to keep them from cracking apart. Suggestions?

these cookies are the bom. even without the icings which im usually too lazy to bother with.

I have made these every year since the recipe was published and they are a hit every time. This is more of an adult cookie, not too sweet. I make the cookies exactly as the recipe prescribes; the square shape is easier to achieve by using a ruler to get the dough into the square log shape before chilling. I used both icings for the beautiful decorative effect. These are my personal favorites. Cardamom is my absolute favorite spice!!!1

Most people here aren't familiar with cardamom but I found these delicious! I would add a bit more cardamom next time as it's very subtle once baked (raw dough is yummy). I made an orange icing and drizzled it across the tops instead of the icings indicated. These are unique, buttery and easy to make.

Rating: 4
Wow! These were very good. They have a very nice texture especially if you don't overcook them. I did double the spices, and made them pretty small and baked them for 10 minutes- until just barely brown on the edges (check them by 8 minutes or so). They were perfect. I see no reason to use the icing except for decoration purposes.

Mmmmmmmm. Cardamom's one of my favorite spices, and these cookies just hit all the right spots. Hard to stay away from them!

I made these for the first time and got good reviews from friends. I didn't bother fussing to make them squares, because they taste just as good as circles :) Very good with coffee or tea, as they're a simple, not-too-sweet cookie.

The flavours are nice but the cookie itself is disappointing. I found the espresso icing overpowered the cardamom, so chocolate icing is enough.

Rating: 3
These are delicious and unusual; in my mind I can't stop referring to them as chai cookies. Not everyone will love these flavors, but they are really fine cookies nonetheless. I used freshly ground cardamom and allspice, which I think made all the difference in producing a rich flavor. They are crisp and tender the first day, and get softer as the days go by, but the flavors mellow together more. Next time I will be a little more perfectionistic with squaring off the corners of the logs; mine turned out more like lozenge shapes.

I have just made these for the 3rd year in a row. Many have commented that this is an "adult" cookie, and while the adults really enjoy them, they are also a favorite of my 4 year old son (also when he was 3 and 2). The icing is definately key-- and not diffiuclt at all. I line up all the cookies edge to edge on the cooling racks, then take the icings, with a steady stream flowing, move in lines across (for one icing) then up and down (for the other) across all the cookies. A bit of mess to clean up afterwards, but I can ice all 90 some cookies (it makes a lot!) in less than 5 minutes.

I absolutely loved this recipe! I would definitely agree with other reviewer's ~ definitely an adult cookie. Great with out the icing or even with a dusting of the powdered sugar and with walnuts or pistachios in the mix.

I'm 14, but a very enthusiastic baker & dessert maker. I made these for my sudo-dad for his work, and the espresso, dark chocolate, cardamom mix worked perrfectly. and even my teenage brother who's extremely picky like these, with or without the topping. However, I only used a spoon to drizzle the melted chocolate over, as even after letting cool slightly, it melted the plastic decorating bag I tried to put it in. Also, I found the entire process to make the shape long and involved, so i split it into 2 halves and rolled them out, about 1/4 inch thick, on a floured surface. I then cut out the squares using a small tupperware container, but you can use any cookie-cutter or glass, upside down. it seemed to work well, though i must admit you had to put plenty of flour on the roller to stop it sticking. Anyway you do these, they're fabulous for all!

I followed the advice of several viewers and increased the amount of cardamom (I used 3 tsp). Also, after reading another cardamom cookie recipe which called for chopped walnuts, I decided to add nuts to half just to see how they turned out. I used pecans chopped fairly fine. These are probably "adult" cookies, but not boring as I was expecting! They are very good, and will make a nice dessert with tea or coffee. Again, on the advice of other reviewers (and the fact that I'm not a big fan of coffee-flavored things), I chose to decorate with the chocolate only. They look very elegant and should even travel well (will package in a holiday tin and send as gifts to family). I would say these were a pleasant surprise, I'm always looking for a good staple, and this is it. Also, very easy (I made the dough a night ahead, very convenient).

Extremely easy to make..HUGE hit at a holiday cocktail party! Use a ruler as suggested to make the logs even. I had no problems getting even sqaures out of the logs. Watch the time in the oven - they can brown easily.

SPECTACULAR! My new favorite. Used freshly ground cardamom and upped the spices by 50%. Good quality chocolate makes a difference.

These taste really great, and with the icings they look great too. But without them they are just beige blobs - pretty unspectacular when served with other Christmas cookies. I take my hat off to anyone who can make a perfect square out of these.

these biscuits were sensational, i doubled the spice and left it in the refrigerator overnight before baking, and instead of espresso icing, i just melted a dark terry's chocolate orange and drizzled it over the bickkies. FANTASTIC!

Absolutely deicious, easy to make, and a real hit. Slice the dough really thinly to achieve super-crisp squares. The icing is well worth doing, and tastes and looks superb. I made the dough a week ahead and froze it, and still have loads left, which I cant wait to use! Yum Yum Yum.

the success of this cookie depends on its context. It does not hold its own on the rich, sweet Christmas platter. But alone, with afternoon tea or coffee, it's great - very different. Don't skip the icings - the presentation is inviting.

Definitely a 'grown up' cookie. Not your average... sophisticated. I think I'll up the spices next time, too.

I made these to accompany the pears poached in red wine, orange and cardamon, also from this site. Both were very good. Instead of the chocolate glaze I used white chocolate. When drizzled along with the espresso glaze, it looked very pretty.

Easy to make, nice and simple-sweet with a cup of tea. I mixed the two glazes together, making a sort of mocha glaze. They tasted as expected - not spectacular, but certainly worth the trouble. I really enjoy the cookie recipe (by itself) from the CORNMEAL-COOKIE SUNDAES WITH WARM FRUIT recipe on this site - the cornmeal makes them extra crunchy.

These took a little effort make the perfect square, but they looked great on my dessert buffet table, but other than that they were easy and they stayed fresh-tasting and looking for days. I love the taste of cardamon and would put a little more of the spice next time I make them. They were a big hit with my crowd.

My experience was totally different. Everyone thought these cookies were marvelous. Friends have asked for the recipe! I used cardamom I had stored in the freezer and ground it and the allspice in a mortar and pestle just before making the cookies. They were good without the frosting but really great with both the coffee and the chocolate. I did use espresso powder in it. They are on my permanent list of Christmas cookies!

These were such a disappointment. I agree that using only the chocolate glaze might help--but they were not the superlative cookies I was expecting.

Expected a much better result with all the raving reviews but for the price of cardamom and the not so outstanding flavor I don't think I will make these again. They are an okay cookie, but did not stand a chance against the other Christmas cookies made this year.

Very good--much better w/ONLY chocolate. Everyone who tasted the ones with the espresso agreed it that the coffee flavor detracted from the taste of the cardamom, whereas the chocolate enhanced it.

YUM! I make a large tray of adult cookies for each of my clients every year - keep trying to stop, but about October they start hinting! This cookie was definitely the HIT this year - I think freshly-ground spices are essential for a bright, complex flavor. Don't know what Chai spices the other person used, but you might look up a recipe online - just put "Chai spices" into Google and look until you find a combination that sounds appealing.

Easy-to-handle dough. The cookies stay crisp and the mocha and chocolate squiggles stay put. Definitely a keeper.

This is a nice recipes, but I definitely would not classify it as amazing. It's certainly not a kid-pleaser. The cardamom adds a nice depth of flavor and the presentation can be lovely with the drizzled icings. The cookie cuts very easily after the dough has been chilled. Slightly thicker slices make the cookie taste more like shortbread. It's a nice, adult cookie.

These were delicious.They remind me of the pepperidge farm bordeaux cookies I used to eat years ago. Next time I make them I will up the spices especially the cardamom.Slicing them thin makes a great crisp cookie but thicker slices were also good and tasted like shortbread. T he dough keeps very well in the fridge I think the extra day of chilling I gave it intensified the flavor.

These cookies were a sinch to make since you can freeze the dough and bake when needed. The dough was a little sticky, so I used wax paper instead of plastic wrap to form the logs. Mine didn't turn out nearly as pretty and square as the picture, but they were really scrumptous. A different sort of Christmassy taste, these were perfect on a cookie plate at my holiday dinner party. yum.

The new favorite this year! As always, doubled the spices. Very pretty squiggling icing in different modernist patterns. Wish I'd discovered this BEFORE my cookie swap last week! But now I already have next year's contribution ...

These are really great cookies, and they turned out a beautiful color. Making the square logs, and trying to slice them without squishing the squares, was more trouble than it was worth. Next time I think I'll try chilling them in flat sheets and cutting squares with a knife.

I made these for a cookie swap and they were by far the favorites. They look so pretty and have a great, unique flavor that even my kids love (plain or iced). I was sked for the recipie by several women, and of course told them to come to the web site! I did change the recipe a little: subbed almond extract for 1/2 the vanilla; ground up chai-tea spices and subbed them for 1/2 the cardamom. I think I went heavy on the icing as well. Had to make an extra batch of each (but I did triple the cookie recipe so maybe that shanged things). Made more than 60 cookie per batch. YUM
