I have made this salad the first month it was published. It is a family/friend favorite. I get asked to bring it to potlucks. Love it, Love it.

Love lentils, but didn't like the salad.

I just can't imagine why anyone would choose this over traditional Waldorf Salad. I certainly wouldn't make it again, and I'm sorry I made it the first time.

I wasn't crazy about it with the first taste, but it does taste better after it sits for a few hours. Definitely too much mayo. I went with 1/3 cup low fat mayo and doubled on the celery.

I added some dried currants and substituted roasted walnuts; this waldorf was tasty. It seems a little odd, but the lentils do provide a good taste contrast to the apples (and up the nutritional value). Try it!
