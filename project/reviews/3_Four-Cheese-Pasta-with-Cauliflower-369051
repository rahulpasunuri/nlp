The flavors come together very nicely here. But trying to create a white sauce with cream cheese instead of butter was a very lumpy challenge.

Perfect for kids. Yummy. Short cuts... buy the shredded mixed mexican cheese.

Unfortunately, this recipe did not come out well for me. While the sauce was fairly good (though needed more seasoning), it all became very bland when I mixed the pasta, sauce, and cauliflower together. Plus the texture became a thick mass, which was not appetizing. I made this for a small Oscar gathering (we were having a vegetarian potluck) so I had to serve it to guests, even though I was not a fan of the final outcome. I think if I made this again, I would instead roast the cauliflower with some curry seasoning (I love a little curry spice in many dishes), make sure to salt the pasta water more while cooking, and make the sauce with more milk so that it doesn't become lumpy. It would no longer be a healthy recipe, but at least it would have more flavor.

My husband and I absolutely love this recipe! It's a great way to use cauliflower, which neither of us usually eat.
