This sauce is so easy and so delicious. I added a touch of cinnamon and it was even better. I used it on top of an almond pound cake and it worked very well.

I just got this recipe in my inbox today....and as I'm hosting a baby shower this week, I was looking for something a little more interesting than chocolate sauce to go on my coconut cake. AND I happened to have frozen peaches and rasberries in my freezer so I went for it!....and although this compote would be even more spectacular with fresh fruit, it is sufficiently divine with frozen. I can't wait to try it with the cake!!
