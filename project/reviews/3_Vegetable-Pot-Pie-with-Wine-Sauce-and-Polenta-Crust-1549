This was a very good recipe but a little potato heavy. I used the veggies I had in the fridge (no peppers but parsnips for example) and really enjoyed it. Will make again but will halve the amount of potatoes and substute winter squash maybe. Oh and add some celery to lighten it up flavor wise.

I don't know... a lot of chopping and I wasn't crazy about it. I liked the wine sauce. Something in the mix was bitter...I used a combo of rutabega and baby turnips for the 2 rutabega and I'm assuming one of those or both is the culprit. I used a different polenta recipe, so it never solidified. It's edible, but very unappetizing in appearance. I won't make again.

I made this years ago and really liked it...but I haven't made it since. It is a bit time consuming, but definitely worth trying out! It's a good group project--if you have a small group of friends you want to keep engaged and occupied, make this with them!

I've been making this every year since the recipe was first printed and love it! I've changed the veggies depending on what's on hand with great results every time. I've served for casual dinners where some guests were vegetarians and some not, but all were pleased.

This is a really great recipe IF you like the veggies in it. Rutabagas/turnips are not everyone's cup of tea. My husband liked the dish although he won't come within a mile of rutabagas/turnips--and I've used either one at different times in the recipe. My only change to the recipe is to use a combo of a biscuit-cornmeal topping instead of the polenta, which was kinda bland. I will continue to make this dish since it is one of the few all-veg dishes my family and other diners enjoy.

It could be that people who didn't like this recipe used the wrong wine. I can see how that would overwhelm the taste of the veggies. I used a dry but fruity organic wine. Rave reviews all around. Stick with the spices and don't be afraid to throw in some additional root vegetables.

for a pastry top: Position 1 rack in top third of oven and place baking sheet on bottom rack in oven; preheat to 400°F. Roll out crust dough on parchment paper to 15x10 1/2-inch rectangle. Using paper as aid, turn dough over onto filling. Trim dough overhang; tuck dough edge inside dish. Roll out dough scraps to 1/4-inch thickness. Cut out leaf shapes. Brush bottom of cutouts with water and place on crust; cut slits in crust to allow steam to escape. Place pot pie on top rack and bake until crust is golden and gravy is bubbling, about 50 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.

I am surprised at how many people did not enjoy this receipe. I have been making it since it came out, and everyone has loved it. My only suggestion is to be certain to season the vegetables well. I also enjoy using beef broth instead of vegetable in the wine sauce, of course, don't fo that if you have vegetarians coming! I also add whatever veggies look good at the market, I especially love parsnips. Definitley one of my keepers.

I've been making this since the recipe first appeared and my family loves it. I've made it for company when part of the group were vegetarians and everyone loved it.

excellent main meal meatless substitute. If you don't like polenta, use pie crust instead which is really great.

This was good, but definitely nothing to rave about. Despite the mixed reviews, I love roasted veggies and thought I could tweak it a bit. I roasted whole garlic cloves with the veggies, used a turnip instead of rutabegas. I also used fresh chopped rosemary, parsley and sage instead of herbs de provence. I think the recipe makes more wine sauce than needed. Overall, it's like a delicate sort of comfort food, but I'd rather go back to making my easy roasted veggies. This was a lot of work and looked nice, but I wouldn't make it again.

this is a great meatless dish for Lent. I made it for a party once and everyone enjoyed it and several requested the recipe. it was worth the effort.

I made this recipe for a potluck. I had mixed reactions. There is no middle of the road, either you like or you won't. It isn't the traditional American sytle pot pie with all of the fat and pastry. It's delicate with herbs and the wine sauce substitutes for the gravy. It's definitely more of an European type of dish that can either be a main course or a side dish. The recipe makes a sizeable amount. I used the suggestion of the frozen peas/pearl onions and it worked great. I loved the idea that the fat and cholesterol were low.

This recipe needs some help, here is what I did. Added more cheese 5 tbps not 1, Polenta really needs to cook for 25 minutes not 15 (followed the directions for cooking length on box of corn meal. The result was a polenta very close to corn bread, at 15 minutes is was flat. Added more liquid (broth) to vegetables. Also recipe spices are so so, made it more mid-east with cumin, curry

wow, I'm glad I read the reviews so I won't bother with this one. Try the root vegetable cobbler recipe; it's outstanding.

This recipe was horrible. The ingredients looked great, but the combination was unappetizing. It does not work.

I hated this dish. Not only did I throw out the dish I threw UP the dish. I was tempted to throw out the dish and redo my kitchen in order to get all of the smells out of it. I almost sold my house! I would never make this dish again!

This recipe was also a huge disappointment for me. I really disliked the flavor of the sauce. I too forced myself to eat it and ended up throwing 2/3 of it out...which I hate to do! It would be easy enough to revise this...pick your own veggies, sauce and it could be a hit.

This recipe was a huge disappointment. It did not taste as good as it sounded. We forced ourselves to eat some of it because it took so long to prepare. Ultimately we ended up throwing most away.

This was wonderful ! Very easy. Could be used as a side dish or a main dish alone. I added frozen peas that have pearl onions included to simplify.

Rating: 3
This recipe is certainly worth the effort. I didn't blanch the onions first, just roasted them, because I don't like boiled onions, and I didn't use peas because not everyone in my house likes them. It keeps well in the refrigerator, and tastes just as good reheated the next day. The sauce is the key to this dish, choose a hearty wine.

This recipe was not as good as it looked and it was time consuming particularly in the preparation of the vegetables.

The secong time I made this recipe I had to eliminate all added fat for a guest with dietary restrictions and it was just as delicious

I USED REGULAR YELLOW ONION,SLICED AND TURNIPS INSTEAD OF POTATOES. THE WINE IS VERY IMPORTANT SO DON'T SKIMP. THIS IS DELIGHTFUL AND I GOT RAVE REVIEWS FROM THE FAMILY!

We've made this recipe at least a dozen times for friends and family (always with rave reviews)We like to substitute chicken or beef broth for the vegetable broth, and we sometimes add tomatoes to the vegie mixture.

We've made this about 5 times now. It is very tasty. Each time we used a clay pot to cook it in.
