I have made this great pilaf many times. It's a greast pot-luck dish and I've received many kudos for it.

My husband and I really enjoyed this pilaf. I took the suggestions of others and used all chicken broth, added peas instead of zucchini/yellow squash, and substituted pine nuts for the slivered almonds. It nicely complimented the more complex flavors of the Halibut with Red Bell Pepper and Olive Relish I served it with (also from this website).

Easy to make and very tasty. Even my husband who is not a pilaf fan enjoyed it and asked me to make it again.

Excellent. Easy. Definately use all broth, no water.

Like home made Rice-a-Roni with veggies. I used all chicken broth and substituted toasted pine nuts for the almonds. Seemed more flavorful the next day, so don't worry if you have left overs. A nice place to put gravy if you're tired of potatoes. Will make again.

Absolutely delicious and flavorful. I used yellow squash which gave it a buttery flavor. I even reheated it the next day with some salsa and served it with a Mexican dish. Very vesitile, I look forward to trying it with other vegatables. My husband mentioned several times to please hold on to this recipe.

I loved the creaminess of this dish. I added all low-sodium chicken broth and it still needed salt because it is a wee bland. What a great way to eat lots of different vegies! I think I'm going to serve it with the fish in parchment paper from the April 2008 Bon Appetit.

Rice Pilaf is not supposed to be a bold part to your meal. However, I could understand how some may feel is could be bland. Definately use ALL chicken broth. Replace the water with it. Use more garlic if your prefer. My children do not like zucchini, so I used peas at the end. It's a nice easy side dish for any night that is casual. Will definately make it again.

I forgot to add that I skipped the zucchini since I added the peas and mushrooms.

I made this last weekend and everyone liked it. I used homemade chicken broth which had been seasoned, so that probably added to the flavor of the dish. I addition, I microwaved two packages of steam-in- the-bag peas and mushrooms and added them to the finished dish. I served it with grilled babyback ribs.

I don't get all the bad press on this recipe....it's a really good side dish! I've made it at least 5 times already this summer, and everyone loves it. If you think it's bland, throw in a chicken boullion cube, or more garlic. When I serve this, there's never any left!

Excellent with these modifications: 1) instead of white rice I used Trader Joe's Brown Rice Medley (brown rice, black barley & daikon radish seeds) and cooked that separately since that takes a while to make. If you do this make sure to halve the liquid for the orzo! 2) I omitted celery since I had none. 3) I forgot to add almonds but I think the brown rice provided enough texture. 4) I added the zest of one lemon. I think what really made the dish was the brown rice, lemon & parsley. Also, it's important to cook the orzo al dente to prevent it from being mushy. I served this with pork chops italian style and it made a fabulous side. If you add chick peas and sun-dried tomatoes, this makes a great lunch!

Despite the amount of veggies and garlic I put into this dish, it was still a little bland. I even put some bell peppers in, but I think what the pilaf really needed was a ton more garlic and maybe some more fresh herbs. Not sure if I would try it again, because I really couldn't put my finger on the missing ingredient.

A great hit at a recent dinner party. I didn't have orzo so I doubled the rice, I also added in some extra veggies. Don't skip the parsley or almonds, they make the dish.

This was a real surprise hit. Instead of using white rice, I used a great dark wild rice - I started it before the rest of the dish so it would be ready in time. It really kicked it up a notch and kept it from being too mushy, I think - the almonds were a nice touch as well. Like a previous poster, I added a little extra garlic, cause that's the way my family likes it :)

crowd pleaser for kids! Great way to sneak veggies into the meal. I found that the basmati rice on hand required a longer cooking time than the orzo - so next time I would start the rice and veggies 10 minutes ahead of the orzo. It's ok to leave out the zucchini, and substitute almonds with either pistachios or pepitos.

This recipe was great. We didn't find it bland but I did use salted butter and a vegetable broth that was salted. My kids (boys 8 and 11)loved it and said "make it again".

Needed to have a little extra salt and garlic for my taste- Was a great size for fish and meat.

I served this dish at a recent family birthday gathering where it garnered plenty of complements. Be sure to add the almonds; they make the dish. And don't skimp on the vegetables. I'll be adding this recipe to my permanent collection.

Boy is this bland ? I increased the salt, pepper, used a high quality organic chicken stock but nothing did it. I would not bother making this again, there are plently of good pilaf recipes out there.

This dish turned out very well. The whole family enjoyed it. A great way to get kids to eat their veggies. :) I used a yellow squash instead of the zucchini. I will be making this dish again in the future.

Have made this twice already and will definitely make again. The first time I followed the recipe exactly, but the second time I used mushrooms instead of zucchini and it was also very good. The almonds are a nice touch. I served it once with pork tenderloin and once with roasted chicken and it was a great accompaniment to both. It was also good heated up the next day.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone raved about how good it was. I increased the salt to taste, used a yellow squash. I would definately use this recipe again.

I made this recipe for my family thinking it was a healthy alternative to pasta with the veg on the side. It wasn't terrible, but it was bland and nothing special. Not worthwhile.

Quick and easy. Other than the zucchini all of the other ingredients you'll probably have on hand. Nice change from plain white rice and a nice accompaniment to a variety of dishes.
