I have trid this on tuna and Salmon and I think it is much better with Salmon. Got rave reviews from all of my family when I had it on Salmon. Doubled the marinade and aioli for 4 and a 1.25 lb piece of salmon

Fabulous and easy!

This was a surprise, even though I'd read through the great reviews...I didn't think the marinade would really come through with any flavor. It did, though - even without the aioli, the tuna was flavorful. I'd like to figure out how to make the aioli more liquidy without changing the taste, because it tasted terrific, I'd just like to be able to 'artfully drizzle' it as another reviewer put it. In any case, a keeper. I'll definitely make it again.

This is my go to summer entertaining recipe. Agree that the aioli should be served on the side. I was born and bred in the South and every time there I stock up on DUKE's mayonnaise. I served this with the Farmstand Tomato Soup with Arugula pesto as a starter and everyone raved.

Excellent - definitely a keeper

I love this recipe. It's easy, flavorful, and always is a hit. In a pinch, I use the italian herb mix that is packaged in a tube for the aioli. Be careful about not overcooking the tuna.

The sauce was only OK as was the marinade, however it only needs to cook 2 minutes a side. I used big eye tuna at $20 lb and it was overcooked at 3 minutes per side.Would not make this one again.

Plates much more elegantly than the time it took to prepare - big plus for those looking to pull off a dinner party on short notice or just scant of time. Prefer serving the aioili on the side as some like it caloric and others.. (well pity them their diets, I suppose) and its viscosity doesn't lend well to an artful drizzle anyway. I strayed just one ingredient from the recipe adding about 1 tsp of lemon juice to the aioli per 2 servings, and found the addition a welcome note of brightness. highly recommend the adjustment, though I'm sure it's very good without. This one's going into the "recipe box" for sure.

I'm going to add the same comments as everyone else. This is a fantastic, easy dinner. I have no other recipe that is as delicious and as straight-forward. We eat this as often as we can in the summer; we can't get enough of it!

Excellent! And simple to make.

Rating: 3
The fish was delicious but when I eat fresh fish I want to be healthy. I will not waste my time and calories on the aioli again. Plus the aioli drowned out the flavor of the fish. I am thinking of how to modify the marinade to use it as the sauce as well. Perhaps adding lemon and dill.

Rating: 4
The aioli alone is worth this recipe. Made it with Tilapia fillets and lemon instead of taragon, but it was still fabulous. Made steamed fingerling potatoes tossed in oil and white wine and those were awesome with the aioli as well. Saving this one in the ol virtual recipe box.

My husband raved about the sauce and said he could drink it, it was that good. On a scale of 1-4, he gives this recipe a 5. This is the first time I've used tarragon, and it was delicious! I made the amount of sauce called for, but used only two steaks - had plenty of leftovers. I'm going to use the leftover sauce on turkey sandwiches at lunch.

Rating: 4
One of my go-to recipes. I have made it with tuna multiple times, using every iteration of fresh/dried herbs, and it is always great! Today I made it with fresh caught Swordfish; it was equally delicious (and I'm not a huge swordfish fan). I halve the garlic b/c my husband doesn't like it, and double the marinade/aioli overall. He loves this dish - doesn't even complain about the garlic!

Rating: 4
I loved this recipe because it was so simple yet so good. It is the kind of meal you can have during the week. What makes it so special is the aioli dressing on the side. My advice is to double up on the aioli dressing. It is so good that it is not enough for the 4 steaks.

Rating: 4
I've made this 4-5 times. Absolutely wonderful. We're lucky to be on the Carolina coast and get incredibly fresh tuna, and this recipe is so simple and perfect! Make some extra (both tuna and aioli) and make some wonderful tuna salad the next day. Heaven!

Absolutely fantastic marinade and aioli. We were unable to grill it so the tuna came out a bit like incredibly tender chicken breast, but the flavors made up for it. Will definitely sear it on the grill next time!

I have made this before, but made it recently with just dried herbs because I was too lazy to go to the store. This is a delicious grilled tuna recipe and the aioli makes it - don't skip. If you want salad nicoise, make the Grilled Tuna Salad Nicoise on this site from Gourmet, 2003 - it is the best!

I usually sub. fresh tarragon for dried. Works great in the broiler with previously frozen tuna, too. We even used leftover aioli on turkey hash cakes the other day--whole new level. This is a great go-to, quick and easy.

This was great! I had some tuna that a coworker had brought in from a fishing trip. I didn't have many herbs, just basil and it was yummy! I didn't make the aioli but used the tuna in a makeshift nicoise salad by adding hard boiled eggs and blanched green beans to spring mix. Such a great salad at the end of summer!

This was truly exceptional. Make sure not to overcook! I used all sorts of fresh herbs from my garden, and made grilled portobello mushrooms and green beans to go along with it. The tuna was pricey, but worth ever cent.

Who doesn't love a simple, delicious recipe that enhances the flavor of the food? I don't usually care for mayonnaise but the aioli is so good it makes you want to think what else it will complement.

Excellent marinade. Very easy and fast to make. Don't skimp on the marinating time though. I put a little bit of crushed pepper in with mine, then topped the grilled fish with a roasted corn salsa (also really easy to make and very tasty) instead of aioli. Wonderful and healthy.

Rating: 4
This is a wonderful recipe - easy enough for a weeknight, special enough for company. With such a simple preparation, quality of ingredients is key. I used all fresh herbs, good quality oil and vinegar, and of course top quality tuna -- though I agree with other reviewers that this recipe would work well with other fish. I plan to try it with grilled shrimp in the summertime. We served it with fingerling potatoes and a mixed green salad with a Meyer lemon - shallot vinaigrette, which were perfect in combination with the tuna. Next time I'll add a green vegetable.

Made this with frozen tuna steaks from Trader Joe's that had been in the freezer for awhile, just trying to use them up in something that could be done on a gas grill on a warm night. It's so wonderful that next time I will splurge on fresh tuna and it will probably rate 5 forks at least. Used all fresh herbs from my garden (why use dried tarragon if fresh is available??) and it was amazing. Marinade is absolutely perfect, and even though the aioli is addictive the fish is superb without it. Can't wait to try it again!

Rating: 4
It started with the aioli - it was so good I forgot about the fish for a minute and was just standing in my kitchen eating swipes of mayonnaise. I never do that. I took lots of liberties with this recipe, mostly because of last minute (non)planning and a lack of ingredients. Doubled the garlic, made up the 2nd half of the vinegar with a balsamic/white combo, used parsley instead of tarragon. Regardless, this was the. best. fish. ever. Ever. Super delicious - I'm putting off brushing my teeth so I can continue to savor the flavor. Seriously. Thanks Epicurious, for a great recipe!

I loved this recipe... it was an easy and delicious marinade and sauce... didn't have the exact herbs excpet the thyme, so substituted the others with oregano and basil. Came out great and didn't take long to prepare. Served it with fried green plantains, which were also great with the herbed sauce.

Prepared this for the first time this evening. My husband is a picky eater - he will eat nothing on the bone. Also, it was his first time to eat tuna steak. Pan-seared the tuna on high heat 3 1/2 minutes per side. Served with steamed new potatoes & haricots vert. A winner - 4 forks, awesome.

Rating: 3
I used all fresh herbs because I have them, but I wouldn't hesitate to use dried thyme and tarragon (but fresh basil) if necessary. I pan-fried the tuna. Next time I'd leave a bit more pink in the middle. Although I made 2 tuna steaks with the full amount of marinade and aioli, if making 4 steaks, I'd double both. This is easy so long as you allow sufficient time to marinate, and it's delicious. I just realized I forgot to salt and pepper the tuna, didn't seem to matter!

Very easy, very good -- even the picky 11-year-old liked it. In deference to the 11-year-old's sensibilities, I grilled it about 5 minutes per side, but I would have been very happy to eat it after 3 minutes per side.

Just happens to be one of my favorite dishes ever! No joke. I used sashimi grae ahi. Make sure not to grill very long at all, should be red, red, red in center! All the chopping of the fresh herbs is worth it! Make this to impress!

I made this for my parents anniversary. I am 15 and it was really easy to make. I didn't have the tarragon but it still turned out wonderfully!! I would use the aioli on lots of other foods as well. I served the tuna with grilled baby eggplants and that worked really well with the fish. Enjoy!!

aioli was very good... would be yummy on a lot of meats. I didn't have time to marinate for more than 10 minutes, and decided to pan sear instead of grill... and the tuna came out very tasty. Would make again.

One of the most delicious tuna renditions I have ever had. Both the marinade and the aioli are fantastic. P.S.: I even used low-fat mayo.

Rating: 4
Awesome! I'm a personal chef, and while I'd normally make an aioli from scratch, I decided to try it with mayo, low-fat mayo no less, to see how it would work for my clients. It was fabulous, and my guests were exclaiming until the very last bite. I did double the marinade and sauce. The marinade needs to be increased, but if you double the aioli you'll have some left over for another dish - not a bad thing.

Rating: 4
What a great easy meal. The marinade is fantastic on tuna, halibut, swordfish... any grillable fish really! And that aioli made with lowfat mayo adds a touch of zing to any otherwise plain sandwich!

This turned out very well. I thought the aioli was a wonderful complement to the fish (Note: I did use dried herbs and it was still great). Hubby and kids ate just the fish, no aioli (they have a mayo issue), and they thought the fish was awesome by itself.

Love this aioli! It also makes a great dip for artichokes!

Rating: 4
Excellent flavor for such an easy preparation. Use fresh herbs only for maximum flavor. Other reviewers are right;3 minutes per side is way too long. I allowed 2 minutes per side for pretty thick fillets, and it was still a little overdone for my taste. Definitely a dish to make frequently.

Rating: 4
I LOVE this recipe!! The first time I made it, it was raining out so I made it in the oven. I cooked it a touch too long and also forgot to serve the aioli with it, and my guests STILL raved! The second time it was grilled just right and I remembered the aioli, and it was out of this world. I doubled the marinade/aioli recipe for 6 tuna steaks, and that was JUST the right amount, in my opinion. If I were to make this w/4 tuna steaks, I'd at least increase the marinade/aioli by 50%.

Yow. Excellent tuna, excellent aioli. We used low-fat mayo and even the non-health conscious couldn't tell the difference. We also used half the amount of oil in the marinade, with no loss of flavor or juiciness. It was delicious! We can't wait to make it again.

The marinade/aioli was quick and simple, and the herb combination was delicious. This would work well with other fish; swordfish or halibut especially. I doubled the aioli and marinade, (a single dollop is never enough and herbs are abundant this time of year). Perfect with a Cabernet Franc!
