We made this for Thanksgiving this year (2011) and it was an absolute hit - there was none left over. Easy and delicious - I'll be making this again next year.

I am, by no means, a cook...but I followed this recipe last year for Thanksgiving. It was a hit. I'm doing it again this year!...I love this website....I tell everyone I do from scratch. -Brian.

We just made this dish for Thanksgiving to rave reviews!! My first time I've ever contributed to Thanksgiving dinner so now I'm motivated to do more!

This will be back on my Thanksgiving table this year.

A good base and great mix of texture. I added a dollop of frozen orange juice (or you could increase the orange juice to maybe even that of a full orange) to the carrots and plenty of salt and little maple syrup to the final mash.

This was a winner at the familys' Thanksgiving dinner. I was asked to make it for Yule\Christmas as well. I'll use the pecans next time as the previous reviewer suggested.

Very easy to make and colorful dish. I used pecans instead of walnuts and added a few marshmellows for color on top. Delicious and a nice alternative to straight sweet potatoes.
