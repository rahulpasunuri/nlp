I'm a huge fan of lamb, but the glaze is a lot of work just to season the meat. It does add a great flavor to the meat though. I only applied it to the meat while it broiled and that seemed like enough. Skip the shallots. Excellent dish for Valentine's Night In ;)

The lamb chops per se were excellent, but the glaze was very mild and didnt really add much to them. A waste of good ingredients.

A terrific recipe. Tasty and fairly simple. Worthy of the guest menu at our house.

This glaze was amazing! I couldn't find unfiltered apple cider so I had to use a bottle of Bulmer's Irish cider but it still tasted fantastic.

I made this for our Valentine's Day feast with the apple frisee salad with cherries and walnuts. This was my first attempt at lamb and I was impressed with the easiness of the whole process. I used organic apple juice instead of cider (out of season, I guess!) but everything else was the same. I blended the glaze in the food processor before I put it on the stove to reduce, and afterwards, I strained it to get all the little bits of garlic and ginger out. The cooking time was spot-on -- 3 minutes on each side. Very quick and delicious. Served on top of mashed Parmesan potatoes. Husband kept talking about how good it was even the next morning!

This recipe is perfect as is! I grated my ginger using a Japanese ginger grater, which made it so smooth and creamy. Great Valentine's Day treat!

We really enjoyed the lamb chops for Valentines Day. We only had enough apple cider for half, so it needed a little bit of flavor, but I can imagine if we had all of it, it would have been really good.

Quite easy to make, and produces an amazingly flavorful result. Tartness of the soy sauce and vinegar in the glaze is well balanced by the cider and honey.

I forgot to mention that I used apple cider vinegar instead of the rice wine, because I was out. Delicious still!

I made these exactly as written and they were fantastic! I cooked my lamb chops to a nice med-rare and they were the juiciest and tastiest lambchops I've eaten so far. Great balance of flavors, sauce is perfect. Everything about this recipe is flawless! Just make sure not to overcook and use fresh ginger. You will be happy with these I promise!

I added 1/4 cup of organic brown sugar to the sauce and it turned into a beautiful glaze.

Easy, savory, felt like a splurge. The glaze was incredible. Served with wild rice and a pumpkin ale. We didn't have rice vinegar and it still turned out fine.

These were really good, we loved the sauce. I didn't have a problem with the sauce reducing, I just let it boil without the lid. I didn't reduce it quite as much as the recipe suggested at first. After I brushed the chops and broiled them, I boiled it down a bit more and then strained it before I drizzled it over the chops. Next time I think I'd also reserve some for dipping.

This was simple and excellent. A good combination of flavors. Can't wait to make it for dinner guests. We served it with an apple-squash bake from good ol' Betty Crocker. It was a wonderful meal.

Loved it! I'm generally not a lamb fan but my mom gave me some organic, grass-fed chops and has been asking me if I've cooked them yet. I used lots of fresh ginger and garlic and the flavor was wonderful. My sauce did not thicken, either, but it did not detract from the dish. I spooned it over the chops both times instead of basting since the excess could just drain out the bottom of the broiler rack. I kept cooking the sauce while the lamb broiled so that bit thickened up a little more for the pour-over. I served it with couscous and homemade cran-applesauce.

Followed the directions, but could not get the sauce to reduce to a glaze. Instead, the sauce remained in a liquid state. Any suggestions?

I've made this several times, and have used it to marinate lamb chops and pork chops - it's equally good with both. To the cook who could only taste soy and sweetness- make sure you use fresh ginger and not the bottled ginger. I find the pre-grated ginger is much less flavorful than fresh grated.

A stand-by in my household. These chops are easy and delicious

Sauce was disappointing, despite the investment of simmering time and all those delicious ingredients. In the end all you taste is soy sauce + non-specific sweetness. Consider try making it without soy sauce. I made a full recipe for 4 chops/2 people and barely had enough: suggest doubling.

Loved the flavor of the sauce/glaze but can someone suggest why it never turned into a glaze but remained in a liquid/watery state. I boiled it for 12 minutes, the quantity reduced but it never thickend like the photo shows it should. I want to make it again but please advise what I should do different to achieve the correct glaze consistancy. Add cornstarch???

AMAAAAZING sauce. I made 3 times the sauce and used it as a marinade for leg of lamb. Marinate for about 30 minutes and then broil it in the oven with a lot of onions and sliced potatoes and all the sauce for 15 min. at 450, then bring down to 350 and cook as appropriate to taste and size of lamb. DELICIOUS! =D

I wasn't crazy about the scallions on top. Also, it takes a long time to mince 2T of garlic (lots of cloves to peel). There were no rib chops at the store, so I used loin chops. Still good. Overall, tons of bang for the buck. Easy to make but will impress.

Wow, loved this sauce! I accidentally used seasoned rice vinegar (instead of the unseasoned that is called for), but it was still lip- smackin' good.

Made this for a birthday dinner for my Mom- was a big hit. Easy and nicely complements the flavor of lamb. Served it with sauteed spinach (Epicurious recipe). Will definitely make again.

I doubled the glaze and put it over a boneless pork loin, rather than the suggested lamb, which I then roasted over carrots. I also kept the garlic in slices rather than mincing it, so they roasted on top of the meat and added some terrific texture and depth. The reducing and roasting take a long time, but it's all hands off -- and remarkably delicious.

I'm sure this is a good recipe, but I'm puzzled why it shows up when I search for vegetarian recipes.

Though it took longer to reduce and the lamb was less carmelized than picture, the dish turned out very well. I served this with steamed green beans and roasted butternut squash. Boyfriend loved it so much that he took a pictured to send to his friends!

I love lamb chops. This recipe buried the flavor of the lamb with a big sauce that might be better with pork chops or ribs.

great recipe! so delicious! i had a thicker cut of lamb so it took a little longer to cook (about 7 minutes on each side). i would totally make it again...and again...and again!!!

This was quite the best 40 min meal i have ever had. Only thing different i did was rub some pepper with salt. Being from Louisiana we like just a little kick to every meal. Thanx!

My sister went on and on about these! They were delicious. Lamb didn't come out nearly as dark as the picture shown. Nevertheless they did carmelize well enough. I will definitely keep this in my easy-weeknight- meal repetoire.

Very good and super easy. It took me much longer than 12 minutes to reduce the glaze; also, I strained it after reducing. I'll definitely make this again.
