Used frozen flounder, browned the fennel a bit before adding onion as recommended by previous reviewer, and instead of rolling flounder, dipped in butter then dredged in bread crumbs and laid flat on top of sauce (also as per another reviewer.) Finished cooking with a minute or 2 under broiler to brown bread crumbs (I used panko) Came out delicious.

Add cayenne and red pepper flakes to the sauce to spice it up. Add Parmesan, salt and pepper directly to the breading mix (which is usually a combination of home made bread crumbs and panko) I've never rolled the fish. I always dip each filet in melted butter, then in the bread crumbs and lay them flat on top of the sauce

Good recipe! The only thing I would do differently is to brown the fennel a bit before adding the onions, since the onions browned before the fennel was softened. I used frozen flounder and it turned out very well using this recipe.

I put half of the sauce in the Vitamix to give it more of a creamy texture. Next time, I would consider adding a little more liquid, possibly cream, to give it a richer texture. Very delicious- especially those buttered bread crumbs.

Good basic recipe. I threw in canned baby carrots to give it more veggies. I don't understand why you have to bake it in the oven though. If you create the sauce in a large sauce pan then all you have to do it place the fish on top of the sauce (rolled up or not) and then cover and lower the flame. Took about ten minutes once the fish was in the pan and I didn't have to make the kitchen hot with the oven on (better for summer time cooking). I think next time I won't rinse the capers off - the vinegars spicy taste will add flavor.

this was delicious. I used fresh tomatoes, no fennel or capers. light and delicious for a summer evening.

This is a lovely dish. I already had everything to make this, minus the fennel. Which was fine, since my family doesn't like fennel. A great alternative to frying flounder.

First time I cooked real fish...used fresh snapper. Added kalamata olives and a few marinated sun dried tomatoes. My husband said it was as good and complex as anything we get at our best island restaurants. It was super easy. I was nervous about over cooking the fish so checked it often. I'll get better at that.

Absolutely Amazing! My roommate is allergic to onions and garlic, so I had to leave them out, but this had so much flavor that I hardly missed them! Will def make this again!

First, I should mention that I omitted the fennel bulb. I made the sauce 2 days ahead of time using an almost full quart jar of canned tomatoes. For preparing the fish I pressed the seasoned bread crumbs (sans soft butter) into the fish, then rolled them and put them on top of the cold-from-the-refrigerator sauce in a pyrex baking dish. I did not incorporate softened butter into the bread crumbs - I melted it and then dizzled it on top of the rolled fillets. Baked for 20 minutes and it was FABULOUS. Served with tiny pasta pellets and glazed carrots. I will make this again for extended family. Really good - and making the sauce ahead of time made it super quick and a better flavored sauce.

I LOVE this recipe! I've made it a few times now, halved it actually as I'm single. Pretty easy to do. You end up with a few diced tomatoes to put in the freezer but other than that, works well. I've only ever used sole and it's so tasty and healthy and easy. Love it and the left-overs, too. Next time I make it, I'm going to use my cast iron skillet and, once I've made the sauce, throw the fish on top and stick the whole thing in the oven. No need to use two pans!

I don't like fennel and forgot to add the capers. I used roasted tomatoes instead of canned and substituted a large zucchini for the fennel. I left out buttering and breading the fillets and served it over brown rice. I loved it and my neighbors loved it (they had so now I have leftovers for lunches.

This is a delicious as well as an easy recipe. It works equally as well as a weekday recipe (just make the sauce ahead of time) or an impressive dish for company. I love how forgiving this recipe is. If you don't like fennel, just double the onion. Good fresh tomatoes available? Just chop some up and throw them in the sauce. If you leave it in the oven a few minutes too long, no big deal; unlike other fish recipes, because of the tomato sauce, the fish doesn't dry out if it is a bit overdone. I always bake the fish flat rather than bother with rolling up the filets. Any white fleshed fish works just as well, including cod or tilapia. If you dip the filets in whisked egg, the bread crumbs adhere better. Really good in the summer with a side of corn pudding or sauteed corn.

Baked Flounder with Tomato Caper Sauce was delicious. It will be made again.

Having never cooked with fennel before, I was a bit apprehensive as I didn't want anything too much like licorice. But it was great---truly a "sophisticated" dish as another reviewer said. Petite diced tomatoes are a must, and I think you could make the sauce to go with any white fish. The placement of the breadcrumbs seemed awkward, but it all came out quite yummy in the end.

Rating: 4
This is truly a 4-fork recipe, and a great company dish. Very easy, very flavorful, and presents beautifully. I wouldn't change anything about the recipe (although we can never find 6-ounce fillets, and always end up using two 3-4 ounce fillets per person). But note: the total preparation time of 40 minutes is not accurate--the cooking time alone is 40 minutes! Add the chopping, washing and arranging of fish, mixing and placing of bread crumbs, and it's easily another 15-30 minutes.

We used turbot in stead of flounder, panko for bread crumbs, and didn't roll anything. We really enjoyed this recipe.

Quick and easy to make. This was a big hit when I made it. My brother, who typically doesn't like fish at all, really enjoyed it and finished every bit. I also laid the fish flat and topped it with breadcrumbs. Baked it for 20 minutes and it came out perfectly cooked and moist.

Delicious! Not tough to make and everyone in my family loved it. I would suggest using fewer tomatoes or at least use petite diced tomatoes and using more fennel bulb. I used Panko bread crumbs (all I had) and put them thru the blender to break down a little more...

This was very good and I will make again. My family really likes fried fish, but I am trying to make healthier meals. The bread-crumb- topping was great. I added an extra tablespoon of capers and of wine at the end. I think that helped keep the flavors from being "bland". This is a keeper, would be a great fish dish to serve guests. I would've given this 3 1/2 forks, but I couldn't figure out the 1/2 mark.

This has become a regular weekday dinner for us. At first, I thought it was so simple that it wasn't a company dish, but we had it as the main course in a traditional Italian 7 course Christmas Eve dinner and everyone loved it. We use 3/4 - 1 lb of flounder for the 1 recipe of sauce; substitute olive oil for butter in the bread crumb mixture; substitute 2 c chopped plum tomatoes for canned; lay filets flat over the prepared sauce and cover with a thin coat of bread crumbs. We will try rolling the filets someday.

This is a simple, sophisticated fish dish that seems to please everyone. I used fresh sole from the fish market instead of flounder and it worked well. I think the freshness of the fish makes a big difference.

Really really good. Our flounder was really fresh from our farmers market so that helped. Used cherry tomatoes but baked then in the oven first to intensify the flavor. Will probably increase the sauce quantities next time around.

Good,especially for a week night dinner. Amount of bread crumb mix was too much for the amount of fish, but I put in freezer for topping other dishes later. Used the fresh fennel this time, but will definitely consider the suggestion by other reviewers to substitute some celery and fennel side another time.

Loved the flavor of anise in the sauce! Will definitely make this again.

Relatively easy and quite tasty. Made it for the second time tonight and used diced tomatoes with green chiles for a little kick. I also added a little thyme and topped it with chopped scallions 5 minutes before the baking was finished. I prepared this without rolling the fish, but rather laying the fillets across the top both times I have made it and reduced the cooking time to about 15 minute. Well received by the whole family!

For those cooking for just 2 - here's a tip. Make the sauce as directed. Use just half of the sauce for two filets. Freeze the other half of the sauce. Next time you make it, just thaw your sauce in the microwave and proceed with the fish, breadcrumb topping and wine. I do this quite alot with various sauces and it's a real time/money saver when just cooking for two.

I used less salt, skipped the wine, and did not roll the fish. 15 minutes in the oven was perfect. Any longer, the fish would have been over-cooked. Everyone in my family enjoyed this (including my 3-year-old). I used fresh fennel bulb, but none of us could taste it in the sauce. I served it with cous cous and veggies.

I made this w/fennel seed too, only about 1 teaspoon w/c I didn't want it to overpower. I served on top of couscous which was nice for eating w/the tomato sauce. I forgot the wine around the fish at the end and it didn't seem to matter. Good weeknight dish.

OMG, this is sooooo much better with the bread crumbs! I made it earlier with brown rice. There's no comparison. This is divine and I will definitely make it again and again. To the previous reviewer who thought it was too salty......when I saw how much salt the recipe called for, it looked way too much to me so I simply didn't use it. The only place I used salt was in the bread crumb mixture. By tasting the sauce, I could tell it needed no more salt. This time I only used about 1 tsp. fennel seeds cuz that's all I had left and it came out excellently albeit just a little less fennelly-tasting. This is a keeper. Enjoy.

Rating: 2
After all the great reviews, I thought this would be better than it was. I followed the recipe perfectly, except that I substituted 1 tbsp. fennel seed for the anise. This was a tad too much fennel for my taste. My main complaint was that it was too salty. I would cut the salt by half, at least. Also, I don't think the fish needs the breading. About halfway through the meal, I scraped off the breading (which was also too salty) and it was much better. I'd give it 2.5 forks - it was pretty good, but nothing to write home about.

Great sauce! But like other reviewers I found it overwhelms the delicate flavor of a flatfish (I used sole). It would be perfect with a heartier fish like swordfish or shark or even cod. I laid the fish flat in the pan, and topped it with brown rice instead of the breadcrumbs. If anyone else cares to do this, be sure to cover the pan before putting it in the oven or your rice will dry out and become a little too crunchy. Otherwise, very good. I will definitely make this again.

First time I made this I didn't have fennel so I used chopped celery for the same texture and added fennel seed. The dish was great!!

This recipe was great although I did change it a bit. I didn't want to use the breadcrumbs so I just left that part out. I also substituted shallots for the onions and made sure I covered the fish with the sauce so that it would not dry out since I wasn't using the breadcrumbs. I also covered the dish with foil while baking as well. I served it with steamed broccoli and brown rice pilaf. Yum!

We loved how the sauce kept the flounder moist and provided textural balance. We added some pecorino to the breadcrumb mixture (using Panko for the crumbs) and substituted some of the canned diced tomatoes with fresh plum tomatoes from the farmer's market. It went nicely with fresh oregano-spiked rice and a green salad. One note: we found the fish to be done after 15, not 20 minutes.

This is a great family meal, everyone loved it. Use 1 Tbsp anise for fresh fennel (works just as well), add a shaker of hot red peppers for a snap of flavor. Do not roll fillets, but lay them flat on top of sauce, use 9x13 glass dish and only cook for 20 min.

I made this with a thicker piece of flounder and left it flat in the gratin dish rather than rolling, and placed the crumbs on top. Since I had it in the house, I used a really good puttanesca sauce which contained all the ingredients listed here for the sauce. I followed the directions by placing the fish on top of the sauce and baked as directed. We loved it and it smelled so good. Next time we may try with cod or halibut, even sea bass.

We liked this quite a bit. It is quite filling - we served with pasta, and if you put some parm on the sauce and pasta, you are approaching almost 'rich' for a recipe with 'light' ingredients. Don't be too afraid of the fennel - I don't usually care for the flavor either, but here it is pretty subtle, adding texture as well as some mild, mild flavor, and keeps the tomato from overwhelming the fish. We used melted herb butter, then coated all in bread crumbs, them rolled up as directed, a few extra bread crumbs on top, and a little butter-flavored Pam on top to help brown (it didn't brown that much.) Definite keeper - and it was pretty quick to make, using my food processor!

This was so good and so easy, especially since I cheated and used Trader Joes' Italian Caponata sauce, which has essentially the ingredients called for. Also I used Talapia instead of Flounder. I served over polenta that I sprinkled with fresh parmesean cheese. I was doubtful of the breadcrumb topping, but it really made the dish.

Hubby and I didn't care for the buttered bread crumb topping (but it did it's job of protecting the delicate flounder very nicely!), but did enjoy the dish once we scraped it off. We both enjoyed the sauce with it's chunkiness. I used vermouth for the wine called for... I very rarely have white wine on hand and vermouth (a fortified wine) keeps on the shelf almost indefinitely... very useful (it's always in my pantry along with marsala and sherry!) Since hubby tends to bring home LOTS of fish from his weekend forays during fishing season, it's great to have additional meals with which to use the catch!

My husband says this is the best fish dish I make because the fish is cooked perfectly. On the west coast flounder is not always available, so I have used halibut and red snapper and these have worked just fine. This is a simple, homey, always delicious dish that is a keeper in our house!

Very nice; turned out even better than expected. Substituted Red Snapper for flounder and red wine for white, both with excellent results. Also threw in a crushed red chile, which gave the sauce even more depth. Didn't bother rolling the fillets (the instructions are rather unintelligible on the process anyway), but rather placed a large fillet flat on top of the sauce and coated the top with the bread-crumb mixture.

This was a pleasant surprise and we plan to add it to our list of favorites. Very easy to make and ingredients are easy to locate. We made it exactly as instructed but next time would double the butter/bread crumb mixture that is pressed into the flouder before baking. This was a little unusual trying to press the crumb mixture onto the fish but it comes out nicely when done baking. We took one reviewers advice and served with a side dish of thin spaghetti. Outstanding and the recipe makes enough sauce to do so. Enjoy!

Loved this! ;-D And my husband agrees! I did "doctor" this up by using canned tomatoes with garlic and onion added, I also sprinkled an Italian blend of seasonings over the sauce. And as many do, I increased the amount of fresh garlic. I did not add the fennel (my husband and I do not like the flavor it gives) and not as much salt as called for...the capers did the job.

This is a wonderful recipe, the only changes that I made were to add some cayenne pepper to give a bit of "bite" to the (known) blandness of the fish. In addition, for the last minute, we broiled the fish in order to "toast" the crumbs, but you have to be careful to watch not to overdo it, or the fish might dry out. And finally, we served on a heated plate to keep the sauce and fish warm.
