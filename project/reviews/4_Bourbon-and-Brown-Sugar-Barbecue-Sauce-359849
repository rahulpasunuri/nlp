I really liked this BBQ sauce. It was very easy to put together and really filled the house with an appetizing fragrance. I fired up the grill and did some chicken thighs and the flavors were wonderful. Super quick and easy to make, and extremely tasty.

Great recipe with lots of depth of flavor. Easy to adjust to your taste. Lots of compliments on it when served with smoked brisket. A keeper!

Best Barbecue sauce EVER! I wanted a new bbq sauce for my birthday party and couldn't decide between this or the Cherry Chipotle (same issue). Everyone is still talking about this sauce. I just made another batch this week for the Homecoming Game. BTW I also could not find Molasses, so I used Honey - right behind my house is a honey farm. Support your neighbor, right?

This BBQ sauce was fantastic. I added Canadian Whiskey (Crown Royal) in place of bourbon. What a hit with everyone! I will make a double batch next time, and keep it for another use. Was to die for on pork baby back ribs........

Super tasty sauce- we used the whole recipe on 2 BBQ Chicken Pizzas. We'll definitely make this again and try it on other meats. At first, I was worried it would be too strong because I smelled it once all of the ingredients were added and it gave my nose a "zing!" but after it cooked for a while, the sauce mellowed out and blended together nicely.

Absolutely awesome BBQ sauce! The only change I made was to use1&1/2 T. molasses and 1&1/2 T honey, as I could not find the mild (light) molasses. I also upped the liquid smoke by 1/2 tsp., as we love a smokey sauce. I made this for some smoked pork ribs (served the sauce on the side). People could not get enough and I had several requests for the recipe. This is now my "go- to" BBQ sauce; no more store bought stuff for me!

This is by far the best barbecue sauce I have tasted in a long time. It is very easy to make and the longer it cooks the better it tastes. In the future, I will definitely be making this in lieu of using store bought sauce. One note - the sauce initially tastes hot (spicy hot) from the red pepper but I found that it mellowed out as it cooked and by the time it was used on the ribs and chicken, it was the perfect (spicy) temperature.

Used this sauce on the Brown Sugar and Bourbon Ribs. WONDERFUL. Tripled the recipe and it will all get used. The flavor is just great. A little sweet, a little kick.

Really great sauce with no chopping involved. Takes 5 minutes to put together. Definitely will make this again.

What an awesome sauce - it is the right consistency, and my husband who doesn't like BBQ sauce actually loved it. I would add a little extra brown sugar next time to make it a little sweeter.

This is a great and very easy BBQ sauce. I will keep this recipe and use over and over again.

I think good BBQ sauce is subjective based upon where you're from and what you're accustomed to. For me, this was delicious. Not too thick, not too thin, not too sweet. Only thing I'd change would be to double the recipe.
