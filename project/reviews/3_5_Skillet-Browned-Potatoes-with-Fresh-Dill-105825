This is a simply wonderful recipe. I was looking for something I could cook on top of the stove because the oven was being used to cook the ham. This recipe was perfect. I cooked the fingerlings in the morning and when our guests arrived, I gently fried them in an electric skillet. The results were mouthwatering and I got a lot of compliments. I didn't have dill so I used dried rosemary. The butter gave the potatoes a lovely golden brown color. I did add one shallot and it gave it an extra little flavor boost. One other thing I did was to boil the fingerlings by size. Some were big so I pre-boiled them 20 minutes, after 5 minutes I added the medium sized potatoes and then after another 5 minutes I added the small ones. All the fingerlings were done to perfection. This is a real winner weather you are entertaining or just for an elegant evening meal.

I've made this dish three holidays in a row, and it's always a big hit. Try it with heirloom fingerlings - it's the best.

This is an incredibly easy recipe. I don't really care for dill so I use rosemary instead. I also add Chicken Sausage (Cilantro/Chipotle flavor) and sliced onion, which I brown in a skillet. I mix everything together at the end. Makes great leftovers, too.

This is an excellent little recipe, and didn't take much effort at all in my opinion (unlike other reviewers). I made it as a side with a salmon dish earlier this week, and will make it again for Easter as a side with rack of lamb. It is very easy. I highly recommend.

Yummy, easy, decadent, buttery potatoes, what's not to like? I used both red and purple fingerlings, which added nice color to the dish.

Tasted good, but not worth the effort. I make oven roasted potatoes that are just as good and 1/2 the hassle.

There is a fabulous farmer's market in the Prudential Plaza, downtown Chicago. I bought some really cool and funky fingerling potatoes there last week and made this recipe with them. They were really easy to make and very tasty. The only change I would make would be to salt the water for boiling the potatoes.

This is a very good way to get potatoes ready early for a meal. It takes just a few minutes to brown while the steaks are cooking. The fresh dill was wonderful.

My family insists on having this dish every holiday or special get together. The first time I made it I forgot I had to cool the potatoes for a substantial amount of time. I cooled them for only for a few minutes but that did not seem to affect the outcome of the recipe. Fingerlings are expensive so I've used baby potatoes and though fresh dill is great, I've also tried them with chives and rosemary and had success.

This would be great for advanced prep, but for everynight cooking for two I followed another's advice & did half a recipe, boiled for 20 mins, cooled 1/2 hr, put in a pan for 15 mins. with dried rosemary..... easy and great.

I used rosemary instead of dill. I sauted the rosemary in the butter first before adding the potatoes. came out great, i cut the potatoes in half length wise as there was no indication in the recipe for which way to cut them. Final note, really brown them, the best tasting pieces were those that were the most brown.

I have made this numerous times, using different herbs and seasonings. (I don't care much for dill either.) Delicious every time! So easy to do the night before! Simple but great taste that can compliment any dish.

Instead of dill I have used fresh green onions and a little bit of red wine. Makes for an excellent side dish and great for those who don't like dill. And yes the flavour's do work together.

This is an easy dish to make for guests since I did the preparations the night before. I served it with fish and it provided good color. The dill was not overwhelming and I'd make it again.

I personally do not like the taste of dill; however all my guests just raved how tasty the dish was. Only time consuming is the fact the potatoes need to be pre-cooked 4hrs in advance. Next time, I will do this the night before. Also, it is very important to not over boil. All in all, quick, easy and tasty given the simple ingredients. Will make again for guests.
