Easy...1 lb=4 cups of powdered sugar...hardens quickly on cookie once piped.

Worked great with the gingerbread cookies. Hardened perfectly. Will use again.

Terrific icing recipe. Nice flavor, easy to make, and it sets up well. I use it often for sugar cookies and gingerbread cookies.

This is essentially just royal icing with some lemon flavor. It is VERY good! I loved it, and it sets up well for preserving the cookie underneath it. I will be adding this recipe to my "stash".

I make decorating icing for christmas cookies every year and do not use any egg whites or powdered egg whites. I also use milk instead of water and vanilla and nothing else and the icing always hardens perfectly fine!

This was an excellent icing for cookies. It's very thick, so it's perfect for decorating with a pastry bag and different tips. I used it with the gingerbread snowflake cookies and it was outstanding and easy to make! A real keeper!
