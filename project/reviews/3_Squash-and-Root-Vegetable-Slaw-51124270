I used a mix of butternut, sweet potato and parsnip, it turned out delicious! Will make this very often!

I found this recipe to be bland, watery and generally unremarkable. It did produce a very light and fresh tasting slaw out of winter vegetable standards, but I think adding matchsticked apples and a cup of chopped parsley would have this effect on anything. Not worth the trouble, imo.

I loved this. I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. It's really healthy, fresh, has a great texture and flavor. I did the Granny Smith Cider a little differently. I decided I wanted the consistency of the processed apples so the dressing was a little thicker. I liked it that way, but I imagine either way would be good.
