I didn't read the instructions very well, and made wedges at the beginning. I tossed them in a bowl with the oil, butter and lime and then lay them out on a cookie sheet. Cooked about 30 minutes total, flipping halfway through. Also wanted a hint of sweetness, so I sprinkled lightly with brown sugar at the end, and then turned off the oven and put them back in while I finished the meal...then rosemary when they came out. Then brown sugar-rosemary combo worked really well.

Oh my - what a fabuloso recipe for squash. I used the Trader Joe's already cut up squash, then followed the recipe (almost) to the tee. Since I halved the recipe for just the two of us, I didn't use two pans - just one. I put the rosemary in with everything to bake and it was delicious! The lime juice is subtle, but the squash is devine!

absolutely terrific. So simple, but so fresh tasting. The fresh Rosemary is key. Even my young grandkids asked for seconds.

I followed this recipe as written, arranging the squash in two different pans--a cast iron pan and the lower pan portion of a broiler pan. The cast iron caramelized the squash beautifully. The squash from the broiler pan was inedible. However, even the squash from the cast iron pan was sour--too sour to enjoy, even with the caramelization. I'm not sure why this got such great reviews. It may depend on the sweetness of the squash, though mine was organically grown from my CSA.

This was simply delectable! I also tried it without the rosemary, replacing it with finely diced hot pepper and it was delicious.

SUPER easy, and a huge hit with my non-veggie eaters (don't tell them it's squash; they're happy thinking they're pigging out on sweet potatoes)

Delicious! I added a bit of raw honey and tossed the rosemary in before baking. I broiled the squash for a little while at the end. My kids (1, 3, & 6) said it was the best squash I've ever made. My husband devoured it.

Easy and delicious.

Good taste. I cut into wedges, sprayed with Pam olive oil, put into storage bag and added lime to coat. Cooked at 450 for 25 min and then sprayed with Butter spray, added salt and rosemary. Estimated 1 weight watchers point per cup.

I really disliked this recipe. It was very bitter, and even after adding brown sugar as another reviewer had suggested it was still really bad. I threw it out after one bite.

This was so easy. I served it to someone who normally does not like butternut squash and he really enjoyed it. The lime and the rosemary at the end, were a nice touch. The only thing I did differently, was that the oven was on 450° for about 15 minutes and that gave it a nice crispy edge which was not at all unpleasant.

I served this last night for guests along with roast pork. It was a total hit even with the two men who generally refuse to eat vegetables.

Absolutely delicious. Simple, but very tasty. This got rave reviews from my family and friends and is one of my favorite, easy-to-make squash recipes. Nice to have a squash recipe that isn't just a pile of mush!

This is my new favorite way to prepare butternut squash. It's so easy and delicious... fantastic weekday veggie. I'm going to try adding sweet potatoes as other reviewers suggested. I had to raise an eyebrow at the people who were surprised that this was sour; it is, but it should be expected given the ingredients. So if you like sour like I do, this is for you!

I love squash, but I was not impressed with this recipe. Mine came out way too bitter, so I had to throw it in a bowl with some brown sugar and maple syrup until that soaked in. Perhaps the seasonality of the squash, or my preference for sweet squash dishes affected this recipe too much, but next time, I'll try something less sour.

Surprisingly delicious! I have already made this twice! It's much easier if you microwave the squash first or you can buy pre-cut cubes of squash at Trader Joes. Easy, yummy & healthy! Also, it makes great leftovers!

Delish! I didn't have any rosemary on hand so I flavored mine with a bit of honey, ground ginger, and a dash of cayenne pepper. sweet and spicy! I realized afterwards it would have been smart to line the baking sheet with aluminum foil for an easier clean-up.

This is exceptional. The rosemary added at the end makes the difference. I usually roast it at a higher temp for the last 5 to 10 minutes and use less butter/oil than called for.

Just lovely. I even made it without butter and added a little bit of honey and yams.

Grezt1 I did not have enough squash, so I also roasted sweet potatoes and baby carrots and it was all good.

This recipe is amazingly good considering its simplicity. I used cubed butternut squash and sweet potatoes but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It will be a permanent part of my Thanksgiving repertoire

I added a little honey and some sage and pepper to the mix and baked it all together. Excellent way to mix up an otherwise favorite dish!

Really simple and made a great thanksgiving side dish. I cooked the squash with the rosemary. I microwaved, peeled, and sliced the squash the night before and then cooked it right before the meal and it was really easy. Very light and tasty addition amidst heavier Thanksgiving dishes.

To peel squash easily ,microwave on HIGH for 2 minutes before peeling

I haven't tried it yet - just a question. What's the easiest way to peel squash? I've always baked it in the shell.
