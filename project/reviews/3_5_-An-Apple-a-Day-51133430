this was an easy recipe to make.....but the taste wasn't outstanding. I used apples and pears. Not so sure I would make it again

Easy and delicious! I didn't have a vanilla bean, so I just added a tsp. of vanilla to the filling after removing from the heat. I made earlier in the day for a dinner party and served at room temp. with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Everyone loved it.
