One of the best recipes for halibut ever! Have made it several times according to the recipe and it has been great every time. The Coulis is fantastic.

GREAT recipe but I forgot to serve the best part - The Roasted Tomato and Garlic Coulis. I used panko for the bread crumbs and more olives than called for. The coulis is time consuming but so good. We ended up using it as a spread on baguette slices as an appetizer the next evening.

Served this for a dinner for 12 and used fresh seabass it was delicious. I did add ground pine nuts and lemon zest to the crust and used panko crumbs as others suggested. The fish took a little longer to cook as it was quite thick but it was buttery and very delicious. The people that bought this dinner from our charity could not stop talking about how good the fish was! Make this it is worth it. I don't like cooking fish for a dinner party but would do this over again in a heartbeat!

This was so good that I am still thinking about it the next morning. Made it exactly as written but did thin the coulis just a bit with lemon juice and a tiny bit of stock. The cooking time was just right. This would be a terrific dinner for guests, since it goes together quickly and a lot can be done ahead of time. Served with parslied new potatoes and frisee salad with bacon and asparagus (from this site).

I made this last night using Pacific Red Snapper which is more thin than halibut and therefore cooks more rapidly. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change it one bit. I like well seasoned food and found the coulis was just right. More hefty flavor would overpower the fish. This could all be made ahead for company, not just the bread crumbs and coulis. The fish would be laid out on a baking dish, covered by the mayo/mustard combo and then the bread crumbs. This could be put in the frig for a while, at least an hour or so, and thrown into the oven 20 minutes before dinner is served. I'll make this over and over again!

Changed only one thing --- included toasted Marcona almonds pureed in a mini-Cuisinart with the bread crumbs and Tarragon. This is a wonderful recipe --- will try it with Chilean Sea Bass at some later time.

Based on earlier comments that the coulis wasn't flavorful enough, I added some chicken broth and lemon juice to ours. It was excellent. We'll definitely be making this again.

Made this for company and it was very good. The coulis needed a fair amount of salt but had a lovely garlicky rich flavour. I kept the coulis fairly thick so it didn't run into everything. Used panko instead of regular bread crumbs which gave it nice crispiness. Breaded the fish a couple hours ahead and just popped it in the oven before the salad. The cooking time as stated by others definitely wrong. About 20 minutes was needed. Made it with soft polenta which contrasted the crispy panko. Very good dish to make entertaining since there is no work to be done last minute.

I made this dish for my college roommates. It was a good do-ahead dish (made the coulis and bread crumb mixture ahead of time). I agree with others that you want to season the halibut well before adding the breadcrumbs. In addition, the tomato coulis could have used some more flavor/zip. I also ended up cooking the fish about 17 minutes, and one thick piece was still under cooked. My girlfriends thought it was good and I would definitely make it again, with a few slight adjustments.

This is such a great recipe and not very heavy, since the coulis is the problem here!!! I double the tomatoes and rosted in the oven until they were dried with a pinch of sugar. Then added some tomato paste and herbs, such as thyme. It was very good.

Very good, but coulis needs more zip. Season fish well before adding breadcrumbs

Next time I'd add something more to the coulis. Halibut has very little flavor and although the bread crumb/olive coating was good including such a bland sauce didn't do much for the dish.

I've made this recipe twice for large dinner parties, because much of the work can be done before guests arrive. The tomato coulis is very flavorful and provides a nice contrast to the more mellow tasting fish. I used panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)instead of traditional breadcrumbs for a more interesting texture and served the fish with braised leeks with lemon and wild rice with fennel and porcini from the same Gourmet issue. I received rave reviews from my guests.

I have made dozens of recipes from epicurious, and this is the first I am very disappointed with. I added a lot of salt and extra balsamic to the coulis to get flavor out of it, and found the bread crumb mixture dul, and the cooking time was off--cooked 20-25 minutes.

I made this for my mother-in-law's birthday and served it with a light salad of field greens. It turned out absolutely perfect, and has since become a favorite in our house. With the sauce made ahead, this would be quite an easy dish to make on a busy weeknight.

This has become a favorite dish for me, I gave the recipe to a owner of a fish market- he loved it. He's hand cutting some fresh cod for me so I can make it for my Valentine,I know it will be excellent. A good recipe for guests!!

Simple, fast, delicious. Have many made times, alwyas well received. In a pinch, you can jerry rig a the coulis with good Italian canned tomatoes, Italian tomato paste, sun dried tomatoes. Puree and cook down, although better when recipe followed. Great recipe for guests because of ease of preparation.

I didn't have any Kalamata olives, so I substituted green Sicilian. I will definitely make this again. I think it would be even better with the right olives.

I really liked this dish but would probably substitute a different herb for the tarragon - anything would really work with this recipe - but that's just a matter of personal preference. I also liked that the bread crumbs and coulis could be made the day before - it makes it a really easy, yet impressive, dish to make for a dinner party. Very good, very tasty!!!

Fabulous dinner, made twice: once for Valentine's Day '95, again V. Day '00, big hit each time. Serve w/Braised Leeks with Lemon, Wild Rice with Fennel and Porcini, chocolate truffles w/sliced mango, Moet & Chandon Brut 1er Cru '92 and Cooper Mountian Estate Bottled Pinot Gris '97, she will love it.

This recipe was a hit. It took a bit of work for a weeknight, but the flavors were fabulous. I would make the coulis and use in other recipes. The cooking time for the fish was off....it took about 20 to 25 minutes for the steaks to be fully cooked. Drank a chardonnay with this and ate every bite!
