Wonderfully simplified version of this dish, but wow, I didn't realize I would miss the seafood as much as I did. I mean if you're going to make paella... I would make this again when I want a shortcut paella recipe, but would definitely add shrimp, at least.

Made this tonight without the chicken, but added shrimp in the last 10 minutes or so. So delicious, and so easy! Definitely worthy of becoming part of the rotation, according to my discerning family, and eminently suitable for guests as well...

I found this a to be a little bland--even though I upped the amounts on all the spices. Also, it took much longer than 20 minutes to bake.

We love this as a quick, weeknight meal and a super way to finish off a rotisserie chicken that was made earlier in the week. I don't add the peas until I pull it out of the oven -- just mix them in while "fluffing" the rice so they warm through. Squirt with a bit of lemon and toss on some fresh chopped parsley.

This gets 4 stars for the combination of pretty delicious and pretty easy to make. I used some saffron rice from the mexican grocery store and fresh made chorizo from the farmers' market. It was a great combo. Usually we like stuff pretty spicy but this was so savory it didn't even really need a kick. Oh, I also served it with some jalapeno cheddar cornbread to soak up all the goodness :)

This recipe was delicious! We used soy chorizo instead of regular and added shrimp and frozen corn. We used arborio rice and used canned organic diced tomatoes instead of fresh. Delicious! The chorizo gave it a slight kick. We needed to cook it a bit longer than 20 minutes for the rice to become tender.

Rating: 4
Fantastic in every way. I use diced tinned tomatoes, paprika instead of pimento and Mahatma yellow rice instead of the saffron. Don't add the peas until the last 15 min, or they get all mushy. (yuk) Shrimp in the last 10-15 also works well. Just toss them on top. I bake in a dutch oven. Double the recipe so you have leftovers, and prepare to un-button that top button!

We really liked this! I made a few modifcations: added artichokes, mushrooms and Rotel tomatoes. Also, I cooked it stove-top.

Wow, a super-easy, super-fast paella exists! BF and I were having 2 couples and 3 tots (3, 5 and 7) over, and by following other reviewers' suggestions to double the veggies (onion, bell pepper and peas) and add shellfish at the last minute (1/2 lb shrimp and 1 lb frozen mussels in the shell), we fed the 9 of us (okay, the kids were admittedly hopped up on adrenalin and Trader Joes pizzettas) and had leftovers for lunch the next day! The only ingredients I had to buy (from The Spanish Table in Berkeley) were a 16 oz package of pimenton-and-garlic-flavored chorizo (yum!) and rice (chose Valencia at $4/bag as opposed to the $11 Bomba). Because this was casual, clean-out-your-freezer, kids-are- coming, I rubbed chicken wings with pimenton, chili, cumin and pepper; baked them while chopping the veggies; then snipped them in half with kitchen shears  looked and tasted great. And yes, replaced one cup of stock with wine. The dish took twice as long to cook as the recipe specified (no doubt because I used my largest Cuisinart saucier in lieu of a flat paella pan) and got a bit soggy (Id been so terrified my first paella wouldnt turn out and Id be slapping together homemade pizzas at the last minute, that I finished it before the guests arrived, so of course it suffered sitting covered during appetizers). My bad. But it looked impressive and tasted divine (used lots of saffron and pimenton I picked up in Dubai), and now I know what to do.

Rating: 4
Nice quick Paella. One way I have made other Paellas (thank you Craig Claiborne): instead of roasting the chicken, simmer it in h2o with onions, celery etc. and the saffron. You end up with tender saffron infused chicken. Use the stock for the recipe and maybe have leftovers for your next saffron rice.

Rating: 3
A fantastic recipe; I give the original three stars and the recipe modifications that people have suggested four stars. My modifications: Added 1/2 lb fresh raw shrimp and 1/2 lb fresh raw scallops immediately before placing in oven Sliced chorizo as thinly as possible Doubled vegetables Used a 14-oz can of diced tomatoes, with juice 1 cup broth (made with enough bullion for 4 cups) 2 cups dry white wine Used chicken thighs; cut into 1-oz pieces, floured, browned 2 minutes in olive oil and then simmered in white wine 20 minutes. An outstanding recipe.

Having never made or even tasted a paella before I have to say this recipe is outstanding. Quick, uncomplicated easily lends itself to many variations.I subbed in half the broth with wine and added scallops. Will experiment more next time. Made enough for 8 adults who loved it as much as I did. I expect it will become a staple in our kitchen. Thank you!

Wow--fast, easy and yummy. I substituted some Mexican chorizo and a small jar of pimentos since I didn't have a red pepper. Also threw in a few shrimp in the last 10 minutes of cooking time. A great recipe that's good enough for company!

Rating: 4
Made this for the second time last night and it was a hit again. It's very easy to throw together and makes a nutritious meal. Next time, I will cut down on the amount of chicken. It was way too much, and I had even forgotten to add the chorizo. I think 3/4 lb. of chicken, together with 1 lb. of chorizo, would be ample.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe 10 or 20 times over the years, and it has never failed me. Guests love it! Even my daughter, now 8, loves it. I remember years ago a babysitter telling me, "I've never known a 2-year-old to say paella, let alone ask for it for dinner!" It's a subtle dish, not overly spicy (though if you want more heat you can up the ante with a spicier sausage). I generally like spicy dishes, but love this AS IS because it's such a perfect balance of flavors. Makes great leftovers, too.

Rating: 4
This is a fabulous, easy-to-make paella! I think the KEY ingredient is "Bomba" rice from Spain, as it absorbs liquid lengthwise, not crosswise, as Italian arborio rice does. My paellas never turned out right, until I discovered Bomba rice. Here in New Zealand, it is readily available in supermarkets, but has to be special ordered in the USA... We also have chorizo, another key ingredient, readily available in delis or butcher shops, here! I also add fresh thyme, some oregano and double the bay leaves, which I thinly cut into strips using a scissors. I throw in a bit of lemon or orange zest, too, and substitute some of the water for either dry white wine or dry white vermouth. Lastly, I use smoked Spanish paprika. Sometimes, I add fresh mussels to the pan before putting it in the oven. And, voila! Perfect yummy paella.

Rating: 3
I reduced the quantity of chicken and chorizo slightly, and used green beans instead of peas due to an allergy, and it came out perfectly. I can't imagine substituting paprika for the pimenton. You really need the pimenton for that slightly smoky flavor. If you don't have that, it's better to use chipotle pepper powder.

This is probably one of the easiest recipes I have ever made. It tastes fantastic and the kids can't get enough of it. I am certainly going to try a cup of wine (without telling anyone) and see how that goes.

Being originally from Minnesota, I use wild rice instead. Wild rice takes a lot longer to cook like this, so I cook it for 40 minutes covered and then the last 20 minutes or so I cook it as described in the recipe. I also substitute a cup of wine for the broth as another reviewer suggested. It's always a hit!

Rating: 4
Wow! This is easy, absolutely delicious, and very impressive for company. Made a few minor adjustments; I prefer the look of whole chicken pieces and so I put the herbs on chicken thighs and drumsticks, and browned them well, tucking them into the rice mixture before placing in the oven. I sprinkled the herbs on peeled shrimp (w/tails on), and put those in for the last 10 mins., as others suggested. Yum! I used Andouille the first time, and hot italian sausage the 2nd time, both with excellent results. I too prefer a mixture of stock & wine... since the first attempt seemed to need slightly more liquid, the 2nd time I used 3.5 c. stock & 1 c. dry white wine - perfect! I like the vegies dicked fairly large (3/4"), both for color and juiciness, and don't skip the peas - they somehow complement everything so perfectly!

Delicious! My loved it even after she found out how expensive saffron is! I wasn't sure if I should put my sautee pan into the oven, so I made it on the stove top and it came out great. Make sure to cover early if using the stovetop method.

As promised, not too hard. I added the wine and shrimp as suggested by other reviewers. Also increased the veggies a bit. Used an uncured chorizo from whole foods, which is spicy and isn't Spanish -- it tasted good but didn't really add the Spanish edge I'd hoped. If i can't find real Spanish chorizo I'll try kielbasa next time; not that it's any more Spanish but it has more smokiness and grease, mmm. Hint -- you can use the carcass from the rotisserie chicken to make or augment your chicken broth. Also, i used arborio rice, which was good, though it did result in a faint risotto thing going on. I may search for proper Spanish rice next time. Also, mine did not come out orange despite paprika and saffron. It was brown. I guess I shouldn't have used red wine. Ooops. Despite any issues I had, guests all said they loved it, requested the recipe, and ate a lot.

Excellent! I had spicy soppresetta left over from an antipasto platter and used it here, in place of the chorizo. I made no other changes, and it was perfect. It is such an easy recipe, too. Perfect for any night of the week and for guests. The presentation is impressive and looks a lot more difficult than the reality.

I love this way of cooking the paella in the oven. I prefer to use a local venison chorizo that smells great, although i will pan fry slices of it beforehand to liberate the fat, then dry it on some towels. I also throw just a teensy bit of truffle oil over the served dishes which just adds that bit extra.

Chorizo renders ALOT of fat and the dish was a little greasy so I would drain at least half of the fat before adding other ingredients. This was the fastest, easiest weeknight dinner and very delicious.

An excellent quickly made dish. I used twice the peppers (1 yellow & 1 orange). I soaked the cooked chicken cubes in a little sherry wine and sweet paprika before adding it to the paella pan. If I had some srimp, scallops or clams I would of added them, but it was excellent for a Sunday evening supper.

I lived in Spain for 6 months and ate lots of paella. Most of the true paella has lots of seafood so this is a little toned down from that, but I did add shrimp to mine and used 1 cup seafood stock and 3 cups chicken stock. Delicious! I also cooked the whole thing on the stove top in a Dutch oven uncovered adding the shrimp with about 10 minutes left to cook. A slight crust forms on the bottom, which is typical of true paella, giving it a nice nutty toasted note. Excellent!

Absolutely delicious dish! I think that the next time I make it I might use a little less chicken and a little more of the veggies, but as is, it was also terrific.

This is a very easy and delicious recipe. I halved it and used brown rice, which led to a slightly longer cooking time. Instead of chorizo, which I could not find, I used andouille sausage as recommended on another site and it tastes great. I browned it and then defatted the pan, so this was much healthier. I also added much more of all the vegetable ingredients and spices, because we like things a little spicier. Definitely a weeknight winner.

This wonderful recipe easily served 8 at last night's party, but sadly, there will be no leftovers for lunch today. I roasted a whole chicken a few days ahead, and basically followed this one to the letter (I try to do that when it's the 1st time trying a recipe). The party was for a friend visiting from London, and he loves paella, and he gave it his approval. One of the easiest paellas I've tried and so flavourful... this one's another "keeper"... thanks, Epicurious!

This was an easy dish to make, but we found it unremarkable. Just o.k., nothing exceptional. Did follow reviewers suggestions and added shrimp and white wine, but did not add the tomatoe (I was out), which I think would have brightened the dish a bit.

It's really so good!

I do not have a paella pan or a skillet that can go from the stove to the oven. I decided to try to make this in my wok. Instead of baking it for twenty minutes, I put the lid on the wok, turned the heat down to low, and simmered it for twenty minutes. It turned out perfectly! Everyone loved it! We had leftovers, and they were terrific, too. We'll definitely have this dish again!

This was incredibly good given how easy and quick it was--it did need more than 20 min in the oven (only about 5 more, though) but other than that it was great--everyone loved it. I too the advice of a previous reviewer and added shrimp, as well as doubling the amount of peas and peppers. I'll definitely make it again!

I have been making this recipe for years with a few additions of my own. There seems to be some confusion regarding the chorizo. Mexican raw chorizo is not what is used in Paella. It is a Spanish cured sausage found in specialty stores or on-line at laespanolemeats.com.

I found this to be a very easy recipe--good for weeknights, but the rice was not quite done after 20 minutes. I would probably add another 5 minutes of cooking time and another 1/2 cup of liquid. Also, I thought it could have used a higher ratio of vegetables--would double amounts to 2 bell peppers, 2 onions and 1 cup of frozen peas.

I have never made paella and thought I'd give this recipe a try. My husband raved about it and I throught it was delicious also. I will be making this for a 50th weddings anniversary potluck this weekend. I am fortunate to live in the southwest where I can go to the Mexican market and buy excellent chorizo in bulk. It is also excellent in Spanish rice. Recipe is a snap to make and provides enough for a croud (or great leftovers the next day).

I've made this dish twice now. As advertised, quick and very good! I witnessed huge quantities of Paella being made in Puerto Rico at a Chamber of Commerce event, the one thing I added (that I saw Execs adding liberally) was beer. May or may not be able to taste it depending on the beer and ratio, but fun to add! Don't forfeit the chicken broth, reduce the water. ;-)

Rating: 4
I couldn't believe how good it turned out because it was so easy. I used arborio rice and let it absorb a quarter cup of white wine before adding the chicken stock and it tasted so good I don't think I would make it without. I used low fat Italian-style chicken sausage and poached chicken breast meat that was shredded and lots of chopped tomato. I cut the recipe in half and it still made enough for at least 4 people and I did not even use that much meat. I can't wait to try this again with seafood.

This is a wonderful alternative to the full day Paella. This is quick & very easy with very yummy results! Took this to a Potluck and got raves, everyone wanted the recipe once I told them how easy it was. I change nothing just use organic ingrediants and heirloom tomatoes in the summer when I can get them from the local farm.

This is an absolute great quick Paella. I have made the more involved Paella's and yes they are wonderful if you have the time but this is great for weeknight or last minute dinner for friends. Please make sure to have the right ingredients available and if you follow the recipe you won't be disappointed. I used fresh cooked peas instead of frozen and also added clams and shrimp (clams before the shrimp). By the way to the cooks from Philadelphia and NJ, why are you bagging on the cook from Long Beach? This is an open forum for suggestions is it not? A little intimidated perhaps? Maybe you should get together and think up new Hamburger Helper recipes.

This was the easiest thing ever to make and it looks impressive. I added some black beans to the paella also just to add more spanish flair. Next time I will brown my own chicken parts and put them in instead of buying a whole chicken.

Made this for my husband and shared it with the neighbors also. It pleased everyone. We are not big salt users so mind any extra you may want to add as the chorizo may be able to carry this ingredient on its own. I also used 2 parts chicken broth and 1 part white wine for the simmer liquid.

Nice little recipe here! I had leftover chorizo in the fridge and had been looking for a simple paella recipe; this worked. I changed it alot, though; used long-grain brown rice (with an extra cup of liquid), and added another 1/2 onion plus a cup or so of chopped butternut squash since i didn't have much chorizo and omitted chicken, and I seasoned it with Old Bay for salt and kick. Also cooked on stovetop - got a little crisp on the bottom but was still really tasty! An excellent base recipe and can be altered with good results.

I didn't have a paella dish, just a casserole-sized pan that I had to cook on the stove. I used the lid, being afraid the stovetop method would make it cook too quickly. It tasted great but the rice was too soft and didn't flake apart. should I do the frying in a pan and switch to a casserole for the oven?

To the "Cook" from Philly, So in your opinion, anyone who actually has gone to the trouble of making a recipe they are looking for, and offering helpful ideas, is offensive? I am not an offensive person, only one that enjoys cooking. I only asked, why would someone look for recipes to please family and friends, but then not make sure they have the proper ingredients? For this I'm attacked? Perhaps it's YOU who needs to GET A LIFE. Thanks for sacrificing your review in order to tell me off, Ouch! but why not go ahead and thrill us all with it. In the mean time, anyone who is actually interested in making this wonderful easy Paella and having it come out right, please make sure to have the proper ingredients ready. Spanish Chorizo can be hard to find but most Italian Deli's carry it and fresh peas work best. Follow the recipe if you are a 1st timer, then experiment to your own taste, Bon Appetit!

I'd make it again, my husband (who is hispanic)went for seconds. I used 2 rotisserie chickens from the supermarket with skin (saved on fat)and bones removed. I also used veg. stock, it would have been good to use less and make up the difference with white wine. I forgot the salt, but it was ok because I added some olives. I wasn't sure which kind of chorizo to buy, (I used 8 oz) so I bought the drier kind and no fat came out when I sauteed it. It took twice as long to cook, but that could also be because I used half white (long grain) and half brown rice. My husband doesn't like brown rice and he didn't even know it was there!

An easy weeknight version of Paella. We thought it was very tasty. I, too, forgot to salt. Didn't miss it--broth was flavorful enough. I added large shell-on shrimp just before it went in the oven--nice addition. To the previous reviewer who panned this recipe: as an excellent cook, you should have been able to make changes to this very basic recipe to salvage it to your liking (unless seasoned rice dishes are just not your thing). Are you sure you're rating the right recipe?

Was this a cruel joke or what? I've been collecting hard copies of Bon Appetit since I'm 18 years old. I've been studying the art of cooking since I'm 10. I've catered many an event because I am considered by family and friends a gourmet cook and I had to throw this out; lock stock and barrel. Even my husband, who pretty much loves everything, spit it out and laughed! He couldn't believe how terrible it was. As far as consistency is concerned, the recipe came out the way it was supposed to. As far as taste; neither my cat or dog would even touch it! Now cats are finicky, but when your dog turns his nose up at it, don't eat it. I'd only feed this to my worst enemy!

I made the mistake of using basmati rice. Big mistake. This came out gluey, and took forever to cook the rice through. I hold myself responsible for that though, and will try this again. I used chicken chorizo to lessen the fat and it was delicious! Also used "no-chicken" vegetable broth, which I like using rather than chicken broth. It's just healthier, and the idea of chicken stock has never appealed to me anyway.

I have often thought about Paella for a casual dinner with friends but until last night had never made it. This recipe is excellent for a first time experience with this versatile dish!

Excellent kind of Saturday night casual meal. I substituted two canned tomatoes in place of the fresh. When I make this again, I will dissolve the saffron in a little sherry, use it to deglaze before adding the chicken stock.

I used this recipe in conjunction with my paella cookbook by Penelope Casas and it was wonderful! I took some of the cookbook suggestions and used them to make it a bit more "authentic" & flavorful. I used Spanish rice instead of regular rice (our local grocery didn't even have any short or medium grained rice). I also used canned broth, but seasoned it with celery, onions, sage, etc, but discarded those when I poured it into the dish. I also upped the rice to 2 1/2 cups (believe it calls for 2 cups) and upped the broth to 6 cups (recipe calls for 4, I believe). 2 minor changes - I only used about 1/2 to 3/4 the amount of chicken, and it turned out ok. I'd also use less sausage the next time, though. The chorizo is very good, but there was a bit much of it. Also, I specifically bought a paella pan, but any big pan will do....just make sure it's about 14-16 inches in diameter, though. Overall, it turned out great and was quite easy to make, as I did the prep work the night before. Everyone had seconds! I know I'll make this again.
