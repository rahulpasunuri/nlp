Absolutely wonderful. Prep is time consuming but worth it. My wife is vegetarian and this is her favorite! I have made it every Thanksgiving for the past 3 years and it is now a tradition. Really great flavors, goes great with the turkey for those of us carnivores. Only thing I hate is the phyllo dough- the tearing is frustrating, but the flakiness is tasty!

The seasonings are exquisite with good forward flavor, followed by a chaser of exotic spices. My husband loved it so much that he wouldn't share with anyone! I used pie crust instead of filo dough and it was just great.

I thought this was great actually. I did make a couple of changes though. I left out the spinach- it seemed gratuitous. I used pine nuts instead of walnuts (allergy) and I also cut the vegetable into 1" pieces after they roasted. My only qualm is that the vegetables actually become very intense and rich. I almost want to try adding a briny flavor like olives or feta to balance it out. Anyways, it's very Morrocan in flavor and if you're into that I think you'll like this. It took me about 2 hours from start to finish (that's including cooking times)

This is an excellent recipe. It's definitely not a weeknight dish since it is time consuming to make. I dedicated a cool autumn Sunday afternoon to the cooking of this dish. One comment: when you thaw the filo, thaw both packages (the brand I purchased had two wrapped packages of dough- thaw both packages) because you will likely need some extra sheets from the second package due to tearing that seems to happen no matter how careful you are. I made the recipe as written and it was very tasty. I will be making again soon.

Followed the recipe exactly and the pie was mediocre, nothing more, nothing less. Won't make again.

The flavors for this were absolutely delicious, but this recipe took forever and was very labor intensive (started at 7pm and by the time it cooled didn't eat until 10!). I don't think the spinach is necessary. I took the advice here to use a premade pie crust, but it fell apart on my plate - not something you'd want to serve to guests. So I'd stick w/ the filo as written.

A friend made this for a church event (in large quantity) and I thought it was outstanding. She did leave out the spinach (though she says she usually includes it) and used pie crust instead of filo (less work I imagine).

I have not made this yet but was wondering how a 13 by 9 only serves 4 to 6 people as a side dish.

Well... this was very good. I will make some changes next time I make it. I might use a less-starchy veggie as a base. I would use butter instead of olive oil on the filo leaves, of which I used about 20 leaves on top. I had to use pecans due to a walnut allergy, which was fine, but I'd add more , and more of the raisins. Turns out, this is a very Middle-Eastern flavored dish, which is great for my husband and me. It IS really good. I'll just experiment a bit in the future.

I forgot to mention two other small changes I made: I diced the squash into 1/2 in. cubes (the recipe calls for 3 in. pieces, which seemed much too large), and I used some butter in addition to the oil when layering the filo dough. If you're not making it for vegans, a little butter adds flavor and helps to create a nice golden color on the outside.

i made this for thanksgiving for the two vegetarians in our group, but everyone at the table raved about how delicious it was. the preparation was a bit time consuming, so its probably not going into my regular rotation of recipes, but i'll definitely cook this again for events. i made it exactly as described.

Fantastic. I put about 12 sheets of filo dough squarely on top of one another, and then rolled it, strudel-style, from the long edge. I ended up with a beautiful log that served five very well--a wonderful vegetarian main dish. I'll make this again, even though it is quite a bit of work.

This was a delicious dish. I made it exactly as directed and it turned out beautifully. Only one thing I would do differently next time - I don't really care for the filo crust, I think I would do a regular pastry shell for it.

Made this for a Thanksgiving side dish. Wasn't sure at all how the flavors would come together... so made exactly as instructed. It was outstanding. Sweet and savory and delicious. Vegetarians and non-veggies alike raved.

I made this for a dinner party and it was a huge hit. It looked really elegant and the flavors/taste were amazing. The only issue I had was that I didn't really understand the instructions about the amount of phyllo you needed and how to arrange it, but I think I had a larger size sheet than the recipe called for. The bigger sheets made it really easy though - no need to overlap. Will definitely make it again.

Have made this several times, having gotten the recipe from his NPR interview last year. It's a great combo of flavors and the presentation is awesome.
