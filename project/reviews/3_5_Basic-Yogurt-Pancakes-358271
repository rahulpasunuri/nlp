These were yum. Since making them I have been obsessed with Yogurt Pancakes, Particularly Greek Yogurt! I adapted another version the other day and added a very unvegetarian topping - bourbon maple syrup with mandarin orange and bacon hash. It was pretty darn good.

These were GREAT! Made them the first time with adding the egg as suggested by a previous reviewer. Used non-fat greek yogurt. Made them a second time, and took out 1/3 cup of the whole wheat flour and put in 1/3 cup of almond meal. Let the batter sit for 60min in the refrigerator and they came out really fluffy! also seasoned with a little salt, vanilla, cinnamon and cardamon. they were an absolute hit!! will definitely be making these again!

I suggest adding a few tablespoons of vegetable oil to allow the pancakes to release from a non-stick pan more easily. I tried it and just a bit is needed.

I used regular all-purpose flour and added 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1 beaten egg. These were the best pancakes I have ever had. Perfect.

We either added too much yogurt or not enough flour (only had all-purpose flour, and attempted to make an accurate conversion from pastry flour); pancakes were cooked on the outside but very, very gooey inside. We added blueberries and cinnamon, though the cakes tasted delicious without them, too. I'll be trying these again with pastry flour.

A bit more dense than the usual buttermilk pancake, but tasty (and healthier) nonetheless. I added cinnamon and chopped apple to them; they were completely gobbled up without anyone complaining about hitting the "pancake wall".
