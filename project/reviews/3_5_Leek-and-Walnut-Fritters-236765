Made these as appetizers for a dinner party and they were gobbled up! I tweaked the recipe to make them gluten free with corn chex, which worked well, but required a bit more than listed for the panko. Served them with Kewpie mayonaise (found at Japanese grocery stores). Big hit! I'm making them again tonight. I think they would be very easy to make vegan as well. Added a pinch of hot pepper flakes too.

What a great little hors d'oeuvre! Served with an Asian influence - wasabi oil, sweet chili sauce, pickled ginger and wasabi mayo - and they were wonderful with all these flavors! Can't believe I 'sat' on this reccipe for over a year.
