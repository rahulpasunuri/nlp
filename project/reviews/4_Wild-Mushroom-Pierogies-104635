I soaked my dried porcini mushrooms in Pinot Grigio. Huge mistake! I thought the wine overpowered the whole filling. I made theses for Christmas dinner and everyone loved them, but maybe they were just being nice since I'm in Culinary School. I'll be trying this again, following the recipe completely.

This recipe was fabulous!! I am not an expert on pierogi, but this was a really delicious filling..that even my 2 year old loved. I used a different dough from food.com after extensive research (http://www.food.com/recipe/pierogi-dough-79860) and it was very good and easy to use. I only used about half of the filling for 24 pierogi and will use the rest tomorrow. These take a long time to make, but well worth the effort.

Poland does not have the exclusive on pierogi...my Ukrainian mother served mushroom pierogi almost as often as the potato/cheese ones...and we always have sour cream :)

Not to be a smart-butt but it's "PIEROGI" - even if there is more than one. I'm Polish-American and my grandmama makes these ALL the time - mainly with potatoes. This was a yummy change!

Whenever I'm in the U.S. I see someone serving pierogi with sour cream. Back home, in Poland, I have never had savory pierogi with sour cream. And certainly not wild mushrooms pierogi! What we put on top is some melted butter/lard with tiny pieces of bacon, maybe some onion fried in it. Cream goes on top of sweet, fruit-filled or cottage cheese pierogi.

made this the other night for dinner however i took the easy way out and used gozya wrappers instead of making the dough. The mushroom filling came out amazing and the meal was very good i will definately be making again. I might even try making some potato ones also next time so there a bit of an assortment.

I picked porcini mushrooms in my aunt's yard and dried them. I had a quart of dried mushrooms and decided to try this recipe. I used 1 cup of dried and 6 oz of the cremini. I tasted the filling and it was fabulous! I started thinking of other things I could make with this filling. I took the lazy way out and used round egg roll wrappers (in the refrigerated produce section). Each one was perfectly formed and uniform in size. I only cooked the pierogi about 3 minutes until they floated. They were so light you could see thru the dough. The onion topping was terrific with a bit of sour cream. Everyone raved about how light and tender they were (not like the heavy ones I have made in the past). I am already planning to make another batch. They were the best!!

I made these as a side dish for Christmas dinner. They were awesome; the mushroom filling had incredible depth. Even the mushroom-hater in the group had seconds. As a child I made pierogi with my Polish grandma, but she only made cheese and plum fillings. I used her dough recipe - it was very similar.

Okay, I am an African-American living among the Polish Diaspora here in Pittsburgh and I decided to take up the Pierogie challenge. The filling was easy to follow so long as you used fresh ingredients like parsley though I used a slightly salted butter for a richer flavor, it turned out to be a real keeper. The use of floured towels proved to be a sensible approach to avoiding a mess. Threw in the onions and more butter and the nieghbor went bunkers.

I used to watch my grandmother (from Poland) make pierogi when I was only 9 years old. This was my first attempt at making them myself. The flavor was absolutely scrumptious. I used Portabello mushrooms which gave it a beefy taste and dried Shitake mushrooms for a woodsy flavor. I also used Vidalia Onions for the topping which gave it a slightly sweet flavor and of course, sour cream. My wife wanted more but I only made a dozen.

Pieroghies are a three-generation favorite at our house, some potato, some cheese but mostly blueberry and Italian plum, boiled, fried in bacon fat then baked in layers with bacon pieces. My cousin and I tried this one lazy Sunday afternoon and had great fun -- the mushroom was delicious although, after a quick taste test of the boil-only specification, did choose to fry them before tossing in the onion/butter mixture. Let's just say: the recipe happily served four not six!

I loved the filling for the dough, it was so different from the traditional polish sauerkraut pierogies which is what I grew up with. The flavor is unique, I never would have thought, it was so YUMMY! I've got rave reviews! I must admit though that I still use my mother's dough recipe...no other could match that!

Years ago my mother and I made pierogies with won-ton wrappers and we've never gone back to the dough since. Simply fill the wrap in the center, seal two edges that are at 90 degrees to eachother, fold into a triangle, expunge all the air and seal the edges. Drop into boiling water until translucent, drain in collander and place single layer on a cookie sheet, top with sauted bacon & onions! Even better fried the next morning for breakfast...

Hmmm...I'm 1/2 Polish and my aunties never made mushroom pirogues (just cabbage, potato and cheese) so I had to try this. My partner liked the results more than me, but this recipe had 20 years of memories to contend with. My advice is to make sure you roll the dough really, really thin, as thin as possible before frying.
