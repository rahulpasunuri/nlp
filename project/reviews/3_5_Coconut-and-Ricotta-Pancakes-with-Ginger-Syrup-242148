Very good. To save time, I think you could also just add coconut to pancake batter. It would cook through better.

Absolutely delicious! My little brother and sister said "Wow! This is good." when they took their first bite. I thought bannanwas were a much better garnish. Pineapple adds a nice color, but it's flavor doesn't meld well. I used homemade ricotta cheese (recipe link below) and dried coconut. I also folded the ricotta cheese in with just before the whipped egg whites. http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/02/ho w-to-make-fresh-ricotta-fast-easy- homemade-cheese-the-food-lab.html

We didn't put sryup because we do not like sweet stuff with our beakfast. If you have children and you have shape makers(like cookie cutters but able to go in hot pans)you can use them.They turn out great.

As written, the batter is too thick for the pancakes to cook through before burning. I adjusted the heat way lower than I normally do for pancakes. I ended up thinning the batter and swirling it in the pan to distribute it to get a pancake thin enough to cook through. Also, I don't see the point of using ricotta in this recipe - you can't really taste it at all. Those issues aside, the syrup is quite yummy and goes well with the coconut. The recipe has potential, but needs tweaking.

Very good and not too hard. Used sweetened dried coconut and just decreased the sugar to 1 T - perfect sweetness. Do not need the ginger syrup - but some topping is nice.

I always have fresh coconut on hand (frozen, bought usually from the asian market) so it was perfect. Light and fluffy, didnt use as much butter as it suggested. I did make the syrup and fruit, it was perfect all together, not too sweet for me and love the textures! My husband really really liked it. Served with some bacon, some protein is a must considering the amount of carbs and sugar this single serving has..

absolutely delicious. I made it with dry , unsweetened coconut and no fruit, and i thought it was perfect. I think it would have been too much with the fruit. This is a more complex and interesting answer to regular pancakes, i think would be great to make for guests if you want to impress...

The ginger syrup is delicious, and the texture of the pancakes is fluffy and quite pleasant. I would make the pancakes again but without the fresh coconut. It was too much work for the taste it adds.

My husband and I don't normally like pancakes, but we decided to try this recipe for something different. It was fantastic!!! It's been only a day since I made these pancakes, but my husband is already asking for them again. I liked the recipe just as it was (although we omitted the fruit since we didn't have it on hand). If you don't like coconut, you could probably substitute chopped macadamia nuts.

Very good but a little too sweet. They were more like a dessert than a breakfast. I made the recipe almost exactly. I didn't have fresh cooconut, so I used a smaller quantity of dried. I might make these again, but not often. The syrup was excellent and you don't need a lot of it as it is very sweet.

These were delicious! The ricotta is what makes them, I left out the coconut and sprinkled it on at the end. I almost didn't make the syrup, but did at the last minute and it is a MUST. Whole family loved them.

Divine! I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta.I upped the sugar by 2 T. I didn't have ginger so I just used maple syrup. I loved the crunch the coconut added, but my husband didn't like the crunch. They are even good cold the next day.

We thought these were delicious ... light and fluffy and very tasty. I made the syrup with lime instead of lemon rind and I left out the coconut in the pancakes themselves. I also used less butter in the pan than suggested and served them with bananas only.
