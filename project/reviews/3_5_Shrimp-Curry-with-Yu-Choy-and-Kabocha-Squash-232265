Really good recipe, but there is *no* substitute for kaffir lime leaves. They add a level of complexity that no curry paste alone can provide. If you don't have an Asian market, order the leaves online. They freeze well. Side note: This dish is wonderful with a dollop of sweet/hot chili Thai chili sauce in the bowl. Also, I like to serve this over Korean "sweet potato" noodles (also known as korean glass noodles or korean vermicelli), but brown rice is also great.

I'm going to try this tonight. Nobody, however, has commented on the fact that we are including "minced lemongrass." I thought lemongrass was inedible and that you added it for flavor and then removed it. What about straining the liquid after its been in there for a while?

This was delicious! I used the two cans of coconut milk and found it to be the right amount. I thickened the sauce slightly with cornstarch. Will all the other ingredients I thought the sauce was perfect. I served it over brown rice and my family devoured it!

Syrely 2 cans of coconut milk is a mistake. I used one and there was plenty of sauce unless this is supposed to be a soup. Guess I forgot second addition of basil leaves but DH doesn't like too many herbs. Great flavor. Recently discovered Yu Choy so searched for recipes that used it.

I used one can of coconut milk and 1 cup of chicken stock. I thought this curry would be too rich w/2 cans of coconut milk. I added the shrimp shells to the stock and simmered them for an hour. I was out of shallot so I used a small onion. I did not find it necessary to use a food processor, as I enjoy leafy herbs in my curry. I added shitake mushrooms and fresh ginger. The squash makes the dish!!!

I'm just mad that so many of you rated this so low. Wow, the Yu Choy are so tasty and really from another planet! When I first mad this recipe I used Trader Joes Green Curry Paste. That was the biggest mistake of my cooking life. If you're going to make this one, please spend the time to find some authentic curry paste, it made the dish 100 times better!

I liked this, but I ended up with WAY more than 4 servings. My squash may have been larger than your average Kabocha. I did use light coconut milk, and it was fine. I loved the leftovers - better than the first servings, so maybe the flavors need more time to meld. Had great lunches for days after.

This is delicious from what I expected after reading the recipe. The flavor combinations were right on. However, it seems like a whole lot of coconut milk to be using, considering the richness of the ingredient, so I only used one can and it was still very rich. I may try light coconut milk next time to put the liquid level where they intended, or I suppose another type of liquid could be used instead of the second can.

Are double-leaf kaffir lime leaves the same thing as kaffir lime leaves? Why the "double leaf" part?

I liked this dish, but no one else in my family did. It was somewhat time consumming.
