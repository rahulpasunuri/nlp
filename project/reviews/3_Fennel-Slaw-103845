Simply put, this recipe made a fennel believer out of me. I was looking for a light accompaniment for a seafood heavy dinner I made for Christmas Eve and while I've always been VERY scared of fennel because I hate licorice, this slaw dazzled all the guests (maybe even more than some of the complicated fish dishes!). The fennel maintains a really nice crunchiness unlike traditional cabbage slaws and the lemon in the dressing makes it. I've made this recipe several times since and have sworn I'll never make reagular cole slaw again...I've slipped a few times but just used this dressing with grated cabbage, carrot and a little onion...delish.

Simple, delicious take on traditional cole slaw. I use half the sugar. The lemon is what makes the recipe interesting. It goes extremely well with barbecued ribs, deviled eggs and baked beans. The lemon makes a nice foil for the sweetness of the baked beans. Goes well with crab cakes too...

I subbed lemon for vinegar and omitted sugar. I used home-made mayo. It was tangy and good. Very appetising. A good use of fennel.

Delicious! Very nice refreshing side dish to fish and a different twist on the usual cole slaws. I added some lemon juice to give it a zing, but otherwise did not change the recipe. I served it beside roasted salmon and it was very nice. I would definitely make this recipe again.

What a wonderful surprise! This slaw is light and a wonderful palate cleanser when eating stronger tasting foods. I halved the amount of mayo and it still came out beautifully. Added a spritz of lemon juice too to make the dressing more "dressing" than mayonaise. All in all, an excellent dish!

I used this recipe as a "bed" for crab cakes. It's terrific! Very simple to prepare. I would probably do something to add some color next time...maybe very thinly sliced red pepper?

I added half a medium onion and substituted Heinz Salad Cream for the mayonnaise.

Fennel fan. A fresh twist on an old dish.

Great rich taste. Would go great with fish. This was an exceptional treat from regular slaw.

This was great. I made it first for my husband -who love it - and a second time for coworkers at a salad luncheon. The first time it was more thinly sliced and we preferred it.
