Not so good. My husband says that it tasted like cream of wheat on top of noodles. I will not be making it again. It didn't have the flavors I was looking for. I think its a nice idea but not quite right.

This dish is neither fish nor fowl. After using an entire squash, lots of mascarpone and a ton of shiitake mushrooms, the only use for it is to stir in with fettuccine. In no way is it worth the work. It is OK, but it cannot be used as a stand alone vegetable or even as a soup.

This was a recipe with potential, but we found it somewhat bland as is. I'd start with some sauteed onions with the mushrooms to add flavor, then increase the mushrooms and decrease the pumpkin ratio a little. First I made the recipe exactly as is, found it too unappealing to put on the table, and started altering it to try and salvage the meal. I found it very bland, but the addition of cream cheese perked it a little bit; next time I'd use that instead of the marscapone altogether. The addition of a little red wine also aided the flavor. When serving, I added some crumbled goat cheese on top of the whole thing instead of parmesean; my husband and I agreed that was the best part.

We loved this recipe and found it surprisingly delicious, with a very unique warm flavour. A nice change from tomato and cream based pasta. The cinnamon and toasted pumpkin seeds really make this recipe. If you are a mushroom lover like me, I would definitely recommend to use more shiitake than asked, would suggest 18 oz instead of 12, as the shiitake got a bit lost. Also, we made it with kabocha, the Japanese green-skinned pumpkin, and cream cheese (as other reviewers suggested) for budget and health reasons, which worked fine. Cut down the butter by half too. However, unlike some other reviewers, we did not find the sauce too runny - in fact, if anything, it "dried" rather quickly, perhaps because of the lower fat content. Would definitely make this again.

Just love this recipe! My favorite ! I follow the recipe as indicated, but adjust the tickness of the sauce by adding or reducing the broth and I serve this splendide sauce on filled pumkin raviolli. Just love it!

My husband said this is a "keeper" which he says about 1 in 20 recipes. My 2 year old loved it and I thought it was lovely. Very subtle yet rich flavours, would not recommend adding anything the beauty is in the sublety. Also the shiitakes are essential, don't substitute another mushroom, they have such an earthy heady flavour that balances the sweetness of the pumpkin. beautiful

I could not even give this recipe a one fork rating. It was so bad. The tastes did not meld together at all. I am always looking for new main dish recipes and this one will be thrown away, just like I did with this dinner. It was not edible.

Mea culpa, I didn't make this exactly as written. Still, I am a fairly experienced cook, and I would say that this recipe is not for me (or my family). It tasted ok, but my goal was to find a new, inventive way to use the big pumpkin I process every year after Thanksgiving. I think our lack of enthusiasm had to do with the texture of the sauce (?). If I made this again, maybe I'd puree it more to get a silkier texture. I did add one clove finely chopped garlic, a little cayenne and some wine; still not enough punch for us. I should note, though, that the experiment is always half the fun.

Very good and easy. I substituted some of the ingredients and still got great results. This is different and tasty. Even my husband enjoyed it.

I cooked this dish as a main course for 18 people (I live in a college co-op house). I quadrupled the recipe, and used 4 boxes of pasta. I could have used just a tad more. I ignored the quantitity of broth that was called for, and just used what looked good. Also substituted cream cheese for marscopone due to expense. Everyone really enjoyed it, especially with fresh grated parmesan.

I love pumpkin and marscapone but this dish didn't do it for me. It was okay, but afer the reviews not great...not worth the calories

I made this for a Halloween party with Spinach Linguine. I used butternut Squash and vegetable broth instead of chicken, and crimini mushrooms instead of shitake. I also added black sesame seeds for color. It was a big hit. Very delicious and I would make it again the same way.

My husband told me this was a keeper despite being a meat and potatoes fan and not liking mushrooms. Used butternut squash instead of pumpkin. Cut broth down by 1/2 cup in the blender with squash. Cooked broth down with mushrooms to about 1/2 cup not 1 cup. Used 18 ounces pasta instead of 16 ounces. Tossed pasta with 2/3 of sauce, let sit in pan for 3-4 minutes, then added the rest of sauce as it was very well absorbed by hot pasta. Passed the toasted seeds instead of putting in sauce. Much debate around the table if minced garlic or shallots should be sauted with mushrooms to give more flavor to pasta-some said yes, some said no it would overwhelm the subtle tastes of the squash, seeds, cheese sprinkled on top. Would use green or black pasta next time.

So good. Decadent but worth the calories (and price of mascarpone) for a special treat. Husband went back for seconds, then thirds--not typical behavior at all!

Great pasta sauce and use up pumpkin and winter squash. Will make again.

I've made this a couple of times. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly and found it missing a little something. The second time I made it, I used carmelized onions and sweet Chinese sausage. They added a nice complement to the dish. I gave this 2 forks as is, but it's can be a three with tweaking.

Very tasty. I cut the amount of sauce back, and used sour cream instead of marscapone since that's what I had on hand. Also added a touch of nutmeg and cayenne, although I would have added more of the cayenne to kick it up a notch. Added a little white wine to mushroom saute. Garnished with toasted pumpkin seeds from Halloween pumpkin and parm. cheese. Husband loved it!

Fresh goat cheese is also a good substitution for the mascarpone that gave the dish a tangy flavor.

I made this dish with butternut squash and served over black pasta for a halloween dinner party. I used only half the chicken broth and added a package of button mushrooms since there were not enough shitakes for my taste. threw in about a half a cup of cream cheese I needed to use up. I also added food coloring to make it more orange for the holiday. served with a first course salad of figs and procuitto which is also an epicurious recipe! Delicious. Set the table in black and orange and made a place card for each guest out of a mini pumpkin with their name carved in it. very festive

I made this with butternut squash instead of pumpkin and it still turned out great. I cut down the broth by 1/2 and the sauce was nice and thick. I also used spinach fettuccini, which made for a nice color combination.

I made this for a post-Halloween party, and it turned out wonderfully! The taste was intriguing, and a welcome departure from the tomato-laden pasta dishes. The one strange aspect of the recipe is the sauce/pasta ratio. If the recipe were to be followed exactly, then the pasta would be nearly invisible under the sauce. I increased the fettucine to 1.5 lbs, and the sauce was still abundant (and tasty!).

I substituted no-fat cream cheese which worked well, and added grated fresh ginger root. Still found it too bland. When I make it again, I will add hot peppers, and perhaps some herbs. Interesting dish, though.

Fabulous, festive fall or winter dish. Very easy and tasty. BUT, there is WAY TOO MUCH sauce. I should have read the other reviews and cut down on the broth. I too, prefer a thicker sauce. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth because I was serving this dish to vegetarians. I don't think that the dish suffered for it. The pumpkin seeds HAVE to be roasted and salted for their flavor to be appreciated.

roasting the pumpkin was much easier than i thought. i used lite sour cream instead of mascarpone, doubled the mushrooms and added diced jalapenos at the end. IT TURNED MY WIFE INTO A PUMPKIN LOVER!!! don't be intimidated by all the steps, it is worth it.

This is soooo good! I used half 1/3 less fat cream cheese and 1/2 mascarpone, and I will use all cream cheese next time for both fat and flavor reasons. I did find that you don't need nearly the amount of broth in either the mushroom mixture or the sauce. I suggest that you add broth to the sauce to your liking (we like it thicker so it sticks to the noodles).

I made this for a dinner party, and everyone loved it. I could not get fresh pumpkin, so I had to cheat and used a large can of canned pumpkin and it worked great. Tip: serve this over black pasta--the orange and black combo looks great.

Fine dish! Used Fresh Farmer Cheese instead mascarpone with very favorable results. Letting the sauce set for two hours is a must. Also the roasted pepitas pumpkin seeds are a treat on their own.

I wish I loved it as much as everyone else! But, I thought that it was going to be much more exciting. I didn't like that it was practically all the same color, and while it was very rich, it just wasn't wowing me. I even added a touch of fresh grated nutmeg to it. I guess my palate likes thing spicier.

Cooked a wonderful lamb/veg roast. Had an excess of baked pumpkin & golden sweet potato. Combined both to comply with your recipe. PERFECT!! Used low-fat cream cheese in lieu of the mascarpone and added toasted pine nuts as well. The cinnamon flavour was subtle and suberb.

This dish was amazing and received raves from dinner guests. We used butternut squash and prepared the sauce (minus the pumpkin seeds) the day before, adding the seeds just prior to serving. Very unique flavour and the hint of cinnamon was perfect.

Quite rich, but an excellent unique flavor. I had a beautiful organic pumpkin and was seeking the perfect dish, this certainly did it justice.

I had been looking forward to trying this dish for some time, so I must admit I was rather disappointed with the result. The thickness of the sauce makes it less than managable on the pasta. However it is very easy, and one of my roommates actually liked it.

We served this meal for a luncheon. Everyone raved about it. It is a little rich. Next time I think I would serve it as a side dish, maybe with a pecan crusted chicken breast.

Easy, delicious! The cinnamon in the pumpkin/mascarpone raised my eyebrows when I read the recipe, but really gives this one a special flair.

soo good - i'm a menace to kitchens everywhere, but even i was able to pull this one off. btw, for vegans, substituting soft tofu for marscapone works really nicely.

A great way to eat pumpkin. The sauce is creamy and flavorful. I used chicken boullion instead of broth and regular philly cream cheese instead of mascarpone cheese. My picky three - year old loved it.
