I'm not sure if it was the fact that I was quadrupling this recipe, but I thought in the end it was very unappealing.

Tres yummy! A great recipe for an often (sadly) overlooked vegetable. I've also tried it as a topping for bruschetta during those long months when tomatoes are out of season, and it was delicious.
