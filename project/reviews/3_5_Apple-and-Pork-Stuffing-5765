I made this stuffing as directed - without the ground pork to go along with some porkchops - and we simply loved it! The ground pork really isn't necessary. I am making it again for Thanksgiving.

I made this dish with the ground turkey mentioned in previous reviews. I doubled the spices and mixed all of them into the ground turkey, then fried it in in 1/4 c. apple cider. The allspioce is especially tasty with ground turkey, which, once you mix in all the spices tastes like regular sausage without all the fat. Instead of bread crumbs, I used panko and added an egg. I also doubled the garlic. Then I seasoned with salt and pepper and sages to taste. It is an excellent dish with a four-fork wows factor. My guests oohed and awhed.

This recipe is healthier and just as good using ground turkey. I knead all the spices into the turkey before frying it. I have also used dried cornbread and wild rice, which I boil in apple cider. The wild rice is a superb way to go. After everything is mixed together, I add more of the spices to taste.

My grocery store didn't have ground pork readily available, so I used 1 lb of very mildly spiced sausage meat instead. Definitely added a lot more breadcrumbs, otherwise I suspect it will be more like a meatloaf. Served it with a boneless pork loin instead of the crown roast, but otherwise the same recipe. Definitely a fan, but next time I might go easy on the allspice and maybe add a bit more celery.

This was very tasty with crown roast of pork. I added 1 or 1/1/2 cups more breadcrumbs. The recipe calls for 2#'s ground pork and 1 cup of breadcrumbs, that ratio seemed odd, and looked more like pork mousse than stuffing.

Has anyone tried this recipe using a boneless loin of pork, butterflying it, and stuffing it?

This will be the 3rd year out of the last 5 That I will make this to accompany the Crown Roast of Pork. This is a wonderful dish and easy to make.

Served this the first time last night. It is definitely a meatloaf. Turned out Wonderful!!! I did modify this recipe lots, though: 1) Fried 1# ground turkey and 1/2# regular Jimmy Dean pork sausage in a non-stick skillet without any oil, until the meat was no longer pink; 2) drained all the grease off; 3) added the veggies to the skillet and sauteed until the red onion was translucent; 4) only used 1-1/2 oz. (by weight) of our home grown and dehydrated Winesap apples; 5) followed the rest of the recipe as directed; turned the whole mixture into a greased glass bread loaf pan. Since we are at about 4600 ft. in elevation in Alamogordo, NM, had to increase the oven temp to 400 degrees and bake it about 45 minutes

I made this with the Crowned Roast of Pork, and it was amazing. The dish as a whole was great. I was leary of there being too much pork flavor (is there any such thing?), but this stuffing really complimented the ribs. The whole recipe is in my top 3 special occasion recipes!

A fantastic recipe.

Excellent flavor and I will make it again. It is very different than other stuffings. My guests ate every bite. I use 1 1/2 lbs. of ground pork instead of 2 lbs.

This stuffing was quite heavy, especially when served with a meaty entree. I would make this as a meatloaf and use a lighter stuffing including apples and some of the other ingredients as an accompaniment to the crown roast of pork, which was spectacular.

This makes great meatloaf or meatballs, but I can't imagine serving it as stuffing! The fact that it has to be SLICED for serving should have been the first clue. Maybe it's a regional thing - to me, stuffing should be light and full of buttery bread cubes and interesting goodies, not a compact mass. Regardless, this makes a tasty meatloaf - the apples and seasonings are well balanced.

I made this dish just for a special Sunday meal, and I would definetly make it for a holiday. My husband and brother-in-law said it was the best meal they've ever had. Served it with scalloped potatoes and fresh green beans. Used fresh apples in the stuffing-also,don't people know they have to hit apple and sausage stuffing to get the full recipe?

The stuffing is exactly like meatloaf.

Marvellous with or without the Crown Roast of Pork. Relatively quick and easy to prepare, especially if you are willing to get your hands dirty and use your fingers to mix the ingredients. I recommend ground pork from a butcher instead of the supermarket--better quality and less fat. Smells great when cooking too!

This was a wonderful recipe. People continue to ask for it again and again. If this is made with a pork crown rib roast, patting each side of the sliced meat in the seasoned stuffing after it's sliced is a nice touch. The apple flavored seasoned bread crumbs stick to the meat and it's pretty.

I made this recipe for several friends and they liked it very much. I Used a little less than 1 1/2 lbs of pork and used only 2 eggs to make it a little less heavy. Goes great with the crown roast of pork.

Good recipe. However, it is very rich. I reduced the ground pork to 1.5 lbs and excluded the egg to avoid the "meatloaf" consistency. I fried the ground pork along with shallots and garlic first then add bread crumbs.

I thought this recipe was very tasty and easy to make. I've definately found a replacement dressing for my Thanksgiving bird with this recipe! My guests thought it was yummy!

I made this for friends on New Year's Eve. We found the stuffing to be a bit heavy but the flavor was just wonderful. Next time I'll just cut back on the amount of ground pork. The guys however, ate it for lunch the next day and loved it!
