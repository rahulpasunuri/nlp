Made this to top burgers and brats. A big hit at the BBQ. Great, even though I used cumin powder in place of the seeds for a shortcut. Used leftovers on my morning egg sandwich.

I made this to go with roasted sweet potato wedges thinking it was like ketchup and I never expected it to be sooooo good. I can't believe this isn't on the list of the 30 most commented upon recipes. This is the BEST barbecue sauce I've ever eaten. I don't even like barbecue sauce. I'm craving it already! This would be good on anything. I can't wait to see what everyone else does with it.

I defenitly would do this recipes again but I will add fresh chopped basil and a little bit of honey to cut the acidity of the lime.
