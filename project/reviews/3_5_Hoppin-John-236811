Great easy recipe for starting off the New Year. I added chopped fresh parsley for a bit of color & perky taste.

I made a vegetarian version by using safflower oil to saute vegetables and adding 1/2 tsp. liquid smoke. Delicious served over basmati rice with greens and cornbread for New Year's Day.

I've made this twice now, and it was delicious each time. Second time I made it with basmati rice, and that was better than with regular white rice.

I added a canned of stewed tomatoes and 1/2 C. of tomato sauce to the beans after about 30 minutes of cooking. Gave it a much better flavor and broth to serve over rice.

This was very good even without the tomatoes and rice. I used thick sliced smoked bacon and tossed in generous amounts of crushed red pepper flakes as well. Used fresh blackeyed peas. Great stuff. Will definitely make again and again.

I just made this for dinner today. I followed the recipe for the peas, using chicken stock as one reviewer did. I was a little disappointed with the flavor. To brighten up the flavor I chopped some red and green pepper and sauteed them in a little olive oil with salt and pepper. That really gave the dish a good taste. I didn't feel like eating rice, so I just served it with some grilled sausages, bread and some homemade cole slaw. Just right after so many days of rich sophisticated food!

I have made Hoppin John multiple times. I never thought to add the tomatoes. Today, I used a medium tomato based salsa. I used fresh black eyed peas since they are always available on New Years. I used as the recipe as written with some cajun spices added. This is really good, which says something as I do not like black eyed peas and force myself to eat them on New Years Day. I will be making New's Years Black Eyed Peas this way from now on. Easy to make as well

Listen up, people. Blackeyed peas are a kind of bean. Different animal from green peas. This is a perfectly OK recipe for Hoppin' John.

Last-minute dish. Couldn't find fresh or frozen peas, so substituted canned, with no ill-effects. In addition to the red pepper flakes, added some hot sauce on top to spice it up a bit. Nice, quick and easy side dish that can be thrown together at a moment's notice.

Delicious! I cooked the peas in chicken broth - also needed a fair bit of salt for my palate!

It's simply not fair to rate recipes that you haven't tried - especially when you (quite obviously) haven't read it very closely. This looks like a fine recipe for Hoppin' John...
