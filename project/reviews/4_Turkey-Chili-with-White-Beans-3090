I love this recipe with one CRITICAL CAVEAT: 1/4 cup of chili powder only works if you are using mild chili powder. i just made this and used a european co's chili powder which must have been a very particular breed, though it was not marked -- and the entire pot had to be thrown away. (we actually made a SECOND batch, and added one up of the too-spicy batch, and that was too spicy so both had to be thrown away). beware excessive chili powder.

This has been my go-to chili recipe for years, it is amazingly good. Honestly, it should be one of their Blue Ribbon recipes. It is easy to modify, but is delicious as written. The cocoa and cinnamon give it a unique and rich flavor that i now find lacking in other chili recipes. I like to use an immersion blender at the end to thicken it up a bit and serve with crusty sourdough or corn bread...yum! As others have said, it gets even better a day or two later.

Great launching pad! I used ras el hanout as a base with ancho dried peppers and real dark chocolate plus added a spot of good belgian beer. Makes for a rich beautiful dish with a nice touch of picsnte!

Love this recipe! I make some minor tweaks... 1) cut the chili powder in half, add one or two fresh diced jalenpeno instead; 2) cut out the 1 1/2 tsp salt; 3) use just over a pound of ground turkey (instead of 1.5 lbs); 4) use 2 cups of chicken broth, add additional water if needed as it simmers; 5) mix up the beans! black, kidney, white beans, etc; 6) eat with fresh crusty bread or simple nachos (chips with chedder cheese or jack cheese and fresh diced jalepeno, in the broiler for 5 min). I get about 7 servings out of the recipe. Enjoy!

Great recipe!!thick and tasty with just the right degree of tang. Like any good recipe, the secret is in using the best and freshest ingredients. Ordinary canned tomatoes can be just so-so, and also because I wanted to add a little heat, I used Trader Joe's diced and fire-roasted organic canned tomatoes with green chiles. Perfecto! I also used Tj"s organic, vine-ripened tomato sauce, and fresh bottles of ground cinnamon, dried oregano, and chili powder. The only other changes I made were to use a good free-range chicken broth instead of beef (since I don't eat red meat), and exchanged one of the 3 cans of white beans for red kidneys, which gives the dish a little more color. The seasoning was outstanding with no further adjustments. This recipe makes a rather big pot, which pleases me greatly, since I'm already looking forward to the leftovers. I'll be making this one again for sure!

My go to chili recipe and the family loves it. The cocoa powder and cinammon add a richness to the chili. I do have a couple of modifications. I like my chili less soupy so I do not add any broth. Also, I use any cans of beans available in the pantry and substitute a can of corn for one can of beans. Usually use fire roasted tomatoes too. Enjoy!

I think the key to this recipe is to think of it as a base. You can add all sorts of things to really amp it up. I add tons of extra veggies to mine in order to round out the flavor and nutrition. Adding spice works too!

Tonight I reduced the carbs by cutting the beans in half and using chopped green pepper and zucchini. It was just as good.

This is a terrific little recipe. The turkey keeps it healthful, while the beef broth and spices add body and flavor. The cinnamon and cocoa powder are a nice mole-inspired twist. I supplemented the turkey with about 1/4 pound of leftover grass-fed ground beef and substituted about 2 TBSP of the chili powder with ground chipotle chiles from the spice section. This worked and deepened the flavor even more. Also I used Mexican-style stewed tomatoes instead of whole ones because I had a can that was about to expire. This worked so well that next time I will sauté a chopped green pepper and maybe even some minced zucchini with the onion, to up the veggie quotient. Easy, delicious and healthful. Total cost of the ingredients was less than $20 even with top-quality and organic brands.

Fantastic flavor profile. Great with the garnishes but also great without. Will definitely make this again.

My whole family loved this recipe! Made a few changes due to missing ingredients in my pantry ... used 1 can each of white, kidney and black beans and substituted spicy Bloody Mary mix for tomato sauce. Also cut the chili powder back to 1 tsp due to my 6 yo daughter not liking spicy food. I would probably add a little more next time, or a lot more if my daughter weren't eating it.

This is my go-to chili recipe and I've made it countless times. I thought I had developed a pretty good one myself over the years, but the addition of cocoa powder and beef stock really amps up the depth of flavor. The only thing I've kept from my old recipe is the roasted tomatillos, which I roast separately and add in while the chili is cooking. Oh, and occasionally I'll add chorizo - just for kicks.

Rating: 4
This has been my go- to chili recipe for years. My 9 year old daughter loves it, but not so hot, so I usually make it with only 1/3 of the chili powder. Also, I use whatever beans I have in the house, and almost never use beef stock (we are kosher and I never have kosher beef stock). Vegetable stock works really well too.

My first chili ever, and I may never look for another recipe! Substituted garbanzo beans for white beans...sounds weird, but my kiddo takes to them better, and they worked out fine.

I only had ~1lb of ground turkey so I cut all the ingredients accordingly (used only 2/3s of stated amounts), however I used one can each of white kidney beans, chickpeas and whole kernel corn. I let the chili simmer for almost an hour but found it too watery, so I added 1/2 cup of quinoa and let it simmer for another hour and it was PERFECT! Full of flavour and packed with protein! So good!

This recipe is surprisingly wonderful. Made the recipe as written except substituted turkey bone broth (frozen from the holidays) for the beef broth. Shared this with friends, and they were impressed. Not a scoop remained.

Rating: 4
Loved this. I couldn't find any ground turkey or chicken, so I used a combination of ground pork and beef. I was concerned about it being too fatty/greasy, so I browned the meat in a separate pan, drained the fat, then added to the onions. For spices, I used only 1/8 cup chili powder (mine's pretty spicy, so I was hesitant to use a full 1/4 cup) and added a small can of diced green chilis. The heat was perfect, nice and complex flavors. Really looking forward to using a dark beer in lieu of some broth next time, that sounds like such a good complement to the unsweetened cocoa!

Rating: 0
Fantastic flavors, but I agree with my husband that it's a little sweet. I added mexican red chili's with the seeds, green chili's, a shot of tabasco, and a beer. I also used an onion soup base because I didn't have beef broth....wow. I mixed in white, red and black beans, too. It's sweet and hot. Drink beer and watch football food. It's fantastic!

This was excellent. My kids who don't like beans loved it too. I used 1 lb of ground turkey. My husband would like to see more "meat" in the chili so I will add the 1 1/2 lbs next time. I lowered the amount of chili powder for my daughter and will use the full amount next time. Also, I used chicken broth like many reviewers said they did but will for next time try the stout and chicken broth combo. This is now going to be part of the rotation.

I have made this recipe about 5 times and loved it every time. The only changes I make are that I use chicken broth instead of beef and I use 1 can each of white kidney beans, kidney beans and black beans - instead of 3 cans of white beans. It's absolutely delicious!

Absolutely wonderful - be sure to use high quality spices, it makes all the difference. I did one batch with a no name chili powder that we grabbed when there wasn't a larger size of a better brand. No where near as good.

Very yummy! Used half ancho chile powder and half regular for a slightly smokier flavour. Also, used about a cup and a half of chicken stock and about a half a can of Guinness stout (no beef stock)as suggested by another reviewer. Amazing how the small amounts of cocoa and cinnamon come through just perfectly.

Rating: 4
This dish is amazing and it is addictive as other reviewers have mentioned! A quick note the first time I made it my 15 year old son noticed the cocoa so I thought it may be too much so lessened the amount the next time and not as good. Use the exact amounts of spices (I also add cayenne and vary the beans) the flavors melded overnight are much better and it definately needs the toppings! A great dish enjoy!

Wonderful rich flavored chili and very easy to make. Only change was chicken instead of beef broth.

this. needs. peppers. If you like mild chili's, then this is a pleasant one, but if you like anything even remotely spicy, you'd be wise to add some jalepenos or serranos. If I make again, I'll also add a bit more cocoa powder, since I think that was overpowered by the chili powder (not less chili powder).

Rating: 4
Ok...so I have to (part of my personality, I guess) change any recipe that I see. This was a great base recipe, but I made a couple of changes. First, I used 50/50 chicken stock and stout (yes, that wonderful English beer) instead of beef stock. Satisfied the non-beef people in the family. Second, instead of 1 tbs of cocoa powder and 1/4 cup of chili powder I used 1/8 cup cocoa chili blend and 1/8 cup of chili powder. Kicks up the sweetness a bit. I also added red peppers for some color. It was, by far, the best chili I have ever cooked.

Fantastic. Delicious, simple to make chili. This is a rich flavored, not spicy chili recipe. Works well for large crowds and diverse palates. We doubled this recipe to serve to parents during my daughter's birhtday party. When I went to have a bowl, all the chili was gone!! We would make this again.

After you add a ton of yoghurt and onions, it's a good chili. Next time I'll reduce the beans in favour of more meat. Not top 5 of chili recipes we've tried, but worthy of further experimentation.

Love this recipe! I don't think it's too much cinnamon, but don't add more than exactly what is called for.. cayene does a little extra something to it that I quite enjoy as well. I use dry white beans and about the same amount of liquid (more economical/tasty too) and it comes out great, not too watery! my picky kids & my husband love this. Makes great leftovers too, and don't leave out the red onion/cilantro/s. cream topper. Having had it both ways, the toppings are a MUST!!

I have made this numerous times and everyone always loves it. Have made it both on the stovetop and in the crockpot. Changes I make: only use 1 lb turkey; increase to 4 cans of beans using white, black and chili; use diced tomatoes; only use 1 onion. Freezes great!

This has become our go-to chili recipe. The spice blend make it very flavorful and spicy without being hot. Our 2 and 4 year old love it. We usually only use 1 lb of turkey or less, adding more beans (and usually we use a mix of black beans, garbanzos, white beans- whatever is in the pantry). I also prefer using crushed tomatoes. I like that the recipes makes a lot, so that for our family of 2 adults 2 kids we can freeze half for another meal or have tons of leftovers. Highly recommmend!

This is one of my best chili recipes. I made several changes to decrease calories and for convenience. It is yummy! Omitted oil and sprayed pan, used fresh oregano 3 tsp., decreased turkey to 10 oz browned well, decreased chili powder to 3 tbsp, used diced rather than whole tomatoes, decreased beef broth to 2 1/2 cups, used chili-ready tomatoes w/juice for tomato sauce (really added good flavor), used dried small white beans soaked overnight and added them at the same time as the tomatoes. Simmered about 2 hrs or until beans were tender. Great flavor!

This is one of my favorite go-to chilis. It's very healthy - low in fat and calories. It also happens to be very tasty and satisfying especially in the winter time. I often add some fresh herbs like parsley or oregano to the ground turkey and throw in more tomatoes than the recipe calls for. Serve the chili with a little greek yogurt at the end, with some crusty Italian bread on the side.

Excellent! Beautiful color, robust taste, and the white beans are the right choice. Having read other reviews saying this was watery, I did not add any broth to start, but had some ready. Over the 45-minute simmer period I ended up adding all of it, a third at a time.

Very versatile and the family loves it. The cocoa and cinamon add a richness to the chili.

Very satisfying, and rich tasting. I used Chili 3000 spices from Penzey's since I was running out of chili powder. It added depth and I omitted tomato sauce, using some tomato paste I had on hand, and 20 oz crushed tomatoes. I used pinto and kidney beans instead. Perfect for a yummy comfort food fall dinner!

Easy and delicious. A nice combination of flavors raises this above the usual chili. The color is so rich and deep and it smells terrific. I used about half regular chili powder and for the rest, used medium and chipotle chili powder we brought back from a trip to New Mexico this summer. I didn't use tomato sauce, used the double concentrate paste many people recommended. The amount of broth can be adjusted to the consistency you like. I usually end up using the whole 3 cups. Highly recommend this great winter dish!

This is always a hit whenever I make it. Instead of the beef broth, I substitute beer in the same amount (porter or ale) and it gives the chili a very rich flavor. I've made this 2 years in a row for dinner parties and it will be part of my permanent recipe box!

This fantastic chili is a family favorite in fall and winter! Consider theses slight modifications, which are subtle but nice. Turkey stock (I make it a couple times a year and freeze it), roasted whole tomatoes, a medley of beans (kidney, pinto & white) and fresh ground cinnamon. Either way, this chili is great!

This recipe is simple enough to make for even a novice cook like me. I added two extra bay leaves which added a nice hearty flavor, and I also swapped the chili powder out for sriracha (which made it slightly less spicy but added a nice tang). I suggest not starting it if you're extremely hungry, as the simmer is 45 minutes and the whole house gets filled up with a delicious food smell that will drive you mad!!! Go nuts with the chopped fresh red onions and cilantro, they add a really great kick to the dish; I personally prefer it with yogurt instead of sour cream. I served this over simple jasmine rice with a little fresh tarragon chopped in - it's a nice combination.

I've made this a couple times now, and it's terrific. Last time, I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out great. The only problem was that it wasn't spicy enough for our tastes, so this time I added a couple pinches of cayenne and it was perfect. Also this time I didn't have any turkey on hand so I substituted a bag of frozen corn, and it worked really well. I serve it with the Sage and Honey Skillet Cornbread, also from this site. This recipe is a keeper.

Delicious and fully satisfying. I am considering substituting red meat for the turkey, as well, just to see how that works out. BTW, I did bump up and vary the spices a bit, adding chipotle power and a mild green chili powder, as well as some red pepper flakes. It gave a nice balance to the chili flavor.

Absolutely delicious! Added a generous amount of red pepper flakes and cayenne to give it a little more kick, and I would recommend doing this even if you aren't a fan of spicy foods - they just add a nice depth of flavor. Also used four cans of beans instead of three, and drained diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. If I had to do it again I'd use the sauce, but the diced tomatoes worked just fine. If you prefer a thicker chili, I recommend pureeing one can of beans and adding them to the liquid. **Let the chili simmer with beans for about 45 minutes and then ladled it into a container to be refrigerated overnight. This was pivotal!! The flavors need time to meld. Definitely make this ahead and reheat it to serve.**

I've made this recipe several times and it's unbeatable. I don't even use any of the garnish. Go for the full amount of chili powder--it is not a spicy dish (please note the difference between ground chilis and chili powder...) I make it usually as 2/3 of the stated amount because I buy a package of one pound turkey. I use the full size 28 oz can of tomatoes but omit the tomato sauce. The proportions even out that way.

I think this is quite possibly the best chili I have ever made. I did make a few alterations. First I substituted sunflower oil for vegetable, chicken broth for beef, 14 ounces of fire roasted tomatoes for tomato sauce, and added in 4 roughly chopped skinned roma tomatoes. I also happened to have recently run out of cinnamon for which I substituted nutmeg and added 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper to the second herb/spice infusion. I only used one can of black beans and one can of cannelli... and... I think I stewed for about 20 more minutes after the addition of the beans and topped this with a dollop of sour cream and fresh chopped chives.

Love this recipe so much that I have made it twice in 2 weeks. Great flavor! I use Hatch Chili powder from New Mexico and 1/4 cup is fine. I also use one can each of white, black and kidney beans because I like the variety. When I heat it up tonight, I am going to add a couple of leftover chipotle chilis in adobo that I have in my refrigerator to give it a little extra zip. My husband is usually the "Chili- Pro" in our house, but even he admits that the flavor of this recipe is great! Love that it's a pretty healthy too!

This is a great chili, and my family loved it HOWEVER, when I made it the first night, we ended up without power, I put it in the fridge, and we went out to dinner. I have to say, that while it was cooking, I wasn't impressed. Since we didn't eat it the first night, we had it the next night as first time leftovers, and it was fantastic! The flavors had a chance to meld together, and the flavors were VERY smooth. We all loved it and I will be making it many times in the future!

Based on another reviewer I halved the chili powder but added a 1/4 tsp cayenne and pinch of red chili flakes. I had a couple of turkey chorizo sausages that needed to be used up so I added them to the mixture also. My husband is not a fan of beans but likes Pinto so I added just 1 can. I can highly recommend making this!!!

I LOVED THIS!! It is so different from the usual chili- it's like chili mole! I was determined to use what I had in the house without going out. I used 1 lb ground turkey, 1.5 cups broth, oh- I sauteed cubed eggplant first, removed it from the pan, and popped that in just before the beans, 1 can of chopped tomatoes and no tomato sauce; I used a bit of dried thyme instead of oregano...I had a fresh red hot chile that was hanging around my fridge and I (carefully- don't get it on your hands!) chopped that and sauteed it with the onions in the beginning...I'm trying to remember what else I did that was different (I wish I could see the recipe while I review)...I served it on top of some white rice, topped with a dollop of sour cream and chopped scallion. I skipped the grated cheese- the flavors in this are too awesome to cover up with grated cheese. The spice was awesome, the juices were great.

I made this for my husband and we both thought it was delicious. I did a few modifications though: i only used 1/8 cup of chili powder instead of 1/4 cup, and 2 cans of beans instead of 3. i also used sweetened cocoa powder instead of unsweetened because it's all i had. i would definitely recommend halving the chili powder like i did because it had the perfect amount of "kick" - i couldn't imagine it being twice as spicy. i reduced the beans too b/c my husband isn't crazy about them. overall it was a hearty, filling, cozy meal and this is going to be my go-to turkey chili recipe from now on.

I'm giving this 4 forks because my husband absolutely loved it and it's super healthy - very hard to accomplish with my beef and potato man. I thought it was delicious also, although I'm just not a big fan of the sweet and spicy, but if you are you will love it. I made minor substitutions based on what I had on hand. I used red kidney beans instead of white beans, tomatoes with green chilies in place of plain tomatoes, olive oil instead of vegetable, and added a little cayenne for more kick. My husband demands this gets put into the rotation.

I loved this chili! I have made it a couple times now, including for new years eve party where it was a big hit. I have made it with meat from leftover thankgiving turkey and rotisserie chicken, instead of the ground turkey. I dislike canned tomatoes so I have both left them out or reduced by 1/2 and both ways turn out great. I also went a little lighter on the chili powder and used chicken stock instead of beef. I love it with a mix of different beans (any kind will do) and have also added hominy (thanks to another reviewer) which really made it extra delicious. This is definitely going into the regular winter rotation.

This recipe was a huge hit at a pot luck I attended. The kids ignored the chicken nuggets in favor of this chili over rice. I used chicken instead of beef stock and since I misread the recipe ended up using only 1 15-oz can of white beans and used the black beans I had on hand to make up the difference. This will be a fall / winter staple on our house!

Really enjoyed this recipe. With only 8oz of tomato sauce and 25oz of whole tomatoes, it's not a very strong tomato base -- different than I'm used to. I did substitute 2 of the cans of beans with low sodium kidney beans and added a cup of chopped carrots for texture. I also added a tbsp of red pepper flakes for a little extra kick. I also think you can use 2c of beef broth and 1c of water to cut down on some of the salt without losing too much flavor.

We loved this chili. It is healthy and easy to make. Made it till almost done cooking and then transferred it to a crock pot on low for a few hours so it would be warm and ready for a Christmas party. Along with others, I made it with tomato paste for a thicker consistency and chopped canned tomatoes, used Imagine Brand,No-Chicken broth, my go-to broth, instead of beef. I think next time I might try some chipotle chiles or abado chiles to give it some more depth. As is, this recipe is fabulous and people loved it! Had a dish of nonfat Greek yogurt for topping and forgot to chop the cilantro but people still loved it. Highly recommended!

I have been experimenting with various chili recipes for YEARS and this one is incredible. I did make a few changes. For one, I added kidney beans also as another cook recommended. I also added one packet of Goya Sazon seasoning, which really brightened the flavors and took it up a notch. In addition, I added some shredded fresh rotiserre turkey at the end ...

Great and easy dinner! After reading everyone's comments I made the following changes: 1) used 2 cups of chicken stock instead of 3 cups of beef; 2) used about 2-3TB of double concentrated tomato paste instead of tomato sauce; 3) added zucchini, frozen corn and adobo chilies. We had it on top of elbow macaroni with red onion, jalapenos and sour cream as toppers. YUM!!

Really delicious straightforward recipe. It has a bit of a mole taste to it which is lovely for fall. I would definitely recommend this recipe. It is especially good, if you are like me in a two person household, to make the full size recipe, have a dinner or two and freeze the other half of it.

Made this for dinner tonight along with some Jiffy mix corn muffins following another reviewers suggestion. I went with low sodium beef stock and no salt tomato sauce. I then used just 1 tsp salt. After I put it in I noticed that what I had used was in fact sweetened cocoa powder which worked just fine. I also used 3 different kinds of beans, white, black and kidney. So my modifications were minor at best. The chili got rave reviews from my household and I'm guessing will become part of my repertoire from now on. I'm thinking of having some of the leftover chili later on this week, this time on a salad perhaps. Thanks for the recipe. Really enjoyed it and thanks for the many suggestions which were very helpful.

I made this almost exactly as written and I have to say it was fabulous. The only change I made was to double the cinnamon which I do in every recipe and also used a can of black beans as a substitute for white. I am by no means someone who is highly skilled in the kitchen so I look for simple recipes that produce big results and flavor. This chili was just so good. Enjoyed it was simple Jiffy corn bread and baked sweet potatoes with whipped butter, brown sugar and cinnamon. While I am typically pretty strict with my diet and tend not to splurge on carbs very much, I do feel stuffed but this meal was well worth it. I'll gladly work those carbs off! Make this and enjoy a wonderful, warm cold fall night meal!

Just made it. Its delicious..and I suspect will become only more flavorful. The chocolate, cinnamon (I put in double amounts of both) and beef broth add a real sense of depth and richness this dish. As I have read from others, I agree that adobes would really complement this dish! Perfect to dole out into single servings, freeze, and enjoy a healthy and energy lasting high protein, relatively low-fat, low-carb easy (and overall inexpensive!) lunch at work.

LOVE this chili, I make it all the time. I add 1-2 chipotle chilis in adobo sauce, and a little of the sauce, as well as 1 serrano chili towards the end of cooking. I also add a chopped zucchini and a can of corn towards the end, which gives the chili a nice crunch. I use a combo of white, kidney and chili beans. Delicious recipe, and so easy to tailor to your liking!

This was yummy except it was a little salty (and I like salt). I would probably forgo the salt all together since the beef broth has salt. I modified the recipe to match each ingredient's can size. I also reduced the beans to 1/3 of the recipe and changed the beans to kidney since that's what I had. Here are the modifications: 2x14oz diced tomatoes, 1x14oz beef broth, 1x15oz tomato sauce, 1x15.25oz kidney beans. Essentially the difference between the recipe and what I did was 2x the tomato sauce and reduced the broth to 2/3. This way I did not have to deal with half can left overs. BTW, the dollop sour cream is a must!

Made it just like it said..but didn't mind it being a bit more liquid in the beginning.. It thickened as it simmered and next time I'll add in some different additions. I will probably top it off with some diced jalapeno,along with the red onion,sour cream, cilantro..

I have been making this chili since I first saw the recipe in 1997 and I have adapted it over the years. I love the white beans and my husband doesn't so for him I make it without the beans. This recipe taught me how to improvise in the kitchen. The basic recipe is really delicious and stands up to whatever variations you can come up with. It freezes REALLY well.

I had this at a friend's house yesterday. It was delicious. She made it with shredded cooked turkey, which was really great. The white beans were really tasty, and were a nice change from the usual kidney beans. The seasoning was perfect. I can't wait to make it at home.

I make this chili all the time. I like to use tomato paste instead of tomato sauce to thicken it up a bit. I change it up occasionally by using different kinds of beans--I really like a combination of white beans and kidney beans. Also, the last time I made it I added a diced jalapeno and a few dashes of cayenne pepper to bring up the spice. I love this recipe!

This is a wonderful recipe. Do NOT omit the cocoa powder. It really "makes" this recipe. I used pinto beans; I had them on hand. It was good the first day and fabulous the 2nd. I turned it into chili-mac the 2nd day and garnished with scallions and shredded sharp cheddar. YUM YUM!

This recipe was great and a classic - as per other reviewer suggestions I used chicken stock instead of beef, a variety of beans (chickpeas, black and red kidney) instead of white, and used a small can of tomato paste instead of sauce and it came out perfectly! It does need a bit more kick so I added hot pepper flakes.

I have made this twice, the first time I followed the recipe closely. I used tomatoe paste and less broth as advised by previous reviewers. I found that the chili was too sweet and a bit bland. The second time I added three gloves of garlic and a few jalapenos. I also reduced the cocoa by half, big improvement.

Rating: 4
Since many reviewers had suggested reducing the liquid, I did just that and this was PERFECT. I used one 6 oz can of tomato paste, veggie broth (only 2 cups plus a little) and the diced tomatoes were an excellent choice. Next time, I will use BOTH packages of the turkey meat (20 oz each) and it will be fine. It will make it much thicker. YUMMY. Even a 3 year old ate it because it was not too spicy and the grownups added hot sauce and were happy too!

This is a great recipe -- very easy, quick, cheap, and delicious. I modified it a bit: used a small can of whole tomatoes and 2 cans of tomato paste. Also used chicken broth. a friend suggested that light beer might be a good sub for the broth -- I'll try that next time.

This recipe is exceptional - makes a very good starting point. I made a number changes to suit my tastes including adding 4 cloves of garlic and 2 jalapenos, increasing the turkey to 2 lbs., increasing the chili powder to 1/3 cup (and combining different spices incl. chipotle, cayenne, red pepper flakes, etc.), adding 4 cups beef stock, 1 bottle dark beer, and 4 cans of beans (2 white/2 black). Love it! It freezes perfectly as well.

I made this per the recipe and found it to be delicious - and set apart from other chili recipes. The genius is in the spice base. I did not find it too wet, especially upon reheating. After Thanksgiving, I made this dish for the 2nd time to make the best use of leftovers and what was in my pantry. I utilized leftover turkey breast meat instead of ground turkey. I also used chicken stock instead of beef broth and two large (28 oz.) cans of diced tomatoes, drained, instead of whole tomatoes. Draining keeps the wetness down. I also omitted the tomato sauce. To top it off, I added zucchini (approx 5 cups, cut into chunks lightly steamed) durinng the last minutes. Served over brown rice, this was amazing. This is a recipe that can probably stand up to many subtle improvs! TRY THIS - exchange shredded cooked turkey breast for ground turkey exchange diced (drained) tomatoes for whole tomatoes exchange chicken stock for beef broth add 4-6 cups of chunked zucchini slightly pre- steamed at the end of simmering omit tomato sauce

This is amazing chili! I made it w/only 2cups broth and tomoto paste; it was too thick for my husband so we added the extra cup of broth. He likes to soak up the sauce with bread, so next time I'll make it as-is, and still add a dried chili pepper. It was excellent.

Super easy! I made it for a chili craving tonight with what I had on hand. Substituted ground beef (for ground turkey) and chili sauce (for tomato sauce). Only had 1 can of beans. But, it tasted great! I can't wait to buy the proper ingredients, and try it to the letter. Only thing is that I think the "serves 8" is a bit of a stretch. We only had enough for 4 servings, but may be the lack of beans.

I've made this many times. my family and I adore it!!! I like it not so hot and I think as is it's perfect. My hubby adds his heat later. I am a heart patient, so I needed to lower the sodium. I use dried beans soaked overnight. Then cook the beans with onion and garlic (I use black beans). I use fresh Roma tomato's (steam de-skin and de-seed ) and lowered sodium sauce. It makes it more work but oh so worth it. And for me it makes something previous off-limits to something I can now have. After simmering for a couple of hours, you'll never guess it's ground turkey.

I have never felt compelled to write a review about any recipe I have found online until now. I am a mother of 2 (both under 2) with little time to cook and prepare dinner. The three things that I love about this recipe are: 1) it's a one pot meal 2) it's made with the staples I usually keep on hand (or, I can substitute with something I have on hand) and 3) it is delicious!! Such a good flavor combo. I love it as is, but my husband adds a bit of kick. I did use tomato paste instead of sauce since a few reviews complained it was too soupy. It seemed to do the trick. I will make this again and again.

Realy liked this chili. Only had 2 cans of beans on hand, so added a can of corn, as well. Also added several hot/smoked peppers to kick up the heat a little (I like it much spicier than most people). Still, it did not change the depth of flavor imparted by the cocoa. Will make again.

Made this exactly to the recipe and it was delicious! The cocoa and cinnamon definitely pair well together and add a surpise richness to the dish. Definitely use the cocoa if you can! I mashed up some of the beans before adding in b/c I had read reviews that it was a little soupy. After simmering for 45 minutes though and then adding the beans, that consistency was perfect. YUM!

Great chili! Just made it today. I took some of the advices from the other reviews: I added garlic, cayenne, and jalapenos -- very much worked out to my advantage. (I like a good kick in my chili.) Also, I added chili mix instead of chili flakes; if this happens to you, don't add any salt. My only qualm is that it was a little soupy; the next time I make it--and I will--I'll lose a cup of the stock.

What a perfect chili for a cold winter day. I halved the recipe and made just a few changes based on what I had on hand. First I used 1 T. chipotle chili powder and 1 T. regular chili powder--added a really nice smoky flavor that was great w/ the cocoa and cinnamon. As for beans I used 1 can of pinto (just love 'em) and 1 can great northern. Served this w/ a dollop of sour cream, green onions and jack cheese. Really, really great turkey chili.

I was testing this recipe for a party and wanted a non-beef chili. It is easy to prepare but not distinctive. The chili can be made hotter by adding a serrano or jalapeno pepper. Most chili powders are a blend of spices. The brands sold in the southwest are hotter and more pure.

Very tasty, but I found it to be overly salty (the chili powder I used is partly to blame - it has salt in it, and to make the chili hotter I kept adding chili powder!). I would also like to try adding a bit of crunch - maybe red and green peppers at the end.

Okay. I read many reviews on how this did not have enough "kick" and decided to go out and get all fresh chile powder. So I combined Green Chile Powder, Cayenne Chili Powder, De Arbol Chile Pepper, and Ancho Chile Pepper - for a total of a 1/4 cup. There is plenty of "kick". Maybe people's spices are a little old. This was an excellent recipe and it definitely lends room for a little creativity as people have said.

Fantastic recipe! My only minimal changes are that I add some red pepper flakes and decrease the amount of broth. The flavors are well-blended and more complex than most chili recipes I've tried.

This recipe is also excellent in a slow cooker. Simply throw all the ingredients in and put on Low for 6-7 hours. Use 99% fat free turkey in this method or you'll get too much oil. If you can only get 94%, brown the turkey first and drain before putting it in the recipe. It comes out even better in the slow cooker because it has plenty of time to simmer. This is a chili recipe that has always tasted better the second day, and it gives the "second day flavor" on the first day with this method.

Based on the glowing reviews, I guess I was expecting a lot out of this chili. I found the recipe as-is to be kind of blah. Not very savory. Part of the issue, I guess, is that turkey is less flavorful than beef. However, the cocoa and cinnamon add some nice subtlies. I found that this recipe was improved by adding a lot more chili powder than was called for. I also added fresh taragon (cooked in the leaves, then removed them), which improved the aftertaste. This chili is OK. However don't get your hopes up.

This chili is incredible! The flavors blend beautifully. I actually halved the recipe and forgot to cut the broth in half, so mine had a little more liquid. It was so rich I can't imagine how it would have been with half the broth. Anyway, extra liquid was good. Made it nice to serve with rice. I ownd a restaurant in California and brought this in for the staff to eat. I was very happy to get the thumbs up from our sous chef.

I am not a fan of chili and this is incredibly delicious. I've made this many many times and everyone that tastes it asks me for the recipe. It's not heavy, and the flavor is very distinct because of the cocoa-again, different than regular chili which is probably why I like it. I even won a chili cook off with this recipe (though that time I didn't have turkey so I used pork) and there were almost 40 other entries. I tasted most of them and none even came close.

I think this chili has a very nice, warm, low-key flavor to it. It isn't spicy at all; I added a few shakes of cayenne for a little kick and it was just right (it didn't detract from the flavor at all).

An extra-comforting take on an established comfort food. I made this with boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces, then pretty much proceeded according to the recipe.

This is basically chili. Nothing special about it, but nothing that memorable either. It is decent while you're eating it, but it has a slightly unpleasant aftertaste. This is only my opinion, because it's obviously loved by most people, but I'm posting just so I see this review and it jogs my memory should I come across the recipe again.

Rating: 4
I agree with all the rave reviews of this here - it is quite good. I made this for friends who are vegetarian (but will eat poultry), so I substituted vegetable broth for the beef broth and it turned out great. Also had one can of white beans and two of black in the house, and that mixture was delicious. I'll definitely be making this again.

We have made this recipe many times and it has proven to be a winner. We mostly use ground turkey, but in the event you can't find it, low fat ground beef works well too. For the beans, I have used black beans, kidney beans and pintos. Also, I have added corn to the chili to give it a different twist. A wonderful recipe worthy making over and over again!

Rating: 4
Excellent, complex chili! The cocoa and cinnamon are what separates this from other chili recipes. I used crushed tomatoes since I don't like canned whole. Also, I think next time I'll reduce the salt to 1 teaspoon. Lastly, I used Better Than Broth instead of cubes for a richer broth.

I made this with leftover roasted turkey rather than ground turkey, it was excellent! The hint of chocolate flavor really gives it a unique flavor - yummmm!

Ground turkey chili will never have the flavor of chili made with beef, but this was good, especially if you have children who won't eat red meat. Will definitely make again.

Very good chili. Very easy. It definitely tastes like a beef chili because of all the broth, which is good or bad depending on your taste.

This dish was fantastic. I didn't even include the cocoa powder or bay leaves because they weren't on hand. I added one garlic clove and an extra 1/4 tsp cumin, one less can of beans and extra gr. turkey instead. A little more tomato sauce than was called for. And it was still superb. What a great fall dish!

I made a version of this with shredded cooked chicken and turkey chorizo sausages. I also added a chipotle chili and some jalapeno for kick. It's quite yummy!

P.S. Also added a couple of ancho chile peppers in adobo sauce for some heat and depth. Plus have made this chil with leftover roast chicken in place of the turkey (add last ten minutes of cooking) as well with vegetables only (stringbeans, potatoes, corn, thick chunks of squash, etc.) for vegan friends and it's been a hit every time.

Love this recipe. Used only one pound of ground turkey since it was all I had, sauteed some garlic with the onions, used one large can of fire roasted crushed tomatos and one small can of beef broth (skipped the tomato sauce) to make it thicker, subbed one regular can of black beans and one regular can of red kidney beans (both rinsed to get rid of extra salt) for the white beans and added a small can of green giant mexican corn to the chili 10 minutes before it was done. Also, since I had no unsweetened cocoa powder in the house used a snack size little bar of hersheys semi-sweet chocolate from our Halloween candy stash instead and it worked like a charm. Served it the next night for an impromptu dinner with friends and everybody licked their plates clean......

One tasty chili! Recipe makes about 9 cups. Cocoa powder and cinnamon are necessary, they add depth to the flavor and round out the finish. I too added one can of tomato paste for thickness. Would make a again!

Rating: 4
All the right ingredients, but the wrong amounts for my taste buds. I added 1.5x the chili and doubled the rest of the spices. I also like my chili much thicker, so I substituted tomato paste for the tomato sauce and used 2.5 cans of broth instead of three. After those modifications, I loved it!

I really loved this recipe. I've made it twice now and the second time I doubled the chili powder and added two cans of tomato paste and used kidney beans. I also put in a bit more cocoa and cinnamon because I liked the flavour so much. If you make this, take the advice of so many others and only use a cup or two of the beef stock. I can't wait to try a cup of dark beer one of these days. Delicious!!

Rating: 4
LOVE this! I have made it 4 times now and shared it with 3 friends and everyone has the same reaction. The first time, I made it exactly as stated and it was good, but not as "tomato-ey" or as spicy as I am used to living in AZ. My favorite substitutions are: 1 28-ounce can whole tomatoes( I like the Ro-tella ones with Green Chilis) 1 cups beef stock or canned beef broth 1 28-ounce can tomato sauce 3 15-ounce cans canellini beans 1/2 cup Chili Powder 1 Jalapeno pepper cut up and sauteed with the onions. This gives it more tomato flavor and a little more "kick" without losing the cocoa and cinnamon. My family is always amazed that it is turkey and not beef!

Rating: 3
Tried this recipe with suggested variations: Turkey bacon instead of oil, 1C dark beer/1C broth, 1can white and 1 can pinto beans. First time making chili and it was very good. It was a bit salty, probably because of the bacon, so next time I'll adjust. Great recipe!

Rating: 4
Made this for my family(about 20 people)on Superbowl XL Sunday and it was a huge hit. I used 3 strips of bacon, chopped and cooked, instead of using the oil and added chopped bell pepper and minced garlic to the onions as well. I followed all other's advice and only used the two cans of beans and made one of them pinto beans instead of the white. On the second batch, I made two, I halved the amount of cinnamon and cocoa that the recipe calls for and oh yeah, I used Hershey's semisweet cocoa instead of the unsweetened type. I think most everybody there asked for the recipe!

My husband was turned off by (surprise!) it is turkey instead of beef, but I really enjoyed it and will make it again after he has forgotten about it. Used two cans of white beans and one of dk red kidney beans and that worked out well in a pinch.

I made a special point of coming back to rate this receipe. I have made it three times now, it is now a family favorite. At the end of the meal there is not a bite left in the pan. Don't be afraid to make this with the Chili and the Cocoa, I've used Hersey's special dark cocoa, YUM!

This is absolutely delicious and hard to beleive it's low fat/low cal. Great smoky flavor. Really easy, too. Only two minor substitutions... I used diced tomatoes, and cannelini beans instead of whole tomatoes and small white beans. The results were just as good and I will make this again and again. It's seriously great.

This is very light and flavorful, as chilis go. Per the advice of previous reviewers, I used only 2 cans of beans and added 1 T. of molasses and 2 T. rice vinegar. I subbed chicken broth for the beef broth (didn't have any), and used only 14 oz. of tomatoes (didn't have 28 oz.). I also added 3 T. brown sugar (I like my chili sweet), and 2 chopped bell peppers, and used a 10 oz. can of enchilada sauce in place of the tomato sauce (again, due to necessity). Next time I'll try it with the full amount of tomatoes and use beef broth for a fuller flavor.

Rating: 3
I enjoyed the richness that the cocoa and the cinnamon added & I used roasted tomatoes (canned) which added smokiness and depth. Next time I might pass on the beef broth, or substitute stout for at least part of it (or even tomato juice). The broth seemed to give the chili a slightly greasy quality (which seems strange, given that the broth is low fat...). Over all, though, very good dish & would definately make it again.

Rating: 3
Yum! The cocoa and cinnamon give the chili a nice rich flavor. If I were making this again, I might substitute beer for some of the liquid and add a bit more chili powder. But I can't complain about this recipe; it turned out great!

This is a great "bring someone dinner" dish. I brought the chili and some corn muffins to my friend who just came home from the hospital with her newborn son - she and her husband LOVED IT! I double the oregano and throw in some chipotle powder and smoked paprika (Penzey's spices), which really adds to the earthy flavors. The last time I made it I didn't have canned tomatoes so I threw in 24 oz of canned sp. sauce. It was still fabulous!

This is really good. I was surprised how delicious and meaty the turkey ended up being. I used 2 cans of black beans because that's what I had, and it struck me as the right amount of beans for the recipe. It had a great flavor which I'm sure will only be better tomorrow. I thought it could be spicier, though, so I'll probably add cayenne in the future. I added a few dashes of hot sauce at the table and that worked pretty well. Maybe in the future I'll follow the other reviewers and use a chipotle and throw in some veggies. Very good!

I made this for a work party last Thursday and am still getting compliments today (Tuesday). This was terrific! And very easy to make!

Rave reviews from family and friends. This chili is tastey and easy to make. Ideal for those who prefer a meaty chili to a bean-filled chili. Made it one day ahead in the crockpot. Sauted the onions+garlic and spices then the ground turkey. Added this mixture and other ingred. to the crockpot. Also decreased the chili powder, added a small can of diced tomatoes w/ jalapenos, less broth, more cinnamon and cocoa powder. Served with corn bread, honey and green onions. Yummy.

i make this chili all the time (in fact, i'm making it right now) and it is everyone's favorite. like others, i've evolved this recipe to fit my taste. instead of the oil in the beginning, i use 1/2 lb of bacon (turkey bacon if you still want it to be healthier) and saute the onions in the bacon fat. used chipotle chili powder..such a great smoky flavor. i replaced the cocoa w/instant coffee and added 2 Tbsp of brown sugar. this goes soooo well with the cinnamon and smoky chipotle. and lastly, definitely go with the 1 c. broth/1 c. dark beer scenario. mmmmm...:P~~

Good, solid chili (and pretty good for you too!). I doubled the recipe, substitued 1 cup of beer for a cup of the beef broth, and added the juice of half a lime at the end for contrast. Topped it with red onion, sour cream, and grated cheddar. Definitely recommend making in advance - the flavor gets better after it sits a day or two.

A great way to use leftover turkey from the holidays, which I added closer to the end of preparation, with the beans (1/2 white, 1/2 garbanzo). We enjoyed this with friends last night after tobogganing. I'm sure the leftovers will be even better. Try adding more veggies - celery, carrot, zucchini, corn.

This chili was delicious and very easy to make. I used a mixture of pinto, black and pink beans and doubled the chili powder. The cinnamon adds a subtle note my guests loved.

Excellent! I added a can of chipotles in adobo sauce, used left over roasted turkey, home made veal stock and only 2 cans of beans. I've only tasted it, and the flavor is great, although spicy due to the chipoltes--I can feel endorphins already! A keeper!

This is an excellent chili recipe! I love the combination of flavors, especially the spices. I also like a thicker chili, so I didn't add all of the broth.

Excellent! I substituted ground chicken and a little leftover roast chicken for the turkey. Had some guests who aren't fire eaters, so I halved the amount of chili powder. For the timid, 1/8 cup of chili is fine; I would have preferred the 1/4 called for in the original recipe, as I ended up adding both Tabasco and Sriracha. The combination of spices, especially the cinnamon and cocoa, gives a nice rich complexity. Cilantro and sour cream are wonderful additions.

This is a great recipe for leftover roasted turkey. I had just cooked an 18 lb. turkey and had about 16 lbs in leftovers. I chopped 5-6 cups of white & dark meat & used that instead of ground turkey. Thanks to all of the reviewers who suggested increasing the spices. I added about 33% more of the dry spices and also added 1/4 tsp. cayenne to make it really spicy. Preparing the ingredients the night before--combining spices, chopping vegetables & meat, made this an easy dish to have on the table quickly.

I thought this was great and simple. I used extra lean ground turkey and did not have any unsweetened cocoa. Also, I only had chicken broth and for means I used what I had (1 can black, 1 can pinto and 1 can cannelini). I heeded the watery warning from other readers and so instead of can of while tomatoes I used a can of tomato puree and tomoto sauce and put some chopped roma tomotos. Also, I used 2.5 c of chicken broth. It was a gret dish and my husbad had thirds!

This is a great recipe - flexible and virtually fool-proof. I have made substitutions, such as using a mixture of kidney, black and white beans instead of just white, with much success. I have also used chicken stock instead of beef and increased the amount of spices on occasion. The end result has always been good. I highly recommend this recipe as written as well as with the aforementioned substitutions.

This was my first time actually making chili and it turned out quite well. I was hoping that the liquids would cook down while it simmered, but next time I will reduce the amount of broth. I will also reduce the amount of chili powder, as it seemed to overpower the other seasonings. I added some chopped orange and green peppers, carrots, and celery for some color and texture - I am glad I did! Overall - I was very pleased!

My group of friends has been making this as our main chili recipe for the last six years. One of us even won his employer's annual chili cook off with this recipe.

This was my first stab at chili, and it was great! My husband usually makes it. I did not add the cinnamon and chocolate because that just sounded too weird.

Yummy! Can't wait to remake this one during football season!

I thought this was quite good. It also freezes pretty well (texture suffers a little bit, but still just fine). I like mine with green onions instead of red on top, and I use chopped tomatoes, easier to eat. This is really good with some corn bread, try the "easy corn bread" recipe.

I also reduced the liquid in this recipe and the consistency came out properly thickened: I drained the whole tomatoes before adding to chili, and used only 2 cups of broth. I also changed the beans: I used 1 drained can each of red and black beans, and used 1 undrained can of "chili beans" which are beans in a chili-spiced tomato sauce. I also like my chili spicy and added cayenne pepper. We ate this over rice or over spaghetti noodles (Cincinatti style) with melted cheddar on top.

I know I'm in the minority here, but I really didn't think this tasted very good. I'm not an expert on chili, but I think it ought to have a perceptible tomato flavor. After tasting this recipe, I decided to add an additional can of tomato paste (partly, also, because the stock made it watery). But even so, the flavor just didn't seem particularly robust. It wasn't inedible, it just wasn't very tasty (and I don't think the cocoa powder is a good addition).

This has become my standard chili. It is so rustic and delicious! I have made it several times now, and have perfected it with the following additions: I use red and white beans as well as a can of corn.

I have gotten rave reviews from friends and family, and this is a great recipe for doubling when having company over for the Eagles game!

This is my favorite chili. I've made several from this site, but this one beats them all. It's easy to make and really tasty.

I have made this a few times now, the first time I followed the recipe to the letter and it was very good. I have made the following modifications for 1 kg (2.2lbs) of turkey; 4 onions, 1 heaping tblsp each oregano and cumin, omit salt, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, chili powder and cocoa powder unchanged but measured very full;tomatoes were 1 19oz stewed and 1 14oz diced both undrained, 2 cups beef broth, 2 19oz can beans, one red one white/or/black. Additions; 5 or 6 cloves crushed garlic and 1/4 tsp chili pepper powder or cayenne. Cooked uncovered to thicken. Had to rinse those beans well to get rid of the salt. The 1st time I didn't and it didn't taste very good. I love this chili.

I have been searching for a good chili recipe on this site for a while, and I am so glad I found this one! It is absolutely delicious, one of the best I've ever had! I was skeptical of the cocoa, but it works beautifully. I do not like very thick chili so I found the stock perfectly fine. I only added 1 1/2 cans of beans and it was still almost too thick. Agree that you need to add hot sauce if you like it that way. This is going right into my regular recipes. A classic!

This recipe has become my default pot-luck offering - but I just toss all the ingredients in a crock pot and let it simmer on low for 6-8hrs. That makes this recipe so easy!

I have tried several different turkey chili recipes the last few months, and this one is the best so far... I agree that it has too much liquid-- I had to add some corn starch to thicken it up, and look forward to substituting some dark beer next time. It also needs a little help in the zestiness department-- a few tablespoons of Louisiana hot sauce did the trick!

I don't think I'll ever make beef chili again. This chili was delicious. The only substitution I made was I used kidney beans instead of white beans.

Wonderful. There is a mellow smokiness in the sauce that complements the turkey and beans really well. I used leftover Christmas turkey instead of the ground ... and I think I have discovered a new after-Christmas tradition for our house! Great with football!

I do not like chili and I love this one! The turkey and cocoa are what sets it apart.It is one of my favorite winter meals. Serve it over rice with cheddar cheese on top. Yummy

This recipe has been a staple in my kitchen since its publication. I use only one onion and a variety of beans (pinto, white & kidney). Friends and family can't get enough of it, and nobody notices it's turkey rather than ground beef!

This is delicious. My husband took one bite & said, "Hmm...Hon, you just might have something here" (that's glowing praise coming from him).

My husband and I really liked this dish and I often find it difficult finding tasty ground turkey dishes. I will definitely be making this one again. I did use chicken stock instead of beef stock and the soup still tasted great. Although, I will be cutting the amount of salt in half because it tasted a bit too salty for me. Even though all the canned products I used were "no salt" added. I did use a mixture of beans like one reviewer suggested and I liked the flavor.

I added 21/2 cups of beef broth and it worked perfect! My Husband is a big chili lover and he said that this was the best yet! (and healthy)

This is pretty much the only chili I am allowed to make now. Everyone loves it. 2 cups of broth is plenty, 3 makes it too watery.

Delicious. I substituted chicken broth for beef broth. I don't eat or cook red meat & my husband who loves red meat said this is better than regular chili.A keeper for a weekday meal.

I used kidney beans(personal preference) the 2nd time I made it. Every friend I give it to loves this recipe.It only gets better the next day, if you have any left over.

My friends raved about this recipe when I made it for a chili-cook off party. I followed several reviewers' suggestions and added 1/2# ground chicken breast to the turkey, used 1 bottle dark beer with the chicken broth to total 3 cups liquid, and used a mixture of beans (cannelli, small white and pinto).

Rating: 4
I thought this came out wonderfully! I agree that 3 cans of liquid is too much - stick with 2. Added fresh corn instead of one of the cans of beans, and green onion at serving. Even the picky 6 year old liked it.

This recipe was so easy and incredibly tasty! I only used one onion and only had about 1/8 c of chili powder, but it was fabulous anyway. Probably the best chile recipe I've ever tried. I really like the turkey and white beans better than beef and red beans.

this is easy and full of flavor - i used chicken instead of beef stock and added cayanne for kick. next time i'll add fresh corn! yummm!

Overall, a wonderful recipe. The only change I made was instead of white beans, I used a combination of canned kidney and pinto beans (personal preferences).

Rating: 4
I've made this chili many times - always to rave reviews. I serve it over brown rice that I cook in beef stock. The only changes I make are to use less chili powder (about 1 tablespoon) because I have very young children who don't like it. And I use only two cups of stock. (I agree with one previous reviewer who found the amount of stock puzzling because it makes the chili too runny.) I will be making this chili for many years to come.

This has become one of the staples in my cooking repertoire. To me this is the perfect chili recipe and I wouldn't change a thing!! And easy to make, as well.

I had to try this recipe after reading all the great reviews it got. We thought it was delicious! I too changed a few ingredients. I used 2 pounds of turkey, added some chunky salsa in place of some of the tomatoes, used one can of chicken broth and one bottle of dark beer for the liquid and added a little hot sauce to give it a kick. I also used 3 different kinds of beans (red kidney, white beans and baked beans). The chocolate and cinnamon combination give it a unique flavor. I'll be making this again!

I had to try this recipe because of the rave reviews it received. I made this last night, and I must say it was very good. I used only 1 cup of beef broth and added a bottle of dark beer. This was definitely enough liquid. The only beans I had on hand were pinto and black, but they are usually what I use for chili anyway. The chocolate and cinnamon spiced it up really well, and gave it a Cincinnati chili flavor. I served it over rice, and topped it with chopped onions, grated cheese and sour cream. I'll bet it will be even better tonight. Can't wait!

I was wanting this type chili and jumped in before checking my cabinets so I had to make a few substitutions: I used left-over finely chopped turkey, a mix of stewed & regular tomatoes w/ green chili's, great northern beans & gabanzo beans, chicken broth and beer. The result was WONDERFUL!!! I'm going to top it with cheese and serve it with corn bread and salad. MMmmmmmm

This has been a favorite since I got the issue in Feb of '97! I use chicken broth instead of beef, only one can of beans, and 86ed the cinnamon. Now that I live out West, I have access to Chimayo chili powder....YUM!

Rating: 4
This was great! Instead of tomato sauce I used a can of tomato soup. This made it very creamy. I also thought it missed "a little kick" and added chili powder to taste, some red pepper flakes, and some hot sauce to help give it a kick. Next time, I would use the dark beer as others have recommeneded. YUM!!!

This is a really great turkey chili recipe and it results in minimal cleanup (1 pot). I made the following changes: added 3 cloves of garlic, 2 jalepenos, and 2 red peppers to the onion saute, used 1 bottle of beer (based on other reviews) and chicken broth for a total of 2 cups liquid, and I used cannelini beans. We eat chili a lot in this household and this is definitely one of the better recipes I've found. Yum!

Rating: 3
This is a wonderful recipe. I followed the advice of some of the reviewers and added dark beer in place of some of the beef broth, as well as using 2 lbs of turkey. Next time I will also take the advice of adding some kind of chilis for an additional kick, as I think it was missing just "a little something". Otherwise, we enjoyed it immensely, and my husband requested that I make it once a week.

How can something this "simple" taste so good? It does - it is wonderful. I used 2 pounds ground turkey, and garden fresh oregano, and 2 cups broth. Yummy and healthy. I put pieces of corn tortilla in mine.

I just made this dish and felt inspired to say how great it is. I definitely agree with the previous reviewers who added beer and some chipotles. I would also recommend the "Chipotle Beef Chile with Lime Crema" as another fantastic recipe.

I'm so happy to see that others love this recipe too. This is one of our main staples. We eat it all the time and never tire of it. It freezes well too.

I loved it! My husband did, too. I have only made it once so far, but I definitely plan on making it again!! I was thinking that it might be really good to substitute Olive oil in stead of vegetable . . . and also maybe double the amount of chili powder. Also, I like my chili really meaty, so maybe using 2 lbs turkey instead of 1 1/2. But the overall flavor and texture was wonderful! I served it with grated cheddar cheese and corn chips. Mmmmmmm.

I certainly appreciate these reviews. I loved the addition of cocoa. We made it hotter with chipotles like the other reviewer. Its now the Chili recipe in our house!

I have been making this chili for about 3 years and it is a wonderful recipe! Everyone loves it -- even people who claim that they hate chili. My husband does not like beans of any sort so I started making this substituting a bag of frozen corn for the beans. The extra-sweet corn is the best.

Rating: 4
Yum yum yum. Just as good as the other reviewers promised. I also substituted a bottle of dark beer for one cup of the beef broth, and added a couple of chipotle chilis for heat. And while I had my doubts about the cocoa powder and the cinnamon (they smelled funny during the simmering stage), the end result was fabulous.

Rating: 4
This dish is fantastic!!! I was a little doubtful about the chocolate powder because I'm not fond of mole, but it made the recipe delicious. Like some of the other cooks, I played around with it a bit. I added a fresh jalepeno and an ancho pepper. Since I didn't have fresh cilantro, I served it with monterey jack cheese. Then I served soft tortillas on the side. My husband, who is a picky eater, loved this dish. It is definitely a keeper.

I've been making this chili ever since that edition of Bon Appetit came out. Totally delicious, very healthy & makes a huge amount. One thing that always puzzles me.....I never use anything like the 3 cups of beef broth called for in the recipe. Two cups at the most. If I forget, & slosh all 3 cups in at once, the finished chili is much too runny. This recipe is a real keeper, incredibly easy to prepare & everyone loves it.

Rating: 3
Very good. I like my chili a little hotter though. Next time I'll substitute a can of Rotel for some of the tomatoes or maybe throw in some fresh jalapenos. I also used 2 c. chicken broth and a bottle of Fat Tire. As one reviewer said, this is a great one to play around with and fine tune for individual tastes.

Delicious! I served it over pasta and my husband loved it. I also added corn and 1 can of garbanzo beans instead of one of the white bean cans.

Fabulous! I was intrigued by the use of cocoa and cinnamon, and they definitely contribute to a complex and intriguing flavor. Substituted chicken broth for beef, and used Rao's marinara sauce instead of plain tomato sauce, since that's what was on hand. Results were outstanding. Definitely a keeper.

Very easy and tastey. We used 2 cups of beef broth and a bottle of Guiness Extra Stout. You can get pretty creative with the beans for variation. We loved the difference the cinnamon and chocolate made to the taste. Great with some sourdough bread.

Very Good. Much better than you typical variety. The chocolate and cinammon give it a punch. I made it w/ chicken broth and some prepared chili spices from Mccormicks. But regardless it was the best chili I've ever made.

Best turkey chili I ever made. Used smoked chipotle peppers for the heat and used beer like another reviewer did. Fantastic! You can't go wrong with this one.

This chilie is great--one of the best we have made. The cinnamon and chocolate remind us of Cincinnati style chilie--a taste experience you will want to sample when in southwestern Ohio. Try a Cincinnati five way and you will serve this chilie over spaghetti too! We are going to make this with venison next weak.

This chili was delicious. My boyfriend (who isn't a big chili eater--much less a turkey chili eater) loved this. He said it was the best chili he ever had. Don't eat it the first day. Let it sit in the fridge over night as it gets so much better.

I thought this recipe was terrific. I substituted one bottle of Samuel Adams Oatmeal Stout, 1 can of vegetable broth and 1 cup water for the three cups of beef broth. The stout really helps to bring out the cocoa flavor. My family really enjoyed this dish.

Made this from leftover roast turkey (Bon Appetit nov 94 "roast turkey with maple butter and gravy) and it was out of sight, wonderful. I had to double all the ingredients (except the beans)We loved it and froze a bunch in qt freezer bags for the rest of fall. I left the turkey in nice big pieces/slivers and served it with sour cream and hot sauce on the side

Well, OK I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I had to make substitutions because this was a last-minute dinner for my family, but it was good! I substituted red kidney beans and fresh pureéd tomatoes. I would only add about half of the chocolate next time. It is very rich.

I make this recipe every year for the company chili cook-off and it always wins. This is a great chili - the cocoa and cinnamon give it a rich taste, it is not bland like many recipes that call for ground turkey.

I used less white beans and added kidney beans and kernal corn. It was great - I also served hot pepper sauce along with the other condiments as this chili could use a little more fire. It gets even better after a day in the fridge!
