Excellent but too sweet. Would halve the sugar next time. Also used whole onion thanks to others' comments.

A great staple recipe. Used an entire onion and apple. Cooked off peppered bacon before, wiped out the skillet and completed the recipe as is, except used only 1 tablespoon of sugar & didn't have celery seed. Crumbled bacon on top. Really, really good. Probably good cold too...we'll see at the next BBQ.

I used pancetta, substituted 1 tsp. caraway seeds for the celery seeds, used a whole Granny Smith apple and a whole chopped onion, and added 1/4 tsp. allspice. It was wonderful with the honey-marinated pork tenderloin with gremolata (recipe on this site), but next time, I'm halving the sugar.

Have made this twice in one week. Completely scrumptious. For a slightly sweet-tart (and better for you) version, I doubled the onion and the apple, and cut the sugar by 1/3. Works just fine without the bacon and celery seed. Served it with bbq chicken the first time, and grilled pork the second. This is now one of my regulars!

this was pretty good. i made it without the bacon 'cause i don't eat mammals. other than that, i followed the recipe. it's a beautiful color and nice and crisp. next time i would add more vinegar for a sharper taste. definitely good enough to make again, but i think it could be flavored more assertively.

Pretty tasty, but I will definitely increase the amount of onion if I make this again. Also, I would opt for a more sour type of apple--- I used golden delicious, and I think that made it a little too sweet.

I followed other cooks and added a whole apple and onion and omitted the bacon. I also added a bit of balsamic vinegar and substituted caraway seed for the celery seed. A perfect side dish with pork chops!

This was a tasty and pretty complement to bratwurst, German potato salad, and dilled sour cream cucumber salad. I did not use the apples as I wanted less sweetness this time. I used regular bacon, browning it first along with the onions and leaving it in teh pan while the cabbage cooked. I omitted the celery seed.

Can't go wrong with this - very good!

This is a winner! I did not have Canadian bacon, so used fairly lean, low-sodium, hickory smoked bacon, fried crisp and crumbled. The recipe would have been just as good without it, so I am recommending this to vegetarian friends.

Poles love cabbage - I'm not Polish, but as my husband and kids are, so I'm forever searching for good cabbage recipes that we can all enjoy. This fit the bill perfectly. The kids weren't wild about it, but they'll grow into it. This dish will accompany pork roasts and duck and goose from now on....even my mother-in-law said it was delicious.

Made this for Christmas dinner with a roast pork. I left the cabbage sitting in the pan too long, and forgot the bacon and celery seeds, and STILL received complements from everyone. One guest had 3 helping with nothing else. Added the missing ingredients the next day when we had the leftovers, and it was even better. Still tasted fresh and crisp. I am planning to serve this during the summer months as a fresh alternative to cole slaw. GREAT RECIPE.

My husband and I loved this recipe! A perfect side dish for pork! I also used a whole onion and a whole apple. I will definitely make this one again!

Great Red Cabbage....I used 4 slices of bacon instead,cooked down with onions. Also used whole apple and whole onion as well as added additional vinegar to taste.

Great sweet and sour cabbage recipe. I made it to go with the Chicken Paprikas & Poppy-Seed and Green Onion Noodles BA 12/96 - excellent dinner. I used 2 slices of (thick-sliced) bacon as recommended, and stayed with the recipe the rest of the way. Great flavor and easy.

I browned two slices of regular bacon along with the onion and apple. I used a whole onion and a whole apple, instead of just a half. I left out the celery seed. I used green cabbage instead of red. It was delicious.
