Lovely recipe, but on my first go I made some adjustments. I added cumin, parsley (tiny bit) and paprika. It's a great addition for my family iftar meal.

Exceptionally good flavor! Would be good also with baby new potatoes, unpeeled, which would save the peeling step. Yum!

good but needs more . . . something. Made as directed and found it a bit bland, even after being in fridge overnight. Will try again perhaps w/more ginger, and maybe lemon zest? I think it was enough cilantro. Would welcome other cooks' suggestions. Thanks.

I was never fond of potato salad, but I wanted to make one for a BBQ I was hosting recently (since it seems to epitomize summer gatherings and most other people like it). Found this one and made it... fabulous! I even like it!. My boyfriend asked me to make it again the next day (since it had been devoured at the party). Was yummy second time around too.

This is definitely a party-trick potato salad. Nobody's expecting the ginger/shallot/cilantro taste, so it's fun to see them surprised by it. It's also nicely un-mayonnaise-y.

This is tops. Bring it to a picnic or other gathering and people will be surprised after the first bite. This is sooo good during a hot summer cook-out. Try it, you will like it.

This potato salad was the hit of the dinner party, everyone loved it! I added about 1/3 cup of Nancy's yogurt and about 1/2 of a minced, seeded serrano chile to the dressing and though I love cilantro, I cut down the amount to about 3/4 cup total, I didn't want the cilantro to overwhelm. Sprinkled with minced cilantro to garnish. Everyone wanted this recipe.

This was a delicious alternative to typical potato salad. I prepared it with the cumin yogurt cucumbers and and the chicken dish that was part of the original article.

This was perfect for a summer picnic with the Tandoori Chicken recipe, (from the same Entertaining with Style article). I felt it was even better with leftovers because the flavors became more intense. You need to be a cilantro lover for this salad! I am and I loved it.
