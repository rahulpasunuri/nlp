This was my first time making gingerbread and it turned out pretty good! i read most of the comments and modified the recipe accordingly: X4 all spices, substituted ground cloves with allspice, used fresh ginger, 1/2 cup of molasses, coffee with the hot water. i used a magic bullet since i didn't have a mixer and mixed the wet and dry ingredients by hand. Cooked it for 30 minutes. Pretty good for a first try. thanks for all the tips everyone!

Great taste, but I added much more spice than it called for (without really measuring). Also, I baked it for a good 20 minutes longer than it called for. After 30, it was still jiggling when I took it out of the oven. As an excellent low- fat alternative, I substituted apple sauce for the oil and it still tastes great!

Yummy! Yes, it does taste highly of molasses and I found the spices were not strong, however, you could indeed taste the ginger, even though the taste was not that strong. I found it very moist and extremely tasty and would certainly make it again ... again ... and again!

This recipe is nothing like gingerbread cake. It's just a dark molasses cake without any ginger flavor, and the cooking time is totally wrong as well.

This is good. Great with coffee or hot tea for breakfast or an afternoon snack. I would agree that it is not real dense, which can be either good or bad depending on what you prefer. Has a suttle ginger taste. Easy to make.

Doubled the recipe and it made 3 dozen muffins/cupcakes to dust with powdered sugar and serve with whipped cream. Increased spices as suggested, and substited 1/4 of the molasses with applesauce. Cooked cupcakes for 20 minutes. Yummy!

This was great! Really light and moist. I made it with friends for a class party, and we served it with whipped cream and strawberries. Next time I think I'll add crystallized ginger. Excellent all around, and it smells amazing.

Company coming in two hours and no butter (much less oatmeal stout). This recipe was a godsend. I used 1 cup whole wheat flour; 1 1/2 cup white, 1" piece of fresh ginger as I was out of powdered, black treacle as I was out of molasses, and ancho chili powder (1/2t) for amusement, as well as the coffee. Baked it for between 45 and 50 minutes to get it done (checked at 40 and it was close, but not done). People are correct that this is a light rather than dense cake, but it came out light as a feather and melted in the mouth. Praise all round; I am definitely going to make it again.

Good, not great. A bit on the dry side (maybe I baked it too long but I don't think so). The molasses taste was too strong. Still looking for the ultimate gingerbread recipe where the ginger taste is not subdued by the molasses.

This recipe was awesome. I doubled the spices like others suggested plus 2 tsp. cardamom, I also substituted a 1/4 c. of the water with coffee and Galliano liqueur. Top it with a little marscapone cheese frosting and yummm. I highly reccomend this recipe. It is a great addition to my holiday baking.

Excellent. The texture was moist and cakelike; I would have preferred it denser but it was still very good. As others on this site suggested, I used about 4x the amount of spices called for. Good idea, folks! Also, I replaced the cloves with allspice.

I agree that 4 tsp. ginger is required. I suspect that the other cooks who use that much ginger are of British "stock" as I am. The coffee is a great addition. Doesn't anybody else treat ginger"bread" as a tea bread and spread slices with butter?

I jacked up the spices on this one (four tablespoons ginger, two tablespoons cinnamon, one teaspoon cloves, 1/2 teaspoon allspice, and two tablespoons nutmeg) by personal preference. I cut the finished cake into squares, and dipped into a quick powdered sugar fondant (like with petit-fours). Turned out very nice. I made this one along with "Honey Gingerbread" and took both to work. Although I liked this one best, Honey Gingerbread was the overall favorite, six to three.

This is my kind of gingerbread! I loved it and didn't change a thing!

Definitely bake this 15 minutes longer than the recipe calls for as another review suggested. Also, the coffee was a good idea. I, PERSONALLY, prefer gingerbread with more ginger/molasses flavor and with a denser texture so although this was good and "fluffy", it was more like a cake and not my personal favorite.

This recipe easy & delicious. I used 4 tsp of ginger & dark coffee as suggested in some previous reviews. I also added some crystallized ginger pieces into the batter. I used mini loaf pans; baked at 325F for 25 minutes; it turned out wonderful. Makes great Christmas gifts. Thanks to everyone for their suggestions :)

I liked this recipe very much. I used the coffee substitute that was recommended in a previous reveiw, and used cream cheese frosting instead of whipped cream. Although, the gingerbread did not keep as well as I had hoped.

It was partly my fault this didn't out as good as some of the other reviews. I _thought_ I had enough molasses, but I didn't. Cake is very dense, but could be a little sweeter (probably due to shortage of molasses) and next time I would consider increasing the amount of spices. This time, I used 2 tsp. ginger--I would use more next time. Still, it's not bad despite my mistakes, and if the flavor gets stronger with sitting, so much the better.

I LOVE GINGERBREAD AND THIS IS THE BEST I'VE EVER MADE. I'VE BEEN MAKING IT FOR YEARS BUT THIS RECIPE IS THE BEST. THE COFFEE TRICK ADDS TO THE FLAVOR AND THE COLOR IS VERY DARK. GREAT!

I made this recipe last week for my coworkers and they loved it. I read the reviews where someone used coffee in place of the water. Made it tonight and MUCH tastier with the coffee. Will use it again and again.

This was a wonderful EASY recipe... my roommates and I have caught each other sneaking back into the kitchen to nibble some more. The coffee idea was great- I never would have thought of that and it definitely adds a unique flavor that makes this recipe even better.

5 STAR, I used 1 cup of strong coffee instead of water (grandma's advice ) The best I've had. Took a bit longer to cook in my stone pan. It is a must at supper club!!!!

I too must add that in no way is this done in 30 minutes...maybe if you use a 13X9 pan!! I had to cook it for a good 50 minutes for it to test done. And I had to test several times to ensure that it was cooked through. That said, when it finally was done, it was very good and was enjoyed by all who tried it, and I would make it again.

Found this to be best. Very high,moist and delicious. I added half teaspoon more of ginger for additional flavor. Also, suspect time given was for convection oven. I baked it for forty minutes and it worked perfectly.

Definately need to bake it longer than 30 minutes. It took mine about 45. At 35 minutes I poked it in the middle to see if it was done and, much to my chagrin, the middle deflated. In addition, I agree with the person that suggested that it was light on the ginger flavor.

Definitely a keeper...very easy and very tasty...you will probably have to bake it longer that what it says...I had to bake mine about 10-15 minutes longer.

Extremely moist and light. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Really delicious and has a wonderful treacle taste. It's dark and quite moist and tastes even better the "next day" It's not very strong on the ginger taste which may appeal to some although you may wish to add a bit more if you are expecting a definite ginger flavour. I gave a piece to a friend of mine and although she only wanted half of it, she ended up eating the whole piece! Which is a testament to the fact that it is a good recipe. I will definitely make it again. Oh and before I forget, I had to leave it in the oven for about 10 minutes longer as it was not quite done (could be due to the altitude)

This will be my gingerbread recipe from now on. It has a wonderful rich flavor and color.

This is definitely the best gingerbread I've ever made, or eaten. It is very moist and dense. It rises nicely. The flavor is very rich but not too sweet. This will be my gingerbread recipe from now on.
