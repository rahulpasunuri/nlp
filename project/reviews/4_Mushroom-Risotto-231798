This was really good. I used almost all of the liquid, but it was easy to make and a great side dish for chicken marsala. Will make it again.

Take my review with a grain of salt because I didn't follow the recipe to the 't.' I thought it was rather bland, but I didn't use the dried mushrooms which might have imparted a better flavor. I took almost 45 minutes to cook and much more stock than called for (but that could be because I used sushi rice). The flavor was okay, but I don't think worth all the time and effort. But maybe I will try again with the dried 'shrooms.

This risotto recipe is fantastic. I omitted the dried porcini, and the soy sauce, and surprisingly, the flavors were still complex. The constant stirring was important. It helped create a creamy texture. Excellent.

Next time I'll add in the mushrooms- I made it plain the first and second time I made this, however it was still AMAZING. The chicken broth makes the risotto SO flavorful and rich. I had never made risotto before, so I was a little nervous! But, the texture and creaminess of the risotto turned out beautifully.

This is a really yummy recipe that doesn't take very much prep time. Since i was cooking for vegetarians I substituted 1/2 vegetable and 1/2 porchini stock for the chicken stock and it turned out delicious.

This was yummy. I made some substitutions based on what I had on hand. However I didn't feel that they were major substitutions so here goes... I had regular button mushrooms and assorted dried wild mushrooms, I used these instead of cremini/dried porcini (although I think cremini would have tasted better). I added 1/2 cup of Pecorino Romano in addition to the Parmigiano. I also only put 2 tablespoons of the butter at the end and added 2 teaspoons of truffle oil. Yum!!!

I live in the Pacific Northwest and harvest chanterelle mushrooms all through the autumn months. One of my faves is cooking them into a ragu for risotto...used this recipe as a base, skipped the soy sauce, and it was divine.

This took a while to make but it wasn't difficult and was really delicious. I couldn't find porcini or cremini mushrooms, but I used regular white mushrooms and it still was delicious.

Absolutely loved this recipe. I used mushroom broth instead of chicken and grated the parmigiano-reggiano over the top at the end. I didn't try the risotto cakes but this still heats up quite nicely the day after. Its a labor intensive recipe but one I will make again.

So rich and wonderfully decadent. Love this smell of this as it's cooking. I made this a while ago and forgot to review so I can't think if I had any alterations to report, but I do remember thinking that next time I would serve it immediately; it got a tad gummy after sitting there while I cooked the rest of dinner. As always, however, one must be very careful of sediment when using dried porcini, as any little bit of grit will be easily detected in a dish like this.

Mad ethis about 5 times. The key is using good quality dried mushrooms (not necessarily only porcini) and fresh ones too. Use coarsely ground pepper for some bang and be patient while adding the broth!

This is so delicious and impressed my picky in-laws. It's a bit labor intensive, but totally worth it for a special occasion or for company. Or for anyone who as the time!

This was okay, but the dried mushrooms kept their dried out mushroomy flavour. I might use all fresh ones if I were to make it again.

I was a bit skeptical of the soy-sauce, but the end taste convinced me. This is a great recipe, with a really roboust, complete flavor. I used leftovers to make the risotto cakes, and those were very good as well.

Eh. For the effort and the cost (8 bucks for one package of dried shrooms!) this was a little lacking. As obvious as this is, if you are going to cook this, make sure you LOVE the taste of mushrooms. I'm going to try to turn the leftovers into the cakes.

Made this for Valentine's Day. I forgot to add the soy sauce and in addition to the porcini's used a mix of button and oyster mushrooms. It was really rich so I did not add the butter at the end and it is not missed. Nothing scary about this recipe it just takes patience and a love of stirring!

Excellent! I followed the recipe as written and it was great. Make sure to save a couple cups for the stuffed risotto balls.

Since the boyfriend is veggie, I always sub either a veg broth or a mushroom broth, rather than chicken. That said, this risotto seemed a little less flavorful than others I've made..I'm blaming it on the wine I used, thinking I just like those made with red wine better. I also used a bit of fresh rosemary, but apparently not enough. The risotto cakes the next day were super good, though.

This was a very, very easy recipe. I used baby portobella and oyster mushrooms instead. It doesn't seem to make much of a difference what variety you use. I will definately make this one again.

A very fine risotto indeed. I substituted fresh portobellini mushrooms for the cremini. I think it is better to sweat the mushrooms off first, then remove from pan and set aside before frying onions. Add all the mushrooms along with the last ladle of stock. I did not use soy sauce and it was still delicious! Also, homemade chicken stock makes all the difference!

Excellent. I didn't have soy sauce, nor did I have white wine but I used a dry red and also a mixture of mushrooms including oysters and porcinis. The variety made this dish pretty and distinctive. I don't think it needed the last bit of butter as it was already really rich without it.

I'm no stranger to risotto and found the directions easy to follow, but this was way too complicated for a very blah result. There must be other mushroom risotto recipes out there with a lot more flavor. Won't bother again.

Delicious! Didn't time it overall, but seemed to be around 35 mins cooking time. I halved the recipe and it served 3 as a side (with very little left over). Great flavour - will definitely make again.

I followed the recipe to the letter, however, it took more than an hour for the rice to cook (ruining my dinner timing) and it ended up very pastey, gooey and mushy. I must say the flavor was excellent. Maybe it was the brand of Aborio rice that I bought (Trader Joes). I wouldn't make this again.

I made this for a dinner party recently, it was very impressive, everyone raved. I planned for the it to be done when my guests arrived (it stays hot in the pit for quite a while, got a little starchy, but i just added a liitle more broth) To make a complete meal, I started with tomato bruschetta, followed by a simple casear salad, and the risotto for the entree. Top it off with a dessert of your choice...all was done a head of time and meant for a great time for the host as well as the guests.

I had never made a risotto before so I was a little nervous about the outcome but I was thoroughly impressed with this dish. Tasted great!

i was a bit nervous when i started soaking the porcinis due to the earthy smell, but it added so much yummy flavor! i have tried other mushroom risottos before, and this is by far my favorite. i pretty much followed the recipe by the book, and would like to maybe add some more veggies for a more complete meal next time.

I've made risotto before and have no issues with the technique... I rather enjoy it. But this recipe was, at best mediocre. It really didnt taste very complex considering the amount of ingredients. I added some thyme to the leftovers and that really helped. I will opt for a different mushroom risotto next time out or at least modify this one.

Terrific...as with all risottos it takes a little time and attention but it was worth it

This was my first attempt at risotto and it turned out great. I used all fresh mushrooms as I am not always able to get good dried mishrooms, but it still turned out great.

I do NOT like mushrooms at all but made this recipe for my husband who does. I was so suprised at how delicious it was, I had to make the Risotto cakes too the next day! Very good earthy taste.

I loved the flavor and the texture of this risotto recipe. I served this alongside the Barbecued Tri-Tip with Carmelized Red Onions found on the Epicurious website. Great food pairing!

Delicious! A flexible recipe for whatever mushrooms you have available, but the dried porcini mushrooms make a difference, don't skip those.

This risotto dish is an absolute delight! Instead of 8 min for the mushroom and onions to absorb liquid - for me it took 6 mins. The recipe directions were easy to follow and the results were superb (visually & taste)! My husband and 4 year old son loved it. I will certainly make it again (Actually for Easter!) Enjoy everyone I hope you have the same experience.
