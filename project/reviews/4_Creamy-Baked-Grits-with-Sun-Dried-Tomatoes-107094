So I had a a tiny bit of quick grits hanging around, half a carton of chicken broth, 1/4 bag of sun-dried tomatoes, a bit of light cream, a knob of gorgonzola,a little fresh thyme and came across this recipe. Holy cow, didn't expect it to be quite so amazing. My not-Southern husband (bless his heart) who sneers at grits said this was worthy of company. Very rich...and I think just as wonderful without the tomatoes. We love goat cheese and I'm sure that's wonderful, but the gorgonzola took it to an expected level of flavor.

Hi Ya'll! I served this grits casserole for Easter Brunch. (whipping cream for parties only) Adults as well as teens ate it up. A nice alternative to the traditional cheese grits recipe. I doubled except for the goat cheese. Yes, I will certainly make again. Happy Easter to all Epicurions.

This is for serious goat cheese and sun-dried tomato lovers. Delicious and rich. My little sister just made this for a family get-together and it was a hit.

I don't know what the fuss is all about. We like grits - these were okay but nothing special.

Made this for a Southern-themed book club dinner (we were reading "To Kill a Mockingbird"), and even those who were dubious about grits were completely charmed. A savory recipe that I've since served many times. Its rich, comfort-food flavor is a wonderful complement both for roasts and for lighter fare. Just don't tell your guests the likely fat content....

This is my go-to grits recipe- one of the best side dishes I've ever had! It is also very easy to make and always gets raves from guests.

This recipe was very easy to make. Had the left-overs with eggs for breakfast the next day -- Wow!

This was a great recipe. Of course, I modified it and used the cheese I had on hand (hee hee). It was creamy, rich and smooth. Being part of the GRITS (Girls raised in the south) club...this was heaven to me.

I doubled this recipe for a dinner party, and served it with a great lemon shrimp recipe from Ali Baba Restaurant in Birmingham on the side. I used vegetable broth so that vegetarians could eat it, and added goat cheese into the mixture instead of just on top. The texture was terrific, and the flavor was lovely and subtle, if a bit bland. Next time I may mix in a bit of gorgonzola to intensify the cheese flavor.

I made the mistake of assuming that if some sundried tomatoes were good, the whole jar would be better. The tomatoes overwhelmed the dish to some degree. Even so, the combination of flavors was wonderful--I'll just keep the tomatoes within bounds next time.

My father prepared "grits and tomatoes" when I was a child, but since with our large family we were usually strapped for funds we used "jazzed up" canned tomatoes and a side of grilled spam. ha! This makes that humble meal rise to a new status. Perhaps with a side of nice sausage or ham. Thanks for the reminder that these simple ingredients can be a comfort food!

Good, but I'm not jumping out of my heels like most of the other people. If you decide to make this, you will most definitely need to cut back on the cheese and/or the cream. It is extremely rich if you put in the full amount of both. It seemed to have overpowered the dish it was supposed to have been a side for. The tomatoes were a nice touch though.

Very, very tasty, loved the goat cheese, dried tomatoes, and grits together. I used half & half and quite a bit less of it, and only used about half of a 4 oz. log of chevre. Next time, I'd double grits--1/2 cup makes a very thin layer in 8X8 pan.

Out of this world! Followed recipe exactly as directed and thought it was amazing. Served sliced pork loin with rosemary and garlic on top and we were cleaning our plates. This is a winner and also a great option for brunch with grilled sausages!!
