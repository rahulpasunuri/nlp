This recipe was a real disappointment as the sauce separated immediately. The goat cheese and the cream/milk should really be mixed separately in a bowl and combined with some reserved pasta water. Additionally, the recipe is lacking in acid, so the flavor is very flat. I added some lemon zest and that made a huge difference. I would not recommend adding lemon juice as that could cause the sauce to curdle and/or separate. I'll make this again but with my modifications.

If I could, I would probably give it a 3 1/2 rating. We enjoyed it, but, must say I made a slight change in the cooking process. As I think that leeks can be a bit bitter if cooked too long, I covered the saute pan so they steamed a bit and then took the cover off to get rid of the accumulated liquid. Therefore they did not brown as suggested in the recipe. Did the same with the Zucchini, athough that probably was not necessary. Added a little more salmon as suggested by another review and cut down a bit on the olive oil and the quantity of the fettuccine which was also suggested. It went over very well.

The only substitution I made was summer squash for zucchini, as I had squash in the house. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. The leeks were overdone. The sauce immediately seperated and I couldn't fix it with an immersion blended without destroying the vegetables. Just about doubled the salmon and halved the pasta to come up with proportions we like. Maybe some of the problem was with the goat cheese, which varies greatly from brand to brand, and is always extremely over priced. This is not even worth fiddling with.

In a word "delicious." In effort to cut the fat, I used 3.5 oz. goat cheese, fat free half 'n' half, and one third the olive oil. Suggestions to add pepper flakes (1 teas.) and added pasta water resulted in a delightful entre. Served it with sliced just-picked tomatoes and a slice of honeydew...Yes, "delicious."

Substituted smoked ham for the salmon and was delicious

I was a bit nervous about the mixed reviews for this one, but it turned out pretty good. We rarely eat pasta dishes because my husband is diabetic - starches screw his sugar up. But I couldn't resist the description. Only made half a pound of linguini with the full amount of sauce, and it was great. I'm not sure why people thought it was bland, but I added plenty of salt and pepper and didn't think it needed the lemon juice or nutmeg or anything. And I used 6 oz of smoked salmon because they were out of the 4 oz size.

Could be tasty, but too bland as is. Added nutmeg and lots of pepper, but sauce didn't have much bite (lemon juice and/or cayenne might have helped if I'd had them!). As it was, a perfectly decent meal, but it will need plenty of tinkering before I serve it again.

I was SO excited about this recipe - sounded like a no brainer for an excellent meal. I was so disappointed. It was flavorless, I added a lot of dill, lemon juice and red pepper flakes to give it some oomph. Still it was just so-so. big disappointment...

Delicious! I have to admit that I changed the cheese and used a white soft one and I added some dill, as I thought it was complementary to the leeks. The result was great! Everubody loved it!

Made it for Mother's Day but with a strawberry salad (also from this site) instead of the orange one. Perfect match. I cooked some of the squash on the grill for depth of flavor. Yum. The only problem was that I let it simmer too long while I was running around, making scones & keeping Mom happy. It became pretty grainy - I don't know if it was the squash, the cheese, or what. I was horrified but of course didn't mention it and no one other than me seemed to mind - they cleaned their plates. I tasted it earlier in the cooking and the texture was lovely. Delicious!

Yummy and idiot proof and tastes like you labored all day. I agree with all the earlier comments. I did add a spash of sherry to bring out the carmelized leek flavor and used white pepper as opposed to black. Needs more milk/cream and cheese to increase the amount of sauce. Serve with a light salad as this is not low calorie.

We all enjoyed this dish, and it was not difficult to make on a weeknight. I would definitely reduce the amount of pasta or double the amount of sauce, but otherwise the flavors complemented each other well. I also used cooked smoked salmon (not lox) from Trader Joe's, and used all of the 8-oz. package. Mmm. good.

One word: Amazing. It sounds nearly overwhelmingly gourmet in its scope of flavors, but it's a fun, easy dish that would certainly impress nearly anyone. I'm biased because I love leeks in just about anything, but this is fantastic. Smoked salmon complements the other flavors so well; I was surprised. I thought the sauce wasn't liquid enough, and even adding more half/half or even milk once that ran out didn't seem to help. It made it tougher to coat the noodles but it was still fantastic. Definitely making this again.

Yummy, and yes, it needs all those leeks. It cooks down. I might add more goat chees next time. I used 6 oz of Trader Joe's Smoked salmon, and it was very moist and nice.

I used this recipe to begin my brunch and everyone just gobbled it up. They all asked for the recipe. I was delighted and would definitely use it again. It's a good way to do lox without doing the usual bagels routine.

This recipe was wonderful and will definately make it into the regular rotation. The only small change I made was that I did stir the salmon through the pasta when adding the sauce rather than just sprinkle it on the top. A real winner.

A quick entree that is also elegant and easy to make. I added some dill which I thought gave it a little extra flavor. I'll definitely make it again.

An excellent dish that is versatile as well. I made it once following the recipe exactly and it was excellent! I then made it again with Hawaiian Sweet Onions and baby zucchini, 1/2 the oil, the 1/2 & 1/2, and the pasta. And it was even better. Everyone raved!

This is a great recipe, delicious, very quick and very easy to make. It's also very flexible - it works equally well without the salmon, with different kinds of goat cheese, and even with half of the cream replaced with boiling water from the pasta. Everyone I have made this for has loved it and licked their plates and asked for it again. Four forks!

The flavors of the sauce are incredible! I used fat-free half-and-half to lighten up a bit and added a bit of spinach with great success. I also added peppered smoked salmon into the sauce to allow the flavors in the sauce to really blend. Excellent considering how fast and easy this is to prepare.

I wasn't able to follow the proportions as given as I was improvising so I'm not (fork) rating this. I liked the combination of flavours and also added the smoked salmon into the sauce before combining with the pasta. However, I found the sauce a bit too rich and thought it would have been better with some lemon juice to "cut" it a bit. I'd make this again - in fact will be having the leftovers tonight!

I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a recipe this much - I very rarely give 4 forks! It is EASY (prep and serve in under 10 minutes - the perfect mid-week meal) and it tastes phenomenal! It reminded me a bit of carbonara (but without the bacon). The smokiness of the salmon and the flavors of the leek and feta complement each other very well. I used whole wheat fettuccine, which added great substance to the dish.

I thought this pasta dish was fabulous! I made it for one of my foodie friends and she loved it too. I too, put the salmon directly into the sauce. I use a penne instead of fettuccine. YUM! Make this dish!!!!

I thought this dish had great possibilities but when I made it, it seemed to lack flavour and the texture did not seem right. I made it for my son and myself because we were the only ones home for dinner and neither of us enjoyed it. There was some left over and my husband had it the next day though we warned him that it wasn't that great. He liked it. Maybe the flavours had time to blend after sitting in the fridge overnight.

This recipe was delicious. I mixed the smoked salmon directly into the sauce and used pasta shells rather than fettuccine. The goat cheese gave the sauce a lovely consistency and contrasted well with the saltiness of the smoked salmon. I will be making this dish for both family and company.
