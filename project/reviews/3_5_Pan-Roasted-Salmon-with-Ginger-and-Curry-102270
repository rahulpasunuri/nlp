The combination of ginger, curry and scallions yielded a delightful surprise. Other cooks' suggestion of adding soy sauce with the scallions was good. After first following this recipe, one can play with adaptations, too.

I agree with those who say "simple and very good". Used shallots since did not have scallions. Added 1.5 tsp soy sauce with shallots then about 4 mins. covered, med-low heat. Steamed baby carrots & risotto go very well with the salmon. WILL make this again!

This is a simple but tasty way to cook salmon. I have made it many times and recommend it to all.

This is one super supper! Everyone loves it served with creamed spinach. I for one do not like curried fish but, this is different. I serve it to guest that have a sense of gastronomic adventure and I get rave reviews. My husband wants it again and I just made it last week.

Pretty good and more than I usually do for a weeknight dinner! We took others' suggestions and added soy sauce, plus a bit of seasoned rice vinegar, to the green onions. Next time I might try some ground chile to the rub... just seemed like it needed something more.

I've been making this recipe that I discovered on this website for 8 years, and it is always a real treat. Yes, it can be tweaked in various ways (hot pepper flakes, a ginger sauce on the side, soy sauce with the scallions) and it is always wonderful and an easy qucik preparation that gives the top a nice "crust". We love it and have made if for quick weeknight meals in addition to special dinners.

Okay, so the reviews are definitely mixed, which is disconcerting, but I found this recipe delicious. A few small tweaks and it was great: I added a healthy dash of soy sauce with the scallion cooking, as I think someone recommended. I also used the entire bunch of scallions, not just three. I'm sure the cabbage is great, but I started this at about 8:30 pm, when time was limited- so I made it with jasmine rice and steamed broccoli with toasted sesame oil and dried red pepper flakes. Delicious and quick, just like we like it.

Like many others said, this was a simple recipe, but not overly flavorful. I might add a little soy sauce next time.

This was one of the better "indoor" salmon recipes I've tried. (Grilling salmon on a charcoal grill is still the best.) I was surprised at how tasty this was. I'll definitely make it again.

My husband and I really liked this. I made it with the pickled cabbage and cucumber salad as recommended. I think the two were very complementary. I think the reason some may have thought this was a bit dull is that the addition of the salad really gives this dish a kick. If you're going to do the salmon, I really recommend the salad.

Simple and GREAT!!

It is indeed easy to prepare and good for a weekday meal. A green salad will match nicely. It is not really special, though.

This was definatly easy, but I'm not sure if I liked it or not. I love curry but there was something weird about it...My husband was not impressed. Most people seem to like it, so maybe its just us!

Good for a weekday meal. Quick, flavorful, spicy, and low-fat. This is not your ultimate salmon recipe, but it's good for an easy family meal.

This was QUICK and yummy...even my 15yr old son liked it. Dinner was on the table in the time it took to steam the new potatoes we had as a side dish.

I am sorry I totally disagree! I think this was a waste of my nice piece of Salmon. I only had a few bites and ended up throwing it away. Take my advice just b/c a dish is simple does not mean it is worth making!

One of my new favorite dishes. So easy and so good. I used the Spice Hunter curry powder which makes a difference. I also doubled the amount of the paste. Friends raved about it!

What a wonderful tasty dish!! I'll definitely make this again. I served it with a slice of lime.

i don't like salmon. I loved this.. we used a south african curry powder. Maybe that makes a difference. It really is a wonderful dish

We loved this dish! Quick, simple. The key is the quality of the curry powder. We make our own from a recipe of the late (and great) Pierre Franey. You also must use fresh ginger.

This recipe had a great flavor. A nice change from other salmon recipes that I have cooked. It is very quick and easy to make. I would make it again.

Although this recipe is very quick and easy, I was rather disappointed. Perhaps a different type of curry would have made it more interesting - I used McCormick's Madras (hot) Curry Powder. With so many other recipes to try, I see no reason to make this one again.

This dish is awsome. The spice combination is wonderful and served with the cabage salad makes a beatuiful presentation. I substituted a combination of white and balsamic vinegars for the rice wine (didn't have any on hand. This will become one of our signature dishes.
