I would not make this recipe again. The first thing that I didn't like is that amounts of fruit were off - use 5 peaches and 3 plums. Otherwise you have too much fruit to fit in the pan, even heaped. The mix with the cinnamon was so so. The almond crust was cookie like in consistency and not terribly almond-y or tasty. I have a Patricia wells almond crust recipe that is wildly better. This was nothing special and was not worth the effort.

So, based on the description of this recipt, am I to believe that if I eat a ton of this pie, my skin will clear up? Sounds a bit counter-intuitive. In any case, I could since it's awesome though I'm not a big almond fan. Made it this way but might substitute another type of crust.
