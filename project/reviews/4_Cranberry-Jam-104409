Delicious! And easy! I doubled the recipe to use up two bags of fresh cranberries left over from the holidays. Since the jam is just for us, I mashed it a bit but didn't bother to strain it (especially as I don't have a food mill). We like the chunkier texture and it tastes just lovely.

This jam is amazing! I am not even that big a fan of cranberries, and I can't stop eating it. Will be making this for Christmas presents for sure.

I made this last night for xmas presents and it is fabulous. I filled sterilized jars and processed in hot water bath for 10 mins. The vanilla bean makes the jam. Lovely ruby color and set beautifully. It will make a really nice gift.

I make lots of jam every summer with fresh fruit and can it for gifts. If I run out, I will sometimes make it with frozen fruit. This recipe would work just fine for canning. Put hot jam in sterilized jars and process for 15 minutes. (You might check with the directions that come with your canning jars. I use Weck jars from Germany. I like the shapes!) I think I will try it for Christmas gifts!

I have not yet made this but I have a question. Would it be OK to process and seal this in jars like other jams for gift-giving and long-term storage? I'm guessing it would be all right. Are there any experienced jam-makers out there that could answer this? Thanks.

I didn't use a food mill, but rather just forced the jam through a fine mesh strainer; it was more like a compote, or spread, than a jam. I made jars of this jam for friends, last Christmas. The vanilla bean is what makes it wonderful. They loved it! I will definitely make it again as a gift, with some extra for myself.

"unthawed" frozen cranberries means exactly what it says. If you are using frozen cranberries, keep them frozen until adding them to the pot.

This dish was delicious. However, using a vanilla bean makes it very pricey. Perhaps a way to substitute vanilla extract would make it out of this world.

The jam is very tasty. One comment about the wording of the recipe. 'Unthawed' actually means frozen. I believe you meant to write 'thawed'

It sounds like it would really be good to a cranberry lover like me. I'm just curious, the recipe calls for Cranberies, fresh or "unthawed". If they are unthawed doesn't that mean they are still frozen or refrozen???
