My family and friends just loves it whenever I make this as the main entree. Slice the rack so that the loin has two ribs. Place the ribs in a ziplock bag then pour the marinade in. Turn the bag over every 4 hours or so. The next day it's ready for the grill; don't overcook the lamb. This is a very delicious recipe.

I was excited to try this, as I like asian flavors, and my family loves lamb. I made the recipe according to the instructions, except I omitted the fermented black beans because I wasn't sure what that meant, exactly. I found the dish to be bland and barely so-so. It is not something I will make again.

The sauce is worth the price of admission here. I thought it overpowered an expensive piece of meat like the lamb a bit, but I would definetly remake the sauce for pork ribs, chicken or pork tenderloin.

This was just amazing...can't think of any meat or fish the marinade wouldn't work on. I reserved some of the marinade to spoon over after the lamb was cooked. Best barbecue style sauce ever!!!

I loved, loved, loved this recipe. I took the remander of the marinade and put it in the oven to reduced it. However some of it burned. Next time I think I will put it in a pan and reduce it. It made for a really yummy, but spicy sauce to put on the Jasmine rice I made with the lamb. I also made an asian corn recipe that I found on this site, that went perfectly with the flavor of the lamb. I plan to use this marinade also on other things that I cook on the grill.

It took a while to track down the fermented black beans (even asking for them in an Asian supermarket took a bit of effort to find them)- but it was worth the effort. I used it on lamb chops(cooked only on grill) first and then on chicken legs. I almost forgot to add the orange rind, but it is a critical ingredient. Chicken legs must be grilled on very low heat as the marinade is susceptible to charring due to the sugar content. Now to look for more recipes to use the fermented black beans in!!

Excellent. Used it with pork baby back ribs.

Made this with some beef spare ribs. Awesome, but better suited for white meats (pork, maybe lamb). Great marinade, though.

I made it with lamb chops. It was very good, and not difficult.

I have now tried this with lamb and pork chops, but the best yet is on a rack of pork spareribs. I precooked the ribs for a couple hours at 250, and slathered this marinade on them in the last 30 minutes. We then grilled them, slathering and turning them until they were crispy and completely glazed. They were phenomenal.

thanks to other reviewers I made this. I used it on pork chops, marinated about 8 hours and grilled. It was magnificent. I substituted fermented black bean paste which I could find, for the beans, which I couldn't. The sesame seeds made a pretty presentation but arent necessary.

Very good. It's spicey and made that rack of lamb a memorable meal. I've used it on a broiled filet mignon and it was also great. I couldn't find 'black bean paste' so I used something called 'garlic black bean sauce'.

Awesome recipe on anything! I've been using this recipe for years and can't beleive I found it here. I should have known! Anyway, I marinate pork ribs for a couple of days,(made it the first time with red curry, ick, now leave it out)then out to the bbq. The black beans are the key. Try asian section(salted beans)tiny moist dried beans in 4oz plastic bag from hong kong.Hope this helps.

Sorry this is a I don't know what I did wrong comment after all the great reviews. I thought I followed the recipe except for the fermented black beans which I couldn't find. It was OK, but not that great. The meat was not that tender either. I used expensive frenched rack of lamb that I've used in other recipes. We could taste the marinade, but it did nothing for the lamb. Maybe it was expectation or the particular rack of lamb, but I won't bother again. I'm still looking for a rack of lamb as good as I had in SF years ago, I can't even remember the resturant. It was fit for royalty.

One of the best marinades of beef I have ever had, I used a whole fillet and marinate it overnight and then BBQ'd over hot charcoals, came out just fabulous. I made it already 3 or 4 times. A definite must.

You have come across this recipe....MAKE IT!! The sauce is WICKED! Thank heaven for the reviews in this web site...I may not have made this otherwise. There is something satisfying in going to your fridge for ingredients and having everything you need (except for the fermented black beans!! which I left out). I would use this sauce on anything (lamb, beef, chicken, pork, shrimp...)

EXCELLENT!!!!This was one of the most delicious meals I ever ate. Everyone loved it. Even though I live in a very big city, I wasn't able to find the fermented black beans so we had to do without. I'll keep looking for them! We're going to try it on a pork roast for Christmas.

This marinade is stupendous. Used boneless sirloin chops (MUCH less expensive than the rack) and barbecued them. Unbelievable!

At first taste the marinade seemed rather spicy. But once the rack was grilled to perfection, the flavor was just phenomenal. A definite keep!

This one is a keeper. The only advise I would impart- marinade overnight.
