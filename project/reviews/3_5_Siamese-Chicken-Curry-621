Wow - what a great recipe for using the other half of a roasted bird, presuming one has the other ingredients on hand. Like others, I used coconut milk and chicken broth to make the sauce - otherwise made it to the letter, and it was GREAT. Oh, wait, I couldn't bring myself to use basil in this curry when I had fresh cilantro on hand -- made all the difference. As for the "condiments", I chose to stir in golden raisins and peanuts towards the end of the cooking process and I can't imagine this dish without them. Enjoy!

This is good and fast. I substituted a can of coconut milk for the whipping cream and extract. I added some pineapple chunks. Not necessary but they make it a little more sublime. I also served it over noodles with extra chicken broth in it, which made it more soupy. Delicious.

Followed the recipie as stated, except for using lite coconut milk instead of the whipping cream. Although the "heat" was just right for me, I found the dish somewhat bland- the curry dishes I've had before have had depth to them, and I was hoping this would have it as well. Probably won't make this again. My next adventure with curry will be the Green Curry Chicken also at this site.

My husband loved it...and even my three year old "picky eater" enjoyed it! I used the following condiments: candied ginger, coconut, chopped macadamia nuts, chopped pecans, chopped scallions, and chopped red bell peppers. It was flavor rich, but not too hot...and we'll definitely have it again, soon.

Easy and quick to make. Substituted 3/4 can of lite coconut milk and 3/4 can chicken soup. Added some peas and nuts and rice. Voila!

Great dish! I use one can of lite coconut milk and 1/3 can chicken broth lieu of whipping cream and coconut extract. I buy a cooked, rotisserie chicken and add that to the dish. I also add peas during the last cooking phase. Serve with rice, toasted coconut flakes, raisins, and dry roasted peanuts. For more kick, I add red curry (the Thai brand that comes in a small bottle). This stuff is powerful! My fiance's favorite.

I made the recipe as it's written and thought the dish was bland - needed something. I doubt I'll make again. Give it a try - but follow the other user's suggestions as to additions. This needs something to give it a boost.

My boyfriend and I make this recipe more than anything else. It'a a hit with everyone. We prefer to use green curry paste instead of the red curry. Beware though, green curry is much more spicey. Try using .25 of a 4oz can to start with.

I just got done eating this. It was great. I used some left-over turkey from Thanksgiving that I found in the back of my freezer and it still turned out good.I topped it with golden raisins. The hint of sweetness thought the spice is a great addition. I also added red bell pepper and green onion but the raisins are a must.I think that I will try coconut milk the next time as M Kerman suggests.

Yummy. Easy. We substituted coconut milk for the whipping cream and coconut extract, and it was great. (I periodically added water to the pan, especially with the curry/vinegar, because it was getting too dry). I added some peas with the chicken, and topped with golden raisins. Delish!

An excellent dish that got rave reviews from all my guests. I substituted 10 oz. of coconut milk (instead of the coconut called for) for some of the chicken broth. Also used some cajun spice instead or the red pepper chilies. I'll definitely make this again.

It's easy and good, but it needs something sweet like pineapple chunks to counteract the saltiness.

I substituted 1/2 the vinegar with tarragon vinegar, added some extra curry and extra cream to make more sauce. My husband and kids really liked it, and it was quick and easy to make on a work night. Makes a nice thick sauce with shredded chicken. Fun to add all the different goodies on top. Easy shredded chicken: just put a fryer in the crockpot on low 8 hrs, season with S&P, don't add any water. Makes a PERFECT, moist chicken --great to use in recipes.
