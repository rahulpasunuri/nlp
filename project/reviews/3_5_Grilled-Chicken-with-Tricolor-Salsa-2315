DH and I have differing opinions on this dish. DH didn't like it, but I thought it was okay. Didn't really have flavors that 'popped' to me, though.

We enjoyed this, but we were disappointed based on the 4-fork reviews of the previous cooks. I had expected extraordinary, and got instead a nice side dish for some grilled chicken. But -- I would probably make it again.

The salsa is YUM-MY. I added a can of black beans to make it stretch. It was great. I am making the salsa for the 3rd time tonight.

The salsa is scrumptious! Added some garlic to the marinade and used lime juice for marinade and salsa. Agree the salsa makes this 4 forks!

This dish was fantastic - I made it for a get-together this past Saturday night and it was a smash! Everyone loved the salsa, which was very refreshing paired with the chicken. The only change I made was to omit the avacado, which my husband does not like. Otherwise, I doubled the recipe and followed it exclusively and it was just great. Will most definitely add it to our rotation!

Really a great recipe! The salsa makes it. Very flavorful... I did switch lime in for the lemon, as others suggested. I believe it's just a better combo with the other flavors. My husband loved it. I will definitely make again!

Forget the chicken. The salsa is the star of this recipe. I lightly pan roasted the corn to avoid lessen its raw flavor and crunchiness. Dried herbs also work well in this recipe - just use them in moderation. I, too, used lime juice rather than lemon. The salsa stays fresh in the fridge for up to three days, and the juice (along with the avocadao nut) helps prevent oxidation and keeps the colors vibrant. This is the perfect summer salsa.

The salsa really makes this recipe, the flavors are wonderful (although it wasn't very spicy). Used lime juice instead of lemon. Chicken marinade is a little boring, needs some minced garlic and lots of S+P. Maybe lime juice instead of lemon there, too. Definitely try the salsa, it's addictive!

I also used lime in the recipe and no cilantro. I've served this at parties and everyone loved it. I added black beans to it and left out the avacado and that was good also. So many variations to this recipe you can use whatever you have handy

This was fantastic! My husband and my 3 year old loved it! I make the salsa on its own and serve it with chips. DELICIOUS!!!

Will make this one again! Excellent recipe -- excellent salsa. Like others, I used boneless skinless chicken and added mostly lime, also added double the jalapeno for a spicier flavor.

I made this dish for a summer dinner party, it was wildly successful. Many of the guests commented that it was better then any restaurant! I did make changes recommended by other reviewers - substitute lime for lemon and mango for the avacado. I also cut back a little on the corn. I served this with the "Orzo with everything" and would proudly serve it again!

The salsa "made" this recipe. It was delicious - so fresh and cool - perfect for a hot summer day. The chicken was okay, but I think I'll substitute lime for the lemon next time to give it a more subtle flavor. The lemon was a little too intense.

Fabulous! Made with boneless skinless breasts and they were tender & juicy. Grilled on BBQ medium heat and lid down. Substituted mango chunks for the avocado and it was delicious. The other reviewer is right about the margaritas - have one or two...

What a great dish!! My husband has already put in a request for me to make it again! The salsa was so fresh and made the dish! After grilling the chicken , I sliced it and rolled it in the tortillas with the salsa. I also squeezed fresh lime juice over the sliced chicken before serving. Fabulous!!

Just in case you find yourself with no lemons, and a bag of limes (like me), the substitution works well. And, just in case you find you've extracted more lime juice that what the recipe calls for, margaritas are a delightful compliment to this dish! A little tequila added to the marinade is beneficial too.

I made this recipe with boneless, skinless breasts and it came out great! Must tenderize though... Cumin is my new favorite spice...

Delicious! I added a little salt to the marinade, which helped the flavours to penetrate deeper into the chicken, and keep it juicy (I used boneless skinless breasts). A definite keeper.

Made this last night for a Stanley Cup Playoff party. It was a hit! Easy and delicious especially on a nice warm evening. Oh ya...and our Ottawa Senators eliminated the Philadelphia Flyers. Woo Hoo Go SENS GO!!!!!!

We really enjoyed the salsa and it made for a wonderful cool recipe for August in Texas! I used boneless skinless chicken breasts because that is what I had on hand. The marinade is not very "tenderizing" so the chicken was a little tough. I definitely recommend using bone-in, chicken with skin as the recipe calls for. I would also recommend rubbing the marinade underneath the skin if you want it to be real flavorful.

Another great Chicken/Salsa recipe! Highly recommend!

The salsa is terrific--very refreshing with wonderful taste and texture. I didn't use as much cilantro as called for and the flavor still came through well. The chicken, although marinated for two days, didn't have much flavor--just a hint of lemon. I would keep the salsa, but go for a more flavorful chicken recipe.

This was really good. I made it using cut up and skinned chicken pieces (breasts, thighs and drumsticks) and marinated them for about 5 hours. The lemon flavor was delicate, it was actually more of a "hint" of lemon. The salsa was fabulous -- I added diced yellow bell pepper for color. I made it a few hours ahead of time (added the avocado later), covered it in the refrigerator so the flavors could blend. It was the hit of the dinner. Served the chicken with warmed tortilla and the Yellow Rice Salad with Roasted Peppers and Spicy Black Beans from this site. Excellent dinner.

I previously made this recipe but only used the marinade with chicken and some leftover orange/tomato salsa that I had made before. The chicken was very tasty and the lemon taste really came through. Tonight I made "this" recipe's corn salsa and it was excellent! I used boneless skinless chicken breasts which I marinated for 3 hours. I cut the chicken up and served with grilled orange and red peppers and sour cream in tortillas fajita style. My husband loved them and so did I! Definite keeper, the salsa makes it!

My husband & I have made this recipe several times this summer and each time we've been asked for the recipe! It is wonderful! You can be creative with the ingredients too. We add red and green peppers.

Made this recipe because it had great reviews. I now know why! Excellent salsa, chicken was fine but not spectacular. Doubled the salsa recipe and it disappeared with many compliments. Will definitely make again

Great salsa!!! Used black beans instead of the corn in the salsa and served with corn on the cob. Chicken was nothing spectacular but it did the job. Easy to prepare and looks pretty.

I made this dish for a special occassion. It was a hit. Especially the tri-color salsa. I will certainly be making it again. I added a little more heat to it, cayenne.

The salsa is great! Although next time I'll probably only use 1 T. of olive oil to cut out some fat. The chicken is okay probably won't make it again, the salsa is a keeper!

To the cook in calgary re:homemade tortillas. Combine equal quantities of masa harina (lime-treated cornflour, do NOT substitute regular cornmeal!) and water. Mixture should quickly thicken and pull away from the sides of the bowl. Form into a large ball and then divide into equal portions (1/4-1/2 cup size)and roll into small balls with your hands. flatten with something heavy (the bottom of a glass bowl works well) so that they form rounds that are about six inches in diameter. Take a cast iron or calphalon griddle and apply a Very light coating of oil. Heat until hot but not smoking and begin to cook tortillas, carefully check underneath to ensure that they are lightly browned. Keep warm in a 250 C oven by wrapping in a basket lined with a damp (not wet!) towel. I learned this recipe from a Salvadoran friend, it is completely authentic, enjoy!

A wonderful and very easy recipe!! I loved all the flavors. My kids loved it too! I used lime juice instead of lemon in the marinade, seemed a bit more mexican. I also only used two Tbsp olive oil in the marinade and just one Tbsp in the salsa, it turned out fine. A bit summery tasting (it was snowing while I was bar-b-quing!). Can't wait to make this in the summer. Would be great with a Corona! Where do I fine a home made tortilla recipe to accompany this?

I've been making this dish since '93, everyone requests it at our summer barbecues! I usually just make the salsa and serve with tortilla chips. But, this summer we did the chicken and salsa as a sandwich on Onion rolls. Yum!

This is an excellent dish. Lots of hot homemade tortillas a must. The marinade makes it, I'm sure it would be great on fish as well. Can't say enough about the salsa either...WOW!!

This recipe is terrific! The flavors are great--it's perfect for a barbeque where not everyone likes really hot food like I usually make. Some people just ate the salsa straight out of the bowl!
