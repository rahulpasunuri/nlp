The recipe works because it's so simple. It should be emphasized that it's very important to roll the dough very thinly. This way the bread is more puffy and light. With whole wheat flour I needed slightly more water. I felt that a tsp of oil in the dough made it more pliable and a softer chapati in the end.

Very good with spicy dishes and easy to make. We have enjoyed this type of bread in Indian restaurants for years. We will fix this at home often. I reccomend brushing with a very small amount of melted butter.

Too little water . For 3 cups of flour water should be 1& half cup. For dusting flour you only need one quarter of a cup of flour. Kneading time is only 1 to 2 min.

Alot of work for a bread that is so simple to make. Usually I just add whole wheat flour to water and salt. Knead it for 2 or 3 mins (NOT 15 mins) then roll them out and cook on an ungreased skillet. I showed an Indian friend this recipe and she laughed.
