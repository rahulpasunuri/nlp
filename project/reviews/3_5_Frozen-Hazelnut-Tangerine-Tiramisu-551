I am not impressed with this recipe -- I did not find it was worth the time, effort or expense to make. As desserts go, it was light but tasted too much of alcohol. I also found that the filling was too liquid-y. My guests thought this was "ok" but they were not wild about it either. Nobody went for seconds. I made it for Christmas and usually serve a trifle or tiramisu type dessert - my guests were disappointed that this was not on par with the "old stand-by" desserts I have previously served.

I only made the tangerine filling (w/o) the pralines). It was amazing. I am in culinary school for pastries and used this as part of an original dessert I was making. The chef told me to only add about 1/2 cup of water to the sabayon in the begining, instead of the 1+ cups it says to add. That might be why everyones cream was so thin! Just a tip......

This cake is incredible. It takes forever and a day to make it, but the taste is amazing. If I were to make it again (the jury is out, because it really was a pain...), I would add more hazelnuts for sure. Also, I had the weird occurrence that all of my ladyfinger biscuits floated to the top of the cream. Didn't affect the taste, but was a bit annoying after taking the time to arrange everything. I also suggest making about 1.5 times the recommended amount of syrup (leave amt of grand marnier as is...the cake was a bit boozy...). Overall, this cake is amazing!

I have made this many times and always rave reviews. I have also used Key Lime instead of tangerine and added white chocolate to the marscapone and made a macadamia nut praline, for a tropical tiramisu as I live in the Florida Keys.

I made this for Easter and it was great. The next time I would also grind the praline to make the pieces a little smaller. Also, be careful when using the soft ladyfingers. They absorb the sauce quickly. This is a perfect do ahead recipe, which is excellent.

This dessert never fails to draw raves. A bit labor intensive, but worth the time invested and can be made in advance. Quality of the tangerines is important to achieve a flavorful punch. Elegant, rich, an a memorable presentation.

Loved the presentation and flavor. Only change to the recipe I made was I prepared fresh espresso rather than instant. I was wondering if the cream was supposed to be rather thin? I expected it to be a bit thicker. My praline fell to the bottom as it was freezing. Any thoughts?

I've made this dish many times, and it always draws raves. The original recipe included a photo that shows a nice presentation with a design of cocoa powder stripes on top. I continue to do this using a piece of cardboard and a sifter. However, if I'm bringing this dish to a party, I bring the stencil along and add the cocoa powder there; otherwise, the stripes tend to get disturbed in transit. Hint: I make extra espresso/liquer mixture so that I don't have to worry about running out before soaking all the lady fingers.

Beautiful-looking and absolutely exquisite. I slightly simplified the recipe by first making a sort of creme anglaise with 4 egg yolks, 3/4 cup sugar, tangerine zest and 1 cup tangerine juice (not boiled previously, so no need to add water) plus 2-3 tbsp Grand Marnier, which (once cooled) I mixed with mascarpone, whipped cream and 4 stiff-beaten egg whites (beaten with remaining 1/4 cup sugar). The hazelnut praline made a very delicate contrast (I chopped it really fine, almost powdery).

Absolutely outstanding! The tangerine syrup is sublime. The praline, frozen custard and glazed ladyfingers make for wonderful contrasts in flavor and texture. THe first time I made this it seemed a little time-consuming to prepare, but it has become my signiture dessert and I can put it together rather quickly. It is a good idea to make it the day before you serve. Hint: if you use soft ladyfinger biscuits, you need only soak for about 3 seconds or they become too soggy and fall apart.

I've made this dessert each Christmas for the past several years. It has become a standard in our holiday dessert buffet. I add a little extra Gran Marnier to intensify the flavor, though the tangerines give it a subtle sweet tartness. Also, I find the mascarpone cheese to be superior to cream cheese. The one year I made it with cream cheese I was disappointed. Yes, it does take more than many desserts, but is absolutely worth the effort.

Although the flavor is good, the hard pieces of praline were not a particularly good addition in my opinion.

Shouldn't it be *2* 8.8 oz. containers of mascarpone?

Takes a little more time but worth the effort. I used Kaluah instead of Grand Marnier. For presentation I used chocolate sauce in moderation. German cocoa powder is the best.
