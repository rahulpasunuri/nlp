Made the recipe for my Super Bowl party and served it with large shrimps, radishes, and snow peas. A big hit. It is delicious. I'll use the leftover dressing to make a yummy shrimp salad. A keeper.

I made this recipe a second time thinking it would be better after one practice run and I was proven wrong. I can not get these ingredients to emulsify. The oil separates every time and there is not enough flavor in the dip. Big disappointment since we live in San Francisco where Green Goddess was born.

I used dried tarragon because I couldn't find fresh. Omitted the oil and used 2 tablespoons of mayo. Added more garlic, a bit more shallots, and one more anchovy and let the flavors meld for a day. Turned out great and very flavorful!

I have to agree with the other reviewers who have said this dip is just okay. The flavors were a tad too subtle for a dip.

I was nervous about making this since the reviews are mixed, but it ended up delicious. The flavor was really complex -- better for adults than kids -- and a nice addition to the veggies and shrimp. I used slightly less olive oil than the recipe called for, but I bet you could leave it out entirely.

I thought it was extremely boring, despite all of the fresh (expensive) ingredients. I even let it sit for 24 hours to let the flavors blend before serving it. I skipped the oil all together because it was so thin already. I wont be making it again. Save your money and time.

easy to make but not impressed with the final product. I am reminded that it is the quality of the ingredients that can make or break a recipe. The dip had a bitter undertone which I found came from the fresh basil I used, which was really bitter. Didn't really taste the depth that the anchovies give to dishes and I didn't like the consistancy the avocado gave. It is a dip based on the dressing. I find the dressing much more vibrant and delicious.

I've made this dip twice over the last few weeks to rave reviews! Followed the recipe pretty closely with exception of substituting 1/2 the sour cream with mayonnaise. Offers a great alternative for a shrimp dip to every day cocktail sauce. Will definitely make again!

This dip was so zingey, my roommate made a really sour face when she tasted it. I added extra sour cream and a spoonful of light mayo which seemed to tone it down a bit; but still too zingy/sour. The lemon juice seemed to overpower it and the garlic was a little much. The tarragon overpowered as well, I even used dried and only 2 TB. I served it at my holiday cocktail party with crudites and hardly any of it was eaten.

This dip rocked! We had it for Thanksgiving appetizers and it was a hit esp. with the endive. This is a must have item for your holiday party. Thumbs way up!

After being in fridge the flavour was much improved and everyone raved! I would definately make this again but with half the oil!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and was very dissapointed. It tasted great until I streamed in the 1/2 cup olive oil called for at the end of the recipe. It was way too much, it gave the dip a strong olive oil taste that coated the mouth when eating. I had to throw it out and use Ranch dip instead, which was not nearly as interesting but edible. Maybe half the amount of oil or no oil woud be better.

I forgot the tarragon! So I used basil in place of the tarragon and oregano in place of the basil.. so take my review for what it is worth. I tasted it before I added the olive oil I thought it was fantastic.. after adding the oil it was ok! Just thought I missed the salt and pepper, it is in the fridge hopefully the flavours will merge and it will taste better later!

Delicious and very flavorful. Perhaps the cook who thought it was bland left something out, or didn't add enough S&P? With the anchovies, shallots, herbs, etc. I though it was highly seasoned. Guests gobbled it up, and it was a nice starter - not too heavy before a big meal. I made it as written with two substitutions: I used thick Greek yogurt in place of sour cream, and I subbed a handful of chopped green onions for the garlic. They gave it a nice bright green flavor.

I used very fresh ingredients but the dip was rather bland, though it tasted OK. I added some horse radish to give it some zip and that improved it a little. I'd much prefer the avocado in guacomole than this drab mixture. This would be good with already spicy crackers, however, but is lost on plain vegetables and shrimp.

This is very good, not too rich, and flavorful. The tarragon dominates, though, so you might want to try a lighter hand with that herb. Very nice with shrimp and vegetables.
