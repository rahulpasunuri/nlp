My husband and I make this ALL the time. People have said it's the best macaroni and cheese they've ever had. We make it with old cheddar, half whole milk half 1%, and regular breadcrumbs. A little less fancy but nevertheless, very tasty.

Fantastic dish, with a couple of changes. I used a mix of more flavorful cheeses - Fontina is too mild for our taste. I used 1 1/2c Gruyere, 1 1/2 c. Fontina, and 1/2 c. pecerano romano. It is a bit of work, but a real once or twice a year kind of treat. I made for an appetizer party, and served in white ceramic appetizer spoons - a huge hit!

The dish looked beautiful but lacked in the flavor department. I would make some changes: remove eggs, add gruyere to cheese combination, add onion to the white sauce along with a dash of hot pepper sauce, decrease the amount of bacon, and if planning a special meal, crab meat would be a nice addition.

I've been searching for the best mac & cheese recipe and this is the 4th one I've tried. It ranks, well, 4th. Not bad by any means but doesn't live up to the hype. Too difficult and too expensive for average results. And the eggs, which really aren't needed, can easily curdle. Will not make this one again.

We omitted the peas, used rotini (corkscrew) pasta instead of macaroni, and substituted Muenster cheese for the Fontina. The cheese was a bit clumpy, but that could have been the Muenster or because we cooked the sauce too long, but regardless, it was great!

you can always substitute romano for the parmesan, especially important when one wants a prominent cheese flavor.

The dish IS both time-consuming and pricey. It's not a quick weeknight meal by any means. It is also not a dish for a novice cook or for one who is trying to cut corners. It requires the finest ingredients ("parmesan cheese" does not mean "Kraft in a shaker" and "fresh breadcrumbs" does not mean "Progresso Italian blend"!). Be prepared; two things this recipe does not tell you is that this dish takes a large kitchen area (unless you do some day-ahead prep) and it also takes large pots and pans to hold the quantity. I think a 13x9x2 baking dish is too small. I have always added a smaller baking dish and filled both. Give the extra to a friend and you'll get some compliments for your hard work. That's worth the time :)

Actually, I taught my 15-year-old to make this recipe, and it was well-received by the family. I agree with others that the bacon could probably be reduced, and I think something a bit sharper than the Fontina would be preferable. But all in all, it was a satisfying, elegant variation on a comfort food standard.

Rating: 2
Passable. Very expensive and time consuming to make, and in my estimation, not worth the effort. My husband felt the bacon overpowered the delicate flavor of the fontina, so IF I ever did make it again (though not likely) I'd cut the bacon way down. Bottom line is, there are better macaroni and cheese recipes out there. I won't make it again.

Hands down, this is the most raved about dish that I have ever made, and I cook a lot and I cook well. It feeds a large group and is so rich and creamy that a little goes a long way. I leave out the peas, but I'm sure it's fine with them.

Rating: 3
I really liked this recipe and didn't find it bland at all. It was creamy, cheesy, with a little garlicky crunch for texture. The perfect "comfort" food. The key may be to use quality fontina and parmesan cheese that have sharpness and taste.

Rating: 3
Second time I made this - very good. Enjoyed by all. A little bit heavy, but worth it. Nice combination of cheeses - shows through on the final product. Allow yourself plenty of do-ahead time for this one.

This is the best mac and cheese recipe I have found. My boyfriend is a big fan of any baked pasta and declared this his all time fave. I made a few changes: added half an onion to the bacon/bread crumb mixture and cooked w/ the bacon, mixed Fontina, Sharp Cheddar, and Gruyere and I used 2 percent milk instead of whole. It was amazing and I found it rather simple.

I have saved this recipe for two years looking the right time to make it. I really wanted it to be tasty, creamy and a "blockbuster" as the author described. How wrong I was. I thought the recipe was bland and unexciting. And I had hoped it would be a winner seeing as it was the recipe of the year. I found the French bread/bacon topping to be uninspired and grainy. The actual macaroni and cheese sauce was near tasteless and not at all creamy. I really don't understand the recipe of the year rating. I wonder if the author Rochelle Palermo cooked this dish or is still writing for Bon Appetite after such a disappointing recipe entry. I have never written a review before so please excuse the bad rating but I was really disappointed with this recipe. I really did want this recipe to be a "blockbuster".

Rating: 3
I thought this receipe had a lot of potential. I liked the crunchy topping, the sauce was creamy. it is labor intensive. and i think it is bland. i would use a cheese with more kick to it than fontina, and maybe that would make the difference. i also think you can halve the bacon.

This is wonderfull! I'm 11 years old and i managed to make this. My family and i DON'T think this is boring, we think this is AWESOME! I'll DEFINITELY make this again!

I haven't made this, but I know it was voted "Dish Of the Year" in '00. Just by reading the recipe, I can tell it's gotta be all in the Technique. As for the cook in BC, three cups of bread crumbs DOES weigh 4 ounces... at least on my scale. You are confusing weight measurements and volume measurements.

I was looking forward to tasting the best mac& cheese,but instead this turned out bland at least for our taste buds.Also when do three cups of bread crumbs equal four ounces????? Other cooks beware don't waste your time with this version.

Although I hate mac and cheese; this is a wonderful version. Probably should be made only once a year as you can almost hear your arteries slamming shut!

This recipe was bland and not creamy. I was very disatisfied. With 6 egg yolks I thought the recipe would be creamy but it was not and it was very time consuming to make. It just goes to show you that eventhough a recipe gets good reviews it may not be to your liking. This recipe was very difficult and the end results were boring. I will not make this again, it's a waste of time.

Thought that this was an excellent change for plain old Mac & Cheese. I made it for a luncheon with a big salad and it was a huge hit. Even my 2 year old loved it!

This pleased even the pickiest eater after omitting the peas. I used half Fontina, half Cheddar and used non-fat milk because I had it on hand, it took a little longer to thicken, but worked fine.

OMG! This was the best M&C I have EVER had. We did leave out the peas, but otherwise followed it to a T, and it was wonderful!!!

I'm glad I didn't read the reviews before making this dish - or I wouldn't have made it! Since I do the cooking and my husband does the dishes, he developed a "taste to dish" ratio. In other words, the taste must outweigh the number of dishes in order to be kept on the menu. Once I saw the number of dishes, I did them myself for fear he would veto the dish on that very principle. I substituted mild cheddar for the fontina since it's not readily available near me and was very pleased with the results. No problems at all with the eggs or roux and the sauce was very creamy. While quite time consuming, I didn't find it to be outrageously expensive and the leftovers were even better the next day. I'll make it again, but probably on a Sunday afternoon.

I was inspired to make homemade mac and cheese after reading a certain excerpt of a book, and inspiration is what it takes to appreciate the work it takes to make the dish. It is definately a comfort food, and I would make it again for a large group of people, as the recipe makes a ton on food. Delicious!

Rating: 4
Really re-defines comfort food! Yes, it takes time and more concentration than is fun sometimes, but the results are worth it! It is a keeper.

This was an outstanding spin on a classic favorite. Plus, it's a snap to make. Great anytime of year.

DELICIOUS!!!I substituted the fontina cheese with Queso guayanes for all us South Americans who cant get the real thing. I also added grated cheddar. It was great. the cheese sauce was just right. It looked so appetizing that the "vegies"in the group had seconds even with the bacon on top.

I love this recipe and have made it often. I have even had requests from visiting guests to make during their visit. That speaks for itself!! After reading other reviews, I have to ask, "what were you expecting". It is just what it claims to be---delicious comfort food.

Time and effort not worth the result. Stick to kraft mac and cheese and if you want carbonara make the real thing.

Oh, I loved this recipe. The flavors were just terrific. It turned out richer even than I thought. Great leftovers, too. I did as suggested as tempered the egg yolks; I had no problem with the sauce.

Very tasty but kinda like eating a "fat pill". I used Romano cheese instead of parmesan because I like the stronger taste of Pecorino romano.

I have made this recipe at least 5 times, and my teenagers and their friends love it. I hardly ever have leftovers. I lost the recipe and tried to recreate it from memory, but forgot the egg yolks. It was dry, but still tasty. Now that I've found the real recipe, I'll probably make it again this weekend. Can't even compare to boxed mac and cheese.

This recipe take the basic mac & cheese to new heights! I prefer to use crushed garlic croutons instead of breadcrumbs for the topping in addition to a blend of Fontina, Cheddar & Monterey Jack cheese. After serving this to family and dinner guests, I can't imagine how anyone could even consider using the boxed version. I've always made mac & cheese from scratch and agree this recipe is more time consuming, but certainly worth the time.

Rating: 3
I'm really suprised by how stongly some disliked the recipe. I have made this a couple of times, and still need some practice before I can make a cheese sauce that is perfectly smooth and thick enough, but I loved the flavors and so has everybody that I have fed this to. Fontina is definately a subtler flavor than the flourescent orange cheese powder of your average box of mac and cheese. It all depends on what your taste buds prefer...I personally vote for this kind and not the boxed kind.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe many times. While it is quite rich everyone I have ever made it for has loved it. Some of the people who berated this recipe in their reviews obviously are very unsophisticated. Mac and cheese from the box instead indeed. Maybe you should try tuna and mayo on white bread also.

Made this dish for a holiday party and it went fast. It was delicious, but because of the time (and money) I would recommend it for a more intimate dinner party.

I love macaroni and cheese, this version didn't even remotely resemble a comfort food. This was the most expensive meatless (in this case the bacon can't be considered "meat") dish we've ever made. We made this dish for some company who had to cancel because they came down with the flu......boy I envied them! The eggs curdled badly (the mag editors should warn readers when this drastic a reaction is possible). We've never before thrown out an entire freshly made dish. We've ritualistically cremated this issue.

I don't think I'll be making this recipe, partly because of the very mixed reviews, but mainly because its Sooo unhealthy ! A line has to be drawn somewhere - even by comfort-food lovers like me. Just wanted to add that I love RAJIV K's reviews. Opinionated & funny. He knows what he's talking about, too.

Rating: 3
I am the Culinary Arts Instructor at a Technical High School, and my students operate a restaurant that is open to the public. I decided this was a good comfort food to try out - and it has been great! Yes, it is time consuming, but if you follow the recipe - use proper technique (don't brown your roux, temper your eggs, etc), it turns out very well. All the customers have loved it - as have the kids. I leave out the peas (mostly because I don't like them), but other than that - it works well. We double the recipe. We will be making it for the 3rd time tomorrow.

Followed this timeconsuming recipe exactly and was very disappointed with the results. Not one of my lunch guests finished their portion. My family says stick with the mac&cheese in a box.

Look, if you don't temper your egg yolks, OF COURSE THEY'LL CURDLE!!! Jeez people it takes PATIENCE. Don't crank the heat to "10" (or however your settings are) and expect good results. When you add the flour, you now are making a ROUX. Slow and steady is the KEY (do not let it turn brown...you are looking for a WHITE roux----brown gives totally different flavor). If your heat is too high, you'll BURN the flour before you COOK it (big difference) Now....you don't like bacon, don't put it in. Just use butter instead of the bacon drippings. Whole milk? If you don't like all that fat, use 2% or 1% for a lighter, not-so-thick version (avoid skim PLEASE). And finally, if you don't like the strong taste of Fontina, THEN MAKE A MIXTURE..... This is far from a bland dish if you know what the heck you are doing. Dish of the Year? Now that's debatable, but it's still VERY GOOD (at least the way I made it).

I've made this dish 3 times already. Eventhough I had a little trouble finding the Fontina cheese, it was worth it! The combination of the rich and creamy cheese sauce with the crisp bacon and breadcrumbs gives incredible results. This is one of my favorite Sunday meals.

I'm just sorry I didn't visit the web site before making this from the mag! Receipe of the Year! What were you guys thinking? This was really awful! Bland underneath and overpowering on top. Your better off following the receipe off the side of the Ronzoni noodle box!

I was curious to see what others thought of this recipe and was amused to see that I'm not alone. I only gave it one "fork" because "yuck" was not an option! I spent all afternoon preparing it, too much money on ingredients, and was terribly disappointed with the results. It was pasta carbonara using elbow macaroni instead of linguini, and worse than any carbonara recipe I've ever tried. My mother taught me that it is a sin to waste food, yet I chose to sin and I threw the leftovers away.

I'm sorry, but I thought this was so disgusting. I actually had to choke it down to justify what we spent on the ingredients and how much time my husband spent making it. I couldn't bear to face the leftovers. We threw it away.

I'm so surprised to see that no one liked this recipie! Admittedly, I did not follow it exactly (I omitted the bacon and peas, and didn't use fontina), but I thought it was wonderful. I served it to a number of my friends, and ate a number of servings myself. I thought it was comfort food yummy.

I can't for the life of me follow a recipe completely so my comments here are obviously depending on what I did to this recipe. I loved the idea so proceeded to make it. I had no eggs and knew I didn't need them, I used a combination of cheeses including smoked cheddar and fontina, I had some fresh bread crumbs from a variety of breads, and I used less macaroni. Everyone I have made this for has asked for the recipe, which of course I can't provide! Be creative! Use this as a starting point and you won't be sorry.

What a disappointment. I'm glad I didn't try this one out on guests. I would recommend making a traditional mac & cheese using the fontina and bacon. Forget the eggs . . .there is too much risk of curdling. This recipe tries too hard to be like a real carbonara . . .definitely not recipe of the year. Don't bother with this one.Lizzie

This certainly was not the "dish of the year" in my opinion. It was the most time consuming and expensive ($26) dish of mac and cheese I've ever made. It thought the eggs made it spongy and the bacon, over-the-top rich and fattening.

I would definitely make this dish again...it was very tasty though I would probably not use all Fontina cheese; I think a cheese blend of Fontina and Monterey Jack cheese would have been better. The addition of the peas was interesting though not necessary.

This dish was named a "Dish of the Year" by Bon Apetit. I couldn't disagree more. It took a long time to assemble and the dish tasted so-so. VERY basic comfort food. Not cheesy enough... maybe using alot more cheese than the recipe calls for would help.

Absolutely wonderful & easy!! Instead of Fontina cheese & I purchased a packaged, pre-shredded blend of cheeses which included fontina, parmesan & monteray jack. I made the whole dish about 3 hours in advance and baked it for about an hour at 350 until breadcrumb mixture turned golden & macaroni mixture started to bubble!! Breadcrunb mixture the crowning touch!!
