I don't get the reviews. It was not for me, or my guest. Entirely 'meh'.

I used spaghetti, broken into thirds before boiling. Delicious. Very popular at a large picnic buffet.

Despite the rave reviews I thought the salad was dull and a bit too sweet and oily. I added cilantro and chopped peanuts and that perked it up a bit. I think that next time I would try a different dressing with a little kick. Way too much dressing is left over and chutney is expensive!

Made for a July 4 cookout. Everyone loved it. Made slight modifications: used 1/4 cup less oil in dressing; used bow tie pasta; added pre-shred carrot for color; left out the chicken and served this as a pasta side dish. Really good.

I used the suggestions given...less oil, less green onions. Fabulous! My husband says this is his favorite recipe of all...and I like to cook so that is saying something!

Really, really good. I used the mango ginger chutney from TJ's and soba noodles. Delish! Will make again - soon!

I made this dish for my boyfriend last night and served it in chinese takeout boxes with chopsticks. I made slight changes by adding some quickly sauteed broccoli slaw and a handful of chopped peanuts. I omitted the sesame seeds. A perfect meal for a hot summer night!

This was fantastic! The only changes I made were regarding the oil. I didn't toss the noodles in the sesame oil and I only added just under 1/2 cup of veg oil to the dressing. While it's a bit thinner, it's tastier and healthier.

I really liked this dinner. It was light easy and yummy. The only things I would change is the amount of oil in the dressing. With the amount in the directions, I could taste the oil, so I used about half the vegetable and sesame oil the second time

This was good, but could use some qty adjustments on the ingredients: double chx double, maybe triple noodles less grn onions (maybe 4 instead of 6) It was nice that it was so easy to put together.

This dish is terrific. The fact that it is made of leftovers from the grilled Asian Chicken with Bok Choy etc... recipe makes it especially worthy of four forks. It tastes wonderful and was already halfway prepared. I made the primary dish on Sunday. Putting the noodle salad together on Tuesday was a snap as the chicken and dressing were already done. I added steamed asparagus and next time would consider adding pear tomatoes for a little contrast. I made two changes: 1) I used skinless boneless chicken thighs instead of breasts with skin on, and 2) I cut the oil down by 1/4 cup in the dressing. It is OK to cut the oil, but in the future I would make 1.5 times the dressing to cover both meals.

This is a perfect summer weeknight dinner -- I bought grilled chix from the deli counter to save time and in the future would make it with shrimp or tofu also. If peanut allergies are an issue this is a great noodle recipe as so many Asian noodle dishes call for peanut butter.

The mango-sesame dressing in this summer dinner salad is delicious and it has definitely piqued my interest for other uses. Im happy to have the recipe in my repertoire. I did have trouble locating the key ingredient, Major Greys mango chutney. I was in the correct aisle, but it was located in my grocery store near the ketchup and ham glazes. The dressing recipe calls for 3/4 cup of chutney, which is precisely one 9 ounce bottle. Some other reviewers thought the dressing is so good you can drink itit really is! I opted to pan fry the chicken rather than grill it, which worked out quite well. The online version of the recipe accidentally omitted the sugar snap peas, but it really does require 12 ounces of them. However, I think less sugar snap peas and more udon would be better. http://michaelbeyer.wordpress.com/2010/06/13/asian-chicken-noodle-salad-with-snap-peas/

The dressing for this salad was superb, however, I had alot of dressing left over. I used some of the dressing to baste the chicken while grilling. I used dried udon noodles were just fine. I will definitely be using the recipe again for sure, I will try it with grilled shrimp as well.

I wanted to drink the mango dressing! I only used 1/2 a cup of oil and it worked out beautifully. I may even do a little less next time and think it out with stock or coconut milk! I also used dried udon noodles and again, delicious!

I used Patak's Mango Chutney because it had less sugar and was cheaper. I had to watch the salt, though, because it is higher in sodium. Having said all of this, the first night grilled chicken was great but the pasta salad was fantastic. The choice of noodle can be confusing - I bought fresh cooked udon instead of fresh precooked udon. But the package was 16 oz and it worked out fine. I had to freshen it briefly in boiling water to get it to come apart. I also made an extra chicken breast to make this meatier for my two boys, which they liked. I put the hot cooked snap peas into the bowl on top of the green onions, cooking them slightly which made the onions a bit milder.

I've made this (just the salad) twice since I got the magazine last week!

Delicious. A great recipe for using fresh snap peas and onions from the garden. Especially liked the dressing and with so much left over, will use it with grilled chicken this weekend.

Delicious, easy, relatively inexpensive. My husband and I both loved this dish. The mango dressing is wonderful. Didn't add the dressing to the noodle, chicken, etc., added what we wanted to the portions we put on our plate. Next time I may try this with shrimp. We highly recommend trying this recipe. I used light soy for less salt.

This is fantastic, a wonderful summer evening meal, very hard to stop eating. I suggest using Sharwood chutney, found at Whole Foods, for the dressing. It has a very fresh, mango taste. Also used dried udon and seasoned rice vinegar, and those worked fine. Grilled the chicken basting with a bit of the dressing. The dressing would be great by itself on grilled chicken. When printed, the recipe calls for 12 oz sugar snap peas.

Made this with thick spaghetti and peapods because that's what the grocery store had. Turned out really well - the sauce is very, very good. I will make this again and probably try green beans and red peppers instead of snap peas.

when you print off the recipe the sugar snap peas shows up :)

Easy and delicious. This was made according to the recipe, with fresh udon noodles and the sugar snap peas added. I also added some salted peanuts for crunch, and served it over baby romaine leaves. Because this is mango season in Hawaii, I fanned some mango slices on each plate.

Made this for lunch and it was delicious! I made it with soba noodles. It appears that they forgot to list the 12oz of sugar snap peas in the ingredients.

Snap peas? What snap peas? Nowhere are they listed among the ingredients.

This recipe is so easy to make! And the dressing you almost want to drink it's so good!
