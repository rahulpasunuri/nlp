The shrimp cakes were good, but not anything to get excited about. I hand-chopped the shrimp. If I make them again, I will chop half, and process the other half, hoping that I could form a more evenly rounded patty. I didn't make the sauce yet because I had another sauce leftover that I thought would work.

We loved the shrimp cakes, making them larger as a main dish. However, we found the sauce to have a bit of an odd flavor which was not to our liking and substitued a spicy mayonnaise. We will definitely be making the shrimp cakes again . . . and again . . . and again.

this is a truly simple and enjoyable dish. I skip the food processor and cut all the ingredients by hand because I like a chunkier texture. I also like to sub parsley for the cilantro and use the shrimp cakes for Eggs Benedict. They are easy to make in advance and fry up quickly for an elegant brunch.

Wow, this was amazing. Truly, absolutely delicious. The cream sauce goes perfectly with the shrimp cakes. I would recommend chopping half the shrimp by hand, and mix all the ingredients minus the shrimp in the processor, then add the shrimp last giving it a few pulses. Then put mixture in a bowl and add the other half of chopped shrimp. Gives it some chunky texture which greatly helps. I took this to my cooking club, and everyone loved it. Definitely something to make to impress guest, and it's not difficult at all. You will not be disappointed.

Made this for a dinner party and got rave reviews for this. I too put the shrimp in the Cuisinart at the end so they stayed a little chunky. Definitely a keeper!

Wow. So danged good. I did not whizz the shrimp in the processor til all other ingredients pureed and left them a bit chunky. Made them to this point the day before and I think it made a difference. I did not use cilantro as I dont care for it, but used fresh parsley instead. Had Saffron sauce and chard left over from a sole recipe and used it as the sauce. OMG. Seriously good. Hubby would like to have these again!

I have been using Epicurious for years but this is my first review. These shrimp cakes warrant praise. They are my go-to recipe when I want something a little different for guests or a little special for my family. They are my husband's favorite. It is imperative that you hand chop the shrimp. A food processor turns them to mush and really saves no time. Refrigeration for several hours keeps them intact while cooking. The Chili-Lime Cream Sauce is a must. Puts the recipe over the top.

This is excellent, I have made this several times. My teenage sons practically fight over it. I buy medium shrimp to keep the cost down, since it gets cut into smaller pieces anyway. Sauce is a must!

Made these great cakes twice exactly as written except using 1 lb. fresh Maine shrimp because in season. These small shrimp are usually more delicate in texture and a little sweeter than others. I cooked them in canola oil. They freeze well. The sauce is not necessary in my opinion - too much time for too many calories. We like them just as well served on greens with a little vinaigrette and a teaspoon or so of garlic/lime aioli.

Really liked the recipe and sauce. I hand chopped the shrimp instead of putting them in a food processor. I also followed another readers suggestion and added some powdered sugar to the sauce to cut down the acidity, which really worked.

I was expecting an asian pancake but this was more like crab cakes but with shrimp. It was tasty and easy to make. The Chili-Lime sauce is key. I think if I make it again, I will follow another reviewer and chop most of the shrimp separately and then add to the cake mixture so there are chunks of shrimp.

Rating: 4
Easy and delicious. Perfect texture. Next time I'll do the "blending" in the food processor rather than the blender. I may have used the wrong sauce -- I used Huy Fong sriracha for the cream sauce. It seemed to mask the taste of the shrimp cakes. Next time I'll use chili garlic sauce that isn't quite so hot or come up with a sauce of my own. The shrimp cakes were quite good without any sauce.

Absolutely delicious and a huge hit at our dinner party. I did pulse about 3/4 of shrimp in the food processor and chopped the rest. It made it easier to form into cakes. Also on Chili- Lime Cream sauce I added a bit of fine sugar (Baker's Sugar) to cut the acidity. I followed the advise of the cook from State College, PA and made both in the morning and reheated just before serving. Used a whisk vigorously to keep sauce from separating.

Decided to try this after reading all the raves, and it worked just great. My husband couldn't get enough of them. Like most of the other reviewers, I made some changes, using a shallot and some chopped tomato, and leaving out the lemon juice, cilantro and pepper sauce. I was concerned that the mixture wouldn't hold together, however it did and the panko made the difference. I made 4 large cakes, and stored them in the freezer for 30 minutes, then put them in the fridge until I cooked them. Didn't use the sauce, as we aren't big on sauces, but even "naked" they were super. Will definitely make again.

Yum! These were so good! I made a little ahead, then reheated in the oven. Don't chop the shrimp too muc. Also, my high rating is for the cakes, NOT the sauce.

This recipe was incredible!!! I tried following the recipe fairly closely, but I had an unknown amount of shrimp, somewhere between 1.5 pounds to 2.5 pounds, so I eyeballed the amounts of most of the ingredients. I also followed the advice of chopping the shrimp by hand, rather than just throwing them in the food processor. Apparently, I didnt chop them enough, because I was having some issues forming them in to cakes. I added a little more bread crumbs and took half the mixture and ran it through the food processor until it was a bit smoother, then mixed that batch in with the other hand-chopped batch. They formed easily and held together perfectly. The sauce is really what made this dish though. The cakes alone I would have rated 3 forks, but the sauce netted the 4th. I will definitely be making this again. I do recommend doubling the sauce recipe.

Rating: 4
This recipe is fantastic! I have made it at least seven or eight times and it has been absolutely wonderful each time. I chopped the shrimp by hand like other reviewers. I would also suggest using a little less of the chili-garlic sauce in the chili-lime cream sauce as it was extremely spicy as written and overpowered the amazing flavor of the shrimp cakes. I serve the cakes as an entree with white rice mixed with fresh chopped cilantro alongside. Enjoy!!

Rating: 3
Should've read the other reviews before I made it - wouldn't have used the processor. Went exactly by the recipe, guess I overprocessed because they were heavy and pasty. Would not add as much lime next time too. Will make ONE more time following others' suggestions, if it isn't better then, I'll stick with old-fashioned shrimp fritters. At least shrimp is reasonably priced here.

Four forks aren't enough for this dish. Absolutely delicious. This recipe has been in my recipe box for awhile now and I've been waiting for an opportunity to give it a try. I made it exactly as written, (I did followed other reviewers suggestions and chopped the shrimp by hand) along with the chili lime cream sauce and brought it to a wine tasting party. Everyone loved it! I even doubled the recipe and I have no leftovers. In response to the reviewer who wondered if they could be served cold, I served mine at room temperature and they were still wonderful. I spooned a bit of the sauce on top of each cake and garnished with a cilantro leaf. Beautiful, easy and so yummy.

Rating: 4
These are divine. I have to double the recipie these are so good. The chili-lime cream sauce is also a must. I love the flavor the wine brings out. To the shrimp cakes I added a table spoon of finely chopped red bell pepper for added color. I also leave the shrimp cakes in the freezer for a litle longer than the recipie says so they hold together better and then give them one final dusting of panko right before I place them in the frying pan. I use canola oil to fry them in. My husband goes back for thirds!

Rating: 4
these shrimp cakes have been a hit every time I've made them. I'll admit I've fudged the sauce due to lack of ingredients, not enough time etc. but they are so easy to make. I agree with all other reviewers who say to chop up all the shrimp by hand. the food processor produces a shrimp 'mousse'. I did a fast fry submerging them in peanut oil, they come out golden brown and perfectly crispy outside, tender inside. will try them with fresh crab next time!!

Following the directions exactly (except for making twice as much chili-lime cream sauce), this dish was a hit. The spiciness of the sauce makes this more suitable for an appetizer. I'd put more cream in the sauce if my plan were to make this the main course. I fried a few of the cakes (use medium heat because medium-high burns the panko), and baked the rest. Both ways tasted great, but I'll bake all in the future.

This was great. I used a grainy Dijon mustard and adobe sauce rather than the hot pepper sauce. Following the advice of others, I only pulsed the shrimp and mixed the other ingredients by hand for textural appeal. I served this with the Cilantro-Lime Mayonnaise from this site. However, I can attest that the Chili-Lime Cream Sauce is also excellent as I often serve it with seared scallops.

These were excellent and the sauce is perfect with them! I made the shrimp cakes larger and we had them as a main dish sauteed vegetables. I could not find panko at our local supermarkets and used bread crumbs. I would decrease the amount of bread crumbs/panko next time. The sauce is very tasty and makes the dish. The sauce would be good with other seafood.

I made these last night and they were a hit! I do not have a food processor, so I chopped everything by hand and I liked the chunky texture of the cakes. I also did not find Panko at my local store, so I used plain bread crumbs instead. For the sauce, I did not even try to make it. It seemed that people either loved it or hated it. I had another idea for a sauce which went with it very nicely. It's a wasabi cilantro cream sauce: sour cream, mayo, wasabi paste, cilantro, lime juice and a splash of cream. My boyfriend has already asked me when I would make them again!!!

Rating: 3
Delicious. I used a 1/4 cup measure as a mold. Just spray with Pam and pack shrimp mix into cup. Tap out onto waxed paper and roll in panko. I served on a fish shaped platter with sauce on bottom and some sauce drizzled on top of cakes.

I really liked the shrimp cakes by themselves - I did coarse chop as others suggested and it made a real difference. I also used double the cilantro and made sure to season after frying. Want to fiddle with the sauce - I did use the chili lime recipe which accompanies this recipe. I used Sriracha (we call it rooster sauce because of the rooster on the bottle)which I love. I think I would have been happier adding fresh minced chiles and garlic instead though.

Rating: 4
OK...made this for our Anniversary. I have to say it was restaurant material. I also chopped instead of pureeing the shrimp which I agree keeps a better texture. I doubled the ginger in the sauce and added lime zest. I used 'Taste of Thai Garlic Chili Pepper Sauce' in the Chili Cream Sauce and thought it was magnificent. I used fresh water prawns from Indonesia and they were meaty and fresh tasting. I was almost crying they were so good. I served it with Jasmine Rice and grilled Asparagus with Garlic/Basil/Olive Oil. It was a moment in time.

These shrimp cakes are awesome! I made them for my bridal shower and they were gone in seconds. A few changes though: I chopped everything by hand to make sure that the shrimp was chunky (not pasty) and to ensure a good texture to the shrimp cake. Also, I used a cookie scoop for uniform cakes. And I made up a sauce other than the one given in the recipe: cilantro, mayo, lemon juice, hot sauce. Very delicious!

I've made these three different times and each time they disappear in about five minutes. They are excellent! Last time I made them, I doubled the recipe and ended up with 26 - 1 1/2" cakes. I don't really like the sauce that goes with them so I make my own: 3/4 c. mayo, 1/4 c. spicy cocktail sauce, 2 t. Old Bay, and a squeeze of lemon juice. Can't wait to make them again.

This was very good. I followed the recipe as written with the exception of the lemon juice. I substituted lime juice instead. These were very crispy and tangy and went well with the sauce. However, they don't re-heat so well, so only make as much as you are going to eat!

I made these tonight for myself and a friend and I was amazed at how delicious they were! I made slightly bigger cakes, as I served them as a main course. I am obsessed with crab cakes, but these were cheaper and, it turns out, just as delicious. I did make a few slight changes: 1) I used wild caught shrimp. Farm-raised seafood tastes like cardboard, and if your shrimp is flavorless, you won't be able to pull off this recipe. 2) I used organic eggs, and since organic eggs are smaller, I needed two "large" organic eggs. 3) I replaced the Dijon mustard with a scoop of wasabi paste. More in keeping with the Asian-inspired flavors, and delicious! 4) Remember that cooking times vary according to your own kitchen. On my gas stove, four minutes total for each cake was more than sufficient. I mention that because I noticed some folks complained about rubberiness. 5) My food processor was on the fritz, so I did the chopping and mixing by hand. It was still a pretty easy recipe!

I made this for Christmas lunch and all of us loved it. The texture of the cake was light and not rubbery pasty like fish cake. I could still bite the prawn. However, I'm not sure why the crust was not crunchy. I expected and prefer the crunchy texture. As for the sauce, I added Hooter's Buffalo Wing sauce as I couldn't find the chilli garlic sauce.

Brought this dish to a New Years Eve get together and everyone raved about this dish. The cilantro is key to the fresh taste. Made the sauce with half and half and it turned out fine.

I added one tsp. of brown sugar to balance the acid and spice, used a sliced green onion instead of the shallot, also grated the ginger instead of chopping, added 1/2 tsp. of salt, cut the chili-garlic sauce down to 1.5 tbsp. and cut the butter in half.

WAY GOOD! Used local SC shrimp. Didn't have cilantro so I added a little extra green onion and some fresh parsley. If you refrigerate the cakes for 2 - 3 hours prior to cooking, 1. they taste better and 2. they won't fall apart in the pan as easily. Don't be afraid of the butter content in the sauce.

Dijon Mayonnaise: Mix the following ingredients in a small bowl: 1 cup mayonnaise 2 teaspoons dijon mustart 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice (I can't remember but I might use just one - and then taste it - if you like more 'tang' then you can add the second teaspoon) 1 tablespoon finely chopped chives 1/2 - 1 teaspoon minced and seeded jalapeno pepper salt and pepper to taste Mix together and refrigerate for at least a half hour.

Excellent! I used a one lb bag of Emeril's wild caught shrimp and this may have made the difference. Most of the shrimp available today is farm raised and doesn't have as much flavor. I followed the recipe for the shrimp cakes and sauce as written and everyone raved!

Very good. Made them twice in as many days. Increased the shrimp, scallions and cilantro the 2nd time, but I couldn't really tell that much of a taste difference. Okay...the increase in ingredients was so I could get a few more cakes. You caught me! Will definitely make again after I try the 100 corner shrimp balls.

So delicious! My husband and I stumbled upon this gem of a restaurant in Maui and were thrilled to recreate the flavors of that meal. These are fabulous!

Tasteless cakes - the sauce was the only reason to keep eating.

Great shrimp cakes, but still pales in comparison to the exalted "hundred-corner shrimp balls" recipe.

Both the shrimp cakes and the sauce were AWESOME!! A huge hit during dinner ... so much so that we were all too full for the entree!!

Just celebrated our 3rd annual girl's weekend in Calistoga. The 5 of us have been friends since kindergarten (47 years ago). As the "live-in chef," I prepared the Shrimp Cakes for one of our appetizers. They were a huge hit - tasty and perfectly seasoned. The sauce was great too and there were no complaints about the heat. Will definitely make again.

Wonderful first course! Added an extra green onion and used a sweeter chili garlic sauce, so that cut down on the heat. Everyone raved--the only request I got was to double the recipe next time so there would be even more to enjoy!

These are wonderful! I was serving this as an entree so made six larger patties. The sauce is wonderfully spicy, but I think the cakes, well, take the cake! I will make these again and experiment with other sauces. I'm thinking a remoulade would be nice for those who don't like hot. I will also try substituting wasabi paste for the chile paste. But do try the original sauce first, especially if you love the heat. Wonderful!

Probably the best appetizer I have ever made for a dinner party and I have had a bunch of dinner parties! Used raw Tiger prawns--one pound and natural dried breadcrumbs. Made 12 small cakes; just enough for a first course served with a little rocket salad.

The shrimp cakes were easy and had great flavor. I'm not sold on the sauce though. It reminded me of wing sauce - must be all the butter combined with heat. Anyway, I'll definitely make the cakes again & search for another sauce.

This was a fabulous recipe! I referred to a friend who caters for a heavy appetizer! Definitely a keeper!

So stinkin good! I made these at a party and they hardly had time to touch the platter before they were gobbled up. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. Be careful not to overprocess the shrimp! Also, don't cut down on butter in the sauce as has been recommended in other reviews. It is excessive, but sometimes you just have to go for it. If you were to consume it on a daily basis then you'd be in trouble, but once in a while a splurge is worth it, and this is one of those times!

I served this as a first course and my guests wanted seconds. Just delicious. I used big shrimp (they're better than the small ones) but I still had to buy about 23 to make a pound. The ONLY change I made was to add one more green onion for a total of two, using part of the green also. Otherwise, I made as directed. We did not find it too spicy. I only got about 10 small cakes out of it and two were perfect for a serving, served on a puddle of the sauce. (I think the recipe said it would make 12 cakes but those would have been just too tiny.) I sure would NOT cut down on the butter as others have. Maybe that's why some found the sauce too spicy. I thought the recipe as-is (with the addition of one green onion) was just wonderful and I will definitely make these again. Be careful not to over-process the shrimp. You do not want paste!

Made the cakes with the chili-lime cream sauce last night as a precursor to main course of grilled halibut and coho salmon from Alaska. We loved them!! Only one person did not care for the sauce-too spicy for him but everyone else thought the sauce was wonderful on the cakes (used the full 2 tbsp of the chili-garlic sauce and fresh ginger-cut back some on the butter). I make a similiar sauce for salmon cakes that uses tomato paste instead of the chile-garlic sauce and basil instead of ginger - will probably make that version as an alternate next time for those folks that are not so fond of spicy sauces. Another great recipe to add to my collection!

This is a delicious recipe. I have made it twice--once for my husband and last night for a dinner party, and received rave reviews. I did do some changes which are: 3 green onions 1 tbs lemon juice 1/2 tbs dijon mustard a few drops of tabasco 1/4 tsp salt 1 cup panko The chili cream sauce is too hot. The first time I made it, I did not have fresh ginger, So I used 1/2 tsp ground ginger. I like this better. Also only use about 2 tsp chili garlic sauce. You don't need all of the butter--2 tbs. is perfect. One needs an assertive wine to stand up to the spicieness of this dish.

The name of the recipe says it has lime in it, but the recipe includes only lemon juise.

My husband made these for dinner and they were delicious! They would be a very tasty appetizer.

These were excellent and so easy. I used a bit too much oil in the pan trying to get them all fried at once, so they were more deep fried than pan sauted regardless, they were still great, even my picky son who hates anything from the sea ate 3. The sauce would be excellent on anything that could be grilled.

Oh my! This is an awesome appetizer. Heck, I've just made it for dinner because it is so awesome. Perhaps a little less garlic/chili sauce for those who don't enjoy spicy food. Guests will rave.
