My husband and I enjoyed the recipe; I would recommend it for company, but not for a weeknight dinner - it is a lot of prep and it takes a long time to make as you can tell from the steps. The colours are truly stunning. We didn't have sherry vinegar on hand, but balsamic worked well. I also didn't put in the full amount of caraway seed as it is not a favourite spice of mine.

This was an outstanding dish! It was a symphony of flavors. We have had it twice, and loved it both times even tho I overcooked (by accident) the cabbage a little and carmelized it. I plan to use it for company because it is a one dish meal and doesn't require constant attention...it took about an hour and a half from start to finish, but only 45 was intense working time and the presentation was beautiful...red! purple, orange, green, etc.

This was amazing. I don't know why the first couple of people didn't like it. To me, the flavors were amazing. The sweet rhubarb and cabbage with the salty salmon, peppery arugula and creamy yogurt, YUM! It was outstanding and I will be making it again soon!

I thought the mixture of flavors was quite wonderful. My guests raved about it.

I don't agree at all with the previous reviews, although my husband found the yogurt and rhubarb topping very distracting and unnecessary. I really enjoyed the whole dish though. I would make it again but would reduce the amount of sugar in the cabbage. I loved the blend of flavors. Used king salmon and thought it was meaty enough to stay strong in the mix of stuff going on. This dish felt and looked healthy and made for a pretty plate.

This is perhaps the most bizarre recipe I have ever made. Nothing quite goes together from the ingredients to the colors on the plate. I agree that it's overly sweet and is not well suited to salmon. Using chicken as an alternative, as the recipe suggests, would be a good idea.

Would not use salmon next time; the cabbage tasted nice altho a little too sweet; the rhubarb was wonderful; and dthe salmon was fine but the flavors did not work well together. If I do this again, would use pork or a white fish but definitely NOT salmoon.
