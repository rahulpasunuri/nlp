I did not have bulgur so I used quinoa. It was good but did not need all of that chicken broth. I could have used water or maybe half broth / half water.

The children in the house did´t eat it. The flavor was too spicy for them. Perhaps it would suit their taste if it has less curry.

I made this as a stuffing for vegetables (peppers, tomatoes, eggplant), and it was delicious! It was a bit strong when first made, but just right the next day when I stuffed the vegies, sprinkled nuts on top, and baked it. The curry flavor had mellowed and the dried fruits sweetened the dish. I used less bulgur (1.5 cups) and it seemed the right proportion of grain to fruit, etc. I served it with a green salad and marinated carrots (the plate needed color!). This is an easy recipe that I'll definitely make again -- probably to stuff into squash (either summer or winter).

Yuck! (there are lots of dishes using bulgur that I like, but this dish was not good)
