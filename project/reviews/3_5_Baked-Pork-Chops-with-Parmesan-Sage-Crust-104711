Verry average recipe.

This recipe turned out amazing. The pork chops were very juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. I made this for my friend who is very particular about food and isn't afraid to complain and he absolutely loved it. I used a cast iron skillet that was preheated until the handle was too hot to touch, and cooked on medium high (more towards medium) for 3 minutes per side. It only took 10 minutes in the oven to reach 170 degrees - I have a wireless digital thermometer to keep me informed which I was glad I used because leaving it in for 20 minutes would have been disastrous. I was concerned about some people having issues with the coating being soggy, so instead of fresh breadcrumbs I crushed up some Stove Top stuffing in a ziploc bag and a rolling pin. I think the important thing is to get the skillet really hot before putting the chops in. Skip the olive oil because it isn't meant to be heated like that and will just burn with nasty smoke.

I had high hopes for this recipe based on the reviews. Unfortunately, the entire family hated it. I followed the instructions and recipe exactly and the crust was completely soggy, no crunch at all. The flavor was ok, but I could not get past the soggy crust. I've been told by my family "do not make this ever again".

Made this last night. Not sure what "rubbbed sage" is so I used sage that I had dried, no lemon peel because hubby does not like lemon very much, and boneless pork chops as that is what I had. With those minor adjustments, this was very good. The boneless pork chops came out very moist and flavorful. This recipe could be tweaked to make it whatever you want depending on the spices you use. Will make again as a regular part of our weeknight rotation.

Not fabulous at all. I ended up adapting this to another recipe: egg whites whipped with a little water, seasoned flour, and then bread crumbs (minus that much cheese -- your choice). Rub pork with cut garlic clove, then dredge in flour, then egg whites, then breadcrumbs. Brown in butter + olive oil (your ratio), and place in baking pan. Add chopped onion to browning pan, saute until soft, add chopped garlic until fragrant, then add about 1 cup of wine + bay leaf. Reduce. Pour mixture over pork chops, cover tightly with foil and bake @ 20 - 30 minutes until done. Yum.

A few days ago when I saw that 369 reviewers had responded to this recipe; that it was 3-1/2 fork rated; and that 90% would make it again, I HAD to try it with the ingredients I had on hand. (Never did look at any of the reviews.) When I made this last night, first I halved the recipe to make 2 servings. Then subbed plain canned for the fresh French bread- crumbs, used abt. 1 tsp. green canned Parm for the fresh grated cheese, and 1/4 tsp. of each dried sage and jarred dried orange zest. To this mixture I added a sprinkle of each dried basil and oregano. Used one 9-1/2 oz. (1 inch thick) B/L sirloin pork loin chop from W?M. Followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Used an antiquated 8-inch cast-iron skillet (covered it for the 1st 10 minutes in the oven, and then uncovered it for the last 10 minutes. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS

In this recipe, I didn't use: "1 tablespoon dried rubbed sage "1 teaspoon grated lemon peel I instead used: "1 tablespoon of Mrs. Dash's garlic and herb seasoning. Everyone LOVED these porkchops, including 3 kids (13,10, 8). Delicious.

I make this pork all the time. It turns out perfect no matter what kind of pork (boneless or bone-in). It is one of my husbands favorite pork recipes.

This was a yummy recipe! probably didn't need a full 20 minutes in the oven with just two chops. Used the cast iron skillet and that was the perfect use. Used dried sage, lemon peel, herbs de provence and panko bread crumbs, only one egg. Fixed it with Risotto Alla Milanese (in chicken stock with onion) -- search epicurious.com -- and some broccolini in chicken broth. The risotto needed a little more time than the chops in the oven. Used 1C of rice and about 3 - 3.5 cups of chicken stock. HAVE to add a small amount of saffron! mmmmm.

Very flavorful. I marinated the chops in milk and salt beforehand so they were extra juicy. I also coated the chops 3 hours ahead of time and stored them on a cooling rack with the cooking sheet underneath in the fridge. Lemon wedges help cut the fat from the butter and the chops themselves. We served it with a salad of apples and blue cheese and butternut squash puree.

This is a favorite in my family, kids and all. Browning in a cast iron skillet seems to work best for us, then finishing in the oven. YUM.

Chops came out tender and moist, using panko and parmagiano-reggiano cheese. Only one egg was required. Didn't really care for the lemon taste. This made quite a mess (with three dishes needed just to coat the chop, a sautee pan and its splatters on the stove, and finally an oven proof dish) for just an OK entree.

Rating: 4
Very, very good. Did not have sage or lemon so I substituted with marjoram. Still, very good. Ours were boneless, thick cut chops - about 1 1/2 in. Turned half way through the cooking process to get that nice browned crust on both sides. The chops stayed very moist. Even my two-year-old loved this recipe. Will definitely make again when I have sage and lemon.

Really delicious and easy to make. I substituted lemon pepper because I was out of lemon peel and it still came out great. Served it with creamy corn polenta and green beans.

This has been a favorite of ours since it was first posted on Epicurious, and I call it Pork Chops Milanese when we serve it. My excellent butcher sources his pork from a small farm with humane, all natural practices, and Frenches the chops for me. Sorry, but using boneless cuts just robs one of so much flavor - the tenderest meat is that closest to the bone. I wouldn't think of skipping the step of sauteeing before popping into the oven. I use a 50/50 mix of truffle oil and butter for the saute. In the crust mixture, Romano or Parmesan, whatever is on hand, with panko crumbs. Additional herbs add more depth of flavor - herbes de Provence, fresh rosemary, thyme. You can't go wrong improvising this. Final and best touch, a lemon wedge squeezed over the finished dish. Better than the Pork chop Milanese at our favorite Italian restaurant. We enjoy it just for a weeknight dinner, but certainly company-worthy.

This recipe was easy and delicious! Used boneless center cut chops and served with sweet potato gnocchi with brown butter sage sauce,salad and a nice Pinot Grigio. Yummmm! NOTE: I had the gnocchi in the freezer--so the whole meal took less than an hour from the time I got home from work to sitting down at the table to eat!

Rating: 3
A good recipe, browning in the pan really makes the recipe, I don't recommend skipping that step but could probably use less butter to save on fat. I used boneless center cut and reduced oven time to 15 min. Didn't need as much of the crumb mixture will adjust for next time. served with roasted sweet potato "fries" and broccoli.

This recipe is so flavourful. I DO think that the browning is key...it seals in the moisture to make delicious moist chops

This got two thumbs WAT UPfrom the whole family even finiky 8-year-old who only likes pigs in a blanket! To decomplicate it some, I ditched the browinging in a skillet step and just placed them all in a baking dish and put them straight into the oven. They baked reletively quickly and I did turn the pan once during baking to help even out the browning. They came out without sticking and were tender and moist. Served with lemon/mint sugarsnaps, broiled tomoatos, and asparagus risotto. Primo.

A very delicious pork dish, simple but an one inch thick chop in my opinion is not thick enough. This was a great dish for me and my family. Not to rich on the sage side but just enough to give a sweet mild taste. To give this dish a little more of kick; I made a little sauce with white wine, garlic, the au jus from the pork and a touch of cream with a hint of sage and corriander. Bellissimo!!!

Completely bland. On the plus side, this recipe was easy to prepare and the pork chops were quite moist. However, you could not taste either the sage or the lemon. I did squeeze a lemon wedge over it and that helped. Overall, pretty pedestrian.

This was so yummy! After reading the reviews, I used panko crumbs, more lemon and also fresh sage rather than dry. And, I brined the chops...always do that and they are so much more tender and juicy. This was definitely 2 thumbs up and worthy of company.

Excellent flavor, quick to prepare! I used panko breadcrumbs and this dish turned out fantastic. Please note that the recipe calls for generously seasoned flour, this was necessary to enhance the sage and lemon peel. I sauteed red potatoes & apples with garlic, sage, lemon peel, utter and walnut oil in the pan then returned the chops on top of it and baked in the oven as per the recipe. It was incredible and my husband loved it.

We all enjoyed this dish very much. My seven year old gave it two enthusiastic thumbs up and my husband said he couldn't imagine anyone not liking it. I prepared the recipe as written (except I used boneless pork loin chops), using the freshest and finest ingredients available. I cut the ingredients in half since I only used three 1-1/4" chops...had PLENTY of the crumb mixture to coat. (Just couldn't stand the thought of throwing away a lot of leftover crumb topping with the wonderful Parm/Regg. in it)...I did BRINE my chops first in a solution of 3 cups cold water, 1/4 cup kosher salt, 1/4 cup sugar...they were succulent.

Delicious. I made it as written with the following minor changes: doubled the lemon peel, about 1/4 cup of minced fresh sage instead of dried, panko bread crumbs. It was excellent and not too sage-y at all. Fresh lemon juice squeezed on the finished chops tastes great.

For all those that have said that the recipe is bland, using choice ingredients is the key to making this dish flavorful. Using parmigiano reggiano instead of regular generic parmesan cheese, using fresh rubbed sage and using fresh bread crumbs are key to make this taste wonderful.

Except for the fact that I followed others suggestions to cut down on the breadcrumbs but leave the other ingredients as is for more flavor, this was bland, tasteless, and a waste of good ingredients. Certainly moist and tender, but other than that a true disappointment.

Panko crumbs, fresh sage, a tad more lemon zest for our tastes & it was a winner. Perfect with pasta. As for those who say it was bland, not strong flavor---get out your bottle of hot sauce & let 'er rip. The crust texture is wonderful. Easy and great for company with fancy sides.

I was looking for a fresh, springtime alternative to my stuffed pork chops recipe. Followed this recipe, but used panko for a crisp outside. Couldn't be simpler. And the results were good and satisfying; but in the end, it's nothing to write home about. This really isn't a far cry from shake-n-bake with some more seasoning. Quick, simple, tasty, but not at all the epicurean delight it sounds like.

The best pork chops on the planet! We tried this recipe as written and liked it. I then used boneless, thin chops and pan-fried them to doneness instead of browning and baking them. My 5-year-old son ate 2. They tasted like veal cutlets. I once served it in this manner with speotzel and you would swear it was weinerschintzel.

I give it 5 forks! This is the best, moist, tender, flavorful pork chop I've ever made. It is important to use fresh bread crumbs, it doesn't matter what type of bread. Fresh sage is better than dried any day. I say the more lemon the better. I increased the lemon zest and liberally squeezed lemon juice on the finished chops. I used all of the bread mixture because I sprinkled what was left after breading on the chops before baking. It really helps bring out the fresh parmesan flavor. This is so quick, easy, and delicious I will be making these chops over and over.

This was very tasty but not as unique as its name makes it sound. The coating sealed in the juices of the meat nicely, and the lemon zest added a note of complexity to the mix. The overall effect, though, was a solid Southern-style pork chop, which my husband loved but not really a "wow" for me. Use high-quality freshly grated Parmesan (like parmesano reggiano) for the most flavor.

I'm not a fan of pork chops because they always seem to end up dry and tough. As a consequence, I'm constantly trying out new recipes. I followed this one exactly - except for adding a lot more sage. This is THE BEST recipe I've ever tried - the chops were flavorful and tender - THE BEST pork chops I've ever made - and very easy too! This is a definite keeper!

Rating: 3
To really cut prep time in half, I substitue panko for the fresh bread crumbs. It makes for a crispier chop, and eliminates the need to dirty up the food processor. As many have noted, you can easily get away with cutting the crust recipe in half. It will make just enough to coat four large pork chops. I also love the bright note fresh lemon zest adds to the dish, so don't leave it out if at all possible.

Rating: 3
This was easy and tasty; I served it with spaghetti with marinara sauce and a green salad, and it was a big hit. To ease clean-up, I transfered the browned chops from the pan to a rimmed foil-covered cookie sheet to continue cooking in the oven. I didn't have french bread, so I made the crumbs out of white bread, which worked just fine. As others have noted, though, the recipe makes a lot more crumb and cheese mixture than you will need. I don't mind wasting bread crumbs, but I get a bit put out over wasting $18 per pound parmesan. I didn't have any lemon zest, so I left it out, which was fine.

Rating: 3
I really liked this recipe too, and I didn't even make it exactly as the recipe stated. Instead of sage, I used fresh rosemary, and I used Panko breadcrumbs instead of french bread. I forgot the lemon peel too, next time I'll remember. Even though I probably cooked them longer than I should have they were still tender and juicy, a definite keeper!

We love this recipe. I like more cheese flavor, so I use more cheese and no breadcrumbs. I put in some cornstarch so the mixture sticks to the chops. I also brown for approx. 4 minutes per side and cook for 10-15 minutes. 10 minutes dried mine out.

I am blossoming from a food heater-upper to a full blown cook with easy successful recipes like this one. So far it is the best thing I have managed to make, and I already had all the ingredients around the house minus the lemon. I used orange peel from a jar, not even fresh, and it came out great. I halved the crumbs (cooking only for two), but I needed both eggs for the double coat as recommended by other reviewers. I used really thin boneless pork chops, and cut the cooking time to 10 min. Very moist, I'm glad I didn't try the brine. I was scared by it and didn't want to ruin dinner without any alternative. Please give this recipe a try.

This recipe gets four forks from me because it easily turns household staples into delectably moist and flavorful pork chops. Serving with lemon slices for squeezing over the top added to the great flavor. I followed others' suggestions-- only made half the crumb mixture (but kept the sage and lemon zest at their original amounts). It was the perfect amount for four, large bone-in chops even though I double-coated the pork chops (flour, eggs, crumbs, egg, crumbs - needed an extra egg). I seared them on a large all-clad griddle that I could place in the oven. It worked great. I didn't have any trouble with the crust falling off - probably because I was liberal with the oil/butter for searing. I did loosely cover the pork with aluminum foil because I was afrid they'd get too dry... but they came out perfectly. The dryness others experienced may be due to the use of boneless chops. The bone and the extra fat around it always adds more flavor and moisture. My husband who is usually very picky when it comes to carefully trimming ALL the fat away, picked up his chop and ate with abandon! Another reason for 4 forks!

WOW!!!! Rarely do I wish the site offered 5 forks. The recipe is simple and yummy and easy and elegant and a winner all the way around. To keep the chops from getting dry pull them out of the oven five minutes prior to being done and let them continue to "cook" on a warm plate. I do this as I'm putting the finishing touches of the side dish. I usually pair it with saute'd escarole or baby spinach. I have had dinner company ask me to make it the next itme they come over. I make extra breading, pop it in the freezer and use it on boneless/skinless chicken breasts for an easy and tasty dinner for just us.

I make this recipe all the time and we LOVE it. The trick is to rinse and thoroughly DRY the chops before dregding them in flour (yes they will stick to the flour, but just a dusting) then in the egg batter and then the breadcrumb-cheese mixture. Make sure the oil is hot before dropping the chop in the pan. Don't brown them too dark, just to a golden color. The oven will do the rest of the cooking for you. Even with the thickest chops a 400 degree oven will finish them off in about 20 to 25 minutes. And they will be tender. Actually, this has become the only way I will cook chops now, as my husband loves the thick ones and they are so difficult to cook through on the grill. It's a winner!

Rating: 3
I put mine in the oven for 17 minutes and I think that was a little too long for me. My chops were a little over an inch thick and they were pretty dry. Next time I make them I will check them after 12 minutes. Perhaps I seared them longer than most. All in all this recipe was very good. My husband isn't a big pork chop kind of guy and he loved them (even though they were dry)

I've been searching for a great baked pork chop recipe and believe I've found it with this one. Although I didn't have time to brine the chop as others have suggested due to lack of time, I have brined food before and do believe it adds a great deal of moisture. Regarding this recipe, I made it exactly as instructed and thought it was delicious! I had no problem with the crust falling off and the chops were very moist even without brining. I'll definitely make this again.

This was a very nice pork chop dish. I followed the recommendation from the reviewer from Providence. I brined them using her recipe, for 2 hours. They turned out moist and very tasty. It got a 'yummy' from my husband. I will be serving this recipe again.

Popular with the family. I had the same problem other reviewers noted: the crust tends to fall off the chops unless you pat more on during the browning period. Also, the heat needed to brown the chops and retain the crumbs is very close to what some might regard as burned. (Mine turned out quite brown, but still presentable.) I used fresh sage; it has a very different flavor from the dry boxed stuff that doesn't do justice.

Rating: 4
I absolutely loved this recipe. The key to pork chops (I think) is brining them prior to baking or grilling. With a very concentrated brine - approx. 1/2 cups of salt and two T. sugar to 2 quarts of water - you only need to let them soak in the fridge for 1 or 2 hours prior to cooking. The trick is to dry them THOROUGHLY before breading them. Delicious!

I cook for 200 people every Wednesday night at my church. I searched epicurious for a different pork recipe and found this one. I hesitated to try it because of the thought of browning that many pork chops; however, it was worth it! Obviously, I had to make some changes to the recipe working with such a large volume, but it worked out great. I did brine the pork chops first, and they were very moist and tender. I transfered them to baking trays to finish them in the oven, and they turned out perfectly! I received rave reviews from everyone that night, and I had lots of requests for the recipe! It was well worth the effort, and I will definitely make it again both at church and at home.

I was very excited to try this dish based on all the wonderful comments about it. I used 4 very high quality, large tenderloin cuts and they would've turned out delicious I'm sure; however, due to the overwhelming saltiness from the recommended brine soak, they were nearly ruined. I regret that I subjected my chops to this. I will try this recipe again, but will omit the salt bath or totally revise the recommended proportions. yuk. The pre-soak may have kept the tenderness, but it ruined the final product taste. Too bad.

Unbelievably moist and delicious! I hate when people rate recipes when they change things, but I think my changes were pretty minor. I substituted Panko breadcrumbs for the regular, as I prefer the lighter breading. I also didn't have any fresh sage on hand, so I left it out. These chops were the most moist I've ever had. A cast iron skillet is key, as it heats evenly. A keeper!

Very easy, great pork chop recipe. Used the big ones from Costco - about 1 1/2 inches thick. Didn't have lemon, but turned out great all the same. Used 20 minutes at 425 anyway, and the chops were quite moist (I think everyone overcooks pork chops anyway) - not undone, but not overdone as is so often the case. Good stuff.

Delicious!!! I used more lemon peel to give it a more lemony flavor and it was exactly what I was looking for. It seems the crumbs were enough to cover 1000 chops so unless you're cooking 30 chops I would suggest a smaller amount when making the breading mix.

This has been my favorite way of doing pork chops indoors (when not grilling) since the recipe was first posted in 2001 and I gave it four stars back then. I've used Pastene Italian breadcrumbs quite often, with great results. Romano, Parmesan, or Asiago cheese - all equally good. But last night I did these using Panko breadcrumbs and oh my...the crunchiness and lightness of the crust was the best ever; the double-thick chops moist and juicy as always. As others have stated, be sure to use a preheated cast-iron pan, and don't omit the lemon wedge for an added touch to the finished dish. In fact, go heavier on the lemon zest in your breadcrumb mixture. This recipe also works nicely with chicken, both on or off the bone. We serve with a vinaigrette salad and a sauteed green vegetable, such as green beans with shallots and mushrooms - for the carb-watchers, very satisfying even without an additional starch.

This was so incredibly simple and good that I could easily whip this up after work on a weeknight. I took the advice of other reviewers and soaked the chops in a brine of H2O, kosher salt and sugar for an hour, and used a hot cast iron skillet and the crumbs adhered to the chops beautifully. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and braised green beans. However, I would make one change: I used 2 bone-in thick chops from my local butcher as the recipe calls for, and because of the all-over crust, it was hard to tell where the bone was and therefore a bit clumsy to eat. Next time, I will use thick boneless chops instead.

This Recipe is an easy WOW. I make it anytime I need to impress, am short on time, and need to be entertaining while I cook. The crust is out of this world. I served with warmed applesauce, sugar snap peas and roasted potatoes.

I've made this several times and each time we like it even more; it's now our family's favorite pork chop recipe. I double the ammout of sage and lemon, use a dense Italian bread for the crumbs and with a very hot cast iron skillet have no trouble with the breading falling off. I think it's important to brine the chops before; (1/4 cup plus 2 T Morton Kosher Salt and 1/2 cup sugar dissolved iin 1 quart cold water - add the chops and refrigerate for one hour) they are always very tender and juicy. This last time I made them I served them with the Red Cabbage and Warm Spinach Salad on this site - a winning combination!

This was a great recipe, especially since it was super-easy. I didn't have any parmesan, so I used what I had thought was a hard cheese -- until I grated it! Turns out it was a Comte de Gruyere, more flavorful than any French Gruyere I've had. The cheese melted with the bread crumbs to form the most wonderful crust. The cooking time seemed just right. I suspect the fact that I did use freshly made breadcrumbs made a big difference -- and I bought a higher quality chop at Whole Foods.

Rating: 3
Fast and pretty good - a keeper. A few suggestions to avoid crust coming off: 1) Dry the chops first, 2) Shake off all excess flour, 3) Let all excess egg drip off, 4) Press the breadcrumbs on then let sit 3-4mins before cooking, 5) Don't peek while browning. Follow these with this (or any recipe) and you won't have a problem. I also sprinkled with some fresh chopped sage after browning/before baking and it looked rather nice. Also squeezed on some fresh lemon juice after baking, I think it works better than adding zest to the breadcrumbs.

Just an fyi to the cook from Indianapolis... it says melt the butter with the oil.

Easy, fast and great! Not sure where the olive oil comes into play since the recipe does not mention when to use it (maybe mix with the butter?)...so I omitted it. Used italian seasoned bread crumbs which gave it full flavor. Definitely would make again!

Yum! A quick, moist and delicious recipe for pork chops. (And you probably have most of the ingredients in your pantry already.) I have used both bone-in and boneless pork chops and they both tasted terrific. The breadcrumb/cheese mixture locks in the moistness. I have made this a few times and highly recommend it.

Rating: 4
This was a great dish, even with all of my substitutions. I used Italian bread and Romano cheese, ground sage and pork loin cutlets. I just realized I completely forgot the olive oil. Nevertheless, it was delicious. I had no problem with the crust coming off, as others mentioned. I did get the pan good and hot as recommended. Just a thought, perhaps they didn't cut the crust off the bread before making their bread crumbs? Also, I don't have an oven-proof skillet, so I preheated a glass dish with additional butter and transferred the pork to it to bake.

Rating: 3
This was an excellent pork chop receipe. I agree that one of the keys to keep the breading on is to have the pan very hot. I preheated my cast iron skillet for several minutes, then turned down the heat and added the butter and oil. I had no problem with sticking. I did double batter as suggested.

Rating: 3
I've made this a few times and I think one of the keys to not having your crust come off is to be sure that the butter/oil blend is hot enough to really sear the crust and chops when you first add them to the pan. Turn the meat very gently with tongs and you shouldn't have a problem. I've tried fresh breadcrumbs and panko, and the panko adhered better (and was much crisper). I also prefer boneless chops. Double the amount of sage and up the lemon zest slightly. This is a terrific weeknight dish - I serve it with roasted sweet potatoes and wild rice.

i used boneless chops and they were great! good weeknight meal- more interesting than the usual pork recipes. my crust came off a little in the pan, but i placed the pieces on top of the pork in the oven and it worked fine. i got compliments on the lemon taste and the juiciness of the meat.

This recipe is awesome. Be sure not to omit the lemon, it adds a nice kick to the meat. Make for friends - they'll love it.

Nice simple recipe, and reliably good. I use it all the time and everyone always loves it. It's key to start with high-quality meat -- I always get boneless chops from a small neighborhood market. I omit the lemon zest though, and don't even bother to measure the breading ingredients -- just put as much as looks right. And whoever came up with the double-breading idea is pure genious. Enjoy!

Rating: 3
I'm not a great fan of pork chops and recipes always seem limited to applesauce or something. I used 2" think chops w/ no bone. I freshly grated parmesan and zest of orange and chopped fresh sage and used panko instead of bread crumbs. I loved the brown melted cheesy crust! Try it!

Rating: 2
the breading is nice but not memorable and I increased the amount of sage and cheese. I also found that the pork was still tough. This recipe is not as quick as it looks - making fresh breadcrumbs and dipping the meat three times is moderately time consuming. unfortunately, it wasnt worth the effort. Will have to pass on this one.

I was pressed for time but wanted to make my chops tasty so I tried this. It was great..crispy on the outside and nice and moist on the inside. I used 1-inch thick rib chops and didn't use the lemon zest only because I didn't have any on hand. Still was very good. Next time I will use the lemon. My grown son who had popped in unexpectedly for dinner really raved about them. I will make this again definitely!

Very nice, simple dinner fare. I too only made half the breadcrumb mixture (no need to use more of that expensive parmesan cheese than necessary) and it made enough to generously coat 4 chops. I cooked this in my trusty All-Clad non-stick frypan had no trouble with sticking. Served with the accompanying sweet potato recipe, but in the future I would make this with a less greasy side dish (like a baked potato, or a rice pilaf). The fried chops did not pair well with the butter soaked yams, in my opinion. But we loved the flavor of the pork. The lemon rind really adds a spark of freshness.

What an interesting way to bake pork chops, right in the skillet. Very easy to make and no comparison to Shake and Bake!

Just as good as it sounds and looks in the picture. My skillet isn't safe in the oven at this temperature, so I browned them in the pan then transferred them to a glass baking dish for the oven part and that worked out fine. The crust is flavorful and crunchy and stays in place! Usually they don't. And the pork chops turn out really juicy. I went ahead and made breadcrumbs out of a whole baguette, which is way more than you need for the recipe. But I froze the extra in a ziplock bag, so the next time I made this, it took way less time. Very tasty!

This is a fantastic recipe. I can't imagine anyone thinking it is bland!! I used a sour dough dinner roll for the breadcrumbs, dried lemon peel (out of a jar), and boneless pork chops because that's what I had on hand. Also used dried sage. My husband and I (self-proclaimed culianry critics!) loved it - very moist and flavorful. Occasionally recipes from all these rave reviews end up being a disappointment but not this time. I served the chops with an Caramelized Onion & Apple recipe and Cider-Glazed Sweet Potatoes with Cranberries BA 11/1999.

FINALLY, A PORK CHOP THAT'S NOT TOUGH AND DRY! HOMEMADE BREADCRUMBS IMPORTANT...THE UNEVEN TEXTURE WORKS. I DIDN'T STRIP THE FRENCH LOAF OF CRUST AND IT WAS FINE.

I ALSO SUGGEST REMOVING CHOPS FROM DUTCH OVEN AFTER BAKING AND DEGLAZING WITH WHITE WINE AND CREAMS FOR A YUMMY SAUCE TO DRIZZLE OVER...YUMMY!

I didn't have French bread so I used crumbled English Muffin. Dried sage works fine, but I think freshly grated Parmesan is a must; and absolutely use more than 1 tsp grated lemon peel.

The English Muffin worked so well the first time I used it the second time as well. Simple and rewarding.

We have tried various alterations to the recipe. Recently, we used regular canned breadcrumbs and rubbed sage. The coating remained on the meat perfectly.

I followed the directions exactly and my pork chops came out dry. The sage kind of got lost in everything else. Maybe if I'd used fresh sage like some other reviewers it would have been better.

My wife and I LOVE this dish. It is easy to make and tastes great! I will have to agree with others that this recipe is at its best if used with fresh breadcrumbs (so simply with a mini prep), freshly grated parmesan, and freshly chopped sage. The natural flavors of this recipe show that with good ingredients, you don't need to spend hours in the kitchen to make a good meal. For those out there that wish to try this recipe, I highly suggest that you only use day old bread, as moist bread makes the breading stick to the pan when cooking. Also, this recipe is just as yummy with boneless chicken breasts.

Fresh bread crumbs?? Why bother when there are so many great pre-packaged ones! I personally love Pepperidge Farms. Aged parmesan, again why bother-Chef Boyardee makes that great stuff you can just shake right out the can. And, puhleeze, why got to butcher for that kind of cut of meat. Sam's Club sells these great big boxes of porkchops. I just don't understand why Epicurious makes this recipes so needlessly time consuming and difficult! I made it my way and it was deelish!!

Loved it. Skipped the lemon peel as that can sometimes be overpowering. To make fresh breadcrumbs, cube the bread into 1 inch pieces or so and chop in processor. A $30 mini-prep works great for this and so many other things. I used ciabatta bread.

I used store bought Italian bread crumbs and it was delicious. Also added some fresh pressed garlic to the bread crumb mixture. I added extra parmesan cheese to the bread crumb mixture, and yes there was a lot of extra. I will either make less next time or freeze as suggested. The meat turned out juicy and moist. I served with a wedge of lemon. I made the Roasted Sweet Potatoes with Honey Glaze and the meal was a definite success. I'll definitely make it again.

This is wonderful, easy recipe that I've made many times since it was published. Its absolutely restaurant quality. I use store-bought dry breadcrumbs and leave out the lemon peel to make it faster and easier, and its still great. Halving the ingredients will give you enough crumbs for at least 6 chops. And you also don't need as much fat as called for--I use 1 T. butter and 2 T. olive oil. I use boneless center cut chops. The kids can't stop eating them.

The chops were very crisp on the outside, and very moist and tender inside.

I made this dish for company who weren't too excited about pork - until now. Everyone loved this dish, and it was easy to do, although making the fresh breadcrumbs was a bit of a pain. The flavor was terrific, the pork chops were moist, and they looked great. A few of my company even picked up the bones and nibbled on them to get the last morsels of meat. My tips: use an instant-read thermometer to make sure you don't overcook the pork (don't just rely on time). Also, ask the butcher to cut the pork exactly as stated in the recipe - they're happy to do it for you. Definitely a make-again dish, for company or just for family.

Don't do this recipe if you have boneLESS pork chops, as it'll come out too dry. O/w, delicious flavors, delicious crust on meat, beautiful presentation.

We made this last night and loved it. Following good advice of other reviewers, we doubled the sage and finely grated the cheese. Meat was very juicy and tasty!

A truely delicious recipe! My husband declared it the best pork chop he has ever eaten in his life. Simple and yummy. One word of advice: make sure to grate the parmesan to a fine grit - I have one of the new graters that shaves it instead of making the rough sawdust texture. Shaves don't adhere well to the meat. And follow other cooks advice and only bake the chops for 15 minutes. Yummm.....

These taste great, but the recipe calls for way too much bread crumbs. I was fixing them for two so I halved the recipe and still had enough left for 4 more porkchops. I also agree, the cooking time is too long. 15 minutes in the oven is plenty!

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe several times and it s always wonderful. But the key is using fresh breadcrumbs and freshly grated parmesean cheese. If you use dry breadcrumbs- which are much denser and heavier than fresh- the breadcrumb to parmesean ratio will be off and they won't be as flavorful. And fresh breadcrumbs are EASY. All you need is a food processor and a loaf! The lemon zest adds a lovely accent to the dish. The only thing I would adjust in this recipe is the cooking time- I found that 20 minutes was too long- and that 15 is much better. This crust is also FABULOUS with chicken breast- but make sure to cut the cooking time! Enjoy!

I have made this dish at least 5 times.It is delicious. I always make my own bread crumbs in a food processor using leftover french or italian bread.

This dish was quite easy to make, and the lemony flavor of the pork was surprisingly pleasant (I added the juice of one lemon to the meat before and during baking). I used store-bought bread crumbs, cut it to 1 cup instead of 1 1/2, and still had a lot leftover. My suggestion is to start with half cup breadcrumbs-cheese mixture, then add more as you need it. I also suggest marinading the pork first to give it more flavor; I used black pepper, thyme, and oregano. Salt will toughen the meat so I only add it in the flour mixture. Overall, this is a quick, easy, and yummy dish to make. I'll probably do a chicken version for the next dinner party.

I used pre-packaged bread crumbs as well as pre-grated fat free parmesan cheese and it still turned out really well. I coated the pork chops with the breadcrumb/sage/cheese mix both times instead of using flour the first time and it made a nice, thick crust. I also flipped the chops with tongs after 10 minutes of baking. They were done in 18 minutes and cooked very evenly. I squeezed the juice of 1 lemon over them both before baking and before serving and my husband, who usually hates lemon, commented that the lemon was a pleasant, subtle tough. If you have a quality piece of meat and a good non-stick skillet (I have scan-pans), this would be a nice dish for a casual "no fuss" dinner party.

Very very good. Had to use poultry seasoning (had thyme, pepper, and nutmeg in addition to sage) since I was out of sage and it worked out beautifully. Dried bread crumbs worked great. Also added garlic. It was herb heaven, the cheese and lemon gave the perfect zing. Lovely recipe and soo easy.

This is the first recipe that I have been truly let down. The frying of the chops then the baking made this dish extremely time consuming; and it did not taste as good as the time, dishes and cooking it took to make. I also agree with a fellow rater that if one is undecided upon making this dish-please skip this one, you'll be doing yourself a favour.

THis is my all time best "supper" recipe. I have made it at least ten times since reading the recipe in the magazine last year. It really is a relatively easy dish to make (maybe just because I can make it in my sleep now!). It is consistently good, I've never had a problem. A few tips - 1)make sure you get the best pork chops you can find, the recipe deserves it and the baking does require a good balance of fat, freshness and quality to sustain 2)make sure the pan you bake in is large enough for all the pork chops to fit in nicely, otherwise it will not cook evenly during the frying process 3)it works just as well with prepackaged prepared breadcrumbs (rather than making your own) and pregrated parmesan (rather than grating your own) if you are pressed for time or ingredients 4)the original magazine recipe offered an accompanying recipe for honey glazed yams - make that too,perfect together (also with spinach and chunky homemade applesauce).

Rating: 3
This recipe is wonderful. I used panko (Japanese bread crumbs) instead of regular, and cut the amount down to 3/4 cup. This really lets you taste and enjoy the Parmesan cheese and sage to its fullest. Be careful not to overcook it, I found that 16 minutes was better than the 20 listed. I also use the boneless chops, just personal preference.

I love this one! I use it all the time when we have company. I cheat though and use canned bread crumbs so I can spend more time with my guests. You can also brown the chops earlier in the day and put them back in the frige until you are ready to bake. I serve the chops with spinach and roasted potatoes.

Excellent recipe. I make this when the whole family is here because it's fast and uncomplicated, and it always gets rave reviews from my meat-loving children. I don't have time for fresh bread crumbs -the store bought kind are just fine. I use 8 pork chops instead of 4 in order to use up all the bread crumbs. I do suggest not skimping on the thickness of the chop. One inch is really necessary.

Rating: 2
I found this pretty run-of-the-mill. The parmesan doesn't have a pronounced flavor, and the sage added little to what essentially are glorified plain-breaded chops. It wasn't bad, but it also wasn't anything special - but certainly not worth grating up a cup of parmesan and all those homemade bread crumbs.

Rating: 3
I tried this on a week night & it was quick and easy. I added more parmesan cheese than the receipe called for & made the bread crumbs from french bread. The second time I made it, I used the prepared Italian bread crumbs & it came out even better. I even tried this with chicken & it was tasty too!!!

Even with some substitutions from the original recipe, this was a delicious dish--and easy. I used boneless center cut chops, Savory instead of Sage and lemon pepper instead of lemon peel. There was too much bread mixture for 4 chops. Next time I'll cut down on that. I'll make it again.

My husband and I had these pork chops last night and they were fabulous! Just like the other people said, it was juicy, easy to make, too!

I made half the breading and still had plenty left over for another dish. I increased the proportion of parmesan and it may have been a little salty. I also added extra lemon peel and that was a nice flavor. The chops were juicy and my wife really complimented the recipe. I used the left over breading to make the same recipe with red snapper. In the pan just long enough to get golden and in the oven for about 7 minutes at 400. Good, but didn't compare to the chops.

To me this recipe is a nice update on a classic family dinner dish. It is not a meal that I would make to impress company but it is recipe my family enjoys. The pork chops stay pretty moist and the breading has a nice subtle flavor To me,it is a great no brainer recipe to make after work.

The pork chops were moist and seasoning was good but this will not get categorized as a favorite. It was lacking a nice sauce that would have helped to enhanced the flavors. If you are looking for a really good pork chop recipe try the Pork Chops with Rosemary-Vinegar Sauce. Now that is a great recipe.

Loved this! My husband said "quite possibly the best pork chops I've ever had!" (He ate three large chops!!!) I substitued italian (prepared) bread crumbs and prepared (Shredded) parmesean cheese and it was still delicious. However, it made MUCH more breading than needed for 4 chops. I only used half the breading and saved the rest (prior to breading the chops) for another time.

As the ratings state: liked it, but didn't love it. Judging from the ingredients, I was expecting great things from the crust, but it just didn't "Wow" me. I cut the breadcrumbs in half as suggested. Used franchese bread. Fresh sage from my garden, and freshly grated lemon peel and parmesan. I think part of the problem was that the boneless pork chops that I used were too lean, not enough marbling. They were juicy, just not tender. Might possibly try again with the center cut pork loin chops, but not anytime soon.

This is my second time making this dish. I am brining the chops in a beer/cider brine. Instead of regular bread crumbs, I'm coating the chops in Panko, which browns beautifully and gives it a nice crispy finish.

This was just delicious. For those who claim it was boring, try using ground sage-2.5 tspns instead of the tblspn of dried. All I had was ground sage and these chops were the opposite of bland. I used sour dough for the bread crumbs, and that combined with the lemon made for a noticable and very pleasant tang. Try this one!

I don't undersatnd all the people talking about whether the chops are juicy or not. Searing and then baking is one way to keep them juicy but as with any way of cooking, you have to experiment and get it just right. If yours were dry, it's not the recipe, it's how much attention you are giving to the chops. Any leftover breadcrumbs go right into the freezer. Tonight we made three chops with two bathes of leftover crumbs. Still delicious.

Chops are bland in general.

Very good. Don't understand how other people found this dish "bland". Helpful advise - make sure you use real Parmesano Reggiano and grate right before you need it. Also, I used 2 tablespoons fresh sage and one garlic clove minced which added a big flavor boost. Like most people, I used about half the breadcrumbs. I kept some of the breadcrumb mixture in a separate dish if I needed extra, this way you are not wasting it after the breading process is complete and can use the mixture for another recipe. Salt and pepper also help. Happy to make it again.

Good recipe, husband, who does not like chops, loved this one. Even at 20 mins though, I thought they were "dry". Perhaps I browned them too long. Anyway was great with twice-baked cheese and garlic potatoes and asparagus. Strange, I only did three large chops, and cut down breading, but could hardly recognize the sage (I bought new spices so it wasnt that). Will make again!

We love the recipe, like others I do add garlic powder to the crumb mixture and make sure that your sage is not old, sometimes that stuff sits around a little to long in our spice cupboards and loses any flavor that it had. I do not bake the chops. I use a Calphalon non-stick skillet and cook the chops over very low heat until they are well crusted and done. I found the oven to be a step to far. We have made these several times and have never been disappointed. Teh sweet potatoes that accompany the dish were great and so were the greens. It is a household favorite and we'll make it again and again.

I too cut down on the bread crumbs, and it came out just fine. I find all of these crispy recipes benefit from cooking in a cast iron skillet, they really crisp up and do not stick. I also think it makes a difference whether the oven is fueled by gas or electric. Electic is a drier heat, making things crispier, and gas is more moist. Also, every once in a while it is good to test if the oven is heating to the right emp, as they can get off the temp for which they are set.

Why is the "i love you kitten" review on every recipe here on Constant Comment, with a different city attached to the writer? It is thoroughly annoying to log on and hope to see real reviews, and to find this gibberish instead, so please cut it out. To the person who asked about brining: see Gourmet's Grilled Spiced Double Thick Pork Chops (Sept. 1998) or Bon Appetit's Brined Pork Chops with Apples (Sept. 1999) for details on how to brine pork chops correctly.

To Cook from Toronto: sweet potatoes can be cooked at pretty much any temp you want though they actually carmelize better at higher temps. I am lazy in the kitchen when possible, so I just put the pan in the oven with a small amount of butter to melt while oven is pre-heating, then add peeled, diced sweet potatoes, drizzle honey/lemon over, stir well and pop in the oven, turning occasionally till done. choose the temp for the main dish, they will be fine, just keep an eye on them.

Really yummy recipe... I didn't have the lemon and just used wheat sandwich bread for the crumbs, and it was still really good. The crumb mixture can be cut way down.

I'm usually not a fan of pork chops (compared to pork tenderloin), but I found this recipe very simple and quite delicious.

I made this recipe for family guests twice and they asked for the recipe. Both times, I added garlic powder to the breading mixture. I could not imagine any form of pork without some garlic. I truly believe it made a difference in the flavor. I also bought fresh sage, dried it in the microwave, then crushed it. Using thick 1" or 1-1/4" chops, it took more time than the recipe calls for me to brown the chops on both sides. I also baked them for longer than 20 min. -- more like 35 or 40. I reduced the oven temp a bit after 20 min. They were tender, juicy and a nicely browned.

And, we cut the bread crumbs in half and still had way too much - what a waste of good parmesian.

These were OK, I wasn't crazy about them, but they were good for a weeknight dinner. I mainly wanted to try them and see what all the excitement was about. I could barely taste the sage, so next time I would add more (I only had the ground kind). I halved the breadcrumb mixture, and still had a lot leftover. Used a cast iron pan too, and parboiled some potatoes and then added them to the pan drizzling some of the drippings from chops over them while they roasted. The chops came out tender and moist.

i made this recipe yesterday. i agree that there was too much breading. left some out and still had breading left. i used fresh sage, but did not taste it all that much. i pan fried it and put it in a 350 oven. the chops were not too crispy, but very tender and flavorful and not dry. i could not let the leftover juices go to waste, so i removed the chops from the frying pan and made a sauce by adding garlic, white wine and lemon juice to the skillet. reduce, swirl in some butter and serve with the chops. delicious.

I'm a single dad raising five kids, and it is really hard to find good recipes that everyone likes. This one was a universal hit! The kids loved it, and so did I. It was crunchy on the outside, tender and juicy inside.

I think this recipe is going to make its way into our weekly menu.

I made a few modifications to this recipe that worked out very well. Instead of the plain bread crumbs, I borrowed the idea of using crushed croutons so the crust became quite crispy when it was browned.

The recipe is very quick and easy so in my opinion it is a winner all around. I will make this again...and again...and again! I hope you will try it also.

These are so delicious -- they've become an instant hit in my family. And they're quick, too. Get rave reviews every time I make them.

I halved the breadcrumbs and parmesan by instinct it just seemed like too much. In lieu of the breadcrums I used Panko and added some of Emeril's essence to the mixture - super! Next time I will try brinning the pork that sounds pretty good.

I made half this recipe last night (just divided, so no real changes made). I agree with prior reviewers that there is too much of the bread crumb mixture. (I did re-dip my chops into the egg and coat a second time.) Mine were a little salty, but that's due to my oversalting the flour, I presume. (Does anyone have a "rule of thumb" about salt to flour ratio for this kind of thing?) Other than that, they were very good. I browned them in my cast iron skillet, and popped the whole thing into the oven. I was then free to prepare the rest of dinner. No problems with the coating coming off, either. I'll make this again.

All I can say is WOW! I made it for a dinner party and it was the topic of the evening. Everyone agreed it was great.

This dish was great! I used boneless pork chops and browned them in a pan and then baked them. I didn't have any problems with the breading coming off in the pan. I will definately make again!

When I made this, I found that you really didn't need to cook the full time indicated in the oven - maybe that is conditional on the thickness of your chops? Anyway, we loved it; I recommended the recipe to my mother, and she has fixed it - to rave reviews - several times. The parmesan crust seems to seal in the juices, making it so tender. This is so easy, so quick, and so tasty! Be sure to try it.

I was careful not to overcook these, but they were still a bit dry. Perhaps this is because I trimmed all the visible fat from the chops before coating them. Next time I make them, I am going to add some sort of sauce to the finished product, perhaps a fresh tomato and herb sauce. In any event, I found that the amount of bread crumbs and grated parmesan called for in the recipe was at least twice, if not three times, what I needed to coat four large, thick chops. Next time I will cut back considerably, so as not to waste precious parmesan.

I fixed these chops on Wednesday night and they were so good I fixed them again on Thursday night.

The chops had a good taste, but I wasn't very pleased with the appearance. The next time I make them I will use less oil and transfer the chops to a casserole dish to finish them off in the oven. Also, I cannot seem to find rubbed sage anywhere. Any ideas? I've even searched the web with no luck.

I'd rate this at 2.8 forks- just outside of "delicious". Read the other reviews, use the brine and hammer them up a bit with a meat mallet. I did one in the brine and one with out. The brine helped a lot. The meat had a better flavor and was much more tender.

I'm not a huge fan of pork chops, so I made this with chicken breasts instead. It was definitely good...the whole family enjoyed them. Very tender.

Made this mid-week for the kids and, although the chops were a little big for them, they really liked the flavor. Thought it tasted like fried chicken! My husband and I,however, thought it tasted just like delicious pork chops... They turned out very moist and pretty to look at, too.

I also thought this recipe was excellent and so did my husband who only likes pork chops "the way his mother makes them". I had too much breadcrumb mixture as well and dipped my pork chops in the egg batter a second time along with a second coating of breadcrumb mixture to use up the excess. I still had to throw a lot out even with this additional coating. I will also try skipping the pan frying step next time and just baking them on a broiler pan as one reviewer suggested.

This was great and fairly easy! I used some orange peel instead of lemon peel (because I didn't have lemon peel) and then used some McCormick Monetery Style grilling spices along with the bread crumbs, sage, parmesan, etc. I had WAY too much of the bread crumb mixture. And the crust was borderline burned on the bottom even though I used butter to brown, but it was still very tastey! My friend loved it!

I made this dish twice, the first time for guests and they all loved it. It's incredibly easy and tasty. I made this with Kale with Apple and Onion and the Roasted Sweet Potatoes with Honey Glaze that appeared in the same issue. It made for a colorful, delicious meal!

Maybe someone can offer some suggestions - although I thought this was really tasty, I found that as the chops baked in the oven the juices more or less negated the crispness of the pan frying. The flavor was great, but I wished that they had stayed crisper. Any ideas?

I have made this twice & each time I had way too much "crust" makings left over. I also lowered the oven heat - the chops were dry at 425 degrees. However, the flavor was great and it is an easy way to make chops. Someone suggested brine - how do you do that to pork?

Easy to prepare, moist, simple and tasty

I've made these twice already since this issue came out. The flavors are very well balanced and makes for a great weeknight meal. I do brine my chops first, which makes the pork more tender. I find most pork too tough without it. But these are definitely a hit!

This is a great recipe for a very nice weekday meal. The ingredients are just right, and the combination of the cheese, sage and lemon is delightful. I, however, totally disagree with the cooking method. When I browned mine in a regular (not non-stick) skillet, I left half the crust on the bottom of the pan. Next time, I'll simply bake these in a hot oven on a broiling pan so any fat can drip through. I'm sure they'd crisp up nicely with much less fuss.

Great recipe! I'm surprised it hasn't gotten more attention. For the crumbs I used part sourdough and part rosemary foccacia. Then I added a tsp. of Season-All and lemon pepper (in place of lemon peel). Also added a few drops of Tapatio to the egg. Some of the best pork chops I've ever made, and quite a success with my husband as well.
