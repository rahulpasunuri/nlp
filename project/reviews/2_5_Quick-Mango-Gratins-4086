I thought it was very good! And easy !

Well...I hate to review a dish where I had to change the main ingredient. But mangoes weren't available, so I used papayas and bananas. Very delicious. Nice crunch and sweetness.

The problem with this recipe is that it doesn't really improve a plain old cool, refreshing ripe mango: here, the mango is warm, gets softer, and is made too sweet. I love mangoes--they're my favorite fruit--but I will not make this again.
