This makes a mildly-flavored extremely useful vegetable stock. I use it as a base for soups and risottos and sauces. I like to freeze it in ice-cube trays then keep the cubes in a ziploc bag in the freezer. Having a supply on hand makes vegetarian cooking much easier, especially as there is no really good vegetable stock cube that I can find. Like all stock recipes, it is easy to substitute according to what you actually have on hand. I can't get celery or mushrooms most of the time, but I throw in some green beans and up the amount of other things and it's fine. I do insist on leeks, however!
