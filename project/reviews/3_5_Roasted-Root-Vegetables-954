I added garlic as several others suggested. It didn't really cook evenly so that the sweet potato got really soft while the turnip in particular was still a bit crunchy. Were I to make this again, I would probably tweak the amounts a bit: more squash and sweet potato, less parsnip and turnip. I might add onion and carrot, too.

Delicious! tastes like Fall.

I've modified by adding a couple of onions coarsely cut and garlic cloves left in their paper. Also, I didn't use any oil or salt. The taste of the roasted root veggies are flavorful enough on their own. This recipe works well without the fat or salt.

I make this all the time, with a variety of root veggies. I like to mix the roasted veggies with couscous cooked in chicken stock, add a little olive oil and a squeeze of lemon, and some salt and pepper. Delicious, easy and healthy. I have this for lunch all the time.

A great accompaniment to roast beef with Yorkshire pudding. Makes an enormous amount, so be prepared for leftovers.

Wonderful and easy. The parsnips get a wonderfully sweet and toasty taste. Yum! I also added a couple of onions that I peeled and quartered and seasoned all of it liberally with salt and fresh black pepper.

Very good, but time consuiming to chop all the vegatables. I added garlic and onions to avoid it being too bland

Very good - served these with a delicious ham for the holidays. Great for the vegetarians present! Will make again - simple and great tasting side dish.

I loved this recipe!! I used turnip, asparagus and carrots. I also added whole garlic cloves and some quartered red onion to it. Turned out fabulous!! I did not use all that oil just enough to coat the veggies and I sprayed the pan with Pam.(Cuts down on the fat level)

This has become a favorite in our household. I too added rosemary, salt and pepper. I also add whole cloves of garlic and a few shallots for extra flavor. If there are any leftovers, they can be pureed and added to a hearty winter soup.

this is a great dish for a change of pace from roasted potatoes - gave 3 forks instead of 4 -it needs more fresh herbs to enhance the roasted veggies - sometimes they loose a little flavor - added rosemary and at the end sprinkled chopped fresh lemon thyme ontop - very tasty!

I've been making this for years, but add sea salt and fresh rosemary and/or garlic for added punch. Hint: Nuke the veggies for about 15 - 20 minutes first and then roast for about 20 minutes. They cook much faster and more evenly that way, since tbey have different densities.

Fabulous! A fun blend of veggies that I would not normally buy at the market, adding baby red potatoes for my husband who was unsure about all the other veggies flavors.Tasted divine with kosher salt, herbs de provance and cracked pepper. I made this for 25 on Christmas Eve and everyone raved!

No big whoop! I added a smidge of maple syrup to the olive oil (to go with my maple glazed roast turkey for Christmas dinner). Next time, I will try to vary this a little by adding sea salt, cracked pepper and maybe a little cilantro (?) as this was too bland. Others liked it but I found it boring...

Excellent dish, I add kosher salt, herb de provence and a little chicken stock and always get rave reviews. I also add fresh baby artichokes and purple potatoes for a little color.

I also like to add thyme, (really good) balsamic vinegar and a bit of brown sugar if I'm feeling into it.

I often do roast vegetables this way, but add some coarse sea salt, or kosher, fresh ground black pepper and cumin seeds..these make the difference!
