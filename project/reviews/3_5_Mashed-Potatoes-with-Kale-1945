This is excellent!! I love mashed taters and I LOVE kale yet was reluctant to try this recipe. I prefer kale raw and when sauteed I think it gets chewy. No worries with this recipe!! I added the kale (I had Tuscan kale) to the taters and boiled together. Mashed and added the rest of the ingredients (I did not steep the milk bc I didn't have carrots or bay leaf). Soo good!! The kale comes out creamy and has a nice soft flavor. I also made leftovers into soup as recommended (stir some into vegetable broth), added some vegan protein (I made the whole recipe vegan) and DELICIOUS!! Very filling and satisfying. My two year old kid even liked it!!

I made this exactly as written except less butter. I added the butter to the milk (2 tbs) and to the onion (1 tbs), but just added a little olive oil at the end. It definitely tasted rich and buttery enough for me with the amazing bay leaf and carrot milk. It was relatively simple and tasted amazing! This would also go great with a little bacon or pancetta in it.

Worked fine with soy milk and vegan margarine. I did mash the carrot when I added the milk mixture, and I did not add the butter at the end--just put it with the milk and added about a tablespoon when mashing the potatoes. Also sautéed garlic with the onions. Might use a tad less kale or at least use more potatoes. I prefer more potatoes in the mix. It is pretty heavy on the kale with these proportions.

When we found kale in our CSA box again, I found myself at the Epicurious search engine. This recipe appealed, but in order to reduce the butter to a couple tablespoons, I used a trick from my mother's repertoire to enrich the mashed potato flavor: I mashed a mix of carrots and potatoes -- adding a carrot or more for each potato. I also added sauteed garlic to the milk. The slightly sweet carrot/potato/garlic mash complemented the kale deliciously. We're actually looking forward to having kale in the CSA box again!

As an amendment to my previous review...when leftovers are added to chicken broth (as another reviewer recommended) and maybe some cubed corned beef, ham, or kielbasa, the results are an INCREDIBLY fast and delicious soup! I might cook this again just for the soup.

Way too many dirty dishes for a merely average dish.

Since I've now made this recipe for the third time, I figured that I should review it. I think it's a great way to use kale, especially when you have a huge amount in the garden that you don't know what to do with. Steeping the milk with the carrot and bay leaf really adds a lot of flavor; I would not skip this step. I do find that I need quite a bit more milk than the recipe calls for. I have been using about double the milk, but that's just our preference (we like moist mashed potatoes). I would highly recommend this recipe!

Great recipe when the body is calling for some comfort food on a cold winter day. I made mine with dinasaur kale and scaled way back on the butter; added a fair amount of pepper and voilla...totally FAB!!

I doubled this recipe for 16 people...LOL...1 recipe is plenty! I followed the recipe pretty close and it turned out great. Extra potatoes weren't a problem because it was delicious!

It was good. I did have to add liquid to the onion/kale mixture to prevent it burning to the bottom of the pot. A few days later, I found the left-overs in the fridge at lunchtime, so added them to some chicken broth et voila! a very tasty potato soup.I am making it again even as I write!

I, too, fretted the 3 pan ordeal so I took the advice of a previous reviewer and boiled kale and potatoes in one big pot. I used olive oil to caramelise the onion in a small pot. I whizzed kale & potatoes, with hot milk and olive oil. Seasoned and added nutmeg. I stirred onion in the mash. It was good. I served with grilled sausages for a Brit "bangers and mash" dinner ;) I think it's a good use of kale.

Our family loves this recipe: we made it 2x in 2 weeks! Make sure to fully cook the kale, otherwise it may be tough in the end product.

I've made this twice, the 1st time with kale from the garden and once from the store. Other than using three pots it's really simple. The store-bought kale had big ribs so I pulled the leafy parts off and discarded the ribs, then chopped them after washing. The timing is simple, too - I put the milk/butter/bay leaf/carrot in a saucepan and heated it then turned it off. Cooked the onions then added the kale and let them cook then turned it off. When it was time, I boiled the potatoes and followed the rest of the instructions. I didn't pool the butter on top as we were serving it with pan gravy from a roast. I used fresh bay leaf (we have a small bay tree) and it's not as strongly-flavored. Also added a bit of white pepper.

I guess I am not a fan of kale, but my guests did like this.

This recipe was really good. I followed the cook from Washington's modifications and I subsituted heavy cream for milk and mixed my butter in instead of melting it and pooling it on top. Delicious!!

I made this exactly as the recipe states, except I removed the ribs from the kale and chopped it and the onion in a food processor. I also used a fresh bay leaf (I've been having fun with those) and left a little bit of the peel on the potatoes since I love peel in my potatoes. My boyfriend loved it and so did I. Definitely a keeper! Next time I may try a dash of nutmeg. Has anyone tried that or other herbs?

Kale grows like a weed in our garden and we are always looking for new ways to cook it. Made this dish for a large family gathering with turkey and all the trimmings and even those who "don't like greens" gobbled these up - a great potato dish for a crowd.

I was not familiar with this vegetable when I came across this recipe. I was looking for a healthy green that would not be too bitter, as we have six children and all do not like green vegetables. This was a real winner. In fact we often add this to our menu at least once a week. Absolutely delicious. The young ones like to make their own "boat" in their mashed potatoes and put the kale in the center with q little butter. We prefer red onions for flavor.

Haven't made this one, but my mom (and apparently my grandmother) always made kale and potatoes, and now it's a favorite with my kids. Just boil your potatoes with the chopped kale, drain and mash with butter and milk or cream. Salt/pepper to taste. It's wonderful with sausage (here in Milwaukee we have plenty of that), or anytime you'd make mashed potatoes. A great vitamin boost as well, with the kale.
