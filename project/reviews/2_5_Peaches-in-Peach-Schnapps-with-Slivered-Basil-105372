delicious over ice cream, served with pound cake or by itself.

Very Blah.

Fresh, ripe (Michigan) peaches are a must -- I simmered in boiling water to peel them, and I think the slight cooking helped them absorb the schnapps. Also -- cinnamon basil probably added to the freshness of the flavor. Served over angel food cake with vanilla yogurt (or ice cream) -- it was really a lovely end of summer dessert!

ho-hum. A waste of good schnapps.

I offer my alternative, which overcomes two potential problems (i) fruit of unequal ripeness and (ii) discoloration. Make a syrup of white wine and sugar, adding juice of a lemon. Simmer peach slices for a minute or two in this and leave to cool. Fresh mint is just as good as basil.
