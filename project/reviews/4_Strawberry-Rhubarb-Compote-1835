I used this as a sauce on waffles and got rave reviews from all who tried it. I made the recipe as printed. It was great!

A great dessert topping. Used fresh strawberries, sliced, which I added just prior to removing from heat, and just a splash of fresh lime juice. Yum! Easy and delicious - definitely a keeper.

I have never in my life cooked rhubarb. This was so simple and so delicious. I did add some fresh lemon juice (about 2Tblspns). I used whole frozen strawberries and mashed them when cooked. I plan to serve over frozen vanilla yogurt.
