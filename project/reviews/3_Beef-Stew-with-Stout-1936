a little bland, flavorless. i'd recommend either marinating or par-boiling the meat first.

I still have my copy of the May 1996 Bon Appetit where this appeared. I make this stew every St Patrick's Day and then some in between. Don't mess with it at all if you want to make something authentically Irish. It's perfect as is.

This is a basic stew recipe substituting beer for wine. I used an "extra stout" bottled beer and I'm glad I did. After simmering the beer and beef stock down for 15 minutes, the broth developed a rich flavor. I also added thyme and some bay leaves, and threw in some celery and mushrooms. At the end I also thickend the stew with some corn starch. I will definitely continue to cook with beer as an occasional substitute for red wine.

I don't think you should make a stew with beef sirloin. This is more sort of a lengthy stir-fry recipe. If you'd make this using stewing meat and adding a few herbs (thyme and bayleaf) it would be a whole lot better and it could justly be called a stew.

The stout didn't add the right flavor - had to add a lot of salt and you could still taste too much alcohol. Which normally isn't a problem, but this just didn't work.

A staple of ski trips. The recipe I got off the Guinness webiste before they changed it eons ago also had bay and thyme in it. Brown onions instead of pearl. I use yellow onions because they're usually on hand, lots of garlic and more beer then broth. Serve it with home made garlic herb bread or in bread bowls if they can be found. Basically on it's own it's bland but filling. Play with herbs until you find what you like.

No. Just No. There are sooooo many better beef stew recipes on the site.

I made this for St. Pats day 2 years ago. I did not care for the tase and there is not enough beef called for in this recipe. I am sure there are better versions of beef stew.

My husband and I love stout, so we thought this would be great--but the flavor just doesn't work for me in stew. He liked it fine, but I thought it had a funny taste. Also, I had to add quite a bit of beef base to give it any beef flavor at all.

It felt like something was missing in this dish... I added lots of garlic, but this was just not very spectacular. I probably wouldn't make it again; there must be a better stew recipe out there!

This was about the 3rd dish I ever made in my life. Turned out really well. I added a yam, carrots and celery, 1 can stock,1 pint Guinness, 1 yellow onion - but my 12 yr. old daughter complained about the onion - I couldn't find frozen pearl onions which she likes.

This is delicious. Followed previous suggestions and doubled stout, broth, and flour. Served over mashed potatoes. Since I used raw yellow onions, I substituted oil for the butter in order to saute onions long enough to soften. Sometime I would like to try this with the original amount of gravy, the meat in sliced strips, and served over a toasted bun.

I used regular beer and cooked the stew in the crock pot - it was very good. I also added potatoes.

Very hearty and great tasting. This was a simple dish to make and we'll definitely make it again. :)

The stew was great! I quadrupled the recipe and made a few substitutions. Before adding the meat, I followed another reviewer's suggestion to use a few cloves of minced garlic. I added in 4 stalks of celery and 4 carrots (ran out of carrots) and the celery tastes great in here. Also, I used fattier meat (boneless chuck -- I'd been planning on making something else), but it worked well - very tender. Throughout, I used a very generous amount of black pepper. Even with (or because of...) those substitutions, the stew was great -- perfect for an unseasonably cold night.

I must agree with the previous reviewers that this stew is delicious! It's quick, easy, low clean-up and best for me, doesn't make too much. I used leeks instead of pearl onions (just because I had them on hand), added garlic and tossed in fresh parsley just before serving over garlic mashed potatoes - yum!

Very wonderful flavor. Simple and mild. I also found a recipe on here that uses stout to cook a corned beef and cabbage in. VERY nice.

I used regular yellow onions cut up, added cut up potatoes, tripled the stout and broth, also added some garlic salt and a salt free multi seasoning blend, used appropriate amount of corn starch to thicken. I have just one thing to say about this recipe.......WOW, okay two things!!! YUMMY!!!! I don't think my husband will ever eat my old beef stew recipe again!!! The sauce is just out of this world yummy! Will make this one over and over.

This stew is excellent. I doubled the recipe and served it with Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes, steamed broccoli, and a nice Cabernet. Instead of frozen pearl onions, we used regular onions cut into chunks, and it was lovely. This is a keeper for the winter recipe box!

Best beef stew we've ever had. We also added more liquid and stout and then some more flour and cornstarch to thicken it. Next time we'd consider adding some potatoes into the stew.

This is a wonderfully tasty recipe, I doubled the recipe, would be good with crusty bread. We loved it, and I will make it again soon.

I used some pickled pearl onions because I couldn't find the suggested frozen onions at the supermarket. That kind of killed this fine recipe because the acid taste of the onions did not match too well and overpowered the beef & beer taste. Don't make my mistake! Did the recipe again with excellent results.

Definitely double the recipe and then add more liquid, plus more flour or corn starch to thicken the stew. This was great with parsley potatoes and biscuits on the side!
