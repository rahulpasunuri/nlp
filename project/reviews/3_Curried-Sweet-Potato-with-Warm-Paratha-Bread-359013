The taste was good. I added fat by using whole milk, the consistency was somewhat like baby food. Maybe I'll avoid the food processor next time.

This is an easy, healthy and delicious dinner, and if you double the recipe, it makes for great leftovers. I don't have paratha bread (always) accessible, so I used a packaged whole wheat naan and it was fine. I also added some garlicky lentils and very lightly steamed baby spinach on the side for a great vegetarian meal. My next alteration is to try substituting butternut squash for the sweet potato. Curry paste is a must here; to the reader who used curry powder and then downgraded the recipe for being bland, try it again with the curry paste. It makes a big difference.

I thought this was pretty okay. I had to use curry powder instead of paste, and soymilk instead of regular milk, so that may have affected the flavor, but I thought it needed *something* - mostly to spice it up. Next time I would either use the curry paste as directed or add cayenne pepper along with the rest of the spices. Nonetheless, it was filling and easy/quick to make.
