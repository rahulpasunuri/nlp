Wegman's has husked hazelnuts, so these are easy to make. Left the butter out overnight so it was soft enough and the dough held together with no trouble. They are delicious!

Wow. I made these cookies exactly as written, but I should have taken the advise of other reviewers and doubled the recipe. I hate skinning hazelnuts, but this is totally worth it. And, as a recommendation to others who fall in love with this recipe, toast way more hazelnuts than you need, run them through the food processor, and freeze a bag of them ground. That way, next time you get a hankering for this recipe, most of your time-consuming prep is already done.

Perfect shortbread. I doubled the recipe and rolled the dough into a slice-and-bake log as so many of the previous bakers recommended. And just an FYI to earlier reviewers who questioned the addition of baking powder to shortbread, it is in fact a common ingredient, jut as commonly added as left out of traditional recipes. My grandmother arrived in the US from Edinburgh. She worked professionally as a baker in Boston and on Cape Cod for years, and this is how she made her shortbread at home. The small amount of leavening agent creates pockets of air in between the butter and flour, and makes a more tender shortbread. She also made hers with rice flour rather than plain flour and it added a nice flavor as well as sandy texture.

May favorite cookie... always a big hit. It's easier if you form the dough into logs, refigerate until chilled then slice rounds... much faster than hand shaping and the rounds dipped in chocolate and nuts looks great.

This has been part of my holiday repertoire for years now - a little time-conuming as any dipped cookie is, but well worth it. Pretty and delicious!

These are awful! They spread and were nothing more than a thin crispy cookie and, I hate crispy cookies -- Of course - who ever saw baking powder in shortbread? I will not be making these ever again - this is not shortbread.

OMG! This is one of the best cookie recipes I've ever made, definitely in the top 2! I followed other reviewers suggestions and refrigerated the dough before baking and doubled the batch- it came out perfect! I only wished that I tripled the recipe! I hate skinning hazelnuts, but I won't mind doing it for this recipe! Yummmmmmm!!!!

Rating: 4
OMG - When trying a new recipe, I only make half the recipe. What a mistake that was! These are the best. I'll definitely triple the recipe next time (probably today). They'll be a part of my Christmas collection, maybe with a hint of orange in the chocolate.

I substituted pecans (which I toasted) for the hazelnuts. I also rolled the dough into a large log, refrigerated it and sliced it into rounds. These cookies were a hit! The dipping in chocolate and rolling in nuts was time consuming though. If you don't have the time, the cookies alone are delicious!

Rating: 4
I doubled the recipe and made them into two inch logs. These cookies are time consuming - the rolling and dipping ... but well worth the effort, in terms of appearance and taste. I used them on my Holiday Cookie plates this year, for the first time and will continue to do so in the future.

Took tips from other reviewers and used almond meal in place of the hazel nuts (Trader Joe brand). I also replaced the vanilla extract with almond extract. The best suggestion was to divide the dough in half and form into rectangular logs and then slice. I formed my logs with the dough covered in plastic wrap and then put the logs in the fridge for 20 minutes. I doubled the recipe and had 47 cookies using the slice method. My cookies took less than 20 minutes to bake. Since I did not grind hazelnuts or form individual cookies, these were a snap to make. Coating with chocolate took a little time, but the finished cookie gave the impression I spent a lot of time in the kitchen.

Great Cookies, used walnuts instead of hazelnuts and they were still a hit. The cookies spread while baking so I tried to keep them small and came up with ~30 from one batch.

I love these cookies because they are not too sweet. The texture is wonderfully crumbly and the hazelnuts provide great flavor. I would definitely recommend.

Wonderful!! Let the dough rest 10 minutes before forming, and all went well. Would defintely make again! Tasted even better the next day.

Wow. Amazing cookies. I used my stand mixer and the consistency was great. The dough rolled into sticks well.I doubled the recipe and ended up with close to 50 cookies. Husband says these are the best cookies he's ever had.

I made these with Pecan's my Mom sent me from her trees in Alabama. They are great. Will make them again but will use less dough as they were a bit bigger than I thought they would be.

As suggested, I doubled the recipe and tried to keep them small. The dough is very crumbly- fridging it for 10 minutes helped a lot. I love dark chocolate, so I used that to coat, but I think that was a bad move on my part. The cookies are not very sweet (which is good), but I think these would have benefited from something sweeter. A good cookie, and very pretty!

Made these last night and used dark chocolate as I didn't have milk chocolate on hand. Delicious. I also used kosher salt and loved the occasional hit of salt. Next time I might add pistachios to the mix on top of the chocolate.

I couldn't get the logs to hold together quite right, so I just rolled the dough into balls. They didn't spread, and came out to be more shortbread "drops", but still worked just fine dipping them in chocolate. I used almonds instead of hazelnuts, and I think next time I'll try them with pecans.

Fabulous!!! i made these for thanksgiving dessert and they were the biggest hit!They were so easy and quick to make, although there are multiple pans/bowls for all elements of these amazing cookies! made a quadrupal batch for 25 people and there were none left. i have gotten many requests to make these for our next family get together. next time i will make some with lindt dark chocolate as well as some milk chocolate. they turned out tender and melted in my mouth! i will definately be making these soon!

This was simply delicious! Very easy, though you will have quite a few dirty dishes at the end. I didn't have hazelnuts on hand so I used a bag of mixed nuts including green pumpkin seeds and almonds. I toasted the nuts and chopped them very coarsely for sprinkling on top. The dark brown of the toasted almond and pecan with the green of the pumpkin seeds against the dark chocolate looks very elegant. A definite keeper!

These cookies are a favorite of mine and a frequent crowd pleaser. Rather than making sticks, I prefer to roll the dough into a log, cover with plastic wrap, chill, and slice into rounds. I also like to use kosher salt -- the bigger crystals make for a nice salty surprise every few bites. When short on time, I've skipped the chocolate and nuts and still received rave reviews, but the cookies aren't nearly as pretty that way.

These were absolutely delicious, easy to make, and came out exactly as pictured. Unlike some of the reviewers the batch actually yielded slightly more than the recipe indicates (~25). I will be making these again for sure!!

I doubled the recipe and they were amazing! They only made about 32, but the cookies turned out much bigger than I anticipated. They were still the same length, but much wider than pictured. Next time I think I will make them round little discs because they are extremely crummy, and biting into the big logs was a mess. I would definitely make them again!

Rating: 3
It was a bit of a struggle to create the individual log shapes, as the dough is quite crumbly. I think the previous reviewer's idea to make it into a large log and cut it is a good one. Overall, though, this is an easy, tasty recipe. I probably made larger cookies than called for, and ended up getting only 16 cookies out of it.

Rating: 3
I've made these the last couple of years for rave reviews. I always double the recipe, even that yields only 34 cookies! I had a breakthrough this year, after using my mixer to prepare the dough, I rolled the whole dough in parchment into one large rectangular log shape about 3 inches wide and 1 inch thick, then sliced off the cookies about a quarter inch, and baked for 15 minutes. They do expand quite a bit; so this yielded the perfect shape.

I just made these and they came out perfectly. I think it's important to have the butter at room temp, but not too soft. This may prevent cookies from flattening. And I blend the flour mixture with the butter mixture by hand.

Wonderful recipe! I have made two batches so far -- one with pecans and one with macadamia nuts in places of the hazelnuts. Both were great, but the hazelnut batch seemed to come out a bit lighter and tastier. Used Hershey's chocolate chips for my first dip, but will use a better chocolate for this second batch. Thanks!!

Doubled the recipe and still only got @ 26 sticks. Maybe I made them too big, but they are wonderful. I like the airiness that the baking powder adds. If I changed anything, I may add a little more sugar last time for a tad more sweetness. I had no problems with crumbling. I think the key is to have the butter really soft and then to cream it with the sugar really well so the dough is not so dry. This will be a regular gift cookie for me.

I make these every year as part of my Christmas cookie repertoire and they're great. Biggest modification is subbing almonds for the hazelnuts and using bitterweet chocolate for the dip. Still great!

Very good, used whole wheat pastry flour and did not modify the recipe at all. I did not chill the dough, and was able to put it through my cookie press--made long ribbons that I cut to about 2inches long. I cooked them 18 min & that was plenty. No prob w/dipping them in the chocolate (used double boiler for chocolate). These are a lighter shortbread, not the heavy type.

Really tasty! These were easy to make and taste fantastic! On my first attempt i only got 15 cookies out of the batch, but they're quite big! Living at 5280 these baked for about 25 minutes, but no other changes to the recipe. Will be making more for a work potluck.

Hi, we quadrupled this recipe and it worked fine. Used unbleached flour, super dark chocolate dip. Toasted hazelnuts with a dash of salt for dip and kept regular ground hazelnuts for inside. Wondering if a bit of drambuie or citrus could provide more depth, or just complicate things. I got rave reviews and I'm only a beginner baker. Thoughts?

I made these for a Christmas cookie exchange and made a few changes. Doubled the batch. I ground the hazelnuts in the processor in two batches, coarse for decorating and fine for cookie dough. I put sugar and butter into processor to cream, then added flour and baking powder and pulsed to blend, then added fine ground nuts and vanilla. Just pulse until dough forms. I used chocolate chips that I melted in the microwave. Went together very fast and the double batch made 48 2 inch cookies.

Exquisite. Very easy, no refinements, used Lindt Classic milk chocolate. Found tipping the dipping bowls at 45-degree angles (propped with dish towel) made it easy to gently dip cookies. We had three casualties but -- somehow -- they disappeared!

I'm probably a worse baker than the one from Natick, MA so I made these twice to be sure. Even at our 6500 foot elevation, these were easy, not at all fussy, and eveyone (except the perpetual dieters) loves them. The second time around I omitted the chopped nuts for dipping because they are less messy and prettier without them.

Rating: 4
These are superb - i'll make them every christmas. I found cooling them well (i laid them on trays outside) and dipping them very gently in the chocolate (i also used dark) was helpful in keeping them from breaking. Contrary to what one other reviewer mentioned, I don't find the baking powder (though odd) changes the flavour or fine consistency.

Excellent-used hazelnuts with skins, toasted the nuts used for dipping, and used bittersweet chocolate. Mine flattened out during baking, might need tweaking, but definitely a keeper.

Wow! I'm an admittedly BAD baker and I scored big with these! My small local grocery store did not carry hazelnuts, so I substituted pecans. I snuck a taste before dipping them and even before the chocolate they were buttery and yummy - no complaints at all about crumbling texture. Mine held up beautifully. They were so good in fact, that we scrapped the idea of peppermint bark and plan to package these for friends and family for Christmas!

Hi ladies and gentlemen - I would like to update my report - I gave the rather lengthy report on 6-05 - well, a day after I made these (kept them on a covered plate) I took a bite and what a difference. I don't know what it was but they had turned into the softest, most delicious shortbread as opposed to the way they were the day I baked them - I don't know why - do you? But I made myself sick to my stomach eating a handful of them. Well, I will try them again and be more careful this time however, messy or not, they are delicious a day and more after you bake them.

I just made these - they are horrible - shortbread is basically one cup butter to one cup flour give or take depending on the recipe and whatever other flavors you throw in. But,I have never, ever seen shorbread made with "baking powder" - against my better judgement and gut feeling, I went ahead anyway and made them knowing they would not be good, at least for me. I will stick to all the pretty "basic" shortbread recipes I have used in the past. This is too light and crumbly and not a shortbread texture at all. I did, in fact use more than I should have of ground up almonds but nonetheless, we will eat them but will not make this recipe again.

Rating: 0
An addition to my comment from 01/05/05: I made this again and as I was putting the logs on the baking sheet, a mere touch of the finger made some crumble instantly. I'll try chilling the dough next time for at least 30 minutes before making the logs.
