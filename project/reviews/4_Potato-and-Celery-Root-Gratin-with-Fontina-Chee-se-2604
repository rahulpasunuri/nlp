Not health food, but sooo tasty. I've made this recipe twice and will definitely make it again. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it was fantastic. The second time I used tart green apples instead of celery root - my husband's suggestion because he thought the apples would work well with the pork chops we were having that night. The apple variation was good, but I'll go back to celery root next time - it adds such a nice flavor and a little complexity.

This is amazing! The first time I made it I couldn't find celery root so substituted turnips. So good that I have yet to try it with celery root! I usually use a 2 to 1 ratio of potatoes to turnips. Fabulous!

I have been making this recipe ever since it was first published in Bon Appetit in 1994. I love my starches and it is the best potato gratin recipe I have ever seen. You can substitute onions for the shallots and vary the amount of celery root based on your own tastes, but please do use the russets and the nutmeg. I use the small slicing disk on my foot processor for thinly sliced vegetables and it holds very well if other menu items are still cooking.

All I can say was this was great! You must use the celery root, smells wonderful and adds depth to the dish. Guests did not mention the celery root, just cleaned their plates. Served with Classic Osso Buco and a Sangiovese wine.Appetizers were Crab Meat Parmesan Canapes & Sea Scallops with Spiced Bacon both on this site. A lite green salad was also served and dessert was Limencello pound cake. Fantastic menu if I must say myself!

I make this all the time, but since I cannot get celery root, i have used leeks. And I don't always use fontina -- i use all soerts of cheeses. But always yummy.

This was a big hit at Christmas dinner. However I did change it a bit. Since there were only four of us I only used the 2 pounds of potatoes (and no celery root) and then I used the full recipe for the spice mix and the liquid portion. Cooked the same amount of time.

I loved this recipe and my guests said they did, too. However, my husband did not like the celery root. Next time, will make with just potatoes. I made it several hours ahead and refrigerated. (Did not discolor since sauce covered potatoes.) I added extra fontina with each of the layers. I think I cooked it a lot longer than the recipe said and it was for the best because it would have been runny if I didnt.

I love this dish but the celery flavor is quite prominent. I may decide to replace a little of the celery root with potato the next time I make it. It smells heavenly cooking in the oven.

My family loves this recipe so much, that every year my sister has to read it off or fax it to at least three people, because she is the only one who still has the magazine. Now I have it too!! (confession - we always blow off the celery root, because we never remember to buy it)
