You know, I love anchovies. I had to add 1-2 more filets to get the taste & saltiness to come thru! Otherwise, in its original form it was too lemony AND too much olive oil taste. Don't get me wrong, I love olive oil too, but it was too strong for mayonnaise.

Fabulous flavor. I also used 1/2 cup oil, but added another anchovy. Next time will drop the salt and add another anchovy!

Very easy to make. A delicious sauce for asparagus. Would use it as a dipping sauce for artichokes as well. I did not use 3/4 oil - added just over 1/2 cup. Thought that was sufficient.
