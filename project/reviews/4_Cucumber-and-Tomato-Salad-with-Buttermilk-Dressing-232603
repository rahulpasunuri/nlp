I accidentally bought a quart of butter milk instead of regular milk, so I came to my favorite recipe website in search of a good buttermilk salad dressing. This is simple to make and is really delicious, but the chives are essential! (I tasted it before I added the chives, and it really needed something...and the chives were it!) Also, I did not add lettuce...just tomato and cucumber, DELICIOUS!!!!

This is easy and tasty. I used plain yoghurt in place of buttermilk and added fresh tarragon and oregano in addition to chives. I only made about a quarter recipe.

Cut amounts greatly for just us, but it still worked. Really loved the dressing!
