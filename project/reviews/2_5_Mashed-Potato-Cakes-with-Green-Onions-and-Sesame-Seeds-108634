The key to the cakes not falling apart is to make sure that the potatoes are completely cooled. It said that you can prepare them 6 hours ahead of time but I would say you "ought" to prepare them ahead.

This recipe was intriguing, and with some tinkering, I think it would be really good. I would definitely not describe these having a crisp exterior. They were very strongly seasoned, and too salty. I think decreasing the amount of ginger and salt, and increasing the amount of oil used to brown them would result in a really tasty side dish.

I've made this twice. The first time, I followed the directions, the next time I used left over mashed potatoes. I added wasabi to the mix the second time and will continue to do that. Both times were very good.

I followed the recipe and had great results. The only deviation I made was refrigerating the cakes overnight. When I cooked them the next day they were great.

I was really excited to make these, but was sorely disappointed. The cakes just fell apart in the pan. Maybe more egg, I don't know. I think I'll stick to traditional scallion pancakes and maybe add these extra flavorings.
