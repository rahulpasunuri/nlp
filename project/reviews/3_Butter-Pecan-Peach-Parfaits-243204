This tasted wonderful. The combination of the caramel sauce, the butter pecan ice cream and the peaches was divine, but the caramel sauce was impossible to eat. It solidified the minute it hit the ice cream. It was brittle on the outside and stuck to my teeth when I tried to chew it. My dinner guests and I were all struggling with it. If I could just figure out how to keep the sauce runny, I'd make it again in a flash.

This sauce solidified as soon as it hit the ice cream and became very difficult to eat. The outside became hard and inside it stuck to my teeth. But the taste was delicious. If I could only figure out how to keep the sauce liquid, I'd make it again in a flash.
