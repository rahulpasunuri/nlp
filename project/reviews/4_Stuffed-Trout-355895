I thought this was generally excellent. Perhaps my jalapeño wasn't hot enough but it need a little more heat. In this case I added a couple of drops of hot sauce. Watch the cooking time. Check at the minimum amout of time. Delicious and will make again.

I am not a fish lover, but loved this recipe. I substituted canned lump crab for fresh and I used Johnny's Seafood Seasoning instead of Old Bay seasoning. I only stuffed 2 trout and stuffed mushrooms with the leftover filling. Delicious and elegant.

Really delicious! I made this for my anniversary with sweet potato oven fries. I just used two rainbow trout fillets, with the stuffing in between them. I wasn't sure if it was supposed to have the skin on it, but the skin came right off after cooking. I also used 6 oz of crab meat for stuffing 2 fillets. Looked and tasted very gourmet for how easy it was!

Absolutely delicious. I added breadcrumbs for some different texture, and sprinkled the skin of the fish with course salt for a nice crust. Would make this again next week.
