These cookies are WONDERFUL, but you need to do two things in order to avoid dryness....sift your whole wheat flour three times, then measure out 3 cups...whole wheat flour is way denser than white. And try baking them in a bar pan, 11x7. Also, use just 1 cup of whole wheat (sifted) and two cups white flour. Not as healthy, but hey, look at the rest of the ingredients, not exactly "heathy" to begin with but they sure are tasty! Keep trying and remember...sift, sift, sift!!

I followed recipe exactly with the whole wheat flour. The dough was very dry - I could barely stir in the mix-ins. My husbands said that cookies looked like little turds and wouldn't eat them. They were passable when warm and tasted pretty much like chocolate chips and nuts. Didn't care for them at all the next day. Do not recommend these.

Great, healthy cookies. We substituted Splenda for the sugar, brown sugar for the molasses, and added 1/4 buttermilk. The whole wheat flour is essential for the graham cracker taste.

When I was making this I noticed that the mixture looked really dry, so I added an extra 1/2 stick of butter and about another 1/4c or so of buttermilk. They were hard to remove, but I took them to a party and they were pretty popular. All the cookies were eaten and a few people asked for the recipe.

I must say that this recipe disappointed me quite a bit. When I searched "S'more" on the search tab, I was very excited to see that they had a recipe for s'mores in cookie form! Yet, when I had finished baking it, I realized that it barely had any flavour, and the chocolate chips were the only ingredient that contributed to the cookie's flavour. So, if you decide to make this recipe (although I recommend you don't even bother), keep in mind that you should only put in 2 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour, instead of 3 or else it makes the cookies extremely dry.

I'm sorry, I just have a problem with any recipe that has 1 1/2 cups of sugar and a stick of butter in it calling itself "Healthy, Low-Cal"

I was very pleased with how these cookies turned out. I didn't follow the recipe exactly, used graham flour, substituted pecans for walnuts, left out the molasses, and did the lemon juice and milk swap for the buttermilk. I wish they would have come out a little crisper, but maybe I just didn't bake them long enough.

The molasses flavor was really strong. The cookies did not taste very much like s'mores at all. Such high hopes dashed...

Well the harshest critics of all, my kids, love these cookies. They are different, but I like that, it feels slightly less naughty because of the whole wheat flour. BUT, I only baked them for 12 minutes not 15, and because the majority of the marshmallows melted they were very difficult to remove from the baking parchment and much swearing ensued.

At first I was surprised by the flavor, but then remembered the recipe is called S'more Cookies for a reason. They taste like s'mores. Baking on a silicon baking mat makes removal from the cookie sheet very easy with no sticking. I added 1-2 mini marshmallows on top of the cookies before baking. The marshmallows came out nicely golden brown like they were cooked over a campfire. I would add fewer marshmallows to the dough next time and more directly to the top before baking. My kids love s'mores, and we make them under the broiler during the winter so this recipe is a keeper at our house.

I wish I had read the reviews before making these cookies. I will not be making these again. They really don't have much in the way of flavor. I was disappointed. I don't know how this one passed the test kitchen.

Everyone that hated this recipe and the dry texture of the cookies will like it using these substitutions: Instead of 3 cups of whole wheat flour use 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1 cup graham cracker crumbs and 1/2 cup white self rising flour (I was out of regular white flour but it would probably be OK too). I cut the mini marshmallows in half with kitchen shears since people had problems with them and used semi-sweet chocolate chips (I'm sure milk chocolate would be good too but I used what I had) I used a 1 1/2" scoop to put the dough onto a flat baking stone covered with a silicone baking sheet (insted of the parchment paper. I dipped my fingers in water to flatten the dough balls and baked in a convection oven for 15 minutes at 325 degrees. A regular oven would work fine too. The cookies did not stick. They are not dry at all-they're delicious made this way!

Oh I am so sorry but this recipe was a dog. Cakey and very uncookie like. Just nasty. Sorry BA, I still love ya but this one was terrible.

So glad it wasn't just me...found this recipe to be total disaster. I have 3 boys who usually devour any baked goods, but the entire batch is still sitting out (except a few cookies eaten by the son who helped make them...think he was just trying to be polite).

I made this and thought they tasted pretty good warm right out of the oven. I didn't use marshmellows but instead added some white chocolate chunks, a little extra brown sugar instead of molasses and added peanut butter which gave them more flavor and moisture. Just about 1/3 cup of peanut butter made them excellent

I thought these were pretty good. Not your usual cookie, lightly sweet like a Graham Cracker. They truly simulated a S'more to me, right down to the slightly charred marshmallow!

different...but very tasty! i loved the whole wheat flour. my only tip is to make sure that the butter cools before you add it to the eggs or else they scramble.

These cookies are very good. I am always looking for ways to health things up a bit and I liked the whole wheat flour.

I have made these cookies twice in the last week. While not a 'showstopper' cookie, if my kids or wife asks me to make something again, I try to do it. Yes, they are dry-ish...but the graham crackers in s'mores made around a campfile are dry too. Yes, they don't spread but I solved that by pressing on them with wet fingers. Yes, they stick to pans and No, I didn't use parchment...let them cool on the pan a bit and they come easily...use a little elbow grease on cleanup and you're good to go! And, Yes my marshmallows were supremely dry..... I found them underneath some confectioners sugar in a bag that was no so tightly closed!

I have never had a problem with any recipes from Bon Appetit or Gourmet, but these were absolutely terrible. I even called the number printed in the front of the magazine to complain and I never heard back from the magazine. I followed the recipe exactly, and it was a total loss. I even tried rolling them in sugar to sweeten them up, but it didn't help me salvage these dry, cakey "cookies." My husband wouldn't even eat them and I ended up throwing them away. I was too embarrassed to serve them to my in- laws, who were coming over for the superbowl, and I ended up making boxed blondies that I fortunately had on hand instead!

These cookies were easy to make, moist and tasty. I did not get the marshmallows dried out so put them in the freezer while I assembled the rest of the ingrediants. That worked well. I will make them again-soon!

I used all whole wheat flour that had been stone ground and really enjoyed the cookies. As mentioned by other reviewers they are a denser cookie and the wheat flour gives it a differnet texture, but it did remind me of S'mores and I would make them again. I made a batch of Tollhouse at the same time and of course these aren't the same, but they're not supposed to be. They aren't as sweet, but still very yummy. I didn't use nuts (allergy and preference), and I used semi-sweet morsels since that's all I usually bake with. I also did not let my marshmallows stale, but it was an old bag from months (if not a year) ago that had been sealed up. Anyhow, I really enjoyed the cookies and their flavor.

Wow, were we disappointed! I was really looking forward to trying these, especially seeing how the flavour of traditional smores would come out with the whole wheat flour. I followed all the instructions, including leaving the marshmallows out to dry for a few days. The flavours were off and the texture was odd. My hubby, who is usually a cookie addict to the degree that I always end up thinking my batches end up with only a few cookies :-) left cookies in the jar!!! Even three days later there were still cookies left, even though there were no other snack items in the house at the time! Never again!

I wonder what all the bad reviewers were expecting (and why the one cook from Colorado submitted 5 bad reviews). The issue that had the recipe had it as one of several ways to "go whole wheat." I followed the recipe to the letter, had no problem with the batter (definitely use parchment paper!) and my husband and I are delighted with the results. No, it doesn't taste like a Toll House Cookie. But it is a great recipe for those who want something a little sweet but want fewer calories/healthier ingredients. Whole wheat flour is inherently denser (i substituted 1/4 cup white flour) and nuttier than white flour, so it will inherently taste less sweet than cookies made with white flour. But I actually thought that, much like a good loaf of whole wheat artisan bread, these cookies were complex and more interesting than a regular chocolate chip cookie. A new healthy staple for us!

These cookies are awful. My husband who will virtually eat anything sweet said "Yuck!" I even remade this with white flour and still terrible. We ended up throwing both batches away.

I liked these cookies, they are different but really good. The whole wheat gives the cookies texture, the cookies are sweet but not to sweet. I look forward to making them again.

These cookies looked fine, and I didn't have any trouble with the recipe, but they tasted terrible! The whole wheat doesn't make them taste like graham cracker. They taste like whole wheat. I ended up with a huge batch of cookies that no one wanted to eat!

I thought these were pretty good, and my husband loves them. I was lazy and used my stand mixer to beat the wet ingredients, then added the dry and the chips/ marshmallows. I omitted the nuts. Agree that you need to use parchment paper - dough is sticky and any exposed marshmallows will turn into a gluey mess. I used a whole wheat graham flour (my first time using whole wheat), and I like that it gave the cookies a rougher texture and a touch of that graham cracker flavor. These are not your traditional cookies, but I think it was a nice change from a standard chocolate chip.

Oh, my goodness! We really LIKED these cookies! I also made them smaller and did leave the marshmallows out for a few days before baking. Other than the size, I made no changes. I'm not usually a 'crunchy' type - but, really, give them a chance!

I have never written a review before, and i really do love bon appetit, but these cookies were horrible. do not waste your time, money, or ingredients.

You've got to be kidding me. I took a cue from the previous TERRIBLE reviews, refusing to believe that these cookies could be that bad...alas, they are a waste of time and good ingredients. I not only used only half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose flour, but toasted my walnuts and chopped hersey's bars by hand. This recipe can't be saved. I would like to know what Bon Appetit's test kitchen was thinking!

I had high hopes for these.....tried making them as a bar cookie so they might retain some moisture. Well, the whole wheat flour was a ghastly mistake. I think they were a bit "earthy" for our tastes. Sent them to over to a bunch of nurses who will typically eat anything.....there were lots of leftovers~ Wouldn't recommend to a friend! Yuk.

I just made these cookies last night, and while I had not trouble with spreading, these were mediocre at best. The whole-wheat flour makes for a heavier texture that reminded me of cookies that had been overmixed. I tossed the recipe afterwards because I don't think adjustments to the recipe would be the ticket in this case.

The taste of the cookies is pretty good, but mine didn't turn out very pretty. Like others have mentioned, definitely use the parchment paper; the marshmallows are pretty sticky. Also, I made my cookies a bit smaller. That seemed to help make the cookies a little bit prettier. The dough tends to spread a bit, partially due to the marshmallows melting. I'm not sure if stale marshmallows are really better. I used an open bag of marshmallows that I'd had in the pantry for about a month and a half, but they still didn't hold their shape.

I had high hopes for these cookies and while they're good I'm not sure that they're worth the work... The dough is definitely very sticky and I did have some trouble incorporating the chocolate, marshmallows and nuts - I found that chilling the dough before shaping the cookies was helpful. I'm thinking that a traditional chocolate chip cookie recipe with the addition of the marshmallows would be quite delicious since I do like the idea of these cookies - sort of campy!

These are ok. Not great. I was excited to make them but they aren't good enough that I would make them a 2nd time. I cooked them on parchment and let them cool long enough to handle and they peel right off the paper without any problems. You definately need to cook these on parchmet otherwise they will be stuck.

only ok. I let the first batch cool on sheets as instructed. where they became little glueballs and would not come off the paper. decided to take them off right away and just ate all the broken ones. They are ok (better the next day) but there are a tastier cookie recipes out there.
