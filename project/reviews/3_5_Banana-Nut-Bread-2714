Made this yesterday. Used 25% more nuts and cooked 10 additional minutes as I like (unlike most people, I'm sure) enjoy a drier bread with a crunchier crust. Also used yogurt instead of sour cream. The bread came out beautifully. I will definitely be making this again, and adding chopped dark chocolate, instead of the additional nuts. This is a very good basic banana bread.

Great recipe, have been making it since college with modifications. I always add a generous sprinkle of cinnamon, some freshly grated nutmeg, a dash of vanilla, and chopped chocolate (preferably bittersweet chips) to kick this one up a notch. Also, you can definitely sub greek yogurt (fat free, low fat, full fat -- doesn't matter) for the sour cream, which I often do if I don't have sour cream on hand.

Rating: 4
All I can say is that if you follow the recipe (actually measuring the amount of banana needed and not just going with the '2') this bread will come out beautifully. Not sure why others had problems as this was pretty spectacular. Cooking time did need to be increased.

I left out the nuts, reduced about 1/4 of the sugar and used whole wheat flour. Yum!

Also, add a third banana if you want the banana flavor to come through!

I've made this countless times and over time. As it is now, it is somewhat dry, sweet and not very banana-flavored. I have tried out variations and adjusted the ingredients for moistness and flavor - only after these adjustments can you can give it a four fork/star rating... Pls adjust the ingredients as below: 3/4 cup sugar (instead of 1 cup sugar) 1 1/2 cups flour (instead of 2 cups flour) Can use plain lowfat yogurt instead of sour cream if one is not available. Can use creme fraiche if butter is not available. Optional : add a handful of dried cranberries slightly re-hydrated in warm water, drained and dried off) for a variety in flavor!

I did not like the taste of this bread. Despite all the good ingredients. It lacked flavor. Quite boring. Nice texture though. Would absolutely not make again. I make banana bread at least once a month and this is one of the worst I have made from the website.

I've made this bread many times, and it is delicious. I usually use greek yogurt in place of sour cream and substitute whole wheat flour for some of the all-purpose flour, and I *always* add a tsp of salt.

OH WOW, people! I had first tried this recipe a few years ago, and took advice from 3 reviewers from 9/23-11/01/03, then tweaked myself. Here's my recipe for making 2 loaves (which will NOT last long!): 3/4 c. + 4 T. sour cream with 1 T. baking soda; 2 sticks butter, 1 2/3- 3/4 c. sugar (I like it less, no one misses it), 1 T. vanilla extract, 4 eggs, 2 c. mashed very ripe banana (about 3, even out measure with apple sauce), 4 c. flour (half all- purpose, half whole wheat pastry flour) whisked together with 1 t. baking powder, 2 t. salt, 1 1/2 t. cinnamon, 1/2 t. nutmeg and 1 t. cardamom (amazing!); 1/2 cup chopped nuts and 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips lightly coated with flour. Follow recipe directions, baking for 65-70 minutes as suggested, checking with toothpick for doneness. This makes a super moist and delicious banana bread! (*I once added about 1 1/2 T. ground flaxseed for a healthy kick, but it cuts baking time because the oil in it makes them brown faster). ENJOY!

I've always had great results with this recipe. I like to dice about 1/4 cup of dried apricots to add in, and toast the nuts lightly ahead of time. My oven's pretty accurate, and I found it undercooked in the middle when I took it out at 50 min (nice golden brown otherwise) so suggest other reviewer's suggestion of using foil collar to prevent overbrowning. Use 3 bananas, and that solves the dryness problem.

Rating: 2
Just made this. It's a good recipe with not as much fat as a lot of others, but was bland. At the last minute I added cinnamon, nutmeg, salt and a few extra tablespoons of oil (others mentioned it was dry). I also subbed 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and a 1/2 cup of brown sugar for white. Good recipe, with revisions.

Rating: 3
Easy, but could have been more moist. Next time I will add another banana (I used two large) and add a little more sour cream and use foil to cover the top to avoid overly browning. Good flavor, just a little dry.

This is my 2nd review, as I changed it quite a bit: I added a little more sour cream - a few extra tbs. SPICES: I added nutmeg, ginger, and cinnamon. A good tbs or more of VANILLA. About 9 tbls butter. Used Pastry flour. Made it lighter. It turned out really well. Make absolutely certain the nuts are FRESH! NOTHING kills your food faster than rancid oils, and nuts have oil. I accidentally inverted the baking powder and baking soda. 2nd time I made this: 1/2 pastry & 1/2 regular flour. Didn't invert the soda & powder so it was fluffier. Extremely fine chopped apple. So fine, that if I kept chopping it would almost be apple sauce! Made circa ½ cup  then I added the one over ripe banana and ½ almost ripe banana (just bec I didn't have another over ripe one). I added about a good heaping handful of bloobs, however, I stupidly added them at the same time as the other fruit, and I should have waited till the end w nuts, so they wouldn't get mashed. Duh duh duh. Extremely finely diced nuts  i also chopped them even more w my knife, till they were as small & fine as i could muster. Everyone raved about this, and asked for the recipe w/ my changes.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe twice, it is extremely easy. My family and co-workers love it. I did not change a thing, just make sure you use 1 cup of bananas (can be 2 or 3 depending on the size). The baking time is not an hour, I bake on the middle rack at 350 for close to an hour and 20 minutes. This can vary by oven, just keep checking until knife comes out clean.

Rating: 4
I took it out 10 minutes early, just because it smelled done. It was. I added a little more sour cream just because the container had a few extra tablespoons that I didn't feel like storing. I added nutmeg, ginger, and cinnamon. About 1/2 - 1 tbls extra butter (just cut it that way). Otherwise pretty much the same. It turned out really well. Luckily I had 3 bags of walnuts because 2 of them were rancid or near rancid. The 3rd bag was nice and fresh. NOTHING kills your food faster than rancid oils, and nuts have oil. So check your olive oil. If you buy that huge gallon thing, and don't use it fast enough. ...yech.

This is the best banana bread recipe I have ever made. I too make a few changes. I used brown sugar only, added 1 tsp on vanilla and used 1 cup cake flour and 1 cup regular flour. It turned out excellent. Also needs to bake 70 minutes at 3500 feet elevation (with foil to keep the top from getting too brown in the end). This is a keeper!!

I've made this twice, each time doctoring the recipe slightly (i.e., first time, added some ground ginger and cardamom; second time, vanilla and cinnamon, and brown sugar instead of white), and it's turned out well both times. Each time, I used three bananas, because that's what I had on hand, and they had to be used. Good taste, good texture, just the right amount of sweetness, and highly tailorable. A great recipe.

If a recipe needs so many adjustments, why bother? There are so many others out there. As someone mentioned, texture was very different the next day...much more dense and moist. The sour cream's tanginess overpowered the bananas. I could barely taste banana and mine were nearly black; very sweet and ripe. I wonder if Bon Apetit tested this one.

When I first made this bread I was a little disappointed, but letting it sit overnight dramatically improved it's flavor. Delicious. My crust burned a little, so I may cover it for the first 40 min next time but this may be a problem with my particular oven.

this is a great banana bread recipe & falls into the "it's all good" category of recipes- I used buttermilk instead of sour cream, added 1/4 applesauce, cinnamon/ nutmeg/ & vanilla (what? banana bread without vanilla in it? you might as well have Christmas without Santa...). the only things "different" I did from other reviews is toasting the walnuts & sprinkled some turbinado sugar on top for a little crunch- it's all good!

Comfort food at its best! This was as I think banana bread should be: medium dense, fragrant, slightly sweet. I did, though, use 3/4C. granulated sugar, 1/4C. light brown sugar instead of the 1 C. granulated, and added 2 t. lemon juice, 1 t. vanilla, 1/2t. Kosher salt, and 1t. rum extract. This is the best to eat for breakfast!

Simply the best banana bread/cake i have ever had. Great with ice cream! I added more banana than it called for, and added slightly more time, and it came out very gooey and wonderful!

Rating: 3
This recipe is indeed delicious, but it is also way too sweet and terribly fatty. So I've modified the recipe and found a slightly more healthful version that is very flavorful and moist: - replace sour cream with low-fat vanilla yoghurt - recommended baking soda - reduce butter to only 2/3 of 1 stick - reduce to only 1/2 cup of sugar (evaporated cane juice sugar is best) - recommended eggs - add an extra 2 medium sized very dark brown bananas (total of 4) - recommended flour - 2 teaspoons baking powder - 1 teaspoon salt - sprinkle top with cinnamon and nutmeg or cardamom *BAKE AT: 375 for 30 min, then reduce to 350 for 25 minutes. Next time, I'll replace half of the AP flour with whole wheat, reduce baking powder to 1 tspn and will also reduce butter even further. I'm still in need of a delicious vegan, low-fat and low-sugar recipe.

I've never done this before, but this recipe certainly deserves the review. Excellent banana bread. My boyfriend begged me to make it for him, and now he won't stop talking asking when I am going to make it again. There were no problems with the density, and the only change I made to the recipe was to add a dash of pure vanilla. The bananas I had sat on my counter for over a week. Excellent! And it stored wonderfully.

I liked this recipe but didn't love it. It was very moist but didn't seem dense enough. The banana flavor didn't seem to be strong enough but it may have been the bananas that I used. I used dark brown sugar and added 1 teaspoon each of nutmeg and cinnamon. I'll make it again but will tinker with the measurements of the ingredients.

Rating: 2
i only gave this recipe 2 forks because it required so many changes but figured i'd give my changes so someone wanting to make banana bread could make a decent one. First off, I'd put about 4 almost black bananas in. For the reviewers saying there was no banana flavor it must be because the bananas were not black enough to give that intense banana flavor. Also i wouldn't bother with white sugar at all, just use brown. It needs 2 t. of baking powder (so it's not so dense) and 1 t. of soda and 1 t. salt (i'm amazed it didn't have any). 1 t. vanilla and only 1 egg. I use texas muffin pans(extra large!) because i like the crust! :) If you make muffins it only needs 20-25 min on 400. hope this helps!

Rating: 2
I would call this a banana cake, as it lacked the density that I think banana bread should have. I used half & half white/brown sugar, and white/whole wheat flour. It did not hold together well and it definitely needed salt. It make the house smell good, but I was disappointed.

I replaced the sour cream with yogurt. It was the best banana bread I ever tasted. We were ooing and ahhing!

The sourcream and soda give this loaf it's crumb, which I think is perfect. Made 2 loaves, both without nuts (kid's don't like them)but one with 1/2 cup of finely chopped candied ginger which added a perfect little "what IS that?" flavor. finely chopped so that is absorbes moisture and can soften up. This is really the perfect texture and moistness.

Oh yea baby! This is a definate keeper. I took the suggestion of the first reviewier and added a little more sour cream, applesauce and the spices. it took just a few minutes more over an hour to cook, maybe because I'm at a high altitude. I've been cooking for a long time and just could not get banana bread to cook all the way through. This is the first recipe that cooked all the way through and was very moist. Highly recommended.

Rating: 4
Excellent banana-nut bread. However, I added 1 tsp. of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and 1 tsp. vanilla. I also used brown sugar and added a couple extra tablespoons of sour cream. In addition, I used half a cup of applesauce to help with moisture as the batter looked dry. Cooked exactly for one hour and came out perfect! Compliment after compliment from my guests on how moist it was! Held form very good. Made French toast with it in the morning and it was WONDERFUL! Highly recommend.

These are excellent. I have never put sour cream in my banana bread. They come out so moist. I took the advise of one reviewer and used brown sugar. I also added 1 tsp vanilla and 1tsp cinnamon. Also used a combo of walnuts and pecans because I had just enough of each. I doubled the recipe and made them in muffin pans. Cut the cook time in half. This is definately a keeper recipe.

I didn't add any of the additional spices everyone else did, yet I was impressed by how moist and flavorful it tasted. My husband and I ate half a loaf in one morning! However, because I try to avoid eating white flour, I used 1 cup of wheat flour, with one cup of white. Because that worked so well, next time I'll try all wheat.

This is a wonderfully simple and delicious banana bread. I took the advice of other reviews and did add salt and spices, specifically some cinnamon, freshly ground nutmeg and about a teaspoon and a half of whole cloves whirled in a coffee grinder. It needed an additional ten minutes of baking time, as had been suggested. I served it as a breakfast bread with a about a tablespoon of lemon curd on top which made a very nice presentation. Next time I think I'll do the lemon curd, plus a generous shake of powdered sugar with a sprig of mint as an easy do-ahead dessert.

This is a wonderful classic banana bread recipe. (Nonetheless, I couldn't help but add golden raisins, cinnamon, and a bit of ground cloves to the batter, while omitting the nuts because I didn't have any.) I baked it for an extra 10 minutes and the outer layer came out brown and crispy. Perfect!

I make this almost every week, with very overripe bananas. Two critical additions, though. *Add a teaspoon of salt to the flour before mixing. Makes a HUGE difference. *Add a cup of berries, esp the tarter types, raspberries or blackberries, fresh or frozen-and- thawed, to the batter instead of nuts. The piquancy of the berries makes an even better b-bread.

WOW!! This is simply the best recipe I have ever used for banana nut bread. It was so moist, even two days later (and accidentally leaving it on the counter overnight). The second time around I added 1/2 t vanilla, 1/4 t nutmeg and 1 t cinnamon and upped the sour cream to 1/3 cup. It does take about 70 minutes to cook. Definitely a keeper!!

Hi I made it once and thought it was bland, tinkered the second time so much that I probably would just use another recipe next time. The best banana bread I have ever tasted is in a cookbook from a few years ago called "Feasts." Anyway, when I changed this one I made the sugar half light brown and half white, I used 1 1/2 cups masehd bananas, I reduce the nuts to 1/2 cup, and added 1/4 t salt. Better, but much much better the second day after refrigeration.

This banana bread is very mediocre. Yes, everyone liked it, but everyone always likes banana bread. Yes, it was moist, but homemade banana bread usually is. I added the two extra bananas, vanilla, spices, and salt as suggested, still a bit bland. Maybe it would be better with 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 regular. Chopping up the walnuts until they're extremely fine, almost powder, also adds nice consistency. Anyway, I prefer other recipes I've made.

Really good and moist bread. But the bread was far from being done after an hour. I cooked it for 90 minutes at 325F. I also added a pinch of fine french salt to improove the taste.

I live at an elevation of about 3500 ft. and this recipe came out very dry. If I were to use it again, I would need to make some adjustments for higher elevation. Also, I found I could taste the baking soda in the final product and that was very unappetizing. My eight year old son thought it was pretty funky how the baking soda made the sour cream volume increase though!

I'm addicted to this receipe, my coworkers and husband LOVE IT.

With the addition of 1 tsp. of vanilla 3 mashed bananas, 1/2 cup flaked coconut & a maple flavored glaze -I ended up with a banana cake my mother has been making for over 50 years. Easy & delicious!

I found this recipe to be very good. The bread has a good texture, slices beautifully, and has a good banana flavor, although I did use 3 bananas. Like another reviewer, I too added a teaspoon of vanilla.

I love this recipe!! I have made a few changes...I've added 1 tbl of Vanilla Extract to the baking soda, to take the edge off of it. Just recently, I've started using self rising flour. That makes it less dense.

I used whole milk plain yogurt instead of sour cream and it was moist and yummy. Use as many bananas as you can (I used extras and it could still use more) and definitely add the brown sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla extract. Delish!

This recipe was good, but not great. The lavish praise from other cooks makes me suspect that I did something wrong. Mine came out a bit dry and bready; I was hoping for a moister, richer, almost cakelike banana bread.

I altered the recipe using a couple of others' suggestions. I used 1/2C brown and 1/2C regular sugar, added 1 tsp. vanilla and substituted creme fraiche for the sour cream. It was great!!!!!!

With a few changes I made this bread into something my picky girlfriend LOVED. She devoured most of the loaf in 2 days. The changes were: used 1/2 cup packed brown sugar and 1/2 cup white, I added 1/2 t vanilla and 1/4 t cinnamon, I omitted the nuts and added about 8 oz of semi-sweet mini chocolate chips. Also I used 3 black, previously frozen banannas that came to just over 1 cup when mashed. I find it to be an excellent starter bread for playing around with ingredients. Next I plan to reduce the choco chips and add chunky peanut butter. Yum!

A really good basic recipe. Even the half a loaf I froze and thawed tasted delicious. It's now my official banana bread recipe.

I was disappointed with this bread the day I made it, but the next day it was the best I'd ever had. I recommend letting this one cool for a day before you eat it. My husband said it was as good as his grandmother's (the ultimate compliment)!

This is my favorite banana bread recipe on this site. I substituted organic whole wheat flour for the white flour, and used organic brown sugar instead of white sugar. And, I sprinkled walnuts (organic of course) on the top before putting in the oven. It was awesome.

After 4 or 5 batches of this fabulous moist bread, it's the proven best. We like dates in it, and of course taking the time to toast the nuts before adding them to the batter is another good idea. Save this recipe.

I tripled the batch and made muffins and loaves. I left out the nuts. I had so much that I gave it away to friends and they all asked for a recipe.

This is a great basic recipe for banana bread. I like it better than the other one on Epicurious website. I think the consistancy is better and the sour cream and butter make it less bland. Add vanilla!

This recipe was well received. It is very moist, I made some adjustments to add more flavor. I used half granulated and half brown sugar, added vanilla and cinnamon. I used macadamia nuts instead. I also made it again using chocolate chips and chocolate macadamia nuts.

This is banana bread was wonderful. Moist and delicious. I substituted yogurt for the sour cream, used 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of white, and added three very ripe bananas (almost black). Coarsely chopped walnuts made it crunchy and good. This is the reciped I'll use from now on!

I love this recipe, it is the best, moist easy, and very tasty. I make it at least twice a month, everyone that I serve it to raves about it. I put together a cookbook of my favorite recipes, just for family and friends, I will add this to my collection. It is a keeper. Thank you. Z

Not the ultimate Banana Bread recipe, but pretty good. Everyone who tried it wanted the recipe.

I made a few modifications to the recipe and it got rave reviews from my guests. I subsituted macadamia nuts in the recipe, brushed the bread with a hot syrup made from rum and sugar when it came out of the oven, and topped it with a rum-laced confectioners sugar drizzle and dried tropical fruits.

This is the first time I made banana bread and it came out very good. I used 3 bananas, added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 cup of brown sugar (on the advise of other reviews). I would have added vanilla but I didn't have any. I love nuts so 1 cup was good enough for me although I do understand that it is alot for people who aren't crazy about them. It came out moist and more importantly, my husband loved it!

This recipie is delicious with the following changes - double the recipie - increase the banana by 1/2 cup, add 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2 tsp cinnamon, 2 tsp vanilla extract, and use walnuts & pecans - this makes about 18 cupcakes and 1 large loaf - delicious!!!!

Had this recipe for 2 years. Everyone rates this recipe as the best banana bread they've eaten. I can't understand why some people say it doesn't have enough banana flavor. Mine has a lot of banana flavor and is very moist. I have tried a lot of banana bread recipes, but this recipe is the best of all that I have tried in the past. I omitted the nuts because I prefer not to have nuts in my banana bread. I have to say that this recipe is better than the other banana breads purchased at reputable coffee shops and upscale bakeries in the bay area. The key to having good banana flavor is having overripe black bananas. The key for a moist bread is not to overmix.

Used three bananas instead of two and used 1/2 cup chopped nuts. Came out moist and flavorful. Would defintely make it again. Would probably used a full cup of nuts. This is the first banana bread I'm making so don't know if there is anything better.

I hate to rain on everyone's parade but this is just your standard regular banana bread. Betty Crocker's recipe is just as good. I liked it but don't see what the big deal is about this recipe. My search for the ultimate recipe will continue.

I make at least one loaf of this bread for my family every week. Everyone from my 19-month old to my husband LOVES it! I use three ripe bananas and only one egg. The best banana bread I've ever made BY FAR!

this was very yummy, but could have used a touch of cinnamon and vanilla. i also would have liked it a tad sweeter. maybe it's due to my little oven, but it took about 80 minutes to cook. all the same, everyone agreed it was délicieux!

This is a good recipe and I have tried many many different ones. The sourcream makes it rich and moist. I did add just a bit more banana and also added a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract. I made a bunch of mini loaves and gave it away for the holidays. Nothing but raves!

I found this recipe today and made it this evening for a High Tea I am planning the week before Christmas. I have several Banana Bread recipes but this one has surpassed them all. Just the right amount of banana - I did add 1 tsp. orange rind. I like the flat effect - looks nice on a serving plate. We don't have 'all purpose flour' here in the Netherlands and I used a cake flour.

I made this recipe when it was first printed in Bon Appetite. My fiance and my boss (the reciprients of most of the bread) always enjoyed it, however I always felt it could use more banana flavor. Because it was a baking recipe, I never tried to adjust anything. This is the first time I have seen this recipe on this site. My thanks to the tips from the previous reviewers. I'll be trying them this weekend!

A little crumbly, but good. I added 1 t. cinnamon, and thought about adding a pinch of salt, but didn't (was surprised it didn't call for it).

I used non-fat sour cream and did not have enough bananas so I added a half of cup of chopped pitted prunes that I had on hand. The recipe came out great and probably could have reduce the sugar by at least a quarter of a cup. Very rich tasting.

I thought this was not very good. I did use fat free sour cream, but really felt their was not much taste at all and not very moist. Toad

A moist dense bread with good flavor,it's somewhat oily however. I would prefer a higher rising more rounded loaf. Children love it with the addition of 1/2 cup chocolate chips.

This bread is idiot-proof! It's SO easy and SO delicious! Impress your friends & family. I also add some extra mashed banana and dice up the walnuts in a mini food processor. I buy extra bananas now just to have an excuse to make it -- yummy!!

This has become my favorite banana bread recipe. I think the sour cream (I used fat free) must be the secret key to extra moistness. I also added 2 T of freshly grated orange zest, and about 1/4 cup fresh squeezed orange juice. I used an extra 1/2 a banana and an extra 1/3 cup walnuts, just to use what I had. The hint of orange blended nicely with the banana. This will be the only banana bread I make from now on.

I tried the recipe and didn't have any sour cream on hand and used buttermilk instead. I also forgot to add the eggs, but it turned out wonderful! This is not one of your ordinary banana bread recipes.

I have been making banana bread for years, with plenty of good results. This recipe is now officially added to my "keepers" list, as the bread was great! I ended up adding the full cup of nuts (I like it nutty!), and had to bake it about 1 hour and 15 minutes, but it was WORTH it! The sour cream really added depth to it!

Rating: 3
Wow! Easy and yummy! The only little problem was that I used a glass pan, and, after an hour at 350, it was golden on the outside and not at all done in the middle. So I turned down the heat to 325, baked another 20 or so minutes til the tester came out clean. It didn't burn and, boy, was the crust DELISH!!! I don't usually like banana bread - it is usually too dense and heavy. But this was surprisingly good, and not too heavy. This was my first banana-nut bread ever!!! And I shall definitely be making it again.

Very good! Extremely moist though I used margarine. Made it with two and a half large bananas. Added it to my list of favorite recipes.

very moist,i added three bananas aand it was much moister than just adding two.I thought 1 c. nuts was to much.I used 1/2 cup and i thought it was just the right amount.If you want it sweeter you can add a chocolate frosting but some people do not like really sweet things after a big meal.

I doubled the recipe and put the batter into 3 small loaf pans. I found the recipe was good but nothing special. Next time I will add more bananas and maybe not chop them up as much and see if this makes a difference.

This is a great basic recipe for banana bread. It is very easy to follow with wonderful results. Nuts are not a favorite in my household, so I substitute the same amount of chocolate chips for nuts. I also add an extra banana. The extra banana adds about 15 minutes to your cooking time, but it is well worth it!
