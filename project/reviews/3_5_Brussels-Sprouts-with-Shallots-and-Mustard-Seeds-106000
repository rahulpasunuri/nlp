Too much fuss. Just boil brussels in salted water until fork tender, shock and serve with Malt Vinegar. That's all you need for perfect sprouts.

This is an outstanding recipe! We don't do brussels sprouts often, but needed something a bit different to go with the Wood Smoked Tri Tip. This was perfect. We made no changes at all in the recipe. It was quick and easy. Several of our guests went right into the kitchen to grab seconds.

My wife loves this recipe. It's very easy and we will be making for the Eastert/Passover dinner this year.

This recipe was surprisingly good... it added to the flavor of the brussels sprouts without covering it up. My boyfriend even liked them and he is a self-defined brussels sprouts HATER! This was a perfect side to pork!

We made both this recipe and the one for pan-browned brussels sprouts. The pan-browned version won, as the brussel sprouts in this recipe were a little too soft for our taste. Still these were good and I would give these three and a half stars if it were possible.

This was, suprisingly, very good. Make the dish ahead and warmed it up in to oven to save on last minute preparation. People were coming back for seconds and my sister-in-law had the leftovers for breakfast

great sprouts recipe. I used a mini chop for the shallots, and next time would thinly slice them instead of finely chopping. Otherwise very, very tasty and all was eaten.

Spectacular! My advice is to choose your mustard like you would wine: I used a blend of mustards, including dijon, danish hot, and a tangy stone-ground from Hediards in Paris. I served this at Thxgvg and even the hardened anti-sprout folks went for seconds.

I love this recipe. I am not a Brussels Sprouts fan but they look so beautiful at the markets here and this recipe makes them taste as good as they look! A definite keeper!!!

Quick and easy, but not very tasty. My husband and I both love brussels sprouts, and his comment was "Next time, just boil 'em!".

We call this "Brussel sprout candy" at our house... Great flavors, very simple. This could change the mind of a non-Brussel sprout eater!

The flavors are very nice and well integrated in this recipe. Its flavors are simple and compliment the brussel sprouts well. (I'd give it 4 forks, but I prefer bolder flavors). I especially liked the hint of lemon and the dijon mustard. I used brown mustard seeds, but couldn't get them to pop after several minutes of cooking, and even after turning up the heat. None the less, it turned out very nicely. It's a simple dish - it only took me about 15 minutes to prepar and I'm enjoying it now for lunch.

This is a wonderful dish and it looks attractive as well. I took the advice of another reviewer and left out the dijon as I was serving the dish with turkey. I also cut the brussel sprouts in half lengthwise and find that this helps them cook faster. A definite addition to my receipe box.

This was an extremely easy recipe to follow and to prepare. Once it has been done it can be done quickly without a lot of fuss.

If you love brussels sprouts, this is a great dish! If you like "do ahead" dishes, this is a good one. I ommited the dijon mustard because I was serving this with Cornish Game Hens with Sweet Potato Risotto and Cranberry Sauce (you can find this on Epicurious) and didn't want the intense mustard flavor...the mustard seeds were the perfect amount of flavor!

Very easy. Very tasty. Just remember to dry the brussel sprouts as soon as you ice them (lest they get water laden).

Thanks to this recipe, I now make brussel sprouts more often as a side dish, which I would never dream of before. Delicious!

A wonderful way to prepare brussel sprouts. Even my husband (a member of the anti-vegetables league) finished his plate. But, they definitely needed some salt.

This dish was very easy and yummy.

Quite a few people seem not to like brussels sprouts. I think it may be because they're frequently overcooked, and mushy brussels sprouts are not nice at all. This is a very good and easy recipe; also simple to make half of it for fewer servings. This will be one of my standard recipes for this vegetable, which seems to taste best in fall and winter.

Very tasty! I love the flavor of freshly toasted mustard seeds. This dish tasted better right off the stove, rather than later when it had to be reheated (still yummy).

I really liked these brussel sprouts. The dish was completely eaten Christmas day with no leftovers.

I made this for Christmas dinner, and it was delicious. The brussels sprouts stayed crisp, but cooked - no mushy. And the mustard seeds, mustard and lemon made it great.

Made with the English Menu recipe and picked some of the most beautiful Brussel Sprouts from the stem I have ever seen. They were beautiful to behold, when cooked, but I think we undercooked them just a little. Our family, 17, loves vegies, and they disappeared during the meal, but the essence of brussel wasn't quite there. Again, another minute or two in the wok might have turned the trick. I have tried another similar recipe with a country mustard to a greater degree of success.

A fairly easy and tasty way to prepare brussels sprouts - the flavors blend together nicely, and it can be thrown together at the last minute. Will make again.
