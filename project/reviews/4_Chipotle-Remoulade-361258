This is delicious. I put it on sub sandwiches that I made with cajun turkey breast, pepper jack cheese and carmelized onions put on par baked sourdough bread. Added tomato and put it in the oven for 15 minutes at 400. YUM!!!

If you had a ten fork rating, I'd go with that. This was so simple and so fabulous I'm thinking of things to serve it with.

Was a nice difference from standard remoulade or cocktail sauce on shrimp. Mild tasting, the heat builds a bit. I think it would be better with some diced shallots or scallions.

You have to click on "chipotle remoulade" at the end of the ingredient list on the shrimp recipe to get the remoulade recipe!!!

I make a sauce almost exactly like this one except I use half mayo and half sour cream and everyone LOVES it. Funny I never thought of using it for shrimp but I will now.
