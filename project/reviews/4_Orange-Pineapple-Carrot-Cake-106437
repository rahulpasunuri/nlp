I made this recipe for christmas dinner. It was fantastic. It is my new goto recipe for carrot cake. It is very dense and moist. I made it exactly as written with one exception, I added a 1/2 cup of sweetened coconut flakes. I found the orange and pineapple combination worked very well together. The orange in the frosting was subtle and quite nice. What really got me with this cake was the mouth texture. It had just the perfect amount of 'chew' to it. I used sharp cornered 9x13 pan and a baked in foil sling to help extract the cooled cake from the pan. I put it (inverted) on the back of a 1/2 sheet pan since I don't have a large rectangular plate. There was plenty enough frosting for the top and sides.

This is an AMAZING recipe! I don't understand why everyone is always trying to change things....use a sheet pan like it says! I've made it several times and it makes too much frosting, so I suggest only one package of cream cheese, otherwise it's delicious!!!!!!!!

I made this cake years ago and thought it was ok. Tried it again for easter (party of 12) and it was a big flop! Only mistake I made was I forgot to thaw the concentrate. I made the cake in 9" pans and they turned out flat. The frosting never really set up and was too orangey. Just a big yuck. I'd stick with a basic carrot cake next time.

I have baked two of these now and will be adopting this as my go-to carrot cake recipe. It is incredibly moist, a wonderful consistency, and delicious. I have made the following tweaks: 1) I don't care for raisins, so I omitted them; 2) I substituted walnuts in place of the macadamia nuts; 3) instead of butter I used 4 ounces of Smart Balance in the frosting; 4) I reduced the powdered sugar in the icing from 2 to 1½ cups; 5) I used just a little juice concentrate in the icing, for the warm color and hint of fruit (I wanted to essentially keep a traditional cream cheese frosting); 6) Instead of a 13 x 9 inch pan, I used two 9 inch round cake pans and assembled it as a round double layer cake; there is easily enough icing for top, middle, and sides. In this configuration it bakes in about 35 minutes.

This cake was real moist, my family really loved it and have requested it for Xmas dinner. The only thing I added was vanilla and coconut extract.

The cake was good except all of the solid bits, raisins and pineapple, sunk to the bottom of the cake. I found the icing a bit odd. Next time I will make a standard cream cheese icing and add some orange zest to it.

the Review below is mine---NOW 3 hours out of oven TheCakeIsFine. no overwhelming Orange, just NOM-Delish. twist

Rating: 3
the recipe was too "orange-y"...using concentrated juice, well, it resonated in my sinuses afterward. Also I used only 3/4 the required sugar--still too sweet. Substituted coconut for raisins (can't get my head around macadamia nuts and anything but pineapple and coconut.) Raisins? give me a reason. Otherwise--will tweek and make again.

So this is my first carrot cake, and it was pretty good. The cake was very moist and I was worried slightly that the orange- pineapple flavor would over power the cake. It did not. I followed the recipe as written and I feel that it does not need any adjustments to stand on its own. But be warned one review stated that her cake was done in 30 minutes, I am guessing her oven was set incorrectly. My oven usually bakes things quicker than the recipe calls for, however after 30 mins the cake was really not ready. I would check it after 40 minutes, but that is just my oven. Oh yeah and one of my coworkers who normally does not like cream cheese frosting said that it was the best cream cheese frosting he has ever had.

4-5 oz. and increase the carrot by half => to 3 cups. Use straight orange juice (would allow carrot flavor to come through more) instead of pineapple-orange. Also I would add some additional flavors: cloves and allspice, grated orange zest and maybe a little fresh ginger to make the flavor more layered and complex. I made the cake without nuts and I think that was a mistake. Next time I would make the cake with.

This cake is absolutely delicious. I made it for our gourmet group. The macademian nuts add a special crunch to the whole thing.

The best I've ever made or eaten!!! I did alter the recipie a tad the second time I made it, and have been making it this way ever since: I substituted 1 cup of coconut for the 1/2 cup of raisins, and also substituted 1 cup of coarsly chopped toasted walnuts for the 1/2 cup of macadamia nuts. Play with the recipie and make it your trademark dessert like I did.

I loved this cake! Everyone thought that it was the best carrot cake that they had ever tasted and they all wanted the recipe! I used 1/4 c. applesauce with 1/4 c. oil because I prefer a less oily cake. I used walnuts because I always have them in my kitchen, but the macadamia nuts sound interesting and I will try them next time. I also used the orange cream cheese frosting from this site and it was wonderful! It really kicked up the orange flavor and the flecks of zest in the frosting looked pretty. Even my husband , who doesn`t really like cream cheese frosting, loved this. Try this cake! You won`t be disappointed!

This is the best cake ever! I even substituted applesauce for the oil and omitted nuts and it is amazingly moist.

This is the most delicious carrot cake ever!! Incredibly moist and tasty. Don't skip the macadamia nuts, they add a great crunch and flavor. Trader Joe's sells them at a very reasonable price. Toasted walnuts would also work. Watch the cake closely though! Mine only took about 35 mins to bake even though the recipe says 50 mins. So set your timer for 30 mins and check periodically after that.

This is a delicious, moist carrot cake...love the addition of pineapple. I used walnuts instead of macadamias and only used 1-1/2 cups of sugar (not 2 cups) and it was plenty sweet enough! Icing was a bit runny so added more powdered sugar...a keeper!

Hands down, this is the best carrot cake recipe ever. It may not be low fat, low carb, etc., but why not live a little. I couldn't find the pineapple-orange concentrate, so I just used the juice in the can. This is a huge recipe, so you end up with a big cake. I baked mine in an 9x8 pan and layered it. Yummy!!!!!!!

This is absolutely fabulous. The pineapple orange juice concentrate really sets it off, especially in the icing. It is a big hit with family and friends.

I made this for a friend's birthday and was surprised at how easily it came together. Like some other reviews, I just used pineapple - no orange - and substituted 1/2 the oil with applesauce. I baked in a bundt pan, and it took a little longer than called for here. This makes a moist, hearty cake that isn't too sweet. The cream cheese frosting complements it perfectly. Everyone at the party loved it, and it went really fast. I would highly recommend this, especially to a baker who is new to baking cakes from scratch.

Now that I have made this cake four times, I can honestly say that it is the second-best cake I have ever had (the first is the double chocolate cake on this site). Although I used one large can of crushed pinapple and no orange, it was still delicious! The frosting is fantastic (think spreadable cheesecake)!

This is the best carrot cake ever. I made this for my boyfriend for his birthday. It is so moist and the frosting is yummy.

Ro will enjoy this every year for his birtday!!

OH - MY - GOODNESS!!! I was looking for a really different cake to enter in a Bake-Off for my job. I made this cake and used walnuts in the cake, as well as, in the icing. I WON!!!! Out of 45 entries, this cake stood out above the rest. A colleague told me that she tried it for Thanksgiving and her large family was crazy about it so now she and I will make this throughout the year. Fantastic cake!

I made this as a bundt cake for my book club and the ladies went wild over it. Several said it was the best carrot cake they've had! I substituted 1/4 c. applesauce for some of the oil, as I usually try to do on heavier cakes, and I used golden raisins. The frosting was yummy too. This one's a keeper.

One of the best carrot cakes. Added crushed pineapple between the layers and lemon juice and lemon zest to the frosting.

I made this cake with walnuts, did not drain my pineapple, and omitted the raisins. I did not use the metal pan specified, i used an 9 x 13 emile henry dish. the cake was very dense, but not flat at all. the flavor was absolutely divine! I think that next time i will add a bit of toasted coconut to the batter.This was a huge hit with my family and i am already getting requests for more cakes.

Outstanding carrot cake. Don't worry about the frozen orange-pineapple juice concentrate. Just use the pineapple juice that you get when you drain the crushed pineapple, add a little water if it's not quite enough.

loved this recipe..could dust the pan with flour so it turns out easier but the real key to the frosting is letting it rest for a couple hours before frosting it will be so much more workable.

Made this for Easter and thought it was fabulous. Great traveler -- kept in the car for 5 hours and iced it on arrival. Made cake as written except used 3/4 c. juice concentrate in the cake instead of dividing it as written. Cake turned out very moist and dense. Would definitely make again. Note: My grocery showed Dole Pineapple-Orange juice concentrate marked as a "discontinued" item.

I'm on cloud 9 - received so many compliments at tonight's party for something so simple to make! Love the moist fruity flavors. The only change I made was to reduce the amount of sugar, and used walnuts.

I modified the recipe slightly by using walnuts, rather than macadamia nuts. I also added 1/2 cup coconut and 1 Granny Smith Apple (peeled and chopped). When I made the icing, I used 3 cups powdered sugar. As the previous cook noted, the icing does seem runny, however, all you need to do is refrigerate it for a bit. Don't frost the cake until it has completely cooled, then place the frosted cake back into the fridge. The end result was fabulous! The cake by itself reminds me of "Morning Glory" Bread and tastes just grand all by itself. My family is licking the plate on this one, and there will be no left-overs. I will make this many more times!

I received several compliments on the cake, but it was merely good, not great. I did use walnuts instead of macadamia nuts, but I don't think that made the difference. I thought it should have been more carroty. I liked the flavor of the icing, but I found the consistency to be too runny, despite adding extra powdered sugar. I will keep looking.

My husband made this for my birthday and it's FABULOUS! It's kept well in the frig for a week and is super moist. We had extra frosting, but I wouldn't halve the recipe as another reader suggested. We used the leftover frosting (about 1/2 c.) on some cinnamon rolls.

This cake is so delicious and so moist! The hardest part of this recipe is grating the carrots. It comes together so easily. The only change I would make next time is to halve the frosting recipe. I had WAY too much frosting leftover.

I made this cake for a dinner party some friends of mine were having. It was the hit of the party. Never have I received as many compliments as I did with this cake (which was slightly embarassing to the hosts). I did have to cook the cake longer than what the recipe called for.

This is a delicious recipe which is very easy to make. I made the recipe exactly to the directions. I made this for my girlfriend's birthday dinner party. Men and women loved the cake. This is an easy recipe if you follow the directions and do not use substitutions. I used a food processor to grate the carrots. I used a whole bag of carrots. To make the frosting stick to the cake, I had the cream cheese and butter at refrigerator temperature and I added a little more orange pineapple juice. I am making this again very soon for another party.

My son asked for a carrot cake for his birthday and never having made one before I tried this one. Everyone who tasted it said it was great and my son's best friend said it was the best one he had ever tasted. Since then I have had to make it several more times due to popular demand and now my wife's office wants one. Now I just have to break down and buy a food processor because grating that many carrots by hand is ravaging my knuckles.

I also substituted applesauce for sugar which may have not been such a good idea, because combined with the orange and pineapple tastes in the recipe, it was more a fruity cake than a carrot cake. I guess I'm a purist and like the more traditional carrot cake recipe. The icing, however, was perfect (I used the amount of powdered sugar specified because I don't like icing that is too sweet.)

I made this recipe exactly as written...except as noted, 2 cups of powdered sugar has to be a misprint (I took 4 cups to get frosting to hold its shape). This was a good cake, but not phenomenal...if you notice, it appears that no one other than the cook from Coral Gables actually made the recipe. So an adapted version may be great; the orginal is just good. Am still searching for a great carrot cake.

OUTRAGEOUS! I was making it for children, so I substituted applesauce for the sour cream, cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, and the oil to 1/3 and it still turned out great.

I'm always on a search for the best carrot cake, and this one is as close as I've found. They usually have way too much oil. Even with just 1/2 cup, I subsituted 1/4 cup with applesauce, and did not think the cake suffered for it. Using 2 9" pans, they cooked in 35-40 minutes. It made very nice, dense layers. I also increased the frosting to have enough to cover the layers, using 16 oz of cream cheese, but could not get the frosting to firm up enough to really hold. Even chilling the frosting before spreading didn't firm it up. The frosting was great with the juice in it, but I'll have to play with proportions next time to make it firm enough to frost layers. I loved the macadamias in it, but thought they were lost in the cake. To extend the flavor, I pressed chopped nuts around the sides. My daughter also had fun making marzipan carrots for the top to complete the presentation!

Hi I made the following changes to the basic recipe for the cake, I reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup, to 1 and 3/4 cups; I left out the raisins I used chopped pecans I used frozen pineapple juice concentrate, not orange pineapple. I baked it in two 9" pans for about 35-40 minutes. Cake is very moist and flavorful,ever-so-slightly too "wet" perhaps, but it's a wonderful dessert. I would have given it 4 forks, but I hold that back for some divine creation I haven't tasted yet. 3.75 would be about right. For the frosting, I wanted to be sure I had enough to put some between the layers. Using the basic recipe, I increased the cream cheese to two complete 8 oz packages,reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup, and added two additional tablespoons of thawed concentrate, for a total of 3/8 cup concentrate in the frosting. It was perfect in my opinion. Sweet but not too much so, subtle pineapple flavor, spread easily but not runny, refrigerated beautifully.

This cake was no less than perfect...and the frosting was to die for...will use frosting recipe and maybe flavor with other concentrates on many future cakes!

Very delicious & easy cake to make. I substituted pecans for the macadamia nuts and used pineapple concentrate instead of orange pineapple. Next time I might add a bit more cinnamon. Also, I bought a larger tin of crushed pineapple which was left over so I added some to the cream cheese icing & it was very good - just a hint of pineapple. Will definitely make this again. It makes a huge cake. Thanks George from Hawaii's Mother !!

I made this cake for a summertime barbecue for friends, and it was absolutely fantastic! It was a nice light finish to a somewhat heavy meal of burgers, dogs, potato salad, and beans. Everyone raved that it was so moist, light, and flavorful. I brought leftovers to the office, and my coworkers agreed. The citrus cream-cheese frosting adds a nice, creamy richness to this light cake. I omitted the raisins, as did another reviewer, and added more macadamia nuts. To top it off, the cake is a cinch to make. This one is a definite keeper!

I just made this for a Memorial Day BBQ a nd everyone LOVED it. The only change that I made was that I used walnuts because that is what I had on hand.

I made this with a few substitutions. I made 5 mini loaves, without icing (with the thought of it being healthier... ha ha...) I reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup and used pecans instead of macadamia nuts. The result was great. I love pineapple in carrot cake, it's unbelievable. I would suggest skipping the pineapple orange juice and leaving the pineapple undrained.

George this is a great recipe! I am a chef but haven't made carrot cakes very often. I made this one for my husband's birthday. Didn't have all the ingredients, so substituted consentrated orange/pineapple for pure orange juice. Yoghurt for sour cream, walnuts for macadamia nuts and it worked out just great. I certainly will make it again.

This sounded wonderful, so I made it this past weekend with good results. I omitted the raisins and nuts from the cake and also used Dole Orange Pineapple Banana frozen juice. The cake was tasty, but the frosting ROCKS!! Even if I don't make the cake again, that frosting will reappear in various incarnations from my kitchen!
