Forgot to say - see below - I doubled the recipe, hence the large amount of liquid.

For the garlic broth, I used 6 cups of water and 3 cups of turkey broth. For the greens, I used kale instead of chard. Came out very well - I will make it again.

What a simple, fast and flavorful meal! I'm on a pre-summer diet and looking for healthy eating options. Anchovies for depth of flavor, white beans and chard for delicacy. I could drink gallons of this lovely, savory broth. I doubled the garlic and left it in, used canned cannellini beans, and homemade low sodium chicken broth. I used far less oil than the recipe called for (1 tbsp). I omitted the salt as the beans were already salty enough and omitted the macaroni.

Easy, quick and tasty. Some hot pepper flakes would be a nice addition.

So good! The flavor was very rich which surprised me for a soup that was so quick to prepare. I too did minor changes -- anchovy paste, 1/4C olive oil, 1 tsp fresh rosemary, whole can of white beans, 5 C broth and orzo -- changes were 'adjustments' to the ingredient amounts. Don't skip the anchovy -- it's the base of the wonderful flavor. I couldn't understand why the recipe would have you cook the chard separately before adding to soup mixture, so I followed the recommendation to sautee the garlic (about 1 minute) then add rosemary & anchovy and swiss chard -- when chard was slightly wilted added broth and remaining ingredients. I also add rind of pecorino-romano cheese. Will definitely make again -- for family and friends.

Loved this soup! Minor changes--used some anchovy paste instead of the fillets and about 1/4 cup olive oil (half was scented with herbs de provence). I think I could have eaten it all in one sitting! Maybe it's the anchovies, or maybe it's higher than usual amount of olive oil, or maybe it was that beautiful fresh rainbor swiss chard I got from the farmer's market--this soup had a rich mouth feel and left me feeling extremely satisfied. I'll do this one often over the fall/winter season.

Great basic recipe, which I've followed exactly as well as deviated from slightly, all to great results. I never have rosemary on hand so tend to leave that out, and I use anchovy paste from a tube which I keep in the fridge. You can skip the pre-cooking of the greens as they'll cook just fine in the broth, even thick greens like cavolo nero. I always use vegetable stock. The one thing I always find is that the broth is not sufficient, so use at least 5 cups of stock.

Eh. It was more like a stew than soup, and it tasted better when I added the Parmesan. I added stellina[very fine, tiny pasta} I won't make again.

Made this soup for the first time tonight and it was exceptional. I added 5 garlic cloves as advised by other users as well as 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper. I would make this again in an instant...literally, because it was so easy.

This was wonderful! I used 5 cloves of garlic and 5 red onions for a huge bunch of chard. I followed the rest of the recipe but substitued chickpeas for the beans and at the end I added a heaping soup spoon of tomato paste, some red pepper flakes and a little balsamic. Delicious!

I LOVE this soup. Whenever the weather turns a bit chilly I find myself craving this delicious go to meal. I have made it countless times now and I have made a few tweaks to improve on it. First of all I DO NOT DISCARD the garlic! Who would do such a thing? Secondly, I use ANCHOVY PASTE instead of real anchovy fillets. It's easier, tastes great and seems like such a waste of a can of anchovy for just 2 fillets. A tube of paste lasts forever in the fridge! Lastly, I add chicken apple sausage at the end when all other ingredients have been combined. Usually chicken apple sausage comes fully cooked. I simply chop it up and throw it in. It makes for a heartier soup and adds a great element of sweet and savory. Also, I love to serve this soup with grilled cheese sandwiches on nice rustic bread - DEELISH!

Good recipe for alterations. Made a vegan version which is fantastic! Subbed the anchovies with capers and cumin, sauted the chard after the garlic and rosemary, and did the pasta seperately so the chard wouldn't over cook. Added the beans last. Served with crusty bread. Awesome filling, but not heavy soup.

Rating: 4
One problem - volumes reflect serving the soup as a main dish. If as appetizer, one recipe will serve 6-8. If made with water instead of stock, it needs the Parmesan to balance and complete the flavors (or slightly more anchovy).

this soup is so gooooood! have done with both kale and swiss chard, equally good depending on what is available. we add turkey sausage crumbled up for some extra stockiness to the soup and we leave the macaroni out and eat with a good, crusty bread. yum!

Good Stuff. I never understand remove the garlic, so did not. Also did not cook the chard prior to putting in the soup-what a waste of effort and simply cannot think of a reason to do it especially if you use the reserved liquid. No shell macaroni on so used some alphabet soup pasta (orzo would be even better I think)as would the addition of parmasean rind as suggested by others. I also added some diced chicken thigh to make it a little more hearty for main course. Will definitly be making again when I have chard from the garden or CSA

Rating: 3
Very good; I think the leftovers will be even better tomorrow. I kept the quantities but changed the cooking order (needed dinner fast and didn't want to overcook the greens): washed and chopped the chard, set aside, sliced garlic and sauteed for a moment with a few flakes of red pepper, added anchovies/rosemary, then chard--coated it in oil then added beans, broth, and orzo. Cooked until orzo was tender. Voila! I agree with many other reviewers: I would NOT boil the chard beforehand. And the anchovies are a must.

I added a couple carrots and used kale as one reviewer suggested. I also used 4 cloves of chopped garlic which I left in the soup. This was so different from most of the soups I make. My husband and I loved it!

Excellent soup, and so easy. Substituted tarragon for rosemary, and used chard from the front-yard garden. Don't be afraid of the anchovies...they make the broth taste rich, not fishy! Didn't pre-cook the chard, and it was just fine...

Delicious soup. I used kale & orzo and followed reviewers' great suggestions to add the kale along with the beans instead of cooking it first and to keep the garlic in.

Love this soup - I have made it a number of times before. I always mince the garlic and leave it in. I do not add salt and double the amount of beans. I do recommend holding off adding the beans if you want to cook the chard a little longer. They tend to burst and get mushy if you leave them to cook too long.

Amazing and so easy! You do not taste the anchovies - they just add depth. I added a carrot for a hint of sweetness and did not parboil the kale but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Next time I will add a bit more rosemary and no salt - very salty as is! A great, quick and healthy meal, perfect for weekdays.

Rating: 3
Fast and easy. One note of caution: the chard was looking really green and nice before I put the pasta in, and then the pasta took long enough that the greens started to get overcooked. I might avoid the first round of cooking the greens next time, and just put them in the same time as everything else.

I made this following the instructions, but I used red and green swiss chard, rolled anchovies, and fresh rosemary on a stem that I removed before serving. I served it with garlic herb crescent rolls. Next time I would double the beans

What a delicious soup for the simplicity of the ingredients. Made a few changes as others suggested -- skipped cooking the chard in water first and added it to the oil/rosemary/anchovymixture, coating it with the oil mixture and wilting it for about 2 - 3 minutes. Also, minced the garlic and left it in. I used a whole can (14.5 oz.) of northern white beans instead of just one cup (hate having just a few leftover beans)and threw in a Parmesand rind with the broth. Since I used an organic low-sodium chicken broth, it did need just a touch of course sea salt as seasoning. Simple and delicious!

Rating: 4
This soup was fantastic!I used red chard which was just fine, and my stock has plenty of salt so I didn't add any extra. I also doubled the pasta (used a whole wheat tri-color variety) to make it more of a meal but if it were just a first course I'd go with the more liquidy variety. one mistake I made is making it in advance...this soup wants to be served right away before the greens cook down too much.

Rating: 0
Served this soup as part of a Catalan themed New Year's Eve meal. Since my menu had 8 courses (yessss I was veddy ambitious that night :D) I deleted the pasta, beans, anchovy and Parmesan cheese. Used the garlic broth (subbing chicken stock for the water) and double the amt of chard. Used way more garlic...probably double the amount. Final result? A light bright soup garnished with a lemon slice. I'll be making this again with all the called for ingredients for sure.

Loved it! And, despite my recent self-discipline of not automatically messing with every recipe I try, I seized this opportunity as a good one to throw in some parmigiano reggiano rinds while the soup was cooking. I'd been meaning to try this forever. I'm glad I did--the results were amazing, and even better the next day. So if you have some p.r. rinds, by all means use 'em, but if not don't worry--the broth is super-tasty even without. Cheers, and happy eatings.

Probably the best soup I've ever made. I really, really love this. The broth is wonderful - the anchovies have to be what makes this soup. Although, I need to say that I did take previous reviewers' suggestions and used anchovy paste to make it quicker for me. Also, I coarsely chopped the garlic after mashing them and didn't bother taking them out. As already stated, 10 minutes is too long to saute the garlic. I also added a couple of coarsely chopped carrots for color, which I boil in water for a minute or two before I put the kale in with it. I also haven't found the need to add any extra salt - the anchovy paste adds plenty for my taste. Get the pre-bagged and washed kale to make this even speedier. This soup tastes like it has simmered all day long and tastes like there should have been ten things to chop, but it is so simple to make.

Rating: 4
I love this soup. I bought anchovies (a food I'd never eaten before) specially for this recipe, and I must say, as someone completely put off by the overwhelming pong of those little, slimy fish, that in this dish they are divine. The flavor and richness they add is phenomenal. As has been mentioned, don't put the garlic in for 10 minutes, and, if you chop it finely, there's no reason to take it out of the pot. I put the beans in, and toasted them pretty nicely in the oil, before the garlic and the chard, and I've found pre-cooking the chard in water is not necessary. It wilts just as well in the large quantity of olive oil. All in all, one of my favorite winter soups.

We have this almost once a week. I omit the anchovies. To make this easier, just saute garlic and rosemary in oil and then toss in chopped fresh chard with broth. We also love this with kale. Sometimes we add a handful of tiny pasta shells. Ready in 10 minutes. Serve with homemade garlic croutons or crostini.

The soup turned out well, but definitely needed some help. Rather than use garlic broth, I added several cloves of garlic, diced tomatoes, and tomato juice to the base. Also used tortellini for a little extra bulk. I wouldn't skip the anchovy and rosemary - they gave the broth a subtle depth we really enjoyed. I may actually add more next time.

Rating: 2
I used canned mixed beans, added some pancetta, some diced celery and some hot pepper flakes and omitted the anchovy paste and pasta. What I learned was that I really like the taste of swiss chard - I grew it this year for the first time. However, the soup was too salty (probably my fault - canned beans and pancetta) and it just didn't seem to have much taste except for salt and garlic. My boyfriend did not ask for seconds...the ultimate insult to any recipe - so you see I have no choice - I'll try another recipe before using this one again.

this was okay, not terrific in my opinion. I had to double the garlic and load it up with cheese for any yumminess to shine through. I don't think I'd bother making it again. Mollie Katzen's white bean & kale soup is much better.

We love garlic, so I kept it in and used more than called for. Earlier reviewer is right on - 10 minutes is too long to cook garlic, even at a low heat. If it gets too brown it is bitter. First time I have used anchovies in soup and it gives a great depth to the flavor. Next time I will use way less olive oil and add a varity of vegetables and chicken sausage.

Rating: 3
Good tasty soup - nice comfort food. I love garlic so I used more and did NOT take it out after sauting it minced. (One warning about this recipe - I think 10 minutes on medium high heat is too long and will result in burned bitter garlic) I also used anchovy paste instead of the little fishies.

Gosh, this was delicious for something so simple and QUICK. I used a couple of inches of anchovy paste and extra chicken stock. Also used acini di pepe pasta, which is tiny pearl-shaped pasta that is good in soups. The garlic really makes this dish. I'll try the garlic broth next time.

Another wonderful Italian soup without tomatoes. We loved it. Did as previous reviewers suggested and used anchovy paste. Served it with a crusty ciabata from a local Italian bakery, salad and wine.

This was a complicated recipe for a very easy to make and delicious soup...I have a garden full of Swiss Chard, and I used way more than was called for, and I steamed it instead of boiling it.

Like other raters, I used anchovy paste, 2t., and fresh rosemary, and it was the BEST soup I have made for years!! MAKE IT!!!

I love this recipe, easy to prepare. I feel that the instructions for cooking the chard were vague. What does trimmed mean, completely remove the stalks? I was befuddled. Plus, why cook and then chop up? Wouldn't it be easier to chop and throw in the boiling water and blanch, as I did. But truly a keeper recipe. I used orzo and vegetable broth. Next time will make the garlic broth, that sounds wonderful.

This has become our favorite soup. I've made it exactly as the recipe states, and I've also made it by omitting the pasta. Instead, brush slices of a hearty Tuscan bread w/olive oil, broil till lightly browned, then place 1 slice in each bowl. Ladle soup over bread--exquisite!

I made this along with some Irish Soda Bread for our Lenten Friday light supper. The soup was absolutely delicious, and it was so quick and easy that I'd definitely make it again - even on a weeknight. As with one of the other reviewers, I substituted anchovy paste (I find mashing up whole anchovies to be revolting), and I also added a little more pasta than the recipe called for. Next time, I'll increase the anchovy past to 2 tsp. and maybe even a whole Tbl., and I'll increase the pasta even more - to about one cup. I thought the chicken stock was a little overpowering, so I may also try substituting one cup of the broth for a cup of water. Overall, a very flavorful and satisfying dish.

I replaced the anchovie fillets with 1-1/2 tsp anchovie paste, left out the macaroni, kept out the chard until after pureeing have of the soup in the blender.

loved this. I doubled the amount of rosemary and used orzo instead of shell pasta. simmering the soup for about 30 minutes before adding the pasta made for richer broth, smoother flavor, and was a necessary move to soften the initially tinny flavor of the canned beans. I ladled the finished soup over slices of stale sourdough, for a meal that we could not stop raving about.
