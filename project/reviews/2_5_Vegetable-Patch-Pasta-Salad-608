I love this recipe, but I use red bell pepper instead of radish, season with garlic, onion powder, salt and pepper and it's delicious!

How could anybody ask for the "recipe" with a straight face? This is, as a previous poster correctly noted, oil and lemon juice on a few veggies. A bit of balsamic, some "parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme" with avocado, tomato and zucchini and you have - well, a whole other recipe! Indeed, why didn't the geniuses at Epicurious suggest all these additions?

I served this at a luncheon and the ladies loved it and asked for the recipe. I will definitely make it again! It is light and refreshing.

The "recipe" is basically olive oil and lemon dressing that you pour over pasta and veggies. I tried it and found it unbelievably boring. Since the loophole is in the description - that it lends itself to other vegetables, I did the following: I used tomatoes, avocado and zucchini as my veggies and added basil. I also added a splash of balsamic vinegar. So I guess it's a whole other recipe, huh? ;-)

i've made this twice so far, and i will not make it again, at least not the way it is specified here. it's way too bland. it certainly is healthful, but good food requires more than that!
