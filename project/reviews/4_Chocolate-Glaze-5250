I forgot to add: the corn syrup doesn't seem to be necessary. I didn't have any and it wasn't missed.

This recipe works well as a glaze and as a frosting. I thought it was too thin and would never thicken enough to cover a cake -- even when cool, it seemed too thin. I almost gave up. Just as I was about to try an alternative, I noticed that the glaze did look more firm. It was perfect! You can make it thicker or softer by adding more or less cream -- but remember the thicker you make it the harder it will be when fully cool (ie if you want to use it as a frosting between layers, follow the proportions in this recipe; if you want a hard glaze, use a bit less cream).

Who would ever make frosting when THIS is an option? It was simple to make and got RAVE Reviews. Next time will find a better cake to use it on though.
