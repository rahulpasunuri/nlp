I used a roasted which was 6+ lbs so doubled the recipe. Didn't turn out anything special. Meat fell off the bone, but I'd have preferred a regular roast chicken instead.

I made this recipe for my kids and parents (ages 6 to 76) and everybody loved it. I added some sliced onion, fresh broccoli and baby carrots to the bag, and it rounded out the meal. I also used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and shortened the cooking time to 45 minutes. What a easy and healthy dinner!

I used two chicken halves, a prepared Chinese marinade, and a smoker bag that you can find in many supermarkets now next to the briquets. The bag works in the oven and produces delicious smoked flavor without the mess and time of a traditional smoker. Delicious, tender, falling off the bone chicken. I also placed the chicken in the broiler after smoking to get crispy skin. Very easy and tasty.

Easy recipe for a workday dinner but nothing special. Serve with fried rice and sauteed snow peas.

This is a great dish! So easy! My husband really loves it. I once tried it with Pork Tenderloin and it came out just as good. The secret is in the cooking bag...everything turns out juicy.

I substituted duck breast for the chicken. I did one w/the skin and one without. They both turned out the same. I thinly sliced it and served it on a greens/beans salad. It was too much trouble for what I was shooting for.

I have been making this recipe since it first appeared in Bon Apetit. It is one of my husband's favorites and have made it for guest many times. It always gets rave reviews from anyone I have served it to. It's also a quick, easy and tasty entree.

This is wonderful! I have made it several times and my guest have always begged me for the recipe... The only variation I have used which I think makes the dish taste better is to take a whole lemon (stab it several times) and stuff it into the cavity. The lemon bakes all the way through (and with the other favors) its incredible.. The cooking bag also keeps the meat very moist!
