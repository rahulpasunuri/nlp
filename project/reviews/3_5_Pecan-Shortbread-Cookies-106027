First bite I thought hmmm. Next bite was yum! Easy to make, too!

Delicious! I baked them for only 15 minutes and had to use some brown sugar. They disappeared off of the cooling racks.

These cookies are wonderful and not too sweet. Instead of the ground pecans I used 1/2 cup of almond meal (basically ground almonds) from Trader Joe's, and they turned out really nice. I will try them using hazelnut meal next time. Maybe due to the substitution, but I found that I did not have any trouble with the dough. It was a perfect consistency for rolling and cutting. However, as they are very fragile when cooked, they were much easier to remove from the pan when I baked them on parchment paper, otherwise they tended to stick to the pan and several of them broke as I was removing them.

Very delicate and delicious! The prep is super easy in the food processor. I skipped the rolling and cookie cutter - the batter seemed way too soft to try and roll and cut out. i also used coffee ice cream! instead of the whipped cream because i didn't have any and it tastes great! will definitely consider for holiday treats next year.

I have made these several times, generally for a Holiday and they present beautifully and taste amazing for shortbread, I think. The only negative is that the dough is a little difficult to work with, and therefore, more time consuming than some cookie recipes - but worth the oohs and ahhs I receive when they are presented!

Very little flavor. I'll stick to the store bought ones, this one isn't worth the trouble.

These cookies are fantastic, keep the dough well cooled before rollong out, it amkes the much easier to work with. I cut the cookies out like little fingers and dipped the edns in chocolate, Delicious!!

This recipe rocks! Plain shortbread is so boring, so with all the nuts this one was really good. Gave some to friends and now they want the recipe. I substituted sliced almonds for the nuts and it turned out great. Do yourself a favor and try this recipe.

I avoided the sticky dough issue by gently hand-rolling the dough into one inch balls and then generously coating them in a mixture of ground toasted pecans and sugar. I then put them onto an ungreased baking sheet and used a flat-bottomed glass to press them to about a 1/8th inch thickness. This was much neater than rolling out the dough. The receipe also works well with ground hazelnuts or almonds and a pinch of cardamom. Maybe a bit of citrus zest as well.

The taste is good, but my experience with the recipe was not as positive. I heeded another reviewer's suggestion to refrigerate dough before rolling out. Though it was not as sticky, the dough was resisting all of my attempts to work with it! Had to shape with my hands. Cookies broke apart easily and taste deteriorated quickly.

These were okay, maybe I'll add a little cinnamon next time to kick them up a notch.

These cookies are fantastic!! I made them for friends and family and all who tried have asked me to make them again. They are also beautiful and even better fresh out of the oven. I used a 3 inch "fluted" mold for tartlets to cut-out the cookies and baked them on parchment paper. Also preparation and clean-up is easy if you have a food processor and use wax paper to roll out the dough. You have got to try these cookies!

Very delicious cookies! I made them for the holidays and gave them as presents. They got raves. Chilling the dough is a big help. I rolled out the dough between sheets of waxed paper, then put it in the fridge for about 10 mintues. This made cutting the cookies and moving them to the cookie sheet easier. Refrigerate every time you roll out the remaining dough. Also, be careful not to overcook them. Remove cookies before they look done or they will brown too much. Overall an excellent recipe!

The cookies are very tasty. However, this dough gets very soft very fast. I recommend chilling it thoroughly before attempting to roll out the dough.
