My daughter wanted a chocolate/raspberry birthday cake, and this certainly fit the bill. It was very easy to make and tasted wonderful, even without the fresh raspberry garnish. I made it the day before and heated it in a 350-degree oven before serving -- no problem flipping it out of the pan. Leftovers were happily heated up in the microwave.

I was convinced this recipe wouldn't work. Let's be honest it just seems odd, but the cake turned out beautifully. The sponge is one that i use often minus the jam and frosting as its super light and chocolatey. A few tips if its you first time making the cake. Make sure you line your tin well and place the tin on something to catch any juice that comes out.

I made this in 1999 and lost the recipe until I found it today on this website! I loved this recipe. It's easy and absolutely delicious. Make sure you turn it out while still warm or the jam and the chocolate glaze won't release from the pan. I'm so happy I was able to find this again! Thank you Epicurious!!!

Amazing! I actually got it out of my 'go to' cookbook 'The Gourmet Cookbook'. I had been testing chocolate cake recipes for about 18 months and as soon as I bit into this one I knew I had it! This cake batter is now what I use as my chocolate cake!! If you double the cake recipe and choose your own frosting you have a delicious, moist chocolate cake. Most of the time people don't believe there is raspberry in it! My favorite dessert uses this cake batter (doubled), raspberry ganache filling, and chocolate fudge frosting!

I wasn't impressed with the flavor of this cake. At 5000ft, I had to bake it at 375 for about 40 mins, which was fine. When I inverted the cake, a lot of it stuck to the pan despite the well-greased parchment. So the presentation was less than spectacular. I could have overlooked that if it had a rich, deep chocolate flavor, but it was merely bland, tasting mostly like cocoa powder. I won't be making this one again.

I made this recipe for a small birthday party on the basis of it having received such positive reviews. It disappeared from the table. Delicious. I added fresh rasberries for decoration and only used heavy cream (no milk in the apartment.) Truly quick and easy (not just masquerading behind the lingo).

I agree with "katastrophe", this cake is easy and delicious. I followed their direction and cut back on the sugar slightly. Those that had to bake longer need to check their oven temperature.

I've been making this cake for three years. It's easy - I usually make it when guests are coming and I don't have much time to cook. One caveat : as written, it is very, very sweet. I leave out one or the other of the sugars, depending on what I have on hand.

These were delicious, but almost as important, they were incredibly easy! Actually made them in individual ramekins, lightly sprayed with Pam, and had no problem getting them out onto the plate. Using a homemade raspberry jam helped with the flavor, as did a high-quality cocoa powder. I'd recommend undercooking them, rather than overcooking, as they then retain the soft, pudding nature that makes the dessert special. I could also see using other fruits, such as orange with this quick and tasty recipe.

Rating: 4
I made this just as the recipe directs, with the exception of baking it in an 8"x8"x2" silicone pan. I sprayed the pan (and buttered it, too) but am not sure all that was necessary. It came out perfectly and did look very nice, too. I did not have the experience of frosting running down the sides at all. Definitely worth doing again.

Rating: 4
I have to admit it's a REALLY good cake. I would reccomend following it exactly how it is written. It's a shame it does not have the capability to turn out aethetically pleasing but no one cared after they took a bite! I did double the recepie and used a springform pan with liner, worked great. I may try cutting parchment paper on the sides as well as the bottom next time to kind of hold the shape of the cake more firmly.

The baking time is way off. Based on other readers' experience having the edges done before the middle I lowered the temp to 325 and baked it for an hour; it was perfect. A tester will not come out clean. I used a 9-inch springform pan, heavily buttered, and had no problem with sticking. This is a wonderful cake. Not too pretty (fresh raspberries are essential aesthetics-wise). I used a 3.5 oz. bar of Ghirardelli "Twilight Delight" dark chocolate in the icing and Scharffen Berger cocoa in the cake, and a jar of frozen fruit jam from the Northwest that someone had given me. Though it's not seedless, I really recommend it for this purpose (it could be strained, though I didn't bother); it's not cooked, and has a fabulously vivid raspberry taste that really comes through in this recipe. This is a swell dessert, luxurious but easily made. It doesn't need to be served warm, though it's best that way in my opinion; if you made it ahead it can easily be rewarmed.

This cake is easyt and very tasty. I found it needed about 5 more minutes in the oven, and some of the icing had to be spooned as it didn't stay with the cake, but it looked lovely nonetheless.

Great!!! I made it two times. First as the recipes says with raspberrys.And this weekend I tried with orange confiture. and it was simply delicious. The flavour of chocolate mixed with the oranges it´s funny and very very tasty. I didn´t have problems with the unmold.But I did it in a silicone pan,and it was very easy. My friends were very happy with the results and I recommend everybody to try this cake. Yo´ll be surprise. Yummy!!!! .

This was an awesome cake! I made it ahead of time for a dinner, left it in the pan most of the day, and then reheated before serving. While it did not come out immediately, I did not have the problem with sticking that many others have mentioned. I just ran a knife around the edge a few times and it eventually popped out. The flavor of this cake is amazing! I will definitely make this again!

This was phenominal. Served it at a dinner party and love how it came out already frosted. My guests didnt have to wait for the cake to cool and then for me to frost. I did grease the pan a lot per other reader suggestions-I think that really prevented sticking.

My 10 year old nephew and I wanted to bake something fun and impressive to serve to his parents and grandparents. It's very similar to a pudding cake I make where the frosting "magically" happens when you take it out of the oven. This frosting was more like a rich glaze. With the exception of using semi-sweet chips instead of the bittersweet chocolate, this was a really yummy, impressive dessert. And EASY-my 3 year old nephew even helped. Served this warm with some vanilla ice cream and raspberries and listened to the raves of my buddies' first homemade cake. Definite do-over and will experiment with other flavors (orange, strawberry, etc) and types of chocolates.

I made this cake for my daughter's 16th b-day...it was a hit! Only 2 things that I did different were to butter the sides of the pan (after reading all the reviews of the cake sticking), and, I needed to leave it in the oven quite a bit longer than what the recipe called for...after 35 min., I turned the oven up to 375 and left it in for another 20 minutes. The tester did not come out perfectly clean, but the edges were getting a little dark. The end result was an extremely moist and yummy cake - highly recommended and EXTREMELY simple (and, it came out of the pan very easily).

Very good. Serve warm with fresh whipped cream and raspberries! No sticking problems with parchment.

This is the best cake ever and its so easy! Also, very conveniant at party's, you can bake it ahead of time and then pop is in the over to warm it up before serving. Also, I made two kinds for a party, dairy and non-dairy. I replaced the cream with Vita Soy Creamy Original and the butter with Earth Balance and it came out perfect.

This has the potential to be a good dessert, but the baking directions in my experience were completely wrong. After 30 minutes the middle two thirds of the cake was still very jiggly and a tester was NOT coming out clean. I checked it every 5 minutes and ended up baking it 50 minutes before a tester came out clean. Unfortunately, I should not have done this because the cake ended up being overbaked. SO -bake it 35 minutes, but do NOT expect a tester to come out clean. AND - use a springform pan. It happened to be the only 9 inch round I had and it's a good thing because the cake rose way more than 2 inches! Two other tips - cool the frosting down before pouring it into the pan and DO use dutch process cocoa if you have it.

I have made this cake 3 times and it is so delicious and it gets rave reviews, however the first time it came out perfect, beautiful. Served with fresh raspberries and Hagen Daz it is delicious. However, The next 2 times I made this cake I am unable to get this cake out of the pan without having the cake stick and it ruins the presentation which is embarrassing. I don't think I will try again for fear of presentation problems.

I was in a rush, and this seemed like a rather easy cake to make -- and it was! In fact, I was in such a rush that I didn't get a chance to read the other reviews -- so my cake stuck too... But not a problem... I scraped the topping out of the pan and spread it on the cake and topped with fresh raspberries. Couln't tell at all -- the cake presented very well (professionl appearance one might say) and tasted super! Served Double Rainbow vanilla ice cream on the side. Did I mention that this cake tasted wonderful? Might think about using white chocolate or apricot preserves next time, or possibly both... could be interesting. Otherwise wouldn't change a thing (although I may try parchment paper next time).

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday, he's on a low-carb diet most of the time, so when he does eat carbs, he wants to make it worth his while. Well, this cake very much fit that bill. His bachelor-pad kitchen is usually almost impossible to cook in, this one-pan cake was totally easy. It did stick in the pan, though, so I piped whipped cream around the edges and filled the center area with warmed frozen raspberries tossed with liqueur. Worked like a champ. I'd recommend using really high-quality chocolate ingredients, you can taste the chocolate so strongly in the cake that it is not a waste of money to go with the best. Great romantic cake, too.

O.K. all you chocoholics out there - you just have to try this cake. It is one of the most simple and most delicious recipes you will ever make. I made it for Valentine's Day for my husband and it was just out of this world. I served it warm with a little whipped cream and raspberries on the side -oooooohhhh - to die for!! For those who had trouble getting it out of the pan, I covered the bottom of my pan with waxed paper and generously buttered it. With a little twist and a tap, the cake popped right out. Try it - you will NOT be disappointed!!!!

So easy and so good! I did make it ahead and warmed it up while we were eating main course. Turned out perfectly. I used parchment paper so I had no problems with cake sticking. It is very rich. I served it in very small slices with fresh raspberries (which I tossed with a little Grand Marnier, sugar and finely grated orange peel). It was very well received. Will make again and again.

Rating: 4
The cake is surprisingly light, but flavorful, and not too rich at all if sliced thin and served with berries and ice cream. Very easy to make. Baked in the afternoon and brought to a NYE party, but I failed to keep an eye on the hostess who didn't alot a full 15 minutes to warmup, so frosting did not fully liquidy and stuck a bit in pan (I'd used solid shortening *and* parchment, in a belt and suspenders approach), but not a big issue. A wonderful dessert.

I made this to top off a Christmas dinner that began with shrimp cocktail, included melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon... so my guests were already full and happy. But the cake was soon all but gone too(one slice got saved!), everyone raving. I used a non-stick cake pan and was generous with buttering it, so I had NO problems with sticking at all. It did take a bit longer to bake than the appointed time, and the edges got a tiny bit crisp by the time the center was finished, but that's an oven issue, not a recipe issue. The best part of this recipe from my standpoint was its EASE; I have a six month old, so I can't spend all day putting together one course. I made this cake in the early afternoon in under half an hour, and then left it in the pan, gently reheating it toward the end of dinner while the coffee brewed. I was generous with the fresh raspberries on top and also offered Haagen Dazs vanilla ice cream with it. Needless to say, it really tasted like a special day.

I made this ahead of time, took it to a very nice dinner as my contribution. It worked exactly as promised, yummy, light, and chocolatey. I couldn't find bittersweet chocolate, so I used semisweet and that was fine. I served with whip cream and latte ice cream. Everyone loved it. Very special, easy dessert. Great that it can be made night before.

This recipe is so easy to make and it is so gourmet when it is done. I love the rich flavor of the chocolate and raspberries. Every time I make this cake, I am asked for the recipe. I did have a few problems with the cake sticking to the pan, but nothing major and I used the frosting to smooth out the top.

Delicious to eat, easy to make, but a disaster on the plate! Mine stuck to the cake pan. I glued it together using some of the great frosting. Then I sprinkled raspberries everywhere to mask the big chocolate blob. As long as everyone shut their eyes, they were pleasantly rewarded.

Dense, moist and delicious! Followed the recipe faithfully and had no problem getting the cake out of the pan. Could it be because I shake the pan and "swirl" the cake (cake had shrunk a bit after cooling down) before turning the cake onto the plate? I also lightly pat the pan to help the cake come out. My friends and kids love this cake. Not a crumb was left within 24 hours!

I have made this several times and it receives raves each time. It is a bit too chocolaty for my taste, but with enough whipped or ice cream, it is great. I have had a problem the last two times with the cakes falling and being very very dense. No one seems to mind, or even notice, that this has happened..the cake just disappears!Also, the cakes get done at least five min. early, and stick. I will try parchment paper today as I prepare it for a winemaker's dinner we are holding Sat. Being able to make it ahead is a big plus.

This cake is really delicious and perfect to serve for special occasions. It's much easier to make if you refridgerate the frosting in the cake pan before adding the cake batter. While several reviewers mentioned having to exceed the cooking time, my cake was already a bit dry when I took it out five minutes early.

I made this for my birthday for a crowd of chocolate lovers, and we all loved it! It's incredibly rich... don't even try a bite without a glass of milk on hand.

I loved this cake, partly because it was absolutely delicious, moist and chocolately, but also because I found it really easy to prepare. I made it when I was having dinner guests and actually prepared the entire recipe except for baking it a few hours before the guests even arrived. It sat on the counter until dinner was almost finished at which I point I just popped in the oven, easy as can be, and sat back and relaxed til it was done. It turned out perfectly, in my opinion (our guests and my husband loved it too!). Try with good vanilla ice cream--it is divine...

This recipe was okay. The frosting was delicious with just a nice subtle raspberry flavor but the cake just tasted like a bland cocoa concoction.

Have made this recipe 3 times to rave reviews. Plenty of butter on the pan before cooking solves the sticking problem. It's very rich so a little goes a long way and it holds up well as leftovers. I top with frozen raspberries when fresh not available. Definitely a keeper.

I perhaps have a purist sensibility that says that chocolate should be chocolate and raspberry should be raspberry. So this is not by far my favorite chocolate cake (try Elodie's chocolate cake on this site for that). For my taste, it's a mite sweet. It did improve somewhat on the second day, with reheating. And our guests did moan a bit with chocolate cake. Another time I might eliminate the jam from the cake batter.

I liked the idea of baking the icing and cake together, but wasn't all that thrilled with the results. The cake was fine, but the icing tasted harsh, almost as if it had powdered sugar in it, even though it didn't. Perhaps the chocolate I used (Hershey's Special Dark) was to blame. I made the cake on a whim and was nowhere near a store that carried good European chocolate. Otherwise, I followed the suggestion of another cook and used parchment paper, which did a fine job of preventing any sticking problem. I also used a disposable 8" square pan, which also worked well.

I made this the day before I served it. I followed others' advice and used a spring form pan and buttered parchment on the bottom. After 35 minutes the cake was no way nearly done; finally took it out after 50 minutes as I thought the edges were getting too done. (Anyone else have this problem?) Reheated it the next day and it unmolded beautifully, however that was the runniest middle of a cake I've ever seen! Still with the raspberries and birthday candles it made a great (though a little lopsided and maybe even sloppy?) presentation. Served with unsweetened whip cream. Everyone loved it!

This was fabulous. Chocolate and raspberry are a classic combo. It has the advantage of being neither too sweet nor too rich to end a "company" (hearty) dinner. Everyone raved and my "taste arbiter" even asked for the recipe - a first! To my surprise I had no problem getting the cake out of the pan - used lots of butter, waxed paper and a cake pan with a removable bottom (maybe that's the trick). Or maybe it was just beginners luck.

This is one of the uglist cake I've ever made, and it is also the yummiest! Part of my frosting did stick to the bottom, but most came out as a gooy mess. The cake itself is so moist and chocolaty.

This cake was so easy but impressed everyone as difficult and I did not tell them the truth. I will make this cake again for sure.

This cake was FABULOUS! It was our dessert for a very special New Year's Eve dinner (lobster, champagne, the works...), and everyone loved it. It was very easy to make, and we made it a day ahead and reheated it -- it was delicious!

Outstanding, and highly recommended!

I made this recipe twice. The first time, exactly according to the directions; the second time, by substituting blackberry preserves for raspberry. Loved it with the raspberry (asinstructed in the recipe). Very moist, very chocolatey and with just the right amount of raspberry (you can really taste the raspberry flavor). The blackberry didn't work as well, even with the addition of a couple teaspoons of Chambord (blackberry liquer). A great feature of this recipe is that it does not need to be made in advance; but it can also be made in advance.

The best thing about this cake...that you can make it ahead, reheat it, and still have it look and taste like you just took it out of the oven. We had to let ours sit a day and it was still lovely when reheated and served (the top was still gushy, like I had hoped). Served it with some warmed raspberry preserves drizzled over the top of each slice for a nice presentation.

Chocolate and raspberry are an unbeatable combination and this cake is the best I've tasted. I like whipped cream with this cake but the warmth melted the cream too quickly; a small scoop of vanilla ice cream is delicious!

I have made this cake 4 times for my family and for company. So quick and easy. My 8 year old son, who only eats desserts with chocolate requested it for his birthday after spying it in the magazine. Fabulous and so impressive looking (if you can get it out of the pan -- practice makes perfect).

WONDERFUL, however I have trouble getting the center of the top to come out nicely. I usually need to smooth the frosting around. Taste is fabulous!

I made this cake for company and we all agreed it was delicious. The texture and flavors were amazing. It was also quite easy to make. I will definitely use this recipe again.

This was very moist and a hit but a little difficult to get out of the pan.

This was a simple and delicious cake to make. Be sure not to let the cake cool in the pan, or it is tough to get out!! I made it for my husband's birthday, and it was gone in one night!!
