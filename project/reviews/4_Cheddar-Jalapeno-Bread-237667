What a great and interesting bread! Definitely different type of dough than I'm used to. Mine was so loose that when I turned it out on the counter, it started to flow like lava. I quickly scooped it into the pan, skipping the folding it like a letter step, and it was still great. My loaf turned out so pretty that I took a photo of it and sent it to a friend who loves to bake bread. She said it looked like something from a cookbook shoot. My husband LOVED it and even enjoyed the leftovers the next morning toasted with butter. He was in heaven. I'll be making this one again.

Absolutely divine. One of the best bread recipes I've ever made. Needs no amendments. Will definitely make this often!

Made exact except I added 1T wheat gluten per cup of flour and it turned out exceptional. I always add wheat gluten to bread to improve texture and it's amazing how good it is. (PS: You don't need bread machine flour if you add wheat gluten!) This recipe made a beautiful loaf of bread (mine was MUCH nicer and taller than the picture) and it tasted better than any bakery.

I LOVE this bread. I made it for a dinner party at my house and had to fend my husband off it all day. When we finally cut into the bread, it was a smash hit and I'm always being asked to make it. The dough is a lot stickier than I'm used to, so I do end up adding in about a 1/4 cup more flour when I'm kneading it before putting it in the loaf pan, but otherwise, it's easy to make and incredibly delicious.

Delicious! I made a loaf for a dinner party and had a really hard time keeping my husband out of it until that night (almost had to wield the bread knife!). Well, when we finally cut in to the bread, it was an instant hit. The cheese on top made a perfect crust for the semi-moist interior. The cheese baked in quite nicely without making the bread seem oily or greasy. I added a few more jalapenos to the top for a little added punch (under the cheese so they wouldn't burn) and that made a nice touch. It also makes a great breakfast bread the next day as a substitute to tortillas for huevos rancheros (if you can save any!). Overall, I'm going to have to make this a staple in my kitchen.

Great bread! I used 4c whole wheat pastry flour (we eat all whole grain), which worked great without any other adjustments. Didn't have fresh jalapenos so I used pickled slices, dried on paper towels and minced. The bread is outstanding and I love the crust-crisping trick!

Awesome! Beautiful and crusty with loads of flavor! I made it twice in two days because we liked it so well and I have a huge crop of jalapenos this year that I need to use. The 2nd time, I only had 1 cup of cheddar left, so I actually cubed up some Velveeta cheese and added that. My boys told me they liked the 2nd loaf even better because of the extra cheese spots. This is a new family favorite--Thanks!

This is an amazing go-to bread recipe! It is extremely easy to make and comes out perfectly every time. I never bake it the full 50 min to an hour. I take it out usually around 40 to 45 minutes and it's still crunchy on the outside and a little more doughy on the inside which is perfect!

Absolutely wonderful! This was the very first time that I have ever made homemade bread and it turned out beautiful and delicious! I will definitely be making this again.

Fantastic bread--light, soft crumb with a smooth texture. The cheese really melds with the flour, so you get a rich flavor that doesn't come across as strongly chees-y. I've made this a few times and always just dice three full jalapenos and throw them in. I think the baking mellows them a little, so you're left with jalapeno flavor and a little bit of spice. I'm also a big fan of baking breads using an instant-read thermometer. With this one I've found that it turns out really well if I take it out of the pan at 190 degrees and then crisp the outer crust according to the directions for another 10 minutes.

I don't understand this recipe. By bread was not wet as stated in the description, But I followed the recipe and baked it on a stone ( because i just couldn't fit all the dough into my loaf pan). The result was a flavorful and aromatic beautifully risen loaf that would look at home in any professional bakery. Dont let this sad picture fool you, that bread must be from a completely different recipe!

Amazingly good bread that actually goes with almost any main course - Especially if there is a sauce involved so you can soak up every bit with the bread! Soups, stews, chili, pasta, you name it! We've even cut it into slices to make sandwiches, which is not the healthiest thing, but definitely a treat! I buy the finest (sharpest) cheddar cheese & grate it at home - really makes a difference. We don't alter the recipe a bit & have made several loaves every month to eat & also give as gifts.

This bread is wonderful. I used three jaapenos, but no seeds or ribs, and the heat is perfect. I used the called-for cheddar, but also cubed some additional really good quality cheddar to ensure a few gooey bites. I do think the 400 degree oven is too hot for a 50-minute/ hour time period. Like many other reviewers, I thankfully paid attention to my nose and grabbed my bread after about 40 minutes. It rose nicely, and is brown and crusty on top. Any additional time and it would have been a mess.

Made a lovely, though very large loaf, of cheesy/jalapeno goodness. Next time I would definately divide the dough into two smaller loaves.

Very good. Mine ended up being done after baking for only 40 minutes and I didn't even have to put it back in to crisp the crust. It was plenty crisp when I took it out the first time. It is a little heavy but tastes great!

Excellent bread. I didn't have any jalapeno peppers on hand, so I used a milder one. It still had a great flavor. I can't wait to make it again with jalapeno. Also used bread flour, it looks just like an artisian loaf you might buy at a bakery. Made it last night for my hubbie, but have polished off half of it since he went to work this morning!

Very easy. Last time I made it I used one habanero and two jalapenos (always wear gloves!!) with no seeds no ribs. I was concerned it would be too hot but it was just perfect! Use a good, heavy loaf pan - and I pulled mine much earlier than the recipe stated and didn't need the extra browning step of putting it back in the oven. It's fantastic with chili, and even better as garlic toast. I'm a novice baker - so you know it's pretty easy :)

Another Loaf later... On my first try with this recipe (with excellent results) U used storebought pre-shredded cheddar. It is drier than fresh grated cheese. On my second try, I gratde my own, and I noticed that the dough seemed a little slack, as if it could have benefitted from a bit more flour. But, I resisted adding any. My loaf was dimpled in the middle. Lesson Learned: Once you're familiar with a dough recipe, and you know what the consistency of the dough is supposed to be, add more flour, moisture, whatever - but achieve the consistency with which you're familiar.

I found the jalapeno "heat level" to be fairly mild. Bread had excellent taste and texture - demostrated excellent 'oven spring'. I made it once about two weeks ago, and plan on making it for this upcoming weekend for guests.

Delicious bread, very easy to make and tasty. The finished product was much more attractive than the picture on the website.

Cheated, used a breadmaker, no regrets, ugly, but not as ugly as the picture. Eat it with your eyes closed and you're in heaven!

This recipe takes awhile (as all home made breads do), but it's worth it! It's a fantastic accompaniment to so many dishes...highly recommended!

Fantastic - make sure you put it in deep breadpan

I used bread flour instead of all-purpose flour and a serrano chile because my store had no jalapenos for some reason. My bread also rose beautifully. Much better than the sad one pictured. I can't stop nibbling at this bread. I made a batch of chili to accompany it. I thought it was great!

I give this 3 stars although my boyfriend would give it zero. I thought it was beautiful - it rose much more than the picture and had a beatiful crust. My boyfriend found the crust greasy though which was due to the sprinkling of parmesan on top. He also found the jalepeno to be overwhelming. However, it's exactly what I thought it would be - a little kick from the pepper and very hearty. I'll definitely make it again. Also, ours took less time to bake up than the recipe called for.

The dough was a pleasure to work with, and the bread was delicious. My loaf was done after 40 minutes, and it looked better than the brick-like loaf pictured. It rose handsomely. Used water instead of the eggwash (due to allergy). Fairly simple to make. Can't wait to make it again.
