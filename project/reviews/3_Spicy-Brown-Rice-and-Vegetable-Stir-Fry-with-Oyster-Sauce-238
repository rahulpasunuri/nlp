I gave this 4 stars because I've made it twice and will make it again. The first time I stir fried chicken and then did the recipe as directed adding a bag of bean sprouts. I did add a little soy sauce based on other reviews. It was the first time that i ever made a stir fry that my veggies came out perfect because I did exactly what the recipe said. Tonight I made it with tofu and added extra veggies. The first time I used jarred ginger and this time I used fresh ginger which was quite frankly a little over powering even though fresh is superior. I will make this again using it as a core recipe for variations.

For the record, oyster sauce means this isn't vegetarian (it pops up as an option when searching with the dietary restriction vegetarian). Please fix this. Thanks.

Disappointing. Bland taste, no depth. I added extra spices and still nothing. Not recommended. Blah!

My family really liked this recipe. I did alter...couldn't find oyster sauce so i used a low sodium Chinese Stir Fry sauce. The chili sauce added a nice kick to the veges!

As I did, I recommend that you increased the sauce by half and add a few dashes of soy sauce at the end of cooking. With these alterations, I found this to be a delicious, healthy and easy meal.

I added some chicken breast with this, and it made it quite a substantial and healthy weekday meal. However, I feel that it did need some more spices and flavourings beyond the oyster sauce -- perhaps some soy sauce, extra garlic, and chopped cilantro would have improved it.

I like spicy food and thought this recipie had promise, but in the future I'll stick to regular fried rice, made with either white or brown rice. I like oyster sauce but not in this particular sauce (maybe it needed a touch of sugar), and I would use a difference mix of veggies.

I made a few substitutions in the veggies but the sauce came out great with a little extra chili paste and I really like the brown rice. I'd definitely use this as the basis of a quick stir-fry again.

The oyster sauce and chili paste produced a good sauce, but the quantities given were not enough for the amount of rice and vegetables. I probably doubled the amount of oyster sauce. Additionally, it doesn't have quite enough zing for my spicy taste, so I piled on the chili paste - maybe I need to find a hotter brand. However, the combination of the sauce, brown rice, and vegetables was great!

This is very tasty and a great way to use leftover rice, not to mention the huge jar of Korean hot chili paste somebody bought last year. I happen to have a leek languishing in the fridge and maybe tonight I'll make it again.

It's good, a healthy weekday dish that's easy to prepare. The brown rice works very well--don't substitute white rice!

This stir-fry was quick and easy to prepare. The oyster sauce was a nice change from soy.
