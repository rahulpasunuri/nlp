This is my go-to lamb recipe if we're having a dinner party. It's easy to prepare the night before, and then put it on the BBQ. The recipe as posted originally on epicurious called for "olive oil paste". You will see references to that in early reviews. It was a misprint, apparently, but I have to say having made it both ways (with olive paste--like a black olive tapenade) and with just olive oil--it's better with the crushed black olives mixed into the herb mixture. Read the earlier reviews and you'll see what I mean. It's a really good, very easy recipe.

Fabulous. I should have grilled some of the lamb a little longer but just great

Very very good. The weather turned today so instead of grilling it, we roasted it (10 extra minutes because we like our lamb medium). Turned out excellent. Flavorful and juicy and tender

This recipe is ok for people who are new to lamb, or who don't like gamey meats. While the meat came out perfectly cooked, the addition of the lemon during the resting phase made the lamb taste less lamby (closer to beef or veal). I might try this again (but probably won't), minus the lemon.

Wow! This was fantastic. And even better cold the next day! Will make again and again and again.

Made with Costco's Boneless Leg (NZ). BBQ'd flat in a rotisserie basket to 130F, removed and let it rest 10 min. Achieved 135+ final temp. It was delicious with both/either mint jelly, and mint jelly cut with white balsamic vinegar. It was also excellent as left overs, with brown jasmine rice cooked in beef stock.

This is the best recipe for lamb I have ever tried. I do serve it regularly at dinner parties and have adapted it for other cuts of lamb. The fresh herb rub is great on rack of lamb, served with a wild mushroom risotto and steamed green beans then drizzle with the lemon flavored jus.

I have made this 6 times in the past 2 months, each time for different guests and this recipe gets amazing reviews (and several people who usually dislike lamb have tried and enjoyed this dish). I have only used Trader Joe's boneless leg of lamb (which I find to be non-gamy), so perhaps the results would not be as universally pleasing were one to use a gamier cut. I added fresh greek oregano into the herb mixture, and used olive oil to make a paste, per other users' recommendations.

Wow. This is as delicious as the reviews say. My guests all had multiple helpings. We couldn't fit all 4.5 pounds on the grill, so we did one piece in the oven. Both methods worked great.

Fabulous recipe. This has become an Easter tradition, usually served with scalloped potatoes with gruyere and leeks, asparagus and greek salad. I too will chill the olive oil in the freezer to create the paste and skewers are a must.

Scrumptious! I didn't have olive paste, so I just added enough olive oil to the rest of the ingredients until I could make a paste with it. I usually put all the ingredients in a freezer bag, throw the lamb in and squish the paste around it and then leave it in the fridge overnight. I also bring it to room temp before grilling!

Rating: 3
This was great. Like many other reviewers, I prepared it the day before and left it in the fridge, then pulled it out an hour or so before roasting it in the oven (convection for about 30 min). I think they meant "Olive Paste" so I added a handful of Kalamata olives to the mini-Cuisinart and maybe 2-3 Tbs. of olive oil. I got the meat at Costco; it was only $20 and already boned & butterflied!

Rating: 4
I have made this several times and get nothing but compliments. I take half of the garlic and herb combo and put it in a food processor with the olive oil to make a "paste" and then add the rest and rub it on. If you have leftovers, they are great in a pita with yogurt sauce.

I served it for Easter dinner and it was excellent!! I convection roasted it @425 to 155 degrees. It took about 20-25 min. The thin parts were well done but the thicker parts were a perfect medium. Very flavorful. The thyme was a pain to prepare but it was worth it.

By far the best lamb dish I've ever tasted - even though I totally forgot the lemon at the end! We made this recipe using lamb chops. It was so delicious that husband and I were forced to flip a coin to determine which one of us got to take the remaining chop for lunch the next day. Thanks to other reviewers for clarifying the "olive oil paste" thing.

I was looking for a roast leg of lamb I could do on the rotisserie, and this was the closest I could find. I "read into" the ingrediants and took "olive oil paste" as a paste of the garlic and herbs...and it took reading an awful lot of comments to find out I was right...Anyway, I roasted the whole leg of lamb on the gas grill rotisserie, and I must say this lamb was "to die for". This actually is similar to recipes you find all over for lamb...very typical to use the spices and olive oil and garlic rub...anyway, it made me sorry I had only planned to make pitas out of this lamb, it was far too good for that...luckily I have lots leftover to freeze. This is a great recipe for lamb, old standby that it is. Try it on the rotisserie, with a bonelss leg of lamb, tied, and you won't be disappointed.

Rating: 4
This lamb was unbelievable! I made it for a dinner party of 10 people following the recipe and everyone raved about it...."best lamb I've ever eaten!". I used a mini food processor to make the marinade which made preparation a cinch. Got it ready early in the day and let it marinate in the refrigerator, then brought it to room temp before grilling. The aroma of the lamb cooking on the grill was to die for! This is definitely a winner.

Rating: 4
Excellent! I wanted to do something special for my in-laws who bought us our new grill, and this was it! Everyone loved it. I made the marinade rub in the food processor, which I think saved time and made a nice paste. You could bottle the stuff and sell it! Perfecto!

I made this for a crowd & everybody raved! It was the best lamb I have ever had! I served it with an orzo, feta & tomato salad, a greek salad, grilled artichokes, hummus, tzatziki, and pita. It cooked in about 25 minutes on my weber. Do try this recipe- you'll love it!

Rating: 4
A butterflied leg cooks infinitely more quickly, and when you marinate it, you'll find it's more tender than a bone-in lamb. This has become my favorite recipe for lamb. I made two legs of lamb for an Easter open house and everyone said it was the best they'd ever had. I served it with vinegarette marinated asparagus, green salad, roasted vegetables and olive oili mashed potatoes. Excellent. Keep the bone and use it to make a stock; you can reduce it with chicken or beef stock with some red wine to make an excellent sauce.

It's always nice to get another lamb recipe since it can adapt to so many different 'cultures' from french to mid-eastern, and so can fit into theme dinners quite nicely. This was great - made it with a pilaf and green beans. P.S. for the Calgary cook who just doesn't like lamb, please don't rate recipes when you don't like the main ingredient. Many of us like to look at ratings and not have to read the reviews to find that the rating was lower because of one person who wouldn't have liked the lamb dish no matter how magical it was.

I am making this for the 3rd time monday for Labor Day, also made for 4th of July. Fabulous! Used olive oil, fresh rosemary, thyme, parsley from garden, marinated about 24-36 hours in ziploc bag. Cut lamb into two pieces for easier grilling. This is major family favorite. My 12 year old son considers this his new favorite food. Grilled potatoes on the side, and fresh tomato/mozzarella salad w/olive oil, basil and balsamic vinegar. Wow!

Please take my review with a grain of salt...I think I just have to finally admit that I like lamb but I will never love it. But it looked really great on the grill and smelled good too. I know some of my guests really enjoyed it. And I would probably recommend it to lamb-lovers - but I think tiny little lamb chops will be about as far as I can go in the future...

This is the best lamb recipe I've ever made. To cook it, though I followed advice of Cook's Illustrated. I didn't skewer the meat as noted above, but created a quite hot fire on one side of the grill and left the other cooler. Then I seared the fat side for a few minutes, then turned over to sear the other side. I then moved over to the 'cold' side of the grill, instead of leaving over fire and closed the lid. Cooked for 10 minutes per pound on each side. Came out perfect! I served with lemony-argula and mashed potatoes, and made a reduction sauce with beef stock and the lamb bone. Like others, I pureed Olives with some olive oil to make the paste. (The olives and coarse salt are key to this recipe, as is rubbing the lamb with the lemon.) Great! Will definitely make again.

Rating: 3
The lamb was delicious, but I made a few modifications. I used 6 T olive oil, all dried herbs, and added rosemary and 2 T. balsamic vinegar and made a paste in the mini cuisinart and marinated overnight. The lamb took a long time to cook, but was delicious in the end. A terrific recipe for guests who like lamb.

Absolutely delicious! I made my own olive paste by blending a handful of pitted greek olives with a couple of tablespoons of olive oil and one clove of garlic. I also tried roasting the lamb first for 15 minutes at 425, then put it under the broiler on each side for about 5 minutes each side, which made the meat really tender. Our guests loved this dish.

The real beauty of this recipe is the cooking instructions. I combined all of the ingredients with a cup of olive oil and marinated the lamb overnight in the fridge. Brought it back to room temp before putting it on the grill. This was a very large butterfly (7 lbs.) so I cut it in half at the seam. One slab was thicker than the other. I put them both on at the same time and cooked for exactly the amount of time specified in the recipe. After letting it sit for 15 minutes, I sliced the thicker side (about 3inches ) for perfectly done med. rare meat and sliced the thinner side (about an inch and a half) for medium slices. So, everyone got to have their lamb to their desired doneness. This was the easiest Easter dinner I've prepared in years. And delicious too!

I boned and butterflied a 4 1/2 pound leg of lamb, but used the same amount of marinade recommended above. I also used olive oil and not olive paste. I roasted in oven for about 20 minutes. The results were awesome. Served with a Village Salad and some pita bread.

I have been cooking lamb for 35 years and this is one of the finest staight forward delicious lamb recipes that I have ever had. I didn't have olive paste so I just used 6 black olives and a little olive oil combined with the other herbs in the food processor. keep this recipe on hand!!

Made this for our gourmet club with a Mediterranean theme; everyone thoroughly enjoyed it. Very easy to make and great for entertaining especially if you roast rather than grill.

We loved the grilled lamb created with this recipe. I made it tonight for my family to rave reviews. Even my three year old kept coming back for more.

I have very limited -- and unsuccessful -- experience cooking lamb, but the positive reviews here gave me confidence to try this one. It was delicious, and I was very pleased with the results the first night. It took longer than 10 minutes on each side to achieve 125° internally on my gas grill, but the aroma coming from the grill was heavenly. I served the lamb with creamy polenta (also from this site). My dinner guests raved about the lamb (and the polenta), but the whole leg was way more than enough for six people. Leftovers left a lot to be desired, since re-heating the lamb caused it to cook further, and the result was disappointingly greasy and heavy, especially considering that the leftovers represented half of the $35 leg. I'll definitely make the recipe again, but it will have to be for a larger crowd, so there'll be no leftovers.

Rating: 4
This recipe is great. I followed the recipe verbatim, except I added 2 tablespoons of fresh marjoram to the herbs and used a whole head of garlic. I let it marinate at room temperature for about 2 hours before grilling on a gas grill. About 5 pounds of meat fed 7 people, no leftovers! The lemon, herbs, and slight char are the perfect mix of flavors with lamb.

I was given a boneless leg of lamb and was told to "do something with it" last year for a picnic. I rarely ever eat lamb to begin with and had never cooked it before then. I prepared the rub and let it marinate for probably 4 hours before grilling over medium-low heat. Well, it was a big hit and I am glad to have found the recipe again, as it was the top requested "dish" for this year's picnic. Thank you.

We love lamb and I am always looking for different recipes for the barbecue. I admit that I didn't quite follow the recipe exactly, but it gave me a guide line on how to "wing" it with great results.

The lamb was delicious! However, I cooked the lamb to a temperature of 140 and not 125 as the recipe called for.

I will definitely make this again.

I absolutely love this dish and so does everyone that I cook it for. I always grill mine in the oven, about 20 mins on each side. Never before have I enjoyed my own food so much.

This is wonderful lamb, and I didn't even follow the recipe exactly. I laid lots of the fresh herbs under and over the lamb and weighted it down for several hours at room temperature. To the olive oil garlic paste I added dried Greek oregano (as suggested in Barba Yianni's Grilled Lamb - recipe on this site). The instructions for the using the metal skewers to hold the meat together is very important. One hour for marination, as called for, is not enough, no matter how you marinate the meat or what ingredients you use.

Did this for a dinner party--it was absolutely marvelous... the long skewers to hold it together on the grill are real important--we used 6. the other thing is that, because the meat is not uniformly thick, you need a good meat thermometer.

Wonderful!

Great recipe. I let the lamb marinate overnight, and I'd recommend doing that. Salt and pepper well just before grilling. If you take the meat right from the fridge, you can grill it longer, getting a nice char on the outside, without overcooking the inside. Also agree with previous reviewer that you may want to divide the meat along one or two of its natural seams to make handling easier. Perfect main course in summer or winter.

I've made lamb in a similar fashion to this in the past -- this is a great recipe. Try serving it with a dip consisting of 1 jar of mild pepper rings, 1 chopped onion, 2 slightly crushed cloves of garlic, juice of one lemon, salt, pepper and enough salad oil or olive oil (I use a combination of the two) to cover. Store in the refrigerator for a few hours and then remove approx. an hour before you serve the lamb, to get it to room temp. Remove the pieces of crushed garlic before serving.

I made this leg of lamb recipe for our "Gourmet Dining Group" in our neighborhood for our Greek night. I had never made leg of lamb before and was nervous to try it. It was wonderful! I substituted fresh basil for the parsley because my husband doesn't like parsley and it was great. I roasted mine in the oven because my grill wasn't working and it took about 45 minutes to roast, not 25 minutes. By the way, it's not olive oil paste, it's just olive oil. The word "paste" belongs on the next line.

Great. Made this on a visit last week to good friends S.& B. in Baltimore. This is so easy and bullet-proof that even though we had to substitute dried herbs for fresh and store-bought chopped garlic for fresh, it was STILL outstanding.

Don't use "olive oil Paste" - you are supposed to make a paste out of the herb rub ingredients and olive oil. Enjoy!!!

To the cook from Fairbanks: To make olive paste puree olives. I am trying this recipe today. As an update I did make a lamb roast using the herbs, galic and lemon and olive oil not a paste. Since it was a BIG roast I cooked it at 300 for 5 hours. My family and guests went wild with delight and couln't stop raving about it. To the cook from LA, I think the olive paste would give it a different taste but I would like to try it.

This is pretty much to the tee the same lamb recipe I've been making for many years given down by a friend.

One lemon squeezed over top...and marinate overnight...450 degrees for 15 mins then reduce. Add white wine to bottom of pan 1/2 way through cooking time. delicious.,

I'm also wondering what olive *oil* paste is. I used olive oil and it worked fine, but if it really is pureed olives, that would change this dish enormously. In any case, I made this for Easter and everyone loved it. I put a small handful of wet mesquite on the grill and that added a nice smoky flavor. I totally forgot to squeeze the lemon over it, however, and I'm sorry about that. I'll bet it would have been nice. Served it with mashed potatoes and leeks with thyme, and vichy carrots, both from this site. Everything was delish!

I am dying to try this, but don't know what "olive oil paste" is, know it isn't available here, and wonder how one can make it. Any help out there?

This was one of the best lamb dishes I have had. Everyone was licking their fingers!! It was one of the easiest too. Even the leftovers are tasty.

This is the best lamb recipe I have ever used. each time I have served guest this dish I have received rave reviews, some from friends that do not care for lamb. It is also very easy to prepare and serve.

An excellent marinade good for all sorts of meats. Make sure not to overcook the meat! We've really enjoyed adding thinly sliced leftovers to spinach salads.

This is becoming my favorite grilled meal . . . reminiscent of the best open air restaurants in Greece. Outstanding if done over real wood coals, and stunning the day after on sandwiches. Guests rave over the flavor, and folks who thought they didn't like lamb become disciples. You gotta try it! Serve with pasta/eggplant and sauteed spinach.

This was the main event for our Christmas dinner. My two little boys agreed that we should not wait for another holiday to make this again. I added fresh basil into the marinade and it worked with everything else perfectly. I grilled it and loved the taste. I don't know if I would roast it next time.

i LOVED this recipe in every way! i bought a boned leg of lamb and cut off a chunk of it to try out this recipe on the grill. i cut the ingredients in half and followed the rest of the instructions. if you "think" you like lamb, try this one out--you will love it too!

This dish is so easy! We marinated pieces of lamb to make kebabs instead of entire leg - YUM! Lemon with foil is the trick, used olive oil instead of paste. We used 1/2 of the salt - still great.

This recipe was so easy. Marinate the meat before you go to work, so all you have to do is cook when you get home. I offered it to my sister-in-law(who doesn't like leg of lamb) and she loved it. My 6 year old daughters loved it for dinner, as did my husband.

Great dish. Simple prep work only took a few minutes. The herb rub smelled fabulous. Didn't use 'paste', used olive oil. Lemon juice over lamb in foil is a neat trick.

This was a real find! Ridiculously easy to make. The skewer technique was a revelation. It worked perfectly. I made the accompanying sauce and it added to the tastes but the lamb was great alone.

This is a winner. I marinated it overnight. I also think the key to leg of lamb on the grill is carving it correctly, against the grain and thin. sort of like a flank steak. It was a real hit!
