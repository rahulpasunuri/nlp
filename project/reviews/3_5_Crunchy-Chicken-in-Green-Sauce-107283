This is not a fancy meal but it's a great weeknight meal. Great! And so easy. I use a jar of Trader Joe's Salsa Verde (can I say that?) and I put a few slices of avocado on top. It's wonderful. I make it all the time.

Actually pretty easy. Plenty of dipping and enough coating. For sauce used 22 oz green salsa. Rice with 1 large onion, ½ large red pepper, 2 carrots chopped in food processor. I see now it was supposed to be another side, but I fried it and mixed it in the rice. Maybe should add cilantro to the rice to make it Mexican.

It is hard to imagine that anyone could give this recipe anything but the highest rating. The hardest part is gathering the ingredients. I made this for the family and then for company and it was a huge hit each time. I think it's important to use a non-stick skillet so that the coating is crunchy and intact. I used a half avocado (sliced) on each serving and put a dollop of sour cream and one of tomato salsa (from a jar, processed with a handful of cilantro) on the plate. People love it!

This is a great recipe that my whole family loves. It is really quick and easy but I think it is important to have all the right ingredients to make it truly great. I'll definitely keep this in rotation.

Since I only had two chicken breasts I cut the recipe in half, and substituted cayenne pepper for the chili pepper, but I forgot to cut the cayenne- oops!!!! Wow was this dish hot. My husband refused to touch it, but I must say I saved it and the next day I put it in a corn tortilla with cheese, lettuce, and avacados and it was wonderful. I would make this again and next time pay attention. :)

I don't often keep buttermilk in the house, but had some to use up and found this recipe when I did a search. Boy, am I glad that I did! Was also able to use up some Trader Joe's Salsa Verde that my husband had found to be too bland for dipping chips. In this dish the salsa was a nice contrast to the spicy chicken. I didn't have cilantro or avocado... probably would have been nice, but not a must have. Definitely don't use anything but ancho chile pepper... it needs the smokey heat.

Great for quick busy weeknight dinner! Also works with bone-in chicken thighs, which my husband loves, just roast the thighs after the cornmeal coating has browned at 350 until done. If I have time, I also try to marinate the chicken in the buttermilk before coating, helps keep it juicy. Used a habanero chili powder mixture which added a great punch! The green salsa is a must, Herdez brand can be found in some grocery stores here.

Sorry to spoil the good reviews but I did not like this recipe at all. Maybe because I don't eat a lot of fried chicken - but I didn't think it was anything special. Yuck!

Excellent! A nice spicy, salty treat.

Definitely a three-and-a-half forker for both depth of flavor and simplicity to prepare. As others have said, it's perfect for a mid-week meal and would be just as good topped with plain green or red salsa. We sprinkled a little cayenne in the cornmeal mix to kick it up a notch and added a touch of cream to the sauce for added texture - doesn't need it though. Will put this in the rotation.

This was so easy and very, very good! I served it, as suggested, with a saute of carrots and sweet peppers, and I made a simple spanish rice with lots of tomatoes. I added a little more chicken broth than was noted (I used a large saute pan), and the sauce was absolutely delicious! Great weekday meal.

A 3+ recipe. Great weeknight meal, especially with flattened breasts from Sam's Club. I added chipotle chiles to the sauce and used Durango Diner Green Chile sauce -- great flavor.

My homemade salsa verde was wimpy and my elderly chili powder lacked moxiw, but this turned out well anyway. Leftovers were superb on a sandwich with nothing more than mayonnaise and iceberg lettuce.

This chicken was WONDERFUL. I made it exactly by the recipe, but can see that it's definitely one that can be experimented with. I served this with the spicy bell pepper salad from this site. They were a wonderful combo. When I do the combo again, I'll use cumin seed instead of caraway seed in the pepper dish. I think that would blend more nicely with the chicken. Wonderful and easy dish.

Definitely easy, and everyone seemed to like it. My 10 year old says the coating is "yummy", but my husband wanted it spicier (not me!) I put the avocado on top of a spinach and nopalitos salad, instead of on the chicken, and dressed it with the warm salsa mixture. Served with rice.

We loved this dish. The chicken came out crispy and tasted wonderful. I used half chipotle chili powder and half regular and it gave it a nice smokey flavor. I didn't have buttermilk so I used 1% regular milk and it worked out fine. I served it with the oven cooked rice from this site and it was a perfect pair.

I liked this recipe a lot and thought it would also be great on plain fish like Mahi-Mahi! I might try it with that next.

This was really, really, good. I didn't have any green salsa, so I used what I had...purchased Chi Chi's salsa. My husband loved it too.

This chicken has a great crust. You could probably just top it w/ warmed salsa, in a pinch.

Good and Fast

This recipe was delicious! However, I decided to make it at the last minute and had to use a few different ingredients. I ran out of chili powder, so I added a little cayenne too; used a jar of Ortega medium salsa; add 4 T. of cream as another cook suggested; doubled the amount of broth because I had more than a cup of salsa; didn't use any cilantro. The chicken was great - it was what made the recipe. It was really crispy and tasty. The sauce was really hot, so we had sour cream on top to cool it off some.

Excellent recipe. Virtually fool proof. I mixed the salsa, broth and cilantro before adding to the skillet and the sauce still reduced perfectly. I served this for a Mexican dinner party for four and was still able to enjoy the time with my guests because the preparation was so quick and easy. This is a keeper for nights when you're in a rush.

I really liked this very tasty and easy-to-make meal. Just added an herb salad with cilantro caesar dressing and toasted pepitas to round out the dinner.

This will definately warm you up on a cold winter day! We could only find "HOT" green salsa. Made a very spicy dish. Well worth making. Nice and crispy without deep frying!
