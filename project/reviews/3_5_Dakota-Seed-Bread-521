I feel dumb asking this, but ... the wild rice is cooked, correct?

Hubby loved this one. First time around, I felt it was overly heavy and yeasty but put that down to not kneading long enough. About to try for the second time and will report on results with additional kneading time.

It seems this recipe requires a lot of dry milk powder. I want to make sure the amount before making it. Please confirm!

This bread is an absolute winner!! I get rave reviews every time I make it. It tastes better and better with time. Excellent with soup. perfect recipe that you can follow to the letter. I put in pumkin seeds rather than sunflower - a nice substitute.

Just made this bread and it is the best....even BETTER than the bread mentioned by Shauna. I made it just as the recipe reads, will try without the oil next time.

This bread is good, but not near as tasty as the Multi Grain Bread with Flax, Sesame and Poppy Seeds on this same website.

A very substantial and satisfying bread. For vegetarians, an excellent source of protein: all one needs to put between slices for a sandwich are some greens of choice ! I make this in a Kitchen-Aid mixer, and have found that when the bread just begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl, it's best to stop and let the dough rest for about 15-20 minutes. When I begin kneading it, the dough firms up quite well without having to add more flour. I find that a 15 min knead even with the dough hook gives a very even crumb and good strength if one chooses (as I do) to make free-form loaves. For those who use a thermometer to check their bread, I have found that an internal temp of 185-190F yields a very acceptable loaf. And, finally, I omit the oil and have found it makes no difference except to omit about 513 kcal from the loaf. It's become a staple at our house and a gift people appreciate beyond words.
