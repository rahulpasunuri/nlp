I followed the recipe but without the clove and cumin (I knew I wouldn't like them), and luckily reduced the vinegar based on other reviews. Even then, I ended up making extra dressing just to reduce the proportion of vinegar even more. Other than that-- very nice, colorful, and tasty. I will be making this one again.

Just made the dish the other day for a beach picnic and I am not sure what happened but the dish had a bitter aftertaste. The only changes I made (after reading the reviews) were that I used less vinagar and onions. Oh, and I used brown rice to make it a bit healthier... I am inclined to say that the oregano gave it the bitter taste...any ideas from people out there? I'm reluctant to rate it since nobody else had this experience with it...

Tasted much better the next day. I tried it with orzo and it came out pretty well. Served it at a party and everyone really liked it. Needed a bit of spicing up for my tastes, but overall a nice light side dish.

This is a recipe that just surprises you. I needed a rice to complement the turkey in mole sauce and kemp's black bean recipes from this site and this one fit the bill. I modified it by using cotija cheese instead of the goat cheese and white wine rather than red wine vinegar. Lastly I bbq'd fresh corn rather than using frozen. It came out wonderfully and the leftovers the next day were just as good if not better.

I really liked this salad- brought it to a potluck and got many compliments. I had to make another half recipe of dressing though- and even then I thought it could have used a bit more. Used lots of goat cheese in the dressing and stirred in more before serving. Next time I don't think I will add it before serving because at that point it doesn't melt and soak into the rice- it just kind of clumps together.

I have gotten rave reviews when I served this. I love all the crunchy vegetables contrasting with the soft rice. I used more goat cheese stirred in before serving.

I used this recipe as a guide rather than following it to the letter. I switched to Brown Rice. In additon to the required vegetables, I added Zuccinni & Mini-Summer Squash. I replaced the Frozen Corn with Fresh Corn. And then I grilled them all. I also replaced the Goat Cheese with Blue Cheese. Everyone loved the dish.

I got rave reviews when I made this for a group of friends. I did omit the cloves. Added extra goat cheese and a few extra splashes of red wine vinegar before serving. I saved the leftovers and served them a couple days later. Yummy.

Excellent recipe. I would definitely hold back one-third of the dressing to put on at the end. I actually added more olive oil and orange juice before letting it sit, as it looked dry. The cinnamon is barely perceptible. I put cut-up blood oranges on top to serve. Looked great.

I also left the cloves out but used two types of goat cheese and orange, green and red peppers finely chopped, even my husband who does not like peppers really liked it! Absolutely no leftovers :-D

Very good! I was a little worried when making it but was very happy with the results. The existing recipe easily feeds 6-8 people. Based on other input, I made the following changes: used olive oil, cut the following ingredients in half: vinegar, cumin, cloves & onion. Doubled goat cheese and also added orange pepper for additional color. Will definitely make it again.

Too much for two but perfect for 5-6 people. Perfect for a picnic or a BBQ. It also keeps well.

I've made this over and over again and it wins every time. I add half the cloves and cumin the recipe calls for and substitute orzo for the rice (it's more fun and keeps better) and everybody goes insane for this. If it's too dry the next day just throw more extra virgin olive oil in and a pinch of salt. Happy eating!

This recipe was a gummy, starchy mess. I used olive oil, red wine vinegar, goat cheese, cumin in the proportions called for (subsituted cilatro for oregano and grd red pepper for cloves). Also used red & yellow peppers, corn, green onions and black beans (omitting red onion). Admit it was colorful - but after sitting over night in the refregerator - it came out dry and gummy. Even after adding (lots)more olive oil and goat cheese - the salad was disgusting. After apologizing to the potluck eaters - I threw the whole mess out.

Great Recipe--Makes a large amount, great for a cover dish, picnic--too much for two.

This recipe tastes fabulous! I went with the suggestions of other reviewers and halfed the quantity of onions and doubled the goat cheese. I also added a large tomato diced which really added a wow to this already delicious salad.

Excellent. Omit the vinegar. Omit red onion. Omit green pepper. Double the goat cheese. Great with Greek Chickent Kebabs.

We love goat cheese and don't eat meat, so this recipe was great! I can't get over how colorful the salad is - perfect for the summer. We forgot the red onion(oops),added fresh rosemary instead of chives, halved the rest of the recipe and it turned out fantastic (albeit huge). Also, I used canned corn (all I had on hand) and it was fine. My husband kept eating it as I added each veggie. This goes with me to my next potluck for sure!

I made this recipie for an office potluck. It was very good and highly colorful! I made it the night before. Some changes I made: olive oil instead of corn oil; omitted the cloves and red onion; doubled the goat cheese (by adding some to the salad before serving); added extra green onion and yellow bell pepper, plus 1 can of black beans as suggested by another reviewer. I'll try it again and add grilled chicken. Easy to make and very good!

I didn't have any problems with the onions in the recipe like some of the other cooks had. In fact, I had forgotten to put in the green onions and it was too vinegary. I think I would leave out the ground cloves next time, as that flavor addition was a little jarring. Overall, this is a well balanced salad in appearance, flavor and texture. The dressing looked SCARY at first! Glad I continued making the recipe, since I did get some compliments on it.

I thought this salad was very good. I added a bit more goat cheese than was called for and would recommend the same. I must agree with the San Francisco cook's review - it is VERY oniony! May want to use a bit less onions :)

This makes a pretty dish, but I was disappointed in the flavor, even after it aged for a day or so. It is very oniony and not worth the effort

This is a favorite recipe of mine that I have been making since it was first published. I add a can of black beans drained and rinsed.I love it a day or 2 later- the flavors are fantastic- unfortunately there are rarely leftovers.
